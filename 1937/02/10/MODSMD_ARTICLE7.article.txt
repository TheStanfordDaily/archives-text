# Will Union Be Remodeled Into Hotel Lobby Or Modern Night Club?
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Should Stanford's own "Boy Meets
Girl" drama be set in a night club
or a hotel lobby?
This question stopped Ex Commit
tee last night in its weekly session
over what's to become of the nitery.
After Student Manager Chuck
Fontius had presented an interior
decorator's plan for a "lobby"-type
social room in the remodeled Old
Union, Chick Franich, retiring junior
man, doubted its possibilities as a
bona fide "nitery."
Night Club Plans Asked
President Jim Reynolds therefore
asked Franich and Shirley Jones to
draw up suggestions for a Union
"night club" and present them for
Ex Committee's consideration next
week.
Meanwhile, Union Board of Gover
nors will meet later this week to de
cide if they do or do not want to re
juvenate the Old Union at a cost of
approximately $3000. Until official
action by hte Board, any Ex Commit
tee plans are merely tentative.
But despite uncertainty as to the
Union nitery, the Lagunita recreation
center proposed in Bill Ward's ill
fated petition appeared no longer in
the running. Fontius' "lack of funds"
argument killed it as "absolutely in
advisable."
"We Want Atmosphere"
The night club vs. hotel lobby ar
gument began when Franich argued
that the suggested Union arrange
ment, even with partitions removed
and the room redecorated, lacked the
necessary "psychological atmos
phere."
Shirley Jones and Jackie Brown,
retiring junior woman, backed up
Franich's move for candle-lit tables
to create a genuine night club atmos
phere. "That one thing, atmosphere,
can make or break the venture," Miss
Jones declared.
"Do you want a hotel lobby, where
peoplf will read the newspaper and
that's about all?" the retiring junior
man asked.
When Franich moved that more
windows be cut in the room, Fontius
answered: "Why the whole back side
is lousy with windows."
Larry Rouble suggeted more inte
rior decorators get busy and submit
more plans so "we'll have more
choice." Fontius had said that "pro
fessional decorators can turn even a
dog house into something pretty
good."
