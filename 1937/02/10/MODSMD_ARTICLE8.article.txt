## L.A. Airliner Plunges Into Bay; All Lost Searchers Drag Bay for Bodies of Victims While Thousands Line Shore 
### BULLETIN 
Special to The Stanford Daily
Early this morning no trace had
been found of the United Air Lines
plane which crashed into San Fran
cisco Bay off Mills Field last night.
Thousands of curious onlookers
lined Bayshorc Highway awaiting
latest news of the disaster. Search
ers continued dragging the hay, but
it was regarded unlikely that any
thing would he found until dawn.
Eleven persons plunged to death in
San Francisco Bay aboard a United
Air Lines plane at 9 o'clock last night
as it was about to land at Mills Field
after completing its scheduled hop
from Los Angeles.
Attendants at the field said they
saw the plane swing down low over
the bay preparing to land.
Previously the plane had radioed to
have the field illuminated and shut
off its own lights.
Suddenly the plane shot out
again over the water, steadily los
ing altitude until it plunged into
the water about a mile out. Wit
nesses declared they heard an ex
plosion at the moment of the crash.
Three Coast Guard cutters were
dispatched to the scene but early this
morning no trace of the wreckage
had been found.
Weather conditions at the field
were regarded by air officials as fair.
There was only a low ground fog
which might have partTy obliterated
landing lights.

John Gronnon, San Francisco
Gertrude Grennon, San Francisco
