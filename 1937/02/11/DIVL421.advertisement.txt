A CHURNING flood had taken out the telephone line
across a Colorado stream. Repairmen couldn't wade
it because of quicksand — couldn't cross elsewhere and
bring back the line because of obstructions.
Then Kayo's master had an idea. He went upstream,
crossed, came back and whistled. Kayo jumped in—swam
across with a cord tied to his collar. With this cord, the
wire was soon pulled over—communication was restored.
A small incident. But it typifies the ingenuity which
helps Bell System men and women to give you the world s
most dependable telephone service.
