## FREEDOM OF THE PRESS: IS IT YOURS OR MINE? 
### 
A LOOK into the inner sanctum of
the American press that won't
help the newspaper's influence over
the public, but may force public in
fluence over the newspapers, is un
der way before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
The defendants, Associated Press,
contend the Wagner Labor Relations
Act as applied to newspapers is a
"direct, palpable and undisguised
attack on freedom of the press."
The words are those of John W.
Davis, Democratic presidential nomi
nee in 1924.
He is helping the A.P. appeal a de
cision of the New York Regional
Labor Board which ordered the re
instatement of Morris Watson, A.P.
employee, period.
Watson was an organizer for the
American Newspaper Guild, period.
Watson was fired, period.
♦ u *
T>EHIRE Mr. Watson?
'"What does that involve? Hav
ing this man writing and editing
news and broadcasting his selection
to the entire world," Mr. Davis told
the court Tuesday. "What is that but
an invasion of the freedom of the
press?"
In other words, Mr. Davis says
Watson should not be hired because
he might do what every newspaper
owner in the United States does
every day—invade the Freedom of
the Press.
What else can you call owner
domination of newspapers? And
where is the difference between dom
ination of the press by the man who
owns the presses and the building
that houses them, and the man who
actually puts out the paper, the em
ployee?
What Mr. Davis might more accu
rately say is "We protest the inva
sion of Freedom of the Owners of the
Press."
* * *
Freedom of the Press .broadly
interpreted, hardly concerns it
self with, say, the Freedom of the
Grocery Store Owner to hire and fire
whom he pleases.
It's a term that implies the Press'
responsibility to the public, and to
Ihe public alone. And it's just as spe
cific against domination by the indi
vidual, whether he be employer or
employee, as it is against domination
by a government.
In short ,we fail to see that dom
ination can be rated good or bad
according to who does the dominat- I
ing. Yet that is apparently the con
tention of Mr. Davis. And it is also
the contention implied by almost
every newspaper you ever read.
* * *
Wagner Act may go off the
books as the result of the A.P.
case. And that may be either a loss
or a gain, depending on which side
your bread is buttered.
But definitely an asset for the pub
lic will be the revelation of Mr. Davis,
for he has summarized just what ac
tivates the America Press.
Before the case is decided, he may
indicate quite clearly that newspa
pers do not reflect public opinion any
more than they mould it. They quite
naturally tend to work for their own
interests, which are identical to the
interests of the public only insofar
as such identity is necessary to sell
more papers, sell more ads, and make
more money.
His explanation will throw a little
more light on such clumsy chicanery
as the wholesale Landon-plumping
by a majority of the U.S. papers,
which might be called the honest
selection of a candidate, but which i
could be called the shrewd selection !
of the most profitable course for the '
newspaper.
As for Mr. Watson, what ever hap- 1
pens he will probably not get his old
job back. After all, the owner of a
newspaper can't afford to take
chances with his Freedom of the
Press."
And that's a fact, he really can't
afford it. —B. E.
