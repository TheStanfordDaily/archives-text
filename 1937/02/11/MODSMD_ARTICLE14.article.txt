# Encina Tunnel? Sure! But It's Way Too Hot
## 
### BOB O'DAY 
It is possible to enter a tunnel in the rear of Encina store and walk to
the museum —seven-tenths of a mile distant—underground. From this
point, one might continue his subterranean way to the Quad, over to Se
quoia, and back to Encina again by a different route.
This extensive tunneling system which riddles the campus carries Stan
ford's steam pipes. From the plant opposite the 8.A.C., Steam Foreman

+John McGlynn blows hot gas to
, all points on the campus, and causes
the loud noises in the auditorium ra
! diators.
McGlynn, who has kept students
from freezing in their eight o'clocks
| ever since the founding of the Uni
i versity, used to work for Senator
Stanford in the days when the Farm
| catered to the raising of prize trot
| ters. John remembers the time the
senator took pictures of a running
horsfe to settle a bet as to whether
| the animal's four feet were ever off
! the ground at once.
"By Joe," commented John, "I
guess these were just about the first
real movies ever taken!"
The steam plant, in McGlynn's
charge since 1891, was located at the
present corporation yard, but the
1 earthquake shook it down in 1906,
j and it was rebuilt opposite the
| B.A.C.
| Two of the original boilers are still
in use. "Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity — 1891" is engraved across
their tops and John claims they'll
I heat up the place "just as good as
I any new one."
