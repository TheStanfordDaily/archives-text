# Pianist Given Big Ovation After Concert
## Rachmaninoff Renditions Marked by Polished Technique, Fine Style 
### ALLEN DRURY 
A tall man with cropped hair and
the face of a kindly, tired Rameses
came out on the platform, sent a
tolerant glance around a Pavilion
that has never looked quite so tacky
before, sat down before the piano,
and began to play.
'Prelude* Is Encore
That man was Sergei Rachmanin
off, and from the opening notes of
Handel's "Variations in E Major" to
the quiet finish of his own "Prelude
in C Sharp Minor," which lie played
as an encore, he exhibited an artistry
so fine and superbly controlled that
none in his audience will feel that
they can challenge his right to the
title of one of the world's greatest
pianists.
Years of training have made Mr.
Rachmaninoff's technique so much a
part of him that it is completely un
selfconscious. His handling of the
Liszt "Rhapsodie No. 12" brought out
all the nuances of that difficult piece,
winning for him an ovation greater
than has been given a Concert Se
ries artist this year; and the lighter
touch which he gave to the Chopin
"Nocturne in F Major" and the
"Fairy Tale" by Medtner brilliantly
contrasted with the force displayed
in the Borodin "Scherzo" and his owri
"Oriental Sketch."
Moderns Recognized
The two modern compositions by
John Field, "Nocturne in G Major,"
and "Nocturne Characteristic" were
favorably received, although perhaps
not equal in appeal to the Beethoven
"Sonata in D Minor" and the Chopin
"Tarantelle." He gave no encore at
intermission time, but brought down
the house with the rendering he gave
the "Prelude," following the final
group of numbers.
