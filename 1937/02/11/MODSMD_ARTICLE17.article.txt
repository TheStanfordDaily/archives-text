"The 'County Fair' was a complete
success due to the willing co-opera
tion of everyone concerned." Thus
spoke Barbara Kimball, president of
the Women's Conference, after the
returns had been tabulated and ex
penses met. "The affair should be
continued next year by all means."
Replacing the probationed Wom
en's Conference fall quarter party,
the County Fair raised $216 to be
used in starting a woman's scholar
ship fund.
