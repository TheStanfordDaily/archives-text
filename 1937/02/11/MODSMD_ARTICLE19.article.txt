# 'Idolatry' Players Meet Problem Of Adopting Elizabethan Roles
## Stafnord Rough Studies Airy Kiss Throwing 
### 
Among the problems besetting cast
members of "This Side Idolatry," to
be presented Friday and Saturday
nights in the Assembly Hall, is that
of accustoming themselves to life as
it was in the Elizabethan era.
Mannerisms of modern times must
be eliminated. The Stanford Rough
must learn to airily throw a kiss to
his love, and to make the transition
from carrying four or five books
around Quad to gracefully toting a
lacy handkerchief.
The drinking man of Shake
speare's day did not balance a
frosted glass,, but used both hands to
lift the heavy pewter tankards in
use at the time.
"This Side Idolatry" portrays
Shakespearean life with action and
dialogue that is thoroughly modern.
Lead in the production is taken by
Phil Brown, in the role of Shake
speare, with Virginia Rogers, Onyet
Watson, George Wood, and Judd
Sturtevant in other important parts.
Tickets for the play may be ob
tained at the A.S.S.U. office from
9 to 5 o'clock today. Prices are $1,
75 cents, 50 cents, and 35 cents for
balcony seats.
A New York store now offers shoe
horns with two and a half foot han
dles for men with over-developed
paunches.
