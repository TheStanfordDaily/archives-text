# F.D.R. Halts Second Court Bill in House
## White House Intercedes When First Measure Fails To Please Chief 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UP).—
i President Roosevelt intervened today
I to halt House consideration of a sec
i ond judicial reorganization bill after
j the chamber passed and sent to the
! Senate a measure providing volun
j tary retirement of Supreme Court
! justices on full pay at the age of 70.
Chairman Hatton W. Saunders of
| the House Judiciary Committee ad-
I mitted White House intercession
J after the chamber passed Sumners'
j retirement bill, 315 to 75, then ad-
J journed when Sumners announced
I that his second bill, permitting gov
ernment intervention in court cases
involving constitutional tests, was not
ready for consideration.
No Compulsion
The bill adopted does not compel
; retirement, but enables a Supreme
Court Justice to retire on full pay—
$20,000 a year—where at present the
salary is subject to congressional
whim. The bill differs from a similar
feature of the President's plan in
that Mr. Roosevelt asks power to ap
• point additional judges where jur
! ists fail to retire within six months
|of their 70th birthday. This would
I enable him to increase the Supreme
Court membership te 15 provided
i over-age justices did not voluntarily
| retire.
Sumners called the bill from the
: calendar instead of taking it through
j the Rules Committee, an unusual
| procedure for major bills. This per
j mitted two hours' debate and left
| the measure wide open to amend
; ment. Only one amendment was of
! fered and it was quickly defeated.
Bill Questioned
Pressed for reasons why the second
I bill was not called up, Sumners ad
| mitted to newspapermen that "the
1 White House has some question
about the bill." He said he under
stood there was a White House note
awaiting him at his office outlining
the President's attitude.
"I don't know just what the issues
i are," he said.
Under the retirement bill Supreme
| Court justices would receive the
! same privileges accorded lower fed
eral court jurists. They could re
| tire on full pay at 70 after 10 years'
! service.
The measure was passed after two
hours' debate .summarizing most of
j the controversy that has raged over
Mr. Roosevelt's own Supreme Court
proposal. Sumners earlier visited the
White House. But he declined to in
j tlmate whether President Roosevelt
| raised any objections to the retire
| ment measure.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UP).—
i President Roosevelt intervened today
I to halt House consideration of a sec
i ond judicial reorganization bill after
j the chamber passed and sent to the
! Senate a measure providing volun
j tary retirement of Supreme Court
! justices on full pay at the age of 70.
Chairman Hatton W. Saunders of
| the House Judiciary Committee ad-
I mitted White House intercession
J after the chamber passed Sumners'
j retirement bill, 315 to 75, then ad-
J journed when Sumners announced
I that his second bill, permitting gov
ernment intervention in court cases
involving constitutional tests, was not
ready for consideration.
No Compulsion
The bill adopted does not compel
; retirement, but enables a Supreme
Court Justice to retire on full pay—
$20,000 a year—where at present the
salary is subject to congressional
whim. The bill differs from a similar
feature of the President's plan in
that Mr. Roosevelt asks power to ap
• point additional judges where jur
! ists fail to retire within six months
|of their 70th birthday. This would
I enable him to increase the Supreme
Court membership te 15 provided
i over-age justices did not voluntarily
| retire.
Sumners called the bill from the
: calendar instead of taking it through
j the Rules Committee, an unusual
| procedure for major bills. This per
j mitted two hours' debate and left
| the measure wide open to amend
; ment. Only one amendment was of
! fered and it was quickly defeated.
Bill Questioned
Pressed for reasons why the second
I bill was not called up, Sumners ad
| mitted to newspapermen that "the
1 White House has some question
about the bill." He said he under
stood there was a White House note
awaiting him at his office outlining
the President's attitude.
"I don't know just what the issues
i are," he said.
