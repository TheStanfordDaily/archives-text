# Bus Line Nine Defeats Cards In Close Game
## First Inning Slump Leads To Pre-season Defeat; Linde and Johnson Star 
### 
A brace of runs scored in the first
inning off Pitcher Neil Rasmussen on
a walk, a sacrifice, two errors, and
a wild pitch, were enough for the
Pacific Greyhound nine to defeat the
Stanford varsity baseball team yes
terday, 2-1, in a fast nine inning
game.
"Pudgy" Gould, one of the very
few spit-ball pitchers in organized
baseball when that practice was out
lawed, held the local boys to five
hits. Linde and Johnson singled oft'
the ex-Coast league ace in the sev
enth stanza. Farrell sacrificed and
Johnson, momentarily confused, was
also tagged off first. Linde, who had
rounded third, drew a wild throw
from the first baseman and scored.
Rasmussen settled down and pitch
ed good ball, as did his successors,
Killefer, Paine, and Furman. Fur
rnan got by the last three innings
without a man reaching first. In the
field Linde looked especially good on
slow hit balls toward third base.
Catcher Leo Heagerty nipped two of
the Greyhounds at second base and
picked a third off first to aid the
pitchers considerably.
The "tension" of an undefeated
season has been erased and Coach
Harry Wolter's boys look right to win
their conference opener from Santa j
Clara here Saturday.
