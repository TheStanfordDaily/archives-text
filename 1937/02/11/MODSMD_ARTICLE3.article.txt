# Eight Bodies Of Air Crash Victims Lost
## Search for Passengers Spurred; Stewardess, Pilots Found in Ship 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10 (UP).â€”
Coast Guard cutters, police boats,
and airplanes shot flares over San
Francisco Bay tonight, searching for
eight bodies, all passengers, who dis
appeared mysteriously after a giant
United Air Lines plane crashed into
the bay a few seconds before it was
scheduled to land at Mills Field.
Three Bodies Found
The bodies of the two pilots and
the stewardess were recovered. They
were in the plane when it was lifted
from the water by a derrick, after
being sighted by a Coast Guard cut
ter.
Air line officials believed bodies of
the eight passengers, all of whom had
adjusted safety belts preparatory to
landing, had been cut in two and
floated away.
It might be months before their re
mains are recovered, Coroner Wil
liam Crosby said.
The top of the plane's passenger
cabin had been ripped away. The
ship was found upside-down in 18
feet of water.
It was en route from Los Angeles
to San Francisco and was due at
Mills Field at 9 p.m. Tuesday. A few
minutes after 9 p.m. pilot A. R.
Thompson radioed Ted Martin, chief
radio operator at the field, that he
could not make the north-south run
way landing. He did not say why.
Martin suggested he try the east
west runway. The sky was clear
and there was no wind.
Cause Doubtful
Thompson circled the field and
flew out over the water of San Fran
cisco Bay. He was headed back to
the airport when tihe plane crashed.
One theory as to the cause of the
wreck was that a motor of the new,
twin-row Wasp motored Douglas
plane exploded, igniting the ship's
fuel supply and causing an explosion.
One motor and the right wing of the
ship were missing when the wreck
age was lifted from the bay.
Passengers and crew were killed
instantly.
