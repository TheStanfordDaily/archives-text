## Co-eds Can't Take Quiet Life at 'Get-Wellery'

Harassed by halitosis? Mooning |
over midquarters
Sister, your lot is a snap compared |
with thaf of 12 incarcerated co-eds |
in the Women's Rest Home. Believe j
me; I know. I didn't want to go
there in the first place, but that was
besfde the point. I had a tempera- j
ture, and people would catch bugs.
Rest home routine is simple, but
unviolable — and inevitable. Break
fast at 7:15. A snooze. Lunch at
11:30. An afternoon siesta. Supper
at 5:30. A period of hibernation.
Lights out at 9 p.m.
Between meals — consisting mostly
of soup and custard—a nurse pop
ped in at intervals, jabbed a ther
mometer in my mouth, fed me a glass
of sticky fruit juice, and popped off
to the next victim.
Cries of "Let me out of here!" and
"I wanna go home!" echoed along the
corridors from kindred spirits in the
home. ,
Visitors and phone calls are taboo
in the rest home, but the nurses are
very obliging about carrying mes
sages. It's the monotony of the place
that finally gets one. As soon as you
find a diversion, they take it away.
They wouldn't even let me study too
much. Pillow fights too are discour
aged. ,
When my man-of-the-moment
called to inquire after my ill-being,
I crawled to the window and shriek
ed down to htm.
"Hello!" he said. "What's the mat
ter with you?"
'Oh,' I replied, "I'm recuperating
from a hot-alcohol back-rub, a Vicks
vapor chest-rub, a hot-water bot
tle, and some nasty nose drops the
nurse has just seen fit to torture me
with."
At this juncture, the nurse herself
swooped down on me, and I was in
disgrace for the rest of the day.
Strictly against, regulations to talk
out of windows, and besides, I didn't
have on my bedroom slippers. You'd
have thought I was sick or some
thing.

nurse has just seen fit to torture me
with."

Strictly against, regulations to talk
out of windows, and besides, I didn't
have on my bedroom slippers. You'd
have thought I was sick or some
thing.
