BLESSINGS ON THEE,
MR. DOE
Never having been on a pair of skis
myself, or even a pair of ice-skates,
I have sworn up and down that some
day I will hie myself to the snow
and engage in telemarks and slaloms
and such till I'm blue in the face.
But that is for another day. The
closest contact I have with it now is
when somebody like this gentleman,
a former sports editor of the Daily,
sends in a little .giant on what's going
on in the woild of spawt. "This gen
tleman" refers to the contributor of
the following anecdote — for some
reason he prefers to remain anony
mous . It's fellers like him that pro
vide bright spots in the life of fellers
like me, with attempts to give a
little unsolicited aid. T'anks, kid:
This wouldn't happen in any other
intercollegiate sporf bat skiing. It
happened last week-end up at Nor
den, on the Donner summit.
It happened to Bob Arnold, one of
the top Stanford ski team men, and
Dr. Joel Hildebrand, coach of the
California winter sports team.
Hildebrand, who was manager of
the U.S. Olympic team at Garmisch
last winter, was holding time trials
for his boys over a difficult slalom
course. Arnold, all unknowing of
these details, was fooling around on
the hill and quite naturally wanted
to try the course himself.
So he got to the top, waved to the
Doctor, and started down. He raced
down gracefully between the little
flags, made a nice christy at the fin

ish, and started up again.
"Ilftld on, my boy," called Hilde
brand to him.
"Yes, sir," smiled Bob, still inno
cent of the facts.
"You just made faster time than
any of my old veterans on that run.
What's your name? You can be on
my team any old time."
"That's swell," grinned Bob,
pleased. "But what team?"
"What team? Why, Cal, of course."
Bob sort of gulped and looked
around sheepishly as if for a place to
hide. But one of Bob's mates from
the Farm stepped in at this point
and explained to the good professor
that Bob was not eligible for the Cal
ski team, as he was from Stanford.
It caused quite a sensation up on
the hill, and was a little embarrassing
to the Bear slippery stick artists, and
now a few people know that Stanford
has got a ski team.
While John Bunn and the boys
are down south this week-end trying
to sew up a couple more, California is
going to have its hands full an
attempt to take at least one game
from the mighty Trojans at Berkeley
Friday or Saturday.
Nibs Price, at the beginning of this
week, figured that Chet Carlisle and
Bob Duffy had finally regained their
shooting eyes and that the Bears
were all set to beat Troy. Well, may
be Carlisle is back in shape, but if
Duffy can hit his hat this week-end
in the very tough competition that
the Trojans put up he certainly has
changed. —Peterson

the following anecdote — for some
reason he prefers to remain anony
mous . It's fellers like him that pro
vide bright spots in the life of fellers
like me, with attempts to give a
little unsolicited aid. T'anks, kid:
This wouldn't happen in any other
intercollegiate sporf bat skiing. It
happened last week-end up at Nor
den, on the Donner summit.
It happened to Bob Arnold, one of
the top Stanford ski team men, and
Dr. Joel Hildebrand, coach of the
California winter sports team.
Hildebrand, who was manager of
the U.S. Olympic team at Garmisch
last winter, was holding time trials
for his boys over a difficult slalom
course. Arnold, all unknowing of
these details, was fooling around on
the hill and quite naturally wanted
to try the course himself.
So he got to the top, waved to the
Doctor, and started down. He raced
down gracefully between the little
flags, made a nice christy at the fin

ish, and started up again.
"Ilftld on, my boy," called Hilde
brand to him.
"Yes, sir," smiled Bob, still inno
cent of the facts.
"You just made faster time than
any of my old veterans on that run.
What's your name? You can be on
my team any old time."
"That's swell," grinned Bob,
pleased. "But what team?"
"What team? Why, Cal, of course."
Bob sort of gulped and looked
around sheepishly as if for a place to
hide. But one of Bob's mates from
the Farm stepped in at this point
and explained to the good professor
that Bob was not eligible for the Cal
ski team, as he was from Stanford.
It caused quite a sensation up on
the hill, and was a little embarrassing
to the Bear slippery stick artists, and
now a few people know that Stanford
has got a ski team.
While John Bunn and the boys
are down south this week-end trying
to sew up a couple more, California is
going to have its hands full an
attempt to take at least one game
from the mighty Trojans at Berkeley
Friday or Saturday.
Nibs Price, at the beginning of this
week, figured that Chet Carlisle and
Bob Duffy had finally regained their
shooting eyes and that the Bears
were all set to beat Troy. Well, may
be Carlisle is back in shape, but if
Duffy can hit his hat this week-end
in the very tough competition that
the Trojans put up he certainly has
changed. —Peterson
BLESSINGS ON THEE,

Never having been on a pair of skis
myself, or even a pair of ice-skates,
I have sworn up and down that some
day I will hie myself to the snow
and engage in telemarks and slaloms
and such till I'm blue in the face.
But that is for another day. The
closest contact I have with it now is
when somebody like this gentleman,
a former sports editor of the Daily,
sends in a little .giant on what's going
on in the woild of spawt. "This gen
