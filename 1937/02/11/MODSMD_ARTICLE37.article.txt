# Frosh Quintet Set For Auburn Scrap
## 
### 
It's a hard job keeping up with
Stanford's Papoose basketballers.
Monday, in practice, Sherwood
Norton cracked a rib. At dinner that ,
night he couldn't even lift his right j
arm. Yesterday afternoon he was
practicing with just as much activity
as the rest of the boys.
All of which leaves the Papoose
squad in perfect shape, minus Leon
Lafaille, whose right leg is taped stiff
because of his water-on-the-knee. At
least they were in perfect shape at
4:15, when last seen.
Now, if none of them gets indiges
tion, or falls in the showers, the boys 1
will have very good chances of win- 1
ning their eleventh consecutive j
game of the season, this time against |
Auburn High, whom they meet next j
Saturday night in the Pavilion.
Mentored by Big Chief John Bunn 1
and Pee-Wee Dale Huff, the first
stringers yesterday practiced solely
on defense, learning which way and
when to shift against an offense as i
demonstrated by the germies.
