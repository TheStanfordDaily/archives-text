# Ruggers Meet U.S.C. Saturday
## Stanford Travels South; Trojan Team Strong 
### 
That U.S.C. has a good rugby
team, but does not use its strength to
advantage, was reported by a scout
to Coach Harry Maloney, who will
take his Card varsity to Los Angeles
to meet the Southern Cal ruggers
this week-end.
The report says that one of the
most dangerous men on the Trojan
team is the 210-pound scrum half,
Radovich, who, in spite of his weight,
is one of the fastest men on the
Trojan squad.
The backs as a whole, however,
are almost always flatfooted when
they get the ball and don't seem to
know what to do with it, according
to the report.
The Cards have succeeded in pull
ing themselves out of the slump they
were in last week and expect to give
the Trojans the battle of the season.
