# Indian Hoopsters Roll South for Bruin Game
## 
### GORDY FROST 
They'll be rolling southward again tonight, these Stanford Redshirts, to
laugh and play basketball for a while with U.C.L.A.'s brow-beaten Bruin
in the Fan-Pacific Auditorium at Los Angeles Friday and Saturday nights.
And unless something most unexpected happens, they'll still be laughing
come next Monday.
But alter last night's scrimmage session when first varsity members
had it out with the "gas house gang." Headman John Bunn's laugh wasn't

•quite as hearty as usual, for Bunn
was not fully satisfied.
True, the regulars went to work
and clicked out a neat 20 points after
only a few minutes' play. But then
followed a noticeable let-down, a
certain sloppiness, not entirely will
ful — and that was what worried
Boss Bunn.
No Laughs
Ucla, at the conference door mat,
still can upset over-confident (what
an overworked word) basketball
team. Stanford can't afford to be up
set. That's why Bunn didn't belly
laugh.
But the 12 men who leave tonight
are not worrying.
No, the Messrs. Calderwood, Heath,
Lee, Lyon, Luisetti, Moore, Quade,
Robertson, Stoefen, Turner, P.
Zonae, and B. Zonne aren't crossing
any bridges. They'll talk with bas
kets this week-end.
Foul Situation
An interesting sidelight on the
current foul situation comes to light.
Recent reports from across the bay
rightfully state that California is low
in number of foul's called to date,
having 74 to Stanford's 89 and U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A.'s 93. With it comes an
off-color crack about Bunn's face be
ing red—but we'll forget that.
What should be taken into consid
eration, however, on this foul situa
tion is that Stanford has played 14
men, while California has used only
10. This gives Stanford the low posi
tion for fouls per man, standing at
6.4 to Cal's 7.4. That makes a dif
ference.
