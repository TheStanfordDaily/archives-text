# NESTELL STILL TOPS

### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9 (UP). â€”
Bob Nestell, the cowboy heavy
weight, who looks like Gene Tunney
and has yet to lose a professional
fight, hammered blubbery King Le
vinsky, ex-fish peddler from Chicago,
into submission in the tenth round in
a bruising battle Tuesday night.
There are only four students from
Europe at Stanford.
