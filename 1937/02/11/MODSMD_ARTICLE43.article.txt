# Card Team Faces San Jose Tankmen
## 
### 
Coach Norl Thornton's Indian var
sity will meet San Jose State in a
three-way swimming meet with the
varsity and frosh squads Friday night
in the Garden City. While Farm
hopes are high several close events
are scheduled and it is expected that
perhaps a pool record or two may be
shattered.
Main event of the evening is the
150-yard back-stroke between Card
Hal Weatherbe and Spartan Howard
Withycombe. The San Jose champion
is still the favorite in spite of the
beating he took last year at the Fair
mont Plunge from the Stanford star.
The Card 400-yard relay team of
Tench, Scatena, Vibert, and MacKen
zie will attempt to shatter the pool
record made by the Spartans a few
years ago in defeating a farm team.
Winfield Needham and Dave Rider
will be kept out of the 220 to battle
out the 440 for a record try.
The State frosh, who recently took
a three-cornered meet with the San
Francisco Y.M.C.A. to beat out their
own varsity, are expected to edge
them out again Friday night to take
second place.
