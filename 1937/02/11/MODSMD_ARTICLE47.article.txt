S.F. AIR CRASH KILLS 11" — yesterday's
bold-faced streamer which blazed from con
servative Stanford's Daily, nearly killed more
than eleven of Stanford's conservative many.
Campus eyes which were long used to look
ing down their corporate noses, grew bloodshot
at the sight of a black streak across paper which
too often is uniformly grey.
The trouble with Stanford is that it's too in
terested in Stanford. Like a lot of smooth mar
bles rolling around in a glass bowl, people who
live on this Farm rub smoothly by other people
who live on this Farm, but don't look outside
often enough to see the marbles that hit each
other.
Stanford tries to live in its own back yard, but
the trouble is that Stanford hasn't any back
yard. Except for a bit of Ex Committee, and
Men's Council, and Women's Conference and
the like, the goings-on in Stanford's fishbowl
are nil. In fact, a lot of people think that the
goings-on in Women's Conference and Men's
Council and Ex Committee and the like might
as v/ell not go on.
The marbles outside don't have a smooth
bowl to roll in, and aren't all symmetrical, like
Stanford marbles.
Sometimes they roll crooked, and hit and
break, and sometimes they don't roll at all.
Their goings-on are interesting, if not under
standable.
Stanford, in all its smooth revolving, can once
in a while look through its bowl and watch the
crazy antics outside, just as those outside look
in once in a while.
And then, if one marble hits another, maybe
Stanford's newspaper should point out through
the glass and say "S.F. AIR CRASH KILLS 11."
