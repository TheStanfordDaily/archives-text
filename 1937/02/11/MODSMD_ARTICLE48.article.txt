(From the Oklahoma Daily)
HARVARD has the right system for student
protection and the squelching of damaging
publicity to the school.
A picture, published in a recent issue of Life
magazine, showed a Harvard student being led
from the rear door of Cambridge police station,
his head covered by a coat, by the head of Har
vard Yard police. These Harvard policemen
make it their duty to protect students and the
school by bailing eds and coeds out of jail
when they get into trouble.
How different the situations would be if
schools over the midwest were to change their
methods of handling incorrigible students. In
stead of allowing scandalous news—which al
ways reflects directly back on the school—to
be spread over pages of state newspapers to
be read by students' parents and prospective
students' parents, why can't our school officials
co-operate with local police and keep our stu
dent law-breaking within the college's jurisdic
tion.
That wouldn't mean that students would not
be punished by civil authorities, but it would
mean that students would not be allowed to
lie in filthy cells, with only one drinking cup,
and a syphilitic cellmate to sleep with through
the night. That would be done away with be
cause campus officials would be called, the stu
dent bailed out, and taken under the school
police's responsibility.
That would stop our city newspapers from
smearing our schools over their front pages in
connection with drunkenness and thievery.—
