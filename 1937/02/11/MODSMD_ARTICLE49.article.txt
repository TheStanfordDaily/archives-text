# Birding the A.S.U.

### 
(From the Chicago Daily Maroon)
Frequent has been the mention in the many
letters which The Daily Maroon has received
from members of the ASU that the American
Student Union stands primarily for the ideals of
American democracy. We have been greatly
impressed by this statement, but have failed to
see this idea carried out in the platform of the
organization.
Searching through the statements made in
convention and out by the Union we can find
no mention of a planned program to promote
campaigns against many evils which can be
easily recognized in the political system as it
exists today.
An organization which claims to be as com
prehensive in its program as the ASU should
cover every phase of American life. Besides
active support of peace and labor, we suggest,
since the Union is a group for action, that it
cjet behind a national program to advance:

1. An extension of the civil service to include
all aon-policy forming employees of local, state,
and federal governments.
2. The appointment rather than popular elec
tion of judges.
3. The consolidation of local governments to
remove administrative waste.
4. The adoption of the city-manager plan by
cities over 100,000 in population.
We believe that these four points are ad
mirable objectives towards which a group such
as the American Student Union should work;
but we know that it will never adopt planks
containing them in their platform. They are not
proper goals for a group which must have a
cause.
To exlain what is meant by a cause, it might
be said in explanation that it is an emotional
rallying point for a group that believes it is
highly rational and purely objective in its view
point toward everything concerned.
In short, we might say, in the words of one
prominent member of the ASU, that "the pro
gram lacks an appeal to the imagination."
