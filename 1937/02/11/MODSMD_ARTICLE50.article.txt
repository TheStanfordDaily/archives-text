# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
INDUSTRIAL UNREST which has rent apart our so
cial structure from coast to coast from left to right
and from top to bottom, causing broken homes, broken
chairs, broken rockers, disease, dissipation and dises
tablishmentarianism, bids fair to move in on the Stan
ford Farm. No, I am not speaking of the janitors, but of
that great dispossessed class: the hashers.
Last fall an abortive attempt was made by the
Alpha Delt head hasher at the Deegee house to in
stitute collective bargaining up the Row. The Hash
ers' Union was going to organize for better working
conditions, pay for overtime, more seconds, and more
choice in the selection of pledges. The movement failed
when the head-hashers in the other houses thought it
sounded more like an attempt to get more Alpha Delt
head-hashers in the sororities.
Though this unionization attempt failed, there is
a definite SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP strike going on
at the Chi O house.
The Chi O personnel problem arose when the Chi
O hierarchy decided that the Chi O lowerarchy was
getting too familiar with the hashers. It seems that
instead of biting, some of the girls wanted to hold the
hand that feeds them.
So, they laid down the interdict: hashers couldn't
speak to the girls during meal time or when they had
their jackets, on.
The hashers, being essentially noble beasts of bur
den, resented this, and undertook retaliatory measures,
and adopted passive resistance.
The result of the SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP strike
is that the hashers now refuse to speak to the girls
either on or off duty. They have cancelled all dates, and
other extra-curricular engagements. During meals, the
hashers have attempted an austere manner, and have
abided strictly by the rules, ignoring all requests for
seconds, except those that come from the official source,
the house mother. Then, too, there is often a great
difficulty in getting the orders filled correctly.
Both sides seem to be immovable in this great strug
gle. The question of who will win seems to be a matter
of endurance and brute strength. The hashers have
been the first to show signs of the strain, betraying a
haggard look as the result of their enforced monasti
cism. During the latest round, they were seen to walk
into the dining room with starry eyes, their lips utter
ing guttural sounds as they talked to themselves.

of endurance and brute strength. The hashers have
been the first to show signs of the strain, betraying a
haggard look as the result of their enforced monasti

INDUSTRIAL UNREST which has rent apart our so
cial structure from coast to coast from left to right
and from top to bottom, causing broken homes, broken
chairs, broken rockers, disease, dissipation and dises
tablishmentarianism, bids fair to move in on the Stan
ford Farm. No, I am not speaking of the janitors, but of
that great dispossessed class: the hashers.
Last fall an abortive attempt was made by the
Alpha Delt head hasher at the Deegee house to in
stitute collective bargaining up the Row. The Hash
ers' Union was going to organize for better working
conditions, pay for overtime, more seconds, and more
choice in the selection of pledges. The movement failed
when the head-hashers in the other houses thought it
sounded more like an attempt to get more Alpha Delt
head-hashers in the sororities.
Though this unionization attempt failed, there is
a definite SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP strike going on
at the Chi O house.
The Chi O personnel problem arose when the Chi
O hierarchy decided that the Chi O lowerarchy was
getting too familiar with the hashers. It seems that
instead of biting, some of the girls wanted to hold the
hand that feeds them.
So, they laid down the interdict: hashers couldn't
speak to the girls during meal time or when they had
their jackets, on.
The hashers, being essentially noble beasts of bur
den, resented this, and undertook retaliatory measures,
and adopted passive resistance.
The result of the SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP strike
is that the hashers now refuse to speak to the girls
either on or off duty. They have cancelled all dates, and
other extra-curricular engagements. During meals, the
hashers have attempted an austere manner, and have
abided strictly by the rules, ignoring all requests for
seconds, except those that come from the official source,
the house mother. Then, too, there is often a great
difficulty in getting the orders filled correctly.
Both sides seem to be immovable in this great strug
gle. The question of who will win seems to be a matter
of endurance and brute strength. The hashers have
been the first to show signs of the strain, betraying a
haggard look as the result of their enforced monasti
cism. During the latest round, they were seen to walk
into the dining room with starry eyes, their lips utter
ing guttural sounds as they talked to themselves.
