CRASH, CRACK, YOU'RE DEAD
IV/HEN a pilot tries to turn a plane on a chip of wood
floating in the bay, he gets his wings wet. And
that's not all.
It's not the speed at which you travel, it's the speed
with which you stop that breaks your neck. And even
if you don't sufTer a broken neck, you still have a chance
of drowning.
Several years ago the army took over the job of
flying the mail for profit, thereby paralyzing passenger
service. But eight or nine pilots were killed, and in
less than a month four or five ships were wrecked. Of
course the ships weren't worth wrecking to begin with
so that didn't make much difference.
The wiseacres all sat back and said it served the
government right for sticking its nose in other people's
business. Maybe so. Anyway—
The army gave the mail contracts back to the air
lines
who have killed
seventy-one persons since December 15, 1936.

It seemed the government didn't have enough equip
ment; no radio beams, no two-way radio, no radio this,
no radio that, no automatic pilots, but there was one
thing the government did have enough of and that was
crashes.
Yesterday corporate America looked at the front
page and gasped. Yes, they are all dead, junior.
It wondered how the commercial companies, who
make playing safe a business, could possibly be acces
sories to so many deaths and it especially wondered
this when it thought over the fact that the commercial
lines have all the equipment the army lacked.
Millions of dollars a year are spent for the best
planes, the best pilots, the best airports. Then suddenly
there is a crash on some far off mountainside.
"Weather," says everyone and the officials don't
bother to contradict.

But the night before last a light ground mist floated
eerily across Mills Field. Scudding clouds sifted over
the stars. The man in the control tower yawned and
looked out. over the flat reaches of the bay. He heard
the plane from Los Angeles coming down the bay, saw
its lights, one red, one green shooting out of the night
to meet him. Field lights flooded up to meet the silver
sides of the plane coming in low and fast. Suddenly
the control man heard a rushing roar. The plane dis
appeared in the darkness and was gone. Silence.
The very famous equipment was working well, Ihe
weather was perfect, but the Douglas luxury liner,
supposedly flawless in every detail, ended up with its
wheels in the air and its nose deep in the mud.
the tomb of 11 men and women.
A fitting nose-thumb to progress.
Equipment perfect, weather perfect, letter perfect,
but a man was at the other end of it all, and Man is
never perfect. As long as cars ride the highways, as
long as ships sail the sea, as long as planes fly the
skies, and as long as man has to sit at the business end
of his machines there will be accidents and men will die.
I suppose you would call it social lag.
