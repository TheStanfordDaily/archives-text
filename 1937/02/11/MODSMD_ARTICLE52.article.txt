## REMBRANDT 
### 
Stanford Theater
Charles Laughton with a blond I
mustache, curly hair, and shabby I
clothes plays Rembrandt, the man.
Gertrude Lawrence and Elsa Lan- j
Chester, successive housekeepers and
mistresses, support and enslave him,
from beginning to end of the produc
tion.
Under the skillful direction of Al- j
exander Korda the plot started at a
rapid pace with Rembrandt deciding 1
not to paint "The Officers of the J
Guard." fn five minutes, over some j
ale, he capitulates. He needed the
money to buy a bracelet to put on 1
his wife when he painted her.
While he is drinking the ale, his |
wife dies. He paints the picture asj
the funeral bells toll and the guests)
eat dinner. He says, "Thanks" when!
the Prince of Orange sends a mes- i
senger with his sympathies. HCj
paints with a chair for a model, say- j
ing, "I can see the bracelet on her \
wrist."
Then, with the painting of noble |
guardsmen, his duwnfall started. He
painted in only six of the sixteen |
and they were laughable. His repu- j
tation was lost. He couldn't get an- J
other commission that he would j
paint. He spent his time running up
bills and painting beggars.
Most impressive scenes were the;
numerous quotations from the Bible, j
given at the slightest excuse, over a j
tankard of beer, while painting a i
beggar, or sitting in front of his I
father's hearth on a short visit home, j
Last scene of all was Rembrandt j
doing his famous "Self-Portrait." He;
muttered over and over, "All is van- j
ity, vanity."
Extremely amusing, though slower j
and less active than the usual j
Laughton vehicle, REMBRANDT is;
well worth seeing.
