Every detail of this suit is smart and new: the
carefree swing of the bolero jacket above a
slim, snug waist; the smooth wide shoulders;
the bright fringed sash; the crisp young collar
of white pique. We feature it here because it
is tangible proof of our oft-repeated advice --
buy your moderately priced clothes in a fine shop.
