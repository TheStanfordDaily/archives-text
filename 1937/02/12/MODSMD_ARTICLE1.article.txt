## GOD TAKES TO THE ROAD IN A TRAILER 
### 
in the dust of the
trailer houses, which brought a
home to you, instead of making you
go out and build one, is a trailer
church, proposed by the Most Rev.
Gerald Shaughnessy, Catholic Bish
op of Seattle.
So freakish is this extension of the
trailer movement to you and me
that news editors tend to spot it as
a front page feature—with more ref
erence to religion as a freak than to
the trailer.
The Holy Spirit, it is said, will be
worshipped at one night stands, and
will be chaufTeured during the day
in "motor missions."
Biblical sanction for the movable
shrine is derived from the Biblical
command—"And God said: Go out
into the highways and hedges and
compel them to come in that my
house may be filled."
* # #
r T , HE command is apt, for God's
houses are not being filled today,
either by heavenly compulsion or
human cajoling.
And to put them on wheels will not
necessarily fill them with worship
pers of God, but worshippers of the
novel.
The latter type of parishioner is
nothing new to ordinary churches
without wheels.
Twenty years ago they could stand
always in the same place, offer the
same type of sermon Sunday after
Sunday, and get not only community
support, but community interest.
The church was naturally the center
of social life. As such it prospered,
and with it, the avenging God that
stood back of it.
Then weakness appeared; the
avenging God ceased to avenge with
any consistency. Pulpit parables be
came at odds with life when they
interpreted it.
so, God got second billing.
Today churches, particularly
those in cities, talk about everything
but the Holy Word. They compete
with the current event lecturer with
sermons on current events. They
compete with the movies with more
movies. They compete with social
parties by organized get-togethers.
God has become simply a hollow
justification for entertainment that
might be given anywhere, and is
given in a church with the desperate
hope that people may thereby main
tain a nodding acquaintance with
their Maker and Destroyer.
IN the parlance of Broadway, God
simply hasn't any box office.
Without meaning to be irreverent,
almost any movie star, any door-to
dor hawker, can draw a bigger
crowd.
Because for some reason a tricky
razor-blade sharpener or Sonja Hcn
ie have more bearing on our lives
than the Spirit or Being that may or
may not have brought us Sonja, and
that indirectly brought us razors.
Perhaps it's because we are too
busy living to find out why we're
living; perhaps it's because His laws
have had their teeth blunted by a
new set. of crimes, but God seems to
make of us either an implacable
force to whom human wishes mean
nothing, or a pleasant gentleman,
just a little amazed by a new world,
and not qi ite sure he wants to
bother it.
As a trailer dweller, he could see
that world. But it's almost a cer
tainty the world won't see God, but
the trailer. —B. E.
