Airplanes crash, but the mail goes
through!
Despite Wednesday night's acci
dent, Stanford received at least two
letters yesterday carried on the ill
fated plane which plunged into San
Francisco Buy, carrying 11 to their
deaths.
The letters had been water soaked,
the addresses were blurred, one of
the stamps was missing, and the en
velopes had become unstuck.
But they were delivered to Harry
Press and Bill Martin, officially re
sealed, with the whole story stamped
on the back: "Damage due to air
mail interruption near San Fran
cisco, Calif. Feb. 10 1937."
Meanwhile, according to United
Press, search continues for seven of
the bodies, while United Air Lines
launches an investigation into the
causes of the fatal crash. Latest of
the four bodies already found was
that of Mark Fontana, millionaire
San Francisco sportsman and food
manufacturer.
Having torn off some of his clothes,
Fontana was evidently alive after the
crash and made a desperate effort to
escape drowning.
