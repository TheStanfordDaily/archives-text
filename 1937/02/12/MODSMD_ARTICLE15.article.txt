# Hoop Destinies Of Farm Rest In L.A., Berkeley
## Stanford Basketeers Journey South For U.C.L.A. Tilt; Trojans To Joust with Bear Varsity 
### GORDY FROST 
On the hardwood floors of two great indoor stadia, Stanford's basketball
destinies rest this week-end.
Down in the Southland at L.A.'s Pan-Pacific Auditorium tonight and to
morrow night a physically perfect Stanford varsity is scheduled to make
merry with U.C.L.A.'s near-cellar hoopnien.

• At Berkeley, California's just-as
near-cellar outfit has a date with
the U.S.C. Trojan—the same U.S.C.
Trojan that stands tied with Stan
ford's Redshirts for the Southern
Division conference lead.
And both the Cal-U.C.L.A. tic with
standings of .167—and the Stanford-
U.S.C. deadlock at .733 are set for
setlement tonight and tomorrow
night.
Stanford Favored
At Los Angeles, dopemen give the
Bruin slight prayer against Bunn's
Luisettis, Moores, Stoefcns, Calder
woods and Turners. U.C.L.A. has
been quoted as saying it played its
best game against Stanford three
weeks ago in the Pavilion, and al
though El Bruin didn't look bad,
Stanford had little trouble in muss
ing him around the maple.
Unless Mr. Bunn's men have a dis
tinctly "off" night, or suffer a severe
psychological letdown, Stanford has
no reason for not mussing him
around twice more this week-end.
Bears Look Good
At Cal, things are slated to be less
one-sided. Bunn figures that the
Bears will take at least one, which is
entirely possible. And should that
happen, and should Stanford win
both, the Indian would move from
his deadlock into the lead.
Thus, unless the hoop prognostica
tors err, Stanford may find itself
heading the list Monday on the
strength of basketball play at: (1)
Los Angeles; (2) Berkeley.
