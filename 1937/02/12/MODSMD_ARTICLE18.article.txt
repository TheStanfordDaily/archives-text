# Bus Tears Down 'Billboard Elm'
## 
### 
Almost on the eve of the premiere
of "This Side Idolatry," a Mayfield
bus sheared off the Elm before the
University Post Office, bringing
down not only a campus landmai'k
j but the Dramatic Council's seat
| sale banner.
The accident occurred Wednesday,
| when the bus cut the corner too close
'and sheared the tree off. Meanwhile,
] ticket sales for the Elizabethan
drama have been continuing, sans
j sign and sans tree.
The P. G. & E. may install emer-
I gency posts, Dick Daugherty, dra
! matic manager declared. Mcan
| while, street banners are down and
nut
