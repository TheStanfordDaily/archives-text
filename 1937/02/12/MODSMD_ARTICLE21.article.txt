not nearly so fctod now as it was when
it first hit Eurcpe, or as it would be
though to be after listening to an En
cina bull session* We have devel
oped a measure <* r immunity, since
we all have a targe number of
syphilitic ancestors."
"Syphilis has had a romantic his
tory in more ways than one," said
Dr. Lee, explaining the part this
disease has played in the rise and I
fall of the nations of the world. He j
called the relatively "unsyphilized" j
condition of England during the sev
enteenth century one reason for the
English rise to power.

Not a method of keeping out of war
