Today Dr. de Niedman recalls the day early in 1864 when as a 10-year
old cadet in a youth organization of the Russian Imperial Navy he, with
Admiral Lysoffsky, visited President Abraham Lincoln at the White
House. As the Admiral discussed problems of the Civil War then in
progress, little Wladimir sat upon Lincoln's lap admiring the kindlv face of

' the Great Eman
i
cipator.
Indeed, emanci
pation was not at
ti'iat time a new
c-t ncept to young

parents had pio

sian-, serfs. Lin
coln's efforts to
free the American
Negro from bond

der to go

Frigate, Hartford.

man o' war under
the command of
Admiral Farragut

at the Battle' of Mobile Bay and wit
nessed the lowering of the stars and
bars at New Orleans.

Niedman continued with his educa
tion, graduating in botany from Dor
pat University. He later received a
degree in medicine from the Uni

versity of Edinburgh.
