# Papoose Five Prepared For Eleventh Win
## Auburn High Hoopsters To Furnish Opposition Here Tomorrow Night 
### 
There will be no excuse for not
seeing Stanford's frosh basketballers
play tomorrow night against Auburn
High because, starting at 7:30, the
game will be over in time for every
one to whip home to radios to hear
the game at Los Angeles.
The Papooses have been humping
hard under the direction of Genial
John and Pee-Wee Dale, preparing
to mark down their eleventh consec
utive win of the season. Tomorrow
night they will be without the help
of ace forward Leon Lafaille, who,
according to team doctor Northway,
definitely will not see action. Lafaille
is hobbling around with water on
the knee, sustained in last Saturday's
game with the U.S.F. frosh.
Auburn High, which is located,
according to Genial John, "in the
last town before you hit the moun
tains tin the road to Nevada," has a
real team. .This team, says Coach
Bunn, has the habit of cleaning up
in its league year after year. It is
coached by one Mr. Crabbe, late of
California.
Being coached by Mr. Crabbe of
California, it is only natural that
Auburn High should play like Cal.
That is, they play the same type of
fense and defense, using the merry
go-round as they come down the
floor, and falling into a set zone de
fense.
Starting line-up for the Papoose
quintet will be Lyon and Staehle as
forwards, Siebert as center, and An
derson and Rahn as the guards.
