# SIDELINE SLANTS

RAIN, slanting, dripping, mud
making, unnecessary rain, has butted
in enough times to make the base
ball season so far pretty much of a
farce.
The varsity team has been shunted
out of so many games that things are
beginning to bother. Three games
have been played this season, two of
them victories and one of them a de
feat. Now the fact that only three
games have been played would not
rankle so much, if only things would
start drying up a little so that the
rest of the season could go on in
terrupted.
But tomorrow there is supposed to
be the conference-opening game
with Santa Clara on the sunken dia
mond, and if it doesn't clear up by
then the situation will have reached
a horrible point. To start the league
season with only three games is in
itself quite uncomfortable, but when
the team is all set to start in spite of
the handicap of little competition,
and rain comes in once more .to halt
proceedings, that's carrying things
pretty far. Something ought to be
done, like putting a roof over the
field, maybe.
Perhaps it won't rain, though, and
then everything will be at least suit
able, if not rosy. Let me repeat my
urging of the other day—the team
will play 25 per cent better if there
is a crowd, a live, yelling crowd, in
the stands to give a little moral sup
port.
WHILE on baseball, here is a par
tial list of the batting averages of the
players for the three games played:
McGuire, center field, .000; Linde,
third base, .091; Tam, second base,
.111; Holman, first base, .113; Far
rell, shortstop, .106; Heagerty, catch
er, .333; Calvelli. right field, .500; La-
Franchi, left field, .500; and Weier
shauser, pitcher, 1.000.
TINY THORNIIILL has just got
back from the meeting of the Na
tional Football Rules Committee,
held in Detroit February 5 and 6.
with a little cold dope on the new
set-up of rules for the coming year.
The main aims formulated at the
meet were the clarification of the
rules so that Joe Fan can better un
derstand them, and the more com
plete definition of the rules so that
the burden of decision will not be so
heavy on the referee. —Peterson
