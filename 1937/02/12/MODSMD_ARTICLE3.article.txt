# Auto Strikers Win; Factions Compromise
## Workers Quit Factories After 44-day Lay-off; C.I.O. Loses Struggle 
### 
FLINT, Mich., Feb. 11 (UP). —Sit-
down strikers began leaving General
Motors plants tonight in conform
ance with the agreement reached be
tween the United Automobile Work
ers and General Motors Corporation
after a 44-day lay-off.
First to march out of the factories
held since December 30 were the
men at Fisher Body Plant No. 1.
General Motors agreed to recog
nize the United Automobile Work
ers as bargaining agent for all mem
bers of the union and to refrain for
six months from bargaining with
other employe groups in the 20
plants where strikes occurred; to use
no coercion against union members;
to start collective bargaining with
the union on February 16 and to re
sume operations in all plants as soon
as possible; to return all employes to
their regular work without discrim
ination or prejudice against strikers;
to drop legal proceedings against
sit-down strikers and union o'fficials
at Flint, Mich., and Cleveland.
Compromise Strike Issues
On the issues raised by the strike
there was a compromise. For six
months, John L. Lewis' union—the
United Automobile Workers — will
have sole bargaining rights in 20
plants where strikes occurred. In
return, it will remove all sit-down
strikers, and allow General Motors
to resume the production of automo
biles as soon as possible.
In the final settlement the union
obtained that right only for six
months in the 20 plants. In addition,
the corporation reserved the right to
bargain with other groups in those
20 plants after submitting such pro
posals to Governor Frank Murphy
and obtaining his approval. Thus
Lewis failed to achieve one of his
primary demands—the lo rep
resent all of General Motors' em
ployes in negotiations on wages,
hours, and working conditions.
