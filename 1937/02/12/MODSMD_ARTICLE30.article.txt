Long the cellar - keeper in the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association, Stanford has shown
glimmers this year of a possible rise
to the heights that once marked In
dian ball teams. Two of three games
have been won so far in this rain
soaked season, the one loss being a
tight 2-1 battle against the Pacific
Greyhound team Wednesday, when
the Cards outhit but also outfumbled
the transport company squad.
First victory of the year was scor
ed at the expense of San Jose State,
5-4, Santa Clara dropped a 5-3 game
to the same Spartans last Wednes
day, giving the Indians the edge on
comparative scores. The Broncs
tucked one in the war sack the day
before when they took the measure
of the San Jose All-Stars, 7-3.
