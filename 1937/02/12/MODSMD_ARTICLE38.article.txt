# The 						Men Who Laugh
## 
### 
STANFORD coaches have lately developed a
strange but happy faculty of turning ath
letics into laughletics.
And in so doing, they have taken some of the
bite out of the perennial argument "athletes are
athletes to drain the gravy out of athletics."
At any rate, someone once made the observa
tion that Stanford football and basketball play
ers could laugh, and did, even before and dur
ing crucial games. That was a news peg. So
since then, it has been "Thornhill's Laughing
Boys" and "Bunn's Laughing Boys," and any
one else's "Laughing Boys" —if the boys
laughed.
Stanford has received copious and highly
flattering publicity on this score, on the mere
fact that an athlete facing the Big Game could
still "bird" his teammates, joke with his coach,
and dissolve the deadpan with a hearty chuckle.
Who's responsible for this favorable reflec
tion on local sport attitude? In the main, credit
goes to two or three bigwigs of the Stanford
coaching staff who have recognized the value
of more fun and less work as essential ingre
dients in the moulding of successful teams.
Coach John Bunn is in the spotlight on such
score now, principally because his sport holds
the beam. To Bunn go orchids for injecting
ample quantities of "laughability" in a varsity
basketball team which tonight faces U.C.L.A.,
a team which should, with little difficulty, laugh
its way to the Southern Division championship
of the Pacific Conference.
Some credit Bunn's success to "natural" ma
terial, to Luisettis and the like. But be that as it
may, none will deny that it has been Bunn and
only Bunn who has instilled a quality which
migh tbe desired even over victory—the abil
ity to laugh.—G. F.
