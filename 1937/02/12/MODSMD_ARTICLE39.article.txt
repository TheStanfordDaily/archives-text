# Is It Basketball?

(From the Toronto "Varsity")
TO MEN, girls' basketball is perhaps one of
the biggest mysteries In sport. The idea of
six players each restricted in their play to an
area covering only three-quarters of the floor
has always been a source of hilarity and deri
sion to those acquainted in any way with men's
rules. And the attitude of these people, if not
particularly constructive, is nevertheless justi
fied.
It does seem rather inconsistent that the
modern girl, who is supposed to be man's equal
in every respect, should actually admit her in
ieriority by allowing one of the most popular
sports in which she participates to be ham
pered and impeded by stupid and archaic rules.
Probably years ago when women first started
taking part in athletics these rules were a ne
cessity, since the uniforms worn were very in
convenient and then, too, it was decidedly
unladylike to exert oneself to the extent of run
ning. However, both these reasons are now
obsolete and this being the case, the rules them
selves, since the "raison d'etre" has been re
moved, must follow a like procedure.
To say that the reason for retaining these
rules is that men's basketball is far too strenu
ous for women, is not facing the issue. If this
were the case, the same objection could be
raised to any other sport in which women par
ticipate, and we could expect a change in rules
in tennis, or hockey, which are every bit as
strenuous as the hoop-game.
If women's sports are to be recognized and
given the position they deserve, the women
themselves must cease this shilly-shallying and
hiding behind their own skirts to come out in
the open and either play the game the way it
should be played or not play it at all.
