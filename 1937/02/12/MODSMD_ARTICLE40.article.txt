JUST what advice can anyone give to help you
"get the most out of college"? Stanford's
ambitious new Luncheon Club imported a
young philosophy major named Monroe Drew
Iroin Borkoloy the olhor day to speak tu its

sandwich-eaters on "The Basic Problem of Stu
dent Life."
After passing off the answer to the mystery
of college as identical with the answer to the
mystery of Life, Mr. Drew pushed his way into
the realms of philosophy, dragging his audi
ence somewhat behind him.
"The key to Life," he said, "is one's reaction
to Death. Until you realize that life has no mean
ing without death, that your reaction to death
controls your every attitude and way of living,
you can formulate no organized and integrated
philosophy of life."
Fifty students at Cal, the speaker told the
club, were given a questionnaire that asked:
"Since you know that in 100 years you will be
dead, how do you react to this fact?" In each
reply, varying from 200 to 2000 words, Mr.
Drew declared he could tell exactly how the
writer looked at everything in life.
And the only channel through which a stu
dent can organize an adequate attitude toward
death, and subsequently life, he added, is for
mal spiritual and moral training.
When Mr. Drew asks us to sit down and ana
lyze in black and white our feelings toward
death, then base our life on this analysis—with
happiness and contentment the result —we
question him. Isn't it a little too easy to over
simplify life's multiplicities, to slip into that rut
which some call a "philosophy of life?"
Our friend from California has a point in see
ing the need for some "guiding star," some
yardstick of values, but life is too complex, too
dynamic to allow complete adjustment from a
static formula.
But one thing about Mr. Drew, it was refresh
ing to meet someone who sincerely felt he had
It all figured out. —D. B,
