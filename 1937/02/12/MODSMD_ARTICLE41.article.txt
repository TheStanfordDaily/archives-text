IT IS strange how institutions change. In the old days
when people drank because it was prohibited, it
became necessary to move the old Stanford Winery out
so that the cows could move in and give out. So a
drayman came along and proceeded to pack up the
utensils. On his wagon he put lots of bottles and sev
eral large vats, and started to move along the campus
streets.
As he cluck-clucked to his horses, though, he no
ticed that little girls and old men with white beards
stopped to stare at him and would slap their thighs
and guffaw and titter. So he looked back at his load and
saw painted on the vats in large, red letters: "The Zetes
are moving."
All that is changed now. Industrialization has mov
ed on at a rapid pace. The Zetes have become smoother,
combing their hair before they go to class, wearing tics
to various places, pledging guys from Piedmont, and
writing letters to Campus Opinion.
And now, just the other day, the first time the sun
came out in three months, the Zctc house spent the
golden, sun-shiny hours flying kites on Lagunita Knoll.
Just good, healthy fun in the sun. The Zetes are
moving.
Not only that, but last Sunday night over the KROW
all-request program a dynamic "Join the Zetes and Eat
Off Plates" publicity movement got under way.
This play by play account starts in innocently
enough, but notice how subtly the woman's angle
enters the picturc:
12:20 a.m. a record was dedicated to Mary at Cal
from Jack at Stanford.
12:35 a.m. to Jack "Red" Walton at Stanford from
the "Girl Who Came Out of the Desert."
12:50 a.m. to Jack 'Red" Walton and Jim Reynolds
at the Zcte house from the gals in Paly. The title of
the record was 'Here's Mud in Your Eye."
12:55 a.m. to Jack "Red" Walton at the Zeta Psi
house, Stanford. The title was: "To You Sweetheart,
Aloha."
This concludes the evening's performance. The
Zetes are moving.
