# BULL SESSION
## SWING, MR. SHAKESPEARE 
### 
r | I ONIGHT at 8:15 the tattered curtains in the as
sembly hall will flow back and you will see Chris
Marlowe writing away for all he's worth. There will be
a lot of noise outside and Playwright Bob Greene,
drunk and cowering, will fall into the room, followed by
a fetching slattern shouting for her pay. Together the
three persons will argue, barter, and talk.
Then suddenly there will be a rap on the door, and
Marlowe will ask who is there. The answer will come
out across the footlights, electrically, bounce off the
back walls and give you a crack that should jar you
right out of your seats.
"Will Shakespeare."
♦ * # #
The door will open and William Shakespeare will
walk across the creaking boards, not reincarnated, not
wearing halos for bracelets.
He will not appear as the English department would
like him to appear, blessed and canonized by four cen
turies of breathless adoration, but rather as Will
Shakespeare, school-master, Jiorsc-holder, and farm
hand, model 1575.
Maybe you won't see Mr. Shakespeare as you would
like to see him, but what you will see is a man, full
bodied, full-spirited, swallowing life to its lees. In
short, you'll see Shakespeare as he was, an artist that
drank, loved, and wrote. An ordinary man who wrote
words, even as you and I.
,#* * *
lie will not be a clear-thinking genius with jeweled
metaphors falling out of his mouth every time he opens
it, but rather he will be a man lost in the maze of
his own intellect, doubtful, wondering what it is all
about. He will steal plots openly and admit it.
He will scratch his head, bite his nails, try desper
ately to make one iambic join sensibly with the next.
He will work like you never saw anyone work be
fore and it will not be for art's sake but for money:
For one anyway, he will be a human being.
