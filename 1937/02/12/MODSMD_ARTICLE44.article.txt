YOU ALL KNOW about the Doug- !
las plane that dove into the Bay
last Tuesday evening, but what you
probably don't know is that there,
are two of the eye-witnesses here on |
the campus, PETER lIAAS and
ROBERT WELCH.
It was near San Mateo that Welch
saw the ship. Spitting brilliant
shoots of flame from its engines the'
plane attracted his attention, and he
mentioned the peculiarity of the sit- j
uation to Helen Taylor, of the Alpha j
Phi house, who was with him.
Not five minutes later Haas came,
by the field, and already there were'
spectators watching fire engines, am- :
bulances, and men hurrying onto the!
field for the rescue. Neither Haas;
nor Welch saw the actual dive into |
the bay, but Welch was certainly one j
of the last persons to see the plane
in one piece.

SPEAKING OF COINCIDENCE, 1
here's one for the books!
JOHN IGLAUER, a junior from
Ohio, drives a Plymouth convertible!
coupe on the campus. On that coupe j
he has a license. On that license he
has some numbers and letters. They 1
read: SU-38. You know — Stanford |
University, Class of '38. John can j
have this same number for the rest;
of his life, if he so desires.

I WONDER if it's just coincidence |
that JACK TRACY, Theta Chi, and;
TOM BROOKS Chi Psi, recently
bought engagement rings from Art
Azevedo? Or could there be some
definite plans for the hitching post?

I MAY NOT KNOW that you or
your friend has something interest- ]
