# Popularity Of Hitler Waning
## Nazi Censorship Blights Germanyâ€”Kaulfers 
### 
''Apathy toward the Hitler regime <
is evidenced by a good percentage of i
the German people," Professor VVal- I
tcr V. Kaulfers, of the School of
Education, told the local chapter of j
the American Student Union last
night.
Speaking on the topic of "Germany \
Under Hitler," Professor Kaulkcrs j
reported that "the manifestation of
popular unrest is strong among stu- I
dents in the universities." He found
that "the real philosophy of Naziisni
is in effect in the schools. As a re- !
suit, less than 10 per cent of the stu- j
dents get a liberal education."
Propaganda Obvious
"The immense amount of obvious j
propaganda in Germany," Kaulfers;
said, "shows that all is not well. The
effect is that the people don't know j
anything about their own country t
except the scenery, and that they are I
entirely unaware of what really
goes on in the rest of the world."
In concluding, Kaulfers expressed
the hope that "through our demo
cratic system America can provide a j
better answer than has the Hitler;
regime."
