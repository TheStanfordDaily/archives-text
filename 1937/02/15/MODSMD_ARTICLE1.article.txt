# Rains at L.A. Drive 400 From Homes
## Residents Evacuated By Red Cross Workers; Slide Blocks Highway 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 (UP).â€”
Afternoon rains in the Los Angeles
area and southward from here, sent
flood waters rushing anew over
thousands of fertile acres and drove
an estimated 400 persons from their
city and rural homes, according to
reports from the American Red
Cross and other official sources.
North of Santa Monica, the
Roosevelt highway was blocked by
a huge slide two miles above To
pango canyon. Telephone lines
were carried out by the downhill
rush of soggy tons of earth, and
teletype communication on the
sheriff's office wires was broken.
At Long Beach, Red Cross work
ers late today were evacuating resi
dents from flooded homes in Ha
waiian Gardens and in the neighbor
hood of State Street and Alamitos.
Scores were believed to have been
driven out and some were being
given shelter in the Long Beach
armory.
In Venice, a seaside resort to the
west, 150 were reported to have
aahndoncd their homes, most of
them being rescued by Red Cross
workers, sheriff's deputies and
police.
The Beverly Hills section of Los
Angeles, which houses a large mo
tion picture colony, was having its
troubles, too. There a number of
cellars were said to be flooded as the
rain waters tore down the boule
vards from the hills.
Bayshore Camp, at Newport Bay,
just ofl (he Coast highway running
southward to San Diego, was a
heavy sufferer. Torrents pouring
down on the camp from the hills
cut big ravines through the camp
ground and toppled over a number
of cottages.
