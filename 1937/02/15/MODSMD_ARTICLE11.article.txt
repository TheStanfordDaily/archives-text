# Juniors Plan Class Banquet
## Dinner Set for March 3; Jolly-up Eliminated 
### 
Tentative plans for a junior class
dinner to replace the traditional jun
ior jolly-up this year and to set a
precedent for succeeding classes
were laid at a recent meeting of the
class committee.
So much unfavorable comment
against a class jolly-up has been
voiced, according to Tom Killefer,
junior president, that it seemed ad
visable to try a new experiment. The
dinner will probably be held on
Wednesday, March 3, from 5:30 to 8
o'clock in the Women's Gym. The
Palace Hotel orchestra may play
during the dinner with such junior
"Gaieties" stars as Shirley Jones and
Ernie Heckscher entertaining.
Cost will be only 25 cents a plate,
with the remainder of the money
being taken from the class treasury.
Members of the junior class com
mittee which met to discuss the din
ner are Tom Killefer, Peg Woodard,
Isabel Goldthwaite, Margaret Loud,
Jim Ransohoff, and Jack Galder
wood.
