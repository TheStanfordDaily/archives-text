# Manufacture of Bacon Starts Bull on Farm
## Zetes Beef As Piggie Goes To Market 
### 
The bcautv *>f Stanford's flowers
may be open to question, but their
caloric value seems a proven fact.
Evidence is the tragic story of the
l Zete pig, which though full of pathos
| stands in testimonial to the nutri
j ment of California flora.
It seems that once upon a time,
Russell Rassmussen of the Sigma
Nu clan found himself involved in
a bet to the effect that there was
such a pig as the China pig. When
| the smoke cleared away, Rassmussen
I found that in winning his wager he
j had become the owner of a young
| China pig. With Napoleonic genius
I he staged a raffle, and the title to
our hero, Little-Bacon-on-the-Hoof,
i passed into the hands of Tanner
j Wilson, Zeta Psi.
Not at all heartbroken by being
i thus sold down the river, the piglet
lived happily in and about the Zete

yard and waxed fat. He exhibited,
however, a true Oriental love of
Powers, a commendable trait, ex
cept that he liked to take beauty in
ternally, and also displayed a burn
ing desire to get at the root of things.
Complaints became bitter, and Row
Cassandras predicted that his would
bo the snout that launched a thop
sand ships.
Up to this point, the tale is clear
and indisputable, but here rumor
joins hands with fact. It is said that
last Thursday night, some bums
made an attempt to abduct the pig.
Little Bacon objected lustily, and
the kidnappers—starving Encina in
mates, it is hinted—released him.
Complaints multiplied like a slide
rule, and convicted on two counts,
flower eating and noise maKlng, pig
gie was shut up in death row at the
Liddicoat Bros, slaughter house.

I Saturday lie Walked the last mile,
and according to some, the bacon of
his soul is now in Satan's frying pan.
But the word goes about the campus
that the piglet was railroaded, that
his owner did not authorize his de
struction, that dirty work and double
cross lie behind the brief statement,
I iThis little piggic went to the
slaughter house." It is whispered
that suits are impending, that pro
pig is ranged against anti-pig in the
Zete house.
But railroaded or not, the pig
gained one benefit from the flowers
which lured him to his doom: they
endowed him with extraordinary
fairness. TTie executioner at the
slaughter house said that he had
never seen such a fine pig, and the
mortal shell sold at a good price.
Stanford gardeners need not feel
self-conscious. We like their flow
ers too.

Evidence is the tragic story of the

It seems that once upon a time,
Russell Rassmussen of the Sigma
Nu clan found himself involved in
a bet to the effect that there was
such a pig as the China pig. When
| the smoke cleared away, Rassmussen
I found that in winning his wager he
j had become the owner of a young
| China pig. With Napoleonic genius
I he staged a raffle, and the title to
our hero, Little-Bacon-on-the-Hoof,
i passed into the hands of Tanner
j Wilson, Zeta Psi.
Not at all heartbroken by being
i thus sold down the river, the piglet
lived happily in and about the Zete

yard and waxed fat. He exhibited,
however, a true Oriental love of
Powers, a commendable trait, ex
cept that he liked to take beauty in
ternally, and also displayed a burn
ing desire to get at the root of things.
Complaints became bitter, and Row
Cassandras predicted that his would
bo the snout that launched a thop
sand ships.
Up to this point, the tale is clear
and indisputable, but here rumor
joins hands with fact. It is said that
last Thursday night, some bums
made an attempt to abduct the pig.
Little Bacon objected lustily, and
the kidnappers—starving Encina in
mates, it is hinted—released him.
Complaints multiplied like a slide
rule, and convicted on two counts,
flower eating and noise maKlng, pig
gie was shut up in death row at the
Liddicoat Bros, slaughter house.

I Saturday lie Walked the last mile,
and according to some, the bacon of
his soul is now in Satan's frying pan.
But the word goes about the campus
that the piglet was railroaded, that
his owner did not authorize his de
struction, that dirty work and double
cross lie behind the brief statement,
I iThis little piggic went to the
slaughter house." It is whispered
that suits are impending, that pro
pig is ranged against anti-pig in the
Zete house.
But railroaded or not, the pig
gained one benefit from the flowers
which lured him to his doom: they
endowed him with extraordinary
fairness. TTie executioner at the
slaughter house said that he had
never seen such a fine pig, and the
mortal shell sold at a good price.
