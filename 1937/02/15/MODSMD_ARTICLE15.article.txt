# Indians Win Twice, Take League Lead
## Trojans Split Pair With Bears; Luisetti Breaks Hoop Scoring Record 
### GORDY FROST 
Stanford: two victories plus a
scare.
U.S.C.: one scare plus a loss.
So it is that Stanford's Redshirt
basketball experts swept into th/;
Southern Division conference lead
last week-end by dropping Ucla's
Bruin twice in Los Angeles 42-40
and 67-38 while California and
U.S.C. split their pair at Berkeley.
Friday's prognosticators hit the
week-end's results on the nose.
Cards Point for Cal
So it is too, that Stanford goes
back to work today ot protect that
division lead against an ambitious
Bear next Friday night at Berkeley,
a Bear who defeated Stanford's one
time partner in the conference lead
Saturday night, and came pathetical
ly close to doing the same Friday.
And so it is, that as the result of
the usual 20-point per game week
end, Angelo Luisetti became Nation
al Collegiate Scoring champion with
a total of 652 for his Stanford ca
reer, eclipsing the seven-year-old

record of Bob Many of Lehigh, who
totaled 632.
First Game Is Close
So it is that Stanford passed a
highly successful basketball week
end.
But Friday evening about 9:15
Stanford was not so sure that its
week-end would please. Lanky John
Ball of U.C.L.A. leading a ball
hawking Bruin five, slowed down the
Redshirts' fast break, and succeeded
in scaring the Indian a-plenty.
Holding a one-point lead at the half,
17-16, Hank and the boys applied
the pressure early in the second pe
riod run up a neat lead. But in the
closing minutes Ball couldn't miss
and Stanford couldn't hit. Result:
Stanford wins by two points; neat
but not gaudy.
Next night, just as mad as they
were after the U.S.C. loss, Stanford
would have no fiddling around. Un
til the half Bunn's boys stood 21-12.
Then came the rush and they rang
the bucket often—enough to score
46 points in the second half alonr.
It would appear that Stanford need?
its periodic scare.
