No longer will Irving Lunt canoe
on Lake Lagunita where he delights
in frightening Roble women.
Tuesday afternoon Meta Rinder
and Suzanne Hyman were paddling
about in the Roble canoe when they
were alarmed by Lunt's circling
around their craft in a threatening
manner. They called to Don Gill in
a neighboring canoe for help.
Both men landed on the far shore
of the lake to settle the matter. Lunt
struck Gill with his paddle. Fighting,
both men rolled into the water.
Misses Rinder and Hyman started
to paddle back to the boat house,
but Lunt gave chase. Just as they
neared the shore he overturned their
canoe and spilled the ladies into the
icy water. Bob Hoover, life guard,
came to the rescue of the ladies and
cancelled Lunt's privileges of boat
ing and swimming in Lagunita for
ever.
