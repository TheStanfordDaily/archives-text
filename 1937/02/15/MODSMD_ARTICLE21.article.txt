# Frost Donation to Bring Forest To Farm's Amphitheater Project
## 200 Large Trees Will Surround New Bowl This is the first of a series of articles giving a "plant-by-plant" description of Stanford's new amphitheater.â€”The Editor

Two hundred large trees, several
thousand small ones will be brought
from all over the West to transform
Stanford's rapidly progressing am
phitheater into a veritable forest
within a few months.
This planting program, one of the
most elaborate ever undertaken, is
made possible through the $35,000
gilt of Howard Frost of Los Angeles.
Memorial Gift
Mr. Frost presented the gift to
Stanford, specifically to cover plant
ing costs in its proposed amphithea
ter, in memory of his son, John Law
rence Frost, who died suddenly in
the summer of '35 while traveling
with his parents in Italy.
The Stanford chapter of Alpha
Kappa Lambda fraternity, of which
the boy was a member, recently
elected Mr. Frost to honorary mem
bership. John Frost would have
graduated with the class of '36.
Variety of Trees
Numerous places in the Pacific
Coast area, from Santa Barbara to
Portland, will contribute the variety
of trees which will cover the rim
and outer slopes of the earth bowl.
A number of trees will be scattered
along the inside slopes and on the
floor of the structure in an unsys
tematic manner, to create the im
pression of a natural forest park.
Various parts of the campus have
contributed some of the best speci
mens which will be used, especially
among the live oaks and laurels.
Will Collect Oaks
Many varieties of oak trees from
the East, the South, and the North
will be brought together, probably
for the first time anywhere.
On the level ground outside the
bowl hundreds of evergreens will
be planted, making the whole block
into a forest and excluding any view
of the amphitheater from the street.
