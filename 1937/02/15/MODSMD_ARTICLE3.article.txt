# Gasoline and Alcohol Do Mix
## EDITORIAL 
### 
A HIGHWAY BAR. not unlike those sometimes patronized by Stanford students. Below, a curve in the
road leading to the Devonshire Country Club, scene of an unofficial dance heavily attended by Stanford
students Friday night.

AT STANFORD we officially live by a
phrase: gasoline and alcohol do not
mix.
But gasoline and alcohol do mix. At Stan
ford, without gasoline we can't get alcohol.
And we do get alcohol, as what group of
4000 college students doesn't.
If Stanford could be intelligent without
considering public reaction, it could install
a bar in the Union Cellar to avoid the trouble
and danger of mixing alky and gas.
But Stanford cannot ignore public opinion.
A nation of 125,000,000 would cry shame and
wreak ruin on the University if it spon
sored safe and sane supervised drinking as
the only logical alternative to the dangerous
drinking-driving compound.
Instead Stanford, like most universities,
has to don administrative horse-blinds, tell
us that gasoline and alcohol do not mix, and
plead with us to "stay on the campus," and
"have your fun here."
It cannot or will not face the fact
that Stanford students will continue to
drink and drive off-campus (like students
of most U.S. universities) until the Admin
istration permits us to do thinqs on cam
pus commensurate in entertainment value
with a drink and a city or highway night
?pof.
Students will, in short. continue to ar
range dances at the Devonshire Country
Club on closed dates such as that Friday
night and without Administrative approval
until the University v/ill permit us to fight
off-campus lure with campus lure.
It has chosen to do otherwise. Time and
again it has expressed disapproval of the
very things that will "keep the kids off the
Bayshore." Apparently on direct Adminis

trative suggestion, Ex Committee has dinged
the King-Queen contest, and with it the
glamour of the Masque Ball.
The appearance here of Jimmy Dorsey's
orqhestra at last year's Junior Prom was
greeted with stern glances and clipped
words.
Now there is no question that the King-
Queen contest resulted in a display of social
viciousness. There is no question that S9OO
for a "name band" imposes a disproportion
ate burden on the student pocketbook.
But there is also no question that the
Masque Ball and last year's Junior Prom kept
the students on the campus and off the
Bayshore for two nights.
And as such they had a definite value to
Stanford-as-a-school-for-students, although
they militated against the reputation of Stan
ford-the-University.
It may be a hard pill to swallow, but the
swanky, the costly and the socially vicious
have an eternal appeal, and one strong
enough to compete with the appeal of
city night spots.
Without them, the focus of Stanford's so
cial life will inevitably be off-campus, par
ticularly for those students unfortunately
gifted with too much money.
Without them. Administrative pleas to
stay on the campus will be futile whispers
among a social hurricane. Without them,
dances such as that at the Devonshire Coun
try Club Friday are not only inevitable, but
the only release for social inclinations that
may be deplorable, but are in existence.
They cannot be talked away, closed date
or no closed date, Women's Conference or
no Women's Conference, Administration cr
no Administration.
