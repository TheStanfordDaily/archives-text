# SIDELINE SLANTS

### 
Before John Bunn took his team
south for the two U.C.L.A. games
Thursday night, he said that Califor
nia should take at least one game
from U.S.C. at Berkeley. At the same
time, he figured that the Cards
should win both from the Bruins,
lie was right both times, the
Hears and Trojans split ami Stan
ford won two in spite of Long John
Ball, and now the Big Red Five is
in complete charge of the confer
ence race. Seven wins in eight con
ference games give the Indians a
percentage of .X7!>. while U.S.C. has
now won six ol eight and is hold
ing lip a wobbly .750.
The Bruins now can have the
whole cellar floor to play marbles
on, since they lost two this stanza
and Cal pulled through with a win.
It's all very jolly, will be much jol
lier when Stanford meets the Bears
over in Bahk'lev come Friday. The
Price-coached squad will be trying
harder than at any other time this
year to win this Stanford game—if
the Cards win it means the first se
ries since 1921, plus the fact that the
Bears could pull themselves up and
the Indians down by winning.

GENIAL JOHN
CALLS HIS SHOTS

BUT HANK. IT
CAN'T Ki; HELPED

Hank Luisetti has been begging
every news dispenser, including
(he Daily, heh heh, to quit giving
him so much publicity and let
some of the other players in on
the l>ig play. It's agreed that it
slill takes five men to make a bas
ketball team, and when the live
are as good as the first string at
Stanford this year, each individual
becomes less and less integral in
the machine.
However, in spite of the fact that
Luisetti is surrounded by four
really great team members, he still
shines out. He's the greatest of the
greats in basketball —you can't help
giving him publicity.
And now that lie has set a new
national collegiate scoring record
of 652 points in less than two sea
sons that betters by 20 points the
former three-year record held by
Many of Lehigh, he can't stay out
of the news.
It won't do him any good to quit
scoring, either, because then the pa
pers will be full of the "great Lui
setti collapse."
When Jesse Owens came West
two years ago and swept through the
N.C.A.A. like a tornado, toying with
every sprinter that raced him, I
heard it said, "When a better man
than Owens comes along, I want to
see him run, too." The same fits the
lank, raven-haired Luisetti like a
glove. When a better basketball
player than he shows up, I'm going
to see him.
