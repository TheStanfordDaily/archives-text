# Frosh Keep Hoop Record Win Snail's Pace Game
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Playing at a snail's pace. Stanford's
P;ipooses beat Auburn High Satur
day night, 20-22, to chalk up their
eleventh consecutive win of the 1937
basketball season.
Only three things prevented the
crowd from dropping off to sleep.
(1) Auburn's shooting, which took
place from way out on the floor,
nearly all of the high school's shots
being 35-footers, arched to the
rafters; (2) The sensational drib
bling of Triano, pint-size Auburn
guard, who, short as he was, never
theless seemed to be dribbling tin his
knees; and (3) Cheers for Auburn,
led by their team's manager, and
yelled by the substitutes, coaches,
and entourage.
The game, which was played in
quarters, was Stanford's all the way,
but not by very much. Tlie first pe
riod ended with the score 3-2 in
favor of the Papoose quintet. Half
time saw the frosh still in front, 11-9,
by virtue of Siebert's two buckets,
and Lyon's free throw and two

buckets.
In the third quarter, the yearlings
went to work, marking up 13 points
while Auburn scored eight. The dif
ference came because of Stanford's
fast breaks, which finally began
clicking. The frosh slowed down
again in the last period, playing an
cxr.ct duplicate of (he first.
Ted Lyon nabbed high-point hon
ors for (he Papooses with 12 points,
while Warwick and Triano of Au
burn split for lop score with six
digits apiece.
