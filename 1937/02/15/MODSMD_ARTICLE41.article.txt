# He Leaves a Perfect Vase
## 
### 
A LUMP of colored glass —an expert puff on
the blowing tube —a deft twist —a master
ful turn: a delicate vase for a friend.
Professor Emeritus of Chemistry, Dr. Edward
Curtis Franklin, who passed away Saturday,
lived his life not unlike he blew his glass.
Born in a little Kansas town in 1862, he early
felt the call of a scientific mind, acquired a
microscope, a printing press, even built a
telegraph line to a friend's house. He wanted
to learn.
Those were his lumps of glass.
First to University of Kansas, then Johns
Hopkins, finally to University of Berlin to study
under August Wilhelm von Hofman, famed
organic chemist. Back to Kansas to teach, and
then to Stanford in 1903 as professor of organic
chemistry.
The puffs that started his vase.
Twenty-three years of faithful professorship
-in the Chem department here, years during
which he was invited to almost every American
and foreign scientific society, years during
which he was recipient of many honors and
degrees, during which he became known as
international authority on liquid air and ammo
nia. For two things Dr. Franklin was admired
most: his ammonia compounds and his sense
of humor.
He loved the outdoors, enjoyed pounding
the roads behind Stanford, delighted in telling
tales of his college adventures exploring wild
country in Colorado with a lad named William
Allen White and another Bryan Kellogg who
have since risen with him to fame.
Thirty-four years he spent in the same office
in the Chem Building molding the masterful
lines of his product.
Last week-end Dr. Franklin finished his job,
and left with Stanford and the scientific world
a memory of his life as fully rounded as the
finished vase.—G. F.

Japan grows more Occidental. A 16-year
old girl stuck up a Tokyo bank. But the coun
try still keeps certain Oriental traits. The
law caught the girl.
