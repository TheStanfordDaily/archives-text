# The
						Music Was Fine, But...

•"PHIS Side Idolaters groaned last week-end
X when they looked at their programs to learn
that haloed Mr. Lange's peek at unhaloed Mr.
Shakespeare was to be colored with "incidental
music" by the Palo Alto High School symphony
orchestra.
With a lift of an eyebrow they glanced to
the left balcony, saw a bunch of youngsters
with violins and things under their chins. Mem
ories of high school days when every class
play was made more unbearable by the "sym
phony orchestra" clouded any anticipation of
an enjoyable evening.
After the overture, however, the audience
groan was gone. The Palo Alto players were
not just high school "musicians" mutilating the
classics through horn-rimmed glasses. They
handled the "incidental music" more than ade
quately—they were splendid.
To their director—Mr. Carol M. Haeske—
should go most credit for adding delightful be
tween-the-scenes music to a delightful play.
Before he volunteered his young orchestra,
there had been no music planned for "Idolatry."
But good as the Palo Alto orchestra happened
to be, the fact remains that Stanford should not
have to rely on a near-by high school for its
symphony talent. The Farm has in the past
had its own symphony. Where was it Friday
and Saturday nights?
The last appearance Stanford's symphony
made on the Farm was almost a year ago, di
rected by a San Franciscan who divided his

time between the campus and activities in the
City. The arrangement was unsatisfactory. The
orchestra failed to reorganize last fall.
Mr. Raymond Kendall, music department
maestro, said yesterday that before February's
winds stop blowing Stanford would again have
its own Symphony orchestra, organized this
time under a director who can make it into
something worth while.
Thank you again, Mr. Haeske. But we hope
to have our own bunch next time.— D. B.

No formal education in a world like that
of today can possibly be adequate to last its
owner through life.—Dr. Henry W. Chase,
chancellor of New York University
