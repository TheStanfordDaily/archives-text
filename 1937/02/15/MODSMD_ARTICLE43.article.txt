ASA RESULT of the accusatiori made by Our Hasher
last. Friday that the Zetes arc combing their hair and
going to classes, a thorough housecleaning is under way
in the House of Seven Gables (though only one of them
is named Clark). The spirit of revulsion undoubtedly
will lead to a blood purge, as the house administration
tnreatens to take away all the guy's razors (particularly
the sissy electric type) and enforce a rule making it un
lawful to shave more than once a week. Pretty soon we
may expect to see bonfires dotting Lagunita Knoll as
herringbone, gabardine, bi-swings, and checkei'ed shirts
are thrown on the flame. An administrative fiat is ex
pected at any moment saying that all slacks must go and
that Zetes are required to wear pants again.
Excitedly declaiming and gesticulating, the Zetes
maintain, as they grab handfuls of hair off their chests,
that it is a damnable lie that Zeta Psi is going smooth.
In proof of this they cite the well known fact that the
house has been on social pro for the past 18 years.
The Zeta Psi premise is immeasurably weakened,
though, by several insidious facts that have crept into
the rebuttal. In the first place, one of the last ties with
the old days was removed last year when the Zetes made
over their house, soundproofing some of the walls so that
some Zetes couldn't hear other Zetes, and the still in
the rear bathroom which used to provide an ample sup
ply of pre-war home brew for the Zete house meetings
was jerked out by the roots.
Now comes the final blow, the Zetes have slaughtered
their pet pig, because of complaints of neighbors. It
seems that the pig made a nuisance of itself by eating
up the posies in Kingscote gardens and in Comptroller
Roth's flower patch. To me, this looks like a definite
retrogression. The old timers around here can remem
ber the days when all Zetes were engineering majors,
when they all wore hobnailed boots and stinking cords,
and chewed up the flowers at Kingscote and Roth's
themselves.
