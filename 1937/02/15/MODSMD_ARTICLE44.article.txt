WIXTH DAY of the Chi O hashers' Sit-down and
k Shut-up Strike found the hashers still out (with
no limbs handy). Instances of scabbing were reported
over the week-end as one hasher went out in the rain
and tried to help start a Chi O car, while another one
was caught red-handed bumming cigarettes from one
of the girls.
Meanwhile, the Strikers' Intelligence Bureau has
issued the results of an exhaustive survey of vice con
ditions up the Row. Shocking conditions were found
in several houses, where hashers were treated as hu
man beings. Jim Crow laws pi'evail as instances of
true Americanism in other houses, and girls who speak
to hashers are lynched or subject to mob violence.
This alphabetical table gives a handy, thumbnail
reference for campus sociologists,
Alpha () house: Apparently strictest on the campus.
No talking, no communicating, no dating. Contact with
hashers seems to be on the Castilleja level.
Alpha Phi: There is a certain warmth in the friend
ship between hashers and hashed.
Chi O: Sit down and shut up.
Tri-Delt: The girls speak to the hashers and sneak
out into the kitchen to talk when the housemother isn't
looking.
Delta Gamma: There is a 25-cent fine for speaking
to hashers in the dining room, four bits for the kitchen.
Not enforced, however.
Gamma Phi: Triolo used to hash here. The hashers
are looked upon as scholars and gentlemen.
Thetas: The Thetas arc very nice to their hashers.
Kappas: It is said that the Kappas speak to the
hashers during meals and even can be seen talking to
them, in the kitchen in isolated instances. Kappas say
they look upon their hashers as equals.
Pi Pli is: At the risk of shocking all my readers, I
include this item from the Intelligence Bureau. It
seems that the Pi Phis think that the hashers are hu
man. Not only that but they are even friendly with
them. If everyone will please hold his breath, I will
repeat an entirely unfounded rumor that sometimes Pi
Phis have been seen dancing with hashers in uniform.
It also is alleged that Pi Phis v/ill come out in the
kitchen and listen lo the radio that the hashers and the
Chinese cook have installed. And on rushed nights
they will even help with glasses.

And Our Hasher thinks that the Pi Phis are human
