# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
is the day we give audiences away with a
half a pound of tea.
Saturday night the typical Stanford audience gave
one of the worst performances of its unemotional
career.
Principally because it did nothing.
For that reason the audience was a standout in the
history of Stanford dramatics.
Friday night, impressed by "American Premiere"
placards and other pre-performance publiicty, Stan
ford's many went to see Stanford's few put on 'This Side
Idolatry" and was dumbfounded; not the show
was sensational, not because the actors were excellent,
but rather because it enjoyed itself. When the last
curtain was rung down, the many went home feeling
that for one night at least, they had lived history.
Saturday night, however, forewarned and fore
armed, the audience had adopted a negative attitude, a
"you gotta show me" defense that refused to be pene
trated. Instead of co-operating, they refused to be
shown. The curtain down, plaudits and orchids had
little efTect in rejuvenating jaded actor's nerves.
Sitting behind the scenes and watching the actors at
close quarters, you knew exactly what. Phil Brown
and crew were up against. The terrible blank coldness
that welled up from the pit stifled emotions and left
the performers in a murky void that no imaginational
processes could dispel. Laughter lines got no laughs.
Serious lines pulled forth no serious thoughts. The
actors were unhappy, the audience was unhappy. No
one had a good time.
The audience ought to be ashamed of itself.
Friday night the play was art. Saturday night it was
just too bad.
I hope the east party was a success.
