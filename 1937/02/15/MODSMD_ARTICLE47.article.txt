Daily Scoops Examiner
Oh Boy, scoop that old Examiner
at any cost. Eleven dead not found
yet. What if they find one living?
Gotta scoop the Examiner anyway.
Gotta get back at that blackhearted
hearst. Monkeygiands hearst. Throw
in the Bull Session. Mix up the de
veloper. Mix up the fixer. Throw in
Our Hasher.
LOOK UP ALL NAMES IN
BAWLOUT
camera eye.
As I was saying to my sister Nellie
only the other day. why doesn't this
tooslangy volume 91 fold up and go
into receivership. Why dosen't, I
said to Nellie, this volume 91 tell
Wickett to go to with all his griping.
Too much slang. Not enuf news. Go
to, Wicket. Letter too long.
PIANIST GIVEN BIG OVATION
AFTER CONCERT
Might as well use that head. Good
and streotyped. Why doesn't vol
ume 91 tell Stanford boors to act
like gentlemen at a concert. Nope.
Too busy writing about exposition
hearstnitery. Who dug up Nitery
and who buried it? $$10,000$$ $$Ex
Committeess $$Fontiusss $$Rothss
HALL MEN SWEEP ELECTIONS
Row men still biting backs. Elect
a bunch of heels. Sure. Keep up
the tradition. Throw out Bull Ses
sion. Back to the camera harper.
Back to the camera eisenbach. Vol
ume 91 overdeveloped.
