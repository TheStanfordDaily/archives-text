# THINGS ARE BAD EVERYWHERE

The Editor, Sir:
"There will be a million and a half
new cases of syphilis this year—" So
prophesied Dr. Russell Lee in his
lecture to Current Events class
Thursday. Behind his lecture lies
the current campaign to bring ve
nereal diseases into the open.
The objective of this drive — to
eradicate venereal disease —is very
admirable, but is the method they
are using as admirable?
Will a campaign based on fear
succeed? Couldn't the reformers
bring this problem into the open with
less doleful forecasts? Wouldn't it
be better to present the program
with less fear and more hope?
A certain law school tells its stu
dents on their first class day, ''One of
every three of you won't be here
next year." And the venearel
disease campaigners say, "One out
of every ten of you has, or will have
syphilis." What a prospect!
To some, such a prophecy will
To some, such a prophecy will in
spire co-operation, to many, fear.
Fear may not bring on disease, but
it certainly does have the psycho
logical effect of heightening the sus
ceptibility and suggestibility of dis
ease.
By all means, let's all work elim
inate this scourge, but let's do it
with hope and courage, not with fear.
I do not mean to say that Dr.
Lee's lecture was not anything but
excellent. It was frank, sensible,
and confident. But, Dr. Lee, don't
you think the slogan, "Come in, we
can heal you," is much better than,
"One out of ten have it."
Sincerely,
J. H.

The memory and conscience neve
did, nor ever will, agree about for
giving injuries.—Lord Halifax.
