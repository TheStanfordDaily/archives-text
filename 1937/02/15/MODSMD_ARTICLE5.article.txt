# Skilled Acting Makes 'Idolatry' Outstanding
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
When the curtain descended for!
the last time on Dramatic Council's'
production of Talbot Je/inings' "This
Side Idolatry" Saturday night, it 1
marked the completion of the most
successful dramatic production to i
be presented at Stanford in many ,
a day, and sent its audience home i
with an impression marred by only I
two things — occasional miscasting, |
and the weakness of the play itself. I
Phil Brown's Will Shakespeare de- ■
veloped commanding stature after a J
hesitant beginning, despite the fact !
that his main task was to spout iam- |
bic pentameter and a philosophy ol ;
life remote from reality. Mr. Brown |
speaks clearly and distinctly, he (
grows old gracefully. If his portrait
was a little too mild, if it never 1
quite became unselfconscious, that j
may be laid at the author's door
rather than at the actor's. It was a
solid piece of work, a polished han
dling of a difficult role.
Women Perform Ably
Onyet Watson somehow failed to
impress as Mary Fitton, the "dark
woman" whom Mr. Jennings de
picts as being, with the box-office,
one of the two great inspirations in
the poet's life. More clearly con
ceived and twice as sincere was Vir
ginia Rogers' homely Anne Shake
speake, neglected and unloved but
still faithful.
Jane Clary played Bankside Kate
with what can only be described as
zest, and Kessing Moloney, brief as
was her appearance as the Flower
Girl, made a decided impression.
Best performance in the entire

cast was given by George Wood as !
Dick Burbage. Voice, carriage, ap- ;
pearanee, and technique all corn- j
bined to make a completely con- ;
vincing portrait ol Shakespeare's j
life-long friend. If the adjective]
"professional" had not outlived its
significance as applied to amateur i
productions, one might say that Mr. I
Wood's characterization was just j
that. Completely assured, he domi- I
nated the stage, and when he re- !
cited Shakespeare it was Shake- j
speare, and not a bastard mixture of j
Shakespeare-cum-Jennings.
Supporting 1 Cast Good
David Regnery's down - and - out
Tom Kyd was the best of fhe minor
supporting roles. Hal Kahn, who
can always be; depended upon, made
a workmanlike Kit Marlow whose
death was the only flaw in an other
wise convincing portrait. Frederick
Gray overbid Robert Greene with
out having Ihe excuse for overplay- j
ing which made Marshall Dill's pre- j
cious John Fletcher effective.
Others in a uniformly excellent
supporting cast included Judson
Sturtevant as a blustery Ben Jon
son; Howard Roberts as the ancient
sexton, whose tale of his annoying j
grandmother formed one of the j
play's comedy high - spots; Jack
Benty, perfectly cast as honest Fulke
Greville; and Dorothy Brookman,
who had nothing to do as Diana
Mauteby, and did it well. The Texas
drawl of Sir Walter Raleigh came
as rather a surprise, but aside from
that Jim Corner was good in his i
minor role.
