## TWO FOR GOOD NEWS 
### 
{JNLY the absence of "Pomp and
Circumstance" from the musical '
score keeps "Lloyds of London" j
from being the best British propa- !
ganda since "Lives of a Bengal Lane- j
er." Another of those tributes to the I
Empire that Hollywood makes so
well and England so poorly, it is
uninspired cinema but excellent en
tertainment.
Perhaps the British merchant
marine doesn't depend quite so
much on Lloyds as the producers
have chosen to depict, and perhaps
the plot is inconclusive as regards
the love-interest; but dished up by
Sir Guy Standing, Freddie Barthol
omew, Madeleine Carroll, Tyrone
Power, and an excellent supporting
cast, it becomes one of the most;
worthwhile films of the month.
Romantic Story
When 12-year-old Horatio Nelson
in the person of Douglas Scott—an
other juvenile, and a good one—goes;
to sea, his chum Jonathan Blake —I
Freddie Bartholomew in Cockney — I
goes to London to find Mr. Lloyd, j
the insurance man. Discovering that
the gentleman has been dead 60
years and that Lloyd's Coffee House
has become an exchange in which
private syndicates buy and sell in
surance, Jonathan is taken under the
wing of Lloyds' guiding genius. John ;
Angerstein.
In France to rescue Napoleon-har- '
ried English refugees, he rescues a
Beautiful Blonde, who turns out to j
be Madeline Caroll and later turns I
out to be married to an unpleasant :
man named Stacy.
Embittered, Jonathan drowns his;
sorrows in insurance, and has be- 1
come head of Lloyds' most influential'
syndicate by the time we are ready j
to see Nelson die at Trafalgar. This i
he does with the traditional "Thank ;
God, I have done my duty!" but not |
before Jonathan has broadcast a,
false report of his victory and saved |
England.
'England's Oke'
As Horatio's funeral cortege pass- |
es, Jonathan stands at the window, I
the audience seeths with mixed emo- j
tions which presently resolve them- j
selves into a general feeling that By
God, England's all right! and the ul
timate day of Anglo-American ac- ]

cord draws imperceptibly and in
exorably nearer.
Twice as beautiful as Robert Tay
lor and three times as good an actor,
Tyron Power is excellent as the man
Jonathan Blake. He deserves the ac
claim he will undoubtedly get, and
probably will be around for some
time to come. He's definitely a re
lief from the general run of Holly
wood's sugar-coated boy friends.
Madeline Carroll is beautiful to
look at, but she can't act, and one
feels throughout that it will be too
bad if the service-girl, Polly, doesn't
get Jonathan. Fortunately, the plot
leaves one up in the air, so it really
doesn't matter.
Aubrey Top-flight
C. Aubrey Smith is tops as "Old
Q," the Marquess of Queensbury,
who kept London gossips of his day
constantly on edge with his exploits.
Sir Guy Standing's John Angerstein
is up to the standard he has set for
himself time and time again, and
both Polly and Lord Stacy are ex
cellent.
All in all, you won't regret seeing
it. It's worth 40 cents of anybody's
money.

"Dangerous Number" was going to
get somewhere before it got too in
volved in its plot, but it presently
ended up being stupid. Starring
Robert Young and Anne Southern,
it's a waste of good material.
