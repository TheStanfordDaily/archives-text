## Performance in 'Idolatry' Gives Players Chance With Warners' Studio 
### 
Five members of the cast of Dra
matic Council's production, "This
Side Idolatry," so impressed As
sitant Casting Director Irving R.
Kumen of Warner Bros. Studios that
they will be given screen tests in
Hollywood.
After attending a performance of
the play Friday night, Mr. Kumen
asked to interview Jim Corner, Phil
Brown, George Wood, Onyet Watson,
and Dorothy Brookman. He was es
pecially interested in Corner, who
played the minor role of Sir Walter
Raleigh, but showed signs of being
good movie material. Phil Brown,
the Will Shakespeare of the play,
expressed a desire to do technical
work in or to direct motion pictures.
When he interviewed the actors,
Mr. Kumen told them not to get ex
cited over the idea of picture con
tracts, but that there are prospects
for starling successful careers. He
praised the casting, production, scen
ery, and finish of the American pre
miere of "This Side Idolatry."
Jim Corner will go to Hollywood
next week-end to take his screen
test. He played the leading role in
last quarter's production of "Road
side," and is seriously interested in
going into the motion pictures. The
other members of the cast selected
will probably make their tests dur
ing spring vacation.
This is the first time in recent
years that members of the cast have
been selected directly from a campus
production for picture work. It is an
established policy of some of the
major studios to send talent scouts
to college dramatic performances
throughout the country to discover
potential material for the Hollywood
mill.
