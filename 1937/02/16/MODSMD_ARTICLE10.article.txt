# New Student Leaders Take Jobs Tonight
## Ex Committee Will Plan Student-Faculty Group; Consider Debate Tour 
### 
Ex Committee will begin the sec
ond half of its year's business tonight
when three new members elected
last week take their seats around the
Committee's huge table in the Old
Union.
Jack Culderwood, varsity basket
ball ace, will replace his fellow Toro,
Chick Franich, as junior man. Jean
Reynolds, Kappa and President Jim
Reynolds' sister, will take over
Delta Gamma Jackie Brown's duties
as sophomore woman. Los Arcos Joe
Weiner, B.A.C. bandage man, was
elected to Phi Delt Joe Burris' post
as graduate member.
Franich Still Active
Franich, long a prominent figure
in Stanford student government, will
continue his term as chairman of
Cardinals. Miss Brown will remain
a force in junior class politics. Bur
ris, a graduate student, will retire to
"private life."
A permanent committee for stu
dent-faculty relations will be set up
by Ex Committee according to
President Reynolds' new plan. Stu
dents and faculty members will
serve on the committee to foster
group relations and to settle differ
ences between the two.
The Debate Council's proposed
tour to Central America will be con
sidered by the Committee, probably
approved.
