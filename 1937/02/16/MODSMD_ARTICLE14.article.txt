# Faulty Exhaust Air Crash Clue
## Auto Engineer Says Plane Had Motor Trouble 
### 
OAKLAND, Feb. 15 (U.R).â€”Ernest
Ingold, automotive engineer, said
today that he heard a "rickety"
sound from the exhaust of a United
Airlines transport plane last Tues
day night, shortly before it crashed
in San Francisco Bay carrying 11
persons to their deaths.
He believed at the time, he said,
that the plane was having motor
trouble.
Ingold testified at a Department
of Commerce hearing into the disas
ter.
Witnesses who followed Ingold to
the stand apparently gave little
credence to this theory, however.
They said the plane could have been
landed safely even though one of
its motors was not functioning.
Most of the witnesses were air
plane pilots and mechanics.
