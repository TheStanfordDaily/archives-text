# 7 Stevedores Hurt in S.F. Union Riot
## Cuspidors Hurled When Bridges' Rivals Invade Hiring Hall 'For Work' 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15 (U.R).â€”
j San Francisco's waterfront was quiet
; tonight after an outburst of rioting
! which broke out when 300 members
'of Lee Holman's Longshoremen's
[ Union marched to the rival Inter
national Longshoremen's hiring hall
and demanded work.
Seven nien were injured in the
violence, which included a stabbing,
rock barrage, sluggings and cuspi
dor deluges.
Holman was ousted by Harry
Bridges as Pacific Coast president
of the International Longshoremen's
Association in 1934. His new and
rival "union" has received recogni
tion from neither the shipowners nor
the A.F. of L.
Stabbing the Starter
Police said the battle started
shortly after Holman's men appeared
at the I.L.A. hiring hall. Accounts
differed as to responsibility for start
ing the trouble. Henry Schmidt,
president of the local I.L.A. chapter,
said an unidentified member of
Holman's organization stabbed Sam
uel Brown, I.L.A. member, precipi
tating the rioting.
Holman said the trouble started
when I.L.A. members threw stones
and pieces of concrete.
100 Police Fight Mob
The battle raged across mid-San
Francisco with 100 police reserves
endeavoring to herd Holman's men
toward their headquarters while
their rival workers pursued, throw
ing stones.
Once inside the service men's
headquarters, members of the Hol
man union "laid low" until police
had dispersed their pursuers.
Holman claimed he had sent his
men to the hiring hall under the
impression that there was extra
work to be had on the waterfront.
He said employers had notified him
of this but Frank Gregory, manager
of the Waterfront Employers' Asso
ciation, said that no longshoremen
would be accepted for work without
I.L.A. approval.
