# Speakers' Bureau Calls for Talent
## 
### 
To augment the 27 students now
speaking for the Speaker's Bureau,
a Review Board is being held March
4 to pass on applicants.
The bureau, now in its second
year, supplies speakers for service
clubs, fraternity groups, high school,
labor groups, and others. It is non
profit, although the transportation is
paid by the organization where the
talk is given. "Some speakers have
had to turn down invitations. We
are really getting a demand for
speakers," said Charles Schlafer.
Discussions of conservation, social
security ,and interpretations of men
who have not been great are much
in demand. Any student is eligible.
Applicants should get in touch with
Edward Lindblom, speech adviser, or
Charles Schafer, manager of the
Speakers' Bureau, for help in pick
ing a suitable subject.
