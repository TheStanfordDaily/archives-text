### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (UP).-j
The Administration campaign for the
President's plan to infuse young i
blood into the Supreme Court ex- j
panded today from coast to coast in a \
program likely to bring Mr. Roose
velt personally into the national de
bate.
Atty. Gen. Homer S. Cummings
opened formal defense of the Roose
l'elt judiciary proposals with a jibe
at "irresponsible talk about dictator
ship" and a charge that recent judi
cial action had. "hampered" the peo
ple in free direction of their own
destiny.
Mr. Cummings said:
"Those who wish to preserve the
status quo want to retain on the i
bench judges who may be relied
upon to veto progressive measures." j
He denied new judges would be !
"subservient" to the President.
"Out of every flight of hysteria on
this question," Mr. Cummings said, j
"there comes a further charge that i
the President's proposals will lead to
dictatorship through the establish
ment of evil precedent.
Neither side yet possesses a ma
jority of committed senators. The |
congressional Democratic leadership, :
despite some private muttering, is,
generally pledged to support the
plan which either would lead to
early retirement of the more aged
Supreme Court justices or permit |
expansion of their number from nine
to fifteen.
