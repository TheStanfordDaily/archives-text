# Commencement Audience to See Ceremonies in Natural Theater
## Trees and Shrubs Will Seclude Spectators 
### JIM HURST 
Complete isolation in \a "natural"
wooded amphitheater will be en
joyed by the commencement audi
ence. next June if Comptroller A1
Roth's plans for Stanford's newest
theater project'go smoothly.
Amphitheater-goers will sit in
movable chairs on a terraced lawn,
with all view of the campus' com
monplaces cut off by trees and
shrubs growing profusely over the
uneven slopes and rim of the bowl.
Not Symmetrical
No symmetry will mar the impres
sion of a purely "accidental" forest
theater. Occasional trees will be
scattered along the succession of ter
races that slope down to a grass
covered stage.
A special niche in the earth rim
behind the east corner of the stage
will disclose to the audience a view
of Black Mountain in the distance,
which can be obstructed by nothing
less unusual than a hook-and-ladder
truck racing past Encina.
Islands Remain
Two "islands" at the original
ground level have been left, one on
each side of the stage, and heavily
planted with trees to form screens
for the wings. Ready access to the
dressing rooms of the Memorial The
ater will be provided for actors.
An unusual feature recently in
corporated into the plans is to have
a small stage rise from one end of
the big stage, build a second smaller
amphitheater upon the stage of the
big one.
Weather Problem
Chief problem at the moment con
fronting Mr. poth and his diggers
and scrapers is to "beat the weather"
in planting the thousands of trees
which are already boxed and being
shipped to Stanford from all parts of
the West.
The same warm weather which
will dry up the slopes of the bowl so
the trees can be moved in will start
the trees budding within a few days,
making it impossible to plant them.
