# Women Will Go On Debate Trips
## 
### 
If Stanford sends a team to
Hawaii ' between winter and
spring quarters to debate, a
woman may be sent as a
member of the team. This will
be the first time in Cardinal de
bate history that a woman will
have gone on a tour of any
importance.
Dean of Women Mary Yost,
who taught debating at Vassal
before coming to Stanford,
granted permission, saying, "I
want girls and boys to have the
same opportunity in debating.
I don't think that you will get
the same interest of girls in
debate unless they do have the
same opportunity to go on
tours. There is no danger of
lowering the standards if you
let in women."
