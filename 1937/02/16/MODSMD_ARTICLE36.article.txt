"Religion does not hold jui important place in the life of the average
Stanford student," says Maurice Ballenger, teacher at Lucknow College
India, at present visiting coast universities, to study the student outlook,
and get a cross-section of student life.
At Stanford. Mr. Ballenger lias spent a week living in each of three of
the men's dormitories, Sequoia, Branner, and Toyon. and has talked With

various Row groups. He finds it j
(generally true that students no long- \
er believe in a conventional type of \
religion, that is, the church has!
passed out of the life of the student.'
Most students, however, are interest
ed in finding out a philosophy of life
which will yield "abundant living."
The ideas of Stanford students in
regard to religion are almost iden
tical, Mr. Ballenger finds. This simi- ;
larity is unique at Stanford and not
so noticeable in a state university. I
There is also a self-satisfaction and
self-sufficiency prevalent in all the
groups that is '"disconcerting" to an
outsider. Among Stanford women,
Mr. Ballenger finds a more enthusi
astic response and a greater willing- \
ness to talk with him than among
the men.

Mr. Ballenger commented upoo 1
the situation of the men here saying
it is "uncontrolled." Nobody seems
to care about the men, and in their j
living groups they hardly seem to be
related to the university.
