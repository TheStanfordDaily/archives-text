# Golden Bears Sharpen Claws For Cardinals
## Indians Will Stick to Old Tactics in Friday's Tilt With Berkeley Quintet 
### 
A very ambitious Golden Bear j
will be playing host to Coach John
Bunn and his laughing boys next
Friday evening.
And it is the fond hope of that |
Golden Bear, representing generally
about 15,000 rabid University of Cal
ifornia students, and specifically, the
Cal basketball mentor, Clarence E. I
"Nibs" Price and his charges, led by
Captain Robert "Cow" Herwig, that
Coach Bunn and his Stanford quint
won't be laughing on Saturday
morning.
Rears Justified
Truth to tell, the Bears have some
justification for their hopes, when
we consider that they vanquished the
(hen once defeated U.S.C. outfit last
Saturday night 36-32 and were bare- |
ly inches out of a win on Friday j
night to the same squad in a melee j
which featured two overtime pe- j
riods.
Now when we further consider
that the Trojans turned the trick j
against our boys in their first meet- j
ing, it begins to look as though the |
two teams will be battling on a half- J
way even basis.
What is more, the California five
will have the indubitable advantage
of cavorting on their home court and I
of having the majority of the crowd j
pulling lustily for them.
All of which would seem to indi- j
cate that it's going to be a ball game. !
Routine Practiced
Coach Bunn, however, intends to i
spring nothing new or unusual in the i
Friday night encounter, and will |
spend the rest of the week in per- i
feeting that style of play which he I
has used all season to such good ef- i
feet.
He gave the boys on the first string ;
a day off yesterday, and spent the I
entire practice session with the sec- j
onds, of whom Forward Bill Quade j
looked particularly good, but will i
work the "big guns" plenty hard to
night.
Incidentally, according to Bunn,
"Lover" Moore played the best
games of his three-year career last
Friday and Saturday against Caddy
Works' U.C.L.A. Bruins. It seems
that Dinty, doing a two-man guard
ing job, was probably the main fac- |
tor in pulling that 42-40 contest out j
of the fire on Friday.

cate that it's going to be a ball game. !
Routine Practiced
Coach Bunn, however, intends to i
spring nothing new or unusual in the i
Friday night encounter, and will |
spend the rest of the week in per- i
feeting that style of play which he I
has used all season to such good ef- i
feet.
He gave the boys on the first string ;
a day off yesterday, and spent the I
entire practice session with the sec- j
onds, of whom Forward Bill Quade j
looked particularly good, but will i
work the "big guns" plenty hard to
night.
Incidentally, according to Bunn,
"Lover" Moore played the best
games of his three-year career last
Friday and Saturday against Caddy
Works' U.C.L.A. Bruins. It seems
that Dinty, doing a two-man guard
ing job, was probably the main fac- |
tor in pulling that 42-40 contest out j
of the fire on Friday.
A very ambitious Golden Bear j
will be playing host to Coach John
Bunn and his laughing boys next
Friday evening.
And it is the fond hope of that |
Golden Bear, representing generally
about 15,000 rabid University of Cal
ifornia students, and specifically, the
Cal basketball mentor, Clarence E. I
"Nibs" Price and his charges, led by
Captain Robert "Cow" Herwig, that
Coach Bunn and his Stanford quint
won't be laughing on Saturday
morning.
Rears Justified
Truth to tell, the Bears have some
justification for their hopes, when
we consider that they vanquished the
(hen once defeated U.S.C. outfit last
Saturday night 36-32 and were bare- |
ly inches out of a win on Friday j
night to the same squad in a melee j
which featured two overtime pe- j
riods.
Now when we further consider
that the Trojans turned the trick j
against our boys in their first meet- j
ing, it begins to look as though the |
two teams will be battling on a half- J
way even basis.
What is more, the California five
will have the indubitable advantage
of cavorting on their home court and I
of having the majority of the crowd j
pulling lustily for them.
All of which would seem to indi- j
cate that it's going to be a ball game. !
