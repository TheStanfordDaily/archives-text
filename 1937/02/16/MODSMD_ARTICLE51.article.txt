## Lafaille Back In Frosh Quint Injured Star To Play In Friday's Cub Tilt 
### 
Good news in the form of one Dr.
William H. Northway greeted Pap
oose basketballers yesterday.
The good news that Dr. Northway
had to tell was that Leon Lafaille,
ace forward who has been out for
the past week with water on the knee
sustained in (he U.S.F. game, will
definitely play next Friday night
when the frosh play their second
little Big Game with the California
Cubs. Lafaille was out for a work
out yesterday, but was permitted to
practice shooting only, the team doc
tor forbidding him to take any
chances of further injury.
Mentors Bunn and HufT drilled the
first quintet on offense for the whole
two-hour practice period, perfecting
short passes above everything else.
Today the Papooses will hit the
boards with defensive tactics.
