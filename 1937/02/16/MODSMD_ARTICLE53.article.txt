# Skiing, Ice Hockey Draw Students to Yosemite
## 
### 
"Sunny California" does not keep
down the Esquimau instinct of Stan
fordites!
Five hours is all it takes to change
student to skier—provided he spends
the time driving toward Yosemite.
This is what a crowd of 20 or more
does every Friday, after renting skis
at Smith's in Paly. Others go to Mt.
Shasta or Longbarn.
Yosemite Popular
Although Longbarn can be reached
in about three and a half hours,
Yosemite is most popular. Ski
courses are laid out, and (satisfac
tory accommodations available.
A wintry week-end of this type
will cost plenty, however, unless the
subject knows the ropes. Orthodox
means of dodging the expensive
lodge and cabins include getting ac
commodations for a dollar a night at
one of the dormitories or at El Portal
at the entrance of the park. Meals
come to about $2 per day.
Skiing is not the only activity to
be found at Yosemite. There is also
skating ,with ice hockey some week
ends. Evenings are occupied by an
occasional dance — in ski clothes —
and movies and talks by the rangers
on the scenery and sports in the
park.
Ski at Badger Pass
Skiers, many of them novices,
usually leave the valley in the morn
! ing to spend the day skiing at Badger
i Pass, 25 miles away. Meals are
available here, but sleeping accom
! modations are found only below.
Kappa Sigs have a group that goes
| up nearly every week. They expect
15 or more at their party this week
|at Yosemite. Chief misshap last
week was loss of a great many ski
I pictures. The road was flooded and
' films were in on the general re-

I sultant soaking.
Road conditions are greatly im
| proved now, according to the A.A.A.,
j the best route probably being over
the Dumbarton Bridge up toward
i Stockton, then through Modesto to
Merced. Ski conditions are hard to
} predict, but have been satisfactory
most week-ends so far this season.
