THE GREAT GAME
OK RUGBY

Now, rugby is a great spor^.
Not only is it great, but it takes a
mess of brawn and high-powered
nerve to get out there, especially on
these muddy days, with a skimpy
pair of shorts on and trying to mix it
with a bunch of hairy giants that
play for fun in a manner most ordi
nary people would call fighting.
Of course, how those nuts play
rugby is their own afl'air and none
of mine, but it interests me. And
then there is a constant urging
from the rugby stall", coaches and
managers alike, not to mention the
players, for me to "give a little
space to rugby, once in a while."
Now, for both of those reasons I
have gone back to Volume 88, Stan
ford Daily, of which Gordy Frost
was sports editor, to get a little diype
on the history and methods of that
cuh-razy and hence enjoyable game.
Frost, 1 must mention, had the same
idea as f have, for he got his stuff
from a pair of hardy souls and
former Dailymen, Spud Hamilton

and Charlie Chaopell. Both of those
Rents played , lie of tl:o ol' rugger
in their younger a • r.
Since an explanutio: i 'he game
would help in arousing i r-es(. I
hope, and the ruggers hope. '<•' v
glean from the good Doctor i •
in part: Scoring in rughy is av
coniplished much the same as in
American football, the general idea
being to carry the ball across the
goal line, or kick it through the
goal posts from a drop or place
ment.

TOUCHDOWN
CALLED A TRY

A touchdown, to use the American
term, is called a try in rugby, and
counts only three points. (I'd demand
! at least 20 points if 1 got through 15
| packages of muscle the likes of a
i rugby team, while I was clad in any
] thing less than a battleship.)
With a good conversion (he
| score is boosted to five points.
Piace-kicks are worth three
points, too (no, no, points, not
beer), while a drop-kick that
J makes the grade scores four points.
Dink Templeton, in the happy days

I of long ago, was quite n whip at
| rugby since he was supposed to
have scored a 45-yard drop-kick
' while placing with the American
J Olympic team in l ranee MJ2O. Dink
I has never denied it, it must he
l rue.
Roughly the usual rugger team is
composed of eight forwards or
serum, while the backfield has seven.
There may be some transposition,
but there can't be more than 15 men
on the field at the start of a game.
When somebody gets a cracked nog-
I gin, as did Karl Sehaupp, down south
. l Saturday against U.S.C., it's

tough. There is no substitution al
lowed -you just play with the men
that are left. (Stanford played Troy
most of the game, incidentally, with
only 14 men, which might have help
ed in the loss.)
Stanford plays the "three-four"
serum—three men in the front line
of the scrum and four in the sec
ond—with the wing forward to the
left or riyht rolling the hall into
the serum. That's where everybody
gets his shins kicked, and how.
What a game, whooie!
