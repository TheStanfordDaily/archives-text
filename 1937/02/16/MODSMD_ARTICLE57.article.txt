STUDENT government at Stanford gets its
semi annual "new blood" tonight when Fra
nich, Brown and Burris turn over their posts on
Ex Committee to Calderwood, Reynolds and
Weiner.
The mid-year change of three Ex Committee
members is usually imperceptible in the subse
quent actions of the legislative body. But this
year Ex Committee will lose the man who,
next to Reynolds and Fontius, has put his stamp
most indelibly on Stanford student affairs—
Chick Franich.
Whether or not Franich has always been
logical in his assumptions and arguments is
not the point. He hasn't. Some have called him
stubborn and bull-headed. They may have been
right. But the fact remains that Franich ap
proached Ex Committee problems actively. Un
like others on Ex Committee, he questioned
proposed measures before voting on them.
Sometimes he merely prolonged action unnec
essarily. But he realized that he represented a
portion of the Stanford student body and tried
to get his constituents' slant into his viewpoint.
Perhaps he spoke harshly in his farewell
speech last week.
But he was voicing a fundamental truth of
student government when he said that student
legislation reflects the Administration more than
it does the student body.
Franich had the ability to see farther into
student affairs than the average Ex Committee
member. That his opinions often fell upon deaf
ears is merely an example of Ex Committee's
passive, take-the-easiest-way attitude.
But Franich is gone. Calderwood, Revnolds
and Weiner may or may not adopt his active
attitude toward A.S.S.U. business.
But they should remember him.—D. B.
President Roosevelt said he regarded re
fusal of General Motors president, Alfred P.
Sloan, Jr., to attend a strike conference a
"very unfortunate decision on his part."
