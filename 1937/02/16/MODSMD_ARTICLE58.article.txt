# After the Game, What?

### 
SOME of the fingers that habitually frequent
the Stanford pie might do well to pull out
this plum some happy Friday or Saturday night
—give Stanford people something to do after
basketball games!
It's a serious situation. When at 9:30 the
timer's gun announces that Stanford basketball
aces have won another one, Pavilion doors
burst open to spew forth happy people and
voices — "those fellows were really 'hot' to
night"—"Luisetti's marvelous"—et al.
But surging adrenalin soon slows—"what'll
we do now?" Few choices are offered.
1. You can go home.
2. Or try to make a late show.
3. Or if you're one of the chosen few, per
haps you'll do some driving.
But one point is certain—in the absence of
Miller's dim-lighted cocktail room there exists
today a void. Where last season the Pavilion
crowd gathered to tell of Moores and Luisettis
(the ball players were there too, to rehash the
evening's festivities) and talk went around and
around about what "damn good game it was"
and how "Hank almost went through the bass
drum"—today Stanford has nothing.
The bar at Miller's is not necessary. An after
basketball-gathering is. Three home games re
main this season, two with U.S.C. and one with
Cal. On the way is a championship team.
Pending the construction of a Nitery and be
fore the season is gone, let Stanford gather on
campus with its team, to cheer, dance, talk.—
