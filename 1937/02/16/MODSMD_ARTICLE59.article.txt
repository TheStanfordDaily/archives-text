(From the U.S.C. Trojan)
MEN and women mature enough to attend a
university have every right to receive
some degree of respect from those who run the
Student Union magazin stand—a commercial
enterprise supported by the students and sub
sidized by the university.
Does the person who is responsible for this
display believe that Trojan literary taste is on
the levei with the base stratum of society which
subscribes to such obscene peiiodicals as "Film
Fun," "Ballyhoo," and that acme of polluted
reading matter —"Hardboiled"?
The flaunting of such material as is contained
in "Hardboiled," with its foul front-cover, and
the filthy inartistic nudes depicted in "Film
Fun," is vile enough to evoke a severe repri
mand upon the person responsible for this dis
gusting display of periodicals.
The naivete with which sundry types of cur
rent magazines are placed in the rack provided
for display might be somewhat humorous were
it not so nauseating. For, alongside U.S.C.'s re
spected "World Affairs Interpreter," one finds
the odious "Film Fun" with its reputedly
"breezy stories and teasing pictures."
It is not enough to say that students do not
have to purchase this foul type of reading mat
ter, for even if it were not the intention of those
in charge to make sales, the obscene display is
a reflection upon the university that is far from
favorable.

Things grow more complex all the time. A
Massachusetts court rules that a woman on
roller-skates is a vehicle, and in Indiana a
man is going to law to find out if a trailer is
an automotive accessory or a house.
