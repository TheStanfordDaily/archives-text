# Boys Handle 'Hot Food,' Agreement Says
## 
### "OUR HASHER 
The Chi O Hashers' Sit Down and
Shut Up Strike collapsed today as
several hashers quite noticeably
stood up and shouted, thus setting
back Ihe Stanford hasher unioniza
tion movement another fifty years.
That the folding of the unfolded
arms strike means the destruction
of hasher unionization up the Row
seems certain, though repercussions
may not make themselves felt on the
unionization <">t campus janitors.
'No Spik' Ban
The strike was called and the
union was formed as the result of
a fiat handed down by high Chi
Omega administratives that hashers
could not speak to the sisters during
dinner or enter the front room with
hashers' jackets.
Technique for breaking the strike
used by the sorority women fol
lowed definite non-Marxian theory,
and was quite different from the pro
cedure utilized by Janitor Foreman
Brown in his efforts to discourage
the Janitors' Union on the campus.
Instead of taking the boys into
dark corners and choking them, they
broke down hasher indifference by
luring them off to the cinema and
ungagging them.
"No Spik" Ban Banned
This definitely broke down strike
discipline and morale, despite the
fact that the hashers had sworn in
blood on a page of Bassett's "A
Handbook of Oral Expression" not
to speak to the women in the house
under any circumstances.
Also included in the pact was the
guarantee not to furnish the women
with the seconds they requested.
This was broken down, when a Chi
O smile and a pear caused several
renegade hashers to smuggle Hot
Food through the picket lines.
Female Cossacks Gloat
Though no statement was forth
coming from the victorious sorority
administration on its spectacular
strike-breaking tactics, spokesman
of the depressed and suppressed
classes, Headhasher Barney Green
lee, summed up the feelings of the
hashers after their seven-day reign
of Terror:
"I don't give a G-d d-mn,"
Communications from the East in
dicate that these were the same sen
timents of William L. Grein when
the Miners' Union got Green about
the gills; so the collapse of the local
rank and filly organization came at
a significant time for both the cam
pus and the nation.

rank and filly organization came at
a significant time for both the cam
pus and the nation.
BOX SCORE OF 7 DAYS' STRIFE
5 broken glasses
(» chipped soup plates
5 mangled hashers
2 stubs on the aisle
No seconds on succotash
2!) Chi Omegas good as new
The Chi O Hashers' Sit Down and
Shut Up Strike collapsed today as
several hashers quite noticeably
stood up and shouted, thus setting
back Ihe Stanford hasher unioniza
tion movement another fifty years.
That the folding of the unfolded
arms strike means the destruction
of hasher unionization up the Row
seems certain, though repercussions
may not make themselves felt on the
unionization <">t campus janitors.
'No Spik' Ban
The strike was called and the
union was formed as the result of
a fiat handed down by high Chi
Omega administratives that hashers
could not speak to the sisters during
dinner or enter the front room with
hashers' jackets.
Technique for breaking the strike
used by the sorority women fol
lowed definite non-Marxian theory,
and was quite different from the pro
cedure utilized by Janitor Foreman
Brown in his efforts to discourage
the Janitors' Union on the campus.
Instead of taking the boys into
dark corners and choking them, they
broke down hasher indifference by
luring them off to the cinema and
ungagging them.
"No Spik" Ban Banned
This definitely broke down strike
discipline and morale, despite the
fact that the hashers had sworn in
blood on a page of Bassett's "A
Handbook of Oral Expression" not
to speak to the women in the house
under any circumstances.
Also included in the pact was the
guarantee not to furnish the women
with the seconds they requested.
This was broken down, when a Chi
O smile and a pear caused several
renegade hashers to smuggle Hot
Food through the picket lines.
Female Cossacks Gloat
Though no statement was forth
coming from the victorious sorority
administration on its spectacular
strike-breaking tactics, spokesman
of the depressed and suppressed
classes, Headhasher Barney Green
lee, summed up the feelings of the
hashers after their seven-day reign
of Terror:
"I don't give a G-d d-mn,"
Communications from the East in
dicate that these were the same sen
timents of William L. Grein when
the Miners' Union got Green about
the gills; so the collapse of the local
rank and filly organization came at
a significant time for both the cam
pus and the nation.
