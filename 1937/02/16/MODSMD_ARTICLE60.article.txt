AS THE ACTORS were taking their curtain calls
after "This Side Idolatry" Saturday night, a kindly
man who was waiting backstage noticed that the off
stage noises were busy claquing to re-enforce the ap
plause from the audience.
Said the man: "I do believe, my little man, that the
applause of the cast is louder than that of the audience."
"Yes, it is," replied the little man, "there are more
of us, sir."
\
Conforming to orthodox Daily editorial policy, it
seems that all the girls in Roble are not hell-bent on
having careers or settling down to a life of teaching
and hating men. This is borne out by the fact that
a sponsor, dissatisfied with the educational levels of her
charges has imported a volume of "The Marriage Man
ual" that hois become a one volume circulating library
of high velocity. Mamma or the Dean never told them.
Espionage of a particularly vicious sort has been
undertaken by the California Highway Patrol. It seems
that the long arm of the state law reached down into
the pristine fastness of the Law School and plucked a
promising young first-year student away from the
bounded calf and put him on a motorcycle patx-olling
the Bayshore from two to three each night. The prom
ising young student there utilizes his college education
to brutalize his profession, proving indisputably that
fascism is entering American higher education. Be
cause this wise guy takes a particular delight in haul
ing down Stanford cars at about 2:15 in the morning,
and when the terrified hounded calf uses the conven
tional stall that if the gal doesn't get in for her lockout
she'll be suspended, the demon laughs a villainous
laugh and shows them his sheepskin, which he has
sewed to the inside of his pants, to keep them from
wearing holes on the motorcycle.
He is looking forward with fiendish pleasure to get
ting transferred down to Gilroy for Washington's Birth
day and Spring Vacation. He gets lonesome for Stan
ford stickers, he says.
I think we ought to put him up as a Big Game
trophy, and let the Cal guys come over and paint C's
on him.
