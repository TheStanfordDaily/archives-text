# BULL SESSION
## DEATH COMES "TO A BUNCH OF CHEMICALS" 
### 
lUST a few days ago a genial old gentleman who knew
«* Stanford better than Stanford knows him, leaned
over the Union Cellar eigar counter and passed the
time of day with John Gunther.
"We're all just a bunch of chemicals," he said. "And
when we die, the chemicals just assume other forms."
His name was Edward Curtis Franklin, emeritus
professor of chemistry. He died Saturday.
* # # *
Wc wonder at the greatness of an elderly man who
can count only death as his future, and who can still
abide by the credos of the laboratory.
For Dr. Franklin held to his conviction that death
is oblivion even when death was donning its cloak to
keep an appointment with him, as it will with us all.

For most of us, the years of life untrammeled by
psychological fears constitute a tiny zone in the life
graph. It wasn't many years ago when we used to duck
under the covers in fear of the phantasms of our own
making. We were children then.
But it won't be so many years more before we live
in the shadow of a real fear, the fear of "what next," and
perhaps the terrible conviction that nothing "comes
next" but oblivion.
*>{»**
It's a strange characteristic of all heavens, be they
Christian or Pagan, that all are based on conscious
ness. The primitive Christian heaven was an eternity
spent sitting on clouds playing harps. The primitive
Hindu heaven is Nirvana—a more fleshy and sensuous
heaven, but again one with consciousness as a basic
ingredient.
What the human being seems to fear most about
death isn't death itself, but the fact that there may be
no consciousness after death.
We don't fear sleep, perhaps largely because wc
know we shall wake up. But I wonder of the terror
that might grip us if we knew that sleep meant eternal
unconsciousness.
Dr. Franklin said that death meant just that. And
facing death, he held strong to his knowledge and
passed even the last days of his life without the aid of
beliefs, however comforting, that varied from the les
sons of the laboratory.
