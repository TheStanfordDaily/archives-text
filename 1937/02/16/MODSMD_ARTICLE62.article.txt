# CAMPUS OPINION
## THANKS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Unfortunate readers of The Daily
barked their shins yesterday on
N.T.'s frenzied outburst against Vol
ume 91.
Today, perhaps, someone will rush
to the present Volume's deference
with tlie same raving, paroxismal
blasting. But I doubt it.
What The Daily needs is a deduc
tive critic, who doesn't go sniffing
around for evidence in support of a
gripe that he thinks would make a
sensational Campus Opinion.
If someone did want to criticize
Volume 91 sanely, there would still
be quite a large field. Take Bull Ses
sion. There is an example of a stu
dent who is worried and uncertain
about the many inconsistencies of the
world. And yet there are some who
pretend that his column is that of a
hairy radical.
News coverage could be better, but
The Daily this quarter is interesting.
And that is the one thing we're after,
isn't it?
Editorials have, with few excep
tions, been grey and unquotable, not
nearly up to Our Hasher in style or
attitude. Yesterday's edit on page 1
was a brilliant exception. Nothing
neutral about it, and it was a blast
worthy of a college editor who has
something on his mind.
There. If someone wants to criti
cize The Daily, let him start on this
tack, without flying of! the handle
and being so darn consistent and
closed-minded about it,
Skeptic
