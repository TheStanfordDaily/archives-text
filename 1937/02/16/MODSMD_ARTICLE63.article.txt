# THANKS, ANYWAY

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial, "Gasoline and Alco
hol Do Not Mix," like the use of
slang, does not leflect to the credit
of The Daily. Nor does it represent
the point of view of the student body,
which is not concerned at all in alco
hol.
Because a few students with over
swollen pocketbooks and gregarious
complexes chose to destroy their en
ergy and waste their leisure in night
spots, some brilliant genius candidly
suggests that Stanford turn tavern
keeper. Fortunately, sanity is more
prevalent in the Administration
than in the Editorial Board of The
Daily. It is not by making drinking
more easy that the University can
raise the standard of common sense
of its student body. It is by building
the character of students, to which
incidentally The Daily should con
tribute.
