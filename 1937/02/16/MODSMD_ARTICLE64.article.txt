# O.K. IDEA, THANKS

The Editor, Sir:
We are glad to note that Stanford
has more than a one-man basketball
team. Until the last several editions
of the Daily it was impossible to
know that, not to detract from Lui
setti, he is no doubt the bzest basket
ball player that the coast ever had,

as well as a fine modest boy, and he
no doubt dislikes all this "one man
stuff." But after all, there are four
others on the regular team, and
many fine "subs" who should be
given credit.
If the regulars were not so good
Luisetti could not do what he does.
Look at Ball, U.C.L.A. If his team
was stronger and if the squad was
stronger, Ball would show up even
better than he does. An old S.C.
player remarked that with the
doubtful exception of Araw, not an
S.C. player is good enough to make
the Stanford team, that was after
S.C. defeated Stanford by three
points, too.
We'd like to know something
about these Stanford boys and we'd
like to have the northern box scores.
You haven't been publishing them.
