# HARPING ON HARPER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir;
Long live Tro Harper and his very
fair and comprehensive criticism of
the American Way. So for you, L.
L. 8., if you didn't like the article,
you can go to the wilds of Zapua

where you no longer will have to
read.
You, L. L. 13., have the nerve to tell
Tro Harper (ol' pal) to get out and
go to Germany, etc., if he doesn't
like the American way. L. L. 8.,
you'd make a pretty fair Hitler your
self, sending people out of the coun
try because they disagree with
YOUR views.
Everything Harper said was true.
Read it over and think! Don't criti
cize blindly—don't be shallow! Only
the weakest of arguments fail to
withstand a good threshing over.
Besides, L, L. 8., you only named
a very few countries. Instead of
Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, you
might have mentioned England,
France, Switzerland, the Scandinav
ian countries, Australia—all of which
thrive beautifully — without using
the American Way or the Hitler or
Mussolini Way.
Be broad minded! You're in col
lege, you know.
H. A. S.

an anarchist, nor an atheist, and I
DO consider I'm well ofT in the U.S.,
though I do NOT feel aggressive
about it. H. S.
