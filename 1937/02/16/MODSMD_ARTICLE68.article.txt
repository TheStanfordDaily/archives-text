THEODORA GOES WILD
Mcnlo Theater
A SSISTED by two motherly aunts
and a blase lover, Irene Dunne,
in Theodora Goes Wild, succeeds in
freeing herself from family and eth
ical bonds to the amusement of any
and all audiences.
At first bashful, fearful of the town
gossips, organized under the head
ing of a literary club, Theodora says
nothing of her career as a writer of
popular, sophisticated fiction. Final
ly, convinced by a man she hires as
gardner, she goes to New York for
a visit to her publisher.
. In New York, she is forced by cir
cumstances to stay for dinner. She
orders straight whisky for a cock
tail. Frightened back to her self
complacent aunts' home by a trip to
her gardner's fashionable New York
apartment, she tries to bury herself
again in small town obscurity.
However, at a meeting of the lo
quacious literary society, she hears
one of her novels, written under an
assumed name, brought forth and
torn apart on moral grounds.
Here, Theodora does go wild. Bent

on creating a home-town sensation,
she establishes herself in the gar
dener's apartment and begins spend
ing some of her money on clothes
and publicity. As she progresses,
she involves herself in state politics
and two love affairs, one of them
her own.
The way she works her way out of
the difficulties is more amusing than
possible. However, she finally re
turns to her conservative Connecti
cut home. Advance publicity and the
town gossips have suspected every
thing but the worst. She helps them
out to that extent: she follows her
extensive luggage off the train with
a baby in her arms. Two hundred
and fifty mouths drop open. Even
the band stops playing. First to re
gain their composure are the two
aunts. They take ine child and pa
rade down the street with it,
The climax comes when the lead
ing town gossip, president of the lit
erary society, learns the child is her
own grandson and that her daugh
ter had been married and living in
the country for some time, while she
thought her hard at work in New
York.
Throughout the production Irene
Dunne and her full cast carry out a
most amusing plot in the most en
tertaining way American moving
picture enthusiasts have seen in
many months. —Alward

THEODORA GOES WILD
Mcnlo Theater
A SSISTED by two motherly aunts
and a blase lover, Irene Dunne,
in Theodora Goes Wild, succeeds in
freeing herself from family and eth
ical bonds to the amusement of any
and all audiences.
At first bashful, fearful of the town
gossips, organized under the head
ing of a literary club, Theodora says
nothing of her career as a writer of
popular, sophisticated fiction. Final
ly, convinced by a man she hires as
gardner, she goes to New York for
a visit to her publisher.
. In New York, she is forced by cir
cumstances to stay for dinner. She
orders straight whisky for a cock
tail. Frightened back to her self
complacent aunts' home by a trip to
her gardner's fashionable New York
apartment, she tries to bury herself
again in small town obscurity.
However, at a meeting of the lo
quacious literary society, she hears
one of her novels, written under an
assumed name, brought forth and
torn apart on moral grounds.
Here, Theodora does go wild. Bent

on creating a home-town sensation,
she establishes herself in the gar
dener's apartment and begins spend
ing some of her money on clothes
and publicity. As she progresses,
she involves herself in state politics
and two love affairs, one of them
her own.
The way she works her way out of
the difficulties is more amusing than
possible. However, she finally re
turns to her conservative Connecti
cut home. Advance publicity and the
town gossips have suspected every
thing but the worst. She helps them
out to that extent: she follows her
extensive luggage off the train with
