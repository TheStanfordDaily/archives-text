# Quad Asks Seniors To Return Proofs
## 
### 
Seniors who have not yet returned
their Quad proofs are requested to
do so as soon as possible, by Editor
Ruth Barnes. Three hundred have
not yet been called for, and many,
already called for, have not been re
turned. The photographic studio is
open from 9 to 11:45 o'clock in the
morning, and from 12:45 until 5 in
the afternoon.
This year's senior section is to be
the largest yet recorded, including
720 students, and the Quad has just
put the finishing touches on its pan
elling.
