# Bears Roar on 'Axe Burial' But It's Okeh by Reynolds
## 
### 
President Jim Reynolds slapped back at Leonard Charvet, president of
the University of California student body, yesterday when he upheld the
San Francisco exposition officials in their desire to "bury" the Stanford-
California axe on the fair grounds.
"Although we never had occasion to let the axe out when we had it in
our possession. I sec no reason why Cal should refuse to help the exposi-

tion in this way," Reynolds told the<
Daily last night.
Charvet and Helen Cunningham,
A.S.U.C. vice-president, had pre
viously termed the proposed axe
burying "a cheap publicity stunt.
The students of California will never
permit it."
The burying of the axe was to be
merely a mock ceremony to "sym
bolize good will of the colleges of
the world." The axe would not be
buried in reality, but would be re
turned safely to its vaults on the
California campus, fair officials point
out. The ceremonies were scheduled
for last Saturday on the site of Uni
versity Village but rain interfered.
James Doyle, editor of the Daily
Californian, editorialized that "the
axe has been a symbol of California-
Stanford rivalry through the years.
If it has any meaning for the stu
dents of the university it will never
be buried."
"It doesn't belong to the president
of the student body or td the execu
tive committee—but to the students
of Stanford as well as California,"
the editorial said.
Whether or not "a fine publicity
stunt has been nipped in the bud,"

as Editor Doyle termed it, is still
not definitely determined. Fair au
thorities will contact student offi
cials of both Stanford and California
before tmy more plans are made.
