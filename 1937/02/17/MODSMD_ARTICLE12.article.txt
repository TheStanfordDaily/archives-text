# Cause Of Air Crash Mystery, Jury Says
## 
### 
The reason why 11 died when a United Air Liner crashed in the Bay
oIT Mills Field last Wednesday was "uitasccrtainable at this time," the San
Mateo County coroner's jury decided yesterday. It recommended addi
tional boats and emergency rescue equipment at the field and the equip
ment of Bay Area passenger planes with scat-cushions of the life-preserver
type.
Meanwhile, several witnesses concurred in the opinion that the luxury
liner was experiencing motor trouble even before it overshot Mills Field

and catapulted into the water. Ed-<
ward Mitvalsky, owner of a Bay
shore Highway garage, joined with J
Mrs. Dorothy Lubton, San Mateo I
housewife, and Ernest Ingold, Bur
lingame and San Francisco automo- ;
bile dealer, in testifying that one of 1
the ship's motors had a "wrong
sound." The right motor was miss
ing, Mitvalsky testified. "It appeared
as though two cylinders were cut
ting in and out. The other motor
was smooth."
Ingold declared the sound of the
motor made him believe there was
a break in the exhaust manifolding.
Mrs. Lubton said she heard a "rhyth- ,
mic break in the hum of the engine"
as it passed above her home.
A power cruiser owned by James
Bedford, San Bruno policeman, was
available at the field and was
reached by a rowboat at the dock,
according to the testimony of B. M.
Doolin, an attendant. The field also
owned a speedboat which could not
be used because of channel-filling
operations, he said.
The accident was not the fault of
the pilot, according to the testimony
of Joseph B. Swim, San Francisco
city toxicologist. The organs of
both Pilot A. R. ("Tommy") Thomp
son and Co-pilot Joe Decessaro
showed no traces of alcohol after
being subjected to a pathological
test.
The hearing was conducted by
Coroner William Crosby and packed
the Council chambers at Burlingame
City Hall.
