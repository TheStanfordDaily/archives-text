# Oxford Scholar Talks on Burns
## Smith Emphasizes Poet's Respect for Tradition 
### 
Respect for tradition is the great
quality which has made Robert
Burns dear to the Scottish people,
according to Dr. David Nichol Smith,
Merton Professor of English at Ox
ford University, who gave a talk on
the poet here last night. •
Dr. Smith pointed out that Bums'
works are marked by simplicity,
frankness and artistry, and that in
his poetry tradition "found a clear
and unwavering voice." Burns, he
said, enriched and strengthened tra
dition in his songs. His originality
lies not in ideas but in his expres
sion. He expresses in new and
heightened ways the commonplaces
of experience, bringing ideas to a
sharp focus.
Dr. Smith said that every year the
Scotch celebrate Burns' birthday,
even though they are not ordinarily
considered a poetic people. Burns,
he pointed out, was essentially Scot
tish, both in outlook and in charac
ter. He was a great song writer,
composing or re-writing the words
to over 300 traditional Scottish airs.
''In these songs," said Dr. Smith, "I
cannot believe that he has ever been
surpassed."
Dr. Smith is himself a Scotsman,
and received his education at the
University of Edinburgh and at the
Sorbonne in Paris. He holds the
highest professorship in English lit
erature in his college, and has spe
cialized in eighteenth century works.
This year he is serving as one of the
visiting scholars at the Huntington
Library in Pasadena, but plans to
return to Oxford in April.
