# Library Display Features Jewel-Fund Book Plate
## 
### 
Featured in the bookplate collec
tion now on display in the Library
is a reproduction of Stanford's
famous jewel-fund bookplate. De
signed by the noted American mur
al ist.. Edwin Howland Blashfield, the
plate depicts Minerva, goddess of
wisdom, accepting gifts from Clio,
muse of history, and giving her in
return the emblem of victory.
Noticeable among the gifts prof
fered by the kneeling Clio is a string
of pearls, representing Mrs. Leland
Stanford's own jewels, which were
sold to endow the fund which bears
their name. The bulk of the books
purchased for the library are bought
with this fund, and the plate is to
be found in all of them.
Also included in the exhibit are
foreign and historical bookplates, as
well as plates from many American
universities. Cases are reserved for

those from all Stanford libraries â€”i
there are nearly 20 different kinds of'
these and those of faculty members j
and alumni. The display has been
selected from the library's bookplate
collection, which was started in 1912 j
by Miss Alice Hayes, the present ;
reference librarian.
Whenever books are purchased or J
donated second-hand to the library, j
the plates therein are preserved, andj
the collection has thus accumulated!
during the course of years. Contri
butions from students or faculty |
members who have bookplates of
unusual design or significance would j
be appreciated by the library, Miss j
Hayes said.
President Wilbur's bookplate is |
part of the present exhibit. The head i
of a wild boar figures prominently in |
its design. This is interpreted by the 1
librarian to signify the original root
meaning of the name "Wilbur."
