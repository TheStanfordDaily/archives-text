# Student-Prof Cooperation Aim of Group
## Committee of Six To Act As Intermediary For Social Study Changes 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
What President Jim Reynolds
called "potentially one of the most
important groups on the campus"
was officially established by
Ex Committee last night when it
appointed six members to a new
Committee on Student-Faculty Re
lations.
The new committee will act as a
go-between for student-faculty dif
ferences, plan social dinners and
gatherings where students and their
instructors "can get acquainted."
Appointed to the group were Bob
Adams, Jean Bird, Jack Calderwood,
Chick Franich, and the president and
vice-president of the student body.
The appointments will continue
through next year. Reynolds and
Esther Pelton will serve until June,
be replaced by their A.S.S.U. suc
cessors.
To receive any student suggestions
for changing courses, lectures, or
other academic matters, to help pro
fessors determine student attitudes,
the new committee will begin work
immediately.
Other student-body business in
cluded:
PRE - REGISTRATION PRO
GRAM: George Ditz was named
chairman of the orientation urogram
for the class of '41 next falL Ditz and
his co-workers, to be appointed soon,
will arrange a suitable program this
spring with the help of last fall's
committee.
A.S.S.U. DANCE: Cardinals was
instructed to hold an A.S.S.U. dance
following the Stanford-U.S.C. bas
ketball game Friday night, Febru
ary 26. "This'll keep them on the
campus," Ex Committee decided.
ELECTIONS: Dave Allison sug
gested changes in the student-body
election set-up. He proposed abol
ishment of the new Geology Corner
precinct, pressing Rally Committee
into servirje counting ballots.
Ruth Goodan, Jean Reynolds, and
Fred Williams will weigh Allison's
proposals, suggest some of their own
before next Tuesday's meeting.
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the Law
School, dissatisfied with the A.S.S.U.
Constitution's vagueness on elec
tion practices, will draw up more
definite rules, Roy Anderson told the
Committee.
NATIONAL AFFAIRS: The Na
tional Student Federation of Amer
ica, of which Stanford is a member,
asked Ex Committee to tell it how
Farm students feel about reciprocal
trade agreements, national defense,
service in the United States' armed
forces.
Because the questions were too
controversial, because Ex Commit
tee members would be expressing
their own views and not those of
the entire student body, no vote whs
taken. Ex Committee did approve,
however, the N.S.F.A.'s joining the
American Youth Congress, federa
tion of nearly all U.S. youth organi
zations.
PROPOSED ACTIVITY RESTRIC
TIONS: Reynolds asked his Com
mittee to consider a proposed ruling
that students be resti'icted to only
one important student-body office at
a time.
MASQUE BALL DATE: Cardi
nals asked for and were granted the
night of April 23 for the Convales
cent Home Drive's wind-up, the
Masque Ball.
