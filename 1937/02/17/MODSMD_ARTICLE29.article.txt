# Treasury Chief Promises Action On 'Hot' Money
## Morgenthau Concerned With Heavy Inflow Of Funds from Europe 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (U.R).—A
decision will be maSe within a few
days concerning the flowing of what
President Roosevelt calls "hot" mon
ey—heavy imports of foreign capital
for investment or safe-keeping —
Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau. Jr., said tonight.
Excess Credit Mounts
Morgenthau made the announce
ment at a press con Terence following
the first of a series of meetings of ad
ministration fiscal chiefs on the
problem of controlling $7,500,000,000
of foreign funds already invested
here and of stopping the steady in
flow. It is admitted privately that
if the heavy foreign investments
were liquidated and the money with
drawn from the country, a stock
market collapse might result.
In December the Treasury moved
to keep gold imports from swelling
the nation's mounting excess credit
reserves by purchasing the metal
and placing it in an "inactive fund."
This did not, however, stop or re
duce the flow of gold into the coun
try.
Must Purchase Silver
The continued stream of gold pre
sented the Administration with still
another problem, Secretary Mor
genthau testified before the House
appropriations sub-committee con
sidering the Treasury supply bill.
The metal poured in so rapidly and
in such quantities as to thwart suc
cessful administration of the silver
purchase act.
Under this law the Treasury is
compelled to purchase silver in the
open market until it reaches a ratio
of 1 to 3 with gold in the metallic
reserves of the Treasury.
Economists have'said that only two
alternatives are available to the Ad
ministration to regulate foreign cap
ital imports and investments. They
are taxation or exchange conrtol.
