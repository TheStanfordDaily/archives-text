# Senior Nine Manager Sweats For Block 'S'
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Those who think the senior base
ball manager has a cinch job—sitting
down to keep scores on games, tak
ing a lot of fancy trips with the
team, earning and wearing a Block
S, and other pleasures and ostenta
tions of those on the in—had better
look twice.
The senior baseball manager has
one of the most unhappy lots on the
campus.
Preparation
First off, he sweats for two years
before, by the grace of God and A1
Masters and Miss Du Prau, he re
ceives his appointment. There aren't
a lot of tryoutees for baseball man
agerships around Stanford, because
most frosh and sophomores don't
know it's played at Stanford, but
those who do come out are baseball
enthusiasts since childhood, and hard
to beat out.
After the manager's appointment,
Coach Harry Wolter, Miss Du Prau,
and Sergeant Moffitt (the old codger
in the equipment room) do their bit
to keep the senior manager busy
and careworn, but all of these to
gether don't approach the headache
brought on by old Jupe Pluvius.
Schedules Games
All of fall quarter and part of
winter quarter find the manager
scheduling practice games for both
frosh and varsity nines; the league
games are taken care of by the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee.
Then come the winter rains. By
this time you're acquainted with the
rdins in this district. Picture your
self as senior baseball manager.
Rain Upsets Plans
Stanford is to play Kenneally's
Seals Tuesday at 3:30, but there has
been a downpour Sunday and the
field is soft Monday when you and
Harry Wolter look it over. But a
stiff breeze has whipped up, and you
plan to play the game as scheduled,
so you get permission from Miss Du
Prau to place a call to the city for
an umpire from an agency there.
During the night another rain falls,
so you cut your 8 o'clock to get
Harry down to look at the field with
you. You get the Grounds Depart
ment officials to check with you, and
then you all look skyward. "Your
guess is as good as mine," says the
first one to speak.
• More Worry
So you wait a couple of hours un
til you have a free period and again
whip back to the B.A.C. Still not
certain, you fill out phone slips to
cancel the game and the request for

traveling cxpen.se has been guaran- |
teed to Kenneally, and must be paid j
whether the game is played or not, j
you'll save something in your own j
team expense if the game is can- I
celled.
In the meantime, no less than a!
dozen players have called to see if!
the game is ot be played. So has [
Don Liebendorfer. So has The Daily, j
Very reluctantly, after already hav- j
ing built up your publicity at great j
length, you say, "No."
and umpire, but shiver when you J
think of the agency's reaction and j
the office manager's attitude on the
phone bill and guarantee. Although ;

The senior baseball manager has
one of the most unhappy lots on the
campus.
Preparation
First off, he sweats for two years
before, by the grace of God and A1
Masters and Miss Du Prau, he re
ceives his appointment. There aren't
a lot of tryoutees for baseball man
agerships around Stanford, because
most frosh and sophomores don't
know it's played at Stanford, but
those who do come out are baseball
enthusiasts since childhood, and hard
to beat out.
After the manager's appointment,
Coach Harry Wolter, Miss Du Prau,
and Sergeant Moffitt (the old codger
in the equipment room) do their bit
to keep the senior manager busy
and careworn, but all of these to
gether don't approach the headache
brought on by old Jupe Pluvius.
Schedules Games
All of fall quarter and part of
winter quarter find the manager
scheduling practice games for both
frosh and varsity nines; the league
games are taken care of by the Fac
ulty Athletic Committee.
Then come the winter rains. By
this time you're acquainted with the
rdins in this district. Picture your
self as senior baseball manager.
Rain Upsets Plans
Stanford is to play Kenneally's
Seals Tuesday at 3:30, but there has
been a downpour Sunday and the
field is soft Monday when you and
Harry Wolter look it over. But a
stiff breeze has whipped up, and you
plan to play the game as scheduled,
so you get permission from Miss Du
Prau to place a call to the city for
an umpire from an agency there.
During the night another rain falls,
so you cut your 8 o'clock to get
Harry down to look at the field with
you. You get the Grounds Depart
ment officials to check with you, and
then you all look skyward. "Your
guess is as good as mine," says the
first one to speak.
• More Worry
So you wait a couple of hours un
til you have a free period and again
whip back to the B.A.C. Still not
certain, you fill out phone slips to
cancel the game and the request for

traveling cxpen.se has been guaran- |
teed to Kenneally, and must be paid j
whether the game is played or not, j
you'll save something in your own j
team expense if the game is can- I
celled.
In the meantime, no less than a!
dozen players have called to see if!
the game is ot be played. So has [
Don Liebendorfer. So has The Daily, j
Very reluctantly, after already hav- j
ing built up your publicity at great j
length, you say, "No."
and umpire, but shiver when you J
think of the agency's reaction and j
the office manager's attitude on the
phone bill and guarantee. Although ;
Those who think the senior base
ball manager has a cinch job—sitting
down to keep scores on games, tak
ing a lot of fancy trips with the
team, earning and wearing a Block
S, and other pleasures and ostenta
tions of those on the in—had better
look twice.
