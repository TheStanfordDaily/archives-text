# Price To Rely On Tall Men Against Cards
## Bunn Will Start Regulars In Third Cal Contest; Ailing Indians Return 
### J. O'DONNELL 
Clarence Merle Price's University
of California basketball squad is go
ing to rely on height, and plenty of it,
to turn back the horde of Stanford
Indians who will invade Berkeley
Friday night.
According to latest reports from
over Berkeley way, Price has shifted
6-foot 4-inch center Bob Chalmers
to Bob Duffy's forward position so
that he can fit Chet Carlisle, who
also ranges 6 feet 4 inches skyward,
into the line-up at the center post.
Price Sports 6-footers
So when Cal's prides and joys face
John Bunn's laughing boys on Fri
day, they'll be sporting three six
four men, Chalmers, Carlisle, and
"Cow" Herwig, plus a six-two and a
six-one combine in the form of Don
Jensen and Ray Balsley, respec
tively.
Meanwhile, here on the campus,
Coach Bunn, figuring that just be
cause his lads have twice turned the
trick against the Bears this year,
there's no reason for them to take the
Friday night game lightly, made
them sweat blood last night in a
gruelling 45-minute scrimmage.
Regulars To Start
Dinty Moore, who turned in a pair
of masterpieces last Friday and Sat
urday nights against U.C.L.A., again
dominated the play.
Bunn expects to start the old guard
against the Bears, with Turner and
Luisetti at forwards, Stoefen at cen
ter, and Captain Moore and Calder
wood at guards, since Turner's arch
ailment has vanished completely, as
far as his play is concerned, and
Jack Calderwood's affliction doesn't
seem to be bothering him a great
deal.
