i DRUM, THUMB
; HUM, SCRUM

Yesterday Slants went on a tear
! about rugby and how it's played, in
• part, but only the shin-kicking stage
I was reached—the scrum.
Now scrum is just what it sounds
like, scrum. Half of one team gets
j into a head-huddle with half of the
i other team, the wing of one of the
outfits rolls the ball down the alley
between the two lines, and then—
scrum. It's all very simple.
In case you're not clear as to how
the teams line up in that huddle, let
me copy a simple diagram employed
by Gordy Frost in January last year,
when he went about explaining
rugger., It's sort of an annual af
fair, you see. The way he explained
it was this:
oo o o
q o o
V/ X X X
ZY Y Z
In this diagram the G's are the op
posing scrum, opposed in the three
four method, as are Stanford's men.
The W is Stanford's wing forward,
the ball-roller-inner; the X's are the
front-rankers, the Y's are the rear
rankers, and the Z's are the break
aways.
When W tosses the ball in the
trough, the front rankers try to
"heel" it back through the scrum to
their backfiekl men, who are not
shown in the diagram. When the
backs get the ball, the team is off to
the races. In case the opponents
control the ball in the scrum, the
breakaways and wing forwards de
ploy as the defensive wall against
the oncoming backs.
The single halfback is directly be
hind the scrum; when he gets the
ball, he passes it back to the man
directly behind him, the "first five."
From there the play is fairly open,
with the eventual aim being to get
it to the wing, the scoring player.
The other backfield men are the sec
ond five, the center, left, and right
| three-quarters, and the fullback.

IT'S QUITE A
FRATERNAL GAME

When a ball goes out of bounds,
| there is performed what is known as
j the lineout. The scrum lines up In
dian file, crosswise to the sideline,
while one of the men tosses the ball
over his head to them. The forwards
jump for the ball, and pass it to the
backfield, have an informal scrum, or
start a dribbling rush.
This all sounds very silly, but it is
much easier to understand if one is
looking at a game.
