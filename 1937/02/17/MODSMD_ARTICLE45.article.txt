# Alustiza To Coach Sacramento High
## 
### 
Frank Alustiza. brawny Basque
who for three years was one of the
headlining "Vowing Sophs" in coast
football and is now an assistant
Stanford coach, was named head of
the department of physical education
and football mentor at the newly
built Sacramento High School Mon
day night.
Alustiza suffered an injured eye in
the third game of his senior year,
against U.C.L.A. that barred iiim
from further play for Stanford. Be
fore his injury he was one of the
big three sophs in the Indian back
field, with the immortal Grayson and
Bones Hamilton. A strong plunger
and magnificent blocker, the owl
eyed one also did the punting.
Alustiza's appointment follows
that of Larry Rouble, three-year
guard of the same Vowing Sophs,
who was awarded a contract to
coach at Phoenix High School next
year.
Penalties come principally for
holding on to the ball when you are
tackled, or for being offside. That
offside penalty rule is very compli
cated, but it can be best interpreted
by saying that every player is offside
if he is ahead of a team member who
has possession of the ball. Those who
are offside are not eligible to advance
the ball until they are again onside.
It takes much more space than
two little sports columns to even
come anywhere near explaining the
game — you know, they write com
plete books on the rules alone. But
that doesn't make much difference to
a sports writer.
The easiest way to get the hang of
rugby is just to go out and watch the
team play some Saturday. The boys
engage U.S.F. here this week-end.
Come out and look on.
