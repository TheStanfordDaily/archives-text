# Papoose Quintet Favored To Defeat Cal Cubs Friday
## 
### 
For the special benefit of all those
basketball fans who are following
Stanford's undefeated Papooses
around the various hardwoods, and
who believe in the all-importance of
comparative scores, notice is hereby
given that the Papoose quintet is a
decidedly better team than the Cal
Cub five.
Both teams have met the strong i
T iwell High outfit this season, and
L.n,. have won. The Papooses came
out on ion, 32-23, while the Cubs
barely edgeu o t Lowell by virtue of
a last minute rally, ;jB-32.
For the benefit of tho.se who com- I

pare teams by their ability to play
basketball, it should be noted that
the Papoose quintet, in their first
meeting with the Cal Cubs, soundly
thwacked the boys from Berkeley by
better passing and much more ac
curate shooting.
Thus, when they get together for
the second Little Big Game next Fri
day night, the Papooses will be fa
vored to come out on top, especially
since ace forward Leon Lafaille has
returned to the Stanford line-up.
The frosh will again be under the
tutelage of Mentor Wytze Gorier
Thursday afternoon, at which time
he will return from a ten-day stay
at home, recovering from a severe
attack of the mumps.
