### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 15 (UP).—Af
fairs in the ranks of the Yankee
holdouts took a fresh turn—and for
the holdouts perhaps a most alarm
ing turn—Monday night when Col
onel Jacob Ruppert let it be known
in unmistakable terms that, instead
of relenting, he planned to make the
going even tougher for his unsigned
players as time wears on.
All players on the Yankee roster,
he said, will have to sign at the last
offer made them before he, himself,
leaves New York for the South with
the first squad.
