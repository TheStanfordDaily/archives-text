WHILE raindrops were beating the tempo, the
opening date for Stanford's new Memorial
Theatre has been rythmically marching on—
early in April, early in May, now early in June.
Originally scheduled to first swing its new
doors for the Alumni Conference in April, next
to be ready for the spring show in May, now
those close to construction admit that plenty
of speed burning is in store if Stanford's little
gem is to be ready before seniors graduate.
But speedburning or not, that MUST be done,
for Stanford owes to those seniors who plugged
doggedly against stubborn forces and finally
overcame them, the chance to ring up Stan
ford's first curtain. The Whitmores and Browns
have credit due. It should not be forgotten.
However, lest the situation be judged more
acute than factually it is, there is room for ex
planation as to the state of construction to date.
Interior work is far more advanced than exter
nal evidence would indicate. The giant elec
trical switchboard is nearly ready to go, tubes
have been installed, the console will soon be in
place, and curtain and seats are near completion
in far away factories. Heating, ventilating, and
cooling machinery will be ready for work soon.
Accoustical plaster is now drying.
It's the exterior that has construction engi
neers stymied. Their work has been pyramidi
cally blocked—wet concrete made plastering
impossible, without plaster roof tiles couldn't
be laid, and so on. But sunlight should soon
end those difficulties.
Three months construction time remains. With
fair weather, and efficient management it can
be done. To avoid the anti-climax of a fall open
ing, let that be so.—G. F.
