# What Cheap Publicity?

California, the citadel of cheap publicity
stunts, is griping about a "cheap publicity
stunt."
Last Saturday officials of the San Francisco
Bay Exposition planned a mock burial of the
Stanford-California axe, hoped it would "sym
bolize good will of the colleges of the world."
But rain—and cries across the water—prevented
the ceremonies.
Whatever the brasshats at the Fair had in
mind, to the brasshats at Cal the whole affair
was—at least in the columns of the Call Bul
letin—"cheap publicity and the students of
California will never allow it."
The proposed axe "burying" was, admittedly,
a clever scheme on the part of fair officials to
get newsreel and newspaper publicity for the
coming exposition. But a harmless one, and one
which would help make the public more San
Francisco-conscious.
Earlier this month readers of the Chronicle
learned that California co-eds were taking up
pipe-smoking. At least once every year the
same fact is publicized in city newspapers. Be
cause such "stunts" do no one any good and
are purely fabrications, they come much closer
the criterion of "cheap publicity" than does the
exposition's mock burial.—D. B.
Some people never change their minds,
bccause their intellectual wardrobe is so
skimpy they wouldn't have anything to put
on if they did,—Woodrow Wilson
