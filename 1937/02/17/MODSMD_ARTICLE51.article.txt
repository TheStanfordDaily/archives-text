PROFESSORS and students who often grouse
about the lies printed in the San Francisco
Examiner were busy Monday morning repeat
ing as fact a lie of their own making.
They had isolated a single paragraph of
the Examiner's sensationalized account of The
Daily's "Gasoline and Alcohol Do Mix" editorial,
believed it, and embroidered upon it.
The paragraph stated that the Examiner had

as its source advance proofs from the Daily.
Their embroidery was that The Daily had
peddled the editorial to the Examiner for per
sonal publicity.
The Daily does not peddle copy for any
reason. The editorial was made available, along
with the rest of The Daily's copy, to accredited
correspondents covering the campus.
The Daily does not "push" a certain story to
the correspondents, nor does it ever on its own
initiative offer a certain story to outside sources.
Until people are educated, anything is
likely to happen. When people really think,
they do not want war.â€”Lady Astor, member
of British parliament
