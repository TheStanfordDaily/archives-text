# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
IT IS a fact well known by anyone who will stop long
enough to listen, that Our Hasher never betrays
confidences. So when Consumer's Research quite
bravely comes out with the statement that "there is
some doubt about alcohol being a food," and marks this
information not confidential, I think that this is some
thing that should be passed on to my consumers.
In its January Research Bulletin the CR gets right
to the bottom of the matter of "Alcohol and Its Effect
on Man," citing from 57 different references. After a
deliberate weighing of the pros and cons of alcohol as a
food for 500 words, CR decides that "much depends
upon circumstances and conditions."
After 1500 more it says:
"Physiologically, alcohol depresses the central nerv
ous system; irritates bodily structures; lessens visual
acuity, affects kidneys and liver; reduces efficiency and
accuracy in work; raises blood pressure; interferes
with vitamins and enzyme action; it stimulates gastric
acidity; it Is least effective as a poison when taken with
meals; when used moderately it has a certain social
value; taken immoderately, all its physiological effects
are bad and serious."
The Bulletin lists among its 57 references a Mr.
C. J. V. Pettibone, if you please, and the Jc»jmal of
the American Medical Association 47 times, and also
makes note of the fact that the Pai'is Academy of
Medicine throws its full weight against the cocktail
habit, "especially when the stomach is empty." "It may
lead to digestive and other disturbances," says the Paris
Academy of Medicine.
About gasoline and alcohol and the Devonshii'e
Country Club, however, the Consumer's Research said
not a word.
A very important phase of our national mental
health is as yet untouched by probing or scholarly re
search. I refer to "Consumers' Research Effect on the
College Professor."
With such statements as "a frequently worn and
important type of women's lingerie is the slip," CR
seems to question even the very foundations of family
life itself. As a result of its biting agnosticism and
its penchant for finding out that great big corpora
tions are entering into conspiracies to put poison into
breakfast food of struggling little assistants in instruc
tion and research, a heavy pall seems to hang over the
Quad the days that the CR confidential bulletins come
out. Despite these bitter revelations, though, the profs
all sneak into the cubicles and with Faustian despair
cut themselves off from all the old accepted faiths. In
these cynical times when you can't believe a full page
color ad in the Satevepost, who can trust the mosaic
on the front of the Memorial Church?
One professor really plunged to the pit of despair,
though, when he cut himself off from all standards and
ceased to believe even in the CR.
He is in the history department, and writes long
books on what the references say happened in the
Balkans, and who were the kings of the Byzantine
empire and who were queens and who were their
friends.
He wanted to buy a car, so he looked it up in the CR,
discovered that the Dredge was the best in his price
class.
He explained this quite fully to his compatriots in
their afternoon Cellar seminar, so when he appeared
after a few days with a new Ouchmobile, he was
twitted by his friends.
"I thought the Dredge was supposed to be the best
buy according to Consumers' Research," twitted they.
"I bought the Ouchmobile," said the historian, "and
cancelled my subscription to Consumers' Research."

makes note of the fact that the Pai'is Academy of
Medicine throws its full weight against the cocktail
habit, "especially when the stomach is empty." "It may
lead to digestive and other disturbances," says the Paris
Academy of Medicine.
About gasoline and alcohol and the Devonshii'e
Country Club, however, the Consumer's Research said
not a word.
A very important phase of our national mental
health is as yet untouched by probing or scholarly re
search. I refer to "Consumers' Research Effect on the
College Professor."
With such statements as "a frequently worn and
important type of women's lingerie is the slip," CR
seems to question even the very foundations of family
life itself. As a result of its biting agnosticism and
its penchant for finding out that great big corpora
tions are entering into conspiracies to put poison into
breakfast food of struggling little assistants in instruc
tion and research, a heavy pall seems to hang over the
Quad the days that the CR confidential bulletins come
out. Despite these bitter revelations, though, the profs
all sneak into the cubicles and with Faustian despair
cut themselves off from all the old accepted faiths. In
these cynical times when you can't believe a full page
color ad in the Satevepost, who can trust the mosaic
on the front of the Memorial Church?
One professor really plunged to the pit of despair,
though, when he cut himself off from all standards and
ceased to believe even in the CR.
He is in the history department, and writes long
books on what the references say happened in the
Balkans, and who were the kings of the Byzantine
empire and who were queens and who were their
friends.
He wanted to buy a car, so he looked it up in the CR,
discovered that the Dredge was the best in his price
class.
He explained this quite fully to his compatriots in
their afternoon Cellar seminar, so when he appeared
after a few days with a new Ouchmobile, he was
twitted by his friends.
"I thought the Dredge was supposed to be the best
buy according to Consumers' Research," twitted they.
"I bought the Ouchmobile," said the historian, "and
cancelled my subscription to Consumers' Research."
IT IS a fact well known by anyone who will stop long
enough to listen, that Our Hasher never betrays
confidences. So when Consumer's Research quite
bravely comes out with the statement that "there is
some doubt about alcohol being a food," and marks this
information not confidential, I think that this is some
thing that should be passed on to my consumers.
In its January Research Bulletin the CR gets right
to the bottom of the matter of "Alcohol and Its Effect
on Man," citing from 57 different references. After a
deliberate weighing of the pros and cons of alcohol as a
food for 500 words, CR decides that "much depends
upon circumstances and conditions."
After 1500 more it says:
"Physiologically, alcohol depresses the central nerv
ous system; irritates bodily structures; lessens visual
acuity, affects kidneys and liver; reduces efficiency and
accuracy in work; raises blood pressure; interferes
with vitamins and enzyme action; it stimulates gastric
acidity; it Is least effective as a poison when taken with
meals; when used moderately it has a certain social
value; taken immoderately, all its physiological effects
are bad and serious."
The Bulletin lists among its 57 references a Mr.
C. J. V. Pettibone, if you please, and the Jc»jmal of
the American Medical Association 47 times, and also
makes note of the fact that the Pai'is Academy of
