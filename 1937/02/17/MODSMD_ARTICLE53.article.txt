MAMA AND PAPA AND YOU
IT WAS in the fall of 1933 when you first wont away
to school. The whole family was down at the station
to see you ofT, all saying good-bye and telling you to
write every week and that you should be a good boy
and not to listen to dirty stories and not take any
cocktails no matter how beautiful she was and to study
hard.
When the train pulled out of the station, you went to
youi; berth and sat down and watched the rambling
shacks and barns and signboards and freight cars drift
through the mist that covered your eyes.
You said to yourself you wouldn't do any of the
things your mother had warned you against, that you
would be a good boy, that you would write every
week and tell her what was going on, that you would
stay out of bars.
Four years have gone by since that time and you
are a senior in college.
During those four years you have been growing up.
curiously and uninformed. You wanted to know what
made the world go round.
You wanted to know,
you found out
and you were ashamed of yourself.
When you got around to writing home, somehow
you never could quite tell mama how drunk you got
last week-end, how that girl wanted to marry you,
how you wrecked your car and how many times you
had been to the city. You also said your studies weren't
so hot, but that you felt certain they would be all
right by the end of the quarter. You never knew how
your studies would get to be all right, but that didn't
matter.

You are now faced with two alternatives. Either
your parents are too dumb to figure out what you
have been doing while you have been away at school,
which, of course, you would never admit because you
love your parents.
Or you can face the other proposition, namely:
that they know everything you have been doing,
which once again you would never admit because your
parents love you.
We all seem to be in a rather tipsy boat, not know
ing which side to jump to next, but maybe by the
time we graduate we will have learned enough to fig
ure some way out of our difficulties.
I hope my family never finds out about me. For
that matter, 1 hope I never find out about myself.
Life would be terribly dull.
