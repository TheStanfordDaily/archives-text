The Editor, Sir:
"FROSH WOMEN DUNKED IN
LAKE": Concerning this article in
Monday's Daily. 1 am the fellow who
overturned that Ruble canoe. Here
with 1 wish to apologise to the ladies
for the "dunking."
The "Dippy," however, misstated
the facts. I was paddling on the lake
and saw the Roble canoe with two
pretty girls. As many roughs do on
this friendly campus, I said, "Hello,"
and paddled closer. They were an
noyed at my presence and said in
cold non-campus like fashion, "We
haven't been introduced." After
placing my hand on the stern of their
canoe —with no intention of tipping
it—l paddled away and kept my dis
tance. They summoned Gill and an
other fellow to tip me in. After one
failure to catch my canoe, I beached
it on the lee shore. They tried to pull
my boat into the lake and I splashed
them—BUT STRUCK NO ONE.
Gill got on land and we went into
the water when he tried to put me
in.

Then came the fateful episode with
the ladies' canoe. Ed Hoover, NOT
808 HOOVER, gave me a week sen
tence from the lake —NOT FOR
EVER. May I state here, as far as I
was concerned, there were no hard
feelings and none were meant. I am
sorry if there were any. I sustained
a broken watch, fountain pen, ruined
corduroy shirt, and Ed Hover's sen
tence. The girls got wet with prob
able injury to their clothes.
The lake is a wonderful place for
the campus to play and I wish to
keep it so as much as anyone. I am
regretful of any of my actions to
the contrary.
