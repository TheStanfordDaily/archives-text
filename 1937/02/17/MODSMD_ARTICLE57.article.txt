### Clipped by ALLEN DRURY 
"GONE WITH GRACIE"
r is the night of nights, as
far as the War between the
States is concerned. Full of memo
ries of the old plantation, moonlight
and Four Roses, Grade Allen offers
a play entitled, "Gone With Gracie."
The effervescent nit-wit plans to
dramatize episodes from Margaret
Mitchell's story of Scarlett O'Hara
of Tara, but has decided to change it
somewhat ... it seems Tony Martin
would look better in silk pants and
ruffles, so "Gone With Gracie" takes
place in England during the Wars of
the Roses, and the cast includes
Court Trumpeter Henry King and
Head Sword-Bearer George Burns.
. . . Questioned regarding the play's
authenticity, George remarked rath
er wearily that Gracie lives in a
world of her own . . . the program
comes over KSFO, 8:30 to 9 o'clock.

Man.ya Roberti, sister of come
dienne Lyda, will sing a Russian
swing-song for Fred Allen when
she makes a guest appearance in
Town Hall Tonight . . . She was
born in Vienna, and made stage ap
pearances with Lyda in Russia,
France, Germany, and Egypt before
coming to this country . . . Mighty
Allen Art Players are due to offer
a pre-Washington's Birthday broad
cast entitled "Tory of a Red-Coat,"
and Portland and friends will be on
deck as usual . . . The Allen-Benny
feud goes merrily on its way, and so
far nobody has played "The Bee."
Gladys Swarthout, mezzo-soprano,

oilers the second of her now series
of weekly programs on NBC-Hod
Network at 7:30 . . . She an
nounced last week that she would
sing your favorite song if you would
send her a sheet-music copy of it.
. . . Besides singing it, she will au
tograph it and return it to you.
