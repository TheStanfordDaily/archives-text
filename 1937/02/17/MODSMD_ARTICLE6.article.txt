# CAR GOLFER FINED
## Driver Cuts Up Green 
### 
A John Doe, from the Kappa Sig
ma house, added a few more hazards
to the Stanford golf course last Mon
day when he drove his car across
fairways and greens. His automo
tive golf game will cost him a pret
ty penny, Men's Council decided
yesterday.
The incident occurred when Doe,
with a girl companion, was driving
along a road adjacent to the golf
course. For some reason his car
slipped off the road and onto the
golf fairway.
Hole Flags Used
Hoping to get out of the muddy
ground, John continued on his way,
cutting deep into some greens. His
car finally got stuck. So he and the
girl got out, left the car there as a
new bunker, and began to walk
home. On the way they practiced
javelin-throwing with the hole flags.
Gordy Davis appeared on the
scene, so yesterday Men's Council
took up the case of Mr. Doe. Hoping
to enforce traffic rules, the Council
fined Doe a heavy "green fee" for
the damages done, suspended his
campus driving privilege for the rest
of the quarter, and gave him 15 hours
to work off at the Convalescent
Home.
Car Still There
As a towing truck would only ruin
the golf course more if it attempted
to get the car out now, Council de
cided the auto would have to remain

on the course until the ground dried
up.
Men's Council also decided at their
meeting yes-terday to give close at
tention to parking at the Library.
With the recent rains, and construc
tion of the Cubberley Education
Building, the parking problem has
become rather complex. Students
should avoid double parking, and
blocking up the paths, staled Roy
Anderson, chairman of Council.
