# Farm May Get Hetchy Line From PWA
## S. F. Supervisor's Board Approves; Negotiations For Right-of-Way Begin 
### 
The vision of Hetch-Hetchy water
for the Farm draws nearer to reali
zation as negotiations begin for
right-of-way for the necessary pipe
line along El Camino Real from Red
wood City.
According to the proposal ap
proved by the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors, a 36-inch branch of
the main Hetch-Hetchy line will
bring drinking water to the Univer
sity, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, -and
smaller towns in the district.
Grant Delayed
Only obstruction to actual com
mencement of the project is the de
lay in getting a $117,000 grant from
the federal government. Applied for
last month, the PWA appropriation
is expected within the next 30 days
by J. F. Byxbee, Jr., Palo Alto city
engineer.
Byxbee said that Palo Alto and
Stanford had tentatively arranged to
put $60,000 and $10,000, respectively,
into the $260,000 project. Other ap
propriations, he said, will be San
Francisco, $63,000; and Atherton,
$10,000.
Water Becoming Harder
Chief advantage of the change will
be a much lower mineral content
than the well water now used. The
present supply contains much lime,
alkali, and salt. The water is gradu
ally becoming harder, said Byxbee,
because of increased seepage from
the bay.
Although Hetch-Hetchy water will
be much softer, it may be turbid at
times, predicts the engineer. Also
some chlorine will still be necessary,
since the water contains a type of
bacteria which clogs the pipes. This
micro-organism, called crenothix,
dies when exposed to light and air,
but there is no basin across the bay
that is suitable for aerating the wa
ter. Chlorine is the only other al
ternative, if the pipes under the bay
arc to be kept from clogging.
S.F. Cost Lowered
San Francisco lowered its water
rates at the first of the year from 21
cents to 11 cents per 100 cubic feet.
This has made the project seem es
pecially desirable, since Stanford
would also pay these lower rates.
Well water costs only four cents, so
it may be used at first to augment
the Hetch-Hetchy supply.
According to Byxbee, however,
this arrangement will be by no
means permanent. He expects that
it will be less than five years before
Palo Alto and Stanford get their
water from a new filtration plant to
be built by San Francisco back of
San Mateo. When that is completed,
all of the communities served by
Hetch-Hetchy will get the uniform
San Francisco supply.
