### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17 (UP).
â€” The $35,000,000 San Francisco
Golden Gate Bridge experienced its
first major accident within three
months of its completion today when
a scaffolding collapsed and spilled a
crew of carpenters and painters into
the Golden Gate.
Ten men were believed dead, al
though only one body was recovered.
Three men saved themselves by
clinging to the bridge framework and
two others were taken alive from the
water after a 250-foot drop.
Casualties Listed
Dead or missing:
William Worth Bass, 37, married,
one child; Chris "Andy" Anderson,
34, married; Charles Lindros, 29,
married, one child; Fred G. Dum
mitzen, 24, single, body recovered;
Elbridge Hillen, 34, single; Terrance
Hallinan, 28, single; Jack Norman,
28, single; Noel Flowers, 22 single;
C. A. Anderson, O. Dester.
Rescued:
E. C. Lambert, 26; Oscar Osberg,
51; Thomas Casey. 58.
Hope Abandoned
All hope of finding any of the
others alive was virtually aban
doned after a six-hour search. The
only body found in that time was
that of Fred Dummitzen, San Fran
cisco carpenter, who was taken from
the water soon after the accident.
The others were carried out to
sea by the tide sweeping through the
Gate into the Pacific Ocean at the
time the scaffolding collapsed.
The crew of 15 laborers and car
penters on the scaffolding that fell
were engaged in removing forms
from the underside of the bridge.
No Warning
There was no warning, as the scaf
folding suddenly cracked and started
to disintegrate. It broke slowly, wit
nesses said.
The men clung to the steel and
timber framework until it struck
the net. As the net broke under the
10-ton strain, some let go and fell
directly into the water.
Three inquiries will be launched
into the accident, the first one of
serious nature experienced on the
span during the three years of con
struction. The state industrial ac
cident commission, the Coroner of
San Francisco county, and the bridge
authorities will conduct the investi
gations.
