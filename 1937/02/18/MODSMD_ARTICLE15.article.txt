### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).—
Inability to obtain records today
handicapped the Senate civil liber
ties committee in its investigation of
labor espionage conducted by Gen
eral Motors Corp.
Balked last week by refusal of
the famous Pinkerton detectives —
paid $800,000 by G.M.C. to spy on
labor organization activity—to sur
render documentary evidence, the
committee discovered that the cor
poration had stripped its files of all
labor relations data.
