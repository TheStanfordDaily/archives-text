# Life Ends For Fire Engine 13
## Death, As It Must to All, Comes to Farm Jilloppi 
### 
Aged fire engine No. 13, for years
public relations delegate of the Stan
ford fire department, passed into
oblivion yesterday morning, when
Corporation Yard men dismembered
it.
Brilliant No. 13 was an institution
at all home football games from the
earliest days of the University until
recent years when advancing age
forced its retirement. Stripped of
its equipment, which was transferred
to a sporty successor, the historic
engine stood dejectedly behind the
fire house until some two weeks ago,
when tradition-conscious hosemen
took it out for an auld lang syne
spin.
Evidently overcome with emotion,
or perhaps piqued at their patroniz
ing attitude, No. 13 stopped firmly
somewhere north of Lagunita and
positively refused to be coaxed into
starting again. Dragged home by the
scruff of the neck, it was again ex
iled, and yesterday, the wreckers
of the Corporation Yard fell upon it.
Motor, lights, and wheels have been
removed, and pnly the battered skel
eton remains.
Thus passed No. 13, campus tradi
tion and old grad. Some have sug
gested for an epitaph: "Its name was
writ in water."
