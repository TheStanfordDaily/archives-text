# 'Hold A Happy Job,' Advises Prof. Strong
## Guidance Test Explained By Farm Psychologist 
### 
Which will you have—full dress
affairs or solitaire at home? And
how do you feel about presidential
polls, floor walkers, bible study, and
undertakers?
Your answers, Dr. Edward K.
Strong, Jr..Stanford psychology pro
fessor, said yesterday, may have a
definite bearing on your ability to be
"happy though working," according
to United Press.
Dr. Strong told the Congress on
Medical Education and Licensure at
Chicago that happiness in whatever
profession you choose—doctor, law
yer, merchant—depends on personal
tastes and interests being similar to
those in the same profession around
you.

"I'm not interested in financial
success," he said. "I'm concerned
with personal happiness."
He said he had forked 13 years on
some 500 questions which he be
lieves every student should answer
before committing himself to a pro
fession. An elaborate statistical de
vice enables him to compare answers
to standards for nurses, teachers and
laundrymen. He has included 40
occupations for men and 18 for
women in his tests.
These are some of the questions
he asks. They are to be answered
quickly without stopping to think.
How do you feel about marine en
gineering, travelling salesmen, un
dertakers?
Do you collect postage stamps?
Do you like "rough house" initia
tions?
Would you rather be Caruso, Bur
bank, or Booth Tarkington?
Do you like hooknoses, pessimists,
sideshow freaks, spendthrifts and
men who use perfume?
Cops Don't Take
The psychologist said he estab
lished his standards in the 58 profes
sions after a careful survey of per
sonality traits of 250 selected mem
bers of each group. The system has
n't worked with policemen, he said,
but has shown signs of success with
others.
"I do all this work with a highly
developed statistical method and
several machines for correlating sta
tistical data," he said. "I try to avoid
preconceived notions of how things
ought to work."
Application of his tests in high
schools and colleges, he believed,
would do away with "misfits,' 'and
"we wouldn't have potential geol
ogists studying fur trapping."
His tests, he said, had nothing to
do with scholarship and little to do
with money making.
