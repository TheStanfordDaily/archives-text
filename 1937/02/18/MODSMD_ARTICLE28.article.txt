WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).â€”
Nations which start building war
ships beyond the standards of the
recent naval treaties can expect the
United States to match them in new
construction, Admiral William D.
Leahy, chief of naval operations, in
dicated today.
His comment followed reports that
the British government plans to lay
down three new battleships about
April 1, as well as two new aircraft
carriers and several cruisers. The
British program would give that na
tion five new battleships started this
year, or a 33 per cent increase in
strength in that category if old ships
are retained.
