WASHINGTON, Fob. 17 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt today sent to
the Senate the nomination of former
Governor Paul V. McNutt of In
diana as high commissioner to the
Philippine Commonwealth, a step
regarded in insular circles as likely
to facilitate progress of the islands
toward independent nationhood in
1946.
McNutt. if confirmed by the Sen-
I ate as expected, will succeed Frank
Murphy, now Governor of Michigan,
in the Manila post. Murphy took
leave of absence during the last
I election campaign to run for Gov
ernor and help bolster the national
Democratic ticket. The post actually
is held by J. Weldon Jones in capac
! ity as acting high commissioner.

Two members of Harvard Uni
versity medical board have divulged
that the brain waves in a cat corre
spond closely to those found in man.
