Way during the week of April 19,
will close for the week-end after the
Masque Ball on Friday, April 23, and
will hit a final climax when the
whole student body gathers on Con

for Labor Day and barbecue.

Treasurer will be in charge of all
of the financial details, as well as

men will supervise committees on
painting, toys, playground, and con
cessions. The entertainment chair
man, a newly created office, will
head entertainment at the Masque
Ball and jolly-up, in addition to La
bor Day and Bean Day.
Halaby announced last night that a
list will be kept in the A.S.S.U. of
fices during the remainder of the
week, and he asked that all students
interested either in working on any
of the committees or in serving a*
a sub-committee head, sign the list.
He asserted that there are still
several important positions to be
filled, and that, though almost fifty
students have already turned in
their names, many more will be
needed .
Dance Date Changed
All-University dance which was
approved Tuesday by Ex Committee
was switched to Saturday night,
April 27. after the U.S.C. basketball
game. The dance will be chair
manned by Rally Committee Head
T. M. McDaniel.
Formerly proposed for April 2f>,
the date of the dance was changed
iso as not to interfere with Toyon

i night.
