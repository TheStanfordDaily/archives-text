# F.D.R. Court Plan Okehed By A.F. of L.
## Green Announces Action Following Approval Of Non-Partisan League 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (U.R).â€”
Tlie executive council of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor tonight is
sued a statement officially approv
ing President Roosevelt's judiciary
reorganization program.
The council's action was an
nounced by President William
Green. It followed by one day simi
lar action by labor's Non-Partisan
League, a political organization
among whose directors is John L.
Lewis, head of the other faction of
organized labor.
Its action was announced after two
new proposals affecting the Supreme
Court, both involving amendment of
the Constitution, were introduced in
the Senate.
Two Amendments
The two constitutional amend
ments sought to deal with different
phases of the Supreme Court issue
raised by President Roosevelt in his
request for authority to increase the
high tribunal to 15 members. One,
by Senators Burton K. Wheeler,
Democrat, Montana, and Homer T.
Bone, Democrat, Washington, would
give Congress the power to over
ride Supreme Court decisions by a
two-thirds vote of both houses, but
only after a national election in
volving congressional seats has in
tervened so that the people have had
a chance to speak on the issue.
Compel Retirement
The other, by Senator Edward R.
Burke, Democrat, Nebraska, would
permit Supreme Court Justices to
retire at 70 and compel them to leave
the bench at 75, in each case pre
serving their $20,000 annual salary,
The extent to which the Supreme
Court issue has dwarfed others in
Congress was illustrated in the up
per branch when the Senate spent six
minutes passing a bill appropriating
$971,000,000 and then listened to a
two-hour speech by Senator Ken
neth McKellar, Democrat. Tennessee,
in which he defended President Roo
sevelt's proposals.
