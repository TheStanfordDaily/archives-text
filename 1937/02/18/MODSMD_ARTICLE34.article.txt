The Encina boys gave the Row
men an all-round beating last night
in the championship splurge for
League 1 and 3 titles. Encina 1W
took a tough game from D.K.E. to
the tune of 23 to 22, to win a three
way tie for first place with Encina
IYV, Phi Gamma Delta, and D.K.E.
11.
The Encina 3W quintet battled the
D.K.E. I squad for a 22 to 19 win for
League 3 honors. The three-way tie
in League 1 will be played off at a
later date.

Co-eds at the University of Wash
ington are planning for a course in
modeling and the art of wearing
clothes.
