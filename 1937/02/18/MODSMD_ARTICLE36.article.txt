# Scissors Only Tool Of Gifted Tin Snipper
## 
### 
One summer, Patty Bosqui, now a Robleite, was vacationing at a girls'
camp. In search of handicraft work to do, she discovered that it was fun
to create figures out of tin cans. With scissors she snipped away, and the
results were astonishing.
No one was more surprised at the discovery of this hidden talent than
Patty herself, who admits, "I am not really an artist; I can't draw a bit."

' For the work she contributes now
to Chappie, and which she did for
the County Fair sale, Patty uses
large sheets of tin. In explaining the
process, she uses just ordinary scis
sors (often her room-mate's) and
starts snipping. She never draws her
idea first.
The figures seem to be constructed
of many pieces wii'ed together, but
they are one tin strip. By bending
and shaping, the effect is achieved.
Snip, snip, snip! Her fingers work
the scissors at lightning speed, and in
no more than 10 minutes anything
from a cowboy to a ski jumper is apt
to take form.
The Big Game sCALp stickers
were also Patty's work, and after she
had made several table decorations
for Roble her fame spread to Gist's
ears.
Besides her tintypes and studying,
Patty hashes at Roble and works for
the Stanford Mothers' Club.
