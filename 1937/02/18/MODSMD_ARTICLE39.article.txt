# Workers Must Call For NYA Checks
## 
### 
More than 20 pay checks belonging
to N.Y.A. workers remain un-called
for in the Accounting Office, accord
ing to Mrs. Irene Coverley, director
of student employment. They must
be called for at once, or they will be
returned to the state office.
Undergraduate students on the
â€¢National Youth Administration are
requested to notify the Student Em
ployment Office immediately if they
cannot work their full 30 hours for
this period. Time slips are due in the
office weekly. Release cards for the
coming period are now available, and
workers may sign them now if they
so desire.
