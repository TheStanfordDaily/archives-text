# Chappie Sellers Shout Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning, otherwise
sane coeds will begin an all
day routine of shouting, "Chap
pie! Buy a Chaparral!" the
while waving a violently-tinted
magazine in the perspiring faces
of people rushing to their 9
o'clocks.
Contributors will include Nat
Lawrence, Billie Fisk, Jack
Boyd. Bob Hartmann, Ken Ov
erturf, Jack Scott, and sundry
others, all contributors to
Chaparral's March issue. The
theme is a general one, but win
ter sports come in for an im
portant plug.
