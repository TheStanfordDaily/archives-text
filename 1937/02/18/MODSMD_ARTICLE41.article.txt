# CAMPUS OPINION
## OFFENSE, BUT NOT INTENDED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
People who write to columns of
this sort usually bore me consider
ably, but I feel that in the matter to
which I refer, a little correction
might be useful. In the "From This
Corner" column of Friday the
twelfth, you discuss a proposed
"trailer church," and lead the read
ers to the conclusion that this vehicle
is to be carried about for four-a-day
appearances at village carnivals—
like a rnerry-go-round, shall we say?
Haven't you missed the distinction
between the Glad Tidings Temple
and the Salvation Army on the one
hand, and the Calholic Church on the
other? Certainly you forget the dig
nity of the latter institution. The
state of Washington is a state in
which there is a great deal of back
woods country, sparsely populated.
Has it occurred to you. Bob, that the
purpose of this "trailer church" is to
bring the Mass to those for whom it
is physically impossible to get regu
larly on Sundays to a town?
There will be no tambourines on
the trailer, and no stops will be
made where there is a church near
by. Thus the "novelty" idea is not
prominent in the matter. I base my
statements, of the truth of which I
feel confident, on my acquaintance
with Catholic practices, an acquaint
ance I imagine to be somewhat closer
than yours, Bob.
1 shall pass over the last three sec
tions of the story without comment,
for it amounts largely to personal
prejudice, doesn't it? I can, however,
suggest to you a corner in Palo Alto
at which you might stand at 7, 8:15,
10, or 11 o'clock of a Sunday morn
ing, and wonder if you were not
attending the first night of the opera,
so noticeable is the size of the crowd.
Some of God's houses do have box
office appeal, you see, Bob. If I
shouldn't be accused of personal
prejudice too, I should suggest that
you were really writing about the
decay of some denominations. But
that would expose me, like Susan, to
a series of letters which would be
futile and tiresome, and which I
shouldn't care to answer.
Please be more careful, and find
the facts next time, Bob.

No single faith or church was in
mind when the article referred to
was written. The idea of a trailer
church simply brought up the
question of the popularity of re
ligion. That such a question ap
peared so closely and intentionally
connected with the Catholic
Church is a regretted inadver
tency.—The Editor.

"trailer church," and lead the read
ers to the conclusion that this vehicle
is to be carried about for four-a-day
appearances at village carnivals—
like a rnerry-go-round, shall we say?
Haven't you missed the distinction
between the Glad Tidings Temple
and the Salvation Army on the one
hand, and the Calholic Church on the
other? Certainly you forget the dig
nity of the latter institution. The
state of Washington is a state in
which there is a great deal of back
woods country, sparsely populated.
Has it occurred to you. Bob, that the
purpose of this "trailer church" is to
bring the Mass to those for whom it
is physically impossible to get regu
larly on Sundays to a town?
There will be no tambourines on
the trailer, and no stops will be
made where there is a church near
by. Thus the "novelty" idea is not
prominent in the matter. I base my
statements, of the truth of which I
feel confident, on my acquaintance
with Catholic practices, an acquaint
ance I imagine to be somewhat closer
than yours, Bob.
1 shall pass over the last three sec
tions of the story without comment,
for it amounts largely to personal
prejudice, doesn't it? I can, however,
suggest to you a corner in Palo Alto
at which you might stand at 7, 8:15,
10, or 11 o'clock of a Sunday morn
ing, and wonder if you were not
attending the first night of the opera,
so noticeable is the size of the crowd.
Some of God's houses do have box
office appeal, you see, Bob. If I
shouldn't be accused of personal
prejudice too, I should suggest that
you were really writing about the
decay of some denominations. But
that would expose me, like Susan, to
a series of letters which would be
futile and tiresome, and which I
shouldn't care to answer.
Please be more careful, and find
the facts next time, Bob.

No single faith or church was in
mind when the article referred to
was written. The idea of a trailer
church simply brought up the
question of the popularity of re
ligion. That such a question ap
peared so closely and intentionally
connected with the Catholic
Church is a regretted inadver
tency.—The Editor.
The Editor, Sir:
People who write to columns of
this sort usually bore me consider
ably, but I feel that in the matter to
which I refer, a little correction
might be useful. In the "From This
Corner" column of Friday the

"trailer church," and lead the read
