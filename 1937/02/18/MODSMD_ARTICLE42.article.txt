# MAROON ASININITY

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the attack of the Chi
cago Daily Maroon on the A.S.U.
which was reprinted in this morn
ing's Daily I should like to express
my personal opinion. The Maroon's
criticism of the A.S.U. is in the same
class as criticism directed against a
man for not taking time to sweep his

house while a fire has just broken j
out in one of its rooms.
Or more directly, although it may !
be important to consolidate local i
governments to eliminate adminis- j
trative wastes, to adopt city manager |
plans in cities over 100,000. etc., it !
seems to me that a person has to be j
exceedingly insensitive or stupid or j
both to believe that these problems I
are anywhere near so vital and j
pressing as the problem of wretch- J
edly low living and working condi- j
tions with which groups like the
negroes, Southern tenant farmers, I
the California agricultural workers, i
and the Pennsylvania coal miners j
are continually faced, as the prob- J
lems of war and peace, academic
freedom, freedom of assemblage, and j
freedom of speech.
The smugness of the Maroon's at
titude is exceeded only by its com
plete assininity; to condemn the
A.S.U. for particular issues which it ;
has not taken up rather than on the]
basis of the issues which it is work- i
ing upon seems utterly absurd to me. j
Sincerely yours,
Leonard Pockman
