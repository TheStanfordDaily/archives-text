The Editor, Sir:
The Concert Series wishes to cor- j
rect a misleading statement in last j
week's front page editorial concern- j
ing the Nitery. The article would
lead people to believe that the Con- :
cert Series suffered a $1000 deficit
last year. On the contrary, last year, j
for the first time since anyone can I
remember, the Series had a surplus
of approximately $900. The total defi- !
cit may be $1000, but A.S.S.U. funds
were not needed last year for the'
Concert Series.
We have had several inquiries l
concerning this matter, and we hope j
this letter will serve to rectify any 1
misunderstanding.
