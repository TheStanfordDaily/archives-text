S.F. PAPERS—HERE
THEY ARE AGAIN
Well, if it was anyone other than
Luisetti, it probably wouldn't have
happened.
One of the San Francisco morning
dailies came out yesterday with a
big black splurge on the sports page
about how John Bunn and Dink
Templeton "clash" on Luisetti. Dink
thinks that Hank could do 6 feet 6
in the high jump this spring if he
had enough practice, which is a coy
way of saying that he thinks the
lanky lad ought to foresake the
Pavilion for Angell Field
John Bunn, on the other hand,
sees no reason why Luisetti, the
greatest basketball player he or a
lot of other people have ever seen,
should take up track and forget
about basketball. Even if Hank did
do 6 feet 6, which is at this juncture
still highly problematical, that would
still leave him out of the class of
Corny Johnson and Delos Thurber,
two Pacific Coast jumpers who are
pretty big potatoes in their sport.
Johnson co-holds the world record
at 6-9Vir, while Thurber is consistent
at 6-6 and is still only a kid, com
paratively speaking.
But that is getting off the subject.
Just because Hank Luisetti is the
person he is, he gets a lot of play
in publicity. There are conflicts just
like his going on down here all the
time, but none of the participants are
so well known as Hank.
The argument between Dink and
John is no argument at all—there is
no question about Hank's sticking
with basketball. But the metropolitan
papers give the thing a great over
play, with an enormous black head
line, just because Hank is Hank.
Mountains or molehills, anything for
a story, etc.
THE LONG AND
SHORT OF IT
Some time when you want a laugh,
just picture Tom Thumb Montgom
ery walking down the street with
Jimmy Coffis. They actually were
together yesterday, going down
Lasuen. Tom, all 6 feet 8 inches of
him, was walking; Jimmy, all 5 feet
6 inches of him, was practically
running.
