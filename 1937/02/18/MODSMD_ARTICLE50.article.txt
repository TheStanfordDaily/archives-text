# Card Cagers Work Defense To Perfection
## Redmen Prepare To Pull Claws of Golden Bears In Tomorrow's Battle 
### 
The University of California's
high-scoring forward, Ray Balsley,
and his fellow Bear basketeers will
have to do a lot of humping to run
up a big total for themselves tomor
row evening in Berkeley against
John Bunn's Cards.
That is, if the laughing boys from
the Farm have anything to say
about it. And if the laughers work
their defense against the Bears just
as they worked it against the second
string here yesterday, they'll have
plenty to say.
Boys Go to Town
Chief Engineer Bunn had the lads
out there for an hour and a half,
working exclusively on defense, and
were going to town. No less.
Then, for another three-quarters
of an hour the Injuns brushed up on
their quick breaks. "That," says
Mentor Bunn, "ought to keep 'em in
shape."
Bears Train Hard
Meanwhile, over in the Berkeley
Kills, California's Nibs Price was
working his charges with equal fe
rocity, and intending to start Bals
ley and Carlisle at forwards, Chal
mers at center, and Jensen and Cap
tain Herwig at guards.
Price was mighty pleased with
Herwig's 13-point performance last
Saturday against U.S.C., and expects
the big guy to do a lot more in the
way of stopping the Stanford for
ward wall than he has done on the
last two occasions.
