# Cards To Meet O.C. Mermen
## Champions Compete In Farm Pool Saturday 
### 
When the Olympic Club and Stan
ford tangle in Encina Pools Saturday
afternoon, every event will bring
mermen of national prominence to
the starting line.
Five were All-Americans in high
school. For the Winged O there will
be Ward Cox, breaststroke ace, and
Herb Brotman, sprinter. The Cards
will have Don Towne, breaststroker,
Roy Winkelman, diver, and Hal
Weatherbe, former distance star,
now revamped into a backstroker.
Art Rule, an N.C.A.A. champion,
is entered in the sprint. Rounding
out the championship entry list will
be Winfield Needham, A.A.U. champ
at 500 yards, who will be entered in
the 220 and 440.
A serious blow was dealt the Club
men when Dick Keating, star dis
tance man, announced his resigna
tion from the Post Street athletic
club. Up to the time of Keating's
resignation, the Club was conceded
the favorite position in Saturday's
meet. However, the affair can't be
called anything but a toss-up, ac
cording to Nort Thornton, head man
for the Indians.
In the opinion of Thornton, the
meet will probably be decided in the
final event of the day—the 400-yard
freestyle relay. Swimming in this
event for the Cards will be the same
foursome that shattered the San Jose
pool record last week—Clark, Sca
tena. MacKenzie, and Vibert.
In the diving Roy Kinkelman, soph
ace, will face the Card star of last
year — Tom Boothe. These two
springboard artists should put on
quite an aerial duel.
Thornton looks for the 100-yard
dash to be the headline event of the
day. Herb Brotman and Louis Dia
mond are the big guns for the Club,
and Dick Clark and Jack Vibert will
churn up the water in an endeavor
to put the Indians out in front in this
event.
