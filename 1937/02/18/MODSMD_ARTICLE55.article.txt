# All-Stars Beat Cards 8-7 Despite Holman's Homer
## 
### ART ALLEN 
Despite Captain "Red" Holman's lusty 370-foot home-run over the left
field fence with two men on in the fourth inning, and seventh and ninth
inning rallies which netted two runs each, Joe Gaddini's All-Stars defeated
the Stanford nine, 8-7, yesterday. Holman's blow was the first drive of a
collegiate batsman to clear the fence in the 10-year history of the Sunken

Diamond.
"Red" had a chance to be a double
hero when he came up with the
bases loaded and two out in the last
of the ninth, but he popped out to
the second baseman.
Fumbles Costly
Seven errors hurt the Cardinals'
chances, as only six of the runs off
the four Stanford pitchers were
earned. The main thrust of the visi
tors came while Weiershauser was in
the box in the fourth, two doubles,
two singles, and two, walks, scoring
four runs.
LaFranchi, Heagerty, and Linde
each collected two hits to lead the
Stanford attack. Farrell, ailing
shortstop, was replaced by Bob Bur
nett, Marin Jaysee transfer.
Slide Wrecks Ankle
Gaddini brought down a team of
minor leaguers, including Leo
Hughes, Les Prout, Dario Lodigiani,
Bob Cole, and Hermie Sick. His
catcher, Malinverno, sustained a pos
sible broken ankle while sliding into
second base in the fourth stanza.
Today the varsity tackles A1 Erie's
All-Stars and Saturday the post
poned game with Santa Clara will
be played here. Left-handers John
son and Killefer and Right-hander
Furman will hurl against the city
team today.
