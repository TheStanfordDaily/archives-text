POINTING with pride is a popular (but damn
ably trite) editorial pastime. But Stanford,
nevertheless, tritely points with pride—at itself.
Stanford is proud because without loud
screaming or hysterical rush, it collectively
handed the American Red Cross' flood emer
gency drive a neat $4,931 —roughly (and less
figuratively) five grand.
Perhaps in cold figures the sum is not im
pressive, but as compared with the support
given by larger universities it stands out strik
ingly. And what stands out with it is the fact
that roughly $1,100 came from an un-pushed
campus drive in which living groups gave
arbitrarily and without fight talk, definitely
proving that Stanford needs no King-Queen
contest, Masque Ball or any other flossy thing
to push its money drive—if that drive carries
its own "push."
Other source of Stanford funds was the U.S.F.
basketball game in San Francisco. To credit
the $3,731 contribution that came from that affair,
purely to Stanford would be unjust. Thousands
of outsiders dug for those "stones" and other
hundreds donated time and facilities that such
ball game might be played. But Stanford's ball
club drew the crowd.
The Stanford Board of Athletic Control would
have been recipient if the U.S.F. game had
been held in the Pavilion as scheduled rather
than in the City—it gave the hypothetical funds
it would have received.
Point is—Stanford was largely responsible for
some $5,000 which goes to near-drowned coun
trymen of the Ohio Valley who have now
shoved their turbulent river back into its ditch,
and are busy shoveling mud from their living
rooms.
Point is—Stanford points with pride.—G. F.

give them away. Man doesn't give unto him
self alone."—George H. Knox
