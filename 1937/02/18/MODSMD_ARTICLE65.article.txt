# Find the Cause

### 
ELEVEN people are dead, but reason why a
United Air Liner plunged into the bay off
Mills Field last Tuesday is "not ascertainable
at this time," the San Mateo County Coroner's
Jury decided Tuesday.
Experts declare that before the reason is
ascertainable, a motor of the death plane torn
loose in the crash must be dredged from the
floor of the bay and tested.
Investigation by several authorized boards
of inquiry shows that the rest of the ship was in
perfect mechanical condition, that the pilots
were in full possession of their faculties—that
every possible cause of the crash was lacking —
except a possible defect in the missing motor.
Sherlock Holmes used to say, "After I have
eliminated every solution to a crime save one,
that one must be correct, no matter how fan
tastic it seems."
And so it appears a strong probability that
the missing motor was the reason for the fatal
Mills Field crash.
Aviation can thank its luck stars if that prob
ability proves true. For the cause of few re
cent air accidents has been explained.
And because human beings are human, they
tend to regard the unexplainable with a sort of
superstitious fear.
Almost as important as averting future
crashes is determining the cause of the Mills
Field crash, so that people will realize that
aviation is not the plaything of a vengeful God,
but a perfectly human and understandable
mode of communication, subject to errors per
fectly human and understandable—and cor
rectable.

Change is nothing less than response to
life. —Edward Muslin Hulnio
