'JpHE CHI O Sit-Down and Shut-Up Strike is all over
but the shouting, but the germs of revolt against
the exploiting classes are now being sown in the Delta
Gamma kitchen, just across the street.
First warning of the trouble broke Monday night,
after notice of the termination of the Chi O disorders
was displayed extensively in The Daily.
The Deegee hashmen suddenly announced from
behind the kitchen door right after serving the main
course that they were striking and that the girls
would have to bring out their own dishes. Anxious
to please, the Deegees brought their dishes out and
stacked them neatly in the sink. Those that weren't so
anxious didn't get any dessert.
Rising to new heights for the occasion, the cook
decided to strike, too, saying he was getting d—d sick
and tired of putting candles in birthday cakes and he'd
be d —d if he'd put any d—d candles in any d—d
sake for any D—d—G—'s.
The gal with the birthday cake that evening had to
utilize the instruments of modern technological prog
ress by blowing out the fuses, as everybody sang
"Happy Birthday to You."
This unnerved the hashers, as they say that the
women were sitting their ground, and they are plan
ning harsh measures against the Delta Gammas.
The perpetual revolutionaries are seething among
their ponts and pants over a long list of grievances.
Their demands, as annotated, compiled, indexed, and
thrown together by Our Hasher narrow down to two
main points: breakfast for hashers, and front page in
The Stanford Daily, with pictures.
The story about the Kappa Sigma who put-putted
himself and his gal and his car onto the green at the
golf course must be amplified by the information that
one of the high officials in Breakers Club performed
substantially the same trick only one or two nights
before. Though the Breaker didn't get a lie on the
green, he was quite surprised to find himself slicing
into the rough. "'All the time," the Breaker and Rough
told rescuers, "I thought we were riding around the
Cactus Garden." Maybe he was, I dunno. But if this
midnight golf is getting to be a habit around here,
the B.A.C. better put in three-lane fairways, with
stop and go signals, and no crossing over double line.
One move and I'll jump.
The Econ department does funny things, but in some
respects, Classics is more classical. There is an emeri
tus professor in Classics who has a patrician nose, a
white mustache, a very nice house with long, long
shelves of books, and classic busts in every corner (but
no biers).
, This gracious gentleman makes the sociology prof
who bones up on detective stories before he gives an
ex look like a piker. Our Classics standby does not
waste his time with words, words, words, words. He
reads Dick Tracy, Detective, every morning. From the
aspect of the golden mean and the three unities, the
patrician nose and the white moustache report that
Dick has improved during the last year, because the
strip has kept, the women and the wishy washy, mushy
love angle out of it.
If they could only keep Dick out of it.
And off of the golf course, too.
