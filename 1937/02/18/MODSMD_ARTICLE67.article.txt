# BULL SESSION
## AH DIVINELY IGNORANT YUTZ! 
### 
"yUTZ is not lying dead out there on the lawn, even
though his feet are pointed skyward and his mouth
does hang open and his tongue does hang out as though
he died in excruciating convulsions. The mutt is mere
ly asleep.
When Mclntyre's dog died, O. O. wrote a very
beautiful piece on his little deaf pet, and when Yutz's
time comes, somebody should write this mongrel
hound dog's eulogy. But while the Daily is canoniz
ing purps that merely amble into classrooms and im
mediately yelp to be let out, it is high time that Yutz
has his day in print.
Yutz, I suspect, has a one-track mind, just like the
second-sti-ing catcher who used to wake up still asleep
on the sleeping porch yelling for the third basemen to
peg the ball down to second. Yutz is a whip-dip out
fielder. He snags practically anything on the fly at a
distance of 50 feet and absolutely everything at any
distance on first bounce. Everything about the dog
is explainable in terms of his magnificent obsession.
There was the time when he went to Russian Revo
lution lecture, found some fraternity brothers in the
back row, and then practically demoralized the class
when he went snorting down the aisle to retrieve a
rolled ball of paper the boys tossed out for him. And
then there was the time he shattered our faith in
Pavlov's famous trained-reflex dogs.
* * * *
What happened was that Yutz nosed out a tennis
ball in an open top drawer of a dresser. The trouble
was that he couldn't get his mouth over the edge and
hook his teeth into the ball. So we put him in a chair
in the middle of the room, then kicked him off and
put the chair near the drawer in the hopes that he
might fathom the connection between the two. That
didn't work, so one of us got up in the chair and picked
the ball out of the drawer. Yutz gleamed with under
standing just shrewd enough for him to paw at us and
not the drawer after we put the ball back.
Finally we put the chair near the drawer and Yutz
on the chair, whereupon he grabbed the ball imme
diately. Then we put the ball back in the drawer and '
waited for this clever animal who will fctch a ball at
command to demonstrate his perception. Completely
ignoring the chair, he put his nose in the drawer in the
same old useless way and whined with the same old
air of a baby who has grown too big crying for his big
toe to reach his mouth. The debacle was complete.
â™¦ * * *
But the point of all this has not been to tell dog j
stories but rather to point out wherein lies the divid- |
ing line between the hound dog and the human in Yutz. |
As long as he shags a ball and noses around the Union |
Cellar and knocks on the front door to be let in, he is i
just a dog with a few tricks that pass for a show of in
telligence.
But when he sneaks up on birds, tries to surprise
them and then conies back looking very fooled and
sheepishly disappointed, and when he runs around in a
circle with his nose up in the air barking at an air
plane some mile or so up, he drops all the mongrel
virtues of supreme tolerance, absolute indifference to
the momentous and complete appreciation of present,
comforts and delights, and assumes the human weak
ness.
He cannot and will not change his bull-headed no
tion of how to get what he can never get with his
present equipment. He barks longingly for that which
is completely out of his own league.
Ho even looks like an average human being, not
ugly enough to be beautiful, not beautiful enough to j
be outstanding, blessed only with a perpetual look of
miserable misapprehension of a .world that is traveling |
a universe above everybody's bead.
