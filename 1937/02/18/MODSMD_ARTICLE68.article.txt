STOLEN HOLIDAY
Stanford Theater
Kay Francis as the most spectacu
lar woman in Paris plays opposite
Claude Rains, who does unexpected
things, in Stolen Holiday. Lan Hunt-,

er and Alison
Skipworth respec
tively furnished
the romantic in
terest and the!
comedy.
In keeping with
his role of chief i

swindler in a large foreign ring,'
Claude Rains plays the man of •the!
world with a perfect, suave exte- \
rior, conveying with disinterested!
innuendo his realization of advanc- |
ing years.
Lan Hunter, with a smaller, though
no less important, part than usual, i
displays a new accent, too, too Brit- |
ish. With an apparently weak char- i
acter in his early scenes, he straight- j
ens out to become a real hero when I
Kay is troubled by her associations
with the swindlers.
Carrying the comedy burden, Ali
son Skipworth cordially hates Mr. 1
Rains, particularly since she asso- j
ciates him with the King of Spades'
in her deck of fortune - telling i
cards.
Kay Francis, too, tries to play the j
disinterested role in life: she will!
have nothing to do with love or men, J
but lan Hunter spoils her plans.
The picture is remarkably inter-1
esting despite the fact that the two'
leading characters are restrained;
even in scenes that might well be full I
of emotional interest. Only once'
does the leading lady give way to
her feelings: she tries to persuade
Hunter to let her go, to let her help j
Rains in his last extremity. He is un- !
convinced by reason and she no 1
longer controls herself, almost j
breaking into tears.
