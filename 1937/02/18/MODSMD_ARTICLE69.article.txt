prince of the Royal Family of the
Stanford Stage, now in New York,
come the following brief reviews and
comments on a few of the season's
shows. For what they're worth, wc
publish 'em.
St. Helena—One of those few and
far between shows which flopped
because it was just too good for pop
ular consumption. It dealt with the
last few years of Napoleon's life, in

loyal followers leave him; one by
one his hopes and ambitions do the
same. Maurice Evans uncannily re
sembled the Little Corporal, and
grew older and iller before our very
eyes—one of those beautifully bril
liant portraits we so seldom see. As
Robert Benchley said, after seeing
this play we wanted to go right out

and start an expedition to rescue
Napoleon.
Sweet River—"A new treatment of
'Uncle Tom's Cabin' " which would
have been better if the actors had,
and the audience hadn't, known the
Civil War is over. On second thought,
nothing would have bettered this
lemon, which lasted all of five per
formnaces. If we hadn't gone on a
pass we'd have sued.
