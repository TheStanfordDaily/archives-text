# New Walk Planned In Front of Cellar
## 
### 
The shrubbery in front of the
Union Cellar is being dug up to make
way for a new walk. That section
will be paved because the small side
walk, which is there now, is not wide
enough to accommodate the heavy
traffic at that point.
It has not been decided as yet
whether benches, flowers, or ivy will
be used to finish off the triangle left
after the paving is done.

delivery trucks, one Berlin butter
merchant grew real lawns atop the
