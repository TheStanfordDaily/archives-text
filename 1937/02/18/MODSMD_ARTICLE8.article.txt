# Rec Club Dance Attracts Crowd
## Students Insist on Riding Despite Short Distance 
### 
Recreation Club, Bill Ward's at
tempt to end the complications of
Stanford dating and the wrangling
over a nitery, danced through its
first meeting with apparent success.
Couples daneed between 7 and 8 last
night to a five-piece orchestra in Old
Roble Gym, which was decorated
with subdued colored lighting.
Ward regretted that most of the
guests arrived in cars, since he hoped
to attract couples that usually stay
home by having the dance within
easy walking distance of all points
on the campus. He announced, how
ever, that the Club will meet again
at the same time next week.
Tariff for the affair was 25 cents.
Success of the first edition was, guar
anteed by 30 charter members who
paid 50 cents for the first three
weekly dances. The "Rec Club"
was organized to provide inexpen
sive informal social activities on the
campus. No stags are allowed.
The club was heartily endorsed by
Ex Committee, but it will in no
way interfere with present plans for
the Union nitery. Ward, organizer
of the club, was the man who ini
tiated the ill-fated petition to force
the issue of the erection of a $10,000
nitery on the ballot in the last elec
tion.
