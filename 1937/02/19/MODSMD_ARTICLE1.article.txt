# Six Killed In Battleship Cannon Blast
## U.S.S. Wyoming Brings Tragic Cargo Into Port after Sham War 
### 
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 18 (UP).â€”A
gun explosion killed six men and
injured 10 aboard the battleship Wy
oming during Navy war games off
the coast today.
A fivc-inch gun exploded aboard
the old battleship at 11 a.m. while
she was engaged in maneuvers
with the fleet off San Clemente
Island.
The announcement came from Ad
rhiral Arthur J. Hepburn, command
cr-in-chicf of the U.S. fleet, in a
radio message to the harbor here.
'War' Maneuvers
The Wyoming had been maneuv
ering with other war vessels off
San Clemente Island for the past
few weeks. She had been due to
sail for San Diego tonight and re
turn here tomorrow.
San Clemente Island is about 60
miles south of here.
The 26,Q00-ton Wyoming, built in
1912, is one of the oldest battleships
of the Navy in point of service.
Used for training purposes the
past few years, the Wyoming was
brought to San Pedro several weeks
ago and attached to the scouting
force for the war games.
Temporary Flagship
War game maneuvers are secret,
but the scouting force, in which
the Wyoming "fought," usually op
poses the heavy battleship squadron.
The Wyoming is the temporary
flagship of the training squadron
scouting force of which Rear Ad
miral Wilson Brown is commanding
officer.
