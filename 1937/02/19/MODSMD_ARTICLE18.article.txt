### 
'Fascism in Spain has tripped itself upon the united resistance of all the
people," said Eugenio lino/.. Catholic editor, ,at a meeting of the American
Student Union yesterday afternoon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Imez and three other Spanish young people came to Stanford as members
of the Spanish Youth Delegation, which arrived in New York from Spain

♦early in December and has since i
been touring the United States in the j
interests of the loyalist government.!
Asking "How can it be a civil war'
if the whole Spanish people are!
fighting against foreign and mer- J
cenary troops?" Imez said that the '
present rebellion began "as a coup !
d'etat of the higher officers, aided j
by the fascist states of Europe. It is a j
totalitarian war of fascism against i
the civilian population, and it is not l
accident that, bombs fall first on the j
women and children."
'Democracy Defense'
Denying the charge that the civil j
war is between Fascism and Com- 1
munism, Imez said that the loyalist j
forces "are fighting for the defense
of democracy." In conclusion, he
said that "the basic struggle in Spain
is between the Christian, democratic
philosophy of life, and the pagan,
fascist philosophy of death." Imez
also gave greeting from the Spanish
Youth Delegation at a luncheon in
the Union, attended by 100 people.
Iluhne Speaks
Speaking in the afternoon, Pro
fessor Edward Maslin Hulme said
that "Stanford students, influenced
by the traditions of liberalism and
democracy of David Starr Jordan,
can be proud to give aid in spirit and
in deed to the Spanish people."
Hulme reported he had received I
news that Aurelio Espinosa, Harvard
teacher and son of the professor of j
Stanford's Romanic Languages De- '
partment, was in favor of the loyal- j
ists. Up popped younger brother |
Ramon Espinosa, Sigma Nu, hotly to |
deny this, saying Aurelio was on
General Franco's side.
'Be Seated!'
As argument between the two j
grew hotter. Hulme asked Ramon to j
be seated. This, he refused to do un- j
til the assemblage finally booed him ■
down, according to report.
The Caballero cabinet in Valencia
was described in an interview by
Luis Simarro, wounded militia bat- :
talion commander and member of j
the executive committee of the Unit- |
ed Socialist Youth, as "the scared :
union of the People's Front." Simar- i
ro predicted that the naval and land j
blockade of Spain, adopted by the
great powers and to go into effect on j
February 20, "will, if it is really en
forced. favor the Spanish govern- j
ment."
