# Cards Await Cal Tilt With Series Hopes
## Bears Plan Skyscraper Defense; Indians End Week by Bronc Game 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
At 8:15 this evening in Edwards
Gym in Berkeley, Coach John
Bunn's Jaughing Stanford basketecrs
will square off against Nibs Price's
University of California Bears in
the third and climactic contest of the
1937 Big Series.
The Cards have already made it
two straight on the Bears, and will
be out gunning with a vengeance for
the first Stanford Big Series victory
since 1921.
Trojans Meet U.C.L.A.
And from a more practical stand
point, aside from the sentimental
and emotional kick out of "just beat
ing Cal," Bunn's lads will virtually
have to turn tonight's tilt into a win
to keep their slim conference lead
over U.S.C.
The Trojans encounter Caddy
Work's U.C.L.A. Bruins tonight, and
should come through without a great
deal of trouble.
So, with a Stanford loss and a
Trojan win, the conference race
would again be tied into knots, as
each team would have seven wins
and two losses.
Regulars Will Start
Bunn will start his old guard of
regulars, with Hoopin' Hank Lui
setti and Handsome Howie Turner
at forwards, Art Stoefen at center,
and Captain Dinty Moore and
Spooks Calderwood at guards.
Paired off, on the California side,
against this tried and proven bunch,
will be five of the tallest men Coach
Price can get together: Ray Balsley,
Cal's high-scorer, and Chet Car
lisle at forwards, Bob Chalmers at
center, and Captain Bob "Cow" Her
wig and Don Jenson at guards.

Price Seeks Height
Nibs has shifted the 6-foot-4 Car
lisle to forward to supplant Boh
Duffy, who has been an in-and-outer
all season, in order to put a little
more of his height advantage under
the offensive bucket, though he will
have Duffy on hand to take over if
Carlisle shows signs of the incon
sistency that occasionally mars his
play.
During the week the Card mentor
has emphasized his defensive play,
although he did drill the boys pretty
hard on the quick break last Wed
nesday at practice.
Cards Meet Broncos
After attempting the California
hurdle tonight, Coach Bunn's kids
will journey back to the campus
where they will take on George Bar
si's Santa Clara quint on Saturday.
The Broncos have been enjoying a
moderately successful season thus
far, and are resting on top of the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Conference heap at the present writ
ing.
Bunn will very likely give some of
his second and third team members
a bit of action against the Broncs,
however, seeing as how U.S.C. is
coming a-visitin' a week hence with
an evil look in her eye. So Engineer
Bunn will be wanting to keep hi.s
big guns intact and ready to bang
hard next Friday and Saturday
nights.
The University of Minnesota re
cently introduced a new form of
penalty when 12 students were fined
15 credits for staging a pajama pa
rade.
