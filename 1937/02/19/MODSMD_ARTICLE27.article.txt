# Mickey Mouse And DEATH Wrote This Tale

### 
HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 18 (UP). —
Homer S. McFarland, 27-year-old
animator of the Walt Disney Studio,
today found the death which pre
viously eluded him as he penned the
sensations of a dying man.
He was found dead in his automo
bile into which were pouring car
bon monoxide fumes from the ex
haust. Yesterday he attempted sui
cide twice, but was stopped. A
workman revived him from a dose
of carbon monoxide poisoning. A
few hours later another workman
prevented his jumping from a high
water tank.
In his hand today was the follow
ing death-note, addressed to his
wife:
"I am going to write with
every grind of the motor —I'm ap
proaching death—terrible —not so
bad.
"My own I love you but I
cannot see the whole thing—l'm
perspiring —No —I wonder how
long I can keep this up—Love me
—I haven't got much time — No
hurry—Terrible — Do you realize,
my lamb, that I'm a bust? I'm per
spiring like hell. . . . Not much
time left. . . . Bigger and larger
world—l hope oh Clod—l need
love, not sickness ..."
