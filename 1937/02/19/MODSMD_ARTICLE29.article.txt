# Law School Court To Test Labor Act
## 
### 
Stanford Law School's fictitious
Supreme Court will test the validity
of the Wagner Labor Relations Act
Wednesday night, 7:30, in the Little
Theater.
Particularly timely because of the
United States Supreme Court's im
pending decision on the same act,
this session of the court will be open
to the public. Three San Francisco
judges will hear the arguments of
four Stanford law students acting
as counsels.
