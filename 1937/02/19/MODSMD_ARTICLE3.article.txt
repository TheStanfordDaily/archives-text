## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (U.R).â€”
John S. Farnsworth, who on Mon
day pleaded "nolo contendere" to
charges of violating the espionage
laws, was granted permission today
to appear in open court next Tues
day and request that his plea be
changed to not guilty.
Permission for the unusual pro
cedure was granted after the for
mer Navy Lieutenant Commander,
in a letter written from his jail cell,
asked District Court Justice James
M. Proctor for the right to change
his plea.
The judge will decide whether to
accept the new plea after the court
hearing next week, Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Samuel F. Beach said.
He may either give the defendant
permission to change his plea, or
hold him to the nolo contendere plea
under which he, in effect, admitted
guilt and refused to defend himself
against charges of conspiracy to
communicate naval secrets to Japan.
