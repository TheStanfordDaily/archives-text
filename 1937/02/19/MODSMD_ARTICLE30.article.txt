# F.D.R Plans Crop Insurance
## Aims at Stabilization Of Farm Supplies, Prices 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18 (UP). â€”
President Roosevelt called on Con
gress today for enactment of a fed
eral insurance program to protect
farmers and consumers against crop
disasters, with the pointed state
ment that "Our form of government
was never intended to prohibit eco
nomic and social reforms of this
character."
"A program of crop insurance and
reserves," the Chief Executive said
in a special message to Congress,
"should be part of the foundation of
agricultural policy which we are
building and which must include the
conservation of soil and water, bet
ter land use, increased farm income,
and alleviation of distress in rural
areas arising out of factors beyond
the control of individual producers."
Mr. Roosevelt endorsed as "prac
tical and socially desirable" a spe
cial committee's recommendations
for crop insurance coupled with a
storage plan which he believes will
tend to stabilize farm supplies and
prices through fat and lean produc
tion years.
