### 
MOSCOW, Feb. 18 (U.R).â€”Soviet
Russia's dreaded secret police, the
NKVD. successor to the OGPU and
the Cheka, today renewed their
drive on the alleged followers of
Leon Trotsky, arch-enemy of Dic
tator Joseph Stalin.
Madame Zaks, a sister of the late
Gregory Zinoviev, who was exe
cuted last August, was among those
arrested. She was charged with be
ing a Trotskyist and, presumably,
will face charges of counter-revolu
tion.
