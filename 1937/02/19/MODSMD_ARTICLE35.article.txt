Mary Astor, film star, admitted today
that she married Manuel Del Campo
after an early morning airplane
elopement to Yuma, Ariz.
Miss Astor admitted her marriage
—the third in her 30 years—shortly
after she arrived at Columbia stu
dios. Previously, at the Union Air
Terminal, where she landed in a
chartered plane from Yuma, she
declared authentic reports of her
wedding "were ridiculous."
Flew to Funeral
"I denied the marriage because Mr. j
Del Campo's father had died in Mex- I
ico City," said the auburn-haired
Miss Astor. "Immediately after the
ceremony was performed we drove
to Mexicali where he took a plane
for Mexico City to attend the funeral.
I flew back here."
Miss Astor said she met her hus
band at the home of Ruth Chatterton
last December. "We met many times
after our introduction by Miss Chat
terton and perhaps because of our j
common interest in motion pictures, I
a very grand friendship developed,
which became something more than
a friendship," she said.
Won't Talk
The actress had stalled off report
ers at the airport with flat denials of |
the marriage, refused to answer the
1 question, "Do you s still keep a
j diary?"
She made no reference to the re
! cent court battles with her second
husband, Dr. Franklyn Thorpe, dur
ing which he released the contents of
her love diary revealing her love
affairs.
"Manuel and I were faced with a
long separation so we decided im
pulsively last night to get married,"
she declared. "I'm sure we will be
| very happy."
