after announcement of England's
proposed $7,500,000,000 defen.se pro
gram, called in naval heads today to
discuss means of speeding American
naval consrtuction.
Mr. Roosevelt met with Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Charles Edi
son to consider the effects of Brit
ain's newly announced naval pro
gram and operations of the Walsh-
Healey Act which currently is de
laying the naval construction pro
gram.
The conference was called short
ly after Admiral William I).
chief of naval operations said that
the United States would maintain
its policy of maintaining "a navy
second to none."
Edison said Mi-. Roosevelt asked
him to .study the cfTect of Britain's
announcement on the American fleet
program and investigate the Walsh
' lealey Act situation thoroughly.
To Expedite Building
"We discussed expediting our gen
eral program of ship construction,"
Edison said.
As a result of the stniogent pro
visions of the Walsh-Healey Act,
government navy yards have found
no bidders to supply their steel re
quirements.
McGrady to Be Called

operations of the law during the next,
few days with Assistant Secretary of

law provides contractors supplying
the- government in lots of $10,000 or
more must maintain certain work
ing standards.

legislative action will be necessary to
remedy the situation. Edison said
he anticipated that America's ship
construction program -keels for two
battleships will be laid next sum
mer will be "both stimulated and
handicapped" by Great Britain's ac
tivity.
Great Britain, he explained, prob
ably wilt bid for raw construction
materials in this country. He said
such action would stimulate Ameri
can business and also serve to in
terest American manufacturers in
bidding on government contracts.

might possibly serve to make it more
difficult, for the American govern
ment to purchase materials for its
jivn ships.
