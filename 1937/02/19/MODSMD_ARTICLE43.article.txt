### 
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 18 (U.R). —
Health inspection of all persons en
tering California, sterilization of
mental defectives, creation of a bu
reau of venereal diseases to check
ihe .spread of infection:
These were some of the far-reach
ing recommendations made by state
legislators in their ultra-modern
drive to safeguard public health and
assure adequate hospitalization for
persons of less than moderate means.
Of outstanding interest to the leg
islators, who will reconvene March 1
lo begin acting on nearly 4000 bills,
was the general suggestion that
.something be done to curb the
spread of venereal diseases.
A group of assemblymen will sup
port a bill designed to create a state
bureau of venereal diseases which in
turn would establish clinics, dispen
saries and prophylactic stations.
All health authorities would be
required to report cases of the dis
eases, victims would be called upon
to reveal the source of their infec
lion and undergo treatment and in
spections.
Another bill would go much fur
ther toward establishing a definite
checking system by requiring that
everyone in the state be examined.
Those free of the diseases would be
issued a card, renewable annually.
Infected persons would be required
to receive regular treatments at state
clinics.
