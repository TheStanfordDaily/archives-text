BERLIN, Feb. 18 (UP). — Count
Friedrich Von Der Schulenburg,
German Ambassador to Russia, has
made "serious" representations to
ihe Russian foreign office regarding
38 Ceimans held without tiiai, it
was announced today.
Schulenburg also demanded per
mission for a representative of the
Embassy to interview the prisoners,
it was announced.
All apparently were involved in
the Russian government "purge" of
which the recent Moscow trial—that
brought death to 13 prominent Bol
sheviks and prison sentences to
four—was a part. Presumably they
were suspected of sabotage and es
pionage. The Germans were ar
rested last November and December.
