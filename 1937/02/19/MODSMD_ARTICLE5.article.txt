# 50 Years Ahead of Its Time, Builder Claims

### HUNTER HENDEE 
A dream castle come true is Archi
tect Frank Lloyd Wright's contribu
tion to the Stanford campus and the
happiness of the family of Dr. Paul R.
Hanna, associate professor of edu
cation.
Completed, it will be Stanford's
most romantic home situated on
Stanford's most romantic spot.
That spot is Pine Hill, undermined
by tunnels a half-century old, sur
rounded by crumbling relics of
bridges and dams, and proposed site
of the continent's most palacial
mansionâ€”dreamed of sixty years ago
by M. Paulin Caperon', alias Peter
Coutts, better known to Stanfordites
simply as "The Frenchman."
Built Over Tunnel
Today, plum over the mouth of
Coutts' tunnel, foundations rise of
what in July will be one of Amer
ica's most unique homes, planned by
perhaps its foremost home architect.
Builder Harold P. Turner claims
the house will be 50 years ahead of
its time both in design and mate
rials used. Patterned after the
honey-comb, it uses an octagon four
feet in diameter as basic unit of de
sign.
Right Angles Scarce
Only right angles in the entire
building will be whore walls and
floors meet. Sliding glass door ex
tending across the 117 feet of front
age on Coronada Avenue will enable
Hannas virtually to live outdors,
weather permitting.
But most singular of all is the
"personality" Mr. Wright has given
the construction. Not until he had
lived with the Hannas several weeks
last spring did he begin the design
ing.

As a result, every detail in the
construction is compatible with the
Hannas' likes, philosophies, idiosyn
crasies.
"It takes a heap of living in a
house to make a home," says Poet
Eddie Guest. But when the Hannas
move into their new domicile, com
pletely furnished by Wright, it. will
truly be their home, as like them as
themselves!
Around them will be the relics of
Frenchman Coutts' story, the un
ravelling of which has become Dr.

Hanna's fascinating hobby. Thirty
feet below his basement meanders
one of the two old tunnel systems
which leads to "Frenchman's Tower"
two miles away.
Architect. Wright, now recovering
from influenza, has been unable to
leave his Spring Green, Wisconsin,
home to watch building progress. He
hopes, however, to visit the Farm for
that purpose next month. It will be
the third home on the Coast he has
designed, the other two being in
Pasadena.
