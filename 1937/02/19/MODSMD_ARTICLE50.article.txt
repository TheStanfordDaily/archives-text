# 'Free the Wife,' Says Professor
## Wants Marital Equality, Not Slipper-Fetching 
### 
Modern wives must be more than
"contented cows," Professor Ernest
Hilgard of the psychology depart
ment told the Women and Modern
Society class and its masculine
guests last night.
"The successful marriage depends
upon co-operation between psycho
logical equals," Professor Hilgard
said. "In the traditional picture of
married life where the wife runs
out to greet her husband in the eve
ning, runs to get his slippers, pipe
and book, the two are not equal.
"A woman is a man's equal in
college where she can go where she
wishes and take the courses that she
wishes. Why can't she do this when
she graduates? Why must she stay
at home?"
Professor v Hilgard recommended
that the modern wife be free to go
out and secure a job. By so doing
she will grow and will have some
thing worth while to offer in con
versation. "She then will be not
just a 'contented cow,' but will be
contributing to society with her tal
ents," he said.
"Only convention stands in the
way of bringing about this happy re
lationship in the home," he con
cluded.
Originally intended to be a course
open to men as well as women, no
roughs signed up for Society and
ths Modern Woman, so the instruc
tor, Miss Anastasia Doyle, required
each member of the class to bring a
masculine guest to last night's ses
sion.
