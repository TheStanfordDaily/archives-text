# Turrentine Criticizes Supreme Court Plan
## Constitution Amendment Proposed in Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 (U.R).—A
new compromise, calling for state
convention action within a year on
a proposed constitutional amend
ment—was advanced today in the
judiciary reorganization battle. It
was proposed by Senator Edward R.
Burke, D., Neb., and won praise from
Senator William E. Borah, R., Ida.
Burke said he probably would
suggest that the one-year require
ment be attached to the proposed
Wheeler-Bone constitutional amend
ment which would empower Con
gress to override by a two-thirds
vote Supreme Court decisions
invalidate acts of Congress.
Would Meet Objections
Burke said he believed that if
action were required within one year
this would meet the objections of
both friends and foes of Mr. Roose
velt's plan that the constitutional
amendment route required too much
time to afford an effective way of
meeting the situation.
Borah said the state convention
plan had "a good deal of merit.' Ho
pointed out that the prohibition re
peal amendment was attached to the
constitution in 18 months through
used of that method.
"The American Way"
"The people are entirely capable
of self-government," Borah said.
"We ought not to play the game
below the intelligence of the Ameri
can people."
In answer to arguments that con
stitutional amendments are difficult
to enact if vigorously opposed, Bo
rah pointed out that the income tax
amendment became law despite a
strenuous fight.
Burke advanced his suggestion in
the face of indicated coolness of sup
porters and opponents of Mr. Roose
velt's program to any compromise
although a number have been ad
vanced.
