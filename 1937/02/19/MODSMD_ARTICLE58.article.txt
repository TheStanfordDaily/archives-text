# Speaker Explains Act To Current Events Class

### 
President Roosevelt's proposal to
"stack the Supreme Court" would
be, in effect, a step toward dictator
ship, Professor Lowell Turrentine
of the School of Law told the cur
rent events class yesterday.
"Even those who favor the Presi
dent's proposal to raise the number
of justices to 15 admit that the in
dependence of the court will be lost
temporarily by such a change," Dr.
Turrentine declared.
He pointed out lhat the chief ob
jection of thoughtful persons to the
proposal is that "the President is
doing it by indirection, instead of by
the forthright method of a Constitu
tional amendment." The delay that
this would entail, however, would
not meet with the President's ap
proval, since a decision is expected
in the near future on the Wagner
Labor Relations Act and the Securi
ties and Exchange Act, he explained.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18 (UP).â€”Ten
ants in an East Side apartment house
complained that the heat was low
today, and when the building super
intendent broke into the locked
basement he found the body of Jul
ius Peterson, 61, a porter who tended
the furnace, hanging by a clothes
line from a steam pipe.
