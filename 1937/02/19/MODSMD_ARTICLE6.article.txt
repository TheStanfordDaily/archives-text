# Professor Compares Washington, F.D.R.
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
George Washington was the first President to pack the Supreme Court
bench, claims History Professor Harold Whitman Bradley.
The father of his country was particularly careful to choose only those j
officials in favor of his political views; as justices are presidcntially hand- I
picked, the first Court was a Washington court.
Although his tactics with the judiciary resemble those of Roosevelt, the
characters of the first and the latest Presidents were otherwise widely

j divergent, explained Bradley. Both
came of aristocratic families; both
I entered public service. Roosevelt
I did so as a politician; Washington,
! although wishing to remain a gen
j tleman farmer, was drafted into his
country's service.
Quiet, conservative, dignified,
j Washington took less readily to in
novation than does his successor. He
j is an instance of greatness achieved
J not through rash brilliance, but
j through strong will, character, judg
i ment. Washington would not have
! been adr.ptable to fireside chats, con
tinued Bradley. ,
Throughout, the history professor
emphasized the difference in condi
tions between 1795 and 1937. He
explained that no valid comparison
may be made between Washington's
policies and those of the New Deal
j because the problems each at
! tempted to solve have nothing in
| common.
I Asked to point a moral for Stan
ford students from Washington's life,
Professor Bradley observed, "You
j can't inspire the present generation
j by reference to the pastâ€”perhaps
i that's the trouble." He believes in
I commemorating Washington's Birth-
I day because "most professors, as
| most students, like holidays with no
j classes," but thinks its observance
could be turned to more useful ends
I than glorifying the constitution.
