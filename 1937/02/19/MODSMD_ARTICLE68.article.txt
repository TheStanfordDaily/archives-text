SPEAKING OF CATTLE,
HOW ABOUT HERWIG?

There has been so much said about
Bob Herwig and his bovine tactics,
half in admiration and half in depre
cation, that nobody knows whether
the big boy is a dirty player or
whether he is just misunderstood.
Now, I don't pretend to know
whether Herwig is a dirty player at
heart, because I don't know the gen
tleman. However, this is still a free
country in spite of the income tax
laws and I still can formulate my
own ideas about the subject. v
In all the games that I have seen
Herwig play, it has appeared to me
that he is hampered in being gen
teel by his size. A headliner in
football, a game that doesn't take
the finesse necessary in basketball,
Herwig gets along perfectly in that
game because he couples about 215
pounds of brawn with better than
ordinary speed. In the hoop game
it is necessary to have not only
speed, but a large measure of
quickness, reflexes that act with
the thought, not after.
Maybe Herwig has very fine re
flexes, I don't mean to criticize any
man's innate possessions. As reflexes
go, Herwig's are certainly far above
the average, even for an athlete. But
when he gets on the floor with men
like Malsley, Luisetti, Turner, and
Moore, not to mention several others,
his quickness doesn't measure up to
theirs.
There are so few men weighing

over 200 pounds have the
electric impulses that go with a
175- or 180-pounder that it is
hardly a disgrace to be like Her
wig. Joe Louis, with tremendous
strength in either hand, is able to
throw punches so fast that his arms
seem to blur in action. He is one
of the few that have that great
speed and the strength that conies
from 200 pounds. At that, his feet
aren't too fast.
Because I feel that Herwig is
handicapped by his size—maybe he is
just a wee bit muscle-bound, too—l
hesitate to say that he is a dirty
player. Every once in a while he
fouls himself out of a game, but I
think it is because he can't control
his weight with quite the relaxed
flex that is employed by men like
Luisetti.

YOU TAKE HERWIG;
LET'S HAVE BALSLEY

Now Big Bob is a co-captain of
the Bears, with Ray Balsley, and he
came into his own last Saturday
night when he led his team to a win
over Troy. He seems finally to have
got over the large case of footballitis
that has been dogging him since he
got back from Georgia.
