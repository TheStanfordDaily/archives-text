# Frosh Quintet To Meet Cubs Here Tonight
## Papoose Will Force Cal Team in Second Game, Favored by First Win 
### 
Stanford's Papoose hardwooders
play their twelfth game of the sea
son tonight. If they win, it will be
their twelfth victory. They play their
second game in the three-game se
ries with the Cal Cubs tonight. If
they win, it will be their second vic
tory over the Cubs.
All of which is a good excuse to
acquaint Farm frosh fans with this
undefeated quintet, which believes
in not only beating teams, but in
soundly thwacking them.
Lafaille, Lyon Forward
First, the forwards. Leon Lafaille,
who stands at 6 feet even, is a dead
eye of the first order, especially
from the corners of the court and
never has to look where he's pass
ing. He's one of who has
a sort of extra sense, which tells him
where his teammates are.
His running mate, Ted Lyon, is G
feet 2, and dead in close to the hooo.
His ability to tear right down the
center, when three guys are trying
their best to stop him, and still make
a set-up, rings up a goodly number
of points for the frosh. Watch these
two boys work on defense. They
work as though they were one.
At center towers 6-6 and a half
Tom Siebert, he of the gargantuan
stature. Although his eyes are a wee
bit bad, he nevertheless manages to
be high-point man in nearly every
game. And no wonder, for he's ab
solutely dead on set-ups and tip-ins,
and, since he can cover half the court
with a couple of steps, he's always in
the right place.
'Bulwarks'
Two of the steadiest and calmest
units of the squad hold down the
guard spots. Gil Rahn, shortest
first-stringer, is only live feet eleven.
His partner, Will "Andy" Anderson,
is the second tallest man, skyscrap
ing at 6 feet 4. These two Papooses
form a bulwark of defense which has
been tested and proved time and
time again.
The game starts at 6:30, and is a
prelim to the varsity tussle. Keep
your eyes open, and you'll see a
smooth-working hoop team meet an
other smooth-working hoop team in
what is sux*e to be a real fight.

be high-point man in nearly every
game. And no wonder, for he's ab
solutely dead on set-ups and tip-ins,
and, since he can cover half the court
with a couple of steps, he's always in
the right place.
'Bulwarks'
Two of the steadiest and calmest
units of the squad hold down the
guard spots. Gil Rahn, shortest
first-stringer, is only live feet eleven.
His partner, Will "Andy" Anderson,
is the second tallest man, skyscrap
ing at 6 feet 4. These two Papooses
form a bulwark of defense which has
been tested and proved time and
time again.
The game starts at 6:30, and is a
prelim to the varsity tussle. Keep
your eyes open, and you'll see a
smooth-working hoop team meet an
other smooth-working hoop team in
what is sux*e to be a real fight.
Stanford's Papoose hardwooders
play their twelfth game of the sea
son tonight. If they win, it will be
their twelfth victory. They play their
second game in the three-game se
ries with the Cal Cubs tonight. If
they win, it will be their second vic
tory over the Cubs.
All of which is a good excuse to
acquaint Farm frosh fans with this
undefeated quintet, which believes
in not only beating teams, but in
soundly thwacking them.
Lafaille, Lyon Forward
First, the forwards. Leon Lafaille,
who stands at 6 feet even, is a dead
eye of the first order, especially
from the corners of the court and
never has to look where he's pass
ing. He's one of who has
a sort of extra sense, which tells him
where his teammates are.
His running mate, Ted Lyon, is G
feet 2, and dead in close to the hooo.
His ability to tear right down the
center, when three guys are trying
their best to stop him, and still make
a set-up, rings up a goodly number
of points for the frosh. Watch these
two boys work on defense. They
work as though they were one.
At center towers 6-6 and a half
Tom Siebert, he of the gargantuan
stature. Although his eyes are a wee
bit bad, he nevertheless manages to
be high-point man in nearly every
game. And no wonder, for he's ab
solutely dead on set-ups and tip-ins,
and, since he can cover half the court
with a couple of steps, he's always in
the right place.
