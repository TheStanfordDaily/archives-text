# Swimmers To Battle Winged O Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team facts C' e aci I test tomorrow after
noon at 2 o'clock when the famed Olympic Club u.cv <cn swoop into Ell
- Pools to engage the Cards in the "battle of the centui. .
Coach Nort Thornton has stated that both he and George ' 'h. club
coach, would rather win this meet than any other on the seast'i. .•> idule

for the two squads. *
Thornton rates the Post Streeters
as one of the three best club teams
in the nation and adds that his Indian
varsity is one of the three strongest
college teams.
Townc Ailing
Don Towne, crack Card breast
stroker, has been suffering from poi
son oak but hopes are high that he
will enter the 200-yard sailor style
event and also the 300-yard medley
relay. He will be opposed by Dave
Cox and George Win berg of the
Club, who will both be favored over
the Indian submarine ace.
Another task will be shoved on the
shoulders of Hal Weatherbe in the
150-yard backstroke. The Card up
side-down artist will be the under
dog against the veteran, Art Har
graves, who up to last year had a
record of no defeats in 13 years of
backstroke swimming.
Vibert in Ileadliner
The headline race of the afternoon
will probably be the 100-yard dash,
which will bring together Dick Clark
and Jack Vibert of Stanford and Art
Rule and Louis Diamond of the Club.
Rule, a former star sprint man from
Annapolis, will probably step to the
starting line the slight favorite.
The meet is a toss-up in the opin
ion of Thornton, who prophesies that
the meet will be decided in the last
event of the day—the 400-yard free
style relay. Clark, Scatena, Mac-
Kenzie, and Vibert will represent
Stanford.
Needham. Rider Face Olds
The 220 and 440 will be two other
close struggles, when Thornton
shoots his two aces Winfield Need
ham and Dave Rider in against Bus
ter Olds, former Stanford champ, and
Carter Ashley. Dick Keating resigned
from the Winged O Club recently,
dealing a serious blow to San Fran
cisco amphibians.
No admission will be charged.

Stanford's varsity swimming team facts C' e aci I test tomorrow after
noon at 2 o'clock when the famed Olympic Club u.cv <cn swoop into Ell
- Pools to engage the Cards in the "battle of the centui. .
Coach Nort Thornton has stated that both he and George ' 'h. club
coach, would rather win this meet than any other on the seast'i. .•> idule

for the two squads. *
Thornton rates the Post Streeters
as one of the three best club teams
in the nation and adds that his Indian
varsity is one of the three strongest
college teams.
Townc Ailing
Don Towne, crack Card breast
stroker, has been suffering from poi
son oak but hopes are high that he
will enter the 200-yard sailor style
event and also the 300-yard medley
relay. He will be opposed by Dave
Cox and George Win berg of the
Club, who will both be favored over
the Indian submarine ace.
Another task will be shoved on the
shoulders of Hal Weatherbe in the
150-yard backstroke. The Card up
side-down artist will be the under
dog against the veteran, Art Har
graves, who up to last year had a
record of no defeats in 13 years of
backstroke swimming.
Vibert in Ileadliner
The headline race of the afternoon
will probably be the 100-yard dash,
which will bring together Dick Clark
and Jack Vibert of Stanford and Art
Rule and Louis Diamond of the Club.
Rule, a former star sprint man from
Annapolis, will probably step to the
starting line the slight favorite.
The meet is a toss-up in the opin
ion of Thornton, who prophesies that
the meet will be decided in the last
event of the day—the 400-yard free
style relay. Clark, Scatena, Mac-
Kenzie, and Vibert will represent
Stanford.
Needham. Rider Face Olds
The 220 and 440 will be two other
close struggles, when Thornton
shoots his two aces Winfield Need
ham and Dave Rider in against Bus
ter Olds, former Stanford champ, and
Carter Ashley. Dick Keating resigned
from the Winged O Club recently,
dealing a serious blow to San Fran
cisco amphibians.
