# Turn Off the Light
## 
### 
YOU'RE in a big room—standing before a
great plate glass window that looks over
the city. It's night. A chandelier hangs over
head.
You gaze out at the city lights, at the slots
that are streets, at the angular skyline—but you
can't see clearly. Reflections from lights within
send everything askew—hazy, jumbled, dis
torted. The glass is a mirror. You see yourself.
The room lights go off.
Haze is gone. Each neon tube stands clear,
each yellow window patch, each building cor
nice sharp against the sky, you see. The whole
thing is sensible now. False reflections are
obliterated. You look through the glass, not at
it. The world is plain and cold and clear.
In college the lights are on. The cool factual
clarity of the night outside is muddled by rose
colored beams from the chandelier above, and
sharp contrasts become gradations, facts be
come impressions.
Most Stanford people bathe in the chandelier
light and watch reflections of themselves, and
queer distortions of the lines outside.
Others, perhaps, are looking beyond.
Not until after graduation will all throw the
switch.—G. F.
