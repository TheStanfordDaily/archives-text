WHAT is a good newspaper? According
to the campus opinionaters The Stanford
Daily is a bad newspaper because it talks about
bars, because it doesn't talk enough about bars,
because it prints too little world news, because
it crowds out local news with world news, be
cause it didn't print my notice, because it
printed my notice incorrectly, because I like
to complain.
What is a good newspaper? Who are we to
tell you? And who are you to tell us? A good
newspaper is bigger than the men who write
to it or for it.
All you can safely say is that a good news
paper is read and that it may offend your
convictions but never your sensibilities.
Now God knows the Stanford Daily is not
a good newspaper. But The Stanford Daily is
read and it likes to raise hell with stereotypes,
though it makes a sincere effort to hold to the
canons of good taste.
The worst thing that could happen to The
Daily would be that it became "satisfactory"
to you. You would not read it. You would stop
writing letters in to us, condemning us for ex
pressing our opinions so you could express
your own.
You would drop it each morning simply be
cause it contained nothing for you to explode,
nothing for you to hate, only things that you
could passively accept without spilling a drop
of morning coffee.
To produce Volume 91 of The Daily is not
necessarily to produce a sensational newspaper.
If you will pick up last Monday's issue and
actually read the "Alcohol and Gasoline Do
Mix" editorial, for instance, you will find that
everything it says is a legitimate opinion.
You were shocked by it because it presented
a legitimate opinion in print. You declare it to
be "sensational" because it said something in
cold type you had never seen in cold type
before. And the "enormity" of it was en
hanced by your own disagreement, which had
nothing to do with the opinions presented.
Like most inhibited communities, Stanford is
"type-conscious." Which makes Stanford a
fine newspaper town. For there is one sure way
to present the avoided subject and the con
cealed problem so that it will shake up the
populace.
