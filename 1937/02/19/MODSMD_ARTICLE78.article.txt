(From the Daily Californian)
FROM Stephens Union, the official hideout of
University "student leaders" have come in
dignant denials that the Bay Exposition had the
approval of any A.S.U.C. officers in its plan
to bury the Stanford Axe. Permission to photo
graph the Axe on the exposition site was the
only privilege they granted, they said.
On the other hand members of the exposition
publicity staff have declared that the plan had
the full approval, not only of Leonard Charvet
and Helen Cunningham, but of Kenneth Priest
ley, A.S.U.C. general manager.
It is easy to see the Machiavellian design of
the wicked publicity experts in this apparent
conflict. They intended to get the Axe out to
the shoals and then bury it, with or without the
consent of those responsible for its safekeeping.
It was not the fault of Charvet and Miss Cun
ningham that they could not foresee this de
velopment.
Apparently the Exposition likes its publicity
well enough to get it by fair means or foul.
The Axe episode differs a little from the usual
run of bathing-beauty publicity the exposition
has so far developed, but its methods are about
the same.
