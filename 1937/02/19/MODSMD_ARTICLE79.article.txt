rpHE BOYS in the eating clubs have fun, too. They
laugh and play and tell dirty jokes and swear and
try to get dates with Stanford women and think the
Zetes are moving, just like other boys. Sometimes they
even have meetings on Monday nights and wonder
what is the matter and why isn't there the spirit around
here that there used to be. There usually is exercise
before dinner and after dinner. And there always is
somebody running for office, which is good exercise
and develops the legs.
The boys in the eating clubs have lots of milk to
drink and there always are seconds for everybody.
It seems only yesterday that somebody poured
buckets of water down the El Toro chimney. And every
body suspected the Campos because five ycai's ago
somebody poured buckets of water down the El Toro
chimney and ruined the stoves and caused untold
damages and everybody suspected the Campos then,
too. Maybe it was only yesterday. Let's see, yesterday
was Thursday. That makes today Friday and Monday
is Washington's Birthday. And maybe it wasn't El
Campo cither.
Then there is El Capitan also. An El Capitan wanted
to go to an El Cuadro party in the City last week-end.
And the El Cuadros wanted him to go too. However,
all the Stanford women wanted him to go to, which was
an El of a situation.
So he called up his home town, which is Hollister,
which may not be a town, but at least it's home, and
got a date with an old ember of his.
At 4 o'clock Friday afternoon, he left the campus in
a car he borrowed from a pal, went down to his town
home and found his old ember, and fanned it back to
the City in time to join the El Cuadros in a round.
At 1 o'clock, maybe, he left the City, arriving tardily
in Hollister at 4 o'clock in the morning, having had
trouble with the gearshift lever all the way. At 6:45
o'clock he was back on the campus, in time to turn
the car over to his pal, the gearshift lever considerably
improved.
That is the kind of life the eating club boys lead,
letting no obstacle stand in the way of their wanting to
go to the City. Sometimes I think that maybe when all
is said and done that maybe the eating club boys get
just as bothered about all these sweaters and skirts on
the Quad on these sunny mornings as you or I do.
