# BULL SESSION
## HAPPY AS THE DAY IS LONG 
### 
A LOT of the more joyous souls on the campus have
been coming up to me and saying, "What do you
always want to go around making cracks for? Just
why do you v/ant to tear everything apart and kick a
lot of nice people in ihe face? Everyone willJiate your
guts if you keep it up. Why don't you be happy and
constructive for a while and see how much better you
feel."
Right now I feel fine, have always felt fine.
I look at these people in amazement and wonder why
they are criticizing me! The shark bites of criticism
seem to have goaded them to unthinking extremes.
So I go on criticizing them and they me and no one
gets anywhere and no one is happy, which, of course,
is too bad. Box score: no runs, no hits, lots of errors.
But what I really want to know is, just why should
I have ot be constructive to be happy? That's what I'd
like to know.

Back in the 1920's there were a lot of Rotarians in
this country who went around patting each other on
the back so often that collective backs began to ache all
over. They went along building up their houses of
cards, pasting them together with nothing more sub
stantial than high-powered credit systems, and in 1929
when the wind began to blow hard, a lot of them patted
bullets into their respective heads. They died,
martyrs to the Constructive way.
So what did the constructionist do for the develop
ment of America?
Precisely nothing.
And we, the youth, are in the holes they scraped
with their constant bowings.
♦ * >|t Jf!
Now, we who are young can all sit in the holes and
wonder what we are going to do about it. We can
either get out of the holes or stay in them for the rest of
our lives.
We have a problem and we have three answers.
Either we can . 'art lashing about beating on the walls
of our caverns, which would be corporate density under
the circumstances, or we can sit down and think, use
our imaginations, and then point out the difficulties to
be surmounted.
If we can start enough people thinking along with
us, then pretty soon some bright young lad will pop up
with a solution. Being sheep we will follow him out.
into a world of our own making and really have some
thing to'be joyful about.
Or we can put a mirror on the wall, smile gaily at
our happy expressions, leave everything to fate, pat
ourselves lustily three times on our already belabored
backs and with a very satisfied air of self-complacent
assuredness say that everything will work out all right
in the end.
You ran choosr your own answer.

A LOT of the more joyous souls on the campus have
been coming up to me and saying, "What do you
always want to go around making cracks for? Just
why do you v/ant to tear everything apart and kick a
lot of nice people in ihe face? Everyone willJiate your
guts if you keep it up. Why don't you be happy and
constructive for a while and see how much better you
feel."
Right now I feel fine, have always felt fine.
I look at these people in amazement and wonder why
they are criticizing me! The shark bites of criticism
seem to have goaded them to unthinking extremes.
So I go on criticizing them and they me and no one
gets anywhere and no one is happy, which, of course,
is too bad. Box score: no runs, no hits, lots of errors.
But what I really want to know is, just why should
I have ot be constructive to be happy? That's what I'd
like to know.

Back in the 1920's there were a lot of Rotarians in
this country who went around patting each other on
the back so often that collective backs began to ache all
over. They went along building up their houses of
cards, pasting them together with nothing more sub
stantial than high-powered credit systems, and in 1929
when the wind began to blow hard, a lot of them patted
bullets into their respective heads. They died,
martyrs to the Constructive way.
So what did the constructionist do for the develop
ment of America?
Precisely nothing.
And we, the youth, are in the holes they scraped
with their constant bowings.
