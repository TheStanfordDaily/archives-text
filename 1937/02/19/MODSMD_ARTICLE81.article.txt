# The 						SCRAPBOOK
## MORE BROADWAY 
### Clipped by ALLEN DRURY 
We continue the notes-on-shows
sent on by Fred Clark, Stanford grad !
at present working in New York:
Red, Hot, and Blue —This would be
pretty slim tare if Ethel Merman,
Jimmy Durante, and Bob Hope!
weren't in it, but sbice Ethel Mer- j
man, Jimmy Durante, and Bob Hope '
are in it, it's caviar for the general.'
It isn't another "Anything Goes" but'
Durante is at his absolute best (as
when he cross-examines himself be
fore a Senate investigating commit- I
tee). Merman warbles as only Mer
man can, and Hope sings and wise
cracks very nicely, in some way
completely avoiding that urge to
mayhem a juvenile usually engen
ders in us. Others to be tabbed are;
Polly Walters and the dancing Hart
mans. Sample gag: "Two's company
—three's the result."
Boy Meets Girl — Despite changes
in the cast, this is still the rowdiest, J
belly-laughingest comedy smash on ;
Broadway. Joyce Arling, Allyn
Josslyn, and Millard Mitchell have j
the fattest gag lines, and make the ,
most of them. The plot is developed
fully in the title, and with the best
second act curtain-line we've ever j
heard, this opus bears up as the best'
Hollywood harpooning since "Once I
in a Lifetime."
The D'O.vly Carte Repertory of j
Gilbert and Sullivan really has little I
left to say about it. Since our per- |
sonal taste rates G. & S. absolute
tops in music, we can only state in no |
uncertain terms that here we have it j
in perfect perfection. A special palm 1
must be awarded to the set designer, I
who's done an astounding three-di- |
mensional illusion job. We're only 1
sorry we didn't start going sooner; j
as it was we could only revel over j
"Cox and Box," "H.M.S. Pinafore,"
"lolanthe," "Patience," "The Mika- j
do," "Princess Ida, "Ruddigore," i
"The Gondoliers," and "Yeomen of j
the Guard."
