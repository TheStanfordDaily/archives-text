# CAMPUS OPINION
## SUBTLE, EH? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To say that I heartily agree with
N.T. and his "Campus Opinion" is to
put it very mildly. Anyone that is as
foolish as to print such a mess as
that presented on the front page of
this morning's "Dippy" should go
back to cutting paper dolls or else
join the American Students League.
According to various members of
your staff the point of the edit was
to aid in the drive for a nitery. But
as far as I can see it has tended to
bring to the front the question of
"administration sanctioned drink
ing." If that picture is supposed to
show "Gasoline and Alcohol Do
Mix," let's have a picture of the car
standing up to the bar drinking.
Please don't be so subtle; all Stan
ford students aren't, as quick to catch
the point of your various efforts, as
are the members of your staff. If the
Examiner hasn't picked up your edit
for a good "slug" at Stanford, then
they must not have seen it; and if
they did you should get the "slug."
Where? Right in the neck. Yes, you
Eis old dear—Bla—and I think that
Volume 5)1 should fold up and die —
