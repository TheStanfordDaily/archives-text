# TO THE BAR, WEEKLY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that in your edi
torial on Gasoline dnd Alcohol you
arc reflecting unfairly on a great

portion of the students here at Stan
ford. There are many students who
are here to study and learn. To rep
resent them as alcoholic playboys,
and to convey the impression that
the average student's life here is not
complete without a weekly trip to
the bar, does them a grave injustice.
Likewise, it seems that Old Boy
Harper is taking unwarranted liber
ties with the character and integrity
of many students here when he
writes in today's Bull Session. He
should specify distinctly that he is
talking not about the average stu
dent but about himself.
Continuing: if D.B. wishes to talk
about cheap publicity, what about
the article in the Chronicle the day
before the issue he mentions. Prob
ably Stanford brasshats were as
much at fault as were the Cal brass
hats in the follow-up article on the
pipe-smoking coeds at Cal. (Didn't
I see an article on pipe-smoking co
eds at Stanford in the Daily re
cently?)
Anyway, why should we be the
pawns of San Francisco brass-hats in
what was admittedly a publicity
stunt, and hence cheap and a mock
ery of the noble sentiments it is
supposed to symbolize?
Sincerely,
W.P.
Moron—A person who is content
with a serene mind.
Socialist—A person who has noth
ing and wants to share it with you.
Reformer—A person who wants
you to let his conscience be your
guide.
