Here come the Alpha O girls with
a bjring! bang!
Rita Szekercs is the so-called
mother of the women's contingent of
the Stanford Rifle Club. Rita was for
a year the only woman member of
the club, and is now high man and
woman, too, on the team.
At the beginning of this quarter
she decided that more women ought
to learn how to handle a gun. She
started within her own house and al
most immediately Holly Hansen,
Evelyn Jamieson, Dolly Hyatt, and
Susan Luckie joined up. Since that
time Lucille Reimer and Muriel Pol
lia, both of Roble, have become
members.
Rita has four guns: "I call them
Rosabella, Suzabella, Little Lulu
belle, and Jelly because she jams."

True to life, that's Tro Harper.
Tro is a Beta and ever since he
was ten has been vitally interested
in photography—so vitally that he
contributed his talent to Chaparral.
That's how it all came about.
Tro also writes Bull Session, and
San Francisco's Call Bulletin liked

Tro's Bull Session, lie was asked to
be campus correspondent, but he was
true to Life.
'Life' magazine Vas given him, as a
result of his excellent work in
Chappie and an article which he
wrote for the Leica Magazine, the
job of campus correspondent. Tro is
also campus correspondent for
'Time.'
