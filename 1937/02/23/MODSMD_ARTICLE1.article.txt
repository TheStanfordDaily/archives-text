# Senate Fixes Hearings For Court Bill
## Vote in Upper Chamber On Court Measure Is Expected in 90 Days 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 (UP). —
The Senate Judiciary Committee to
day fixed March 9 for the start of
public hearings on President Roose
velt's Court Reorganization Bill and
Senate leaders predicted privately
that it would reach a vote in the
upper chamber within three months.
Decision to go ahead with the
measure permitting enlargement of
the Supreme Court to 15 members
reflected administration confidence
in its ultimate strength, and was also
regarded as a move to discourage
filibuster by the strong opposition.
Sumncrs Bill Favored
The committee acted after voting
13 to 5 to report favorably the Sum
ners Bill, already passed by the
House, permitting Supreme Court
Justices to retire at 70 on full pay,
$20,000 a year.
Senator Pat McCarran, D., Nev.,
assigned to present the bill, hoped to
complete his report by tomorrow so
that the Senate can consider it this
week.
Farm Leaders Visit F.R.
Meanwhile, President Roosevelt
received a group of farm leaders
headed by Secretary of Agriculture
Henry A. Wallace and Edward A.
O'Neal, president of the Farm Bu
reau Federation. They discussed the
Supreme Court proposal as well as
farm plans, but O'Neal said the
President made no effort to secure
their pledge of support.
O'Neal said that the federation has
taken no action on the court pro
gram, and that some of its units were
in favor of it and some against it. i
