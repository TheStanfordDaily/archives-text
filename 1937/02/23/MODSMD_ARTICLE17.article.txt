## Lee Announces Aims Of Educating Public 
### 
Corporation papers for the Amer
ican Society for the Control of Ve
nereal Disease have been filed, Dr.
Russell V. Lee, founder and head of
the organization, reports.
Started in San Francisco and
Northern California for the purpose
of educating the public and physi
cians in what has to be done to sub
jugate venereal diseases, the society
is planning to lodge quite an ambi
tious program for their control. Dr.
Lee stated.
Model after T.B.S.
The ultimate objective of the so
ciety is to build up an organization
as strong as the Tuberculosis Pre
vention Society. Members are look
ing forward also to strengthening the
resistance of social officers who will
be concerned in handling cases of
disease.
The last 20 years have shown what
can be done once a positive program
has been adopted, Dr. Lee said, cit
ing Sweden as example of a country
which by effective measures has
nearly wiped out venereal diseases.
"Now in this country we know ex
actly what to do and with organized
activity we will do it," Dr. Lee de
clared.
Work for Fair
Reporting the completion of or
ganization plans, Dr. Lee said, "It
will not only be the purpose of this
society to extirpate syphilis in this
countx-y wtihin 10 years, but we will
show how it can be done by making
San Francisco cleaner of venereal
diseases by the time the Fair is held
than any other city in the world."
Starting in California, the society
intends to spread interest all over the
country and enlai'ge to include other
states and ultimately the whole
country.
Prominent members of the or
ganization include Almon E. Roth,
Mortimer Fleishhacker, Mrs. Kath
leen Norris, Percy Peltigrew, Dr.
Howard Morrow, Isa Lillick, Mrs.
Paul Eliel, and A. P. Giannini.
