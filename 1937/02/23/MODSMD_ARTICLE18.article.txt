# Leslie Howard Favors 'Hamlet' Role
## 
### DAVE LEFF 
To San Francisco playgoers, Leslie
Howard is Hamlet, Shakespeare's
melancholy Dane. To a Daily report
er, Mr. Howard is a slim, smiling
gentleman with a boyish face and
cordial manner.
Following Friday's performance of
"Hamlet" at the Curran Theater,
Leslie Howard removed his make
up, dressed, and received a repre
sentative of the Stanford Daily with
outstretched hand and a smile.
To the interviewer who proffered a
list of written questions with space
for his answers, Mr. Howard said,
"You write the answers; I can't
write."
Likes Classic Role
Question 1: How does this role
(Hamlet) compare in your prefer
ence with others you have taken?
"Favorably," was the laconic re
ply. "You may expand on that," he
added.
Asked which is his favorite speech
in "Hamlet," the erstwhile Dane
quoted, " The rest is silence,' which,
being the last line of the play, is my
favorite, because then I don't have to
say any moreâ€”l can go home."
What is the future and significance
of Shakespeare in the modern the
ater?
Hamlet Always Modern
"I don't know. I don't like to be
cynical, but you won't see an enor
mous amount of Shakespeare except
in little theaters and such groups."
Do you render a real-life Hamlet

or an Elizabethan version of the
character?

* "What, do you think?" countered
Mr. Howard. "A flesh-and-blood
Hamlet," he agreed, though, is his
intention. "How can we tell how
Elizabethan performers were? Ev
ery Hamlet is a modern Hamlet.
Even Burbage's production in 1603
was modern."
Here the reporter laughed, saying,
! "Of course; Shakespeare was dead
in 1603."
"He wasn't dead, though," cor
rected Leslie Howard, whereupon
the scribe feebly tried to recover
with, "Of course, it was Elizabeth
who was dead."
The thanks of the interviewer as
he withdrew from dressing Room 17
were hospitably returned by the
whilom Prince of Denmark with
thanks of his own and a promise to
visit Stanford and its new theater
early this week.


LESLIE HOWARD calls Ilamlet
his favorite role. His favorite line
in the play is the last, because then
he can go home.
