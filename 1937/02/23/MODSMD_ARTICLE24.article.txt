# Prop Defect Cited as Air Crash Cause
## Airline Official Bases Theory on Positions Of Recovered Parts 
### 
A theory that mechanical trouble
caused the crash of the United Air
Lines plane into San Francisco Bay
on February 9 was advanced today
after the finding yesterday of the
missing right propellor and right
wing of the ship.
The solution of the mystery crash
was offered by C. E. Johnson, divi
sion superintendent of the airline,
and was based on the positions in
which the parts of the plane were
found. The right motor of the plane
was discovered late Monday night.
Propellor Intact
Although the blades of the pro
pellor were bent and it was broken
from its shaft, it was intact. It was
discovered thiee-quarters of a mile
north of the ship. The discovered
parts were taken to the Oakland air
port for examination by United Air
Lines and Department of Commerce
officials.
According to Mr. Johnson, it was
possible that either the propellor had
broken while the plane was in the
air, or the accident was caused by
failure of the retarding gear in the
nose section of the crankcase.
Motor Torn Out
The propellor may have flown off,
tearing out the motor, and the motor
as it dropped might have torn off the
wing, he said. However, airline offi
cials emphasized that until all parts
are examined no definite conclusion
can be reached as to whether the
human or mechanical factor caused
the accident.
Major R. W. Schroeder, chief of the
air service of the Department of
Commerce, is reported to be flying
back to Oakland from Washington,
D.C., to reopen the investigation of
the crash.
