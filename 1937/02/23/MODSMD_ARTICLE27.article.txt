# Stanford's Children Get Normal Education at Campus School
## No Geniuses Are Among Professors' Progeny

Stanford's little red schoolhouse is
not red but a pale pink. It begins
where the Alpha Delt house leaves
off, up toward the end of Lasuen.
After falling over a baseball bat
and six bottles of orange juice, a
nervous reporter found a little boy
sitting on a bench eating hamburger.
He knew where the principal was.
Principal Appears
Mr. Beech, the young principal
who took over the school at the be
ginning of fall semester, is a grad
uate of Stanford's School of Educa
tion. When approached, he was
blowing up a basketball, but stop
ped to give information about his
109 college - bred grammar - school
charges.
Two-thirds of these children are
off-spring of professors; most of the
rest belong to graduate students who
have combined education with mat
rimony. In spite of this head-start,
insists Principal Beech, the children
are perfectly normal. He shied off
when questioned about I.Q.'s. "I don't
keep track of them," he said, "but I
know none of them is extraordi
nary."
Part of System
The Farm schoolhouse, which is a
regular part of the Palo Alto school
system, is no longer a testing ground
for Dr. Terman's psych exes. It
seems that someone decided the kids
had enough of that at home.
A young lady pasting labels in
books vouchsafed that the inmates
are being initiated into a miniature
library system, patterned exactly
after Stanford's own. Mr. Beech,
cornered, admitted with reluctance
that his pupils are inordinately fond
of reading.
All of the students, says Mr. Beech,
have good Stanford spirit â€” except
for one girl whose older brother
played football for Cal.


STRICTLY NORMAL are those children attending the pale pink
schoolhouse 011 Stanford's canipns. according to the principal. The
students, 75 per cent of whom are offspring of professors and graduate
students, are 110 longer subjects for psychological experimentation.
