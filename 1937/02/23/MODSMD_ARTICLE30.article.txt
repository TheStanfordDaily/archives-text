# Mural Swim Meet Starts Tomorrow
## 
### 
All teams planning to enter the In
tramural Swimming Meet tomorrow
and Thursday should sign the entry
list in Encina Gym, according to
Myron Sprague, who is in charge of
the meet.
A schedule similar to last year will
be followed, wherein candidates for
all events must report to Encina
Pools tomorrow afternoon. In those
events where too many for a single
race sign up, heats will be held, with
times instead of places serving to
qualify for the finals Thursday
afternoon. The diving finals will be
held at noon Thursday.
Events to be held are: 50, 100, and
150-yard freestyle, 75-yard breast
stroke, 75-yard backstroke, four
man 200-yard relay, and diving.
Scoring will be 6-4-2-1, except for
the relay, which will be 10-6-4-2.
Teams placing will receive minor
sport points on the intramural all
year chart; Delta Chi are defending
swim champions.

Dick Foran, star of Westerns, who
never shot a revolver until two years
ago, is one of the best pistol shots in
Hollywood. Right or left handed he
can knock the spots off a playing
card at 50 paces.
