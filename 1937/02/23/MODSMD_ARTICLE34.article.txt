# Pancakes Dry As Strike Effect Holds Up Syrup
## 
### 
Settlement of the waterfront strike
came over three weeks ago, but its
effects are still noticed by Elliott
Ay res, manager of the wholesale co
operative which supplies food to
most of the fraternities and sorori
ties on the campus.
Log cabin syrup, for example, has
been hard to get. It i s usually
shipped from the East by boat, and
during the strike the shippers sent as
little as possible to avoid paying the
higher rail rates.- As soon as the
strike was settled, they would send
no more by train, so there was quite
a break until the first water traffic
reached the West.
Ayres would have to pay these
higher freight rates himself, if it
were not for the special contract
under which he buys. If the prices
rise he pays no more, but if the
market breaks he can take advan
tage of the drop.
Although last traces of the strike
should be gone within a week or two,
the New Deal Social Security Act is
beginning to affect prices for the
co-operative. The payroll tax on
employers and employees raises the
prices of some products as much as
four cents per case.
