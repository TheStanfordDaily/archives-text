# Card Ruggers Trample Dons
## Indians Gain 11-0 Victory In Hard Fought Tilt 
### 
In a hard-fought rugby tilt Satur
day afternoon, the Stanford Indians
swept to a 11-0 victory over the
U.S.F. Dons. The San Francisco team
considerably outweighed the Cards
and had a much better passing at
tack, but failed to penetrate to the
Indian goal line.
Two penalty kicks by Wayne
Richardson early in the game failed
to reach their mark. Soon, little Ar
chie Zamloch took the ball from the
scrum about 10 yards from the Don
goal and fought his way through 15
men to make the first try of the
game. Richardson converted to add
two points to the score. This was the
only scoring done in the first half,
though several attempts were almost
good.
In the second half, both t%ams
fought harder, but the Indians had
more speed and better tacklers and
were thus able to break up any at
tempts of the Dons to score. Early
in the last half, Harry Goff grabbed
the ball from a drop kick by Vigna
and fell across the goal to give the
Indians another score. Again near
the end of the game, Goff fought his
way to the goal line and there made
the last score of the game to give the
Indians a win over the Dons, 11-0.
