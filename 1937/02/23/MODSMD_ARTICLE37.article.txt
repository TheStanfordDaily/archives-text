# Frosh Cagers Lose Tilts To Bears, Broncs
## Gorter's Men Take First Defeat of Season After Eleven Straight Wins 
### HARRY PRESS 
Defeat, as it must to all men, came j
this week-end to Little Chief Pap- ;
oose, long-time (11 consecutive
games) undefeated basketball rep-!
resentative of Stanford and the Class 1
of '40.
Mute figures on the scoreboard'
gave evidence of what happened. The j
first night, they read 42-29, for Little j
Chief Papoose had sustained a hor
rible mangling at the claws of several !
Bear Cubs from Berkeley. The next j
night, the Chief tried to ride a baby
Bronc from Santa Clara, and failed
miserably, 52-43.
Lost Out Early
Against the Cubs, the Chief got
behind at the start, never to catch
up, became panicky, and lost all !
chance of ever becoming co-ordinat- !
ed. The better eye and smoother |
passing of the Cubs gave them an j
early lead, which increased to 20-12 1
at half time. Van Horn, speedy |
southpaw forward for the Cubs, led
his quintet to victory with 11 points.
He, however, did not nab high-point
honors, but yielded to Andy Ander
son of the Papooses, who scored 14
markers.
Lost Out Late
Next evening a Mr. Gianini and
friends from down Santa Clara way
bucked the Chief plenty hard, but
Chiefy stayed on the Bronc's back a
long time before slipping. The Pap
oose quintet roared into a 5-0 lead i
in no time, and soon increased it to i
10-5. Then, however, the game i
tightened up, and at halftime, the
Broncs led, 21-20.
The second half found the two;
fives tied up at 36 apiece with seven
minutes to go, by virtue of the j
Papoose team's coming from behind ,
to knot the score. From then on in, i
however, the Broncs proved too j
much for the Chief, moving rapidly j
ahead. Santa Clara's Gianini, with ,
14 points, was high for the evening, |
while Stanford's Lyon was next with
10.
