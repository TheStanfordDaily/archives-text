SOMETHING OUGHT
TO BE DONE
That Gymnasium for Men, as they
would have it called, over at Berke
ley is no doubt a fine place. It holds
something like 8000 persons, even if
they do have to stack them in from
floor level to rafters like so many
sardines.
The press box, too, while not a
wonderful example of what a press
box should be, is not so bad in a
purely material way.
But the organization of the seating
facilities, particularly in that fair-to
middling press box, is a sin and a
shame. Ken Priestly, graduate man
ager at California, ought to take a
little time out some day to go over
to the Gymnasium for Men and make
a per onal count of the number of
seats in that press box.
There are jut;t so many seats in
• the front row, and they are needed
by sports writers so that they may
have the use of the board as a sup
purl for their writing. The Stanford
Daily had two men in the box Fri
day night, one keeping a score book
and one keeping a running score and
game notes. The fellow keeping the
running score had, fortunately, a
small corner of one of the boards to
work upon. The other used his lap.
Sitting next to the one using his
lap were an avid feminine Stanford
rooter and her escort, both with a
board to support their elbows.
Now, if Mr. Priestly would just
give those non-workers Oakleys that
would entitle them to second-row
press box seats, and preserve the
working facilities for the ones who
need them, everything would be just
dandy.
The Stanford Pavilion might be
small, but the right persons get the
right press box seats.
MAYBE IT'S
A RECORD
Captain Dinty Moore, the aggres
sive Cardinal captain, is just about
keeping the sports department of the
Daily Californian supplied with
enough material for dirty cracks. The
square-jawed one has played nine
conference games, has committed 31
personal fouls. Now, this wouldn't
be mentioned here, except that the
hawk-eyed Bob Wesson, sports edi
otr of the Daily Cal, is a cinch to
pick it up, and we couldn't let him
scoop us.
YEAII. BANNON,
YOU SHOULD TALK
While speaking of fouls, there
might be mentioned a little by-play
that occurred in Saturday night's
game against the Broncs. There was
a free ball, and a Stanford man and
a Santa Clara man dived for it. The
Bronco got there first, and the Card
fouled him in his efforts to retrieve.
Charlie Bannon, Bronc guard, who
is no lily on a basketball floor, saw
the play and yelled to Referee Ernie
IJailly in a very hurt tone, "Oh, foul,
Bailly, who has a build very much
like a teddy-bear, incidentally, came
back with a coy, "I'll call the fouls
here. Charlie." And so he did.
THEY DON'T DO BIGHT
BY LITTLE NELL
Nellie Heath went into the Santa
Clara game late in the second half,
when the going began to get pretty
rough and John Bunn decided he
had better jerk the more fragile first
string. It wasn't long before he got
fouled himself — Heath, we mean—
and he sank one of the two foul
throws awarded.
The success of his toss got him
quite a hand from the Indians on the
bench. But if was nothing to the roar
that went up from his confreres
when he scored a set-up for two
points. Little Nell certainly takes a
lot of ribbing with his basketball.
