# Indian Quintet Conquors Cal To Break Jinx
## Hoopmen Clinch Series; Luisetti, Zonne, Injured As Broncos Fall, 54-25 
### 
Coach John Bunn and his laugh
| ing Stanford basketeers did right
well for themselves last week-end.
On Friday night the boys clinched
the first California series that Stan
ford has won in 16 years of trying,
by the uncomfortably narrow mar
j gin of 36-32, in a game that marked
Stanford's third straight over Cal,
j and on Saturday evening larrupped
j George Bearsi's Santa Clara Broncos,
i 54-25.
Two Men Injured
One unpleasant feature of the two
| day period of point-making were the
j injuries incurred in the Santa Clara
I set-to by Bob Zonne, who threw his
] shoulder out of joint in a mix-up un-
I der the Bronco basket, and by Hank
' Luisetti, who aggravated an old knee
i injury.
In all probability, neither will be
j kept from seeing action against
j U.S.C. next Friday and Saturday,
though Zonne's shoulder will very
likely necessitate a couple of days'
layoff from practice. The entire
squad will rest today.
The California contest was really a
humdinger, with the Bears pulling
up from 26-34 to 30-34 with three
minutes to go, on a pair of field goals
by Lilot and a 30-foot attempt by
Ray Balsley.
More Fouls Out
| Captain Dinty Moore had been
evicted on four personals a couple
of minutes previous and 4 the Bears
were bidding fair to wipe out that
four-digit lead, until Howie Turner
sewed it up with a pretty under
j basket try on Calderwood's pass.
On Saturday, Bunn started four
second-stringers, Robertson, Phil
Zonne, H. B. Lee, and Bob Zonne,
with Art Stoefen, and the lads more
than held their own with the Broncs.
And when Luisetti entered the fray,
it was all over.

up from 26-34 to 30-34 with three
minutes to go, on a pair of field goals
by Lilot and a 30-foot attempt by
Ray Balsley.
More Fouls Out
| Captain Dinty Moore had been
evicted on four personals a couple
of minutes previous and 4 the Bears
were bidding fair to wipe out that
four-digit lead, until Howie Turner
sewed it up with a pretty under
j basket try on Calderwood's pass.
On Saturday, Bunn started four
second-stringers, Robertson, Phil
Zonne, H. B. Lee, and Bob Zonne,
with Art Stoefen, and the lads more
than held their own with the Broncs.
And when Luisetti entered the fray,
it was all over.

Coach John Bunn and his laugh
| ing Stanford basketeers did right
well for themselves last week-end.
On Friday night the boys clinched
the first California series that Stan
ford has won in 16 years of trying,
by the uncomfortably narrow mar
j gin of 36-32, in a game that marked
Stanford's third straight over Cal,
j and on Saturday evening larrupped
j George Bearsi's Santa Clara Broncos,
i 54-25.
Two Men Injured
One unpleasant feature of the two
| day period of point-making were the
j injuries incurred in the Santa Clara
I set-to by Bob Zonne, who threw his
] shoulder out of joint in a mix-up un-
I der the Bronco basket, and by Hank
' Luisetti, who aggravated an old knee
i injury.
In all probability, neither will be
j kept from seeing action against
j U.S.C. next Friday and Saturday,
though Zonne's shoulder will very
likely necessitate a couple of days'
layoff from practice. The entire
squad will rest today.
The California contest was really a
humdinger, with the Bears pulling
up from 26-34 to 30-34 with three
minutes to go, on a pair of field goals
by Lilot and a 30-foot attempt by
Ray Balsley.
