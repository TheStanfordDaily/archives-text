# Varsity Nine Wins League Opener, 10-5
## Wolter's Men Beat Santa Clara in Fast Game; Credit Win to Griffin 
### ART ALLEN 
Line singles by Pinch-hitter Mat
thews and First-baseman Holman,
three walks, and four Santa Clara
errors combined to give the Stanford
varsity baseball team live runs in
the last of the eighth inning, a 10-5
margin of victory, and a successful
inauguration of the C.1.8.A. season
here Saturday afternoon.
Both coaches, Justin Fitzgerald of
the Broncos and Harry Wolter of the
Cards, used 15 players in efforts to
turn the tide, while the lead changed
hands five times. Three times Stan
ford pitchers were replaced with two
outs and Santa Clara runners on the
bases, and each time the new hurler
struck out the succeeding Bronco
batsman.
Wolter Thinks Fast
Still another move of the local
board of strategy was successful with
Stanford leading G-5 during the
eighth inning rally with the bases
filled. WaUy deWitt, a left-handed
batsman, was sent in to pinch-hit for
Dick Hanna against the right-handed
hurling of Bricca. Fitzgerald chang
ed pitchers, substituting his ace left
hander, Selenger. Wolter switched
hitters, putting in "Box" Matthews,
who responded with a long single,
scoring two runs.
George Farrell and Leonard Linde
were the batting leaders for Stan
ford, knocking in three and two runs,
respectively; Farrell's bat accounted
for the longest hit of the day, a triple
to deep right-center field. Blaettler,
with a triple, double, and single, in
four trips led the Bronco attack.
Joie Griffin was the winning pitcher
for the home guard.
