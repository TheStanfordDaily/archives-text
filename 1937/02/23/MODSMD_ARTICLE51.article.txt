# One Medal, Unawarded

MR. ROTH'S leather medal for the campus
Aristotle who solves the baffling garage
problem still hangs in his office. And as it
gathers dust by day, Stanford's automobiles
continue to expand and contract in the open air
by night.
There was one suggestion which on the sur
face looked like a partial solution. As long as
the University was going to build two new
wings to Lagunita Court, it could utilize the
basement space for a garage. But logical Mr.
Roth soon punctured the proposal with ade
quate objections, awarded no medal.
In the first place there's the water-level. With
the lake so near, seepage would soon fill up
the basements. Both Roble and Lagunita even
now pump water out of their kitchens after
every rain.
More than that, fire regulations would pre
vent garages in dormitory cellars. The hazard
is too great. And exhaust fumes would sift
upstairs, soon start bothering sensitive-scented
women.
Lagunita garages are out. And until some
body thinks of another scheme, so are the
cars.â€”D. B.
