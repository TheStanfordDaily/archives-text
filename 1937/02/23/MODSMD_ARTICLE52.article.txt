# Free the Wife?
## 
### 
ACCORDING to Professor Ernest Hilgard of
the Psych department, modern wives must
be more than "contented cows."
He recommended to the Women and Modern
Society class that the modern wife be free to
secure a job so she could escape the bovine
status if not the bovine stature and contribute
to society with her talents.
Which advice is probably the fruit of much
dark study, but which correlates with devastat
ing negativeness with the arrival of a most well
lit spring.
For if the present crop of Stanford women
are representative of future wives, they are
distinctly not bovine. All we know is what we
see, but our eyesight has unalterably deter
mined this fact.
Furthermore, the necessity for wives to "have
something worth while to offer in conversation"
may be dictated by sociology, but is not dic
tated by the milieu of a moonlit evening on
Lagunita.
At present, we find Dr. Hilgard's advice about
the women being traditionally subservient to
the male and his command that they "arise and
break the shackles" of kitchen slavery, defi
nitely out of order.
They seem to be leading a most un-subser
vient life while being subservient.
As a matter of fact, they seem to be going to
town purely by the expedient of being subser
vient.
They are playing a winning game these days.
Ferhaps what Dr. Hilgard means is that they
should stop bluffing about their meekness and
frailness, and admit they hold all the cards
when spring is the umpire.
'Cause they do, they definitely do.
