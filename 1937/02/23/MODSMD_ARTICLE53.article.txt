THE main trouble with getting a college edu
cation is thai it interferes with one's reading.
Whether a student is a True Confessions ad
dict, a scanner of James Joyce for the usual
reason, or a real lover of literature for its own
sake, the opportunities to keep up with outside
reading while in college are lamentably cur
tailed.
Were anyone to do all the work expected of
him by the professors in a quarter, he would
be unable to find time to peruse such literary
gems as Dick Tracy and Harold Teen. Even

skimming through with a modicum of work
limits one's literary consumption to a daily
glance at the paper and occasional reading of
short short stories fond in old waiting room
copies of Liberty and Colliers.
It is doubtful if the campus average of fiction
books per year is over two, and that includes
"Turnabout," "Tarzan" and "Tom Swift."
Everyone has heard the story of the lit major
who was given a copy of "The Moon and Six
pence" when he came to school and hopes to
read it this summer after graduating, while he's
putting in sixteen hours daily of hard labor.
Camels have been barred from some of the
streets of Palestine because they slow up
traffic. What we need in America is camels.
Most modern youths enter college plastic
and go out plastered.—Prof. H. Dowling, Holy
Cross College
I love to be alone. 1 never found the com
panion that was so companionable as soli
tude.—William Thoreau
