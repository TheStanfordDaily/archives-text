i HASHER'S monograph on the eating club situa
tion and my-what-fun-we-have was rudely inter
rupted by Gen. Washington and his birthday.
General Washington kept knocking on the door and
walking in and saying, "Isn't this a fine birthday." And
everybody would throw him out and tell him next time
to bring his horse. Which he did. And everybody
laughed and said they thought it was just like Valen
tine's Day (you know: "At miles between us we can
laugh, our hearts entwined by telegraph," or "Cupid's
wings are not so fast: I'd rather send a wire. Then I'm
sure my Valentine will set your heart on fire"). Any
way, you can see that Our Hasher was interrupted by
Gen. Washington and his birthday.
"I've never been on skiis before in my life," she
said. The next moment she was deadâ€”her heart en
twined by telegraph.
In El Capitan Club they play pranks on each other.
One prankster thought it would be very funny to put
a laboratory dogfish wrapped as a gift on the plate of
the club president and cover it with a napkin. This
was very funny, except that the club president didn't
come to dinner that evening.
So the humorist, being very tired of waiting for the
president who wasn't coming to dinner, picked up the
advancement to science, hollered to one of the members
at the end of the table to catch it, and threw it at him.
However, the trajectory wasn't up to expectory, and
the dogfishing into the gravy bowl.
In the Library the other day there was a girl reading
a book. The title of the book was "American Slavery."
It was dedicated "To My Wife."
At this juncture General Washington walked into
El Capitan Club, feeling like nothing so much as a
bowl of shredded wheat. They told him to get his horse,
but all he did was pick up a gun that was lying on the
table, aim it at an El Capitan member and pull the
trigger.
He didn't know it wasn't loaded, he said. The El
Capitans may think this is funny, but I don't.
The Alpha Delt brothers are holding for themselves
a dance this week-end. One of the brothers one eve
ning, feeling like nothing so much as a bowl of shred
ded wheat, called up lots of pretty girls on the phone
and got dates for all the lads, saying that the lad in
question had passed the shredded wheat stage, and
that his last words were get a date with and tell
her "I love her."
Everybody woke up the next morning and found
that their hearts were entwined by telephone, and were
very embarrassed and started to get unentwined.
But they were not nearly so embarrassed as two
Roble room-mates. Said A: "My, I'm going to the Al
pha Delt. formal. Said B: "My, my I'm going to the
Alpha Delt formal, too." Said A: "My, my, I'm going
with Walt." Said B: "My, my, I'm going with Walt."
Said A and B: "What?" Said A to B and B to A: "What
do you mean you're going with Walt, I'm going with
Walt." Said A and B: "Oh dear." Said Walt: "I'm
very sorry, but "
Then, too, there happened that in El Capitan one of
the humorists thought he would have some fun with a
dogfish wrapped for mailing. So he took out both the
eyes, and put them in a member's cup of coffee. When
the member finished drinking the cup of coffee, he
saw the eyes in the bottom of the cup.
