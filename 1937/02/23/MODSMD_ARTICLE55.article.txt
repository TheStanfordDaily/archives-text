TROPICAL FISH

IN A STRIKING editorial, Gordy Frost drew a neat
parallel Friday between the man who views the city
skyline through the windows of a darkened room, and
the Stanford student, whose room is well-lit, and who
sees only himself and his room reflected in' the window.
The simplicity of Gordy's writing made his editorial
a stream-lined barb that should have punctured the
glossy hide of more than one Stanfordite.
But it will ricochete into the limbo of yesterday's
cdilorials. The Stanford man is just as streamlined as
Gordy's barb.

He is hard, glittering, worldly-wise of his own little
world.
After four years of classes, spent dunking himself
in the academically-perfumed facts of life, he neither
knows or cares about the world outside.
His is a life of constantly contracting horizons. At
Stanford his world is 9000 acres. In pap's brokerage
shop, his world is a neat office 12 feet square and a neat
living room 16 feet square with marine view and open
fireplace.
He is the best people.
But he is.- really the worst. He is of much less con
sequence than a goldfish, even though his bowl is of
finer stuff than ordinary glass.
And while a goldfish will occasionally have his
water changed, the environment of the Stanford man is
constant. He lives out his college life a milieu that be
comes more and more stale, and he with it.
There seem'-' to be a single difference between the
common and Stanford varieties of goldfish.
The fish is constantly bruising his snout on the glass,
trying to get out. The Stanford man is content to swim
around in circles.
The result is that the Stanford man has a prettier
snout than the goldfish.
