# THE
						BAR OF CAMPUS OPINION
## HE CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In your Hearstian sensational pan
acea offered in the Daily of February
15, there are certain fallacies that
border on sophistry. No sincere,
thinking editor could publish such
an editorial as your melodramatic

masterpiece.
Let us consid
er the first "in
telligent instilla
tion" of a bar in
the Union:
1. Anyone with
an y experience
realizes that af
ter a few drinks
the urge to go
places becomes
doubly strong.
Thus, after a few

drinks at the Union the drinking
student would be on his way to some
other bar and, not only would he be
coming home under the influence of
liquor, but he would be going to his
destination under its influence. This
would double the chances for an ac
cident.
2. There can be no such thing as
"safe and sane supervised drinking."
That in itself would defeat the very
purpose of drinking. With proper
supervision your drinking student
after the few drinks they would be
allowed, would be ofT, half-cocked,
to some bar where there was no su
pervision. This again would defeat
the purpose of the Union Bar. Fur
thermore, it is the duty of the uni
versity to help the student; present
ing alcoholic beverages to him would
be the antithesis of this.
If the University were to offer en
tertainment commensurate to that of
the city, it would have to be a com
bination Liberty Street Burlesque-
Peacock Court-Deauville Club every
week-end. Such is not possible.
Everyone's social demand curve is
different, and no matter what the
University should offer there would
always be a number of students who
would seek their entertainment off
campus.
Furthermore, it does not take
much sagacity to realize that ihe
student who leaves the campus for
his entertainment does so more for
the change of environment, to get
away from the school once in a
while. Suppose that we did have i
Jimmy Dorsey or a King-Queen
contest every week. After the nov- ■
elty had worn off, the same group
of students that go off-campus for j
their entertainment would still be
going off-campus.
I can't help but feel that this edi
torial was written for the sensational
effect rather than a sincere desire ot
ameliorate the existing social con- j
ditions,.
Sincerely,
J. B. G.
