Dear Bob:
You are just looking to have our
fine Daily' censored when you write
those ass-sens editorial always kick
ink about someone or something.

Your recent edi
torial on liquor
on the campus is
the last straw,
p a r t i cularly in
writing the S. F.
papers.
You may be a
bit indiscrete —
but you are one
of a few. Not all
of us are. You
should live on

the campus—where there are some

kids getting a kick out of life being
sober.
Try it; it's really swell fun.
With refrets,
Dumb as hell, but sober
For the last time, the Daily did
not write, wire, radio, or flag any
S.F. paper.—The Editor.
