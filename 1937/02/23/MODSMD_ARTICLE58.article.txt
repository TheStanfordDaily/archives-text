The Editor, Sir:
I was amused at your assinine edi
torial on alcohol and gasoline. Ob
viously you desire to attract atten
tion and therefore still are trying out
the antique policy that a good col
lege newspaper editor is one who is
radical.
But why not really be a radical?
Why not propose that the adminis

tration should allow houses of pros
titution to exist on the campus so
her Stanford gentlemen will not go

off the campus as
they do, and
are exposed to
syphilis.
Yes, it would
be the adminis
tration's fault if
any Stanford
student contract
ed the disease.
Perhaps if you
had written an
editorial on this

subject your name would have been
on the front page of the Chronicle
instead of the last. Let's have a
newspaper, not a lot of baloney. Most
of the students are too busy trying
to keep from flunking out, much
less drinking their way out of school.
So if you can't think of anything im
portant to write about, dry up. I
dare you to print this.
