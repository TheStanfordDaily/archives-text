# IT IS DISGUSTING

The Editor, Sir:
That editorial in the Daily advo
cating a boozery on the campus is
about the most disgusting thing I
have read for some time, and I cer
tainly hope it doesn't express the

sentiments of the Daily staff in gen
eral. I'm glad that you admit that
12. r ),000,00U people v/ould cry in
shame if such a thing was attempted.
So far, our

c a m p us dances
have been al
mo st entirely
free of the
drunks which
inhabit the
brawls at most
o th er universi
ties, and I sup
pose you think
th e reason for
this is a deep
dark secret. I

also suppose you would rather see
a hundred freshmen learn to drink
than to see one drunk benefit hu
manity by breaking his fool neck.
If there are any students here who
have so little sense that they can't
wait until they get home from these
various outlying dumps you mention
to drink their liquor, it's not likely
they could wait until they got home
from the Cellar. Of course you could
overcome this difficulty by installing
several bars at various convenient
points such as in Roble and Eneina,
or possibly eve.- rn the University
Chapel. Dr. Trueblood could then be
general supervisor and see that

everything was carried on strictly
according to Hoyle.
Pardon me for taking up so much
of your valuable space with my un
prolifie suggestions because you
doubtless have many similar ones
on tap.
Very truly yours,
N. I. H.
