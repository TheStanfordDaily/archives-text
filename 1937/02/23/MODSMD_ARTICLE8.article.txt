Tomorrow night the second of the
Recreation Club dances will be held
in Roble Gym, The dance is a date
affair, no stags being admitted. Ad
mission will be 25 cents a couple.
Those who went to the Club's dance
last week are enthusiastic over the
idea and said they had a swell time.
Couples will dance to a four-piece
orchestra, according to Bill Ward,
manager. The club is searching for
a permanent home for the affairs
and to that end will try the Women's
Clubhouse next Wednesday night.
