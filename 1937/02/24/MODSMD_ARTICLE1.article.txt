# Contractors To Start New Work Friday
## Lagunita and Cubberley Building Excavation Bids Okayed by Roth 
### 
The excavation contract for the
addition to Lagunita Court and for
Cubberley Education Building was
let yesterday to Palo Alto Road Ma
terials Company, according to an
announcement by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Digging will begin on the site of
two new Lagunita wings by Friday
at the latest.
The material removed, which will
amount to 2400 cubic yards, will be
transported to the amphitheater,
where it will be used in construction
of the earth bowl.
Topsoil Ready
Following completion of the La
gunita job, the contractor will dig up
9000 yards of dirt at the site of the
Cubberley Building and move it over
to the amphitheater.
Top covering for the amphitheater
earthwork will be provided by 6700
yards of black soil to be moved there
from Governor's Lane under the
same contract. This topsoil was re
moved from the new right-of-way of
the "lane" and piled up along the old
site when that thoroughfare was
abandoned a few months ago.
Surplus Raises Rim
Mr. Roth expects that the whole
job of excavating and transporting
dirt will be completed within 30
days, so that planting on the amphi
thealer may proceed according to
schedule.
On account of these timely trans
fers of soil, the total amount of ma
terials available for the amphitheater
will be greater than was originally
expected by about 10,000 yards. The
surplus will enable the rim behind
the stage to be built high enough to
exclude all view of the Memorial
Theater and other campus buildings
from amphitheater audiences.
