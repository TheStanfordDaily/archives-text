# Color Melodies Light Theater
## System Permits Special Blends in Illumination 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Like a master organist creating
melodies at the keyboard of his in
strument, the electrician at the con
trol board in the new theater can
project symphonies of light upon the
stage from the orchestra pit.
This switch dimmer board consists
of a maze of red, blue, yellow, and
whtie keys which control indirectly
the flow of electricity to banks and
sets of lights, just as the keys of an
organ control the flow of air through
the pipes. Special levers are provid
ed to regulate large groups of lights,
and by others the lighting for three
entire scenes may be prearranged
and set by merely pulling one switch.
Regulates Combinations
This switch board and another like
it, which has already been installed
in the projection room of the little
theater, regulates the strength, com
binations, and colors of the lighting
by remote control. The equipment,
known as dual control, was designed
by Hunter and Hudson of San Fran
cisco; it has been used only twice
before, in the Radio City Music Hall
and in the Kansas City Municipal
Auditorium.
The switchboard is provided with
three "hot switches" which turn on
the auditorium and stage lights
without dimming when it is used as
a regular class room. There are
three swicthes for the same purpose
at each entrance to the theater.
