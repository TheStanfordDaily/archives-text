# Building Stanford's Theater
## 
### 
Holophane recessed lighting fix
tures are being used to illuminate
the auditorium. They are set in iron
angle frames in the ceiling with their
cords running into a gutter that runs
around the top of the wall. The ef
fect of these fixtures will be that of
a beautiful geometric design com
posed of colored squares on the ceil
ing. The design may be changed at
will by lighting some squares and
not lighting others, and changing the
colors of the lights.
Another original feature of the
theater is a large curtain which can
be lowered from a slot just in front

of the balcony, shutting off the rear
portion of the house. This will im
prove the -acoustics when there are
small audiences.
Installed in Vault
The stage switch dimmer board,
which actually controls the lights,
was designed by Dr. Leland H.
Brown of the illumination labora
tory. This equipment, along with the
plug board, was installed in a special
vault below the stage last week un
der the direction of Mr. Ralph W.
Millard.

switch boards, it is possible to fol
low the electrical system through
the circuits to the plug board. This
device controls the lighting for dif
ferent scenes in the main auditorium
and the little theater. From the plug
board the circuits lead to the elab
orate stage switch board. It includes
24 reactors that actually dim the
lights on the stage, 6 house con
tracted, and 4 contracters without
readers. The system consists of a
series of tubes known as hysterset
controls.
Install Floods
Large hanging banks and borders
of lights will soon be installed on
the stage. Floods and spots are now
in place in front of the curtain slot at
the rear of the theater. By means of
sliding tormentors, the stage open
ing, which is 30 feet high and 40
feet wide, can be made smaller. The
banks of lights slide with the tor
mentors, thus solving what would
otherwise be a difficult lighting
problem.
Emergency illumination facilities
have been provided for the theater.
If the electricity goes off, the light
circuits automatically switch to a
bank of storage batteries, for which
recharging equipment is provided,
without any interruption in service.
