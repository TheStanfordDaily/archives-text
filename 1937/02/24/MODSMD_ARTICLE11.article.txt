# Building Stanford's Theater
## 
### 
Holophane recessed lighting fix
tures are being used to illuminate
the auditorium. They are set in iron
angle frames in the ceiling with their
cords running into a gutter that runs
around the top of the wall. The ef
fect of these fixtures will be that of
a beautiful geometric design com
posed of colored squares on the ceil
ing. The design may be changed at
will by lighting some squares and
not lighting others, and changing the
colors of the lights.
Another original feature of the
theater is a large curtain which can
be lowered from a slot just in front

of the balcony, shutting off the rear
portion of the house. This will im
prove the -acoustics when there are
small audiences.
Installed in Vault
The stage switch dimmer board,
which actually controls the lights,
was designed by Dr. Leland H.
Brown of the illumination labora
tory. This equipment, along with the
plug board, was installed in a special
vault below the stage last week un
der the direction of Mr. Ralph W.
Millard.
