# L.A. Alumni Told Of Stanford Fund
## 
### 
Enthusiasm for the Stanford Fund,
new movement that is trying to in
crease the University's endowment
and increase the funds at its dis
posal, was aroused in the hearts and
purses of the alumni of the southern
part of the state at a banquet in Los
Angeles last Friday night.
There were 150 members of the
Alumni Association and Stanford
Associates present at the affair,
which was held in the Biltmore Ho
tel. It was judged a complete suc
cess by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds and
Mr. Paul Davis, who are in charge
of the fund. The purpose of the din
ner was to announce the organiza
tion of the Stanford Fund to all the
citizens of Southern California who
would be interested in making grants
or bequests.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Comptroller Almon E. Roth. Francis
Price of the Board of Trustees, and
Dr. Reynolds were the speakers of
the evening. In his talk Dr. Wilbur
discussed Stanford's position in the
state as a privately endowed uni
versity and he emphasized the neces
sity of supporting it if its position
is to be maintained. The purpose of
the Stanford Fund has now been
announced throughout California,
and its work will soon be underway.
