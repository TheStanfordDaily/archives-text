# Sword, Sandals To Offer Reading
## 
### 
Balancing the recent surge of
heavy drama on the campus, Sword
and Sandals will give a reading of
"Brief Moment," a completely mad
cap comedy, tomorrow evening in
the Little Theater at 8 o'clock.
To be seen in the leading role is
Jane Claiy as Abbey Fane, tem
pestuous night club entertainer who
rises to wealth and social standing
because a rich man's son thinks she
will make a soothing and simple
wife. The rest of the cast is com
posed almost entirely of menâ€”Ken
Peters, Harold Kahn, Jack Beattie,
Bill Goldner, Jim Corner, and
Marshall Dill. Pauline Stevens is
the only other woman character.
Ina Claire brought Abbey to San
Francisco a few seasons ago scoring
a tremendous success. In New York
Alexander Woolcott acted the part of
Sigfrit, which S. N. Behrman in
tended for him when he was writing
the play.
