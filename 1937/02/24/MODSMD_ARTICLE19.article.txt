## Campus Complaints Will Go Before A. S. S. U. Relations Committee 
### 
With "gripes" and suggestions al
ready coming across his desk, Presi
dent Jim Reynolds announced yes
terday that his new Committee on
Student-Faculty Relations is ready
to function.
A three-fold purpose of the Com
mittee has been outlined—to plan
the A.S.S.U. - sponsored Current
Events course, to arrange student
faculty social gatherings, and to re
ceive suggestions from students and
professors for betterment of aca
demic instruction.
Receive Suggestions
Reynolds explained the procedure
as follows:
1. Communications must he
written, addressed to the A.S.S.U.
president.
2. They must be signed, hut will
be considered confidential by the
Committee.
3. Suggestions may be along
these lines: requests for new
courses, requests for changing old
courses, ideas for bettering present
methods of instruction as to lec
tures, syllabuses, professors' meth
ods of presenting thfeir material—
simply, "is the prof any good?"—
and miscellaneous proposals for
improving student-faculty rela
tions in general.
Hilgarde to Advise
Ernest Hilgarde, professor of psy
chology, has already agreed to join
the committee in an advisory ca
pacity. Edgar Eugene Robinson, pro
fessor of history, will probably be
come a member when he returns
from the East.
Esther Pelton, Jack Calderwood,
and Reynolds will serve as a sub
committee to plan the Current
Events course. Heading social rela
tions is Jean Bird with Bob Adams
assisting. The committee as a whole
will receive student and faculty sug
gestions.
Meets Each Week
The possibilities of a new spring
quarter course on "How to See Eu
rope," of making Business Law three
quarters instead of two, are already
being considered by the committee.
A series of vocational guidance lec
tures may be proposed. Also on the
docket are several "gripes" about
professors.
The Committee will meet every
week, beginning next week.
