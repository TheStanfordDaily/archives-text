# Trueblood Asks Campus Leaders To Boom Chapel
## Ex Committee Moves To Join Nations* Colleges in Peace Demonstration 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
"If the Lord Himself came to speak in the Chapel, I wonder how many
students would come to hear Him." Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Stanford's
chaplain, asked Ex Committee last night.
In an effort to increase student attendance at Sunday morning services.
Dr. Trueblood asked Ex Committee for a practical method of heightening
student interest.
"The Chapel is the center of the University geographically but not in
fact," he told the body. "We must make it vital, real, living. We must
♦make the students, all the students,

feel that the Chapel is the center of
their spiritual life."
Frosh, Seniors Go to Church
The chaplain said the general tone
of the campus is that "you go to
church the first Sunday as a fresh
man and not again until you are a
senior."
He suggested that Ex Committee
or some appropriate body appoint a
student each week to read the scrip
ture lesson, but the Committee
doubted the benefits 01* such action.
Dr. Trueblood thought students
themselves should help select the
week's speaker.
"Fancy Tourist Spot"
Stanford attendance at the Chapel
is good, the chaplain said, but the
Church is "mostly a fancy place for
tourists." He has $2000 a year to
bring outside speakers to the Farm,
would like to spend it on men the
campus really wants to hear.
The matter was referred to the
new Committee on Student-Faculty
Relations. Reynolds asked that stu
dents contribute ideas to that body.
Other Ex Committee business in
cluded:
DANCE CANCELED: The AS.
S.U. dance next Saturday night was
called off because of conflict with
the Lagunita informal.
RESTRICTION of officers: Presi
dent Jim Reynolds appointed Ruth
Goodan, Barbara Kimball, and Larry
Rouble to draw up suggestions for a
new system of restricting the num
ber of A.S.S.U. posts any one student
can hold. Reynolds' idea met cries
of "lost efficiency" and "politics!"
but his theory of student government
called for "giving as many as pos
sible the chance to participate."
PEACE CELEBRATION: Ex Com
mittee voted to join the nation's
colleges in celebrating Peace Day
April 22. The National Student Fed
eration of America, of which Stan
ford is a member, asked this campus
for "a vigorous and unified stand on
peace."
Roy Anderson recalled the Farm's
"cool-headed" assembly and forums
last year, commented that in the
face of other colleges' "strikes" Stan
ford's stand brought iavorable no
tice. Esther Pelton and Cynthia
Coonley will plan the same type of
celebration for this year.
PALY THEATER PRICES: The
defunct committee which attempted
negotiation for lowering Palo Alto
theater prices will again become ac
tive, Reynolds declaimed.
ELECTION SET-UP: The Law
Steps and the Engineering Corner
became permanent polling places,
8:3 Oto 2 o'clock permanent polling
time when Ex Committee changed
an A.S.S.U. by-law. Election Board's
request for Rally Committee help
in counting votes was not granted.
NITERY: Final plans for the Un

for approval.

One-quarter "survey" courses

popular U.C. subjects.

"If the Lord Himself came to speak in the Chapel, I wonder how many
students would come to hear Him." Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Stanford's
chaplain, asked Ex Committee last night.
In an effort to increase student attendance at Sunday morning services.
Dr. Trueblood asked Ex Committee for a practical method of heightening
student interest.
"The Chapel is the center of the University geographically but not in
fact," he told the body. "We must make it vital, real, living. We must
♦make the students, all the students,

feel that the Chapel is the center of
their spiritual life."
Frosh, Seniors Go to Church
The chaplain said the general tone
of the campus is that "you go to
church the first Sunday as a fresh
man and not again until you are a
senior."
He suggested that Ex Committee
or some appropriate body appoint a
student each week to read the scrip
ture lesson, but the Committee
doubted the benefits 01* such action.
Dr. Trueblood thought students
themselves should help select the
week's speaker.
"Fancy Tourist Spot"
Stanford attendance at the Chapel
is good, the chaplain said, but the
Church is "mostly a fancy place for
tourists." He has $2000 a year to
bring outside speakers to the Farm,
would like to spend it on men the
campus really wants to hear.
The matter was referred to the
new Committee on Student-Faculty
Relations. Reynolds asked that stu
dents contribute ideas to that body.

Goodan, Barbara Kimball, and Larry
Rouble to draw up suggestions for a
new system of restricting the num
ber of A.S.S.U. posts any one student
can hold. Reynolds' idea met cries
of "lost efficiency" and "politics!"
