# Farm's Miner-Professor Uses Power Sledge to Conquer Snow
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Besides being a professor of eco
nomic geology at Stanford, Mr. Cy
rus Fisher Tolman pays people to
mine for precious metals and at
present to transport provisions and
equipment by sled when roads are
.snowed under.
A record snow-fall of 15 feet
makes it necessary to use a sled in
carrying provisions to the 32 men
who are working his small gold mine
in the Sierras. The holding is called
the Granite Basin Mine, and it is
northeast of Sacramento and about
GO miles from Oroville.
Mine Snowed In
When the snow began to fall, it
looked bad for the mining business
until Mr. Tolman bought his little
Tucker Snow Sled. In the last two
weeks the sled has made four trips
to the mine. Provisions were laid in
for the winter, but these trips bring
in certain foods and other necessities
that run short.
The 00-mile trek from Oroville
has to be made at night, because
the snow must have a slight crust.
It takes 10 to 12 hours, and top
speed is 10 miles per hour.
Motorcycle Engine Used
A motorcycle engine operates the
machine by revolving a screw type
propeller in the snow. With its body
about 10 feet long, the length is
brought up to about 20 feet by the
long propeller and by a ski extend
ing out in front. The load is carried
on a ski trailer, and as much as 1000
pounds can be drawn.
Tolman expects the deep snow to
'ast till the middle of June. Difficul
lies to be faced before that time,
lowever, include traversing bare
;pots when the snow has melted
ome but befoi'e the highway has
. een opened. Mr. Tolman contem
: ilates rigging to the machine wheels
which can be exchanged with the
: kis.
The Granite Basin Mine is Mr.
'olman's only mine. His greatest ac- i
livity comes in the capacity of a I
Mining geologist.
