MAYBE IT WILL.
MAYBE IT WON T
The Board of Athletic Control
takes a squint at the wrestling sit
uation, among other things, when it
holds its weekly meeting tonight.
Now, recently there has been a
litie agitation on the part of grunt
and groan sympathizers to have
wrestling raised ot the status of a
minor sport, on a par with boxing,
loncing, or even gymnastics.
Fred Williams. Ex Committee
man detailed to have a chat with
(iraHuate Manager Al Masters on
the lav of the land, talked to the
head man yesterday and found
that the move is opposed on the
grounds that it will take a certain
amount of dough.
The wrestlers want $G0 as their
annual budget, so that they might
schedule a few meets and perhaps
lake a trip or two. As it is now,
wrestling is practically nothing but a
friendly get-together where some of
the boys come out and try to strangle
each other just for the fun of it. They
have no official coach, but Jerry
Torrance, a student, sort of gives a
few pointers now and then to help
the boys out.
Torrance came here from San
Diego High as an All-Southern
California high school champion in
his weight class, expecting to find
something in the way of wrestling
that he might engage in while he
wasn't studying. Instead, he
found at Stanford a wrestling team
that wasn't even a team, and he has
done his best to develop the squad
to the point where it would de
serve recognition as a minor sport.
The wrestlers feel that they have
reached the point now where they
are worthy of a little notice, and so
they have been asking to be includ
ed in the annual sports budgets.
From the athletes' standpoint the
claim is a just one. There is no rea
son why gymnastics, for instance,
should be recognized while wrest
ling is not.
However, the standpoint taken
by Al Masters has its points, too.
I)r. Storey voiced a good point
when he said that the wrestlers
will want just $60 this year, but
next year they will need a new
mat, and the next year they will
want to expand on the trip angle,
and the whole thing will grow to
the proportions of every other
minor sport that feels it isn't get
ting a square deal.
Of course, if such a thing came
to pass, wrestling would still be
only on a par with the other sports
—it wouldn't be overstepping its
potentialities as a sport. But the
B.A.C. gripe is that adding another
sport to the list of minor athletic
activities might he too much for
(he budget-balancers.
It naturally would be a swell
thing for the muscle-stretchers if
they could earn circle letters for
their pains, but the question is still
whether the addition of it to the
ranks would be too much of a strain.
If you listen to Al Masters' and Dr.
Storey's side of it, the point they
make is readily seen.
However, the Board meets tonight
to talk oyer the situation, and the
thing will be settled once and for all.
If the athletic directors can see their
way clear to give the wrestlers a
chance, they certainly will move to
do so. Regardless of which way it
comes out; it's a pretty certain thing
that the wrestlers will get a square
deal. Masters will give them as good
a break as he possibly can—he has
no prejudice one way or the other
toward wrestling as a sport—and if
there is a chance to fix things up the
way they would like he will do it.
COME ON, LET'S WIN
A CONFERENCE TITLE
The varsity ball team won a pair
over the week-end past, which is in
itself something of the unusual, but
even better is the fact that both
games were pretty fair exhibitions of
the grand old game on the part of
the Cards. The wins over Santa
Clara and Joe Goddini's All-Stars
were not bad at all.
Today they meet St. Mary's at
Moraga, with a fine chance of win
ning. If they do it will be the first
time in a long time that the ball
team has won three straight. Good
hitting, Harry.
A few of the leading baiters are
Ihe following: Calvelli, .500; DeWitt,
.417; Heagerty, .375; Matthews,
Paine, and Rasmussen, .336; Linde,
.292; and Farrell, .286. So far the

team batting average is .226, and it
has scored 34 runs on 43 hits, which
isn't so bad. Furman is leading
pitcher with two wins and no losses.
Griffin has one win and no losses.
MAYBE IT WILL.

COME ON, LET'S WIN
A CONFERENCE TITLE
The varsity ball team won a pair
over the week-end past, which is in
itself something of the unusual, but
even better is the fact that both
games were pretty fair exhibitions of
the grand old game on the part of
the Cards. The wins over Santa
Clara and Joe Goddini's All-Stars
were not bad at all.
Today they meet St. Mary's at
Moraga, with a fine chance of win
ning. If they do it will be the first
time in a long time that the ball
team has won three straight. Good
hitting, Harry.
A few of the leading baiters are
Ihe following: Calvelli, .500; DeWitt,
.417; Heagerty, .375; Matthews,
Paine, and Rasmussen, .336; Linde,
.292; and Farrell, .286. So far the

team batting average is .226, and it
has scored 34 runs on 43 hits, which
isn't so bad. Furman is leading
pitcher with two wins and no losses.
Griffin has one win and no losses.
MAYBE IT WILL.
MAYBE IT WON T
The Board of Athletic Control
takes a squint at the wrestling sit
uation, among other things, when it
holds its weekly meeting tonight.
Now, recently there has been a
litie agitation on the part of grunt
and groan sympathizers to have
wrestling raised ot the status of a
minor sport, on a par with boxing,
loncing, or even gymnastics.
Fred Williams. Ex Committee
man detailed to have a chat with
(iraHuate Manager Al Masters on
the lav of the land, talked to the
head man yesterday and found
that the move is opposed on the
grounds that it will take a certain
amount of dough.
The wrestlers want $G0 as their
annual budget, so that they might
schedule a few meets and perhaps
lake a trip or two. As it is now,
wrestling is practically nothing but a
friendly get-together where some of
the boys come out and try to strangle
each other just for the fun of it. They
have no official coach, but Jerry
Torrance, a student, sort of gives a
few pointers now and then to help
the boys out.
Torrance came here from San
Diego High as an All-Southern
California high school champion in
his weight class, expecting to find
something in the way of wrestling
that he might engage in while he
wasn't studying. Instead, he
found at Stanford a wrestling team
that wasn't even a team, and he has
done his best to develop the squad
to the point where it would de
serve recognition as a minor sport.
The wrestlers feel that they have
reached the point now where they
are worthy of a little notice, and so
they have been asking to be includ
ed in the annual sports budgets.
From the athletes' standpoint the
claim is a just one. There is no rea
son why gymnastics, for instance,
should be recognized while wrest
ling is not.
However, the standpoint taken
by Al Masters has its points, too.
I)r. Storey voiced a good point
when he said that the wrestlers
will want just $60 this year, but
next year they will need a new
mat, and the next year they will
want to expand on the trip angle,
and the whole thing will grow to
the proportions of every other
minor sport that feels it isn't get
ting a square deal.
Of course, if such a thing came
to pass, wrestling would still be
only on a par with the other sports
—it wouldn't be overstepping its
potentialities as a sport. But the
B.A.C. gripe is that adding another
sport to the list of minor athletic
activities might he too much for
(he budget-balancers.
It naturally would be a swell
thing for the muscle-stretchers if
they could earn circle letters for
their pains, but the question is still
whether the addition of it to the
ranks would be too much of a strain.
If you listen to Al Masters' and Dr.
Storey's side of it, the point they
make is readily seen.
However, the Board meets tonight
to talk oyer the situation, and the
thing will be settled once and for all.
If the athletic directors can see their
way clear to give the wrestlers a
chance, they certainly will move to
do so. Regardless of which way it
comes out; it's a pretty certain thing
that the wrestlers will get a square
deal. Masters will give them as good
a break as he possibly can—he has
no prejudice one way or the other
toward wrestling as a sport—and if
there is a chance to fix things up the
way they would like he will do it.

minor sport that feels it isn't get
ting a square deal.
Of course, if such a thing came
to pass, wrestling would still be
only on a par with the other sports
—it wouldn't be overstepping its
potentialities as a sport. But the
B.A.C. gripe is that adding another
sport to the list of minor athletic
activities might he too much for
(he budget-balancers.
It naturally would be a swell
thing for the muscle-stretchers if
they could earn circle letters for
their pains, but the question is still
whether the addition of it to the
ranks would be too much of a strain.
If you listen to Al Masters' and Dr.
Storey's side of it, the point they
make is readily seen.
However, the Board meets tonight
to talk oyer the situation, and the
thing will be settled once and for all.
If the athletic directors can see their
way clear to give the wrestlers a
chance, they certainly will move to
do so. Regardless of which way it
comes out; it's a pretty certain thing
that the wrestlers will get a square
deal. Masters will give them as good
a break as he possibly can—he has
no prejudice one way or the other
toward wrestling as a sport—and if
there is a chance to fix things up the
way they would like he will do it.
COME ON, LET'S WIN
A CONFERENCE TITLE
The varsity ball team won a pair
over the week-end past, which is in
itself something of the unusual, but
even better is the fact that both
games were pretty fair exhibitions of
the grand old game on the part of
the Cards. The wins over Santa
Clara and Joe Goddini's All-Stars
were not bad at all.
Today they meet St. Mary's at
Moraga, with a fine chance of win
ning. If they do it will be the first
time in a long time that the ball
team has won three straight. Good
hitting, Harry.
A few of the leading baiters are
Ihe following: Calvelli, .500; DeWitt,
.417; Heagerty, .375; Matthews,
Paine, and Rasmussen, .336; Linde,
.292; and Farrell, .286. So far the

team batting average is .226, and it
has scored 34 runs on 43 hits, which
isn't so bad. Furman is leading
pitcher with two wins and no losses.
Griffin has one win and no losses.
MAYBE IT WILL.
MAYBE IT WON T
The Board of Athletic Control
takes a squint at the wrestling sit
uation, among other things, when it
holds its weekly meeting tonight.
Now, recently there has been a
litie agitation on the part of grunt
and groan sympathizers to have
wrestling raised ot the status of a
minor sport, on a par with boxing,
loncing, or even gymnastics.
Fred Williams. Ex Committee
man detailed to have a chat with
(iraHuate Manager Al Masters on
the lav of the land, talked to the
head man yesterday and found
that the move is opposed on the
grounds that it will take a certain
amount of dough.
The wrestlers want $G0 as their
annual budget, so that they might
schedule a few meets and perhaps
lake a trip or two. As it is now,
wrestling is practically nothing but a
friendly get-together where some of
the boys come out and try to strangle
each other just for the fun of it. They
have no official coach, but Jerry
Torrance, a student, sort of gives a
few pointers now and then to help
the boys out.
Torrance came here from San
Diego High as an All-Southern
California high school champion in
his weight class, expecting to find
something in the way of wrestling
that he might engage in while he
wasn't studying. Instead, he
found at Stanford a wrestling team
that wasn't even a team, and he has
done his best to develop the squad
to the point where it would de
serve recognition as a minor sport.
The wrestlers feel that they have
reached the point now where they
are worthy of a little notice, and so
they have been asking to be includ
ed in the annual sports budgets.
From the athletes' standpoint the
claim is a just one. There is no rea
son why gymnastics, for instance,
should be recognized while wrest
ling is not.
However, the standpoint taken
by Al Masters has its points, too.
I)r. Storey voiced a good point
when he said that the wrestlers
will want just $60 this year, but
next year they will need a new
mat, and the next year they will
want to expand on the trip angle,
and the whole thing will grow to
the proportions of every other
minor sport that feels it isn't get
ting a square deal.
Of course, if such a thing came
to pass, wrestling would still be
only on a par with the other sports
—it wouldn't be overstepping its
potentialities as a sport. But the
B.A.C. gripe is that adding another
