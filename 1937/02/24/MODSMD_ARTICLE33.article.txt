# Hank,' 'Stork' In Hospital But Will Play
## U.S.C. Series To Decide Conference; Trojans Aim for Two Wins 
### 
Justin "Sam" Barry's famed U.S.C.
Trojan basketball five is coming to
town here for a two-night stand
against Stanford's league - leading
Cardinals next Friday and Saturday
evenings.
And on the outcome of the two
game series rests, in all probability,
the outcome of the Southern Division
of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Indians Lead by Game
For, though Stanford now holds a
full-game lead with'eight-wins, and
one loss, a double U.S.C. triumph
will put the Trojans a game ahead
with but one—U.C.L.A. —contest to
play.
Mentor Barry, who during his so
journ at the southern institution has
established quite a reputation as a
concocter of casalla peculiarities,
will bring north a full squad of
fourteen of his charges.
The Southerners upset the Cards
in their first meeting last month, 42-
39, and although the Injuns evened
the series on the next evening, the
evidence would still seem to point to
the conclusion that Samuel has a
team what is.
Big gun on the Trojan five is
Captain Eddie Oram, who is rated
as the best defensive guard on the
coast. Little Eddie, an all-Coast se
lection last season, has been cavort
ing regularly for Barry for three
years.
All-Star Support
As a supporting cast, Oram will
have the three high-scoring forwards
Wayne Garrison, Jerry Gracin, and
Clem Ruh, with Carl Anderson at
center and either Hal Dornsife or
Bill Remsen at the other guard.
The 'Stanfords will very likely
start their regular first string, al
though both* Art Stoefen, center,
and Hank Luisetti are in the hospi
tal, the one with an upset stomach,
and the other with a badly bruised
knee. Both will be ready for Friday's
play, however, though Hank will
have to wear a rubber brace.
Bob Zonne will probably not see
action at all, as his dislocated shoul
der, injured in the Santa Clara game,
though not serious, causes him quite
a bit of pain. None the less, if need
ed badly, he'll be able to»play.
