to replace Roy Anderson, El Toro.
Stan Zimet, El Campo, was named
new secretary to succeed Bob Hall,
Beta.
The new officers took their posts
immediately upon election yesterday
at the Council's regular Tuesday
meeting. Anderson and Hall will re
main on the body as members until
they finish out their year's term in
June.
Quade, in outlining the Council's
policies for rest of the year, said that
a renewed drive to uphold the Honor
Code would be pushed.
"We are beginning by asking all
fraternities to remove English
themes and other original papers
from their house files. This does not
include notes and old exes—just
what can be copied and used as
original work," the new chairman
declared.
Men who get parking tags but
cannot attend the Council's Tuesday
meetings may give their tickets to a
member—Quade, Zimet, Anderson,
Hall, John Dern, or Ben Dey, he
said.
