# Mural Tankmen Postpone Meet
## Match Shifted to Spring Because of Weather 
### 
Intramural swimming has been I
postponed until spring quarter, it j
was announced yesterday by Myron !
Sprague, who is in charge of the
aflair. This leaves Relays, Horse
shoes, Tennis, Swimming, Softball, ,
and Baseball as intramural sports'
to be played off next quarter.
Bad Weather Blameless
"Countless men have come to me '
protesting that the bad weather!
early this quarter has prevented
proper preparatory practice for this
swimming meet," said Sprague yes
terday. "We could have held it this
week, but it would have fallen far
below the well-patronized and bet
ter - supported meet that we can
expect after the campus becomes
'swim conscious' next quarter."
Wait for Interest
"I have talked with Nort Thorn
ton, Harry Wolter, and Phil Klau- !
ber, and we agreed that the best '
thing for the meet itself is to hold
it when the organizations are more
interested in swimming."
Spring quarter will necessarily be
full of intramural activity. Horse
shoes, Baseball, and Softball, long
term sports, and Relays, a three-day
affair, will be run by the manager,
while Swimming will be handled
by Sprague, and Tennis by Coach
Bugge.

sity of Washington spent three and a
