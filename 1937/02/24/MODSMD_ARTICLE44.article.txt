STANFORD'S foreign students, long flounder
ing in a new environment, unsung as stu
dent leaders and bogged down with life's
problems in a strange society, are going to have
their innings.
Batting by proxy is Betty McClintock, A.S.S.U.
International Committee chairman who met last
night with faculty leaders at the Delta Gamma
house to lay plans to make the man of the out
group a man of the in-group.
Hers is a big problem, for Stanford is not the
friendliest place in the world for thsoe who are
not adept at living by Stanford's standards. The
student body is far too skilled in the art of
American living to maintain a truly liberal gen
tility to the foreign student, stumbling over the
barriers between him and a strong place in our
life.
So it's Betty's job to teach him the art of the
cultural high jump, how to fit as an individual
into a mass mold.
She probably knows that it's a thankless job.
Perhaps many people are wondering why she
doesn't go out for glossier committees, where
the spotlight shines and the gravy flows.
But maybe Betty knows a real need when she
sees one. Maybe she knows the sinking nos
talgia of the strange student in the strange
place.
Maybe she knows a worthwhile job when
she sees it.
