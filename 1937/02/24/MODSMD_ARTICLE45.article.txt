# 9000 Acres to Park In
## 
### 
MEN'S Council last week fined a Certain Stu
dent for "parking" on the golf course.
Campus police officers have for years, spent
their evenings inhibiting "parked" couples
stalled near the cactus gardens, the Ryan Lab,
and along Sand Hill Road (or don't we know
the best spots?). But until recently no one has
publicly revolted against the Library parking
areas.
The Libe at best is not for most Stanford stu
dents a very inviting place on sunny afternoons
•—especially when a car-minded campus must
drive from a Union coke to a Reserved Book
Room copy of Hulme's "Middle Ages" and find
no place to park.
It's not that there's no room to park around
the Library. On the three sides there are few
obstructions. But, like most Stanford institu
tions (the Daily included), system is what's lack
ing. If you manage to find a niche in the morn
ing, when you return to get your car a few hours
later you can't get it out. In short, you're
bottled and you walk home to lunch.
When construction begins on the Education
Building the Administration will be forced to
lay out new parking areas. But until then, the
only practical way fo utilize the full space with
a minimum of confusion is for Men's Council or
somebody to take a morning off, mark with
white paint space for each car and adequate
driveways to get in and out.
Whether or not flabby - muscled "roughs"
should automobile to the Libe at all is another
question again.
MEANWHILE, the spring air is heavy with
claims that just because Stanford is known
as the Farm is no reason why it should be criss
crossed with "cow trails." Campus road-builder
Almon Roth answers this the best he can—"we
need more money."
Through this winter and many which pre
ceded it, Stanford's roads have been rough,
ragged, full of chuck-holes—the fault of an op
erating budget which, like the roads, is rough,
ragged, full of chuck-holes. As a temporary
remedy Mr. Mac Donald and his Corp Yard crew
arc patching the "cow trails" with an oil-and

gravel mixture, hoping the rain will hold off
until the sores sufficiently heal.
Mr. Roth realizes that entirely new streets are
the only practical solution. He built some last
summer, will build some more next. The Uni
versity's iron-bound budget is the limiting fac
tor. —D. B.

no place to park.
It's not that there's no room to park around
the Library. On the three sides there are few
obstructions. But, like most Stanford institu
tions (the Daily included), system is what's lack
ing. If you manage to find a niche in the morn
ing, when you return to get your car a few hours
later you can't get it out. In short, you're
bottled and you walk home to lunch.
When construction begins on the Education
Building the Administration will be forced to
lay out new parking areas. But until then, the
only practical way fo utilize the full space with
a minimum of confusion is for Men's Council or
somebody to take a morning off, mark with
white paint space for each car and adequate
driveways to get in and out.
Whether or not flabby - muscled "roughs"
should automobile to the Libe at all is another
question again.
MEANWHILE, the spring air is heavy with
claims that just because Stanford is known
as the Farm is no reason why it should be criss
crossed with "cow trails." Campus road-builder
Almon Roth answers this the best he can—"we
need more money."
Through this winter and many which pre
ceded it, Stanford's roads have been rough,
ragged, full of chuck-holes—the fault of an op
erating budget which, like the roads, is rough,
ragged, full of chuck-holes. As a temporary
remedy Mr. Mac Donald and his Corp Yard crew
arc patching the "cow trails" with an oil-and

gravel mixture, hoping the rain will hold off
until the sores sufficiently heal.
Mr. Roth realizes that entirely new streets are
the only practical solution. He built some last
summer, will build some more next. The Uni
versity's iron-bound budget is the limiting fac
tor. —D. B.
MEN'S Council last week fined a Certain Stu
dent for "parking" on the golf course.
Campus police officers have for years, spent
their evenings inhibiting "parked" couples
stalled near the cactus gardens, the Ryan Lab,
and along Sand Hill Road (or don't we know
the best spots?). But until recently no one has
publicly revolted against the Library parking
areas.
The Libe at best is not for most Stanford stu
dents a very inviting place on sunny afternoons
•—especially when a car-minded campus must
drive from a Union coke to a Reserved Book
Room copy of Hulme's "Middle Ages" and find
no place to park.
