# Watson, My Bayonet!
## 
### 
(From the Daily Californian)
It doesn't matter much, to the people of the
United States that Elihu Root is dead. Had he
lived longer, he would only have been able
to continue a losing battle in the cause of world
peace. He would only have continued in his
apparently futile attempts to bring the United
States into an international body for the ad
judication of international disputes.
We apparently have no need of a world court,
nor do we need even treaties. Elihu Root lived
a mistaken life.
There's profit in war, and the population is
too large anyway. Watson, my bayonet!
