'INHERE weren't any candles, there wasn't any cake,
but the proprieties were otherwise observed Mon
day night, when the Roble Dining Halls sang as a body:
"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday deeer Georgce,
happy birthday to you." Mr. Washington seemed vis
ibly touched.
An A.K.L. pledge drove through Menlo Sunday
night. Lots of other pledges did, too, I suppose. How
ever, this one drove through and stopped. Lots of
other pledges did too, I suppose. However, this one
stopped because he had to. The man whose car was
in front of his waddled out and approached the car
belligerently. Rasped he: "What did you do with my
wife.'
"Nothing," said the frosh.
"Why didn't you," said the man, "I mean, what did
you do with my wife."
"I don't even know your wife," said the frosh.
"Yes, yes, I know, but what did you do with her."
"I didn't do anything with her, I haven't even seen
her."
"Haven't even seen her? What do you useâ€”the
Braille system?"
"Lissen here," said the frosh, "I'm a stranger here.
I was just passing through "
"Traveling man?"
"I don't know your wife, I haven't seen her, I haven't
touched her, I don't know anything about her, put your
hands back on the wheel, silly boy, get out of hexe you
swine, before I knock your block off."
"Hmmm," said the Menlo Park man, "maybe I got
the wrong car."
A lady called up the university employment bureau
a while ago and asked if they could find a girl to be a
companion and live in her apartment with her. The
bureau didn't seem to uncover anything immediately,
so several days later the director asked a rough, tough
Sigma Chi employed in the office to call up the lady and
check to see if she still wanted a companion.
A few minutes later, the lonesome lady in the apart
ment heard the phone ring. She picked it up. A deep
masculine voice came booming over the wire: "Do you
still want sombody to live with you?"
The lonesome lady hung up. What else could she do?
