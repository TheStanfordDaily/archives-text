TIN GOD WITH A HORN
HPHERE is some frumpy blonde in a catfur ovei'coat
sitting in the corner just underneath Louis Prima's
trumpet. Prima is leaning over backward with his eyes
shut and a funny little bubble appearing in each cheek
just behind his mouth as he is straining to kill the
upper register.
The blonde is wincing as though she had downed a
bushel of green olives and it is written all over her face
that she thinks the music is ferocious, atrocious.
It is.

Five minutes ago the Prima had started playing Tin
Roof Blues, a number that is sort of hallowed because
it was written by a clarinetist named Rappolo who is
supposed to have gone crazy from playing jazz with the
fabulous New Orleans Rhythm Kings. Prima calls his
outfit a New Orleans Hot Five, and at times he really
sounds like the title.

The first of Tin Roof Blues was a beautiful per
formance. with Prima using a nice, restrained tone that
sometimes was sufficiently raucous to have effect. The
guittarist and string bassist were loafing along easily.
The clarinetist was no Pee Wee Russell, whose neck,
they say, used to expand to fit an enormously over
sized collar when he played with Prima, but the man
this night had a sort of silly frozen grin at the corners of
his mouth like Russell used to, and his peeps on the
clarinet were in a clear, full rounded tone.
For a noisy, knife-in-the-back joint like the Famous
Door, where the grouse coats scream louder than do the
women with their Hollywood Blvd., raspy voices, the
performance was a little too pure.

So Prima gave them what they wanted, and what il
is is a history of how the great swing revival has gone
to the ickies.
Prima took down his trumpet for a minute, eyed the
table in front that seemed to be crowded with jockeys
grown fat and soft, and then he started off.
His stomach waving around, the Josephine Baker
bumps worked up to his shoulders and then his trumpet
started to wave.
He flashed it around at the ceiling and the floor, the
crowd yelled "Yea Louie!" and the great act was going
at full tilt.
The old Tin Roof Blues dropped behind in a shower
of high C's thai slid off into pure shrieks. Higher and
higher he climbed, then he got stuck for ideas and
came tearing down in a terrific cascade to throw in
Darktown Strutter's Ball, Sing Sing Sin, Chinatown
and Limehouse Blues in a swingless confusion as the
clarinetist tried to hang along and then wilted com
pletely while Prima blew the roof to the skies.
The music got lost in the racket. Every bit of sin
cerity went flying before a barrage of cheap exhibi
tionist tricks.
No doubt it was tough stuff to do, and after his
circus performance Prima staggered off for good, but
if that is what jazz has come to, then before the King
and Queen of England—•—
Throw Prima a fish, somebody!
