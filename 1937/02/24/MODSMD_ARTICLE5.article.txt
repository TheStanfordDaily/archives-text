Senior women will hear how the
college graduate can get a job when
they are guests of the vocational
guidance committee tonight in La
gunita at an informal discussion with
11 Stanford alumnae from various
vocational fields. Special guests at
the meeting, at which after-dinner
coffee will be served, will be Dean
Mary Yost, Mrs. Alice Bodle, assist
ant dean, and Frances Terrell.
The alumnae are Victoria Shuck
and Dorothea Wyatt, university in
structors; Frances Chaup and Phoebe
Platte, merchandisers; Margaret Car
ruthers, nurse and social service
worker; Eleanor Carlton, independ
ent study secretary; Marian Tsaffen
berger, journalist; Doris Drury, so

Mary Beth Wortman, secretary; Jean
Anderson, and Peg Schaeffer.
Women are sometimes hired to
weep, or even faint, at funerals in
some South American cities, as a
"compliment" to the importance of
the deceased.
