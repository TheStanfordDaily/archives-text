## THE 						HOWARD HAMLET 
### 
Leslie Howard's "Hamlet,"
it gradually dawns on one that
somebody is crazy—and that it isn't
Mr. Howard.
Perhaps New York critics were
determined to be nasty. Perhaps Mr.
Howard was not himself in Gotham.
Be that as it may, the fact remains
that at the Curran, aided by a splen
did cast and excellent settings, he
offers a convincing and moving por
trait, so cleverly done that one comes
away still pondering the sanity of the
hero of the greatest of Shakespear
ean tragedies.
Doubt as to the authoi-'s meaning
has too often led actors to adopt ar
bitrary interpretations of Hamlet's
character without realizing that the
way tp play him is simply to play
him. That he has perceived this, and
acted accordingly is only one of the
many things for which Mr. Howard
deserves praise..
There is no striving after hidden
meanings in his Hamlet, no worrying
about sophistries of interpretation.
The aim has been to make him a
human being, and that aim has been
completely achieved.
Where Hamlet is to be overacted,
Mr. Howard overacts him; where he
is to be a rational, bitter humorist,
Mr. Howard makes him such, with
the consequence that while his por
trait is neither unified nor com
pletely consistent throughout, it

nevertheless shows in every word
and gesture a close adherence to the
playwright's intention. It is excel
lent Shakespeare and very good
Howard, and as such makes for a
very pleasant evening in the theater.
Aubrey Mather's Polonius, pomp
ous, fussy, absent-minded, still re
tains enough basic intelligence to
make his advice to Laertes seem per
fectly natural.
Pamela Stanley's Ophelia gets
progressively better, rising through
the fiightiness of the early scenes to
the tense horror of the mad-scene,
and leaving an unforgettable impres
sion.
Wilfrid Walter makes an impres
sive Claudius but his Queen is a dis
appointment. Mary Servoss is an
accomplished actress, as those who
saw her in "Tobacco Road" can at
test, but she is not Queen Gertrude.
She should keep to parts more suited
to her curiously harsh voice.
Special praise must go to Stewart
Chaney for the settings, which are
so real that one can almost feel the
texture of the stone. Costumes are
brilliant, with Hamlet changing his

trait is neither unified nor com
pletely consistent throughout, it

nevertheless shows in every word
and gesture a close adherence to the
playwright's intention. It is excel
lent Shakespeare and very good
Howard, and as such makes for a
very pleasant evening in the theater.
Aubrey Mather's Polonius, pomp
ous, fussy, absent-minded, still re
tains enough basic intelligence to
make his advice to Laertes seem per
fectly natural.
Pamela Stanley's Ophelia gets
progressively better, rising through
the fiightiness of the early scenes to
the tense horror of the mad-scene,
and leaving an unforgettable impres
sion.
Wilfrid Walter makes an impres
sive Claudius but his Queen is a dis
appointment. Mary Servoss is an
accomplished actress, as those who
saw her in "Tobacco Road" can at
test, but she is not Queen Gertrude.
She should keep to parts more suited
to her curiously harsh voice.
Special praise must go to Stewart
Chaney for the settings, which are
so real that one can almost feel the
texture of the stone. Costumes are
brilliant, with Hamlet changing his
Leslie Howard's "Hamlet,"
it gradually dawns on one that
somebody is crazy—and that it isn't
Mr. Howard.
Perhaps New York critics were
determined to be nasty. Perhaps Mr.
Howard was not himself in Gotham.
Be that as it may, the fact remains
that at the Curran, aided by a splen
did cast and excellent settings, he
offers a convincing and moving por
trait, so cleverly done that one comes
away still pondering the sanity of the
hero of the greatest of Shakespear
ean tragedies.
Doubt as to the authoi-'s meaning
has too often led actors to adopt ar
bitrary interpretations of Hamlet's
character without realizing that the
way tp play him is simply to play
him. That he has perceived this, and
acted accordingly is only one of the
many things for which Mr. Howard
deserves praise..
There is no striving after hidden
meanings in his Hamlet, no worrying
about sophistries of interpretation.
The aim has been to make him a
human being, and that aim has been
completely achieved.
Where Hamlet is to be overacted,
Mr. Howard overacts him; where he
is to be a rational, bitter humorist,
Mr. Howard makes him such, with
the consequence that while his por
trait is neither unified nor com
pletely consistent throughout, it

nevertheless shows in every word
and gesture a close adherence to the
playwright's intention. It is excel
lent Shakespeare and very good
Howard, and as such makes for a
very pleasant evening in the theater.
