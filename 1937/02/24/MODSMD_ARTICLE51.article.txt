# CAMPUS OPINION
## STANFORD'S IGNORAMI 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As an American youth, uneducat
ed and inexperienced in the ways of
the world, I was greatly surprised at
the conduct of a group of college
professors and students during the
meeting sponsored by the American
Youth Union to aid the Spanish Roy
alist government.
Even among the crowds of ignor
ants who have been aroused by a
radical soap-box orator in Detroit's
square, never have I seen such an
unthinking, emotionally girded dem
onstration as took place at this meet
ing. When a young man arose to re
pudiate a statement of his brother's
affiliations made by a letter from a
friend of this brother, the audience
responded with voice-drowning
hisses, because the student's argu
ment was contrary to their sympa
thies. The ensuing discussion ended
in a childish checkmate of "He is"
and "He is not."
I can only say that I am disap
pointed in realizing that these peo
ple have spent so much time and
money on their intellectual advance
ment only to miss completely that
one essential which we are told is
the purpose of education, the ability
to think objectively.
My apologies for my assumption of
superiority.
