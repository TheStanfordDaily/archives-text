YOU MAY NOT KNOW but I have
received one letter from a reader.
She writes:
"HOLLY HANSEN, diminutive
winter quarter frosh from Northern
Michigan, is a whiz on ice skates.
Goes up to the artificial rink in the
City whenever she gets a chance.
Has her own size 4 figure skates
holding the place of honor in her
room at Roble. Also skis like no
body's business, although she hasn't
been up in the snow country since
arriving at Stanford. When 5 years
old, she was given a two-and-a-half
foot pair of skis by her Norwegian
grandfather, and spent her winters
from then on tagging along through
the drifts with her big brother, who
taught her the tricks of the sport.
"I'm really not good at all," she'll
tell you. "I mean, everyone skis and
skates at home, and they're all much
better than I am, really."
Ambition—to play her clarinet in
the Stanford Band."
Sincerely,
Grapevine
I wonder if Miss Grapevine wasn't
mistaken in the instrument; it should
have been a slide trombone for co
incidence sake.

THE OTHER DAY I mentioned
ALANSON DAVIS as a captain in
the R.O.T.C. Little did I realize that
his family tree was strictly military
and that he is merely a chip of! the
old trunk. His great grandfather
Barnum was a general in the Civil
War, and his grandfather graduated
from West Point, fought in the Span
ish American War, and was a gen
eral in the World War. Lanny's
father is now a colonel at Fort Ma
son, and his brother graduates from
West Point this year.
Lanny may only be a captain in
R.0.T.C., but all his friends call him
"little colonel."
traditional black to red and then to
white before the last curtain falls.
Take it all and all, to misquote the
play a trifle, we shall not soon again
look on the like of Mr. Howard's
"Hamlet."
Rich, stately, and moving, it is one"
of the best productions ever to hit
the City.
Nuts, if we may say so, to New
York.
