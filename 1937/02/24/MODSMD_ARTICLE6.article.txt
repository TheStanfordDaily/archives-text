# Moot Court Hears Labor Case Tonight
## Law Students To Argue Wagner Act Question Before S. F. Jurists 
### 
The moot court of the Stanford
Law School will act in the capacity
of the United States Supreme Court
tonight, when it hears a case in
volving an interpretation of the
Wagner Labor Relations Act. The
hearing will take place at 7:30 in the
Little Theater, and it is open to the
public.
Originally scheduled for last week,
the court's session will probably im
mediately preceed a decision by the
Supreme Court on the same case,
expected next Monday.
Winners Get $50
Four law students will argue the
case, with $50 going to the winning
pair and $15 to the losers. Burton
Goldstein and Daniel Hammack will
represent the offending company,
while council for the Labor Relations
Board are Robert Blewett and Jo
seph C. Gill.
The case is that of an employe of
Passe News, Inc., a motion picture
agency, who was allegedly fired for
joining a labor union. The Labor
Relations Board's decision was ap
pealed, and the case has now reached
Stanford's fictitious supreme court.
S.F. Jurists
Judges who will hear the argu
ments are Judge C. G. Godell, ap
pellate division of the San Francisco
County Superior Court; Judge Mau
rice T. Dooling, of the same court;
and Judge J. T. Nourse, district
court of appeals.
Tonight's decision will be more on
the presentation of the arguments
rather than these judgts' interpreta
tion of the Wagner Act.
