# 'Idolatry' Nets $100 Surplus
## Attendance Equals Spring Show Record 
### 
With 1,023 tickets sold for the two
performances of "This Side Idolatry,"
exactly the same number as were
sold for last year's spx-ing musical,
the only other show which has giv
en two performances on the campus
in seven years, profits for the play
amounted to approximately $100, ac
cording to Dramatic Manager Dick
Daugherty.
Of the two performances, the at
tedance Friday night was better than
that of Saturday, with around 600
seats being sold as compared with
about 400 for the second night. Fri
day night's performance alone made
a greater profit than fall quarter's
"Roadside."
The production marks the first
time in several years that a winter
quarter play has made any profit,
while last winter's show resulted in
a definite loss.
