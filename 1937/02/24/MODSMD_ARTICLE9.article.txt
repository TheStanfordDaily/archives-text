## 
### DAVE LEFF 
I One of the most important phases
! of publicity for the Golden Gate
j 1939 Exposition may be motion-pic
| ture-illustrated lectures, the concep
! tion of a Stanford sophomore.
Marco Thome, member of the
, Speakers' Bureau who thought of in
i corporating cinematic features with
| speeches, together with Chuck Scha
! fcr, will film the Exposition build
| ings as they rise on Exposition Is
! land, beneath the new bridge span
j ning the bay.
Talks Accompany Films
Resulting shots will accompany
| talks to be given during the next
two years by Speakers' Bureau
I members, according to Schafer,
i manager of the bureau.
Ted Reindollar, Stanford '33, head
] ing the lectyre division of the Gold-
I en Gate Exposition, has authorized
| free access to the islands during con
j struction to the two cinema photog
raphers.
| These will have the technical as-
I sistance of a man who was Pathe's

chicf photographer for 18 years, and
will be supplied with film by (he fair,
if the movie plan matures, as seems
probable. They will rank as official
fair publicity men.
Stanford Contributing
With Leland Cutler, chairman of
Stanford trustees, as president of the
exposition, and ex-Daily Editor

1939 show. Sixty live oaks will go

collected themselves for other bu
reau talks. Those interested should
