# Grads Write Barnstormer Spring Show
## Musical by Mac Gordon, Frank O'Neill Chosen; Director To Be Named 
### 
Barnstormers, producers of Stan
ford's spring shows, agreed late
Tuesday evening to present "Down
the Hatch," a musical comedy writ
ten by Frank O'Neill and Mac Gor
don.
After hearing synopses of four
plays, each read by its author, the
25 members of Barnstormers spent
more than an hour deciding which to
ofTer next spring. Phil Cahn, Hoke
Roberts, Hal Kahn, Bob Presnell,
Bob Bernhard, Corner, and Bud
Cady are the authors who submitted
scripts.
Third Production
Preparing for its third spring pro
duction, Barnstormers hope that
many Stanford students will inter
est themselves in the presentation.
According to Jack Beaty, there are
numerous positions open, not only
for actors, but also for those inter
ested in the technical staff.
The setting of the new play is, for
the most part, on board a ship, a
floating University. The plot revolves
about a murder and attempted dope
smuggling enterprise.
May 21, 22 Set
Although the play will probably
be given May 21 and 22. production
will not begin until the end of April
when the cast and technical staff
will be chosen.
Franklin O'Neill, author of the
libretto and lyrics, is now a scenario
writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
and at the same time is working for
his Ph.D. here. Mac Gordon, also a
graduate, and composer of many
Gaielies and spring show tunes, is
now in Colorado working for a min
ing Company.
Policy Changed
The first Barnstormers' production
was composed of music written here
on the campus and several skits
taken from Dorothy Parker and oth
er well known authors. Changing
Iheir policy last year, the group pre
sented "Three Sheets to the Wind,"
another O'Neill-Gordon production.
Leading parts in last year's play
were taken by Jim Corner, Hal Kahn,
Paul Crary, David Nusbickle, Jim
Copp, Onyet Watson, Amelia Baines,
and Shirley Jones.
No further plans for the show can
be made until the director is chosen
at a later meeting of Barnstormers.
O'Neill, who directed his own show
last year, will be unable to leave his
position with Metro - Goldwyn -
Mayer to take charge this year.
