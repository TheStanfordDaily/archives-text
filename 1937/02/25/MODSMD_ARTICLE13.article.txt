## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
How Stanford students of the '90's got their alcohol without benefit of
gasoline was described by Edward Maslin Hulme, professor of history, to
Luncheon Club sandwich-caters yesterday noon.
"We used to walk down to Mayfield from Encina, find our favorite
tavern, and sit down to friendly bull-sessions over a mug of beer or a spot

of dago red," he reminisced. "That
was half our education."
Mr. Hulme, in his talk on "The
Real Story of Stanford—the History
That Cannot Be Written," relived the
Farm's early days when he was a
special student, hashing and janitor
ing his way through college.
Early Farm Freaks
"Stanford was full of freaks then—
maybe still is," he said smilingly. "I
knew two brothers, sons of a preach
er, who were living for $1 a month
in 'the Camp,' a cluster of tem
porary carpenters' cabins back of the
Chapel.
Both were back-to-nature lovers
with their room plastered with in
congruous mottoes, such as 'Jesus
loves the meek; always keep the
lungs full of air.' The younger went
to classes barefoot and signed his
themes with simply the name 'Bill'
enclosed in a scribbled outline of a
foot."
Bikes and Buggies
Bicycles were the only means of
transportation on the campus, the
professor explained. Trips to San
Francisco, "before the hotels up
there put in expensive dance-floors,"
were reserved for operas and con
certs by famous artists.
"Only one boy had a hoi'se-and
buggy, and that buggy attracted the
girls all right," he chuckled. Enter
tainment was restricted to the cam
pus for a very practical reason—iso
lation.
