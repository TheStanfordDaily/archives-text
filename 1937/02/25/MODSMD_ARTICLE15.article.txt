# Relatives File Air Crash Suit
## $100,000 Damages Asked By Victim's Family 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4 (UP).â€”
The courts were asked in a damage
suit yesterday to determine whether
a passenger aboard a United Airlines
plane survived a crash in San Fran
cisco Bay only to die of drowning
because of delay in rescue attempts.
A suit for $100,000 damages filed
by the family of Myron Lorge, Los
Angeles auto salesman, named the
city and county of San Francisco as
defendant.
Negligence Charged
The plaintiff alleged that Lorge's
death was due to official negligence
in failing to have search-lights and a
rescue boat at the San Francisco
Municipal Airport, at which the
plane was attempting a landing when
it fell into San Francisco Bay one
and one-half miles from shore.
It was contended his life would
have been saved if he had been res
cued immediately.
Drowning Indicated
Instead it was five hours before
the plane wreckage was found and
several days before Lorge's body was
taken from the bay. An autopsy at
tributed his death to drowning, as
were the deaths of four of the other
five persons whose bodies were re
covered. Five bodies still are miss
ing.
