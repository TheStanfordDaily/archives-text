tired physician who rode to fame on
his $200-a-month old age pension
program, was convicted by a Federal
Court jury today on charges of con
tempt of the House of Representa
tives.
He faces a maximum penalty of
Siooo fine and one year in jail, and
a minimum penalty of $100 fine
and one month in jail.
The defense immediately moved
for a new trial. The court deferred
sentence for three days to consider
the motion.
"I rather expected the verdict,"
Dr. Townsend said calmly.
The jury of 11 men and one
woman decided thai Dr. Townsend
placed himself in contempt when
he stalked out of House investi
gating committee hearing and re
fused to return for further ques
tioning.
The technical charge was wilful
failure to comply with a committee
subpoena.
Two former lieutenants of Dr.
Townsend, Dr. Clinton Wunder and
John B. Kiefer, pleaded guilty on
similar charges two weeks ago and
were fined $100 and given one-year
suspended sentences.
Justice Peyton Gordon previously
had instructed the jury to return a
verdict of acquittal on a second count
of the indictment, charging that Dr.
Townsend refused to answer com
mittee questions. He ruled that such
charges could not be sustained be
cause Dr. Townsend answered all
questions before lie left the hearing.
