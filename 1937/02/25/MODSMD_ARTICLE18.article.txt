### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 24 (UP). —
Eleven sit-down strikers in Willie
Plecity's pie factory were a little un
comfortable about Ihe belt lines ot
day after a 24-hour diet of straight
pastry.
It was pies, pies everywhere, and
not a ham sandwich in sight. A
wandering hot tamale peddler bare
ly escaped with his life as the 11,
glutted with flavors of vanilla, apple,
mince, cherry, lemon and other pic
filling, wondered if their genial boss
was not getting more satisfaction out
of their strike than anybody else.
Willie Plecity, the boss, certainly
made it as pleasant as possible for
his sit-down bakers. He even went
so far as to provide them with bi
carbonate of soda.
