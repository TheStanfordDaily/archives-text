# Moot Court Vetoes Labor Relations Act
## Jury Maintains Wagner Law Violates Freedom Of Contracts Principle 
### 
Wagner Labor Relation Act was
held unconstitutional last night by
Stanford's mock Supreme Court.
The court, composed of three San
Francisco judges, merely upheld the
case of the respondent, the Passe
News, Inc., giving no discussion of
the case. Decision was made on four
points: briefs, authorities quoted,
oral presentation, and skill in an
swering questions.
With only one gray head among
them, contrasting with the "nine old
men" of the Federal Supreme Court,
the three justices heckled the stu
dent counselors and drew more
laughter from the 150 who attended.
Passe News had allegedly fired an
employee for joining a labor union,
said the case. Burton Goldstein and
Daniel Hammack, representing the
company, maintained that the Wag
ner Act by attempting to regulate
intrastate commerce was unconstitu
tional. They also maintained that the
lav/ violated due process and free
dom of contract provisions of the
constitution.
Petitioner's Attorneys Robert
Blewett and Joseph C. Gill attempt
ed to prove that the company's busi
ness was interstate and that Congress
sought to remove obstructions from
interstate commerce by controlling
labor relations and preventing
strikes.
San Francisco jurists who heard
the case were Judge C. G. Godell,
appellate division of the San Fran
cisco County Superior Court; Judge
Maurice T. Dooling of the same
court; and Judge J. T. Nourse of the
district court of appeals.
