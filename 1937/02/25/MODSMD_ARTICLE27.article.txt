### 
HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”Sir
Guy Standing, genial, mild-manner
ed Englishman who found fame on
the British stage and the American
screen, dropped dead late today.
The 63-year-old actor had called
for his automobile at a garage. An
attendant paused a moment to ask
him how he felt. Sir Guy smiled.
' Excellent," he said. "In fact, I never
felt better in my life."
He no sooner spoke than his face
turned a chalk white. He clutched
his chest, his knees buckled, and he
collapsed.
