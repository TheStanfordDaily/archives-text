# Wrestlers Win B.A.C. Bout
## Mat Sport Given Official Status; $100 Granted 
### 
Stanford's wrestlers rustled recog- \
. ition of wrestling as a minor sport
ist night when the Board of Athlctic 1
Control granted a special $100 for |
.i grunt-and-groan meet with Cal, j
ind for other expenses of the sport :
ncurred prior to the close of spring
quarter. The idea of recognition is
ust being tried out. The B.A.C. does
.lot want wrestlers to wrassle with
Is pocketbook.
Decided with a will was the pro
oosal to send Dave Rider, star aqua
rian, to the N.C.2-A. meet in Min- j
aesota on March 26.
But definitely undecided was the j
question of "The Aihlete Behind
the Wheel—Whither and Whether." J
There's always a chance, the Board
pointed out, that a Stanford muscle- 1
man could be cracked up driving to j
this meet or that. And there's the
darker prospect of the muscleman j
clacking up someone else who might
look fondly on Stanford's exchequer.
The question is, "Who Gets Sued?"
Liability for injuries and damages is
not clear in the Board's mind —
which means that an irate parent or
an irate motorist might be able to
sue Stanford. Until the University's j
or the Board's liability for damages !
can be definitely determined, ath- '
letes must travel to competitions un
der official auspices and not in their
private jillopies unless such trans
portation is approved.
Professors who like to clear out !
the cobwebs by playing tennis on the
Faculty Club tennis court will con- '
tinue to rut-dodge or be spilled, the !
Board decided. Their request for j
$400 to resurface their private court !
was denied. j
