# Four Hoop Team Stars In Hospital
## Coach Bunn Optimistic In Face of Starting Second String Team 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
If the present state of affairs con
tinues much longer Stanford's Coach
John Bunn soon won't have any bas
ketball team left.
Up to yesterday, there were two
hospital cases on the squad. Hank
Luisctti, with his bruised knee;
and Art Stoefon, with his upset
stomach; in addition to Boh Zon
ne's dislocated shoulder.
And now Jack Calderwood, first -
siring guard, has been sent bed
ward to the hospital with a bad
case of poison oak, which centers
itself around his face and hands.
However, Coach Bunn is count
ing upon the three first-stringers,
Luisetti, Stoefen, and Calderwood, to
start Friday night's imbroglio with
Sam Barry's U.S.C. Trojans, and may
also have Zonne in suit on the
bench, though it is doubtful that he
will play.
Nonetheless, if Dame Fate rules
Hank, Art. and Spooks off the court
for the week-end play against the
Trojans, the Cards will still be in
there pitching with a line-up that
will look something like this: Howie
Turner and Captain Dinty Moore at
forwards, Phil Zonne at center, and
H. B. Lee and Nellie Heath at guards.
Lee played a very nice brand of
ball against Santa Clara last Sat
urday, so Bunn feels justified in
moving Moore to forward and let
ting Heath provide the necessary
height in back-court for H. 8..
who, though 5 feet 10. will look
mighty small against the towering
Trojan forward wall.
Big gun offensively for the men
of Troy is Forward Jerry Gracin,
who gave the Cardinal guards
many an uneasy moment in the
first two games of the series.
At center will be big Carl "But
tercup" Anderson, whose lack of
speed is fairly well adapted to the
cautious "ball-control" style fea
tured this year in the Barry system.
At the remaining forward spot will
be either Wayne Garrison or Clem
Ruh, who busted up that first Stan
ford-U.S.C. encounter in which the
latter came out on the top end of a
42-39 count.
Captain Eddie Oram and either
Hal Dornsife or Bill Remsen will be
at the guard spots.
