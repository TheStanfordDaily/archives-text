# Varsity, Frosh Netmen Win
## Tentative Schedule For Varsity Announced 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon, both
varsity and frosh tennis teams be
gan their respective seasons when
the former downed the Olympic
Club 7 matches to 2, and the latter
took Salinas J.C.
This Saturday, two more sets of
matches will be played, the varsity
tangling with the Golden Gate Park
Club of San Francisco at 2 o'clock,
and the frosh meeting Piedmont
High at 10 o'clock. The Park team
has some highly touted players on it
and will doubtless offer plenty of
competition for the Stanford boys.
The following is the tentative
schedule for the varsity season:
Feb. 27—Golden Gate Park Club at
Stanford.
March 6 —Berkeley Tennis Club at
Berkeley.
March 23—Los Angeles Tennis Club
at Los Angeles.
March 24—Westside Tennis Club at
Los Angeles.
March 26—U.C.L.A. at Los Angeles.
March 27—U.S.C. at Los Angeles.
April 3—U.S.C. at Stanford.
April 10 —U.C.L.A. at Stanford.
April 17 —California at Stanford.
April 24 —California at Berkeley.
According to Coach Sherman
Lockwood, the matches with U.S.C.
will probably be the most crucial of
the season.
