Playoffs will stall tonight in intra
mural basketball, with five first
round games on the docket.
The bracket has been posted in the
Gym, with a list of those eligible to
enter the playoffs, by reason of the
"two league game" rule. Teams will
be forced to play every other night,
in an attempt to complete the tour
nament by the end of next week.
Last night Phi Gamma Delta won
League I by a win over D.K.E. I, 16
to 15. In the only other game played
Business School I took Phi Kappa
Sigma 32 to 17.
