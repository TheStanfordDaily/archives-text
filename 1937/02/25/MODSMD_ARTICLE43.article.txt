# Track Interest Lags; Little Progress Seen
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
A (rack team (hat on paper has as fine a chance at the Coast champion
ship as has been known in several Stanford years of a sudden has begun
to go back on itself. liow come?
Look at the dope:
California is about the same this year as last, when they started a bunch
of big names and fine practice work under Coach Brutus Hamilton, but

ended up losing to Stanford. <
U.S.C. is still a steam roller, but
an ailing one—Roy Kirkpatrick is in
eligible. Leland Lafond has pulled a
muscle, while Loring Day and Owen
Hansen, top pole vaulter and shot
putter of the southern crowd, have
left school indefinitely.
U.C.L.A. doesn't count this year.
Now way back in December Coach
Dink Templeton of Stanford took his
kids into caucus, told them his con
fidential sentiments. (And these con
fidential team rallies are devoid of
the customary Templeton hog-wild
optimism):
"You have as good a chance to
knock the Conference info the
creek as any squad I've had in the
past six years. I say this because
there are lots of you. and in spite
of your youth and inexperience
you've turned in better marks than
any Stanford bunch of your expe
rience."
It was the cold dope. Look at Za
gar, 154 as a freshman in the discus.
Look at Hiserman and Hewitt, first
men at S.M.J.C. last year. Look at
Montgomery, 48-5 in the shot and
only learning, Luisetti over 6-3 last
year and hasn't yet learned the rudi
ments of taking off. And the veter
ans, McCurdy at 1:54, Alexander at
4:29, Weiershauser at 47.8, Chuck
Voigt, and Jim Reynolds!
Can you blame the Boy Coach
for his optimism, especially affer
the news from the other schools?
No.
Then, in January, the tracksters
got a long rest because of the rains,

and because of a new Templeton
policy in giving bis charges a long
Christmas vacation.
Comes the sunshine at last, but
only a few of the "potentially great
est" boys have extended themselves,
it appears. Trackmen, what: is this,
September or the end of February?
The Stanford varsity or Piedmont
High?
