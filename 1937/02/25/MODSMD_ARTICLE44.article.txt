# Ruggers To Clash With Olympic Club
## 
### 
Varsity ruggers will play what will
probably be their hardest game of
the season when they meet the
Olympic Club on the frosh football
field here, Saturday afternoon. The
Winged O squad is undefeated this
year and has only one tie to its rec
ord.
The same afternoon, the second
string will tangle with the Stanford
Medical School fifteen. Earlier in the
season, the Medicos lost to the var
sity, 34-0.
The Indian varsity men have been
taking strenuous workouts at prac
tice drills this week, working on
their lineout and scrum formations.
With a developed scrum and passing
attack the Indian ruggers should
prove a worthy match for the Olym
pic fifteen on Saturday.
