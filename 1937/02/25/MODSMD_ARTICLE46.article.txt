# Card Fighters Meet Hears In Return Match
## Maloney Is Optimistic; Close Match Expected After U.C.L.A. Wins 
### STAN SWAFFORD 
Eleven Stanford boxers will travel
to the Men's Gym at Berkeley to
night at 8 o'clock to meet California's
pugilists in a return tournament.
According to Coach Harry Maloney,
the Indians should show more skill
than was shown two weeks ago when
the same teams met at Stanford.
Several close battles will be run
off tonight; one will be between
Lovelace and Heron in the 139-1 b.
class and the other between the two
captains—Wilber of Stanford and
Wallstrum of Cal, in the welter
weight division.
Hard Battle
Mangan versus Thomas in the
heavyweight should be a hard bat
tle. The tall, handsome tackle from
the Card football squad entered
Stanford rings for the first time this
year, and has proved a tough match
for anyone. Bob Dakan in the light
heavies is also a new man, a dark
horse of grid fame.
Two bouts have been forfeited.
Jack Hata will not fight in the ban
tam match because of flu, and one
of the lightweight bouts will be can
celed because of Frank White's bro
ken nose.
Eleven Bouts Set
Besides the nine fights, there will
be two exhibition matches in which
Jack Rice in the 149-lb. class and
M. N. Sparrow in the ju'nior middle
weights will participate. Both men
are freshmen.
The following is the line-up for
tonight's tourney:
129—lb.—James vs. Derr
139-lb.—Lovelace vs. Heron
149-lb.—Wilber vs. Wallstrum
149-lb.—Cahill vs. Folsom
159—lb.—Hardacre vs. Smith
159-lb.—Gunn vs. Milliron
169—1 b—Pope vs. Mead
179—lb.—Dakan vs. Shell
Heavyweight—Mangan vs. Thomas
