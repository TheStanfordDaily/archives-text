# Card Poloists To Play Oregon
## Two Games Will Decide West Championship 
### 
Four members of the local polo
squad will pull out of San Francisco
this afternoon for Corvallis, Oregon,
where they will meet Oregon State
in a two-game series Friday night
and Saturday afternoon. The match
es will be played indoors for the in
door intercollegiate championship of
the West.
Captain Bob Fullerton, Russel
Rasmussen, Jim Fullerton, and Bob
Wallace, who are making the trip,
will be accompanied by Colonel A. R.
Peyton, head of the FaiTn's military
department. This allows one substi
tute, as in the indoor game only
three men are played. The indoor
game also differs from the outdoor,
in that an inflated ball about the size
of a baseball is used.
While Oregon State is reputed to
have a strong team, Captain H. Y.
Grubbs, Card coach, is confident that
the Farm's outdoor experience will
make for a better hitting and faster
playing squad that should win. The
Cards met Oregon State in 1935 and
took both games.
The northern horsemen will meet
the Cards on the outdoor field here
in a return match early in May.
