## DO THE TROJANS PLAY FASTER BASKETBALL 
### 
They say Ihat Sam Barry is using
some new stuff in the way of attack
for his basketball team nowadays.
The use of a double pivot system has
crept into the Trojan team's play,
something pretty flashy for the good
old set-type offense that has been
the Southern California style for
years.
Also, Elevator Sam has incorporat
ed a couple of guard-through plays,
where the guards slide in from mid
court to under-the-basket in an at
tempt to score. That likewise is
something quite liberal in the Tro
jan scheme of things.
Well, now, that's fine. If he will
open up the Trojans' play, Stanford
will be glad to stick with him. If
there is a team anywhere in the
country that likes to play fast, wide
open basketball it is Stanford.
Barry's best bet will be to try to
hog the ball, to slow down the Cards
enough so that there will be at no
time a very great margin between
the two teams. His outfit did that in
the first of the two games down south
a couple of weeks ago, and got by
with it to win. The second night it
was different, because there was no
slowing down the Cards then.
However, it won't make much dif
ference what type of offense or de
fense Southern Cal uses — they will
have a very tough time winning a
game from the team that needs just
these two to win the Southern Divi
sion title.

of Loyola, the man who beat out
Wallace for the individual cham
pionship 5 and 3, was second with a
77.
Stanford qualified seven men for
the championship flight of IG, which
is pretty fine apples. While speaking
of flights, we might mention that Bill
Oneal won the second flight by de
feating Alan McLenegan of Cal 13
up and 11 to play. That, too, is not
so bad.
Cam Puget, professional at Pebble
Beach, said that this year's field was
the fastest of all time—even better,
as a whole, than when Lawson Little,
Clu.rlie Seaver, and Spec Stewart
went around swinging mashies for
Stanford.
