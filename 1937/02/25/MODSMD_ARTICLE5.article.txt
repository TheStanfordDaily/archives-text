## 
### 
Offering two 16-page innovations
for the 1937 Quad, a Candid Camera
section with photographs by Tro
Harper and Charles Steinheimer,
and a Social. Section, the yearbook
staff is now finishing up work on its
last sections.
The business staff, in pushing its
sales drive, hopes to reach a figure
larger than last year's 1740 copies
sold. Indications of success are the
advance sale of more tHan 800 copies
to date, and the increased interest in
the Quad shown through the num
ber of people who have come to have
their pictures taken.
Selling price, with the buyer's
name engraved, is 56.17; without the
name, 50 cents less. Two mornings
every other week, a salesman will be
at the post office to receive orders.
Down payment per copy is $3.67.
The Quad, more modernistic than
ever, will use new type-faces
throughout. Almost 100 proofs have
•remained unclaimed since the begin
ning of the quarter. The Quad staff
asks every student to call for and
return his by tomorrow.
