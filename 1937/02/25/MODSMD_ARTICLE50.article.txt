# PRACTICAL JOKESTER, NICKNAMER, TOO
## 
### 
Dinty Moore, husky Irish captain
of the wicket-swishers, has a won
derful faculty for concocting foolish
nicknames for practically everybody
on the basketball team. There is a
remarkable collection of them float
ing around now, particularly about
Jack Calderwood. A few of Jack's
special handles are "Spooks,"
"Spookj'," "Snooks," "Snooky,"
"Snodge," "Snark," and "Boris." The
first six are evolutionary in nature,
obviously. The last refers to Karloff,
likewise obviously.
The one that takes the prize,
though, is the one for freckled Jack
Kesspf. It's "Speckhou?e."
