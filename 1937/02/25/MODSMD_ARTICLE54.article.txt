# Storm Down the Hatch
## 
### 
NIGHT before last Barnstormers diddled, ar
gued, stormed, ground axes, log-rolled, fili
bustered —and finally announced that "Down
the Hatch," a Gordon and O'Neill hash-up, will
be the 1937 "student written" spring show.
'Course Frank O'Neill graduated last fall and
now does some writing for M.G.M. but that
doesn't seem to matter much. We'll have a
"student written" show anyway.
Still Mac Gordon is doing his M.A. thesis and
that makes him a student—technically. We
hear he's actually researching the bottom of
a Colorado mine.
True Gordon and O'Neill have torn off some
damn good "student written" shows for Stan
ford, and Stanford is appreciative. Gordon has
given us half a dozen tuneful ditties that would
have probably cracked big time if he'd gone to
Princeton. And O'Neill knows his writing.
But sooner or later Stanford has to dig up a
couple of new Gordons and O'Neills. And as
long as Stanford's going to kid itself into think
ing it is putting on student-writen stuff, it may
as well suffer through the real thing.
Reliable reports of the Barnstormers meeting
bring caustic comment that all four shows of
fered were "lousy," that "Down the Hatch" was
least so of the bunch, but still nothing sensa
tional. That's a typical early report. Usually
some factions are prone to sour grape a bit.
However, if the four productions were all
pretty bad—no stand-outs—how about giving
some new blood a chance. The shows usually
end up about the same anyway, and if there is
an embryo Jerome Kern in our number let's not
smother him.—G. F.
