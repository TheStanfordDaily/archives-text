# Give Them a Good Show

ABACK-HANDED recognition of Stanford's
student government problem is Jim Rey
nolds' suggestion that the student office-holder
arbitrarily be limited to one student body office.
Because one high-steam activity man gets a
corner on the extra - curricular worry - market
doesn't mean that good men are being deprived
of jobs. It much more likely is an indication
that other good men don't want the jobs.
It may be easy to sit in Ex Committee room
and lay down the unbreakable lav/ in black
and white—"one man to a job"—but that might
not be the correct corrective.
Better than to place a legislative brake on
individual ambition, why not find out why
more people don't compete for A.S.S.U. offices?
There are some very definite causes, but
they are not obvious and they cannot be re
moved in the standard, obvious manner.
For instance, there are hundreds of students
at Stanford who neither know nor care how
they are governed.
They feel no identity with their fellows as
citizens of a community, nor with student lead
ers as their delegates in student legislatures.
These people are simply "going to Stanford."
They don't care a hoot. The big job is to
make them care.
One way would be to revive the University
Assembly idea, as suggested. And, like Larry
Rouble, we don't mean a rival of the old stuff—
presenting new ofifcers, hearing run-of-the-mill
speakers, canceling boring classes for boring
entertainment.
Rather, make people interested in their stu
dent state by connecting an hour's first class
amusement, perhaps of a type far removed from
student government, with enjoyment of such
entertainment as a member of Stanford's civic
group.
Once that communal spirit is aroused, what
ever means are employed, the offices and the
office-holders will shuffle themselves to every
one's satisfaction.
