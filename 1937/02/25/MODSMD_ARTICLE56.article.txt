# Cal Shows Us How

### 
THERE'S a place across the Bay called Cali
fornia. The papers say that Stanford hates
California. Maybe sometimes it does. Today is
different.
For today Stanford may well turn off the hate
beam and hand Berkeley a bouquet for "having
somethihg there."
Last Thursday from noon till midnight Cali
fornia held its fourth annual Intiamural Sports
Carnival, whence living group met living group

in every conceivable sport from squash on
through to boxing.
Stanford could well follow the Bear lead in
putting the right emphasis on the right point.
Intramural athletics is the right point.
One way to beak down the hyper-importance
of varsity sport is to build up intramural. The
arguments along these lines are many, and
overworked. They're good arguments, and edi
torials have long iterated and reiterated them.
Our fore-writers decided that intramural is
good. That is that.
But what California has done is to take its
good intramural athletics and blow them up,
with a final blast-one afternoon last week in a
carnival that drew the entire campus interest
and even sifted over here as an example of
what Stanford might do with its good intra
mural.
Here's how Stanford can add a superlative or
two to its good intramural, something that
would inject the required "push" into an activ
ity that is doddering.
Stage an intramural carnival some .Friday
afternoon in the spring, hold finals in all the
mural sports —horseshoes, diving, swimming,
baseball, tennis, etc. — arrange a basketball
game between California and Stanford's mural
champions for early evening, and top the thing
off with a sports dance and presentation of tro
phies. Devote part of one day to winding up
the mural program, during which finalists
would have an audience, would get praise, and
good intramural would get GOOD.—G. F.
