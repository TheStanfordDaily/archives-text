'T'HE campus red hots and blues are always getting ex
ercised over the Public Exercises Committee, which
in turn is always getting exercised over the campus for
red-me-hots.
The excitement seems to spring from an underlying
difference in philosophy. The red hots think their out
side speakers should come inside and work out on As
sembly Hall audiences. The Public Exercises Com
mittee, on the other hand, thinks that all public exer
cises should be on the parallel bars, that outside speak
ers should not be offside.
After all the exercises, however, both sides seem
unconstitutionally able to cool off in the showers.
T ATEST trouble arose over the three-round no-deci
sion bout last week of the Spanish Loyalists on the
campus. The Committee decided that the exercises
would have to be in a closed meeting because the A. S.
and U.'s exhibited no interest in importing the Fascist
supporters from Spain to give the other side to the
inside.
Conviction that the Spanish United Front govern
ment was a bunch of white-hot red hots, and that one
side was not enough for an open meeting, was founded
on personal experience, the head exerciser stated.
Calling attention to his travels in Spain last summer,
he explained that friends in his French hotel warned
him not to go into Spain last summer with a new car,
because there was a radical spirit abroad in Spain.
But the chairman exercised his prerogatives. He has
potash interests in the country, and besides, he said, he
is descended from a long line of American pioneers.
He'd be darned if he'd let any radicals scare him. So he
shoved the gears on his bright, shiny new car into low
and ventured forth into radical Spain, the modern, up
to-date, stream-lined, plush-lined pioneer.
Those of you who have a hard time concentrating on
Our Hasher because of the continual interruptions of
the professor, and those of you who take your public
exercises every morning trying to fold the paper so that
it doesn't get into your fellow-students' laundry marks,
may be interested in a remark made by the lecturer in
Biology 11. Said he: "Will the gentleman in the third
row please fold his paper so that the gentlemen in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth rows can see around him?"
Well, I was interested, anyhow.

cises should be on the parallel bars, that outside speak
ers should not be offside.
After all the exercises, however, both sides seem
unconstitutionally able to cool off in the showers.
T ATEST trouble arose over the three-round no-deci
sion bout last week of the Spanish Loyalists on the
campus. The Committee decided that the exercises
would have to be in a closed meeting because the A. S.
and U.'s exhibited no interest in importing the Fascist
supporters from Spain to give the other side to the
inside.
Conviction that the Spanish United Front govern
ment was a bunch of white-hot red hots, and that one
side was not enough for an open meeting, was founded
on personal experience, the head exerciser stated.
Calling attention to his travels in Spain last summer,
he explained that friends in his French hotel warned
him not to go into Spain last summer with a new car,
because there was a radical spirit abroad in Spain.
But the chairman exercised his prerogatives. He has
potash interests in the country, and besides, he said, he
is descended from a long line of American pioneers.
He'd be darned if he'd let any radicals scare him. So he
shoved the gears on his bright, shiny new car into low
and ventured forth into radical Spain, the modern, up
to-date, stream-lined, plush-lined pioneer.
Those of you who have a hard time concentrating on
Our Hasher because of the continual interruptions of
the professor, and those of you who take your public
exercises every morning trying to fold the paper so that
it doesn't get into your fellow-students' laundry marks,
may be interested in a remark made by the lecturer in
Biology 11. Said he: "Will the gentleman in the third
row please fold his paper so that the gentlemen in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth rows can see around him?"
Well, I was interested, anyhow.
