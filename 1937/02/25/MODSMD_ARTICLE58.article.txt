WHAT'S THE USE?
jITOST of the people in this world think they're pretty
smart.
And Stanford students arc no exception.
Somebody once said that the sweetest sound in any
man's ears is the sound of his own name.
If we get a new car we are proud of that, until the
novelty wears ofT and then we are proud of it because
it is old. Athletes are proud of their fine bodies and
tear themselevs to meaty shreds for a few brief min
utes of self-satisfaction.
Actors jump around the stage showing oil their
deep-seated emotions for the benefit of nothing.
Girls brag about their pledge class and pat them
selves on the back because they live in a new house and
have new clothes they themselves didn't pay for.
Bawlout, averages, good meals, good parties, all bet
ter than what the other fellow has.
The first liar never having a chance.

Yet strangely enough, not many of us are proud of
the fact we are alive, that wc have been given a chance
of living in this world.
We never realize that the shiny new roadster in
front of the house would quickly become a mass of
mangled steel that looked like the works of a dismem
bered alarm clock.
Little do we ever think of the day when our fine
bodies, so sleek and trim in their youth, will become
nothing but shrunken, gnarled and misshapen hunks of
ugliness, later to drift away into sifting dust.
The minds that were so fine and alert slow down
to a forgetful pace and arc only tolerated because out
social vows force us to keep every living thing alive,
good or bad.
If wc think our success has been great and will bo
greater we'd just better remember that all the colossal
successes in life ended up pilloried for their pains. Na
poleon nursed his aching heart on lonely Elba, hated by
his countrymen. Caesar, with a knife in his heart,
poured out his successful life on the floor of the Roman
Senate. Jesus Christ, blasphemed by his own race,
hung crucified.

Our progress fascinates us, but we can't keep up
with it. All the fantastic things we create don't seem to
be helping us, but rather lying in wait to crush us.
We don't let it stop us though because each one of
us has the idea in the back of hi.s mind that he can live
forever, that ho is invulnerable, invincible, that if the
other guy can't do it, by God, he can.
All I can say is just take it easy.
