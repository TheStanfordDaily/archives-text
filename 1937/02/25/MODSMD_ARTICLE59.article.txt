# THE 						REVIEWER

### 
Looking at the outset as if it might
be a glorification of the Boy Scouts
of America, Mind Your Own Busi
ness, with Charles Ruggles, Alice
Brady, and Talbot, proved to
be a hackneyed gangster plot moti
vated by a novel theme.
When the wife of a newspaperman
writes his "Birds and Bees" stories
for him, transposing it into a "Win
chellized" gossip strip, anything can
happen. With real people for sub
jects and birds and bees for charac
ters, Orville Shank's (Ruggles) "Our
Wild Friends" column exposes a
racket-ridden city's more seamy
side.
Without this satirical note, Mind
Your Own Business would have been
the usual run-of-the-mill gangster
film. Best shot Ruggles and his thug
captor on a snipe hunt, with the
plug-ugly crawling through the for
est, sack in mouth, calling: "Here
snipe, snipe, snipe!"
Taken from the pen of dog con
noisseur Albert Payson Terhune,
The Mighty Treve is a story that
will gladden the hearts of all true
dog lovers. Natural as nature, the
film is the clean wholesome type de
signed for a children's matinee, and
yet with its complete simplicity of
plot, Noah Beery Jr. and "Tuffy,"
his sheep dog, instill a sentimental,
wistful charm into the show, which
at times becomes quite good—if you
like dogs—and I do.
