# 'Brief Moment' To Be Staged
## Behrman's Broadway Hit Will Be Read Tonight 
### 
"Brief Moment," depicting fire
works that ensue when high society
and a raucous night club singer
merge, will be presented by a Sword
and Sandals reading cast tonight at 8
o'clock in the Little Theater.
Written by S. N. Behrman, the play
is a comedy of pleasant wit and in
cisive characterization gleaned by
its author from modern life as occa
sionally lived in New York. One line
from the script furnishes the theme,
"A brief moment of petulance
against the whole background of life
â€”all of us lost in it."
Lines rather than emotional force
of situations give "Brief Moment" its
zest. Because of this the choice of the
play is an especially suitable one for
a Sword and Sandals production.
According to Director Jack Temple,
not even the frankest of speeches
which pervade the script will be cut
or changed.
Jane Clary and Jim Corner carry
the central roles with Ken Peters,
Harold Kahn, Jack Beattie, Bill
Goldner, Marshall Dill, and Pauline
Stevens included in the cast. Both
Miss Clary and Corner were last
seen in "This Side Idolatry."
