# "FIRST LADY"

### 
Seats are on sale beginning today
for Jane Cowl's "First Lady," which
comes to the Curran after breaking
all records at the Music Box in New
York. The play begins here next
Monday.
By George S. Kaufman and Kath
erine Dayton of "Mrs. Democratic
and Mrs. Republican" fame, it has to
do with Lucy Chase Wayne, wife of
the Secretary of State, and her dear
est enemy, Irene Hibbard, wife of a
Supreme Court justice. The feud,
which begins over a stolen chef, de
velops into a behind-the-scenes and
over-the-teacups fight for the Pres
idency, which spares neither person
alities nor persons in arriving at its
destination. Mr. Kaufman can al
ways be counted on to furnish witty
dialogue; and Miss Dayton is no pik
er along the same line. This up
roarious dissection of> Washington
from-within will undoubtedly be a
sell-out, so get yours early.
