organized to handle senior activities.
Lake will be in charge of business
negotiations with representatives of
various manufacturers, according to
D'Evelyn, and Miss Weber will su
pervise designing and other art work
connected with the commencement
programs and announcements.
Concerns to Bid
Several concerns have been asked
to bid for the class contracts, which
will be let before the close of winter
quarter. Preliminary contract was
made last night with a salesman of
the L. G. Balfour Company.
Lake is a member of Sigma Chi
fraternity and was assistant dra
matics manager last year. His ap

in handling business affairs, asserted
D'Evelyn, who is Sigma Chi presi
dent. Miss Weber, a member of
Kappa Alpha Theta, has participated
in several class activities.
Large Sale Expected
Approximately five thousand an
nouncements must be ordered, ac
cording to last year's figures. Mem
bers of the Class of '36 paid $1 per
copy for their commencement an
nouncements, which netted a profit
of 44 cents each to the class treasury.
The announcement booklets will
be made up of about 30 pages, con-'
taining a list of class committees, the
class roll, several pictures, and other
features. v
Last night's appointments followed
the selection of an endowment fund
committee last'month, and the sen
ior publicity committee Monday.
Additional members of the programs
and announcements group will be
