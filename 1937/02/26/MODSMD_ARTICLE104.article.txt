## Sophisticates Wear Veils; Beret, Turbans Good 
### 
Suzy of Paris at her spring opening
said: "Suivez-moi, jeune homme!"
(follow me, young man). And hat
fashions have followed her theme.
They are beau eatchers.
Hat styles this year are many of
them of the off-the-face type. Be
cause of Iheir back-sweeping effects,
this year's models have been de
scribed as "gone with the wind
hats. The "halo" egect around the
face will be in vogue. All towering
hats will decidedly be out,, and so
will wide brims. Veils will be worn
Rmong the sophisticates. The berets,
turbans (worn back) and the sailor
hats of hist year will still hold their
sway.
Rough and shiny straws, light felts
for sport, silk, and tafTeta are to be
tops. Flowers, birds and such deco
rative finishing touches will be used
extensively.
Because of unusually large selec
tions, individual tastes may be satis
fied in these roll-u-off-the-face hats.
And individual coiffures should fol
low the lines of the hats.
There will be a number of novelty
hals. Most popular among these are
the Spanish hats, particularly fitting
to wear with boleros.
