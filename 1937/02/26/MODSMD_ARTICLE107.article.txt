# Sophistication Out; Formals Go Feminine
## 
### 
In the spring a young man's fancy
lightly turns, and the fashion-wise
coed turns that fancy to a vision ol
femininity with a capital F.
The stream-lined evening model is
out fur spring nights. Adieu to super
sophistication. Into a scene of soft
lights and swing music the wily
woman will drift, trailing yards of
crisp net or chifTon, a small veil
caught with a fresh flower perched
on her soft curls, her feet clad in
open-toed, open-heeled sandals.
Thin. StilT Fabrics
The spring silhouette is designed
to accentuate feminine loveliness;
decollete, high-moulded bust-lines,
full swishing skirts.
Guide words to evening fabrics are
Thin and Stiff, with nets, marqui
settes, starched crepe-de-chine, laces
and chiffons heading the list.
Pastels, misty blues, fog greys,
muted roses are favorite on the color
key with riotous prints running a
close second.
Peasant Influence Strong
Ever-smart are navy or black nets
and taffetas. This season's version of
a navy net formal is threaded with
fine criss-crosses of white set off by
a scarlet belt and flower.
"Look Peasant" finds several
charming manifestations in evening
clothes. One model of sheer blue
chiffon is held snug across the waist
by a triangular band of smocking.
To keep out the night breezes the
coed will choose either a three
quarter length cape or a long prin
cess-style evening wrap. Pale blue
taffeta fashions one wrap smartly
finished with quilted lapels and
cuffs.
