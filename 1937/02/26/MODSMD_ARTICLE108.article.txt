# Spring Hosiery Color Lighter; Red Shades Go
## Clear and Sunny Bieges Show Predominance In Maze of Combinations 
### 
With skirts rising slowly but
steadily, hose that blend with or ac
centuate your color scheme become
increasingly important. And hosiery
this spring is taking a decidedly new
and interesting turn.
First, the old red shades must be
tucked away with your winter hats,
and be supplanted by blond colors,
definitely lighter ones. Beiges rank
highest, both the clear beiges and
those with a sunny cast.
For black, a coppery beige is
smart. Such a combination, im
possible last year, is an important
new note this spring. Neutral taupes
and sun tans are safe selections;
grey and gunmetal for the extreme
ly conservative.
With a blue costume of any shade
copper beige is again the choice, or
a lighter beige if you have beige
accessories. Suntan shades are at
tractive with blue, but the old
taupes are uninteresting. Due to
the call for lighter colors, dark hose
should not be selected.
With grey clothes clear beige and
suntan are significant, and matching
grey should not be overlooked.
With a brown costume it is merely a
matter of blending.
Hose with a rosy tint, or suntan,
are fashion's decree for wear with
light wine and rose. Neutral is dull
and nothing more glaring than cop
per.

To ".slim" the fingerr"lil, remove
a narrow margin oi polish at each
side. Often a hairline of white at
the tip will make the nail look longer
and better proportioned.
