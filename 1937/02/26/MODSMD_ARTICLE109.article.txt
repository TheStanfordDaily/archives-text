# Coats Return To Important Fashion Place
## Unlimited Range of Styles Marked by Swagger, Novelty Plaid Models 
### 
Coats are gloriously important this
spring. They are no longer relegated
to the background by suits, for imag
ination, costume possibilities, and
exciting originality have lilted them
to a pedestal in the fashion sun.
The "Paris Predicts" corner of
Vogue says of coats: "The new sil
houette will wilfully thrust away all
dramatic exaggeration and get rid of
unnecessary accents. No more
shoulder consciousness, the lines will
be well proportioned, narrow and
close to the body, and waists exqui
sitely slim. Dressmakers will con
centrate on elimination, often dis
pensing with revers and belts, whit
tling collars, keeping necklines high
but slim. Buttons, like bellows, are
stationed high on the chest. Fasten
ings will absorb universal attention;
buttons, anything to give a refined
feeling of decoration."
The range of coat styles is unlim
ited: mannish tailoreds, soft dress
maker types, "boxy" and full-length
swaggers, fitted princess models
(furred or unfurred). Most in de
mand are the casual and boxy swag
gers. Standing styles are button-up
flares, gored-backs, front pleats, fit
ted. Hurley fur hip-lengths lined in
vivid colored woolens, Spanish
lambskins with a shaggy, straightish
pelt vie with black lamb caracul in
a 22-inch length with mandarin
sleeves, small front collar, swang
patch pockets and notched shoulders.
Newest materials are worsteds,
novelty plaids, shetlands, gabardine,
dressy wools, tweeds, gorgeous soft
cloud fleeces, new haircloths, and
monotones, including everything
from "high" shades to grey, beige,
navy, and black. Glorious shades of
k'oid, blue, green, nude, Del Monte
rose, brown, oatmeal, also thrill. Do
mestic tweeds may be topped with
white fox dyed to blend or contrast
ed with silver or cross fox or natural
lynx.
The reefer coat is one of the most
important of the new favorites. An
othei new coat is fitted like a dress,
possibly collared and banded with
pique, or no collar at all. Youth itself
is expressed in both the yarns and
cuts of the exciting new coats.
Clips are becoming larger and
more prevalent. The new ones are
worn on cuffs—or one on the hat and
one at the neck—or perhaps one on
each coat lapel.

The "Paris Predicts" corner of
Vogue says of coats: "The new sil
houette will wilfully thrust away all
dramatic exaggeration and get rid of
unnecessary accents. No more
shoulder consciousness, the lines will
be well proportioned, narrow and
close to the body, and waists exqui
sitely slim. Dressmakers will con
centrate on elimination, often dis
pensing with revers and belts, whit
tling collars, keeping necklines high
but slim. Buttons, like bellows, are
stationed high on the chest. Fasten
ings will absorb universal attention;
buttons, anything to give a refined
feeling of decoration."
The range of coat styles is unlim
ited: mannish tailoreds, soft dress
maker types, "boxy" and full-length
swaggers, fitted princess models
(furred or unfurred). Most in de
mand are the casual and boxy swag
gers. Standing styles are button-up
flares, gored-backs, front pleats, fit
ted. Hurley fur hip-lengths lined in
vivid colored woolens, Spanish
lambskins with a shaggy, straightish
pelt vie with black lamb caracul in
a 22-inch length with mandarin
sleeves, small front collar, swang
patch pockets and notched shoulders.
Newest materials are worsteds,
novelty plaids, shetlands, gabardine,
dressy wools, tweeds, gorgeous soft
cloud fleeces, new haircloths, and
monotones, including everything
from "high" shades to grey, beige,
navy, and black. Glorious shades of
k'oid, blue, green, nude, Del Monte
rose, brown, oatmeal, also thrill. Do
mestic tweeds may be topped with
white fox dyed to blend or contrast
ed with silver or cross fox or natural
lynx.
The reefer coat is one of the most
important of the new favorites. An
othei new coat is fitted like a dress,
possibly collared and banded with
pique, or no collar at all. Youth itself
is expressed in both the yarns and
cuts of the exciting new coats.
Clips are becoming larger and
more prevalent. The new ones are
worn on cuffs—or one on the hat and
one at the neck—or perhaps one on
each coat lapel.
Coats are gloriously important this
spring. They are no longer relegated
to the background by suits, for imag
ination, costume possibilities, and
exciting originality have lilted them
to a pedestal in the fashion sun.
