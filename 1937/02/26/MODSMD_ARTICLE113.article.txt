# Daisies, Surrealism Mark Historic Fashion Season
## 
### 
When African daisies compete
wilh dancing peasant dolls, and stol
id Egyptian motifs with modern sur
realist patterns, it may be said that
we lace the most diversified season
in print frocks in fashion's history.
That's just what's happening this
year. Women who have never found
"just the right print" have a new
treat in store for themselves this
spring. And those who feel that most
prints are too tiresome and monoto
nous in their colorings, may throw
their inhibitions to the winds and
select the gayest, splashiest prints or
the neatest geometries, as they
please.
Prints will be seen everywhere,
from dawn to midnight. Printed jer
seys for golf and tennis; printed
jacket frocks for daytime, printed
marquisettes or heavy sheers for
afternoon, and riotous prints on all
types of crepes, satins, or sheers for
evening. There's something very
< xhilarating about them all, and they
make assembling a new wardrobe
an exciting adventure.
Daisies Tell Story
It has always been said, by French
designers who know, that daisies al
ways sell! And that may be why the
story in floral prints comes to us
first in the beautiful daisy prints
from France, quickly modified and
adapted to American taste by our
own manufacturers. Stemmed dai
sies on bright color grounds will be
wo n for daytime, and huge mod
ernistic daisies are scattered over
evening frock .
But all types of florals are smart
in print frocks this year. Flower pot
prints come in amusing new ver
sions, and are not too young to be
worn by women generally. Hand
painted effects in many of the flower
prints make these lovely for bridge
or afternoon frocks.
But large prints are worn for day
time, too, with the new "screen"
print effects. This new process gives
a pleasing and softening effect to
these widely spaced patterns, blend
ing their colors softly against dark
grounds or black.
Wanderlust Prints New
Landscapes and snatches of for
ests or gardens give a fresh appeal
to many new prints. It is amazing
how these are adapted to the casual
treatment of this season's print de
signs. They sound bizarre, but are
really lovely.
Birds, small animals, and even
castles and little peasant cottages,
half hidden by ferns and flowers,
make other designs, all so carefully

handled that the "picture" is lost in
the beauty of color and design.
Border Prints Smart
Flower or Coptic borders and
many modernistic effects are used to
trim the print frock in its own de
sign. It has been many seasons since
borders have been so important, but
with swing skirts and soft draped
bodies and sleeves, the border
treatment loses its set look and be
comes a beautiful part of the dress
design itself. These borders are es
pecially effective around hems and
sashes.
Clusters of flowers, conventional
ized scenes, and amusing peasant
patterns lend themselves well to
border treatment. But undoubtedly
the chief advantage in the self-bor
der print is that it gives the required
depth of color and contrast of design
pattern interesting in the trimming
of the garment.
Gay Tyrolean Motifs
The dancing peasants of the Tyro
lean districts are here again, in high
ly colorful and often amusing prints.
These are lovely in young frocks,
but many of the Tyrol motifs are
conventionalized so that they make
excellent "tailored" pattern for
women too.
Other peasant motifs come to us
from the Dalmatian country, and
from Egypt and even India. The
simplicity of these designs makes
them interesting and adaptable to
tailored daytime frocks. More elab
orate designs are found in Persian
effects, and here color is at its best,
with the soft "old blues and reds and
golds" of rich Persian art.
Paisley is invading Paris this sea
son in everything from sports dress
to woolen coats.
Tricolor sashes will be worn on
dresses.
