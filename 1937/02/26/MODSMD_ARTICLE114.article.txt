# Style Leaders Sponsor Suits For Easter
## Fashioned after Men's Suits; Plaids, Colors Worn in Ensembles 
### 
Suits come out again as chief sup- j
porters of the wardrobe, presaging I
a magnificent spring future as more
and smarter versions of both tai
lored and soft suits and the impor
tant and flattering costume suit be
come entrenched in the limelight.
First in the ranks comes the new
squared silhouette that stylists have :
achieved after taking apart men's i
suits, studying their secrets, and
teaching women's tailors how to do
the "English drape." These are fur
ther augmented by a wealth of dif- \
l'erent fabrics to choose from, and
the finished suit may be endlessly
varied with soft, feminine accesso
ries.
Detail Stressed
In dress suits great attention is
directed to details. Made of sheer
wools and crepes with lingerie 1
touches, fancy pockets, striking but
tons, straightish coats, becoming roll ;
collars are dressmakers' additions
lhat add individuality. The princess
suit of the long coat fitted in back !
with matching skirt is very impor
tant in this the happy season for j
suits.
Then there are the trim three
piece suits with the new hipbone
length jacket and wide lapeled but
ton-down-the-front topcoat. Skirts
may be made to contrast with the I
jacket and topcoat thereby achieving
pertness, youth, and smartness. Fur
trimmed box coats and snug five- |
button jacket is another combination i
for the three-piece suit. For a perky j
color scheme skirt to match the fur j
and jacket and topcoat in waim con
trasting pastels realizes a sure note .
of spring.
Plaids Still Popular
Plaids have maintained a steady
popularity in the range of suiting i
and are assured a definite place in
the spring parade. Novelty simmers |
from the latest—plaid overcoat over
plain suit. Or if you want another \
tricky combine there are plaid
jackets with plain skirts or vice j
versa. Brand new is the plaid band |
on the bottom of skirts.
Luxurious simplicity bespeaks the
superiority of materials for suits this
year. Texture, color, tailoring qual- j
ities and lasting beauty are strik
ingly emphasized. Mainly the trend |
is toward soft materials, the hard
fabrics being relegated for spring, at
least.

suits, studying their secrets, and
teaching women's tailors how to do
the "English drape." These are fur
ther augmented by a wealth of dif- \
l'erent fabrics to choose from, and
the finished suit may be endlessly
varied with soft, feminine accesso
ries.
Detail Stressed
In dress suits great attention is
directed to details. Made of sheer
wools and crepes with lingerie 1
touches, fancy pockets, striking but
tons, straightish coats, becoming roll ;
collars are dressmakers' additions
lhat add individuality. The princess
suit of the long coat fitted in back !
with matching skirt is very impor
tant in this the happy season for j
suits.
Then there are the trim three
piece suits with the new hipbone
length jacket and wide lapeled but
ton-down-the-front topcoat. Skirts
may be made to contrast with the I
jacket and topcoat thereby achieving
pertness, youth, and smartness. Fur
trimmed box coats and snug five- |
button jacket is another combination i
for the three-piece suit. For a perky j
color scheme skirt to match the fur j
and jacket and topcoat in waim con
trasting pastels realizes a sure note .
of spring.
Plaids Still Popular
Plaids have maintained a steady
popularity in the range of suiting i
and are assured a definite place in
the spring parade. Novelty simmers |
from the latest—plaid overcoat over
plain suit. Or if you want another \
tricky combine there are plaid
jackets with plain skirts or vice j
versa. Brand new is the plaid band |
on the bottom of skirts.
Luxurious simplicity bespeaks the
superiority of materials for suits this
year. Texture, color, tailoring qual- j
ities and lasting beauty are strik
ingly emphasized. Mainly the trend |
is toward soft materials, the hard
fabrics being relegated for spring, at
least.
