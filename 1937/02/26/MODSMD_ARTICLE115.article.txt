# Informal Dresses Discreetly Flared
## 
### 
With a swing away from the very
flaring skirt, puff sleeves and prin
cess lines, fashion has produced a
new series of smart yet simple frocks
which are extremely appropriate for
Sunday evenings or informal dates.
Frilly necklines, two-piece styl
ing, belts of self material, more nor
mal sleeve lines and narrower skirts
in which fullness is often concealed
in pleats or insert foldsâ€”these are
the chic details of the new casual
dress.
