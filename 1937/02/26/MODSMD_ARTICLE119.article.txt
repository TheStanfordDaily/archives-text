# Latest Bathing Suits Flattering To Figure
## 
### FLORENCE KEHL 
Pleasing the men, ladies, is the sole
aim of feminine styles this spring,
and bathing suits are no exception!
The figure's the thing! Uplifts and
shirring; flared skirts or smooth fit
ting satin—all are designed to make
the feminine swimmer put Venus
in the shade.
The "Maillot" style (without skirts,
to you) is more popular than ever
in milady's one-piece bathing suit.
And if you want to join the other
fifty per cent who are still clinging
to skirts, you must go in for flares
and pleats which adorn the new
cottons of this season.
New Fabrics Add to Grace
The 1937 woman bather need
worry no longer about that ghastly
drooping effect that once made her
hate to emerge fro/, the water. The
new fabrics are strong-bodied and
figure molding. From the plain,
smooth cut satins which come in
such new flattering shades to the
waffled, wavy knits, we find grace
and beauty in line and design, and
a tenacious clinging quality that re
fuses to be changed by water.
Cottons are more popular than
ever before, and so temptingly rea
sonable! Close fitting jersey suits
have been put underneath the piques
and linens, giving them a dress
maker effect plus the comfort needed
for serious swimming.
You are not going to see much
black at the beach or on the shores
of Lagunita this spring. Salmon,
turquoise, midnight and powder
blues, white, gold, and bittersweet
will mingle with red and white bar
ber pole stripes and gayly colored
Paisley prints.
Square necks, and halters that may
be converted into shoulder straps,
are making bathing suit necklines
flattering yet comfortable for real
swimming!
Vogue Favors Short Coats
The beach coat you thankfully don
after a chilly swim may be as shor*
as your suit, or as long as you want
it. The Dirnl—a gathered skirt on

a semi-fitting bask—has become a
popular motif for chintz and linen
coats. "Vogue" pictures an alpaca
suit with its own pert jacket to
match. Whether your preference be
long or short coats, pleats or gathers,
you'll love the new figured materials
that range from pictured bathing
girls, mermaids, ships, and tattooed
sailors, to stars and crabs.
And believe it or not, President
Roosevelt's trip to the South Ameri
can countries will influence your
lounging costume for the beach. The
new bolero styles, loose jacket and
smart beach skirt, are the upshot of
our President's "good wiil tour"!
Shorts and Slacks Are Mannish
Women are copying the male more
than ever in this season's slacks and
shirts. It has been discovered that
the material used in men's Palm
Beach suits has a heaven-sent non
wrinkling quality that is superb for

the beach. This natural color mate
rial is particularly smart when com
bined with wine or brown.
Japan and Hollywood have com
bined in giving us a startling, new
beach slipper called Tabis. Canvas
soled and cotton topped, these shoes
are mitten-like with a separate sec
tion for the big toe.
And don't forget to link your Tiva
scarfs together, wind them tightly,
and tie them around your hair.
You'll not have that frowzy blown
look, and the coronet effect is strik
ing and flattering.
