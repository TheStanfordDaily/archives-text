# Co-eds Will Give Vent To 'Cosmetic Urge'
## 
### MARGARET LOUD 
Whether the Rough approves or
not, the coed will forsake the facial
back-to-nature trends of last year
and give vent to her "Cosmetic Urge'
this spring. Though still decidedly
out of place on the Quad or in the
classroom, make-up, particularly eye
make-up, will be a great deal more
important this year than it has for a
long time.
One of the first signs of the grow
ing use of make-up is the increasing
number of compacts equipped with
mascara, eye-shadow, and lipstick,
as well as the usual powder and
rouge. Elizabeth Arden and Dorothy
Gray have been among the first to
out out regular compacts of this sort,
but now numerous novelty ones are
on the market. This spring has also
seen the return of big box-like van
ity cases, reminiscent of the flapper
era.
New Lipsticks Used
Orange-red lipsticks, usuallv so
popular in spring and summer, have
been discarded. Instead, the smart
coed will substitute blue-red shades.
One new versatile color is Corday s
'Electric" lipstick, which is becoming
to both blondes and brunettes. An
other recent Corday invention is a
weather-proof lipstick, guaranteed
not to run or harden in any climate
—whether the wearer is skiing at
Yosemite or sunning hersell at
Carmel.
Instead of trying to match lipstick
and fingernail polish this year, the
coed should match her lipstick with
rouge and have the two blend well
Vvith her eye make-up. Speaking of
rouge, it's better to use cream or
liquid that will stay on for hours
rather than to keep rubbing on dry
rouge throughout the day.
Two Shaded Lipsticks
Use of two shades of powder is also
coming into vogue. The undercoat of
powder should be of a shade lighter
than the skin; the top-coat of a shade
darker than the skin. This produces
a smooth, glowing effect.
Colorful hues of mascara and eye
shadow are also on the in. No longer
confined to somber brown and black,
milady will use violet or green eye
lash colors if she has light brown
eyes; violet will make blue eyes look
bluer; and dark green or a violet
shade in the daytime will help the
few who have green eeys. The coed
will be wise, however, if she limits

her mascara in the daytime.
Different Nail-Polish
Bright nail polishes are swinging
in with spring, though use of them
is purely a matter of personal taste.
Revlon polish is especially good for
the coed, as it will actually stay on
for almost a week, without chipping
off. A brilliant new Revlon red color
is "Mahogany." Peggy Sage's new
shade "Coronation," a deep red pol
ish with undertones of blue, is a
perfect match for new beige and
navy blue clothes.
Smaller Kleenex Tissues
Kleenex Lipstick Tissues, just out
on the market, are a new asset to any
make-up table. Encased in a box the
size of a match folder, the lipstick
tissues can be used to wipe off old
lipstick before putting on a new
mouth, to remove surplus lipstick,
take powder out of the corners of
the eye, take off bits of stray polish
on nail cuticles, clean compact mir
rors or fountain pens.
A word about perfumes. It now
seems to be the fad to collect a num
ber of scents in miniature fancy bot
tles rather than to stick to one or
two big bottles. Tweed, which has
been used for such a long time, is
now wearing out in popularity. Some
perfumes that have been out for
many years, but are still good for
spring, are Yardley's April violet;
Caron's Belodgia and Tabac Blond;
and Lanvin's "Scandal."
In keeping with the mixtures of
materials coming in so strongly this
spring are suede-and-patent bags—
often bright colored with black pat
ent leather.
