varicly makes choosing an easy task.
New spring bags contrast with the
predominant colors, beige and gray, j

and suede bags. When wearing all |
black, carry a little white pigskin j
bag to enliven the outfit. To match
the felt facings on the new fine i
straw hats, brilliant colored felt j
handbags are being used. For the I
summer days ahead, white linen and j
pique bags with colored initials are j
advocated. In fact, initialed bags j
are all the vogue. It your new purse
is not the top-handle type, then it
must have a zipper with zipper
glovcs to match.
Gloves to Contrast
Gloves must either match the cos
tume perfectly or contrast glaringly.
Colors out of the ordinary have been
influenced by the coming coronation.

rhythm blue, king purple, silver
tone, Kelly green, regal blue, cara
mel, harness, and sailor blue.
Under the same influence, that of
the coronation, jewelry is definitely
regal. Copies of the Victorian jewels
are being worn, while fashion says
it's still pearls with everything.

town costumes for spring is tortoise
shell jewelry—earrings, clips, pins,
and bracelets. As far as hair orna

common or garden varieties are still
in good taste. This includes dinky
jewels, clips, and real or artificial
flowers.

people will be using sterling silver
buttons; while others will resort to
pompom buttons. Rope-and-leather
belts will be worn 011 sport dresses

any dark dress. Patent leather belts

purses.

fashion or turned in to form an
a.«cot. Some of them are initialed
like the other types of accessories.

what accessories you get this season,
be sure there is contrast.
