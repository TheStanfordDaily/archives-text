flattering and the lines are com- i
pletely new and different. High in- j
stcp.s and open toes dominate the ;
field of footwear. In general the ,
trend is toward the sandal type and
that means as cut away as possible.

rated with bows, pointed vamps and
stitched straps across the toe.
Patent leather plays an impor
tant role in what the best dressed
feet are wearing. To be really up to
the minute your dressy sport sandals
may match your new spring print.
For evening wear unusual lines j
are in vogue. While for teas, gar
den parlies, and general summer
use bright colored shoes add an ex
citing tone to even last year's reno
vated linen. The cocktail slipper
has at last come into its own. On
the brass railings dainty black heel
less pumps and dashing India print
sandals monopolize the footwear for
the cocktail hour.
Take heart, your shoes no longer
are a problem, for beautifully shod
feet are easily attainable.
