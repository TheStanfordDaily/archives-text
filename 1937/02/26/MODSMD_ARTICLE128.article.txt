will be stressed in handkerchiefs and
scarves for men this season. Check
and stripe patterns in this color
scheme are expected to predominate.

the once sober tobacco pouches
which are blossoming forth in rain
bow hues.
Braided leather braces and belts
are becoming increasingly popular, j
Spring belts, and cloth belts to match
suits are also spreading.
In hats, quieter and deeper colors
will prevail this season. The mid
night blue Homburg with a wcll
rolled brim is suggested for evening
weai - , while a sporty felt with a snap
brim fits in well on all informal
occasions.
Leather articles of all sorts will
be thoroughly in style this season.
Leather suit buttons, and leather
watch strap and fob for breastpocket
wear are very popular. In wallets
and billfolds the trend is toward

crocodile leather or a similar rough
finish in bright colors. Leather
straps are still popular for wrist
watches, although the metal bracelet
is gaining increasing favor.
Garters will continue to come in
brilliant colors, striking patterns, al
though what the point is nobody
seems to know.
