# Organ Solo Unit Installed
## Wires To Carry Music For Commencement 
### 
Next June's Commencement Day
audience will sit in the amphitheater
and hear the processional roll from
a "new organ" behind the trees.
But organ and organist will be
over a mile away in the Chapel. The
music will be "rebroadcast" through
huge loudspeakers.
And the "new organ" as it plays
in the amphitheater will be a real
new organ, though it still hides be
hind the Victorian decorations of
the Chapel organ-box.
All Space Used
Augmenting the older instrument
is a solo organ, anonymously do
nated to the University, of 1000 pipes,
and including one of the longest
organ-pipes ever made, 32 feet long
and sounding a note an octave lower
than low "C" on the piano.
The added unit, installation of
which was completed this week, is
anomalous to the brass section of a
symphony orchestra, and so crowds
the organ-loft of the Chapel that
special plans of the available space
had to be consulted before it could
be built. Installed, it occupied every
available inch of space between the
narrow ladders and cat-walks be
tween the pipes.
Playing by "remote control" in the
Memorial Theater as well as the
amphitheater, the sound will be
picked up in the Chapel balcony and
sent through special wires to re
producing speakers.
Resale Value High
The additional unit brings the
total number of pipes to 5000. They
are of a zinc-tin- alloy, unlike the
original outside pipes made of tin
and installed in 1901, so valuable us
scrap metal that their sale could
make later improvements possible.
The present console, installed in
1925, makes provision for later addi
tions, of which the solo organ is the
first.
Christening hy Allen
Sunday afternoon the new unit
will be christened by Warren D.
Allen, University organist, during
the vesper recital at 4 o'clock. It will
be played publicly for the second
time at the Tuesday recital, when
the program will include works by
Alexander Schreiner, organist at
U.C.L.A. and formerly of the Salt
Lake City Mormon Tabernacle.
The complete program follows:
"Lohengrin" Prelude
Richard Wagner
Trumpet Tune and Air
Henry Purcell
"The History of the Stanford Organ"
D. Elton Trueblood, Chaplain
