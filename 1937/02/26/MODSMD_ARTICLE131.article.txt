# Curls Brushed High Off Face, Coiffure 'Must'
## Upward Ringlets Good; Downward Back Roll Gives 'Page Boy' Effect 
### 
Brush it up —roll it up—but get it !
up high, and way off the face. That j
is the essence of fashion's decree for j
the incoming spring coiffures. In- I
creasingly intricate, v/ith sweeping,
tilted, pompadour rolls and compli
cated masses of sculptured waves
and ringlets, the new coifs necessi
tate even more than usual care and
grooming.
The novel "inverted curl" comes
into its own. This new system of
waving the hair must be explained
before its manifold advantages can
be understood. The old fashioned
way of "putting up" back curls is to
roll them outward and upward. The
up-to-date way is to roll them down
ward and inward. All the little
curls then appear to be going in the
wrong direction, but when they are
combed out they prove very versa
tile, and will go almost any way that
proves most becoming and appro
priate. The same forelock of hair
| can serve as a high, impressive pom
padour roll in the evening and a
number of sleek, fiat curls which lie
streamlined back from the face for
campus daytime activity.
Turn your back hair under in a
smooth downward roll to create the
new "page boy" effect. Or brush it
vigorously upward into an alarming
tuft of ringlets toward the top of
the head. The latter style, with the
hair brushed high away from the
face and neck all around, goes beau
tifully under the new hats that are
jammed way forward on your head.
Fitting equally well under the oiT
the-face turbans which will rank so
high this season, is a hair-do of
sculptured waves or ringlets fram
ing the face, but still moving up and
away from it.
The versatility of the inverted
curl makes possible all these smart
coiffures without separate sessions
under the dryer. A few moments'
skill with brush and comb accom
plishes any of them, besides many
other original and exciting scalp
sculps.
