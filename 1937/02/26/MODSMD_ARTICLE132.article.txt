# Box Coats, Boleros Among New Styles
## 
### 
Box coats and boleros are among
the many styles in coats now being
shown. Others are fitted at the waist
with a flare. The perennially popu
lar swagger still makes a good ap
pearance. Many of these are tweed,

| which are woven in lovely, new,
j vivid colors.
Suede top coats are a recent im
i port from England.
There is an uptrend toward coat
sweaters, although V-necks or .slip
overs have plenty of call. A norfoik
style of corduroy jacket is quite pop
ular for sport wear.
