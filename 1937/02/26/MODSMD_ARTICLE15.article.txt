# Class Visits Jail; 'Watch Spoons,' Cry Jail Hens
## 
### 
Several Stanford students stood
behind bars Wednesday when the
Criminology Class went to jailâ€”the
San Francisco county jail.
The men inside were friendly and
mildly curious as they walked about
or watched from the dormitory
wings. But, in the women's building,
idle inmates pushed straggling hair
from hard faces and screamed:
"Watch the silverware, girls!" as
the Stanford students filed by.
