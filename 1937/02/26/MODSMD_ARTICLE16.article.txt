## 
### H. V. ALWARD, JR 
When a university professor writes a textbook, no one bats an eye;
but when a professor writes a novel, the world waits with bated breath.
Such is (he case now that Richard LaPiere, Stanford sociology professor,
has written "Son of Han," a story of China in the early part of the last
century.
The volume will be published by Harper and Brothers, April 2, and it
has already been named a "find," a book well worth a great deal of pub-

licity, but written by an
author.
Mr. LaPiere, although the author
of a textbook, "Social Psychology,"
has never before attempted a novel.
In writing the book, the author com
pleted six different drafts. Said La-
Piere: "It required more than six
years and over a million words be
fore I had 100,000 words which a
publisher was willing to put into
print."
The novel was started here at
Stanford in connection with the au
thor's work. He reviews a little of
its background: "I began the book in
1930 as a sociological monograph on
the old Chinese system, to be written
in collaboration with a Chinese stu
dent.
"As the work progressed, I became
exceedingly interested in the per
sonal, human story conveyed by a
group of scholarly poems written by
ancestors of this student, and
through which they had expressed
their various hopes, ideals, failures,
and successes. The monograph was
side-tracked by my effort to tell this
story in a way which will be un
derstandable to the Western reader.
That story, as it now stands, is a
novel, "Son of Han."
