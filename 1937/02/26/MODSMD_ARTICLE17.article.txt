# Lines Get Laughs In 'Brief Moment'
## 
### 
Sophisticated patter, admirably
unccnsored and slung by a blues
singer, an introspective charm boy,
a not so introspective polo player, a
gangster and an Epicurean skeptic
made Sword and Sandals' reading of
S. N. Behrirjan's "Brief Moment"
much good fun.
The scanty plot served to hold the
lines together. A complicated prod
uct of aristocratic Park Avenue,
Roderick Dean, played well by dim
pled Jim Corner, decides he wants
the simple life as personified by
Abby Fane, a night club singer, alias
husky-Voiced Jane Clary, who, in
cidentally, would have done better
had she held up her head.
But Abby, after marriage, turns
out to be less simple than ho thought,
and the marriage seems headed for
the rocks when love conquers all,
amen.
Jack Beaty, as the lethargic friend,
drawled oft the hit lines ih outstand
ing fashion, and Bill Goldner, in a
small part, carried off his Russian
characterization in fine- . Lapidus
style. Pauline Stevens, in another
small |>ert, was refreshing and natu
ral.
Hal Kahn and Ken Peters com
pleted a cast which was very well
chosen. To Jack Temple go plaudits
for snappy direction and the sense
to leave in linns which hurt no one
and amused all.
