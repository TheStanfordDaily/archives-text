# Senate Extends Trade Treaty
## F.D.R. Power To Make Agreements Continued 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (U.R).—
The Senate late today voted to ex
tend the life of the Reciprocal Trade
Treaty Act until 1940 after defeat
ing overwhelmingly a series of
amendments designed to curb Pres
ident Roosevelt's power under the
measure.
The vote was 58 to 24.
The measure, already approved by
the House, now goes to the White
House for Mr. Roosevelt's signature.
The act—corner stone of the Admin
istration's foreign commerce policy—
was due to expire on June 12.
The biggest threat to the measure
came shortly before its passage when
four Senators from Florida and Lou
isiana jammed a "less-than-produc
tion" cost amendment through the
chamber by a vote of 43 to 36. The
amendment would have prevented
the President from fixing the tariff
on any agricultural product so low
that the foreign cost of production
plus the duty would equal or fall
below the cost of producing a simi
lar product in the United States.
Amazed by the surprise defeat,
Chairman Pat Harrison, D., Miss.,
of the Finance Committee in charge
of the bill, warned that the amend
ment would "practically kill" the
trade program. He changed his vote
from "nay" to "aye" in order to
force a reconsideration of the vote.
