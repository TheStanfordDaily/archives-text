UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, Feb. 25. — Resolved
that the Sons of the Stanford Red
shall be knocked fron; their lofty
perch, 11 members of Coach Sam
Barry's championship aspiring U.S.C.
basketball team boarded the Lark
tonight for Palo Alto.
More than 500 spirited U.S.C. root
ers, gathered at the Southern Pacific
depot 1o send the Trojans on their
way, cheered Coach Berry's parting
remarks that if U.S.C. toppled the
P»edskins in the first game, they
would repeat Saturday night.
Troy's Cripples Play
Troy's chances of victory against
the indomitable Hank Luisetti and
company were boosted by the last
minute announcement that cripples
Carl Anderson, Hal Dornsife, and
Hal Remson were no longer on the
injured list and would be able to
play in the crucial series. Other
members of the trailing troup in
cluded Guards Captain Eddy Oram,
Bobby Dale, and John Palsce; Cen
ter John Kewak; Forwards Wayne
Garriuon, Gail Goodrich, Jerry Gra
cin, and Clem Ruh.
Earlier in the week it was feared
that Anderson, first string center,
and Dornsife, reserve guard, would
be unable to play because of knee
injuries developed in practice; while
Remson, regular guard, has just re
cuperated from a sprained shoulder
suffered in the Stanford series down
here last month.
Barrymen Underdogs
Coach Sam Barry has seemed
pleased all week by the fact that the
Trojans are underdogs in the cham
pionship series, giving U.S.C. the
psychological edge. More than 100
Trojan students will take the high
way early in the morning in order
to arrive at Palo Alto in time for
the tip-off. If anybody is going to
put the skids under John Bunn's
great five this year, U.S.C. will do
the trick.
