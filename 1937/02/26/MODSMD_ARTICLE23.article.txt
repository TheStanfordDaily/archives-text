# Toyon Club, Lagunita Hall Hold Dances
## 
### 
Two dances open to all Univei'sity
students will provide the week-end's
on-carnpus evening entertainment.
Toyon-Branner Winter Formal is
set for tonight at 9 o'clock in Toyon
Lobby. Tomorrow evening at 9:30
o'clock Lagunita Court will sponsor
an informal dance in Women's Gym.
Bids for both affairs are on sale in
the A.S.S.U. office, at $3 for the
formal, 50 cents for tomorrow's af
fair. Programs for those already
having bids for the formal are now
available at the A.S.S.U. office.

To accommodate the larger
crowd expected since the La
gunita dance has been made an
all-University affair, its loca
tion has been changed from
Lagunita Court to Women's
Gym.

Ernie Heckscher's band will pro
vide the music at the Toyon dance,
featuring as guest soloist Emilio
Jauregui, who spent two years sing
ing with European dance orches
tras. Banjo specialty numbers by
Heckscher are promised in addition
to his well-known guitar strum
ming.
"Guests" at the Formal will dance
in the patio of a Spanish hacienda,
with the orchestra on a terrace be
neath a balcony of the ranch-house.
Candy, cigarettes, and punch will
be served throughout the evening.
At the Lagunita dance decorations
will be featured involving Stanford
and S.C. colors. Refreshments arc
promised.
Coaches and players of both the
Stanford and S.C. basketball teams
will be guests of honor.
