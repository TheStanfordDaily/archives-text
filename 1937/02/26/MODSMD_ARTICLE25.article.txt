# Laughing Boys Prepare To Hold League Lead; Calderwood Out of Tilt
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Commencing at 8:15 this evening
in the Pavilion, Sam J. Barry's Uni
versity of Southern California bas
ketball squad will match field goals
with that of Stanford's league-lead
ing Indians in the third and most
crucial game of their annual series.
And tomorrow eve, the two teams
meet again in a contest which will
be more or less crucial than tonight's
get-together, depending entirely on
the outcome of the latter.
Cards Hold Lead
As matters stand, John Bunn'.s
Cards hold a one-game lead over
the men of Troy with but three Con
ference games remaining to be
played by both aggregations. So, the
Conference title bids fair to be
settled one way or another over the
week-end.
True, the Injuns hold a mathe
matical edge, for the Trojans will
have to win tonight and tomorrow
night to stay in the running for the
undisputed championship. But. a
split series, provided the Trojans
can blast U.C.L.A. next Friday,
which seems likely, and provided
Stanford loses to Cal next week, will
send the boys into a tie with nine
wins and three loses apiece.
The Cards, in all probability, will
enter the lists tonight as slight fa
vorites.
Calderwood Out
However, with the reception of the
almost definite news that All-Coast
Guard Jack Calderwood's bad case of
poison oak will keep him from seeing
action, an even, closely fought battle
seems almost a certainty.
Bunn, though relieved at the re
appearance of both Hank Luisetti
and Art Stoefen, both of whom have
been confined in the hospital for the
past couple of days, will be forced to
play either Phil Zonne or Nellie
Heath in Calderwood's guard spot.
The former holds the inside track on
the starting berth, according to
Bunn.
With the return of Luisetti, who
was favoring his badly bruised knee
only slightly in yesterday's workout,
the anticipated change of Captain
Dinty Moore's playing position from
guard to forward will not material
ize, and Cap'n Dint will cavort at his
accustomed post.
Thus, the Stanford line-up will
consist of the four regulars, Howie
Turner and Hank Luisetti at for
wards, Art Stoefen at center, and
Captain Moore at one guard, with
either Phil Zonne or Heath at the
remaining guard.
Trojan Line-up
U.S.C. Mentor Barry, whose eleven
charges left with him from the
Southland last evening, will prob
ably field a quintet looking a great
deal like this: Wayne Garrison and
Jerry Gracin at forwards, Carl
(Buttacup) Anderson at center, and
Captain Eddie Oram and either Hal
Dornsife or Bill Remseri at guards.
Oram, an all-Coast selection last,
year and generally rated the best
defensive guard in the West, has
been Troy's principal scoring threat
in its last two encounters.
Barry will hold Forward Clem
Rub in reserve during the first half,
but the lad who busted up the first
Stan'ord-U.S.C. battle last month, in
which the Trojans came through
with a 42-39 upset win, will see
plenty of action before the 40 min
utes are out.
Tonight's and tomorrow night's
basketball games, between Stanford
and U.S.C. will be broadcast over
KQW with Doug Montell at the
microphone. Both programs begin at
8 p.m.
