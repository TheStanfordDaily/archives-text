# Student Prexy States Views On Activities
## Declares Student Should Hold Single A.S.S.U. Position at One Time 
### 
Student government is not of
paramount importance in itself, but
merely in the valuable training it
affords —that's the theory advanced
by President Jim Reynolds. Conse
quently he proposes a plan under
which a student can hold only one
A.S.S.U. office at a time.
"Since these offices are merely a
form of student education, as many
men and women as possible should be
»iven the opportunity to take part
in the activities," said Reynolds yes
terday. "If the purpose of student
government were efficiency rather
ihan experience, we would hire olli
i.ers," was his answer to those who
mention the greater abilities of the
. elect few.

y iggested move are and where the
line of control should be drawn is

Student government is not of
paramount importance in itself, but
merely in the valuable training it
affords —that's the theory advanced
by President Jim Reynolds. Conse
quently he proposes a plan under
which a student can hold only one
A.S.S.U. office at a time.
"Since these offices are merely a
form of student education, as many
men and women as possible should be
»iven the opportunity to take part
in the activities," said Reynolds yes
terday. "If the purpose of student
government were efficiency rather
ihan experience, we would hire olli
