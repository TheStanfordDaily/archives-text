# Sororities Swing Sundays Dateless Just Don' Wanna
## 
### BOB SHERMAN 
If you are a row girl, do you
spend your Sunday evenings at
home? Ytu do not, that is not to
speak of. In a survey made by the
Daily on a typical Sunday night, the

following inter
est in g results
were disclosed.
Eleven girls in—
everybody else
"gone out."
A nice voice at
the Alpha Phi
house told us
that just two
girls would be
home tonight.
The Theta's were
insulted and

hung up. The lovely Pi Phi's said
that three girls weren't going out,
but they weren't a bit lonely. The
Tri Delts had no idea who was home,

they also hung
up. The laugh
ing Kappas were
all out. The "Dee
gee who answer
ed the phone
sighingly re
in a r k e d that
three girls were
staying home.
In the Chi O
house no one
was home, no
dates here. The

Gamma Phis told us to wait while

she found out. When she came back
she had already found two girls who
weren't going out. We asked her if
they wanted to go out. She came
back in a moment*and thanking us

for our interest
hung up. The
Alpha O's had
exactly three
girls who "want
ed" to go to bed
early.
We got in our
car and drove up
the row. We
drove in front of
all the sororities
and then in back
of them. We got

J out and prowled around. All the
I lights were on in the Deegee house;

Phi Phi house
was not dark,
and the Kappa
house was abso
lutely no place
for a b u r g 1 a r .
Lights glistened
in almost all of
the other houses,
but the poor fel
low who wanted
a row date
would e i th er
I have to forget it

| all and study or else —oh well, any
' one of eleven.
