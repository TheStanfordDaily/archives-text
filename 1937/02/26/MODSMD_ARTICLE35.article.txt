DO THEY EVER
BREAK THE WINDOWS?
The polo team left yesterday fo
Oregon to engage the Oregon Stat<
squad at Corvallis tonight and to
morrow, aiid thereby hangs a tale.
It won't be the type of polo playet
in California that the Indians anc
the Beavers will whip through, bu
rather indoor polo. Now, most Cali
fornians rear back in amazemeni
when they hear somebody mentior
playing horse polo indoors, because
the game is practically unknown oul
here.
However, the game is quite popu
lar back East, since the weathei
there- is more prohibitive to outdooi
polo than in California. Jim Fuller
ton. one of the four men who wenl
north yesterday — the others were
brother Bob Fullerton, Rammy Ras
mussen, and Bob Wallace—has play
ed quite a bit of the game in the
East, along with Rasmussen and hi.'
brother, and he was in explaining i
Jew points yesterday.
It seems that the th'ree, Rasmussen
Fullerton, and ditto, were all team
mates on the Culver Military Acad
emy' squad before coming to Stan
ford. Quite a few of the Culvei
contests were played indoors.
Only a three-man team is used
and the game is played with an in
fl.ited ball that looks very much like
a peewee soccer ball. About the
only thing that's similar between the
indoor and outdoor games, accord
ing to Captain Grubbs, R.O.T.C
head and coach, is that they still use
the horses.
lIV FRY TIME IT RAINS,
i i RAINS OUT BASEBALL
Coach Harry Wolter ought to be
throwing up his hands and wailing
"Wot's the use?" since his team was
r; ined out of the second C.1.8.A
game set for Wednesday against St
Mary's. Rain balked two attempts tc
hold the Santa Clara game, but they
finally got that one off a week age
on the third trial.
The Gael game has been reset for
Monday. Maybe there will be
enough sun over the week-end tc
dry up the Moraga field, and maybe
there won't be.
JUST BEGINNING. BUT
WHAT A START
The large gent who calls himself
Tom Montgomery had a little trouble
in the shot-put during the practice
meet held Tuesday afternoon, and
could do only 46-4, while Reynolds
elicl 4i}-5 and Hucklebridge did 48-4.
Dink has been figuring on Mont
gomery as a probable great to add to
the list of Stanford weight-men, and
chances are he will be far better than
the average weight-man on most
track teams. Tuesday he just could
n't get under the shot, for some rea
son, and couldn't come up to the 48-5
mark he set earlier this year.
Besides that, he had been throw
ing that half-ton birdshot around too
much the day before. He came out
Wednesday and almost reached 48
feet, so that practice meet debacle
was just a lapse. Stick to it, kid,
you'll be a champ before you know
it.
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU'RE LOSING
The California basketball manag
ers always were willing to bet theii
manager's sweaters against the Stan
lord managers' sweaters in past years
upon the outcome of the Stanford-
Cal series. This year it happens that
Ihc Bear managers decided Stanford
was just too good, and so they were
too weak-hearted to bet their sweat
ers.
Only one junior manager from Cal
luid enough nerve, and faith in his
own basketball team, to be willing
to bet his sweater. He lost his sweat
er when Stanford beat Cal last Fri
<lay, but he gaineel a lot more.
What's the matter, over there at
Berkeley, are you guys licked before
you start?
