JACK CALDERWOOD. upper left, is a doubtful starter, since he
still is having a tough time with a case of poison oak. Bob Zonne, upper
right, definitely will not play; his arm is still in a sling as a result of the
dislocated shoulder he incurred in the Santa Clara game. Stoefen,
lower left, and Luisetti, lower right, will start, but neither has had any
practice this week. Art was down until yesterday with an upset stom
ach. Hank was treated for a knee bruise he got in the Bronco game.
