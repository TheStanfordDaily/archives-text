# Frosh To Meet Galileo Quintet
## Will Be Prelim to U. S. C. Hoop Battle Tonight 
### 
Attempting to regain their shoot- j
ing eyes, Stanford's Papoose basket- j
bailers have this week been granted,
by Mentor Wytze Gorier, cancella- J
tion of formal practice.
Monday and Tuesday Ihe frosh
gathered together on the Pavilion
floor, but the boys did nothing ex
cept try to find the hoop, a charac
teristic lacking last week-end. The
rest of the week has been spent in
individual practice—'fooling around'
—which is a great help toward elim
inating staleness, according to Psy
chologist-Coach Gorter.
Tonight, at 6:30, the Papoose quin
tet meets Galileo High as a prelim
to the first 11.5.C. tilt. Galileo's
Bruce Hale, leading scorer in the un
limited class for City high schools,
has chalked up tJG points in six
games, and has been a fundamental
factor in holding his team in third
place in a fast league. In tomorrow's
prelim, the frosh tangle with Pied
mont High at the same time, same
place.
