TALENTED is the pen of Richard LaPiere.
Six years ago it turned from sociology and
econ to delicate prose, a vivid novel, "Son of
Han."
Today a great national publishing house an
nounces "a find ... a distinguished novel by
a writer of importance."
To Stanford, the sensitive lines of LaPiere's
pen come as a refreshing zephyr midst the
winds of freedom, winds that blow too often
from Stanford's many professor - authors as
storm gusts —heavy texts in technical termi
nology, many times-dull, often requiring com
pulsory student purchase.
LaPiere's breeze is new and cool where hot
winds blow. He writes a swift and dramatic
story with gorgeous portrait studies in exquisite
prose set in a background of China during the
last century, with its dignity, its tradition, its
fine flowering of the classical spirit.
Like this:
"Perhaps it was the softness in the air, the
gentle creak of a sign swinging with each little
gust of wind, some extraordinary synthesis of
sight and sound sensations, which made him
feel this way. A strange sensation. A combina
tion of physical well-being and mental compla
cence, of detachment.
" 'Detachment,' he whispered to a banner
fluttering overhead. He knew that he had found
the word, a definition for the feeling which this
contemplative street had given him. Detached,
and at the same time identified. Life was all a
matter of perspective."
Clean, cool, refreshingly different. Thank
you, Mr. LaPiere.—G. F.
