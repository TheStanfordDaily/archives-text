BILL WARD doesn't wait for things to hap
pen.
When he saw that the campus' alleged dream
(or an honest-to-Jorgensen nitery was being
diluted into a Union "social gathering-place,"
he promptly rounded up 280 students to sign a
demand for a $10,000 Lagunita night-club. And
for a while, A.S.S.U. bosses were afraid they
might have to build him one.
Bill's petition, like the lake-side dancery, was
soon side-tracked. But Bill wasn't. If Ex Com
mittee couldn't see his nitery, he would think
of something else.
He did—the Recreation Club.
Ex Committee quickly gave its approval. The
7-to-8 dances every other Wednesday were "a
very good idea" and, probably more important,
wouldn't cost the A.S.S.U. a cent. Mr. Ward
agreed to accept the full financial responsibility.
Night before last about 30 couples paid 25
cents, danced out the hour with the club's four
piece orchestra. Those that came had a good
time, but Bill is disappointed that there weren't
more, that most dancers arrived in automobiles.
The Recreation Club is pointed at those who
want an inexpensive social diversion, at those
who haven't cars to drive to country clubs or
Nob Hills. That it is not fulfilling its purpose is
• bill's fault.
