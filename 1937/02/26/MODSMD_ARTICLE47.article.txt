# Twenty-two Years and Now

(From the U.C.L.A. Bruin)
news is always full of stories —humorous,
ronic, tragic, horrible.
I wonder how many noticed a story in the
...ews very recently, a story about the pope who,
after months of illness, got Out of bed to kneel

down and pray to God to help tho Spanish
rebels capture Malaga.
Twenty-two years ago the French soldiers
knelt and prayed that God might help them
shoot "the filthy Boche."
It took many post-war years before both
peoples admitted quietly that God must have
answered No, my children, I am neutral.
And now the present-day pope, representa
tive of God on earth, is kneeling and praying
for the Spanish rebels.
As I said, the news is always full of stories
and this one might be called ironic—or tragic
if you so choose.
Complete sanity is all the happiness the
human being has any right to ask for.—Mar
