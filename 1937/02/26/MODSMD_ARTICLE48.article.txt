AS I AM WRITING this, there is grave doubt that
the Daily's 8-page fashion edition will ever come
out. The woman fashion writers have thrown them
selves weeping on their typewriters, their distinctive
coiffures that should be rising back off the forehead
lie torn and shredded on the floor.
The air of confidence of past women's fashion edi
tions, where the ladies sat down to the typewriters and
said that Stanford men would be wearing hats with
feathers in them this season is gone.
While the presses lie idle and the world waits ex
pectantly for the fashion decrees of the clorks in the
sotrs down town (men, men they're all alike) women
arc biting and clawing and swooning in The Daily office
over the length of women's skirts.
By squinting at the Zodiac, looking at Surrealist
Paintings, charting basal metabolisms, ogling at Wally
Simpson at Biarritz, eating their iron once a day,
smelling African Daisies and jungle lillies on the Sub
way, charting car loadings, the consumers goods and
the capital goods industries, the nitrogen cycle, the
world dictatorship of the proletariat and sit-down
strikes, the fashion dictators have scientifically deter
mined that skirts are to be shorter this year.
You would think that this would leave less material
for the women to argue about. But no. But definitely
no. You should see this fight as they sink their teeth
into each other and go whirling around the office. The
less there is to argue about, the more they argue
(women, women, they all read Esquire, too).
The immediate casus belli seems to be the overall
clearance frotat the floor that science will allow for
women's skirts.
"Slap, slap, take that, they're 14 inches off the
floor," say the conservatives.
"Ouch, ouch, you hussies," say the radicals through
clenched teeth, "they're not an inch less than 16."
Our Hasher peers out from behind his barricade, as
the little ladies pull up their skirts and measure with
rulers. But it doesn't do any good (the measuring, I
mean); the girls can't even agree on the slide rule.
As the fighting seems to reach an impasse, only hope
for compromise seems to rest with the noncommittal
lead: "With skirts rising slowly but steadily, hose this
spring is taking a decidedly new and interesting turn."
But I am mistaken. Battered and worn though they
may be, in the pit of despair there yet is that note of
confidence. I see a dismembered arm sticking out of
the wreckage. Clutched in the hand is a piece of copy
paper. On it is written: "High-waisted, pleated tux
trousers are being hard pushed by the Burma tan and
Dawn gray formals," and "Are tails here to stay? They
certainly are, or a great many Stanford men will be
disappointed when they push their full dress suits,
many of them new, to the rear of the closet to be eaten
by moths."
Get that, boys: "Many of them new."
Tell me frankly, arc we men or are we humming
birds?

may be, in the pit of despair there yet is that note of
confidence. I see a dismembered arm sticking out of
the wreckage. Clutched in the hand is a piece of copy
paper. On it is written: "High-waisted, pleated tux
trousers are being hard pushed by the Burma tan and
Dawn gray formals," and "Are tails here to stay? They
certainly are, or a great many Stanford men will be
disappointed when they push their full dress suits,
many of them new, to the rear of the closet to be eaten
by moths."
Get that, boys: "Many of them new."
Tell me frankly, arc we men or are we humming
birds?
AS I AM WRITING this, there is grave doubt that
the Daily's 8-page fashion edition will ever come
out. The woman fashion writers have thrown them
selves weeping on their typewriters, their distinctive
coiffures that should be rising back off the forehead
lie torn and shredded on the floor.
The air of confidence of past women's fashion edi
tions, where the ladies sat down to the typewriters and
said that Stanford men would be wearing hats with
feathers in them this season is gone.
While the presses lie idle and the world waits ex
pectantly for the fashion decrees of the clorks in the
sotrs down town (men, men they're all alike) women
arc biting and clawing and swooning in The Daily office
over the length of women's skirts.
By squinting at the Zodiac, looking at Surrealist
Paintings, charting basal metabolisms, ogling at Wally
Simpson at Biarritz, eating their iron once a day,
smelling African Daisies and jungle lillies on the Sub
way, charting car loadings, the consumers goods and
the capital goods industries, the nitrogen cycle, the
world dictatorship of the proletariat and sit-down
strikes, the fashion dictators have scientifically deter
mined that skirts are to be shorter this year.
You would think that this would leave less material
for the women to argue about. But no. But definitely
no. You should see this fight as they sink their teeth
into each other and go whirling around the office. The
less there is to argue about, the more they argue
(women, women, they all read Esquire, too).
The immediate casus belli seems to be the overall
clearance frotat the floor that science will allow for
women's skirts.
"Slap, slap, take that, they're 14 inches off the
floor," say the conservatives.
"Ouch, ouch, you hussies," say the radicals through
clenched teeth, "they're not an inch less than 16."
Our Hasher peers out from behind his barricade, as
the little ladies pull up their skirts and measure with
rulers. But it doesn't do any good (the measuring, I
mean); the girls can't even agree on the slide rule.
As the fighting seems to reach an impasse, only hope
for compromise seems to rest with the noncommittal
lead: "With skirts rising slowly but steadily, hose this
spring is taking a decidedly new and interesting turn."
But I am mistaken. Battered and worn though they
may be, in the pit of despair there yet is that note of
confidence. I see a dismembered arm sticking out of
the wreckage. Clutched in the hand is a piece of copy
paper. On it is written: "High-waisted, pleated tux
