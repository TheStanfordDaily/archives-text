# BULL SESSION
## PEOPLE, THEY ALL BEGIN TO SHOUT 
### 
A FTER having sold Frank O'Neill short for two or
three years, I hate to find myself in the same tub
with him, but at this point I am forced to compliment
the men with the funny little mustache for pulling what
is technically known as a fastie.

A little background history on the great coup d'etat
runs to the effect that the great conclave opened with
four scripts on the docket and a time limit of a half
hour or so for ihe reading of each. The first pair of
authors whipped through scenario and music well with
in the time limit and practically snagged the plum for
their efforts.
The second and fourth authors approached their
scripts with the reverence of a preacher approaching
the Bible. Both scripts hid behind a barrage of words,
words, words read in interminably by their authors.
The audience alternately yawned and rolled with
suppressed convulsions, which should smother the no
tion that dramatic societies choose their shows by con
sulting spiritually with their aesthetic sensibilities.
O'Neill, who drew by proxy preferential first place
in order of reading, arrived in time to read his affair
third. After the wrangle had adjourned from the
women"s clubhouse to the A.S.S.U. committee rooms,
the vote went for the O'Neill-Gordon "Down the
Hatch."

At this point the grousing commenced, and I see
by the papers that the Daily has chimed in. Beefs run
along several lines, a few chargeable to personal spite
and a few on artistic grounds but a lot more to the
fact that a couple of old slickers have stolen a march on
the youngsters.
The perfect answer to this argument is that both
O'Neill and Gordon *are technically students, but this
kind of preciseness is not in order at present. What is
more to the point is the fact that Barnstormers' first
show was almost entirely professionally written and
that there is no provision anywhere that future shows
arc to be student-written. Counting out those that
come to the Gaieties and the spring shows just to sec
how punk they can be, there has been no observed
movement of Stanford students to support lemons just
because such lemons have been produced by students
when there is better entertainment offered elsewher.

As for the idea that the competition should solicit
shows which are ''different," I recollect one scenario
read the other night as being consciously and self
consciously different. And as for Gordy Frost's edi
torial lament that Barnstormers are freezing out poten
tial Jerome Kerns—well, if the competition has been
advertised for four months with the total result of pro
ducing four scripts, it would seem that undiscovered
Jerome Kerns much prefer to hide out like witnesses
subpoenaed for San Francisco graft trials.
