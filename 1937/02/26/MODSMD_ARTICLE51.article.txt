The voice of one of the Heavenly
Host rang through San Francisco's
Opera House Wednesday night. Mar
ian Anderson, newly famous Negro
contralto, thrilled her audience with
a voice rich, flexible, mellow!
Miss Anderson, handsome and
well-groomed, devoted her concert
chiefly to German "lieder." Her first
group of songs included four works
of Handel. At the sound of her first
long low note the audience gasped,
for here was a voice such as music
lovers dream of. The lower register
had an exquisite mellowness which
the high notes could not be expected
to equal.
In the second group, consisting of
Schubert's songs, Miss Anderson's
voice warmed up, and in her rendi
tion of the famous "Ave Maria" the
upper register was technically flaw
less and possessed wonderful depth
of feeling. This was followed by the
dramatic aria "O Don Fatale" from
Verdi's "Don Carlos" and some "lie
der" by Sibelius. Her lowest notes
were so extremely delicate that it
was difficult to hear them.
The concert closed with four
thrilling negro spirituals.
