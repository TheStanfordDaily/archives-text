The Editor, Sir:
Now that edit-writer Gordy Frost
has made Barnstormers' selection of
a spring show script a matter of
public controversy, I feel that the
organization's stand should be made
cleax*.
By a close vote, Barnstormers
chose what they felt was the best
show, the one theatergoers would be
more likely to enjoy, the one that
semed more capable of upholding the
standard of the past two years. This
they felt was more desirable than
having a less satisfactory production
that had the supposed advantage of
being student-written.
This policy is open to attack and

adverse criticism wrong or right,!
has the right to be heard. As long as !
the Daily's criticism sticks to this!
line of attack it is legitimate.
Where the Daily erred, however, i
was in accepting the so-called "re
liable report" that "the four produc- j
tions were all pretty bad—no stand- '
outs, as fact, and criticizing Barn- I
stormers choice on this basis.
The scripts submitted were not j
pietty bad —many of them were;
excellent—and the organization felt!
that the Gordon-O'Neill script stood '
out sufficiently to merit its choice. I
Had it been a toss-up between the !
chosen script and its closest rival, the j
student-written show undoubtedly*
would have been chosen.

Criticize the policy of selection if
you want, but leave it to the Barn
stormers (with whom the responsi
oility of the show rests) to say
whether the .'hows are good or not,
and which is best.
