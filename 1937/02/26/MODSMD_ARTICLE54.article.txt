The Editor, Sir:
Two years ago Frank O'Neill felt
that there should be some opportu
nity for campus authors to see their
work in production. He organized
Barnstormers to fill that need in
sponsoring a spring musical each
year.
Frank O'Neill has graduated, and
gone to Hollywood to work for
M.O.M. He is a professional. He has
submitted a show again this year—
and Barnstormers has selected it.
In selecting that show Barnstorm
ers have disregarded the basis on
which the organization was founded
—namely, to give student writers a
chance.
11l presenting his show, O'Neill
staled that he wanted the campus
writers to be given preference, and
he was only submitting his in case
there were no shows really worthy
of presentation. No doubt it was up
to Barnstormers to make the final
decision, but O'Neill heard the other
shows read, and if he had really

wanted tu see the principle behind
Barnstormers carried out lie would
have withdrawn his show upon see
ing that the other shows were good
enough to be produced — the more
gentlemanly thing to do would have
been to withhold his show until it
was definitely known whether any
campus material was suitable.
li all Stanford graduates are to be
considered, we must be careful —
Maxwell Anderson might submit a
show—William Thornton might like
to act in one—and Helvenston might
come back to direct our student show
—we might even forget that students
are mixed up in the business at all.
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? But
that is only the present situation car
ried to its logical conclusion. Some
where a line must be drawn between
student written shows and profes
sionally written shows.
