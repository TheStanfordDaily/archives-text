# Bright Colors Featured In Spring Modes
## New Fashions Demand Festive Combinations With Unusual Contrast 
### 
Roses are red,
Violets are blue—
And, gals, if you want to mix those
colors in your spring wardrobe,
that's okeh too.
Because, if you aren't wearing an
aquamarine sweater with a yellow
.skirt and a lavender jigger coat by
the time spring really rolls around,
you're just not in style.
Beige Is Popular
Yet, strange as it may seem, the
outstanding shade for the season
will be beige which must be con
trasted with either black or navy
blue for street wear.
But for sport wear are the ever
present pastels, more subtle this
year and much more interesting.
The very new shades are very ex
citing. Thistle is really the shade of
that (lower—a combination of reds
and purples. St. James Rose, Coro
nation Gold, and York Grey are all
inspired by the crowning of George
VI next May, the former being a
:ovely pinkish shade which contrasts
very nicely with the new Postman
Blue. This last shade is almost
identical with the color of the post
man's uniform.
Copper Tone Subtle
Cornelian borders on the copper
ones, but is more subtle and an
.iqued like all the other tones.
Do you remember last year's Brit
sh Tan? This year it has assumed a
different tone and is reappearing
nder the title of Red Earth.
Oatmeal is a light tannish mix
ure of beige and grey, and two
■ ther new shades are Turtle Green,
nd Carmel. Watch for them.
Jackets Contrasted
Jackets and skirts must contrast,
or instance a bright plaid jacket
it h a plain skirt, but be sure that
le skirt has a plaid border around
ie bottom. This goes for formal
/ear too but the band must be wide
nd the jacket bolero.
Even the bathing suits are bright
< olored prints—sea shell and' star
sh. Especially white satin with
arge flowers and for play—a tiger
ilv patterned gabardine.
So the colors are bright, and twice
s unusual in their combinations. Do
nything you like with them this
ear as long as it's a contrast.
