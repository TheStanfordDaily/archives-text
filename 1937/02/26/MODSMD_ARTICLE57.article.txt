# Skirts Hit New High
## Milady Goes Feminine With Pastels, Frills Sheer Materials, Flares, Important New Trend In Wardrobe of Co-ed 
### 
With the return of prosperity,
skirts become shorter, so 'tis said —
but as yet the skirt length has not
reached the peak of 1929. Still 14
inches from the floor is short enough
to display any co-ed's trim legs.
As go the dress lengths so go the
coats —generally speaking the jigger
coat-finger tip length—is destined
for seasonal success. But if they
don't produce that suavely tailored
appearance that you seek, you may
wear a princess coat, fitted in the
back with a discreet flare and pleated
pockets which run into an unpressed
pleat below. Swaggers will not flare
as much as last year but will hang
gracefully from the shoulders.
Hats must not resemble the lean
ing tower of Pisa but will be flora
and fauna bedecked. The small
brimmed Breton Sailor will be good
and off the face.
Inspired by Parisian Suzy's invi
tation to the younger masculine ele
ment, "Suivez-moi, jeune homme,"
veils and ribbons will become beau
catchers streaming down the back of
milady's chapeau.
The day-time dress will emphasize
the skirt —the Dirndl Peasant type,
elaborately embroidered, appliqued
with flowers or fur, but they must
not flare as much as last season.
Subtlety will be the keynote.
Colors this year will be the usual
i bright pastels but with just enough
toning down to give them an an
tiqued appearance.
And for those warm spring days
on Lagunita or at the beach, bloom
ers are in style. Shorts are assum
ing greater length and even very
short skirts promise fair for tennis.
And so with the advent of the
spring season, milady turns distinct
ly feminine—sheer materials, full
skirts, and dressmaker details in
interesting buttons and pockets, or
a frilly blouse with the classical tai
lored suit, will make up the spring
wardrobe of any gay young thing
who must be up to the minute in
fashion.
