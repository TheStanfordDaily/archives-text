# Roughs Offer Free Advice On How Girls Should Dress
## 
### Marjorie Rosenblatt 
While their sisters in girls' col
leges revel in the comforts of dirty
shoes, ankle socks and a general ap
pearance described by one observant
male as a "rat race," it is a notori
ous fact that women in a co-educa
tional university dress to please the
men.
The co-eds dub their rivals
"frumps." The "frumps" thumb
their noses at the "primpers." And
both sides flatly deny the worst ac
cusations of the other.
Men Feign Indifference
Still, truth is truth and Stanford
is a co-educational college. For the
Farm co-ed the best guide to choos
ing clothes ought to be the answer
to THE question, what impression
do the clothes of the women make
upon the men.
Male opinion on the subject is hard
to get. The majority feign complete
indifference to what the co-ed wears
"as long as she looks all right."
One Rough made the point that
he would notice if "a doll snaked out
in a formal sauntered down the Quad
some bright morning." Or perhaps
even a "lassie in gingham" would
attract his roving eye, but the usual

sweaters and skirts made no impres
sion .
Dislike 'Cats'
One boy made an irrelevant but
thought-provoking criticism: "There
is one think I dislike. It's the way
girls criticize each other's clothes.
A girl walks into the Libe reading
room and immediately every pair of
feminine eyes gives her a scathing
once over from head to foot. No boy
does anything like that —at least—if
he does it's for some other reason."
Well, girls, a new light has been
thrown on the subject. Maybe when
you wore that yellow sweater to
your blue-Monday poli-sei lecture
you hoped to brighten the life of the
boy who sits beside you. But it
seems you were really preparing to
face fire under the gaze of the two
female puzzle fans on your left.
Now don't give up and concede to
the "frumps." The boys .may not ob
serve the means but they're still sus
ceptible to the effects.
