# Trimming Details Brighten Gloves
## 
### 
Trimming details are more inter
esting than ever on this year's
gloves. Leather thongs are used for
stitching on backs of gloves and
hand stitching details take many
new twists and turns to give variety
by making scrolls, lattice-work ef
fects, or diagonal lines that are
found to be more flattering than
the usual stitchings.
The narrow, fitted wrist is very
smart â€”elastic insertions, bands and
other trimming devices will help
keep the wristline snug. Gauntlet
type gloves will be worn with only
a few costumes.
