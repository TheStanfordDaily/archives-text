# Well Dressed Rough To Wear 'Balboa Blues'
## 
### 
Styles in clothes originate in Paris.
Encina doesn't think so. There is
a distinct movement there to ex
ploit something new, something ori
ginal, something that the hoi polloi
would call dungaree jumpers. Those
who are fostering the movement say
that they are "Balboa Blues."
"Balboa Blues" are just the thing
for the Stanford Rough, if there still
is a Stanford Rough. This is also
what the well-dressed skipper will
be wearing this summer when he
cruises around in his boat.
Woodie Miller, distributor for
"Balboa Blues," says they are sell
ing like hot-cakes. He is sorry to
report, though, that all the sales have
been in Encina. "It's fine to have
the movement start in Encina," he
says, "but it should spread around
the school more." He can't imagine
why they haven't, since some of them
have zippers all the way down the
front, and others only half way.
That should satisfy everyone. Be
sides they are blue and they do wear
for years.
