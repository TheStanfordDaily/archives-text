## 
### 
Gabardine will establish new high
: records for popularity with this new
| season. The demand will be mostly
I for browns, tan, olive tan, pale gray,
j and navy.
Many of thesa shades will be
j shown in patterns as well as the
original diagonal weave. Glens and
overplaids in two and even three
i color effects will not be a bit un
usual.

A now entree in the spring mode
is the short box coat, made on swag
ger lines. Made in knitted fabrics,
these are grand extra coats for print
frocks or knits. Some in mohair or
alpaca wool have the shaggy wool
surface that 1s both comfortable and
smart this vear.
