# Style Trends Again Favor Femininity
## New Peasant Costumes Introduced as Result Of Wally's Baltic Visit 
### 
Femininity is the fashion. All im
portant lines in dress and evening
clothes tend to make the women
feminine and beautiful.
Mannish tailored shirtwaists in
evening and afternoon dresses have
been replaced by flowers, in cor
sages, and in wide spread, colored
prints. Necklines are lower, accentu
ated with higher waistlines of the
Princess type, with bodices gathered
on in a full basque appearance.
Sleeves are short and full.

Two types of skirts are featured.
There is the Dirndl—the word is
Dalmatian for "young girl." This is
a copy «f the peasant costume —a
full skirt gathered directly to the
tight waistline. The influence of this
costume is due to Mrs. Simpson's
visit to the Dalmatian coast and to
the number of persons attending
pageants in Baltic countries, who
brought back original costumes.
Circular Skirt Good
Another type of full skirt is the
circular skirt, pleated narrowly at
the fitted waistline, the pleats be
coming deeper as they go down.
Some skirts are pencil line, to form
a contrast to the popular short bo
leros, which are the most outstand
ing for spring fashion use. These are
the Spanish bolero, fitted at the
back, and the free-hanging Mexican
typo.
Materials for evening dresses in
dicate the feminine mode—chiffon,
marquisette, and nets. The floating
fabrics tend to have full skirts, gath
ered, or accordion pleated. Waist
lines are treated in unique manners,
to give them fullness or manipula
tion of the fabric.
