# Coast Colleges, Big Ten Meet Seen
## 
### 
CHICAGO. Feb. 25 (U.R).â€”An all
star dual track meet between the Big
Ten and Pacific Coast conferences at
Los Angeles, June 2f>, was forecast
as a virtual certainty today by an
unofficial poll of Western conference
coaches.
So favorable was the immediate
reaction to the proposal that tenta
tive plans for staging the meet al
ready were being mapped out. If
the meet is a success, it was learned,
it probably will be established as an
annual fixture.
