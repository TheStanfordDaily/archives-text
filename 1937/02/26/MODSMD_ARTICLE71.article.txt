# Dame Fashion Cites 'Don'ts' for Women Short Shorts, High Hats Definitely Out
## 
### 
Dame Fashion has decreed several
"dont's" as well as "do's" this spring.
Among the modes dinged are:
Too short shorts—they're showing
them just above the knee. Horribly
overstuffed shoulders—they should
be just slightly boxed. 1 Those ter
rifically masculine lines—even in the
most sporty things. Slinky, slinky
evening things, especially with over
long trains. Tunics—the only ones
remaining are very, very modified.
Bathing Suit Skirts Out
Those modest little skirts on bath
ing suits—practically all the new
models are one-piece. Big revers —
they must be tiny or practically non
existant. Those high in front dresses,
especially evening dresses, necklines
are going down, down —never mind
where.
Cccktail - dinner - evening ensem
bles, born out of the depression de
sire to cram every possible social
function into one dress—formals are
now formals and dinner dresses are
dinner dresses and that is definitely
that.
Ilats Going Down
Little single strands of pearls—
wear six or seven at once, or don't
wear any at all — anemic-looking
jewels are out. Out also are all
those little hair ornaments which
blossomed last spring — this year's
motto is if you haven't something
really unusual to wear in your hair,
don't wear anything at all—gone also
are those terribly, terribly casual
coiffures—the new idea seems to be

to look neat, gracious, and formal.
Keep away from apricot stockings
and open-toed shoes for street wear.
While a few high crowns are still
smart, hats are going down—some
of them have no crowns at all, and
if you must wear one of those alpine
affairs don't let it jut off at some
crazy angle.

The above "dont's" apply to the
fashionable woman anywhere, but
the Stanford co-ed is faced with very
special problems which are accom
panied by very special "dont's." Out
on Quad don't wear:
Last year's pumps, well run over
at the heel; save your spikes for
dress and be comfortable during
classes.
Angle socks with gaudy bands;
they belong to active sports and Sat
urday mornings.
Hair-ribbons which exceed the

two-inch limit in any direction; they
may be feminine, but a bit frivolous
for tweeds.
Polo coats with depression length
hems; they should clear the ground
by a good twelve inches, or possibly
a little less in the case of the five
foot-two-er.
Gray stockings; Spring should be
welcomed with the new light colors.
Cracked nail enamel, as hands
should always be well-groomed and
appropriately, which means no deep
tones in the early morning.
In avoiding "don'ts," common sense
and good taste are almost infallible
guides.

be just slightly boxed. 1 Those ter
rifically masculine lines—even in the
most sporty things. Slinky, slinky
evening things, especially with over
long trains. Tunics—the only ones
remaining are very, very modified.
Bathing Suit Skirts Out
Those modest little skirts on bath
ing suits—practically all the new
models are one-piece. Big revers —
they must be tiny or practically non
existant. Those high in front dresses,
especially evening dresses, necklines
are going down, down —never mind
where.
Cccktail - dinner - evening ensem
bles, born out of the depression de
sire to cram every possible social
function into one dress—formals are
now formals and dinner dresses are
dinner dresses and that is definitely
that.
Ilats Going Down
Little single strands of pearls—
wear six or seven at once, or don't
wear any at all — anemic-looking
jewels are out. Out also are all
those little hair ornaments which
blossomed last spring — this year's
motto is if you haven't something
really unusual to wear in your hair,
don't wear anything at all—gone also
are those terribly, terribly casual
coiffures—the new idea seems to be

to look neat, gracious, and formal.
Keep away from apricot stockings
and open-toed shoes for street wear.
While a few high crowns are still
smart, hats are going down—some
of them have no crowns at all, and
if you must wear one of those alpine
affairs don't let it jut off at some
crazy angle.

The above "dont's" apply to the
fashionable woman anywhere, but
the Stanford co-ed is faced with very
special problems which are accom
panied by very special "dont's." Out
on Quad don't wear:
Last year's pumps, well run over
at the heel; save your spikes for
dress and be comfortable during
classes.
Angle socks with gaudy bands;
they belong to active sports and Sat
urday mornings.
Hair-ribbons which exceed the

two-inch limit in any direction; they
may be feminine, but a bit frivolous
for tweeds.
Polo coats with depression length
hems; they should clear the ground
by a good twelve inches, or possibly
a little less in the case of the five
foot-two-er.
Gray stockings; Spring should be
welcomed with the new light colors.
Cracked nail enamel, as hands
should always be well-groomed and
appropriately, which means no deep
tones in the early morning.
In avoiding "don'ts," common sense
and good taste are almost infallible
guides.

Dame Fashion has decreed several
"dont's" as well as "do's" this spring.
Among the modes dinged are:
Too short shorts—they're showing
them just above the knee. Horribly
overstuffed shoulders—they should
be just slightly boxed. 1 Those ter
rifically masculine lines—even in the
most sporty things. Slinky, slinky
evening things, especially with over
long trains. Tunics—the only ones
