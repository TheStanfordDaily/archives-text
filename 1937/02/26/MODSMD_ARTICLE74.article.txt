# Off With Old, On With New Is Beauty Hint For Easter
## Beauty Trends for Spring Revert to Naturalness 
### 
Spring is her-e! But looking in the
mirror is a source of disappointment
to many women these days. Some
thing is wrqng, but what and what
to do about it?
The first thing is to discard all the
creams, powder, rouges, lipsticks,
and even nail polish that you clung
to so religiously during the winter
months. Basic creams are different
for spring and summer, they are pro
tections from the sun instead of from
the wind and cold. Powders are
darker and take on sun tan shades,
rouges and lipsticks are lighter but
more daring, and nail polishes are
duller.
Naturalness Wins Out
A change in coiffure can do mir
acles to give a lift to the spirits. Re
member that a helter-skelter coiffure
in dark hair makes too much of a
contrast with the face, while blond
hair which tones in -with the skin
can be worn in softer arrangements.
Eyebrows are definitely in, no
more thin hairlike lines, but thick
and naturally curved.
Fingernails Are Plain
Bird-like talons are out, and plain
fingernails are back, a practical
length, oval shaped. Speaking of
polishes, very red nails require im
maculate grooming, and for the col
lege girl, non-transparent cream
polish serves as an excellent camou
flage for slight negligences. Inci
dentally, one of the manufacturers
of nail polish has just put a new
kind of plain polish on the market,
which looks better and wears in
finitely longer.
Figures usually need a little going
over for spring, and exercise is the
best way this can be done. Set aside
a certain amount of time each day,
little at first and gradually work up
to half an hour or more. Then do
them religiously and when bathing
suit times comes, there will be a
great improvement. Besides exer
cise indoors, walking is fine for the
figure and the morale.
