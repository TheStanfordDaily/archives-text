# Take Your Choice! Hats To Suit Taste
## 
### 
Hardly (wo hats are alike this year.
There are low crowns, high crowns,
brims, not brims, veils, feathers, and
anything goes!
Spanish hats reach the fore, with
matador toques, gaucho sombreros,
mantilla effects, and tambourine ef
fects. Next in favor are the wide
brims, so reminiscent of liubens.
Magi turbans, pill-boxes, flower
pots, peaked fools' caps all find their
way into favor.
Dazzling colors are popular, among
them, saffron, red, green, purple and
brilliant blue. In trimming cox
combs, flowers, glass stars, Paisley
prints and peasant embroidery hold
forth.
