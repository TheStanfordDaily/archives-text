# TWO PRINT CONTRAST
## 
### 
Twin prints in two different fab
rics are partly fashion news. The
emphasized use of the bolero pre
sents many opportunities for this
charming "matched contrast."
Even bodices and skirts may be of
different fabrics in the same print.
Rayon pique is very chic for sum
mer formals.
