# Jewel-Studded Belt Importance Grows
## 
### 
Belts are tremendously important
in the spring costume picture, say
French designers. And they sprinkle
them with jewels in all bright col
ors, to give them a costume jewelry
look.
They are striking on plain frocks,
and may match jewel-studded hand
bags, or harmonize with other cos
tume jewelry. With coronation in
fluences so strong, much is expected
of belts and bracelets, clips and other
jeweled accessories to carry out the
iuxury.mode this year.
