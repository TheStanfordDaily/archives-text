# Air Factory Sitdowners Leave Plant
## Strikers Evacuate Shop; Drop Threats To Blow Up $24,000,000 Planes 
### 
SANT AMONICA, Feb. 25 (UP).—
Six hundred sit-down strikers evac
uated the Douglas Aircraft Corpo
ration plant late today as an army
of peace officers was prepared to
storm the factory with tear gas.
Threats to "blow up" the plant
with its $24,000,000 worth of un
finished government and commer
cial planes yielded to persuasion
when the National Labor Relations
Board regional director, Dr. Towne
J. Nylander, made a personal ap
peal to the self-imprisoned workers.
The men, heeding Nylander's
pleas, began to file out of the plant*
which they had held more than 48
hours.
Men Submit Quietly
Four hundred of their number
.submitted quietly to arrest on "John
Doe" warrants, charging them with
"forcible entry and detainer." The
rest, who had gone into the plant as
reinforcements, were allowed their
liberty.
Grim-faced sheriff's deputies, po
lice and district attorney's agents,
who had been waiting for more than
two hours to storm the factory with
tear gas and clubs, mopped their
brows in relief as the men filed out
in orderly fashion.
Spokesmen for the sit - downers
had announced an hour earlier that
the men would set fire to a govern
ment plane and destroy the entire
plant rather than submit to arrest
without the promise of release on
their own recognizance. To these
terms, District Attorney Buron Fitts
had demanded "unconditional sur
render" of the entire force.
Plead with Workers
Nylander, aided by Sheriff Eu
gene Biscailuz, pleaded long and
eloquently before they were able to
break down the workers' determina
tion to hold the factory at any cost.
After more than an hour of listen
ing, the sit-downers conferred with
iheir leaders and agreed to surren
der.
Four doors to the big plant were
thrown open and the sit-downers
streamed out, many of the mlaugh
ing.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25 (U.R).—
Additional labor troubles engulfed
the Douglas Aircraft Corporation to
night when 100 plant employees of
the Northrop Aviation Corporation,
a subsidiary, refused to leave the
factory, declaring they were en
gaged in a sit-down strike.
At the same time, 175 employees of
the Kelley & Wells Machine Co.,
which supplies materials to the
Santa Monica airplane builders,
walked out on a "sympathy strike."
Leaders said they would remain out
until demands of Douglas workers
were met. They said they had no
demands of their own and that their
action was "purely sympathetic."

DOUGLAS SUBSIDIARY
WORKERS SIT DOWN
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25 (U.R).—
Additional labor troubles engulfed
the Douglas Aircraft Corporation to
night when 100 plant employees of
the Northrop Aviation Corporation,
a subsidiary, refused to leave the
factory, declaring they were en
gaged in a sit-down strike.
At the same time, 175 employees of
the Kelley & Wells Machine Co.,
which supplies materials to the
Santa Monica airplane builders,
walked out on a "sympathy strike."
Leaders said they would remain out
until demands of Douglas workers
were met. They said they had no
demands of their own and that their
action was "purely sympathetic."
SANT AMONICA, Feb. 25 (UP).—
Six hundred sit-down strikers evac
uated the Douglas Aircraft Corpo
ration plant late today as an army
of peace officers was prepared to
storm the factory with tear gas.
Threats to "blow up" the plant
with its $24,000,000 worth of un
finished government and commer
cial planes yielded to persuasion
when the National Labor Relations
Board regional director, Dr. Towne
J. Nylander, made a personal ap
peal to the self-imprisoned workers.
The men, heeding Nylander's
pleas, began to file out of the plant*
which they had held more than 48
hours.
Men Submit Quietly
Four hundred of their number
.submitted quietly to arrest on "John
Doe" warrants, charging them with
"forcible entry and detainer." The
rest, who had gone into the plant as
reinforcements, were allowed their
liberty.
Grim-faced sheriff's deputies, po
lice and district attorney's agents,
who had been waiting for more than
two hours to storm the factory with
tear gas and clubs, mopped their
brows in relief as the men filed out
in orderly fashion.
Spokesmen for the sit - downers
had announced an hour earlier that
the men would set fire to a govern
ment plane and destroy the entire
plant rather than submit to arrest
without the promise of release on
their own recognizance. To these
terms, District Attorney Buron Fitts
had demanded "unconditional sur
render" of the entire force.
Plead with Workers
Nylander, aided by Sheriff Eu
gene Biscailuz, pleaded long and
eloquently before they were able to
break down the workers' determina
tion to hold the factory at any cost.
After more than an hour of listen
ing, the sit-downers conferred with
iheir leaders and agreed to surren
der.
Four doors to the big plant were
thrown open and the sit-downers
streamed out, many of the mlaugh
ing.
