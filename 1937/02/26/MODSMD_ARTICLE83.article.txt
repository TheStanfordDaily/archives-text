# Cords, Gabardines For Trouser Wear
## 
### 
Trousers for the coming warmer
seasons will consist principally of
plain colored whip cords and gabar
dines. Plain Bedford cords also look
well.
In pattern pants, Glen Erquehart
*re by far the best of the pat
tern trousers, although stripes still
show some demand. Houndstooth
checks are still having some call.
Velvet or wool jackets are being
worn nvcr printed silks, with smart
effects. » ig ■MlEl
