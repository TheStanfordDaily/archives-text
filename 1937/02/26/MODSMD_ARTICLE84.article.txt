# Top Hat, Tails Gain in Favor
## Stanford Roughs Follow Eastern Fashion Lead 
### 
Are tails here to stay? They cer- |
tainly are, or a great many Stanford ■
men will be disappointed when they
push their full dress suits, many of !
them new, to the rear of the closet I
to be eaten by moths.
Tails made their first real appear
ance last year when our Eastern
brethren appeared at Midwinters I
and other San Francisco dances in j
the evening clothes they were used
to wearing back home, full dress j
suits. Dinner suits —Easterners never j
call them "tuxes"—are worn at stag
parties and mixed dinners, seldom at ;
dances.
Roughs Experiment
This year Westerners wondered
how they would look in white ties, i
and many experimented in the field.
Full dress suits were suddenly in I
evidence at formal affairs in Losj
Angeles and San Francisco, and now
they are finding their way into cam
pus dances. It is expected that all
campus "whites" will be donned for
the Sophomore Cotillion Match 5.
Gentlemen of the Farm like many
features of the tail coat, high pleated t
trousers, and white accessories—the
white tie, vest, silk handkerchief, 1
and studs.
Full Dress Comfortable
Despite the added expense of an
extra suit, extra accessories, and in- j
creased cleaning bills, men realize
that they are more handsome in tails
—and after all, we only wear formal
clothes for looks.
Full dress suits are much more
comfortable because the trousers
come halfway up on the "iron" short
and keep it from bulging, and not i
many lessons are needed to learn
how to walk, dance, and sit in tails, i
Top Hat, White Gloves
Since evening styles have in the ;
past been copied from Pittsburgh,
New York, Boston, and Philadel
phia, we have reason to believe that
this system wil continue. Top hats
are seen occasionally; white gloves
(worn on the dance floor as well as !
out-of-doors) and Chesterfield over
coats wiH probably appear in time, j
And the next guess for the future
is that full drtess suits and dinner
suits—even Westerners may forget
the more vulgar terms—will some
time be proper or improper on spe
cific occasions. At a particular eve
ning affair all men will be dressed
alike.

push their full dress suits, many of !
them new, to the rear of the closet I
to be eaten by moths.
Tails made their first real appear
ance last year when our Eastern
brethren appeared at Midwinters I
and other San Francisco dances in j
the evening clothes they were used
to wearing back home, full dress j
suits. Dinner suits —Easterners never j
call them "tuxes"—are worn at stag
parties and mixed dinners, seldom at ;
dances.
Roughs Experiment
This year Westerners wondered
how they would look in white ties, i
and many experimented in the field.
Full dress suits were suddenly in I
evidence at formal affairs in Losj
Angeles and San Francisco, and now
they are finding their way into cam
pus dances. It is expected that all
campus "whites" will be donned for
the Sophomore Cotillion Match 5.
Gentlemen of the Farm like many
features of the tail coat, high pleated t
trousers, and white accessories—the
white tie, vest, silk handkerchief, 1
and studs.
Full Dress Comfortable
Despite the added expense of an
extra suit, extra accessories, and in- j
creased cleaning bills, men realize
that they are more handsome in tails
—and after all, we only wear formal
clothes for looks.
Full dress suits are much more
comfortable because the trousers
come halfway up on the "iron" short
and keep it from bulging, and not i
many lessons are needed to learn
how to walk, dance, and sit in tails, i
Top Hat, White Gloves
Since evening styles have in the ;
past been copied from Pittsburgh,
New York, Boston, and Philadel
phia, we have reason to believe that
this system wil continue. Top hats
are seen occasionally; white gloves
(worn on the dance floor as well as !
out-of-doors) and Chesterfield over
coats wiH probably appear in time, j
And the next guess for the future
is that full drtess suits and dinner
suits—even Westerners may forget
the more vulgar terms—will some
time be proper or improper on spe
cific occasions. At a particular eve
ning affair all men will be dressed
alike.
