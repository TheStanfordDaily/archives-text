# Tuxes, Sport Dawn Gray, Burma Tan Spring Coats
## 
### 
Advance formal fashions from
sunnier and warmer southern cli
mates indictate that the Stanford
man who wants to be well-dressed
will have to buy a few more nick
nacks and accessories for his de
pleted wardrobe.
Men may breathe easy for winter
formal wear is conventional, but
spring and summer will bring two
new colors—Burma tan and Dawn
gray.
Tails Popular
Midnight - blue, double - breasted
coats with high pleats and waists
form the nucleus of the conventional
winter formal. The coats will have
grosgraine faced lapels, with some
tendency in the West toward tails.
The accessories are regulation: mid
night-blue bow tie and either mid
night-blue or smoke pearl studs and
lengths.
But Florida fashions show that the
conventional white, double-breasted
coats with shawl collar and high
waisted, pleated tux trousers are be
ing hard pushed by the Burma tan
and Dawn gray formals.
Shawl-Collared Coats
Local stylists predict a dominance
of double - breasted, shawl - collared
coats and black palm beach tux pants
with pleats and a very high waist.
Those who intend to wear dinner
jackets again this year will be in a
minority on the coast.
Burma tan coats will be completed
with a forest green bow tie with
similar studs and lengths. The dawn
gray formal coat wearer will prob
ably be impressed with a maroon tie
and extras. Meanwhile the white
standbys will use smoked pearl or
black enamel studs and lengths with
a black bow.
Self-Tied Bows Best
The bravest boys will be sur
rounded by a "Commerbund," mean
ing shawl in English, although they
won't show well through a double
breast.
Wing collars and flat collars will
both be stylishly correct as will

either the old stand-by stiff front or
the more recent pleated shirt. Bow
ties may be cither ready-made or
self-tied, although the latter looks
better if properly tied.
To Have Lapel Holes
To top the well-dressed formal
man off with a bang, the creators
have included holes in the lapels,
and seem to expect those who fol
low the trends to wear flowers to
match their accessories.
Rough finish shoes with plain tops
are back again, whereas the vogue
for patent leather is on the down
grade. A midnight blue or dark gray
Homburg style hat is preferred.
Derbies are fast losing their popu
larity.
All in all, it should be a boom sea
son for pretty men.

ties may be cither ready-made or
self-tied, although the latter looks
better if properly tied.
To Have Lapel Holes
To top the well-dressed formal
man off with a bang, the creators
have included holes in the lapels,
and seem to expect those who fol
low the trends to wear flowers to
match their accessories.
Rough finish shoes with plain tops
are back again, whereas the vogue
for patent leather is on the down
grade. A midnight blue or dark gray
Homburg style hat is preferred.
Derbies are fast losing their popu
larity.
All in all, it should be a boom sea
son for pretty men.

Advance formal fashions from
sunnier and warmer southern cli
mates indictate that the Stanford
man who wants to be well-dressed
will have to buy a few more nick
nacks and accessories for his de
pleted wardrobe.
Men may breathe easy for winter
formal wear is conventional, but
spring and summer will bring two
new colors—Burma tan and Dawn
gray.
Tails Popular
Midnight - blue, double - breasted
coats with high pleats and waists
form the nucleus of the conventional
winter formal. The coats will have
grosgraine faced lapels, with some
tendency in the West toward tails.
The accessories are regulation: mid
night-blue bow tie and either mid
night-blue or smoke pearl studs and
lengths.
But Florida fashions show that the
conventional white, double-breasted
coats with shawl collar and high
waisted, pleated tux trousers are be
ing hard pushed by the Burma tan
and Dawn gray formals.
Shawl-Collared Coats
Local stylists predict a dominance
of double - breasted, shawl - collared
coats and black palm beach tux pants
with pleats and a very high waist.
Those who intend to wear dinner
jackets again this year will be in a
minority on the coast.
Burma tan coats will be completed
with a forest green bow tie with
similar studs and lengths. The dawn
gray formal coat wearer will prob
ably be impressed with a maroon tie
and extras. Meanwhile the white
standbys will use smoked pearl or
black enamel studs and lengths with
a black bow.
Self-Tied Bows Best
The bravest boys will be sur
rounded by a "Commerbund," mean
ing shawl in English, although they
won't show well through a double
breast.
Wing collars and flat collars will
both be stylishly correct as will

either the old stand-by stiff front or
the more recent pleated shirt. Bow
ties may be cither ready-made or
self-tied, although the latter looks
better if properly tied.
