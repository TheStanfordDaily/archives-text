# Pipes Popular Indian Smoke
## Stanford Stogie Addicts Fall Far in Minority 
### 
The Stanford rough may be disap
pearing and the Joe College type
returned to high school, but the one
common characteristic of the two,
the pipe, remains on the Farm.
Estimates place the number of
campus pipe-smokers on a half-and
half basis with the cigarette smokers;
in figures this amounts to about 100U
Indians who traditionally keep peace
with a pipe. Although definitely in
the minority, the number of women
who qualify as pipe-addicts is sur
prisingly large; nor is the feminist
movement particularly new. Local
smoke - shops confess to having
served female clients for quite
some lime.
Stanford men (and women) buy
good pipes—nothing but the best—
and there is little fooling around
with the cheaper base - burners.
Though the trend in pipe styles
from year to year is easy to predict—
most smokers buy straight-stemmed ,

pipes—taste in tobacco varies. No
one brand of tobacco can claim Ihe
most popularity, and many pipe
sters choose to blend standard prod
ucts to fit individual preferences.
Fighting neck and neck with, the
pipe is the cigarette. Capitalistic
leanings of Farm residents are
shown by the number of stogies pur
chased, no small quantity. The pop
ularity of the cigar, however, can
not compare with that of the pipe
or cigarette.
