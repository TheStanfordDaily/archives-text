# Little Change In Sport Wear Seen for Men
## Swim Trunks of Bright Gabardine Worn On Tennis Courts, Lake 
### 
Swim trunks this year are brighter
J than ever and "uppers" are definitely j
! out, except in fashionable East Coast
j resorts. Gabardine is more popular
i now than knit, for trunks made of ■
| this material can be worn for tennis (
i as well as swimming, and they come
j in white with a black stripe down
; the side. Beach sandals are no longer
"sissy," for they are now big, heavy, j
and made of wood, and are called ;
"hurraccas." Bath-robes are of
terry cloth and fowling, which ab- !
sorbs the moisture quickly and can j
be put on straight after coming out
of the water.
Although Esquire features plus
fours for golf, slacks and polo shirts
are still favorites, especially here on
, the Stanford course. For tennis, the (
i gabardine shorts, polo shirts, and I
ducks are always worn. Polo |
j shirts, sweaters, and breeches, with
i perhaps a colored silk neckerchief, i
! for riding. In all sport clothcs the |
i trend is toward very brilliant colors, j
Those going to Yosemite over the i
week-end for skiing will wear blue
'serge, snow proof trousers which
reach just below the knee now, in-
I stead of to the ankle. Bright fancy
I sox cover the calves, and short Nor- i
; wegian ones cover the ankle. Over
a plaid wool shirt a jacket of canvas
1 or airplane cloth, and a Melton cloth
cap with ear-muffs to complete the j
, outfit. But don't forget the long, red,
woolen drawers which go on first. ;
I Gray felt Tyrolean hats, with col- 1
| ored feathers, lend a Swiss atmos
phere to the skiing.
