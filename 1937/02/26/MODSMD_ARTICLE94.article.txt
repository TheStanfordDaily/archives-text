# DAISIES SPOT GOWNS
## 
### 
Daisies sprinkled over evening
gowns are new and fresh as spring
itself. Delia Lind has chosen a black
linen gown embroidered with tiny
white daisies. Large yellow ones are
appliqued on a smart black chiffon
model.

If you're tired of flowers and clips
in your hair try butterflies made of
feathers, a Schiaparelli inspiration.
