# Spring Trend Decrees Two Silhouettes
## Princess Lines for Night Classic Styles on Street Dominate New Fashions 
### 
There are two basic silhouettes for
.spring: the straight, classic lines for
sports and street, to be worn with
swagger, box, and the new "jigger"
coats, and the long fitted princess
form, with flared skirt, for evening.
The general tendency is for soft
er, more feminine lines for every
thing. Skirts arc flared, but less
so than last year, with the main
fullness coming toward the bot
tom to get away from bulkiness.
Hemlines arc definitely up, but
they should be adjusted to the in
dividual. No matter what your
legs are, you can't have them be
low 12 inches and be smart.
The dirndl silhouette should be
mentioned. Just, at present it is en
joying an enormous popularity, but
buyers in the better stores are al
most unanimous in the opinion that
it v/on't last. It is too awkward and
V) 111 ky around the hips to give that
sleek, sophisticated dressed-up look.
At best it takes youth and a perfect
figure, particularly plenty of height.
Small stocky girls should shy off. It
is best adapted to the beach cos
tume, and tricky sport outfits.
With the formal afternoon cos
tume, the ballerina coat should be
worn, fitted, princess waist, full
length and flared at the bottom.
Straight lines arc in for more for
mal wear in little dressy crepe and
sheer wool suits with lingerie
touches.
Evening clothes arc going the
length in femininity with yards of
floating draperies and full, full, full
skirts. The waistlines, however, will
be high and fitted. One interesting
variation of the formal mode is the
fitted underslip of stiff material, with
a wide skirt, usually slit down the
front to give a redingote effect.
