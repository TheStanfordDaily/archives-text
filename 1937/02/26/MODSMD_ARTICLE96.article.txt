# Pastel Shirts Newest of New
## Matching Swing – skirts, Sweaters Important 
### 
The newest of the new for campus
sports are pastel sweat shirts, made
just like a man's, in white, pale blue,
and yellow. Then there are match
ing outfits of pastel swing skirts with
white belts and little soft sweaters.
These come in the new high shades
—turquoise, Coronado blue, Riviera
rose, and sun gold.
With these outfits can be worn the
liberty scarfs — large silk squares
made in England, and printed with
clever designs, many of them in the
nautical vogue.
Beige Jaeger woolen suits with
slipover sweaters and sleeveless car
digans to match are very good. A
bright spring mode is in the new
Tyrolean print blouses, very bright,
of light materials.
Several swagger coats are being
shown with fur collars of soft blue
and gray fox, or of wolf. The ma
jority of swaggers, however, arc
plain, but in high colors. Especially
good arc the jigger length coats, in
coronation blue, sun rose, good earth,
nude, and sungold shades.
Other new shades are red earth,
and thistle combined with navy.
Thistle is the true shade of the plant
—between a lavender and an old
rose, and is a very delicate shade
for spring.
