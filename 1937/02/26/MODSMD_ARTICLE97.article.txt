Grey, beige, navy, or blackâ€”what
evcry your spring outfit may be, the
accessories are very important. With
a grey coat, why not wear a brilliant
red silk dress simply made, a black
straw hat trimmed in white, black
purse and shoes, and red suede
gloves, and at your throat a bunch
of white daisies with yellow centers.
Beige may be set oIT with a black
sash, black bag, shoes, and gloves
which arc embroidered and a neu
tral straw hat. Navy is eternally
fresh, especially if you combine it
with a green print dress, navy straw
hat trimmed in white, navy shoes
and bag, white gloves, and a butter
cup corsage at the throat.
And black is important for every
season. Wear it with a pirik blouse,
a black turban, gloves in coral, black
gabardine shoes, a black purse, a
triple strand of pink pearls, and a
large pink carnation.
