# Coronation Colors Crimson and Blue
## 
### 
The coronation on May 12 has
cast a tremendous influence on the
styling of men's clothing and acces
sories. The official colors of red and
blue, chosen for the coronation of
Edward VIII, have been retained for
the ascension of George VI.
The colors, which arc lighter,
brighter, and more cheerful than the
usual tones, will be featured in every
phase of the gentleman's wardrobe
from suits to sox.
