# Paul de Kruif Praises Farm Polio Studies
## Communal Medicine Must Supplant Small Doctor, Noted Author Declares 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Only when the United States has
become completely socialized will
socialized medicine be a success, pre
dicted Paul de Kruif, author of many
books, including "Microbe Hunters,"
who visited the Stanford campus
yesterday.
"Any consideration of private profit
is an infamy, in the matter of the
relief of suffering and prevention of
disease," declared the tall, burly
Dutchman earnestly. "The present
status of the doctor as a little capital
ist may be effective for coughs and
headaches, but it can never prove
satisfactory against such highly con
tagious diseases as syphilis and
tuberculosis."
Lauds Stanford's Work
Secretary of President Roosevelt's
Commission for Infantile Paralysis
Research, Dr. de Kruif lauded the
work of Stanford biologists toward
the prevention of poliomyelitis. Out
of 14 universities working on the
various aspects of polio prevention,
he termed Stanford's experimental
work on monkeys "the most likely
to be applied immediately."
Stanford Professors E. W. Schultz
and L. P. Gebhardt applied a treat
ment to monkeys that was 95 per cent
effective in preventing the disease.
There is a possibility, however, that
it will not work on human beings,
Dr. de Kruif explained.
Wants T.B. Drive
At present, Dr. de Kruif is hoping
that Detroit's recently inaugurated
drive against tuberculosis can be
organized on a national scale. He
declared that, with a corps of trained
specialists, the "disease could be re
duced to the vanishing point within
a generation" by placing cases un
der treatment at an early stage to
prevent spread of the disease.
Detroit's campaign, described in
Dr. de Kruif's "Why Keep Them
Alive," had for its slogan "It costs
lis money to die." It was based
on the fact that expensive preventive
measures will save money in the
long run.
Wants Syphilis Control
Dr. de Kruif is in accord with
California's desire to stamp out
syphilis, as evidenced by the ven
ereal diseases bill to be considered
soon by the state legislature. He was
active in development of syphilis
control treatments, having con
tributed to the present "artificial
fever" method of killing the syphilis
organism. He suggested that short
wave therapy be applied instead of
the previous method of injecting the
malaria parasite.
General Motors' Kettering Hypo
therm is the machine now being in
troduced. It heats the body with a
draft of hot, moist air. Chief ad
vantage over the arsenic and bis
muth treatment is that it takes a
much shorter time and requires
smaller doses of the drugs.
Cancer Drop Possible
With reference to cancer, Dr. de
Kruif explained that it is essential
to develop a corps of experts to
attack the disease on a national
scale. In this way the number of
cases could be reduced by one third,
since early treatment is imperative.
As for the name of this "H. G.
Wells of public health," it is pro
nounced to rhyme almost with
"strife," although Dr. de Kruigh
gives it something of a "krawf" tinge.

various aspects of polio prevention,
he termed Stanford's experimental
work on monkeys "the most likely
to be applied immediately."
Stanford Professors E. W. Schultz
and L. P. Gebhardt applied a treat
ment to monkeys that was 95 per cent
effective in preventing the disease.
There is a possibility, however, that
it will not work on human beings,
Dr. de Kruif explained.
Wants T.B. Drive
At present, Dr. de Kruif is hoping
that Detroit's recently inaugurated
drive against tuberculosis can be
organized on a national scale. He
declared that, with a corps of trained
specialists, the "disease could be re
duced to the vanishing point within
a generation" by placing cases un
der treatment at an early stage to
prevent spread of the disease.
Detroit's campaign, described in
Dr. de Kruif's "Why Keep Them
Alive," had for its slogan "It costs
lis money to die." It was based
on the fact that expensive preventive
measures will save money in the
long run.
Wants Syphilis Control
Dr. de Kruif is in accord with
California's desire to stamp out
syphilis, as evidenced by the ven
ereal diseases bill to be considered
soon by the state legislature. He was
active in development of syphilis
control treatments, having con
tributed to the present "artificial
fever" method of killing the syphilis
organism. He suggested that short
wave therapy be applied instead of
the previous method of injecting the
malaria parasite.
General Motors' Kettering Hypo
therm is the machine now being in
troduced. It heats the body with a
draft of hot, moist air. Chief ad
vantage over the arsenic and bis
muth treatment is that it takes a
much shorter time and requires
smaller doses of the drugs.
Cancer Drop Possible
With reference to cancer, Dr. de
Kruif explained that it is essential
to develop a corps of experts to
attack the disease on a national
scale. In this way the number of
cases could be reduced by one third,
since early treatment is imperative.
As for the name of this "H. G.
Wells of public health," it is pro
nounced to rhyme almost with
"strife," although Dr. de Kruigh
gives it something of a "krawf" tinge.
Only when the United States has
become completely socialized will
socialized medicine be a success, pre
dicted Paul de Kruif, author of many
books, including "Microbe Hunters,"
who visited the Stanford campus
yesterday.
"Any consideration of private profit
is an infamy, in the matter of the
relief of suffering and prevention of
disease," declared the tall, burly
Dutchman earnestly. "The present
status of the doctor as a little capital
ist may be effective for coughs and
headaches, but it can never prove
satisfactory against such highly con
tagious diseases as syphilis and
tuberculosis."
Lauds Stanford's Work
Secretary of President Roosevelt's
Commission for Infantile Paralysis
Research, Dr. de Kruif lauded the
work of Stanford biologists toward
the prevention of poliomyelitis. Out
of 14 universities working on the
various aspects of polio prevention,
he termed Stanford's experimental
work on monkeys "the most likely
to be applied immediately."
