NE WYORK. Feb. 28 (UP). —All 20 of the men who have written to
Mitzi Mayfair, 20-year-old dancer, asking Her to marry them, met today at
a party and were introduced to the girl of their dreams.
It was terriffic.
"Tea was served. Hardly any sugar was put into the tea because the
conversation sweetened everything.
For this momentous occasion—this mass assault upon her heart—Miss
Mayfair put on a black crepe dress set off by hand blocked flowers, a pair

of patent leather pumps and a
sweet smile.
"Now don't be frightened," Mitzi
told the boys. "I'm just as shy as
you are."
So up stepped Leonard Kalinger,
baseball player and swimmer, and
bowed low over Miss Mayfair's
hand. Very gallant.
Next was Alton Roberts, a hockey
player (athletes go for the gal in a
big way, it seems), and he turned
out to be a chivalrous guy with a
swell smile. Miss Mayfair beamed.
On and on they came —each one
turning on the ol' personality in an
attempt to sweep Mitzi off her feet.
James Morriso said he worked for
the New York visitors' committeej
and Miss Mayfair said, "Really, how j
nice."
Bert Rivere, an insurance man
from Pittsburgh, got a wink from
Mitzi because he was a long way I
from home. There was a man named
Adrian Weinmann, who said he was
an author and a student.
When the line had filed past every
body stood around not knowing ex
actly what to do next.
"We had a hard time breaking the
ice," Mitzi's press agent said later,
i but it finally was done by pouring
| tea. Everybody drank tea and then
| somebody asked what Miss Mayfair
j considered to be the prime qualifica
j tion for a husband.
"Not money," she said. "A sense
j of humor."
Franklin Von Doran, one of the
'swains, promptly displayed a sense I

of humor by suggesting that the 20
gentlemen form a club to meet every
February 28 from now until they all
died or Mitzi got married.
"How nice," Mitzi said.
Pretty soon everybody went home
without any marriage proposals be
ing made and the only person left
was a girl named Ruth who kept
telling all the reporters to "be sure
to mention Essex House," where the
party was held.
