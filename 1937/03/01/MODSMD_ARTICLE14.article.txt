### 
"The Reason for Public Worship"
was the topic of Dr. Trueblood's ser
mon yesterday morning in the Me
morial Church when special order of
service was held as a rededication of
the organ.
The chaplain pointed out that we
are facing a serious danger in the
decline of public worship. Formerly
in most communities everyone con
sidered it necessary to attend public
services of worship at least once a
w?ek, while now that feeling no
longer exists.
However, those who do not attend
church are not necessarily any less
Christian, since there is high religion
outside the churches and irreligion
in the churches.
