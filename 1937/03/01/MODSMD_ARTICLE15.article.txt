# Farm Research Hints at Life from Stars

### PHIL BERNHEIM 
That life could have come to the
earth from another planet has been
indicated by the research of a Stan
ford University professor.
Single-celled marine eggs have
gone through all the extreme condi
tions of cold and vacuum necessary
to a journey through space and
emerged alive in the laboratory of
Dr. Charles V. Taylor, Stanford
biologist.
Freezes Eggs
Dr. Taylor causes the eggs to en- |
cyst—to form a hard shell around
themselves—then puts them through '
such extreme treatments as plunging
them into liquid air at a tempera- |
ture of —400 degrees Fahrenheit,
only 60 degrees above absolute zero,
for 12*. days. They survive.
He puts them in a specially de
signed centrifuge, of which there are

only two in the United States, which
whirls them around at unbelievable
speeds until centrifugal force pushes
on them with a pressure of 360,000
time gravity, and they survive. The
human body can only withstand
pressures 10 times gravity.
He puts them in vacuums of
.000001 millimeters of mercury, and
they survive. Normal air pressure is
760 millimeters, yet some of his eggs
have lived in intense vacuum since
July, 1931.
Suggests Meteorite
All of these conditions are more
[ extreme than a cyst would he sub
j jected to in traveling through space
I from one planet to another on, say,
! a meteorite. Hence, says Dr. Taylor,
single-celled life may have arrived
on this planet from another in an
encysted state, then, under the in
fluence of normal conditions on
earth) excysted or dissolved its pro-

I tective coating.
But Dr. Taylor's work may have
more practical results in X-ray
| technique, the treatment of amoebic
j dysentery, and increasing the fer
! tility of land.
X-rays Deadly
In subjecting his eggs to X-rays,
Dr. Taylor tested the effect of the
rays on the culture medium in which
the eggs are kept. He found that
| putting the eggs in the medium after
| it alone had been exposed to the
j rays was just as deadly as exposing
the eggs directly to the rays.
He came to the conclusion that X
rays produce hydrogen peroxide, a
poison, in anything which contains
water and oxygen. "It appears rea
sonable to suppose," Dr. Taylor
says, "that the toxic or lethal action
of X-rays on living cells may be due
in part, and perhaps quite consider
ably, to the production of hydrogen

peroxide within the cells them
selves." This may help to explain
why over-exposure to X-rays is
dangerous 1o human beings.
May Help Doctors
The amoeba of dysentery enters
human beings in an encysted state.
Dr. Taylor's study of the factors af
fecting encystment and excystment
may prove helpful to the medical
profession in their treatment of the
disease.
Possible application of Dr. Taylor's
researches in agriculture is seen in
the fact that certain organisms in the
soil encyst when subjected to chills,
as in winter. These organisms later
excyst and feed upon the bactcria
which make soil fertile. Dr. Taylor's
study of the effect of temperature on 1
encystment and excystment may
lead to control of these organisms,
hence more fertile land for the
• farmer.
