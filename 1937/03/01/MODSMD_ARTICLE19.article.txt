# Farm Quintet Cinches Title With Two Wins Over U. S. C.
## Moore Plays Best Games of Career 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Last Friday and Saturday cve
! nings, Engineer John Bunn and his
| laughing Stanford basketeers swept
j themselves into their second consec
utive championship of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence with a'smashing double win
over Elevator Sam Barry's U.S.C.
Trojans, by the respective scores of
39-34 and 47-38.
By their twin victory, the Cards
made themselves mathematically
certain of the Southern title, for
even if they lose next week's finale
with Cal, and the Trojans, in second
place, whip U.C.L.A.'s Bruins, U.S.C.
will still wind up two full games in
arrears.
Moore Stars
Spark-plug of the week-end deb
acle was Stanford Captain Dinty
Moore, who turned in two of the
most polished games of his three
year career.
Friday night Cap'n Dint went hog
wild offensively, tallying 15 points
for himself, and incidentally holding
together in one piece a Stanford five
that was showing definite signs of
falling completely apart.
Calderwood was out with his poi
son oak, Stoefen was playing an un
familiar guard position, Sophomore
Phil Zonne was making his first bid
in big time, and Luisetti hadn't had
a stiff workout since the week be
fore
So somebody had to come thrbugh
to down those men of Troy; and
Dint was the guy.
Cards Come Up
The game was even all the way,
with the Cards coming fast in the
closing minutes.
U.S.C. broke into an opening lead
and managed to hold an edge for 10
minutes, with the Hungarian for
ward Jerry Gracin popping them
from all angles. The dark Trojan
scored 12 of U.S.C.'s first 13.points.
Stoefen Ties Score
Stork Stoefen, however, tied it at
11-all on a beautiful set play pass
from Moore, and then Luisetti tick
led the mesh with a 20-foot one
hander to put the laughers into a 13-
11 lead, which they stubbornly- re
tained till the final gun.
The Southerners did come close to
evening it up midway in the last half
when Gracin and Hal Dornsffe went
on a spasmodic scoring rampage,
and with 8 minutes to go, the score
stood at 26-25, Stanford in front.
But Moore dropped in two in rapid
succession to sew it up.
The half time score was 25-18, for
Stanford.
Luisetti Improves
Saturday night, with Luisetti in
much better physical shape, found
the Cards complete masters save for
a moment or two of the first half,
when U.S.C. took a 10-6 lead.
Moore again took starring honors,
adding an outstanding floor game to
his 11-point total in the box-score.
However, Luisetti, who led the
scorers with 14, didn't do so bad for
| himself.
Hank ran his seasonal Conference
■ scoring string to 199, thus eclipsing
j the four-year record of U.S.C.'s Lee
Guttero by 13.
Phil Zonne also did surprisingly
well also, considering that he has
been playing forward all season. He
played center Friday night, and
guard on Saturday. His rebound play
in both games was really something
to see.
Eddie Oram of U.S.C.. all-Coast,
selection of last year, though he
didn't do a great deal of point mak
ing, did a darn good job of guarding,
and also did himself proud on a
couple of weaving, length-of-the
court dribbling rushes.
