# Buck Will Discuss Plebiscite Tonight
## 
### 
The significance of the plebiscite,
the special type of election procedure
used by the German and Italian dic
tatorships, will be discussed by Dr.
Philip W. Buck, assistant professor of
political science, on the Radio Hour
tonight at 8:30 over KGO.
"In some senses," Dr. Buck said
today in commenting on his talk,
"the dictatorships are democracies.
And decisive government has elicit
ed a genuine support from a people
who feel that strong leadership rep
resents their true desires and hopes."
