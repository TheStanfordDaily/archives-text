# Cardinal Nine Stampedes Broncos For 10-5 Victory
## 
### ART ALLEN 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
made it two straight in league com
petition Saturday, defeating the
Santa Clara Broncos for the second
time by a score of 10-5 011 the lat
ter's diamond. A seventh inning
blow-off, which netted seven runs on
live hits, a pair of walks, and two
errors, featured the game. Trailing
10-2, a ninth inning rally of three
runs by the Broncos somewhat
evened a one-sided game.
The first runs scored by the Card
inals were the direct benefit of bases
on balls off Pitcher Selenger. A sec
ond inning flury drove Stanford's
Joie Griffin from the box; he was re
placed by the veteran Ray Weier
shauser, who received credit for the
win.

with three for four, and Right-fielder
deWitt, with three for five, includ
ing a triple, led the attack. Linde
and Weiershauser each garnered two
blows.
Technically leading the league,
Stanford travels to Moraga today to
play St. Mary's in its third confer
ence game. The Phoenix, as the
Gaels are known on the diamond,
hold one victory over Santa Clara.
Saturday they were upset by Cali
fornia 6-0; whether this was because
of McNeill's strong pitching for the
Bears or because the Moragamen are
not as strong as pre-season indica
tions showed will be decided today.
A return game on the local dia-

mond with the Phoenix is scheduled
for Wednesday. Although no infor
mation has been released it is prob
able that either "Spike" Furman or
Verne Johnson will pitch for the
Cardinal nine today.
