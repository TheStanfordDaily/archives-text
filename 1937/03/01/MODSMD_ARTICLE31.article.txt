# Papooses Play Sloppy Ball In Week-end Wins
## Yearlings Shade Galileo High; Overtime Period Decides Piedmont Tilt 
### 
Sloppy is the word for iLttle Chief
Papoose and his tribe.
Nevertheless, the Papooses won
two games of basketball over the
week-end, the first against Galileo
High by a bare two points, 26-24, and
the second, which went into one
overtime period, over Piedmont
High, 38-33.
Minus the services of Leon La
faille, who has more than earned the
name "Hardluck Kid," the Papoose
quintet had a hard time getting to
gether long enough either night ot
run up more than a four or five
point lead at any time.
Game Is Slow
Friday night's game was slow all
the way, although the frosh started
fast to move into a 6-2 lead. The
Galileans kept hitting, however, and
the Papooses' lead was cut to three
points at half time, 16-13:
Second half saw the frosh roar on,
only to bog down to a standstill dur
ing the last several minutes, the gun
saving them from a possible over
time or loss.
Piedmont High Scorers
Saturday night, the game was fast,
close, and hot, with the frosh hang
ing on to a close lead throughout,
leading 26-21 at the three-quarter
mark. At the start of the fourth pe
riod, the Piedmont lads immediately
tied the score at 26-all, and then
moved out in front by two points.
The frosh then knotted it up again,
but, with three minutes to go, the
visitors sunk another bucket.

Next, Lyon made a free throw
count. Piedmont did the same, to be
followed by Anderson's charity toss.
With exactly 30 seconds to go, Bob
Dana, Piedmont dead-eye, swished a
one-hand 20-footer to move his team
out in front again, 33-31. Then Sie
bert, from about 40 feet out, took a
high shot. It was a wee bit wide,
but the man-mountain followed in,
and, climbing high in the air, ac
lually pushed the ball through the
hoop to tie the score at 33 all, as the
gun cannonaded.

fast to move into a 6-2 lead. The
Galileans kept hitting, however, and
the Papooses' lead was cut to three
points at half time, 16-13:
Second half saw the frosh roar on,
only to bog down to a standstill dur
ing the last several minutes, the gun
saving them from a possible over
time or loss.
Piedmont High Scorers
Saturday night, the game was fast,
close, and hot, with the frosh hang
ing on to a close lead throughout,
leading 26-21 at the three-quarter
mark. At the start of the fourth pe
riod, the Piedmont lads immediately
tied the score at 26-all, and then
moved out in front by two points.
The frosh then knotted it up again,
but, with three minutes to go, the
visitors sunk another bucket.

Next, Lyon made a free throw
count. Piedmont did the same, to be
followed by Anderson's charity toss.
With exactly 30 seconds to go, Bob
Dana, Piedmont dead-eye, swished a
one-hand 20-footer to move his team
out in front again, 33-31. Then Sie
bert, from about 40 feet out, took a
high shot. It was a wee bit wide,
but the man-mountain followed in,
and, climbing high in the air, ac
lually pushed the ball through the
hoop to tie the score at 33 all, as the
gun cannonaded.
