THEY'RE CONFERENCE
CHAMPIONS, NOW
Today is, of course a wonderful
day to hand out the hand-embroi
dered doilies, since that tough Tro
jan team wasn't quite hard-boiled
enough or good enough to keep
Stanford's basketballers from win
ning their second consecutive South
ern Division title.
The first orchid belongs to Gen
ial John Bunn—he tried to put out
a winning team around here for a
long time, and his hard luck fi
nally ran out last year. With the
same team, he directed the Indians
to two in a row, and that's as good
as anybody has done in this, the
toughest four-team conference in
America.
Another of the fine flowers should
go to Hank Luisetti, he of the nimble
feet and uncanny eye, the greatest
basketball player that ever played in
the Coast Conference, including
Wally Palmberg, Lee Guttero, and
Frenchy LaCombe. Hank tied and
then broke, in the first two points of
the game Saturday night, the South
ern Division scoring record of 186
points set by Guttero of Troy. As
Hank fixed it, it stands at 199, and
he still has the last Cal game Friday
night to boost it above 200. There
ought to be a great roar in the Pa
vilion Friday when he scores his first
field goal.
And to Captain Dinty Moore, ag
gressive leader who rose to the
heights in both of the Trojan con
tests, should go an extra fine or
chid. When Sam Barry's team
held Luisetti to six points in the
first game, they forgot to slow
down Dinty, and so the rugged In
dian came out second only to Jer
ry Gracin in scoring for the game.
His floor play was magnificent, the
two contests were probably the fin
est he has ever played.
There are many other individuals
deserving of pretty blooms — Phil
Zonne had his first taste of really
tough competition, playing with the
veterans as Jack Calderwood fretted
and fumed in the sick bed and did
he play basketball, or didn't he?
He'll be very handy next year, just
ask John Bunn.
Howie Turner came through again,
in the same old top-flight style. Re
member, in New York they put him,
with Luisetti, as one of the two finest
forwards ever to play in Madison
Square Garden. He plays his heart
out every time.
Little Bcebs Lee, what lie
couldn't do if he were only about
six inches taller. He stuck like a
leech to Eddie Oram. Trojan guard
and captain, who is a great ball
handler and dribbler from way
back. Even though he isn't so tall,
Beebs will get along on that easy
going, generous disposition.
There are also a few of the South
em California players who ought to
have a few bouquets. Oram, for one,
playxl wonderful ball both nights.
Sam Earry will be sorry to lose him.
Business-like Jerry Gracin can play
on mv basketball team any time—he
knows where that basket is all the
time. Hal Dornsife, too, is all right.
While we're handing out bou
quets, we ought to hand the cauli
flower for both evenings to Stan
ford rooters, collectively, for the
terrible display of sportsmanship

toward the Trojaivs and toward
Lloyd Leitli and Ernie Bailty. The
Southern Cal team played good,
hard basketball all the way, and
Stanford came out with the most
fouls.
Leith and Bailly have been reffing
basketball for a long time, and they
know about four times as much as
anybody that booed, it's a cinch,
about the game. And as far as that
goes, neither one of the two arbitra
tors has ever changed his decision
because somebody in the stands
booed. Game in and game out, those
two will do as referees.

ern Division title.
The first orchid belongs to Gen
ial John Bunn—he tried to put out
a winning team around here for a
long time, and his hard luck fi
nally ran out last year. With the
same team, he directed the Indians
to two in a row, and that's as good
as anybody has done in this, the
toughest four-team conference in
America.
Another of the fine flowers should
go to Hank Luisetti, he of the nimble
feet and uncanny eye, the greatest
basketball player that ever played in
the Coast Conference, including
Wally Palmberg, Lee Guttero, and
Frenchy LaCombe. Hank tied and
then broke, in the first two points of
the game Saturday night, the South
ern Division scoring record of 186
points set by Guttero of Troy. As
Hank fixed it, it stands at 199, and
he still has the last Cal game Friday
night to boost it above 200. There
ought to be a great roar in the Pa
vilion Friday when he scores his first
field goal.
And to Captain Dinty Moore, ag
gressive leader who rose to the
heights in both of the Trojan con
tests, should go an extra fine or
chid. When Sam Barry's team
held Luisetti to six points in the
first game, they forgot to slow
down Dinty, and so the rugged In
dian came out second only to Jer
ry Gracin in scoring for the game.
His floor play was magnificent, the
two contests were probably the fin
est he has ever played.
There are many other individuals
deserving of pretty blooms — Phil
Zonne had his first taste of really
tough competition, playing with the
veterans as Jack Calderwood fretted
and fumed in the sick bed and did
he play basketball, or didn't he?
He'll be very handy next year, just
ask John Bunn.
Howie Turner came through again,
in the same old top-flight style. Re
member, in New York they put him,
with Luisetti, as one of the two finest
forwards ever to play in Madison
Square Garden. He plays his heart
out every time.
Little Bcebs Lee, what lie
couldn't do if he were only about
six inches taller. He stuck like a
leech to Eddie Oram. Trojan guard
and captain, who is a great ball
handler and dribbler from way
back. Even though he isn't so tall,
Beebs will get along on that easy
going, generous disposition.
There are also a few of the South
em California players who ought to
have a few bouquets. Oram, for one,
playxl wonderful ball both nights.
Sam Earry will be sorry to lose him.
Business-like Jerry Gracin can play
on mv basketball team any time—he
knows where that basket is all the
time. Hal Dornsife, too, is all right.
While we're handing out bou
quets, we ought to hand the cauli
flower for both evenings to Stan
ford rooters, collectively, for the
terrible display of sportsmanship

toward the Trojaivs and toward
Lloyd Leitli and Ernie Bailty. The
Southern Cal team played good,
hard basketball all the way, and
Stanford came out with the most
fouls.
Leith and Bailly have been reffing
basketball for a long time, and they
know about four times as much as
anybody that booed, it's a cinch,
about the game. And as far as that
goes, neither one of the two arbitra
tors has ever changed his decision
because somebody in the stands
booed. Game in and game out, those
two will do as referees.
