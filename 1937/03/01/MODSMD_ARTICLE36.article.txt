# S.M.J.C. Tops Babe Field Men
## Indians Outclassed, Bow To San Mateo, 75-46 
### 
Bowing in nearly every depart
ment, the Stanford freshman track
team dropped a 75-4G meet to Coach
Tex Byrd's strong San Mateo J.C.
team here Saturday morning. The
Card Babes, minus the services of
Simpson, star hurdler who was out
with a bad cold, shone only in the
field events, taking no first places on
the track.
Outstanding effort of the day was
by Wohle, stocky Jaysee weightman,
who put the 16-pound shot 48-10'/2
for a new American Junior College
Record. The old mark was of 48-2%,
set by Gordon "Slinger" Dunn of
Menlo J.C. in 1932.
