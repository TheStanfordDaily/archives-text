STANFORD dramatics is a stewpot. It sits on
the stove, contents hot, burbling and gur
gling. Five times a year, Dramatic Council dips
into the pot and pulls out a show. Sometimes
it's a meaty bit, well cooked, with near-profes
sional seasoning. Sometimes it's an onion.
But even when ladles aren't dipping for a
show, the pot burbles and gurgles. All it needs
is a good stir to throw off a cloud of steam, for
its contents are of a highly volatile nature. Inter
pot backbiting is also popular.
Last week Barnstormers pulled out a Gordon-
O'Neill bit for the Spring Show. Somebody
said it was an onion. Someone else said it was
the best of several onions. In the end it will
probably turn out to be a pretty tasty bit.
And The Daily stirred the dramatic stewpot,
by saying that Barnstormers did a bad job of
ladling. Steam filled the campus opinion
columns.
Still, Stanford can be glad its stewpot is
gurgling, and burbling, for such signs are
indicative of savory dramatic dishes. It should
not mind if ingredients of the stew tend to stew
at one another, because a lot of them are pretty
talented people, and talented people are usually
jealous of other people who are also pretty
talented.
In fact, twenty years from now when Barn
stormers are barnstorming Broadway, their pot
will still be boiling, and all the people who go
to shows will still be entertained as much by
the burbling and gurgling as by the onions
dished to the surface.â€”G. F.
