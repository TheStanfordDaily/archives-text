# What Price La Dance
## 
### 
WHEN the Administration and other minor
prophets of campus democracy begin put
ting pressure on the class of '38 to hire a good
cheap orchestra for a popular-priced Junior
Prom, the committee can always answer back
—"What about the Toyon Formal?"
Usually about the time some dance com
mittee is about to sign a contract with a Big
Name band, people start grousing that $3.75 or
S4 is too much to pay for an evening in the
Pavilion. But when the night arrives, the Pavil
ion is packed and afterwards everyone won
ders when Jimmy Dorsey is coming back
again.
Big Name bands in themselves don't make a
dance expensive. Take the case of the Toyon
Formal. An ordinary campus orchestra for an
ordinary campus formal. Fancy bids, fancy
decorations, a few bon-bons. Three dollars a
couple.
But when Jimmy Dorsey brings his orchestra
up from Los Angeles for a Junior Prom, $3.75
covers it and it's worth $3.75, perhaps more.
The time to complain is when a dance isn't
worth the money—ordinary campus dances
which are run on the theory that a high-priced
bid makes them really formal.
The Toyon Formal was an outstanding affair
if you didn't remember that it cost $3. But
$3 is a lot to ask a "rough" to pay for some
home-grown fun without sensational attractive
ness.
A Big Name orchestra (remember last year
when Jimmy Dorsey played "Come Join the
Band" in swing-time) is something different.
You are not paying for soft lights and a cellu
loid program you'll never use anyway. You're
pay for Jimmy Dorsey—Pennies for heaven.
