# ROOSEVELT MAY SIGN SUPREME COURT BILL
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (UP). â€”
President Roosevelt tomorrow may
sign the Sumners Bill, enabling Su
preme Court justices to retire at 70
on full pay, shortly after the high
tribunal reconvenes to announce
decisions which may have far-reach
ing effect on New Deal legislation.
Lacking only the signatures of
Vice-President John N. Garner and
Mr. Roosevelt, the bill will, for the
first time in history, safeguard the
pensions of those who leave the su
preme bench.
The court, which has been con
ferring in secret on its decisions and
writing opinions for two weeks, re
convenes at noon with three im
portant New Deal issues pending.
