# And Now It's TGIFC

(From the Oregon Emerald)
THIS WINTER'S bumper crop of initial-letter
organizations —which probably is a belated
satire on New Deal alphabeticism—has glutted
the market. So much so, in fact, the students
no more than lift a weary eyebrow at the advent
of each new tongue-twister.
Oregon has lhe world its TCLACA in
support of idealistic young love. Webfoots to
whom TCLACA became anathema tallied with
an alphabetical organization of their own. And

lately there flashed into existence the SFTTS
TSOOC, the Society for Taking the Small-
Town Stuff out of College, a group whose sole
raison d'etre was the opposition of its members
to the social dictatorship that prescribes formal
dress for various campus functions. And, con
sidering the number of such initialed fellow
ships that have been engendered on other
campuses, the most tolerant thing that one can
say is that the idea has been worked to the
bone.
And so it is with a great deal of hesitancy
that we express our admiration for the latest
entrant to these alphabetic ranks: the TGIFC,
the "Thank-God-It's-Friday Club" at the Uni
versity of Missouri. We could probably re
strain our praise were it not for the fact that this
new organization founded "to promote end-of
the-week relaxation with temperate beer-drink
ing and scholarly discussion of the week's
events," fills such an obvious need.
Friday—bless the day!—how it beckons at
the end of the week. Like an oasis, it is, in a
waste of lectures and fevered studying. Let's
see: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday ....
And, alack, it's only Monday.
