/ CONTRARY to Our Hasher's prediction and most de
vout wish, the women's fashion edition came out
Friday morning without even so much as its slips show
ing. After the women reconciled their differences on
the length of women's skirts and kind of got the hang
of the thing, they settled down to putting out the eight
pages of trial and error (no runs, no hits) without a
hitch.
However, after the women settled down and the
room settled down a greater menace to the biswing
freedom of the press arose in the shape of the Delta
Tau Delta house.
r JPHE shape of the Delta Tau Delta house was com
paratively unchanged by last summer's remodeling
and is in the form of a rectangle. But it seemed to'be
in quite a different shape Thursday afternoon at 6
o'clock, when half of the house moved in on The
Daily office.
The trouble seemed to arise over the fact that the
Delts have a hasher in the Tri Delt kitchery who won
$1000 on a $2 lottery ticket that the Tri-Delt cook had
given him.
At 7 o'clock the hasher said it was no trouble at all.
At 8 o'clock the Delt house said, no, they didn't want
any publicity.
At 9 o'clock the editorial board of The Stanford
Daily asked why not.
At 10 o'clock the Delt house said no, they didn't
want any publicity.
At 11 o'clock the Delt house said it was a bad idea.
At 12 o'clock the editorial board of The Stanford
Daily asked why was it a bad idea to print a story
about a hasher winning a $1000 prize on a lottery ticket
given by a sorority cook.
At 1 o'clock the Delt house said that their alumni
adviser said it was a bad idea, and went home, or
someplace like home, quite confident that it was a bad
idea and that there is no place like a rectangle.
AT 1:30 the editorial board of The Stanford Daily
called up the alumni adviser and asked him why he
thought it was a bad idea. The alumni adviser said he
thought it was just a bad idea and why in heaven's
name did they get him up out of his warm bed at 1:30
in the morning and said it was a bad idea. However,
he didn't care if they printed the story, even if it was
a bad idea.
So The Stanford Daily was printed and appeared
Friday morning with 8 pages of fashion, 2 pages of
hashion, 2 pages of gnashion, nothing on pashion, which
is just as well. Delt felt delt belt below belt.
