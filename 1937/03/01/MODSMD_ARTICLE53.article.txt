# BULL SESSION
## TERPISCHORE CHANGES HER ADDRESS 
### 
JNSTEAD of dwelling in San Francisco as she used to,
Terpischore now lives there, and she has a home with
a marine view where she dances herself to death just
for the hell of it and not for art.
Furthermore, she's at home every night except Mon
day and anyone who wants to go and dance r with her
is cordially invited.
* * * *
She used to have a house, several of them in fact,
up in town, but the jabber of society got to be too
much for her so she moved out to wtiere she could have
fun for fun's sake, fun the likes of which you've never
seen.
Tired of battering herself and others to death on the
none-too-smooth boards of such step-one, slide-bump,
step-two, slide-crash joints that sit high atop Nob Hill
and low adcep on Market street and across from Union
Square, she got disgusted and left.
# * Xt i]i
Tired of being nice just for the sake of her socially
nice friends and tired of hearing bad orchestras defame
the name of her brother Orpheus, she has moved from
the smoke-filled bar-rooms where no one talked of
anything except wine, women, and studies and has
taken up housekeeping in a fresher, freer atmosphere
where she can be nice for nicety's sake, where she does
n't have to swill herself to death to have a good time,
where she has no fear of anyone walking on her
mangled feet—because her friends are too busy strut
ting on their own—out to where she and her devotees
can once again become creative artists instead of
stooges.
In short, her address is now Topsy's at the Bead..
♦ * id *
Out there they have an orchestra with seven men in
it, but when Ihey all stand up and let the dancers have
the closing bars on "Honeysuckle Rose," the music
dodsn't come out of seven instruments. That much mu
sic couldn't come out of twenty.
Rather, it starts out in the Pacific somewhere, comes
blasting through the door, and lifts you right off your
feet into another world.
And you won't be the only one who looks foolish
trying out paralyzed limbs. All around you there will
be little guys with big girls and big guys with little
girls and they'll all be moving so fast you'll feel sorry
for yourself, sorry you aren't dancing instead of walk
ing and sliding.
* # * *
You'll be walking and they'll be swinging.
And Terpischore will look down on it all and feel
pretty happy that she was the one who was inventive
enough to discover people swinging in San Francisco.
The only thing that can beat it is a good skating
rink.

And Terpischore will look down on it all and feel
pretty happy that she was the one who was inventive
enough to discover people swinging in San Francisco.
The only thing that can beat it is a good skating
rink.

JNSTEAD of dwelling in San Francisco as she used to,
Terpischore now lives there, and she has a home with
a marine view where she dances herself to death just
for the hell of it and not for art.
Furthermore, she's at home every night except Mon
day and anyone who wants to go and dance r with her
is cordially invited.

She used to have a house, several of them in fact,
up in town, but the jabber of society got to be too
much for her so she moved out to wtiere she could have
fun for fun's sake, fun the likes of which you've never
seen.
Tired of battering herself and others to death on the
none-too-smooth boards of such step-one, slide-bump,
step-two, slide-crash joints that sit high atop Nob Hill
and low adcep on Market street and across from Union
Square, she got disgusted and left.

Tired of being nice just for the sake of her socially
nice friends and tired of hearing bad orchestras defame
the name of her brother Orpheus, she has moved from
the smoke-filled bar-rooms where no one talked of
anything except wine, women, and studies and has
taken up housekeeping in a fresher, freer atmosphere
where she can be nice for nicety's sake, where she does
n't have to swill herself to death to have a good time,
where she has no fear of anyone walking on her
mangled feet—because her friends are too busy strut
ting on their own—out to where she and her devotees
can once again become creative artists instead of
stooges.
In short, her address is now Topsy's at the Bead..

Out there they have an orchestra with seven men in
it, but when Ihey all stand up and let the dancers have
the closing bars on "Honeysuckle Rose," the music
dodsn't come out of seven instruments. That much mu
sic couldn't come out of twenty.
Rather, it starts out in the Pacific somewhere, comes
blasting through the door, and lifts you right off your
feet into another world.
And you won't be the only one who looks foolish
trying out paralyzed limbs. All around you there will
be little guys with big girls and big guys with little
girls and they'll all be moving so fast you'll feel sorry
for yourself, sorry you aren't dancing instead of walk
ing and sliding.

You'll be walking and they'll be swinging.
And Terpischore will look down on it all and feel
pretty happy that she was the one who was inventive
enough to discover people swinging in San Francisco.
