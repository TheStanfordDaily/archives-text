## FLESH AND DIE DIETRICH 
### 
IJEOPLE have been going around
for weeks saying "Dietrich in
color!" in an awed tone of voice.
And now here she is, right in our
own Stanford Theater, complete with
desert, technicolor, Charles Boyer,
and Basil Rathbone, looming at one
from all conceivable angles in a slow,
ponderous trinket called "Garden of
Allah."
Let it be said at the outset that
the color is all one could desire.
Particularly good in the scenes in the
desert, it is never too bright, never
glaring as has been the case with
other Hollywood efTorts along the
same line. Soft and luminous, it
underscores the story and lends
reality to a talc which badly needs
it.
Miss Dietrich, however, proves
disappointing. There was a time
when merely looking at her was
enough, when nobody gave a hoot
what she was supposed to lie doing.
Unfortunately those days are gone—
if not forever, at least temporarily.
She still remains the greatest ex
ponent of Sex with a capital S now
on the screen, but she shows about
as much true feeling as a turnip.
Nothing comes through that smooth,
enameled surface to make us feel
anything except that Miss Dietrich is
pretty well satisfied with Miss Diet
rich. Under ordinary circumstances,
one doesn't mind this; but when she
is matched with an actor of Charles
Boyer's calibre, it's not only pretty
feeble, it's just plain hopeless.
For Mr. Boyer can act. And he can
act very well. And whenever he is
allowed to have the screen, he makes
his co-star seem as brittle and super
ficial as one has always suspected
her to be. Boris Androvsky is the
main prop of a syrupy, sappy, nine
teenth-century tear-jerker, but in
Mr. Boyer's sincere hands he be
comes a figure one can believe in,
tormented and tragic, and completely
real. The four or five minutes in
which he justifies himself to Domini
comprise the climax of a very
worthwhile piece of work.
Basil Rathbone has nothing to do
and does it superbly as always. Slick,
suave, and sinister, he plays the con
ventional role of friend-to-the
heroine with a good deal more punch
than it deserves. One can't help
thinking what a good Rhett Butler
he'd make for "Gone With the
Wind," if and when that awaited
epic gets under way.
C. Aubrey Smith lends solid sup
port as a priest, and Tilly Losch
makes her debut in one of the most
colorful dance scenes in a long time.
The Losch personality, whatever it
may be, doesn't have much chance
to make itself felt, and the dance she
does is much too short. Joseph
Shildkraut's Batush is amusing.
For atmosphere and pictorial ef
fect, Miss Dietrich's latest series of
close-ups can't be beat. And it has
Boyer and Rathbone to hold the
acting end up. So maybe it isn't so
bad, after all.
Designed for the Donald Duck
trade, "We're on the Jury" stars
Helen Broderick and Victor Moore
in a comedy which is good enter
tainment in spite of its tendency to
overdo its humor. It's good fun, and
so is "The Alpine Climber," Mickey
Mouse's latest.
