## DRY FISH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Throw Prima a Prendergassed, some
body!
For if Prendergassed thinks Prima's
jazz is atrocious,
And considers that blastingly hot
trumpet ferocious,
And yet even as he blasphemes poor
old Louie so flaunted,
He admits that Prima gave the crowd
what they wantedâ€”
Then it would seem to me that in a
nice play like the Famous Door,
by Satan's daughter,
Prendergassed is nothing more than
a fish out of water.
