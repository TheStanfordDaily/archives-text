# ASSIGNMENT TWO
## 
### 
I go into the library
To read assignment two,
But when I close the book each day
I still have it to do.
I always open to page one
And read the first line through,
But, 'cause I've gazed around the
room
That line I must review.
A tempting crossword puzzle lies
In front of Mary Lou;
I borrow it and add some words
Before I read line two.
I set for hours at a time
And work and work it's true,
But each tomorrow I return
To read assignment two!
