NOW THAT Barnstormers organ
ization has decent reason to exist

when it fosters the production of
student-written shows. In doing so
it de/elops campus writers, musi
cians, actors and directors and it
should in time develop a strong body
of active Stanford talent in the field
of original campus dramatics.
When a professional, such as Frank
O'Neill, can return to the campus
with a show which eclipses the ef
forts of campus writers who are just
as anxious to achieve competence as
he ever was and when Barnstormers
will support and produce such a
show Barnstormers murder the
ideals upon which their society was
founded.
Obviously a spring production,
written and directed by active stu
dents has the primary purpose of
developing Stanford talent and Stan
ford dramatics. When a professional,
ex-Stanford man or not, presents a
show to be produced on the campus
his purpose is basically a develop
ment of his own personal profes
sional prowess, and Stanford and its
dramatics functions can be no more
than secondary.

Chaparral certainly will not spon
sor either editorially or with pub
licity such a project as Barnstorm
ers contemplates at present in the
O'Neill-Gordon, "Down the Hatch."
Stanford people who are at present
active upon the campus should ex
press their resentment against this
intrusion upon the rights of those
who are here to learn something and
to develop both themselves and the
Stanford stage.
Surely O'Neill and Gordon will
realize that their once glorious day
at Stanford is ethically past. If they
do not withdraw their opus willing
ly the campus can either demand
that Barnstormers refuse "Down the
Hutch" or ignore the production of
it completely.
