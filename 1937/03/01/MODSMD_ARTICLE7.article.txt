# Sit-Downers Called Illegal By Merriam
## Executives Unanimous In Vote Against Labor's Newest-Found Weapon 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 28 (UP).—The
sit-down strike is illegal in the
opinion of the governors of five states
who replied to a nationwide poll by
the United Press of gubernatorial
opinion on labor's newest weapon.
None of the governors replying to
the poll delivered an outright en
dorsement of the sit-down strike as
a legitimate tactical maneuver in
controversies between labor and
management. Three governors ap
proved the use of force to eject sit—
downers.
Governors' Aid Sought
Experience has been that at some
stage of a sit-down strike the man
agement usually appeals to the gov
ernor of the state for assistance in
forcing employees to surrender the
plant they have seized.
Governor Frank Murphy of Michi
gan declined to order national
guardsmen ot evict sit-downers in
plants at Flint during the recent
General Motors strike, and the fac
tories were surrendered voluntarily
after the governor's mediation ef
forts proved successful.
Merriam Says 'No'
Governor Frank F. Merriam, said:
"There is no justification for sit
down strikes. No one has the right to
dispossess a legal owner of his
property and sit-downs cannot be
justified from any standpoint."
Governor R. L. Cochran of Ne
braska said he opposed sit-down
strikes and would use force to evict
persons engaging in them.
