# Local Barbers To Clip Indians For 65 Cents
## 
### 
While Stanford farmsters
were driving for lower prices
on their orange juice and apple
pie, the barber shops sneaked
in and delivered a crushing
blow to the Rough's already
flat pocketbook.
Starting this morning the
Stanford "Trotskyite" will lose
a crop of hair for 65 cents,
while an Indian desiring a clean
shaven face will acquire such
for 35 cents at the shops.
Meanwhile, neighboring Palo
Allans and Menloites will also
feel the edge of the price boost.
The new rates were agreed
upon by both union and non
union shops in Palo Alto, Stan
ford, and Menlo Park at a un
ion meeting last Thursday to
meet the level existing between
Burlingame and Mountain
Viej^v.
