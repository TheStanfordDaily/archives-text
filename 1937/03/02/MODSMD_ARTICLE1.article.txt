emergency gold legislation.

invalid the California "caravan" law
imposing a $15 tax on automobiles

of sale within the state.
L.A. Firm Loses

on the law by Howard Morf, doing
business in Los Angeles under the
name of the Pacific Wholesale Auto
mobile Company.
A three-judge Federal Court in
Los Angeles condemned the law by
a two-to-one vote on the ground it
substantially imposed a tariff on the
importation of automobiles into the
state.
Extends 1934 Verdict
Today's gold decision was an ex
tension of the Court's verdict hand
ed down in January, 1934, which

years ago. The present case in
volved a $1500 rental contract be
tween the Holyoke Water Power
Company of Holyoke, Mass, and the
American Wrapping Paper Company.

Benjamin N. Cardozo. Justices Wil
lis Vandevanter, James C. Mcßey
nolds, George Sutherland, and
Pierce Butler, who dissented in the
first gold decision, dissented in to

fect on future control of the cur
rency through legislation.
