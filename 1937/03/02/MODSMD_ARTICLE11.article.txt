# New N.R.A. Bill Prepared By Congress
## Legislators Will Present Regulatory Measure To F.D.R. for Approval 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 1 (U.R).â€”
An NRA substitute bill which would
set a minimum 40-hour week for
industry, secure the legality of col
lective bargaining and create a
three-man administrative board to
regulate hours and wages has been
prepared for President Roosevelt's
approval, it was learned today.
The measure is expected by those
who have drafted it with White
House assistance to be submitted to
Congress in about a month along
with Mr. Roosevelt's anticipated mes
sage on labor legislation.
As now visualized, it makes no
provision for regulating or controll
ing industry. Administration advis
ers concede that one of the primary
reasons for the failure of the NRA
was its attempt to regulate capital
and labor with the same machinery.
Any endeavor to establish new
methods of industrial control will be
withheld and drafted in a separate
measure, presidential advisers said.
Tomorrow he will submit a special
message to Congress on a report of
a study committee on the effects of
NRA, but in it he will make no rec
ommendations. They will be made
in a later message.
