# Revised Binet Test Published by Terman
## Ten Years' Work Spent In Correcting Flaws 
### 
A revision of the Stanford-Binet
intelligence test, costing thousands
of dollars and requiring over a
decade of work, was announced as
completed yesterday by its authors,
Dr. Lewis M. Terman and Dr. Maud
Merrill James.
The revision is regarded by psy
chologists as the most important de
velopment in intelligence determi
nation methods since 1916, when the
original Stanford-Binet tests were
first revised.
Additions to Test
After rechecking all basic work,
the scope of the test was increased
to include two-year-olds and supe
rior adults. Where the first revised
form included 90 tests, the new re
vision now contains 129 tests, filling
in the gaps which formerly existed
between the eleventh and thirteenth
years, and locating tests at half
year rather than the yearly intervals
which were formerly found below
the five-year level.
One of the most important fea
tures, however, of the newly revised
tests is the alternative form which
has been devised. The use of this
form, interchangeable with stand
ard test, is to allow the test to be re
given a second time without involv
ing any transfer of learning.
3000 Tested
Working under Dr. Terman and
Dr. James were a group of skilled
women who made over three thou
sand tests in seventeen widely sepa
rated communities; the tests were
made over "all age levels and with
representative and unselected sub
jects. The data gathered were then
assembled, standardized, and finally
analyzed statistically by two other
members of the psychology depart
ment, Dr. Paul Buttenwieser and
Dr. Quinn McNemar.
Dr. Terman has been a well
known worker in this field; his sev
eral publications have been highly
important in the psychological world.
Dr. Merrill, his co-worker, has also
long been associated with the Binet
and other intelligence tests.
