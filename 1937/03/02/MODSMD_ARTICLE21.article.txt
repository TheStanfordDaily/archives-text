# Gutenberg Page Prized by Libe

''Reader, pause a while, for
you look—and it may be for the
first time—upon an actual page
of the Gutenberg Bible—the
most precious piece of printing
in the world, and admittedly
the earliest. Truly a noble
fragment!"
Thus reads the preface in the
binding which contains a leaf
from the Book of Esdras in the
famed 42-line Gutenberg Bible.
This fragment is preserved, to
gether with sundry other book
treasures, in an office safe at
the Stanford Library.
Here, too, may be found a
leaf from the first American
Bible. Printed in the Indian
tongue in 1663 by Professor
Eliot of Cambridge, the book
has 1180 printed pages, each of
which contains 4000 type char
acters.
