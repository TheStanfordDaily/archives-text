# Rec Dance To Be Held in Clubhouse
## 
### 
Third dance of the recently or
ganized Stanford Recreation Club
will be held tomorrow night from 7
to 8 o'clock in the Women's Club
house.
"The location of the dance has
been changed from Old Roblo Gym
to the Women's Clubhouse," says
Bill Ward, club chairman, "because
of the more central and better
known location of the latter. I hope
that there will be more "walking
dates" to the dances in the future."
The dance tomorrow night will be
the last of the winter quarter series,
Ward announced. "The dances this
quarter," he added, "have been in
creasingly successful. A second se
ries of dances is planned for spring
quarter."
Admission to the dance is 25 cents
a couple.
