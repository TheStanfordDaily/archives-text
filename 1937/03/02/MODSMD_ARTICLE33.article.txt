# Encina Boasts Mural Art 109 Offers Gallery Display

### DOUGLAS JAQUES 
Encina is unique. Encina is an ant
pile. Encina is noisy. Encina is a
shock to new freshmen, and Encina
is significant to the- more idealistic
Communists. But to the laddies in
Room 109 it is too drab and plain.
So they did something about it.
Murals on Walls
They put murals on their walls.
Not pictures from Esquire and the
rotogravure, not pictures from the
home folks and girls, but murals.
They were drawn and designed by A1
Kittell after they had been approved
by his room-mates. They were drawn
for the most part to life size, dark
ened, and some of them were colored
in pale shades with crayons.
These murals are done on the
three walls facing the beds. On one

side are two candid shots from the
Stanford Band showing the drum
major and some distance behind him
the drummer with the big drum. On
the back wall a little drama is por
trayed concerning a dog, a dish of
bones, and a lamp post. A touch of
mystic is added by the face of a man
looking over the hall window at this
scene.
Extra Sleeper
But the masterpiece, as Artist Kit
tell puts it, is on the third wall. It is
a life-size man sleeping, and snor
ing, in a like-size bed. It is parallel
with the beds and many noisy fresh
men have come into the room late at
night, seen the realistic mural and
have tiptoed out thinking that one of
the 109 brethren was sleeping. They
were very thoughtful and unusual
freshmen, but that is not the point.
The point is that Artist Kitell is a
craftsman of merit and room-mates
Bob Arnold and Dick Buchanan
should feel honored to be Encina's
only supporters of art.
These murals will probably be
come one of Stanford's points of
beautyâ€”if some unappreciative jan
itor doesn't wash them off.
