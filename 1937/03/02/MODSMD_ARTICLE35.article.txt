# Captain Runs Fast Half-Mile In Time Trials
## McCurdy Does 1:54.5 As Entire Team Improves; Southern Trip Planned 
### 
Captain Bill McCurdy served
formal notice on coasi half-milers
yesterday when he ran the splendid
lime 1:54.5 in Coach Dink Temple
lon's informal time trails. The tall
senior was handicapped several
yards behind Ray Malott and Carl
Mahurin, who ran 1:59.8 and 1:59 flat
respectively.
With the coming of dry weather
and a fast track, combined with the
outlook of a trip south to the Long
Beach Relays this Saturday,, the en
tire team seemed suddenly to climb
off the proverbial dime. They have
been granted $150 for the trip, and
two or three cars lull of trackmen
may make the trip if plans mate
rialize.
Jimmy Kneubuhl pulled a surprise
by beating Dean, Voigt, and Hiser
man in a 9.9 hundred, quite a sensa
tion considering Kneubuhl's train
ing so far this year. Jim Reynolds
was consistent over 48 feet yester
day, taking a high of 49-4, with
Montgomery right behind at 48-2.
Ray Brown (frosh) jumped 22-11,
and Hiserman won the 220 in 22.8
for other leading performances,
while all distance men went two
miles, to be led home in 9:54 by Bob
Alexander.
