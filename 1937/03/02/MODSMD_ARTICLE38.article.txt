# Farm's Orphan Ski Team To Ask For Recognition
## 
### WARREN BREED 
Stanford's orphan ski team march
es en masse on the Ex Committee
tonight in the first move of a pro
gram to make skiing a minor sport.
The members figure they deserve
the recognition, chiefly for the show
ing they made last week-end at the
Coast Intercollegiates at Yosemite.
Competing against 11 schools, they
took fourth place, losing only to
Washington, Nevada/' and California,
colleges where skiing is a recog
nized minor sport and where point
scoring athletes are given circle let
ters for their skill.
Lewis Is Spokesman
Lester Lewis, acting spokesman
for the slippery-hickory men, will
base his case tonight on the fact that
if Stanford skiers can grab fourth
place in topnotch competition as was
offered at Yosemite without practice,
coach, expense funds, or even Uni
vei'sity recognition, what could they
do with those four things?
Lewis also points out that of the 11
teams entered, Stanford was the only
one that was not provided with ex

perise money for the trip. Washing
ton skiers get $700 a year.
Two Meets Planned
For the rest of the season, two j
meets have already been billed and |
others are pending with California, !
Nevada, and other local teams.
Backing Lewis up in the campaign j
tonight will be Bill Janss, the frosh |
who was the big Cardinal star with a ;
fifth and a ninth place in the field of i
54, Bob Arnold, who turned in a good i
all-round low score, Bill Meyer, Stan j
Goulter, Jack Osborne, and John |
Pease.
