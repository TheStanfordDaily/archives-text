# Stanford Nine Trounces Gael Team, 13-3
## Indians Slam Out 14 Hits To Give Moraga Men Year's Worst Beating 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseballers took
another mighty stride on their way
to their first C.1.8.A. championship
in years when I hey trounced a sup
posedly strong St. Mary's team 13-3
at Moraga Valley yesterday after
noon.
The Indians slammed out 14 hits
to J) for tlie* Gaels, at the same time
gathering only one error to seven by
St. Mary's, to hand the Jimmy Un
derhill-coached nine its worst defeat
of the year.
Furman Pitches
Toiling for Stanford on the mound
throughout the game was the big,
easy-throwing right-hander, Spike
Furman. He kept (he Gaels'' hits
well scattered, allowing tallies only
in the first, sixth, and eighth inn
ings.
Wally DeWitt, bespectacled right
fielder, boosted an already strong
average with five sizzling hits in six
attempts, including a triple and a
double, to lead the Cardinal batting
attack. His triple came in the
fourth inning, driving two runners
home. He scored himself a little
later. II was Stanford's strongest of
several none-too-weak cantos, with
a four-run barrage under four hits
and a pair of walks.
Other Heavy Hitters
Other Indians who got better than
one hit apiece were Heagerty,
catcher, with two for four, and Hol
man, first base, with two for five.
Leonard Linde, third base, snapped
out a perfect fielding day with no
errors in 12 chances. Stanford scored
two double plays.
