# Swimmers Set For Two Meets
## Battle Fullerton, Uclans This Week-end 
### GENE GEAR 
Two of the strongest swim teams i
in the southland will invide the In-j
dian water hole this week in an at
tempt to stymie the high flying Card
mermen.
Fullerton J.C. will clash with Nort
Thornton's undefeated Indian am- i
phibians on Friday, and the Bruins j
from U.C.L.A. will form the opposi- |
tion Saturday afternoon.
1500 Meter Trial
Both meets will be in Encina Pools, |
the Fullerton one beginning at 3
o'clock, and the Bruin contest at 2 !
o'clock. Coach Thornton announces j
that both meets are free of charge.
As an added feature to the Fuller- !
ton meet. Dave Rider, Stanford's !
representative at the N.C.A.A. in !
Minnesota on March 26 and 27, will j
take a 1500-meter time trial. Rider 1
will swim for points in the 440 and
will continue on, being paced by va- j
rious frosh distance men.
Jaysecs Strong Team
Fullerton always turns out one of
the best junior college teams in the ;
country and this year the southern
ers have an eye on the scalp of the
Indian varsity. Last year the Jaysees j
nosed out the Card frosh team and '
demanded a meet with the varsity j
this year.
Dick Clark, Winfield Needham.
Don Towne, and Roy Winkelman still !
remember that defeat last year.
Crack Records
Thornton is negotiating with the I
Bruins to hold the meet Saturday t
in the short 20-yard pool. The '
Uclans splash around in a pint-sized <
tub down in Westwood, so there will I
probably be no objections from that :

held by Oregon, mentioning as spe
cial goals the 300-yard medley relay
and the 400-yard free-style relay

Jaysecs Strong Team

the best junior college teams in the ;
country and this year the southern
ers have an eye on the scalp of the
Indian varsity. Last year the Jaysees j
nosed out the Card frosh team and '
demanded a meet with the varsity j
this year.
Dick Clark, Winfield Needham.

Crack Records
Thornton is negotiating with the I
Bruins to hold the meet Saturday t
in the short 20-yard pool. The '
Uclans splash around in a pint-sized <
tub down in Westwood, so there will I
probably be no objections from that :
source.
Thornton wants to crack a few Pa- !
cific Coast short course records now !
held by Oregon, mentioning as spe
cial goals the 300-yard medley relay
and the 400-yard free-style relay
marks.
