REST APPEASED

First off, profuse apologies must go
to Jack Calderwood for what was
undoubtedly a raw deal on the pub
licity in yesterday's paper. That live
column cut layout omitted his pic
ture, in the first place, and then
there was no mention of him in the
accompanying legend.
Spooky has played all season and
has been one of the most important
cogs in the Big Red Machine—he is
as much as responsible for the great
ness of Stanford in hoop this year as
any of the other four that had their
pictures in the paper. Not only a
constant threat on offense from the
usually not-so-dangerous guard po
sition, the grinning giant gets the
palm as the finest of Indian defen
sive men.
It was hard enough luck for him
when he caught poison oak and was
forced out of the two games that
were the conference deciders, but
when his name was forgotten almost
absolutely in the congratulations for
the winners, that is terrible.
We're sorry, Jack, but we can offer
no excuses. The blame over in the
Daily Shack can be laid at no par
ticular person's door. It's what we
pass off with mutterings and mum
blings as "interdepartmental stu
pidity."

EVERY YEAR,
STANFORD PARTICIPATES

The Long Beach Relays, an annual
track classic in Southern California,
will be held this week-end, but it is
still doubtful whether Stanford will
be represented this year, as is custo
mary.
Dink Templeton wants to send
down both one-mile and two-mile
relay teams, plus as many field event
men that want to go. There is no
compulsory entrance exacted, but
the Boy Coach likes to sec his team
in the contests.
Frosh Coach Bill Ellington had
planned to drive down and take a
few of the boys, but something came
up and that's out. The B.AC., has
guaranteed the team $150 for ex
penses, but the athletes have to go
down in automobiles, so there isn't
an awful lot of enthusiasm rampant

about the trip.
Jim Reynolds, number one shot
putter, finds things too heavy for him
on the Farm and says he can't go.
Possibly Hucklebridge or Montgom
ery "will go, but the thing is still
pretty much up in the air.

FOR AMATEURS
THEY'RE COLOSSAL

Several Stanford Scandahoovians
were up in the snow over the week
end participating in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Ski Meet, and came
out fourth in the final reckoning.
Now, fourth place, you say, isn't so
much—it would be much better if
they had come in the money. That's
fine, but there are restrictions. It
seems that Stanford's team was the
only one at the meet that wasn't
there as an official representative of
its school. Every contesting outfit
but the Indians was there as a regu
lar team, the Cards went to the
slither grounds purely on their own
hook, to see what they could do.
Maybe if they had a little some
thing to win for, such as the dear old
Alma Mater, they might have come
in among the first three places.

AH, ANOTHER
GRIPE REMOVED

After apologizing to Jack Calder
wood, it comes to memory that there
is a certain crew of mistreated in
dividuals over in Encina Gym, led
by a doughty warrior who divides
his time between basketball and
books with great proficiency, that
needs another apology for lack of
publicity.
This doughty head man has been
asking, crying, pleading, threaten
ing, and wheedling for some pub
licity for his underrated but over
worked gang for months, and so to
save him from developing an infe
riority complex from lack of recog
nition we must give him due mention
in Slants.
Walter Guido Vincenti is his
name, his stooges are the soph and
junior managers for basketball. He,
of course, is the suave senior man
ager who must be able to rise from
the position of menial labor at times
to act a part as the polished diplo
mat in making various public affairs
arrangements. .

were up in the snow over the week
end participating in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Ski Meet, and came
out fourth in the final reckoning.
Now, fourth place, you say, isn't so
much—it would be much better if
they had come in the money. That's
fine, but there are restrictions. It
seems that Stanford's team was the
only one at the meet that wasn't
there as an official representative of
its school. Every contesting outfit
but the Indians was there as a regu
lar team, the Cards went to the
slither grounds purely on their own
hook, to see what they could do.
Maybe if they had a little some
thing to win for, such as the dear old
Alma Mater, they might have come
in among the first three places.

After apologizing to Jack Calder
wood, it comes to memory that there
is a certain crew of mistreated in
dividuals over in Encina Gym, led
by a doughty warrior who divides
his time between basketball and
books with great proficiency, that
needs another apology for lack of
publicity.
This doughty head man has been
asking, crying, pleading, threaten
ing, and wheedling for some pub
licity for his underrated but over
worked gang for months, and so to
save him from developing an infe
riority complex from lack of recog

Walter Guido Vincenti is his

First off, profuse apologies must go
to Jack Calderwood for what was
undoubtedly a raw deal on the pub
licity in yesterday's paper. That live
column cut layout omitted his pic
ture, in the first place, and then
there was no mention of him in the
accompanying legend.
Spooky has played all season and
has been one of the most important
cogs in the Big Red Machine—he is
as much as responsible for the great
ness of Stanford in hoop this year as
any of the other four that had their
pictures in the paper. Not only a
constant threat on offense from the
usually not-so-dangerous guard po
sition, the grinning giant gets the
palm as the finest of Indian defen
sive men.
It was hard enough luck for him
when he caught poison oak and was
forced out of the two games that
were the conference deciders, but
when his name was forgotten almost
absolutely in the congratulations for
the winners, that is terrible.
We're sorry, Jack, but we can offer
no excuses. The blame over in the
Daily Shack can be laid at no par
ticular person's door. It's what we
pass off with mutterings and mum
blings as "interdepartmental stu
pidity."

EVERY YEAR,

The Long Beach Relays, an annual

Dink Templeton wants to send
down both one-mile and two-mile
relay teams, plus as many field event
men that want to go. There is no
compulsory entrance exacted, but
the Boy Coach likes to sec his team

Frosh Coach Bill Ellington had

few of the boys, but something came

guaranteed the team $150 for ex
