# Victors Relax In Preparation For Cal Friday
## Indian Hoopmen To Seek Annihilation of Bears In Series' Final Game 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
With but one game of the regu
larly scheduled conference season
remaining to be played—that with
Cal in the Pavilion on Friday night—
John Bunn gave his Stanford bas
ketball scjuad, newly crowned
Southern Division champs, a prac
tice lay-off yesterday.
By their twin victory over U.S.C.'s
Trojans last week-end the Cards
stand as official representatives of
California against the Northern Di
vision winner. Consequently the Cal
game Friday night diminishes great
ly in importance, since Stanford has
already cinched the annual four
game Big Series with wins in the
first three contests.
Bears Gun for Champs
But the Bears will be in there
pouring it on for all they're worth
Friday, battling both for the honor
attendant upon beating the champs,
and also to stay in front in their
cellar battle with U.C.L.A.
After Friday the Injuns will have
to gun for either Washington, Ore
gon, or Washington State, all three
of whom are still in the Northern
race.
Washington and Oregon are tied
for the lead with 10 wins and 4
losses apiece, with Washington State
in an excellent position to throw the
scramble into a triple tie.
Indian Will Go North
No matter who wins up there,
however, Stanford will be the visit
ing team, as Washington was down
here last year.
Dates for the three-game series
have not as yet been announced, but
John Bunn's boys will not be able
to play on the week-end of March 12,
as finals come the subsequent week.
The most probable bet is March 25
and 26, a week after finals are over.
