# Flu Puts Lafaille Out for Season
## 
### 
After being subjected to almost
every injury a basketball player can
receive, and still play the game, Leon
Lafaille, ace Irosh forward, last
week was fouled by the worst of
them allâ€”flu.
He was yesterday confined to the
Paly Hospital, there to stay indefi
nitely, thus cancelling all good
chances of participating in the final
game of the season, to be played
Friday.
Winding up their 1937 season, the
Papoose quintet will play the Cal
Cubs in the third game of the series,
which is split to date, each team hav
ing won one game.
