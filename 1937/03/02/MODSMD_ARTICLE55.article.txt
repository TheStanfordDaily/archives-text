# Mr. Fox Has the Edge
## 
### 
Threatened boycotts, waik-outs, sit-downs
and stay-aways drummed up by The Daily
and the A.S.U. last fall failed to make any im
pression upon Paly theater-owners, the Fox
West Coast monopoly. Balcony prices sailed
through the winter (with spring not far behind)
under the same "summer" price banner.
Alter mutual indiscretion between the class
of '40 and the Stanford Theater, the campus was
to punish the naughty cinemansion by going to
the movies in San Jose. But the campus really
didn't mean its threats, jammed the Stanford
Theater anyway whenever Simone Simon or
Rogers-Astaire were featured.
Now the question of getting mad at Mr. Fox
has turned up again. Larry Rouble, at Ex Com
mittee meeting last week, reminded President
Reynolds that an arbitration committee had
been appointed several months ago, had never
done anything. Reynolds told Rouble that ne
gotiation will again be attempted.
By this time the Stanford Theater is pretty
well set. The campus has shown, through con
tinued patronage, that it will pay 40 cents for
balcony seats. The theater has discovered that
in many cases balcony seats are preferred over
down-stairs seats even when the price is the
same.
Reynolds' committee can argue with Fox
West Coast to the tune that "Stanford supports
your old theater." But Fox West Coast will only
smile back with a "Yes, thanks." Time has
proved the theater's case—the 40-cent ticket
stubs of Stanford students are the evidence.
Double bills were also included in the autumn
onslaught. But double bills continue. Variety,
showman's trade journal, reports that "double
features obtained a firmer grip on the industry
during 1936 and no discernible move towards
single featuring is expected before 1938, if
then." Hollywood has geared its production
schedule to the double bill and U.S. exhibitors
are tied to it.
Palo Alto doesn't mean anything to Mr. Metro
and Mr. Warner—or, it seems, to Mr. Fox. Big
Business says Stanford must pay 40 cents to
see a double bill, and until Palo Alto theaters
actually lose Farm patronage on a large scale,
Stanford will continue to pay 40 cents to see
a double bill.—D. B.

Theater anyway whenever Simone Simon or
Rogers-Astaire were featured.
Now the question of getting mad at Mr. Fox
has turned up again. Larry Rouble, at Ex Com
mittee meeting last week, reminded President
Reynolds that an arbitration committee had
been appointed several months ago, had never
done anything. Reynolds told Rouble that ne
gotiation will again be attempted.
By this time the Stanford Theater is pretty
well set. The campus has shown, through con
tinued patronage, that it will pay 40 cents for
balcony seats. The theater has discovered that
in many cases balcony seats are preferred over
down-stairs seats even when the price is the
same.
Reynolds' committee can argue with Fox
West Coast to the tune that "Stanford supports
your old theater." But Fox West Coast will only
smile back with a "Yes, thanks." Time has
proved the theater's case—the 40-cent ticket
stubs of Stanford students are the evidence.
Double bills were also included in the autumn
onslaught. But double bills continue. Variety,
showman's trade journal, reports that "double
features obtained a firmer grip on the industry
during 1936 and no discernible move towards
single featuring is expected before 1938, if
then." Hollywood has geared its production
schedule to the double bill and U.S. exhibitors
are tied to it.
Palo Alto doesn't mean anything to Mr. Metro
and Mr. Warner—or, it seems, to Mr. Fox. Big
Business says Stanford must pay 40 cents to
see a double bill, and until Palo Alto theaters
actually lose Farm patronage on a large scale,
Stanford will continue to pay 40 cents to see
a double bill.—D. B.
