### 
TAKING a lesson from the railroads, Stan
ford's barbers are charging what the traffic
will bear. Starting yesterday, haircuts hit a new
high of 65 cents. Which leaves Stanford men
in a lather.
Ten years ago, even the Union s genial Jim
couldn't have gotten away with it. Them were
the days when a haircut and shave didn't mat
ter. Demand and supply were at odds, and
price reconciled them.
Today, with the campus filled with women,
a haircut and shave are necessary at any price.
And the barbers know it. Which makes the
price raise and the pocket-book massage good
economics, but lousy sociology.
For it makes good appearance a luxury, just
as the post-war boom made integrity a luxury.
Where on Friday it took two thinks before
you'd invest in some "no-clippers-on-the-side
and-not-too-short," it takes at least four thinks
today, and makes wallet-width a bigger factor
in barbershop bookkeeping than nature's pro
vision for the growth of hair.
After all, how much money papa sends from
home has nothing to do with the redundance
of your wool.
But the barbers have made money the de
termining factor. Which is fine for the barbers.
But which practically forces Stanford students
into the House of David, not so nice as the
House of Kappas.
