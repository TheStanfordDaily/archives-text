# Basketballs and Broomsticks

(From California Daily Bruin)
NO, it isn t the sudden appearance of a public
enemy which causes the bedlam of boos
and cat-calls. And it isn't a miscarriage of crim
inal justice that provokes the roars of anger
coming from the Pan-Pacific auditorium.
It's simply that a striped-shirt gentleman has
called a foul against U.C.L.A.'s basketball
squad.
As the member of the opposing team takes
his place on the foul-line, all good Bruin rooters
lift their voices in sanguinary cries, rightly ex
pecting the nerves of the shooter to give way.
It's a good idea. Editorials have always been
yelping for more general participation in sports.
Why, here's a chance for everybody to take

part in their college's athletic battles.
Only the participants don't do their jobs well
enough.
They could, for example, crowd along the
sidelines and thrust broomsticks between the
legs of their opponents. Or they could shy a
rock or two at the enemy forwards as they are
about to drop the ball through the hoop.
