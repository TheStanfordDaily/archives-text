ITS LUCKY that Stanford is enlarging its organ, be
cause that gives the student guides who go through
the resurrection every morning in front of the Memo
rial Church something new to talk about.
These trusty souls can tell the people who get off the
busses where every stone in Inner Quad was guarded,
the name of the 145 th house in the S.A.E. chapter roll
and who that lady was who was seen out without you
last night.
That they are not always infallible, and that they
might possibly need something new to talk about was
shown thoroughly by an event that occurred before
Stanford enlarged its organ.
One day there sat by the organ, weary and ill at
ease, Mr. Warren D. Allen, who the student
guide just after he had polished off the dessert course
of the Last Supper.
Said the guide, "And now to the left you may see the
Stanford organ, largest in the world."
"No, no," said Mr. Allen to the guide, after the
strangers had departed for lowa, tired but happy. "It's
a very good organ, and quite large for this type, but
isn't the largest in the world."
the next round the guide fired this, "And now ot
the left you may see the Stanford organ, largest
for its size in the world."
"No, no," said Mr. Allen, to the guide, after the
strangers had departed for lowa, "you are misleading
people."
On the next round, Mr. Allen sat by the organ,
tired but happy, while the guide below, weary and
ill at case, said, "And now to the left you may see the
Stanford organ, it isn't very big, but gee, it's swell.
"And on our rightâ€”"
But the strangers had departed immediately for
lowa.
track captain has discovered a new
training technique, but he hasn't let Dink or the
boys know about it yet. The captain went home to the
Delt house at 3:30 Saturday morning after a date with
a D.G. senior, got up at 9 and went out on the track
and ran Dink's quarter-miler training race of 352 in
28:1. Well, it isn't the best in the world, but gee, it's
swell, and it will give the student guides something
new to talk about!
The railbirds are under the impression that the
cause of the phenomenal time was that the captain was
in a hurry to get the practice over with so that he
could get ready for his date with the same D.G. senior
that night.
