# BULL SESSION
## BIG BUSINESS OUT OF BUNNY RABBIT 
### 
LITTLE late for Friday's fashion edition but at
any rate a little before fur coats go into the moth
balls for the summer I offer a few random thoughts on
the fur trade.
Peter Rabbit, of course, is world-ramous now for
being reincarnated under black dye and such nomen
clature as Nubian Seal or Baltic Seal, furry fishes that
never sported anywhere off of dry land.
But the Manchurian version of Fido the house dog
appears under a host of aliases as well. The usual
trick to make them silver foxes is, after they are dyed
black, to tip them white with an electric process, or
blue in silver badger hairs from bum badgers that
were never any good in the first place.
* * * *
While I am on the subject of dogs and foxes, it
should be noted that while a chicken that takes life
easy may make good eating, a fox that has been sit
ting down too much gets fuzzy and makes poor fur.
Incidentally, a lot of ermine seen on the best, people
looks suspiciously similar to squirrel belly, and most
of the mink coats of song and story resolve themselves
down almost to ordinary weasel.
* * * *
The average furrier is a mere salesman, not a crafts
man, and it is his job to invent the front-window plac
ards about how the furs on display were rushed out of
the frozen northlands by dogsled, while in the back
end of the shop the cutter does the dirty work of mak
ing the little bunnies what they are not. *
Practically all furs are stretched before final mount
ing, but the line between legitimacy and illegitimacy is
hazy ,and how a little water can case a furskin out to
twice its size is little short of miraculous.
Another way to make the skins grow is by a process
known as leathering. A fox will be split open, slit
lengthwise, spread apart at the splits and then pasted
together, in widened form with leather-base adhesive
tape holding the cut edges properly apart.
By a series of V-shaped cuts that can't be typo
graphically described, the animal can be made almost
twice as long. A little breath blown into a finished
scarf sometimes reveals a world of such mastery trick
ery hidden down at the base of the hair.
# * * *
of the merchandise is not precisely a
crime, but some furriers' pet trick of moving their
stock into hiding on Thursday, declaring bankruptcy
on Friday, and reopening business in a new location
with the same old stock on Monday is hardly cricket.
At that, a lot. of pretty furs in windows are not the
furrier's merchandise at all, due to the wholesalers'
practice of loaning goods on a foggily-contractual mem
orandum basis.
This results in furriers selling goods that they have
not yet bought, a demoralizing situation when it is
noted that some furriers are such credit cheaters that
they cannot be trusted with a 50-cent furskin overnight
without cash on the line.
The trade axiom goes that the fancier the front of
the store, the more you oughta be wary of the man in
the back shop. I know of one sumptuous fur salon in
San Francisco which was expert at swiping eight or
ten skins out of a forty-skin timber of ermine with
out breaking the lead seal, and leaving the bundle so
that it still counted 40 skins. The trick was done by
pinning the tails of the stolen skins to the rump ends
of the skins left intact.
# * * #
If anybody were interested, I would go on with this
pointless muck-racking of the fur trade and tell a few
stories the cop told me after we got swindled out of a
lot of squirrel skins. Then again, I might relate
authentic experiences of my early days behind the
scenes of a White Log Tavern in a yarn entitled
A Double Hamburger with Onions from Conception
to Realization."

of the merchandise is not precisely a
crime, but some furriers' pet trick of moving their
stock into hiding on Thursday, declaring bankruptcy
on Friday, and reopening business in a new location
with the same old stock on Monday is hardly cricket.
At that, a lot. of pretty furs in windows are not the
furrier's merchandise at all, due to the wholesalers'
practice of loaning goods on a foggily-contractual mem
orandum basis.
This results in furriers selling goods that they have
not yet bought, a demoralizing situation when it is
noted that some furriers are such credit cheaters that
they cannot be trusted with a 50-cent furskin overnight
without cash on the line.
The trade axiom goes that the fancier the front of
the store, the more you oughta be wary of the man in
the back shop. I know of one sumptuous fur salon in
San Francisco which was expert at swiping eight or
ten skins out of a forty-skin timber of ermine with
out breaking the lead seal, and leaving the bundle so
that it still counted 40 skins. The trick was done by
pinning the tails of the stolen skins to the rump ends
of the skins left intact.

LITTLE late for Friday's fashion edition but at
any rate a little before fur coats go into the moth
balls for the summer I offer a few random thoughts on
the fur trade.
Peter Rabbit, of course, is world-ramous now for
being reincarnated under black dye and such nomen
clature as Nubian Seal or Baltic Seal, furry fishes that
never sported anywhere off of dry land.
But the Manchurian version of Fido the house dog
appears under a host of aliases as well. The usual
trick to make them silver foxes is, after they are dyed
black, to tip them white with an electric process, or
blue in silver badger hairs from bum badgers that
were never any good in the first place.
* * * *
While I am on the subject of dogs and foxes, it
should be noted that while a chicken that takes life
easy may make good eating, a fox that has been sit
ting down too much gets fuzzy and makes poor fur.
Incidentally, a lot of ermine seen on the best, people
looks suspiciously similar to squirrel belly, and most
of the mink coats of song and story resolve themselves
down almost to ordinary weasel.
* * * *
The average furrier is a mere salesman, not a crafts
man, and it is his job to invent the front-window plac
ards about how the furs on display were rushed out of
the frozen northlands by dogsled, while in the back
end of the shop the cutter does the dirty work of mak
ing the little bunnies what they are not. *
Practically all furs are stretched before final mount
ing, but the line between legitimacy and illegitimacy is
hazy ,and how a little water can case a furskin out to
twice its size is little short of miraculous.
Another way to make the skins grow is by a process
known as leathering. A fox will be split open, slit
lengthwise, spread apart at the splits and then pasted
together, in widened form with leather-base adhesive
tape holding the cut edges properly apart.
By a series of V-shaped cuts that can't be typo
graphically described, the animal can be made almost
twice as long. A little breath blown into a finished
scarf sometimes reveals a world of such mastery trick
ery hidden down at the base of the hair.
