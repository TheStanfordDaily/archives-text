CLARK ON BROADWAY
/ANCE more Fred Clark, Scrap
book's Gotham correspondent,
crashes through to offer his com
ments on various offerings of the
Broadway season. Good stuff, we
think, so here goes:
NEW FACES isn't the typical re
vue. The cast makes you think
they're performing because they're
enjoying themselves, not because
they're paid to do so. Actually, this
highly successful professional show
oflers little that the usual Stanford
Gaieties does not, excepting a beau
tiful chorus and effective dance spe
cialties. Songs, skits, and cast in
general do not far surpass our own.
Guys and gals gleefully spit on
hands, hitch up collective pants, and
swing from the heels on politics, ex
grid-greats, Mary of Scotland, bur
lesque queens, and so on ad infini
tum (but definitely not ad nauseam).
Hit of the show is diminutive
Imogen Coca, who resembles Mar
garet Sullavan imitating Fannie
Brice, and is pantomimist and mon
ologist par excellence. She is hilar
iously backed up by Charles Kemp
ner (side-splittingest at> an ex-pig
skin-hero with a dash of lavendar)
and a swarm of young collegians.
The Duncan Sisters (new faces?)
with their outhouse humor do their
darnedest to ruin the show, but
thank God they flop dismally.
SEEN BUT NOT HEARD displays
three talented youngsters (ages 15,
13, and 10) carrying, albeit with
slight stagger, one production com
plete with uninspired adults. Plot:
Uncle John kills Aunt Ruth. Uncle
Bob discovers all, kills Uncle John.
Kids find clue in Johnny's clammy!
paw. What to do anent favorite
uncle? What happens when the sher
iff starts pestering them was amus
ing at the time, but we're darned if
we can remember one cute remark j
a week later. Frankie Thomas is ]
swell as the No. 1 boy of the least I
sappy theater children encountered|
to date, and the three brats drag!
down many a situation laugh. As to
the grown-ups, we must quote Mas
ter Thomas in an early scene: "Par
don me while I throw up."
LOVE FROM A STRANGER is
the next best thing to a good play.
Acts 1 and 2 smell. Act 3 is a
boogy that balances you on the edge j
of your seat and permits you one !
short, whistling gasp of air every i
third minute. A brash young Cana- j
dian meets a beautiful sweepstakes!
winner, marries her within the week, |
and they cottage in the country. It'
becomes increasingly evident that
he's a five-time wife-murderer hot I
after a sixth scalp. Quite naturally'
the lady in question objects; what
happens in the third act whips you
into a positive lather, but far be it
from me to spill the story. Written |
and played by England's Frank Vos- I
per (super swell); we also view Jes- j
sie Royce Landis as a very natural
young actress. It's closed for re- !
vision and there are rumors of a
tour; if you get a crack at it, don't
miss.
