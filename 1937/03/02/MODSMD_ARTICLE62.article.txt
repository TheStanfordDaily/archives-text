## 
### 
Columbia has incorporated Jean
Arthur and George Brent into a
foamy little piece called "More Than
a Secretary," now playing at the
Mayfield Theater. Trouble is, once
you've blown the foam off there's
nothing left.
The plot, such as it is, belongs in
the public domain. Boss hires secre

boss falls for another, a brainless
floozie. Before picture ends, boss
realizes mistake. Doesn't sound like
much material for Jean Arthur and
George Brent, does it? It isn't.
The pair handle it as best they can,
give it a few laughs in connection
with "Body and Brain," the maga
zine they're trying to publish. Sam
ple crack: "That's what my mother
always told me—'Take care of your
body, Mazie; that's all you've got.' "
