The Editor, Sir:
Rugby isn't getting a fair deal at
Stanford. It seems strange to us that
the best rugby team on the coast
should go unheralded and unclaim
ed. In four years of conference play
the Stanford ruggers have won three
championships and are well on their
way to the fourth.
But who knows about it? The
boys who go out there and risk their
necks in the toughest body-contact
sport on the coast certainly know.
The coaches, incidentally among the
most able in the country and who
donate their time out of love for the
game, know about it. But outside of
a few who were interested in it be
fore Stanford ever revived it, no one
else has been told what a great game
it is. And why not? The answer is
simple. Because rugby is not a high
ly commercialized sport, because the
boys who play are not playing for
personal glory, scholarships, or a ride
on the gravy train, because the gate
receipts do not amount to major
business enterprise, Stanford's great
publicity department has neglected
the game as unprofitable.

On the other hand, California with
a less impressive record, with less
original interest, has built rugby in
to a game of major importance.
California's publicity department, re
alizing the appeal of the time-hon
ored, grit, and muscle spoit, has giv
en it a fair break. As a consequence
it has become a game of great draw
ing power and interest at Berkeley.
Look back at our own Daily of last
Friday; look at the few terse lines
of notice Stanford's highly success
ful team was given before a cham
pionship game. Then look at Cali
fornia's Daily and compare the
write-up their rugby team received.
Look in the Sunday papers of San
Francisco and compare the sparse
comment on Stanford's victory, with
the verbose description of Califor
nia's game.
This failure must be laid at the
feet of our publicity department
which seems to have resolutely
turned its back on the game which
was the school's number one sport
for a number of years following the
war.
The game deserves an even break.
Watch the boys sometimes, Don.

Naturally, we don't expect rugby to
be given the publicity and push of
basketball or football, the money
sports, but we do think that the
boys who take their bruises and
give their time and energy for the
sheer love of the game and for
Stanford's glory should be given
their due credit. They don't even
expect an athletic award. For their
sake and for Stanford's, wake up
publicity department, and get un
der way.
Signed,
Several Rugby
Enthusiasts
