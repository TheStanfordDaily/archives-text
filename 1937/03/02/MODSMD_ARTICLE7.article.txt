# Franich to Supervise Senior Day Activities
## Part of Program Will Be Held in Amphitheater 
### 
Chick Franich, Hall candidate for
the A.S.S.U. presidency in the 1936
elections, was appointed chairman of
the Senior Class Day committee last
night by Senior President Mort
D'Evelyn.
Franich, whose associates will be
announced at an early date, will su
pervise the ceremonies that have
traditionally been a part of the grad
uating exercises at Stanford.
The class day activities last year
included the reading of the senior
history, will, poem, and other papers,
laying of the class plate in the in
ner quad, and a luncheon in the
Union court. A customary feature of
the day's program has been a visit to
the Stanfords' tomb north of Palm
Drive.
Invitations to the various affairs
will be sent to President Wilbur,
members of the Board of Trustees,
and other administrative officials.
A majority of the Class Day pro
gram will probably be held in the
new $65,000 memorial amphitheater.
