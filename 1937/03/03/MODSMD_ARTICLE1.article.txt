## Interfraternity Council Sees Need for Better Honor Code Training 
### 
Political science themes, English
compositions, hygiene projects,
which for the past few years have
done heavy duty for the various
fraternities, were placed last night
under the interdict of the Interfra
ternity Council. No longer will they
be common property, for each fra
ternity president pledged himself to
destroy these works immediately.
The reason given for this long ex
tant violation of the Honor Code was
that, as freshmen, the fraternity men
hadn't been given sufficient educa
tion in the intricacies of Stanford's
Honor System. For that reason it
was planned to give future frosh
more intensive drill, by means of
small groups, in the Honor Code.
Ways and means of doing this arc
going to be discussed in tonight's
joint meeting of the Men's and the
Women's Council.
Exams in fraternity files are not
included in this ban, as it applies
only to original products. In order
to prevent their circulation, it was
suggested that the professors be
asked to withhold themes, composi
tions, and projects unless the student
has sufficient reason for wanting
them.
The majority of complaints to
Men's and Women's Councils have
been that of original work being du
plicated. Co-operation between the
professors and the Councils has been
much better this quarter. Another
suggestion which may be acted upon
in the near future is that of includ
ing an honor pledge page, probably
of a different color, in the registra
tion books.
