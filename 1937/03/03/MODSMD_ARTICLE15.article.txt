## Committee Asks Longer Law 101 Schedule 
### 
A recommendation to Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur that Business Law be J
extended from two to three quarters I
was the first official act of the newly
formed Student - Faculty Relations
Committee, whicn met yesterday.
Jim Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president
and head of the committee, reported
that most of the students now in the
course asked for the recommenda
tion. He said they felt that the course
was one of the most valuable they
had taken, but that they needed
more than two quarters to assimilate
all the available material.
Plan Vocational Aid
Also discussed at the meeting were
plans for a series of nine weekly
vocational guidance lectures for
spring quarter. Representatives from
various departments, and possibly
some outside speakers, will give the
lectures, which are open to all, but
are primarily for students who have
not yet chosen their majors.
Tentative arrangements are under
way to have the lectures on Wednes
day nights in the Women's Club
house.
More Social Relations
Also under discussion is a series of
lectures for Spring quarter on "How
To See Europe." Caryll Mudd is in
charge of the committee investigat
ing the possibility. She is assisted by
Jackie Brown and Doris Clayburgh.
A social subcommittee to plan ex
tracurricular relations between stu
dents and professors was appointed
yesterday by Co-chairman Jean Bird
and Bob Adams. Members include
Beth Allen, Ed Bamett, Ellen Davis,
Gordy Frost, and Barbara Paine.
| This group will meet tonight to
formulate plans.
