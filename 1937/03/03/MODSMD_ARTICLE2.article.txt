# Telephone Co. Sued for $3.65
## Telephone Switchboard Brought To Court 
### 
NEW YORK, March 2 (U.R).—They
set up a telephone switchboard in
Municipal Court today, cleared the
aisles and called two swell-looking
gals at witnesses in the epoch-mak
ing suit for $3.65 that James J.
McCoy has filed against the tele
phone company in the interest of
all persons who sometime in their
lives havo been told to deposit five
cents pa-leeze.
Mr. McCoy looks upon himself as
a crusader against the telephone
company, which, he thinks, has been
overcharging him and you. The tel
ephone company looks upon Mr.
McCoy as a man who is "seeking
publicity for his inventions." Last
summer Mr. McCoy invented a ma
chine that would check the number
of outgoing local calls he made and
when his figures didn't agree with
the company's he went before the
Public Service Commission and won.
Today he finally got around to the
long-distance end of the telephone
business and popped up with another
machine—this one to tell how long
he talks. He says he has talked $3.65
less than the company claims and
.so he had the law on the phone com
pany in a brief filled with where
ases, and or's and deponent saycth's.
