# Jorgensen, Mallett Named Class Officers
## 
### 
Irvin Jorgensen, former Daily editor and "Our Hasher," was yesterday
named class historian, and Bob Mallett, prominent in Stanford debating
and dramatics, was selected as class orator by Mort D'Evelyn, senior
class president.
Jorgensen's treatment of the events in the career of the Class of '37 is
expected to inject an unprecedented tang of humor in the traditional

history, D'Evelyn asserted. Mal-<
lett's oration, as well as readings of
the class history, poem, and other
papers, will be included in the Class
Day events, which will be closed by
the annual Senior Ball.
Announcement was made Monday
night of the appointment of Chick
Franich as chairman of the Class Day
committee. Selection of the Senior
Ball chairman will probably be made
this week, D'Evelyn said.
