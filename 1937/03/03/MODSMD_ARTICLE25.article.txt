### 
LOS ANGELES. March 2 (UP).â€”
Superior Judge William Tell Aggeler
today continued until next Tuesday
hearing pleas of 349 Douglas Aircraft
Company "sit-down" strikers when
attorneys requested additional time
to file demurrers.
Defense counsel stated that addi
tional time was needed to prepare
the demurrers because the felony
conspiracy charge had not been
used previously in labor cases.
Judge Aggeler ordered the defense
lawyers to file their demurrers be
fore Friday and asked that copies be
given to the district attorney's office
so that the prosecutors could prepare
their answers by Tuesday.
"Both sides must be prepared to
argue the demurrers and other at
tacks on the indictment then, as
there will be no more continuances
for pleadings," he said.
