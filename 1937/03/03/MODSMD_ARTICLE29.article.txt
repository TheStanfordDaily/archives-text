# Leaders Plan Presentation Of Nominees
## Ex Committee Arranges To Introduce Student Body Office Candidates 
### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Introducing candidates for student
body offices to the students who vote
for them may be accomplished
spring quarter, if the plan formulat
ed last night by Ex Committee goes
through.
Morning classes will be excused,
and the Assembly Hall obtained.
"No one wants to listen to speeches,"
objected Ruth Goodan. Ex Com
mittee agreed. Only prospective
presidents and vice-presidents will
talk—all others will appear briefly.
Rest of the hour, decided the
group, would be filled with a
"worth while" program to heighten
student interest. Possibilities were
a San Francisco orchestra or a well
known speaker. "What we really
need is Ten-O-Win or Bank Night,"
offered Bob Mallett.
Jim Ransohoff will act as chair
man of the program, assisted by Roy
Thompson. Only drawback is that
Public Exercises Committee has not
as yet granted permission. Whether
or not the affair will be continued
depends upon the interest of the vot
ing public.
GAIETIES go to press to
day, announced Bob Mallett. He
asked for decision as to whether the
title should say "Stanford Presents"
or "Ram's Head Presents." Result of
a hard-fought battle was "Four Hits
from Ram's Head Big Game Gaieties
of Stanford."
"Don't forget a requisition," was
the parting shot of Student Manager
Chuck Fontius.
DATES APPROVED were Gamma
Phi, April 9; Sigma Nu, April 9;
Kappa Sig, May 7; sophomore car
nival, April 10, closed date; junior
class dinner, March 3.
CARDINAL MINUTES, appoint
ing committees and setting dates for
the Convalescent Home Drive, were
approved.
DRAMATIC COUNCIL minutes,
leaving the complimentary list for
plays to the discretion of the dra
matic manager, also went by un
challenged.
STANFORD SKI CLUB, which
placed fourth with 14 schools com
peting in last week end's meeting,
now wants recognition and cash
support. "They actually have a go
ing organization," reported Bob
Starkweather. "You're going to have
trouble getting money for anything
from the 8.A.C.," warned Fred Wil
liams. "Even minor sports awards
cost $4 apiece." Williams and Roy
Thompson were named to arbitrate
between the B.A.C. and the skiers.
THE NITERY as it may look was
exhibited in artistic pastels. "Lots of
people have said that they don't like
those benches by the fire-place," re
monstrated Esther Pelton.
"You're talking about love seats,
aren't you?" queried Fontius. The
subject was dropped. But progress,
says Jim Reynolds, is being made.
STUDENT AID committee will re
ceive 50 per cent of the spring dol
lar per student. Exact amount is not
yet known.
STUDENT - FACULTY committee
is also progressing, reported Presi
dent Reynolds. Vocational Guidance
lectures have been planned, and the
Business Law course expanded. A
committee is working on a series of
discussions of "How to go to Eu
rope."
PEACE DAY will be observed, re
ported Esther Pelton. Carolyn
Moore was named as committee
head, in charge of correlating the 14
interested organizations and pin li
ning the program.
"Is the A.S.U. in on this?" inquired
Fontius, belligerently. It was. A dis-
