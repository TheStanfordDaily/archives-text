# Rep. Sumners Hints justices Should Retire
## Chairman of Roosevelt Judiciary Plan Denies Public Respect Loss 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 2 (U.R>.—
Representative Hatton VV. Sumners,
D., Tex., House judiciary chairman
in charge of President Roosevelt's
court reorganization plan, said in a
speech today that Supreme Court
justices who elect to retire would be
"co-operating with their govern
ment."
Sumners sought to refute intima
tions made by two prominent oppo
sition Senators that a jurist who left
the bench at "this particular time"
would lose public respect. Senator
Hiram W. Johnson, R,, Calif.,
charged that the administration was
seeking to "lure" justices from the
bench, and. Sen. Edward R. Burke,
D., Neb., backed him up.
Interpretation Unfair
But the Texas representative, a
frequent White House visitor since
Mr. Roosevelt sent his special court
message to Congress, argued that
this interpretation was "unfair" and
that no Justice should fear the loss
of public respect if he retired.
Sumners' remarks came as Sena
tor M. M. Logan, D., Ky., lined up
in support of the bill in a 55-page
speech which he read to the Senate.
At the same time Mr. Roosevelt
summoned Senator Bennett C. Clark,
D., Mo., and Senator Clyde Herring,
D„ la., to a conference. Herring
turned upon schedule, but Clark was
"detained" at the Capitol. Last night
he made a radio speech attacking
the President's plan.
The attack was continued tonight
when Senator Arthur H. Vanden
berg, R., Mich., broadcast an appeal
for a constitutional amendment in
stead of the President's plan.
Support List Grows
Logan's support brought the list
of Senators pledged to Mr. Roose
velt's bill to 31.
Thirty-three Senators have pub
licly avowed opposition.
Of the remaining 32 members, 18
have privately indicated an inclina
tion to support the President and
seven probably will oppose him,
leaving seven others still uncommit
ted.
The fact that Mr. Roosevelt yes
terday signed a law permitting Su
preme Court Justices to retire at
70 on full pay gave significance to
Sumner's House remarks. Sumners
was the author of the law. He
argued that it was meant only to
extend to the high tribunal a re
tirement privilege that has been in
effect for Federal Circuit and Dis
trict Courts since 1919. Six Supreme
Court jurists have become eligible
to retire under the new law.
Mention of the Supreme Court
prompted two other representatives
to denounce the tribunal. Repre
sentative Dewey Johnson, F. - L.,
Minn., charged that the Justices are
"on a sit-down strike" against "hu
manitarian legislation." Representa
tive John McSweeney, D., 0., urged
Congress to vote its inclinations on
the President's bill and let the people
speak in the next congressional elec
tion.
"That will be sufficient referen
dum," he said.

70 on full pay gave significance to
Sumner's House remarks. Sumners
was the author of the law. He
argued that it was meant only to
extend to the high tribunal a re
tirement privilege that has been in
effect for Federal Circuit and Dis
trict Courts since 1919. Six Supreme
Court jurists have become eligible
to retire under the new law.
Mention of the Supreme Court
prompted two other representatives
to denounce the tribunal. Repre
sentative Dewey Johnson, F. - L.,
Minn., charged that the Justices are
"on a sit-down strike" against "hu
manitarian legislation." Representa
tive John McSweeney, D., 0., urged
Congress to vote its inclinations on
the President's bill and let the people
speak in the next congressional elec
tion.
"That will be sufficient referen
dum," he said.
WASHINGTON, March 2 (U.R>.—
Representative Hatton VV. Sumners,
D., Tex., House judiciary chairman
in charge of President Roosevelt's
court reorganization plan, said in a
speech today that Supreme Court
justices who elect to retire would be
"co-operating with their govern
ment."
Sumners sought to refute intima
tions made by two prominent oppo
sition Senators that a jurist who left
the bench at "this particular time"
would lose public respect. Senator
Hiram W. Johnson, R,, Calif.,
charged that the administration was
seeking to "lure" justices from the
bench, and. Sen. Edward R. Burke,
D., Neb., backed him up.
Interpretation Unfair
But the Texas representative, a
frequent White House visitor since
Mr. Roosevelt sent his special court
message to Congress, argued that
this interpretation was "unfair" and
that no Justice should fear the loss
of public respect if he retired.
Sumners' remarks came as Sena
tor M. M. Logan, D., Ky., lined up
in support of the bill in a 55-page
speech which he read to the Senate.
At the same time Mr. Roosevelt
summoned Senator Bennett C. Clark,
D., Mo., and Senator Clyde Herring,
D„ la., to a conference. Herring
turned upon schedule, but Clark was
"detained" at the Capitol. Last night
he made a radio speech attacking
the President's plan.
The attack was continued tonight
when Senator Arthur H. Vanden
berg, R., Mich., broadcast an appeal
for a constitutional amendment in
stead of the President's plan.
Support List Grows
Logan's support brought the list
of Senators pledged to Mr. Roose
velt's bill to 31.
Thirty-three Senators have pub
licly avowed opposition.
Of the remaining 32 members, 18
have privately indicated an inclina
tion to support the President and
seven probably will oppose him,
leaving seven others still uncommit
ted.
The fact that Mr. Roosevelt yes
terday signed a law permitting Su
preme Court Justices to retire at
70 on full pay gave significance to
Sumner's House remarks. Sumners
