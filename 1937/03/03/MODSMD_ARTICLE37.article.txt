NOW ABOUT THOSE
LONG BEACII RELAYS
That track situation is still all
bawled up- the Long Beach Relays
Committee has put up the guarantee
of $150 for the Stanford team, but
the B.A.C. hasn't and won't come
across with enough money to make
the fund large enough to send a 15-
man team south by train. The team
members don't want to go if they
have to go by automobile.
And the reason they want a 15-
man team is because the S.P. will
knock the rates down to 13 bucks
apiece, going and coming and with
berth.
There has been talk of joining
hands with the Cal delegation so that
it wouldn't be necessary to send so
many down, but nothing has yet
come of it. If the fellows don't get
together pretty soon on the situation
they will be out of the meet alto
gether, since the eligibility list must
be in tomorrow. The meet, one
which Stanford usually enters, will
be held Saturday afternoon.
SWIMMING IS BACK
THIS WEEK
The powerful Indian swimming
team, one of the strongest Stanford
has ever had, they tell me, takes on a
pretty tough team Friday afternoon
in Encina Pools. Fullerton J.C., from
that Southern California area that
produces so many great athletes,
brings up an outfit to take on Nort
Thornton's squad that has the repu
tation of being tfie strongest in the
southern section of the state this
year.
Many of the members of the team
diddle around with the L.A.A.C.
swimming and water polo teams
when they're not competing for their
school, and you have to have some
thing on the ball to get by on the
Angels Club.
It will be a close meet, that's a
cinch, although Thornton should be
able to put together a team that will
beat the southerners.
Saturday afternoon the Indians
again compete, this time against
U.C.L.A., and although the Bruins
aren't up to dear old U.S.C. in
paddling power this year they will
have a fair-to-middling aggrega
tion.
All in all, the Stanford swimmers
will have a pretty lively time this
week-end. And Coach Thornton is
especially anxious to have a crowd
out to have a gander at his boys, so
why not come around and watch the
team work? They put some pretty
good races on in a swimming meet,
as anybody that has seen one will
probably tell you. It will be your
next to last chance to see the squad,
because there will be just one more
meet here, that with U.S.C. April 2.
SAY NOW. LOOK AT
THE BASEBALL TEAM!
Now that the baseballers have
socked away three conference games
in a row, and are leading the league,
it will bo good stuff to mention when
Stanford last won a California In
tercollegiate Baseball Association
title. In 1931, with the great Dan
Johnson pitching, the Indians put it
across, but they haven't been able
to do it since.
The team was coached by Harry
Wolter, of course —he's a real vet
eran. having been here since 1923.
Three wins and no losses for the
Cards, two over Santa Clara and
one over St. Mary's, puts them in the
percentage lead in the league. They
take on the Gaels again today, on
the Sunken Diamond, and they're
not going out there to lose.
If there's any team on the campus
that needs support, that has been
without a good showing of students
for a long time, it's the baseball team.
Now if there was a good crowd out
there this afternoon it would glad
den the cockles of Harry Wolter's
heart, besides being quite a boon to
the team in point of spirit. Take a
little time off to see a good game.
It's too early to start studying for
finals yet.

the Sunken Diamond, and they're
not going out there to lose.
If there's any team on the campus
that needs support, that has been
without a good showing of students
for a long time, it's the baseball team.
Now if there was a good crowd out
there this afternoon it would glad
den the cockles of Harry Wolter's
heart, besides being quite a boon to
the team in point of spirit. Take a
little time off to see a good game.
It's too early to start studying for

NOW ABOUT THOSE
LONG BEACII RELAYS
That track situation is still all
bawled up- the Long Beach Relays
Committee has put up the guarantee
of $150 for the Stanford team, but
the B.A.C. hasn't and won't come
across with enough money to make
the fund large enough to send a 15-
man team south by train. The team
members don't want to go if they
have to go by automobile.
And the reason they want a 15-
man team is because the S.P. will
knock the rates down to 13 bucks
apiece, going and coming and with
berth.
There has been talk of joining
hands with the Cal delegation so that
it wouldn't be necessary to send so
many down, but nothing has yet
come of it. If the fellows don't get
together pretty soon on the situation
they will be out of the meet alto
gether, since the eligibility list must
be in tomorrow. The meet, one
which Stanford usually enters, will
be held Saturday afternoon.
SWIMMING IS BACK
THIS WEEK
The powerful Indian swimming
team, one of the strongest Stanford
has ever had, they tell me, takes on a
pretty tough team Friday afternoon
in Encina Pools. Fullerton J.C., from
that Southern California area that
produces so many great athletes,
brings up an outfit to take on Nort
Thornton's squad that has the repu
tation of being tfie strongest in the
southern section of the state this
year.
Many of the members of the team
diddle around with the L.A.A.C.
swimming and water polo teams
when they're not competing for their
school, and you have to have some
thing on the ball to get by on the
Angels Club.
It will be a close meet, that's a
cinch, although Thornton should be
able to put together a team that will
beat the southerners.
Saturday afternoon the Indians
again compete, this time against
U.C.L.A., and although the Bruins
aren't up to dear old U.S.C. in
paddling power this year they will
have a fair-to-middling aggrega
tion.
All in all, the Stanford swimmers
will have a pretty lively time this
week-end. And Coach Thornton is
especially anxious to have a crowd
out to have a gander at his boys, so
why not come around and watch the
team work? They put some pretty
good races on in a swimming meet,
as anybody that has seen one will
probably tell you. It will be your
next to last chance to see the squad,
because there will be just one more
meet here, that with U.S.C. April 2.
SAY NOW. LOOK AT
THE BASEBALL TEAM!
Now that the baseballers have
socked away three conference games
in a row, and are leading the league,
it will bo good stuff to mention when
Stanford last won a California In
tercollegiate Baseball Association
title. In 1931, with the great Dan
Johnson pitching, the Indians put it
across, but they haven't been able
to do it since.
The team was coached by Harry
Wolter, of course —he's a real vet
eran. having been here since 1923.
Three wins and no losses for the
Cards, two over Santa Clara and
one over St. Mary's, puts them in the
percentage lead in the league. They
take on the Gaels again today, on
the Sunken Diamond, and they're
not going out there to lose.
If there's any team on the campus
that needs support, that has been
without a good showing of students
for a long time, it's the baseball team.
