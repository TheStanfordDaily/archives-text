# Card Ruggers May Win Title In Cal Battle
## Stanford Team To Meet Golden Bear Invaders Here Next Saturday 
### 
Results of the annual "Little Big
Game" between the Stanford and
California rugby teams will decide
two championships. These two
great teams —termed by some as the
two greatest on the coast—will meet
in the Stanford Stadium this coming
Saturday at 3 o'clock.
A win over the Golden Bears will
give the Indians complete domina
tion in both the intercollegiate con
ference and the California Rugby
Union conference. On the other
hand, if the 15 men from Berkeley
come through with a victory, it will
mean Cal's predominance in the in
tercollegiates and a tie-up in the
C.R.U.
Cards Reach Top
Last Saturday the Cards put them
selves on top when Captain Joe
Vigna and the trusty toe of Wayne
Richardson went to work, coming
through with a shining victory over
the Olympic Club, a heretofore un
defeated team.
The Bears last week took the
U.S.C. Trojans to camp to the tune
of 8-4. Two weeks before the Indians
lost, 3-0, to the southern boys. Stu
dent spirit is high «n the campus at
Berkeley, and it is expected that a
good-sized delegation from Cal will
be down on the Farm for the game.
Seconds To Meet
In a preliminary game to start at 2
o'clock, the Indian reserves will bat
tle the California seconds. Yesterday
afternoon the Stanford second string
downed the Cal Frosh, 10-6, in a
heated battle. Stars of the game were
Bill Barkan, who made two tries,
and Bob Sengstack, who scored the
first Stanford field goal of the season
to tack on the four points that gave
the Indians the game. Both Barkan's
tries were made through the Cal
scvum with half of the Berkeley
team hanging on to him.
