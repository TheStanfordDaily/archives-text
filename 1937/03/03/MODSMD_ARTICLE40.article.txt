# Papooses Work On New Attack
## Frosh Quintet Develops Strong Offense for Cal 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the Papoose
basketball team really lived up to its
classification as a basketball team
for the first time in two weeks, dur
ing which semi-disastrous fortnight
they sustained their first losses of
the season, to Cal Frosh and Santa
Clara Frosh, and barely eked out
wins over Galileo and Piedmont
Highs.
The Papooses practiced a new
type offense yesterday which has the
stuff. Mentor Gorter believes, to turn
the trick in the third game of the
series with the Cal Cubs, to be play
ed Friday night. Getting this in their
noggins, the first and second string
scrimmaged, with the baskets' nets
taking a hrSrrific beating, the Pap
ooses being plenty hot.
Coach Wytze is having a wee bit of
trouble picking out a forward to be
Ted Lyon's running mate. He has
four men, all just about equal in
ability, to choose from, and at pres
ent he is very undecided as to his
starting line-up for the Cal game.
The quartet under sci'utiny includes
Staehle, Oakford, Huddleson, and
Leckie.
Friday night's game, besides being
the season's closer, will decide the
Little Big Series, each team having
already taken one game.
