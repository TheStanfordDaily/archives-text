# Cal Cagers Sharpen Knives To Skin Cards
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
University of California's casaba
coach, Clarence Merle Price, is out
to win this Friday night's encounter
with Stanford's championship out
fit here in the Pavilion, no matter
what.
And this in spite of the fact that a
Golden Bear win won't make the
slightest improvement in their posi
tion in the league standings.
In the first place, the Bears have
n't lost all four contests in the annual
series with Stanford since the two
schools started their basketball re
lationships back in 1912. That, ad
mittedly, would be a rather nice
record for Nibs to maintain.
May Finish Last
But there's another, and more
practical reason for Mentor Price's
thirst for victory. For if Cal loses to
the Cardinal Crushers, and U.C.L.A.
executes an upset against U.S.C. next
Friday, the Berkeley institution will
be forced into a tie with the Uclans
for the Southern Division cellar spot.
And that, since Price has had the
Bears under his tutelage, has never
happened before.
It may be that Nibs will start Bob
Duffy at forward against the Stan

fords in place of Bob Carlisle. Duffy,
who has been an in-and-outer all
season,' scored 14 pbints in 14 min
utes in California's Monday night,
57-43 slaughter of the Athens Club
of Oakland.
Indians Intact
Down here on the home courts,
Coach John Bunn expects to have
the greater part of his first string in
tact for the Friday night play.
Art "Stork" Stoefen, however, was
sent to the hospital again with a re
currence of the stomach ailment that
almost kept him out of the U.S.C.
games. It is doubtful that he will
play.
Jack Calderwood, though, is out
of the hospital, his poison oak pretty
well cleared up. But he won't be in
the best of shape for Friday, and
very likely won't see a great deal of
action.
