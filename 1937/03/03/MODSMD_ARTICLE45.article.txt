# Moraga Nine Plays Varsity Here Today
## Wolter's Team Improving With Every Start 
### ART ALLEN 
A Stanford baseball team, which
was expected to be but a slight im
provement over last year's varsity,
plays its fourth conference game on
the Sunken Diamond here this after
noon at 3:15 o'clock against St.
Mary's. This team has not only play
ed 100 per cent better ball than was
expected, but eiiUiia this game lead
ing the California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association with three wins
and no losses.
Two of the victories were scored
over Santa Clara, and the third last
Monday over St. Mary's by a con
vincing 13-3 margin. In their eight
starts this season, the Indian nine has
dropped only two, and these only by
one-run margins.
The entire infield has functioned
in grand style: Captain Holman on
first, Dick Tam on second, Georgie
Farrel on short, and Leonard Linde
on third have turned in many in
fielding gems and numerous double
plays. Reliable Leo Heagerty, at
catcher, is on the road to all-con
ference catching honors, aided by a
rifle arm and a big bat. Wally de
Witt in right field is the surprise of
the season, hitting at a terrific .727
clip. Glenn Hamilton and Dick La-
Franchi are excellent fielders and
they have been getting these hits
when they were ineeded most.
On the mound, Furman, Griffin,
Paine, and Weiershauser are the big
four of a well balanced nine-man
pitching staff. Weiershauser will
likely start today against "Lefty"
Flanagan of the Gaels.
