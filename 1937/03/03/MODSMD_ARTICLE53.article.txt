# Kayoed Coach
## 
### 
MYRON SCHALL, who until last summer
was Stanford's boxing coach, turned out
fine teams.
In diplomacy, Myron Schall turned out less
fortunately. For in an inter-B.A.C. controversy
with General Director Thomas A. S'.orey, boxer
Schall went down for the count, and a year's
leave of absence with half pay. Bluntly, that
means dismissal. More bluntly, that means
"fired."
The reason for Dr. Storey's action was pub
licly announced as "personal differences,"
though actually publicity was lacking on the
subject. Schall just disappeared.
Now, "personal differences" can mean a lot
of things. In this case, it was essentially that
Schall's ideas of what should go on within
the B.A.C. ring differed somewhat from Dr.
Storey's ideas. Result, Schall's ideas were
knocked out.
Still, as the Stanford boxing team loses match
after match this year, the matter of a kayoed
coach comes to attention, though first it should
be understood that recent boxing relapses are
not in any way attributable to Harry Maloney,
who lately has been handling the sport. Ma
loney says outright he's too busy to give boxing
its just attention.
The point is that for rather obscure reasons
Stanford is minus a boxing coach. While inter
est in the sport as an intercollegiate activity
mounts (3000 people saw California defeat Stan
ford 10-1 last Thursday), Stanford lets it slip to
mediocrity, and stumbles along without even
adequate coaching facilities.
Stanford must have either:
1) A new boxing coach
2) Myron Schall back.
Dr. Storey says he can agree to nothing but
the former.
Many boxing enthusiasts would favor num
ber two.
They see Schall, as the ex-navy middleweight
boxing champion who after war service came
to Stanford, a man somewhat beyond college
age, to graduate with four years as intercolle
giate boxing champion behind, and an econ
diploma in hand, then to become Harry Ma
loney's assistant in boxing, and later coach.
They see Schall as the navy fighter — and
they're usually a pretty tough lot—who didn't
use profanity. They saw him as a Christian
man, pastor in a small local church, when not
teaching boxing.
Boxer and preacher! What a combination!
One that Stanford, perhaps, should again have
in its boxing rooms.—G. F.
