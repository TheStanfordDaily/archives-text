# Oglers Ostracized

THE lecherous males who inhabit Stanford
University and make life one long insult for
innocent women will not ogle under University
sanction, by God!
Dinged by the Union Board yesterday on the
recommendation of Dean Culver was the idea
of putting benches on the newly completed
promenade to the Cellar entrance.
The proposal was made by John Gunther,
who dishes out ciggies and talk to the biggies
over the cigar counter. "People," he reasoned,
"like to sit in the Union. With spring here, why
not let them sit in the open air?"
No reason at all. But then Mr. Gunther
doesn't know what degenerate wretches are
Stanford men, who would make their eyes
v/ork v/hile their feet rest.
It isn't a question of benches outside the
Union. Not at all. It's a question of certified
purity in-heart. For Stanford women, on reli
able authority, don't like to have flight
piped.

Time was, in the days of the lustful rough,
when even the leather chairs in the Cellar
lobby were not chairs but sinks of iniquity.
The women, who had never heard of the other
entrance running past the barber shop, were
forced to run a blockade of fiendish eyes as
they sidled in, side-saddle, for morning coffee
and afternoon coke.
It was truly a spectacle of decadence without
parallel south of Third and Howard or since the
orgies of Lucullus.
And now Mr. Gunther would again make the
campus eatery a visual rapery!
He would put in benches to filter out the
plankton feeders of Stanford's underworld, so
they might drowse lecherously in the sun.
No! No! A thousand times uh-uh.
For Stanford women do not like to be ogled,
they don't. And the Union Board will not have
them ogled, it won't!
