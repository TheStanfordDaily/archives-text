AN INCIPIENT Fascist-Ku Klux Klan movement
seems to be under way at Stanford, with one stu
dent appearing regularly on the Quad these mornings
with a sheet over his head. That the movement seems
to be lacking a consistent philosophy, though, is evi
denced by the fact that the gentleman occasionally
stops and removes his shoes.
The bed-ridden Fascist does not stop on signal and
offers no explanation of his actions, though rumor has
it that he is a Phi Bete and drinks vodka. To many
people this explanation may seem sufficient.
A Fiji has i*eceived two letters within the past
couple of weeks that were stamped "Missent to San
Qucntin."
More than 50 per cent of the smoke-ups sent out
this quarter were distributed among Roble women, ac
cording to Ruthie, the Roble telephone and sewing
machine girl. Ruthie knows all about smoke-ups, from
keeping the wires so hot, she thinks.
i"|N THE other hand, Mrs. Leona 8., who knows a
great deal about many things emphatically, and
seems to be in charge at times, has attributed the dis
grace directly to the ineffectual enforcement of quiet
hours.
So effectual intellectual enforcement is now under
way. Boxes have been placed in every corridor for the
girls to turn in names of violators of shhh. Offenders
are summoned before the committee of five, which is
a committee of five members, and given lock-ins, in
order to keep the girls from taking their noise down to
the movies, or to the Cellar, or up to the City, and
return.
Latest menace to be removed was of a particularly
vicious nature.
A Pi Phi pledge was apprehended, red-handed and
blue-blooded, at 6 o'clock in the morning for chew
ing peanut brittle too loudly.
Punishment was as usual, but if she breaks her
jaw, they'll have to shoot her.
