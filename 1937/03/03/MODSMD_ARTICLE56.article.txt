THHE happy thought that this is the last week of The
Daily this quarter is mingled with the happy thought
that next quarter will be the last one in Stanford for
Our Hasher. After three years of turning out columns,
not all of which smelled as badly as this one, Our
Hasher will disappear from the earth forever, I hope,
at the end of next quarter. If some of the people who
say that they read this column think it would be worth
while to collect some of the columns that do not smell
so badly as this one into a little book with illustrations
by great Artist Gist, Gist and Gist, I might see fit to
collect those works, which, by our own admission, are
the works of art and are great perceptual truths on
Campus life and lore.
If enough of those people who say that they read this
column would be willing to pay maybe foh bits for
such a chronicle, and would tell me what works were
worth reprinting, Gist and I might start working on
the project over spring vacation. Well, we think we
might.
