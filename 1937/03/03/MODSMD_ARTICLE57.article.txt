TINCANNKD EDUCATION
Dear Father:
I'm studying hard.
In another two weeks finals will roll up out of
the timeless depths of nowhere and I will sit down and
start to memorize all those notes I took in my pre
scribed courses in the prescribed way, and I will get
out my prescribed books and memorize them as pre
scribed by prescribed administrative law.
All I have to do during finals week is study all night,
stumble to class, pull out a pen with some ink in it
and write down on paper, prescribed by the University
as the proper kind, everything I have memorized dur
ing the last quarter, which won't be much.
* * * *
But (he worst part of it all is that I won't be proving
anything. I won't be explaining to the professors how
much good I got out of their courses and I most cer
tainly won't be proving how much the professors have
contributed toward showing me how to live a fuller,
more understanding 'life which should be the ultimate
aim and object of education. Or shouldn't it?
In fact, I will be doing nothing except writing down
what I memorized as fast as it will flow ofT the end of
my pen. I won't be thinking, I'll be an automaton,
writing. What grade I get in the course will depend
on how well my memory processes work, not on how
well I think.
You probably wonder why I have to memorize.
I can't tell you except that, is the system and to butt the
system is to flunk out, and I've had enough of that.
I'm not being taught how to think; I'm being taught
how not to think. I'm being taught how to act.
I will have several term papers to write, but I won't
write them; I'll just copy them out of books listed on
my syllabi, simply and surely copy down ideas some
one else thought of five, ten, a hundred years ago in
stead of thinking up ideas of my own. And what's
more, I'll have to put foot notes at the bottom of each
page to prove the ideas are not my own.
* * * *
Whether I copy the words correctly or not will de
termine the grade I get.
And so you sec, getting a college education is not a
process that teaches you how to live, but rather a
process that teaches you how to memorize the lid off
the educational tin can.
Whether the stuff inside is worth paying $115 a
quarter for I frankly don't know. I doubt if anyone
knows.
I don't think you're supposed to.
Your son,
Tro
