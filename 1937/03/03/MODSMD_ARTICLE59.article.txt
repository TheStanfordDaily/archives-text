### R. B. JONES 
FROM NAZI PROSPECT to teach
ing political science!
MR. PRIETII, assistant professor
of Poli Sci, lived 8 years in Germany.
While he was there he became in
terested in the diplomatic service,
politics, and history in general, and
therefore took up the study of po
litical science.
During the course of his stay there
he joined the National Socialist
Party under Hitler. Mr. Prieth is
one of two Americans to ever join.
Eight years later he came to Stan
ford.
"I thoroughly agreed with Hitler's
policies at first," he stated, "but now
I am inclined to disagree, especially
on his labor policy."

EVERY STATE in the United
States except seven—he had to get to
those seven, so he rode a bicycle.
JOHN DERN, El Toro and long
distance trackman, made this two
wheeled vehicle his main method of
conveyance before he came to Stan
ford. Wherever he went he took his
bicycle. One day he decided to go to
see the only seven states he hadn't
been in. From Indiana he peddled
his way to find out what all the
states looked like. Down through
Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkan
sas, Oklahoma, and into Texas he
rolled; no wonder he likes to run
long distances!
