# Farm Forum Will Consider High Court
## Students To Hold Debate Tonight on President's Supreme Court Move 
### 
Stanford will hold a "Town Hall"
meeting on the Supreme Court pro
posal of President Roosevelt, with
Thomas S. Barclay, political science
professor, as chairman, this evening
at 7:15 in Room 12, Law Building. A
poll to find the Farm views will also
be held.
Monday the Supreme Court will
probably give its decision on three
important New Deal issues, chief of
which is the Wagner Labor Relations
Bill. The Sumners Bill, enabling Su
preme Court justices to retire at 70
on full pay, awaits the President's
signature.
Foresees Debate
Of the proposal and open forum,
Professor Barclay said, "It seems
probable that an extended debate
will be held on the President's pro
posals, especially in the Stnate. This
is highly desirable, as the issue pre
sented is one of the most significant
during the last 70 years. The place
and significance of the Supreme
Court as a super legislature are now
before the country.
"Many realize that what is called
constitutional law can be fairly ap
praised only in the light of an under
standing of the realities of economic
and social life. The purpose of the
Stanford meeting is to contribute
very modestly to an understanding
of the issue."
Will Answer Questions
Previous to the open discussion,
during which Professor Barclay will
answer questions of the audience,
Fred Alexander and Robert North
will present cases for and against the
case, respectively.
Alexander, a member of Pi Sigma
Alpha and Speaker's Bureau, and
North, varsity debater from Hawaii
and also of the Speaker's Bureau,
both personally believe the sides on
which they will speak.
Any interested person may attend.
