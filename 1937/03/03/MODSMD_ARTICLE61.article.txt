ECONOMIC: HAIRCUT
Question: Apparently out of a clear
sky, barbers in the vicinity of Palo
Alto have raised tht price of a hair
cut from 50 to 65 cents. Is such a
rise in price justified? Do you agree;
if so why, if why not? Critically
evaluate.
Answer: The only thing that I see
about this that can be justified is to
wring our hands and stop getting
haircuts—try the George Washington
style.
Do I agree, decidedly not! How
ever, several principles should b£
borne in mind. If the demand for
haircuts in "inelastic" (suckers will
pay any price) the price will remain
at 65 cents and we'll all be stung.
But if the demand is "elastic" (the
buyer knows when to lay off) con
sumption of these beauty aids will
drop off and barbers will go back to
50 cents. Low wages and long hours
do not seem to be the cause of the
trouble. Maybe cashing checks
brings on "diminishing returns."
To "critically evaluate" could eas
ily be challenged as "malicious in
tent." Putting it mildly, to all bar
bers, we say: "Fie on you!"
