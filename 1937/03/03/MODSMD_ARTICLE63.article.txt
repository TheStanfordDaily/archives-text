# The 						SCRAPBOOK

### Clipped by ALLEN DRURY 
CLARK, CONTINUED
IRON MEN presents two of the
grandest, most realistic sets we've
ever seen —one a bar-room and the
other up amidst the girders atop the
63rd floor of a budding skyscraper.
Norman ("Dead End") Bel Geddes
was responsible, and they were swell
sets. The lead steel worker was en
ticed off a construction job to give
his first performance before a pay
ing audience, and is better than ade
quate. The rest of the cast could be
arrested for non-support, and the
play itself does what is known in the
vernacular as lay a small, yellowish
egg. One guy falls oft girder, an
other kills wife and self, another
goes nuts. Audience mentality (at
least mentally) is about as high.
Suggested title change: "Getting
Geddes' Girder."
NIGHT MUST FALL is No. 2 of
the English murder plays to appear
this season. But it is No. 1 in qual
ity. Here we have a paranoic bell
hop worm his guileless way into an
old battle-axe's household. The old
biddy's sex-starved secretary devel
ops a yen for our hero, despite the
fact that she's uncomfortably aware
that he's murdered one of his hotel's
best lady customers and carries her
noggin around in a hat box. Cute
kid. She doesn't even mind when he
knocks off the old lady. But Scotland
Yard does. Emlyn Williams wrote,
directed, and played the lead, and is
superlative in all three fields, George
Jean Nathan notwithstanding. May
Whitty, as his second victim, tops a
good supporting ca^t.
PLUMES IN THE DUST has been
termed a "distinguished failure." It's
too bad that Henry Hull had such a
poor vehicle and supporting cast.
It's too bad that the author appar
ently had such feeling for Edgar Al
lan Poe that she lost coherency when
she tried to put her thoughts into
words. For in the main this bio
graphical survey of America's great
est literary genius limps and stutters
at a poor pace. Hull is magnificent,
actually achieving in the audience
the illusion that he is a genius, and
in his last scene—dying of delirium
tremens on a hospital cot—he por
trays sheer genius in his own right.
This scene should go down with Mr.
Hull's Jeeter Lester in the annals of
the American theater's great por
trayals.
Despite Phil Brown acquiring a
nose-bleed coincidentally with the
arrival of Alfred Emmanuel Smith in
the theater's men's room, TOVA
RICH ranks as one of the season's
few smash hits. It deals with exiled
Russian royalty in Paris, contentedly
and comfortably serving as valet and
lady's maid to a nouveau riche
couple. Complications arise when
French bankers and Soviet officials
each attempt to get possession of
some four million stone the late
lamented Tsar left in care of the
Grand Duke-valet. The eventual
getting together of Soviet and Pioyal
ist is handled in a way not to tax the
audience's credulity. John Halliday,
fresh from Hollywood, and Marta
Abba from Italy stand out as ex
royalty who seem to have struck
their happiest sphere, and the rest of
the cast offers expert support.

Hull's Jeeter Lester in the annals of
the American theater's great por
trayals.
Despite Phil Brown acquiring a
nose-bleed coincidentally with the
arrival of Alfred Emmanuel Smith in
the theater's men's room, TOVA
RICH ranks as one of the season's
few smash hits. It deals with exiled
Russian royalty in Paris, contentedly
and comfortably serving as valet and
lady's maid to a nouveau riche
couple. Complications arise when
French bankers and Soviet officials
each attempt to get possession of
some four million stone the late
lamented Tsar left in care of the
Grand Duke-valet. The eventual
getting together of Soviet and Pioyal
ist is handled in a way not to tax the
audience's credulity. John Halliday,
fresh from Hollywood, and Marta
Abba from Italy stand out as ex
royalty who seem to have struck
their happiest sphere, and the rest of
the cast offers expert support.

CLARK, CONTINUED
IRON MEN presents two of the
grandest, most realistic sets we've
ever seen —one a bar-room and the
other up amidst the girders atop the
63rd floor of a budding skyscraper.
Norman ("Dead End") Bel Geddes
was responsible, and they were swell
sets. The lead steel worker was en
ticed off a construction job to give
his first performance before a pay
ing audience, and is better than ade
quate. The rest of the cast could be
arrested for non-support, and the
play itself does what is known in the
vernacular as lay a small, yellowish
egg. One guy falls oft girder, an
other kills wife and self, another
goes nuts. Audience mentality (at
least mentally) is about as high.
Suggested title change: "Getting
Geddes' Girder."
NIGHT MUST FALL is No. 2 of
the English murder plays to appear
this season. But it is No. 1 in qual
ity. Here we have a paranoic bell
hop worm his guileless way into an
old battle-axe's household. The old
biddy's sex-starved secretary devel
ops a yen for our hero, despite the
fact that she's uncomfortably aware
that he's murdered one of his hotel's
best lady customers and carries her
noggin around in a hat box. Cute
kid. She doesn't even mind when he
knocks off the old lady. But Scotland
Yard does. Emlyn Williams wrote,
directed, and played the lead, and is
superlative in all three fields, George
Jean Nathan notwithstanding. May
Whitty, as his second victim, tops a
good supporting ca^t.
PLUMES IN THE DUST has been
termed a "distinguished failure." It's
too bad that Henry Hull had such a
poor vehicle and supporting cast.
It's too bad that the author appar
ently had such feeling for Edgar Al
lan Poe that she lost coherency when
she tried to put her thoughts into
words. For in the main this bio
graphical survey of America's great
est literary genius limps and stutters
at a poor pace. Hull is magnificent,
actually achieving in the audience
the illusion that he is a genius, and
in his last scene—dying of delirium
tremens on a hospital cot—he por
trays sheer genius in his own right.
This scene should go down with Mr.
Hull's Jeeter Lester in the annals of
the American theater's great por
trayals.
