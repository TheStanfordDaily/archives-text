### ARCH JENKINS 
Peninsula barbers continued to get into the hair of Stanford men today
as reports of scabbing and non-union activities on the campus became
more prevalent.
Outstanding attempt of the riled roughs to creatc a furore over the
65c for hair-cut, 35c for shave, coup of the local clippers bobbed up at the

Fire House yesterday. While price*
lists haven't been hung up as yet, j
several of the roughest roughs seen j
last night were those who had their j
locks trimmed by four or five fire- j
men who were taking on all comers j
in an effort to force a reduction.
Beared Encina frosh by the j
score, led on by placards and writ- j
ing on the walls of the hall, filled the '
room of one Otto Goldkamp, a [
former butcher's assistant. The ad
vertisements on the walls offered
35c hair-cuts at Goldkamp's barber J
college in Room 210.
"It's news to me," said Goldkamp,
"but if butchering will do me any
good, then I would like to do some
thing about these barber rats. It's
a gyp. all right, but all my friends j
arc hissing and calling me a scab."
At least one Palo Alto shop was j
slicking to a 50-cent rate with a full |
house reported all day despite the j
fact that union men were attempting |
to force the shop into line.
