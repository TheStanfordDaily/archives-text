# Lewis' Union Recognized By U.S. Steel
## Complete Unionization Of Half Million Workers Seen by C.I.O. Leader 
### 
PITTSBURGH, March 3 (UP). â€”
Union leaders predicted today the
complete unionization of the steel in
dustry, which employs 525,000 per
sons, without resort to strike or
violence.
The industry's solid front against
"outside" unions, maintained strict
ly over a 50-year period, ended last
night in the board room of Carnegie-
Illinois, largest subsidiary of United
States Steel and biggest of the steel
producers.
In that room, after two days of
conferencc, the steel workers or
ganizing committee and the steel
company signed a one-year con
tract which recognized John L.
I*ewis' union as bargaining agent
for its members in the corpora
tion's plants. The agreement came
while the industry was prospering,
operating at 86 per cent of ca
pacity.
Tall, soft-voiced Philip Murray,
chairman of the committee, declared
that the agreement paved the way
"for maintenance of peace" and was
a "milestone in the history of labor
relations between the employe and
(he employer."
It was estimated unofficially that
the steel workers organizing com
mittee, in its !)-months drive to
unionize the vast industry, had
recruited approximately 200,000
men, of whom about 40,000 were
l>elicved employes of Carnegie-
Illinois.
Murray revealed that his union
would invite this week all other steel
companies to conferences looking
toward duplicate agreements. He
said that the contract with Carnegie-
Illinois was the "first legiitmate
agreement" made by that company
with an independent trade union.
