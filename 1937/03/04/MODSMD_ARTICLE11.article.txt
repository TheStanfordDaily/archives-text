## 
### 
SANTA MONICA, March 3 (UP).
â€”Donald Douglas raised wages ap
proximately $520,000 a year in his
strike-harassed airplane plant today,
but defied the authority of the Na
tional Labor Relation Board to arbi
trate for his employes.
He insisted the Douglas Company
is engaged only in intrastate business
and is outside federal labor jurisdic
tion. Douglas officials said they
would officially boycott a conference
tomorrow called by Director Towne
J. Nylander of the Labor Relations
Board on causes of last week's sit
down strike. It was said a Douglas
attorney would attend only as an
"observer."
Douglas told his stand and an
nounced a blanket 5-cent hourly pay
raise at mass meetings of day and
night shifts of the plant, world's
largest airplane factory, yesterday.
Non-striking employes inside the
plant cheercd while outside pickets
booed as loudspeakers brought his
words.
