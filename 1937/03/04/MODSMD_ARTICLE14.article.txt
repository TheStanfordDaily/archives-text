# Forum Debates Court Proposal
## Opinion Evenly Divided On President's Issues 
### 
Farm opinion on the Supreme
Court proposal was ecvnly divided
at the Stanford Supreme Court Open
Forum last night at 7:15 o'clock in
Room 12, Law Building.
Professor Thomas S. Barclay,
chairman, opened the mo*eting with
a brief summation of the back
ground, quoting freely from Presi
dent Roosevelt, saying, "The pro
posed change is inevitable if you
follow President Roosevelt's pro
gram to date."
Fred Alexander, proponent of the
proposal, sought to break the hal
low surrounding the jurists, compar
ing, "Many believe the "nine old
men" in the long robes are closely
akin to the medicine men of the In
dian Tribes. Retirement at 70 will
increase the efficiency of any or
ganization.",
But the haphazard method of
treating the situation incensed the
dissenting Robert North. "If you
don't like the way the umpire judges,
the only way to do anything is to
change the rules, not kick out the
umpire. They are trying to call the
shots as they see them."
