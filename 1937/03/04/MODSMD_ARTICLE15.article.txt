# Roth Quits Post As Comptroller To Head Pacific Shipping Group
## Directed Building of Most New Campus Structures 
### JIM HURST 
An engineer at heart, A1 Roth during his 18 years as
Comptroller has planned and directed construction of
most of present-day Stanford outside the original
Quad.
By no means small parts of his work have been
building up the endowment, overseeing investment
policies, organizing the dining hall services, and han
dling general fiscal problems of the University.
But Mr. Roth's greatest interest has lveen in the
actual conceiving and constructing of buildings, lakes,

roads, athletic equipment—all in ac-<
cordance with an integrated plan to
create a well-balanced university.
When Mr. Roth came here in 1919,
leaving his law practice in San Fran
cisco, few of today's buildings were
standing.
Few Dorms
The only dormitories were Roble,
Sequoia, and Encina. Since, Mr.
Roth has built Toyon, Branner, La
gunita, and the Women's Union. En
cina Commons was added during his
administration.
Athletic facilities have seen a de
cided growth in these 18 years, such
structures having been added as the
Stadium, Pavilion, Women's Gym,
B.A.C. building, and an addition to
the Men's Gym. The golf course,
Angell Field, and the Sunken Dia
mond are recent additions.
Campus publications have been
benefited by construction of two
Press buildings and enlargements of
the Daily shack.
Designed Amphitheater
At the moment under construction
are the amphitheater, Memorial
Theater, and Cubberley Education
Building. Mr. Roth's pet among
these is the amphitheater, which he
conceived and designed personally.
Practically any afternoon he may be

residence district existed when Mr.
Roth started comptrolling. In this
connection he initiated the present
system by which professors may
borrow money from the University
for building their homes and pay it
back over a long period.
More Water
Water supply for keeping the cam
pus green and potentially for drink
ing purposes has been augmented by
the building of Felt Lake reservoir
and an enlargement of Searsville
doubling its capacity.
No University - managed dining
halls existed in 1919. Mr. Roth took
over the concessions then operating
and organized the present dining
halls, including Encina, Roble, La
gunita, the Union, and the Cellar.
Built System
Last year, when Stanford got per
mission from a San Jose court to
invest in common stocks, Mr. Roth
hired an investment expert on full
time to take care of investing the
University's endowment.
The whole present system of finan
cial control has been built up since
Mr. Roth took over the comptroller
ship. In 1919 there was a business
manager, with an office in San
Francisco. Mr. Roth moved the office
to ,the campus, set up the present
system with different departments
under assistant comptrollers.

Built System
Last year, when Stanford got per
mission from a San Jose court to
invest in common stocks, Mr. Roth
hired an investment expert on full
time to take care of investing the
University's endowment.
The whole present system of finan
cial control has been built up since
Mr. Roth took over the comptroller
ship. In 1919 there was a business
manager, with an office in San
Francisco. Mr. Roth moved the office
to ,the campus, set up the present
system with different departments
under assistant comptrollers.
An engineer at heart, A1 Roth during his 18 years as
Comptroller has planned and directed construction of
most of present-day Stanford outside the original
Quad.
By no means small parts of his work have been
building up the endowment, overseeing investment
policies, organizing the dining hall services, and han
dling general fiscal problems of the University.
But Mr. Roth's greatest interest has lveen in the
actual conceiving and constructing of buildings, lakes,

roads, athletic equipment—all in ac-<
cordance with an integrated plan to
create a well-balanced university.
When Mr. Roth came here in 1919,
leaving his law practice in San Fran
cisco, few of today's buildings were
standing.
Few Dorms
The only dormitories were Roble,
Sequoia, and Encina. Since, Mr.
Roth has built Toyon, Branner, La
gunita, and the Women's Union. En
cina Commons was added during his
administration.
Athletic facilities have seen a de
cided growth in these 18 years, such
structures having been added as the
Stadium, Pavilion, Women's Gym,
B.A.C. building, and an addition to
the Men's Gym. The golf course,
Angell Field, and the Sunken Dia
mond are recent additions.
Campus publications have been
benefited by construction of two
Press buildings and enlargements of
the Daily shack.
Designed Amphitheater
At the moment under construction
are the amphitheater, Memorial
Theater, and Cubberley Education
Building. Mr. Roth's pet among
these is the amphitheater, which he
conceived and designed personally.

Roth started comptrolling. In this
connection he initiated the present
system by which professors may
borrow money from the University
for building their homes and pay it
back over a long period.
More Water
Water supply for keeping the cam
pus green and potentially for drink
ing purposes has been augmented by
the building of Felt Lake reservoir
and an enlargement of Searsville
