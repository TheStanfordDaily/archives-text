# Legislature Splits Over Court Plan
## State Senate Votes Down Resolation 21-14 As Lower House Approves 
### 
SACRAMENTO, March 3 (U.R).â€”
Adoption of a resolution by the Sen
ate memorializing Congress to op
pose President Roosevelt's judicial
program in regard to enlarging the
Supreme Court tonight brought the
legislative debate over the national
administration's policies to an end.
The upper house members argued
for more than three houx's before
passing the resolution of Senator
Andrew Schottky opposing the Su
preme Court reorganization. The
vote was 24 to 14. Two Republicans,
Senators Jerrold Sea well and Chris
Jespersen, joined with the minority,
while one Democrat, James J. Holo
han, voted with the Republican ma
jority.
Action of the Senate today left the
bitter discussion of national affairs
in a draw, the Assembly yesterday
having adopted a resolution em
phatically endorsing the President's
stand. The vote in both houses
chiefly represented the partisan
makeup of their memberships.
In the course of senatorial debate
the usual authorities were cited to
bolster points emphasized by speak
ers. Chief Justice Marshall, Grant,
Abraham Lincoln and more mod
ern figures, such as ieading lawyers
and jurists of the nation, were freely
quoted. The opposition of Hiram
Johnson, California's senior member
of the United States Senate, to pro
posed changes in the judiciary sys
tem played a prominent part in the
discussion.
