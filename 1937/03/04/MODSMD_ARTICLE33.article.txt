# Drinkers Strike For Nickel Beer
## Sit-Downers Protest High Cost of Drinking 
### 
JOLIET, 111., March 3 (U.R).—Forty
sit-down strikers protesting the high
cost of beer went on a water diet
in Anton Grohar's beer tavern on
Woodruff road today.
Their dissatisfied toast was:
"Nickel beer or none."
Anton said he was sorry, but the
Will County Tavern Owners' Asso
ciation had upped the price to a
dime, and a dime it will have to be. 1
So the sit-downers sat stolidly on j
the stools and waited for the asso- i
ciation to change its mind. Mean- :
while they drank water.
The sit-downers ate most of An
ton's, pretzels and popcorn the first j
night of their siege. It might have
been a total loss, but Anton is a
power to be reckoned with in Will |
county politics, and he has his tal- .
ents.
He drew a glass of beer—regular j
14-ounce size—slapped it on the bar j
and stood off to admire. As 40 pairs ;
of eyes watched greedily, he raised
the glass to his lips and drained half I
of it. He smacked his lips and j
sighed:
"Ah, that's good beer."
"I'll give you a nickel for a glass
like that, Tony," offered Joseph
("Smokey Joe") Seeley, strikers'
spokesman.
Anton shook his head.
"Well, give us some water then."
Anton grinned and served—water.
