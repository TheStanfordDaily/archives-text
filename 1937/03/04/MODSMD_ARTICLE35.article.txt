| Scoring its fourth straight confer-'
i ence win, ihe Stanford varsity base
i ball team took the St. Mary's Gaels
i 9-4 here yesterday afternoon. The

I gle batter, amassing three runs
j without a hit.
Merrill, his successor, was touched
| for runs in the second and third inn
j ings. Then in the first of the fourth
the sole St. Mary's barrage was fired:
j a walk, a single, and a hit batsman
j scored on Merrill's double. The lat
j tar took third and scored on an out
| field fly.
Linde Hits Triple
Stanford came back with a pair of
' runs in the last of that stanza, as
| Hanna and Heagerty scored on
I Linde's triple. Another pair of runs
J were driven in by deWitt and Hea-
I | gerty in the sixth.
i Rasmussen, who started, received
II the victory credit. Coach Wolter re
j placed him with Paine in the fifth;
! Howie loaded the bases with one out.
Verne Johnson then came in to pitch
and fofced Boehle to hit into a

double play, Linde to Heagery to
Holman. From then on only three
St. Mary's players reached first base,
two on hits, one on a walk.
