# Rider Will Swim In N.C.A.A. Meet
## 
### 
Dave Rider, Stanford distance ace
who a year ago apparently couldn't
get out of his own way in the water
and this year is being sent to the
N.C.A.A. in Minnesota, will go
through a time trial in the 1500
meters when Stanford's undefeated
varsity swim team faces the strong
Fullerton J.C. team in Encina Pools
tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
Rider, whose story-book rise to
fame in a few months astounded
aquatic, critics, will be entered in the
440-yard freestyle. Coach Thornton
expects him to win the event and
to keep going to the 1500 mark, be
ing paced by frosh distance men
along the way.
