# Wilbur Says Students Just 'Jiggle' Minds
## 
### W. A. MILLIS 
"Most students at Stanford don't
use their minds at all. They just
jiggle them a little each day, and
then turn to more important
things."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur expressed
that criticism to one hundred stu
dents at the meeting of the Stanford
Luncheon Club in the Women's
Clubhouse yesterday noon.
Speaking on "The Ideals of a Uni
versity," Dr. Wilbur said that "the
university is at the very peak of
what we call individualism. Its ideas
conflict completely with tyranny and
dictatorship. The ideal of the uni
versity is freedom for the human be
ing and the human intellect."
Pointing out that in the past uni
versities have been widely respect
ed, Dr. Wilbur said that at the pres
ent time "we are threatened with
bitter attack and are in a less secure
position since we entered into the
field of the social sciences."
In the face "of growing attempts
ir. this country to surround and
limit the universities," I)r. Wilbur
urged that there he complete pro
tection for the rights of academic
tenure and academic freedom.
"We have to be careful," he
added, "that the right of academic
freedom is not abused by faculty
members who discuss topics on
which they are not thoroughly
prepared."
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur said
that "the university can survive all
attacks upon it because it is the
greatest of human institutions. We
must keep it free from influences
that will diminish its value. Our
functions as university men and
women must be to keep it going at
the highest level to the shrine of
truth and intellect."
