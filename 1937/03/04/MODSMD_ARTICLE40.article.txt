# Bunn To Use Four Seniors In Cal Game
## Quade, Robertson, Moore, Turner, Luisetti Will Probably Start Friday 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Friday night will be Senior night
on John Bunn's champion Stanford
basketball aggregation, in the fourth
ynd final game of the annual series
with California here in the Pa
vilion.
Every senior on the squad will see
plenty of action, and it may be that
the starting line-up will be four
filths seniors, come Friday eve, since
the game that night will be the last
the team will play at home, and for
the seniors will be their last per
formance before the home crowd.
Scrambled Outfit
Coach Bunn is seriously contem
plating starting a rather scrambled
outfit, and indicated yesterday that
he might have Friday's line-up look
ing somewhat like this: Senior Bill
Quade and Senior Sparky Robertson
at forwards, Senior Howie Turner at
center, and Senior Dinty Moore and
Junior Hank Luisetti at guards.
That bunch would be ideal in sev
eral ways for the last Cal encounter,
for not only would it permit every
last senior on the squad to start the
last home game, but it would better
enable Hoopin' Hank Luisetti to pro
tect that still badly bruised knee of
his.
Total May Suffer
For, although Hank's point total
will very likely be cut down some
what from what it would be if he
played in his old forward spot, Coach
Bunn realizes that that knee is going
to be a very considerable Stanford
asset when the Cards take on the
Northern Division champs a couple
of weeks hence.
Another possible line-up due for
consideration is that consisting of
Turner and Robertson or Luisetti,
forwards; Phil Zonne, center; and
Cap'n Moore and Heath or Luisetti,
guards. In the event that this quintet
takes the floor, however. Bill Quade
will see plenty of action before the
night is out.
Zonne Appears
Bob Zonne, who dislocated his
shoulder in the Santa Clara game
two weeks ago, showed up at prac
tice for the first time since that
time, yesterday, appearing with his
left arm bound to his side with what
looked to be about 20 yards of tape.
It is doubtful that Art Stoefen, who
is still harassed by his stomach ail
ment, will see a great deal of ac
tion, and it is almost certain that
Jack Calderwood, though his poison
oak is pretty well cleared up, will
not play at all, as he hasn't been to
practice for almost two weeks.

plating starting a rather scrambled
outfit, and indicated yesterday that
he might have Friday's line-up look
ing somewhat like this: Senior Bill
Quade and Senior Sparky Robertson
at forwards, Senior Howie Turner at
center, and Senior Dinty Moore and
Junior Hank Luisetti at guards.
That bunch would be ideal in sev
eral ways for the last Cal encounter,
for not only would it permit every
last senior on the squad to start the
last home game, but it would better
enable Hoopin' Hank Luisetti to pro
tect that still badly bruised knee of
his.
Total May Suffer
For, although Hank's point total
will very likely be cut down some
what from what it would be if he
played in his old forward spot, Coach
Bunn realizes that that knee is going
to be a very considerable Stanford
asset when the Cards take on the
Northern Division champs a couple
of weeks hence.
Another possible line-up due for
consideration is that consisting of
Turner and Robertson or Luisetti,
forwards; Phil Zonne, center; and
Cap'n Moore and Heath or Luisetti,
guards. In the event that this quintet
takes the floor, however. Bill Quade
will see plenty of action before the
night is out.
Zonne Appears
Bob Zonne, who dislocated his
shoulder in the Santa Clara game
two weeks ago, showed up at prac
tice for the first time since that
time, yesterday, appearing with his
left arm bound to his side with what
looked to be about 20 yards of tape.
It is doubtful that Art Stoefen, who
is still harassed by his stomach ail
ment, will see a great deal of ac
tion, and it is almost certain that
Jack Calderwood, though his poison
oak is pretty well cleared up, will
not play at all, as he hasn't been to
practice for almost two weeks.
Friday night will be Senior night
on John Bunn's champion Stanford
basketball aggregation, in the fourth
ynd final game of the annual series
with California here in the Pa
vilion.
Every senior on the squad will see
plenty of action, and it may be that
the starting line-up will be four
filths seniors, come Friday eve, since
the game that night will be the last
the team will play at home, and for
the seniors will be their last per
formance before the home crowd.
