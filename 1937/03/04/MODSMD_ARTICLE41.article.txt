# Frosh Trackmen Ready for Hears
## 
### 
Cardinal frosh trackmen will just
be getting organized when they meet
S.F.U. first-year men in San Fran
cisco Saturday morning. Ineligibil
ity is still wracking the squad with
five or six key men still out, but
the team as a whole is in much bet
ter shape than it was last week when
it tangled with San Mateo J.C.
While S.F.U. is somewhat of an
unknown quantity, Bill Ellington,
Farm mentor, was optimistic today
that the Cards would have a well
balanced squad and would show well
Saturday.
Dick Simpson, ace hurdler, who
has been out with the flu, will be
back in suit to add strength to the
team. Sprinters are still lacking,
with Curtis the only outstanding
man in the 100 and 220 as yet. Roth
well and Doble will enter the quar
ter, and Ferguson should shine in
the half.
Strength in the field events rests in
Brown and Wulff in the high jump,
and Anderson in the shot, discus,
and javelin.
Barely organized and hit by sick
ness and ineligibilities, the Frosh
were overwhelmed by the powerful
San Mateo J.C. team last week
75-46.
