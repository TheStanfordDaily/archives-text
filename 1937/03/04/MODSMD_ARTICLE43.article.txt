WITH SPRING
COMES TRACK

Basketball, as far as campus fans
are concerned, is finished for Stan
ford after tomorrow night, but the
good old track season is hard upon
us.
Now, track is quite a sport. It's a
collective noun that boasts lots of
different fronts—probably one of its
finest aspects in some people's view
is the fact that when it arrives, so
does spring.
Spring, of course, also has its
points.
But with the start of track com
petition on the Coast, there are
always the pre-season treatises on
possibilities, probabilities, and
prospects for every team, com
piled by practically everyone con
nected with the sport. In the Cali
fornia Monthly for March there
has come out the annual pre-com
petition review of the California
track season written by Coach
Brutus Hamilton. In it there are
explained several things that might
he of interest down here on the
Farm.
Coach Hamilton hopes to have the
great George Anderson back as his
number one sprinter, although he
still has Captain Mushy Pollock to
help out. There is plenty-of question
in every track fan's mind as to
whether the husky Bear will be able
to get out and go like he did two
years ago.

CAN HE DO
9.6 AGAIN?

Apparently the operation per
formed on his knee came out all
right, hut nobody knows yet if he
can step a hundred in his old
style. If he gets below 10 flat he
will be doing a lot better than any
outsider expects right now.
Pollock, a dynamic little guy. has a
great starting burst, but he can't hold
his speed like Anderson. Ray Dean,
Stanford sprinter last year, was good
enough to beat Pollock in the Big
Meet, and as I recall, the time was
very slow. The race was run against
a stiff wind, in something like 10.1
seconds. Pollock came back to beat
Dean in the Pacific Coast Conference
meet, behind U.S.C.'s Foy Draper.

ARCHIE WILL BE
TOP QUARTER-MILER

Archie Williams will, of course,
he the head man in the quarter
niilc field, as well as one of the
chief opponents for the recuperat
ed Anderson in the furlong. Coach
Hamilton figures that California
will be most powerful in the 440
and the mile relay, which means
that he must have something in
the way of quarter-milers over
there besides Williams.
In his article, Brutus named Vet
eran Jim Helmer, and Don Watts
and Elton Weiman, newcomers, as
the other potential threats in the 440.
Watts is a sophomore, won the Little
Big Meet 440 last year in 50 seconds
flat, while Weiman is a junior from
San Bernardino with a mark of 48.6.

HEAVEY SET
FOR MILE

Boh Heavey, he of the large
feet, is counted on right now as the
sole potential winner for Califor
nia in the mile races, but he still
has to get hack to the shape in
which he ran 4:20 in 1935 before
he will he ahle to heat Stanford's
Warren Dixon. As far as that
goes, sandy-haired Ed Burrows
might he a great miler for the In
dians if he can get that ankle
broken last year hack into shape.
It is still very douhtful if Burrows
will run at all. and if he does he
still has to do the two-mile, so his
participation in the shorter of the
two distances is very questionable.
Les Voorhees and Lucas Powe,
over from the 1936 varsity, will be
Hamilton's main threats in the two
mile, with Voorhees as the head man.
Neither one could touch Burrows
last spring, but if Edson can't get
back in shape Stanford will have a
hard time fielding a man that is
much better.
The Bear hurdle forces are just as
far gone as Stanford's, as far as
tried and true men are concerned.
Moore, Fishback, and Fisher are
gone, leaving only Greg Stout to run
both the obstacle races. Stout is a
made-over 440 man who won the
400-meter hurdles title in the P.C.C.
meet last year, his best times have
been 15 seconds flat in the 120-highs,
24.1 in the 220-lows. Stanford has
Hewitt and Oberg, with Hewitt the
only man who figures as much of a
championship threat in the highs.

HAMILTON SEES
WEAKNESS

The Bears, according to Hamil
ton, will have groat strength in the

iiiyli Hid Inroad jumps, hut w ill be
weak in the res! of the field events.
Jacques, Good, and Law are out
for the high jump, all have done <>
feet 4. while there are a couple
of others who have done C-2.
Nutting and Manuel have done
better than 24 feet in the hori
zontal hop, and Kido and Heap are
both good for 2'J feet most any
time, so the Bears will be all right
in that event.
Otherwise, Hamilton is looking for
a good pole-vaulter, a good pair of
weightrnen, and a javelin thrower
who can reach average standards in
those events.
All in all, it looks as though Cal
isn't going to have as good a track
team as last year. Maybe that's
wrong, but just the same, there are
lots of reasons to be wary of making
predictions that they will be ter
ribly strong. Brick Morse, no doubt,
will have them beating the Trojans,
but if they can win over Stanford
they'll be better than I think they
are.
