# Frosh Prepared For Cal Quintet
## 
### 
Stanford's Papooses spent Iheir
last day of practice before the Cal
fracas, which is also the last and de
ciding game of the Little Big Game
hoop series, in making their new of
fense letter-perfect.
And they did, at last. It was a bit
ragged at first, but gradually men
began to move to correct positions
without going to three other places
beforehand.
All did not go well, however. Just
before practice began, Gil Rahn,
steady guard, took a spill, suffering a
sprained ankle. It is not a serious
sprain, according to Team Doctor
Northway, and Rahn will play to
morrow night.
At Cal, the Cubs ax*e resting eas
ily, preparing to start the same quin
tet which took the Papooses to the
cleaners in the second game of the
series.
