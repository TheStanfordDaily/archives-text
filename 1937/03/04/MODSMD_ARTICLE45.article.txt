NO GAMES TONIGHT
It was Kappa Sigma and Breakers
in the intramural basketball cham
pionship game a year ago, and it
will be Kappa Sigma vs. Breakers in
the 1937 championship game tomor
row night immediately after the
Varsity-Cal game.
Last night the two teams finished
their preparatory play: Kappa Sig
seemed to stroll through El Toro 24-
10, while right alterv>ard Breakers
eked away from D.U. 17-15 in as
exciting a contest as has shaken the
old Pavilion in many a season.
Breakers stepped out to an early
but scant lead, with Cacitti and
Munger pitching scores to lead at
half time 12-8. Long of Delta Up
silon rang through three nice field
goals to keep his team in the contest.
Zamloch, D.U. star, was nursing a
rugby injury and was off form.
In the second half, however, the
Breakers' defense slowed, and Kel
logg of D.U. popped in two quick
field goals to bring it up to 15-12.
From then on there was never more
than three points separating the two
teams, the score standing 16-15 for
10 minutes of the last part of the
game as D.U. suppoi'ters screeched
and Breakers men held their breath.
Baskin of Breakers popped in a free
throw with a minute to play and the
club held the ball till the end.
In the other semi-final Acker and
Thompson of Kappa Sigma had a
hot night, and, combined with poor
rebound and shooting work, had an
easy time over El Toro.
The rowmen made 10 points before
the club scored their first, and were
never in danger, although in the sec
ond half Sttojkovich sank three quick
field goals to give the clubmen a
brief prayer.
