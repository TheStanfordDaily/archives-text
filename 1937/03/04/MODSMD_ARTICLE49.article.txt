# Stanford Enters Long Beach Meet
## 
### 
Stanford will be represented after
all in the Long Beach Relays, pre
mier track and field event of the
early-season Pacific Coast schedule,
it was decided yesterday.
A four-man mile relay team of
Ray Malott, Captain Bill McCurdy,
Jack Benian, and Bob Alexander will
make the trip, together with Tom
Montgomery, weightman. The team
is small because of narrow financial
straits and approaching finals, for
which several of Dink Templeton's
brighter luminaries are in bad need
of preparation.
Shining light of yesterday's work
outs was Ray Malott, junior middle
distance letterman, who first defeat
ed Weiershauser in a 49.1 quarter,
and then led Kneubuhl and the rest
of the 220 field home in 22.1. Malott
has had little work up thus far, and
now looms as one of the strongest
links in Templeton's 1987 chain.
