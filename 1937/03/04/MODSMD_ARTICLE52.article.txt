# "Mr. Roth Is a Fine Man"
## 
### 
The other day I went into Comptroller
Roth's ottice very steamed. It was something
about the new theater. I'd write an editorial,
I thought, and I'd say plenty.
So I walked in and tried to act very angry
as I opened my barrage: "Mr. Roth, 1 hear
that . .
A little while later 1 came out but I wasn't
mad any more. 1 was saying, "Yes, Mr. Roth,
that's line."
I wrote the editorial and it was a flop be
cause all 1 could say was that Mr. Roth is a
fine man and the new theater is fine.
STANFORD University loses its able Comp
troller next week when Almon E. Roth be
comes president of both the Pacific American
Shipowners' Association and the San Francisco
Waterfront Employers' Association —thus be
coming one of the most important cogs, if not
the master one, in West Coast maritime labor
machinery.
Despite its grievance for the loss of a power
house personality and competent Comptroller,
Stanford has slight reason to drown the situa
tion in tears.
For years it has been apparent that Roth is
potentially too big a man for comptrollership
alone.
The bonds that held him on the Farm have
been under constantly increasing stress as one
proposition after another, from the state guber
natorial candidacy to the Relief Administration
of the Western States, flooded his way.
But the bonds held despite these tugs, for
Roth loves Stanford for Stanford alone.
Now beckons an opportunity to do more than
control a business or guide a political machine,
a chance to do both in one.
And it's this job that has finally broken the
weakened bonds. But not without sleepless
nights and great thought has Roth decided to
go on, for 18 years of comptrollership made
overnight dissolution of those bonds unthink
able.
First Mr. Roth hoped to work out a compro
mise—spend part time in the maritime adminis
tration post, but still hold on as comptroller.
In his own words he disliked "burning his
bridges."
But the compromise was impossible just as
Stanford's link with huge labor problems such
as Roth will soon face was impossible. It was
one or the other. Roth took the other.
Already has his move been criticized by
those who fail to see the magnitude of the job.
It's a BIG job. Great power lies in his hands,
power to upset ihe whole western labor world,
power to straighten it out in time of upset,
power to make or break millions. He will
handle such maritime catastrophies as the past
San Francisco strike.
With success it's the step to a greater job,
perhaps one near the top in this nation's gov
ernment or finance.
If he wants it he'll undoubtedly reach it.
Not solely because he has a very fine busi
ness brain. Not because he's a fine lawyer,
plus a fine business man. Not because he's a
nice man.
But because Mr. Roth can send angry edi
torial writers out of his office saying:
"Mr. Roth is a fine man."—G. F.
