TF THE St. Patrick of medicine, Paul de Kruif,
i. speaks the truth about the future of socialized
doctoring, America must await "the revolution"
to get adequate medical care.
In his campus interview published yesterday,
Mr. de Kruif finds that medicine and money are
too closely associated for one to achieve its des
tiny without the consideration of the other.
Unless, of course, everything makes a left
turn, sweeping the medical profession into so
cialism along with all phases of modern life
chained to the economic band-wagon.
Which leaves the best part of America just
where it stood before the idea of socialized
medicine was even broached.
For today adequate medical care is restricted
to those who are so poverty-stricken as to be
dramatically poor, spear-heads of the charity
movement, or to those rich enough to buy sci
entific doctoring. The great middle-class, who
shun charity and who haven't the money for
physical repairs, will continue to be medically
forgotten.
The picture is a dark one. And to one point

of view, the present educational drives against
cancer, venereal disease, and tuberculosis do
not lighten it.
For the question immediately bobs up: what
good will these drives do if they cannot be
guaranteed the backing of economically avail
able doctoring?
That the public should be aroused to its
scourges is laudable. But exactly what can the
average man do when the mysterious modern
plagues attack his own body? Can he get the
care propaganda tells him he must have? Or
must he simply be conscious of the fact that
he has a fatal disease, and that he can't do any
thing about it but die?
It seems to us that the fortune being spent
today for popular medical education is being
mis-spent in so far as no machinery has been
erected to take care of those who are diseased.
Cheap medical education is not enough.
Without cheap medical treatment, socialized
or not, for everyone who needs it, education
will breed despair, not health.
Which places this responsibility on America's
doctors: they have committed themselves to a
job, though they are willing to do only half of
it. Medical education is cheap. They must
prove their good will by providing cheap medi
cal treatment.
