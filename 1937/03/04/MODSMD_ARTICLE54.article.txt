# OUR HASHER

TTE WAS not a very big dog. And he liked to play on
the D.G. lawn. And so do the Phi Delts. However,
the dog played with the D.G.'s, while the Phi Delts
play only with Phi Delts.
All this success went to the little dog's head and he
ran out on the street without looking both ways to see
if a car were coming. A car was, very fast. It swerved
to avoid him and stopped. Too late. The dog was
caught under the wheels. He yowled, as the pain shot
up his foreleg. The car's gears ground as they shifted
into reverse. The auto slowly backed off, and the ani
mal limped, screaming, off into infinity.
"Isn't that too bad," said a D.G. hasher.
"Too bad it wasn't a Phi Delt instead," said a D.G.
senior.
For the S.C. basketball game a Beta dialed in a date
and drove her down to the Pav. After the game was
over, the Beta got under way, with his gal on his arm,
only to come out into the open and find the air let
out of his tires.
He discovered, surprisingly enough, that (hose
guardians of law and odor, the B.A.C. Cossacks, had
been responsible. So the next day he presented Al
Masters with a bill for the expense of getting his car
in a presentable shape.
Mr. Masters paid the bill, but not after he got the
explanation from Turgid, the head guard of law and
odor.
'What is this awful stink?" asked Mr. Masters.
"Well," said the campus red, "we saw this guy come
gentrying in with the gal on his arm, and he had a
Los Angeles license plate and we thought he was from
S.C., so we just let the air out of his tires."
After going on at great length about how I was
hoping I could print a collection of Our Hashers in
celebration of the quasi-centennial of the founding of
the University, Our Hasher, and the Lindbergh baby,
I went up to Gilman Gist's office yesterday to see how
my artist collaborator was getting along.
And there was Gilman with his arm in a sling.
"Fer gawsh seks wottsamatter?"
"He sprained it jumping over a fence," said his sec
retary, turning around.
As she turned around I could see she had her arm in
a sling, too.
"I sprained it jumping," she said.
"Oh."
"While playing basketball," she said.
