# BULL SESSION
## BLOODY ENLIGHTENMENT 
### 
was a small bit in the papers yesterday about
a British sailor being beaten on the waterfront by a
couple of men he never quite saw before the fight was
over.
At this late date, however, when the waterfront
strike is old stuff on account of an orgy of sit-down
strikes having sat down on the country, this kind of
news lacks interest. Furthermore, coming from a
preacher like myself, more blather on the San Fran
cisco dock situation would be an old refrain as well as
tedious stuff.
What I do want to point out, though, is that the
newspapers have drawn a sort of veil of delicacy over
labor scraps. Whether or not the syndicated accounts
have actually adopted a hear-no-evil, see-no-evil,
speak-no-evil attitude depends on what impression the
reader gathers from the stories. But at any rate, there
is certainly a lot of dirty wo'rk that never gets into
the papers.

The fatality stories get in print of course, and are
well publicized, but the word "beating" used in minor
incidents is a soft word and somehow never quite pic
tures exactly what went on. A couple of eye-witnesses
to a few beatings have told me that pickets will catch
a man, then a couple will hold him while the rest
punch his teeth out, after which they jump on him.
I saw a friend of mine yanked out of a cab and clubbed
by about 60 pickets. And another man I know who
drove a wagon in the Chicago teamsters strike some
30 years ago had a plowshare, dropped from several
stories up above him, go clear through the wagon not
more than a foot behind his shirttails.
Lest all the virtue seem on one side, I should men
tion that a youth who worked as a Pinkerton guard
during a strike told me about himself and another
Pinkerton man tangling up with some pickets. The
pickets tried to catch them by surprise from behind,
but the Pinkerton boys turned around, knocked one
opponent on the head with a club and then going
after the other picket they smashed his forehead in and
spread the cartilage of his nose from ear to ear.

It may be in effect that I am urging yellower jour
nalism in the matter of reporting labor trouble. At
the same time, the recent war pictures and plays, for
instance the supremely gruesome "Bury the Dead,"
have sickened everybody to the stomach about the
glory of being a soldier.
A little more accurate accounting of what happens
when strikers find a scab, or when National Guards
men "evict strikers from a plant," to use a colorless
newspaper term, might break up the illusion that a
strike is an abstract clash of doctrine, or, at worst, just
a case of boys being boys.
