## RE KAYOED COACH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Accept my congratulations on the
fine editorial in the Daily yesterday
on "Kayoed Coach." It brings into
the open a smouldering fire on the
B.A.C. bench which has lasted al
most a year.
Coach Schall was dismissed by the
honorable and all powerful Dr. Stor
ey on personal hatred almost en
tirely, and in doing so, Stanford lost
one of the finest coaches in her his
tory. Those who have worked under
Myron Schall recognize him as one
of the finest gentlemen ever,to grace
the coaching staff and the team last
year was unanimous in condemning
Schall's dismissal, as were many
prominent alumni. With a co-opera
tive B.A.C. in this worth while sport
and Coach Myron Schall again at
the helm, we may see happier days
in spite of some man's personal
hatred.
