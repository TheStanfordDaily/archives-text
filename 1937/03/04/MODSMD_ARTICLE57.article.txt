# RING IN THE STORK
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As our worthy sports editor was
handing out the orchids Monday
morning, he made the rounds with
his Sideline Slants. But didn't he
get the wrong slant ora slightly
tangent view when he mentioned
everyone from Coach Bunn to Lieth
and Bailly, Inc., and left out "Stork"
Stoefen? Surely our sportscaster
hasn't forsaken his math to bask in
the sportlight of the press.
Stoefen, being a regular in every
game, holding fifth place in the con
ference scoring race, and piling up
13 points Saturday night, second
only to Luisetti's 14, should surely
rate a line oc so. Was Mr. Peterson's
brain a bit cloudy or is it the new
by-word of sports writing to forget
the first string when tossing the
praise?
So long as our sideline columnist
is tossing orchids, flowers too often
bestowed, considering that pansies
can be passed, hollihocks handed, lil
lies loaned, chrysanthemums chuck
ed, flowers flung, ad infinitum (see
Roget), we suggest that our ambi
tious commentator stop short in his
botanical paraphrasing and make a
deep effort to remember just who
plays for the dear old Stanford Red
before he exhausts his supply of hot
house blossoms.
