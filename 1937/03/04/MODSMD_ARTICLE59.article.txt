## FIRST LADY 
### 
The Poli Sci department should
adjourn in a body to see Jane Cowl
in "First Lady," at the Curran. Here
Presidents are elected, treaties pro
mulgated, senators steered, by the
rivalry of two socially jealous
Washington women.
A beautifully just travesty of
"Princess Alice" Roosevelt Long
worth is Cowl's Lucy Chase Wayne,
granddaughter of old President An
drew Chase and wife of the present
Secretary of State. The barbed and
coruscating lines are delivered by
Miss Cowl with a self-conscious in
souciance—or isn't that possible?
Justice Joshed
Party of the second part in the
politico-social feud is Irene Hibbard,
done by Ann Mason, wife of a mori
bund Supreme Court Justice, who
likes to listen to the Whoops family
on the radio for relaxation. The play
hits one of its cycular peaks when
the Hibbards, man and wife, have it
out in His Honor's study.
Top-flight moments are when Lucy
Wayne and Irene Hibbaxd meet over
the teacups to meow at one another.
"Cream or lemon, Irene?" "Lemon,
please. "Oh, that's right, you would,"
is one of the less subtle bits of
sword play.
Hibbard Roomed
Only to keep Senator Keane—the
Boy Senator — from Irene's hooks
docs Lucy push Carter Hibbard for
president, thinking this will draw
Irene to her hated husband. How
ever, highpower journalist Ells
worth T. Ganning of Ganning News
papers, Inc. (circulation 20,000.000)
gets behind the Hibbard movement.
Behind him gets Louella Creevey,
who, as president of the W.P.P.P.—
Women's League for Peace, Purity,
and Patriotism—has 6,000,000 women
behind her, and it looks as if Hib
bard will be elected and Irene will

become First Lady of the Land.
Clever Jane Cowl never once lets
on whether it is going to end happily
ever after or not. And while the
fate of the nation and of its two
first-string female back-biters trem
bles in balance, Senator Keane and
Palmolive - complexioned Emmy
Paige, Lucy's nitce, return from
riding to announce their engage
ment. This.,proves that in Washing
ton the automobile has not replaced
the horse.
Historical Counterparts
Many of the characters were cool
counterparts of historical figures.
Besides "Princess Alice," Judge Hib
bard seems to stand for Justice
Charles Evans Hughes, who once
clamered oIT the bench long enough
to run for president. Senator Tom
Hardwick might be any one of a
number of western grass-root legis
lators. Feminist Creevey is admir
ably typical. Ganning is William
Randolph Hearst for fair — but
younger.
It doesn't offer credits or grade
points, and the syllabus fee is 55c
balcony to $2.75 orchestra, and
there's a flashy cinema next door,
but anyone who comes to Stanford
for a liberal education and fails to
see "First Lady" isn't doing right by
the folks at home. And laughter is
good for the digestion.
