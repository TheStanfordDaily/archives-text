A new world's record for the 400-
yard breast stroke was claimed last
night by an Olympic Club relay team
following a race on the sports car
nival show at the San Francisco Elks
Club. The quartet was timed in
4:40.7.

Under a recent ruling, Maine citi
zens receiving relief work are en
titled to full voting privileges and
'are not paupers."
