# Honor System To Be Taught
## Classes To Discuss Code Before Examinations 
### 
Stanford students and faculty are
going to be further educated in the
Honor Code. That was the decision
reached last, night in the joint ses
sion of Men's and Women's Councils.
The first offensive will be in the
form of letters, now being prepared,
which will be sent to all members of
the faculty. These are to be read
in classes before the forthcoming
exams and will briefly discuss the
history and purpose of the Honor
Code, emphasizing the fact that this
system was put into effect at the
wish of the students.
In order to answer the objection
of fraternity men that they were not
educated sufficiently in the Honor
Code as freshmen, the co-operation
of Pan-Hellenic and Inter-fraternity
boards is being sought to bring the
matter up for discussion in house
meetings. These will be attended
by a member of Men's or Women's
Council or someone else sufficiently
versed in the system.
Encina, Roble, the halls, and trans
fers will not be neglected. Here ed
ucation will be in the form of
smokers, small groups, and sponsor
contacts.
