AND SO
-HE GAVE AWAY HIS CAR!
We could tell you a bughouse fable about the man
who came into our store, bought a pair of our new
chunky gum soled shoes and then went home and
gave away his gar because the new shoes made him
feel like walking. Being very truthful and sedate
citizens, however, we can only tell you that a lot
of chaps are going around kicking themselves in
their southern exposures because it has taken them
so long to discover the kind of shoe service we are
rendering in this man's town.
