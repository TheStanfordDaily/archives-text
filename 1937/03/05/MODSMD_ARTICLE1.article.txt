much of a regular American.
The tall, dark, good-looking sing
er, who is the next Concert Scries

two and was climaxed in 1927 when
he won the First Atwater Kent
Foundation Radio Audition Contest
from a field of 50,000 competitors and
with an estimated audience of 30,-
000,000.
His program will include a mix
ture of gay moderns and classics. By
far his most interesting group will
be his last number, a lyrical satire
on an entire vaudeville program en
titled "Vodvil." This includes: 8:25—
Overture (apologies to Leoncavello);
B:4o—Animal Act (as though some
thing important were about to oc
cur); B:ss—Jazz Singer (slow drag);
I):2o —Harmony Singers (gracefully,
please); 10 —Prima Donna (not too
seriously, but with a bit of regard
for operatic tradition); 10:25 —Hoofer
(let-'cr-go); 10:50—Gloria, Queen of
the Trapeze (not too fast, Mr. Con
ductor); and 11—Curtain.
Rest of Program
Th 3 rest of the program will be
composed of: Prologue to the opera
"I Pagliacci"; Schubert's "Der Dop
pelganger"; "Die Mainacht and
"Vergebliches Standchen," Brahms;
Erich Solff'.s "Venedig."
Debussy's "Beau Soir"; Holmes'
"Au Pays"; Malashkin's "Could I
Express in Song"; Aria, "The Siege
of Kazan," and "Love Song of an
Idiot," both by Mou;,sorgsky, will
compose the second group.
"Free Me from the Bonds of Your
Sweetness," by Eric Fogg; "Sere
nade," by Carpenter; Squire's "The
Old Black Marc"; and Wolfe's "De
Hallelujah Rhythm" will follow the
intermission.
If Wilbur Evans were not a singer
lie would like to be a colonel in the
U.S. Marine Corps; he carries no
luck charms with him; and he likes
nothing better than a good, healthy
steak for dinner. All of which takes
him out of the conventional singer
class and proves that he is very
much of a regular American.
The tall, dark, good-looking sing
er, who is the next Concert Scries
artist, will appear in the Pavilion
next Thursday, March 11, and be
longs to that small but significant
group of young artists who are
springing up over the country a gen
eration after Walt Whitman prophe
sied: "I hear America singing."
