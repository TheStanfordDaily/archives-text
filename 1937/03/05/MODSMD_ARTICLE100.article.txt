### BY DOUGLAS S. WATSON 
Note: Douglas S. Watson, '97, is
considered one ot the foremost au
thorities on early California days, and
as author of several books has be
come widely known for his writing
on the subject. The following sketch
was prepared expressly for The Daily.
TN THE DAYS of long ago, before
J- the Gringo made California his
own, before the days of old, the days
of gold, the days of '49, when Palo
Alto was only the name for a tree
through which the winds of freedom
blew, it was considered great sport
to chase the bears from what is now
the Stanford Campus. The sport is
still held in high esteem but the tech
nique has changed. In those dark
ages when the Mission of Santa Clara
claimed all the land to the southward
of San Francisquito Creek what is
now is the Farm was the scene of the
annual rodeo. Here the herds of
cattle were rounded up and slaught
ered for their hides and tallow. The
matanza or killing ground presented
a busy scene with its yelling, hard
working vaqueros, its bubbling kettles
trying out the fat and swarms of help
ers skinning the carcasses and stak
ing out the green hides to dry. As only
the hides and tallow had a value, the
remains of the slaughtered cattle were
left where they fell. This it was that
attracted the bears that descended
from the westward hills to gorge their
fill.
Don Jose Joaquin Estudillo, an offi
cer of the San Francisco Presidio, saw
in all this a chance too rich in possi
bilities to be missed. He rounded
up ten of his soldiers, all expert with
the lasso, explained his scheme and
that night with the moon at the full,

the ancient sport of chasing the bears
from the Stanford Campus was bom.
A HUGE grizzly feeding content
edly was selected as the first
victim. The horsemen managed their
animals with wonderful skill and
grace. Like an avalanche they swept
down on the startled beast. Part of
the attacking party swerved to cut
off retreat. Don Jose approached, his
lasso whirling above his head. With
unerring aim, the loop swirled
through the air, closing on one of the
grizzly's fore paws. The bear was
jerked upon his haunches, roaring
and struggling. Snorting the horse
backed to keep the line taut, but
with a leap the grizzly made for his
enemy. He had reached within ten
feet when one of the soldiers let fly

for the hind legs. He missed, but
one of his fellows was able to drop
the noose over the victim's head.
Both riders pulled in opposite direc
tions, and the bear rolled to the
ground, biting furiously at the lassos
and uttering terrific roars. During the
melee others of the attackers managed
to get their ropes about the beast; one
gripping a hind leg, another about
the body. Don Jose leaped to the
ground and dispatched the bear with
his knife.
The passage of time was forgotten
in the excitement. When dawn came
the exhausted bear chasers counted
their spoils. The night's work had ac
counted for forty bears, and origi
nated the old Spanish custom still in
force on the Farm.
