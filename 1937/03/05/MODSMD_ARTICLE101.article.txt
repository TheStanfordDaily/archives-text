## ...But Not Too Sharply, Survey Shows

STANFORD men think Stanford
women are "slow." Stanford
women think Stanford men are
"slow."
At least these are the results of a
campus survey taken this week in
which 88 women and 155 men an
swered questionnaires concerning
their attitudes toward sex and the sex
problems facing modern youth.
Nearly all agreed that members of
the opposite sex on the Farm : are not
as "fast" as students at other colleges.
Four per cent of the women and 17
per cent of the men refused to answer
because they lacked experience on
other campi.
"No, Stanford women are not faster
than other college women," one
rough stated. "Since there are more
male students here, the women don't
have to be fast in order to date. They
may act differently, however, when
they get where competition is stiffer."
Another attributed Stanford
women's reserve to "their youthful
ness," and added—"they are prob
ably the most naive group on any
campus."
One woman recommended "sum
mer resort gigolos" in place of stodgy
roughs. Still another felt that "gen
eralizations are dangerous, but then
—so are the men." One answered
concisely, "not faster, just rougher."
Only seven of the 88 women did
not admit necking. But nearly all
qualified their statements with such
phrases as "but only with someone
I really care for" or "only with the
right person."
A Robleite expressed a concensus
of opinion with: "If I truly like and ad
mire a boy, I see no reason for not
kissing him. But why call it 'neck
ing'? It sounds like a set of morn
ing exercises."
WHEN it came to petting, the opin
ions were not so unanimous.
Fifty-seven per cent of the men claim
that Stanford women pet, several
roughs declaring that all will even
tually. But only 28 per cent of the
women admit that they have gone

Sex at Stanford is a delicate subject. But when approached this week with
"confidential" questionnaires, 88 women and 155 men gave hints to general
trends in the campus' "love life"—evidence to the fact that Stanford students,
like adolescents everywhere, are "coming of age" according to the accepted
American stereotype.
Experience in love at Stanford is limited by the great majority to genteel
"necking," the survey showed. Only a fourth of the women admitted "pet
ting" at all, and then usually with a "man we love." Men answering the
questionnaire believed, however, that most Stanford women will "pet even
tually."
The classic generalization that "Stanford students are 'slow' compared to
other campuses" was born out when four-fifths of both men and women
thought the opposite sex behind other college students in "amatory tech
nique and finesse."

the Mark—well, I could be con
vinced," said a freshman woman.
THEN there were 46 other women
who never kiss their escorts on
first dates. "Bad tactics" and "boring"
are two typical reasons offered for
the declination. "It's psychologically
a poor idea and perhaps misleading,"
reported a serious-minded young
lady.
The double standard, long the bane
of modern sociologists and freedom
for-women advocates, appeared when
55 per cent of 147 men asked for
brides without any sexual experience
though only 30 per cent intended to
refrain from premarital relations them
selves.
Some men felt that the husband
needed premarital experience to
make the marriage more harmonious,
but others insisted that both husband
and wife should withhold sex rela
tions until after the wedding.
"Yes," one freshman answered, "I
probably believe in the double sex
standard, but I feel like a hypocrite.
It's the selfish male viewpoint."
Encinamen were inclined to be
more idealistic concerning self-denial
than upperclassmen. Almost half the
freshmen surveyed expected to save
sex experience for marriage, but of
the eating club and fraternity mem
bers only 24 per cent favored com
plete abstinence.
