A date with a Cal man is not
worth $10.
But a Stanford man is a bargain
at this price, thinks Ted Peckham,
organizer ot the "escort company,"
which supplies New York's lonely
ladies with genteel college gradu
ates to show them the bright lights
at $10 an evening.
In a letter to A1 Marsella, secretary
of the Fresno Cal Club, Peckham ex
plained that Stanford men are the
only ones from the West Coast who
know how to act when they get to
New York. Any others are not up to
the standards of his date men.

seldom or with the "men we love."
One Row woman emphatically wrote
"not if I can help it with these terrific
Stanford goons."
In contrast to the admissions of pet
ting, about half the womten ques
tioned said they kiss on first dates,
but only 27 per cent of the men
agreed. Male opinion of the girl who
kisses on a first date was about
equally divided between those who
like her better for it and those who
think less of her. There is a slight
tendency for Hall men to prefer first
date kissers and for Row men to dis
credit them.
"I don't think as much of her as one
who lets you kiss her on the third
date," declared one conservative; and
"apt not to be faithful," was the ver
dict of a disillusioned youth.

On the contrary, the girl who kisses
on first dates was rated "tops," "a
good sport," and "plenty good," by
another batch of roughs. "It's O.K. if
it continues on the next few dates."
One man guaranteed to recommend
her to his friends.
"It all depends on what you take
the girl out for—sex or intellectual
conversation."
Most of the 43 women declared
they don't habitually kiss on first
dates. "It depends on the date," was
a typical answer. "Generally, no. If
I feel like kissing a fellow goodnight
on a first date, I will; if I don't —and
I usually don't—l won't."

A date with a Cal man is not
worth $10.
But a Stanford man is a bargain

good sport," and "plenty good," by
another batch of roughs. "It's O.K. if
