# We Climbed Actorr The Golden Gate
## 
### BY PHIL KLAUBER AND JOHN DERN 
TT WAS that Sunday before Wash
i. ington's Birthday, a warm eve
ning with plenty of moon—the kind
when all plans for studying are
simply out.
Somebody wanted to go to a show
in the City, but that didn't exactly
sound right, and we were stumped.
But all of a sudden that picture of
the bay and Golden Gate Bridge on
the wall began to stand out more and
more vividly. "We ought to go up
and across that tonight, don't you
think?" came a suggestion.
So it was that we climbed into the
car and set off,
We left the car in the Presidio about
a mile from the end of the bridge
and the two of us set out in the
shadows of Fort Scott, flopping on
our stomachs in the grass every time
we saw anyone, as we didn't know
what they'd think of a couple of kids
tramping in a Military Reservation.
We could see the great south
tower looming over us, so it wasn't
hard to find the bridge end proper
after crossing a couple of hills in spite
of the fact that we thought it was
close by when we left the car. It
didn't look too easy in the bright
moonlight, but climbing onto the edge
of the structure from underneath the
roadway, and clinging onto the out
side of the railing for 100 yards out
onto the bridge turned the trick.
It didn't take any time to get out
to the middle, but we had to be care
ful where we stepped, as there were
plenty of holes in the scaffolding, and
car tracks, reinforcing steel, pipe,
lumber, wire, and other construction
gear were lying here and there.
We stayed in the middle quite
a while taking time exposures of the
City, examining the cables, trying to
take pictures by hand flashlight,
watching the boats go underneath,

and just being generally impressed
by it all. It was really a sensation
to be hanging 250 feet above the
middle of the Golden Gate, listening
to the engines of giant freighters as
they pounded up the channel.
The crossing was getting too easy,
so we decided to do the rest of it on
the catwalk up to the Marin tower.
The catwalk is one department where
this bridge had it over the Bay Bridge
—it was of wooden cross pieces with
cleats like a gang-plank, while the
Bay Bridge catwalk is of wire netting,
exceedingly difficult to climb in steep
places.
At the top we again became im
pressed by the size of the job. The
cable saddles are about as big as the
Reserve Book Room, and the tower
is just 40 feet shorter than the Wool
worth Building. Like true tourists
we had to spit 750 feet, and were
taking a picture when the watchman
came out of his house.
Expecting almost anything up
to three year jail terms we were
surprised when he was quite civil,
wanting to know how we got there.
"Came up from Sausalito," was the
answer, to insure our crossing, and
after discussing labor conditions, con
struction, and other topics so fast that
he couldn't get time to get hard about
our climbing on his bridge, we left.
Well, we were down on the
Marin side in a jiffy, and even saunt
ered up to the watchman there to talk
things over with him, again changing
the subject so fast that he couldn't
get a chance to mention our being
there.
A two mile walk, with the last mile
of it done at a trot in order to catch
the 12 o'clock ferry which we could
see warping in, brought us to Sausa
lito, and then back to the City.
It was quite a night!

take pictures by hand flashlight,
watching the boats go underneath,

and just being generally impressed
by it all. It was really a sensation
to be hanging 250 feet above the
middle of the Golden Gate, listening
to the engines of giant freighters as
they pounded up the channel.
The crossing was getting too easy,
so we decided to do the rest of it on
the catwalk up to the Marin tower.
The catwalk is one department where
this bridge had it over the Bay Bridge
—it was of wooden cross pieces with
cleats like a gang-plank, while the
Bay Bridge catwalk is of wire netting,
exceedingly difficult to climb in steep
places.
At the top we again became im
pressed by the size of the job. The
cable saddles are about as big as the
Reserve Book Room, and the tower
is just 40 feet shorter than the Wool
worth Building. Like true tourists
we had to spit 750 feet, and were
taking a picture when the watchman
came out of his house.
Expecting almost anything up
to three year jail terms we were
surprised when he was quite civil,
wanting to know how we got there.
"Came up from Sausalito," was the
answer, to insure our crossing, and
after discussing labor conditions, con
struction, and other topics so fast that
he couldn't get time to get hard about
our climbing on his bridge, we left.
Well, we were down on the
Marin side in a jiffy, and even saunt
ered up to the watchman there to talk
things over with him, again changing
the subject so fast that he couldn't
get a chance to mention our being
there.
A two mile walk, with the last mile
of it done at a trot in order to catch
the 12 o'clock ferry which we could
see warping in, brought us to Sausa
lito, and then back to the City.
It was quite a night!

"It was just a crazy idea"
TT WAS that Sunday before Wash
i. ington's Birthday, a warm eve
ning with plenty of moon—the kind
when all plans for studying are
simply out.
Somebody wanted to go to a show
in the City, but that didn't exactly
sound right, and we were stumped.
But all of a sudden that picture of
the bay and Golden Gate Bridge on
the wall began to stand out more and
more vividly. "We ought to go up
and across that tonight, don't you
think?" came a suggestion.
So it was that we climbed into the
car and set off,
We left the car in the Presidio about
a mile from the end of the bridge
and the two of us set out in the
shadows of Fort Scott, flopping on
our stomachs in the grass every time
we saw anyone, as we didn't know
what they'd think of a couple of kids
tramping in a Military Reservation.
We could see the great south
tower looming over us, so it wasn't
hard to find the bridge end proper
after crossing a couple of hills in spite
of the fact that we thought it was
close by when we left the car. It
didn't look too easy in the bright
moonlight, but climbing onto the edge
of the structure from underneath the
roadway, and clinging onto the out
side of the railing for 100 yards out
onto the bridge turned the trick.
It didn't take any time to get out
to the middle, but we had to be care
ful where we stepped, as there were
plenty of holes in the scaffolding, and
car tracks, reinforcing steel, pipe,
lumber, wire, and other construction
gear were lying here and there.
We stayed in the middle quite
a while taking time exposures of the
City, examining the cables, trying to
take pictures by hand flashlight,
watching the boats go underneath,

and just being generally impressed
by it all. It was really a sensation
to be hanging 250 feet above the
middle of the Golden Gate, listening
