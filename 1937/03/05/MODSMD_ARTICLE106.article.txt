# Figures Don't Lie
## ...And Especially Not About Figures

\\Q«TANFORD women are too fat" —
Ostated a San Francisco merchant
at a recent fashion show when he
was asked to explain why he had
chosen 20 California and only two
Stanford women to model in a fash
ion show.
But in spite of the gooey sundaes
served at the Cellar, the cheese and
cracker, and candy filled stores in
all the dormitories, a home sending
the weekly rations of cookies, the
presence of paid dieticians in the halls
serving regular meals, and the per
centage that drive cars instead of
walking—regardless of the Univer
sity of California's "rugged eastern
foothills" which must be traversed
between classes, the great number
who live in apartments and get their
own meals (when and if) and those
who are forced to commute from
S.F., there is no difference whatso
ever between the Stanford and Cali
fornia women's height and weight,
according to Dr. Helen B. Pryor, medi
cal advisor of women.
When a woman enters Stanford
University, her height and weight
are taken and in addition her width
is measured. These are known as
her physicoanthropometric measure
ments. Dr. Pryor has compared 799
Stanford and 712 California women
and has found that the range of height,
weight, and widths are identical in
the two colleges.
These women were then classified
according to width, that is, in groups
ranging from the very narrow to the
very wide and charts were made.
Thus if a girl is 5 foot 3 inches, 19
years old, weighs 115 and has a nar
row width she of course is not un
derweight even though the average
weight for that height and age is 125.
On the other extreme an 140 pound
lass would not be overweight if her
bust and hip measurements were pro
portionally larger.
Dr. Pryor recommends that Stan
ford women live up to the University
motto "Let the winds of freedom

blow", because each girl should con
sider her individual self in regard to
her reducing policy. Thus if she has
large bones she should see that her
weight corresponds and just because
Rosie Roomate weighs only 102, she
should not attempt to emulate her.
CONTRARY to general belief, col
lege women do grow during
their four years in the university.
The average height of the freshman
is almost the same as the average
height of the senior. Average height
and weights for the four years are:
age, 17; height, 64.75; weight, 124;
age, 18; height, 64.71, weight, 123;
age, 19, height, 64.63, weight, 123;
and age 20, height, 64.63, weight, 120.
Does this mean that the average
woman tends to shrink during her
college days? The answer, of course,
is "No" because this is the story
of many worn,en averaged and not of
the individual who does continue to
show growth although perhaps only
slightly.
And the Stanford woman is not
much different from her Eastern
cousin. Of a survey taken from the
years 1899 to 1921, of 21,000 women
at Smith, Vassar, and Stanford, Vas
sar women were found taller than
Stanford women in 20 out of 22 years,
and Smith superseded the west 14
times, tied in three, and lost to Stan
ford five.
Largest differences occurred in
1908 when Smith's average was only
60.9 inches in contrast to Stanford's
average of 63.5. Average deviation
was only .2 or .3 of an inch.
Manufacturers are becoming more
aware of the importance of the width
weight measurement system, as is
evidenced by the appearance of
shops selling only clothes for larger
women.
So, Stanford women, you're not fat.
To prove it to San Francisco's next
fashion-showists, whip out Dr. Pryor's
width-weight tables, for figures don't

and age 20, height, 64.63, weight, 120.
Does this mean that the average
woman tends to shrink during her
college days? The answer, of course,
is "No" because this is the story
of many worn,en averaged and not of
the individual who does continue to
show growth although perhaps only
slightly.
And the Stanford woman is not
much different from her Eastern
cousin. Of a survey taken from the
years 1899 to 1921, of 21,000 women
at Smith, Vassar, and Stanford, Vas
sar women were found taller than
Stanford women in 20 out of 22 years,
and Smith superseded the west 14
times, tied in three, and lost to Stan
ford five.
Largest differences occurred in
1908 when Smith's average was only
60.9 inches in contrast to Stanford's
average of 63.5. Average deviation
was only .2 or .3 of an inch.
Manufacturers are becoming more
aware of the importance of the width
weight measurement system, as is
evidenced by the appearance of
shops selling only clothes for larger
women.
So, Stanford women, you're not fat.

\\Q«TANFORD women are too fat" —
Ostated a San Francisco merchant
at a recent fashion show when he
was asked to explain why he had
chosen 20 California and only two
Stanford women to model in a fash
ion show.
But in spite of the gooey sundaes
served at the Cellar, the cheese and
cracker, and candy filled stores in
all the dormitories, a home sending
the weekly rations of cookies, the
presence of paid dieticians in the halls
serving regular meals, and the per
centage that drive cars instead of
walking—regardless of the Univer
sity of California's "rugged eastern
foothills" which must be traversed
between classes, the great number
who live in apartments and get their
own meals (when and if) and those
who are forced to commute from
S.F., there is no difference whatso
ever between the Stanford and Cali
fornia women's height and weight,
according to Dr. Helen B. Pryor, medi
cal advisor of women.
When a woman enters Stanford
University, her height and weight
are taken and in addition her width
is measured. These are known as
her physicoanthropometric measure
ments. Dr. Pryor has compared 799
Stanford and 712 California women
and has found that the range of height,
weight, and widths are identical in
the two colleges.
These women were then classified
according to width, that is, in groups
ranging from the very narrow to the
very wide and charts were made.
Thus if a girl is 5 foot 3 inches, 19
years old, weighs 115 and has a nar
row width she of course is not un
derweight even though the average
weight for that height and age is 125.
On the other extreme an 140 pound
lass would not be overweight if her
bust and hip measurements were pro
portionally larger.
Dr. Pryor recommends that Stan
ford women live up to the University
motto "Let the winds of freedom

blow", because each girl should con
sider her individual self in regard to
her reducing policy. Thus if she has
large bones she should see that her
weight corresponds and just because
Rosie Roomate weighs only 102, she
should not attempt to emulate her.
CONTRARY to general belief, col
lege women do grow during
their four years in the university.
The average height of the freshman
is almost the same as the average
height of the senior. Average height
and weights for the four years are:
age, 17; height, 64.75; weight, 124;
age, 18; height, 64.71, weight, 123;
age, 19, height, 64.63, weight, 123;
