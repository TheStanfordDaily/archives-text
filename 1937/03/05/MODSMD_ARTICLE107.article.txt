## SON OF HAN 
### 
BY ITS very nature, Professor La-
Piere's book is written from the
Ivory Tower. Delicate and fragile as
a piece of jade, and quite as valuable
in its way, it is a novel of frustration
and futility whose broader implica-

tions reach far be
yond the ritual-rid
den China it de
scribes.
For his protag
onist the author has
taken Han Te-Lin,
son of a house that
has tried for three
generations to pro
duce a mandarin —
a scholar who has
passed the three tri
ennial examinations
in the Classics and
has had his name
placed on the Gold
en Board, list of
China's greatest
scholars. His father
has failed, his
grandfather before
him; his uncle has

failed. And when the book ends the
thousand hopes and plans that are
to find culmination in him have come
to naught, and the House of Han is no
nearer to producing a mandarin than
it ever has been.
Because he is thinking of his
cousin, Black Jade, Te-Lin lets ink
fall on the official papers and ruins
his first examination. Because his
grandmother insists on his marriage
three years later, he does not even
take the examinations when they

come again. Because his father dies
suddenly, he does not take them the
next time. And as the book ends, he
has just completed a bitterly ironical
parody of the ritual which has always
stood in his way, by going to the city

gate to watch the
scholars set off once
more for the capitol,
eager and excited
as he himself was
twelve years and
more ago.
Essentially a study
of the part the re
strictions of society
play in hampering
the individual, Mr.
La Piere's story nev
ertheless has time
for many brilliant
minor characteriza
tions and a vivid
picture of Chinese
home life. As much
as anyone can, he
has helped us to
understand the Chi
nese mentality—the

intense love of learning, the slavish
dependence upon ritual, the unceas
ing struggle to carry on the family
name. His book forms a third panel
in the composite picture of China be
gun by "The Good Earth" and Mal
raux' "Man's Fate."
It is not a pleasant book, but it is
a very good book, slow reading but
interesting reading. It will be safe to
believe the blurbs. It deserves them.
