# NINE OLD MEN
## 
### Pearson Allen 
CHOICE anecdotes and interesting
details make "Nine Old Men" by
Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen,
authors of the column, "Washington
Mery-Go-Round," an entertaining, if
a bit inaccurate, commentary upon the
Supreme Court.
Typical newspapermen, the au
thors conceal any reverence they
may hold for the Court in their stream
of yarn and gag. Yet pervading the
atmosphere of the book is the feeling
that it is in fun and that despite their
bitter criticism the authors are not
red-hots verging upon Communism,
but inquiring newshawks groping
Washington in pursuit of the mysti
cal force which makes the govern
mental wheels go around.
Conservatives regard "Nine Old
Men" with uplifted brow, but liberals
will find their point of view well sup

ported. Summarizing the Court's up
heaval of the New Deal alphabet
soup, the writers quote United Mine
Workers President John L. Lewis, "It
is a tragic and ominous commentary
on our form of government when
every decision of the Supreme Court
seems designed to fatten capital and
starve and destroy labor."
They conjecture, "Had the Demo
crats had resignations in proportion
to their nineteen years in office, the
law of mathematicians now could
have given them practically five
justices, or more than one half the
bench, but luck and politics, not
mathematics, govern appointments
to the Supreme Court."
Pearson and Allen in "Nine Old
Men" have presented a peeping
tom's version of the scenes behind
American justice. What the book
may lack in accuracy is counter
balanced by its intriguing narrative.
