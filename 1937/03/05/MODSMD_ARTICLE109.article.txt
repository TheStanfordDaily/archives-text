# Chapel In The Limelight

"What we need," scream activity
leaders, "is school spirit."
Which is what?
Certainly it isn't more or less uni
fied yelling, more or less unified cof
fee drinking, or communal dancing
— organized foot-compression by
more or less organized compressors.
These attempts to produce a com
munity expression of community
spirit at Stanford have almost in
variably fallen short.
Perhaps the student body is too
sophisticated to lose itself in mass
endeavor. Perhaps the mass en
deavor is not tailored to fit the stu
dent body.
D. Elton Trueblood, campus chap
lain, believes the latter possibility
to be the probable cause of failure.
And he believes that within the
Chapel, more than on the football
field or the dance floor, is the com
mon denominator of unification.
He points to the type of "lift" re
ligion gives, compares it with the
beauty of the spring and a sunset,
common experiences to all who have
sensibilities, and gives to us a solu
tion for the dis-unity of our com
munal life which he believes to be
a lasting one.
In his book, "The Essence of Spir
itual Religion," is the core of Dr.
Trueblood's theory:
Religion, he has found, is not the
pomp and panoply, differing between
faith and faith, distasteful to some,
and offering a pathological attraction
to others.
Rather, true religion is a common
emotional set, prevailing in everyone
and merely obscured, not differen
tiated, by formality.
That is the kind of religion Dr. True
blood wants to give us.
Even the word "religion" doesn't
quite put over what he means, might
flip the wheels of stereotyped-think
ing into a hopeless negation.
His type of church is one dedi
cated to the elements of faith, which
we need and can't get in the des
perate struggle for other things we
want more.
It is a church of music, of sublima
tion, of "lift," so that our eyes won't
always be in the other fellow's foot
tracks.
His idea is to reclaim Stanford's
church for Stanford students —for one
place to give one thing that will unite
us as no artificiality of our own can
do.
He hopes someday to restrict non
students to the balcony, to pack the
lower floor with those who go here
and work here. To all of them he
hopes to give one thing that the
Stanford campus lacks — unity
through a unified activity.
His idea is worth trying.—B. E.
