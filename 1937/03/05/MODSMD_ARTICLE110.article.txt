# The 						Man Who Carried Umbrellas
## A 						SHORT STORY—by Hunter Hendee 
### 
TT LOOKS," ventured Cyrus Eggle-
J- mont nibbling on a piece of cold
toast, "like it might rain today."
Coming from one as sensitive about
umbrella carrying as Cyrus, that ob
servation might seem dangerous. He
disliked carrying them because he
was small. His smallness together
with an umbrella, he felt, made his
fellow commuters on the 8:05 think
him the person he didn't want to
be —and was; made them think he
had a large wife—which he had.

Experience, however, had taught
Cyrus that the weather really mat
tered little; he carried the umbrella
regardless. For Mrs. Egglemont, Esq.,
realizing the advantage of a husband,
even a small one, took no chances
with hers.
But this time experience proved a
bad teacher; and just how dangerous
the observation really was, Cyrus
was not long discovering.
"Hump,"mumbled the large woman
at the other end of the breakfast table.
She took a piece of soft, golden-brown
toast from the pile before her and
swirled her cup of strong, black
coffee. "That reminds me," she said;
"I have four umbrellas that need
mending. You can take them down
town with you this morning." And
she continued her swirling and her
munching.
"Üb-b," gulped Cyrus, "you say
f-four umbrellas?" If there were any
thing worse than carrying one um
brella on the 8:05 it was carrying four!
"Very little is wrong with any of
them," said Mrs. Egglemont, more
concerned with her toast and coffee
than her husband; "so you'll be able
to bring all of them back with you
this evening; and," she leveled her
eyes off at him imperatively, "don't
forget to bring them back with you
this evening!"

THIS last squelched all hope of Cy
rus' ever explaining to other com
muters why he was carrying four
umbrellas. If he brought them home
again that evening no one would be
lieve that they had gone for repairing.
He was going to suggest that pos
sibly there might be a shop nearer
home that could do the necessary
fixing quicker or cheaper; but Mrs.
Egglemont, he perceived, had en
tirely dismissed the subject as settled
and had turned her undivided atten
tion once more to her food. So with
a sigh Cyrus decided to pursue the
subject no further. Besides, if he
didn't mention it too much perhaps
she would forget about it.
But Mrs. Egglemont was not in the
habit of forgetting things her husband
was to do, and she—more consistant
than experience—ran true to form this
time. She was waiting at the door for
him with all four of them which, after
a hasty peck of a kiss, he took and
started dejectedly on his way. But
he had hardly reached the bottom of
the porch steps, when her stern voice
stopped him. "lust a minute," it said.
"Where is your umbrella?" So he
came back and went away again with
not only four but five umbrellas.
After the 8:05 had arrived, he
scrambled up into the car as nimbly
as his burden would let him. He slid
inside the passageway and into the
the first seat, which, fortunately,
was empty. And he peered out the
window at nothing in particular. But
fellow-commuters were not so easily
avoided, and one familiar voice
laughed, "Expecting rain, Cy?" while
another exclaimed, "Great Scott!
What a lot of umbrellas to keep such
a little fellow dry!" He was the topic
of conversation for what seemed to
him an eternity.
EVENTUALLY, however, even eter
nities end; and so at last this ride
into town ended for Cyrus Egglemont.
But even at the repair shop he
thought he heard the store-keeper
chuckle. So when he got back out
into the street he felt relieved in spite
of the fact that he was still carrying
his own umbrella.
But the gods destined to give Cyrus
more umbrella trouble that day. He
had just finished his usual luncheon
of fruit-salad, milk, and apple pie
and was buttoning his overcoat. As
he reached for his umbrella he heard
a calm, self-assured voice say, "Oh,
no. That's not your umbrella, that's
my umbrella!" Flushing and mutter
ing an apology, he had straightened
up and, embarrassed, explained,
"O-oh, ex-excuse me. This ism-mine
over here." The affair had so upset
him that when he went to the cash
ier's window he had forgotten his
check and had to return to his table
where he had left it—subject once

more to the scrutiny of the ill-en
countered woman.
Cyrus hoped that the umbrellas
would not be fixed when he came to
call for them that evening. However,
almost as if the repair-man, too, were
against him, all four were ready when
it came time to take the 5:30 home.
On the train he found an empty
seat which he seized as quickly as
timidity permitted. He shoved the
paper he had purchased before his

face as a shield and wondered how
many of the 8:05 commuters were
watching him. After a few moments
he noticed that it was the back page
of the classified section he was star
ing at so intently, and he waited
some time before mustering sufficient
courage to turn over to the front page.
SOMEHOW he felt that the woman
next to him was looking at him—
but he wasn't usually afraid of women
he didn't know; so this didn't overly
bother him. Stop after stop went by
and he kept his eyes glued to the
paper before him, listening for the
conductor's odd bark which many
trips on the 5:30 had taught him meant
"Holyoke"—his particular station.
When almost half an hour had elapsed
without comments from familiar, un
welcome voices, he decided to ven
ture a quick glance over the top of
his paper to be sure his station hadn't
been passed. This he did, and in that
quick glance he saw that the woman
next to him was looking intently at
his umbrellas. He wanted to duck
back, but it was too late. He was look
ing into the eyes of the woman he
had so unfortunately encountered at
lunch. Her voice, calm and deliberate
with self-assurance, remarked: "Well,
I see you've had a good day today!"
Which, of course, was hardly the
case.
