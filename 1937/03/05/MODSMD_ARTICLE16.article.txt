# 'First Lady' Star Passes Buck On To Press Agent
## 
### 
Jane Cowl wÂ°n't be interviewed
by The Stanford Daily, but her press
agent will address the whole Uni
versity next Monday in the Little
Theater at 8:00.
Cowl, star of "First Lady," play
ing at the Cunan, was awaited by
friends and would not succumb 'to
the pleadings and chicanery of a
Dippy reporter to capture a few
words direct. "Tell that reporter,"
he heard her tell the doorman, "that
I simply cannot see him. I'm sorry
but I'm in a hurry. I told him so
once before."
It was Miss Mary Ward, press ag
2nt to the actress, who had so in
formed the scribe before the play.
Miss Ward, once p.a. to Eva LeGal
iiennc, will talk to Stanford on the
subject of publicity in the drama.
