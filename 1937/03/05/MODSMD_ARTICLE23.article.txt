# Founders' Day Tickets Out
## Stanford To Pay Tribute By Memorial Program 
### 
University Founders' Day, paying
tribute to those who conceived the
idea of the Stanford Farm and made
it come true, will be celebrated with
a memorial concert by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, in the
Chapel, Tuesday, March 9, at 8:30.
The concert will be open only to
officers of the University, members
of the faculty, and students, because
of the limited seating capacity of the
church. Tickets will be distributed
in the lobby of the Administration
building today from 9 to 5 o'clock.
Students, graduate and undergradu
ate, will receive their tickets upon
presentation of student body cards.
There will be no admission charge.
The first Founder's Day celebra
tion was held May 14, 1891, com
memorating the birthday of Leland
Stanford, Junior. The date was later
changed to March 9, the anniversary
of the birth of Senator Stanford. For
a number of years it was the custom
to have a concert by the San Fran
cisco Symphony as a part of the
celebration, but in 1932 the tradi
tion was discontinued. The coming
concert will revive the custom.
