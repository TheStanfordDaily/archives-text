# Seniors Will Lead Cards Against Cal
## Stoefen Returns To Complete Line-up; Northern Playoff Starts 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Tonight, in their last home performance of the season. Basketball Men
tor John Bunn's Indian charges will come to grips with Clarence "Nibs"
Price's California Bears in the fourth and final contest of the annual Big
Series, here in the Pavilion at <,:15.
The game will also he the last of the regularly scheduled conference
season for both squads, and, although the Cards have already cinched the
Southern Division title, there has been every indication that the Pavilion

will be packed literally to the rafters
for the fourth time this year.
Stoefen Returns
Coach Price and his lads will be
making one last attempt to turn the
trick against Stanford before the
seasonal curtain drops, the Bears
having already lost three straight to
Bunn & Co., and with the latter in
tending to start at least three of the
four seniors on the team, it should
be an even battle all the way.
Bunn has made one change in his
senior team as announced yesterday,
as Art Stoefen, back from another
brief hospital stay, looked mighty
efficient in the practice workout yes
terday afternoon.
Starting Line-up
The starting Stanford line-up, as
amended, then, will probably consist
of Bill Quade and Sparky Robert
son, both seniors, at forwards, Stoe
fen at center, and Captain Moore
and either Hank Luisetti or Phil
Zonne at guards.
As matters stood yesterday, Howie
Turner, who is among those who
will be playing their last home game,
was to start at center. But Coach
Bunn figures that as long as the
lengthy Stoefen is back in harness,
he might as well utilize his 6 feet 4
inches against 6-foot 4-inch Bob
Chalmers, California pivot-man.
Calderwood Out
Howie, though, will see plenty of
action, particularly since Luisetti has
been out since Wednesday with a
slight leg infection. Nothing serious,
but enough to slow him down a
little. Hank's injured knee, how
ever, is rounding rapidly into shape.
Jack Calderwood, the big guard
who has been waylaid for the last
two weeks by a severe case of poison
oak, will definitely not see action,
and will probably not even be in
suit, as the medicos, fearful of fur
ther infection, have forbidden him
to so much as get up a sweat.
DufF.v to Get Chance
For California, the probable line
ups at the starting guns will very
likely include high-score Ray Bals
ley and either Chet Carlisle or Bob
Duffy at forwards, Bob Chalmers at
center, and Bob Herwig and Don
Jensen at guards.
Duffy has shown plenty of stuff in
almost every practice game the Bears
have played this year, but Price has
held him out of the line-up in the
more crucial conference tilts because
the kid blows sky-high when the
going gets tough.
Price, however, has a lot of con
fidence in Duffy, and may give him
his big chance tonight.
Northern Play-off
Meanwhile, as the Cards and the
Bears are having it out down here,
the University of Washington and
Oregon University will cross swords
tonight in the first game of a two
contest series which bids fair either
to decide the winner of the Northern
Division of the Conference or to send
it into a tie.
Both schools are tied for the lead
at this writing.
The winner of the Northern Di
vision title will play Stanford to de
cide the championship of the entire
Pacific Coast Conference, the date of
the three-game series to be arranged
by the schools involved.
