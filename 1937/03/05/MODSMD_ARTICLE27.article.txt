# Planting One-Fifth Finished Around Bowl
## Seating Terraces To Be Covered with Grass In New Amphitheater 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Mother Nature in the guise of
Comptroller A1 Roth is creating an
amphitheater for Stanford — where
commencement will be held in the
beauty and dignity of an outdoor
setting, where the new School of
Drama will have unlimited facilities
of the presentation of pastoral plays,
pageants, and spectacles.
Today one-fifth of the total plant
ing which will transform the drama
tic dirt pile into a wooded "natural"
bowl has been accomplished. All the
trees that were grown locally have
been planted on the sides and slopes
of the theater. Late snows in the
northwest have delayed the delivery
of hundreds of deciduous trees that
are on order. They will bloom late,
and there will be no difficulty in put
ting them in.
Pipes Installed
Pipe lines carrying water to the
sprinkler system that will keep the
grass that covers the slopes green
are being installed. Next week the
seating area will be excavated in
three-foot transverse terraces sup
ported by green boards.
Grass will be planted on the ter
races, and it will be allowed to grow
long to conceal the boards. Special
lawn mowers are being manufac
tured to provide for this growth.
Wood may be placed under the seats
until the soil packs down, but it will
eventually be removed. The portable
seats from the Pavilion will be
used in the amphitheater, and more
will be purchased later.
The great bowl is the gift of Mr.
Howard Frost of Los Angeles. He
donated $65,000 for its construction
as a memorial to his son, Laurence
Frost, who died in 1935 during his
junior year at Stanford.
Students Dig
Transplanting of trees will con
tinue for 30 days. Thoy are placed
on the slope and earth is packed in
around the bases; thus the stadium
is built up, digging is avoided, and
the planting can go ahead more
quickly. Students on NYA are dig
ging holes for the trees on the out
side of the structure. Evergreens are
predominant among the species that
are being used which include bays,
live oaks, elms, silver poplars, de
ciduous oaks, English oaks, labur
nums, and beeches.
