# University Dramatics Will Get New Set-Up
## 
### 
With the opening of the New The
ater late in May and the establish
ment of the new Division of Speech
and Drama in the School of Fine
Arts, a new set-up with regard to
University dramatics will come into
existence.
Under the new system University
and student dramatics will function
as entirely separate units. The plays
now produced every quarter under
the sponsorship of Dramatic Coun
cil will be presented by members of
University dramatic classes, although
they will also be open to other stu
dents.
The financial end of these produc
tions will be handled by the Uni
versity, instead of Dramatic Coun
cil, and the plays will be under com
plete dramatic faculty supervision.
In addition to the quarterly plays,
Little Theater workshop plays will
probably be given every few weeks
using original and experimental
works.
Under student Dramatic Council

control will be the yearly Big Game
Gaieties and the spring musical, and
any other plays they choose to pre
sent. These will be under complete
student supervision, although the
new theater equipment will be
available for their use.
In conjunction with this reorgani
zation, a student committee consist
ing of Dulce Parker, Dick Daugh
erty, A1 Hyman, and Bob Mallett is
considering any necessary changes
to be made in the present Dramatic
Council situation.
