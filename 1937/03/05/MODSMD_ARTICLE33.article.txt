# New Stage Equipment Built On Large Scale
## 
### SUZANNE HAMMOND 
Stage of the new Memorial Thea
ter will be one of the largest school
theater stages in the United States,
according to Dramatic Technical Di
rector Waldemar Johansen, and
therefore all problems of staging in
the theater will have to be met on
a huge and elaborate scale.
To cope with this, one siae of the
stage building will contain a large
workshop holding wood and ma
chinery for scenery construction,
and facilities for scenery painting,
including a paint bridge which con
sists of a slot in the concrete floor
wilh a counter-balance frame to
hold the material for painting.
Costume Room Made
Included in the stage equipment
are also rooms for drafting and de
sign, a costume room in which it is
hoped eventually to make the cos
tumes for productions instead of
renting them as is done at present,
individual dressing rooms, and a
make-up room.
For the stage itself a sky cyclo
rama, 60 feet high by 120 feet wide,
made of a neutral gray cloth, is
planned. Lights and cloud effects
will be projected on this to give the
desired effect.
Collapsible Stage
Also contemplated is a complete
cloth cyclorama, black vclour on
one side and gray terry-cloth on the
other to give different effects. The
terry-cloth will be stippled with var
ious colors so that when lighting in
the primary colors is cast on it, var
ious light and color effects can be
obtained.
A revolving collapsible stage is
also under consideration. This would
be constructed in separate segments
which can be taken apart and used
, as little wagons for transporting

backstage.
Lighting Lquipmcnt
Lighting equipment supplied by
all big stage lighting firms is now
being tested by the illumination de
partment. Lights will be concealed
in the beams of the auditorium, and
the little balconies at the sides of the
stage will contain openings for spot
lights. A special system of counter
balances above the stage will be
arranged so that lights can be put
anywhere desired.
The stage will also be equipped
with 22 counterbalanced lines so that
anything in the way of props and
drapes can be hung on them any
where over the stage.
Small Stage Provided
At either side of the stage arc
"tormenter towers" which can be
moved in to cut the width of the
stage, or to extend it, enabling the
stage to be almost any size. Another
feature is that the main curtain can
be either split in the center or raised
in one part.
With all the equipment of the
main stage available, the little the
ater stage will contain a unit set that
can be arranged in various ways.
This will give the opportunity to
student technicians to carry out their
own ideas in stage design and tech
nical construction.
Students in the stage designing
classes are already doing a great deal
of the planning for the theater in all
phases of the work, including the
cyclorama lighting which is perhaps
the greatest of the problems to be
dealt with.
With the workshop available, a
great deal of the props for produc
tions will be constructed at the the
ater, due to the difficulties in ob
taining props on the Peninsula.

including a paint bridge which con
sists of a slot in the concrete floor
wilh a counter-balance frame to
hold the material for painting.
Costume Room Made
Included in the stage equipment
are also rooms for drafting and de
sign, a costume room in which it is
hoped eventually to make the cos
tumes for productions instead of
renting them as is done at present,
individual dressing rooms, and a
make-up room.
For the stage itself a sky cyclo
rama, 60 feet high by 120 feet wide,
made of a neutral gray cloth, is
planned. Lights and cloud effects
will be projected on this to give the
desired effect.
Collapsible Stage
Also contemplated is a complete
cloth cyclorama, black vclour on
one side and gray terry-cloth on the
other to give different effects. The
terry-cloth will be stippled with var
ious colors so that when lighting in
the primary colors is cast on it, var
ious light and color effects can be
obtained.
A revolving collapsible stage is
also under consideration. This would
be constructed in separate segments
which can be taken apart and used
, as little wagons for transporting

backstage.
Lighting Lquipmcnt
Lighting equipment supplied by
all big stage lighting firms is now
being tested by the illumination de
partment. Lights will be concealed
in the beams of the auditorium, and
the little balconies at the sides of the
stage will contain openings for spot
lights. A special system of counter
balances above the stage will be
arranged so that lights can be put
anywhere desired.
The stage will also be equipped
with 22 counterbalanced lines so that
anything in the way of props and
drapes can be hung on them any
where over the stage.
Small Stage Provided
At either side of the stage arc
"tormenter towers" which can be
moved in to cut the width of the
stage, or to extend it, enabling the
stage to be almost any size. Another
feature is that the main curtain can
be either split in the center or raised
in one part.
With all the equipment of the
main stage available, the little the
ater stage will contain a unit set that
can be arranged in various ways.
This will give the opportunity to
student technicians to carry out their
own ideas in stage design and tech
nical construction.
Students in the stage designing
classes are already doing a great deal
of the planning for the theater in all
phases of the work, including the
cyclorama lighting which is perhaps
the greatest of the problems to be
dealt with.
With the workshop available, a
great deal of the props for produc
tions will be constructed at the the
ater, due to the difficulties in ob
taining props on the Peninsula.
Stage of the new Memorial Thea
ter will be one of the largest school
theater stages in the United States,
according to Dramatic Technical Di
rector Waldemar Johansen, and
therefore all problems of staging in
the theater will have to be met on
a huge and elaborate scale.
To cope with this, one siae of the
stage building will contain a large
workshop holding wood and ma
chinery for scenery construction,
and facilities for scenery painting,
including a paint bridge which con
sists of a slot in the concrete floor
wilh a counter-balance frame to
hold the material for painting.
