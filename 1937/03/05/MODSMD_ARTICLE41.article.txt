# Union Nitery Ready for Use Spring Quarter
## Ex Committee Ends Four Month Discussion With Keeble Plan's Approval 
### 
Final decision this week that Da
vid Keeble of Palo Alto will reju
venute the A.S.S.U. lobby during
spring vacation into an informal
"social room" for talking, reading,
and dancing brought to an end, for
a time at least, four months of argu
ment and counter-argument over the
question of a campus nitery.
President Jim Reynolds, Student
Manager Chuck Fontius, and Pro
fesspr William B. Owens chose
Keeble's plan over those of San
Francisco interior decorators after
the Union Board of Governors had
voted $5000 for construction and
new furniture.
First Nitery Plans
Agitation for a campus night spot
originated with Daily editorials last
November, was taken up immedi
ately by prominent campus leaders.
First proposed was a rebuilt boat
house with dancing and fountain fa
cilities, then an entirely' new place
on the south banks of Lake Lagu
nita. But the Administration thought
such a nitery too expensive to build
when student interest in it was not
guaranteed.
To gauge potential interest in a
nitery, Ex Committee empowered
Cardinals to hold two trial niteries
in the A.S.S.U. lobby with phono
graph music. Jampack crowds
showed up for both, but Reynolds
and others felt too much advance
publicity had been given the trials
to judge them as fair showing.
Petition Circulated
After Christmas vacation, nitery
plans wavered betwen a Union social
room and a Lagunita night club.
Howard Hughes, student architect
drew up sketches of an ideal lake
side place. Bill Ward disturbed Fon
tius' sleep with a petition signed by
200 students demanding that the
A.S.S.U. build a $10,000 "recreation
center" on the lake's bank. The
fact that the A.S.S.U. had insufficient
funds in its treasury, that Dean
Marion Kirkwood of the Law School,
the student body's "supreme court,"
found the petition illegal, put nitery
plans back in the old counterargu
ment rut.
Ex Committee continued to bicker
from meeting to meeting about "in
terest," "atmosphere," or "is it worth
it?" Then, although the Lake fac
tion (ex-Junior Man Chick Fra
nich being prominent) never en

tirely agreed, the Committee's mem
bers decided tu end the four-month
discussion. They asked the Union
Board of Governors to redecorate
the A.S.S.U. lobby for $5000. The
Union Board assented. That was
that.
Social Kouni—Nitery
The new "social room"—A.S.S.U.
offices will be moved upstairs—will
be finished during the first few
weeks of spring quarter. During the
week students can use it for read
ing, card games, bull-sessions, danc
ing until 8 o'clock at night. On spe
cial week-ends the room will be
specially decorated.
