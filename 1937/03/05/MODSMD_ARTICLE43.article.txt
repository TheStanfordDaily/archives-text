# The 						Jolly-up Passes
## 
### 
JOLLY-UPS were generally accepted as social
failures long before anyone thought ot a
suitable substitute. The living groups kept
holding them for want of something better.
Criticism was rampant, but never constructive.
The officers of the Class of '38, however,
balked this year when it came to considering
the annual Junior Jolly-up. A jolly-up, bad
enough in itself, was no way to unify a hetero
geneous junior class.
Unfortunate "machines," overly odorous
sophomore politics, and a dearth of democratic
class functions left the Class of '38 more disin
tegrated at the beginning of its third year than
when it finished its freshman year. Tom Kille
fer, junior president, suggested an all-class din
ner-dance instead of a jolly-up as a unifying
influence.
Killefer's theory that people warm up to each
other better on a full stomach was borne out
Wednesday night. Almost a third of the entire
class —185 juniors—ate a chicken-and-ice-cream
dinner in the Women's Gym, enjoyed a full
hour's dancing afterward with a good campus
orchestra.
The Class of '38 found it could have a good
time. Freshmen, sophomores, and seniors
didn't cut in when a junior man was dancing
with a junior woman. Class politics and petty
schisms were forgotten, at least for a time.
President Killefer and his aides, in an eve
ning, put together many of the pieces of the
Class of '38 jig-saw puzzle. But perhaps as im
portant, the ordinary jolly-up was not the
method they used. —D. B.
