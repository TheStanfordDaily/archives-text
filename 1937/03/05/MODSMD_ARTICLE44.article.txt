# No War for Peace
## 
### 
LAST night Stanford's American Student Un
ion retraced its steps, decided to shelve its
projected proposal to Ex Committee for a cam
pus peace strike.
Whether or not the A.S.U. compromised its
own beliefs in practically agreeing to a mere
Pcace Day Assembly has little to do with the
question.
The threat of Stanford's being in the front
rank of the strikers is definitely dispelled. And
the threat of a strike against war, one of the
more striking incongruities of liberal "idea
promotion," at least will not be realized hare.
Recent cases of labor unrest have come des
perately near civil conflict, and civil v/ar is
conflict, the worst kind of v/ar. Strikes may be
an effective means of obtaining demands, but
striking simply doesn't fit with demands for
peace.
The original proposal of the A.S.U. was to
substitute an anti-war strike for the scheduled
United Student Peace Conference, which was
so successful last year.
For reasons which we cannot fathom, the
A.S.U. cares little about war, per se, but, like
everyone else, will fight for an ideal. A peace
strike, it might answer, is a war to end war.
But the World War was fought on that promise.
All wars are fought, at least superficially, for
ideals.
Which leads us inevitably to this conclusion:
That war is possible for so long as people will
believe things so deeply that a war seems jus
tified.
Peace is so believed. And in the minds of
millions of colleqe students in America today.

it is worth-while lighting lor.
Our point is: II we can believe one thing so
deeply as to fight lor it, we can believe some
thing else just as deeply, even though it be
inherently lalse.
