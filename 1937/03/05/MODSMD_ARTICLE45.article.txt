# What? No Love?

(From the Illinois "Daily lllini")
COLLEGE students don't have the right to
love.
That is the essence ol a statement by Gui
llermo Hall, professor ol social science at Bos
ton University, who maintains that a bank-book
is a necessary accompaniment of a wedding
ring.
Mr. Hall warned his students, especially the
girls, against mixing love and learning. "Col
lege girls," he says, "mature earlier and, to
them, male classmates appear callow and im
mature. In this there is danger to the male
student. He serves only as a stop-gap and a
convenience until the woman finds the man
she wants.
"Meantime, the student is good material for
practice. If he does not know this and allows
himself to get seriously in love with her, then
there will be trouble for him. He should know
that he is not yet ready for such attachments
and will not be ready lor some years."
Be this the case, we've had the wrong con
ception of co-eds all these years. We gentle
men of the old school firmly believed that col
lege for most of them was the happy hunting
ground with the defenseless males as the eli
gible game.
But these new-fangled ideas are always crop
ping up to blast us out of our security. Life is
so uncertain.
