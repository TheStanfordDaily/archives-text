jVTEW LEAVES appear on every hand
New Libe books here, I understand;
Great changes come when someone flicks
Reserve room lighting, late as six.
At The Dippy, cheeks are flushed
Not. because they're 10-page rushed
Nor because they can't say thirty,
Nor because the tabloid's dirty.
Can't find people on the phone;
No one seems to be at home â€”
Out canoeing on the lake.
(Frogs croaking there keep you awake.)
The steam-heat pressure's pretty low;
On agar-agar green things grow;
Yet. it's hot as anything.
I don't know, it might be spring.
VV/HEN winter conies, spring's far behind
May seem to make the thought unkind
That a million longshoremen may'nt bo loth
To turn their talents toward waxing wroth.
Since this is the last chance I'll have before The
Daily folds itself for the quarter, I might as well liquid
ate the last two stories now clogging my very efficiently
arranged and organized H-man card index.
A couple of Phi Delts went up to the Theta house
quite a while ago to see if several Thetas were in.
There were several Thetas in, but the wrong ones, so
the Phi Delts asked if the right ones were around.
"No." said several Thetas, but. you might leave your
cards."
Before the French department just the other day
(imagine) a Delt and an Alpha Sig were standing
ogling at the sweaters and skirts that went filing past,
in the manner that Dean Culver suspicions is inherent
in every Stanford man. However, these gentlemen were
commenting quite loudly in French as to what a bunch
of bags they were.
But then a likely looking femme came along, and
the Delts' tone changed: "Phew, sacre bleu, rootity
toot-too." said he in French. "Wotta babe. I'd sure
like to meet here. What's her name?"
"That's my French teacher," said the Alpha Sig.
She did not ask him to leave his card, though.
