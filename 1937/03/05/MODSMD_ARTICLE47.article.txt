# BULL SESSION
## THIS TIMELESS VOID 
### 
r I I ODAY is the kind of day when all I d like to do is
just sit around in the sunlight and do nothing with
nobody in particular. It's the kind of day when the
editor's cries for copy rankle in my sunburned cars.
But instead of sitting around I must beat my type
writer with a regularity bred of long years of stand
ardization.
A lazy man's burden is the speed with which time
passes. Mine passes all too quickly. I have to rush
along here saving time with such time-saving devices
as a typewriter, rushing along with no particular end
in view.
What I want to know, however, is just why we
should always have to rush around saving time and
getting things done on time and ending up far ahead
of ourselves instead of being even up on fill sides.
If we don't watch out we'll probably get so far
ahead of ourselves we won't ever be able to catch up.
But what can one do with his time when he gets it.
but waste it? We struggle and beat our brains .so that
we can get things clone in a short time, supposedly
because we have something else to do, but when we
start out doing that something else, we have to rush
through that. too. Kind of silly. Id say. Maybe so;
maybe not.
But what I want to know is just why we should try
to snatch a few fleeting seconds from eternity to call
them our own. We never could hope to own these
seconds. Wc never have and never will. Here on earth
man has been crowded into an infinitesimal fraction of
time with an eternity ahead of him and an eternity
behind.
Yet we with all our brains sit down and try to think
up new inventions that will cheat time of its birth
right.
We save for those fleeting minutes—get them—and
they are gone. There's rio method in this sort of mad
ness.
We save for minutes that will never save us, so
about the only thing I can think of is that I'd better sit
back and take it easy, living fleeting moments as they
catch up tn inc. not trying to jump ahead of them all
the lime.
