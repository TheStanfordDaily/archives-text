Offering several good songs
"You're Laughing at Me," "Let's Go
Slumming," "He Ain't Got Rhythm,"
and "This Year's Crop of Kisses"—
Irvint; Berlin's ON 'HIE AVENUE is
a show well worth seeing. With
those crazy Ritz Brothers giving this
musical several shots of their unique
humor, there are belly laughs for
all.
I think that Alice Faye's perform
ance is really more convincing than
Madeleine Carroll's. True, Miss
Carroll is as wistfully beautiful as
ever, but Miss Faye's acting is so
much more sensitive—to say nothing
of the way she can "swing it"—that
she definitely outclasses Carroll,
whose reserved talent should be
used in pieties of a more serious
vein.
And then there is Dick Powell,
sometimes known as "Pretty Pow
ell.' 'You will be surprised how
skillfully Twentieth Century has cut
out most of hit; singing gestures.
Yes, he still sings, but without wav
ing his arms ad nauseam, and that
is an improvement. However, even
if you don't like Powell, you will
like ON TIIE AVENUE.
Expecting the usual glut for the
second feature, I was mildly sur
prised with SEA DEVILS. Although
Victor McLaglen buffets and blus
ters around as usual, you can't help
liking the "fascinatin' monster"—to
quote Mae West. A tale about our
Coast Guard, SKA DEVILS has en
joyable sequences despite owl-eyed
Ida Lupino.
