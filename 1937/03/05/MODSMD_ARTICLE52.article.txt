The Editor, Sir:
May I help to begin the continuous
applause which should be occasioned
by the recent admirable action of
the Interl'raternity Council regard
ing the destruction of student writ
ten material hitherto preserved in
the .student group files?
May i add, likewise, one more rea
son to that offered by the Interfra
ternity Council, namely, the impor
tance of self. I think I would be
sustained by those older and wiser
than myself in stating that univer
sity education is essentially self
education, and the attributes of a
university such as professors and
equipment are merely aids to one's
own approach to self-perfection. It
seems to me imperative to the future
intellectual honesty of the individ
ual, which is equally as important as
good sportsmanship, that he grasp
fully the inestimable importance, not
only of his socio-economic, but also
of his intellectual self; that his work
be his and his alone. The action of
the Interfraternity Council removes
one more obstacle impeding his
progress.
