# IT'S THE PRINCIPLE

The Editor, Sir:
We wish to protest the barbers'
raise of prices of haircuts and shaves.
It was bad enough paying 50 cents
for a usually second-rate haircut,
But limit is reached when 65 cents
is charged. It seems as if the people
around here are beginning to realize
that Stanfordites are just a bunch of
"suckers." First the theaters refused
to give students a rate and special
privileges on the night of the Paja
marino. Now the barbers raise their
prices because they know that, as
usual, we will do nothing but sit by
and say how outrageous it is. If this
goes on, we will be taken in by
everyone who comes along. This is
the time to put a stop to Stanford
students being made "suckers." How
about a two-week boycott of all bar
bershops charging 65 cents? In this
way we shall show our strength as
a body and at the same time shall
not miss for a great length of time
the familiar feel of the barber's clip
pers. If, for two weeks, no Stanford
man patronizes any barbershop
charging 65 cents for a haircut, we
might get some action on the mat
ter. It is not a question of the extra
15 cents, but of the willingness and
unwillingness of our students to be
"taken in." Let's see some action!
Sincerely,
Indignant Frosh
