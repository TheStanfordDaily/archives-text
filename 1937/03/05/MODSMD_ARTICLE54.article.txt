The Editor, Sir:
This is in the form of a letter of
confidence or commendation con

cerning your editorial in the Daily
ot Wednesday, March 3. It would
seem that the case of Myron Schall
has been too long overlooked by the
student body and those of the fac
ulty which it might concern, and we
appreciate your bringing it out in
your editorial. It is apparent that
you are well informed upon the mat
ter, however we would like to add
a few points that you have over
looked.
It seems that Myron Schall, who
was boxing coach at Stanford for
more than ten years, was promised a
raise in salary which was to cover
extra duties which were placed upon
him when Harry Maloney took a
leave of absence last year. It might
also be noted that Myron Schall was
the lowest paid member of the staff,
a man who had nothing to do with
administrative politics and consid
ered by his associates on the faculty
and everyone who knew him as the
essence of conscientious industry.
When he put in a formal petition for
this raise in salary, it was not only
denied but he was given a year's
leave of absence on hall-pay, which
is virtually a dismissal.
There is a certain "Big-wig" in the
athletic administration whose la.it
name begins with Storey who was
the instigator of this dismissal. Could
it be that Doctor Storey would like
to get lid of boxing as a competitive
sport?
Sincerely,
Two Members of the
Boxing Team
