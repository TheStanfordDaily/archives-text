# Hope for Wins in Shot, Two-mile Relay
## 
### 
Five varsity trackmen, headed by
Captain Bill McCurdy, leave tonight
for the Long Beach Relays, set for
tomorrow at the southern city, with
hopes of bringing home the four
man two-mile relay title and a win
in the shot-put.
With McCurdy will be Ray Ma
lott, Bob Alexander, and Jack Be
man, running in the relay, and big
Tom Montgomery, shot entrant.
In pre-season dope, McCurdy was
figured as the man who would be
Stanford's strongest in the half mile,
but Junior Ray Malott has been
turning in some remarkable times to
beat the veteran leader. Last night
he whipped out a 1:21.2 660-yard
win over the captain, which gives
him credit for very fast early season
time.
Monday night Malott beat McCur
dy by two yards in 49.1 at 440 yards.
Coach Dink Templeotn, who will not
go south with the team tonight, fig
ures that the combination of Malott
and McCurdy with the veteran Al
exander and the rising Jack Beman
look to be good enough to win the
event.
Montgomery, six-foot eight-inch
giant with a top mark so far this year
of 48 feet 5 inches, will have his first
test in fast competition. Entrants
from U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and the
smaller southern California colleges
will compete.
