# Frosh Grind Axe for Last Bear Hoop Tilt
## Papooses Show Scoring Punch, Driving Workouts for Season's Final 
### HARRY PRESS 
Don't wait to digest your dinners
tonight, hoop fans, but tear over to
the Pavilion in time to see the start
of the third and deciding game of the
series between the Stanford Pap
ooses and the California Cubs for
which the first whistle is scheduled
at 6:30.
Incidentally, tonight's game is also
the final one of a very successful
season for the frosh basketballers.
Mentor Wytze Gorter, in his first
year as coach, has led his boys to a
record to date of 13 wins and two
losses, which is right fine for a team
that has had more than its quota of
fouls, slapped on by Mister John B.
(for Bugaboo) Injury.
Gorter Drives 'Em
Really heaping the work on the
Papooses, Mentor Wytze has this
week not only co-ordinated the al
ready speedy fast break which has
won so many games for the frosh
into a greased-lightning scoring play,
but has taught his proteges a new
offense.
This new scoring punch, which
has, in workouts, absolutely stumped
the germies, consists in moving the
quintet's two tallest men under the
bucket. Under the Stanford system
of offense play, the center, Siebert, is
already under the hoop when the
team sets up for a scoring play. Then
the guard, usually Anderson, goes
through, coming around the keyhole,
to end up under the basket with
Siebert ready for passes from the
forwards. Watch this work tonight.
Iluddleson May Start
Practice this week has really been
giving the nets a workout. The boys
have been hot on shots, fast-moving,
and accurate on passes. Mentor
Wytze has been having a hard time
trying to decide on a starting for
ward to take the place of Leon La
faille, % who is definitely out for to
morrow night. He has to choose be
tween Huddleson, Oakford, Leckie,
and Staehle. If how a player looks
in practice means anything, then
Huddleson will have his name in the
book. The rest of the starting team
will be Lyon, Siebert, Anderson, and
Rahn.
Coach Bill Higgins of the Cubs
plans to start the same five that
topped the Papooses in the second
game: of the series. At. forwards will
be Captain Dud Morgan and Van
Horn; Biggerstaff will hold down the
center post; and guards will be
Erickson and Bickerton.

Don't wait to digest your dinners
tonight, hoop fans, but tear over to
the Pavilion in time to see the start
of the third and deciding game of the
series between the Stanford Pap
ooses and the California Cubs for
which the first whistle is scheduled
at 6:30.
Incidentally, tonight's game is also
the final one of a very successful
season for the frosh basketballers.
Mentor Wytze Gorter, in his first
year as coach, has led his boys to a
record to date of 13 wins and two
losses, which is right fine for a team
that has had more than its quota of
fouls, slapped on by Mister John B.
(for Bugaboo) Injury.
Gorter Drives 'Em
Really heaping the work on the
Papooses, Mentor Wytze has this
week not only co-ordinated the al
ready speedy fast break which has
won so many games for the frosh
into a greased-lightning scoring play,
but has taught his proteges a new
offense.
This new scoring punch, which
has, in workouts, absolutely stumped
the germies, consists in moving the
quintet's two tallest men under the
bucket. Under the Stanford system
of offense play, the center, Siebert, is
already under the hoop when the
team sets up for a scoring play. Then
the guard, usually Anderson, goes
through, coming around the keyhole,
to end up under the basket with
Siebert ready for passes from the
forwards. Watch this work tonight.
Iluddleson May Start
Practice this week has really been
giving the nets a workout. The boys
have been hot on shots, fast-moving,
and accurate on passes. Mentor
Wytze has been having a hard time
trying to decide on a starting for
ward to take the place of Leon La
faille, % who is definitely out for to
morrow night. He has to choose be
tween Huddleson, Oakford, Leckie,
and Staehle. If how a player looks
in practice means anything, then
Huddleson will have his name in the
book. The rest of the starting team
will be Lyon, Siebert, Anderson, and
Rahn.
Coach Bill Higgins of the Cubs
plans to start the same five that
topped the Papooses in the second
game: of the series. At. forwards will
be Captain Dud Morgan and Van
Horn; Biggerstaff will hold down the
center post; and guards will be
Erickson and Bickerton.
