Grudge Battle
The Fullerton meet will be a
grudge battle of the first order. Last
year the Jaysees nosed out the pow
erful Card frosh and demanded a
meet with the varsity this year.
There are a few members of that
frosh team who are aces on the var
sity this year. They, needless to say,
are determined that last year's loss
will be vindicated.
In today's meet, Winfield Needham
and Don Peterson will be pitted in
the 220-yard freestyle against Bob
Rowen and Devere Christcnsen of
Fullerton.

arc backstroke starters, and Don

Upholding the Cardinal honor on
the springboard will be Roy Winkel
man, tanned Apollo of this year's
Stanford squad.
The Saturday meet will be held in
the short, 20-yard pool to give the
Indians and Bruins a chance to crack

a few Pacific Coast short course
records.

Grudge Battle
The Fullerton meet will be a
grudge battle of the first order. Last
year the Jaysees nosed out the pow
erful Card frosh and demanded a
meet with the varsity this year.
There are a few members of that
frosh team who are aces on the var
sity this year. They, needless to say,
are determined that last year's loss
will be vindicated.
In today's meet, Winfield Needham
and Don Peterson will be pitted in
the 220-yard freestyle against Bob
Rowen and Devere Christcnsen of
Fullerton.
