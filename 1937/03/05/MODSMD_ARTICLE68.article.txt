# Card Nine Faces Heavy Vacation Schedule
## Unbeaten Indians Plan Six Game Tour; Play Tomorrow Meet Kenealley's Seals At 2:30, Sunken Diamond, In Rescheduled Game 
### ART ALLEN 
Four wins and no losses—with that
victory margin Coach Harry Wolter's
men go south for six straight days of
baseball during the vacation week
after final exams. Monday and Tues
day of that week they take on
U.C.L.A.; Wednesday and Thursday
games will be played against U.S.C.;
Friday and Saturday they will be in
San Diego for games with the Ma
rine nine there. The first four games
count in the conference standings. At
present the Indians lead the race;
California is also undefeated in two
starts.
Tomorrow will be the last oppor
tunity for the student body to watch
this surprise team this quarter; Neal
Koneally's Seals furnish the opposi
tion at 2:30 on the Sunken Diamond
in a game rescheduled from the rainy
season.
Figures Favorable
Referring to the averages in an ad
jacent column, it is interesting to
find out why the local nine is win
ning so consistently. The team bat
ting average of .309 is unusually
high; the individual averages of de-
Witt, Heagerty, and Farrell outline
the real punch in the batting order.
The fact that 42 runs have been
scored on 43 hits in four games
shows that the hitting is timely, that
few runners are left on the paths,
and that the Indian pitchers do not
have to press every inning to keep
the opponents out of the run column.
The pitching averages disclose that
all of the pitchers can be depended
upon, an ideal situation for the six
day six-game schedule in the south.
The narrow margin of runs allowed
over earned runs is one way of say
ing that the pitchers are getting ex
cellent support. Heagerty again
shines, having handled 33 chances
without a slip, including throwing
out four runners on the paths in as
many games.
Errors Less This Year
Only nine errors have been com
mitted in these games; last year that
number was frequent in a single
contest. No outfielder has erred as
yet. Holman. Tam, and FaiTell have
played almost spotless ball. In pass
ing it might be said that Linde on
third base has had many chances of
the difficult variety, and that he has
a slightly lower average because he
attempts to cover a larger territory
than the average fielder at his posi
tion.
Two other elements influence this
year's diamond success. One is Old
Man Luck's favor, such as causing
the St. Mary's right outfield grass to
act as a boomerang and making the
Gaels fumble ground balls, rather
than the Indians. The other is the
team spirit; it is a real pleasure to
sit near the Card bench and listen
to the players on and off the field
supporting their team-mates and
riding the opponents.
The coaching staff deserves the
final credit. Coach Woltcr, aided by
Jim Lawson, who has been a great
success in his first year with the var
sity and very popular with the play
ers, has master-minded the attack
without a mistake.

cellent support. Heagerty again
shines, having handled 33 chances
without a slip, including throwing
out four runners on the paths in as
many games.
Errors Less This Year
Only nine errors have been com
mitted in these games; last year that
number was frequent in a single
contest. No outfielder has erred as
yet. Holman. Tam, and FaiTell have
played almost spotless ball. In pass
ing it might be said that Linde on
third base has had many chances of
the difficult variety, and that he has
a slightly lower average because he
attempts to cover a larger territory
than the average fielder at his posi
tion.
Two other elements influence this
year's diamond success. One is Old
Man Luck's favor, such as causing
the St. Mary's right outfield grass to
act as a boomerang and making the
Gaels fumble ground balls, rather
than the Indians. The other is the
team spirit; it is a real pleasure to
sit near the Card bench and listen
to the players on and off the field
supporting their team-mates and
riding the opponents.
The coaching staff deserves the
final credit. Coach Woltcr, aided by
Jim Lawson, who has been a great
success in his first year with the var
sity and very popular with the play
ers, has master-minded the attack
without a mistake.
Four wins and no losses—with that
victory margin Coach Harry Wolter's
men go south for six straight days of
baseball during the vacation week
after final exams. Monday and Tues
day of that week they take on
U.C.L.A.; Wednesday and Thursday
games will be played against U.S.C.;
Friday and Saturday they will be in
San Diego for games with the Ma
rine nine there. The first four games
count in the conference standings. At
present the Indians lead the race;
California is also undefeated in two
starts.
Tomorrow will be the last oppor
tunity for the student body to watch
this surprise team this quarter; Neal
Koneally's Seals furnish the opposi
tion at 2:30 on the Sunken Diamond
in a game rescheduled from the rainy
season.
Figures Favorable
Referring to the averages in an ad
jacent column, it is interesting to
find out why the local nine is win
ning so consistently. The team bat
ting average of .309 is unusually
high; the individual averages of de-
Witt, Heagerty, and Farrell outline
the real punch in the batting order.
The fact that 42 runs have been
scored on 43 hits in four games
shows that the hitting is timely, that
few runners are left on the paths,
and that the Indian pitchers do not
have to press every inning to keep
the opponents out of the run column.
The pitching averages disclose that
all of the pitchers can be depended
upon, an ideal situation for the six
day six-game schedule in the south.
The narrow margin of runs allowed
over earned runs is one way of say
ing that the pitchers are getting ex
cellent support. Heagerty again
shines, having handled 33 chances
without a slip, including throwing
out four runners on the paths in as
many games.
