# Huskies. Webfeet In Title Series
## 
### 
Basketball fives of the University
of Washington and the University of
Oregon will clash this evening in
Seattle in the first same of a two
game scries that may decide the
chsmpionshin of the Northern Divi
sion of the Conference, and also de
cide Stanford's host in the North-
South Conference title series.
Both team are tied for the North
ern Division lead with 10 wins and
4 losses apiece.
If either squad can turn in a double
triumph, that squad will get the title,
undisputedly. But a split series will
tie the Northerners into a knot, ne
cessitating an additional game to de
cide the championship.
And if Washington State College
can take two straight from Oregon
State over the week-end at Corval
lis, the Cougars, who are a game be
hind the leaders, can pull up to cre
ate a triple tie.
In that event, some sort of a
round-robin arrangement will have
to be made to decide Stanford squad s
opponent.

Adolph, Kiefer, sensational back
stroke record holacr, has turned
over. His coach says: "Kiefer is go
ing to lick the world in free-style
just as he did in back stroke."
