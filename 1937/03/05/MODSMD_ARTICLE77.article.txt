# Ruggers Meet Cal For Title Tomorrow
## Wins Will Give Cards C.R.U., College flags Zamloch, Holdridge May Not Play; Richardson, Vigna Indian Threats 
### MATTHEW VAN WINKLE 
Stanford rugby hopes were high
yesterday afternoon as the varsity
rounded off its practice in prepara
tion for its annual "Little Big Game"
with the University of California.
The game will start at 3 o'clock to
morrow afternoon in the Stanford
Stadium and will be preceded by a
tilt between the Stanford and Cali
fornia second strings. Admission to
the games will be 25 cents.
The team has shown marked im
provement in the last two weeks and
should prove a very good match for
the highly touted Bear fifteen. In
scrimmage last night the boys were
executing some very good passes and
the scrum and line-outs showed con
siderable improvement.
Three Wins in One
A win over the Golden Bears
means a three-fold victory for the
Cards. They will have won their
first game from the Berkeley boys in
a good many years; they will become
Intercollegiate champs; and they
will be on top in the California Rug
by Union. On the other hand, if
they lose, it will give Cal the In
tercollegiate title and will make a tie
up in the C.R.U.
With the exception of Archie Zam
loch and Jay Holdridge, who are
temporarily out with injuries, the
Indian team is in good shape for its
tilt. However, both players will

probably see action in tomorrow's
game.
Sccond Team Confident
The up and coming second string
also has hopes of taking a victory
over their opponents. The boys on
this squad are comparatively inex
perienced, but nevertheless play;
heads-up ball.
Following is the tentative Indian j
line-up for tomorrow's game: hook- 1
er, Don Pinnell; front rankers, Jack j
Partridge and Primo Pinnotti; second
rankers, George Ditz and Bill Mac-
Donald; breakaways, Bill Harring- j
ton and 'Marvin Taylor; lock, Wayne
Richardson; scrum half, Carl
Schaupp; first five, Archie Zamloch;
■second five, Joe Vigna (c) or Jay
Holdridge; center three-quarters,
