VARSITY RUGBY CAPTAIN JOE VIGNA, left, main running
threat on his team this year, will lead the Cards against the Bears to
morrow afternoon in the Stadium. Wayne Richardson, right, has
scored half his team's points this year by hooting across penalty kicks
and conversions, will be one of Stanford's best bets tomorrow.
