AH, YES, MR. 8.,
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT
Those who read Campus Opinion in yesterday's Daily got an eyeful of
what my public thinks of me, I guess, because if I correctly interpreted
the gist of what Mr. Buchanan was saying, I was getting a very fancy
bawling-out.
Am I mortified! Mr. Buchanan, your eloquence overwhelms me, I—
well, you leave me speechless, almost.
I apologize most humbly for neglecting to mention Art Stoefen in the
basketball posie-orgy, for I, too, think he's all right as a basketball player.
You know, Mr. Buchanan, when I wrote that I knew there was something
missing, and it has been hurting my sense of correct adjustment since.
Your timely, well-placed little barb, written in virtually scintillating gems
of our language, has eased the tension plaguing my befuddled brain.
To Mr. Stoefen, too, let me tender my apologies. As far as I am con
cerned, he is the best center in the southern division this season, and if he
isn't named on the first team somebody's an awful politician.
But 16 get back for a moment to Mr. Buchanan, there is one thing I
objected to in his article. It isn't so bad to be termed "worthy" sports
editor, even though that word seems to have an unpleasant connotation,
and I don't mind having my cloudy brain being mentioned as such. Being
called a "sportscaster" is excusable, too, although I didn't get that point
about basking in the sportlight of the press. I'm sure there is something
in that statement, maybe if I study it a little longer I will be able to ex
tract its full import.
However, Mr. Buchanan, please don't call me an "ambitious commen
tator," it sends shivers all over me. Every time I hear that word "ambi
tious" I tremble all over —look what happened to Julius Caesar —he got
a knife stuck in him for being that way. What Caesar could do, I can do,
but I don't want to get in on that last act of his.
Best of all, though, is the fact that now I know somebody besides my
parents and the people that are looking for publicity do take the time to
read what I write. You have opened my vistas for me, Mr. Buchanan, I can
look forward to a better life. Thank you, ad infinitum (see Roget).
THEY'RE PLAYING
GOOD BASEBALL
There were perhaps 150 people, maybe just 100, at the baseball game
Wednesday, watching Harry Wolter's team drub the St. Mary's outfit. That
was a fair turnout, but only fair. This is the first year since 1931 that Stan
ford has had a baseball team that looks as though it might win a confer
ence championship, for it now has four wins and no loses in the league.
Such a start deserves support from the students; so when things start
up again around here in baseball after spring vacation, come out to see
the team play. League games between now and the opening of spring
quarter are all down in Los Angeles, during the vacation—two with
U.C.L.A. and two with U.S.C.
Incidentally, Leonard Linde pounded out a beautiful triple in the game
Wednesday, driving home a run; it really was a beauty. Every time any
body gets a hit like that one, one that was too far out for the fielders to
handle, he deserves mention.
At the same time, Wally DeWitt, the husky sophomore right fielder,
who has been going great guns at bat so far this season, had a poor after
noon to collect only one hit in five attempts.'After his first three failures,
Harry Wolter took him aside and told him a little secret that helped him a
lot afterwards.
"When you see the pitcher about ready to let the ball go," said Coach
Wolter, "step back about four inches with your left foot (DeWitt is a
southpaw hitter) without moving your right. When you start to lean into
the swing, your right foot will come down in the correct place, and you
will be far enough away from the plate to avoid hitting the ball on the
handle of the bat." It worked, too.
THEY'RE ALWAYS GOOD
AT FULLERTON
Coach Nort Thornton's varsity swimmers take on Fullerton Junior Col
lege here this afternoon, admission free, giving everybody a golden oppor
tunity to see what should be one of the best tank meets of the year.
The Indians take on U.C.L.A. tomorrow afternoon, too, in another meet i
that should be a sizzler. Thornton wants to have the meet in the 20-yard
tank, so that his boys can set a few new short-course records for the Pa
cific Coast. In particular, Nort will have his boys aiming at the 300-yard
medley mark, now held by Oregon. He figures his team is cinch to break
it, because they did it last week in practice.
MAYBE CAL
WILL WIN
That basketball game tonight, somehow, doesn't have the punch that a
Stanford-Cal game should have.
John Bunn's boys have the southern division all tied up, and the way
most of them feel now, what's the use of trying to beat Cal when it means
nothing, not even in the series, which is also already won.
Cal, too, should have a hard time getting fired up. About all they
have to fight for, outside of the fact that this is a Big Game and as such
engenders tender memories and not-so-tender fighting spirit, is keeping
out of the cellar position, now held by U.C.L.A.
It's just an anti-climax, this game tonight, and chances are it will be a
very mediocre contest. The funny part of it is, the tickets for the game
game were sold out more quickly than at any other time this year. Maybe
it will be a good game, at least the rooters think so.
TAKE IT EASY,
FELLERS
Rugby, too, features a Stanford-Cal game this week-end, tomorrow
afternoon at 3 in the stadium.
It won't be a lazy lagging game, though, like the basketball contest to
night, because whoever wins wilt be the top team in the intercollegiate
conference. Besides that, if Stanford wins it will be the champion of the
California Rugby Union as well, while a Bear win would mean that the
C.R.U. would be all tied up."
The fact that it is a championship game, coupled with the old Card-
Bear rivalry, should make this one of the hardest fought, games of the year
for the ruggers. Drop around to the stadium tomorrow and watch the In
dians, led by Jumpy Joe Vigna, fight for two titles and a Cal win. There
will be thi ills enough, as far as brawn and muscle and bodily contact
are concerned. Peterson
