Stanford's skiers could be the best
in the country with adequate coach
ing and practice, declared Hannes
Schroll, twice champion American
skier, talking to Farm skiers who
attended the intercollegiate meet at
Yosemite last week.
Sitting in the bar, the wiry Aus
trian told Stanford and California
skiers that snow conditions in this
part of California are compai'able to
conditions in any other part of the
world. "Many persons think that
'sunny California' is no place for
skiing, but most Europeans must
travel for 6 to 10 hours to get to the
snow fields."
Schroll predicted that Stanford
and California skiers could conceiv
ably "beat all other United States
teams within three or four years and
enter competition with European
teams."
He explained that no particular
build is required for skiing, stressed
the fact that Stanford students have
"lots of enthusiasm."
Schroll warned, however, that now
is the time to get a team developed,
because other universities are be
ginning to incorporate skiing in the
ranks of their regular sports.
