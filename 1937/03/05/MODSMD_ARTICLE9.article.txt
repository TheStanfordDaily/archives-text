# Roth Worked Way Through As Handyman
## A 						Visiting Fireman From Ukiah, He Played For Farm Jobs — and Won 
### JIM HURST 
In the fall of 1905 a 19-year-old
lad from Ukiah named A1 Roth
registered at Stanford, set up camp
on the second floor of the firehou.se.
He had no money. He couldn't
afford to live elsewhere.
Next week. A1 Roth will take over
presidencies of the Pacific American
Shipowners' Association and the San
Francisco Waterfront Employers'
Association.
But he'll still live across the street
from the firehouse. He likes it there.
Fireman. Hasher
During four undergraduate years
he earned his lodging by helping
guard the campus against fire. In
those days the boys had one ladder
wagon and one hose cart, hauled
them to the scene of the fire by the
man-power method. But they were
either good or lucky—at no time did
fire run wild.
As a dining hall manager Mr. Roth
got his first experience by hashing
at the old Inn (where the Libe now
stands) in his freshman year, and at
Madrono Hall the next three years.
Picked Up Bricks
As a builder, he started in by re
claiming old bricks, knocking off
the mortar with a hatchet for 20
cents a hundred. The bricks he gar
nered from the ruins of the old li
brary which crumbled on the pres
ent site of the Memorial Theater
during the earthquake.
He picked up pocket money by
running the steropticon, predecessor
of the movie projector, for illustrated
class-room lectures, and by painting
white lines on the athletic fields.
No Time for Classes
He cut a lot of classes to run the
movie machine, but nobody kicked
very much.
In fact, earning his way through
Stanford kept him plenty busy. But
he found time for athletics and other
activities.
He was a member of the Stanford
relay team which in 1909 held the
world's record for the mile run with
a live-man squad. In high school he
had set a state record by running
the hundred in 10.1.
Booted the Pigskin
He played on the football team (it
was rugby in those days), and was a
member of the American rugby team
sent to Australia and New Zealand
in 1910.
Membership in Quadrangle Club,
a student-faculty organization, and
Skull and Snakes, upper-class honor
society, were among his activities.
During his graduate years in the
Law School he was elected to Phi
Delta Phi.
Student Body Prexy
In his senior year, 1908-9, Mr.
Roth was student body president.
He was responsible for changing stu
dent affairs from faculty control to
joint student-faculty control, and
later to complete student control.
He entered law school in 1909, and
during his three years of graduate
work was Stanford's Dean of Men
(in those days called Student Ad
viser).
And as Dean
As Dean of Men he met Mildred
Hayes, Stanford Class of '11 and
women's editor of The Daily. In
1912 he went to San Francisco to
practice law, a few months later
married Mildred.
For two years he worked in the
district attorney's office, and for the
following five with a firm of corpo
ration lawyers. In 1919 he returned
to Stanford as Comptroller.
