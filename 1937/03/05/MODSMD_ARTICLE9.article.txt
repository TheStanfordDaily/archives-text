# Roth Worked Way Through As Handyman
## A
						Visiting Fireman From Ukiah, He Played For Farm Jobs — and Won 
### JIM HURST 
In the fall of 1905 a 19-year-old
lad from Ukiah named A1 Roth
registered at Stanford, set up camp
on the second floor of the firehou.se.
He had no money. He couldn't

the mortar with a hatchet for 20
cents a hundred. The bricks he gar

during the earthquake.
He picked up pocket money by

of the movie projector, for illustrated
class-room lectures, and by painting
white lines on the athletic fields.
No Time for Classes
He cut a lot of classes to run the
movie machine, but nobody kicked

In fact, earning his way through
Stanford kept him plenty busy. But
he found time for athletics and other
activities.
He was a member of the Stanford
