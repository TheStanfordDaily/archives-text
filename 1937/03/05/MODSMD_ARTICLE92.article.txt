### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Dick Simpson, star freshman hurdler who has been out recently with the
flu and leisurely sojourns to L«»s Angeles, was hack in shape yesterday, and
promises to do wonders when Stanford Frosh meet S.F.J.C. on Angell Field
at 10 oclock tomorrow morning.
Curtis, who has shown steady improvement in the sprints, should chalk
up a few points in the 100 and 220. Hickingbotham will also run in these
events. ♦

Bill Doble, the strongest frosh
runner on the track, and Rockwell
will run the quarter. Jerry Sparling
ran his first quarter yesterday in
54.5, and may become a regular in
this event, although he will not com
pete tomorrow.
Joining Simpson in the hurdles,
Bill Jess will run the lows and prob
ably the highs. O'Leary will run the
mile, while Ferguson and Dixon will
compete in the half.
History Maker
Ray Brown, bi-oadjumper, prom
ises to go down in Stanford track
history. He hit 22 feet 11 inches last
week, and will be a real threat to
morrow.
Stan Anderson, outstanding field
man for the frosh, is sure to chalk up
points in the discus, not to mention
the shot and javelin, which he heaves
with no little skill. High jumper for
the '39 track team will be Russ
Wulff.
Coach Bill Ellington knows very
little about San Francisco Jaysee
cindennen, but is confident that his
boys are in good shape and will
show up well.
