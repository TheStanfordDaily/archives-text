# Four Years A'Thinkin'...

GAZING at the late paleolithic or
early neolithic or lukewarm
cenozoic caveman drawings on the
marble in the gentleman's room in
the Libe last week, I ran across the
carvings of a middle neolithic spirit,
a world-weary soul shocked and re
vulsed by the artistic fantasies of his
fellow students!
The shocked and revulsed soul's
offering went something like this:
"Gees Grist. This is awful. High
school stuff didn't used to go around
here."
The revulsed soul may be right.
It seems to me that a few years ago,
Stanford was free of these graphic
sublimations, or maybe it was just
that janitors were spryer in erasing
them. Granting, however, that they
are symptoms of an encroaching
lousiness in the body politic, these
adolescent etchings will continue on
the marble despite the fervid pro
tests.
Marble or no marble, drawings or

no drawings, subtle changes take
place in the Stanford student body
from year to year, and are causes
for rejoicings or lamentations in the
bull sessions and The Daily student
opinion columns.
A larger percentage of the stu
dents seem to be drinking, but there
is less drunkenness. The boys in
the back shop of The Daily claim
that staff members are becoming a
lot of lilies and tell wild tales of the
old timers who had mythological
capacities of the walking drains of
prohibition days.
The surreptitious annual bibbling
initiation of Kappa Beta Phi is even
more of an anachronism in its attempt
at artificially organized wassail than
Phi Phi with its funny hats and ties.
Less trouble with lockouts, fewer
Collier Connells, indicate that the
women are getting more sophisti
cated, not so erratic, even if fewer
and fewer, proportionally, join in the
esoteric rites of the Greek letters.

Restoration of the Lower Division
to grace, and the ever-expanding de
mands on student reading time have
resulted in the doubling, quadru
pling, and octupling of the circulation
of the books in the Library. Students
are studying more. But studies are
becoming more complex, more de
partmentalized; conclusions and atti
tudes are less sure, more hazardous.
With the increase in routine matter,
enthusiasm for studies is dropping
off. The old time student with his
.sincere desire to learn is an ana
chronism. With the student's atten
tion turning away from the learning
aspects, the contact between student
and faculty is becoming more formal
ized. Students feel the loss, and
try to organize a student-faculty com
mittee to see if something can't be
done.
Reason for the loss of spontaneity
in education is due to social change;
reason that nothing is done about it
is the social lag of the educational
machine.
HTHE ADMINISTRATION, highly re
-L sistant to change, its learning
stopped when its schooling stopped
20 or so years ago, has no conception
of what is its role in society or, is
still gripped in the mystics of 19th
century science, obsessed with genes
and hormones, when a constipated
social system prevents the necessary
control of those genes and hormones,
and when the University's own fail
ure to educate its students with an
understanding of themselves, the so
cial system, or the genes and hor
mones, obviates any sensible mpve
ment toward the necessary control.
Stanford has political scientists, econ
omists, historians, lawyers, doctors,
and Indian chiefs droning on in their
one hour lectures, assigning parrots
assignments to parrot, answers to
parrot, term papers to parrot. Stan
ford has everyone except educators
in charge of its education.
Loss of spontaneity in education is
paralleled in student activities. The
decline of the glorious extrovert is
only partially bolstered by the emer
gence of the organized activities-par
ticipators-in called the Cardinals. Ma
chines have to take over politics as
the student government becomes
more complex and less interesting.
Everywhere people are going through
motions without understanding their
purpose or why they are going
through them.
In the past, high tuition and various
scholastic barriers have not been
proof against cycles in riotousness
or decadence in undergraduate life.
When the cycles come, the Univer
sity, instead of squarely facing its
own failure to perform the function
assigned it, berates the student body
for failure to play the way it wants
to, and writes on its marble walls:
"Geez Grist. This is awful. High
school stuff didn't used to go around
here. Gas and alcohol doesn't mix.
And please, dear students, if it does,
keep it out of the city papers."
