# Wilbur Asks Academic Freedom; Proposes School Of Fine Arts
## Sees Early Opportunity For Cultural School 
### W. A. MILLIS 
Creation of a Stanford School of
Fine Arts, as a cultural center for
the University and the community,
was envisaged by Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur in the 1936 annual President's
Report, published two weeks ago. i
Pointing out that the founders of !
Stanford said that one of the most j
important aims of the University i
would be the establishment of mu
seums and art galleries and the 1
"making of the highest grade the j
studies and exercises directed to '
the cultivation and enlargement of |
the mind," Dr. Wilbur reviewed the
history of th Museum, the Art Gal
lery, and of art and music courses
in recent years, and concuded that |
"there has been no significant prog- '
ress in the fine arts."
Emphasizing that "no university
can consider its work well done !
unless it recognizes the cultural and
educational significance of the fine j

arts," Dr. Wilbur said that such re
cent factors as the building of the
Memorial Theater, developments in
the English and Public Speaking de
partments, and donations to the Uni
versity present "a new and engross
ing opportunity before us."
I "It is now possible through a
School of Fine Arts," he said, "to
bring together existing personnel,
j facilities, and courses in the drama,
j art, and music and to plan for Stan
ford a position for the fine arts that
is in keeping with the needs of the
civilization about us and the inter
ests of many students. Our setting
| seems propitious for the eventual
I creation of a cultural center which
will give a better balance to the
University."
The establishment of a School of
Fine Arts at Stanford, Dr. Wilbur
concluded, depends entirely upon
the securing of the funds necessary
for the endowment of the school.
