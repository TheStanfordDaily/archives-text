President Ray Lyman Wilbur de
clared in his annual report, issued
March 17, that the necessity for prc-
J serving academic freedom is being
; recognized more at the present time
! than it ever was in the past. r
"Passion and emotions can make
| storms, trouble, and war, but intelli
| genee alone can keep us on the path
! of progress to greater stability," he
said.
World Repression
"In these recent irritating years,"
; Dr. Wilbur pointed out, "the insti
[ tutions of higher learning all over
the world have been subjected to
repression, emasculation, and severe
I criticism, in accordance with the
nation or peoples concerned. ' ,
"In the United States this agita
tion has not gone beyond criticism
: and concern, but it has been wide
; spread and painful. It has been
I based largely on the actions of a
very few professors and students.
