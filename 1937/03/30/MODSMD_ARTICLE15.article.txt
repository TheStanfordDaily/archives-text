# Decries World Attack On Education in Report
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur de
clared in his annual report, issued
March 17, that the necessity for prc-
J serving academic freedom is being
; recognized more at the present time
! than it ever was in the past. r
"Passion and emotions can make
| storms, trouble, and war, but intelli
| genee alone can keep us on the path
! of progress to greater stability," he
said.
World Repression
"In these recent irritating years,"
; Dr. Wilbur pointed out, "the insti
[ tutions of higher learning all over
the world have been subjected to
repression, emasculation, and severe
I criticism, in accordance with the
nation or peoples concerned. ' ,
"In the United States this agita
tion has not gone beyond criticism
: and concern, but it has been wide
; spread and painful. It has been
I based largely on the actions of a
very few professors and students.
In general, though, faculty mem
| bers and university administrators
| have kept their heads and held safe
I the sound principles of academic
freedom."
Vigilancc Needed
i Eternal vigilancc is the price of
| academic freedom and liberty, the
1 Stanford President declared.
"The university," he said, "must
I follow truth wherever it may lead;
| but that does not signify that judg-
I ment, reason, and patience should
; not be used. It is vital to maintain
' our universities free from propa-
I gandists 011 the one hand and opprcs
| sion from the government or any
| other group on the other.
Defends Reason
"The university is the most valu
able instrument of an advancing
civilization, for we can go forward
1 only as our reason leads us."
) Discussing the inadequacy of the
Bachelor's degree as preparation for
any definite life progi-am, Dr. Wilbur
said that changes may be inaugu
rated at Stanford so that the Master's
degree will become the more impor
tant degree for the student who plans
j his program with a definite objective.
Bachlor's Degree
"The Bachelor's degree," he
I pointed out, "is something that the
i professional student gets as he goes
by to years of further study, and is
j incidental for those who engage in
research."
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur said that
1 the Bachelor's degree "now repre
j sents too much and too little. It sig
i nifies too much if it is thought to
mean the completion of a university
j education, and too little if it is con
sidered as satisfactory for any spe
| cific vocation."

"In the United States this agita

Vigilancc Needed
i Eternal vigilancc is the price of
| academic freedom and liberty, the
1 Stanford President declared.
"The university," he said, "must
I follow truth wherever it may lead;
| but that does not signify that judg-
I ment, reason, and patience should
; not be used. It is vital to maintain
' our universities free from propa-

Defends Reason
"The university is the most valu
able instrument of an advancing
civilization, for we can go forward
1 only as our reason leads us."
) Discussing the inadequacy of the
Bachelor's degree as preparation for
any definite life progi-am, Dr. Wilbur
said that changes may be inaugu
rated at Stanford so that the Master's
degree will become the more impor
tant degree for the student who plans
j his program with a definite objective.
Bachlor's Degree
"The Bachelor's degree," he
I pointed out, "is something that the
i professional student gets as he goes
by to years of further study, and is
j incidental for those who engage in
research."
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur said that
1 the Bachelor's degree "now repre
j sents too much and too little. It sig
i nifies too much if it is thought to
mean the completion of a university
j education, and too little if it is con
sidered as satisfactory for any spe
| cific vocation."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur de
clared in his annual report, issued
March 17, that the necessity for prc-
J serving academic freedom is being
; recognized more at the present time
! than it ever was in the past. r
"Passion and emotions can make
| storms, trouble, and war, but intelli
| genee alone can keep us on the path
! of progress to greater stability," he
said.
