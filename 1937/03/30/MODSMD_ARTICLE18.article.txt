# Building Work Goes Rapidly Over Vacation
## Preliminary Excavation For New Education Building Completed 
### 
On forged Stanford's four great
construction projects during spring
vacation, encouraged by new Comp
troller J. Hugh Jackson and discour
aged by the weather.
Preliminary excavation is com
plete for the Cubberley Education
Building and the two new wings of j
Lagunita Court. Wooden forms are
being constructed for the founda
tions and the concrete will be popred
as soon as they are ready. Tons of
crushed rock are being transported
from the new theater site to the j
space south of the library to be used j
for the construction of the Educa
tion building, which will not be
ready for use for a year.
Wings Use Steel
The Lagunita wings will be ready
for occupancy at the beginning of
fall quarter. Their steel frame con
struction, particularly resistant to
earthquakes, is like a wooden frame
work rather than a typical skyscrap
er frame. The various units are be- |
ing welded together at the steel mill, |
and will be assembled on the site of |
the building.
Work on the interior of the Me- j
morial Theater is progressing rap- j
idly. The stage has been extended
slightly forward along the wall on j
each side, with backstage entrances
to these side "aprons." Decorative j
balconies rise above them. The ex- I
tensions to be used for special dra- i
matic effects and special productions
were added to the original plans at
request of drama students.
Complete Foyer
The dignified foyer is practically
complete, terrazzo marble floors have
been installed, and the marble stair
ways are 75 per cent finished. The
little theater and the classrooms re
quire only interior finishing.
In the new amphitheater the green 1
wooden terraces for the seats are
being installed. One-third of the ]
planting has been completed under j
the direction of Mr. Leslie Kiler; all j
deciduous trees are now in and many j

! large evergreens are expected to be
j shipped from Portland. Two roads
I have been built from the south side
! of the bowl onto the stage.
Soil frorp the excavations at the
' Education Building and the Lagu
j nita wings is being used to complete
! the construction of the bowl. The
| new tree-mover mounted on a truck
j is being used for planting. The am
! phitheater will be completed for
! Commencement on June 13
