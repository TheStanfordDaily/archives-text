# Cardinal Quintet Steps Into Title As Cougars Fall
## Indians Nose Out Washington State In Two Hard Fought Games 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Pacific Coast champions—and now it's two championships in a row for
Stanford University's laughing Redshirts after two straight, but narrow,
wins over a surprisingly strong Washington State squad.
After a close, cautious 151-28 win in the first game, the Cards literally
squeezed themselves into the title with a 41-40 thriller Saturday night that

♦ kept 12,000 fans in a 40-minute up-

| roar.
One of the Cougars' biggest assets
: in the series was the center jump,
i used exclusively in the northland
but a completely unfamiliar proce
dure to Farm players.
Jump Bothers Indians
Biggest factor in the W.S.C. of
! fenes, which came uncomfortably
close to negotiating a pair of upsets,
was lanky Cougar center Ivar Nel-

son. In addition to his 6 feet 4
inches, Nelson possesses a pair of
rubber legs, and, although Stanford's
Art Stoefen was holding his own
against the high-reaching Cougar,
Phil Zonne, who saw a good deal of
action, experienced a bit more diffi
culty.
Sotfeen, in both games, ran up 3
personal fouls on himself before the
end of the first half, and when Zonne
wasn't in there for Stoefen, the lat
ter had to hold himself in a bit.
In the first game, on Friday, play
was even throughout, and at half
time the score was knotted at 14-all.
Cougars Lead
Starting the second half fast, the
Cougars broke into a "21—17 lead, and
it took the Cards eight minutes to
pull up into a 21-21 tie on baskets
by Moore and Turner.
With three minutes left in the
ball-game, with Washington State
grimly holding to a 28-27 lead, Phil
Zonne put the Indians into a lead
which they didn't again lose on a
pretty close-in field goal attempt.
Thereupon the Stanford quint start
ed to stall in the forward couCt,
its one-point lead, and did manage
to hold the ball for two solid min
utes, when Nelson, lunging franti
cally for the ball, fouled Luisetti.
Luisetti Converts
Hank dropped both of his gift
shots through, to put the battle on
ice.
Luisetti, still a little bothered with
his bad knee and dogged throughout
the contest by a pair of persevering
Cougar guards, nonetheless was able
to come off with starring honors,
ringing up 8 digits and exhibiting
his customarily brilliant floor game.
Saturday's encounter was just as
narrowly close as the first, and had
the 6000 onlookers gasping in their
seats during the last five minutes.
Cougars Come Up
With 10 minutes to go in the sec
ond half, Coach Bunn's charges were
coasting in on a 31-23 lead, but
rapid-fire baskets by W.S.C.'s Sewell
Carlson and Johnny Kosich and a
free throw by Nelson pulled it up to
31-28, and with but four minutes
remaining were three points in ar
rears at 38-35.

Luisetti's free toss made it 39-35,
but Washington State's guard Glen
Dahlke connected from the side
line to run the tally to 39-37, and
followed his field goal with a free
throw. Score, for Stanford, 39-38.
With 65 seconds to play, the score
stood at 40-40 for Stanford, and
during 45 of them the Cougars were
vainly peppering the Stanford bas
ket as the stands became literally a
mass of sound.
Moore Stars
Stellar guard play on the part of
Captain Dinty Moore and Jack Cal
derwood turned the trick for Stan
ford, together with the definite of
fensive punch offered by Luisetti and
Turner in the forward positions.
The latter led the evening's scorers,
ringing up a total of twelve markers,
while Hoopin' Hank, closely guarded
throughout, and feeding beautifully,
came through with 10.
