# Cycling Fever Hits Farm
## Girls Pedal Country Lanes 
### 
Every week-end, 30 or 40 Stan- I
ford coeds, in shorts, rent bicycles
from Palo Alto dealers and head for
the highways and bi-ways of Santa
Clara County.
By Washington's birthday last
quarter, the season was in full
swing with several extended trips
holding the attention of interested
parties. Two Lagunitans went far
thest afield in an alleged trip as far
as Santa Cruz.
Girls Take OfT
salesman of Smith's Bicycle
Shop, branch of Smith's on the Cir
cle, said the two girls came to the
shop asking to rent the wheels for
three days, their only stipulation be
ing that they must have capacious
carriers. On leaving Saturday morn
ing, February 20, they announced
their intention of cycling to Santa
Cruz. The bicycles were returned,
slightly muddy, Monday afternoon
late.
Exercise, it is advised by experts,
is beneficial to the feminine figure.
As such, bicycling might prove more
interesting to the coeds than the
run-of-the-mill class in physical
education. Many upperclassmen and

! lower-classmen would be available
I for the position of instructor.
Proprietors of the several Paly
rental stations say they have not yet
had a girl come in to rent a "wheel"
in a skirt. They all come in shorts,
i One came in attired in slacks re
cently, but she removed them, plac
ed theiTi in the carrier, and drove off
wearing a navy-blue play-suit dec
j orated with white anchors.
Although several roughs have in
! quired about buying bicycles, few ox
them have ever asked ot rent a
1 one-seater. Tandem bikes, if there
were any to be had, might prove
lucrative to their owners. The only
one known to exist in Palo Alto is
the property of Carl Phillips, En
j cinaman who finds it most con
; venient for purposes of transporta
l tion.
Rates Low
For those who may be interested,
prevailing rates for this season are
50 cents a day, $2.50 a week, or $7
, a month for the best bicycles. A
I somewhat lower rate may be ob
tained for more used machines.
: In short, Stanford is looking for
ward to one of its most successful
' | seasons of bicycling, in shorts.
