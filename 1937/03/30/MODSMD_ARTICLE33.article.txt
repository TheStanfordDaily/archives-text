# Stock Profits Of Last Year Show Decline
## Investment Returns May Continue To Decrease This Year, Says Roth 
### 
Although the rest of the nation
has found prosperity, old man de
pression has crawled out from under
a haystack and gone to work down
on the Farm.
According to a statement made
by Almon E. Roth, former Comp
troller, in the 1936 volume of the
President's Report, average return
rate on Stnfaord's corporate stock
investments fell to 3.88 per cent last
year from the 1935 mark of 3.95 per
cent. No brighter outlook was held
for this year, since Roth also said the
decline was expected to continue.
About nine per cent of the Uni
versity's endowment is now in the
form of common and preferred stock
in corporations. These holdings
bring an income which varies with
business conditions. The portion of
the endowment invested in bonds
brings a fixed income determined by
interest rates at the time of in
vestment.
Last year's return was one per
cent less than that of the 1928 peak,
when it reached 4.89 per cent.
Moreover, a large part of the Uni
versity's endowment must be rein
vested at the present low rates of
interest, which will cut heavily into
income. ,
Invest in Stocks
A court decision early in 1936
gave Stanford permission to in
vest in common and preferred .stocks.
By August of last year, when the
Comptroller's report was tompiled,
2.3 per cent of the total endowment
was in common stocks. Since that
time this amount has been raised to
nine per cent ,placing three million
dollars of the endowment in such
investments.
Stocks held are (hose of a num
ber of leading corporations, with the
holdings well distributed. Preferred
stocks include United States Steel,
in which $323,835.50 has been in
vested, Shell Union Oil, New Eng
land Power Association, General
Motors Corporation, Crown Wil
lamette Paper, Atlantic Refining
Company, and American Locomotive
Company.
Principal holdings of common
stocks are in the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway, the Califor
nia Packing Coporation, New York j
Central, Guaranty Trust Company
of New York, and the American
Trust Company.
Holdings in Bonds
Twenty-one million dollars of the
endowment is in bonds, principally
those of railroads and public utili
ties.
Total invested assets uf the Uni
versity amount to $31,273,575.23. De
spite the size of the endowment,
however, student fees and tuition
produced more income than any
other source, contributing 44 per
cent of the revenue. According to
the report, the cost of operating the

University last year was 5.1.067,322.-
09. This figure does not include the ,
fund of $77,406.46 set' aside to re- '
store one-half of the 10 per cent I
salary reduction which faculty mem- '
bers sustained during the depres- j
sion.
Investments have been directed i
by a Board of Trustees finance com
mittee consisting of C. O. G. Miller,
VV. Palmer Fuller, and Stuart Raw
lings.

fund of $77,406.46 set' aside to re- '
store one-half of the 10 per cent I
salary reduction which faculty mem- '
bers sustained during the depres- j

by a Board of Trustees finance com

According to a statement made
by Almon E. Roth, former Comp
troller, in the 1936 volume of the
President's Report, average return
rate on Stnfaord's corporate stock
investments fell to 3.88 per cent last
year from the 1935 mark of 3.95 per
cent. No brighter outlook was held
for this year, since Roth also said the
decline was expected to continue.
About nine per cent of the Uni
versity's endowment is now in the
form of common and preferred stock
in corporations. These holdings
bring an income which varies with
business conditions. The portion of
the endowment invested in bonds
brings a fixed income determined by
interest rates at the time of in
vestment.
Last year's return was one per
cent less than that of the 1928 peak,
when it reached 4.89 per cent.
Moreover, a large part of the Uni
versity's endowment must be rein
vested at the present low rates of
interest, which will cut heavily into
income. ,
Invest in Stocks
A court decision early in 1936
gave Stanford permission to in
vest in common and preferred .stocks.
By August of last year, when the
Comptroller's report was tompiled,
2.3 per cent of the total endowment
was in common stocks. Since that
time this amount has been raised to
nine per cent ,placing three million
dollars of the endowment in such
investments.
Stocks held are (hose of a num
ber of leading corporations, with the
holdings well distributed. Preferred
stocks include United States Steel,
in which $323,835.50 has been in
vested, Shell Union Oil, New Eng
land Power Association, General
Motors Corporation, Crown Wil
lamette Paper, Atlantic Refining
Company, and American Locomotive
Company.
Principal holdings of common
stocks are in the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway, the Califor
nia Packing Coporation, New York j
Central, Guaranty Trust Company
of New York, and the American
Trust Company.
Holdings in Bonds
Twenty-one million dollars of the
endowment is in bonds, principally
those of railroads and public utili
ties.
Total invested assets uf the Uni
versity amount to $31,273,575.23. De
spite the size of the endowment,
however, student fees and tuition
produced more income than any
other source, contributing 44 per
cent of the revenue. According to
the report, the cost of operating the

University last year was 5.1.067,322.-
