DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., March
29 (U.R).â€”ln typical gashouse fash
ion, the St. Louis Cardinals snapped
a six-game losing streak by nosing
out the Detroit Tigers, G to 5, yes
terday. Dizzy Dean, making his first
appearance on the Card mound,
nearly came to blows with Umpire
Ormsby when the official refused to
rule a third strike on one batsman.
Diz worked only three innings, but
gave up two runs on consecutive
singles by Greenberg, Tebbets and
Rowe. Held to one hit the day be
fore, the gashouse gang collected 14
yesterday as Terry Moore set the
pace with four.
