# Cathcart Saw Court Decision
## Professor Foretold New Move Months Ago 
### 
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the
Stanford Law School predicted sev
eral months ago yesterday's Su
preme Court decision upholding
state minimum wage laws.
Professor Cathcart foretold the re
versal of the 14-year-old policy of
holding state minimum wage laws
for women unconstitutional, in
speeches given before the Common
wealth Club of San Francisco and
the Oregon Bar Association.
In his speech before the Oregon
Bar Association, he said that the
New York minimum wage decision
of last year could not be considered
as fully disposing of the minimum
wage as a constitutional question.
A reversal of the Court's policy was
inevitable.
Professor Cathcart said: '"The
movement of public opinion during
the last quarter-century has been
in the direction of more and more
regulation of private business. Upon
the whole the courts have kept pace
with that movement; this is particu
larly true of the Supreme Court."
The New York minimum wage de
cision, according to Professor Cath
cart, "probably constitutes only an
other 'breathing spell for business'
in the onward march of state regu
lation."
In 1936 the Supreme Court de
cided against state minimum wage
laws by a vote of five to four. In
the present case, Justice Roberts
changed to the side of state wage
control, making the decision five to
four in favor of state minimum wage
laws.
Professor Cathcart's opinion con
cerning this change is that the case
was presented in a slightly different
manner, effecting a change in Jus
tice Roberts' judgment.
