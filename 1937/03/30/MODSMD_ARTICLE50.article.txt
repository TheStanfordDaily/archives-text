# U.C.L.A., U.S.C. Set Back Indian Nine In South
## Cards Offered Try for Second Place Today To Clash with Gael Team On Sunken Diamond At 3:30 This Afternoon 
### ART ALLEN 
Stanford's varsity baseball team,
which was leading the league before
leaving for the South after finals,
suffered a disastrous stand against
U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., winning but
one of the four games played. Cali
fornia now leads the circuit by one
and one-half games with the Trojans
and the Indians following in that
order.
This afternoon's game with St.
Mary's on the Sunken Diamond will
enable the local team to move back
into second place if Coach Wolter's
men can turn the tide; Joe Griffin,
Fred Furman, and Ray Weiershau
ser are likely starting pitchers, with
the start slated for 3:110.
Beat Marines Twice
The team traveled to San Diego,
winning a double-header from the
Marine Base nine (here on last Sat
urday, but those games do not count
in the league standings.
The first of the league games found
Weiershauser and Furman turning
back the U.C.L.A. Bruins, 5-4, as
Heagerty batted in deWitt with the
winning run in the ninth inning.
Stanford dropped the return 'en
gagement by one run, 6-5, despite
a ninth inning rally of two runs.
Rasmussen did nice relief hurling,
after Catcher Stockman of the
Bruins honied off of Griffin with
two on base in the second inning.
Gonzales Luminary
Against the Trojans the Cards
were less fortunate. "Smoky" Joe
Gonzales, leading hurler of the
C.1.8.A. for two seasons, pitched an
almost perfect no-run, no-hit game,
in which only two men reached
first base on walks. Six runs were
scored off Furman and two against
Weiershauser, giving U.S.C. an 8-0
victory.
In the last league game also with
the Trojans, nine runs were scored
off Pitcher Verne Johnson in the
first six innings. In this half of the
seventh, the Stanford batters tied the
game with nine runs on four hits,
but prosperity did not last, as the
Trojans tallied three runs against
Rasmussen in the last of the eighth
inning.
