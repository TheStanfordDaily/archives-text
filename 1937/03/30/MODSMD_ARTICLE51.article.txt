BASKETBALL IS
ALL CLEANED UP

John Bunn's boys finished up the
1037 basketball season Saturday
night, and they finished it right.
There are .plenty not particularly
sympathetic toward Stanford who
will say that the Cougars scored a
moral victory over the Cards be
-1 cause of their fine showings both
nights against them, that the In
dians looked rugged and worn from
the season that has established
1 them as possibly the finest college
team in the United States.
They might have been ragged, and
I they might have been tired and sick
of basektball as they closed a long
old season, but they were just good
enough to win the Pacific Coast
Conference, in two straight games
from one of the tougher teams in
the country.
And it takes a good team to win
the P.C.C., any old year. The Coast
champs can hold their own, season
in and season out, with Notre Dame,
Kansas, Long Island U., Kentucky,
and any of the other big shot bas
ketball schools.
Now that Genial John has coached
two teams that have gone the whole
route, he can start thinking about
how he's going to make it three
straight next year. He loses Cap
tain Moore and Howie Turner trom
his first five, and Bill Quade and
Sparky Robertson, both number one
reserve men this year. To replace
them there are the Zonne brothers,
and Dick Lyon, and Beebs Lee, and
a flock of others who played with
the varsity this year, plus a frosh
team that has one of the best records
any Card freshman team ever had.
On that yearling team were big
Tom Siebert, who will play with the
help of glasses next, year and should
improve mightily; Tom Lyon,
brother of Dick and a kid who
should be right up there next sea
son; Will Anderson, deceptive big
redhead and always cool as a mint
julep; Leon Lafaille, a clever, quick
boy who is no slouch with his think
er; Gil Rahn, steady, strong floor
who makes few mistakes,
and. a host of others with lots on
the ball.
Yes, John will have plenty of ma
terial to build a team that will have
to face competition in the confer
ence that will be just as tough next
year as this. U.S.C. and Cal had
frosh teams that will give their var
sities a big boost in 1938. U.C.L.A.
is due 'to start her upswing after
having had a few iean years. With
Calderwood, Luisetti, and Stoefen as
a nucleus, John will have a good
leg on the title. It will be hard to
find two more with the fire of Moore
and Turner, but that's a long way
off yet.

SOMETHING ENDS,
SOMETHING STARTS

Spring practice for the feetballers
is hard upon us, now, and with it
come a lot of big names that will be
hot stuff for the city papers. Wimp
Paulman will be out for the first
time since last September, and he's
going to be a handy guy in Tiny
Thornhill's designs, if all goes w-sll.
It was Paulman who quarterbacked
the Vowing Sophs in their last year,
1535, and it was he who slipped
across on a quarterback sneak,
while Grayson pulled a bluff, to
score the first six points against
U.S.C. in the 16-0 win that year.
Cal will be howling with glee
about that 20-0 thing of last fall
for some time to come, it's a cinch,
and they have the edge on dope so
far for the year to come. But tho
heck with those guys, we'll just
stay in our own back yard and see
if maybe Paulman, Brigham, Cal
velli, Clark, Zagar, Anderson, and
the rest of the fellers can make up

a good team. And when Big Game (
time comes again in the fall, things j
might be so rearranged that Stanford j
will have just a little chance against I
the mighty Bears.

TIIEIK TRACK TEAM,
TOO, IS GOOD

Speaking of Bears, they have been
getting lots of publicity lately as
having the "second-best college
dual meet track team in the coun
try." U.S.C., they say, is tops once
more. Well, everybody just about
quit trying for first place some time
ago, Troy is too good, but that sec
ond-place spot is still fair game. Cal
has a great team, headed by the
marvelous Williams, but they have
n't sewed anything up yet.
Stanford is improving, Brutus
Hamilton's boys will at least know
they have been in a track meet after
they tangle with the Cards. The
Bears were all set to plaster Stan
ford last year, but things didn't work
out so well. The Cards came
through, the Bears didn't. Maybe
Dink will have a chance yet, this
season.

Single men between 19 and 24 get
into more trouble that leads to court
than do the married ones.

Now that Genial John has coached
two teams that have gone the whole
route, he can start thinking about
how he's going to make it three
straight next year. He loses Cap
tain Moore and Howie Turner trom
his first five, and Bill Quade and
Sparky Robertson, both number one
reserve men this year. To replace
them there are the Zonne brothers,
and Dick Lyon, and Beebs Lee, and
a flock of others who played with
the varsity this year, plus a frosh
team that has one of the best records
any Card freshman team ever had.
On that yearling team were big
Tom Siebert, who will play with the
help of glasses next, year and should
improve mightily; Tom Lyon,
brother of Dick and a kid who
should be right up there next sea
son; Will Anderson, deceptive big
redhead and always cool as a mint
julep; Leon Lafaille, a clever, quick
boy who is no slouch with his think
er; Gil Rahn, steady, strong floor
who makes few mistakes,
and. a host of others with lots on
the ball.
Yes, John will have plenty of ma
terial to build a team that will have
to face competition in the confer
ence that will be just as tough next
year as this. U.S.C. and Cal had
frosh teams that will give their var
sities a big boost in 1938. U.C.L.A.
is due 'to start her upswing after
having had a few iean years. With
Calderwood, Luisetti, and Stoefen as
a nucleus, John will have a good
leg on the title. It will be hard to
find two more with the fire of Moore
and Turner, but that's a long way
off yet.

SOMETHING ENDS,
SOMETHING STARTS

Spring practice for the feetballers
is hard upon us, now, and with it
come a lot of big names that will be
hot stuff for the city papers. Wimp
Paulman will be out for the first
time since last September, and he's
going to be a handy guy in Tiny
Thornhill's designs, if all goes w-sll.
It was Paulman who quarterbacked
the Vowing Sophs in their last year,
1535, and it was he who slipped
across on a quarterback sneak,
while Grayson pulled a bluff, to
score the first six points against
U.S.C. in the 16-0 win that year.
Cal will be howling with glee
about that 20-0 thing of last fall
for some time to come, it's a cinch,
and they have the edge on dope so
far for the year to come. But tho
heck with those guys, we'll just
stay in our own back yard and see
if maybe Paulman, Brigham, Cal
velli, Clark, Zagar, Anderson, and
the rest of the fellers can make up

a good team. And when Big Game (
time comes again in the fall, things j
might be so rearranged that Stanford j
will have just a little chance against I
the mighty Bears.

TIIEIK TRACK TEAM,
TOO, IS GOOD

Speaking of Bears, they have been
getting lots of publicity lately as
having the "second-best college
dual meet track team in the coun
try." U.S.C., they say, is tops once
more. Well, everybody just about
quit trying for first place some time
ago, Troy is too good, but that sec
ond-place spot is still fair game. Cal
has a great team, headed by the
marvelous Williams, but they have
n't sewed anything up yet.
Stanford is improving, Brutus
Hamilton's boys will at least know
they have been in a track meet after
they tangle with the Cards. The
Bears were all set to plaster Stan
ford last year, but things didn't work
out so well. The Cards came
through, the Bears didn't. Maybe
Dink will have a chance yet, this
season.

BASKETBALL IS
ALL CLEANED UP

John Bunn's boys finished up the
1037 basketball season Saturday
night, and they finished it right.
There are .plenty not particularly
sympathetic toward Stanford who
will say that the Cougars scored a
moral victory over the Cards be
-1 cause of their fine showings both
nights against them, that the In
dians looked rugged and worn from
the season that has established
1 them as possibly the finest college
team in the United States.
They might have been ragged, and
I they might have been tired and sick
of basektball as they closed a long
old season, but they were just good
enough to win the Pacific Coast
Conference, in two straight games
from one of the tougher teams in
the country.
And it takes a good team to win
the P.C.C., any old year. The Coast
champs can hold their own, season
in and season out, with Notre Dame,
Kansas, Long Island U., Kentucky,
and any of the other big shot bas

and. a host of others with lots on
the ball.
Yes, John will have plenty of ma
terial to build a team that will have
to face competition in the confer
ence that will be just as tough next
year as this. U.S.C. and Cal had
frosh teams that will give their var
sities a big boost in 1938. U.C.L.A.
is due 'to start her upswing after
having had a few iean years. With
Calderwood, Luisetti, and Stoefen as
a nucleus, John will have a good
leg on the title. It will be hard to
find two more with the fire of Moore
and Turner, but that's a long way
off yet.

SOMETHING ENDS,
SOMETHING STARTS

Spring practice for the feetballers
is hard upon us, now, and with it
come a lot of big names that will be
hot stuff for the city papers. Wimp
Paulman will be out for the first
time since last September, and he's
going to be a handy guy in Tiny
Thornhill's designs, if all goes w-sll.
It was Paulman who quarterbacked
the Vowing Sophs in their last year,
1535, and it was he who slipped
across on a quarterback sneak,
while Grayson pulled a bluff, to
score the first six points against
U.S.C. in the 16-0 win that year.
Cal will be howling with glee
about that 20-0 thing of last fall
for some time to come, it's a cinch,
and they have the edge on dope so
far for the year to come. But tho
heck with those guys, we'll just
stay in our own back yard and see
if maybe Paulman, Brigham, Cal
velli, Clark, Zagar, Anderson, and
the rest of the fellers can make up

a good team. And when Big Game (
time comes again in the fall, things j
might be so rearranged that Stanford j
will have just a little chance against I
the mighty Bears.

TIIEIK TRACK TEAM,
TOO, IS GOOD

Speaking of Bears, they have been
getting lots of publicity lately as
having the "second-best college
dual meet track team in the coun
try." U.S.C., they say, is tops once
more. Well, everybody just about
quit trying for first place some time
ago, Troy is too good, but that sec
ond-place spot is still fair game. Cal
has a great team, headed by the
marvelous Williams, but they have
n't sewed anything up yet.
Stanford is improving, Brutus
Hamilton's boys will at least know
they have been in a track meet after
they tangle with the Cards. The
Bears were all set to plaster Stan
ford last year, but things didn't work
out so well. The Cards came
through, the Bears didn't. Maybe
Dink will have a chance yet, this
season.

BASKETBALL IS
ALL CLEANED UP

John Bunn's boys finished up the
1037 basketball season Saturday
night, and they finished it right.
There are .plenty not particularly
sympathetic toward Stanford who
will say that the Cougars scored a
moral victory over the Cards be
-1 cause of their fine showings both
nights against them, that the In
dians looked rugged and worn from
the season that has established
1 them as possibly the finest college
team in the United States.
They might have been ragged, and
I they might have been tired and sick
of basektball as they closed a long
old season, but they were just good
enough to win the Pacific Coast
Conference, in two straight games
from one of the tougher teams in
the country.
And it takes a good team to win
the P.C.C., any old year. The Coast
champs can hold their own, season
in and season out, with Notre Dame,
Kansas, Long Island U., Kentucky,
and any of the other big shot bas
ketball schools.
Now that Genial John has coached
two teams that have gone the whole
route, he can start thinking about
how he's going to make it three
straight next year. He loses Cap
tain Moore and Howie Turner trom
his first five, and Bill Quade and
Sparky Robertson, both number one
reserve men this year. To replace
them there are the Zonne brothers,
and Dick Lyon, and Beebs Lee, and
a flock of others who played with
the varsity this year, plus a frosh
team that has one of the best records
any Card freshman team ever had.
On that yearling team were big
Tom Siebert, who will play with the
help of glasses next, year and should
improve mightily; Tom Lyon,
brother of Dick and a kid who
should be right up there next sea
son; Will Anderson, deceptive big
redhead and always cool as a mint
julep; Leon Lafaille, a clever, quick
boy who is no slouch with his think
er; Gil Rahn, steady, strong floor
who makes few mistakes,
and. a host of others with lots on
the ball.
