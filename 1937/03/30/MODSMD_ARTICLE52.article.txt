# When Springtime Comesâ€”Grid Practice
## 
### 

WIIEN TINY TIIORNHILL gets his hoys together tomorrow to start
spring football practice, Tony Calvelli, left, Jake Brigham, center,
and Bill Pan I man, right, will be around to help give the Head Man
an idea of what his 1937 varsity is going to look like. Paulman looms
as the big threat in the Cardinal backficld; he was out last year with
a broken ankle gathered a week before the opening game with Santa
Clara. Calvelli and Brigham split the fullback job last year. Tony
will probably go back to playing center this season.
