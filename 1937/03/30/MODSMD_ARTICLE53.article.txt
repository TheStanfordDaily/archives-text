weeks ago by walloping the crack j
Fullerton J.C. team, 48-27, and sub
merging the Bruin from U.C.L.A.
51-23.
The outstanding mark chalked !
up in the Fullerton engagement in I
Encina Pools was the time of 3:08.9 j
made by the Card 300-yard medley i
relay team of Weatherbe, Towne, j
and Vibert. The time went down as I
a new pool and University record.
Clarke Wins
Dick Clarke, Stanford's sopho- I
more sprint threat, churned through |
the 50-yard dash to win in :24.4 for
another outstanding Indian per
formance.
Christenson of Fullerton defeated j
Winfield Needham of Stanford in!
the 220-yard free-style in 2:19.5,'
and McNicol of the Jaysees whipped J
Hal Weatherbe of the Cards in the |

time of 1:43.1.

Coach Nort Thornton of Stanford
wanted to crack a few Pacific Coast
short course records. Result — four
marks shattered.

was 2:36.7.
There was no 60-yard dash rec-
I ord so Dick Clarke of the Cards

j time of :29.6. This mark will go
I down in the record books.

j Vibert, smashed the 3:13.4 mark held
by Oregon when they finished in

j rine ace for the fndians, clipped
more than a second from the mark
! held by Caddey of Washington in
the 200-yard breast-stroke. His time
was 2:36.7.
There was no 60-yard dash rec-
I ord so Dick Clarke of the Cards

I down in the record books.
