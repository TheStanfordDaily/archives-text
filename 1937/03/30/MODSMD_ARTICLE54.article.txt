# Farm Gridmen See Brighter Season Ahead
## Seventy Men Expected To Appear Tomorrow For Spring Practice 
### 
The prospects look considerably
brighter for the future of Stanford
football than they did a year ago as
seventy grid candidates prepare to
turn out tomorrow afternoon for
their first spring practice.
A year ago Coach Tiny Thornhill
had lost 16 of 24 lettermen. This
year only 7 of 23 lettermen will be
missing, including only two regu
lars. In addition to the returning
1936 veterans Tiny will weloce Biil
Paulman, star quarterback of 1935,
who was out 'last season with a
broken ankle.
Shifts Calvelli
Tony Calvelli, banana - fingered
fullback in 1936, has been shifted to
center, where he will vie for the reg
ular post against Louis Tsoutsouvas,
who missed only 18 minutes of play
last fall. Wally deWitt, Tony Mecia,
and Dick Sutton will be three other
veterans gunning for the post, and
Hugh Radke will move up from the
frosh to give them all some compe
tition.
Two letverman fullbacks, Jake
Brigham and Glenn Hamilton, will
appear lat spring sessions, although
the latter may be shifted to right
half. Tom Collins and Lawrence
Bayer v/ill be aiming for the post,
not to mention three promising frosh,
Howard Hickingbotham, Rod Par
ker, and Chet Patton.
Frosh Come Up
Jimmy Coffis, Joe Vigna, and per
haps Hamilton will try for halfback
posts. Bill Kirsch, outstanding tack
ier of the whole squad, and Peter
Fay, fast and cagey runner, will re
turn as halves. Tom Walker, Chad
Reade, Gerry Sparling, Harold
Wilson, Ed Harrington, and Richard
DeLauer will come up 'from the
frosh. Bill Hawkins and Elmer Sjos
trom, who have t never played var
sity, wiil also be halfback aspirants.
Grant Stone and Jack Clark will
return to the flank positions, but will

have considerable competition from 1
Neil Rasmussen, who just started to
find himself at the close of last
season, Chet Olcott, Don Butler,
Bob Dakan, Andy Stojkovich, and
Irv Cummings. Harold Saunders,
who brought forth Tiny's best wit
when he appeared on crutches yes
terday, will be a wing candidate
when a bad knee is cured. Bill Wil
lai'd, Dick Peers, Hugh Gallerneau,
James Grant, and Bill Greer will
be gunning from the frosh.
£agar Shoots High
Pete Zagar, burly tackle, may be
headed for an all-American berth .
this year. Byron West and Stan An- I
dersen, a frosh, will be outstanding
candidates for the other tackle post. I
Jack Walton arid Dick Shannon will •

try to break in, as will Bob Young,
Sid Lewis, Paul Durckcl, and Pat
Nowell from the yearlings.
Leo Ferko and Bobby Matthews
will probably hold the guard posts,
which they ably handled last season.
Don and Frank McMillan, Dick
Brigham, and Jay Holdridge, and
A1 Bardin will be guard candidates.
Ernest Damnrus, Norm Juney, Gordy
McCulloch, and Stockton Shaw, from
the frosh, and Howard Robinson,
transfer from Southern Cal, will also
aspire to guard posts. Tiny is con
sidering shifting Ed Gamier from the
backfield to guard, which may upset
the present lineup of regulars.
Coach Thornhill plans four ses
sions a week during spring practice,
the first four days of every week.
