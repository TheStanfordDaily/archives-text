# This Is an Editorial
## 
### 
IT'S a fine warm afternoon on Reg Day at
Stanford, and we sit in our swivel chair and
look out of the window—the same window that
Jorgensen wrote about all last volume — and
prepare to write an editorial.
We have a lot of fine ideas for editorials but
they're all too dull for a fine warm afternoon
on Reg Day at Stanford, so we just lean back
and listen to our swivel chair squeak, and think
that the chair is rusty—like The Daily—from
nearly a month's idleness.
And we know that the sticky Daily gears
will grind and clash tonight, and will groan
tomorrow night, but by Friday will be spinning
with lubricated precision again. We dare not
say "well oiled" for its obvious implication.
But there's that editorial—a "live" editorial
for a fine warm afternoon on Reg Day. So we
check the files to find out what our contempo
rary collegiate journalists have been doing, and
we see "hell week," and ex-committee, and
LaGuardia and Hitler, and strikes—but here's
the one they all hit.
This is a fine live topic for a fine warm Reg
Day, this one we've found, though it's trite.
It is spring.
Every editor heralds the spring—and with
his writing of the burgeoning of tender young
saplings, he throws in great quantities of "ah."
They add mood.
But no "ah" for us. Spring is here. We know
it. We're for it. We've decided that spring is
so good a thing that The Daily will back it to
the last ditch. G. F.
