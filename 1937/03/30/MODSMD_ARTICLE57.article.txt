# The 						Wrong Solution
## 
### 
ON Ex Committee's agenda is the suggestion
that one big job is enough for one big
student.
Because it spoils the aim of political crack
shots, crosses the theory of natural selection
and removes all necessity for the fittest to sur
vive anything—it's one proposition that needs
Ex Committee's oral curry-combing.
As it stands, it has the virtue of giving
more people a chance at student body jobs.
Eut it has the defect of restricting the superior
talents of the superior man to just one field.
And that man, it must be remembered, is by
all laws of politics and nature the man to do
as many jobs as his nervous system will permit.
In high school, putting dumb Johnny Jones
into the Senior Treasury was all right because
it was more important that Johnny unsnarl his
mind than efficiently administer his office.
In the workaday world, the opposite is true.
Efficient administration is mandatory, though
often unrealized.
Now Stanford is not a high school. And
Stanford's A.S.S.U. is not a smooth-running ad
ministrative machine. It is something in be
tween. Wc are not educated and grown-up.
Neither, except to some intelligent cynics, are
we high school kids.
And we cannot slide dopes into political of
fice here so they can get "experience," any
more than we can demand letter-perfect dis
charge of all political duties.
Nor, most importantly, can we deliberately
put a premium on the able. The A.S.S.U. is too
nearly the grown-up governmental organ for
that.
We must select our leaders in some way that
is neither high-schoolish nor grown-up —some
way that is in keeping with our position be
tween those extremes.
We don't know what that way is. But we
do know the proposal to abandon natural se
lection by competition isn't it.
For it simply cannot be true that those on
the outside, generally speaking, should be in
side. The whole world east of Thurlov/'s has
worked and is working on an opposite precept:
if those who haven't big jobs should have
them, they'd have them.
