(From the Daily Trojan)
THE spirit which produced the Simpson-for
Queen episode on this coast and the cur
rent Roosevelt-for-King campaign being con
dueled by the Daily Princetoninn staff prob

ably was acquired by students who apparently
believe what the newspapers and movies say
about how "college kids" act.
All right, you Princeton college boys, we'll
concede you the publicity that this latest ven
ture into the eld of whimsy and post-adoles
cent sophistication has brought you. The point
is that it is just a punk attempt to duplicate the
success of the "good thing" which the Veterans
of Future Wars became last year.
The reason that this Roosevelt business will
never be anything but a washout in comparison
with the Veterans of Future Wars is that under
lying all the satirical horseplay of the VFW
movement was a deeply sincere and magnifi
cently effective demonstration that young men
do not want to die on battle fields any more.
But this second Princeton movement hasn't
an element of decency about it. It cannot pos
sibly harm or help Mr. Roosevelt in any way.
As he said the other day, his political career is
to be concluded after these four years in the
White House which, king or no king, were
given him by 27,000,000 people.
