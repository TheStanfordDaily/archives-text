# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
The ultramarine vacation having sluggishly dis
appeared down the drain, no new menaces to educa
tion and hashing appear except the necessity for
dredging out 15 more units' worth of Sprinkle Quarter.
Students in this institution of mire learning having
sluggishly appeared again, don't look any happier
about it all than I do. It is said that everyone had a
good time last week and that they are glad to get back
and they are feeling fine and they went plus 5 last
quarter and how's your average you old so-and-so, but
there are statistics to show that it snowed in Yosemite,
and that people in Carmel lay out on the dunes endeav
oring to get a suntan with overcoats on.
Even the sit-down strikes don't seem as fresh now
as they did.
However, I suppose everything is for the best.

Probably my sorrow is due in no small measure to
the fact that the Beta house is running itself down at
the heels. It used to be that any house manager could
get up in house meeting and say that house bills would
have to go up next quarter, and nobody would seem
to mind, because there was always the thought that
the Beta house was slowly collapsing down there on
its corner across from the Kappa house, and if the
Betas could live in a place like that, (here is a chance
for life on Mars.
But before finals, the Betas announced to the world
that conditions were not going to go on like this. The
Betas were going to put a bi-swing sportsback on their
house and a zipper front, and really go out for the
high-class college trade. With the idea that the wreck
ers would take over the Beta house, but not the Betas,
Sprinkle Quarter, they just tore it apart from the
inside out one night. Bannisters came out; there was
the jingle-jingle of breaking glass, and the rip-rip of
tearing linen. Humorists with paint cans drew pic
tures of ladies on the walls. Practically everybody had
a good time.
However.
Spring vacation came and went, or had you no
ticed? All the Betas came back with orders to live
outside the house, but it seems that the alumni have
sent word that wrecking won't commence until the
middle of the quarter, which shows how little alumni
know of conditions on the campus.
So ten of the Betas moved back in the house, just
as if nothing had happened. You can't fool die-hard
Betas. They've lived there too long to let appearances
deceive them. They can tell when it's actually going to
collapse.

tearing linen. Humorists with paint cans drew pic
tures of ladies on the walls. Practically everybody had
a good time.
However.
Spring vacation came and went, or had you no
ticed? All the Betas came back with orders to live
outside the house, but it seems that the alumni have
sent word that wrecking won't commence until the
middle of the quarter, which shows how little alumni
know of conditions on the campus.
So ten of the Betas moved back in the house, just
as if nothing had happened. You can't fool die-hard
Betas. They've lived there too long to let appearances
deceive them. They can tell when it's actually going to
collapse.
The ultramarine vacation having sluggishly dis
appeared down the drain, no new menaces to educa
tion and hashing appear except the necessity for
dredging out 15 more units' worth of Sprinkle Quarter.
Students in this institution of mire learning having
sluggishly appeared again, don't look any happier
about it all than I do. It is said that everyone had a
good time last week and that they are glad to get back
and they are feeling fine and they went plus 5 last
quarter and how's your average you old so-and-so, but
there are statistics to show that it snowed in Yosemite,
and that people in Carmel lay out on the dunes endeav
oring to get a suntan with overcoats on.
Even the sit-down strikes don't seem as fresh now
as they did.
However, I suppose everything is for the best.

Probably my sorrow is due in no small measure to
the fact that the Beta house is running itself down at
the heels. It used to be that any house manager could
get up in house meeting and say that house bills would
have to go up next quarter, and nobody would seem
to mind, because there was always the thought that
the Beta house was slowly collapsing down there on
its corner across from the Kappa house, and if the
Betas could live in a place like that, (here is a chance
for life on Mars.
But before finals, the Betas announced to the world
that conditions were not going to go on like this. The
Betas were going to put a bi-swing sportsback on their
house and a zipper front, and really go out for the
high-class college trade. With the idea that the wreck
ers would take over the Beta house, but not the Betas,
Sprinkle Quarter, they just tore it apart from the
inside out one night. Bannisters came out; there was
the jingle-jingle of breaking glass, and the rip-rip of
tearing linen. Humorists with paint cans drew pic
tures of ladies on the walls. Practically everybody had
a good time.
