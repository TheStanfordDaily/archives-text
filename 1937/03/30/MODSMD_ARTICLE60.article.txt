After mumbling to themselves all week, illustrator
Gist, and perpetrator Our Hasher decided they were
curious as to how many people would buy the Our
Hasher anthology, now under construction, at fob bits
apiece. If enough people show an interest, plans can
go ahead and if more people show an interest the
book might be expanded over 100 pages.
If peoples will sign their names in the cute little
book at the Cellar Cigar Counter, they will get auto
graphed and numbered copies of the foisted edition, if
and when.
