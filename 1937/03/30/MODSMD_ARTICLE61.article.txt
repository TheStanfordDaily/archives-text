# BULL SESSION
## BROKEN-DOWN MILL OF THE GODS 
### 
So soon after a blessed Sunday of Easter Parades,
I would not rashly observe that very few people
really believe in God. But -at this time I can project
a faith-shattering bombshell of lesser import.
The ha'-penny firecracker I drop explodes to the
eflect that most people evidently do not believe the
wages of sin is death or that there is a universal order
of righteousness which makes everything work out
right in the end. In fact, it seems to be almost a
Believe It or Not item when the real-life dirty snake
actually gets the stabbing he deserves.

Along this line I point to the great flood of short
short and long-short stories running in the national
magazines. These stories run on the idea that the mill
of the gods does not begin to grind until the last
paragraph, when the villain, who has been sitting
pretty for the first 1500 words, is suddenly squashed
to bits and the goody-goody hero gets the girl, the
money, or both. The unexpectedness of the ending is
what makes the story unusual and makes it worth
money.
O. Henry had a lot to do with standardizing and
popularizing Ibis formula, but he at least spiced the
preliminary dialogue with descriptions of restaurants
where the air was thick and the napery was thin. |
Several of his stories even told about the poor sap
whose back was scratched so hard by lady luck that
you just had to laugh, it was so pitiful.
But the enormous popularity of the quirk-ending j
short stories, and the light-comical motion pictures in J
which everything is dedicated to the proposition that
this is the best of all possible worlds, can be explained
by noting that fairy talcs were once very popular with
all classes of people.
The fairy talc portrayed a never-never-land state j
of affairs which was highly desirable. And the right- i
cousness-triumphant story pictures a state of affairs j
which would be very nice if it were only true.
If everybody were certain that fate always made
everything work out to catch the human rat just be
fore his moment of triumph, stories based on this idea
would be dull and commonplace.

But as long as the good-guy-getting-girl-bad-guy
getting-stepped-on fable outlines a situation which is
uncommon and unexpected, it is certain that not many
people believe that the wages of sin are really death.
Q.E.D. Or no?
