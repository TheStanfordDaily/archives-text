# Stanford Plutocrats Now 'Auto-crats'; Scorn Taxis

### WARREN RADFORD 
When taxi service hit the Circle 1
twenty years ago, 90 per cent of all
calls for them came from Stanford.
Today, only about live in eve»y 200— j
2\.i per cent —are for Farm service.
The reason for the change in this
vital statistic during two decades is
that Stanford students now go home
and inveigle the old man into kick- !
ing through with one of those smooth
horseless carriages which make
Farm existence possible.
This week-end, out of 175 taxi j
trips, 20 were from Stanford; 15 of
the hack-calls were from Robleites, !
which explains why no one ever sees
a Roble lass waiting a ride on Eng
lish comer.
Encina, on the other hand, seldom
calls a taxi, and when it does, it's
usually a phoney, or else the pros- ;
pective passenger suddenly changes :
his mind and decides to save his
pennies and walk.
Most of the taxi trade these days
is with Paly residents, and with
tourists who like to take trips around
the campus. The other day a party
was very anxious to see "Lcland
Stanford's Cactus Garden" with its j
300 varieties of sticky flora. Hoo
ver's home is still the great tourist
attraction, and Herbert himself is a
frequent passenger from Palo Alto j
station.
Among former Stanford students
who have patronized the taxis is I
Will Rogers, Jr., who made frequent
trips to the airport for the L.A. |
plane. Helen Keller has made use of j

| the hack service too.
Paly taxis don't confine their op
erations to this area but make many
trips to San Francisco. Yosemite and
Lake Tahoe ar<? often visited as well.
Taxi-drivers are victims of the
I'll-wear-a-red-carnation line as
used by the Roblcite who called and
! left the curt message for the cabman
: to "pick up a girl in a green sport
! dress."
