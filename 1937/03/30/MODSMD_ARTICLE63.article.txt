Ostensibly a conventional musical
but in reality a sort of "Pilgrim's
Progress" set to music, Paramount's
"Swing High, Swing Low" has only
Carole Lombard and some unusual

photography to
commend it. Wast
ing its principals on
a maudlin story, it
wanders on for
what seems hours
without proving
anything other

than Hollywood's child-like faith in
the drawing-power of a box-office
name.
Miss Lombard has stopped wrink
ling her nose, but aside from that
she is pretty much the same vague
soul who wandered through "My
Man Godfrey." Pleasant, to look at
and blessed with the film's best lines,
she is one of the few bright spots
in an impenetrable gloom which no
amount of sccond-rate music and
second-rate comedy can lift.
Fred Mac Murray tries hard—too
hard. He plays a mean trumpet and
he and Miss Lombard do "A Call
to Arms" very nicely; but he hits a
new high in hammy histrionics and
spoils a fairly convincing portrait
before the film ends.
Charley Butterworlh is lost, his
particular type of vague humor get
ting only one or two chances to
make itself felt. Alma Kruger, besl
of the supporting cast, is excellent
as Murphy, proprietor of one of
Panama's glorified joints. Jean Dix
on pleases in her usual role of hard
boiled-gal-with-heart-of-gold.
Go along with the mob if you like;
it isn't really worth it.
