# Court Upholds State Minimum Wage Law
## Ends 14-year Precedent; New Deal Wins 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 29 (U.R).â€”
1 The Supreme Court today reversed
itself to uphold constitutionality of
Washington state's minimum wage
law for women and, at the same
time, broke a "log jam" of cases
which have piled up since President
Roosevelt proposed reorganization
of the court.
The court ended a 14* year prece
dent of constitutional interpretation
in the Washington state case when
Justice Owen J. Robert switched
1 from the "conservative" group, v/ith
, which he voted a year ago, to the
"liberals." The decision reopened
j the field of minimum wages, maxi
j mum hours and working conditions,
j to state regulation.
Highlights Session
This ruling was the highlight of a
crowded session in which the court:
1. Upheld constitutionality of the
Railway Labor Act as amended by
the Roosevelt administration in 1934
1 along the lines of the still-to-be-de
cided Wagner Labor Act.
2. Upheld constitutionality of the
! re-enacted Frazier - Lemke farm
mortgage moratorium, designed to
| help debt-ridden farmers keep pos
session of their property.
3. Took jurisdiction of tests in
! volving constitutionality of the un
i employment tax provisions of the
Federal Social Security Act, ap
parently assuring a ruling before
June.
1!)23 Decision Reversed
i The minimum wage decision was
historic in importance becausc it
flatly overruled the court's previous
: decision in 1923 in a case technically
known as Adkins vs. Children's Hos
pital.
It turned on the plea of Elsie
| Parrish, $12 a week chambermaid
; in a Wenatchee, Wash., hotel for
back wages under an almost for
gotten state law under which $14.50
was fixed as the minimum for her
1 type of labor.
In the majority opinion Hughes
: maintained that the ruling of the
j Washington state Supreme Court
upholding the law called for a "re
examination" of the Adkins decision.
