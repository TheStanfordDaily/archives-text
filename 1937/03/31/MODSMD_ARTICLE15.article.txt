## 
### 
The appointment of Barbara Kim
ball and T. M. McDaniel as heads of
the senior class social committee was
announced last night by President
Mort D'Evelyn, to complete the ros
ter of class chairmen.
Miss Kimball and McDaniel will
be in charge of senior jolly-ups and
all events of Senior Week except
Class Day and the Senior Ball,
D'Evelyn said.
McDaniel is chairman of the Rally
Committee, a member of Cardinals
and Phi Delta Theta social fraternity.

Miss Kimball is chairman of Wom
en's Conference.
First social event of the season
probably will be the Senior Prom,
tentatively scheduled for produc
' tion this month. Definite arrange
ments cannot be made until a prom
! inent orchestra can be secured for
| the affair.
The Senior Prom traditionally has
been a part of Senior Week, but class
officials decided to hold it earlier in
| the quarter because it has previously
I been overshadowed by the Senior
: Ball.
