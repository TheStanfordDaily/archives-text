# Quad Develops Modern Motif
## Plan Direct Color Plates For Divisional Pages 
### 
Newest additions to the already
thoroughly modernistic Quad are
the six photographs in direct color
which fill the five division pages and
the frontispiece. The pictures will
show familiar scenes on the campus
enlivened by familiar faces.
Innovations in the senior section,
panel proofs for which have just
arrived, are the informa shots to
appear on each page and the en
larged size of the individual photo
graphs. This year's Quad wiil give
each senior twice as much space as
last year's.
Seek Candid Shots
Five photographers under the di
rection of Charles Steinheimer, arc
going the rounds of the campus,
seeking Candid Camera shots of
more prominent Stanforditcs. These
will be incorporated into the new
16-page Social and Candid Cam
era Sections.
Starting the spring quarter sale,
the business staff announces that a
Quad may be purchased at any time
in the Bookstore or in the A.S.S.U.
offices. Every 10 days, starting
April 6 and 7, a salesman will be at
the Post Officc to take orders. Only
a limited number will be printed.
First payment, approximately half,
is $3.17, or with name engraved,
$3.G7.
Use New Type Face
The 1937 Quad is the first pub
lication to use Onyx type. This is
a new face recently released by the
American Type Founders.
In charge of the layouts is Paul
Forster, well known San Francisco
artist. With his aid, the yearbook
promises to be up to the minute in
every detail. "Newer than day after
tomorrow" is the slogan at Wood
]K>ckcr Lodge.
