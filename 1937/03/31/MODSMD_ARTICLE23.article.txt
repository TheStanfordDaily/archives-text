# Former Hasher To Release Book Oil United States
## 
### 
Leaving for England today, Au
brey Edgington, Union hasher and
former British seaman, plans to start
a new job with the Anglo-Persian
Oil Company.
The Union hashing job was taken
in order to find material for a col
lege chapter in a book which Edg
ington has entitled "America as I
Found It." The volume will be pub
lishd in England within the next
two months. Copies are expected on
the campus near the end of this
quarter.
The recent Pacific Coast seamen's
strike didn't bother Edgington in the
least. He had already experienced
six of the same kind. "Furthermore,"
he says, "the union leaders in Amer
ica are more interested in themselves
than in the workers."
