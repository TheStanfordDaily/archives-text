# Ex Committee Election Plans Meet Trouble
## Morning Classes Check Proposed Assemblage To Present Nominees 
### 
Because the Committee on Public
Exercises refused to cancel morning
classes Thursday, April 8, for an
all-University assembly. Ex Com
mittee members were stumped last
night as to how they would present
A.S.S.U. candidates to the campus
electorate.
A morning assembly at which the
nominees for election April 13 would
be introduced, along with light en
tertainment, had been planned defi
nitely last quarter by Ex Commit
tee, but Public Exercises thumbs
were turned down. "They're afraid
,it will be a flop," someone ex
plained.
Vice-president Esther Pelton pre
sided in Jim Reynolds' absence. The
president is on a debating tour of
Central America, will not return un
til the middle of next month.
Will Try Again
Jim Ransohoff, yell leader, and
Roy Thompson, Ex Committee's
sophomore man, will approach the
Administration again this week with
a definite plan—a combination nom
inating assembly and congratulatory
rally for the title-winning basket
ball team.
Put on the spring ballot were two
Constitutional amendments. Most
important is the one which, if pass
ed, will enable Ex Committee to
limit the number of offices and po
sitions any one student may hold.
No Duplications Now
Barbara Kimball, Women's Con
ference president, and Larry Rou
ble, graduate member, found no
duplication in major offices at pres
ent, but the Committee felt it should
be empowered to make necessary
rulings in the future. That no one
should hold two salaried positions
at once was argued especially.
The other amendment, is passed,
will clear up the now muddled
preferential voting system in the
Constitution.
Other student-body business in
cluded:
PEACE I)AV: Caroline Moore,
chairman, reported plans for a
"peaceful" Peace Day here May 22.
Ex Committee granted her $200 to
bring an important speaker to head
the program and for incidental ex
penses. An assembly and various
forums, but no strike, are planned.
SKI TEAM WIN: Roy Thompson
described the Stanford ski team's
second-place win at Mt.. Ranier last
week, was told that even such "a
splendid showing" was insufficient
to warrant making skiing a minor
sport when lack of B.A.C. funds
even prohibit recognition of such a
long-standing sport as rugby.
"Why not form a roller-skating
team and award it letters," Larry
Rouble smilingly suggested. "It's
probably more popular than ski
ing."
DATES GRANTED: Senior jolly
up, April 16; Roble dance, April 24;
Kappa dance, May 1; Dramatic
