# New Theater Unfinished For Seniors
## Maritime Strike, Excess Rainfall Cause Many Delays in Construction 
### 
Class of 1937, that fought tooth and
nail for a great new theater, will
never be able to enjoy the fruits of
its victory.
It has been definitely announced
that the building will not be ready
for use this quarter. For a number
of years efforts were made to have a
new theater to replace the long
obsolete Assembly Hall and to serve
as a memorial to the Stanford men
who gave their lives in the Great
War. A small group from the senior
class had enough interest in the
project to carry on the crusade to a
successful conclusion. The army
that fought for the theater will grad
uate four days before it will be
ready to open.
Constructional Delay
The Pacific Coast maritime strike
was a great factor in the delay of
the building. Structural steel which
was shipped by water from the East
was held up together with other
building equipment. Construction
work on the exterior of the building
has been delayed during the past
tew months due to the extraordinary
amount of rainfall. Routine matters
that arise in the building of any
large project were sources of other
difficulties.
Ready June 17
According to present plans the
structure will be ready on June 17,
registration day of summer quarter.
Plans for the opening production are
indefinite, but provision will be made
in the calendar of the Division of
Speech and Drama of the School of
Fine Arts for possible delay of the
opening.
Director of Dramatics Gordon
Lange plans a number of experi
mental plays during the summer
quarter and possibly a major pro
duction in August. Several educa
tion conferences are scheduled to
be held in the theater during July,
August, and September. A formal
opening has not been arranged; it
may be postponed until the begin
ning of autumn quarter when the
the whole student body will be pres
ent for the event.
