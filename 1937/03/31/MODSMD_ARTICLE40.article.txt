# Three Days Left For Mural Signups
## 
### 
Sign-ups continue for three days
longer on Intramural Baseball,
Horseshoes, and Softball, announces
Phil Klauber, manager. Activity
was slight on the Intramural board
yesterday, indicating possibility of a
poor turnout, unless things pick up
before the lists are closed this
week-end.
Tennis has already entered its
opening 'round, which must be
played off or forfeited by next Tues
day afternoon. Some ten first
round matches remain to be played
off, and upper teams are urged to
make arrangements early. Two sin
gles matches and one doubles match
constitute the play.
