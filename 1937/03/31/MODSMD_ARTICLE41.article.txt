## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, March 30 (UP).â€”
Years of fitting through the trees in
tiger-skin trunks and rich living in
Hollywood film colony haven't
slowed Johnny (Tarzan) Weissmul
ler in the water.
The husky ex-amateur swimming
{star, racing against time in the
Hollywood Athletic Club pool,
equaled his own old world's record
of 51 seconds for the 100-yard free
style.
