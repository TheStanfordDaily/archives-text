Except for furnishings, the Lobby
i Nitery in the Old Union was fin
| ished yesterday when Corp Yard
I workmen applied wax and polish to
j the floor of the huge room adjacent
to the A.S.S.U. main office.
Drypes, overstuffed chairs and
I davenports, tables and rugs will be
â–  moved in by David Keeble, Palo Alto
! interior decorator, as soon as his
| plans are approved finally by Chris
| tine Rieker, Union director, and Stu
! dent Manager Fontius. "Within two
1 or three weeks," Keeble said last
! night.
Officers of the dramatic manager,
] debate manager, speakers' bureau,
j and other A.S.S.U. committees were
| moved upstairs to the east end of
j the Old Union dormitory floor,
j Though these second-floor offices are
j now occupied, they still are being
painted and plastered.
When the Lobby-Nitery is opened
"for business,'' within the fortnight,
it will be used as a reading-tmd
chatting room in the daytime, a
dancery until 8 o'clock on week
] nights. On special occasions the fur
| niture will be rearranged, tables
| brought up from the Cellar, the place
| transformed into a "night club."
