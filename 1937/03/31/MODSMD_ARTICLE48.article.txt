There was supposed to be a little
blurb in this column yesterday, ill
penned though it was, on rugby and
how the team won both the Calif oi - -
nia Rugby Union and California In
tercollegiate conference champion
ships by beating California's varsity
(J-0 in the stadium March 6. March
<5, you see, was the day following
the last issue of the Daily during
winter quarter, and so there has
been nothing said, on paper, about
the champs.
However, because of difficulties
which arose in regard to space, it
was discovered necessary by the
night editor to delete something,
late in the cvcningVi toil. His
eagle eye fell upon rugby as the
only thing that could be left out
without disturbing the entire
scheme of things, so rugby gets
its play today.
The men that get out to play rug
by are a group almost alone in the
world of sport, in the sense that
they play the game because they
like it and for no other reason.
There are no awards of any kind
given by the school, at the end of
the season the team gets nothing
but a nice rest. It's heartening to
see fellows play for fun, and not for
glory or reward.
There is little grandstand play
in rugger, mainly because there is
usually very little grandstand to
play to. The publicity, too, is uoi
worth getting a literal kicking
around for. When everything is
deducted, all there is left for the
players as reward is fun.
While rugby is on tap, there might
be something said in felicitating the
coaching stall', too. Harry Maloney
and Jim Wiley handled the team
again this year, and they must have
done a good job or it wouldn't have
won the titles. Both the men have
long been associated with rugby,
both know much in the arts of the
game.
It isn't only knowledge of the
game, though, that gives a coach a
winning team. The team has to like
its coach well enough to play for
him. Anybody could play for the
golden-hearted minor sports direc
tor with the Irish name and the rich
Highland burr, Harry Maloney.
Coach Brutus Hamilton is unde
cided as to the running of the Ar
chie Williams when his Bears tackle
the Bruins Saturday, for Archie has
been bothered by a muscle pain and
the Berkeley mentor doesn't want to
take any chances.
The withdrawal of Williams
from the 440 destroys what in

prospect would have been one of
the (inest quarter-mile races on
the Coast this year. Perhaps the
time might not have been a rec
ord, but Bob Young of U.C.L.A.
has better time to date than
the mocha flash and he undoubt
edly would have given the Olym
pic title-holder one of his tough
est races of the year, and quite
possibly might have beaten him.
Without that race there is little
that looms as exciting in the meet.
It should be the Bears all the way,
with the Bruins getting a look-in in
the javeljn, the 440, the relay, and
possibly the hurdles.
While that Big Brother - Little
Brother fight is going on across the
bay, Dink Templeton's team is go
ing to have its hands full trying to
make a presentable score against the
Olympic Club, an outfit boomed as
the strongest dual meet team in the
country.
Dink has been working out his
strategy for the meet in an at
tempt to make a better showing
against the Winged O boys than
did the Bears, but everything is
still dark. Ed Burrows will be
back in the mije Saturday, with
Tiger Alexander sticking to the
two-mile only. The gangling red
head, jf he can pull his time down
just a little more, is liable to make
things tough for Bright and Rob
inson of the Club. Everybody
gave him up for lost a month ago,
but that surprising 4:38.8 mile
against U.C.L.A. last week puts
him back into consideration.
