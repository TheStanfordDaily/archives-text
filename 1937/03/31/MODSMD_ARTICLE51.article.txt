# Cardinal Nine Drops Game To St. Mary's
## Moragamen Shove Tribe To Fourth League Spot In Sloppy 8-5 Victory 
### 
Stanford's baseball nine continued
their losing streak by dropping an
8 to 5 decision to St, Mary's yester
day afternoon at the sunken dia
mond. This defeat shoves the Cards
down into fourth place with five
wins against four losses.
The Gaels nicked pitcher Kay
Weiershauser for seven safeties in
three innings to grab a 4-1 lead be
fore Spike Furman was sent in to
stem the Gael barrage of hits. Fur
man and Rasmussen, who relieved
him later, allowed the Moragans only
two hits in six innings but errors by
the infield gave St. Mary's four more
runs.
Harry Marrill went the route for
the Gaels, and was very effective for
eight innings, but he tired a little in
the ninth stanza when the tribe
bunched four hits to score three
runs. Shortstop Larry Webber and
centerfielder Stolich were the out
standing men with the stick for the
Gaels, while no Stanford batter gar
nered moje than one safe blow.
