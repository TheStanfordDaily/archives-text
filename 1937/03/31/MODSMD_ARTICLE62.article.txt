# Not So Precious
## 
### 
STANFORD theatergoers learned yesterday
that instead of beefsteak and onions for
their last dramatic meal in the old Assembly
Hall, Mr. Lange and his troupe will serve up a
dish of exceedingly weak tea.
A year ago a little Chinese fairy tale called
"Lady Precious Stream" opened as a Broadway
play. Two weeks later, Time had found
it as "unimportantly amusing as a visit to a
nursery," "Lady Precious Stream" closed. New
York did not like it.
But, true to the past, Stanford thespians let
artistic ambition and enthusiasm warp their
idea of Farm show tastes. In the face of years
of losses at the Assembly Hall box-office, they
deliberately chose this oriental museum piece
for the spring quarter production.
It is a play supposed "to charm American
spectators by presenting the Chinese theater in
all its childish ingenuousness." It is the type
of drama in which heavily robed characters tap
their foreheads to indicate thought. It is a play
in which the leading lady hides in a cave for
18 years waiting for her faithless husband.
"Lady Precious Stream" went well in Shang
hai and London where skilled actors could
handle the difficult characters, where a suffi
cient audience could be found to enjoy its droll
delicacy. But at Stanford, with Stanford ama
teurs tripping across the stage attempting to
be quaint, "Lady Precious Stream" is highly
inappropriate.
Director Lange likes "Lady Precious Stream"
because it is different, because it will bring
national publicity to Stanford drama. He likes
it because it will be difficult to put across, not
because it will be enjoyed by a Farm audience.
But Mr. Lange should do his experimenting
in workshop productions, present plays as
major productions only if they have been suc
cessful in New York—only if a full evening's
entertainment can be guaranteed those who
have paid to sit out front.—D. B.
