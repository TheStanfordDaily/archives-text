# Let's Legalize Graft
## 
### 
WHEN not saying "I am deeply shocked,"
San Francisco officials suggest what to
do about their naughty city.
Perhaps their suggestions are designed to
confuse the original intention of the Atherton
report: exposure of police vice graft.
But perhaps suggesting means to ameliorate
conditions in the oldest profession is more fun
than wondering why Central Station flatfoots
can afford a rest at Palm Springs.
So far the best smoke-screen, if the sugges
tions may be so called, has been "Let's legalize
prostitution."
Because previous investigations showed
which way the votes blew, most old-line poli
ticians oscillate their eyebrows furiously at the
idea.
To give Post Street's scarlet harridans legal
protection simply doesn't fit the city's expressed
Sunday-go-to-meetin' morality.
The only way to control prostitution, booms
Public Health Director Geiger, is to keep it on
the run, a furtive business. The doctor doesn't
discuss syphilis, inevitable concomitant of that
business, which is furtive, but definitely not on
the run.
He doesn't have to. Legalization of prostitu
tion doesn't sound well on the public piano,
played most noisily not by thinking voters, but
by such pressure groups as women's clubs.
And you'll find most people loudest in their
condemnation of legalized sin, most apprecia
tive of the romance of a sinful city without
benefit of ordinance. They like things the old
fashioned way.
So, with legalization of prostitution a dying
issue, we suggest: "Let's legalize graft."
It also doesn't sound pretty, but it's a new
tune for San Francisco's civic pianny. And it
would settle, once and for all, the case of Pete
("The Man to See") McDonough and the
wealthy policemen.
It would take the mystery and the scandal
out of graft by putting it on the city auditor's
books. It would move the mythical and sym
bolic "back room" into the civic auditorium.
No one would have an unfair advantage, be
cause any one could find out how to "fix" the
city simply by asking the City Hall elevator
operators who was "the man to see."
"The Man" would be a sort of "Ask Mr. Fos
ter" with an executive arm.
By short moves of his office from floor to
floor of the City Hall, the "octopus strangling
law and justice in this fair city" would still be
conventionally furtive to the sight. He would
simply smell unfurtively.
