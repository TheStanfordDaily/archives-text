# Turning Off a Shower
## 
### 
A COMELY co-ed "showered, studied, shot,
and spooned" before the camera some
days ago, and several national magazines
spread the delicious bit across the country.
Drake University and Heloise Martin and the
shower shot, retouched or unretouched, sky
rocketed into the spotlight.
To sensation hunters it was a "natural." He
loise is pretty, her partner in the "embrace"
scene is a footballer, and Drake's Daily editor
has a black eye. Figuratively speaking, the
affair nears perfection.
But to Drake University officials it was a
pain in the neck, for there is something dis
tinctly upsetting to the collective University
President and Dean about publicity of this par
ticular consistency spread too copiously. Their
distaste is justifiable.
What almost equaled Drake's shower shot in
news value last week, was Drake's administra
tive action. After the first bombshell exploded,
sensible Dean of Women Carrie Cubbage
squelched newshawks who sought to squeeze
more juice out of the tasty affair with her tag
line on the adventures of Heloise: "Drake does
not intend to take any action."
Drake officials, like all university officials,
cannot control each student move. But through
refusal to become involved, Drake officials did
distinguish themselves by not sinking to the
petty piddling of their adolescent charges.â€”
