T HAVE a problem for the Food Research Institute
professoriate, if they ever get tired of writing their
"Bread Is the Staff of Life, Eat More of It" mono
graphs. The problem concerns Stanford's garbage
disposal plant just south of Encina Hall.
I should like to have the scientists settle an argu
ment that has arisen amongst my H-man force. One
H-man appeared to me in a vision, representing him
self as a mustard plaster to a fevered ham sandwich,
and said that the plant really turned out a very dis
posable product one day last quarter. This seemed to
be a rather rash statement to plaster around, and I
queried him closely.
He said that the frosh couldn't understand it either,
but after they walked out they noticed that the head
sponsc had invited President Wilbur over to the Com
mons for lunch.
Even this seemed too much to swallow, so I called
in my counter-espionage H-man service and checked
up. The second H-man checked in. I asked him point
blank about the swillelegant food on that certain date.
"Don't be silly," he said. "It was lousy."
So you can see that the matter is out of my hands.
The problem is placed squarely up to Science.
f T , HERE was a frosh member of the ski team who
competed in the tournament up in the North
Country for Stanford. After slaloming himself all
over the country and making his telemark in thcworld
by taking second place for the sake of Christiana and
Stanford, he collapsed into waiting arms and was taken
into the clubhouse. There he was restored to con
sciousness and considerably cheered as people con
gratulated him for his sacrifice to Stanford. Along
with warming liquids he was brought a communica
tion hot from the Stanford Convalescent Home. The
message stated plainly that he had flunked out.
Cheering news about Our Hasher's foh-bit com
pendium of world history, due and printable this
quarter, is contained in the little book on the Cellar
Cigar Counter. It seems that 13 people have signed
that they want a copy. With Gist and myself, this
brings the total up to 15.
