IT'S PAPA AND MAMA WIIO TAY
r pHIS column today is for the benefit and edification
of the parents, who, at the beginning of each
quarter, give Little Amy and big Joe a nest egg of
some $115 and tell them both to go off to college and
get themselves graduated, but not in a glass.
For a long time we have heard about what a won
derful place college is and how it helps us to live a
better life and how it will help us to get a job when
we get out o£ school.
We labor under the delusion htat if we graduate
from college we are of the upper two per cent and
that we arc necessarily pretty smart.
But wc aren't smart. We're just dopes.
* * * *
We're dopes bccausc we pay $114 plus $1 for
the new theater which isn't finished yet and for the
following goods.
Below is the pipe hunter's dream come true, right in
the middle of the Spring Quarter Time Schedule. For
instance:
As a student of Stanford University you arc en
titled to take the following courses:
Chemistry 293. Gibber Thermodynamics in Phys
ical Chemistry (Van Ryssclberghe, c3) (2) No fee.
Education 110. Girl Scout Training Course (1) No
fee.
Engineering 163. Fluid Motion, dhr (Jacobsen,
261 A).
100. Polo (Grubbs), (1) Squad B, $10, Squad C,
$5.
5. Hippology. TTh (Grubbs, 521). No fee.
171. Sewer Design, dhur Reynolds, 276). No fee.
4c * * *
If you are a woman, you can take these courses:
Badminton, Equitation, Canoeing, which one girl
took last year but is auditing again this year, Folk
Dancing, Golf, Philosophy of the Dance, and Women
in the Home.
If you like the great outdoors, and who doesn't dur
ing Spring quarter, you can take a little dinger
called Natural History 230, Phylogeny of Angiosperms
dhr (Abrams, nhm), or you can take another called
Flowering Plants, also given by Mr. Abrams, or an
other called Birds and Other Vertebrates.
* * # *
This brings to mind the time when they used to
give a course in fly-casting out at the Encina Swim
mint? Pools, which wasn't very well attended becausc
it always came at 10:00 on Saturday morning and no
one felt much like casting for imaginary fish in the
swimming pools especially on Saturday morning.
So reading over the Time Schedule you begin to
get the idea as to why some people call Stanford a
country club and wonder not a little as to the validity
of this Harvard of the West business,

We labor under the delusion htat if we graduate

We're dopes bccausc we pay $114 plus $1 for

ical Chemistry (Van Ryssclberghe, c3) (2) No fee.

If you are a woman, you can take these courses:
Badminton, Equitation, Canoeing, which one girl

If you like the great outdoors, and who doesn't dur
ing Spring quarter, you can take a little dinger
called Natural History 230, Phylogeny of Angiosperms

This brings to mind the time when they used to
give a course in fly-casting out at the Encina Swim
mint? Pools, which wasn't very well attended becausc
it always came at 10:00 on Saturday morning and no
one felt much like casting for imaginary fish in the
swimming pools especially on Saturday morning.
So reading over the Time Schedule you begin to
get the idea as to why some people call Stanford a
country club and wonder not a little as to the validity
of this Harvard of the West business,
