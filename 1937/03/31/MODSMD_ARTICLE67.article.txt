# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						PLAY'S THE THING 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday tryouts were held for
Dramatic Council's production for
spring quarter, "Lady Precious
Stream." This play opened in New
York in February 1936 and lasted
two weeks, which means that it laid
an ostrich egg. Critics of the New
York Times, Stage, Time, and the
New Yorker dubbed it a lovely
artistic experience which even an
experienced cast, of able actors
headed by Helen Chandler and
Bramwell Fletcher could not make
quite palatable. One reviewer char
acterized it as "an exquisitely whim
sical chinoiserie"—just made for the
Stanford rough.
It isn't the choice of this particular
unsuccessful play that causes this
gripe but the fact that a number of
recent campus productions have
been flops on Broadway, our na
tional dramatic proving ground.
True it is that Lord and Lady Tit
tersby of London enjoyed "Lady
Precious Stream" for 365 successive
nights after 365 progressive grouse
dinners. But this is Stanford Uni
versity, U.S.A., and if Park Avenue
can't support Oriental comic fan
tasy for more than two weeks, we
can't support it for two minutes.
Let those with supreme good taste
in the faith of the British know that
last quarter's play, "This Side Idol
atry," ran for ten days in dear old
London. Hailed as one of the cam
pus' best productions, it was basi
cally a weak, not-too-well-written
play. Acting, direction, settings, cos
tumes were beyond reproach, but
Mr. Lange started with a scrap of
liver instead of a hunk of red, juicy
beef.
Last fall's production, "Roadside,"
was a muddled piece of writing, un
worthy of the fine treatment it re
ceived. Since only one production is
given each quarter and a great deal
of energy is expended on it, I think
that it should be a sound, proven
vehicle. It won't be necessary to
produce a leg show or a French
farce to amuse Stanford men; they
are really fairly intelligent under
their caveman veneer. But nobody
is going to fall for "Lady Precious
Stream." An old legend presented
in the Chinese manner cannot be
considered ideal material for any
college audience. Someone has sug
gested that Chinese girls should
serve tea to the audience during the
performance to heighten the atmos
phere or something—how about beer
for the rough seats?
Experimental plays of this type
are interesting and profitable for
drama students but not for general
campus consumption. Let Director
Lange save these experiments for
the Division of Dramatics in the new
theater. But "chinoiserie" in the As
sembly Hall just won't go. Students
pay $115 to the University every
quai*ter. Dramatics is a fine ac
tivity that takes a lot of time. Per
haps that time shoifld be put in on
material that we know is good, even
though Variety does not announce
an American premiere on the Farm.
I haven't read "Lady Precious
Stream"; I will when I have time.
But meanwhile the opinion of four
crack critics and the New York
theater-goers is enough to convince
me that it's not the play for Stan
ford. Mr. Lange will probably give
it as good a presentation as his first
two offerings, but someone once
said "the play's the thing."

in the faith of the British know that
last quarter's play, "This Side Idol
atry," ran for ten days in dear old
London. Hailed as one of the cam
pus' best productions, it was basi
cally a weak, not-too-well-written
play. Acting, direction, settings, cos
tumes were beyond reproach, but
Mr. Lange started with a scrap of
liver instead of a hunk of red, juicy
beef.
Last fall's production, "Roadside,"
was a muddled piece of writing, un
worthy of the fine treatment it re
ceived. Since only one production is
given each quarter and a great deal
of energy is expended on it, I think
that it should be a sound, proven
vehicle. It won't be necessary to
produce a leg show or a French
farce to amuse Stanford men; they
are really fairly intelligent under
their caveman veneer. But nobody
is going to fall for "Lady Precious
Stream." An old legend presented
in the Chinese manner cannot be
considered ideal material for any
college audience. Someone has sug
gested that Chinese girls should
serve tea to the audience during the
performance to heighten the atmos
phere or something—how about beer
for the rough seats?
Experimental plays of this type
are interesting and profitable for
drama students but not for general
campus consumption. Let Director
Lange save these experiments for
the Division of Dramatics in the new
theater. But "chinoiserie" in the As
sembly Hall just won't go. Students
pay $115 to the University every
quai*ter. Dramatics is a fine ac
tivity that takes a lot of time. Per
haps that time shoifld be put in on
material that we know is good, even
though Variety does not announce
an American premiere on the Farm.
I haven't read "Lady Precious
Stream"; I will when I have time.
But meanwhile the opinion of four
crack critics and the New York
theater-goers is enough to convince
me that it's not the play for Stan
ford. Mr. Lange will probably give
it as good a presentation as his first
two offerings, but someone once
said "the play's the thing."

The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday tryouts were held for
Dramatic Council's production for
spring quarter, "Lady Precious
Stream." This play opened in New
York in February 1936 and lasted
two weeks, which means that it laid
an ostrich egg. Critics of the New
York Times, Stage, Time, and the
New Yorker dubbed it a lovely
artistic experience which even an
experienced cast, of able actors
headed by Helen Chandler and
Bramwell Fletcher could not make
quite palatable. One reviewer char
acterized it as "an exquisitely whim
sical chinoiserie"—just made for the
Stanford rough.
It isn't the choice of this particular
unsuccessful play that causes this
gripe but the fact that a number of
recent campus productions have
been flops on Broadway, our na
tional dramatic proving ground.
True it is that Lord and Lady Tit
tersby of London enjoyed "Lady
Precious Stream" for 365 successive
nights after 365 progressive grouse
dinners. But this is Stanford Uni
versity, U.S.A., and if Park Avenue
can't support Oriental comic fan
tasy for more than two weeks, we
can't support it for two minutes.
Let those with supreme good taste
