## Heavy Rainfall Raises District's Water Level 
### 
A plentiful water supply for Stan
ford and the Santa Clara Valley in
coming years was foreseen by Pro
fessor Cyrus F. Tolman, of the geol
ogy department, yesterday.
Upon the basis of the heavier rain
fall this year and the retention of
water in dams throughout the val
ley, Professor Tolman predicted that
"in the long run the water level will
go back to that of 15 or 20 years
ago."
Rainfall to date this year is 19.25
inches, which is several inches above
the average total annual rainfall in
recent yeax*s.
Tolman explained that now "there
is a plentiful supply of water in all
reservoirs in Santa Clara Valley.
That water will largely be retained
in the dams until summer, and then
will be gradually allowed to flow
down the streams, thus percolating
into the ground and keeping the wa
ter level constant."
The result of retaining water in
the dams, he said, will be nine
months of run-off in the streams,
instead of the three months' run-off
at the present time.
Tolman blamed the decline of the
water level in past years upon light
annual rainfalls. If the heavier rains
continue, he expects that "the water
level will be brought back rather
more rapidly than it was depleted by
over-heavy pumping."
