j\OT as the Divine Comedy but !
as the Human Comedy pro
duced and directed by man himself
—that is how James Harvey Robin
son chooses to view the drama of j
man's activities upon earth, in his
book.
Pessimists look at this drama and
scoff at man's puny inability as its
director. As an actor he is still jusl
strutting and fretting upon the
world stage; and the particular act
now being played does not prove his
talent: a muddle of wars, poverty, j
prejudice and murder.
Sees Other Side
But James Harvey Robinson sees |
the other side of the play. For him j
Man has reached a point in civiliza
tion where he can quietly push open
the door and enter Utopia, if only
he will. He can easily produce all
he needs in a few hours a day.
Drudgery and slavery have no real
place in the modern world. In the
field of medicine he has already and
is daily learning to cure the most
destructive diseases. Health, lei
sure, and plenty—what more does j
he need for the Utopian life?
What, then, is holding him back?
Robinson sums up the reason in one
phrase: "We continue to think of
new things in old ways. Our senti
ments teem with anachronisms of
which we are as yet unconscious."
Man Overcomes Lag
It remains then only for man to
overcome the lag in his thinking
habits and catch up to his knowl
edge. In order to banish the "sanc
tity" that clings about the familiar
habits of thought, Robinson believes
we must turn to a thorough exam
ination of history. When he under
stands how man got to be as he is,
then we can say good-bye to super
j stitions.
James Harvey Robinson unfolds
this theory of his, the product of one
of the best informed minds of mod

| ern times in "The Human Comedy."
I His imagination endows his facts
with force. Historical theory from
Robinson breathes and lives in con
crete images. To Hairy Elmer
Barnes, a former friend and student
ol Robinson, thinking people arc in
i debted for the preparation of this
manuscript for publication.
