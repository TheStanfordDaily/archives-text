# States Unable To Deal With Wage Cases
## Legislation Is Indaequate Despite Court Ruling, Roosevelt Declares 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 30 (U.R).—
President Roosevelt said at his press
conference today that he has not
changed his opinion that state legis
lation is inadequate to deal with
minimum wage problems despite
yesterday's Supreme Court decision
reversing 14 years of precedent and
upholding the Washington State
minimum wage law for women.
This was the President's only in
direct reference to the court deci
sion but in addition he said he had
asked Attorney General Homer S.
Cummings for an opinion on whe
ther the District of Columbia's mini
mum wage law — invalidated in
1923 in the Adkins case which the
court overruled yesterday—is now
returned to the statute books.
If the law has not automatically
been restored to force, the President
said, another ought to be passed. He
added that he favors including men
and children in the provisions regu
lating wages.
Refuses to Comment
The President declined a direct re
quest for comment on the Supreme
Court but made a negative answer
when asked whether he had changed
the opinions on wage legislation
which he has expressed in speeches.
He said he had not listened to last
night's speech by Senator Carter
Glass, D., Va., attacking the plan,
and that he had not had time to read
any of the court opinions.

battle over the President's court re

Senators Argue
The Senate Judiciary Committee
resumed hearings with both sides
eager to show that the court's mini
mum wage decision bore out the ar
guments they have been making for
months.
Administration supporters held
that in reversing itself and reopen
ing to state regulation a field from
which the states were barred for 14
years the court in effect admitted the
truth of Mr. Roosevelt's argument
that it had created a "no man's
land" where no governmental power
could be exercised.
Opposition Senators, however, in
sisted that by reversing itself the
court exhibited commendable cour
age in admitting that it made an
"honest mistake" and that the con
stitution, not the court, should be
changed.
