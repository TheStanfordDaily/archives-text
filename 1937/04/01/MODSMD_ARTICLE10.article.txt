# Lange Praises 'Precious' 'Ideal for Spring Season'
## 
### SUZANNE HAMMOND 
The fine opportunity offered by '
"Lady Precious Stream" for the
many women on the campus who
possess dramatic talent, is given by
Dramatic Director Gordon Lange as
one of the chief i-easons for Dra
matic Council's selection of this play
for their spring quarter production.
Previous shows, such as "Road
side" and "This Side Idolatry," have
contained extremely few feminine
roles, whereas in "Lady Precious
Stream" the title part as well as at
least four strong supporting roles
are taken by women.
Situation Is Ideal
According to Mr. Lange, the play
also is ideal for this time of the year,
being humorous and in keeping with
the season. In addition, he feels
that Stanford is ideally situated for
the production of such a play, due
to the proximity of San Francisco's
large Chinatown, the fact that there
is an active organization of Chinese
students on the campus, and because

of the widespread interest in Chi
nese affairs on the Pacific Coast.
Mr. Lange believes it also should
be the responsibility of Stanford to
present through the theater a feeling
for cultures other than its own, such
as the Oriental.
New York Not Proof
The production is not an experi
mental play in any sense other than
that it is different from the average
student presentation. Neither is' the
fact that the play was not success
ful in New York important. In proof
of this Mr. Lange cited the fact that
a play which failed on Broadway
now is being highly considered for
this year's Pulitzer prize.
He also claims that there is no
excuse for college dramatics existing
on the basis of only presenting plays
which have had a successful run on
Broadway, and assumes that there
are a sufficient number of cultured
and intelligent people on the Stan
ford campus who would enjoy such
a play as "Lady Precious Stream."
