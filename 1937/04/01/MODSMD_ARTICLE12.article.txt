WASHINGTON, D.C., March 31.
(U.R).â€”Sit-down strikes were both
condemned as un-American and jus
tified as resulting from ruthless tac
tics of employers in Congress today.
Representative Martin Dies (D.,
Tex.) requested the House rules
' committee to support his proposal
5 for a congressional investigation of
sit-down strike technique, and con
| tended that "Communists are ac
tive in the sit-down strikes."
Senator Robert F. Wagner (D.,
N.Y.). author of the National Labor
Relations Act, criticized corpora
tions which have attacked the law
; in the courts, and contended that sit
down strikes have been provoked by
1 the actions of employers who have
"openly banded together, to defy this
I law."
