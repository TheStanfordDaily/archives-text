# Class of '37 Thwarted In Theater Plan
## Weather, Strike Conspire To Set Completion Date 8 Days Back 
### 
One week and a day isn't a very
long time, but to 1937's seniors it
might as well be a century. They
graduate June 13 and on June 21 the
Stanford Memorial Theater, their
prime project, will be ready lor use.
The weather man, Pacific Coast
maritime workers, and changes in
plans for the theater seem to have
conspired to thwai't the seniors in
their fondest dream.
Building Started 1935
Months of planning took the first
step toward realization when the
first excavations for the theater
were made in November, 1935. Only
a month later steel construction was
held up for last-minute changes in
designs for the theater.
Progress was resumed when the
first concrete was poured February
20, 1936, and the foundation was
completed in a month. Again, ar
rangements were made for frame
work steel to be sent here from
Pittsburgh. Then a flood swept
down on the Pennsylvania city and
shipping traffic was paralyzed.
Gloom moved in on the Farm.
This time the set - back lasted
until May 11, 1936, when the first
steel beam rose over the foundation.
In November the framework was
complete and an April opening for
the theater was announced by the
Administration. Spirits rose and
gloom slunk away from the campus.
Maritime Strike Delays
But not for long. Maritime work
ers decided to air their grievances
and while the strike went on in San
Francisco, materials and equipment
for Stanford's theater lay in the
holds of ships lining the bay city's
waterfront.
Just as plastering got under way,
winter descended on Palo Alto and
work again was held up. Still the
seniors clung to their last hope, to
see the theater opened before they
closed their Stanford careers.
Then came the announcement that
the theater at last was to be finished
—just eight days too late. Gloom
chuckled and made Stanford his per
manent address.
Egyptians Waited
Seniors are consoling themselves
with the thought that while the
Egyptians spent hundreds of years
building the pyramids, with a few
more "unforeseen delays" Stanford's
Memorial Theater may yet break
| all records.
Sympathizing with the disap
pointed graduating class, John Lea
vers, superintendent of construction,
yesterday stated that "pi'actically all
delays have been due to shipments
held up in the East and unavoidable
natural conditions."

long time, but to 1937's seniors it
might as well be a century. They
graduate June 13 and on June 21 the
Stanford Memorial Theater, their
prime project, will be ready lor use.
The weather man, Pacific Coast
maritime workers, and changes in
plans for the theater seem to have
conspired to thwai't the seniors in
their fondest dream.
Building Started 1935
Months of planning took the first
step toward realization when the
first excavations for the theater
were made in November, 1935. Only
a month later steel construction was
held up for last-minute changes in
designs for the theater.
Progress was resumed when the
first concrete was poured February
20, 1936, and the foundation was
completed in a month. Again, ar
rangements were made for frame
work steel to be sent here from
Pittsburgh. Then a flood swept
down on the Pennsylvania city and
shipping traffic was paralyzed.
Gloom moved in on the Farm.
This time the set - back lasted
until May 11, 1936, when the first
steel beam rose over the foundation.
In November the framework was
complete and an April opening for
the theater was announced by the
Administration. Spirits rose and
gloom slunk away from the campus.
Maritime Strike Delays
But not for long. Maritime work
ers decided to air their grievances
and while the strike went on in San
Francisco, materials and equipment
for Stanford's theater lay in the
holds of ships lining the bay city's
waterfront.
Just as plastering got under way,
winter descended on Palo Alto and
work again was held up. Still the
seniors clung to their last hope, to
see the theater opened before they
closed their Stanford careers.
Then came the announcement that
the theater at last was to be finished
—just eight days too late. Gloom
chuckled and made Stanford his per
manent address.
Egyptians Waited
Seniors are consoling themselves
with the thought that while the
Egyptians spent hundreds of years
building the pyramids, with a few
more "unforeseen delays" Stanford's
Memorial Theater may yet break
| all records.
Sympathizing with the disap
pointed graduating class, John Lea
vers, superintendent of construction,
yesterday stated that "pi'actically all
delays have been due to shipments
held up in the East and unavoidable
natural conditions."
