# A.S.S.U. Offices Are Relocated
## Old Union Settles Down After Moving Day 
### 
Old Union doors are back on their
hinges and Old Union dust is settling
now that the A.S.S.U. offices, moved
to make room for the Nitcry, arc in
their new location on the sccond
floor.
Despite the pajama-clad roughs
who patter downstairs to their beds
on the sleeping porch, women can
attend the late committee meetings
in the new offices, now that a door
has been placed at the head of the
stairs to block off the men's quarters.
In moving office furniture to the
rooms, A.S.S.U. executives found
difficulty negotiating the narrow
halls and varying floor levels. Doors
had to be taken from their hinges
to give the necessary clearance to
some of the large tables.
In spite of the moving-day chaos,
however, Student Manager Chuck
Fontius is pleased with the new loca
tion of the offices. "One more com
mit tee room than formerly will be a
help," he says.
