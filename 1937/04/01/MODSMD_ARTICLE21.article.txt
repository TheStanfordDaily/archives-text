### 
LONDON, March 31 (UP).—Pres
ident Roosevelt was reported to
night to be organizing a world peace
offensive in an effort to avert Eu
rope's headlong plunge into a gen
eral war arising from the Spanish
holocaust.
The President's recognition of
Europe's bitter plight came at an
hour when the Spanish revolution
appeared to be woxking up steam
for a "blow-off."
General Francisco Franco's mili
tary rebellion seemed on the verge
of a crack-up as internal revolt and
a combined military and diplomatic
offensive reaching out to three con
tinents gave the odds of victory to
his loyalist enemies.
Grave possibilities from the
crowded events of the day included:
1. Davis' arrival in London' to
confer with British statesmen on a
possible Washington conference on
world problems.
2. Franco's iron-fisted efforts to
quell uprisings among his troops.
3. Increased Italo-British tension
and grave apprehensions in anti-
Fascist countries lest Mussolini —
harassed by crushing rebel defeats
and their blow to his prestige—drive

leaping openly into the Spanish war.
4. France's sharp warning to
Fianco to stop interfering with
French shipping, under threat of
naval reprisal—a warning almost
identical to one sent by Great Brit
ain 24 hours ago.
5. Reports tliat, despite the war
like British and French warnings, a
British steamer and a French
lreighter were halted yesterday by
rebel warships.
