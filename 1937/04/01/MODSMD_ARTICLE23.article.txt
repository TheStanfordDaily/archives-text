# Dave Rider Wins 1500-meter Honors
## 
### 
Dave Rider, Stanford's premier
varsity swimmer at any distance
from 440 yards up, churned out the
best time of his career for 1500
meters, 20:05.3, to take sccond to
John Macionis of Yale in the Na
tional Collegiate A.A. championships
held at Minneapolis last Friday.
Macionis, with a reputation as
one of the finest swimmers in
America, was pressed to win in
13:59.8 from Rider, who went into
the meet, virtually unknown in na
tional competition. His showing
came as a surprise, and marks him
as possible future great, in the eyes
of his coach, Nort Thornton.
