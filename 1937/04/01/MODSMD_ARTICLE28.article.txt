# Chilean Visits Farm History Class Group
## Distinguished Foreigner Tells of His Country; Lauds U. S. Colleges 
### 
Stanford had a distinguished visi
tor from Chile Tuesday, when Sena
tor Mascimiano Errazuriz, traveling
through America on a diplomatic
mission to Japan and China, ducked
an invitation to a San Francisco
committee meeting to talk before
Professor Percy A. Martin's South
American history class at 11 o'clock.
Chileans Know Stanford
Senator Errazuriz, tall, blond, and
speaking in clipped, precise Eng
lish, told of his country, its govern
ment, universities, resources, and
history.
Chile is the only democracy in
South America. "Little by little
democratic government is giving
way to dictatorship all over South
America," the Senator said.
One reason for the growing com
munistic spirit, he believes, is the
entire freedom of education, result
ing in an overflow of professionals
without work.
Tells of Homeland
Senator Errazuriz admires the
American colleges, claiming that
Stanford University is well known
n Chile, where the United States
education is held as a model. Chile
lias three universities, one state uni
versity in Santiago, and two private
; chools. But all schools are con
uolled by the state, even as far as
jiving examinations and conferring
i egrees.
The Senator discredited any war
l.ke reputation attributed to Chile,
iuying, "No other country is so
I acific, loves peace so much, as Chile,
v hich has no reason whatever to fear
i. .ternational conflict."
