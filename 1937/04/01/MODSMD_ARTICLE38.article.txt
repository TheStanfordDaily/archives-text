Does the fact that the word "pipe"
is Stanfordesque for a "cinch" course
have any bearing on the fact that
"smoke-up" means in the same lan
guage a "cinch" notice?
of many such eccentrici
ties in the speech of the Stanford
student • are equally uncertain.
"Quad," of course, is an abbreviation
for "quadrangle," referring to the
geometrical shape of the central unit
of the University. "Pix," meaning
picture, is another example of ab
breviation for convenience's sake,
which was made popular partly by
use in the Daily.
Other» common journalistic jargon
brought into local usage by campus
publications include such gems as
"crud," "guff," and "grut." The basic
meaning of all the above is essen
tially the same—simply "bull." That
brings up the time-honored ex
pression "bull-session," so dear to
the hearts of all true Stanfordites.
Such corrupt collegisms as "bawl

out," "flunk," "libe," sound perfectly
normal to the average "rough," but
would be totally devoid of meaning
to the uninitiated.
To "go row," to "crack an ex," or
to "know it cold" could mean prac
tically anything or nothing when
analyzed. To "go to town" might be
construed as a trip to San Francisco,
but any Farmster "in the know"
would realize without second
thought that that captial of capital
ists is designated exclusively by the
word "city" (even if the student in
question is a Los Angelan).
On other campi the popular par
lance has developed along other
lines. At U.C.L.A. the word "greep"
is sweeping the "co-op"* (Bruin
equivalent to the Stanford Union).
"Greep" is the latest synonym for
our overworked "droop." University
of Nebraskans designate by the term
j "smoothie" the type of person we
might call a "honey." At the Uni
versity of Michigan, the "diagonal"
I fills the place of our "quad."
