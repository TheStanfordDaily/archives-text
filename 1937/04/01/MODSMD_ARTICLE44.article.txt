Brick Morse, University of Cali
fornia's perennial freshman who
comes out every now and then and
once and a while in between with
a column in one of the San Fran
cisco papers, had his usual pre
pre-Big Meet fling at the track sit
uation yesterday morning.
Every year about a month or so in
advance of the Card-Bear meet
Brick gets in his first licks, and
more times than not his column is
an attempt to put the Bears in the
underdog position, if they're not al
ready >there.
Earlier in lite year there wasn't
a sports writer in the Bay Region
that would have given Stanford a
Ht-10-l chance (o take Brutus
Hamilton's team. Why, the Cal
oii( lit was the second-best college
dual meet track team in the coun
try, right behind U.S.C. Things
have changed a little, but Cal still
rates the favorite spot over Stan
ford.

PERHAPS BRICK'S
FEAR IS MOUNTING

However, Brick must be getting
the old spasms, for fear that his pet
school's athletes are going to get
over-confident and consider the In
dians a cinch, so he has turned the
power of his pen to building up a
little psychology barrier to gum up
the Big Red Machine.
Either he's trying to deflate a
California's big-head complex, or
he's trying to inflate the Stanford
ego. One way or the other, he
ahont things, especially the meth
certainly has a coy way of going
ods lie uses in compiling dope
sheets and such.
He puts a few laughs in his col
umn, too. Get this one. "We think
George Anderson is perfectly O.K.
He can beat the Stanford sprinters
running backwards." He goes on to
say that he won't count on him yet,
though, because he hasn't proved
that his pulled muscle will hold up.
Come, come, Brick, George might
be good, and all that, but Hiserman,
Carew, Kneubuhl, Malott, and
Weiershauser could just about keep
up with him if he were running
backwards. At that, maybe you
meant, Brick, that he could beat the
Stanford sprinters if they were run
ning backwards. After all, your
statement is just ambiguous
enough to admit of such a possi
bility, too.
And as far as running hind-side
to is concerned, George probably
couldn't hold his own with Ray
Dean of the Olycpic Club. "Dizzy"
is pretty clever at traveling while
looking at where he's been, they
tell me.

WISE GUY,
EH?

To return to the dope-sheet that
Brick made out, it would be much
wii-vr of the perpetual frosh if he
would get his figures straight before
he starts making out such atroci
ties. If he reads this he probably
will be thinking, "Well, some smart
aleck kid with no more experience
than a jack-rabbit trying to tell me
about trauck, humph!"
There won't be any dope-sheets
presented in this column, though,
Brick, because it's kind of hard to
find out just what's going on at
the other schools unless you're
Ih ere ofarlhte ETAOIN ETAOIT
there for a while to sec perform
ances. You made out a very fine
dope-sheet, but while it might
take care of California it hardly
is correct as far as Stanford is
concerned, the way things stand
down here now.
Maybe you ought to come down
some day and see the boys work
out, .and maybe you ought to read
meet results to find out such things
as these. Burrows isn't running two
miles this season, and probably
won't. Kneubuhl is still running
behind Hiserman in both sprints,
and Ray Malott is the head man at

Alexander probably won't run the
mile in the Big Meet, but will stick
to the two-mile canter.

To return to the dope-sheet that
Brick made out, it would be much
wii-vr of the perpetual frosh if he
would get his figures straight before
he starts making out such atroci
ties. If he reads this he probably
will be thinking, "Well, some smart
aleck kid with no more experience
than a jack-rabbit trying to tell me
about trauck, humph!"
There won't be any dope-sheets

find out just what's going on at
the other schools unless you're
Ih ere ofarlhte ETAOIN ETAOIT

dope-sheet, but while it might
take care of California it hardly
is correct as far as Stanford is
concerned, the way things stand
down here now.

out, .and maybe you ought to read

Brick Morse, University of Cali
fornia's perennial freshman who
comes out every now and then and
once and a while in between with
a column in one of the San Fran
cisco papers, had his usual pre
pre-Big Meet fling at the track sit
uation yesterday morning.
Every year about a month or so in
advance of the Card-Bear meet
Brick gets in his first licks, and
more times than not his column is
an attempt to put the Bears in the
underdog position, if they're not al
ready >there.
Earlier in lite year there wasn't
a sports writer in the Bay Region
that would have given Stanford a
Ht-10-l chance (o take Brutus
Hamilton's team. Why, the Cal
oii( lit was the second-best college
dual meet track team in the coun
try, right behind U.S.C. Things
have changed a little, but Cal still
rates the favorite spot over Stan
ford.

PERHAPS BRICK'S
FEAR IS MOUNTING

However, Brick must be getting
the old spasms, for fear that his pet
school's athletes are going to get
over-confident and consider the In
dians a cinch, so he has turned the
power of his pen to building up a
little psychology barrier to gum up
the Big Red Machine.
Either he's trying to deflate a
California's big-head complex, or
he's trying to inflate the Stanford
ego. One way or the other, he
ahont things, especially the meth
certainly has a coy way of going
ods lie uses in compiling dope
sheets and such.
He puts a few laughs in his col
umn, too. Get this one. "We think
George Anderson is perfectly O.K.
He can beat the Stanford sprinters
running backwards." He goes on to
say that he won't count on him yet,
though, because he hasn't proved
that his pulled muscle will hold up.
Come, come, Brick, George might
be good, and all that, but Hiserman,
Carew, Kneubuhl, Malott, and
Weiershauser could just about keep
up with him if he were running
backwards. At that, maybe you
meant, Brick, that he could beat the
Stanford sprinters if they were run
ning backwards. After all, your
statement is just ambiguous
enough to admit of such a possi
bility, too.
