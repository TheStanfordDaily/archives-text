# Cards to Meet U. of A. in Last Polo Tilt Today
## Indian Players May Even Two-game Series With Strong Southern Squad 
### BOB GLIKBARG 
Card horsemen will get their last
chance to avenge themselves when 1
they meet the University of Arizona i
polo squad on the highway field at \
3 o'clock this afternoon. They were j
defeated 4-0 Tuesday in the first of
this present two-game series, and I
in the southern meet last fall the 1
second game was rained out before ;
they couLd do anything about a 4-3 ;
loss.
The University of Arizona team
rates well up in intercollegiate as J
well as other polo circles, having de- ;
feated most of the strong local teams |
in their district as well as some of
the best riding schools.
One of the mainstays of the south
ern squad is George Evans, high j
scorer completing his third year of ;
servipe. Another three-year man •
and perhaps the strongest defensive j
player on the roster is George Jud- ,
son.
Other men making the trip are ]
Boyd Branson, a steady player com- ,
pleting his first year on the varsity,
Gaynor Hathaway, a new man with |
strong potentialities, and Charles I
Mosse, another good prospect at
present getting experience as sub- i
stitute No. 3.
The Stanford line-up will remain
unchanged with Jim Fullerton at
No. 1, Rammy Rasmussen at No. 2,
Leon Lerby at No. 3, and Captain
Bob Fullerton at No. 4. Wallace,
who showed fine service in Tuesday's
game, probably will see service as
substitute No. 3.
