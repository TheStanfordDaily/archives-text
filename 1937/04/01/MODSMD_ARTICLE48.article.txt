# Gridmen Start Workouts Tiny Oils Big Red Machine
## 
### 
One hundred promising grid can
didates turned out for the first spring
practice session yesterday afternoon.
Coach Tiny Thornhill sent them
through a few warm-up drills, and
cameramen kept them busy going
through bicycle drills and leapfrog
games. After three months of rest
some of them could not even play a
good game of leapfrog.
The much-heard-of Jim Groves, a
transfer from San Mateo Junior Col
lege, appeared in uniform for the
first time as a Stanford gridder.
Jim is a large, long-legged, curly
headed answer to a Roble dream. In
sharp contrast to veteran Glenn
Hamilton, Groves throws a snow
flake ball with remarkable accuracy.
He may solve Tiny's fullback prob
lem.
Fullbacks are scarce now with

1 Calvelli shifted to center and the
possibility that Hamilton may be
moved to right half, leaving Jake
Brigham the only letterman in the
rear post. Tom Collins and Law
rence Bayer, both veterans, will be
! gunning for the job, and there are
, three good prospects from last sea
son's frosh squad, Howard Hicking
botham, Rod Parker, and Chet Pat
ton.
Elmer Sjostrum, brother of Bill
Sjostrum, fullback from the Greys,
' transferred this year from St. Mary's,
and tosses a good enough ball to
i make himself a promising fullback
! candidate.
Bill Paulman, who was out for the
i first time since he broke his ankle
a week before the first game last
season, whipped into shape at quar
! terback, but may see plenty of ac-
I tion at full.
