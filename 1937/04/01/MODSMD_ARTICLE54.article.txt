# Picking Up After Samson
## 
### 
WITH the clatter of broken plaster and roar
of falling beams, "Samson" Phil Brown
brought down the Old Assembly Hall last Big
Game Gaieties, finale as much to Stanford's
brown-stone theatrical barn as to the show.
For Stanford dramatics, they said, would
move into their new student-financed half
million-dollar home next April.
It is now next April, incidentally April Fool's
Day. Stanford Dramatics are not in their new
home. Instead the splintered boards of the old
stage have been smoothed down so students
can put on their Spring Show, "Lady Precious
Stream"â€”with death below them and some
body's dirty blanket above them.
And like the real Samson, Brown will go eye
less into an extra-University Gaza with his fel
low seniors on June 13 as far as the new theater
is concerned.
Neither he nor the rest of '37's 1000, prime
movers of the Theater project, will ever see a
production in the new house as students. And
it looks as if the Assembly Hall will rival Schu
mann-Heink for farewell performances.
The blame attaches to floods in the East,
strikes in the West, not to defections of the
University or the contractors.
Mother Nature simply refuses, with almost
human perversity, to ring up the curtain on the
new stage before June 20, just a week after the
seniors have moved into their service stations.
But one thing can be done so that all the wait
ing won't end in a thud of disappointment. The
University, with the co-operation of Senior Class
officers, might arrange for the cessation of work
for one day near the end of spring quarter
when all could take a look at the nearly com
pleted building.
Perhaps a commemorative program from the
stage would make it an "open-house" worthy
of the word.
How about it, gentlemen?
A "No Cigarette Bumming League" has
been formed on the campus ot Louisiana State
University. League members promise not to
bum or be bummed trom. Bumming ot
"drags" is permitted.
