# Let's Make It a Bang
## 
### 
BACK in the deep dark days of 1934, Stanford
last tried to light the fuse of its political fire
cracker with an A.S.S.U. nominating assembly.
But typical Stanfordites, knowing the typical
A.S.S.U. nominating assembly, chose to spend
their gift hour typically. They stayed away.
Eight hundred went to the assembly (per
haps more than it merited). Three thousand
didn't go. The fuse sputtered. Stanford's fire
cracker fizzled again.
This year Stanford's Public Exercises Com
mittee, still mired in disgust over their last
cracker's fizzle, has finally consented to again
let Ex Committee approach the oft-charred fuse.
They've decided that if the thing doesn't go off
this time they'll send it back to the factory as
a dud.
But Ex Committee has figured out why the
cracker won't light, and this time Stanford's
A.S.S.U. nominating assembly should be worth
the all-University hour-off it has been granted.
Ex Committee has decided to make the affair
less assembly and more show.
At the risk of a frown from those who see
everything that glitters as Hollywoodism, Ex
Committee will suggest that its nominating
assembly with perhaps a band, celebration for
the championship basketball team, singing by
men's and women's glee, plus nomination ad
dresses. Somebody will probably even pull the
lecturer's rostrum off the stage and it's said
they're planning to use the curtain before and
after the show —unheard-of actions for a Stan
ford assembly.
Ex Committee is determined to make this bit
(From the University ot Washington Daily)
went so far as to request that a popular dance

band be used twixt speeches till Stanford's staid
Public Exercises Committee said "no." Such
form of entertainment, it seems, is not "fitting."
But despite this lack of administrative co
operation, Stanford will go ahead with its fuse
lighting next Thursday, 10 o'clock, to prove to
its wet-powdered officials that it can turn a
fizzle into a bang.—G. F.
the concrete road to social smoothness is
being ottered in weekly lessons at the Uni
versity of Minnesota.
