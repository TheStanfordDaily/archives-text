plaint if a new invention, exhibited at the last
meeting of the National Education Association,
is accepted by American universities.
The machine is a mechanical grader. Stu
dents taking objective tests punch holes in their
test papers to denote false when the test paper
is put in the machine, electric contacts are
made through the punches, and the number of
mistakes registers automatically.
While strictly impartial and extremely fast,
the grader sounds a sour note in education. It

technique to a new high. The next step would
be phonograph recordings of lectures (some of
them are almost that already) and a mimeo
graphed pamphlet entitled, "What Every Col
lege Graduate Should Think."
On the other hand, professors, freed from
having to worry about reading papers, might
be able to devote more time to study and work.
