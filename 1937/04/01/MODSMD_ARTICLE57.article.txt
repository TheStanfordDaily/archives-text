Distilled education for American youth at the Heif
ered of the West was graphically portrayed last finals
time under the shadow of Bull Session and the Polit
ical Science Department. Enterprising young grad
uates in Poly Sci give a three-hour seminar before
the final in Poly Sci I, in which the course is com
pressed and consolidated. This forms a double benefit
in that it enables the students to take their final with
all coolers flying, and also enables the young grad
uates to support their families.
The first benefit seemed more important to two
Toros and Stanford's Most Famous Breaker, however,
so they entered into a conspiracy in restraint of trade
and pooled their resources, paying the way of one El
Toro to the seminar, and then waited around until
it was over, at which time the Toro returned and dis
tilled, compressed and consolidated the seminar for
the waiting cronies. Everybody did just fine in the
final next day.
It looks as if this business of hashers publishing
books is getting out of hand. Aubrey, 'leven sun of a
'leven sun of Merry Old England, who has been fur
nished on the 50-cent Cellar dinner or Salisbury
steak, or dog biscuits au gratin, or return, for the
past year is coming out with "America as I Found
It." It's lucky he's going back to England now, a couple
more Cellar efficiency expert lunches, and he would
have lost it again.
