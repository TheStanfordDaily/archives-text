# BULL SESSION
## HOBOES, MICE, AND MEN 
### 
IJEFORE the five days' trial period was up and wc
had to send cither the money or the book back to
the Book of the Monlh Club, some of us guys read
Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
The story revolves around a childishly imbccilic
Hercules with the heart of a puppy, and opinion con
curs that the tale builds tremendously to a placc
little past the point of a short story climax, then off
softly to a violent ending that is less tragic than it
is pitifully inevitable.
* # * *
Because the central characters are agricultural
tramps it brings to mind Jim Tully and John Dos
Passos. Dos Passos, though, seems more interested in
fooling around with words than he is in mucking
around with lowbrowism. Tully is the man I'm getting
at.
His rendition of the dying hobo saga in the last
Esquire may have done a service to literature by re
cording an epical fragment but it is a hackneyed
jingle that practically everybody knows, and I can't
help thinking that the trouble with Tully is that he
is making a fetish of hoboism. Despite what rotting
in the jungles he may have done, for a long time now
he has been acting the proletarian poseur until the
guise has gone stale.
* * * *
His case is a horrible example of what can go
cockeyed with proletarian literature. Stcinbcck ranks
on the other side to show what a sincere and simple
approach can produce out of the same scene that men
like Tully, and maybe Dos Passos, cut into with flam
buoyant self-consciousness.
It has been suggested that the real proletarian novel
comes out of the western story and ranch romances
and adventure story pulp magazines. So, then, does
anybody else get the impression that I do, that the
alleged literature of the masses is written by high
brows or people with the high-brow attitude? That
they dip in the rubble of a dump heap or the dingi
ness of a railroad yard and come up putting a ro
mantically glorified halo on the scene in a way that
smacks of being artistic flimflammery?
What the pseudo-lowbrow literature seems to need
is a person with the honesty of an eastern college man
who once told me about loading scrap iron onto a
freight car in Indiana on a dreary Christmas day. He
confessed that it was no fun at. all doing it, but he said
that the tale repeated to the people back home was
certainly great stuff to drag the Ohs and Ahs out of
the little "ills :il the Thptfl house.

who once told me about loading scrap iron onto a
freight car in Indiana on a dreary Christmas day. He
confessed that it was no fun at. all doing it, but he said
that the tale repeated to the people back home was
certainly great stuff to drag the Ohs and Ahs out of
the little "ills :il the Thptfl house.

IJEFORE the five days' trial period was up and wc
had to send cither the money or the book back to
the Book of the Monlh Club, some of us guys read
Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men."
The story revolves around a childishly imbccilic
Hercules with the heart of a puppy, and opinion con
curs that the tale builds tremendously to a placc
little past the point of a short story climax, then off
softly to a violent ending that is less tragic than it
is pitifully inevitable.

Because the central characters are agricultural
tramps it brings to mind Jim Tully and John Dos
Passos. Dos Passos, though, seems more interested in
fooling around with words than he is in mucking
around with lowbrowism. Tully is the man I'm getting
at.
His rendition of the dying hobo saga in the last
Esquire may have done a service to literature by re
cording an epical fragment but it is a hackneyed
jingle that practically everybody knows, and I can't
help thinking that the trouble with Tully is that he
is making a fetish of hoboism. Despite what rotting
in the jungles he may have done, for a long time now
he has been acting the proletarian poseur until the
guise has gone stale.
* * * *
His case is a horrible example of what can go
cockeyed with proletarian literature. Stcinbcck ranks
on the other side to show what a sincere and simple
approach can produce out of the same scene that men
like Tully, and maybe Dos Passos, cut into with flam
buoyant self-consciousness.
It has been suggested that the real proletarian novel
comes out of the western story and ranch romances
and adventure story pulp magazines. So, then, does
anybody else get the impression that I do, that the
alleged literature of the masses is written by high
brows or people with the high-brow attitude? That
they dip in the rubble of a dump heap or the dingi
ness of a railroad yard and come up putting a ro
mantically glorified halo on the scene in a way that
smacks of being artistic flimflammery?
What the pseudo-lowbrow literature seems to need
is a person with the honesty of an eastern college man
who once told me about loading scrap iron onto a
freight car in Indiana on a dreary Christmas day. He
confessed that it was no fun at. all doing it, but he said
that the tale repeated to the people back home was
certainly great stuff to drag the Ohs and Ahs out of
