"You Only Live Once" (United
Artists) needs only a pair of scis
sors used on it to make it close to
top-notch melodrama. Given force
ful and simple lines, Sylvia Sidney
and Henry Fonda do some re
strained acting that gives conviction
to a rather involved story. Supe
rior photography, effective staging,
and a good supporting cast combine
to make this a story which may de
press you, but which you will
probably remember as one play that
didn't get the usual Hollywood
ending tacked on to it. Even the
last few feet of phantasy in which
flicker moguls let you know that
they were only kidding won't bother
you too much. All in all, it is some
thing which evidently turned out
better than they expected; it gets
top billing for this program.
"Head Over Heels in Love" (Gau
mont-British) is a disappointment
all around; even Jessie Mathews'
lovely figure doesn't give this half
baked affair a lift, principally be
cause it doesn't get top billing (see
above.) The music is good (Gordon
and Ravel), the dancing mediocre,
and the lines and acting practically
inarticulate. She's gotten to "giv
ing her all" with every song you
get a little tired after the first few
times of going through the old rou
tine with her. She and Sonnie Hale
(who directed this time) can do a
whole lot better.
