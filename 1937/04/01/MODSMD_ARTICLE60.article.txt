# CAMPUS OPINION
## ALL STREAMED UP 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Why this argument about the plays
Gordon Lange elects to produce?
The "Variety standard" is all right
for Broadway, but not for a college
campus; where more than the box
office should be considered in choos
ing a play.
Yet the box office backs Lange, too,
for his first two productions are the
first to make money here in many,
many years.
"Roadside" and "This Side Idol
atry" may have been weak as plays
(I don't concede the point, except
for argument's sake), but they were
damn good entertainment, and no
one denies that. The box office
proved it; the audience's applause
confirmed it.
I don't know a thing about "Lady
Precious Stream" except what I read
in Time and Variety. I don't know
whether, in staging it, Lange will
have his actors play straight, as in
"Idolatry," or mugg it, as in "Road
side," but either way, I think from
his past performances he'll give us
good entertainment.
Let the man try!
