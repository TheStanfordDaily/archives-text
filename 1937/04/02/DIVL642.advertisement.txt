PIZAZZ is the new
fashion word (and Connie
thinks it's a pip) for any
thing and everything
loaded with dynamic chic.
Harpooned from the Har
vard Lampoon, and harped
on by Harper's Bazaar,
Connie shows you here
with, the PIZZAZ or the
"it" that puts the sparkle
in these costume hits. t
Daisies have Pizazz!
Pick a buncli of daisies, any
number from one to four, and
you've cultivated a flower
that's spring's fashion of the
hour. But to put the
PIZAZZ in a daisy and in.
your costume as well, wear
a single one on each side ot
your tailored suit lapel.
Colored patent petals against
starchy white pique, with
fuzzy-wuzzy centers to make
them twice as gay. Per;

To Heighten Daisy Pizazz,
A daisy linen hankie,
sprightly pocketed up
rightly. Hand-rolled, 50u
Doubly Pizazz
Giant chiffon kerchiefs liavo
m ore PIZAZZ than you'd
suspect when you use your
color sense in paint-pot
tones that artists get. Con
nie's eyes lit up like candles
when she spied one in dusty
blue, allied with another iu
deep, red wine with the
utmost fashion a-do. You
wear them as a scarf with
knitted frocks, bright or
dark. Cross the kerchiefs in
the middle and twine them
'round your curls, fit as a
fiddle. But there's still an
other guise, for these ker
chiefs, giant-size. Stick a dif
ferent color in two suit
pockets "up" and "down,"
thereby doubling the PIZAZZ
of both the suit and kerchief
for town. Many colors. Hand
rolled and with hand drawn
threads. 1.01) each
Pizazz, butfon-holed
Here's a bit of PIZAZZ,
mighty chesty, Connie found
button-holed on a vestee.
Three pearly buttons make
a "personal" appearance,
with your initials clamped
on top where they fit into a
slot. White pique with a pie
crust frill . . . faggoting and
stitchery for an added thrill.

letter buttons. Pretty as a
picture . . . with spring
tailored suits, quite sumpin'.
