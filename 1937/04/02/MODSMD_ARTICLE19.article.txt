# Beetles to Take Part In Carnival April 10
## 
### 
A drove of multi-colored beetles
swarmed across the Sophomore Car
nival horizon late yesterday, and
threatened to add further complica
tions to the already baffling prob
lem of how to raise the maximum
amount of funds for the Convales
cent Home's ailing kiddies. At the
same time the problem of how to
provide student novelty seekers
with the greatest degree of enter
tainment a week from Saturday was
in need of a solution.
The bug difficulty arose when
Delta Tau Delta announced that
their concession will feature a mul
titude of green, white, and red
beetles crawling around a table try
ing to avoid being trapped by a
swooping paper cup, which will
descend upon them from above, im
prisoning them one by one. The
cup will be manipulated by means of
levers which will be worked from
the edge of the circular table.
Red Beetle Wins
A premium will be attached to the
catching of a red beetle as there will
be only one in the entire insect

! horde. The grand prize goes to the ,
[ skillful hunter who can clamp down |
' on the racing red bug.
Visitors to the Phi Sigma Kappa
I booth will compete in a penny-toss.
Tin cups will be floating about in a
I pan of water as targets for the cop
pers.
Several women's halls have
| planned booths which have not yet
i been approved, according to Caro
lyn Hibbard, chairman of women's
| halls concessions.

omore women will invade fraterni
j ties and eating clubs at. meals next
! week to present a preview of the
