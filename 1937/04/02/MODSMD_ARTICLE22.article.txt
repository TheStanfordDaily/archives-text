## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 1 (UP).â€”Fail
ure of Appalachian soft coal mine '
operators and the United Mine j
Workers to sign a new contract caus- j
ed 400,000 miners in a dozen states j
to leave their jobs today.
A leading figure among the op- |
erators negotiating with the union
said an agreement might be con- |
eluded in time to permit the miners j
to resume work tomorrow.
The old contract expired at mid- j
night, making stoppage of work au
tomatic until new terms on wages !
and hours are reached. The com- I
mittee of 16, composed of union men j
and operators, recessed half an hour |
before the deadline and resumed ;
the conference this afternoon.
Union miners would not have ;
worked today anyway as they ob- j
serve April 1 as "John L. Lewis j
Day," but the walkout was in force ;
as soon as the old contract expired, j
Meanwhile the conferees hoped a j
new contract would be agreed upon
soon, as the question of higher
was said to be the only rc- i
maining difference. Mr. Lewis, >
U.M.W. president, said, "No con- 1
tract, no work."
