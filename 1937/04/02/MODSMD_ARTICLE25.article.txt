# Morris Talks At Opening Of A.S.M.E.
## Speech Tells of Federal Power, Dam Projects In Pacific Northwest 
### 
Addressing the opening banquet
of the third annual conference of
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, southwestern branch,
Dean S. B. Morris, of the Stanford
School of Engineering, spoke on the
"Power Development in the Pacific
Northwest" in the Women's Club
house last night.
After a short welcoming address
by Dr. Kay Lyman Wilbur, Profes
sor Morris described power devel
opments in Oregon, Washington,
and parts of Canada, accompanying
his address with lantern slides.
Describes Projects
Although construction is already
started at the Bonneville, Grand
Coulee, and Rockville dams, plans
for the distribution of power to re
gional industries are yet incomplete,
said Professor Morris. The Colum
bia River, scene of most govern
mental projects, will contain ten
dams from the Bonneville, near the
Pacific Coast, to the Grand Coulee,
which will back water up to the
Canadian border.
Power Doubled
At the same time, power plants
are being developed on the Skad
gett River, supplying energy to Se
attle. Dean Morris pointed out that
these, however, are for the most
part being carried on without fed
eral assistance. Total power of all
projects will more than double the
amount at present furnished by pri
vate plants in the Northwest, a dis
trict which already puts out about
50 per cent of the total power in the
United States, he concluded.
The program of the meeting's first
day ended with a high voltage dem
onstration at the Ryan laboratory,
conducted by Dr. J. S. Carroll. To
morrow's schedule will include sev
eral technical lectures in the Little
Theater, field trips to San Francisco
industrial plants, and a banquet at
which Dr. William F. Durand, pro
fessor emeritus at Stanford, will
speak on "The Engineer and So
ciety."
