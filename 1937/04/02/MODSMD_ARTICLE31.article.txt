# Stanford Is Cosmopolitan 746 Schools Represented
## 
### 
From the Hoogele Burgerschule
in Holland, from the Quilmes in Ar
gentina, from 46 states, 12 foreign
countries, three United States pos
sessions and the Canal Zone the
student body of Stanford was re
cruited in the years from 1933 to
1936, as shown by the President's
Report, recently issued.
Seven hundred and forty-six in
stiutions are represented, compris
ing every university, college, junior
college, private sehool, public school
and preparatory school from which
any student has been received at
Stanford. South Dakota and North
Carolina are the only states not
having representatives.
No School Outstanding
Figures given in the report indi
cating the quality of the records
that students made here do not show
an A average for any university or
college but the students from two
high schools, Deerfield-Shield high
school in Highland Park, Illinois,
and North Central high school in
Washington made 4.00 averages or
straight A.
Among the universities and col
leges. Oregon's Linfield College stu
dents made the highest average,
3.76; whereas the average of those
from Yale was 3.13 and Harvard
2.71. But a factor which might have
contributed to these results may be
the fact that Yale had twice as many
students here as Linfield, and Har
vard three times as many. The av
erage given in each case is a col
lective average.
Small Colleges Best
Smaller colleges which had fewer
students represented show better
averages for those students than the
larger colleges or universities. Trin
ity College in Connecticut, Swarth
more in Pennsylvania, Williams Col
lege in Massachusetts, Oberlin Col
lege in Ohioâ€”all sent students who
made better grades than those from
any state university.
Foreigners Compared
Of the students from foreign
schools, the representation from the
Staatliches Gymnasium had the
highest grade-point average, with

Victoria College in Canada running
second. But while each of these
sent one student, the University of
Paris had three here who atained
less than a B average by .56.
Advanced institutions of China
and Japan did not enter any stu
dents, but two came from the
Shanghai American School and one
each from the Iwakumi high school
and the Tokyo American school in
Japan.
