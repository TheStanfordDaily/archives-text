# Smoking Leads Luxury Costs
## Candy, Gum Rank Second In Student Popularity 
### 
Sixty-five per cent of the luxuries
I students buy on the campus, valued
I at $20,000 in trade each quarter, are |
| cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco. Of j
i the total luxuries, the central Union !
cigar store furnishes 65 per cent.
The remainder is supplied by the
! store in Encina basement, and by the
i two student-managed stores in La
; gunita and Roble. Most-smoked cig
j arette is the Camel.
Candy, Gum Next
Candy and gum rank next on the
I list, although their position is not
! as strong as the girls' dormitories as
| at the other two supply stations.
Headache allayers, tooth pastes,
and cough drops come third under
the title of drugs. Aspirin, Anacin,
ctc., seem most popylar toward the \
; end of each quarter.
Not Many Magazines
i Far down the list, partly because '
j there is litle offered for sale ex- i
cept at the Union, come periodicals
' of all sorts. The weekly magazines
of the five-cent variety are most
popular, but Time is close behind
i them. Life, too, sells rapidly. The .j
supply has not yet equaled the de
mand.
