# Smoking Leads Luxury Costs
## Candy, Gum Rank Second In Student Popularity 
### 
Sixty-five per cent of the luxuries
students buy on the campus, valued
at $20,000 in trade each quarter, are
cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco. Of
the total luxuries, the central Union
cigar store furnishes 65 per cent.
The remainder is supplied by the
store in Encina basement, and by the
i two student-managed stores in La
; gunita and Roble. Most-smoked cig
arette is the Camel.
Candy, Gum Next
Candy and gum rank next on the
list, although their position is not
as strong at the girls' dormitories as
at the other two supply stations.
Headache allayers, tooth pastes,
and cough drops come third under
the title of drugs. Aspirin, Anacin,
etc., seem most popylar toward the
end of each quarter.
Not Many Magazines
Far down the list, partly because
there is little offered for sale ex-
cept at the Union, come periodicals
of all sorts. The weekly magazines
of the five-cent variety are most
popular, but Time is close behind
them. Life, too, sells rapidly. The
supply has not yet equaled the de
mand.
