# Solon Finds Election Fever At Low Ebb
## 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM, JR 
As all-important spring elections j
| loom on a dusty horizon, Stanford's [
| once most politically minded group, !
El Toro, spends its time blackballing i
politicians and wishing that crafty I
politico, Marvie Kahn, was around \
to manage the campaigns of Toro's
favorite sons.
Toro's apathy is typical of the i
J whole student body, as rumors are !
at a premium and definite tips prac
tically non-existent. Most promi- ;
nent candidate in the presidential
race is Phi Delt Bob Mc√üoskey. Pos- ;
| sible opponents are Zete Tommy ,
Killefer, Deke Hank Luisetti, Delta
1 Chi Wayne Richardson, and Toro 1
; "Spooky Joe" Calderwood. The lat- I
I ter's candidacy is doubtful. General \
! hall opinion is that no one will run, j
but then they said that last year. j
Vice-presidential candidates are '
I less numerous, but still hard to
guess. Wong's kitch seems to favor |
D.G.'s Jackie Brown, and Lagunita's |
| Isabel Goldthwaite. Other possi- \
| bilities are "Sis" Coonley, Tri Delt; i
; Dulce Parker, Theta; and Maxine ;
! Moore, Lagunita.
Hall and Row caucuses are not yet '
organized but will probably be
planned for the beginning of next
week. Organized competition will
probably meet these cauci in the
form of a committee of senior women
chosen from Women's Conference.
It is planned that this group will
make all nominations for women's .
i offices. i
