tincing has still to be worked out.
I)ain of Earth Construction
Hie dam will be of earth construc
n, 100 feet high and 1300 feet long,
d will contain 350,000 cubic yards
rolled earth fill. Cortemadera
d Bear Gulch creek, which drain
a5-mile area, join to form San
pneisquito Creek north of the
mpus. All of this water which
kv drains into the Bay will be
nilable for irrigation.
Domestic water supply is provided
r by a scheme to build a pipe line
; Hetch-Hetchy water from Red
>od City to Mayfield. This has
en made possible by the City of
in Francisco's reduction of rates to
cents per 100 cubic feet for neigh
ring communities.
Peninsula to Finance Plan
The project will probably be
lanced jointly by San Francisco
id the Peninsula towns on the line,
ith government aid through the
*VA. The Board of Trustees of the
niversity have authorized the
pmptroller's office to contribute
0,000. Palo Alto will pay $60,000
id Menlo, Atherton, and other corn
unities will make up the rest of
e fund.
This new line will be chiefly used
r the drinking water supply. It
ill have no effect on the construc
:>n of the dam because eventually
fcry available source of water will
ave to be used if (he campus hold
igs are to be developed.
