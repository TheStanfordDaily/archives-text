# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHERE DO WE STAND? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Although the blasts of anonymous
cranks in the Campus Opinion col
umn can be dismissed without seri
ous thought, v/hen those same ideas
appear in your editorial column over
the signatuxe of as intelligent a man
as Dave Botsford it is time to de
cide just where we stand.
If there is not an audience for in
telligent plays on a college campus,
where is that audience to be found?
If a college audience is not only sat
isfied with but actually demands the
same entertainment as New York's
millions, what hope is there for the
advancement of American drama?
Even though the campus does prefer
the twelve-year-old entertainment
level of the movies or the fourteen
year-old level of Broadway suc
cesses, they have little room for com
plaint if they are asked to see just
one play of better grade each quar
ter, while the movies are showing
every night and the Community
Theater offers an average of one
Broadway success per month.
If, however, the Daily is con
vinced that Dramatic Council should
limit itself to the reproducing of
plays which have pleased a New
York audience, it is a little late and
worse than useless to express that
opinion after the play for the quar
ter is already selected. The Daily
has a representative on the Council
and has as good a chance as any
one else to choose a play. If the
Daily wants to do "Abie's Irish
Rose," which pleased New York for
years on end, it should say so while
the choice of play is still under con
sideration.
Unlike some of the opposition, I
have read the play, and anyone who
has the imagination to translate the
action mentally from the printed
page to the stage cannot fail to sec

that '"Lady Precious Stream" is not
only a very interesting novelty but
also a highly amusing evening of
entertainment. However, I do not
care to argue the point; I am willing
to leave the verdict with the first
night audience.
