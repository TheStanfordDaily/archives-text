# POLOIST PIPES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In today's Bull Session, your Mr.
Tro Harper has listed "100 Polo
(Grubbs)" as a pipe. If Mr. Harper
thinks playing polo is such a "pipe"
it is strange that he does not take
the time to find out that the men
| who earn a unit playing polo, really
work for it.
Upper class men can earn uniis by
I participating in any sport. Why then
I has* Mr. Harper puinted to polo as a
f "pipe"?
—A Polo Enthusiast
P.S. —If Mr. Harper will drop
| down and ask Captain Grubbs, I am
J sure the Captain will allow him to
I find out first hand if polo is a pipe.
