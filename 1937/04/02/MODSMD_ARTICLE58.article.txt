# Ice Hockey Teams Clash in Last Game
## 
### 
The Detroit Red Wings and Les
Canadiens clash in the fifth and
deciding game for the National
Hockey League championship at
Montreal tonight. The victor will
advance to the finals for the prized
Stanley Cup, meeting the winner of
the Ranger-Maroon best two out of
three series which begins in New
York tonight.
Les Canadiens, underdogs at the
start of the first-place playoff, are
nearly even money to defeat the
Wings due to the loss of the star
Detroit goalie, Norman Smith.
