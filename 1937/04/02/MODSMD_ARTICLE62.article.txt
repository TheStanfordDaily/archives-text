# Stanford, O.C. Track Champs Clash Here Tomorrow
## Winged-O Highly Favored; Bright, Dunn Lead Club Low Quarter-mile Furnish Closest Competition 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Given the Grace of God and the elements, loi-aJ (rack enthusiasts will
be treated to the best show of the Angell Field season tomorrow after
noon when Dink Templeton's Stanford varsity tangles with the Olympic
Club cinderinen. The javelin will .start at 1:45 o'clock, the mile run
promptly at 2:00.
Light sprinkles of rain yesterday served only to mar Templeton's final
practice sessions and soften the track slightly. The runways and pits all

have been drained and covered, and
with the underpinning of the cin
derpath in a good dry condition, it
will take a heavy rain shortly be
fore the first gun to soupify Angell
Field sufficiently to cause cancella
tion of the meet.
O.C. Favored
Charley Hunter's clubmen, if he
can gather them all together and
get them into suits tomorrow, will
be strongly favored over Stanford to
take team honors, handicapping off
the club's performance two weeks
ago when they defeated California
handily, and with strong first place
material.
Last year the Olympic Club meet
was rained out, so what revenge in
centive is up tomorrow will come
from old college rivalries between
the team members as most of the
Club's team is formed of former
Stanford, California, and other const
college stars.
Bright Runs Mile
Ray Dean will handle the sprints
for the club, and is favored over
Hisemian, Carew, Kneubuhl, and
Malott of Stanford. The quarter
should be closer, as Hunter's man
A1 Fitch has not reached his col
legiate competitive shape, and Cap
tain Bill McCurdy and Ray Malott
of Stanford are running fast times.
Stanford, too, may draw points in
the half, as McCurdy and Carl Ma
hurin have run times to compare
with the Club's Elroy Robinson,
who may be hampered by having
to double in the mile. Norm Bright
(OC) should win the mile handily,
although Ed Burrows has been im
proving by great strides during the
last two weeks and may break 4:30
tomorrow. The two-mile will see
Bright, one of the nation's best at
the distance, competing against Bob
Alexander, John Beman, and John
Dern of Stanford.
Hurdles Close
Close to predict are the hurdles,
with Tom Moore of the Olympic
Club just a little better than Haw
kins and Hewitt of Stanford, but
with Jack Weiershauser and Del
Fishback a perfect standoff as two
of the finest in the country so far
at the 220-yard lows. This should
yield the performance of the day,
given, of course, the smooth track.
In the field again Hunter's men
show powerful strength. Slinger
Dunn can easily take both weight
events if he is anywhere near as
good as he has been but 'Mont
gomery, Hershey, and Zagar may
take a lot of show and place money.
The javelin presents Johnny "220-
foot" Mot tram as a cinch against
Walker and Shaw of Stanford.
Marty, Morrison Meet
Walter Marty, former world's rec
ord holder, will compete for the
club in the high jump against Stan
ford's best, Ick Morrison. Bob
Clark is good for 24 feet nearly any
day in the week in the broad jump,
while Leo Madlem has done but lit
tle over 23 this year and Jack Mau
ger is a good 6 inches above Boore
and Gill of Stanford in the pole
vault.
So you see, it's one-sided. But
not terribly so, and in spite of the
fact that few give Stanford a chance
at the points, there is no argument
about the fact that it'll be as fine a
show as Angell Field will see this
yenrâ€”if it doesn't rain.
