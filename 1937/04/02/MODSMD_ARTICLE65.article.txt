IT'S LIKE A SPORTS
VEGETABLE WACiON

They're going to have a swimming
meet today, the varsity swimmers,
they are, and if you are willing to
believe every indication the meet
[should be a whoopdewozzaller.
U.S.C. is bringing up another one
'of those tank squads that has a
j strong rep and plenty to back it up,
and it would be just about right
with them if they could sneak over
a fast one on this* one of Nort
Thornton's strongest-ever varsities.
The Trojans have lost their share
of meets this year, while the In
j dians have still to lose to a collegiate
j team or otherwise, but funny though
jit may sound, those defeats don't
i have a terrific amount to do with
! the situation this afternoon. While
I the Cards still rate the edge in the
| meet, since they have a better rec
iord and they are at home, they
| won't have any pushover in the
southern squad.
The score should be close enough
that if any one of Thornton's men
should falter, it might mean the
meet. Drop around to the pools this
afternoon, it'll be worth watching.

KEEP READING,
YOU'LL SEE

If you don't like to watch swim
ming meets — there's another here
tomorrow against Occidental, in
case you do—you might take a slant
at the tennis players when they meet
U.S.C. today on the varsity courts.
That is. you might watch them if it
doesn't rain, becau-e then they will
play at the Palace of Fine Arts in
San Francisco.
And then Stanford meets the
Olympic Club in track, tomorrow,
as another attraction.
This is all getting very involved,
but we can't let the thing go only
half-done. If you think swimming
is pure foolishness, or track meets
tire you, or tennis gripes you, there
is still a chance to get a little mental
athletic stimulation by idling over
to the Sunken Diamond and taking
in the baseball game.
Southern Cal is also taking on
the Indians in baseball, which must
mean that about a quarter of the
Trojan student body is up in this
neck of the woods, what with the
swimmers and the tennis players
and the pastimers all traveling at
once.
That, with the exception of fresh
man baseball games this afternoon
and tomorrow morning, freshman
swimming meets directly after both
Varsity meets, and a frosh track meet
tomorrow morning on An§ell Field,
is all there is doing around here this
week-end.
And if you can't find something
you like to watch in all that, maybe
you had just better stay home and
listen to the radio, and wait till
football season rolls around again,
or something.

SURE, THEY CAN
HAVE THE MEET

Now, that track meet tomorrow is
one of those funny things wherein
one team goes into the fray with
the knowledge that it hasn't a
chance, but is perfectly happy about
it. The competition for Dink's men,
when you come right down to it,
will be to see how well they can do
against the Club in comparison to
the showing made by Cal against the
Post Street boys a week ago.
It's a cinch that the Cards can't
beat the Club, because the Club is
probably the best dual meet team in
the country, bar nobody. They have
a collection of the best college stars
from all over the Coast, while any

individual college team has only a
few such stars and more of the
place and show men.
Nevertheless, such a condition
doesn't bother anybody in particu
lar, because the meet resolves itself
into a group of individual event
competitions, rather than a team
struggle. If the Indians do a little
better against Charley Hunter's
tea mthan California did last week,
it certainly is going J.o give a lot of
Bear backers ants in their pants,
isn't it?
