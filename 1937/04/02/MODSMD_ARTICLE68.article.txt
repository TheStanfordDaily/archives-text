# Card Netmen Clash With USC Tomorrow
## 
### 
Farm spectators will see cham
pionship tennis played here when
U.S.C. brings its net team to the
Stanford courts tomorrow.
No tariff is being charged for the
matches, which will be played on
the varsity courts, starting at 1:15.
Braly, Seward, and Underwood will
battle Mako, Knemeyer, and With
erall in the first three singles con
tests. Immediately following this,
Dey, Lynch, and Pommer take the
courts against Hansen, Nelson, and
Hall in that order.
Action for the doubles teams
comes as soon as the singles matches
have been played. Underwood and
Pommer of the Farm are matched
against the fast-playing Southland
boys, Mako and Hall, in the first
doubles contest. Stanford's Seward-
Dey combination —the combination
that won the National Intercolle
giate title in IS36—play Knemeyer
and Witherall. Braly, teamed with
either Lynch or Chessman, bat the
balls against Hansen and Nelson.
Stanford was defeated by U.S.C.
8-1 in their first match, but Coach
Lockwood expects this decision to be
reversed when his proteges meet the
Trojans Saturday. His optimism,
which is echoed by the team, is not

I damped by the fact that U.S.C. is
; considered to have the strongest
| team on the Coast.
At the same time that the varsity
i matches are being played, the frosh
i squad will play Modesto J.C. on the
i far courts.
