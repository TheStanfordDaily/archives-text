# Farm Mermen Meet Trojans At 3:00 Today
## Thornton's Men Favorites To Break Three-year Championship Record 
### GENE GEAR 
Big Chief Nort Thornton and his
1 band of aquatic warriors will lie in
I wait this, afternoon at 3 o'clock
; around the ol' Indian water hole.
They're planning a little reception
for Ihe mighty Trojans, who have
pushed their wooden horse from
the southland to the Indian camp
grounds.
Nort's streamlined shvages have
I an idea that Troy's wooden horse
has ruled confercnce swim circles
just three years too long and are out
to prove that the old marc isn't as
seaworthy as in the past.
Cards Win 17 Times
Stanford had been perched on top
of the Pacific Coast conference,
southern division, for 17 years. In
1934 U.S.C. took over the reigns and
, has held them since.
Stanford's natators will enter the
meet as slight favorites to repulse
the southern invaders. The Trojans
are bringing three conference
champs and two coast record hold
i ers into the fray in Encina Pools
: this afternoon.
The defending champs' weakness
es lie in the diving and breaststroke
| events and in the fact that they are
not supposed to be blessed with sec
ond and third place possibilities.
Two Feature Races
Coach Thornton looks for two
headline races on an all-star pro
gramâ€”the 440-yard free-style and
the 50-yard dash. The quarter mile
will bring together Dave Rider and
Winfield Needham of the Cards and
Bob Boales of the Trojans. This
v/ill be Rider's first home start since
his second place in the A.A.U. 1500-
meters in Minnesota last week,
j Needharn and Rider have won two
quarter-mile struggles apiece this
year, so it should be a great grudge
j battle with Boales, one of the best
| on the coast, in there to make things

more interesting.
In the 50-yard dash, Dick Clarke,
Stanford's sensational sophomore
sprint star who cracked the pool
and university records this year,
will match strokes with Roger
Hatch, Troy's conference champ.
Word has drifted in from the
south that the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
eked out a win over U.S.C., 39-38.
The Cards walloped the Bruins last
month, 51-23.
Stanford's varsity meets Occi
dental College tomorrow afternoon
in Encina Pools at 2 o'clock.
If one part of the human brain is
destroyed, another part can take up ,
its functions almost perfectly. J
