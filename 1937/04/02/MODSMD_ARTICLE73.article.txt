FIRST Stanford step down a long, long road '
was taken by Jim Reynolds' brand-new stu- j
dent-faculty relations committee early this week
when that "just another committee" turned out j
to be more than "iust another committee" and j
tackled the problem of presenting a course on j
the study of social diseases.
Thus comes first hope that the oft-suppressed j
subject of venereal disease shall receive frank |
and intelligent treatment at Stanford.
It's not purely for local significance that we
herald this step, but rather because in such a ;
move Stanford joins a nation-wide march to
combat venereal diseases, a campaign put in
motion early in January by President Roose
velt's announced support of the program.
When 600 of the country's outstanding doc- j
tors and social hygienists were assembled by 1
Surgeon General Thomas Parran to outline a ;
huge venereal-disease campaign, the parade ;
gathered force. National magazines have joined, 1
conservative newspapers, long holders of the
word "syphilis" in taboo, broke precedent and
put it in headlines. The movement took hold.
At Surgeon Parran's meeting it was agreed
that the first step toward the eradication of
venereal disease must come m the form of
enlightenment regarding such disease. Exist
ing taboos regarding treatment and prevention !
must be broken down. Truth must be taught.
The Daily has previously advocated a course |
in sex education, and similarly here it feels
that false prejudice should be pushed aside
for the straightforward approach.
Stanford University, a great cultural institu
tion in the West, has its responsibility in the
national march. Its President, high in the medi
cal world, walks with the leaders. Stanford
itself can gain much by offering hearty sup
port.—G. F.
