WHEN Stanford breaks with the past on or
about June 19 and sends its hoary Assem
bly Hall into Ihe land of the trolley and plug
ugly, the venerable old Tuesday lecture may
go along.
Essentially, the lecture idea was a good one.
Students should be interested in a weekly dish
from some good speaker. Perhaps they are.
Perhaps the reason that Tuesday evening
lectures have lately been attended by a hand
ful of guasi-interested Palo Altans and even
fewer Stanfordites, lies not with the idea but
with its presentation.
The Public Exercises Committee, which doles
out Stanford's money for lecturers, has shown
slight evidences of showmanship in its choices.
Maybe it has been the result of a failure to find
the medium line between entertainment and
education. Maybe it has been due to confusion
as to which side of that line those lectures
should fall.
At any rate, Stanford's Tuesday meals lack
seasoning, have proven dull, unpalatable to
the student taste. After fifteen hours of lec
tures weekly, the average student wants small
quantities of sugar with his evening meal.
With the ascension into its new plush-covered
playhouse, Stanford should do one of two things
with its outmoded Tuesday evening lecture:
(1) Leave it to tumble with the timber and plas
ter of the Assembly Hall; (2) Re-season it and
serve it as a light, semi-cultural bit to an au
dience that hungers for educational entertain
ment that carries a sparkle.—G. F.
