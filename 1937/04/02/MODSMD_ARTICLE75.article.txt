# "Pig Problem"
## 
### 
IF Mr. Schlinck were to publish another edi
tion of his lamed "100,000,000 Guinea Pigs,"
he might well add a chapter entitled "The
Amazing Stanford Maze."
Down around the Library is a maze that sur
passes anything the psychology department
has ever seen. The laboratory conditions are
ideal. The test animals react in the only way
possible under such conditions.
The maze, of course, is the Library parking
area, reduced to less than half its size since
construction began on the Education Building.
The guinea pigs are the hundreds of students

who bottle up the north side of the Library
every morning with their hundreds of cars.
Good psychologists eguip their mazes with
exits as well as entrances. They are least give
the smart guinea pigs a chance to get out even
tually. The Library maze is different. Even the
smartest pigs find no way out. There is none.
Last guarter Men's Council realized this "pig
problem," asked the campus cops to tag auto
mobiles which blocked the driveways. But
yesterday morning there were still enough cars
blocking the parking lot bottle-neck so that by
10 o'clock no one could move.
New areas must be opened up immediately.
Work on the Education Building makes the
south side of the Libe permanently useless for
parking. But there is plenty of room to the
rear of the building if the fence posts were
moved back, the soft ground covered with
gravel. This additional space is needed right
now. Give the poor pigs a chance.â€”D. B.
