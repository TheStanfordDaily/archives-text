| 1 AY youths who must. have\thcir fling, usually end
up on The Daily circulation staff. In their official
capacities (one fifth), they circle around every morn
ing, increasing The Daily s circulation by leaks and
bounds. And occasionally they throw the paper up on
the lav/n, where the neighbor's dog can conveniently
get at it. ...
One such is a member of the A.T.O. circulating
roundel's, who throws his papers at neighbors dogs
in Palo Alto, and I know all his. patrons in that
region will laugh themselves sick when they find his
circulation was very low yesterday morning.
While riding along the other morning, the rounder
looked down to fold his papers. By the time he looked
up again, there were two fenders off of a car standing
right there in front of him. This seemed rather ex
citing to the rounder, but not nearly as exciting as it
was when he looked again, and saw that the man
driving the denuded car was Campus Cop Geoige
Burns.
W/HILE continuing in steadily decreasing spirals, 1
might as well deliver a story that is going the
rounds of the round-about Law School. It seems that
one of the law students goes out with a Gamma Phi
Bete, and has a dog, or else has a dog and goc.s out
with a Gamma Phi Bote, whichever way you like it;
if you don't you might as well stop right here and
leave for your eight o'clock, because this is going to
hurt.
It seems that the dog likes to ride around with the
law student in his car, as does the Gamma Phi Bete.
However, she does not like to ride around with the
dos, but only with the law student, and one day she
said to him: "George, I will not ride around with you
any more because I get dog hairs all over my clothes.
The law student issued an extraordinary remedy,
not desiring to continue as an ex parte man, and
cleaned up the situation.
So the next time they went riding everything
seemed to proceed satisfactorily except that they
stopped to have a cocktail with the Colonel.
After a cocktail or two, the legalist suddenly
blushed. "Jeez," he said, "after all my trouble to clean
up my car, you've still got a dog hair on you."
"I don't believe it, where?"
"On your neck," he said, grabbing for it while the
Colonel was taking a turn with a cocktail.
"Ouch," screamed the Gamma Phi, "that belongs
there."
This estoppeled the rider-in-law; so now the Gam
ma Phi goes out riding around with the dog.
