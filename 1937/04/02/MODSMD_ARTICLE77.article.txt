TMIE thought that only 54 people including Gist and
myself have signed up at the Cellar Cigar Store
for autographed and numbered copies of Our Hash
er's foisted edition doesn't sadden me in the least.
Because Our Hasher will only autograph books that
are ordered in advance, which will save my penman
ship for jail blotters. And I'm not worried about pub
lishing. Of course, I'm going to publish. Don't be
silly. And people are going to buy it. They've got
to buy it, their names will be in it. The names that
aren't mentioned in the columns will be indexed in
the back.
Our Hasher is out to capture the Bawlout trade.
