## WE WHO ARE ABOUT TO GRADUATE

long years and the lime is almost up.
Four long years of waiting for the last mile to
arrive and now it is here, actually and with a ve
hemence. Wo, llie senior class, have three months in
which to do all those things we wanted to do four
years ago. Three months to take all those courses we
wanted to take, the courses we thought would really
do us some good. Three months to rationalize our
selves out of the difficulties in which wc find our
selves.

It is pot until just now wc begin to realize how
much we have missed. I suppose we should be sad,
not in the ordinary way. feeling all achy inside, all
sort of shot to pieces with nothing firm to stand on,
but rather sad in a desolate way, sad in wondering
what it. is all about, wondering what to do about it.
For four years we have lived our lives as we
wanted to live them for ourselves and of ourselves
not in relation to the world around us.
When first we came to Stanford, wc started out to
become something or somebody on the campus or at
least to build for ourselves some sort of rock on which
to stand, but for the most part, the great majority of
us have sold ourselves down the river, have become
traitors to our ideals, our hopes, our desires.

Trying to be something we weren't and never
could be, wt> have ended up exactly as the administra
tion knew we would end up.
They told us they would train us for life, but in
stead of training us they have poured us into the
mold and are about to take us out. They knew we
were plastic and pliable at 17 and tlioy decided they
would train us the way they knew how to train us,
not as wo wanted to be trained. They trained us the
easy way, the way society says wc should be trained.
And so the administration has sold itself down the
river, too.
* * * *
We who are about to graduate are not individuals,
living our lives as we should have taught ourselves to
live. Wc are stereotyped forms cast in the shape of
that outworn likeness of a sacrosanct individual called
the American college student.
But we're not college students. We're victims of
outmoded ideas, but above all we are, or should be,
good American citizens.
I'm not looking forward to June.

It is pot until just now wc begin to realize how
much we have missed. I suppose we should be sad,
not in the ordinary way. feeling all achy inside, all
sort of shot to pieces with nothing firm to stand on,
but rather sad in a desolate way, sad in wondering
what it. is all about, wondering what to do about it.
For four years we have lived our lives as we
wanted to live them for ourselves and of ourselves
not in relation to the world around us.
When first we came to Stanford, wc started out to
become something or somebody on the campus or at
least to build for ourselves some sort of rock on which
to stand, but for the most part, the great majority of
us have sold ourselves down the river, have become
traitors to our ideals, our hopes, our desires.

Trying to be something we weren't and never
could be, wt> have ended up exactly as the administra
tion knew we would end up.
They told us they would train us for life, but in
stead of training us they have poured us into the
mold and are about to take us out. They knew we
were plastic and pliable at 17 and tlioy decided they
would train us the way they knew how to train us,
not as wo wanted to be trained. They trained us the
easy way, the way society says wc should be trained.
And so the administration has sold itself down the
river, too.

We who are about to graduate are not individuals,
living our lives as we should have taught ourselves to
live. Wc are stereotyped forms cast in the shape of
that outworn likeness of a sacrosanct individual called
the American college student.
But we're not college students. We're victims of
outmoded ideas, but above all we are, or should be,
good American citizens.
I'm not looking forward to June.

long years and the lime is almost up.
Four long years of waiting for the last mile to
arrive and now it is here, actually and with a ve
hemence. Wo, llie senior class, have three months in
which to do all those things we wanted to do four
years ago. Three months to take all those courses we
wanted to take, the courses we thought would really
do us some good. Three months to rationalize our
selves out of the difficulties in which wc find our
selves.
