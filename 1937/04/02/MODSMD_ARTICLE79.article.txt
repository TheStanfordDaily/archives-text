# Tickets Go On Sale For Concert By Highest Paid Series Artist
## 
### 
Lawrence Tibbctt, who is appear
ing on April 10 for the last presen
tation of the 1930-37 Concert Series,
i:i the highest priced artist ever to
appear at Sanford University. Tick
ets for the concert are priced at
$2.50, $2 and $1.50, and are on sale I
at the Concert Series office in the
Old Union, Keeble's in Palo Alto,
and Sherman Clay in San Jose.
Back in the fall of '20 a bright
boy by the name of Wilfred Davis
decided that Stanford should have a
chance at some of the spare culture
floating around. He managed to get
quite a few people to enthuse along >
with him, and they started the Stan- J
ford "Music" Series.
Six concerts wei c; given and the
A.S.S.U. had to dive deep into its j
pockets to cover the deficit. By the i
end of the 1929-30 season, it was j
made up.
Then in 1933 came the Series' !
crucial test. A deficit was piling i
up, and there was ; big discussion, j
which ended in a student body vote. I
But Bernardino Molinari conducted !
the San Francisco Symphony in a j
wow concert, and the vote came |
out 10 to 1 in favor of continuing I
the recitals. The Series was pulled ;
out of the hole, but with the agree- !
mcnt that Wilfred Davis and his San
Francisco management should un
derwrite the concerts, thus taking |
responsibility from A.S.S.U. shoul- {
ders. Carolyn Ware, of NBC and j
Columbia Artists, docs it now.
The concert management is still '
in the hole, in spite of the fact that |
it made money last year and ex- i
pects to clear a little at the end of I
this season. Biggest drawing card of
the series was big, blond Nelson ;
Eddy. Prices paid for artist range j
from $.'5OOO to $000. At present the
Concert Series seems to be firmly i
enough established to be practically j
a tradition.

ders. Carolyn Ware, of NBC and j
Columbia Artists, docs it now.
The concert management is still '
in the hole, in spite of the fact that |
it made money last year and ex- i
pects to clear a little at the end of I
this season. Biggest drawing card of
the series was big, blond Nelson ;
Eddy. Prices paid for artist range j
from $.'5OOO to $000. At present the
Concert Series seems to be firmly i
enough established to be practically j
a tradition.
