"TOVARICH." ridiculous, crazy, i
delightful comedy-drama now play- |
ing at the Curran Theater, is the best
play that has hit San Francisco this j
season, not excepting "First Lady." j
Written by Jacques Dcval, it is |
one of the few French contempo- j
rary pieces that has been successful !
in English translation. Credit for
this is due in part to the witty lines
of Translator - playwright Robert
Sherwood, and in part to the superb ,
acting of Eugenie Leonovich as the
Archduchess Tatiana Petrovna, and
Osgood Perkins as Prince Mikhail
Alexandrovitch Ouratief.
From the very moment the cur
tain rises on a sordid Paris hotel i
room where the impoverished royal J
pair are down to their last shirt and !
sou. Miss Leonovich captivates the i
audicnee with the charm of her per- i
sonality and the exquisite finesse of |
her acting.
The plot is fantastic, but the j
characters are so realistically por- j
trayed that his only adds to the en- I
joyment of the play. It tells how '
the Russian grand duchess and her i
consort, having escaped from the
Bolsheviks with four billion francs j
entrusted them by the Tsar, live in ;
poverty and even resort to petty
I thievery in order to leave this sum
intact until the old regime is re
stored. They give it finally to their j
bitterest enemy, the Soviet Com- ]
missar Gorotchenko, in order to save I
the one thing they both loveâ€”Rus- j
