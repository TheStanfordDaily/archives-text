# Troy Conquered By Redskin Nine In Close Battle
## Errors in Ninth Cost Troy Game, 4-3; Win Gives Cards Third Place Tie 
### ART ALLEN 
Thanks to two costly errors by a hitherto perfect Southern California
defense. Coach Harry Wolter's Indian nine won the third game of its
series with the Trojans, 4-3, here Saturday. The victory brought the Cards
into a third place tie with U.C.L.A., trailing U.S.C. by half a game and
California by one and one-half games.

Stanford opened the scoring in the'
first as Linde drove the ball back
through the pitcher's box, Tam laid
down a perfect sacrifice bunt, and
deWitt doubled to the farthest cor
-sier of left field to score Linde. Troy
came back with two runs in her half
of the second inning, scoring on two
hits, and errors by Farrell and
Heagerty.
In the last of the fifth, a hit by
Holnian, a walk to Hanna, and
Pitcher Furman's double to right
center field scored two Stanford
runs.
U.S.C. came right back in the
sixth, tying up the game at three
all, when sccond-haseman Lilly
drove a long fly to center field to
score Bernardino from third base.
The winning run was scored in
the last of the ninth inning with
none out. Farrell walked and Ham
ilton laid down a good bunt toward
third base. Third-baseman Tan
ner's throw to first base was low,
and Farrell continued toward third.
Schwartz, first base, overthrew try
ing for Farrell, allowing him to
score the winning run.
The Indians play Santa Clara
there Wednesday, and California
here Saturday. They must con
tinue to show improvement to re
turn to their early season form to
win these games, if they are to be
around for the championship.
