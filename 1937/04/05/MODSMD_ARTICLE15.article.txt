# Sigma Delta Chi Plans Revision
## Author of Reorganization Is Stanford President 
### 
Reorganization of Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic fra
ternity, into an American Intistute
of Journalists is proposed in a
pamphlet issued today by John Mc-
Clelland, associate editor of the
Daily last year and president of the
Stanford Sigma Delta Chi chapter.
Fifteen hundred copies of the
pamphlet, titled "The Future of
Sigma Delta Chi" have been sent out
to alumni members of the organiza
tion throughout, the country. Orig
inal proposals for the reorganization
of the fraternity were drawn up in
1936 by Professor Chilton R. Bush,
head of the Stanford division of
journalism.
The purpose of a journalist's in
stitute, McClelland's pamphlet says,
would be "to better the standards of
journalism through the education,
work and attitude of all the mem
bers of. the profession." The insti
tute of journalism, McClelland em
phasized, would not compete with
the American Newspaper Guild, a
trade union organization.
The pamphlet concludes with a
questionnaire on plans for the re
organization of Sigma Delta Chi.
Depending upon the results of the
poll, McCellland plans to bring his
proposals for the formation of an
American Institute of Journalists up
at the next national convention of
the fraternity.
