IN THE NATURE
OF A COMEBACK
There was a pretty fair crowd out
to see the baseball game against
U.S.C. Saturday—it must have been
the crowd or something that fired
up the team, because collectively it
turned in a pretty good ball game.
Little Tarn, the second baseman,
was back in the line-up after having
been left out in favor of Burnett last
Tuesday against St. Mary's, and he
played fine ball. He seems to fit in
with Holman, Farrell, and Linde to
make up a better infield combina
tion than any other Harry Wolter
can arrange.
Spike Furraan, in spite of the
fact that he made two of four In
dian errors, kept the Trojans from
bunching any of their hits—the
best they could do was two hits in
the second inning, the remaining
five were all alone in their inn
ings.
Not only that, but Spike pounded
out a fine double in the last half of
the fifth to drive in two runs, which
ought to just about give him credit
for winning his own ball game.
BUT COMEBACKS
HAVE TO BE THOROUGH
That last inning run was like
manna from heaven. It came in on
a beautiful bunt by Glenn Hamilton,
and Ham deserves all the credit in
the world for the placing of that
would-be sacrifice.
Just the same, the Cards hadn't
better get cocky because they beat
the Trojans, for more than one
reason. First, Goofy Joe Gon
zales wasn't pitching, and he can
pitch better than any other Tro
jan. Second, that last-inning score
came in on two errors, even though
Hamilton laid down a swell bunt.
Third, lite U.S.C. team outhit
them, seven to six, which doesn't
look too hot.
Wolter's boys deserye a little
praise, but they still have a lot of
ball games, and you can't win base
ball games unless you either play
good ball or scare the other boys
into thinking you're playing good
ball. They kept in the running for
the championship, though, by win
ning Saturday, and it will do no
harm to fill the stands once or twice
to let them know they're playing
for Stanford.
DOGGONE, THEY SURE
HAVE A TRACK'TEAM *
The Trojans kind of took it on the
chin all the way around on the Farm
this week-end. since the swimming
team and the tennis team defeated
them Friday.
They did pretty well in their
own bailiwick, though, for their
track team trounced Fresno State
81-41. That in itself isn't terrific.
but some of the marks made were
colossal. Even though there was a
wind blowing, Adrian Talley's 9 4
100 was little short of sensational,
and then he chased Crane home in
the 220 in 20.5, another astonish
ing mark.
Wind doesn't help pole vaulters

and high jumpers very much, but
Meadows did 14-4 with the bamboo
and Thurber tied with Croson of
Fresno at 6-4% in the hippity-hop.
Dink Templet on and Brutus Ham
ilton ought to start holding their
heads in their hands right now.
What a track team, again.
