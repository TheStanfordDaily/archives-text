# Farm Teams Win Eight Of Nine Events
## 
### 
Outside of losing the Olympic
Club track meet Saturday, which
wouldn't disgrace any team in the
country in a dual meet, Stanford's
athletes had a thoroughly enjoyable
week-end at the expense of lots of
people.
VARSITY BASEBALLERS got
the laugh on Goofy Joe Gonzales
and the rest of the U.S.C. team with
a 4-3 victory Saturday, Spike Fur
man doing yeoman duty on the
hump.
VARSITY SWIMMERS took the
relay to win their meet against the
Trojans Friday afternoon, 44-31, and
then manhandled the Occidental
College varsity, 57-18, Saturday, to
make it clear that Stanford has
something in the way of a swim
ming team.
VARSITY TENNIS men rubbed
out their defeat down south by the
Trojans with a 5-4 victory over the
Southern Cal squad Friday.
VARSITY TRACK men—yes, yes,
you've heard—lost their meet with
the Winged O, but they showed some
pretty good marks, so things are
looking up.
FRESHMAN TRACK men took the
P.A.L. All-Stars, 81 1-3 to 30 2-3,
Saturday morning, with little
trouble.
FRESHMAN BASEBALLERS de
feated Lowell high Friday, 9-5, and
then won again Saturday against
Alameda High, 4-1.
FRESHMAN TENNIS men de
feated Modesto J.C., 8-1, Friday, and
San Francisco J.C., 5-4, Saturday.
FRESHMAN GOLFERS won all
four matches in defeating Menlo
Junior College, 12-0, Saturday
morning.
