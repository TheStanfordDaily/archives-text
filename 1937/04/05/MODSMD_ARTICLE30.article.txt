# Cardinal Swim Team Downs Troy Invaders
## Indians Take 41-34 Win; Sink Occidental Squad By 57-18 Avalanche 
### GENE GEAR 
Troy's natators took high honors
in five of the nine events in Fri
day's swimming meet, but the In
dian paddlers had strength as well
as individual stars, and emerged on
the long end of a 44-31 score.
Saturday, Cal turned on the heat
to whip the Trojans, 41-34, so this
Saturday's traditional meeting
should be quite a spectacle.
Saturday in Encina Pools, Stan
ford's varsity mermen sunk the Oc
cidental outfit with an avalanche of
points, 57-18.
Praises Towne
Coach Nort Thornton was lavish
in his praise of Don Towne, crack
varsity breaststroker, after the Tro
jan "meet. The Card mentor attrib
utes Friday's victory over the de
fending conference champs to the
submarine style expert.
Bob Boales, undoubtedly one of
the best middle distance swimmers
on the coast, chalked up two wins
for the Trojans by upsetting Don
Peterson in the 220 and whipping
Win Needham and Dave Rider in the
440.
Trio Stars
A survey of the points shows that
Troy invaded Northern California
with nothing much more than a
three-man team, but it was some
team.
Troy's great trio, including Boales,
Hatch, and Park, scored 25 points,
leaving 6 points to be divided among
the remainder of the Trojan squad.
Park streaked through the water
to bang up a new record of 1:40.1
in the backstroke event.
