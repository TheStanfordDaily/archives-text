# Winged 'O' In 82-49 Win Over Cards
## Farm Defeat Expected; Compare to O.C. Win Over Bears March 20 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Quite like everybody expected,
the Olympic Club trackmen from
San Francisco took all but two first
places in defeating Coach Dink Tem
plefon's Stanford varsity, 82-49, here
Saturday.
Worthy of footnote to this score
is (lie fact that the Clubmen took
California by SO 1 -50 1 two weeks
ago, which comparison points
toward a very interesting Big
IVloel on April 21.
The track surface was fast but the
wind strong, and performances suf
fered accordingly. Outstanding ef
fort of the day was probably Bright's
4:16.4 mile —below his best but still
the fastest run on the coast this
year—behind which Bob Alexander
of Stanford pounded home in 4:19.5,
and this stamps him as in a class by
himself when collegiate milers are
considered.
Best Racc
Best thriller of the day was the
quarter, in which Weiershauser
and Mulntt of Stanford put <sn
torturing stretch sprints to finish
inches behind A1 Fitch of the club,
who won, according to one judge,
in 4X.7. The SXO too was no slow
league, as Elroy Robinson gave a
brilliant demonstration in beating
Captain Bill McCurdy of Stanford
by 5 yards in 1:54.5.
The shorter races yielded fine re
sults considering the strong up
stretch wind that was blowing. Fish
back's 23.9 flight of lows, and Carew's
22.1 220 show fine promise, the latter
race being the only clean sweep of
the day, and together with the mile
relay the only first places won by
Stanford.
New A.A.U. rulings giving tied
jump events to the man clearing
in the least number of trials were
used in both the pole vault and
high jump, much to the disgust of
those present.
A meager 100 fans turned out to
see former Stanford men competing !
for the club run up 36 points, nearly I
as much as the present Stanford run- i
liers tolled.

Quite like everybody expected,
the Olympic Club trackmen from
San Francisco took all but two first
places in defeating Coach Dink Tem
plefon's Stanford varsity, 82-49, here
Saturday.
Worthy of footnote to this score
is (lie fact that the Clubmen took
California by SO 1 -50 1 two weeks
ago, which comparison points
toward a very interesting Big
IVloel on April 21.
The track surface was fast but the
wind strong, and performances suf
fered accordingly. Outstanding ef
fort of the day was probably Bright's
4:16.4 mile —below his best but still
the fastest run on the coast this
year—behind which Bob Alexander
of Stanford pounded home in 4:19.5,
and this stamps him as in a class by
himself when collegiate milers are
considered.
Best Racc
Best thriller of the day was the
quarter, in which Weiershauser
and Mulntt of Stanford put <sn
torturing stretch sprints to finish
inches behind A1 Fitch of the club,
who won, according to one judge,
in 4X.7. The SXO too was no slow
league, as Elroy Robinson gave a
brilliant demonstration in beating
Captain Bill McCurdy of Stanford
by 5 yards in 1:54.5.
The shorter races yielded fine re
sults considering the strong up
stretch wind that was blowing. Fish
back's 23.9 flight of lows, and Carew's
22.1 220 show fine promise, the latter
race being the only clean sweep of
the day, and together with the mile
relay the only first places won by
Stanford.
New A.A.U. rulings giving tied
jump events to the man clearing
in the least number of trials were
used in both the pole vault and
high jump, much to the disgust of
those present.
A meager 100 fans turned out to
