# Frosh Down Track Stars Crush High School Group
## 
### JACK O'DONNELL 
Sweeping .ill but one first place,
and exhibiting a power the likes of
which call to mintl great frosh teams
of yore, Dink Temple ton's freshman
track squad poured it on, 82 1-3 to
MO 2-3, last Saturday morning, with
a sizeable bunch of Peninsula high
school all-stars on the receiving end.
The meet took place here, on An
gell Field, and revealed quite defi
nitely that Dink's varsity squad
won't be entirely lacking a year
hence.
Sparling, Simpson Star
High-point winners again were
Jeny Sparling and Dick Simpson,
both of whom came through with
firsts, the one in the sprints.and
the other in the hurdle events.
Sparling turned in a nice hun
dred, negotiating the distance in
10.2, with team-mate Bob Seng
stack a fairly close third, and, later
in the day, knocked off a 22.7 fur
long.
Takes Lows, Highs
Simpson spreadeagled the fields in
both the highs and the lows, turn
ing in a 15.6 mark in the former
race, and a near-brilliant 25.2 in
the latter.
Stan Anderson of the fro.sh put
the pound shot 50 feet 9 inches to
win that event, while George Rock
well's 52.4 440 and Ray Brown's 22
feet 7 inches in the broad jump, were
other Stanford performances that
surpassed the point of mediocrity.
Tempelton Encouraged
But the two lads who most warm
ed Coach Templeton's heart's cock
les were Randy Lee, with a surpris
ing 12-foot effort in the pole vault,
and Russ Wulff, who hauled himself
up over 6 feet l'i inches in the high

jump to win that event in brilliant
fashion. Those two kids will bear
watching.
