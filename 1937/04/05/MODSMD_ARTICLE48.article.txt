THE DAILY'S best-read feature, Campus Opin
ion, today takes a whap at Stanford's politi
cal set-up.
It screams in the same breath against the
"Menlo Carnival" nominating assembly Thurs
day and that closed corporation, the A.S.S.U.,
which allegedly leaves the student electorate
in a blue funk of ignorance.
The Opinionator's moaning at the bar of pub
lic opinion should engage more than one politi
cal eye.
Symptomatic of what has happened to the
national electorate is D.C.H.'s complaint that he
can't get the information about his government
requisite to intelligent citizenship.
And deeply indicative of a viewpoint less
local than sweepingly national is his complaint
against sugar-coating the political pill as an in
appropriate means to stir the governmental
stew, as well as to mix a metaphor.
At Stanford, student government is cherished
consciously by those who govern, certainly un
consciously by those who are governed. lust
let Dr. Wilbur take back the reins of student
administration, and see what a howl would go
up—not only from the politicos, but from
D.C.H.'s from the Fiji House to the nether re
gions of Encina.
Like the man who talked his throat sore about
Roosevelt and Landon and then didn't vote,
D.C.H. writes about 600 words about govern
ment, and then says government doesn't in
terest him. In spite of columns.of Daily pub
licity, plus a nominating assembly designed
to flagellate just his flagging interest, he de
clares he can't find out what it's all about and
can't "get enthusiastic about something with
which he has had no personal contacts."
Actually, we suspect that D.C.H. wouldn't
get interested if he were carried into lim Rey
nolds' office by six Nubian slaves on a plush
palanquin.
He probably didn't even show at the pre
registration period at the beginning of fall quar
ter, specifically designed to orient freshmen to
the Farm and its political and social vagaries.
And he probably won't show up at the
"Menlo Carnival" assembly, more because it's
an assembly than because it's a carnival.
There are hundreds like him at Stanford, and
that's too bad. But don't forget that there are
millions like him in the United States, en
franchised only on the books of their precincts.
They declare they can't get the facts on national !
issues because of political pressure on news
papers, magazines and the radio. So instead of
trying to find out what it's all about, they go
to the movies and pay their taxes even as their
ancestors, crushed by serfdom, paid taxes to
the power who lived in the castle on a medieval
Capitol Hill.
Their attitude, which no amount of official
solicitation can modify, makes dictatorship what
it is, and Democracy what it is not.
