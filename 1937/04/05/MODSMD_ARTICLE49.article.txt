# The 						Dragons Still Sleep

WHETHER or not Ex Committee's scheme of
moving spring elections up a month will
increase the new officers' knowledge and effi
ciency is still a question. One result of the
change, however, is already apparent.
The campus isn't ready for the year's biggest
election a week from tomorrow —because the
campus doesn't know whom to elect.
Biggest quarter for student-body activities is
always spring. The Convalescent Home Drive,
the sophomores' carnival, the juniors' water day
—the campus is working on more committees
and drives spring quarter than all the rest of
the year.
Because you can't pick nominees out of a
hat, intelligently at least, even A.S.S.U. poli
ticians need a "proving ground" —somewhere
they can find the likeliest candidates. The
spring committees are that "proving ground."
Last year, with elections the last of May, pre
voting ballyhoo was blatant because there was
somebody to ballyhoo. Row and Hall had
selected their axes and busily ground them.

The Convalescent Home Drive had weeded out
the politically actives, had proved the ability
of those who had it, had provided a roster of
good A.S.S.U. candidates.
But this year Stanford's Row-Hall dragons are
still in the stupor of winter hibernation—be
cause there's been nothing noisy enough to
arouse them. Few committees and few big
activities have brought little political timber
to the front.
Hence when nominations are made tomorrow
and Wednesday, the choices will be haphazard,
more strictly "political" than ever. The question
is, then, will the post-election advantage of
early spring elections —a longer training period
before the new officers take their posts —out-
weigh the pre-election disadvantage—lack of
an adequate "proving ground" from which to
pick able candidates? —D. B.
