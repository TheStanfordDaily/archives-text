a spirit moves on the face of that void known
as the Library has been apparent for some time.
Table-rapping, and mysterious voices floating down
from on high, books that disappear into air, people
flying into trances while paying fines on overdue books,
and weird sound effects furnished by the American
Radiator Company suggest that there's more there
than cheats the eye.
That this is not all spirits of camphor or animal
spirits, or spirits, seems to be borne out by the re
searches conducted by a sophomore from La Goon
Ita, who took out Ibsen's "Ghosts" one day last week
and was proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory man
ner until she got to the last page and found it was
missing. She turned it in and got another one, and
was proceeding in a thoroughly satisfactory manner,
until she got to the last page, which was also missing.
She immediately cashcd in her call slips and spirited
herself home.
r PHE contractor who is builder of the education
prof's Dream Home on Frenchman's Hill isn't quite
so enthusiastic about things of the spirit, either. It
seems that famous architect Frank Uftalloyed Wright
has lots of novel ideas which the practical-minded man

house is the hexagon. Rooms, furniture, rugs, lights,
everything is in the form of the hexagon, everything,
except the education prof, that is.
The beds must be built in the shape of parallelo
grams to fit in with the hexagonal pattern, and mat
tresses and springs have to be specially made with

morning and all night, too, for that matter.
bathroom fixtures are doing all right, except
for the bathtub, which they can't saw out on both
ends and still take a bath in, so Frank Unalloyed
has decided they'd sink it down in the floor. When
somebody pointed out they'd have to lie down on
their stomachs in order to clean it, the famous archi
tect pointed out that he always cleaned the bathtub
after he used it.
There haven't been any provisions made for wall
plugs because the famous architect thinks that things
are getting too convenient these days and people
the slanting ends. This will enable the occupants to

you had to climb up and screw the vacuum cleaner
cord into the light fixture.
