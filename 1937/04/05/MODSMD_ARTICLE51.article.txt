rOCKET-FULL OF RYE-KRISP

¥N THE good old days two or three years ago, there
used to be three local radio programs of classic
quality.
One of them was my old friend and soul-inspirer,
Dr. Thompson.
Another was the KROW midnight jamboree an
nouncer, who used to chirp, "yessirree folks, and a
hipper-dipper to all you people who want to have
the time of your life, right now. Just drive all the way
out East San Pablo to Joe's Cafe.
"It's the brightest spot In Fruitvale, the crossroads
of the West, where you are always sure to find your
friends. And now for Jo-Jo the dog-faccd boy and to
Vera from Viola and for all the boys and girls out at
Mike's in Hayward, we play this recording of the
Hoosier Hot Shots, 'Yes She Do, No She Don't.'"

The other gem of the ether waves was the electric
ally-transcribed blurb that one of the smaller stations
used to run in between phonograph records. It was
a playlet on the following order:
"Hello, Mabel dear, how many votes are you get
ting in the popularity contest?"
"Oh, aunty dear, I have more votes than anybody
else now."
"But Mabel dear, I though Gracie Glumpf was way
ahead of you."
"She was, auntie dear, but that was before I started
taking Carter's Little Liver Pills."

That was all in the good old days, mind you. Dr.
Thompson now seems impossible to find anywhere on
the dial, and although the KROW cheer-boy may still
be going, the Carter Liver Pill contribution has not
been heard for some time.
But never fear, time marches on and the National
Broadcasting Company and Rye-Krisp have filled
these gaping holes with something terrific indeed.
They have given us Marion Talley, that glamorous
star of opera, screen and radio who knocked off 20
pounds or so by eating Ryc-Krisp.
* * «• *
I TOW her sponsors love to relate the heroism of Miss
Talley as she stuffed herself with bushels and
bushels of Ryc-Krisp. Let the Ryc-Krisp magnates
have their way, and they will blow up the saga of
Miss Talley until it becomes a national epic like Hob
son and the Merrimac, taking the message to Garcia,
or the boy on the burning deck.
Every imet tehy introduce the program, the trum
pets blare and the announcer says that Marion Talley
is thin and beautiful because she ate Ryc-Krisp.
Every time she opens her mouth to squeak they tell of
her reducing feat.
But once in a while they alternate with a message
of hope to American women:
"You thousands of listeners who doubtless want to
know if Miss Talley feels as good as she looks after
eating Rye-Krisp, will be interested to know that be
sides being one of Hollywood's busiest women, Miss
Talley finds time to swim, dance, ride, play tennis, and
even roller skate."
What do you know about that?
As Mary Livingston might have it:
"Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of Rye-Krisp,
Stuff a bustle full of Rye-Krisp, and what have
you got?
Marion Talley."
Play, Don.
