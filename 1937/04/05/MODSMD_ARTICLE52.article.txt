ENCINA EXPIRATION

The Editor, Sir:
Whatever the season, it seems to
be quite the style for the political
bigwigs of the Farm to get all lath
ered up over the apparent apathy
of the Stanfordite towards his
school's student-body gymnastics.
The latest expiration by way of ex
plaining this decides that people are
disinterested in A.S.S.U. offices, Ex
Committee decisions, elections and
such for the simple reason that they
aren't interesting. (Good logic there.)
Therefore let's spice them up with
a couple of vaudeville acts and a
side-show exhibit from the Menlo
Carnival.
But if this is the case, what pow
erful urge sponsors the big-wigging
of the frantic big-wigs already on
deck? This seems to indicate that
there is something to the game after
all, although even this local enthus- ;
iasm is considerably dampened by ;
the pathetically few nominations
that seem to appear on the A.S.S.U.
ballots. Might not the disinterest of
the student body be due to the |
heavy shadows and deep fog sur
rounding the north end of the Un
ion? Frankly, it seems no one knows
what Stanford student activities are 1
all about except for that small mi- ;
nority of "business" folk who are !
almost majoring in "politics." Not
that we don't owe them all a debt of |
gratitude for it.
No one can say that the Daily has
n't been hearty in the support and
publicity it has given all the activi
ties of the A.S.S.U. But aside from
the dry grut that the Ex Committee
and such grind over, no one knows
how or why about what, and more
important, no one knows how he or
she as an individual can come in
contact with the administration of
student activities. We see that the
Ex Committee has decided on some
course of action; we see its re- j
suit and its effect on us. But as fax
as we're concerned it might just as
well be done on Mars. '
Being a freshman, I see the situa- i
tion from a freshman's point of view !
and so all the above may sound only j
like the pitiful bleatings of a high j
school kid lost in a "big college." j
But let's try some more logic. Since j
it is as a freshman that a college !
student gets his first and most last- j
ing impressions, his interests and j
activities are going to take a definite !
stamp during this first year. As a j
sophomore and junior he is more j
than likely to deepend to a rut the I
scratches he made as a freshman; as i
a senior the whole business is far !
beneath him.
To a freshman the entire college '
layout is â€¢at first a confused and 1
sometimes terrifying jumble. There- i
fore, if no personal interest is !
aroused in certain activities when a .
fellow is just warming up, how can \
you expect him to be enthusiastic I
over something with which he has
had no personal contacts.
Granted that the Daily publishes, j
say, an announcement of Rally Com- j
mittee tryouts. A few Frosh will j
have the courage and interest to take ]
up the bid. But the average student 1
first wants to know what it's all
about and why he should be inter- 1
csted in it aside from the opportu- j
nity of getting his name in the paper. :
So why not let the frosh come into
personal contact with the mysteri
ous powers that pull A.S.S.U.
strings. This may seem a selfish j
point of view, but I do honestly j
think that a large part of the apathy
toward student affairs now attrib
uted to a bored lack of interest may
be laid to an absence of any real
knowledge and understanding of the {
administrative activities.
