# SENIOR SAND BAG
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Although I have not been brought
up in the "round-house district" of
my local village, I believe I can rcc- j
ognize a good "railroader" when I :
see one. For that reason I would 1
take this opportunity to congratu- ;
late Mr. Mort D'Evelyn on his ex- i
cellent example of railroading, j
throughout the current year and cli- |
maxed with the latest move of the j
Senior Prom.
The Farm has been the scene of

many fast "switches" during the last
four years, but former politicians
are put to shame by our illustrious j
president.
Mort seems to have changed his
mind about having the Senior
Prom and decided on a fast switch
from the original schedule. Ac
cordingly, he appointed his So
cial Activities Committee to at
tend to the negotiations. This «
committee was co-heade by the
Phi Delt T. M. McDaniel.
The proof that this was a wise
decision was borne out by the fact :
that the appointment was followed
| in a few short hours by the an
j nouncement that the committee —
' busily engaged in its work — had
successfully signed Jimmy Dorsey j
and his band for a campus engage- I
ment. The first inkling of any affair '
' was that the Prom would be given ,
j in May.
Now we poor passengers find
that the ninth of April is the day
of our Senior Prom. It would
never cross any of our minds that
perhaps everything had been ar
ranged before the committee was
appointed, because that might
possibly carry an odor.
I Mort decided to do away with j

senior meetings. "They are too
clumsy to handle," was his only
comment. Undoubtedly this is so,
but then again a great deal of in
teresting discussions on what sen
iors would like, instead of
Mort and his local clique would like,
might be introduced into the gen
eral discussions.
Might I suggest that from here
on in we seniors he allowed a
little say in what is going on
around here . . . especially when
such "goings-on" affect us direct
ly. There have already been three
or four house dances, one Toyon-
Branner dance scheduled among
other campus affairs for the ninth
of April, and, although I would
not swear to this, I do believe that
our efficient committee had for
gotten to get the approval of the
Ex Committee for the Senior
Prom.
But, as has been done before (but
not nearly so well, dear editor), we
passengers might as well sit back
and watch the train go by.

The Editor, Sir:
Although I have not been brought
up in the "round-house district" of
my local village, I believe I can rcc- j
ognize a good "railroader" when I :
see one. For that reason I would 1
take this opportunity to congratu- ;
late Mr. Mort D'Evelyn on his ex- i
cellent example of railroading, j
throughout the current year and cli- |
maxed with the latest move of the j
Senior Prom.
The Farm has been the scene of

many fast "switches" during the last
four years, but former politicians
are put to shame by our illustrious j
president.
Mort seems to have changed his
mind about having the Senior
Prom and decided on a fast switch
from the original schedule. Ac
cordingly, he appointed his So
cial Activities Committee to at
tend to the negotiations. This «
committee was co-heade by the
Phi Delt T. M. McDaniel.
The proof that this was a wise
decision was borne out by the fact :
that the appointment was followed
| in a few short hours by the an
j nouncement that the committee —
' busily engaged in its work — had
successfully signed Jimmy Dorsey j
and his band for a campus engage- I
ment. The first inkling of any affair '
' was that the Prom would be given ,
j in May.
Now we poor passengers find
that the ninth of April is the day
of our Senior Prom. It would
never cross any of our minds that
perhaps everything had been ar
ranged before the committee was
appointed, because that might
possibly carry an odor.
I Mort decided to do away with j

senior meetings. "They are too
clumsy to handle," was his only
comment. Undoubtedly this is so,
but then again a great deal of in
teresting discussions on what sen
iors would like, instead of
Mort and his local clique would like,
might be introduced into the gen
eral discussions.
Might I suggest that from here
on in we seniors he allowed a
little say in what is going on
around here . . . especially when
such "goings-on" affect us direct
ly. There have already been three
or four house dances, one Toyon-
Branner dance scheduled among
other campus affairs for the ninth
of April, and, although I would
not swear to this, I do believe that
our efficient committee had for
gotten to get the approval of the
Ex Committee for the Senior
Prom.
But, as has been done before (but
not nearly so well, dear editor), we
passengers might as well sit back
and watch the train go by.
Sincerely,
J.ust a Passenger
