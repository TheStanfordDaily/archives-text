# Hall Men Steal Jump on Row; Groom Dark Horses for Caucus
## 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM, JR 
Time was when political brains
lived in the Row, and when election
time came round, the boys rustled up
from their dugouts and fired before
the fellows in Toyon or Branner
could slam a door.
Them days are gone forever.
Dark Horse Fair
Like Rosa Bonheur's famous
painting (in the negative) will be

him the best man for the job. Sad
eyed Phi Delts argue that the Zetes
got the champ last year, and that,
anyway, Bob Mcßoskey is a bucka
roo of the first order and the logical
man for the job.
Roped, Tied in 10 Seconds
At last year's rodeo a ditto situa
tion was roped and tied in a rip
roaring 10 seconds when in a secret
deal Reynolds got a royal flush and
the presidency, Mort D'Evelyn a
straight flush and the senior class
presidency, and Bob Hoover hung up
four of a kind to be called with the
presidency of the Inter-Fraternity
Council.
