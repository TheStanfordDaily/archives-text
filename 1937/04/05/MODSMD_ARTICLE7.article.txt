# Hall Men Steal Jump on Row; Groom Dark Horses for Caucus
## 
### SOLON O. SWAMPUM, JR 
Time was when political brains
lived in the Row, and when election
time came round, the boys rustled up
from their dugouts and fired before
the fellows in Toyon or Branner
could slam a door.
Them days are gone forever.
Dark Horse Fair
Like Rosa Bonheur's famous
painting (in the negative) will be
Toyon Lobby tonight. It'll be the
horse fair, but restricted entirely
to dark horses. Ten flat, or sharp, is
the time when Hall politicians, their
roommates and their stooges will
throw the political Broncos, and bull,
without smokes or ice cream, but
with a sure-fire lariat that will get
them a Hall sweep of nominations
tomorrow, possibly the election on
April 13.
Batting against this two-gunned,
two-fisted combine will be a bunch
of Greeks running around with their
tails between their legs.
Row May Split
Sans leaders, sans cauci, sans ev
erything, the Row is liable to find
itself up on top of the proverbial
greased flagpole. Red flag which
may set off a ticklish situation wifh
a loud boom is the threatened split
between Lasuen Powers —Phi Delta
Theta and Zeta Psi.
Uppity Zetes think favorite son
Tom Killefer the logical Row candi
date for A.S.S.U. president, calling
him the best man for the job. Sad
eyed Phi Delts argue that the Zetes
got the champ last year, and that,
anyway, Bob Mcßoskey is a bucka
roo of the first order and the logical
man for the job.
Roped, Tied in 10 Seconds
At last year's rodeo a ditto situa
tion was roped and tied in a rip
roaring 10 seconds when in a secret
deal Reynolds got a royal flush and
the presidency, Mort D'Evelyn a
straight flush and the senior class
presidency, and Bob Hoover hung up
four of a kind to be called with the
presidency of the Inter-Fraternity
Council.
The 24 positions for which can

didates must be nominated sometime
between 8 o'clock tomorrow and 5
Wednesday afternoon include:
A.S.S.U.: President and vice-presi
dent.
Ex Committee: Senior man, senior
woman, junior woman, sophomore
man, graduate member, and mem
ber at large.
Women's Conference: President,
vice-president, and secretary
treasurer.
Men's Council: Two members.
Women's Council: Two members.
W.A.A.: President, secretary-treas
urer, besides senior, junior and
sophomore representatives, and
head of women's intramural.
Alumni Council: Senior representa
tive.
8.A.C.: One undergraduate member.
Hitherto vice-president and secre
tary - treasurer of Women's Con
ference have been elected from
within that body, but a new by-law
calls for their election by the "eleven
hundred." Vice-president must be
in the upper division, but the secre
tary-treasurer may be a sopho
more.

may set off a ticklish situation wifh
a loud boom is the threatened split
between Lasuen Powers —Phi Delta
Theta and Zeta Psi.
Uppity Zetes think favorite son
Tom Killefer the logical Row candi
date for A.S.S.U. president, calling
him the best man for the job. Sad
eyed Phi Delts argue that the Zetes
got the champ last year, and that,
anyway, Bob Mcßoskey is a bucka
roo of the first order and the logical
man for the job.
Roped, Tied in 10 Seconds
At last year's rodeo a ditto situa
tion was roped and tied in a rip
roaring 10 seconds when in a secret
deal Reynolds got a royal flush and
the presidency, Mort D'Evelyn a
straight flush and the senior class
presidency, and Bob Hoover hung up
four of a kind to be called with the
presidency of the Inter-Fraternity
Council.
The 24 positions for which can

didates must be nominated sometime
between 8 o'clock tomorrow and 5
Wednesday afternoon include:
A.S.S.U.: President and vice-presi
dent.
Ex Committee: Senior man, senior
woman, junior woman, sophomore
man, graduate member, and mem
ber at large.
Women's Conference: President,
vice-president, and secretary
treasurer.
Men's Council: Two members.
Women's Council: Two members.
W.A.A.: President, secretary-treas
urer, besides senior, junior and
sophomore representatives, and
head of women's intramural.
Alumni Council: Senior representa
tive.
8.A.C.: One undergraduate member.
Hitherto vice-president and secre
tary - treasurer of Women's Con
ference have been elected from
within that body, but a new by-law
calls for their election by the "eleven
hundred." Vice-president must be
in the upper division, but the secre
tary-treasurer may be a sopho
more.
Time was when political brains
lived in the Row, and when election
time came round, the boys rustled up
from their dugouts and fired before
the fellows in Toyon or Branner
could slam a door.
Them days are gone forever.
Dark Horse Fair
Like Rosa Bonheur's famous
painting (in the negative) will be
Toyon Lobby tonight. It'll be the
horse fair, but restricted entirely
to dark horses. Ten flat, or sharp, is
the time when Hall politicians, their
roommates and their stooges will
throw the political Broncos, and bull,
without smokes or ice cream, but
with a sure-fire lariat that will get
them a Hall sweep of nominations
tomorrow, possibly the election on
April 13.
Batting against this two-gunned,
two-fisted combine will be a bunch
of Greeks running around with their
tails between their legs.
Row May Split
Sans leaders, sans cauci, sans ev
erything, the Row is liable to find
itself up on top of the proverbial
greased flagpole. Red flag which
may set off a ticklish situation wifh
a loud boom is the threatened split
between Lasuen Powers —Phi Delta
Theta and Zeta Psi.
