# Lost Airliner Searched For At Winslow
## Douglas Plane Reported Seen Flying Low Over Escudilla Mountain 
### 
SPRINGER VILLE, Ariz., April 5
(U.R).â€”Aviators and a posse of lum
berjacks and mountain folk searched
the desolate slopes of Escudilla
mountain tonight for a 21-passenger
Douglas airliner with eight persons
aboard.
The giant craft, en route from
Burbank, Calif., to New York for
consignment to Holland, was last re
ported seen in this rugged area.
A base for searchers was estab
lished at Winslow. Sheriff John
Nunn of Apache County and his
posse threaded their way through
the deep snow of the Escudilla, after
reports came from St. John and Al
pine that the plane had been seen
Saturday flying dangerously low
and apparently in trouble.
The plane, a two-motored trans
port ship with 190-foot wingspread
and capable of a speed of 200 miles
per hour, departed from Burbank
Saturday afternoon and was sched
uled to reach Albuquerque, N.M., the
same day.
Airport officials theorized that
when the plane ran into a heavy
snowstorm and high winds, it veered
south in an attempt to swing outside
the storm. The plane probably was
being flown blind as it left the reg
ular TWA and air commerce bu
reau route.
Two veteran airmen, Glen Moser,
30, chief Douglas pilot, and Joe Nor
folk, 32, co-pilot and navigator, were
at the controls. Six other persons,
mostly airport employees and rela
tives, also were aboard.
Officials held to the hope that Mo
ser brought the ship down on one
of the few level spots of the sterile,
jagged mountains. The ship was
without a transmitter, and could not
send radio messages. Telephones are
far between in the area, and it was
regarded as possible that the plane
might be safe and not yet able to
notify Douglas officials.
A report was received here that
a son of Henry A. McDaniel, ranger
atop the Escudilla, had seen the
plane spiral to the earth about 3:30
p.m. Saturday. The time conformed
with the reports of persons who
said they saw the plane.
