# Hall, Row Leaders Propose New Joint ASSU Ballot Coup
## Franich Suggests "Idealistic Ticket"; Hopkins, Vincenti Antagonistic, Anderson in Favor 
### 
From Stanford's own "back room," Hall and Row bigwigs last night
sought to effect a coup in the current A.S.S.U. election by nominating on
a single ticket candidates from both Row and Hall and thus eliminating
need of election except as formality.
Hall caucus members heard the "idealistic idea"—as its exponents
termed it—presented by Chick Franich. denounced it. heard it nrescntpri

►again; and then went on record with
a 34-31 vote to co-operate with the
Row on such plan when house mem
bers gather at the Chi Psi Lodge at
8 o'clock tonight.
The "idealistic idea" was evolved
at a meeting at the Zete house prior
to the Hall caucus last night, when
leaders of the two factions decided
that only by co-operation between
Hall and Row can men be chosen
who will "give us the best in stu
dent government. We seek to elim
inate the possible defeat of good
men who might be forccd to run
against one another," it was ex
plained.
Franich put the plan to the Hall
caucus: "Now we elect the man who
has the most perfect set of teeth or
can run the mile in 4:17. I'll admit
that it's probably just an idealistic
idea, but it'll give us the best stu
dent government."
From the caucus: Grumbles. "It's
Hilly."
From Franich: "And you prob
ably think I'm a traitor but I'm
really serious. It's a good idea."
From the caucus: Grumbles. "If
we give them the A.S.S.U. president,
who'll we get?"
Franich: "I don't know."
Caucus: "Any iron-clad plan?'
Franich: "No."
Wayne Richardson (from group of
Row men in corner): "Chick and
Joe and I have talked this thing
over and we think that it wouldn't
hurt to try it once, anyway."
Larry Rouble: (booed down).
Jim Ransohoff and Mark Hopkins
wondered in effect: "Do you think
we'll get double-crossed."
This being end of round one, cau
cus members went ahead with nom
inations. Nominations completed.
Bell for round two.
Joe Weiner, Larry Rouble, and
Roy Anderson (in effect): "How can
the Hall get anyone elected if we
don't compromise?"
Caucus: (loud rumbles).
Walt Vincenti: "Why bother with
elections at all if we're going to
do this. Is this Stanford's smoke
filled hotel room?"
Discussion. Five speakers at once.
Stan Zimet pounding for order. Dis
order. More simultaneous speaking.
"God, this is silly." "Forget it, I
think we'll get double-crossed."
Disorder.
Final result (half hour later—bits
of torn hair and flesh on floor). The
Hall votes to send three men from
each hall chosen by the president
to attend Row caucus at Chi Psi
house tonight.

at a meeting at the Zete house prior
to the Hall caucus last night, when
leaders of the two factions decided
that only by co-operation between
Hall and Row can men be chosen
who will "give us the best in stu
dent government. We seek to elim
inate the possible defeat of good
men who might be forccd to run
against one another," it was ex
plained.
Franich put the plan to the Hall
caucus: "Now we elect the man who
has the most perfect set of teeth or
can run the mile in 4:17. I'll admit
that it's probably just an idealistic
idea, but it'll give us the best stu
dent government."
From the caucus: Grumbles. "It's
Hilly."
From Franich: "And you prob
ably think I'm a traitor but I'm
really serious. It's a good idea."
From the caucus: Grumbles. "If
we give them the A.S.S.U. president,
who'll we get?"
Franich: "I don't know."
Caucus: "Any iron-clad plan?'
Franich: "No."
Wayne Richardson (from group of
Row men in corner): "Chick and
Joe and I have talked this thing
over and we think that it wouldn't
hurt to try it once, anyway."
Larry Rouble: (booed down).
Jim Ransohoff and Mark Hopkins
wondered in effect: "Do you think
we'll get double-crossed."
This being end of round one, cau
cus members went ahead with nom
inations. Nominations completed.
Bell for round two.
Joe Weiner, Larry Rouble, and
Roy Anderson (in effect): "How can
the Hall get anyone elected if we
don't compromise?"
Caucus: (loud rumbles).
Walt Vincenti: "Why bother with
elections at all if we're going to
do this. Is this Stanford's smoke
filled hotel room?"
Discussion. Five speakers at once.
Stan Zimet pounding for order. Dis
order. More simultaneous speaking.
"God, this is silly." "Forget it, I
think we'll get double-crossed."
Disorder.
Final result (half hour later—bits
of torn hair and flesh on floor). The
Hall votes to send three men from
each hall chosen by the president
to attend Row caucus at Chi Psi
house tonight.
Intent. To parley for Stanford's
new joint A.S.S.U. ticket.
From Stanford's own "back room," Hall and Row bigwigs last night
sought to effect a coup in the current A.S.S.U. election by nominating on
a single ticket candidates from both Row and Hall and thus eliminating
need of election except as formality.
Hall caucus members heard the "idealistic idea"—as its exponents
termed it—presented by Chick Franich. denounced it. heard it nrescntpri

►again; and then went on record with
a 34-31 vote to co-operate with the
Row on such plan when house mem
bers gather at the Chi Psi Lodge at
8 o'clock tonight.
