# Dern Named Hall Choice For President
## Ransohoff Selected For Senior Head; Klauber Grad Committeeman 
### 
John Dern and Jim Ransohoff,
both El Toros, were named as Hall
choices for A.S.S.U. president and
senior class president, respectively,
in smoke-filled Toyon lobby last
night when Hall politicians stormed
through a two-hour caucus.
Chairmanned by Stan Zimet,
Toyon Hall president, the caucus at
once split into two camps — those
who did and those who did not want
to co-operate with Row leaders for
a United Ticket. Finally, almost at
midnight, the caucus agreed to form
a United Ticket.
Upset Move
But this move came after the en
tire Hall ticket had been drawn up.
Zimet declared that the ticket would
stand unless the candidates them
selves withdrew their nominations.
