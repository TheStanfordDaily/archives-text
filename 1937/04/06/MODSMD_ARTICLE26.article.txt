# Assembly Hall To Retire Grads To Replace Gaieties
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Assembly Hall, one of the oldest
and least respected of Stanford's
landmarks, will have disappeared
when students return to the Farm
next fall if adequate financing has
been provided by the start of sum
mer quarter.
With the opening or the new Me
morial Theater, the antiquated
structure will have finished its pe
riod of usefulness as an auditorium,
and the interior will be torn out to
make room for the new quarters of
the Graduate School of Business.
Whether or not this can be accom
plished during the summer depends
entirely on securing the necessary
funds. The construction will be a
capital expenditure, producing no
revenue, and the Administration
will have to stand the expense. Cost
of the project is being investigated
at present.
Library To Replace Stage
Plans include removal of the bal
cony and replacing it with a second
floor. Offices will surround this
floor, and the central portion under
the present skylight will be occu
pied by the library of the Graduate
School of Business. The upper floor
built over the present stage will
house reserved book reading rooms.
On the ground floor five modern
classrooms will be constructed; one
will have a seating capacity of 160,
one of 120, one of 100, and two of 65.
The rear portion of the floor will be
used by the Department of Indus
trial Relations.
Stacks To Line Wall
Against the east wall of the As-

sembly Hall, next to the Adminis
tration Building, a book stack of six
levels from the present basement to
the roof is planned. It will be en
closed in reenforced concrete walls.
Control will be in the hands of the
librarian of the Graduate School of
Business. The present quarters of
the school in Jordan Hall will prob
ably be turned over to the School of
Biology, which is in need of more
room at present.
