# Heart Attack Kills Grad
## John Tolman, '34, Dies Due to Exposure 
### 
A heart attack brought on by ex
posure and overstrain in one of the
winter's worst snow-storms caused
the death Sunday of John van
Steen Tolman, '34, son of Dr. and
Mrs. Cyrus Fisher Tolman. Dr.
Tolman is a professor of economic
geology here.
Young Tolman, who was super
intendent of the Granite Basin
Mines Corporation, had undergone a
series of hardships in his attempt to
get supplies into a high Sierra mine
during a snowstorm. Tolman and a
companion were successful in
reaching the mine, but the strain
was too much for Tolman, who be
came ill and was carried to an Oro
ville hospital on a sled.
The young geologist was brought
to his parents' home last week, but
a second attack Sunday proved
fatal. Private funeral services will
be held this morning.
Before taking his position with the
mining company, Tolman assisted
his father in the Stanford geology
department.
