### 
A preacher and a doctor were the
publishers of the first paper in Cali
fornia, assistant professor of jour
nalism Clifford F. Weigle said last
evening in tracing California's pio
neer newspapers, as speaker over
the Stanford Radio Hour.
In succession nine other papers
were founded until the robust days
of the 1850's and 18C0's when the
leading San Francisco newspapers,
the Chronicle, the Examiner, the
Call and the Bulletin came into be
ing, the speaker said. Hundreds of
other publicatons were short-lived,
but their names preserve the flavor
of pioneer California.
