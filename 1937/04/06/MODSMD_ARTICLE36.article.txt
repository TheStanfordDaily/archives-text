## O.K., ART, TAKE IT AWAY

Every once in a while a guy thinks
he ought to let somebody else use
his column to say something—more
because he hasn't anything to say
himself than because he wants to be
nice to the guy—but Art Allen
wrote a commentary on baseball
and it looks like good stuff:
"Conference batting averages
released yesterday include de-
Witt, .419; Ilolman, .278; Farrell,
.27(»; Linde, .2(i7; Heagerty, .2:17;
Johnson, .IK2; Hamilton, .178; Kil
lefer, .111: and Tain, .OXO. The team
average is .210. 80 hits in 334 times
at hat during 10 games.
"Three weeks ago, deWitt was
hitting in the ,500's, Heagerty in the
,400 s, and Ilolman over .300. The
slacking off of these batters, not- j
ably Heagerty, who failed to hit in j
19 consecutive times at bat, brought
on the disastrous four-game slump
which threw the Cards back into
fourth place.
"Another orchid should go to
Dick Tain, scrappy University of
Hawaii transfer who is turning in
the best fielding of the season. His
catch behind second on Herzog's
single, and his hcads-up throw to
Farrell saved a sure run in the
eighth inning of Saturday's game
against U»S.C. Two other times he
looked good on double plays as
pivot man. He topped all this off
in the third inning hy recovering
Furman's low throw that escaped
Ilolman to head off the speedy
Trojan Berardino at third with a
beautiful throw across the dia
mond to Linde.
"Furman's double, driving in two i
runs in the fifth inning, was the sec
ond hit of the season for the stout
right-hander and the third of his
intercollegiate career. The Trojans ;
remarked after the game that
"Spike" showed them a new curve
and was mixing them up better than
ever before. Furman now leads the
Stanford mound staff with three j
wins and one loss in league games, i
plus three additional wins in non- j
conference games.
"The Indians can close in on the i
league leaders by wins over the j
Broncos tomorrow at Santa Clara, j
and over the Bears in the series
opener here Saturday. The possi
bilities of the effect of other games
involving California, Southern
California, and U.C.L.A. are in
finite, hut here's one possible set
up which could put the Cards in
front at the end of this week: j
Picture U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Stan
ford knocking over the Bears,
Stanford also taking Santa Clara,
and St. Mary's beating U.S.C.
"This is not too unreasonable, as
Gonzales is the only good U.S.C.'
pitcher and he should beat the
Bears. The Bears will be pointing
for us on Saturday and could lose
to the Bruins on Friday. Stanford,
holding two previous victories over
the Broncos, should repeat."
