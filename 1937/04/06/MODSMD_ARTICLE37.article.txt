Last week-end at Yosemite eight
Stanford fellows got together for
;:ome fun on skis, and the frolic was
so much fun they decided that they
oughl to organize a Stanford Ski
Club.
The idea was fine, except that it
was a little late. At any rate, it
served to show just how many peo
ple know that there is such a thing
as a ski club at Sanford. And all
thin, even though Stanford's "skiers
took second place in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegaites at Mt. Rainier
a couple of weeks ago.
To right this wrong, and to make
the Stanford Ski Club an honest-to
gosh organization, a bunch of the
boys are having a meeting tonight
in Room 283, with pictures. It's for
everybody who wants-to ski, and
1 hey're Irying to get a large sign-up
for a \osemite trip this week-end.
