# Band Wagon Passengers
## 
### 
SENIOR Class President Mort D'Evelyn writes
his own defense today against the accusa
tions of "politics" and "railroading" that have
been crescendoed from a murmuring glissando
to a roaring forte since the beginning of the
school year.
Mort's defense is a de facto justication of
specific actions.
The defense might go deeper than that. But
it cannot come from Mort, because it would be
bad taste for him to expose the technique of
managing 1000 people.
But it can come from others, who might re
sent certain of Mort's specific actions, say his
favoring of fraternity brothers, but who can
look ahead and see as a result of so-called "rail
roading" and "politics" one of the most effec
tive senior class programs within student body
memory. ,
So far, the articulated complaints have not
been roars but buzzes—suspiciously like an
axe-blade on a whetstone.
"Just a passenger," whose complaint in Cam
pus Opinion yesterday is the first written in
dictment of D'Evelyn, was not handing down
an unencumbered judgment. He was far more
incensed over the conflict of dates between his
own house dance and the Senior Prom this Fri
day than he was over the alleged offenses of
D'Evelyn against a "representative body poli
tic."
And so we can discount his complaint. But
there are others. There are those who fire the
charge of high-handedness, still others who
object to what they believe is dictatorship.
They indicate they would be far more satis
fied with a poor senior program than with one
highly organized, completely effective, but
popularly unpopular.
In short, there are many seniors, possibly the
majority of the class, who don't care how badly
a thing is done as long as they have had a hand
in the doing. It's characteristic of those who
think that Democracy confers not only authority
but ability upon its believers.
Mort could have held cumbersome senior
class meetings so everyone could talk and say
nothing. He could have chased around the
campus asking people whether he should sign
Dorsey, whether programs should be pink or
brown, whether the Senior Prom should be
now or then. But he didn't. The result is the
Senior Class will dance to a name orchestra
at a remarkably low price.
Perhaps only the Sigma Chi's had a hand in
the doing of it. Perhaps Mort didn't even con
sult them. But the fact remains that the Senior
Class is getting things done.
If that is a band wagon, let me be "just a
passenger."

campus asking people whether he should sign
Dorsey, whether programs should be pink or
brown, whether the Senior Prom should be
now or then. But he didn't. The result is the
Senior Class will dance to a name orchestra
at a remarkably low price.
Perhaps only the Sigma Chi's had a hand in
the doing of it. Perhaps Mort didn't even con
sult them. But the fact remains that the Senior
Class is getting things done.
If that is a band wagon, let me be "just a
passenger."
SENIOR Class President Mort D'Evelyn writes
his own defense today against the accusa
tions of "politics" and "railroading" that have
been crescendoed from a murmuring glissando
to a roaring forte since the beginning of the
school year.
Mort's defense is a de facto justication of
specific actions.
The defense might go deeper than that. But
it cannot come from Mort, because it would be
bad taste for him to expose the technique of
managing 1000 people.
But it can come from others, who might re
sent certain of Mort's specific actions, say his
favoring of fraternity brothers, but who can
look ahead and see as a result of so-called "rail
roading" and "politics" one of the most effec
tive senior class programs within student body
memory. ,
So far, the articulated complaints have not
been roars but buzzes—suspiciously like an
axe-blade on a whetstone.
"Just a passenger," whose complaint in Cam
pus Opinion yesterday is the first written in
dictment of D'Evelyn, was not handing down
an unencumbered judgment. He was far more
incensed over the conflict of dates between his
own house dance and the Senior Prom this Fri
day than he was over the alleged offenses of
D'Evelyn against a "representative body poli
tic."
And so we can discount his complaint. But
there are others. There are those who fire the
charge of high-handedness, still others who
object to what they believe is dictatorship.
They indicate they would be far more satis
fied with a poor senior program than with one
highly organized, completely effective, but
popularly unpopular.
In short, there are many seniors, possibly the
majority of the class, who don't care how badly
a thing is done as long as they have had a hand
in the doing. It's characteristic of those who
think that Democracy confers not only authority
but ability upon its believers.
Mort could have held cumbersome senior
class meetings so everyone could talk and say
nothing. He could have chased around the
campus asking people whether he should sign
Dorsey, whether programs should be pink or
brown, whether the Senior Prom should be
now or then. But he didn't. The result is the
Senior Class will dance to a name orchestra
at a remarkably low price.
