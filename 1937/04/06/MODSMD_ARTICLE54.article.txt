# Let There Be Light
## 
### 
NEWSPAPERS are searchlights. As on the
atrical first nights, they sweep back and
forth across the fields of public endeavor. Un
like first nights, they don't swing aimlessly.
And they don't always spot the right thing, with
the right light, at the right time.
Some institutions send out publicity techni
cians to turn the spotlight on themselves and
when the light swings they bask in the glare,
behind their most attractive mask. This is good
business.
Stanford, however, has never sought manu
ally to turn the light toward Stanford because
Stanford has preferred that its own magnetism
draw the beam. And Stanford has, in large
measure, succeeded in staying well out of the
shadows if not in the glare.
But every once in a while someone turns the
wrong colored light on Stanford and the very
foundations of the Ad Building shake while the
fight goes on against "unfavorable publicity."
If Stanford were a public institution, the long
arm of the political machine might reach out
and turn off the light. But Stanford isn't.
And the light glares.
There is one good way of avoiding "unfavor
able publicity." Don't try to turn off the un
wanted light but diffuse it, dwarf it beneath a
powerfully favorable beam that spots, un
masked, the great good of this institution.
Don't use the conventional white light of
cheap publicity, but put Stanford and the "idea
of Stanford" under the complimentary rays of
a quiet but constant beam.
This is not meant to apply to the athletic situ
ation. Publicity Director Don Liebendorfer has
handled that well enough to make Stanford's
teams the chief missionaries of its name.
But academically Stanford has much to publi
cize. In labs buried under the Quad, in se
cluded studies great scientists and thinkers are
mixing the compounds that tomorrow will be
ingredients of a new age. Occasional news of
Ilioir progress trickles into the searchlights, but

not because Stanford helps. The lights strike
accidentally.
As in its athletics, Stanford should take steps
to lead the searchlights into its unpublicized
corners, drown out unfavorable beams, put the
spirit of Stanford under this magic ray.â€”G. F.
