# Contacts Over Coffee

This editorial from the Minnesota Daily
explains a student-faculty contact hour, the
model for one that Stanford's Student-Faculty
Committee plans to inaugurate upon comple
tion of the Union Nitery.—The Editor
Between the lunch and the dinnertime,
When classes begin to get sour,
Comes a pause in the day's occupation
That is known as the coffee hour.
Or rather, that will be known as the coffee
hour if University students take advantage of
the opportunity which the Union is offering
from 3:30 to 4:30 Wednesday afternoons. While
they sip coffee "on the house," they can talk
social security with Professor Christensen, cur
rent affairs with Dr. Casey or plays and movies
with Dr. Bryngelson. It's informal and friendly
and a first-rate opportunity to make the faculty
aware of your existence if you've ever thought
that they weren't.
More than that, it represents a possible nu
cleus for the discussion groups which form so
valuable a part of Oxford's educational system.
President Coffman has expressed a desire to
bring great minds to the campus so that stu
dents might gain by association with them. The
Union's coffee hours deserve support as an
effort to promote students' contacts with the
great minds already here.
