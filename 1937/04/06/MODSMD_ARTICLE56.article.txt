# OUR HASHER
## OUT TO LUNCH: BACK SOON 
### 
out near Beltramo's there is a place
called Menlo Park, and somewhere within the city
limits of Menlo Park there is the Octopus, the Bullet,
the Whip, an opium den, and Zorita the Queen of the
Nudists. Some people like to ride on the Octopus,
the Bullet, and the Whip, but people just sit and
watch Zorita, who is a queen in every incense of the
word.
For a small couvert charge of 25 cents you can
usually see Zorita and her three friends dance under
wraps. For 50 cents more uncouvert charge you usually
can stay for the gigantic and mammoth wild west
show where Zorita dances unenwrapturously. This
adds up to a total of 75 cents just for the pleasure of
seeing Zorita standing there in an extremely decollete
sportswear ensemble.
But Saturday night, the enterprising manager wig
gled his laws of supply and demand and upped the
unenwrapped-as-a-gift total to one dollar, little or no
tax.
Saturday night, Zorita danced to the tune of "Come
Join the Band."
This, however, did not include LIFE at the charter
subscription rate.
i "|NE of Stanford's uncertain students, who has pro
vided a lot of copy for this column in his time,
took a highly-favored brunette to the show Sunday
night and right in the midst of Bert Lahr discovered
that he had an appointment to wash his hands and
comb his hair and subsequently excused himself.
While he was gone, another uncertain student who
highly-favored the brunette entered the flicker pal
ace, espied her sitting there in the dark, and moved
into the vacant scat.
Even though there isn't any more plugging to do
on the anthology, Our Hasher will continue to talk
about himself by announcing that during the rest of
the quarter he will go on the three-day week, some
what necessitated by the fact that. Our Hasher is
spending two days of the week in the city on field
trips for a course in the Biz School: Dance Committees
Their Care and Cure, dhur. So from henceforth
there'll be no more Hash columns on Wednesdays
and Fridays.
