# BULL SESSION
## CARNIVAL 
### 
|>EMEMBERED by most rheumy-eyed oldsters is
♦he day when the skirl of a calliope was the Vic
torian Dorsey brass section, and circus sawdust, the
luxurious Axminster of America's outdoor movie
palace.
While the lights of the tent show may have been
dimmed by jittering neon there's still a secret to the
charm of Mme. Circus that no movie blonde has
learned.
The proof was the success of the soiled tent show
that huddled itself on Menlo's main drag last week,
though it was obviously being blown about by the
blasts of Hollywood. Stanford joined with the people
outside for the kind of good time that knows neither
age nor background.
♦ * « Hi
The fact that the tent shows and the amusement de
vices both human and mechanical pandered to a Holly
wood trained taste made surprisingly little dent in the
basic appeal of sawdust, bad sign painting, the smell
of hamburgers, and the nasal lure of the barkers.
And the fact that it w sa apathetic remnant of the #
days when Circus was King inspired a sympathy and
an enthusiasm rather than disgust and contempt.
For there was no question that the Carnival's days
are numbered. The attractions were the warmed-over
cast-offs of circuses. The costumes were dirty, the
talent was of a kind that simply can't last in an age
of 32-frames-sound-on-film.
* * * *
But those who went to it had what might be called
a valid good time. They didn't enjoy the picturesquc
ness of a tent-show, nor did they comment super
ciliously on the sucker bait to get your dime "for the
last show, starting right away."
Which is an indication that there is some life, if
not in the old girl, at least in her soul.
She was courageous, setting herself up right across
the street from a movie house and amazingly enough,
from all indications, it was the movie house that
suffered.
The movies can't learn the circus lesson. For the
little house in Menlo isn't an identity with the enter
tainment it provides, not can it ever be. P.E,
