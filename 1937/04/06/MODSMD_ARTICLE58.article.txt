# French Actor Scores Hit In Movie Comedy
## 
### 
"KING AND THE CHORUS GIRL,"
at the Stanford Theater.
A good story well done, "The
King and the Chorus Girl" is one
of the outstanding comedy hits of
the season. Ex-king Albert Bruger
(Fernand Gravet) does nothing but
sleep and drink, never sees the light
of day. When he wakes up every
night or so, the king goes to the
Follies Bergere, where he enjoys
more sleep. The ex-chancellor (Ed
ward Everett Horton) and Countess
Anna (Mary Nash) find a way to
pull Albert out of the hole. They
light on a chorus girl from the Fol
lies (Joan Blondell), get her to lead
the ex-king on, only to resist him.
The rest of the picture develops this
idea, ending with the king and the
chorus girl finding they are really in
love with each other and getting
married.
However simple the plot may
sound, it is carried out with a per
fection that makes for swift, amus
ing entertainment.
The new French actor, Fernand
Gravet, though no Gable or Taylor,
is quite attractive; looks very much
like ex-King Edward of England.
His characterization of ex-King Al
bert Bruger VII is excellent.
Joan Blondell and Ed Horton are
the same as usual, but are still quite
amusing. Alan Mowbray gives a fine
performance as Blondell's pseudo
fiance, and provides many amusing
scenes.
One of the best shots of the pic
ture: An ocean liner under Niagara
Falls.
All in all, "The King and the Chor
us Girl" is a picture well worth
seeing.
THE PLOUGH AND THE STARS
Though nothing exceptional even
as a historical portrayal of the Irish
Rebellion, "The Plough and the
Stars" contains some excellent act
ing by such top-notchers as Bar
bara Stanwyck, Preston Foster, and
Una O'Connor, despite a more or
less repulsive note sounded by
Stanwyck's husky, scratchy voice.
The plot is nothing much; depends
too much on the acting of the cast.
There are some good scenes, but
nothing exceptional. The Plough
and the Stars" will prove fairly bor
ing to the average cinema goer, but
should be entertaining to those few
lovers of the double bill.

too much on the acting of the cast.
There are some good scenes, but
nothing exceptional. The Plough

should be entertaining to those few

"KING AND THE CHORUS GIRL,"
at the Stanford Theater.
A good story well done, "The
King and the Chorus Girl" is one
of the outstanding comedy hits of
the season. Ex-king Albert Bruger
(Fernand Gravet) does nothing but
sleep and drink, never sees the light
of day. When he wakes up every
night or so, the king goes to the
Follies Bergere, where he enjoys
more sleep. The ex-chancellor (Ed
ward Everett Horton) and Countess
Anna (Mary Nash) find a way to
pull Albert out of the hole. They
light on a chorus girl from the Fol
lies (Joan Blondell), get her to lead
the ex-king on, only to resist him.
The rest of the picture develops this
idea, ending with the king and the
chorus girl finding they are really in
love with each other and getting
married.
However simple the plot may
sound, it is carried out with a per
fection that makes for swift, amus
ing entertainment.
The new French actor, Fernand
Gravet, though no Gable or Taylor,
is quite attractive; looks very much
like ex-King Edward of England.
His characterization of ex-King Al
bert Bruger VII is excellent.
Joan Blondell and Ed Horton are
the same as usual, but are still quite
amusing. Alan Mowbray gives a fine
performance as Blondell's pseudo
fiance, and provides many amusing
scenes.
One of the best shots of the pic
ture: An ocean liner under Niagara
Falls.
All in all, "The King and the Chor
us Girl" is a picture well worth
seeing.
THE PLOUGH AND THE STARS
Though nothing exceptional even
as a historical portrayal of the Irish
Rebellion, "The Plough and the
Stars" contains some excellent act
ing by such top-notchers as Bar
bara Stanwyck, Preston Foster, and
Una O'Connor, despite a more or
less repulsive note sounded by
Stanwyck's husky, scratchy voice.
The plot is nothing much; depends
too much on the acting of the cast.
There are some good scenes, but
nothing exceptional. The Plough
and the Stars" will prove fairly bor
ing to the average cinema goer, but
should be entertaining to those few
lovers of the double bill.
