# CAMPUS OPINION
## SENIOR REPLIES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the author, vvho v.'i.shes
to remain anonymous, of yesterday's
campus opinion, may I express my
sincere regrets that the Senior Prom
falls on the date of your house
formal, that it was not to
schedule the Prom early enough to
prevent that conflict of dates. Ap
proval by A.S.S.U. authorities of the
April 9 date for the Prom was gained
at the close of last quarter and vio
lated no rulings.
Those who expressed an opinion
on the Senior Prom last fall stated
that it was a flop as traditionally
held, that there was no use having
one unless it was going to be good,
that a dance early in the spring
quarter might be valuable to get the
members of the class better ac
quainted. I personally carried on

I the negotiations to obtain Jimmy
i Dorsey—if that explains the "odor"
! mentioned because of the rapid ac
j tion of the social commitee. The
deal was not definite until last Tues
day, and that the Prom was an
; nounced that night. Further on the
I "odor," the class will pay $400 less
for Dorsey for the Senior Prom than
they did last year for the Junior
Prom.
Concerning the probably much
more important accusation of "rail
roading" I will let the record of the
j committee stand in defense of their
chairmen and members. Criticism,
as by the author of yesterday's
campus opinion, is welcome and ex
j pected. I trust that no small part of
j this revived interest in class affairs
I can be turned into constructive
I action.
Sincerely,
Mort D'Evelyn
