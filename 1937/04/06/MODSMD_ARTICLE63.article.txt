### 
E. P. Hunt, associate professor of
physical education, will speak to
night on "The Land of thtf Navajo,"
in the Assembly Hall at 7:30.
Mr. Hunt will supplement his talk
with colored movies which he took J
himself on the Navajo reservation in |
the southwest during the last four I
years. The pictures were made on !
trips totaling over 3500 miles, and :
show the everyday life of the In- ;
dians and the country in which they
live. Tribal customs and ceremonies
will also be illustrated.
Included among the pictures are
some taken during a 200-mile trip
which Mr. Hunt made down the San .
Juan and Colorado Rivers in an j
open boat. Other pictures give un- j
usual shots of the famous Rainbow j
natural bridge. A commercial firm j
is now making copies of some of the ;
pictures for rental distribution in J
the East.
