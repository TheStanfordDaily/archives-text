WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP).â€”
The Supreme Court completed read
ing its opinions today without pre
senting its expected decision in the
five test cases on the Wagner Labor
Relations Act. Next Monday now is
I the earliest possible date for a rul-
I ing.
Today it refused to interfere with
] an injunction restraining the Geor
gia Power Company from prosecut
j ing a suit against the Tennessee Val
j ley Authority.
It refused, as it has several times
| in the past, to hear a request for an
! injunction against a National Labor
j Relations Board hearing.
It declined a new test of the Mu
nicipal Bankruptcy Law, outlawed
in a court decision last year.
