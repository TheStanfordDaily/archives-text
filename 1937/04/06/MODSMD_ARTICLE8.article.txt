# Novel Races Planned For Water Fete
## 
### 
Hall and Row residents alike will
soon be transforming scows, barges,
and rafts into ornate floats, and a
host of hopeful aquatic performers
will be turning out for daily practice
drills. Such activity as this was
foreshadowed at least when Chair
man Bud Milligan held a confab
with his aides yesterday and made
tentative plans for the annual Jun
ior Water Carnival, to be staged on
Lagunita Friday afternoon, April 23.
Competition Awards
Although he emphasized the fact
that competitive events were any
thing but definitely scheduled yet,
Publicity Chairman Don Douglas
said that many of last year's Car
nival features would again be used.
Silver cups will be awarded win
ning groups in the float competition
and other desirable prizes will be
offered individual victors in the
many sporting events.
Included in the group of contests
likely to be held are the following:
100-yard free-style swimming race
for men; canoe jousting; tandem
raceâ€”wherein a team of two men,
their ankles bound together, will
make their way through the water
for a distance of 50 yards; and men's
canoe race, which will require con
testants to swim to their boats and
then paddle around the lake ance.
Nightgown Race for Men
Women will probably compete in
another 100-yard free-style contest,
a nightgown relay race, canoe bob
bing, and an inner-tube race. A
four-woman team will be required
in the nightgown relay; one night
gown, with sleeves, will be passed
from one swimmer to another, who
must don the gown in order to
continue thp race.
Entry lists, for either the float or
sports events, will in all probability
be kept open until Thursday, April
22, if the custom of previous years
prevails.
