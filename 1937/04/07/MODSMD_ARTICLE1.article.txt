# There's Censorship Still! Why Have Censorship Again?

VC/ITH a tenacity of purpose more
admirable than its aim, cer
tain feminine campus political lead
ers attempted last night to gun for
control over the Daily.
Their action was not unexpected.
For the past two weeks they have
indicated to this paper an attempt to
go beyond legal punitive measures,
to torture and embarrass, as well as
to mete out penalties within the
moral law.
Their attempt last night tipped
over their apple cart. Public rec
ognition of that fact may tip over
ours. But silence is impossible in
the face of an attempt not un
touched by a certain malice.
The observation is inescapable,
and rests upon the Daily as an ob
ligation, that their proposal would
have placed this newspaper partially
under the power of a body which
could at some future date exercise
control over what the Daily can
print. That control, would, further
more, have been direct, inescapable
and absolute.
Seeks Impossible Control
Perhaps more typical of male pol
iticians than female is this type of
attempt. It seeks to put into blunt
black and white an instrument of
control over not only factual state
ments, but confusing innuendoes of
printed English.
That is impossible, and it will be
impossible so long as the English
language, full of innuendoes and
subtle meanings, continues to be
the medium of communication.
And such attempts are entirely
unnecessary at Stanford. In any
popularly - constituted govern
ment there are checks against the
newspaper far more powerful than
any existing on the statute books.
It would have been more typical
of the women campus leaders to
rely upon the subtle means of con
trol that exists above the law, rather
than to attempt to put the "unput
table" in black and white.
Such a move, which would have
been no move at all, would have
been more in keeping with the ex
quisite subtlety of their opera
tions until last night. It would
have done credit to their previous
artful procedure, much more like
that of a medieval Inquisitor than
like that of a lawyer or judge,
who sentences, convicts, punishes,
and calls quits.
We are surprised that they have
forgotten that the censorship of so
ciety is always stronger than the
censorship of a group or the censor
ship of the written law.
We are surprised to think they
would expose themselves, as they
did last night, to an insight into
their viewpoint. —B. E.

The observation is inescapable,
and rests upon the Daily as an ob
ligation, that their proposal would
have placed this newspaper partially
under the power of a body which
could at some future date exercise
control over what the Daily can
print. That control, would, further
more, have been direct, inescapable
and absolute.
Seeks Impossible Control
Perhaps more typical of male pol
iticians than female is this type of
attempt. It seeks to put into blunt
black and white an instrument of
control over not only factual state
ments, but confusing innuendoes of
printed English.
That is impossible, and it will be
impossible so long as the English
language, full of innuendoes and
subtle meanings, continues to be
the medium of communication.
And such attempts are entirely
unnecessary at Stanford. In any
popularly - constituted govern
ment there are checks against the
newspaper far more powerful than
any existing on the statute books.
It would have been more typical
of the women campus leaders to
rely upon the subtle means of con
trol that exists above the law, rather
than to attempt to put the "unput
table" in black and white.
Such a move, which would have
been no move at all, would have
been more in keeping with the ex
quisite subtlety of their opera
tions until last night. It would
have done credit to their previous
artful procedure, much more like
that of a medieval Inquisitor than
like that of a lawyer or judge,
who sentences, convicts, punishes,
and calls quits.
We are surprised that they have
forgotten that the censorship of so
ciety is always stronger than the
censorship of a group or the censor
ship of the written law.
We are surprised to think they
would expose themselves, as they
did last night, to an insight into
their viewpoint. —B. E.
VC/ITH a tenacity of purpose more
admirable than its aim, cer
tain feminine campus political lead
ers attempted last night to gun for
control over the Daily.
Their action was not unexpected.
For the past two weeks they have
indicated to this paper an attempt to
go beyond legal punitive measures,
to torture and embarrass, as well as
to mete out penalties within the
moral law.
Their attempt last night tipped
over their apple cart. Public rec
ognition of that fact may tip over
ours. But silence is impossible in
the face of an attempt not un
touched by a certain malice.
The observation is inescapable,
and rests upon the Daily as an ob
ligation, that their proposal would
have placed this newspaper partially
under the power of a body which
could at some future date exercise
control over what the Daily can
print. That control, would, further
