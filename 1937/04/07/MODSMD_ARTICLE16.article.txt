# Thief Suspect Will Face Trial
## Burglar May Be Member Of College Loot Ring 
### 
John T. Cynko, arrested here last
week by campus police, and sus
pected of being connected with re
cent fraternity and track equipment
burglaries at Stanford, is being held
for trial in Santa Clara. He is also
being charged with similar thefts
which were committed at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara in the middle
of March.
At the same time, local authorities
are waiting to hear from the chief of
police of Pasadena, where Cynko
is wanted in connection with thefts
in Tournament Park there. A U.S.C.
Trojan key found in his possession
seems to link him with those bur
glaries.
Further developments were seen
in the communications of Berkeley
police with the campus force in rela
tion to Donald Doran, 23, who was
arrested in San Fronciseo the day
before yesterday. Doran was at
tempting to pawn a number of fra
ternity pins, and is believed respon
sible for nine fraternity burglaries
at the University of California. He is
also thought to be either a partner
of Cynko, or part of a professional
gang of fraternity robbers.
Local police are going to Berkeley
Thursday to check with authorities
there concerning the two suspects.
