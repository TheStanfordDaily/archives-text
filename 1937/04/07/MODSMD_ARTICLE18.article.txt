# Row Back Room Kills Coalition Plan
## Killefer Named By Greek Caucus For ASSU Head Choose McRoskey Senior President, Garretson Ex Committeeman; Pick Women Nominees 
### 
Swept swiftly out of the Stanford politician back-door by a half-dozen
bigwig brooms yesterday afternoon, the "idealistic idea" for a joint Row-
Hull ballot failed to make appearance at the official Row caucus in the
Chi Psi Lodge last night.
Row leaders of the "idealistic" move gave their reason: "We had
everything lo lose." Hall leaders felt that it probably "wouldn't work."

► Meanwhile, the Row caucus
plunged into its business of nom
inating, after first agreeing to stand
behind various class caucuses from
the Row in their selections.
Fire spurted from big guns as
Zcte Tom Killefer took a one-vote
victory over Phi Delt Bob Mcßos

nomination. The tally was 16-15.
More fire spurted as Hank Lui
setti opposed Mcßoskey for the sen
ior class president nomination. Mc-
Roskey was withdrawn, giving Lui
setti the nomination on a white bal
lot., but later a motion to reopen
nominations won by four votes, and
Mcßoskey was renominated. The
final vote: Mcßoskey 17, Luisetti
15.

Swept swiftly out of the Stanford politician back-door by a half-dozen
bigwig brooms yesterday afternoon, the "idealistic idea" for a joint Row-
Hull ballot failed to make appearance at the official Row caucus in the
Chi Psi Lodge last night.
Row leaders of the "idealistic" move gave their reason: "We had
everything lo lose." Hall leaders felt that it probably "wouldn't work."

► Meanwhile, the Row caucus
plunged into its business of nom
inating, after first agreeing to stand
behind various class caucuses from
the Row in their selections.
Fire spurted from big guns as
Zcte Tom Killefer took a one-vote
