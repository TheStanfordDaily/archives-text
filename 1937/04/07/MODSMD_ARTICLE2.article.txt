being followed in the construction
of his new home, Professor Paul R.
Hanna will discuss "The New Archi

ganizer and sponsor of the Lunch
eon Club, in relation to Professor
Hanna's subject, "What is the new
concept of functional and organic
architecture? Many have wanted to
understand the basic idea which
Professor Hanna is following in his
new home, of which Frank Lloyd
Wright is the architect."

Club, and will be held in the lounge
of the Women's Clubhouse from 12
