# Novel Carnival Booths Planned
## Hens To Scramble Eggs Over Beta Neophytes 
### 
A big red hen will drop raw eggs
on the heads of Beta Theta Pi
pledges at the Sophomore Carnival
Saturday night, announced Chair
mar. Hap Dey last night after ap
proval of several new concessions.
The chicken will be rigged up to lay
eggs when a customer hits the tar
get.
Roulette wheels will whirl out the
fate of Stanford philanthropists at
the Alpha Tau Omega booth, while
Theta Chi will award prizes through
the medium of darts and a num
bered board.
Pi Phi awards will go to those who
can send a basketball repeatedly
through the net. Baseball throwers
will try their skill in knocking over
milk bottles at the Chi Omega
booth.
Wild ducks will wobble busily
about dodging hoops, and anyone
who rings a neck gets a duck. The
Kappa Kappa Gammas, who are
sponsoring the concession, promise
that the hoops are light and "will
not hurt the poor things."
Targets for gunmen at the Delta
Upsilon booth will include not only
bottles but also swinging light bulbs
and other moving objects, according
to Chairman Peter Fay. Los Arcos,
the first eating club to turn in plans
for a concession, will sponsor a
Wheel of Fortune to be run on the
order of a Chuck-a-Luck game.
Chairman Dey declared all con
cessions must be announced by to
morrow night. Carnival committee
will meet tonight at 7:30.
