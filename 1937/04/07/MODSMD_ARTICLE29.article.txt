# Second String Poloists Start Against Utah
## Indian Riders Prepare To Take Series as Wet Field Slows Workouts 
### 
Card second team polo members
get their big chance today at 3:00
o'clock on the highway field when
Ihey open the two-game series to be
played with University of Utah.
Captain Grubbs, Card mentor, has
been grooming his charges on the
soggy fields to get them used to the
conditions under which the matches
will probably be played.
Indian hopes are high as team
work smooths out with the progress
ing season and if all goes well third
string members will also see action;
however, just in case, the first team
will be on hand.
The starting line-up for the Cards
will probably be composed of Bert
Hyde, No. 1; Don McAusland, No. 2;
Bob Wallace, No. 3; and Bert Mc-
Clintock, No. 4. University of Utah
trip members are Ted Cannon, No.
1; Dick Williams, No. 2; John Lowe,
No. 3; C. H. Wilken, No. 4; and Von
Moss and Von Cannon, substitutes.
The second and final game of the
series will be played off Friday at
the same time and place. Admission
to both games is free to the public.
