I WHAT Din I
I TELL YOU. JOE
Joe Weiner has been kidding me
I and I've been kidding him for a
couple of weeks about his getting a
write-up in the Daily some time,
i Now, Joe is a bright and smiling
j feller, a suave diplomat and a pal
of everybody from the Union hash -
| ers to the toughest rough you can
| find on the Farm.
And so when Joe goes by me and
' turns on that dazzling smile—Ol'
Sunshine Joe—l think that maybe
Joe needs a write-up and so I does
this little thing for Joe, just like
J any pal would. Ain't that right,
j Joe?
IS' FUNNY,
| ISN'T IT?
This University of Utah polo team
| that plays the Farm four this after
noon is known as the "Redskin," just
i like Stanford. You see, they have
i Indians in Utah, too.
| WHERE'S
! HELPER?
I Speaking of Indians reminds of
that good old phrase, "The Vanish
-1 ing Americans," which in turn re
minds of a little vanishing act be
ing pulled over at California.
Before the track season started,
Jim Helmer was right behind Archie
Williams in the quarter mile, he was
j being depended upon by Brutus
j Hamilton to bring in some points
{ with seconds and thirds in dual
i meets this year.
Monday the official entry list for
1 the Cal-Trojan meet at Los Angeles
I this Saturday was released, and in it
| was some sad news. Helmer is left
j completely out of the 440, with Wil-
J liams, Charles Miller, Don Watts,
; Frank Cleary, and, of all people, Bob
Heavey, entered as possible contest-
I ants.
Helmer, bless his heart, isn't be-
I ing left completely out of the meet, i
No, he is listed sixth of eight en
trants in the relay, preceded by
Louis Hubbard, Greg Stout, Miller,
Williams, Elton Weiman, and fol
lowed by Watts and Cleary.
Ah, well, time, tide, and better
quarter-milers don't wait for the
guy that can't catch up.
ALSO TOUGH
FOR DINK
Washington will step into Bay Re
gion athletics onee again when the j
Husky track team comes to the :
Farm Saturday, and while Stanford i
should rate the favorite spot over j
the northernex's, they're liable to |
give Dink's men a track meet.
Cal defeated them 73-58 in an in
door meet at Washington, but since
that* meet the Huskies have recov
ered Ait Morgan, ace hurdler, and
Dave Maginnis, two-miler, from the
injury list. With these additions
they figure to be much stronger, so
Dink's squad will have more than
mediocre competition Saturday.

I HE WONT
COME BACK
To ciean up this Myron Schall
| boxing coach situation once and for
I all, may it be said that Schall has
! a job now that looks pretty good to
j him, he is quite satisfied, and so
| Stanford is just out of luck as far as
| getting his services are concerned.
He started the first of this month
!as athletic director of the Sacra
i mento Elks Club gymnasium and
pool, reputedly the best athletic
layout in town. It's the Elks' good
1 luck. Stanford's bad luck, but let's
let it go at that.
For you who still think that we
ought to have a new boxing coach,
keep your shirts on, maybe some
thing will come up yet.
John Priddle is trying to give var
sity boxing prospects a few point
ers Friday afternoons, at 5 o'clock,
in an attempt to give them a head
start for the season which opens in
the fall.
He has plenty of candidates for the
heavier weights, although he would
like some more if they want to come
out, but his main yearning goes for
119, 129, and 139 - pounders. It
seems there is a scarcity of little
guys that want to fight, outside of
those who were around for the past
season, and John wants to have some
more out for the fight game on the
Farm.
Any fellows that want to do a
little boxing can just drop around
to the boxing room Friday afternoon
around 5:00, and John will be glad
to have you.
SO
THERE!
A certain San Francisco sports
reporter said yesterday that Hank
Luisetti definitely had signed up
with Dink Templeton to high jump
this season.
Well, get this, Rosenbaum. Lui
setti didn't sign up, he didn't come
out to practice yesterday, and he
doesn't know yet whether he is
.going to come out. Well, we all
make mistakes.

Cal defeated them 73-58 in an in
door meet at Washington, but since
that* meet the Huskies have recov
ered Ait Morgan, ace hurdler, and
Dave Maginnis, two-miler, from the
injury list. With these additions
they figure to be much stronger, so
Dink's squad will have more than
mediocre competition Saturday.

I HE WONT
COME BACK
To ciean up this Myron Schall
| boxing coach situation once and for
I all, may it be said that Schall has
! a job now that looks pretty good to
j him, he is quite satisfied, and so
| Stanford is just out of luck as far as
| getting his services are concerned.
He started the first of this month
!as athletic director of the Sacra
i mento Elks Club gymnasium and
pool, reputedly the best athletic
layout in town. It's the Elks' good
1 luck. Stanford's bad luck, but let's
let it go at that.
For you who still think that we
ought to have a new boxing coach,
keep your shirts on, maybe some
thing will come up yet.
John Priddle is trying to give var
sity boxing prospects a few point
ers Friday afternoons, at 5 o'clock,
in an attempt to give them a head
start for the season which opens in
the fall.
He has plenty of candidates for the
heavier weights, although he would
like some more if they want to come
out, but his main yearning goes for
119, 129, and 139 - pounders. It
seems there is a scarcity of little
guys that want to fight, outside of
those who were around for the past
season, and John wants to have some
more out for the fight game on the
Farm.
Any fellows that want to do a
little boxing can just drop around
to the boxing room Friday afternoon
around 5:00, and John will be glad
to have you.
SO
THERE!
A certain San Francisco sports
reporter said yesterday that Hank
Luisetti definitely had signed up
with Dink Templeton to high jump
this season.
Well, get this, Rosenbaum. Lui
setti didn't sign up, he didn't come
out to practice yesterday, and he
doesn't know yet whether he is
.going to come out. Well, we all
make mistakes.

I WHAT Din I
I TELL YOU. JOE
Joe Weiner has been kidding me
I and I've been kidding him for a
couple of weeks about his getting a
write-up in the Daily some time,
i Now, Joe is a bright and smiling
j feller, a suave diplomat and a pal
of everybody from the Union hash -
| ers to the toughest rough you can
| find on the Farm.
And so when Joe goes by me and
' turns on that dazzling smile—Ol'
Sunshine Joe—l think that maybe
Joe needs a write-up and so I does
this little thing for Joe, just like
J any pal would. Ain't that right,
j Joe?
IS' FUNNY,
| ISN'T IT?
This University of Utah polo team
| that plays the Farm four this after
noon is known as the "Redskin," just
i like Stanford. You see, they have
i Indians in Utah, too.
| WHERE'S
! HELPER?
I Speaking of Indians reminds of
that good old phrase, "The Vanish
-1 ing Americans," which in turn re
minds of a little vanishing act be
ing pulled over at California.
Before the track season started,
Jim Helmer was right behind Archie

{ with seconds and thirds in dual

1 the Cal-Trojan meet at Los Angeles
I this Saturday was released, and in it

couple of weeks about his getting a
write-up in the Daily some time,
i Now, Joe is a bright and smiling
j feller, a suave diplomat and a pal
of everybody from the Union hash -
| ers to the toughest rough you can
| find on the Farm.
And so when Joe goes by me and
' turns on that dazzling smile—Ol'
Sunshine Joe—l think that maybe
Joe needs a write-up and so I does
this little thing for Joe, just like
J any pal would. Ain't that right,
j Joe?
IS' FUNNY,
| ISN'T IT?
This University of Utah polo team
| that plays the Farm four this after
noon is known as the "Redskin," just
i like Stanford. You see, they have
i Indians in Utah, too.
| WHERE'S
! HELPER?
I Speaking of Indians reminds of
that good old phrase, "The Vanish
-1 ing Americans," which in turn re
minds of a little vanishing act be
ing pulled over at California.
Before the track season started,
Jim Helmer was right behind Archie
Williams in the quarter mile, he was
j being depended upon by Brutus
j Hamilton to bring in some points
{ with seconds and thirds in dual
i meets this year.
Monday the official entry list for
1 the Cal-Trojan meet at Los Angeles
I this Saturday was released, and in it
| was some sad news. Helmer is left
j completely out of the 440, with Wil-
J liams, Charles Miller, Don Watts,
; Frank Cleary, and, of all people, Bob
Heavey, entered as possible contest-
I ants.
Helmer, bless his heart, isn't be-
I ing left completely out of the meet, i
No, he is listed sixth of eight en
trants in the relay, preceded by
Louis Hubbard, Greg Stout, Miller,
Williams, Elton Weiman, and fol
lowed by Watts and Cleary.
Ah, well, time, tide, and better
quarter-milers don't wait for the
guy that can't catch up.
ALSO TOUGH
FOR DINK
Washington will step into Bay Re
gion athletics onee again when the j
Husky track team comes to the :
Farm Saturday, and while Stanford i
should rate the favorite spot over j
the northernex's, they're liable to |
give Dink's men a track meet.
Cal defeated them 73-58 in an in
door meet at Washington, but since
that* meet the Huskies have recov
ered Ait Morgan, ace hurdler, and
Dave Maginnis, two-miler, from the
injury list. With these additions
they figure to be much stronger, so
Dink's squad will have more than
mediocre competition Saturday.

I HE WONT
COME BACK
To ciean up this Myron Schall
| boxing coach situation once and for
I all, may it be said that Schall has
! a job now that looks pretty good to
j him, he is quite satisfied, and so
| Stanford is just out of luck as far as
| getting his services are concerned.
He started the first of this month
!as athletic director of the Sacra
i mento Elks Club gymnasium and
pool, reputedly the best athletic
layout in town. It's the Elks' good
1 luck. Stanford's bad luck, but let's
let it go at that.
For you who still think that we
ought to have a new boxing coach,
keep your shirts on, maybe some
thing will come up yet.
John Priddle is trying to give var
sity boxing prospects a few point
ers Friday afternoons, at 5 o'clock,
in an attempt to give them a head
start for the season which opens in
the fall.
He has plenty of candidates for the
heavier weights, although he would
like some more if they want to come
out, but his main yearning goes for
119, 129, and 139 - pounders. It
seems there is a scarcity of little
guys that want to fight, outside of
those who were around for the past
season, and John wants to have some
more out for the fight game on the
Farm.
Any fellows that want to do a
little boxing can just drop around
to the boxing room Friday afternoon
around 5:00, and John will be glad
to have you.
SO
THERE!
A certain San Francisco sports
reporter said yesterday that Hank
Luisetti definitely had signed up
with Dink Templeton to high jump
this season.
Well, get this, Rosenbaum. Lui
setti didn't sign up, he didn't come
out to practice yesterday, and he
doesn't know yet whether he is
.going to come out. Well, we all
make mistakes.
