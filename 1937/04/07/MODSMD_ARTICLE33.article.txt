# Pads Are Donned For Grid Session
## 
### 
Pads were donned for the first
time at yesterday's spring football
session as blockers had a chance to
show their stuff.
Outstanding blocking of the day
was done by Sam Beckley, who as
cends from the Grays. Jack Walton,
tackle from the 1936 squad, is show
ing new speed in the guard post,
Tom Walker, frosh half out for the
second time, looks good already.
Bill Paulman and Doc Luckett
were back in their usual good form.
Pete Zagar, burly tackle who looms
in the all-American horizon, came
out to run through plays, but Track
Mentor Dink Templeton refused to
let his ace platter-wielder take a
chance in pads.
Dave Carnahan and Howard Rob
inson were on the sidelines, both
with pulled muscles and leg hem
orrhages. "Dubber" Saunders has
graduated from crutches to a cane,
and pending an improved knee will
be back in uniform in a week or so.

Though of different age, Bob and
Phil Zonne, Stanford cagemen, are
the same height, 6 feet 4 inches, and
the same weight, 190 pounds.
