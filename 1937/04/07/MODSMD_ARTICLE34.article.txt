# Bronco, Indian Nines To Meet
## Rasmussen To Start In Last Game of Series 
### 
Today the varsity baseball team
I travels to Santa Clara to finish a
three-game series with the Broncos.
Stanford holds two victories to
date and figures to repeat, as the
luckless Fitzgerald men have won
but two of 12 conference games.
However, one of the wins was scored
at the expense of U.S.C. with Nick
Radunich in the box for the Broncos.
Radunich is slated to pitch tomor
row; basketball prevented his hurl
ing against the Indians in previous
games.
Neil Rasmussen has drawn the
starting assignment for the Cards.
Supporting "Rasty" will be the same
line-up that was victorious over
Troy last Saturday, including Leo
Heagerty, Darrell Holman, Dick
Tarn, George Farrell, Leonard Linde,
Dick Hanna, Glenn Hamilton, and
Wally deWitt.
The game is slated for 3:15 on
Ryan Field, located across the high
way from the University grounds in
Santa Clara.
