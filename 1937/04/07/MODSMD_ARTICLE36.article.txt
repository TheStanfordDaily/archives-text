# Coaches Will Match Wits In Indian-Bear Tank Tilt
## 
### GENE GEAR 
It will be a battle of master minds
when Nort Thornton of the Indians
and A1 Dowd*n of the Bears stage
their big aquatic show in the Ber
keley natatorium Saturday after
noon.
Not since 1917 has California con
quored the Stanford Red in a swim
ming meet, and hopes are running
high on the Berkeley campus this
week that this year's Bear varsity
has the stuff to turn the trick and
prevent the Cards from
hanging up their twentieth straight
Big Meet victory.
Indians Favored
The Bear aquarians started the
season with very little, losing to
Fullerton J.C., U.C.L.A., and the
Olympic Club. The Indians trounced
all three aggregations and a week
ago appeared to be iron-clad cinches
to annihilate the Bear water forces.
Fiery A1 Dowden waved his wand
last Saturday, and in an hour and a
half the Bears really had a swim
ming team that can't be rated too
much the underdog in Saturday's
classic meet.
It all happened last Saturday
when Cal whipped the Trojans, 41-
34, without winning the final 400-
yard relay event. The day before
the Stanford mermen had jumped
on Troy, 44-31, and had to win that
last relay to do it.
Relay Speeds Up
The Bear medley relay team
turned in the time of 3:08.2, more
than 4 seconds faster than the Card
team can do without the services of
Vibert in the freestyle lap. With Vi
bert, who is ineligible, the event

would be a toss-up.
Jim Shields, Cal "unknown," up
set the great Bob Boales of U.S.C.,
in the 220, stopping the watches at
2:20.7. Win Needham of Stanford,
formerly considered a ci'u h in this
event, has a best time of 2:21. Don
Peterson's best mark this year is
2:22. Needham served notice that
this race will probably be the head
line event of the meet by swimming
2:20.6 in a time trial Monday after
noon.
Relay Counts Heavily
The meet may be decided lay the
final event, the 400-yard relay. Un
der the new rules this year, the
winning relay team garners 7 points,
the losers, nothing. Under the old
scoring system, the winner received
8, the loser, 4.
In this event the Cards will be the
favorites, despite the loss of Vibert.
The Indians without Vibert have
done 3:47.7, and the Bears have
done 3:50.
