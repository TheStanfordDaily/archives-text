# Dowling Will Lead Frosh Against Cal
## 
### 
Following the frosh swimming
team's smashing victories over the
week-end, Frank Dowling, star
sprinter, was elected to captain the
Papooses in their big meet with the
Cal yearlings Saturday morning in
the Berkeley pool.
Friday the Card first-year men
whipped Modesto J.C., 42-32, and
Saturday trounced the San Fran
cisco J C. outfit, 44-22.
The Bear Cubs, boasting Captain
Steve Aronson, famous 50 and 100
man; Fred Gudes in the 220; and
Don Gowdy in the breast-stroke and
diving, are favored to defeat the
Farm water babes, whose sole de
feat this year was at the hands of
the strong San Jose State frosh.
