# The 						People vs. THE People

NO DIFFERENT from every Stanford election
is this one. It is being run by the back
room. If there is a distinction between the old
straight caucus system and the new joint cau
cus system, it is one of degree rather than kind.
Because always will there be the men with the
best teeth, who can run the mile in 4:17, who
will be appointed, inferentially if not openly, to
drive the political bandwagon.
This is a truism, and a compromise with the
Democracy that works fine in the Bill of Rights
and doesn't work at all when the ballots are
marked.
At Stanford, as everywhere else, the 4:17-ers
are at the wheel. And though they may con
tend their plan for a joint Hall-Row ticket is
"idealistic," it is actually more a violation of
Democracy than any amount of "muddling
through" that might prevail in regular cauci.
Its cardinal sin is that it removes the last
obstacle to back-room control. Ordinarily,
though "party fathers" may pick their man and
back him with a controlled convention ma
chine, the public has the last word.
Presidents may be made in Chicago hotel
rooms, but the people still send them to the
White House.
Under a co-operative ticket, the back room
would not only make an A.S.S.U. president,
but would actually put him in the presi
dent's chair. With only one candidate on the
ballot with pledged support, Stanford's student
body would be in the position of Germans and
Italians who go to the polls merely to approve
dictators already dictating.
In other words, because the joint ticket sys
tem demands a closed ticket if it is to be effec
tive, it automatically oversteps the nominating
function, choice, and takes over the electing
function, selection.
More than that, the leaders who will draw
up the joint ticket must, by the nature of their
function, take out of the hands of the caucus
the business of convention choice. The caucus
as it is now operated provides at least a hear
ing for those who wish to make themselves
heard. The choice the ordinary caucus makes
represents the choice of a fair number of
people.* The joint ticket system would check
such a choice, could easily make a choice of
its own entirely opposed to the caucus choices.
But the joint ticket idea breaks down even
more significantly. When all is said and done,
the men in the back room could justify their
overstepping of the rights of both electorate
and nominators if they put up the right man
for the job.
But human nature makes this as impossible
by joint-ticket sand-bagging as by the usual
caucus-election procedure.
People bet on the winning horse, and top
spot politicians are no more vulnerable against
this inclination than their constituents.
What the back-room politicians will do is
put up the man they know can win—not neces
sarily the best man, but the man they figure
the people will want, necessarily the man with
the best teeth, who can run the mile in 4:17 flat.

more significantly. When all is said and done,
the men in the back room could justify their
overstepping of the rights of both electorate
and nominators if they put up the right man
for the job.
But human nature makes this as impossible
by joint-ticket sand-bagging as by the usual
caucus-election procedure.
People bet on the winning horse, and top
spot politicians are no more vulnerable against
this inclination than their constituents.
What the back-room politicians will do is
put up the man they know can win—not neces
sarily the best man, but the man they figure
the people will want, necessarily the man with
the best teeth, who can run the mile in 4:17 flat.
NO DIFFERENT from every Stanford election
is this one. It is being run by the back
room. If there is a distinction between the old
straight caucus system and the new joint cau
cus system, it is one of degree rather than kind.
Because always will there be the men with the
best teeth, who can run the mile in 4:17, who
will be appointed, inferentially if not openly, to
drive the political bandwagon.
This is a truism, and a compromise with the
Democracy that works fine in the Bill of Rights
and doesn't work at all when the ballots are
marked.
At Stanford, as everywhere else, the 4:17-ers
are at the wheel. And though they may con
tend their plan for a joint Hall-Row ticket is
"idealistic," it is actually more a violation of
Democracy than any amount of "muddling
through" that might prevail in regular cauci.
Its cardinal sin is that it removes the last
obstacle to back-room control. Ordinarily,
though "party fathers" may pick their man and
back him with a controlled convention ma
chine, the public has the last word.
Presidents may be made in Chicago hotel
rooms, but the people still send them to the
White House.
Under a co-operative ticket, the back room
would not only make an A.S.S.U. president,
but would actually put him in the presi
dent's chair. With only one candidate on the
ballot with pledged support, Stanford's student
body would be in the position of Germans and
Italians who go to the polls merely to approve
dictators already dictating.
In other words, because the joint ticket sys
tem demands a closed ticket if it is to be effec
tive, it automatically oversteps the nominating
function, choice, and takes over the electing
function, selection.
More than that, the leaders who will draw
up the joint ticket must, by the nature of their
function, take out of the hands of the caucus
the business of convention choice. The caucus
as it is now operated provides at least a hear
ing for those who wish to make themselves
heard. The choice the ordinary caucus makes
represents the choice of a fair number of
people.* The joint ticket system would check
such a choice, could easily make a choice of
its own entirely opposed to the caucus choices.
But the joint ticket idea breaks down even
more significantly. When all is said and done,
the men in the back room could justify their
overstepping of the rights of both electorate
and nominators if they put up the right man
for the job.
