HARDLY has the Class of '40 got the bottle
from its mouth than another sparkle gleams
from Farm "fathers' " eyes. Another litter of
little ones is definitely on the way—the Class
of '41.
Sounds from Ex Committee's boudoir indi
cate that knitting needles are already clicking
off "little things," that the new youngsters next
fall will receive better obstetric care than any
previous bunch of Stanford freshmen.
Unlike last year when the orientation pro

gram was evolved and thrown together in a
hurry, plans for the Pre-registration Period next
September are even now taking shape. In the
four or five days before the rest of the campus
arrives, Chairman George Ditz and his aides
expect to drill enough "Stanford" into the Class
of '41 that at least some of the usual fumbling
and confusion of the first few months will be
eliminated.
Probably the most valuable innovation now
being considered is a revamped Frosh Bible.
After years of publishing a pedantic, codified
"handbook," Ex Committee has realized that the
Frosh Bible is not and has never been a "bible"
to the freshmen. Receiving the book a week
or ten days after they entered Roble or Encina,
the new students glanced at it but were seldom
intrigued enough by its dry academic style to
wade through its many small, tiny-typed pages.
If Ex Committee approves the plans for the
revised "handbook," the Class of '41 will get
its "introduction to Stanford" two or three weeks
before school opens. On large, well-illustrated
pages the new students will find exactly what
they need to know, a minimum of confusing
trivialities.
They will learn what to expect at the Pre
reg period. Then they will be told about living
conditions, course requirements, how-to-study,
rules of conduct, Stanford social life. Campus
customs and traditions will become vivid to
them because the presentation will be brilliant
and colorful.
The new Frosh Bible, like the entire new
attitude toward freshman training, will be based
on the appeal—"Here's the swell lay-out that's
ahead of you" rather than "Here are the rules,
you'd better learn them."—D. B.
