# The 						12-em Sillies
## 
### 
THE DAILY is being very silly today. Out
there on the front are a lot of caucuses and
nominations and elections—manifestations of
the human species having an awful time trying
to settle something about Democracy and Rep
resentation. Or something.
Yes, and a lot of people may mutter over their
coffee about The Daily being more high-school
ish every day, and how it's stupid to waste so
much space over something like that. Someone
might even have written a campus opinion.
They still might.
And they're probably right about The Daily.
We are being silly and stupid, today, just as the
United States was silly and stupid for about
eight months last year over a couple of fellows
who were interested in being President.
Plato and Aristotle and Machiavelli and Marx
and the rest were silly too.
For ages men have tried to work out some
thing for their abstract concepts of liberty and
justice. For ages they've sought the iron-clad
formula that will enable the human species to
live on its little whirling sphere and smile and
say it is happy and satisfied.
But the panacea hasn't shown yet. It may
never.
Meanwhile men will continue to stumble,
and political philosophers will philosophize to
the end of ultimate goodness.
And The Daily will join in, and devote much
space to caucuses and nominations and talk of
Representation and Democracy. And people
will say that it's silly. —G. F.
