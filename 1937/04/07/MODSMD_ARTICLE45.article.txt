FIVE HUNDRED MORE WAS TOO MUCH
Dear dorothy:
Just where all the girls like you went is more
than I can figure out. Back when there were 500 of
you around Stanford you kept your mouths shut and
your eyes open and thereby afforded a pleasant and
happy addition to the scenery.
With the event of the 1000 things began to happen.
Five years ago you had to have a terrific high school
record both scholastically and in activities before you
could even write a letter to the registrar.
You were little girls dressed in women's clothing,
but you weren't obnoxious about it.
# * * *
Then the bars came down and so did the respective
qualities for which you used to be judged.
In the old days you used to combine brains and
beauty and come out with a fairly decent soit of an
idea now and then.
But today there is no collective Stanford woman.
Rather she has divided herself into a motley array of
insignificant pressure groups that seek to shape not
only their own destinies but also those of others, even
going so far as to try and tell the men what to do.
They call this self-government.
* * * *
Now these self-governing groups are all right in
their way and they afford a necessary outlet for the
unnecessary emotions of a Stanford woman. The
groups, in short, if they do nothing else, at least give
the girls something to be emotional about.
But the trouble with the whole idea is that when
these self-styled women jump into the middle of so
ciety waving a diploma, society just tells them their
hair wants cutting and then quietly places them in
their proper knitting circle where they can all emote
together and hurt no one.
In short, Stanford women have not learned their
lesson: that to shout is to make a noise and to make a
noticeable noise is a vulgar display of the absence of
brains.
* * * *
1 could shout like this all day long, but it wouldn't
do any good, because in their little way the women
will continue to shout in Ex Committee and Women's
Council will continue to tell people how to live, when
it doesn't know itself.
The only salvation the men can hope for is that the
women will eventually kill themselves of! because of
infertility.
Until such a time, however, someone ought to offer
a course called:
"Stanford Womne and How To Avoid Them."
Sincerely,
Tro Harper
