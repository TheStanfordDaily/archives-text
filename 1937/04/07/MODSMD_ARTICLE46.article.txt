# CAMPUS OPINION
## X MARKS THE MAN

The Editor, Sir:
A letter in Monday's Daily has
reopened for the time the old ques
tion of lack of interest in campus
politics. Unfortunately, your an
swering editorial is not particularly
helpful. It is futile to attempt by
denunciation to stir up an artificial
mterest in politics, if none exists
naturally. And none will exist nat
urally, just so long as students vote
for people they don't know, to pass
on issues that they don't particu
larly care about. How the difficulty
as to lack of interest in issues may
be overcome, we don't know — pos
sibly by admitting that a consider
able share of the matters now
handled by student officials could be
as well taken care of by the Ad
ministration.
With regard, however, to students
elected to office, a great deal more
interest would be displayed—and a
much better informed interest —
were the mechanism of elections on
a more rational basis. Nomination
by classes, when those classes never
meet, and have no group life to
speak of, is an absurdity. Election
on a campus-wide basis inevitably
results in blind voting, for no stu
dent can know, or be known per
sonally to the major part of 3500
persons. The obvious answer, so
far as it goes, to the problem of an
uninformed and thereby apathetic
electorate is a system of nomination
and election by precincts. Let each
of the halls elect a delegate to the
Ex Committee, and suitable aggre
gations of Row units do likewise.
Hie details of such an arrangement
would of course occasion bitter con
flict of interest, but a reAsonable
compromise should be possible, at
least insofar as Ex Committee is
concerned.
Such an arrangement would have
the following advantages:
1. It would permit the average
student to elect his representatives
upon at least some basis of personal
knowledge.
2. It would permit the representa
tive to feel himself responsible to
some definite group of constituents
—rather than, as now, seeing him
self as a comet revolving through a
space empty but for the fixed stars
of campus political bosses.
It may be contended that such a
system of election by precincts
would perpetuate and publicize the
Hall-Row split. So it would — but
perpetuation is inevitable in any
ease, and publicity might be a good
idea. Certainly it is willful blind
ness to deny that the most effective
units in social and political matters
are the living groups. The Inter
hall Council, Hall and Row Caucus
es, etc., are but unofficial recogni
tions of this fact. Why not recognize
it openly and systematically by
electing at least Ex Committee
members by precincts?
Very truly yours,
Richard Behrens Eaton
