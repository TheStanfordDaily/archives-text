LOST HORIZON
A PHILOSOPHICAL picture sel
dom goes over with the public,
but a philosophical picture with ac
tion and scenic beauty makes a gen
eral appeal. The Frank Capra pro
duction, "Lost Horizon," brings to
the screen a picture which basically
presents an ideal about the way to
live, and photographically gives the
observer a beautiful group of snow
and mountain scenery.
The presumably accidental kid
naping of a group of persons of
various types, and their rescue by
some monks from a monastery high
in the mountains of Tibet supplies
the background for the action of the
story. The swift reaction against
circumstance and the subsequent
peaceful acceptance of the pleasant
surroundings and moderate life
are brought to a climax when Con
way's brother tries to regain the
outer world.
Those persons who have read the
book by James Hilton will find that
this picture realizes all the poten
tialities of the novel and will come
away from the show with the feel
ing of not having been deprived of
anything by the picture.
Ronald Colman as "Conway" is
most adequate and preserves the
character portrayed in the book. He
is the same s. • >ng leader, quietly
reserved, wondering what it is all
about, and then finding his ideal at
the monastery "Shangri-La."
Sam Jaffe in the role of the high
Lama invests the entire plot with a
reason and continuity in two short
scenes. The supporting cast, includ
ing a new feminine lead, Jane Wy
att, helps to make "Lost Horizon"
complete in action, story, and pho
tography. —Seid
