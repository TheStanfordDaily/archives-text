# Rouble Leads Denouncing Of Caucuses
## 'Power Too Great,' Says Ex Committee; Women Plan Special Election 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
In what was described as a "move
toward democracy in Stanford stu
dent government," Ex Committee
last night officially denounced the
political power wielded by organ
ized partisan caucuses.
Though the committee has no
power to outlaw Hall and Row
j nominating meetings, the legisla
| tive body made it clear that "no
j candidate should feel honor-bound
to caucus tickets nor voter to living
I group affiliation."
Rouble Leads
Graduate Member Larry Rouble,
J a power in Hall politics, instigated
j the action because, he said, "these
caucuses allow small groups to
force out good candidates and are
therefore a detriment to student
government."
Even though Rouble and Joe
I Weiner, another graduate member,
favored a joint Hall-Row caucus
when the idea was suggested at the
Toyon meeting Monday night, both
agreed last night that a general i
| nominating assembly would not I
I solve the current, problem.
Caucuses Defended
"Caucuses tend to distribute good
I men all down the line," Student i
[ Manager Chuck Fontius argued. "If !
i there was no previous agreement, j
| all the best men would run for
; student-body president." Rouble
j did not agree.
"People aren't satisfied with the
! way nominations are running now," j
j he said.
The "rat" or "bad boy" feeling j
! against nominees who run without
caucus sanction was hit as "undem
| ocratic." The Committee, in its at
; tempt to break the power of the
| caucus, advised anybody to "go
| ahead and run. The power of the
J few must be broken."
Power 'Too Great'
Jack Calderwood, junior man, ar
j gued that the caucus system would
■ not be eliminated by such a decree
I because the factions needed some
method of nominating candidates. Ex
! Committee, however, felt the pres
! ent power of the caucuses was "too
i great."
1 The fact that nearly every mem-
I ber of Ex Committee was elected j
through the power of a caucus at a
i previous election was brought out
by Rouble when he admitted that
"maybe this is stabbing somebody in
, the back."
Supervision Suggested
Official supervision of caucuses
j through the election board was sug
i gested momentarily by Bill Quade,
Men's Council chairman, but Fon
tius declared such was outside Ex
i Committee's power.
1 "This Hall-Row feeling is just a
I state of mind drummed up before
| every election," Barbara Kimball,
Women's Conference chairman, de-
I clared. "It's unnatural and these
| caucuses make it worse."
i Meanwhile, the rest of the cam
pus' politicians were busy up the
Row knifing and counter-knifing
j candidates for the Row ticket.
Other student-body business in
cluded:
j WOMEN'S ELECTION: Instead of
electing a vice-chairman and secre
j tary of Women's Conference next
Tuesday, women voters must first
■ pass an amendment empowering
I them to elect these extra officers.
Previously elected by the Confer
| cnce itself, the two posts will be
1 filled at a special women's election
within two weeks. A constitutional
i technicality prevents putting them
' on the general ballot.
B.A.C. REPRESENTATIVE: Lar
ry Rouble will fill the vacant B.A.C.
post until a successor to Roger Mun
} ger is elected next week. Munger
i did not return to school this quar
! ter.
i ASSEMBLY REGULATION: The
'Student-Faculty Relations Com
mittee was handed the job of work
ing with the Administration's Pub
lic Exercises Committee in plan
ning Tuesday evening lectures, and
other group meetings.
