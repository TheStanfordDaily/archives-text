# Committee To Review All Surveys
## Campus Questionnaires Must Be Approved By A.S.S.U. Executives 
### 
All questionnaires and surveys
conducted on the campus will be
subject to Ex Committee approval,
according to provisions of a regula
tion unanimously adopted by that
body Tuesday night.
While the regulation is binding at
present, not only upon all campus
publications, but upon individuals,
Committeemen agreed they would
consider modification and revision
when a more workable regulation
was submitted.
The finished regulation was
evolved after about 15 minutes' con
sideration of a regulation embodied
in a motion made by Women's Coun
cil last Wednesday, and approved
by Women's Conference Monday.
Conference Presents
The original legislation, brought
before Ex Committee by Barbara
Kimball, Women's Conference presi
dent, provided that any survey con
cerning the women should not be
circulated without approval of Con
ference.
Tlie question of whether all sur
veys, including merchandising sur
veys, should be subject to approval
of such a body opened questions of
authority to administer the regula
tion and of exclusion of certain sur
veys from the approval requirement.
Women to Revise
The measure finally adopted will
not affect the original measure on
the books of Women's Conference,
President Kimball declared, except
for modification to conform with the
Committee's version.
In an editorial published today, the
Daily pointed out mechanical diffi
culties which it believes would in
evitably result from the Ex Cofnmit
tee supervision, and suggested in
stead that a committee be appointed
by Ex Committee to discuss Daily
policy from time to time, making
recommendations to the Editor.
To Avoid Publicity
In commenting upon the present
regulation, A.S.S.U. Vice-President
Esther Pelton indicated that the pro
posal was to assure both men and
women in the University that they
would not be subject to publicity
both harmful to them as a group and
to the University as an institution.
The regulation significantly included
independent writers as well as the
Daily.
The Daily last night intended to
formally submit its compromise plan
to Ex Committee at their session
next Tuesday.
