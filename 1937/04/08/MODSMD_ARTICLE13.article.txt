# Eating Clubs Join Lagunita Women To Dine, Dance
## 
### 
Approximately 150 couples danced
to the music of Hal Barnes and his
Stanford Cavaliers last night in the
dining room of Branner Hall after
the Lagunita Court - men's eating
clubs exchange dinner.
Half of Lagunita Court travelled
to the eating clubs, who have been
washing windows and scrubbing
floors for the past weekâ€”that is all
the clubs except the Breakers. The
rest of the girls stayed at home and
received the members of the clubs
who came there.
This is the first time that La
gunita Court has held an exchange
dinner in which the entire dormi
tory has been included. Usually
exchanges have been arranged
through single casas and a club.
Dinners are being planned with
Sequoia and the fraternities for
later in the quarter, according to
Winnie Jean Smith, vice-president
of Lagunita Court.
