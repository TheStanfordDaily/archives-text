# Prom Maestro Recognized As Innovator Of 'Swing'
## 
### 
Jimmy Dorsey, who will bring his
13-picce band and entertainers to
the Pavilion for the? Senior Prom
Friday night, is nationally recog
nized as one of the better agents of
"that thing called swing."
Panassie, the noted French critic
of modern music, places Dorsey
among the country's leading clar
inetists and praises his work on the
saxophone also. Most of Dorscy's
work with his orchestra, however, is
done on the saxophone instead of
the clarinet.
The maestro entered big time mu
sical circles 18 years ago, when he
joined the Louisiana Five, still
ranked as one of the outstanding
"jam" bands of all time. Later he
played with the now defunct Gene
Goldkette orchestra, allegedly the
best jazz orchestra ever developed.
Probably the most famous of the

j early day groups with which Jim
| my played was the "Five Pennies,"
formed by Red Nichols. Dorsey then
I joined the California Ramblers,
| Vincent Lopez, Paul Whiteman, and
Ted Lewis in succession. He made
! a European tour as a member of
Lewis' band.
Jimmy was joined by his brother,
Tommy, ace trombone artist, to
j form the Dorsey Brothers orchestra
in 1934. A year later Tommy left the
| band to organize his own unit. The
group which will appear at the
Senior Prom is essentially the orig
inal Dorsey Brothers band.
The orchestra is featured in "That
Girl from Paris" and the latest As
taire-Rogers film, and is co-starred
I with Bing Crosby and Bob Burns
j on an hour radio show each week.
A limited number of Prom bids
are still available at the A.S.S.U.
office.
