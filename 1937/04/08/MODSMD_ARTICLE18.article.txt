# Candidates Speak At All-University Assembly Today
## Classes Will Be Dismissed As Meeting Goes on Testing Block Today For Last Time 
### 
It's Stanford's all-University nominating assembly on the testing block
at 1 Oo'clock this morning.
It's Stanford's first chance in three years to eye election candidates as
a group and hear them speak.
It's Stanford's last chance if it fails, according to indications given by
the Public Exercises Committee which abolished the assembly after the

â–ºfiasco in 1935, at which there were
present only a handful of the Stan
ford body politic.
So it is that 10 o'clock classes will
be wiped off the docket in favor of an
all-University assembly at which
bits of light entertainment will be
stirred in with politics.
A basketball rally honoring Stan
ford's Pacific Coast Champianship
quintet, a talk by Coach John Bunn,
a short address on Stanford stu-

dent government by Professor Har
old C. Hand of the School of Edu
cation, and music by the uniformed
men's and women's glee clubs will
garnish the political speeches.
In the absence of A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Jim Reynolds, Vice-President
Esther Pelton will introduce candi
dates for offices in the election next.
Tuesday. Approximately the first
third of the assembly is expected to
be devoted to presentation of plat
forms and pleas for votes.
A short talk by basketball captain
Dinty Moore, presentation of awards
and yells will be highlights of the
championship celebration.
