# Hanna Explains Modern House
## Educator Describes His Pine Hill 'Dream Home' 
### 
"The principles of modern archi
tecture are not as difficult nor as
abstract as is commonly supposed,"
said Professor Paul Hanna before
the Luncheon Club yesterday in
describing his home which is being
constructed on the campus.
Chief departures from common
procedures in design and building
were the preliminary steps taken
before planning the house, and the
type of material used in actual con
struction.
Habits Studied
Before drawing up plans, Frank
Lloyd Wright, noted architect, spent
some time living with the Hanna
family; during this period he stud
ied living habits, house
hold routine, and similar details. It
was only after this time that actual
planning began.
Employing what Mr. Wright pre
dicts will be the typical building
method of the future, only two types
of construction units were used: a
hexagonal shaped floor block, and
vertical units of glass or redwood
which composed the walls. From
these two units, it is possible to con
struct a house of any plan by proper
arrangement and comibnation of the
units, said Professor Hanna.
Novel Designs
Special features of design include
a central kitchen, ai'ound which
other rooms are arranged; a fire
place placed in the center of the liv
ing room, allowing guests to sit all
around the fire; in-set bathtubs;
glass walls which can be rolled
back, opening rooms to the outside;
and a garage, or "car port" capable
of holding 12 cars.
STONE LAKE, Wis., April 7
(UP). —James J. Braddock, settled
in his first conditioning camp since
he outpointed Max Baer for the
heavyweight title almost two years
ago, planned a heavy workout with
a woodsman's axe today.
