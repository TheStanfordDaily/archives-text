# 'Precious' Actors Invade Chinatown for Atmosphere
## 
### 
Led by Dramatic pirector Gordon
Lange, a group of 26 members of the
cast of Dramatic Council's spring
quarter production of "Lady Prec
ious Stream" undertook an excur
sion to San Francisco Chinatown's
Mandarin Theater last Saturday
night to witness a typical Chinese
stage production and oriental dra
matic technique.
Situated in the heart of the Chi
nese section, the theater is a citadel
of Oriental culture, completely un
tarnished by the buzzing, hurried
modern life of San Francisco, which
flourishes only a few blocks away.
Once inside the theater the visitors
were completely immersed in the
environment of the East. Not a sin
gle word of English was interspersed
among the host of Chinese charac
ters which decorated the colorful
canopies hanging upon the walls of
the building.
American Clock Used
A typical grammar school-room
clock with Roman numerals upon it
was the only evidence which re
minded Lange's party that they
were only a half mile removed from
the contemporary American scene.
While a band composed of a vio
linist, a trumpeter, and a drummer
pounded out weird, noisy "music"
without so much as one second's
cessation, the Chinese players,
garbed in glamorous robes of bril
liant colors, put on a very method

ical and — for westerners — unique
performance.
Weird Music Played
At intervals when the action ap
proached a climax, the three-man
band produced its ominous "music"
with such forceful volume that it
seemed to the party as if the fall of
the Great Wall of China or some
catastrophe of equal magnitude was
impending. Such was not the case,
however, as not a single execution
or sweet lotus - blossomed kiss fol
lowed the ear-rending blasts from
the orchestra pit.
Learned Methods
Most distinguished of the actors
was an old patriarch who flaunted a
long black beard at the poor, wiz
ened, bewhiskered prisoner who
was brought before him for judg
ment. Oddly enough, one of the
younger characters — presumably a
prince—sported a fleecy white beard
far longer than that which fell from
the chin of the elderly patriarch.
After having seen Chinese drama
as it is portrayed by the natives,
Director Lange's performers are
probably more keenly aware of the
task that confronts them in learning
to imitate the graceful, stately
movements which are characteristic
of Orientals on the stage.
The first edition of Shakespeare's
sonnets, published in 1609 by Tom
Thorpe, was a pirated one.

seemed to the party as if the fall of
the Great Wall of China or some
catastrophe of equal magnitude was
impending. Such was not the case,
however, as not a single execution
or sweet lotus - blossomed kiss fol
lowed the ear-rending blasts from
the orchestra pit.
Learned Methods
Most distinguished of the actors
was an old patriarch who flaunted a
long black beard at the poor, wiz
ened, bewhiskered prisoner who
was brought before him for judg
ment. Oddly enough, one of the
younger characters — presumably a
prince—sported a fleecy white beard
far longer than that which fell from
the chin of the elderly patriarch.
After having seen Chinese drama
as it is portrayed by the natives,
Director Lange's performers are
probably more keenly aware of the
task that confronts them in learning
to imitate the graceful, stately
movements which are characteristic
of Orientals on the stage.
The first edition of Shakespeare's
sonnets, published in 1609 by Tom
Thorpe, was a pirated one.
Led by Dramatic pirector Gordon
Lange, a group of 26 members of the
cast of Dramatic Council's spring
quarter production of "Lady Prec
ious Stream" undertook an excur
sion to San Francisco Chinatown's
Mandarin Theater last Saturday
night to witness a typical Chinese
stage production and oriental dra
matic technique.
Situated in the heart of the Chi
nese section, the theater is a citadel
of Oriental culture, completely un
tarnished by the buzzing, hurried
modern life of San Francisco, which
flourishes only a few blocks away.
Once inside the theater the visitors
were completely immersed in the
environment of the East. Not a sin
gle word of English was interspersed
among the host of Chinese charac
ters which decorated the colorful
canopies hanging upon the walls of
the building.
American Clock Used
A typical grammar school-room
clock with Roman numerals upon it
was the only evidence which re
minded Lange's party that they
were only a half mile removed from
the contemporary American scene.
While a band composed of a vio
linist, a trumpeter, and a drummer
pounded out weird, noisy "music"
without so much as one second's
cessation, the Chinese players,
garbed in glamorous robes of bril
liant colors, put on a very method

ical and — for westerners — unique
performance.
Weird Music Played
At intervals when the action ap
proached a climax, the three-man
band produced its ominous "music"
with such forceful volume that it
seemed to the party as if the fall of
the Great Wall of China or some
catastrophe of equal magnitude was
impending. Such was not the case,
however, as not a single execution
or sweet lotus - blossomed kiss fol
lowed the ear-rending blasts from
