llfi WAS A GREAT
GOAL KICKER
Ray Lewis, brother of Spud, who
coached football at U.S.F. last,year,
and a former grid star for Stanford
who went to Temple with Pop
Warner when the Old Fox left the
Farm, is thinking very seriously of
coming back to Stanford to finish his
education.
Ray was a great' rugby player, as
well as being quite an American
football star, and it seems that if he
came back he would be eligible for
one more year at the Empire game.
Harry Maloney, minor sports direc
tor and rugby coach, received a let
ter from Lewis a few days ago, and
in it was expressed the athlete's de
sire to get back to the Farm.
While unacquainted with either
Spud or Ray, old Slantser knows
an older brother, Tommy, in the
Lewis family, and if Ray is anything
like brother T. it certainly is going
to be a pleasure to know him. Come
ahead, Ray, the Farm will be glad
to have you back.
ALL ALUMNI
AREN'T WOLVES
Members of the rugby team who
played in the California game will
be awarded sweaters tonight, at a
dinner for the team. Those sweat
ers are being paid for by a group of
alumni, all of them former athletes
who played rugby or soccer for
Harry MaJoney.
Some of them left Stanford many
years ago, but they still think
enough of the old school to help out
in rewarding the kids who play to
day. As far as their contributions
are concerned, the mere amount they
donate is beside the point. Many of
Ihem could give enough to buy the
whole batch of sweaters without
ever missing it. But the fact that
they feel a sense of loyalty, gener
osity to Stanford puts them in a
class which is responsible for mak
ing this old world not quite such a
poor place to live.
OH,
IIOY!
Some wonderful things come into
a newspaper office in the way of
publicity. Every school has a pub
licity department from which come
bundles of mimeographed dope on

just what's doing. The sports de
partment of The Stanford Daily is
the recipient of much of this mate
rial, not only from schools but from
miscellaneous organizations that
feel the need of advertising.
However, the sheet that takes the
prize in the reams of matter that
has come into The Daily in many
moons is a little discussion of an
impending track and field meet to be
held during the Isleton Asparagus
Festival.
The scheduled track meet is,
however, exclusively for grammar
school students. •
Sacramento, Solano, Yolo, and
San Joaquin county kids have been
invited to compete, but how the di
rector of the Press Relations Com
mittee of the Isleton Chamber of
Commerce ever got the idea that
The Stanford Daily might want to
know about it is marvelous.
McCurdy, maybe you better take
over some of your colleagues and
have a fling at the 300-yard relay
race.
