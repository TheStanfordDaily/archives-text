# Malott Runs 48.2 Trial in 440 Dash
## 
### 
Last year Ray Malott was third
to a 1:59 half in the Washington
meet held in Seattle. Yesterday he
turned in a 48.2 quarter-mile to set
himself up as a cinch in the return
affair with the Huskies to be held
on Angell Field Saturday.
Other notable efforts in workouts
that were interspersed between
events of the Frosh-San Jose meet
were Weiershauser's 24-flat flight of
lows and Hawkins' 15.1 trial in the
high hurdles. Both will have tough
going against Art Morgan, stellar
Husky timberman.
