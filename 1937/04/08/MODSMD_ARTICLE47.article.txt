# Ex Committee's Boiler
## 
### 
WHEN water boils in a closed vessel, the
vessel bursts. Tuesday Ex Committee
built a boiler around the water.
It decided that, for the present at least, all
questionnaires and surveys conducted on the
campus must be approved by Ex Committee
before they are circulated.
That regulation is the closed boiler. Inside
it is a liquid with, sociologically speaking, a low
boiling point. That liquid is a solution of the
ambitions, misconceptions, mistakes, bad judg
ment, ability and potential achievements and
routine business of people who write and pub
lish. That fluid is always boiling, always ex
panding.
It will inevitably break Ex Committee's boiler
窶馬ot because of the nature of the fluid, but
the nature of the boiler.
The boiler was built without an easily oper
ated safety valve. It simply doesn't conform
to the peculiarities of the liquid.
For, according to the adopted regulations,
such wispy vapors as merchandising surveys
conducted by campus publications would be
surrounded by Ex Committee's regulatory re
tort.
Now there is nothing inherent in surveys in
jurious to the University or its students. Ex
Committee doesn't truly even want to see an
ordinary survey, much less approve it or re
ject it.
Actually, the regulation was voted in to
make impossible surveys or questionnaires in
jurious to the students or the Administration.
Yet, here is a piece of legislation that blankets
in all surveys, would give the Committee hours
of work a year that doesn't need doing.
True, the Committee has agreed to consider
a revision or elaboration of the existing regu
lation. But The Daily questions whether blan
ket statutory regulation is the best method of
gaining the power of approval or rejection of
the isolated violation, so far as official publica
tions are concerned.
It stands convinced that campus magazine
and newsmen, who must necessarily work fast
to meet deadlines, would be bogged down with
a regulation either laboriously complicated to
permit many exceptions to the main rule, or so
sweeping as to require an equally impractical
okeh on every kind of survey.
Instead The Daily suggests a plan, a boiler
with a safety-valve, not a sealed-tight ordinance:
that a sub-committee of Ex Committee meet oc
casionally to discuss general policy with staff
members.
The Editor would not necessarily be bound
by the discussion. But he could, through it,
gain a fuller understanding of the current prob
lems of student government from the governors.
Such an understanding would act far more ef
fectively to avoid injury than any amount of
iron-bound, sealed-tight legislative containers.

a regulation either laboriously complicated to
permit many exceptions to the main rule, or so
sweeping as to require an equally impractical
okeh on every kind of survey.
Instead The Daily suggests a plan, a boiler
with a safety-valve, not a sealed-tight ordinance:
that a sub-committee of Ex Committee meet oc
casionally to discuss general policy with staff
members.
The Editor would not necessarily be bound
by the discussion. But he could, through it,
gain a fuller understanding of the current prob
lems of student government from the governors.
Such an understanding would act far more ef
fectively to avoid injury than any amount of
iron-bound, sealed-tight legislative containers.
WHEN water boils in a closed vessel, the
vessel bursts. Tuesday Ex Committee
built a boiler around the water.
It decided that, for the present at least, all
questionnaires and surveys conducted on the
campus must be approved by Ex Committee
before they are circulated.
That regulation is the closed boiler. Inside
it is a liquid with, sociologically speaking, a low
boiling point. That liquid is a solution of the
ambitions, misconceptions, mistakes, bad judg
ment, ability and potential achievements and
routine business of people who write and pub
lish. That fluid is always boiling, always ex
panding.
It will inevitably break Ex Committee's boiler
窶馬ot because of the nature of the fluid, but
the nature of the boiler.
The boiler was built without an easily oper
ated safety valve. It simply doesn't conform
to the peculiarities of the liquid.
For, according to the adopted regulations,
such wispy vapors as merchandising surveys
conducted by campus publications would be
surrounded by Ex Committee's regulatory re
tort.
Now there is nothing inherent in surveys in
jurious to the University or its students. Ex
Committee doesn't truly even want to see an
ordinary survey, much less approve it or re
ject it.
Actually, the regulation was voted in to
make impossible surveys or questionnaires in
jurious to the students or the Administration.
Yet, here is a piece of legislation that blankets
in all surveys, would give the Committee hours
of work a year that doesn't need doing.
True, the Committee has agreed to consider
a revision or elaboration of the existing regu
lation. But The Daily questions whether blan
ket statutory regulation is the best method of
gaining the power of approval or rejection of
the isolated violation, so far as official publica
tions are concerned.
It stands convinced that campus magazine
and newsmen, who must necessarily work fast
to meet deadlines, would be bogged down with
a regulation either laboriously complicated to
permit many exceptions to the main rule, or so
sweeping as to require an equally impractical
okeh on every kind of survey.
