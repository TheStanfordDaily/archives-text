# The
						Mask Brawl

### 
STRUTTING under the proud banner of so
called "idealism," some of the smiling
machinists who make the little wheels go round
in Stanford's political piledriver, have just fin
ished a lot of talking about a joint ticket for the
coming A.S.S.U. election.
But now that the talking is over, we can do
well to lift the virtuous mask, throw away the
little shovel, and look matters in the face. What
was behind this coup?
It all started when half a dozen of our top
notch machinists from both Row and Hall sud
denly realized that by getting together, the
handful of them could wind and unwind Stan
ford politics without any election to bother
about.
The Hall men were low on good candidate

material; they would profit from a joint ticket
there. The Row men had nothing really to gain
except the personal prestige connected with
bulldozing 3800 people. Terrific opportunities
were offered to do just that. They can hardly
be blamed for trying.
So they left the Zete house meeting rooms set
to sell their stunt with lubricated tab lines:
"idealistic idea"—to get the best men for Stan
ford leaders."
Politics is fun—these men have found that out.
And they've been playing a game with the little
mechanical toys around Stanford. But the game
is only fun when played with masks.
Let the game go on. Don't try to quell poli
tics for politics is interest and interest is the
essence of Democracy. Don't ding politics.
But periodically lift the mask.—G. F.
