# City Fun on the Farm
## 
### 
BEST reason City-goers give for their week
end bustle up the Bayshore is that more fun
can be found under the jittering neon and tung
sten glow than Stanford's academically styled
entertainment provides.
Often that's true. This week-end it isn't.
Swingman Jimmy Dorsey, if past perform
ances are indicative, can turn the belated Pa
vilion into dance palace de luxe Friday night,
especially if his baton brings that never-to-be
forgotten swing arrangement of "Come Join the
Band" that still echoes in deep corners of
Stanford's Basketball-Concert-Dance-Carnival or
what-have-you auditorium.
And Saturday, home-town entertainment in a
different vein: light, raucous, interesting —the
Sophomore Carnival, refreshing for its novelty,
successful for its informality.
There is quality and variety this week-end; a
big name band and home-town tent show to
blanket the glittering glamor of the big town.
An invitation to Stanford to stay at home.
For many, there will be no need to venture
north of Mora's.—G. F.
