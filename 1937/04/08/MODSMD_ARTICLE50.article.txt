/"|NE of the houses that had not been on the gravy
boat for a long time decided last year that the
time had come to grease up the grooves again, and
explained carefully to one of its freshmen how to
become politicians and get to be practically famous.
The freshman followed all the rules carefully and
got his caucus all organized. He got his houses all
lined up and Robot's Rules of Order figured out. He
was all set to put himself across in the caucus, when
up comes the caucus with a bang-bang, and he sud
denly discovered that he didn't have anybody to man
age the caucus, and he couldn't very well nominate
himself so he got up and nominated a gentleman
from another house.
Frustrated in their attempt to get in on the ground
floor, the house rested on its oars, and said, "Wait till
next year."
this year came, and the sophomores went
™ down to the pledge class and explained how to
organize a caucus and showed them how to avoid all
the pitfalls of the past.
Very cagey youths these, so they sent two members
to the caucus this time: the powerhouse who was going
to sweep Encina, and his stooge. The powerhouse was
a very straightforward lad of rich but honest parents,
well schooled in prep school politics. So when the
caucus opened with a bang-bang, the powerhouse did
the honorable thing by jumping up and nominating
his stooge, thinking this a perfectly equitable pro
cedure, since the stooge would then turn around and
nominate him.
This did not work out very well, however, since
the stooge was sent from the room because he was a
candidate for office.
The politically impotent house is now expectantly
waiting till next year, when it intends to kidnap its
powerhouses and make its nominations by telegraph.
if nobody else gets excited about politics, the
boys over in The Daily, who make it their busi
ness, certainly do. The El Toro associate editor in
charge of the gentlemen nominated by the hall caucus,
when a staff member came up and pointed out that
the name of the caucus candidate for senior Ex Com
mitch was spelled wrong.
"That doesn't make any difference," said the asso
ciate editor.
He didn't know that the staff member was the
caucus candidate for senior Ex Commitch.
I think this has gone far enough.

up comes the caucus with a bang-bang, and he sud
denly discovered that he didn't have anybody to man
age the caucus, and he couldn't very well nominate
himself so he got up and nominated a gentleman
from another house.
Frustrated in their attempt to get in on the ground
floor, the house rested on its oars, and said, "Wait till
next year."
this year came, and the sophomores went
™ down to the pledge class and explained how to
organize a caucus and showed them how to avoid all
the pitfalls of the past.
Very cagey youths these, so they sent two members
to the caucus this time: the powerhouse who was going
to sweep Encina, and his stooge. The powerhouse was
a very straightforward lad of rich but honest parents,
well schooled in prep school politics. So when the
caucus opened with a bang-bang, the powerhouse did
the honorable thing by jumping up and nominating
his stooge, thinking this a perfectly equitable pro
cedure, since the stooge would then turn around and
nominate him.
This did not work out very well, however, since
the stooge was sent from the room because he was a
candidate for office.
The politically impotent house is now expectantly
waiting till next year, when it intends to kidnap its
powerhouses and make its nominations by telegraph.
if nobody else gets excited about politics, the
boys over in The Daily, who make it their busi
ness, certainly do. The El Toro associate editor in
charge of the gentlemen nominated by the hall caucus,
when a staff member came up and pointed out that
the name of the caucus candidate for senior Ex Com
mitch was spelled wrong.
"That doesn't make any difference," said the asso
ciate editor.
He didn't know that the staff member was the
caucus candidate for senior Ex Commitch.
I think this has gone far enough.
