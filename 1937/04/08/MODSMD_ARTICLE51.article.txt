DENMARK IS ROTTEN!
/ I ARDBOARD palaccs arc tottering and Stanford
4 democracy stands at the very brink of deep dark
black disaster. I tell you, gentlemen, now is the time
for all good men to come to the aid of the party!
The San Francisco graft investigation is as nothing
compared to this local holocaust. Why, it is said that
at the caucuses bargaining and electioneering were
carried on in the very shadow of the polls in a shame
fully flagrant manner. As each delegation sold its soul
for a few votes, it was heard to ask, what's in it for
us? It is rumored that the triple four-way double
cross was worn to an early grave by overwork.
♦ * * *
And behind a staggering barrage of words laid
down in the Daily yesterday morning it seems that the
very freedom of the press is being challenged!
Brrfsk and egad, can such things be? Mice, are we
men? Stanford needs men, it needs YOU. Enlist
NOW!
Oh, by the way, gentlemen, I forgot to tell you I
didn't mean enlist in the army to fight the black
scourge raging within our gates; I mean enlist now and
come out to sec the balloon go up.
* * * *
I know this excruciatingly crucial moment is not
the time for flat-bottomed barges like myself to get
cynical ,but has student government ever governed or
has it always just filled the great balloon, and do the
politicians do anything or were they always just boys
and girls playing house and making mud pies?
And as for this cataclysmic commotion in Feahop
Flats, this cataclysmic whooping whirlwind in. the
thimble, I nsk you who cares?
