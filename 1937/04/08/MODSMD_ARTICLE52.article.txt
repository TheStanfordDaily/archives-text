# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
ENCINA CAUCI
The Editor, Sir:
In view of the approaching elec
tions, I was about to suggest that
some means be taken to identify
the candidates as they stroll about
the campus. Unfortunately, the mat
ter was taken out of my hands the
minute the candidate recognized the
fact that one caucus or the other or
a room-mate was running him for
offices: Every candidate I have seen
so far is wearing his Sunday best.
If he hasn't a suit, he's at least wear
ing a tic. Don't tell me the campus
not only does not frown on the non
rough anymore, but that it favors
the idea, or are the blokes poor
politicians?
Aristocratic
Of .course it would lend an aris
tocratic air to Stanford politics. This
might well tend to clean things up.
Even as the unsuspecting frosh, I
fear I am being duped into voting
for Row or Hall men I don't know,
because the ones I know don't look
so good.
In Encina last night, by actual
count, there were at least 17 official
cauci. Groups of would-be po
liticos decided whom they would
play as their hall and whom they
would run as their row candidate so
they would be sure to get someone
in. If someone would only announce,
officially, shall we say Ex Commit
tee, that while there will be no offi
cial nominating committee, no one
will win in the election unless he be
nominated by the two semi-official
nominating committees!
Amusement vs. Alarm
Furthermore, if I caught the gist
of this morning's trifle about cen
sorship, someone was trying to sup
press the articles printed occasion
ally in The Daily, that give the older
generation a chance to say, "Ah!
Youth! Oh to be young once more!"
The attitude of the outside world
is, in most cases, one of amusement.
There is no need to worry over
outside comment. Once off the cam
pus, facts about the campus are
treated with less weighty consider
ation than we are inclined to be
lieve here, impressed as we are with
our own importance.
May I request, then, a weekly
dose of disillusionment for Stanford?
It ranks too far behind other schools
in liberalism, or at least radicalism.
