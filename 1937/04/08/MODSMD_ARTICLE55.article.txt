CLARK, everybody's play
goer. has been seeing some more
shows in New York, among them
Anderson's "High Tor," which has
just won the 1937 Critics' Award,
and Noel Coward's latest spasm,
"Tonight at 8:30." His reactions,
favorable in both instances, are
printed for what they're worth.
"High Tor." If we could say
"Ohhh boy!" in the Martha Raye
manner, we might more coherently
express our relish of Maxwell An
derson's comedy - drama - fantasy
potpourri. The best we can do is
say we liked it better than "Win
terset." The plot concerns a young
Dutchman who owns a portion of
the Hudson Palisades sought by a
trap-rock company. Among his
mountain's inhabitants is the last of
the Mohicans, or some such tribe.
And the ghostly crew of one of
Henry Hudson's ships. Add two
shady realtors, who spend the great
er part of the evening suspended
over the Hudson in a steam shovel,
three small-time bank robbers who
came out decidedly second-best in a
skirmish with the lustiest of the
Dutch phantoms, mix well, and the
result is the season's best theater.
Burgess Meredith as the determined
opponent of modern civilization,
and Charles D. Brown as Spook De-
Witt, on the lookout for a nice
modern girl before he becomes too
ghostly to do anything about it, are
closely pressed for acting honors by
Harold Moffett and practically the
whole cast. Maxwell Anderson
emerges even more definitely than

before as America's premier play
wright.
When it comes to Noel Coward we
toss in our critical chips. Ever since
"Private Lives" impersonal and un
prejudiced consideration of Bri
ain's enfant terrible has been im
possible. In "Tonight at 8:30" he
presents Gertrude Lawrence in a
series of nine one-act plays which
require three nights to run off. Per
haps his attempts to be serious don't
click with the precision of the light
er efforts, but we revelled through
'em all. We will admit that Coward
plays his usual dirty trick of writ
ing his plays in such a manner
no one but himself, and in this case
Miss Lawrence, can do them full
justice, but who are we to quibble?
Mr. Coward's appearance as actor,
singer, dancer, song-writer, director,
producer, and playwright should set
a new record for general excellence
of irons in the fire.
