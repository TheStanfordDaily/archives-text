# Device Moves Trees With Greatest Ease
## 
### 
Like the band of a mechanical colossus the tree-mover being used in
the new amphitheater lifts anything from oaks to acorns and sets it
down again with the greatest of ease.
When Al. Roth saw such a machine at work in Kansas City, Mis
souri, he decided that it was iust the thing for rapid, efficient trans- j

♦portation of trees to Stanford's am- |
phitheater. After conferring with j
J. W. McDonnell, superintendent of
! buildings and grounds, 'Mr. Roth or
dered the tree-mover from the Gar- |
' den Shop of Kansas City at a cost of
$2500.
Driven to Stanford
Joe Jelcick was sent to Kansas j
C'ty to see the merits of the device !
demonstrated and to learn how to
maneuver it. The tree - mover, |
1 mounted on an International truck, i
was driven back to Stanford by Mr. '
I Jeicick. It is the only machine of j
its kind on the Pacific Coast.
A large tree, that has been dug
up and whose base has been placed
!in a box of soil, is lifted onto the :
j truck by means of a power winch
I operating through a power take-off •
to the engine. A hook on a travel- J
ing head grasps the tree, and as the
! head moves along the steel beam i
1 above ,it is dragged onto the truck. !
| The great weight is transferred i
from the springs of the truck to the
ground during loading and unload- 1
! ing by two supporting braces.
- Unloading Device
In depositing the tree a hand-op
e~ated winch controls the 800 feet of
cable that carry it out on the beam
and lower it into the hole that has
been dug for it. The machine has
been used to move all large trees >
in the project; the heaviest so far j
was a seven-ton bay, the tallest a
30-foot tan-bark oak.
After the amphitheater has been
completed the tree-mover will be
far from a frozen asset. It can do '
I all the work of an ordinary winch
I with the added convenience of be- :
j ing portable. For any lifting or rais- !
ini{ jcb on the campus and for land- j
scaping work which goes on from
time to time, the tree-mover will be ,
i used. |
Originally planned by the manu- i
I f.ieturer for use on the level ground j
of plant nurseries, the machine has j
j been improved since its arrival by ;
| McDonnell to make it more flexible I
for use on steep slopes. Under his
direction the small unloading hand!
winch was added and other changes j
i were made on the tree-mover to j
! adapt it for use on the Stanford ,
| terrain.
