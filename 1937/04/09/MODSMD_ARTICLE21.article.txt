# Husky, Cal Teams Meet Card Track, Diamond Squads
## Stanford Nine Takes On Bear Players in Game Following Cinder Meet 
### ART ALLEN 
Stanford's baseball nine, fighling
determinedly for conference honors,
takes on Clint Evans' California
Bears here tomorrow afternoon in
the first of the annual three-game
series.
The game will be held up until the
end of the varsity track meet, en
abling the student body to see all of
the play.
Team Goes Scouting
Coach Harry Wolter has pro
nounced his team in fine condition
for the game, and is giving the team
the day off today to witness Cali
fornia-U.C.L.A. double-header at
Berkeley.
The Indians play the Bruins here
Monday, so the scouting information
will be doubly useful.
Starting Line-up
Wolter named the starting Indian
line-up yesterday, which has Leon
ard Linde, third baseman, leading
off, and Dick Tam, scrappy second
saclcer, in the number two spot.
Wally deWitt, the leading sticker
and right-fielder, wlil bat third,
and right-fielder, wlil bat third,
Verne Johnson, short stop and cen
ter-fielder, respectively.
Captain Darrell Holman, first
baseman; Dick Hanna, who made
the spectacular catch at Ryan Field
on Wednesday, as left-fielder; and
Leo Heagerty, the catcher who has
recently shaken a prolonged batting
slump, will hit sixth, seventh, and
eighth. Fred "Spike" Furman has
drawn the starting hurling assign
ment. If "Spike" can pitch up to
the standard he showed in the U.S.C.
game here last Saturday, the Indians
should come out on top.
On paper this game should be the
best of the season, with Stanford
an even money bet to win.
