that Jim Reynolds, who is still
away, placed in both former duals.

ferent from the last two, when 6

two weeks ago in the North, but
the know-it-all guys are picking
California as super-super this year.

mile, with Bob Alexander up against
Jim Angle. Both are at 4:20 and

doesn't rain.

In the half Captain Bill McCurdy
and Carl Mahurin will x - ace Vic

Maginni's Improving
Ed Burrows or Jack Beman, Coach.
Templeton doesn't know which, will
handle the two-mile against Dave
Maginnis, who was second Burrows
in Seattle last year, but who is
burning up the tracks this year with
improvement.
Weiershauser and Malott will race
the quarter against Jack Flagg and
Dick Montgomery, while Carey and
Hiserman will sprint against Bruce
Humber and Marion Hay, two- and
one-year veterans, respectively.

tween here and Seattle, the meet

the javelin and shot; student admis
sion will be free.
It'll be the rubber meet in the
present series for a number of
trackmen when Stanford meets
Washington tomorrow afternoon at
1:45 on Angell Field. In 1935 Hec
Edmundsen's Huskies took Stan
ford (58-63, and in 1936 Dink Tem
pleton's Cards took Washington 71-
60, with five of the Huskies' 20-man
team coming south having compet
ed in both former meets.
Brace Humber, sprinter; Vic
Palmason, half miler; Jim Angle,
miler; Bert Anschutz, hurdler; and
Jess Miller, javelin, all are three
year veterans, while the best that.
Stanford can say is that Rusty
March placed two years ago, and
that Jim Reynolds, who is still
away, placed in both former duals.
Mile, Half Races Best
Nothing seems to indicate that
this year will bring anything dif
ferent from the last two, when 6
points determined the winner. Cali
fornia drubbed Washington 73-58
two weeks ago in the North, but
the know-it-all guys are picking
California as super-super this year.
Best race of the day may be the
mile, with Bob Alexander up against
Jim Angle. Both are at 4:20 and
should smash records tomorrow if it
doesn't rain.
