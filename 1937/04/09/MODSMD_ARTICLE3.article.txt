# King, Queen To Rule 1937 Masque Ball
## 
### 
Stanford's Masque Ball will have
a king and queen!
The information that the dance,
which has annually climaxed the
Convalescent Home Drive, will
again feature the coronation of a
royal pair was disclosed last night
by Chairman Bob Mcßoskey, after
several meetings with the Masque
Ball committee.
Though Ex Committee and Wom
en's Conference last year ousted
the regal contest altogether and
have since repeatedly dinged fur
ther attempts at similar contests,
Mcßoskey said, the committee felt
that to discard the traditional rul
ers would be to take away too
much of the campus interest in the
ball itself. A loophole was found
that will keep the king and queen.
Further plans for the ball, which
will be held on April 23 in the bas
ketball pavilion, are rapidly being
completed. The theme, Mcßoskey
promises, will be divulged early
next week, as will other details of
the program.
