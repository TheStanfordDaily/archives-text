NOT ONE
IS SPLINTER
The baseball team fell into a four
game slump not so long ago, with
one loss to U.C.L.A., two in a row
to U.S.C., and one to St. Mary's.
That slump bid fair to be a disas
trous falter, but things have changed
again, since the boys beat U.S.C.
and Santa Clara, and now they can
take undisputed charge of the league
by knocking off California here to
morrow.
Now, that Cal game is the first of
the three-game series, and it is not
only a chance for the league lead,
but it is a Big Game. Here the
squad has a golden opportunity to
get the jump on the rest of the
teams, for what would be the first
C.1.8.A. title since 1931. The Sunk
en Diamond has a wonderful set of
bleachers. It has been so long that
the doggoned place has been filled
that the seats on the sunny side
must be getting terribly discour
aged.
The inference ought to be plain as
day — why doesn't everybody come
out and just naturally smother that
mess of bleachers tomorrow after
noon, right after the track meet?
Yeah, sunny seats and all.
ALL THE WAX
FROM WASHINGTON
The track men, too, wouldn't miss
having a good crowd out to see them
tangle with Washington. Of course,
the seating facilities aren't so ex
tensive as at the baseball field, but
there are quite a few. And there is
plenty of standing room, although
that admittedly is kind of hard to
take, for an hour or two.
The meet itself is going to be
well worth seeing, for sure. The
Huskies are bringing down a squad
that isn't going to be any pushover,
and it's going to be a little stronger,
probably, than when it lost to Cali
fornia two weeks ago, 73-58. The
return of Art Morgan, injured hurd
ler, Dave Maginnis, two-miler, and
the increased conditioning since
then should enable the Huskies to

' make things interesting.
Brutus Hamilton, Cal's track
; coach, saw Husky Vic Palmason
beat the best half-milers he had to
offer, and a couple of days ago he
said, via a San Francisco colum
nist, that Vic was going to beat
Bill McCurdy, Indian captain.
Well, Palmason is undoubtedly
good, but so is Mac, and Mac is in
his own element here, so he might
be able to give the northerner all
he wants. As far as that goes, may
be Hamilton was wrong in the first
place. From where Slantser sits, it
has looked that way for some time.
However, Slantser hasn't *seen
Palmason, and it is very doubtful if
Hamilton has seen McCurdy this
year, so maybe we'd better just
wait for the race.
IN THIS CORNER
WE HAVE—
If you don't want to stand up for
the track meet, which you will have
to do if you don't get there early,
you might drop over to the varsity
j tennis coui ts arid watch Lockwood
I and Co. match rackets with U.C.L.A.
The matches will start at 2 o'clock,
and they will be over when they're
I through, which will probably be
' somewhere around 6:00. They drag
i out for u long time —just ask Ed
j Barnett, manager — but nonetheless
' they do get under your skin at
times.
Once in u while you'll find a match
between two evenly balanced teams,
teams that are willing to play hard
j tennis all the way; and then is when
| tennis is really worth watching.
The way it looks now, there should
j be several such matches tomorrow,
■ so drop around if you enjoy good
tennis. You shouldn't be disap
pointed.
FRESHMEN HAVE
THEIR DAY
There will be a three-way attrac
tion in the morning, too, for the
1 freshman track, tennis, and baseball
i teams all have contests. The frosh
! ball club opens its Little Big Game
I series against the Bear Cubs, the
harriers harry against the Contra

Costa County All-Stars, and the
' netmen play.
j That track meet should be inter
| esting, for the Cal Frosh met the
| same outfit last week and it will
i give the only chance of the season
for comparison of times against a
single opponent. The Little Big ;
Game in baseball speaks for itself
—Harry Shipkey and Bob Grayson
have a pretty fair club out there; it
has shown steady improvement
from the start.
| GOOD! v. >
HE STAYS
It's all settled now, Genial John !

Bunn will .stay Ht Stanford. The
Kansas job, directorship of the ath
letic department, has been taken by
Gwinn Henry, football coach at the
University of New Mexico. The
job, as Bunn has outlined it, is a
tough one; it is not going to be an
easy matter for any men to handle
the situation.
However, it is no longer of con
cern to Stanford, since the Card
hoop coach is out of the tangle, so
the whole thing can be considered
as finished business, in shape for the
filing cabinet.

NOT ONE
IS SPLINTER
The baseball team fell into a four
game slump not so long ago, with
one loss to U.C.L.A., two in a row
to U.S.C., and one to St. Mary's.
That slump bid fair to be a disas
trous falter, but things have changed
again, since the boys beat U.S.C.
and Santa Clara, and now they can
take undisputed charge of the league
by knocking off California here to
morrow.
Now, that Cal game is the first of
the three-game series, and it is not
only a chance for the league lead,
but it is a Big Game. Here the
squad has a golden opportunity to
get the jump on the rest of the
teams, for what would be the first
C.1.8.A. title since 1931. The Sunk
en Diamond has a wonderful set of
bleachers. It has been so long that
the doggoned place has been filled
that the seats on the sunny side
must be getting terribly discour
aged.
The inference ought to be plain as
day — why doesn't everybody come
out and just naturally smother that
mess of bleachers tomorrow after
noon, right after the track meet?
Yeah, sunny seats and all.
ALL THE WAX
FROM WASHINGTON
The track men, too, wouldn't miss
having a good crowd out to see them
tangle with Washington. Of course,
the seating facilities aren't so ex
tensive as at the baseball field, but
there are quite a few. And there is
plenty of standing room, although
that admittedly is kind of hard to
take, for an hour or two.
The meet itself is going to be
well worth seeing, for sure. The
Huskies are bringing down a squad
that isn't going to be any pushover,
and it's going to be a little stronger,
probably, than when it lost to Cali
fornia two weeks ago, 73-58. The
return of Art Morgan, injured hurd
ler, Dave Maginnis, two-miler, and
the increased conditioning since
then should enable the Huskies to

' make things interesting.
Brutus Hamilton, Cal's track
; coach, saw Husky Vic Palmason
beat the best half-milers he had to
offer, and a couple of days ago he
said, via a San Francisco colum
nist, that Vic was going to beat
Bill McCurdy, Indian captain.
Well, Palmason is undoubtedly
good, but so is Mac, and Mac is in
his own element here, so he might
be able to give the northerner all
he wants. As far as that goes, may
be Hamilton was wrong in the first
place. From where Slantser sits, it
has looked that way for some time.
However, Slantser hasn't *seen
Palmason, and it is very doubtful if
Hamilton has seen McCurdy this
year, so maybe we'd better just
wait for the race.

It's all settled now, Genial John !

Bunn will .stay Ht Stanford. The
Kansas job, directorship of the ath
letic department, has been taken by
Gwinn Henry, football coach at the
University of New Mexico. The
job, as Bunn has outlined it, is a
tough one; it is not going to be an
easy matter for any men to handle
the situation.
However, it is no longer of con
cern to Stanford, since the Card
hoop coach is out of the tangle, so
the whole thing can be considered
as finished business, in shape for the

NOT ONE
IS SPLINTER
The baseball team fell into a four
game slump not so long ago, with
one loss to U.C.L.A., two in a row
to U.S.C., and one to St. Mary's.
That slump bid fair to be a disas
trous falter, but things have changed
again, since the boys beat U.S.C.
and Santa Clara, and now they can
take undisputed charge of the league
by knocking off California here to
morrow.
Now, that Cal game is the first of
the three-game series, and it is not
only a chance for the league lead,
but it is a Big Game. Here the
squad has a golden opportunity to
get the jump on the rest of the
teams, for what would be the first
C.1.8.A. title since 1931. The Sunk
en Diamond has a wonderful set of
bleachers. It has been so long that
the doggoned place has been filled
that the seats on the sunny side
must be getting terribly discour
aged.
The inference ought to be plain as
day — why doesn't everybody come
out and just naturally smother that
mess of bleachers tomorrow after
noon, right after the track meet?
Yeah, sunny seats and all.
ALL THE WAX
FROM WASHINGTON
The track men, too, wouldn't miss
having a good crowd out to see them
tangle with Washington. Of course,
the seating facilities aren't so ex
tensive as at the baseball field, but
there are quite a few. And there is
plenty of standing room, although
that admittedly is kind of hard to
take, for an hour or two.
The meet itself is going to be
well worth seeing, for sure. The
Huskies are bringing down a squad
that isn't going to be any pushover,
and it's going to be a little stronger,
probably, than when it lost to Cali
fornia two weeks ago, 73-58. The
return of Art Morgan, injured hurd
ler, Dave Maginnis, two-miler, and
the increased conditioning since
then should enable the Huskies to

' make things interesting.
Brutus Hamilton, Cal's track
; coach, saw Husky Vic Palmason
beat the best half-milers he had to
offer, and a couple of days ago he
said, via a San Francisco colum
nist, that Vic was going to beat
Bill McCurdy, Indian captain.
Well, Palmason is undoubtedly
good, but so is Mac, and Mac is in
his own element here, so he might
be able to give the northerner all
he wants. As far as that goes, may
be Hamilton was wrong in the first
place. From where Slantser sits, it
has looked that way for some time.
However, Slantser hasn't *seen
Palmason, and it is very doubtful if
Hamilton has seen McCurdy this
year, so maybe we'd better just
wait for the race.
IN THIS CORNER
WE HAVE—
If you don't want to stand up for
the track meet, which you will have
to do if you don't get there early,
you might drop over to the varsity
j tennis coui ts arid watch Lockwood
I and Co. match rackets with U.C.L.A.
The matches will start at 2 o'clock,
and they will be over when they're
I through, which will probably be
' somewhere around 6:00. They drag
i out for u long time —just ask Ed
j Barnett, manager — but nonetheless
' they do get under your skin at
times.
Once in u while you'll find a match
between two evenly balanced teams,
teams that are willing to play hard
j tennis all the way; and then is when
| tennis is really worth watching.
The way it looks now, there should
j be several such matches tomorrow,
■ so drop around if you enjoy good
tennis. You shouldn't be disap
pointed.
FRESHMEN HAVE
THEIR DAY
There will be a three-way attrac
tion in the morning, too, for the
1 freshman track, tennis, and baseball
i teams all have contests. The frosh
! ball club opens its Little Big Game
