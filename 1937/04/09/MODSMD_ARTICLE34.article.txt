LOS ANGELES, April 8 (UP).â€” |
Bob Nestell, undefeated young Cali- I
fornia heavyweight boxer, today ;
nursed a lacerated eye received in
training for his approaching bout i
with Lee Ramage. Nestell's manager :
said the cut was not sufficiently sc- |
rious to postpone the fight sched- I
uled for April 13.

Formerly it was against the law j
(carpet-bag) in Louisiana for any j
criminal or civil judge to try a freed I
man for any crime.
