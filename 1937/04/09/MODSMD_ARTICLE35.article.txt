## Indians Slight Favorites Over Berkeley Team Clarke, Needham, Rider, Winkelmann Expected To Take First Places 
### 
Stanford's sea-going Indians will
invade the Bear sanctuary tomor
row afternoon at 2 o'clock in an at
tempt to chalk up their twentieth
straight Big Meet swimming vic
tory over the California paddlers.
The undefeated Card varsity will
enter the meet as the favorite to
whip the fust-Improving Bear
squad.
Cal mermen have lost to the
Olympic Club, Fullerton J.C., and
U.C.L.A. Stanford had little trouble
whipping all three of these teams,
and it appeared several weeks ago
that the Bears were in for an awful
drubbing in the annual classic.
Bear Wakes Up
But something snapped last week
and the old Bear woke up before
he was drowned. He turned into a
terror in the water over night and
clawed the Trojans into a 41-34 up
set victory. Stanford onlj whipped
the Trojans 44-31, and lu.d to win
the final to do it,.
Stanford should take the 400-yard
freestyle relay with Tench, Mac-
Kenzie, Clarke, and Captain Sca
tena, and Cal should emerge vic
torious in the 300-yard medley
relay.
In the sprints—Dick Clarke should
win for the Indians in the 50 and
the 100 with Martin Scatena third
in the 50 and Alec MacKenzie sec
ond in the 100.
Cards Favored in 220
In the distances — Win Needham
should win the 220 in a close race
from Jim Shields of Cal, with Don
Peterson third. It will probably be
one-two for the Indians in the 440
with Dave Rider and Needham fin
ishing ahead of Shields.
In the specialties — Cal superior
ity here, with Don Towne of Stan
ford losing his first breast-stroke
race of the year to Jim Werson. In
the backstroke, Hal Weatherbe of
the aCrds, who has finished second
place in every meet this season,
should follow Roy Siem of the
Bears to the finish line.
And in the diving, Roy "Appolo"
Winkelmann, Card springboard art
ist de luxe, should wm over the
faltering Farqhuar of California.
