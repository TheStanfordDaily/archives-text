# Consistent Inconsistency
## 
### 
Inconsistency is essentially part of the hu
man animal. His reactions to similar things
in dissimilar moods are seldom similar. His
actions and thoughts reflect the feelings ot
the moment, and quite oiten disregard the
actions, thoughts, and feelings of the moment
past.
NOT a psych book preface, this, but irrele
vant observations of the bedraggled edi
torial writer trying to figure out why Stanford's
Ex Committee does things like it does.
Ex Committee officially shies at surveys. That
was obvious when last Tuesday night that body
passed a regulation that all surveys on the
Stanford campus must receive the committee
okay.
Still some of Ex Committee's main cogs —the
same cogs that voted for the regulation—are
carrying on one of the most extensive surveys
in the history of American universities. They
are surveying not only on Stanford's campus
but on 21 of the major campuses of the coun
try. They are surveying not only on student
politics, but on everything from immorality to
religion.
It's all groundwork for a book on American
student government by 14 Stanford student
leaders, under the direction of Dr. Harold Hand,
who are canvassing major campuses with care
fully drawn questionnaires, questionnaires
easily 50 pages in length which will bring in
formation for the writing of a first true cross
section of university life.
It's an admirable project, brilliantly handled.
Let Stanford be proud that its A.S.S.U. is financ
ing it.
But it does embody a survey, a gigantic
survey, a survey of the very kind its exponents
—leaders of Ex Committee—seek to oversee at
Stanford.
If every campus had the restriction it levied
early this week, compilation of the material
would be impossible.
The very thing Ex Committee seeks to super
vise must go unsupervised on the campuses
canvassed if the cross-section is to be valid.
So Ex Committee establishes its humanness
—-with a glaringly consistent case of inconsist
ency.—G. F.
Harvard, Yale, and the University of Chi
cago have the largest endowment funds of
any of the education institutions in the United
States. Harvard's fund totals $131,009,000,
Stanford's $45,750,000.
