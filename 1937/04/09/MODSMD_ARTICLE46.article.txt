THE new Assembly Hall is near enough com
pletion now so that a clear idea of what it
will look like when finished can be gained.
The electric wiring is being completed and the
plastering is well under way, and judging from
present indications the exersises of Senior
Week will be held there.
The building will be so near perfect in its
interior arrangements that it seems a pity the
architects did not think to provide more ade
quate means of exit to the gallery. The hall
will hold about 1700 people, 700 of whom will
be in the gallery, and the only means of escape
in case of panic is two narrow stairways not
more than a yard wide and with sharp turns.
It is to be hoped that no such panic will ever
occur, but in building such an auditorium it
would be well to provide for all contingencies,
especially if, as in the present case, the remedy
is not difficult. If the stairways were widened
to twice their present size nothing would be
lost and much would be gained.—The Daily
