# Love at First Sight

THE Nitery, Student Manager Chuck Fontius
told Ex Committee the other night, will be
finished "in a week or ten days."
"In a week or ten days," he admitted with a
smile, hardly means that, but it docs mean that
five months of more or less continual agitation
has ended. Stanford now has its long-sought
"night spot." Whether or not the Union Nitery
will ever be as successful as a place on the lake
is no longer the question.
The question now is, what can be done with
the Union Nitery to increase its appeal? Ob
viously the new recreation spot will quickly
become a dud if some active move is not taken
to dramatize the place, to plan activities which
will draw the crowds. .
Certain student leaders contended, when Ex
Committee was considering the various nitery
proposals, that the Union spot lacked the atmos
phere and brilliance of a first-class night spot.
Which, of- course, was and still is true. The Old
Union lobby, even though it has been redeco
rated and refurnished, will always be the Old
Union lobby to the majority of the campus
unless two or three student "showmen" are
soon given the reins.
Ex v Committee recognizes this need. Tues
day night Esther Pelton suggested giving the
job to the new officers elected next week. Be
sides putting the Nitery into capable hands, she
feels such work would get the new executives
into the swing of A.S.S.U. affairs.
But along with these new officers, who are
for the most part experienced only through
routine committee work, the Nitery Board needs
someone with a theatrical touch, a feel for
showmanship. The success of the Union Nitery
will turn on the campus' first reaction to it.
It must be "love at first sight."â€”D. B.
