STANFORD'S chaplain, who leaves us today,
said yesterday of ministers, fundamentally
this: Those who would "put out" to others must
have something valuable of their character to
give; further the storing of what they will have
to put out must take place away from the thou
sands of everyday demands on ministers. It
is his opinion that the members of the clergy
who diligently attend to the commonplace
chores may lack the character to be of real
service.
Teaching is a service proposition, just as the
ministry requires a life devoted to service.
Teachers, logically, must have something to
offer. But it does not follow logically that,
because a teacher once had something to offer,
he will always have something to offer. Dr.
Trueblood believes that ministers must take
time to think and study in seclusion from the
hub-bub, if they are to continue in service.
How badly many college professors need to
take time off from the chores to stock up on
something to offer beyond the textbook routine.
To be sure, educators are granted sabbatical
leave to do advanced work. Few are fortunate
enough in time of depression to find leaving
the job possible. In time of increasing enroll
ment, the institution can spare very few hands.
Advanced study requires real material sacri
fice for a year on the part of the college pro
fessor. Nevertheless, probably no single thing
would do more to improve instruction on a
college campus than a year of leave for study
for professors who have been pumped until
the well has run dry.
