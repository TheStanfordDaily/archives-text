# BULL SESSION
## EVERYONE'S GOT DOUBLE TROUBLE 
### 
After sitting back and listening to a group of
Stanfordites air their respective troubles, one begins
to wonder just what the hell is right with this
school.
No one seems to be just plain satisfied he is here,
that he is alive, that he has enough of papa's dough
to spend, that he was born to a position in life which
entitles him to stand up front when the bodies, heads,
and choice of using either or both articles was de
cided on.
* * * *
The Daily editor shouts and screams around and
everyone gets all steamed up and before long things
are in a fine sort of mess, including the Daily editor.
But that's all right because the Daily editor feels he
is doing the right thing. Maybe he is. Some people
don't think so.
The Bull Sessioners also think they know what is
wrong, not only with Stanford, but also with life,
the constitution, and God.
But. what I want to know is who tells off who
and why? Or who knows what troubles of mine need
solving when half the time I don't know myself.
* * * *
Not only does Women's Council feel it has the
solution to the problems of the collective Stanford
woman, but it also knows it and in no uncertain terms.
It sits back and tells the girls how and why they
should act until the girls are so worried they don't
know which way to turn. When' the council says,
"Jump!" the women are so scared they just turn
around with a frightened look on their faces and say,
"How far?"
In short it appears that the main trouble with this
school is that everyone is so interested in his own
troubles and problems he never looks around to see
if his problems arc really the same as those of his
fellows.
* * * *
Ex Committee has the strange idea that the laws
ihey pass and attempt to enforce will make life a lot
simpler for the students, but in reality they are not
making life simpler for the students but for them
selves.
The only trouble is, however, that if Ex Commit
tee doesn't watch out it'll probably pass a law out
lawing its own existence, which would or would not
be a relief.
I don't know what it's all about, but I wish I did.

everyone gets all steamed up and before long things
are in a fine sort of mess, including the Daily editor.
But that's all right because the Daily editor feels he
is doing the right thing. Maybe he is. Some people
don't think so.
The Bull Sessioners also think they know what is
wrong, not only with Stanford, but also with life,
the constitution, and God.
But. what I want to know is who tells off who
and why? Or who knows what troubles of mine need
solving when half the time I don't know myself.

Not only does Women's Council feel it has the
solution to the problems of the collective Stanford
woman, but it also knows it and in no uncertain terms.
It sits back and tells the girls how and why they
should act until the girls are so worried they don't
know which way to turn. When' the council says,
"Jump!" the women are so scared they just turn
around with a frightened look on their faces and say,
"How far?"
In short it appears that the main trouble with this
school is that everyone is so interested in his own
troubles and problems he never looks around to see
if his problems arc really the same as those of his
fellows.

Ex Committee has the strange idea that the laws
ihey pass and attempt to enforce will make life a lot
simpler for the students, but in reality they are not
making life simpler for the students but for them
selves.
The only trouble is, however, that if Ex Commit
tee doesn't watch out it'll probably pass a law out
lawing its own existence, which would or would not
be a relief.
I don't know what it's all about, but I wish I did.
