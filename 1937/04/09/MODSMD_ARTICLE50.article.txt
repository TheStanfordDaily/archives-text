The Editor, Sir:
Before I embark upon this tirade
let me say, for the benefit of those
who will be inclined to think dif
ferently, that I am in no way what
soever connected with the Stanford
Daily and its staff.
Ex Committee, congratulations!
While those alcoholic, subversive,
radicals, Reynolds and Mallett are
away, you have finally worked up
sufficient courage—it may have tak
en a terrific amount of courage—to
put on your most becoming horn
rimmed spectacles. All too long
have we suffered under the domi
neering liberalism of an uncensored
school paper. Under the beautiful
name of the "Stanford Daily" we
have allowed articles to be printed
that have undoubtedly been born in
the vile, communistic minds of the
Liquor Licentiators and the agents
of the San Francisco Vice Ring.
Furthermore, it is absolutely re
liably rumored that the whole staff
of the Daily spends every Monday,
Wednesday, and sometimes even
Saturday evening from 11 p.m. to
4 a.m. in the foulest and most lasciv
ious of drunken debauches.
At last we can be told what to
think and say by the W.C.T.U. and
the M.L.S.M. (Mothers' League for
Student Morality). Oh, Panacea!
Freedom of the Press has been an
illusion, especially in the United
States, ever since Daniel Webster
gave the first definition of the word
"censor," so let's snap out of the fog
of vicious, communistic free speech
and make it all illegal. Are we go
ing to allow a paper's articles to be
censored by the paper's own good
taste, and by the expression of ap
proval or disapproval of its readers
in the Campus Opinion columns?
Certainly not! How do the readers
of the paper know what they want,
anyway? We'll make them shut up.
We won't have anything nasty in
our paper, we won't!
