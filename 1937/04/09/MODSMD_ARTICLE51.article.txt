LONDON, April 8 (U.R). â€”'The ris
ing fears of Europe centered tonight
upon Venice Palace in Rome where
Premier Benito Mussolini, believed
near an open break with anti-Fas
cist France and Russia, pondered
difficulties confronting the Spanish
rebels.
Mussolini appeared to be laying
the groundwork for some bold
move as his puppet press condemned
what it termed "flagrant violations"
by France and Russia in support of
Spanish loyalists.
