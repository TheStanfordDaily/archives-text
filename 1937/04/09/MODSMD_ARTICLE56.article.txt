Waikiki Wedding (Paramount) is j
easy to take all way round: easy |
humor, easy acting, easy to look at,
easy to laugh at. Bing Crosby loafs
along, Shirley Ross looks right nice, |
and Martha Ray, Bob Bums, and I
the inimitable Wafford, porcinc j
find, spice the pace.
With a plot which is practically j
negligible, it is a collection of nice ,
people in nice scenery, with no one j
working too hard for any sort of J
effect. The music is the sort of stuff
that makes you remember it's spring
and wonder how much it costs to
go to Hawaii; you'll hear these songs |
a lot these days.
It's a show you'll like without
half trying. Take your gal along.
Her Husband's Secretary (Warner
Bros.) is the old wife-husband
secretary triangle boxed up again in
what turns out to be no wrapping
at all. It just takes longer for Jean
Muir (wife) to get to the scene
where her husband (Warren Hull)
slips with his secretary (Beverly
Roberts). And then they pull a j
continued-next-week stunt with a j
forest fire and other minor catastro- |
phies to whip things through. Oh
hum; though it could be worse.
A new Donald Duck is good stuff,
though.
Snakes have no sense of taste.
