# Students Write Text, Turn Tables on Profs
## Campus Leaders Write Book on Government 
### 
When profs write a book for stu- i
dents, that's $3.50. But whent stu- !
dents write a book for profs, that's j
news!
The news is being made by 14
campus leaders, members of the |
student government class, with the i
co-operation of 370 colleges and uni
versities and Dr. Harold Hand of ;
the School of Education. They're j
working on a book to be the first j
! word on 'American student govern- ■
ment. It's to be titled, "Student Ac- j
tivities in College" and will be pub- I
lished by the McGraw Hill Com- j
( pany next spring.
Beat Prof's Game
The news is happening because j
| members of the class got sick of :
talking about campus government
and got a hankering to read about
it. So they're beating the professors
at the professors' own game, and
writing a text for their own class
and others like it in other schools,
when, and if, they are organized.
Spade work on the project is ap
proaching completion on a $400 Ex
Committee grant made at the close of j
winter quarter.
Sets of twenty-one questionnaires
i have been sent student leaders in
j universities as far east as New
i York, as far South as Texas. They
range in pertinence from social ;
J conduct to publications; from stu
dent-alumni relations to religious
life. And they will provide the only 1
picture of what American students !
are doing in their own "School of ;
Experience."

"The idea is to determine tenden
cies in the growth of student gov- i
ernment in colleges," he explains, 1
"and to highlight certain problems ;
which we feel exist, but upon which
there are no concrete source mate- j
rial or conclusions.
"Naturally, we are working from !
j certain precepts of Tightness or I
j wrongness in government, such as
democracy, but our big job is to j
corral the facts, and to use our cri- j
j terions merely as a base line."

When profs write a book for stu- i
dents, that's $3.50. But whent stu- !
dents write a book for profs, that's j
news!
The news is being made by 14
campus leaders, members of the |
student government class, with the i
co-operation of 370 colleges and uni
versities and Dr. Harold Hand of ;
the School of Education. They're j
working on a book to be the first j
! word on 'American student govern- ■
ment. It's to be titled, "Student Ac- j
tivities in College" and will be pub- I
lished by the McGraw Hill Com- j
( pany next spring.
Beat Prof's Game
The news is happening because j
| members of the class got sick of :
talking about campus government
and got a hankering to read about
it. So they're beating the professors
at the professors' own game, and
writing a text for their own class
and others like it in other schools,
when, and if, they are organized.
Spade work on the project is ap
proaching completion on a $400 Ex
Committee grant made at the close of j
winter quarter.
Sets of twenty-one questionnaires
i have been sent student leaders in
j universities as far east as New
i York, as far South as Texas. They
range in pertinence from social ;
J conduct to publications; from stu
dent-alumni relations to religious
life. And they will provide the only 1
picture of what American students !
are doing in their own "School of ;
Experience."

"The idea is to determine tenden
cies in the growth of student gov- i
ernment in colleges," he explains, 1
"and to highlight certain problems ;
which we feel exist, but upon which
there are no concrete source mate- j
rial or conclusions.
"Naturally, we are working from !
j certain precepts of Tightness or I
j wrongness in government, such as
democracy, but our big job is to j
corral the facts, and to use our cri- j
j terions merely as a base line."
