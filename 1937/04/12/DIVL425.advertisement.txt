The Rodney
Arrow's conception of smartness is evidenced in the
RODNEY, a new style shirt, with a white collar and
white cuffs on a dark blue, burgundy, or grey chant
bra y body. The white collar in contrast to the
colored shirt and tie gives just the right necklinc
relief. For town-wear and semi-formal occasions,
ask for the Rodney. $2.50 with 2 separate collars.
