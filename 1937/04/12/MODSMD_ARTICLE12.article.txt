# Coronation Is Theme for Ball
## McRoskey Seeks London Sanction for Dance 
### 
With its sparkling crowns, color
i ful court ceremonies, and Mrs. Simp-
I sons lurking in the background, the
] Coronation has been chosen the
| (home for the 1937 Masque Ball,
j Democratic Farm roughs who pride
I themselves on informality and un
| shaved faces will put off their dirty
| cords and sweat shirts and turn
1 royal for the night of April 23, ac
| cording to the plans of the Masque
Ball Committee.
The rulers themselves—the King
I George and Queen Elizabeth of Stan-
I ford—will be chosen from the floor
I at the ball itself and presented in
j a skit, written by Walt Wickett, Bud
j Cady, and Bob Mallett.
Since the local coronation will pre-
I view the real event in England by
more than two weeks, the Ball
Committee, under the chairmanship
of Bob Mcßoskey, is now negotiat
ing to get official sanction and good
wishes from London for the night
of the dance.
Bids for the Masque Ball are $2.50
and will go on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office later in the week. The Masque
Ball Committee will meet tomor
row at 5 in the A.S.S.U. committee
rooms.
