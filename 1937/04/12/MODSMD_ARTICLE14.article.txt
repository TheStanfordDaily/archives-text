# Killer Sought By Police in Hit-Run Case
## Joe Stone, Sequoia Cook, Fatally Injured Early-Sunday on Highway 101 
### 
State Highway police were co
operating with the Sheriff's office
last night in a county-wide search
for a hit-run driver that they be
lieved killed Joe Stone, 32-year-old
Sequoia Hall cook, as he was walk
ing along El Camino Real early yes
terday morning.
Stone's body was found 350 feet
south of the Embarcadero at about
3:30 a.m. by John Lavlina, 750 Cor
nell Street. His left side crushed
and his skull fractured, Stone died
en I'oute to Palo Alto Hospital.
Murder First Theory
The search for a hit-runner was
instituted alter the collapse of evi
dence pointing to murder. Stone,
witnesses declared, had been seen
by Stanford students in Lee Wil
liams' restaurant, Mayfield, display
ing a large roll of currency.
Absence of skid marks on the
highway, and the condition of
Stone's body, strengthened belief
that the cook had been taken for a
ride. Later, employees at Williams'
resort declared Stone had been de
spondent and had expressed a wish
to "do away with himself." They
declared he had no money and had
borrowed a dollar to get home on.
South-hound Car
According to official reconstruc
tion of the accident, Stone had been
walking north on the highway and
had either wandered into the first
lane or turned to cross to the Palo
Alto side, when he was struck by a
south-bound car. This fact, police
said, was defnitely established by a
deep bruise on Stone's left leg, the
point of original impact. He might,
they declared, have deliberately
walked onto the highway in search
of death.
Stone's body was discovered with
its legs on the highway shoulder, the
rest of his body on the pavement.
Blood on the first white line indi
cated he had rolled about fifteen
feet after being struck.
The body was taken by Palo Alto
police to the Roller and Hapgood
funeral parlors, there awaiting claim
by relatives declared to be living in
the East.
