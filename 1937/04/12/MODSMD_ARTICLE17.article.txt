# B.A.C. Chairman Predicts $15,000 Deficit in 1937-38
## Restoration of Salary Cuts, Building Improvements Cause Shortage In Next Years Budget 
### 
Proverbially an inexhaustible fountain of gold, Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control faces a $15,000 deficit, the first since the depression struck,
according to its statements of estimated income and expenditure for
1937-38.
Estimated returns for the coming year total about $365,000, estimated
expenses about $.'580,000, Finance Committee Chairman J. W. llowell re
ported.
The unbalanced budget, according to Alfred 11. Masters, graduate man
ager, is a simple indication that the B.A.C. is spending more than its income
justifies.
"We're carrying too big a load, constantly expanding our activities »n
the face of rising prices," he deciaretT. Immediate causes of the present

► deficit, Chairman Howell pointed
! out, were restoration of salary cuts
i and financing of business improve
ments.
The Board will balance its budget
possibly through one of four alter
natives presented at its meeting last
! week:
(1) Reduction of the B.A.C.
grant to the School of Physical
Education.
(2) A 10 per cent cut in all de
partments.
(3) Payment of interest only on
a $25,000 interest-plus-capital in
stallment on Branner Hall.
(4) "Trusting the future for a
I solution."
Which of the alternatives would
least curtail the Board's activities
: will be decided at the next meeting
1 in May.
Opposing the reduction of the
School of Physical Education grant
j was Registrar J. P. Mitchell, who
pointed out that graduates of the
j school act as Stanford's athletic am
; bassadors, "talent-getters" for Uni
versity teams. They are entitled to
| consideration by the Board, though
; it is concerned purely with school
I athletics, not teacher-training, he
j contended.
Hits Reduction
"These men, sent out as teachers,
do an untold amount in building
i Stanford teams," he declared. "High
school coaches are with athletes dur
ing their leisure hours, and exert a
powerful influence upon them. To
! reduce the grant to the School of
Physical Education would be directly
| reducing Stanford's chances of get
i ting top-notch athletic material."
The 10 per cent blanket cut would
| be the "last resort," the Board in-
I dicated.
Payment of only a $7500 interest
j charge, instead of a $25,000 install -
! ment plus interest, on Branner Hall
is a likely legal "out" for the Board,
it was declared. Payments are now
! two installments ahead.
Income Wavers
; The Board's income has wavered
between a low of approximately
I $226,100 in 1923-24 to a high of about
$517,700 in 1928-29. Deficits, the
j result of new construction, were
encountered in 1924-25, 1926-27,
1927-28, 1928-29, with an all-time
high of about $121,600 in 1929-30.
Since 1922, the Board has spent
almost $2,000,000 on construction,
• most on athletic facilities, of a total
expenditure of about $5,290,000.

justifies.

The Board will balance its budget
possibly through one of four alter
natives presented at its meeting last

(1) Reduction of the B.A.C.
grant to the School of Physical
Education.
(2) A 10 per cent cut in all de
partments.
(3) Payment of interest only on
a $25,000 interest-plus-capital in
stallment on Branner Hall.
(4) "Trusting the future for a
I solution."
Which of the alternatives would
least curtail the Board's activities
: will be decided at the next meeting
1 in May.

pointed out that graduates of the

"These men, sent out as teachers,
do an untold amount in building
i Stanford teams," he declared. "High
school coaches are with athletes dur
ing their leisure hours, and exert a
powerful influence upon them. To

Physical Education would be directly

Payment of only a $7500 interest

Income Wavers
; The Board's income has wavered
between a low of approximately
I $226,100 in 1923-24 to a high of about
$517,700 in 1928-29. Deficits, the
j result of new construction, were
encountered in 1924-25, 1926-27,
1927-28, 1928-29, with an all-time
high of about $121,600 in 1929-30.
Since 1922, the Board has spent
almost $2,000,000 on construction,
• most on athletic facilities, of a total
expenditure of about $5,290,000.
Proverbially an inexhaustible fountain of gold, Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control faces a $15,000 deficit, the first since the depression struck,
according to its statements of estimated income and expenditure for
1937-38.
Estimated returns for the coming year total about $365,000, estimated
expenses about $.'580,000, Finance Committee Chairman J. W. llowell re
ported.
