# Harper's Give Chinese Novel Present Title
## Pre-Publication Revision Cuts Length, Deletes Chinese Terminology 
### HERBERT ALWARD, JR 
"Son of Han," title of Richard La-
Piere's novel on 19th century China,
was not chosen from the author's
list of 50 or more suggestions, but
was written by the president of
Harper and Brothers, publishers of
the volume.
When LaPiere had finished his
fifth draft of the novel, then called
"Black Jade," he decided that it
would not serve a purpose as fiction
or as sociological material, and put
it on a shelf. However, 1 a Chinese
friend of his, Mr. Pardee Lowe, who
was brought up in San Francisco's
Chinatown, took it to New York,
where he had accepted a position
with the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions.
Length Cut
Prepared for a battle with all the
] Ã¼blishers in New York, Mr. Lowe
./as surprised to find that Harpers,
. rst one on his list, accepted the
: jok within a month. An agreement
as made, conditional to several
\ langes.
First on the list of revisions was
request that the book be cut about
, vo-fifths, or 100,000 words. This
\ as intended to improve the book
l,>r the average reader.
Chinese Terms
Another cause for complaint by
] arpers was the use of Chinese
1 rms of linear, monetary, and time
i easurement. The Chinese league
o "Li," it seems, is longer uphill
tl :tn down. While the publisher's
;i; ent agreed to the logic, he thought
some English approximation would
b. more suitable.
Then there arose the matter of
de notation of kinship. The Chinese,
according to Mr. LaPiere, have a
much more descriptive method of
speaking of or to a relative; to
H; rpers, the fact that "Tau-Dee"
meant "Father's younger brother's
son who is younger than I" and "that
it held certain sociological connota
tions was comparatively unimport
ant and did not justify the use of so
much Chinese terminology.
"When the book was returned the
first time," said Mr. LaPiere, "I was
preparing to go South to teach dur
ing summer quarter. The work was
completed in three weeks. That was
not the only revision. There was
tine other. Altogether, there were
seven drafts")of the book."
