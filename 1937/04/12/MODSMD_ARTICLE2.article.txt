SUSAN JUNIOR, typical Convalescent Home
kiddie, goes through a typical day. (Above) Six
o'clock is getting up time at the home and it finds
Susy ready lo go, her hair ribbon already tied.
Then (upper center), she hits the books for a
while in the morning. Sometimes before she goes
to bed she finds time for a little extra-curricular
activity (lower center). Perhaps it's the Stanford
influence. And then to bed (right). It's seven
o'clock, lights out at the home and Susy wants no
lockout.—Photos by Tro Harper and John Rice.

CHAIRMAN JEEB lIALABY, marshalling his
forces for the opening of the Convalescent Home

heads will meet in the Ex Committee room in the
Old Union. At five, women speakers will meet in
the same place. Halaby asked for a full turnout,
emphasizing that these will be the final meetings
in which to perfect plans for the Drive.
