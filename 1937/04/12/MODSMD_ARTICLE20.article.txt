### 
Stanford's second-string poloists
proved it wasn't luck last Wednes
day when they defeated the Univer
sity of Utah four 8-2 by coming
back Friday to hand the Utes an 8-1
lacing Friday afternoon on the
Highway field.
Hyde, McAusland and Wallace,
playing the first three positions for
the Cards, scored two goals apiece,
with McClintock, No. 4, scoring one.
The eighth Indian score was inad
vertently tapped through by Lowe,
Utah No. 2, during a scuffle with
Hyde directly in front of the Card
goalposts.
Wilken, Utah No. 4, scored the sole
Utah goal. Remainder of the Ute
lineup was Von Cannon, No. 1; Wil
liams, No. 3; and Ted Cannon, sub
stitute No. 2.
The silver fox, black fox, and
cross fox are all red foxes.
