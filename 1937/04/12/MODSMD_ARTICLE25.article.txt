One can get a tan quicker and \
\ easier in spring on "corn" snow |
: than on the beach. This is one of
the many features offered members
I of the newly formed Ski Club, which
s has just returned from a successful
i outing in Yosemite.
According to Lester Lewis, head J
' of the club, there will be skiing for '
a good poi'tion of spring quarter,
providing members with opportu
nity for several outings.
Reduced Kates Offered
The most popular resorts for club |
skiing are Yosemite, Nordan, Cisco, j
Soda Springs, Mt. Lassen, and Mt.
Shasta. Some of Stanford's best ski
ers include Ernst Meyer of Switzer
land; Jack Osborne and Johnny
Pease, Portland; Lester Lewis, Se
attle; Ed Gudewell, Canada; and
Bill Jans, who took second place in |
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates.
Among the club's are re- ;
duced rates given to members wher- '
' ever they go. Where an ordinary '
person would have to pay $15 to I
$25 for a half-way enjoyable week- 1
I end, Ski Club members get all this '
j plus a good time and first class ;

j instruction, all for about $8 a week
| end.
Aim for Sanction

Stanford skiing on the same plane as
! that of other universities. Skiing is
a recognized minor spoi't at most
| colleges on the coast.
If the activity can become B.A;C.
! sanctioned, it will be possible to gain
the services of an excellent coach to
irain skiers, thus giving Stanford a
chance to take a good many tourna
ments, whereas now, because >of
j lack of coaching, entrants to col
legiate tourneys come in behind
| schools they could easily beat oth
| erwise.
