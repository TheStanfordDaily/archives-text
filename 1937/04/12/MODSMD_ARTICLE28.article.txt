Lawrence Tibbett needs no in
troduction to Stanford University
for his voice is well known through
the movie, radio, and the concert
stage.
Mr. Tibbett gained recognition
through his success in singing the
part of Ford in Verdi's "Falstaff" at
the Metropolitan opera, while his
present great popularity may be at
tributed to his perfect tone, his fin
ished diction, and his almost uncan
ny sense of dialect.
