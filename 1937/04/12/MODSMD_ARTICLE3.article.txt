# Survey Censorship Hit By 8 of 14 Candidates
## 
### 
A majority of candidates running for Ex Committee posts in tomorrow's
election want complete freedom of the press on the Stanford campus.
Questioned last night, eight candidates, including both presidential
nominees, opposed Ex Committee's ruling last Tuesday that all campus
. —♦surveys should have the Commit-

J tee's sanction.
Against Regulation
i A.S.S.U. presidential candidates
John Dern and Tom Killefer both
j came out strongly against such reg
ulation in so far as it affects The
Daily.
Said Killefer: "Ex Committee's
) survey ruling was undue restriction
i of the press, not complying with the
| basic idea of student government.
' Counsel of the Journalism Depart -
1 ment should be adequate."
j Dern emphasized that "Ex Com
mittee should not control,directly
what goes into the paper; that
should be the job of the editor. Let
I the editor control the policy of the
I paper, and Ex Committee where
! necessary control the editor."
"Anti-Friction" Committee
Besides those who favored or op
i posed the survey regulation ruling
I there were two who wanted forma
! tion of an "anti-friction" committee
! to be composed of representatives
,of both Ex Committee and The
j Daily. Gretchen Reinemund and
j Barbara Murphy both felt that such
, a body would iron out any present
difficulties and take up less of Ex
■ Committee's time.
i Opponents of survey regulation
included the following: >
Lylc Cook: "There should be no
j regulation - except in cases where
i surveys concerned social life of the
j students."
Bob Garrctson: "Surveys should
1 be left up to the editor, although Ex
i Committee should rebuke him when
! necessary."
Mark Hopkins: "Surveys should
be left to the discretion of the edi
' tor."
Phil Klaubcr: "Ex Committee
I should suggest, but not regulate."
Jane Schumacher: "Ex Committee
! should have more important matters
j upon which to spend its time."
Tempi*; Wanainaker: "There
should be no Ex Committee regula
tion unless the results of the poll are
to be sent to off-campus publica
tions."
The following candidates upheld
the regulation:
Jean Bird: "Surveys should be
I regulated because they can bring
I Stanford adverse publicity."
Eleanor Hatch: "I think it is a good
idea to have Ex Committee look
! I hem over."
Jan North: "There should be some
censorship, because everybody in
the school is concerned."
Anahcl Simpson: "I think they
should be okehed by Ex Committee."
Fred Williams: "As a member of
Ex Committee now, I favor the
i measure."
