# Indian Track Team Crushes Huskies, 80-50
## Humber, Palmason Star For Invaders; Cards Reveal New Promise 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Showing marked improvement [
over last week's efforts against the i
Olympic Club, Coach Dink Temple- ]
ton's tracksters scored an 80-50 win i
over the University of Washington i
Huskies on Angel! Field Saturday.
The peculiar point total came from j
I the pole vault, where no third was i
' recorded; in that both teams were |
; limited to 20 men, Coach Hec Ed-
I mundson and Templeton matched |
| wits at doubling their men and
I events, from which resulted several
I very strange third places.
Ilumher Stars
Stanford won nine first places,
j while Washington took five; Bruce
I Ilumber, the Huskies' Olympic vet
| eran, took both sprints to become the
j only double winner of the day, scor
; ing times of 9.3 and 21.8, the best
j marks turned in on the local track
this year.
| Jack Weiershauser was Stanford's
best man, taking a first and second
j and a lap on the winning relay
team. His 23.7 in the low hurdles,
j two of which he knocked over inci
dentally, stands as the best time done
around here since Klopstock's jun
| ior year.
Palmason Wins
The other good one was the half,
'in which Vic Palmason, veteran
j husky, beat Captain Bill McCurdy
j by six yards in 1:53 flat, decidedly a
! big time performance. McCurdy
! was timed in 1:53.9, a new low for
| him.
j Stanford backers should be con
siderably encouraged this week by:
J (1) The relay team's 3:16.8, soon
; after Malott and Hyde had run 48.3
j and 48.8 in the straight quarter
j mile; (2) Alexander's work in the
I long distances, both of which Ke
' might have won had he taken his
j first race easily.
