# Annual Alumni Conclave Ends
## Cathcart Gives Talk On Court Controversy 
### 
"Roosevelt may not want to be a I
dictator but he does like to dictate," j
said Professor A. M. Cathcart of the
law school yesterday in a speech ad
dressed to alumni attending the fifth
annual Stanford alumni conference.
Speaking on the current contro- :
versy between Congress and the Su- !
prernc Court, Cathcart asserted that j
to give Congress judicial rights !
would be radical and revolutionary ;
and against our constitutional stand- !
arris. Such action might prove to be j
disastrous during time of crisis, he I
said, and a dictatorship might eas- I
ily emerge.
Durand Is Speaker
Safety in the air was predicted in
the early future by Dr. William F. ;
Durand, emeritus professor of me- \
chanical engineering, who spoke on j

made in the field of navigation j
equipment, improved ground serv- !
cies, and the use of multiple en- ;
gines, said Dr. Durand.
