# We Decided Not to Write This
## 
### 
SOMEBODY asked yesterday why we didn't
scream about impending "censorship" of
The Daily.
Somebody said they v/ere afraid big name
bands might be restricted at Stanford.
Somebody wanted us to cry against the cur
rent amendment limiting the positions a Stan
fordite can hold.
People wanted us to revolt at these things.
We hesitated because such revolt meant an
other gripe at Ex Committee. We're tired of
panning Ex Committee. No longer is it either
novel or fun.
We tried to find a way to say that Ex Com
mittee was basing too much of its action on
the precept that "lightning strikes twice."
We tried to explain the foolishness of the
belief that because one survey was said to
bring ill-fame to Stanford all surveys needed
examination. We tried to point out that next
time ill fame is brought, no survey will be
responsible; that next time it'll be an alienation
of affections suit, or a student strike.
Because the Junior Prom and the Senior Prom
conflicted on big - name bands this year, Ex,
Committee concludes that it will happen every
year, and considers limiting the big-name bands
in the future. This move would dim Stanford's
greatest lure for keeping Stanfordites at home,
despite the fact that scarcity of name bands ob
tainable at a suitable figure makes over-presen
tation impossible.
Lightning probably.won't strike the band situ
ation next year.
And on this amendment question we had
already advocated a "no" vote despite un
avoidable mention of "Ex Committee."
So we thought the matter over, but couldn't
figure out a way to urge against too much future
legislation. Lightning seldom strikes twice, we
contended, but if it should, there might be an
other Ex Committee to do something.
So we tried to figure out a way to say all these
things without carrying on this day-to-day poke
at our conscientious rulers.
But we were bored with petty arguing, so we
finally decided not to write it at all.—G. F.
