A BOMB went off on the baseball field last
Saturday. The smoke is gone now, and
California has pulled its 2-1 victory out of the
debris, and Stanford finds that it has reason to
laugh at the explosion rather than rue it. Cali
fornia probably thought it was fun too.
Baseball lends itself to an occasional battle.
It's part of the picnic to razz the pitcher, boo
decisions and throw in a good fight once in a
while. It's the thing to do.
However, such blasts if venomous have no
place in any athletics. This one was in fun.
Naturally, while the bomb was bursting, there
were some ired tempers, but when the ball
game was over, red and blue uniforms wan
dered out together, happy, almost glad it hap
pened. Opponents talked over missed and
landed blows. Everyone laughed.
Not to be recommendod every game is this
procedure.
Not to be completely regretted is this bomb
shell to blast Stanford baseball out of the rut. â€”
