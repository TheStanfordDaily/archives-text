# Wrong Law for No Crime

EX COMMITTEE is asking the student body
tomorrow for a new power which it does
not need and should not have.
Tacked onto the general ballot is the proposal
that "Ex Committee shall have power to adopt
rules regarding the number of offices and posi
tions which any one student may hold."
Proposed some time ago by President Rey
nolds "to solve the problem of a few students
monopolizing A.S.S.U. offices," the constitu
tional amendment was drawn up by an Ex
Committee subcommittee after an "investiga
tion" had discovered that no such problem ex
isted.
Ex Committee figured that as long as it had
gone to the trouble to "investigate," it might as
well pass a ruling for the future, just in case.
Like most "just-in-case" legislation, further
ado about this proposal wastes the time of
both Ex Committee and the student body, and
if passed would confuse and clutter the al
ready-confused-and-cluttered A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion.

On the other hand, even if there were cases
of one person holding more than one student
body position, should such situations be pre
vented? Should quality be sacrificed for quan
tify?
Even now there is a premium upon ability
in A.S.S.U. affairs. There has always been only
a limited number of students who are willing
and capable enough to handle student-body
jobs successfully.
And if a position is big enough to take all a
student's extracurricular time and talent, he
will need no A.S.S.U. ruling to keep him from
another position. The fact that there are cur
rently no duplications in major offices seems to
bear this out.
Therefore the proposed amendment to Ar
ticle 11, Section 2, should be defeated because,
in short, it is the wrong solution to a problem
that isn't there. —D. B.
