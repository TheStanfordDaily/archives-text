# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
A LARGE Breaker who throws things pours water
at campus conflagrations for the benefit of the
campus fire department. As is the customary pro
cedure with the campus fire hashers, the large Breaker
took out one of the fire trucks to exercise it one Sun
day afternoon, but contrary to the usual procedure,
the truck ran out of gas right in front of Lagunita.
The Memorial Church choir yesterday morning
found its attention wandering from "Present Tenden
cies in Religious Thought." One of the lady choir
members had a book, "How to Get Your Man and
Hold Him." She claimed it was outside reading for
two courses she was taking: Football Coaching Meth
ods and Criminology.
EVERYBODY thinks that the campus service sta
tion just provides fuel, oil, and grease, but in
reality it is an eleemosynary institution.
For one thing, it provides jobs for men who play
football and men who do not play football. It shells
out free air, free water, and free speech. It gives
service with a motto, and it plays ball without asso
ciated, but with the organized semi-pro fire laddies
next door.
Final, conclusive proof, however, that it is an elee
mosynary institution is the incontrovertible fact that
it can't seem to make much money.
Tiny Month of the Buckkeeper and Chronicle sports
reporter Tom Irwin, to whose favorite charity the serv
ice station is supposed to be charitably inclined was
down on the campus last fall to see what he could do
about it.
TT SEEMED to sell gasoline and oil just like other
service stations. However, he went home again
afraid that it was just too eleemosynary for the stu
dents.
The only time the station has made money is the
month that Bill Stark, last year's manager, forgot to
pay himself his salary.
The Committee for Kitchen Disorganization struck
the campus again over the week-end, when a labor
hating, Quad-loying, dog-trotting Johnny, Toro's low
est candidate for Stanford's highest position, started a
counter-revolutionary assault on striking hashers by
slinging pies. The Committee for Kitchen Disorganiza
tion struck the campus and it struck the dern fool.
