REAL COLLITCII STUFF

Before the incident of Heloise, the Drake Univer
sity girl in the shower bath, has passed completely out
of mind, I would like to do a service to such historians
of modern collegiana as College Humor, Hollywood,
and the American Weekly.
I intend to expose all about collcge, in short, tear
aside the veil that hides wicked doings from the light
and give the true and unashamed picture of one day
at our modern institutions for sending our children to
the dogs. .
* * * *
Day breaks over the "frat" house early in the morn
ing, but by 11 o'clock all the "frat" boys—except one
grind with spectacles who got up at 5:00 to prepare
for his philosophy class—are sound asleep in a com
plete alcoholic fog. By 12, though, there are stirrings,
and when at noon the cook brings up a great five
gallon jug filled with gin and orange juice, all the
boys jump up eagerly and down it with great gusto.
The boys get up and look out the windows at the
scene on the lawn of the sorority house next door. All
the "co-eds" are lounging about in their lingerie,
looking like Petty women as they slink voluptuously
hither and yon. Three or four boys, wearing striped
"jazz coats" are seated comfortably in the midst of
the melee, playing ukcleles and sucking on ivory cig
arette holders. Out in front a "flivver' is parked. On
it are painted signs—"chickens, here's your coop," etc.
The n's arc backwards.
At class, there arc also great goings-on. The stu
dents file in shouting and laughing, while the professor,
wearing mortar-board and gown, stalks in and calls
the class to order in a dry, precise voice. But the
girls jump up on the desk, throw off their skirts re
vealing chorus-girl costumes start doing a tap dance,
an orchestra strikes up some collitch rhythm and soon
the class seems to have increased to 1500 girls doing a
Busby Berkeley routine on a whirling Warner Bros,
set.
The professor is astounded and stomps off in a huff,
but one of the sweet, things woh wants her flunk in
astronomy raised to an A goes after him. She corners
him in his office, pats his head and strokes his whiskers.
She sits upon his lap— (But I cannot, for shame, tell
you dear readers ALL. See Collcge Humor for de
tails.) After a while he escorts her to the door. He
is covered with lipstick and says, "I think it can be
arranged."
sft $ «!: !]<
The afternoon is spent in tearing around in super
charged Dusenbergs from one cocktail parly to an
other. The gin-mad students perch all over the fenders
and rumble scat, necking furiously and shouting, whee,
whoopie, as they dash at 90 miles per hour past the
Dean's house. The Dean waves his black umbrella at
them.
Evening finds the boys and girls at a wild party at
a mountain resort, but on this particular form of col
legiate sin I cannot report right now. I have to go out
with the business manager of the college newspaper
and the captain of the football team. We are going
down to Mike's roadhouse to meet some gamblers.
The business manager is going to gamble away
funds he embezzled from the newspaper's coffers, and
the captain of the team is going to get five grand for
"throwing" next Saturday's game.

REAL COLLITCII STUFF

Before the incident of Heloise, the Drake Univer
sity girl in the shower bath, has passed completely out
of mind, I would like to do a service to such historians
of modern collegiana as College Humor, Hollywood,
and the American Weekly.
I intend to expose all about collcge, in short, tear
aside the veil that hides wicked doings from the light
and give the true and unashamed picture of one day
at our modern institutions for sending our children to
the dogs. .
* * * *
Day breaks over the "frat" house early in the morn
ing, but by 11 o'clock all the "frat" boys—except one
grind with spectacles who got up at 5:00 to prepare
for his philosophy class—are sound asleep in a com
plete alcoholic fog. By 12, though, there are stirrings,
and when at noon the cook brings up a great five
gallon jug filled with gin and orange juice, all the
boys jump up eagerly and down it with great gusto.
The boys get up and look out the windows at the
scene on the lawn of the sorority house next door. All
the "co-eds" are lounging about in their lingerie,
looking like Petty women as they slink voluptuously
hither and yon. Three or four boys, wearing striped
"jazz coats" are seated comfortably in the midst of
the melee, playing ukcleles and sucking on ivory cig
arette holders. Out in front a "flivver' is parked. On
it are painted signs—"chickens, here's your coop," etc.
The n's arc backwards.
At class, there arc also great goings-on. The stu
dents file in shouting and laughing, while the professor,
wearing mortar-board and gown, stalks in and calls
the class to order in a dry, precise voice. But the
girls jump up on the desk, throw off their skirts re
vealing chorus-girl costumes start doing a tap dance,
an orchestra strikes up some collitch rhythm and soon
the class seems to have increased to 1500 girls doing a
Busby Berkeley routine on a whirling Warner Bros,
set.
The professor is astounded and stomps off in a huff,
but one of the sweet, things woh wants her flunk in
astronomy raised to an A goes after him. She corners
him in his office, pats his head and strokes his whiskers.
She sits upon his lap— (But I cannot, for shame, tell
you dear readers ALL. See Collcge Humor for de
tails.) After a while he escorts her to the door. He
is covered with lipstick and says, "I think it can be
arranged."
sft $ «!: !]<
The afternoon is spent in tearing around in super
charged Dusenbergs from one cocktail parly to an
other. The gin-mad students perch all over the fenders
and rumble scat, necking furiously and shouting, whee,
whoopie, as they dash at 90 miles per hour past the
Dean's house. The Dean waves his black umbrella at
them.
Evening finds the boys and girls at a wild party at
a mountain resort, but on this particular form of col
legiate sin I cannot report right now. I have to go out
with the business manager of the college newspaper
and the captain of the football team. We are going
down to Mike's roadhouse to meet some gamblers.
The business manager is going to gamble away
funds he embezzled from the newspaper's coffers, and
the captain of the team is going to get five grand for
"throwing" next Saturday's game.
