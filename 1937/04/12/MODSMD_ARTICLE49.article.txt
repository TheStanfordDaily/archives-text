# THE 						REVIEWER
## "MAYTIME" 
### 
Paeans in praise for M-G-M's ver
sion of Sigmund Romberg's MAY
TIME. Not only does this operetta
show Jeanette McDonald and Nelson
Eddy at their best; it also offers
John Barrymore's sensitive acting.
Exceedingly romantic in theme,
MAYTIME has its lighter moments
in such spots as the Parisian street
scene in which Nelson Eddy sings,
"I will give you ham and eggs, Vir
ginia ham and Eggs" to the familiar
strains of "Cara Nome." This novel
ham and eggs aria has its finale in
a cafe as its tune changes to the
"Anvil Chorus," which is beat out
on wine and beer bottles.
Like all movies featuring noted
singers, MAYTIME has everything
fiom the Page Song of the opera
"Les Hugenots" to a fiictional opera,
"Tsaritza," the tune of which is
based on Tschaikowsky's "Fifth
Symphony."
Photographically, MAYTIME is
replete with beautiful camera shots
which perforate the show with
mellow color tones of rotogravure
like quality.
In fact, the picture is most con
vincing throughout, and is something
no one should miss. The sets are
admirably and authentically done.
Perhaps the most commendable
thing about MAYTIME is that al
though it is two hours in length, in
no sequence does it drag. Even a
Palo Alto audience clapped at the
end—and not in relief.—Moses.
