# "IN SHAFT 7"
## 
### 
Competing in the "unpublished
plays" division of the Northern Cal
ifornia Drama Association Tourna
ment, Stanford's Masquers present
ed an original one-act. play by Herb
Diamond, Stanford junior, last
Thursday night. The contest, held
in the Women's Clubhouse in San
Francisco, was won by the presenta
tion of the Richmond Traveling
Players; no second place was
awarded.
Herb Diamond's "In Shaft 7" tells
of one man's fight against horrible
working conditions of the coal
mines, and against the cause of
those conditions, the mine owner.
Told for the most part in a clear
cut, vivid manner, the drama is
packed with action which is as
forceful when seen through the
e} r es and description of those on the
stage as when it actually takes place
there. Occasionally too wordy, the
dialogue is natural, has impact and
color; only flaw is lack of pointing to
make the end effective. It is a piece
of work which has few traces of
amateurism.
George Wood, as Brad, was out
standing in a total performance
which was uniformly excellent and
marred only by occasional shaking
of lines. As Thornton, Owen Clarke

handled the job of portraying fear |
without becoming maudlin. Con
sistent and restrained characteriza- 1
tion heightened drama. To Jean
Clary go honors as director for
shaping an effective, closely-knit
performance.
The complete cast was as fol
lows: Martha, Virginia Rogers; ;
Brad, George Wood; Rook, J. P. 1
Kahn; Thornton, Owen Clarke; j
Slake, Clarence A. Spaulding.
