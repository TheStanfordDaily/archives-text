She was awful thin but at last she
I was better and was sent over to the j
1 runabouts. Then Santa Claus and t
i the boy Scouts came on Christmas \
\ morning and gave her lots and lots j
of toys. She stayed about a month ;
I more and then when she was all !
! better she went home. She said to j
j her Mother, "The best Christmas J
j present that I got was from the Stan- j
j ford Convalesent Home because j

* * *
j I hope they make me well to.
When I go to the Big ward there

Once upon a time there was a lit -
j tie girl named Betty. Now Betty
1 was a poor little girl and she knew
1 she would not get much presents for
| Christmas and she was always get
ting sick so her Mother sent her to
the Stanford Convalesent Home.
"They Made Me Well"
She was awful thin but at last she
I was better and was sent over to the j
1 runabouts. Then Santa Claus and t
i the boy Scouts came on Christmas \
\ morning and gave her lots and lots j
of toys. She stayed about a month ;
I more and then when she was all !
! better she went home. She said to j
j her Mother, "The best Christmas J
j present that I got was from the Stan- j
j ford Convalesent Home because j
| they made me well."
* * *
j I hope they make me well to.
When I go to the Big ward there
1 will be lots of fun and there will be
1 a show on every Saturday and we
| will go to the sunporch and maybe
j have a picnic in the garden to. Pic
nics must be very fun.
I I dont know what to say anymore
but I guess I can say goodby.
Losts of love,
Your little sister
P.S. Please dont forget to come
next Saturday. Goodby.
