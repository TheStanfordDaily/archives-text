# Survey Issue Rehash Still Up in Air
## More Hash Is Result As Editor Adds Ingredient To Ex Committee Stew 
### BOB EISENBACH 
The 110 fingers of Ex Committee's
22 hands, with a couple of outside
index fingers, dipped in Daily pie
last night and emerged without the
proverbial plum, but coated with the
meringue of confusion.
Up for reconsideration was the
survey-censorship regulation, hur
riedly passed last week subject to
amendment, which would have
brought all surveys, including those
of the Daily, before the Committee
for approval.
Daily Plan Presented
Behind the eight-ball was the
Daily, which last night presented its
touted compromise plan. The plan
had nothing to do with the regula
tion. Its aim was to make the x*egu
lation unnecessary, the editor de
clared. The idea was to substitute
a monthly or semi-monthly luncheon
of three Daily big-shots, three Ex
Committeemen, who would stir
problems of Daily policy as they
stirred their noon-day coffee.
The plan bounced as erratically as
a defective football into the hands
of Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius. "Let's put it into the hands of
the journalism department," he said.
But Larry Rouble preferred a sub
committee of Ex Committee.
Business Continued
The whole business will be taken
up next meeting, 32 frames per sec
ond in four colors sound-on-film.
THE HANDBOOK will continue
as a two-by-four manual of in
formation, but refurnished and dis
tributed to frosh before the opening
of school. Voted down was the pro
posal to enlarge the book. Irvin
Jorgensen will edit, with Roy
Thompson to handle the constitu
tion sections.
BIG-NAME BANDS — still have
big-name draw, Ex Committee or no
Ex Committee, the group agreed.
Tentatively established for fall
quarter, to avoid conflict in Big
Name draw, are the Sophomore
Cotillion, the Military Ball; for win
ter quarter, the Junior Prom; for
spring quarter, the Masque Ball, and
the Senior Prom. Such an arrange
ment will prevent the campus from
contracting a big-name rash after
four successive week-end expos
ures. The student manager will de
cide for or against big namers as in
the past, but will bring questionable
cases before Ex Committee.
Fencing Awards
AWARDS — for fencing were
granted to John J. Deßenedetti, Ed
win N. Woods, and Herbert Woolley.
NITERV — problems will be han
dled by a committee headed by
President-elect Tom Killefer. They
shall make music with the right
combination of radio and locked
phonograph to make record theft
impossible.
ELECTIONS—Women will nomi
nate a vice-chairman and secretary
of Women's Conference next Tues-
day, vote on them the Tuesday fol-
lowing, according to an okehed
change in conference by-laws. Sit-
ting on meetings as ex officio mem-
bcrs will be the chairman of Wom-
en's Council, the treasurer of Wom-
en's Conference and the Dean of
Women or her representative.
"Elections bore me," declared Bob
Mallett. "I'd rather take an objec
tive ex than vote." He was speaking
of the A.S.S.U. election still in the
frying pan as far as the committee
knew, but which may get into the
fire.

of the A.S.S.U. election still in the
frying pan as far as the committee
knew, but which may get into the
fire.
DATES GRANTED — Phi Lambda
Upsilon - Alpha Chi Sigma smoker,

Lagunita Jolly-up, May 6; Kappa
Sigma pirate dance, May 28.
The 110 fingers of Ex Committee's
22 hands, with a couple of outside
index fingers, dipped in Daily pie
last night and emerged without the
proverbial plum, but coated with the
meringue of confusion.
Up for reconsideration was the
survey-censorship regulation, hur
riedly passed last week subject to
amendment, which would have
brought all surveys, including those
of the Daily, before the Committee
for approval.
Daily Plan Presented
Behind the eight-ball was the
Daily, which last night presented its
touted compromise plan. The plan
had nothing to do with the regula
tion. Its aim was to make the x*egu
lation unnecessary, the editor de
clared. The idea was to substitute
a monthly or semi-monthly luncheon
of three Daily big-shots, three Ex
Committeemen, who would stir
problems of Daily policy as they
stirred their noon-day coffee.
The plan bounced as erratically as
a defective football into the hands
of Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius. "Let's put it into the hands of
the journalism department," he said.
But Larry Rouble preferred a sub
committee of Ex Committee.
Business Continued
The whole business will be taken
up next meeting, 32 frames per sec
ond in four colors sound-on-film.
THE HANDBOOK will continue
as a two-by-four manual of in
formation, but refurnished and dis
tributed to frosh before the opening
of school. Voted down was the pro
posal to enlarge the book. Irvin
Jorgensen will edit, with Roy
Thompson to handle the constitu
tion sections.
BIG-NAME BANDS — still have
big-name draw, Ex Committee or no
Ex Committee, the group agreed.
Tentatively established for fall
quarter, to avoid conflict in Big
Name draw, are the Sophomore
Cotillion, the Military Ball; for win
ter quarter, the Junior Prom; for
spring quarter, the Masque Ball, and
the Senior Prom. Such an arrange
ment will prevent the campus from
contracting a big-name rash after
four successive week-end expos
ures. The student manager will de
cide for or against big namers as in
the past, but will bring questionable
cases before Ex Committee.
Fencing Awards
AWARDS — for fencing were
granted to John J. Deßenedetti, Ed
win N. Woods, and Herbert Woolley.
NITERV — problems will be han
dled by a committee headed by
President-elect Tom Killefer. They
shall make music with the right
combination of radio and locked
phonograph to make record theft
impossible.
ELECTIONS—Women will nomi
nate a vice-chairman and secretary
of Women's Conference next Tues-
day, vote on them the Tuesday fol-
lowing, according to an okehed
change in conference by-laws. Sit-
ting on meetings as ex officio mem-
bcrs will be the chairman of Wom-
en's Council, the treasurer of Wom-
en's Conference and the Dean of
Women or her representative.
