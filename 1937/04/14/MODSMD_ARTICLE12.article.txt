# United Row Front Sweeps Into Office
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
As the smoke of battle cleared
away from the English Corner last
night, 24 Row candidates found
themselves swept into office while
only four Hall members appeared on
the long end of the ballot.
Yet, in spite of this overwhelm
ing victory, only 35 per cent of the
total voters were Row, not counting
pledges in Encina and Roble. Twen
ty-seven per cent of the voters rep
resented the halls, 13 per cent the
independents or off-campus group,
and 25 per cent of this total were
freshmen.
Precincts Mixed
Tabulations from the bawlout
proofs used in checking names of
voters reveal that 77 students voted
at the wrong place which may be
attributed to the newness of the
double precinct system and the in
experience of the election commit
tee.
Pasco Carter and Alanson Davis,
both members of Phi Gamma Delta
were crossed off both lists, indicat
ing that they had voted twice.
Of the 660 members of fraterni
ties, 451 voted, while 262 of the 447
Hall men voted. In contrast to last
year when 62 per cent of the Row
cast ballots, and the Hall 68; this
year's statistics show that 73 per
cent of the Row, and 66 per cent of
the Hall appeared at the polls.
57 Per Cent Vote.."
Of the total student body, 57 per
cent voted, two-thirds of which
were men and one-third women.
But a greater percentage of women
in the whole student body votedâ€”
that is, 64 per cent of the 1030 wom
en and only 53 per cent of approxi
mately 2200 men.
Roble Hall camf to the front as
the best represented group on the
campus, 71 per cent of which cast

' ballots, while only 56 per cent of
Encina showed the same spirit.
Pledge Votes
Out of this freshman class, 35 per
cent of the men and 32 per cent of
| the women were probably influenced
by the Row as this represents the
j group which pledged houses last
I January.
And so as last year, it can be de
duced that a well organized Row
I succeeded in placing their candi
dates in office while an unorgan
ized Hall did their level best to help
: them.
