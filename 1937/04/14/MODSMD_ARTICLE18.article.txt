# "Back Room" Supervises Recount; 145 Ballots Discarded as Illegal
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Row and Hall "back room" boys
moved in on Chairman Dave Allison
and his Election Board last night to
supervise the recounting of presi
dential votes.
Hallmen Chick Franich and Roy
Anderson felt Tom Killefer's 36-
point margin over their candidate,
John Dern, was too close for com
fort, asked Allison for a recount.
Allison granted it, but Jack Clark
and George Ditz, both Zetes, stood
by in Killefer's interest.
Load Cut to 33
When the recount was over, Kil
lefer still led Dern, this time by a
j 33-vote margin—but in the process
I 145 votes were discarded because
j they were illegally marked.
j While the 145 votes were called
; officially illegal in the Dern-Kille/cr
j race, they were not necessarily il
-1 legal for the seven Ex Committee
! offices included on the same ballot.
When the recount was almost half
j through, Dern had a comfortable
122-vote margin. But as Assistant
Election Chairman Dick Ridcll
droned through the ballot pile —
"Killefer - Killefer - er-Dern-Killc
fer-Dern" — the Row candidate's
showing increased until the final
vote stood 816 for Killefer, 783 for
\ Dern.
Ballots Thrown Out
I Throughout the recount, ballots
i were discarded for illegal marking.
Whether ballots indicating a first
and third choice for president, but
no second, should be discarded was
debated. Allison finally agreed to
throw them out.
Fi'anich and Clark, who watched
the ballots carefully as Ridell read
them, called the illegal markings. It
became almost a battle of which
j could throw out more of the other
| candidate's ballots.
Dern Loses 71, Killefer 74
But of the total ballots thrown
j out, 74 were for Killefer, 71 for
Dern.
i In going through a pile of dis
carded ballots, Anderson told Alli
; son: "There are more dumb Dcrns
! than Killefers."
All through the recount, Row and
! Hall backers kidded each other as
I their opponent's ballots were thrown
out. More than once Franich
' laughed: "There goe sanothcr one
j for Killefer." But Clark would
smile back: "Yes, but there goes an
| other for Dern."
i Ex Committee this noon will pass
! on the legality of the entire election.
