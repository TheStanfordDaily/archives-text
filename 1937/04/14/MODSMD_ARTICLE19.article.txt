Proceeds of tonight's benefit por
j formance of "Le Bonheur" in the
1 Assembly Hall at 8 o'clock will go
toward establishing a library for the
French house, formerly Manzanila,
on Lasuen. Mrs. Edouard Theriot
of Burlingame, who heads the list
of 40 patronesses for the house, is
sponsoring the library drive.
Besides the feature film, which is
in French with English subtitles,
there will be a short three-reel trav
elogue on Paris with English dia
logue. Pi Delta Phi, honorary
French fraternity, has arranged for
the movie to be presented.
Tickets for "Le Bonheur" are on
sale at the Bookstore and the French
house. They can also be obtained in
the French department, and a lim
ited number will be on sale at the
door.
