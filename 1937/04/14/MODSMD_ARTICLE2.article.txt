# 'Sky Is Limit' For Fund Drive
## Air Show Saturday Aids Convalescent Home 
### 
"The sky's the limit" for Stan
ford this Saturday afternoon when
the Farm becomes air-minded at a
mammoth air show extravaganza to
be held at the Palo Alto airport as
a unit of the Convalescent Home
Drive.
Flights will cost only $1 and tick
ets will be sold on Quad today, to
morrow, and Friday by members of
the Stanford Flying Club, national
intercollegiate flying champions. All
proceeds will go directly to the Con
valescent Home.
To Inspect Planes
Regular pilots will be engaged to
do passenger flying, but students as
well as regulars will participate in
stunt flying demonstrations, spot
landing contests â€” and possibly a
race between three of the cubs.
Planes will be brought down from
Oakland Airport, Oakland Naval
Reserve Base and Mills Field. New
types of planes will be on inspec
tion.
Matinee Postponed
Matinee benefit at the Varsity
Theater originally scheduled for
Friday afternoon has been postponed
until April 30, after the main part of
the drive is completed. Tickets will
be on sale next week for 30 and 40
cents.
There is a possibility that the
feature picture may be Douglas
Fairbanks' "The Black Pirate," ac
cording to Harmon Howard, general
chairman. ,
