# Nazis Viewed As Anti Humanists

### 
Thomas Mann, expatriated Ger
nan liberal author, represents a
t\ pe of humanism challenged by the
standards of New Germany, ac
c< j ding to Dr. Kurt F. Reinhardt,
a; sociate professor of German, who
-spoke last night on "Thomas Mann:
jiirman and European."
"Mann," said Dr. Reinhardt, "is
an exponent of the sociological nove,l
and in his works attempts to evalu
ate life as well as depict it. Too
radical to be a rightist, and not
radical enough to be a leftist, Mann
began with definite tendencies to
ward Romanticism, and later devel
oped a type of humanistic philoso
phy. In his works he reveals a
rather morbid sense of humor,
coupled with deep introspection and
sensitiveness."
