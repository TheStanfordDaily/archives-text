# Tan Skiers Return From Yosemite Trip
## 
### 
Those walking lamp-posts radiat- (
ing light, heat, and vitamin D you
see about the Farm did not go to
sleep under sun lamps. Nor have
they been to beaches â€”there hasn't
been enough sun around here to
raise a blister on a new-born babe,
you know that, Rollo.
Those beaming countenances were
gained at Badger Pass, Yosemite and
are worn by the ski enthuisasts of
Stanford's Ski Club. Leaving for
the snow last Friday night, about 30
of them were joined by a score more
who just couldn't cut Massa Dor
sey's class in Swing.
Saturday stalled with the division
of the group into beginners and ad
vanced classes; the first was coached
by the Austrian champion, Sigi Engl,
who just taught stems and Christies
right and left.
That afternoon and evening was
spent in a down-hill race wtih Cali
fornia and dance at the Lodge.
The next day instruction contin
ued in weather warm enough to al
low the women to ski in shorts. The
afternoon was spent in slalom racing
with California, giving Stanford a

chance to gain glory with first, sec
ond, and third places.
And so to bed. Another trip may
be planned in three weeks, accord
ing to Ernst Meyer, organizer of the
trip.
