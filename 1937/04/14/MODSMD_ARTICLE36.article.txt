I HOM BARREL-STAVES
TO REAL SKIS

Stanford's skiers met California in
Yosemite last week-end, in a little
private meet which the Cards won
with consummate ease and which
ended the competitive skiing season
for Stanford this year.
Now, behind this victory is a long
story, of how Stanford couldn't get
out of its own way on skis for a
long while and of how things have
changed now so that the Indians,
without the aid of any coaching, are
in a ranking spot in Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate skiing circles.
Last year the Stanford skiers
went to the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Championships at Yosemite,
along with eleven other colleges, and
came in as a team in ninth place.
Ninth place, of course, wasn't much
to do any loud talking about.
This year ihey went to the Yose
mite Intereollegiates again, but they
didn't come out ninth this time. No,
sir, they took fourth place, behind
Washington, Nevada, and Cal in that
order. That was in the last three
days of February.

ALMOST CAUGHT
THE HUSKIES

Last month the team went to the
Mt. Rainier Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Championships (there are
two meets held each year, you see).
Still without the benefit of coaching,
they had improved enough this time
to take second place, right behind
Washington and in front of Cal.
At Mt. Rainier the Cards took sec
ond place in both downhill and
cross-country, while Cal took
fourth in both. However, the Bears
came back in slalom to take second
place from Stanford, whereby hangs
a tale. Cal has always been able to
beat Stanford at slalom, it seems,
and when Stanford won the down
hill at the private Yosemite meet
last Saturday by only one point,
things looked pretty bad for the In
dians for the next day's slalom af
fair. Just the same, they went out
for their try at it and, of all things,
took the first three places, to trounce
the Bears.
The reason Cal is strong in the
slalom—a contest of skill, skidding
down a slope zigzagging around a
line of flags—is because skiing is a
minor sport at Cal and has one of
the best instrue> /rs in the world, Dr.
Joel Hildebrand. Dr. Hildebrand, a
professor of chemistry at Berkeley,
was manager of the United States
Olympic ski team that participated
at Garmisch last year, a position
that speaks for itself.
There is another little angle on
that Cal-Stanford meet, too, that
boosts Stanford. The Bears were
having their intramural ski meet
(get that, Klauber) over the week
end, and so they entered 15 men
aeainst Stanford. Out of those 15
thoy still weren't able to find enough
good men to defeat the Stanford en
try of three in the downhill and four
in the slalom.
So now that things are over in a
comparative way for this year, al
though there still is lots of spring
skiing to be done, it looks as though
Stanford has a bit of a ski team.
Perhaps, sometime, the team will
pain recognition as a minor sport
here at Stanford, as at Cal, and then
with the help of a coach be able to
give the Huskies all they want.

WE HAD THE SCORE
RIGHT, ANYHOW

In Monday's Daily there was a
little story—oh, how little—that told
of (he Stanford Frosh baseballers'
victory over the Cal Frosh last Sat
urday. From that story have come
vepei cussions, such as "Don't let
;iny of your sports writers go near
the frosh baseball field," and "You
oughta be shot," and the like.
It: seems that Harry Shipkey,
freshman coach, didn't like the
f tory, or the play it got, and neither
did any of the freshman pastimers.
As far as the size goes, there was
n't too much that could be done
about it. There's only so much room
in the paper, and not everybody
feels as enthusiastic about fresh
man baseball as Mr. Shipkey and his
hoys. However, we can offer just a
little apology for that — nothing ab
ject, though, you understand.
As for the story itself, it con
tained a sentence that said Gil Rahn,
basketballer and now a pitcher out
there, gave out 12 walks before be
ing replaced by Norm Juney. That
was a butch, and for it we'offer the
abject apologies. Rahn walked just
three men, Norm Juney took care of
the ether nine passes. While we had

the number right, we certainly bun
gled the responsibility, so we hope
Mr. Shipkey wiil be appeased by our
humble retraction, or rather, cor
rection. He's a pretty big guy to be
chased by, and those freshmen
aren't exactly punj;, either.
