# Bears Favored In Swim Meet
## Cardinal Mermen Picked For Second Position 
### 
The boys in the know are picking
| Saturday's all-conference swimming
championships in the U.S.C. pool to
be the first close and exciting meet
| since the beginning of the Pacific
| Coast southern division swimming
i conference.
j For 17 straight years, husky, well
i trained Stanford amphibians domi
| nated conference swim circles. They
; never were threatened.
Trojans on Top
Then along came the Trojans of
[ U.S.C. They livened up their swim-
I ming team so it soon was on a par
! with Trojan teams in other sports,
i For the last three years the South
j erners have been unmolested at the
j top of the heap.
The wise boys tried to dope out
i this closest battle in 20 years solely
i on past times turned in by the va
rious mermen this season,' and ar
rived at the decision that the Bears
might win the meet with 52 points;
Stanford second with 50; the Tro
jans third with 42; and the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. trailing with 24.
Three-Way Fight
It should be a three-way fight,
j Trojan's wonder team of three
men may take five first places out
of nine events. The other four first
places may go to Cal.
That would seem to leave Nort
Thornton's Indians out in the cold,
but the dopesters say the Cards
should score as many as 50 points
without a single first place.
