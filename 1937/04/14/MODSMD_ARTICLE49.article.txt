LOS ANGELES, April 13 (UP).â€”
A one-time cowhand, Bob Nestell,
who looks like Gene Tunney and in
time may punch like Jack Demp
sey, meets a reconditioned light
heavyweight, Lee Ramage, tonight in
a 10-round bout that has more
"angles" than a miter box.

Rattlesnake meat, which costs $1G
per pound, was eaten a short time
ago by two experimenting students
at Manlcato State Teachers' College,
Minnesota.
