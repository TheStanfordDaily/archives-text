# Stanford Professors Laud Court Decision
## 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Two Stanford professors were
outspoken in their praise of the
Supreme Court's decision proclaim
ing the Constitutionality of the
Wagner Labor Act when asked to
state their views on the subject
yesterday.
Dr. Arthur M. Cathcart of the law
school was strongly inclined to side
with the "five old men" who upheld
the validity of the act. "I think the
decision is a fortunate one," said
Cathcart. "Chief Justice Hughes'
opinion was very strong. In making
this decision the Supreme Court has
gone farther in the direction of fed
eral control than was indicated in
either the NRA or Guffey Coal Bill
decisions.
Government's Right Questioned
"I anticipate that the Court will
now have a great deal of difficulty
in determining where to draw the
lines as to what the federal govern
ment can, or cannot do under the
specifications provided for in the
Interstate Commerce clause of the
Constitution."
When approached on the subject,
Professor Paul Eliel, director of in
dustrial relations in the Graduate
I School of Business, declared that the
I Court's decision on the Wagner Act
I was "the most significant thing that
i has happened in the field of indus
trial relations in the last 50 years.
Change in Policy
"It marks a complete reversal as
regards the federal government's
! policy toward Interstate Commerce
i regulation. This decision defies all
! previous precedent, of which I am
j aware," said Dr. Eliel.
Queried as to his impressions of
the significance of the Supreme
| Court's stand, Dr. Philip W. Buck of
j the political science department is-
I sued the following statement. "The
legality of the Act will have a good
deal of influence on the federal
government's labor policy, as it gives
powers to that body which were
heretofore doubtful."
Possibility of Embarrassment
"This may prove embarrassing, as
the giving of these powers makes the
government responsible for a pol
icy toward unions and collective
bargaining organization—a state of I
affairs which did not previously ob- j
tain."
Mrs. Irene B. Coverley, head of i
the Student Employment Service,
said: "I don't think the Court's ac- |
tion in the Wagner Case will affect !
student employment directly. Most I
of the undergraduates' jobs are on
a part-time basis, and as such do 1
not come within the jurisdiction of
the Act."
Summer Jobs Unaffected
"As for the effect of this decision i
on students' summer jobs, it will be
negligible because they come into
little contact with the unions."
In conclusion, Mrs. Coverly said:
"I believe that the decision itself is
as excellent one. I think new social
legislation is necessary, and it is my
opinion that this favorable judg- j
ment of the Wagner Act marks a
fine step forward in progressive
American government."

opinion was very strong. In making
this decision the Supreme Court has
gone farther in the direction of fed
eral control than was indicated in
either the NRA or Guffey Coal Bill
decisions.
Government's Right Questioned
"I anticipate that the Court will
now have a great deal of difficulty
in determining where to draw the
lines as to what the federal govern
ment can, or cannot do under the
specifications provided for in the
Interstate Commerce clause of the
Constitution."
When approached on the subject,
Professor Paul Eliel, director of in
dustrial relations in the Graduate
I School of Business, declared that the
I Court's decision on the Wagner Act
I was "the most significant thing that
i has happened in the field of indus
trial relations in the last 50 years.
Change in Policy
"It marks a complete reversal as
regards the federal government's
! policy toward Interstate Commerce
i regulation. This decision defies all
! previous precedent, of which I am
j aware," said Dr. Eliel.
Queried as to his impressions of
the significance of the Supreme
| Court's stand, Dr. Philip W. Buck of
j the political science department is-
I sued the following statement. "The
legality of the Act will have a good
deal of influence on the federal
government's labor policy, as it gives
powers to that body which were
heretofore doubtful."
Possibility of Embarrassment
"This may prove embarrassing, as
the giving of these powers makes the
government responsible for a pol
icy toward unions and collective
bargaining organization—a state of I
affairs which did not previously ob- j
tain."
Mrs. Irene B. Coverley, head of i
the Student Employment Service,
said: "I don't think the Court's ac- |
tion in the Wagner Case will affect !
student employment directly. Most I
of the undergraduates' jobs are on
a part-time basis, and as such do 1
not come within the jurisdiction of
the Act."
Summer Jobs Unaffected
"As for the effect of this decision i
on students' summer jobs, it will be
negligible because they come into
little contact with the unions."
In conclusion, Mrs. Coverly said:
"I believe that the decision itself is
as excellent one. I think new social
legislation is necessary, and it is my
opinion that this favorable judg- j
ment of the Wagner Act marks a
fine step forward in progressive
American government."
Two Stanford professors were
outspoken in their praise of the
Supreme Court's decision proclaim
ing the Constitutionality of the
Wagner Labor Act when asked to
state their views on the subject
yesterday.
Dr. Arthur M. Cathcart of the law
school was strongly inclined to side
with the "five old men" who upheld
the validity of the act. "I think the
decision is a fortunate one," said
Cathcart. "Chief Justice Hughes'
opinion was very strong. In making
