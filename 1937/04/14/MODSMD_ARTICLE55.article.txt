# We're Just Grown Up

### 
JUST in case anybody should ask you, the
campus election bud that bloomed yesterday
was the most redolent political blossom this
campus has grown in years.
And if that paragraph sounds familiar, it's not
a trick of memory. Spring Editors since time
immemorial have said the same thing. And
Spring Politicians have done the same things.
The differences between this and other years
are superficial. This year it was the same cau
cus pie, but with the new meringue of coalition.
There was the same trading and bribing, only
this year the trading and bribing was a little
more obvious. There was the same digging into
political trenches, only this year the lines were
better established with brassy sample ballots
published by Hall and Row as guides to the
misguided voter.
To those who asked The Daily not to print
living group affiliations beside each candidate's
name, to those who tried, we assume sincerely,
lo effect co-operation between factions, to those
who winced at open-and-shut trades, congratu
lations! You stand first in the vanguard for
political sanity at Stanford.
But it should be evident that you who worked
hard as you did to shrive the unshrivable did
so without success.
You are dealing with the same brutal adult
ambitions that motivate campaigners for state
and national elections. Your plea for good
government is a whisper in the shouts for this
office and that concession.
Your failure here is not an indication that the
election had undesirable features. It is merely
an indication that Stanford students are nearer
to being grown up than you suspected, and as
susceptible to official honor as are other recog
nized adults.
