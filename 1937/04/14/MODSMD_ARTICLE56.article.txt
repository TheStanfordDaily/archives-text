# The
						Boys Play a Game
## 
### 
(From U.C.LA. Daily Bruin)
AND back East in this great beautiful country
of ours there are nine boys who on this
washday spend their time playing a strange
game.
Four of the boys live in one house. And in
back of their house there is a yard.
Four of the boys live in the house next door.
And in the back of their house there's a yard.
A very narrow fence.
Every Monday, the eight boys scamper out
into their yards—four on one side of the fence
and four on the other.
Then another little lad comes into the game.
He carefully balances a chair on the pretty
white fence. On the chair he stands a long
bamboo pole. On the pole he balances another
chair.
Then he clambers up and sits down.
On both sides of the fence, the boys watch
breathlessly for their playmate to fall. If he
topples to the right, the lads on that side whoop
with glee. If he falls to the left, the kiddies on
that side are happy.
Monday before last he fell to the left—with a
thud.
The boys should be warming up again about
this time.
