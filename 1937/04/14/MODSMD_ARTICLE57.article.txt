# Unpeaceful Peace
## 
### 
(From the Minnesota Daily)
THE peace conference to be held next week
at the University may not solve the problems
of peace and war. It may not reach any con
clusions about any one single line of attack on
these problems. But certainly it should make
the subject of the preservation of peace a dy
namic one worthy of the best thought that stu
dents can give it.
The fault of most formal education is that it
is too abstract, so cut and dried into a text-book
style that it loses most of its force of arousing
action. The student views it as theory alone,
an unworkable abstraction from reality, and to
be passed off lightly as impracticable.
Problems are not solved from that negative
viewpoint. What is necessary is a vital grasp
of the problem, and a forceful realization that
action is necessary for its solution. When stu
dents can be made to realize that the problem
of peace is far enough removed from dull the
ory to bring some of the best minds of the
country together to consider it at a special con
ference, they should be enough impressed to
feel that they are not wasting their time in
giving it serious thought.
Perhaps they will arrive at no solution by
giving the problem that attention. But they will
at least achieve a forceful attitude toward the
subject, and an aggressive consideration of a
problem is a large part of the way to an even
tual answer.
The place of the peace conference is not to
indoctrinate students with ready-made ideas. It
is meant only to outline the problem and to
show where it lies, and perhaps to suggest
some possible paths toward a solution. That
is the meaning of a college education.
