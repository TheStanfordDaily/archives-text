THE largest salary of a "pulp" magazine au
thor is the $100,000 a year earned by Max
Brandt, the Literary Digest states.
Next in rank at $75,000 a year is Erie Gardner,
an ex-lawyer. With three secretaries he spends
much of his time traveling to odd corners of
the world.
The topnotch writers in this field compose an
average of 10,000 words a day and some have
ranged to as high as 1,000,000 words a year.
Though the writers for the "pulp" fiction
periodicals work long hours they received from
$10 to $40 an hour for their labors.
More than 200 American magazines printed
on pulp-wood newsprint sell a minimum of
8,000,000 copies a month. In times of depres
sion tales of horror find favor. Today demand

this noble profession?
