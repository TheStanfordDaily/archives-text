(Starting a series of articles on war, in prepara
tion for Peace Day April 22. Bull Scssioncrs Curt
Prendergast and Tro Ilarpcr tilt at the windmills
jointly today. Prendergast is not looking for a cave
in the hills, Harper is. Similar articles by other
campus figures will follow.—The Editor.)

I WISH I could see what Harper has to say on the
subject befoi-e I blow, because it may turn out
that he figures civilization is tottering right this min
ute and that all I do is merely put the moment of doom
forward a half an hour.
Now you should reasonably grant that when arma
ments are being built, they are going to be used. This
would make another war to end wars somewhere in
the offing, but how soon in the offing is the point.
It might not here be apt to borrow from the bump
tiously brassy Washington Merry Go Round, but it
points out that the recent rout of the German and Ital
ian forces in Spain kicked the bottom out of Hitler's
and Mussolini's big war talk, and left them talking a
bigger war game than they played.
Also, it mentioned that the airplanes imported from
Russia were flying circles around the German and
Italian imported jobs. Merry Go Round, quoting mili
tary experts, postponed war for an easy two years
while Italy and Germany retire to their own backyards
for more practice.
All this assumes, of course, that when and if a bet-,
ter war is going to be built, Hitler and Mussolini will
build it. But as for the United States and the yellow
peril that was going to sweep down upon us from the
Pacific the peril somehow seems to have stopped
periling now that Arthur Brisbane is gone.

YY/AVES of fear sweep over Europe like wind chas
ing shadows across fields of grain. America is be
sieged with strikes and constant flares of social unrest.
Students seek outlets for their emotions in listening
to swing. Germany and Italy pile up arms, amunition,
men. People all over the world laugh louder, cry
more, are more excitable. The whole world is in a
constant state of unrest, uneasiness, and restlessness;
as if it were waiting for someone to knock on the door,
but all the time not being sure of whether there is any
one on the other side.
The international pot has been bubbling around the
edges for the past year and the trouble with the pot
is that the lid is on too tight.
No one comes into the open, no one talks too
loudly, no one speaks out of turn, everyone sitting
waiting for the right moment or der Tag.
The next war is not imminent, it is on us. Spain
is fighting, but it is a mere test tube for the world
powers. When the communists there finally kill off the
fascists or the fascists kill off the communists then we
shall have a war that will really be a honey. None of
your Gilbert and Sullivan stuff but a war in which
you and I will have our fool heads shot off.
I suppose we can blame our emotions.
