## RAT RACE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Within the last few hours there
has been brought to my attention
the news of a grievous situation. I
have been told that the last insti
tution of the Stanford "rough" is
being suppressed—having its life ex
tinguished by the Men's Council.
The institution to which I have pre
viously alluded is the Sequoia "rat
race."
It«is well known that these con
tests are the greatest asset to the
building of the character and body
of the Stanford man. Any competi
tive sport which demands a goodly
quantity of agility and strength
without those skills found necessary
in the body of a trained athlete
should be smiled upon—yea, even
encouraged by the Men's Council.
It is the duty of this university to
produce a well rounded citizen, but
the only sport which has been found
to teach the youth of Stanford to
take punishment as well as to give
it, has lately been banned by an
unwise action of this body, created
to aid in the building of the charac
ter of Stanford men.
If the "rat race" is forbidden, I
sadly fear that the men of Sequoia
will be forced to release their ex
cess spirits in more deleterious ac
tions.
