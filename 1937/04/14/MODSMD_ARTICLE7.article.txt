# Labor Cases Fail To Halt Court Plan
## Roosevelt Not Convinced Assurance Is Offered For Other Legislation 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (U.R).—
President Roosevelt today ordered
continuation of his drive for enact
ment of his Supreme Court reorgan
ization program.
His leaders renewed a vigorous
fight despite opposition claims that
yesterday's Wagner act decisions had
weakened Administration ranks.
Visitors who have talked with Mr.
Roosevelt since the Supreme Court
upheld the five test labor cases said
he was not convinced that the court
offered any assurance of constitu
tionality for other social and eco
nomic legislation, such as a child
labor law, a minimum wage meas
ure, or legislation limiting the work
week.
The President himself withheld
comment at his semi-weekly press
conference. He said he had given
the opinions only a cursory reading.
Visitors Questioned
Persons who called on the Presi
dent said that when they asked his
opinion as to whether yesterday's
Supreme Court decisions apply to
other phases of his social objective
besides collective bargaining, Mr.
Roosevelt replied by seeking his visi
tors' opinion.
Earlier, congressional leaders all
denied there would be any retreat
on the court program. Senate Ma
jority Leader Joe T. Robinson, Sen
ate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry F. Ashurst, and Speaker Wil
liam B. Bankhead all said the drive
would proceed.
At Philadelphia Postmaster Gen
eral James A. Farley repeated his
boast that "our side has the votes"
to put across the program.
Senate Divided
But Senate opinion on the effect
of the decisions seemed to be as
divided as on the program itself.
Some uncommitted Senators said
privately that with the Wagner act
upheld the President's bill now be
comes unnecessary.
Others maintained that it robbed
the opposition of its chief argument,
the "packing" of the court, since the
addition of new Justices as proposed
by the President would not change
its viewpoint.
