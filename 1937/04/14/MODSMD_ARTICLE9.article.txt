In 1917 one of Stanford's greatest
men had an idea. A good idea. An
idea that was destined to grow with
ever-increasing sureness through

Convalescent Home which was be
gun by D. Charles Gardner, now re
tired University chaplain, 20 years
ago has become an institution of
nation-wide reknown, bringing
health back to children's wasted
bodies, giving a new start in life to
youngsters who desperately need a
new start if they are to have any
life at all.
Not that there has been anything
spectacular about this growth. That
would not have been characteristic
of the man who started it, or of the
many who have helped it on its way.
It is a very ordinary story, of peo
ple who believe that bringing hap
piness to those who can not afford
to bring happiness to themselves is
sufficient reward for untiring and
unceasing labor.
Campus Auxiliary

,the "Campus Auxiliary to the Stan

donations of money, clothes, Christ
mas cheer, and some personal serv
ice by students, who from the first
have taken part in the exciting ad
venture of building health.
Next year there was a summer
camp in the old Phi Sigma Kappa
house on the campus. All that sum
