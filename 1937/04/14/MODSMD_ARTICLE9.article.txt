In 1917 one of Stanford's greatest
men had an idea. A good idea. An
idea that was destined to grow with
ever-increasing sureness through
the years until now, in 1937, the
Convalescent Home which was be
gun by D. Charles Gardner, now re
tired University chaplain, 20 years
ago has become an institution of
nation-wide reknown, bringing
health back to children's wasted
bodies, giving a new start in life to
youngsters who desperately need a
new start if they are to have any
life at all.
Not that there has been anything
spectacular about this growth. That
would not have been characteristic
of the man who started it, or of the
many who have helped it on its way.
It is a very ordinary story, of peo
ple who believe that bringing hap
piness to those who can not afford
to bring happiness to themselves is
sufficient reward for untiring and
unceasing labor.
Campus Auxiliary
The Home began, first of all, with
,the "Campus Auxiliary to the Stan
ford Clinics," which gave monthly
donations of money, clothes, Christ
mas cheer, and some personal serv
ice by students, who from the first
have taken part in the exciting ad
venture of building health.
Next year there was a summer
camp in the old Phi Sigma Kappa
house on the campus. All that sum
mer and the next the sick and crip

pled children came, stayed for a
while, and went away with a re
newed interest in the business of
living. One hundred and twenty
children, taken in groups of twenty,
had had the benefits of the Summer
Camp before that second year was
up.
So far, so good; but by this time it
began to seem to a lot of people, in
cluding Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Hop
kins, that Dr. Gardner's idea was
good enough to deserve a more con
crete form. So in 1919, with the gift
made by Mr. Hopkins, the camp
was moved to what remained of the
old Stanford residence, and there j
facilities for 15 patients were con
structed. By arrangement with the
University Board of Trustees, the
27-acre plot of land surrounding the
house was leased for $1 per year.
A few years later the $50,000 Mc-
Laughlin Unit, given in memory of
Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin, was i
built to house an additional 20 chil
dren; and in 1928 followed the Bab
cock Unit. The erection of the Aux
iliary Board Unit a year later mark
ed the completion of the immediate
building program, and with the
opening in 1932 of the Babcock
Unit, which had stood idle for four
years due to lack of funds for oper
ation, the Home was running at full
capacity.
Grows Rapidly
Matching the growth of the phys
ical plant, there has been the help of
the Auxiliary Board of the Home,
the help of the San Francisco Com
munity Chest, and of such people as
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins, Mrs. Pay
son J. Treat, and many others.
Gradually gathering momentum
down the years, the Home's original
fund of goodwill has been added to
and increased until it has reached
immense proportions.
Today there are four housing
units, full at all times with the 70
patients the Home is equipped to
care for; there is a staff of 11 peo
ple, a superintendent, 7 graduate
nurses, 3 teachers; there are contri
butions, many of them from Stan
ford alumni, and an endowment
which has shot up to over $400,000.
But to Dr. Gardner and Mrs. Hop
kins and Mrs. Treat and all those
others who have given their time
and effort, the work is not done; in
a sense, will never be done.
Future Planned
Ahead lies a dream of the time
when the Stanford Convalescent
Home may care, not for 70 chil
dren, but for as many as need the
sort of help it can give them; when
no one will have to be turned
away from the yellow buildings
which lie in the sunny meadows be
yond the eucalyptus groves.
When that day comes, the great
idea which began 20 years ago will
have been realized.
