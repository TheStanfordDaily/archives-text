I
Everyone can wear Measured Clothes but frankly we orig
inated Measured Clothes for two specific groups of men. For
a long time we've made tailored clothes for men in our Own
Shop ... and for just as long we've fitted "regulars'' in ready
made suits. Yet even with such perfect facilities to serve
everyone...we found a couple of "forgotten men" who needed H
or wanted tailored clothes more modest price than the
custom tariff. So Measured Clothes (cut to your own meas
urements and style specifications in your own fabric choice)
are especially for men who find it hard to be fitted in ready
to wear... and for men who want custom individuality in
style, fit and choice of unusual fabrics and designs... at a
price that averages about $3.50 more than a good ready
made garment. Prices average $43.50 to $48.50.
