# All-Campus Dance Today In Pavilion
## Kimball, Band, Vocalist To Play 'Music in Miniature,' 4-6 p.m. 
### 
Swing, not basketball, will be the
major consideration in the Pavilion
again this afternoon when Ellis
Kimball presents his "music in
miniature" from 4 to 6 o'clock.
The occasion is an all-University
jolly-up, second in the spring se
ries of senior class events. Admis
sion to the dance is free to all stu
dents, Chairman Stan Zimet said
yesterday.
Popular Players
Kimball and his band are now on
vacation, after completing a two
year engagement at a popular San
Francisco night club. The jolly-up
is one of the few appearances the
group will make before returning to
San Francisco.
The orchestra is unusual in that
it is composed of only nine musicians
who "double" on various instru
ments, thus producing the effect of a
much larger organization. The band
has been heard in nightly broadcasts
over national radio networks.
Vocalist To Appear
Mary Ann Harris, Kimball's fea
tured vocalist, will be permitted to
sing with the group under a revised
resolution passed by Ex Committee
last fall, regulating the appearance
of women entertainers with off
campus orchestras.
The jolly-up is sponsored by the
senior class in appreciation of the
response given the Senior Prom Fri
day night, Zimet said. With an ample
treasury which has developed from
a number of profitable projects dur
ing the last two years, class officials
have arranged tentative plans for a
number of similar spccial events
this quarter.
Members of the Senior Ball com
mittee are negotiating with eastern
booking agencies to secure a major
band for the Senior Week's affair.
