# Convalescent Labor Day Is Farm's 'Unselfish Custom'

"It is," said the Daily Palo Alto
for May 15, 1023, "almost the only
unselfish custom recognized at Stan
ford under the name 'tradition'."
Truer today, perhaps, than when
it was written, that harsh judgment
sums up accurately what Labor Day
at the Convalescent Home has been
for the Stanford student-body. A
chance to do something construc
tive and personal for Stanford's most
deserving charity, it has long formed
the backbone of a growing campaign
to make "Stanford's Own" some
thing besides a sloganeer's bad
dream-
Beginning almost as soon as the
Home began, Labor Day was held
for the fir.st time in 1919. That was
the year the Home came to rest after
a period of wandering in which it
had taken two summers to get from
the tent-camp stage to the tempo
rary and perhaps questionable dig

nity of the Phi Sigma Kappa house.
That was the year Mr. and Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins made the original gift,
the year the remains of the Stanford
residence were purchased, and the
year the Home was given its perma
nent quarters.
Nothing much happened on that
first Labor Day that hasn't happened
on any Labor Day since.
"The individual and frenzied ef
forts of the student body have
served to transfer rubbish from one
spot to another, and the gardeners
have been forced to take a couple of
weeks off to clean up the 'clean-up',"
as the ever-encouraging D.P. re
marked.
Classes were dismissed for the day,
the Five Hundred were given the
privilege of riding to the Home in
trucks, and the usual barbecue and
assorted entertainments were held.
It wasn't a remarkable affair except
for one thing.
Becomes Tradition
It marked the first time the stu
dent body took a live and active
interest in an institution which, un
der the kindly guidance of Dr. Gard
ner and his associates, had been
quietly developing into something
extremely worth while.
Next year Labor Day was held
again, with increasing success; and
as it entered on its third year, it had

body's air of complete and magnifi-

time which adds its inevitable bit to
I the welfare of the Convalescent
Home.
Varied Contributions
The financial reports will try to
| tell you that the Home has grown
! by a hundred dollars here, a few
thousand there; they cannot tell you
j of clothes given at Christmas time, a
circus given by a local service club,
! or a Labor Day given willingly by
Stanford's students.
Those are the things which have
counted most. They are the things
! which no ledger can record, but
! which have done more than any
thing else to build the Home.
When next Wednesday comes and
the Farm again makes its annual
I pilgrimage, it will be adding a little
j more to the store of good will; will
be increasing by an amount, how

| some sick child will live.
| If Labor Day needs any excuse,
that is sufficient.
