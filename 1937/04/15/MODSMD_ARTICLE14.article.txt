# Convalescent Labor Day Is Farm's 'Unselfish Custom'

"It is," said the Daily Palo Alto
for May 15, 1023, "almost the only
unselfish custom recognized at Stan
ford under the name 'tradition'."
Truer today, perhaps, than when
it was written, that harsh judgment
sums up accurately what Labor Day
at the Convalescent Home has been
for the Stanford student-body. A
chance to do something construc
tive and personal for Stanford's most
deserving charity, it has long formed
the backbone of a growing campaign
to make "Stanford's Own" some
thing besides a sloganeer's bad
dream-
Beginning almost as soon as the
Home began, Labor Day was held
for the fir.st time in 1919. That was
the year the Home came to rest after
a period of wandering in which it
had taken two summers to get from
the tent-camp stage to the tempo
rary and perhaps questionable dig
