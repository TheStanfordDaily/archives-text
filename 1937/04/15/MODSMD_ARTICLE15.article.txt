# Cabinet Split In Canada On Strike Issue
## Sympathy for C. I. O. Causes Resignation Of Ontario Ministers 
### 
OSHAWA, Ont., April 14 (U.R).—
The General Motors strike caused
the resignation of the Ontario Labor
Minister and the Attorney General
today, and it appeared almost cer
tain that a general election would
be held on the issue of Premier
Mitchell F. Hepburn's campaign
Ugainst the Committee for Indus
trial Organization.
David A. Croll, Labor Minister,
Resigned, explaining in a letter to
Hepburn that "My place is marching
\jknth the workers rather than riding
With General Motors."
Labor's Rights
A short time later Attorney Gen
eral Arthur W. Roebuck resigned,
explaining he was "generally op
posed" to Hepburn's stand and was
"convinced" of labor's right to or
ganize by joining any lawful union.
Hepburn had requested both res
ignations so his cabinet could pre
sent "a united front against the
C.1.0.'s agitators." It was believed
virtually certain that a general elec
tion would have to be called.
In the meantime, paralysis spread
through General Motors' 300 Cana
dian plants. Production of fabrics,
parts, and supplies ceased today. In
many plants the "stop production"
order will result in shut-downs.
Men pickets were replaced today
by women, and 200 non-strikers im
mediately went through the lines
and entered the assembly plant. It
was the largest number of workers
to pass the picket lines since the
strike, affecting 3,700, was called.
The women pickets, waving flags
and singing, booed the non-strikers.
