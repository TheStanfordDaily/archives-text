DETROIT April 14 (U.R). â€” More
than 300 police and sheriff's deputies
tonight jailed 150 sit-down strikers
evicted in a fierce tear gas battle
from the Yale and Towne Lock
Company plant. The factory had
been held by strikers for six weeks.
No injuries were reported after
the eviction fight, in which strikers
retaliated against police tear gas
bombs by throwing heavy lead
weights and other missiles. 1
The eviction followed refusal by
the strikers today to accept a me
diation offer by Governor Frank
Murphy, who proposed settlement
negotiations similar to those which
ended the Chrysler, Hudson, and
Reo strikes.
