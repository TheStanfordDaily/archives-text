# Boggs Predicts C.I.O. Success
## Eliel Sees Early End Of Sit-Down Strikes 
### 
"The real explanation for the suc
cess of John L. Lewis and the Com
mittee for Industrial Organization is
that they are in line with the indus
trial and social trends of today."
Thus Professor Theodore H. Boggs,
of the economics department, speak
ing last night to more than 50 stu
dents attending a Y.W.CA.-spon
sored panel discussion on "The Fu
ture of Labor: A. F. of L. or C.1.0.?"
predicted the triumph of the prin
ciples of industrial unionism.
Green vs. Lewis
Paul Eliel, Hilden Gibson, and
John Dunlop, the other faculty mem
bers making up the panel, agreed
that the reasons for the current la
bor rivalry do not basically lie in the
personal conflicts of John L. Lewis,
C.1.0. leader, and William Green,
A. F. of L. president.
Hilden Gibson explained that
"the basis for the C.1.0. is techno
logical in nature. The C.1.0. is in
temper with the times; the A. F. of
L. is not."
Sees Sit-Down End
Disappearance in the near future
of the sit-down strike as a labor
weapon was predicted by Professor
Eliel, who is director of the indus
trial relations division of the Gradu
ate School of Business. "We're not
going to see any more ~sit-downs,"
hde said. "We're seeing a revulsion
of public feeling against them."
Effect of the Supreme Court deci
sions establishing the constitution
ality of the Wagner Labor Relations
Act, Dunlop said, will be "the sta
bilization of the labor movement.
Boggs added that "once .the right to
organize is accepted, a spirit of ne
gotiation similar to that in England
will be established. Labor will be
sobered by its responsibility."
President's Aid
Intervention by President Roose
velt to end sit-downs, Eliel pointed
out, would be both politically un
wise and legally difficult "unless
Roosevelt were to step in with the
army and national guard." The
victories of the C.1.0., Boggs said,
"were in no inconsiderable degree
due to the favorable attitude of
Roosevelt toward 'the forgotten
man'."
On the prospects for the forma
tion of a labor party, discussed at
the end of the panel, Gibson said
that "the general trend may force
labor into more political action."
But Eliel was doubtful of this, say
ing that "a reshuffling of the deal
between the two existing parties is
much more likelv."
