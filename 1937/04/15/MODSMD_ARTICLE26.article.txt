# Parking Area To Be Ready In 2 Weeks
## Lagunita Wings; Outdoor Theater Seats Rushed Toward Completion 
### 
To solve a parking problem that
has made the area around the
library look like 5 o'clock on Chi
cago's Loop, work on a space to re
place the site of the Cubberly Edu
cation Building, is being speeded to
completion.
Graders are now at work, but the
rains have made the earth sticky
and the area is not expected to open
for two weeks. It is located on the
triangle of ground west of the li
brary bounded by Alvarado, Por
tola, and Arguello Streets. Orig
inally considered, the land between
the Library and Encina was re
jected because, according to pres
ent plans, it will eventually be the
site of a new building to house the
Hoover War Library.
Cost of surfacing the new area
with crushed rock is now being es
timated. J. W. McDonnell, super
intendent of buildings and grounds,
originally planned to use gravel re
moved from around the Education
Building to make way for landscap
ing. However, this rock is com
pletely covered with building mate
rial at present; consequently, the
new parking space will probably
have a dint surface.
filing Completed
Memorial Hall, the new citadel of
dramatic art, is progressing accord
ing to schedule. Ninety per cent of
the exterior plastering and tiling is
complete. Inside the building plas
tering is 80 per cent finished, and
terazzo floors have been laid. Fans,
air conditioning equipment, and fix
tures are being installed at present;
in two weeks the theater will be
ready for interior tile. Finishing
coats of plaster are being applied in
the vaulted foyer.
This week will mark completion
of the installation of seat terraces in
the amphitheater. Topsoil for plant
ing grass is being brought in from
the excavation at the Cubberly
Building. As planting forges ahead,
the earth structure is beginning to
really look like the great outdoor
auditorium visualized by A1 Roth
and Mr. Howard Frost, who financed
the project.
Education Building
Excavation for the new Education
Building will be finished this week,
and the last of the soil will be trans
ported to the amphitheater. Lumber
and other materials are arriving
daily, and building is scheduled to
start next Monday.
Two new wings on Lagunita
Court are being rushed toward com
pletion so that they will be ready
for occupancy at the start of fall
quarter. The left wing is ready for
steel work and concrete is being
poured for the right wing.
Farm's building program is march
ing on toward its goal, an unexcelled
educational plant.

jected because, according to pres
ent plans, it will eventually be the
site of a new building to house the
Hoover War Library.

with crushed rock is now being es
timated. J. W. McDonnell, super
