# Bible Music To Be Featured by Allen
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen will present an
organ recital at 4:15 this afternoon
in the Chapel.
The music to be played was in
spired by Biblical themes, and has
been especially requested because of
the Bible exhibit in the Art Gal
lery. Handel's "Overture to the
Oratorio 'Samson'," and "Sinfonia
from the Oratorio 'Saul'," Sigfrid
Karg-Elert's "In Deepest Need I
Cry to Thee," and "Fantasia on the
Liturgical Paternoster" by Herman
Grabner will be played.

One hundred Stanford students are
going to Europe this summer.
