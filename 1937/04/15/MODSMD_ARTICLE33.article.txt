# Tibbett Finds U.S. Cool Toward Opera
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
Americans don't understand opera and aren't interested in it, is the
opinion of Lawrence Tibbett, who will sing in the Pavilion tomorrow night.
I* roni long study of audience reaction, Tihhett says: "They are not in
terested and they have only a vague idea of what it is all about, except
that at o<ld moments the soprano kicks up a terrific row, the tenor waves

Â»his arms excitedly, and the baritone
scowls at everyone indiscriminately.
Because of his deep understand
ing of audiences, Mr. Tibbett is able
to create a great appeal in his own
Concerts. He believes in the im
portance of words and the fact that
operas should be translated into
English for American consumption.
Versatility Demanded
A glance at his program will show
the versatility it demands and also
the variety designed to present
something individual and appealing
to each listener.
Accompanied by Edward Harris,
Mr. Tibbett will sing as his first
group Mercantonio Cesti's "Oh
Whither Art Roaming," from "II
Pame d'Ora" and "I Am a Roamer
Bold," from "Son and Strangers,"
by Felix Mendelssohn.
His second group will consist of
"By the Sea" by Schubert, "While
Tramping" by Hugo Wolf, Rach
maninoff's "In the Silent Night,"
and Moussorgsky's "Death, the
Commander."
Accompanist Featured
Mr. Harris will then play "Min
strels," "The Girl with the Flaxen
Hair," and "Prelude in A Minor,"
all by Debussy, after which Tibbett
will sing Gerard's Monologue, "Nem
ico della Patria," from "Andrea
Chenier," by Umberto Giordono.
Following intermission, "Ah, Love
but a Day" by H. H. A. Beach,
Howard McKinney's "The Bagpipe
Man," Graham Peel's "In the Sum
mertime on Bredon," and Jacques
Wolfe's "De Hallelujah Rhythm"
will be presented.

liams and "Come Buy," from Shake
speare's "Winter's Tale" by Buzzi-
Peccia.
