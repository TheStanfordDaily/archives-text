HURT TODAY,
WELL TOMORROW
Tuesday Bill Paulman was on
crutches, carrying that same ankle
that was hurt last fall. Yesterday he
was off the crutches, but was limp
ing. Today he will be better than
that, and in a couple of days will be
back playing football.
It seems that when Bill's ankle
was in the cast last year, adhesions
developed in the tendons, or some
such affair, and the limits to which
he could bend his foot up and down
were cut down to a certain extent.
It was a natural condition resulting
from the long period of inactivity
inside the plaster.
Monday night he finally put
enough pressure on the foot to break
loose the adhesions, a cure that had
to come sooner or later before he
would be back in the best of shape.
The stretch naturally strained the
surrounding tissues a little, but
nothing serious has happened and
the ankle will really be better than
before when Bill gets back on it.
YES, YKS
Bob Wesson, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, has the right
idea. About every once in a while,
and sometimes oftener, he has some
stooge write a column for him and
labels it "contribution." Not only
does that give a guy a chance to let
somebody else stick his neck out and
see how it feels, but it also gives a
guy a chance to get a rest.
One of those stooges (you see his
name, or his initials, "C.R., '38," at
the end of The Brawn Patrol every
so often) wrote a blurb Tuesday,
and a creditable blurb it was, too,
from one sports nut to another. He
harangued for eight inches or so on
Cal athletes washing their hands and
so forth after every Stanford con
test, because they don't like to get
dirty playing with us old toughies,
and it was amusnig, to say the
least.
But then he said that the Cal nine
has forgotten all about the fight last
week-end, and is set on its drive for
the C.1.8.A. flag. To quote, "Santa
Clara today, Stanford twice more,
and the season is over. If every
thing breaks right, we may be able
to afford a loss in the final Stanford
game—as a sort of consolation
prize.."
Oh, now, you nasty old C.R. '38,
that isn't quite cricket. You know,
and we all know, that he's a joll—
no, no, that's not right. You know,
and we all know, that you will want
to win that last Stanford game just
as much as you wanted the first,
even though it won't mean as much
in a material way. And if Stanford
beats you, which is quite possible,
you must concede, it will be better
than a consolation prize for us dirty
old Indians.
In fact, the Indians will be highly
elated, and people don't usually get
highly elated over consolation
prizes.
And it certainly would be some
thing hilarious if we dirty old In
dians happened to beat your super
hyper-ultra-four square-Life Bouy
ized plantigrade carnivores (Ursi
dae, or just plain Bears to most
people) in the second game Satur
day, now wouldn't it?
