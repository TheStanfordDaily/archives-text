# Varsity Trackmen Draw League Bye
## 
### 
A week of light work is on the
menu for Dink Templeton's track
men these days, with an open date
coming this Saturday, and the Big
Meet a week later.
Even so, practice is proceeding,
as there is an informal get-together
with San Jose and San Mateo Friday,
and a trip to Berkeley Saturday to
see the Michigan-California dual
meet and .vork out on Edwards Field
afterward.
Yesterday Jack Weiershauser
turned in 48.8 and Bill McCurdy
49 flat in quarter-mile trials, while
Ray Malot ran 37.5 in a 352. An
other good effort of the day was
Hewitt's 24.4 in the lows, his best
yet this season.
