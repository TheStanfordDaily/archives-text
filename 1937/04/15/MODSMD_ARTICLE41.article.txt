# FRESHMEN MEET MODESTO SATURDAY
## 
### 
In what will very likely be the
toughest meet it will engage in this
season, with the exception of that
with California freshmen a week
later, Bill Ellington's freshman track
squad v/ill do battle with Modesto
Junior College next Saturday
morning on Angell Field.
Big gun of the J.C. outfit is How
ard Upton, a versatile lad who likes
to run a quarter-mile well under 50
seconds, and who, when needed, can
run a mean ppir of dash races.
The Modesto harriers did fairly
well for themselves last Saturday,
and the meet this week will afford
an excellent basis of comparison
between the California and Stan
ford teams.
The Card Babes will be hard hit
in the mile event on Saturday, and
possibly in the little Big Meet, by
the leg-muscle hemorrhage which
has laid low Jack Dixon.

Dixon aggravated an injury suf
fered last Wednesday in winning the
mile against the Contra Costa and
Alameda high school on
Saturday in the creditable time of
4:51, and will be definitely out
against Modesto, though there is a
possibility that he may run against
California.
The Frosh forces were further
depleted by the announcement tha
sprinter Bob Sengstack will be in
eligible for the remainder of the
quarter. Complete sprinting bur
dens will consequently fall upon
Jerry Sparling.
One ray of cheer, however, was
discerned on Tuesday in the run
ning by hurdler Dick Simpson of a
pair of 15.3 flights of highs. Simp
son, who has not been defeated in
either the highs or the lows this
year, claims 15.5 as his best previous
competitive time.
More than three million public
school children of 24 million in the
United States have some defect in
hearing.
