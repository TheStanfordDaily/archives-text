# Trojans Here Tomorrow For Revenge Game
## Seek to Settle Old Feud Begun in 1935 
### 
Trojan horsemen will be out to
settle an old feud when they meet
Captain Grubbs' Card horsemen
here on the highway polo field at 3
o'clock tomorrow.
It was in 1935 on the same field
that they took a 7-4 drubbing to
concede the Indians the intercol
legiate polo championship of the
coast. Last year in a* series of two
matches, one in the South and one
here, they came back to beat- the
Cards by one marker in both
games.
