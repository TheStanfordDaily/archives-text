# Ex Committee OK's Last Election Tally
## 
### 
Row winners breathed easier yesterday afternoon when Ex Committee,
with raised eyebrows, finally ratified Election Board Chairman Dave Alli
son's final report.
Approval of the six Committee members present at the special session
came only after an hour-long discussion of the mismanagement and ineffi-

ciency in handling yesterday's elec-'
tion.
The 145 votes thrown out last
night in the second presidential
count caused the most alarm when
committee members were afraid the
discard would illegalize the official
returns for the other seven offices
on the same ballot.
Recount of vice-presidential re
turns was asked by Barbara Kim
ball, Women's Conference chair
man. She felt that second-choice
returns would have differed if the
145 discarded ballots had been
thrown out for that office also. Bar
bara Murphy had won from Isabel
Goldthwaite on second choices.
Ballots Valid
After interviewing Allison, how
ever, Ex Committee decided that
illegal marking on presidential
choices would not throw out the en
tire ballot.
Bob Mallett, senior man, ques
tioned the fairness of the prefer
ential system itself. "How can you
vote intelligently for second and
third if you don't know the candi
dates?" he asked.
He favored a straight plurality to
win even though moi-e than two
candidates were running.
Committee Disapproves
Ex Committe was generally dis
satisfied with Allison's handling of
the election. The fact that 76 stu
dents —as determined in the Daily's
check of bawl-out proofs — could
vote at the wrong precinct showed
up inefficiency in Election Board's
poll management.
Allison declared that many of the
Election Board would not work, that
he had to use outside counters. Joe
Weiner, graduate member, saw a
chance in this situation for students
interested in the outcome of the
vote to come in and count the votes
their own way. Allison admitted
this was possible.
Returns corrected yesterday fol
low:
For A.S.S.U. president — Killcfer,
816 Dern, 783.
For vice-president—Murphy, 6G4;
Goldthwaite, 613; Brown, 471 (first
choices). Murphy, 897; Goldthwaite,
825 (first and second choices).
For Ex Committee graduate mem

poll management.
Allison declared that many of the
Election Board would not work, that
he had to use outside counters. Joe
Weiner, graduate member, saw a
chance in this situation for students
interested in the outcome of the
vote to come in and count the votes
their own way. Allison admitted
this was possible.
Returns corrected yesterday fol
low:
For A.S.S.U. president — Killcfer,
816 Dern, 783.
For vice-president—Murphy, 6G4;
Goldthwaite, 613; Brown, 471 (first
choices). Murphy, 897; Goldthwaite,
825 (first and second choices).
For Ex Committee graduate mem
ber—Williams, 1053; Klauber, 682
(first and second choices).
For W.A.A. president—Behr, 593
(unopposed).
Row winners breathed easier yesterday afternoon when Ex Committee,
with raised eyebrows, finally ratified Election Board Chairman Dave Alli
son's final report.
Approval of the six Committee members present at the special session
came only after an hour-long discussion of the mismanagement and ineffi-

ciency in handling yesterday's elec-'
tion.
The 145 votes thrown out last
night in the second presidential
count caused the most alarm when
committee members were afraid the
discard would illegalize the official
returns for the other seven offices
on the same ballot.
Recount of vice-presidential re
turns was asked by Barbara Kim
ball, Women's Conference chair
man. She felt that second-choice
returns would have differed if the
145 discarded ballots had been
thrown out for that office also. Bar
bara Murphy had won from Isabel
Goldthwaite on second choices.
Ballots Valid
After interviewing Allison, how
ever, Ex Committee decided that
illegal marking on presidential
choices would not throw out the en
tire ballot.
Bob Mallett, senior man, ques
tioned the fairness of the prefer
ential system itself. "How can you
vote intelligently for second and
third if you don't know the candi
dates?" he asked.
He favored a straight plurality to
win even though moi-e than two
candidates were running.
Committee Disapproves
Ex Committe was generally dis
satisfied with Allison's handling of
the election. The fact that 76 stu
dents —as determined in the Daily's
check of bawl-out proofs — could
vote at the wrong precinct showed
up inefficiency in Election Board's
poll management.
