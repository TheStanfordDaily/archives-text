# Down at the Count

TWENTY-NINE candidates were swept into
office Tuesday in what might have been the
dirtiest election in recent Stanford history.
Tweeds and Pendergasts would have gasped
with envy at the chances open for double-vot
ing, box-stuffing, crooked ballot-counting.
Not because Election Board was crooked, or
open to offers, but because Chairman Dave Al
lison and his aides didn't know what it was all
about.
When the polls opened Tuesday morning,
Election Board members were shoved behind
the voting tables, told to take over. But due to
the new system of two precincts, few of these
officials realized the correct procedure. As a
result, 76 students voted at the wrong poll.
That they could vote at the wrong precinct
without being caught by Board members on
duty brings up this fact—how easy it would
have been for any number of students to vote
twice, once at the Law Steps, again at the En
gineering Corner.
That a Daily check-up of marked bawl-out
proofs showed only two cases of double-voting
is no credit to Allison. If Hall or Row bosses
had wanted to stuff the box, they would have
met no trouble. As it was, some voters were
given two or three of the same ballots in the
between-classes rush.
Election Board inefficiency began with its
membership. Ex Committee appointed the staff,
but even Allison couldn't make it work. A hand
ful of bona fide Election Boarders (they're given
a dinner later this year) had to call in outsiders,
even Daily reporters, to help count votes. They
didn't realize—as someone in Ex Committee
pointed out yesterday—that only those person
ally interested in the outcome would bother
to work. One woman candidate reportedly
counted her own votes, and won.
Except for the presidential vote, the Board
and its pickups had the election settled by 8
o'clock. Killefer had won, they announced be
fore dinner, by a 36-point margin over Dern.
But after dinner Hall politicos convinced Alli
son that the vote was too close for comfort. The
chairman and his extralegal coaches —Zetes
and Toros looking out for their candidates —
recounted the A.S.S.U. ballots.
In this second count, 145 ballots were thrown
out, indicating the amazingly slipshod first
count. If 145 ballots were illegally marked in
the presidential bracket alone, how many
should have been thrown out for the other
races? The carelessness of the checkers was
astounding.
After the ballots for one of the women's of
fices had been counted, the result was a tie.
They were recounted. This time the winner led
by 100 votes. How often did this happen with
out being noticed?
Allison himself was hazy on nomination rul
ings a week before the election. If anyone
should have known the requirements, it was
he. But several caididates were told they were
not eligible because of insufficient bawl-out
units. For a while all candidates for senior man
had been disbarred and both Row and Hall were
stewing. Then Allison looked into the Con
stitution, found he had been wrong. The boys
could run after all.
These facts—some of them noticed by Daily
reporters at the polls and counting rooms Tues
day, some of them brought out in Ex Commit
tee's special session yesterday—are evidence
that Stanford's Election Board, and especially its
chairman, are guilty of gross negliqence and in
efficiency. D. B.

Election Board inefficiency began with its
membership. Ex Committee appointed the staff,
but even Allison couldn't make it work. A hand
ful of bona fide Election Boarders (they're given
a dinner later this year) had to call in outsiders,
even Daily reporters, to help count votes. They
didn't realize—as someone in Ex Committee
pointed out yesterday—that only those person
ally interested in the outcome would bother
to work. One woman candidate reportedly
counted her own votes, and won.
Except for the presidential vote, the Board
and its pickups had the election settled by 8
o'clock. Killefer had won, they announced be
fore dinner, by a 36-point margin over Dern.
But after dinner Hall politicos convinced Alli
son that the vote was too close for comfort. The
chairman and his extralegal coaches —Zetes
and Toros looking out for their candidates —
recounted the A.S.S.U. ballots.
In this second count, 145 ballots were thrown
out, indicating the amazingly slipshod first
count. If 145 ballots were illegally marked in
the presidential bracket alone, how many
should have been thrown out for the other
races? The carelessness of the checkers was
astounding.
After the ballots for one of the women's of
fices had been counted, the result was a tie.
They were recounted. This time the winner led
by 100 votes. How often did this happen with
out being noticed?
Allison himself was hazy on nomination rul
ings a week before the election. If anyone
should have known the requirements, it was
he. But several caididates were told they were
not eligible because of insufficient bawl-out
units. For a while all candidates for senior man
had been disbarred and both Row and Hall were
stewing. Then Allison looked into the Con
stitution, found he had been wrong. The boys
could run after all.
These facts—some of them noticed by Daily
reporters at the polls and counting rooms Tues
day, some of them brought out in Ex Commit
tee's special session yesterday—are evidence
that Stanford's Election Board, and especially its
chairman, are guilty of gross negliqence and in
efficiency. D. B.
TWENTY-NINE candidates were swept into
office Tuesday in what might have been the
dirtiest election in recent Stanford history.
Tweeds and Pendergasts would have gasped
with envy at the chances open for double-vot
ing, box-stuffing, crooked ballot-counting.
Not because Election Board was crooked, or
open to offers, but because Chairman Dave Al
lison and his aides didn't know what it was all
about.
When the polls opened Tuesday morning,
Election Board members were shoved behind
the voting tables, told to take over. But due to
the new system of two precincts, few of these
officials realized the correct procedure. As a
result, 76 students voted at the wrong poll.
That they could vote at the wrong precinct
without being caught by Board members on
duty brings up this fact—how easy it would
have been for any number of students to vote
twice, once at the Law Steps, again at the En
gineering Corner.
That a Daily check-up of marked bawl-out
proofs showed only two cases of double-voting
is no credit to Allison. If Hall or Row bosses
had wanted to stuff the box, they would have
met no trouble. As it was, some voters were
given two or three of the same ballots in the
between-classes rush.
