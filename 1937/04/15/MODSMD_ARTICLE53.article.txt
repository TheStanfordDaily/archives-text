# There's Still Room for Feet

ANOTHER campus opinionator drove his
spike into the Stanford parking maze prob
lem today, and five minutes later word came
from the Superintendent of Yards and Build
ings that Stanford would whack the maze situ
ation on the head with a new parking area to
be opened within two weeks.
Thus goes on record the fastest bit of service
campus opinion has been able to perform in
years, except for the fact that there was no con
nection in this case, and establishes the fact that
the way to air a gripe around Stanford is to
write about it —but not in the edit columns.
But now that the parking maze problem an
ticipates solution in the orthodox way—more
area—there comes a suggestion from my friend
who tells me what to say in editorials. He prom
ises it will do much to end the whole rat race.
"Try walking," my friend says, and though'it
does border on the unorthodox, there might be
something in it.
Spring is supposed to be here, and the sun
is supposed to be out (now it'll rain tomorrow)
and walking is supposed to be in vogue in the
spring when the sun is out.
And my friend—this rabid exponent of walk
—announces for the exclusive elucidation of
Stanfordites that the Row is supposed to be near
the Quad, and the Halls are supposed to be
near the Quad, so walking is supposed to be
the thing.
It's a good idea. Next time you start the two
block ride to the Quad, catch yourself at the
car door. Try walking. My friend says there's
something in it. —G. F.
