IT IS spring, now, you know. People turn up in
public places with tans on their faces without hav
ing to apologize for being out skiing. Trees are turn
ing green with or without envy because sometimes
envy doesn't live here anymore, at least not poison
envy. Anvyhow, the roses bud definitely, and the
shoots shoot the shoots. Oh, shucks.
It is spring, now, you know. And people go out in
the hills and sit down and come back again and sit
down. Some people drive out and drive back while
others walk out and walk back, while others are just
all in.
One who drove out was a lady friend and her
friend, and she dx'ove because her friend had a dog,
who is man's best friend next to his mother and some
times even a wife or two, and she drove because she
didn't want to get dog hairs off'n the seat beside the
driver.
So she drove out and stopped, and there was a
mare all alone in the field next, to the car. But rather
soon, the friend and friend decided that it would be a
good idea if they maybe left. So the lady stepped on
the starter, and the car wrenched itself over a few
times, vomited and stopped. Stepped on it. Stopped.
Frantically stepped on it. Stopped.
Finally, with a lurch, the car got under way, but
by the time it was shifted into high, there was a colt
standing beside the mare in the field next to the car.
¥ SUPPOSE everyone has heard by now that the only
man who went straight "A" in law school last year
performed his ablutions on the books at a certain es
tablishment up and down the highway (depending
on how, and ho woften, you look at it). He is studying
for the bar.
However, another astute gentleman back in the
goody-goody old days was going to law school and end
ed up by studying the cross-bar, and when he got older
became known as the boy coach.
He was doing very well in one course, except that
he never bothered to attend classes. When the end of
the quarter came around, the prof said he was going
to have to flunk him. This did not seem like a good
idea to the day coach, and he remonstrated. So the
prof offered to give him an ex, asking him whether
he wanted it written or oral.
The canny athlete knew that when the prof gave
oral exs, he asked questions only on the pages where
the book happened to open. He adjourned himself to
a bookstore, bought a new book, broke the binding so
that it automatically opened to one place, memorized
those two pages, and passed the oral wtih flying colors.

all in.
One who drove out was a lady friend and her
friend, and she dx'ove because her friend had a dog,
who is man's best friend next to his mother and some
times even a wife or two, and she drove because she
didn't want to get dog hairs off'n the seat beside the
driver.
So she drove out and stopped, and there was a
mare all alone in the field next, to the car. But rather
soon, the friend and friend decided that it would be a
good idea if they maybe left. So the lady stepped on
the starter, and the car wrenched itself over a few
times, vomited and stopped. Stepped on it. Stopped.
Frantically stepped on it. Stopped.
Finally, with a lurch, the car got under way, but
by the time it was shifted into high, there was a colt
standing beside the mare in the field next to the car.
¥ SUPPOSE everyone has heard by now that the only
man who went straight "A" in law school last year
performed his ablutions on the books at a certain es
tablishment up and down the highway (depending
on how, and ho woften, you look at it). He is studying
for the bar.
However, another astute gentleman back in the
goody-goody old days was going to law school and end
ed up by studying the cross-bar, and when he got older
became known as the boy coach.
He was doing very well in one course, except that
he never bothered to attend classes. When the end of
the quarter came around, the prof said he was going
to have to flunk him. This did not seem like a good
idea to the day coach, and he remonstrated. So the
prof offered to give him an ex, asking him whether
he wanted it written or oral.
The canny athlete knew that when the prof gave
oral exs, he asked questions only on the pages where
the book happened to open. He adjourned himself to
a bookstore, bought a new book, broke the binding so
that it automatically opened to one place, memorized
those two pages, and passed the oral wtih flying colors.
IT IS spring, now, you know. People turn up in
public places with tans on their faces without hav
ing to apologize for being out skiing. Trees are turn
ing green with or without envy because sometimes
envy doesn't live here anymore, at least not poison
envy. Anvyhow, the roses bud definitely, and the
shoots shoot the shoots. Oh, shucks.
It is spring, now, you know. And people go out in
the hills and sit down and come back again and sit
down. Some people drive out and drive back while
others walk out and walk back, while others are just
all in.
