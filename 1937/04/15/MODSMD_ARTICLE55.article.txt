# BULL SESSION
## POTBOILING PLUG FOR A JOLLY-UP 
### 
r rHE old adage that women should be seen and not
heard niay be generally a generalization but
there is at least one instance where it tells a specific
story. And that is in the case of the woman who coyly
coos that she just loves swing music.
The quasi-epic fable illustrating how the woman
tries to appreciate the ocean by standing at the brink
of a mud-puddle tells about a darling dope who sat
next to an engineer at a banquet and asked him if it
was fun pulling the whistle when they got near a
station.

At that, though, it may be wrong to class the aver
age female who has fallen in with the swing hysteria
with the stupid cutie at the banquet, if only on (he
grounds that the average female was propagandized
into a bogus love for something she really never knew
anything about.
The advertisements of women's apparel have seized
on the word swing (and now they have added sway)
with all the avidity of the American Tobacco Corpora
tion finding a U.S. senator who smokes Luckies and
not cigars. S® thereupon instead of Empress Eugenie
gowns and chic-chapeaux the advertisements have
gone native American and for the moment we have
swing skirts and swing hats.
It is the old story of calling some 15-cent-a-quart
smelly water "parfum" and selling it by the ounce
over a plush counter.
4 FEW female souls with the heart of true lovers of
ginmill music listen for more than the words of
a sugar vocal chorus, and a few honest women still
stand pat with Guy Lombardo, but the great mob are
really just suckers for the sentimental after all, de
spite a song like this:
"000-00, do you like Benny Goodman tooo-ooo?'
Oh Lord forgive them, they know not what they
(It M >0-000.
