The Editor, Sir:
I did not write nor in any respect
authorize the letter published over
my name in Wednesday's Daily; nor
does it represent my views at the
present time.

Editor)
The Editor, Sir:
The article appearing in Wednes
day's Daily mentioning "a mammoth
air show extravaganza" at the Palo
Alto Airport on Saturday is not in
line with the plans or promises of
the airport officials.
We agreed to turn over three of
our ships on Saturday and to sup
ply pilots to fly passengers at $1
each, which proceeds would be col
lected by the Stanford Flying Club
and tui'ned over by them to the Con
valescent Drive. In order to increase
interest we arranged to have a num
ber of East Bay and San Francisco
ships visit the airport during the
afternoon and to have air demon
strations by the Oakland Naval Re
serve Base pilots and the Stanford
Club.
We promise an interesting after
noon and some cash for the conval
escents — but it will be somewhat
short of a "mammoth extravaganza."
No discredit to the Daily for we
know how such a story develops.
We hope you will print this so that
the flying club and our company
will not be accuscd of misrepresen
tation.
Joe Donovan,
