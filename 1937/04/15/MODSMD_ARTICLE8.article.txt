Modern thinking and change in
J education is requiring training in
â€¢ more than a narrow field, according
to Dean Grayson N. Kefauver, of
I the School of Education, who spoke
| last night in the second of a series
of Vocational Guidance talks spon
sored by the Stuednt-Faculty Rela
tions committee.
Dean Kefauver stressed the fact
that teaching is a task of social
leadership, and that students who
plan to enter the teaching field
| should feel themselves capable of
this leadership.
The field of engineering was dis
cussed at the same time by Dean
Samuel B. Morris, of the School of
Engineering. Perserverance, stam
ina, and energy were cited as the
! prerequiistes of anyone planning
to enter that field. While there is
! always room for good engineers.
Dean Morris said, there is a real
need at this time for petroleum en
! gineers.
