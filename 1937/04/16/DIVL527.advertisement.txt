Louise Mulligan
FASHIONS
To begin with, Louise Mulligan is fresh
out-of-college herself. She knows the
tricks of "nipping in" waists, adding a
little flower here, a skillful tuck there
... where you'd least expect it. She cuts
her jackets short so they "cut a cunning
figure." Each dress individually named
and styled. Just three pictured here,
but there are lots of others just as
smart... the absolute tops for after
noon and street wear, now on through
summer. Colors like Cornelian, wild
strawberry, limelight, black, navy,
beige. Sizes 11 to 17.
