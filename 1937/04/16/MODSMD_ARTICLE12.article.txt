Chairman Dave Allison of the ]
Election Board denied yesterday the j
I Dailv's charges of "gross negligence
and inefficiency" in Tuesday's stu
dent body elections.
j Declaring that numerous recounts
: of votes l-esulted from unavoidable j
j human errors, Allison defended the
' use of two polling places and upheld
! the much-criticized preferential bal- ,
I lot now used.
Throw Out Ballots
j Allison admitted that he threw out
| 145 presidential ballots that did not
j name a second choice, averring that
| he did this at the suggestion of Roy 1
["Anderson and Chick Franich. "I
i saved the ballots," he said, "and
would have investigated their le
gality more carefully if the change
had made a difference in who car
ried the election."
With reference to voters who cast
ballots at both of the two polls, Al--
lison said that voting was done on
the honor system. Besides, he said,
people can vote twice when there is
only one voting place by finding the
names of students who do not in
tend to vote. "One person voted five |
times this way the last time a single '
voting place was used," he declared.

i contending that the preferential

As to the problem of personal fa
voritism among volunteer vote
counters, Allison declared that this
has been the method for a long time.
"'I can see no reason for enlarging
■the Election Board," he said, "be
i cause there has been nothing
crooked as long as I can remember."
He maintained that candidates
counting their own votes would bo
more scrupulous than anyone else,
since they would be the first to be
suspected.
