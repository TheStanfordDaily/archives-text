Birth and death of a news story.
Voice on Daily phone:
"This is Pete. Just was with the
Chronicle correspondent when he
called in that Navy Blimp Tl3 fell
into the bay tonight. Redwood City
boats are searching. Some cement
worker says he saw it fall."
"Sounds sorta phoney, Pete. We'll
check."
Daily calling Sunnyvale:
"Hear the Tl3 is in the Bay."
"Hell, no, she's sittin' out here
in the hangar."
Talk in Daily office:
"Those fellows might be holding
out.
Chronicle correspondent phoning
into main office after checking:
"I've just been down there look
ing at the little girl. Got Tl3 paint
ed all over her. Seen her with my
own peepers. She's there all right."
