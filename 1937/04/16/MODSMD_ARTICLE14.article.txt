### HUNTER HENDEE 
"HEY! WHERE'S THAT PORTER.'" shout these Convalescent
Home kiddies. They're ready for their afternoon nap. as much a mat
ter of routine a:; our eight-o'clocks, hut a hit nicer.

You may think Stanford's Con
valescent Home is just another Farm
fixture nobody hears about till his
second or third quarter on campus.
You may think so; but if you do
you're wrong.
When the Home's real function is
understood it is easy to see why its
reputation extends far beyond the
territpry whose children it nurses
and whose charity supports it.
Ilomc Unique
In its field il stands alone—a mod
lel for future convalescent homes
| which someday will meet a need
| modern hospitals are helpleiss to an
| swer.
That is the need for a mean be
! tween two extremes: hospitals and
: homes. As Mrs. Ruth Atwood, di
| rector of Stanford's home, puts it:
"A person is not one day sick and
the next day well. There is a real
[ need for homes for convalescents—
; those too healthy to be happy in hos
i pitals, yet still too run-down to be
! healthy at home."
Wide Scope
But Stanford Home for Conval
j escent Children is even wider in
' scope than its name implies. It
treats bed patients as well as up
i and - arounders, providing much -
j needed doctors and trained nurses
ias well as sunshine and school
■ books.
Just how beneficial a diet of sun
shine can be is well illustrated by
j the much-publicized case of Doro
| thy Gilbert, who was little more
j than just ashes of a Hallowe-en
i bonfire when she came to Stanford's
Home.
Miracle Cure
She had lost two-thirds of her
I skin from burns; specialists of Oak-
I land's Highland Hospital sent her to

Palo Alto for little reason other
than that her last hours might be
sunny ones. She was bound to die
—Dorothy knew it and waited pa
tiently.
What happened is well known.
City papers ran columns about it
under headlines like "Nature Works
Miracle Cure." AnjJ a miracle cure
it was. For when she left the Home
10 months later her horrible burns
had been healed, completely and
without operation. Sunshine and
Convalescent Home care were re
sponsible.
