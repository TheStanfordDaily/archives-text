# Chinese To Aid Play Direction
## Ming Woo, Card Grad, Will Train Actors 
### 
Assistant director to Gordon
Lange for Dramatic Council's spring
production of "Lady Precious
Stream" will be Francis Ts Ming
Woo, a native of Shanghai, who Is
doing graduate work in chemistry
here at Stanford, it was announced
yesterday.
Among the problems with which
he is faced in teaching Farm actors
to perform their parts in the accept
ed Chinese manner is that of show
ing them all the Chinese gestures
which accompany specific thoughts
and emotions. He also finds that
American amateurs use too much
motion, and when they speak they
boom.
Mr. Woo must also teach the Stan
ford rough to walk as if his feet
were bound, and to use fans which
are from 14 to 16 inches long. The
women will carry smaller long
ones 6 to 12 inches.
In addition to the actors them
selves, the property men must be
especially trained, since in China
these men are an integral part of the
performance, supplying much of the
spontaneous humor by their prac
tical jokes on the actors.
Mr. Woo has seen "Lady Precious
Stream" performed in China, and
later played the role of the prime
minister, Wang, himself. He is a
graduate of St. John's University in
Shanghai, where he was very active
in campus dramatic productions.
