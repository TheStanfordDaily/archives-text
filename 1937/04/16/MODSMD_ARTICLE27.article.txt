America i.-i in a better position
than any other nation in the world j
j to close her doors and remain neu- ;
' tral in the face of a European war.
It would be foolish to contend that j
j any nation could or should be self
j sufficient for a great period of time, j
! Nevertheless, if we in this country j
| were willing to forego the economic j
I advantages of trade and war profi- j
j teering during the period of conflict, ;
| we certainly would not perish for '
I want of the necessities of life. A
stand .such as this would be based ;
on the realization that the economic j
I hardships of neutrality are less than 1
! the penalties of war.
| America's endowment of natural
j resources would make it possible for
| us to produce practically everything
I necessary to keep us reasonably
' comfortable during a period of war.
We have also the potential advan
tage of furthering reciprocal trade
with our neighbors in Central and j
South America.
Needless to say we cannot de- j
pend, solely, upon the integrity or !
patriotism of our people, to main

j tain neutrality. Stringent laws will
I be necessary to curb those who seek
j profits from war. Our present neu
i trality laws seem to show a definite
; trend in the direction of "enforced
I neutrality." These laws, if com
bined with a strong public feeling,
j aroused through educational cam
j paigns and peace propaganda, could
indeed be most effective in main
! taining neutrality.
The question "Can America Stay
| Out of a European War?" can be
1 answered in the affirmative if Amer
ica is willing to accept the economic
sacrifices and social burdens of neu
i trality.
NO
Says JOHN DERN
When comes it der revolution—or,
more appropriately right now, the
next conflagration of warfare, you
and I have just one of two alterna
tives to follow. If we are chicken,
unmoved by patriotic frenzy, and
unwilling to die, we can join Col.
