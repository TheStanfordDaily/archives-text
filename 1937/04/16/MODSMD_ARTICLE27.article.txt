' tral in the face of a European war.
It would be foolish to contend that j
j any nation could or should be self
j sufficient for a great period of time, j
! Nevertheless, if we in this country j
| were willing to forego the economic j
I advantages of trade and war profi- j
j teering during the period of conflict, ;
| we certainly would not perish for '
I want of the necessities of life. A
stand .such as this would be based ;
on the realization that the economic j
I hardships of neutrality are less than 1

| America's endowment of natural
j resources would make it possible for

I necessary to keep us reasonably
' comfortable during a period of war.
We have also the potential advan
tage of furthering reciprocal trade
with our neighbors in Central and j
South America.
Needless to say we cannot de- j
pend, solely, upon the integrity or !
patriotism of our people, to main

j tain neutrality. Stringent laws will

It would be foolish to contend that j
j any nation could or should be self
j sufficient for a great period of time, j
! Nevertheless, if we in this country j

I advantages of trade and war profi- j
j teering during the period of conflict, ;

I want of the necessities of life. A
stand .such as this would be based ;
on the realization that the economic j
I hardships of neutrality are less than 1

I necessary to keep us reasonably
' comfortable during a period of war.
We have also the potential advan

with our neighbors in Central and j
South America.
Needless to say we cannot de- j
pend, solely, upon the integrity or !
patriotism of our people, to main

bined with a strong public feeling,
j aroused through educational cam
j paigns and peace propaganda, could
indeed be most effective in main

well to plunge in immediately, enlist,
and get it over with.
For in my humble opinion, when
this big keg of powder that we to
day call the modern world Ls set off
one of these days, our country is
just as certain of co-operating in the
resulting war is humpty dumpty
was of falling off his wall.
The following reflections make me
think so:
Our trade connections and en
tanglements throughout the entire
world . . . Our shipping interests
. . . Our ships which are first im
periled and then blown up . . .
Our loans and investments abroad
and the risk of their complete loss
. . . Profiteers and munition mak
ers . . . The economic recollection
that as demand for goods increases,
prices and profits likewise increase
. . . and American business men
are those who are most likely to
enjoy said profits . . . Racial an
tagonism . . . Fear of the other fel
low . . . Realization that treaties
and pacts do not enforce themselves
(the Kellogg Pact, for example,
didn't prevent Italy from making
breakfast food out of Ethiopia) . . .
The tremendous advance of trans
portation facilities which have put
us in much closer range of Europe
than we wex - e in 1917.
But most of all, our peculiarly
American way of getting deceived.
We fail to recognize foreign propa
ganda, and particularly when we are
succumbing to it. We arc deceived
in such idealism as making the world
safe for democracy. It's our honor
to go into war and a reflection on
our character if we don't.
When the bands start playing,
let's enlist early. We'll have to soon
er or later, for Americans just don't
know how to stay out of war.
