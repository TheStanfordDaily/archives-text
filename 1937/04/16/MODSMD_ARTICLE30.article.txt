# Variety of Costumes Suggested for Ball
## 
### 
Now that elections are over, and
the victors safely ensconsed in their
various offices, the major problem
confronting a collective Stanford
seems to be what to wear to the
Farm's Coronation â€” the Masque
Ball, to be held on April 23.
Among those present will be rep
resentatives from all nations. Eski
mos will appear in their hooded
parkas, Bavarians in dirndl and le
derhosen, Arabs in turbans and
sheets, and Hawaiians in the per
ennial grass skirts.
Internationally known personali
ties such as iron-jawed Mussolini,
beetle-browed Stalin, and tooth
brush - moustached Hitler will be
jogging around with Lady Astor,
Queen Wilhclmina of the Nether
lands, and Amelia Earhart Putnam.
Perhaps Mahatma Ghandi will

arrive in his proverbial .sheet and
safety-pin and converse with the
king's favorite Scotch bartender.
Palace gardeners may dunce with
Park Avenue debutantes.
And from among the motley as
sortment present a king and queen of
the ball will be chosen by means of
the selective process of drawing lots.
