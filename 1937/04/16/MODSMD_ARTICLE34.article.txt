### HERB ALWARD 
Edward Maslin Hulme arrived at |
Stanford 45 years ago with $40 in !
his pocket and five years of gram- |
mar school behind him; ho will re
tire from active teaching at the end J
of summer quarter, long recognized
as a great authority in his field of j
history, and revered as one of the I
finest lecturers Stanford has ever
known.
Graduating from Stanford after
completing a course of five years, at
the same time editing the 1897 Quad j
and Sequoia, the Literary magazine, j
Mr. Hulme taught school for three j
years in Portland, Oregon. Before j
lie left there for graduate study at j
Cornell and Harvard, he had in- I
fluenced many young friends to come j
to Stanford.
Studied in Paris
Next he went to the Sorbonne in ,
Paris as a traveling scholar. There i
he studied in his favorite field of i
Rennaissance history.
Returning to the United States, he
accepted an assistant professorship
at the University of Idaho. There, i
in 1917, he was made dean of the j
College of Letters and Sciences.
While at Idaho, Mr. Hulme wrote
and published his famous valume, [
"Rennaissance and Reformation," j
which is now used throughout the'

| United States by more than 80 col
i leges as a standard text. With the
j appearance of this work Mr. Hulme
| was acclaimed in England and the
| United States as an important his
torian.
Returned in M2I
Since his return here in 1.921, Mr.
i Hulme has served on the faculty of
the Department of History, as well
as on the summer faculties of many
other important universities.
It is his opinion lhat there is much
I to be desired in the present systems
I of training educators, that teachers
I "must be gifted, like poets," that
; there is too much regimentation in
j the prescribed courses, and that
| doctors' theses are too restricted.
When Edward Maslin Hulme is
j elevated to the emeritus rank at the
end of summer quarter, he will em
i bark on a course of writing which
jhe has long planned. First of his
j works will be a "glorified travel
| book, "Motoring Through France."
Another simile: As uninteresting
; as a list of sweepstakes ticket hold
ers who didn't win anything.
Latin and Bohemian.
j Over GO per cent of the Stanford
J student body is partially seif-sup
' porting.
