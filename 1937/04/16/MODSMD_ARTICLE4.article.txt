CHICAGO, April 15 (U.R).—
William Guzan, 21, spooned out
the last of a dish of ice cream
early today, loosened his belt
and claimed the long-distance,
catch - as - catch - can eating
championship of West Madison
Street.
"I think they held out on me,"
he said. "I could have eaten
more."
It was the end of approxi
mately ten and a half hours of
steady eating for the lanky,
dark-haired youth who at 8:30
o'clock last night took a restau
rant proprietor at his word and
sat down to eat his fill.
"I was polishing off a dish of
Italian spaghetti and meat balls
last night," he said, "when a pal
came in and told me about this
place where a sign outside said:
'All you can eat for 50 cents'."
Still hungry, William set off
to see what he could do.
