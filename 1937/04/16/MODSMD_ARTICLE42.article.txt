## 
### GENE GEAR 
Twelve Cardinal swimmers will
swing aboard n Los Angeles-bound
i train tonight on a mission of re
j venge.
Last week the California Bears
i came to life and upset the Indian
dignity with a startling 44Vfe-30Vfe
win. In the conference champion
ships in the U.S.C. pool tomorrow,
those same Bear swimmers will en
] ter the meet favorites to take their
j first conference swim crown.
Lead for 17 Years
For the first 17 years of confer
! ence competition the Stanford mer
men dominated the picture with
I little opposition. For the past three
J years, the terrible Trojans have
1 perched on top of the aquatic heap,
i Cal has never come close to annex
ing the title and neither have the
Bruins of U.C.L.A.
The wise money boys are doping
I Cal first with 52 points, Stanford sec-
I ond with 50, U.S.C. third with 42, and
! U.C.L.A., 24. This would give the
I Trojans four first places, the Bears
i four, and the Bruins one.
Roy Winkelman, ace Card diver,
has beaten Herold of U.C.L.A. this
! year and will have every chance to
| upset him down south. Wink is only
rated third place behind Herold and
j Farquhar of Cal.
Sprint' Battles
Hatch of Troy is rated the favor
| ite in both the 50 and the 100, but
1 Dick Clarke, Indian sprinter, has
! different ideas about the situation.

Clarke has every chance to surprise
with a win in either event.
The 220 should be the best race of
the day when Troy's Bob Boales,
Cal's Jim Shields, and Stanford's
Win Needham match strokes. All
are capable of better than 2:20.
Needham is only rated third behind
Shields and Boales.
Frosh Star
Sjoencer Moeller, star frosh sprint
man of last year has joined the
squad for the first time this season
and will add strength to the 400-
yard freestyle relay team.
The following men are making the
trip: Sprints and relay — Clarke,
MacKonzie, Moeller, Captain Sca
tena. Distances — Needham, Rider,
Peterson. Backstroke — Weatherbe,
Letteau. Breastsroke—Towne, Hatch.
