# FROSH EDITION
## 
### 
Frosh members of The Daily
staff will take over the tiller
long enough to put out next
Monday's edition, while the
rest of the staff extends its
week-end vacation far into
Sunday night with an after
noon off in the hills some
where.
Polution from staid upper
classman ideas will be pre
vented by a fine of 10 cents on
all doddering oldsters who
mosey around Sunday night to
the Shack.
