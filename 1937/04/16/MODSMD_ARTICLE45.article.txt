GO AHEAD AND
SHOW HIM UP, ED
Ed Burrows has been having a
terrible time, trying to get back to
the shape he was in last track sea
son before he broke that ankle.
Dink Tenipleton has been doing his
darnedest to get the gangling gal
loper to run a real race just once,
but Ed can't seem to get under
way. Every time he runs a mile, he
practically collapses along in the
third lap somewhere, and then finds
he has enough left to run a strong
last lap. However, he can't get over
that habitual pause in the third
circle.
Wednesday night Dink had Ed
run three laps, and after a lot of
coaxing got him to het that he
could run 3:15. Now, by all rights
Ed should be able to whip over a 1
3:15 three - lapper without any
trouble. However, the usual
pause came pretty late in the race,
and then Ed finished the race in *!
good shape, but he lost four bits
by not doing 3:15. He did 3:19.1.
Now, Dink has been kidding Ed |
about looking just like Bob Heavey
of Cal, who was a pretty good miler
last year but who has been suffer
ing from the- same quitting trouble
as Ed this year. He, too, can't seem
to get out of the rut, and so Dink
has. hopped on that for ridicule as a
possible way to keep Ed from dog
ging it, but nothing has come of it
yet.
Half an hour after that three
lap race Wednesday, Dink put Ed |
in a two-mile, which is eight laps. ,
And every time Ed would come j
around in front of Dink, the boy
coach would yell something like, |
"How are you doing, Heavey?" j
(Nonetheless, Ed kept dropping
back, and he had a terrible time
getting through a couple of the
late laps, but he came all right at i
the finish and he wasn't as tired \
when he got in as he might have !
been. '
As he walked over to the chair, i
Dink said, "I didn't know you wore |
size 15 shoes." (Brother Heavey,
you see, has large feet.)
Between puffs, Burrows came back j
with what should be classed as a i
pretty good response. Said he, "I I
don't ordinarily, but I've been run- !
ning so much my feet have swelled j
up."
IT'LL BE A
TRACK TEAM YET
You never can tell, fellers, just j
what's going to happen at track
meets. Why, for all we know Stan- j
ford may still be able to beat U.S.C.
this year, in spite of the fact that |
they walloped Cal last week, some- j
thing like 79-52.
Hilmei;Lodge, who is quite a track ;
nut, as most anybody around the ;
gym can tell you, made out. a dope j
sheet on last week's figures from j
the track meets, and when he had
finished, he added up the points and |
10, Stanford had '71 and U.S.C. had j
59!
Now, "Homo," or "Monkey- !
face," as Dink Tcmpleton affec
tionately calls H., is quite an op- !
timist where Stanford track and
field teams arc concerned. He's j
sort of like Brick Morse and Cali- i
fornia, only I think I like Hilmer

better. Everybody laughs at him
because he thinks Stanford has a
chance against U.S.C., including
the track men themselves, but
don't let that fool you. Hilmer is
good for the track team, he's one
of the best little morale-builders
you ever saw. and although a win
over Troy still looks hopeless, the
Cards ought to do better against
Cromwell's boys than the Bears
did.
Remember, Jim Reynolds will be
back on the squad by the time of
the U.S.C. meet, two weks from
now, and even though he hasn't had
any practice for a long time, he
should be good enough to take sev
eral points in shot and discus. He
will be quite an aid to the team,
which already, you must remember,
1 didn't do so bad with that 80-50 vic
; tory over Washington.
Yes, if Stanford beats U.S.C. Hil
; mer is going to look better than the
guys that picked Braddock over
I Baer, but at the same time there is
i a certain amount of wisdom in his
; words. And things certainly are
looking up for the Big Meet one
j week hence, in addition.

10, Stanford had '71 and U.S.C. had j
59!
Now, "Homo," or "Monkey- !
face," as Dink Tcmpleton affec
tionately calls H., is quite an op- !
timist where Stanford track and
field teams arc concerned. He's j
sort of like Brick Morse and Cali- i
fornia, only I think I like Hilmer

better. Everybody laughs at him
because he thinks Stanford has a
chance against U.S.C., including
the track men themselves, but
don't let that fool you. Hilmer is
good for the track team, he's one
of the best little morale-builders
you ever saw. and although a win
over Troy still looks hopeless, the
Cards ought to do better against
Cromwell's boys than the Bears
did.
Remember, Jim Reynolds will be
back on the squad by the time of
the U.S.C. meet, two weks from
now, and even though he hasn't had
any practice for a long time, he
should be good enough to take sev
eral points in shot and discus. He
will be quite an aid to the team,
which already, you must remember,
1 didn't do so bad with that 80-50 vic
; tory over Washington.
Yes, if Stanford beats U.S.C. Hil
; mer is going to look better than the
guys that picked Braddock over
I Baer, but at the same time there is
i a certain amount of wisdom in his
; words. And things certainly are
looking up for the Big Meet one
j week hence, in addition.

GO AHEAD AND
SHOW HIM UP, ED
Ed Burrows has been having a
terrible time, trying to get back to
the shape he was in last track sea
son before he broke that ankle.
Dink Tenipleton has been doing his
darnedest to get the gangling gal
loper to run a real race just once,
but Ed can't seem to get under
way. Every time he runs a mile, he
practically collapses along in the
third lap somewhere, and then finds
he has enough left to run a strong
last lap. However, he can't get over
that habitual pause in the third
circle.
Wednesday night Dink had Ed
run three laps, and after a lot of
coaxing got him to het that he
could run 3:15. Now, by all rights
Ed should be able to whip over a 1
3:15 three - lapper without any
trouble. However, the usual
pause came pretty late in the race,
and then Ed finished the race in *!
good shape, but he lost four bits
by not doing 3:15. He did 3:19.1.
Now, Dink has been kidding Ed |
about looking just like Bob Heavey
of Cal, who was a pretty good miler
last year but who has been suffer
ing from the- same quitting trouble
as Ed this year. He, too, can't seem
to get out of the rut, and so Dink
has. hopped on that for ridicule as a
possible way to keep Ed from dog
ging it, but nothing has come of it
yet.
Half an hour after that three
lap race Wednesday, Dink put Ed |
in a two-mile, which is eight laps. ,
And every time Ed would come j
around in front of Dink, the boy
coach would yell something like, |
"How are you doing, Heavey?" j
(Nonetheless, Ed kept dropping
back, and he had a terrible time
getting through a couple of the
late laps, but he came all right at i
the finish and he wasn't as tired \
when he got in as he might have !
been. '
As he walked over to the chair, i
Dink said, "I didn't know you wore |
size 15 shoes." (Brother Heavey,
you see, has large feet.)
Between puffs, Burrows came back j
with what should be classed as a i
pretty good response. Said he, "I I
don't ordinarily, but I've been run- !
ning so much my feet have swelled j
up."
IT'LL BE A
TRACK TEAM YET
You never can tell, fellers, just j
what's going to happen at track
meets. Why, for all we know Stan- j
ford may still be able to beat U.S.C.
this year, in spite of the fact that |
they walloped Cal last week, some- j
thing like 79-52.
Hilmei;Lodge, who is quite a track ;
nut, as most anybody around the ;
gym can tell you, made out. a dope j
sheet on last week's figures from j
the track meets, and when he had

ging it, but nothing has come of it
yet.
Half an hour after that three
lap race Wednesday, Dink put Ed |
in a two-mile, which is eight laps. ,
And every time Ed would come j
around in front of Dink, the boy
coach would yell something like, |
"How are you doing, Heavey?" j
(Nonetheless, Ed kept dropping
back, and he had a terrible time
getting through a couple of the
late laps, but he came all right at i
the finish and he wasn't as tired \
when he got in as he might have !
been. '
As he walked over to the chair, i
Dink said, "I didn't know you wore |
size 15 shoes." (Brother Heavey,
you see, has large feet.)
Between puffs, Burrows came back j
with what should be classed as a i
pretty good response. Said he, "I I
don't ordinarily, but I've been run- !
ning so much my feet have swelled j
up."
IT'LL BE A
TRACK TEAM YET
You never can tell, fellers, just j
what's going to happen at track
meets. Why, for all we know Stan- j
ford may still be able to beat U.S.C.
this year, in spite of the fact that |
they walloped Cal last week, some- j
thing like 79-52.
Hilmei;Lodge, who is quite a track ;
nut, as most anybody around the ;
gym can tell you, made out. a dope j
sheet on last week's figures from j
the track meets, and when he had
finished, he added up the points and |
10, Stanford had '71 and U.S.C. had j
59!
Now, "Homo," or "Monkey- !
face," as Dink Tcmpleton affec
tionately calls H., is quite an op- !
timist where Stanford track and
field teams arc concerned. He's j
sort of like Brick Morse and Cali- i
fornia, only I think I like Hilmer

better. Everybody laughs at him
because he thinks Stanford has a
chance against U.S.C., including
the track men themselves, but
don't let that fool you. Hilmer is
good for the track team, he's one
of the best little morale-builders
you ever saw. and although a win
over Troy still looks hopeless, the
Cards ought to do better against
Cromwell's boys than the Bears
did.
Remember, Jim Reynolds will be
back on the squad by the time of
the U.S.C. meet, two weks from
now, and even though he hasn't had
any practice for a long time, he
should be good enough to take sev
eral points in shot and discus. He
will be quite an aid to the team,
which already, you must remember,
1 didn't do so bad with that 80-50 vic
; tory over Washington.
Yes, if Stanford beats U.S.C. Hil
; mer is going to look better than the
guys that picked Braddock over
I Baer, but at the same time there is
i a certain amount of wisdom in his
; words. And things certainly are
looking up for the Big Meet one
j week hence, in addition.

GO AHEAD AND
SHOW HIM UP, ED
Ed Burrows has been having a
terrible time, trying to get back to
the shape he was in last track sea
son before he broke that ankle.
Dink Tenipleton has been doing his
darnedest to get the gangling gal
loper to run a real race just once,
but Ed can't seem to get under
way. Every time he runs a mile, he
practically collapses along in the
third lap somewhere, and then finds
he has enough left to run a strong
last lap. However, he can't get over
that habitual pause in the third
circle.
Wednesday night Dink had Ed
run three laps, and after a lot of
coaxing got him to het that he
could run 3:15. Now, by all rights
Ed should be able to whip over a 1
3:15 three - lapper without any
trouble. However, the usual
pause came pretty late in the race,
and then Ed finished the race in *!
good shape, but he lost four bits
by not doing 3:15. He did 3:19.1.
Now, Dink has been kidding Ed |
about looking just like Bob Heavey
of Cal, who was a pretty good miler
last year but who has been suffer
ing from the- same quitting trouble
as Ed this year. He, too, can't seem
to get out of the rut, and so Dink
has. hopped on that for ridicule as a
possible way to keep Ed from dog
ging it, but nothing has come of it
yet.
