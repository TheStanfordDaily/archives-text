# Frosh Lose To Jefferson High
## Yearlings To Meet Club Squad to End Season 
### 
In an eight-inning battle, the
j Stanford freshman baseball team
wound up their practice season with
j a 9-6 loss to Jefferson High School
| of Daly City yesterday at the local
f diamond.
The Jefferson batmen touched Bill
I Ballhaus, Stanford starting pitcher,
! for seven runs before Hugh Gallar
neau was sent in to stem the tide.
The latter hurler blanked the high
j school men until the eighth inning,
I when Jefferson pushed over two
! more runs.
j To the Tribe's second sacker,
j "Dee" DeLauer, went the day's bat
ting honors. He collected safe blows
! four out of five times.
Tomorrow the freshmen will jour
| ney up to Berkeley in an effort to
I clinch the annual series with the Cal
| first-year men. A victory by the
j Shipkey-Grayson men would bring
; the season to a close. However, if
j Stanford should lose, they will play
ja deciding game with Cal next Fri
| day here.
