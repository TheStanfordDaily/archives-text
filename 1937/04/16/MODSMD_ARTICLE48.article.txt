# Stanford Nine, Cal Will Play Second Game
## Spike Furman To Pitch Against Bears Again; Clash Start at 2:30 
### 
Spike Furman, big right-hander
who pitched excellent ball, except
for the first inning, against the Cali- i
fornia Bears here last Saturday, will
start on the mound again for the j
Indians when the two teams meet |
for the second time this year tomor- j
row afternoon at 2:30 o'clock on the j
Sunken Diamond.
Coach Harry Wolter, confident that |
Furman has enough stuff to turn i
down the Bears this time without j
suffering any weak cantos, will have j
the identical team that started last J
week-end backing him up tomor- I
row. Leo Heagerty will receive for j
Furman; Captain Red Holman will j
play at first; Tam and Linde will '
handle second and third; Farrell, one ;
of the most dependable fielders on j
the team, will continue at short.
Hustling Jimmy Coffis at left
field, Verne Johnson at center, and i
slugging Wally deWitt in right field ;
complete the line-up. Coffis, who !
seems to have earned himself a reg
ular spot in left field with his play j
in the first Bear battle, may again |
prove to be the hitting strength of
the Cards against Bill Priest, Clint ;
Evans' star hurdler. The jump
little guy slapped out two hits in
four attempts Saturday, getting hard
drives all four times.
The game will mean nothing to the j
Cards in the way of a title, since j
they have lost both their last two
games and are definitely out of the
race. California, however, now '
leads the league and its position |
would be placed in jeopardy by a |
loss to Wolter's men.
