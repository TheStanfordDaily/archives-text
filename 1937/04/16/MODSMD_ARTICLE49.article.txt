# Braddock Contract Controversy Aired
## 
### 
NEWARK, N.J., April 15 (UP).â€”
Heavyweight Champion Jimmy
Braddock's hopes to avoid fighting
Max Schmeling so that he can en
gage Joe Louis in Chicago June 22,
hinged today on whether the title
holder's third contract with Madison
Square Garden superceded two ear
lier contracts he signed.
In the opening hearing on the
Garden's suit for an injunction to
restrain Braddock from fighting
Louis until after he fulfills a con
tract to meet Schmeling in New
York June 3, counsel requested ad
ditional time to gather evidence.
