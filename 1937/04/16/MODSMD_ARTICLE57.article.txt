# Bawling Out the Bawl-Out
## 
### 
PROGRESSIVE educators have long admitted
that a major defect of the university is the
grade system. They have found it the one ob
stacle which more than any other prevents col
lege training becoming truly "education."
Yet Stanford University, and only Stanford
University, consistently exaggerates and mag
nifies this undermining influence by openly
publishing the grades of its student body.
Yesterday, with the spring flood of Bawl-outs,
the evil of grades was given its quarterly im
petus. Faster than "Gone with the Wind" on
an Emporium bargain counter, our own "best
seller" sold at the Accounting Office.
All because the Bawl-out has become the
greatest inflator and deflator of egos on the
campus. Either you find how many of your
friends you have beaten, or how many of them
have beaten you. In any case you erroneously
look up to the Bawl-out as the criterion of Stan
ford intelligence.
But misleading as are grades themselves as
a gauge of brains, the Bawl-out is worse. Low
grade-points may mean you were sick and took
incompletes, may mean you are taking contin
uous courses which carry grades over two or
three quatrters without recording them.
Stanford women cry "undemocratic!" at
queen races and popularity contests and yet
they are the first to rely on the Bawl-out, really
less democratic than a published record of the
campus' bank balances. Why put some stu
dents up for public praise, others up for public
shame when neither may be deserving?
If anything feeds the fire of "grades for
grades' sake" it's the Bawl-out. With grades in
the public domain, the competition for marks
becomes alarmingly keener. The Honor Code
is endangered by students who must pass an
ex, or write an "A" paper at any cost—just to
keep up their Bawl-out average.
Professors and instructors will remember the
charges hurled by Daily Editor Abe Mellinkoff
a few years ago— that they often determined a
student's standing by his previous Bawl-out rec
ord. True or not, such a temptation is increased
by the handy Bawl-out.
The Registrar's office defends the publicizing
of grades with the argument that it allows stu
dents to periodically check their academic
standing. But inclusion of grades in the di
rectory is not necessary. The student's com
plete record could just as easily be mailed to
him with his end-quarter record.
There is, then, no excuse for the Bawl-out. If
grades are necessary, keep them in the Regis
trar's office. But make the official directory what
it should be—a directory and not a public
"whipping post."- D. B.
