# Our Chromium-Plated Cup

### 
STANFORD is chromium plating its tin cup —
and, contrary to expressed opinions, the
new glitter should do more to lure the coins that
tinkle to its thirsty bottom than to dull the at
traction.
The other day someone asked how Stanford
could expect any tinkle in its cup at all, if it
continued to chromium plate it with prosperity
Memorial Theater ncaring completion—wings
for Lagunita—Amphitheater—Education Build
ing.
If Stanford can do this, regardless of how it
is financed, won't benevolence shy when the
shiny cup catches its eye?
Probably not. The glamour of the bandwagon
holds some strange appeal—the appeal of glit
ter and noise and action.
As long as the ring of hammers is on the
Quad, scaffolding goes up and comes down
and new red tile appears, Stanford's bandwagon
will call coins to the cup. A guiet, poverty
stricken campus offers but one traction of the
appeal despite its more apparent need.
To draw on a concrete example: A few weeks
ago when Stanford's amphitheater was a shape
less mound of dirt excavated from Palo Alto's
subway, Comptroller Almon Roth was showing
an interested alumnus around the Farm. He
told of the new bowl and of the prospective
planting plans. He pointed proudly to the
mound of dirt and discreetly mentioned short
age of funds.
Two hours later a Mr. Howard Frost made a
$30,000 donation to Stanford University to be

used in planting the new amphitheater.
A few weeks later Mr. Frost returned to the
campus and found the planting of his trees just
beginning. He found an active campus, a glit
tering bandwagon, a shiny cup.
Two hours later he informed Mr. Roth that
he would like to cover the expenses of the
entire project and make it a memorial to his son,
John Lawrence Frost, whose career at Stanford
was cut short by death.
This is a comparatively young university.
Its gifts as yet have failed to make it in any
financial sense a rich one. But the first genera
tion is in the prime of life now, and Stanford has
finally grown old enough to hope for the tinkle
of coins from its youngsters.
It believes their eyes will not be blinded by
a chromium-coated cup.—G. F.
