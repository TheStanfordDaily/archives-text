STANFORD will have a Handbook next au
tumn.. It will be a revised and more inter
esting volume —if one can call a volume a book
that measures about three by six inches.
But to be functionally correct, it can't be any
thing but a compendium of information, inter
esting perhaps, but still a compendium.
Even if Ex Committee had the money to pub
lish a large and attractive brochure on student
life, it might not be that body's job. To be more
exact, it might be the Administration's job.
Of course, when official Stanford hasn't until
recently even considered a brochure represent
ative of its academic achievements, and has had
the courage to seek public donations without
beautifully printed evidence of worthiness, it
may seem silly to ask for a brochure on student
life.
But one is needed, perhaps as much as the
other.
Way back in the reaches of the Ad Building,
some one is probably throwing up his. hands
at the very idea. "Publicize the country-club
aspect? I don't think so!"
Yet if brain-poor Stanford knew one-tenth as
much as a circus advance agent, it would get
out the finest book you ever saw about how
swell student life here is.
It would reason like this: "People say we
have a country club here. By denying this—in
the presence of certain concrete evidence of
truth—we are admitting that people are right.
Let's instead not only admit we have a country
club, but show people that the country club has
a function, and most important, that it's the
damnedest, finest country club they ever saw.
"And let's show them in the damnedest finest
way they ever saw."
It would take money. It would be hopelessly
long-sighted for some of the short-sighted Stan
ford-acolytes who allude to the campus as
mecca plus nirvana, and who bow six times to
the east whenever anybody mentions the word
"Stanford."
But such a brochure, led by brilliant literature
illustrative of academic wealth, might not only
serve to put Stanford before the public eye—
but before the eye of that particular public that
has money to spend, if the buyer can prove he
has the goods.
