PIECE ON PEACi:

I AST night students and faculty met around tallies
to discuss pcace. I didn't hear the discussions, but
I imagine they weren't much different from the usual
run of peace talks, namely that they accomplished
nothing.
Peace is not something you can talk about, it's
something you have to practice, something you have to
live. It's an emotion that mu-it live within yoa before
you can say anything about it, and then when it does,
ou don't feel like talking.
You can sit down and yeil about war and its evils,
its foolishness; you can blaspheme it as mass stupidity;
you can curse it, examine it, and then curse it again,
but you won't get. very far.
9i: •$! Jjt ijt
You won't get very far for the simple reason that
when the next war comes, no matter how many times
you have sworn not to support it and no matter how
many strikes you have helped stage in protest against
war and its evils, you'll be right there in the mud
along side your fellow men, shooting, shouting, scream
ing, and dying just as human beings have done for
the past 1000 years or more.
The government has a law now whereby il can
make you go to war, but that is of little difference.
Propaganda will make a difference, however. It'll gel
yo uand me and all the rest of the people who hate
wa3.

Today's students know nothing of war. True, thny
have been told of war's horrors, have been shown pic
tures of its terrors, have seen examples of living deaths
that once were fine young men, but instead of teach
ing students to hate war, this sort of education lias
done nothing more than make them curious. You
can't scare youth with talk.
Because each one of us has the idea that even if
he did go to war, he might see all this, might even get
shot once or twice, might even die, but he's not very
worried about it because he can't see himself in any
other light than that of a complete and whole man
having fun. But he will.
Jaded nerves and emotions will find all the excite
ment they need.
# * ♦ * 4i
Some dark night when the rain is beating down,
however, and you're lying face up to the elements, with
six inches of jagging bone sticking through the bleed
ing flesh of your leg and your foot is nothing nunc
than a mass of mush inside your shoe, you'll scream
out, crying to God and your mother to put the light
back in your eyes, but no one will hear you.
When you're lying there in the dark squeezing
mud through your fingers and feeling it ooze out, sud
denly everything will get bright and then dark.
And you won't have to worry any more about why
you didn't listen to the guys who went through the
last one.

ing flesh of your leg and your foot is nothing nunc
than a mass of mush inside your shoe, you'll scream
out, crying to God and your mother to put the light
back in your eyes, but no one will hear you.
When you're lying there in the dark squeezing
mud through your fingers and feeling it ooze out, sud

And you won't have to worry any more about why
you didn't listen to the guys who went through the

PIECE ON PEACi:

I AST night students and faculty met around tallies
to discuss pcace. I didn't hear the discussions, but
I imagine they weren't much different from the usual
run of peace talks, namely that they accomplished
nothing.
Peace is not something you can talk about, it's
something you have to practice, something you have to
live. It's an emotion that mu-it live within yoa before
you can say anything about it, and then when it does,
ou don't feel like talking.
You can sit down and yeil about war and its evils,
its foolishness; you can blaspheme it as mass stupidity;
you can curse it, examine it, and then curse it again,
but you won't get. very far.
9i: •$! Jjt ijt
You won't get very far for the simple reason that
when the next war comes, no matter how many times
you have sworn not to support it and no matter how
many strikes you have helped stage in protest against
war and its evils, you'll be right there in the mud
along side your fellow men, shooting, shouting, scream
ing, and dying just as human beings have done for
the past 1000 years or more.
The government has a law now whereby il can
make you go to war, but that is of little difference.
Propaganda will make a difference, however. It'll gel
yo uand me and all the rest of the people who hate
wa3.

Today's students know nothing of war. True, thny
have been told of war's horrors, have been shown pic
tures of its terrors, have seen examples of living deaths
that once were fine young men, but instead of teach
ing students to hate war, this sort of education lias
done nothing more than make them curious. You
can't scare youth with talk.
Because each one of us has the idea that even if
he did go to war, he might see all this, might even get
shot once or twice, might even die, but he's not very
worried about it because he can't see himself in any
other light than that of a complete and whole man
having fun. But he will.
Jaded nerves and emotions will find all the excite
ment they need.

Some dark night when the rain is beating down,
however, and you're lying face up to the elements, with
six inches of jagging bone sticking through the bleed
ing flesh of your leg and your foot is nothing nunc
than a mass of mush inside your shoe, you'll scream
out, crying to God and your mother to put the light
back in your eyes, but no one will hear you.
