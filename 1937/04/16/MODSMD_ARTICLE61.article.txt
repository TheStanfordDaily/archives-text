Dear Bud:
So you think that only lace cuffs
and powdered wigs can be worn at
the Masque Ball! Son — this isn't
Queen Elizabeth's time. 11 you d
stop to think you'd find there's no
end to the variety of costumes that
will be eligible. All types of charac
ters will come to London for the
Coronation. There'll be representa
tives from every nation — Ghandi,
Mussolini, Hitler, and diplomats of
all sorts. There'll be Congo chief
tains from South Africa, Rajahs from
India, "One Lung" from China, be
sides people from every British
colony. In addition, crooks, swind
lers, and prostitutes will congregate
in the Coronation Cily in order to
make money oil suckers. I imagine
it would be very profitable to come
as a pick-pocket. .
Don't you see thai a costume rep
resenting any person from any part
of the world will do? There's plenty
of room for your imagination to
work — but. you haven't displayed
any of that stud so far. 11' you're
cold come as an Eskimo. If you're
hot come as Her Majesty's personal
ice-man. If you're too d n lazy to
think of anything, adorn your tux
shirt with a red ribbon and a few
medals and you're all set.
So long, Buddy, I hope I've
scratched that head of yours and
have made the blood circulate. I'll
see you waltzing with Wally.
