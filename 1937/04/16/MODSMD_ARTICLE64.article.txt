'•QUALITY STREET" (RICO) is
sugar and no spice, and lavander and
lace, and Katherine Hepburn at her
brittlest. If you are in the mood for
a picture which is as fragile as an
antique Chinese tea-cup, well, you
may be in the mood for Quality
Street; but I'm afraid most of Stan
ford will laugh.
It is impeccably done; the mid- |
Victorian atmosphere is absolutely !
unbroken, and it is about as emo
tional and stirring as a coat of paint. j
Even Franchot Tone's habit of pull
ing his chin in as though he were
reaching for low C doesn't jar the '
mirrored surface. Miss Hepburn's
work' is ice-like and thin, as it
should be here.
But lace and lavender and a steady
diet of saccharine docs create sur
feit, even if it is remarkably well :
handled considering. You feel you
should not laugh because everyone

has done just what they started out
to do; but healing people say in all
solemness, "A woman never tells,"
and all this talk about what is "un
ladylike"—well really, it's not fun
ny but—excuse me.
"We Have Our Moments" makes
us glad that someone does. It's Sally
Eilers and Jimmy Dunn and others
speaking and acting something
which usually sounds like an Eng
lish A attempt at light comedy—all
heavy stulT, you know. Seriously,
though, three people behind mo
laughed on two distinct ocasions.
Probably low on thyroid.
