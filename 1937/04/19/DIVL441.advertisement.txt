Don't you know a bookworm?
You know, the kind of person who
honestly enjoys the companionship
of a good book, and who is right
"up to snuff" on the current hap
penings of the literary world? Of
course you do; we all do. Our new
library is the bookworm's paradise,
and if you give him one of this
splendid selection you can be sure
the worm will never turn.
