# Masque Ball Bids Sell Today
## Designer To Give Aid In Costume Ideas

Tickets for the Convalescent
Home Drive Masque Ball, to be
held this coming Friday, go on sale
today at the A.S.S.U. offices in the
Union. The price is $2.50.
In case one can't find a bed sheet,
or wants something more elaborate,
a costumer from San Francisco will
be on the campus tomorrow.
Though the coming English Coro
nation will be one of the most formal
events in the world, Stanford's
Masque Ball, with the Coronation
theme, will not. The Masque Ball
will be very informalâ€”a take-off
on the true Coronation. Only those
going as diplomats need wear a tux
edo. Costumes will probably range
from tails to tapa cloth.
Feature of the ball will be the
choosing of the king and queen
from among the motley array of
dancers. Instead of an "election" to
choose the rulers, as last year, these
pompous personages will be drawn
by lot. Thus an eskimo and a hula
girl may become the royal pair.
Music will be furnished by Er
nie Heckscher's orchestra; skits, by
Walt Wickett and Bud Cady.
