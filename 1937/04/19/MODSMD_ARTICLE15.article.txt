# 'English Lyrics for Opera:' Tibbett

### BARBARA SWEET 
! Lawrence Tibbett's friendliness
land cheerful informality endears him
' to his audiences almost as much as
! his magnificent voice. This was
; shown clearly last Friday night in
j the Pavilion, when he sat at his
1 dressing-room door for over an hour
| and autographed programs for en
l thusiastic music-lovers. For each
â€¢ one he had a pleasant word or a
I smile, as well as a signature.
He was equally accommodating
; when asked by The Daily for an
exclusive interview and talked for
! a long time about the future of
i American music and his own plans
I for the coming year.
"You notice almost my entire
! program was in English," he said.
| "That is because I believe that an
| audience deserves to know what it
, is all about, In Europe, when they
have a much older, more firmly
| grounded culture, the people de
| mand that concert programs as well

| as opera be sung in their native '
j tongue."
"Then you believe that all opera
should be sung in English?" I
asked him.
"I wouldn't go so far as to say
that," he replied. "Some of the older
i operas should not be translated, j
Let's leave "II Trovatorc" where it
lies. But on the whole I think that j
English is an ideal singing language,
j second only to Italian and possibly |
Spanish."
"Do you think that an opera loses
| something of its spirit when trans
lated?"
"Not of its spirit, but its subtle- i
tics," Mr. Tibbett commented. "But
what we gain makes up for what is
lost. Singing in English breaks
down the snobbishness with which
Americans treat music. Many of
them think il is only for the initiated
few. It should be for everyone, as
it is in Europe."
Mr. Tibbett leaves soon for Lon
-1 1

of the native American operas that
have been produced and feels that
American opera has a great future.
"American opera is very promis
ing," he stated, "especially since we
are new to the form. For example,
Deems Taylor has done two excel
lent operas and is working on a
third. George Gerslfwin, too, is
outstanding for the life and color of
his opera, 'Porgy and Bess'."
Mr. Tibbett leavess oon for Lon
don, where he will begin his first.
European concert tour. He will be
abroad a year, returning only for
the Metropolitan Opera season, after
which he intends to make a tour of
Australia and New Zealand.
He will make no motion pictures
during this period, but California
audiences will have the opportunity
of hearing him again when he re
turns for the 1933 San Francisco
Opera season.
"That, is," he added, "if you want
to hear me,"
