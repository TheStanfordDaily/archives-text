### 
Campus practical jokers noticed
that H. C. Mitchell, Jr., from Cord
es, Arizona, and Beta Theta Pi
Dick Bullis from Los Angeles both
had similar looking Ford sedans,
decided to switch them Thursday
night.
Overlooked by the practical jok
ers was the fact that Mitchell's car
had a radio and spotlight, and that
Bullis' didn't. Mitchell realized that
his radio and spotlight were missing
early Friday afternoon and told
Campus Cop Burns about it. Al
though license plates had been
changed on both cars, Burns wired
the motor number of the car which
Mitchell had to Arizona and found
Mitchell had Bullis' car.
Bullis got Mitchell out of bed at
3 o'clock Friday morning to settle
the matter, after Burns had got him
up. Outcome of their early morning
conference wsa that Mitchell was
given back his own car, and Dick
Bullis' car was temporarily placed in
the Corporation Yard by Deputy
Sheriff Burns.
Mitchell went back to bed to catch
up on his interrupted sleep, but
Bullis, in a practical joking mood
himself now, removed his car from
the Corporation Yard, substituting
Mitchell's for it.
Nextd ay, when they discovered
that the whole thing was a practical
joke, the police took Bullis' car back
to him. Everyone but Dick Bullis
himself was surprised to find the car
now had a spotlight and a radio.

Australian business men prefer
brunettes or redheads during office
hours, but blondes outside office
hours.
