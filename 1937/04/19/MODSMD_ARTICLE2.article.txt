# Officers Clear Farm Suspect
## Stone Hit-Run Driver Theory Is Doubtful 
### 
Investigation of the death of Joe
Stone, 32-year-old Sequoia Hall
cook, by a hit-run driver, led to the
campus last week when State offi
cers checked up on two 1929 model
Durant cars owner by a Sigma Chi
and by Clarence Snyder, watchman
of the Hoover home. Both owners
were exonerated.
Their cars were suspected because
a 1929 Durant without lights was
seen to turn back toward San Fran
cisco on El Camino Real late the
night of the accident not far from
the place where the body found.
Seven Durants have been checked
so far by the police.
According to G. A. Burns, cam
pus deputy sheriff, the hit-run the
ory of the death is false. Stone's
body showed injuries only on the
left side, and there were no bruises
below the thigh. Burns says that
such bruises would be necessary if
Stone had been struck by an auto
mobile. Supporting the idea that he
was struck by a car, however, is the
fact that his right hand was skinned
as if he had slid along the ground.
Students in a highway resort near
Mayfield said that they had seen
Stone there the night he was killed
with a wad of money. The bar
tender denies this and says that
Stone borrowed a silver dollar from
him and asked for a ride to San
Francisco.
When the body was found on El
Camino Real, 350 feet south of the
Embarcadero, Stone didn't have a
silver dollar, but he had a paper
dollar in his pocket. Problem for
the police is to discover why he
borrowed a silver dollar if he al
ready had a dollar, and if not how
he got the paper dollar.
