I'm all for peace, but I don't see !
(how we're going to get it by hold- |

I down and waving our arms and
j shouting in unison: "Peace, rah— !
j rah—rah, rahrahrah, Peace."
Congressional Acts
I know it's fun, but what does it
' mean, after all? While we are get- j
i ting excited over Peace, our sover- j
eign representatives in Congress are j
drafting sleazy neutrality bills that |
couldn't keep us out of a Sequoia I
rat-race, let alone a general Euro- j
i pean war.
i When the general European war
comes and we find it increasingly
! impossible to distinguish between
j implements of war and implements i
I of peace (dentists' drills, etc.), when ,
jwe can't quite decide if cotton, ,
j copper, and wheat are munitions or j
j not, when the international bank-
I ers and buncoers start laying their '
| bets on the wniner in the form of
| international loans, we'll find Amer- ;
j ica going into war for the same pur- !
| poses she did in 1917: to cover her
j bets on the winner in the form of,
! rest. And the lousy speeches you
i and I listen to won't help us any 1
j then.
Appeal to Emotions
Because the speeches we listen to |
j now are appeals to the emotions, i
Peace, It's Wonderful, makes a

just like Mothers' Day, and Fathers'
Day. and the Postal Telegraph. But
j when war comes, war will be a
' beautiful sentiment, and we will hold
