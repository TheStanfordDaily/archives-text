### JACKIE BROWN 
It is all very well to settle back
i in the chair and say: "My opinion,
I supported by extensive reading in
â€¢ sociology and psychology, would in
| dicate that peace strikes and as
jsemblies are futile, that wc are
helpless pawns in the grip of social
forces, and besides, you guys are a
bunch of maladjusted red-hots."
However valid and scientific the
armchair approach to life is, the
simple, scientific, sociological fact of
life is that it is becoming more and
more outmoded. A glance about us
will indicate that Stanford may be
'slow catching" on, but it is partici
pating, even if in the rear guard of
a significant change in the under
j graduate attitude all over the na
; tion.
More and more, the overstuffed
I cynicism is being labelled as the
I spirit of the 1920's and is being
I wiped away by the post-depression
| course of action, unrelenting ac
tion, wherever and whenever pos
|sible.
Have To Wait
I When the sedentary cynic says it
lis an unreasoned, insensate action,
we only can reply that we will have
!to wait and let the results answer
I for us.
We know that action by minority
(groups in the past has expropriated
| our common store of natural wealth,
has made a mockery of democracy
!in our legislative halls and courts,
has secured franchises and tariffs
jand special privileges that have
sabotaged production and robbed
! and plundered every consumer in the
country.
Time for Action
I It is time for action by the major
ity group. We are the youths of the
1930'5. We have a vested interest in
Peace, for we have inherited the
I next war. It has been willed to us,
| its heirs and assigns, lock, stock, and
j barrel. We do not intend to die for
I dear old U.S. Steel, or Anaconda
j Copper, long may she wave.
