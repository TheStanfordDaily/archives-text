# Precious' Will Wear Valuable Chinese Robe
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Lady Precious Stream, in fact, is
worth thousandsâ€”at least she is in
her final scene. Phyllis Lakin, the
lead and the Lady of the forthcom
ing Stanford production, will wear
an authentic Chinese costume 300
years old valued at thousands of
dollars in her closing act.
According to Waldemar Johan
ssen, set director, the costume was
spun in the Orient 300 years ago,
but the whole of its glamorous past
is veiled in obscurity. At one time it
probably graced some high-born
Chinese maiden, but Miss Lakin
will appear in it to be crowned
"Queen of the Western Region" by
Jim Corner, her husband in the
play, when he returns to her after
having been on the "loose for some
18 years."
The gown, of crimson and green
Chinese silk, is richly embroidered
in gold and many colored silk. It
has been treasured for years in the
vaults of Louis Goldstein, San Fran
cisco costumer. Mi*. Goldstein at
first turned down the proposition of
loaning the fragile relic for Stanford
use, but Mr. Johanssen won him
over Saturday, and the costume
will first appear at the opening per
formnace of the Chinese play, April
30.

Tho President of the United
States cannot be a naturalized citi
zen. The Constitution states he
must be "native-born."
