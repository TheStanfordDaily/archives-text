# Indian Baseballers Wallop Bears, 8-3
## Fifth Inning Rally Brings Surprise Win 
### MATTHEW VAN WINKLE 
Making a sensational rally in the fifth inning, in which they rung up
six tallies, the Stanford baseball team, with steady Spike Furman on
the mound for the entire game, came through with an 8-3 win over the
University of California Saturday afternoon in the Sunken Diamond.

The Golden Bears made two runs
in the second and until the last of
the fifth nothing very exciting hap
pened. Then things broke. There
were two outs chalked up against
the Indians. Linde was on third base
and George Farrell was at bat.
Priest, Cal's famed pitcher, put one
over that suited Fajrrell just fine.
Garrel lrcacked out a single, bring
ing in Linde and establishing him
self on first.
Fifth Inning Rally
Priest then walked two men, fill
ing the bases. Coffis came to bat.
Priest walked him, forcing in Far
rell. Then the Cal pitcher really
blew up, pitched a wild one that
Bear Catcher Lombardi couldn't
handle. This brought in Verne
Johnson. Next at bat was Leo
Heagerty, Card catcher. Heagerty
boomed out a three-bagger, bring
ing in three more runs. After Fur
man and Linde were sent to base
on balls, Heagerty was knocked into
home for the last Indian score until
the seventh.
In the first of the seventh, Koral,
Bear second baseman, came in for
the last score of the game for Clint
Evans' team. In the last half of the
same inning, Heagerty and Linde
came in on hits by Tam and DeWitt,
respectively.
Three Pitchers Downed
The Indians succeeded in knock
ing three pitchers out of the box,
and if Evans had had any more
available, would have doubtless sent
another to the tnound. Priest, Cal's
best hurling bet, did a fine job un
til he blew up in that memorable
fifth inning. David, sent in to re
place Priest in the sixth, didn't last |
very long and was succeeded by
Laeremans. Laeremans was doing!
fine, but Clint didn't seem to think j
so, and soon replaced him with ,
Rinne. Rinne didn't have much of a j
chance to show what he could do
but while he was in he had no runs, j
hits, or bases on balls chalked up
against him.
Spike Furman, Card hurler, put
in a beautiful performance. He j
pitched the whole game, and though '
he walked eight men, he had only |
three runs and four hits marked !
clow nagainst him.
