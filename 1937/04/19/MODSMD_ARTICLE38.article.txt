# Farm Mermen Capture Title In Upset Win
## Indian Swimmers Cop Pacific Coast Crown By Beating Cal, Troy 
### 
Upsetting the wise money, Stan
ford's varsity swimming team won
the Pacific Coast Conference Cham
pionship in Los Angeles by annex
ing 52 points to Cal's 45, U.S.C.'s 42,
| and U.C.L.A.'s 29 in a meet which
I was decided in the last two events.
Winning only two first places,
Stanford was the only team to place
i in every event, with two men scor-
I ing in each race except the 100-yard
j dash. Roy Winkleman won the div
ing title as Stanford's only individ
ual first place scorer, while the relay
team of McKenzie, Moeller, Scatena,
and Clarke took the 440-yard relay.
Hero of the meet was Spencer
I Moeller, sophomore sprinter, swim-
J ming his first and last meet of the
| year for Coach Nort Thornton.
| Moeller placed second in the 50-yard
dash over Indian Clarke and, swim
! ming second man in the 440-yard
relay, gave Stanford a ten-yard lead
which was largely responsible for
their winning both the relay and
the meet.
Two events before the end of the
contest, the Indians were trailing
: both S.C. and Cal. But by winning
!19 points in a last-minute effort,
| they beat Cal by seven points and
! forced U.S.C. into third place three
1 points behind the Bears.
