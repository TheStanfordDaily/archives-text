# Tibbett Awes Audience, But Lacks Brilliance
## 
### JIM STONE 
When a great artist performs so
that he does not quite hit the peak
of his capabilities, but certainly does
not go far below them, it is difficult
to know what to say. Lawrence Tib
bett's concert last Friday night
leaves us in this vague state.
It is a minor matter at best; the
evening was thoroughly enjoyable,
but for some reason we expected
more of something—brilliance per
haps. But this is mere academic
bickering; the main point is that
Mr. Tibbett sang for Stanford so
that Stanford roared back.
Hindered by Cold
Hampered somewhat by a bother
some cold, he seemed to have lost a
little of the sureness which is such
an integral part of his singing. His
high notes were a little strained at
times; he seemed to be holding him
self in; but a cold is a cold. Other
wise he sang with the deft control
of tone and volume which makes
him outstanding; his middle and
lower registers were full and ring
ing; there is no use going on—he is
a great singfer and cannot fail to
show it.
Beginning a program which was
with one exception sung in English
(and so that you could understand
every word), Mr. Tibbett sang, "Oh
Whither Art Roaming" from "II
Pome d'Ora" (Cesti), and "I Am a
Roamer Bold" (Mendelssohn). We
were ready to listen to more.
Accompanist Entertains
In his second group, the slight
straining on high notes was more
noticeable than at any other time.
Here he sang "By the Sea" (Schu
bert), "While Tramping" (Wolff),
"In the Silent Night" (Rachman
inoff) — which was sung the way
Rachmaninoff must have meant it—
and "Death, the Commander" (Mou
sorgsky). As an encore, he sang
Handel's lovely, "Where Ere You
Walk"; ladies swooned; men ad
mired; beautiful.

| As an interpolary group, Edward J
i Harris, accompanist to Mr. Tibbett,
j played three Debussy selections,
i "Minstrels," "The Girl with the
j Flaxen Hair," and the "Prelude in A
J Minor." As an encorse he played his
J own "Gallant Music Box." He plays I
j like his box—with an amazing lack j
| of tonal variety.
Sings in English
j To conclude the first half of the '
i program, Mr. Tibbett sang the only I
| number not in English, Gerard's !
Monologue, "Nemico della Patria" !
| from "Andrea Chenier" (Giordono). i
j Except for the fact that he chose as
I an encore to sing the Prologue from I
| "I Pagliacci," this would have been
1 perhaps the best handled number
I all-round of the first half. But the !
I Prologue was really sung nearer toj
1 the way it should be than has been !
j done since it was found as a show- j
| piece for all budding singers.
The second half of the program j
j was, technically speaking, something j
jof a comeback, with a temporary |
! victory over the cold. Starting with !
J "Ah Love but a Day" (Beach), j
j through "The Bagpipe Man" and !
j "In the Summertime on Bredon" j
I (Peel), to the popular "De Halle- \
I lujah Rhythm," he made you say, !
j "Now you're talking."
Sings 'Glory Road'
After that group he could do noth- j
ing but return to sing "Shortenin' ■
Bread," Hutchinson's parody on |
' Handel, "Old Mother Hubbard," '
J and Deems Taylor's "Song for Lov- :
J ers." He is in his element, if he has i
! a particular one, when singing the j
j negro songs; he communicates to us '
| his own enjoyment of them.
And the program was ended with ]
| "The Water Mill" by Williams,
I "Come Buy" from "Winter's Tale"
' (Buzzi-Peccia), and his two encore
I requests: "The Glory Road," which ,
jis so eminently his own that no
j comment is proper, and "The Road
to Mandalay."
