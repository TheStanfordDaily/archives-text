## TWO-RING TRACK, WE LIKE IT 
### 
City sports commentators have
been pounding out many a column
| inch lately on the matter of com
bining varsity and frosh track meets.
To the cinder men, frosh at least, to
the fan, and to the pundits it sounds
like a great idea. It's about time the
hidden frosh was pulled out of his
hermitage and eiven a look at. They
have been running too long for the
amusement of relatives and track
managers.
The present complaint seems to
have been started because the custo
mer wanted more than the usual
hour and three-quarters of his Sat
urday afternoon taken up. Person
ally, we're looking for comparisons,
for a doubly effective climax, and for
the only kind of a track program that
is logically complete.
Right now you can compare times
and distances until the moon turns
green and you'll know less than
when you started. What's needed is a
frosh event run within five minutes
of the varsity event under the same
conditions and on the same track.
The idea is to stall the big meet
and the little big meet in the same
stadium on the same afternoon. Al
ternate between the varsity and
frosh events and you will have a
super meet that can easily start
around 2 o'clock and finish before
5.
Frosh track men could start the
qualifying heats an hour early and
by 2 o'clock would be taking their
final trials. The frosh two-mile
could start at 1:45 and finish five
minutes before time for the varsity
mile.
The other events such as hurdles
and dashes could be run right after
the similar varsity events and would
add plenty of action and little time
to the program. Frosh field events
could begin qualifications before the
meet starts so they would have the
slow events out of the way and
would be on their last throws in the
shot, discus, and javelin when the
majority of the crowd arrived.
We can think of no better way to
draw more people than by giving
more for their money. It would give
the frosh the attention which is due
them and would arouse an interest
in speculations on ability that would
keep track alive the remainder of
the year.
