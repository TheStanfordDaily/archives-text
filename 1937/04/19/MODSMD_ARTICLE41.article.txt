# RULE BUT NOT SPORTSMANSHIP

### 
An incident occurred in the tennis
matches against C?.l Saturday that,
though it was perfectly legal, cer
tainly showed poor taste on the part
of the Stanford coach. It was re
garding whether foot-fault penalties
should be called or not. The row
started during the last singles match
of the day, the one between Lynch
of Stanford and Newton of Cal.
Prior to this time, no mention of
foot-faulting had been made, then of
a sudden, with the score standing

four games to three in the third set,
the Stanford coach thought that
something ought to be done about
Newton's faulting. Naturally, the
Cal coach objected, wondering why
Stanford had to pick such a pecu
liar time to bring the matter up.
The main result of the silly bick
ering was that it made both players
a little self-conscious, and practical
ly ruined their games.
It seems to us that there was no
call to make such a scene; Stanford
men were foot-faulting just as much
as Cal men were, and it was to
neither team's advantage or disad
vantage to have a foot-fault judge.
According to tennis association
rulings a player commits a foot
fault if he steps over the base line
before he hits the ball, or if he has
both feet off the ground when he
hits the ball.
However, out in the West the rul
ing has very seldom been enforced,
although any player, coach, or judge,

may demand a foot-fault judge if
he wishes.
Now, we think that if an intercol
legiate tournament the rule is to
be observed, there should be an un
derstanding on the matter before
the tourney starts, and not during
the middle of the last set of the last
singles match. To bring the matter
up at such a point seems to us to be
utterly ridiculous. It makes for ill—
| feeling not only among the players,
but between the coaches, and even
; among the spectators.
The Stanford coach was perfectly
within his rights in asking that there
be a foot-fault judge, but he cer
; tainly used poor taste in bringing the
matter up when he did. It would
have been much better' to Suggest to
1 players that they abide by the rul
ing, and we think that the sugges
tion would have had much more
1 effect than did the method that the
1 coach used.

Stanford had to pick such a pecu
liar time to bring the matter up.
The main result of the silly bick
ering was that it made both players
a little self-conscious, and practical
ly ruined their games.
It seems to us that there was no
call to make such a scene; Stanford
men were foot-faulting just as much
as Cal men were, and it was to
neither team's advantage or disad
vantage to have a foot-fault judge.
According to tennis association
rulings a player commits a foot
fault if he steps over the base line
before he hits the ball, or if he has
both feet off the ground when he
hits the ball.
However, out in the West the rul
ing has very seldom been enforced,
although any player, coach, or judge,

may demand a foot-fault judge if
he wishes.
Now, we think that if an intercol
legiate tournament the rule is to
be observed, there should be an un
derstanding on the matter before
the tourney starts, and not during
the middle of the last set of the last
singles match. To bring the matter
up at such a point seems to us to be
utterly ridiculous. It makes for ill—
| feeling not only among the players,
but between the coaches, and even
; among the spectators.
The Stanford coach was perfectly
within his rights in asking that there
be a foot-fault judge, but he cer
; tainly used poor taste in bringing the
matter up when he did. It would
have been much better' to Suggest to
1 players that they abide by the rul
ing, and we think that the sugges
tion would have had much more
1 effect than did the method that the
1 coach used.
—Glikbarg and VanWinkle
An incident occurred in the tennis
matches against C?.l Saturday that,
though it was perfectly legal, cer
tainly showed poor taste on the part
of the Stanford coach. It was re
garding whether foot-fault penalties
should be called or not. The row
started during the last singles match
of the day, the one between Lynch
of Stanford and Newton of Cal.
Prior to this time, no mention of
foot-faulting had been made, then of
a sudden, with the score standing

four games to three in the third set,
the Stanford coach thought that
something ought to be done about
Newton's faulting. Naturally, the
Cal coach objected, wondering why
Stanford had to pick such a pecu
liar time to bring the matter up.
The main result of the silly bick
ering was that it made both players
a little self-conscious, and practical
ly ruined their games.
