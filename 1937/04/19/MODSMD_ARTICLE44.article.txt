# My Feet Itch, Eis
## 
### 
WALKING in this edit column makes my
feet itch. I don't know exactly why. May
be it's athlete's loot. Or maybe it is the number
of worthwhile, clever, sometimes even original
thoughts that have sprinted along here ahead
of me.
I don't think they are what bothers me,
though. It isn't the daring, leaping foot-prints
that make me feel uneasy and out of place.
It's the mechanized, carefully precise steps
that give me the jitters. They are more recent
than other, dynamic steps, that leapt along
with such sparkling unorthodoxy.
So, instead of scratching my feet like Can
dide, I'm going to pick at the environment a
little.
Although it is hard to criticize without ap
pearing presumptuous, the job is very clearly
cut out for a freshman. It takes the traditional
frosh point of view, one of irreverence and
vacillating loyalty, to thumb its nose at some
thing it likes so well. So, backed by the ex
pectancy that the frosh edition will be an ir
reverent edition, I can disloyally expose The
Daily's present dull, conscientiously written
edit page.
Not that I am positive myself what is the
matter with this volume's edit column. But
certain facts are self-evident: the edits aren't
read, and they are nearly all alike. Starting with
a carefully studied simile, they continue with
six inches of self-consciously Time-style guff.
Not bad guff; but always six inches.
It isn't altogether the fault of those initials,
D.B. and G.F., that have been writing most of
the edits. A natural cleverness and spontaneous
humor would help, but these are not necessarily
correlative with a commonsense attitude toward
Campus problems. What is really lacking is
evidence of a unified, deeply felt concern over
fundamental problems that face the University.
Individual sore spots ought to be viewed as
evidences of the basic difficulties. This would
be similar to the liberal's use of the phrase, "a
sick social system," with which he connects
all specific problems. A long-range point of
view would do much toward making the Cam
pus conscious of a certain sincerity and depth
of thought. Edits would no longer look as if
they were mere space-fillers. As things are
now, it is altogether too evident what a bustle
there is every day at the Shack when the editors
are looking for edit subjects.
This situation will have to change before The
Daily's edit page becomes worth reading again.
One evidence of such a change will be the end
of the Clipped Edit Era. Only rarely does any
one want to read editorials from other papers,
but they do make such admirable padding
when we can't think of enough things to gripe
about.

sick social system," with which he connects
all specific problems. A long-range point of
view would do much toward making the Cam
pus conscious of a certain sincerity and depth
of thought. Edits would no longer look as if
they were mere space-fillers. As things are
now, it is altogether too evident what a bustle
there is every day at the Shack when the editors
are looking for edit subjects.
This situation will have to change before The
Daily's edit page becomes worth reading again.
One evidence of such a change will be the end
of the Clipped Edit Era. Only rarely does any
one want to read editorials from other papers,
but they do make such admirable padding
when we can't think of enough things to gripe
about.
WALKING in this edit column makes my
feet itch. I don't know exactly why. May
be it's athlete's loot. Or maybe it is the number
of worthwhile, clever, sometimes even original
thoughts that have sprinted along here ahead
of me.
I don't think they are what bothers me,
though. It isn't the daring, leaping foot-prints
that make me feel uneasy and out of place.
It's the mechanized, carefully precise steps
that give me the jitters. They are more recent
than other, dynamic steps, that leapt along
with such sparkling unorthodoxy.
So, instead of scratching my feet like Can
dide, I'm going to pick at the environment a
little.
Although it is hard to criticize without ap
pearing presumptuous, the job is very clearly
cut out for a freshman. It takes the traditional
frosh point of view, one of irreverence and
vacillating loyalty, to thumb its nose at some
thing it likes so well. So, backed by the ex
pectancy that the frosh edition will be an ir
reverent edition, I can disloyally expose The
Daily's present dull, conscientiously written
edit page.
Not that I am positive myself what is the
matter with this volume's edit column. But
certain facts are self-evident: the edits aren't
read, and they are nearly all alike. Starting with
a carefully studied simile, they continue with
six inches of self-consciously Time-style guff.
Not bad guff; but always six inches.
It isn't altogether the fault of those initials,
D.B. and G.F., that have been writing most of
the edits. A natural cleverness and spontaneous
humor would help, but these are not necessarily
correlative with a commonsense attitude toward
Campus problems. What is really lacking is
evidence of a unified, deeply felt concern over
fundamental problems that face the University.
Individual sore spots ought to be viewed as
evidences of the basic difficulties. This would
be similar to the liberal's use of the phrase, "a
sick social system," with which he connects
all specific problems. A long-range point of
view would do much toward making the Cam
pus conscious of a certain sincerity and depth
of thought. Edits would no longer look as if
