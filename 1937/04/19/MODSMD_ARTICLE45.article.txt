# An Expose of Senator Stanford
## 
### 
A title like this one has a dual purpose. It
makes Campus radicals take a qujck
breath. And gentlemen of the administration
involuntarily twist their necks slightly within
their stiffly starched collars.
But, while there is no point in raking up the
past and recounting incidents exposed by
writers who might possibly have been preju
diced, there is a very definite need for a little
skepticism about Stanford University's progress
in educating us.
Lots of alumni are Rotarians, for example.
I don't have anything against Rotarians in par
ticular, but just think how it would be if every
one were a Rotarian. We would have a lot of
fun, but it would place James Hilton's Shangri-
La farther away than Tibet.
I know a Swiss boy, who hasn't been in the
United States very long. He doesn't think so
much of Stanford.
His criticism, in a word, is that at Stanford
they make you work, while in Switzerland they
leave that choice to you.
Maybe the difficulty lies in the attitude to
ward a university. In the United States, it is
something that comes after high school, while
in Switzerland it is just sitting there, available.
And when most students get to Stanford, they

fall into some extra-curricular group, into which
they throw a lot of drive and ambition, leaving
courses just a minimum of attention. This en
thusiasm arises very likely from the fact that
these extra activities are not regimented, but
are merely "available." So maybe the cur
riculum would be a little more inspiring if it
were put on the "available" basis. People
aren't enthusiastic when they are driven.
Not that the problem can be settled as easily
as this, because if Stanford didn't nag, students
would flunk out, and the school would go broke.
There lies a dilemma.
