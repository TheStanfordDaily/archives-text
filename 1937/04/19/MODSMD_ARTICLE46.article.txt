ENSHRINED, we trust, in the hearts of her students
is the motto of Stanford University, "Let the winds
of freedom blow." Presumably this refers to intellec
tual freedom, since any politician (Dem.) will tell you
that in this mighty nation political liberty has devel
oped to its fullest flower, and needs no further encour
agement. The latest weather report, however, indi
cates that the only winds which ruffle the rough are
those which sweep in off the bay and blow trash on
the Ad Building lawn. Mentally there is dead calm. It
appears that the charges of this intellectual wet-nurse
pride themselves too much on being "sound thinkers"
to jeopardize their reputation by questioning the old,
established order.
Behind this placid acceptance of all that is estab
lished is the burning desire of the Stanford undergrad
uate to be considered a sound thinker. He is afraid of
being ridiculed as "half-baked" that he echoes the
voice of entrenched opinion rather than expose himself
to its censure. It is his boast that contented cows graze
1 in the meadows about the Farm and ax-e never smuggled
into classrooms as they were in our fathers' day. It
is his pride that he has never rioted, never made a
scene, never acted like a "fool radical." He prides
himself on being a conservative, forgetting that a con
servative in that sense is one who "will not look at the
new moon, out of respect for that 'ancient institution,'
the old one."

ILLUSTRATION of how the Stanford Farmer, indi
vidually and collectively, plays the bass to so
ciety's chopsticks, is found in his every reaction. Pub
lic mention of any one of the prongs of the devil's
pitchfork, wine, women, and song, raises a howl that
would shame a hungry wolf pack. Biology shows that
women have always been with us; old man Noah got
tight on wine at the time of the flood, and song is in
herent in man's nature. But mention them as prob
lems at Stanford, and the student body rises in wrath
to smite the ungodly one who dares make such insin
uations. He who suggests that our men are not un
acquainted with alcohol might think from the reaction
that he had accused them of bombing the Convalescent
Home. And the poor devil who publicly brings up the
question of extra-curricular activities in a rumble
seat is treated as a press agent for Sodom and Go
morrah. That Stanford is not quite as pious as these
poses would indicate is shown by lurid private con
versation and by the booming market for aspirin and
bromo-seltzer. This does not mean, of course, that all,
or even most, undergraduate drink. It does mean that
the question of drinking cannot logically be ignored.
This smug denial of the existence of all problems
for which there is no approved reaction pattern is car
ried over into the rough's attitude toward national
issues. It never seems to occur to him that the estab
lished world he knows may be breaking down under
the impact of new forces, that he may have to find his
first job in a CCC camp or get work only as a member
of a C.1.0. organization bossed by an American Stalin
or Hitler. In the face of a new situation he encysts
like a protozoon and complacently ignores it.

TF, as the attitude of our intellectual student might
lead us to believe, all were "for the best, in this
best of all possible worlds," we need not pity him for
reciting his little piece in approved fashion, winding
up with, "What a good boy am I." It is whispered,
however, that the world at present is not a reasonably
exact facsimile of Utopia; and the fact that the whole
economic and social structure is altering while we
watch it indicates that the x'ough's cute tricks may al
ready be outmoded.
Youth is the period of life when a man tries on new
ideas to see if they fit him. Liberalism is its heritage.
The privilege of choosing one's own philosophy is rather
a large birthright to trade for a mess of back-patting.
How sound a thinker is the man who comes to col-»
lege to learn with a hermetically sealed mind? What
is the velocity of the winds of intellectual freedom on
a campus that in the face of a changing world prides
itself on "conservatism"?
