/"kNE Encina pledge who pledged one of the houses
on the Row decided to be a non-conformist last
'Wednesday night and ate dinner at Encina. He tore the
little green ticket out of his little green book, went
in, and sat down opposite a friend who hadn't gone
Row. This young gentleman was audibly surprised to
see the proselyte Greek there.
"Well," he explained, "I just wanted to sec what the
fellows were like who couldn't make a house."
/ \NE Sophomore Greek was up at Tanforan the other
day, trying to bolster his bank account. Since
his success was indifferent, he left early and went out
to the Camino for a ride back. Whether seized with a
fit of economy, or feeling that the Greyhound Com
pany would scarcely care to advance him credit, our
hero tried for a ride by the "rule of thumb."
The first driver to stop was a G-man, slightly
swacked, and hell-bent on reaching L.A. in six hours.
He was going to call on two gentlemen down there
who liked to make money the way the government
docs. Not only that, but they were using it the way
Landon, Hearst (pre-election), our own defender of
the rights of man, and other G.O.P.'s said Roosevelt
does.

sirens closer, ere much longer: "Pull over to the .side
buddy who do you think you arc, the government?"
"Yes," waving a badge, "now get the hell out of
here you goddam fiatfeet!"
A few minutes later, the Row-man, Card, Farm
ster, Greek, Indian, Stanfordite, Embryo Horse-Race-
Fly was relieved to watch the government slow down
enough to let him drop off at Palm Drive. He did not
thumb the rest of his way onto the campus.
