PERSONAL PROPERTY (MGM)
doesn't have about half enough of
all the ingredients to make it bet
ter than the usual run-of-the-mill
attempt at light comedy. There is
n't enough of the inspired madness
which has made really good pictures
of this type, nor enough of the par
ticular type of bovine romance
which supposedly makes Robert
Taylor the idol of the screen (he
has nothing else, certainly), nor
enough of the slinky Miss Harlow to
differentiate her from other er—at
tractive if slightly over-ripe blondes.
I guess it could be worse; but then
it certainly could be better.
The best moments are when Jean
forgets she's supposed to be acting
light comcdy and does a couple of
imitations which are pretty good.
And there is a delightful gentleman
who should be a bar-tender but in
stead is a minion of Scotland Yard—
anyhow, there are bars connected
some way. But this is more space
than the picture's worth
MURDER GOES TO COLLEGE
(Paramount) doesn't make any pre
tenses of being anything but the
corny type, and does pretty well.
It's fairly good low-comedy at
times and never particularly wears
on you because it isn't trying to do
much. Roscoe Karn and Lynn
Overman wabble around and pro
vide entertainment at their worst,
and more at their best.
A new Pluto, evidently out for
the Easter trade, is oh-so-sweet, and
by the way, one is stuck with the
resemblance between him and Hol
lywood's leading heart-throb who
proceeds him on the program. The
latter comes out second best.
