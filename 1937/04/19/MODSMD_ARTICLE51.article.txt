# Troubles Hound Debaters
## Southern Tour Near End 
### 
Bedbugs, busy ambassadors and j
dictators, passport trouble, and meet
ing the wrong train are a few of
the experiences related to Professor
Lee Chapin in letters from Stan- j
lord's touring debaters, Jim Rey
nolds, A.S.S.U. president; Jim Hill, |
Phi Beta Kappa and ex-debate man
ager; and Talbot Shelton.
Their trouble starting even before i
they left the United States, the de
baters "had a terrific time getting!
over the border" because the Mexi- !
can consul had given them incorrect
passports. If they had gone empty- I

handed to the border, they might. ;
have gone right through with only
several formalities, according to Jim j
Reynolds.
Train Trouble
At Tepic, Talbot and Reynolds 1
went up to see a cathedral on a hill !
some distance from the railroad. The i
train, which was supposed to give a !
warning blast, suddenly pulled out.
Setting out in pursuit, the two |
couldn't make it over the fields and I
walls. Finally Jim jumped in front '

of the car of a Mexican, who, star
tled, got the drift of their gesticu
lating and peso, and caught the train
a short distance down the track
where it had stopped.
At Guadalajara, the two Jims and
Talbot interviewed George Winters,
American consul. "We learned more
from him in two hours than we had
in two weeks of study," they said.
Meet Ambassador
At Mexico City the trio conferred
with Ambassador Daniels. For the
third meeting he invited them to
tea, a rare privilege and honor. Al
though they could not meet Trotsky
unless they stayed over, they had
two meetings with Diego Rivera,
internationally known naturalist.
According to Jim Hill, he had be
come indoctrinated with Trotsky's
ideas.
Shelton Leaves Party
At Mexico City Talbot Shelton left
the debaters to return to Houstdn,
Texas. Here the remaining Cardi
nals left for Guatemala, after meet
ing the wrong train and finding that
no other train on the line on which
they had purchased their tickets left
for several days. So they purchased
new tickets, and left, somewhat in a
funk, as Jim Hill described it.
The tempo seems to have been
rather unruffled so far, but the next
letter from Jim Reynolds begins to

complain of extremely noisome bed
bugs. Hill's arm was bitten full of
holes by mosquitos, and a spider had ;
bitten him on the neck. The doctor
in the town was out on a call caring
for a horse.
In Guatemala, they were inspected j
time after time by soldiers. So ac- i
customed were they to pulling out
their passports for inspection, that
Hill mechanically drew forth his for
a uniformed hotel solicitor.
Here they also had a three-hour
talk with George Well, American
consul in Guatemala.

can consul had given them incorrect
passports. If they had gone empty- I

handed to the border, they might. ;
have gone right through with only
several formalities, according to Jim j
Reynolds.
Train Trouble
At Tepic, Talbot and Reynolds 1
went up to see a cathedral on a hill !
some distance from the railroad. The i
train, which was supposed to give a !
warning blast, suddenly pulled out.
Setting out in pursuit, the two |
couldn't make it over the fields and I
walls. Finally Jim jumped in front '

of the car of a Mexican, who, star
tled, got the drift of their gesticu
lating and peso, and caught the train
a short distance down the track
where it had stopped.
At Guadalajara, the two Jims and
Talbot interviewed George Winters,
American consul. "We learned more
from him in two hours than we had
in two weeks of study," they said.
Meet Ambassador
At Mexico City the trio conferred
with Ambassador Daniels. For the
third meeting he invited them to
tea, a rare privilege and honor. Al
though they could not meet Trotsky
unless they stayed over, they had
two meetings with Diego Rivera,
internationally known naturalist.
According to Jim Hill, he had be
come indoctrinated with Trotsky's
ideas.
Shelton Leaves Party
At Mexico City Talbot Shelton left
the debaters to return to Houstdn,
Texas. Here the remaining Cardi
nals left for Guatemala, after meet
ing the wrong train and finding that
no other train on the line on which
they had purchased their tickets left
for several days. So they purchased
new tickets, and left, somewhat in a
funk, as Jim Hill described it.
The tempo seems to have been
rather unruffled so far, but the next
letter from Jim Reynolds begins to

complain of extremely noisome bed
bugs. Hill's arm was bitten full of
holes by mosquitos, and a spider had ;
bitten him on the neck. The doctor
in the town was out on a call caring
for a horse.
In Guatemala, they were inspected j
time after time by soldiers. So ac- i
customed were they to pulling out
their passports for inspection, that
Hill mechanically drew forth his for
a uniformed hotel solicitor.
Here they also had a three-hour
talk with George Well, American
consul in Guatemala.
Bedbugs, busy ambassadors and j
dictators, passport trouble, and meet
ing the wrong train are a few of
the experiences related to Professor
Lee Chapin in letters from Stan- j
lord's touring debaters, Jim Rey
nolds, A.S.S.U. president; Jim Hill, |
Phi Beta Kappa and ex-debate man
ager; and Talbot Shelton.
Their trouble starting even before i
they left the United States, the de
baters "had a terrific time getting!
over the border" because the Mexi- !
can consul had given them incorrect
passports. If they had gone empty- I

handed to the border, they might. ;
have gone right through with only
several formalities, according to Jim j
Reynolds.
