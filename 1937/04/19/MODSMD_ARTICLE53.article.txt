# Y.W.C.A. Groups Discuss Marriage
## 
### 
Under the auspices of the Y. W.
C. A., Mrs. D. Elton Trueblood has
organized six groups of girls who
are meeting to discuss the useful
ness of college courses in reference j
to their futures.
Since so few courses really pre- !
pare girls for their most probable ;
career, marriage, Mrs. Trueblood
felt that the girls should be given a
chance to find out the interests !
which have been vital to happily i
married women. She and five other I
women on the "Y" board are in
charge of the groups.

The Cubbcrly Education Building,
which is under construction at pres
ent, will be completed in one year.
