# British Ships Defy Franco; Reach Port
## Destroyer Aids Steamer In Dash for Harbor Despite Rebel Warning 
### 
HENDAYE, Franco-Spanish fron
tier, April 18 (U.R).—A British de
stroyer convoying a merchant ship
today defied the Spanish rebel block
ade of the Biscay coast, according
to loyalist dispatches from Gijon.
The destroyer, whose name was
not revealed, was said to have gone
two miles inside Spanish territorial
waters despite warnings from the
rebel generalissimo, Francisco Fran
co, that his fleet would seize or sink
any Spanish or neutral ship at
tempting to run the Biscay blockade.
Three British destroyers were re
ported to have picked up the British
freighter Thorpehall off the loyalist
port of Bilbao—around which Fran
co has established a "starvation
blockade" in an effort to starve
600,000 Basque Spaniards into sub
mission. They accompanied the
merchantman southeastward along
the coast.
The Thorpehall, with destroyers
ahead, behind, and on either side of
her to ward off attacks from the
rebel fleet, steamed 140 miles along
the coast to Puerto del Musel, the
harbor of Gijon.
Two of the destroyers remained
outside the three-mile limit, the
loyalists reported, but the third
steamed alongside the freighter to
within a mile of the port.
When it was apparent that the
Thorpehall was past any danger the
freighter turned about, joined her
companion ships, and steamed up the
coast.

MADRID, April 18 (U.R).—The loy
alist government tonight accused
Italy of organizing, financing and di
recting a gigantic spy ring to seize

The prisoners were charged with
attempting to undermine the exist

Police said the group had prepared
a manifesto to celebrate the entry of
