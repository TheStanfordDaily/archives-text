# Noted Explorer Talks Tonight
## Forbidden Moslem City Will Be Described 
### 
Hans Helfritz, noted explorer of
Arabia, will describe a forbidden
Moslem city in a lecture on "Sky
scrapers in the Desert," at 7:30 to
night in the Little Theater.
Helfritz, German author and sci
entist, has made three trips into re
gions of southwest Arabia, never be
fore penetrated by white men. It is
this area which, according to legend,
was ruled by the Queen of Sheba.
In the city of San'a, now the head
quarters of a bandit chief, he found
buildings of 12 stories, built of sun
baked brick. These structures were
the remains of a civilization older
than Babylon.
Illustrating the lecture with mov
ies taken on his expeditions, Hel
fritz will describe his travels and
adventures. The pictures show ru
ined towns, once ruled by the Queen
of Sheba, and also feature shots of
the ancient "skyscrapers" of San'a.
