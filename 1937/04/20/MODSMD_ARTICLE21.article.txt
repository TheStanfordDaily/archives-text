One Stanford student was killed and lour others injured, one so crit

mobile overturned on Pacheco Pass near Los Banos early yesterday
morning.
James B. Weter, 20, died instantly and Allen Drury, most seriously
injured, was rushed to Los Banos emergency hospital, suffering from a

; Merced Mercy Hospital with spinal
' injury.
Drury Will Recover
The five students, all Alpha Kap
|pa Lambdas, were riding in Ma-
I loney's car, driven by Weter, when
| the automobile went out of control
on a curve and overturned several
times, according to highway patrol
men. Weter's body was thrown 60
feet from the wrecked machine.
Drury, hospital authorities said
last night, will recover unless
"something unforeseen happens."
He will be in a cast for at least two
months and will not be fully recov
