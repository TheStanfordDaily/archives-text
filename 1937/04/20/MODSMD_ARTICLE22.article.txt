# New Daily Plan Is Considered
## Ex Committee Will Take Final Action Tonight 
### 
Regulation of the Daily will re
ceive final consideration from Ex
Committee at its regular meeting
tonight.
A plan advanced by Esther Pelton,
A.S.S.U. vice-president, yesterday
seemed most likely to be accepted
by the legislative body. It was this:
Upon "questionable" articles the
Daily editor shall consult Professor
Chilton R. Bush of the journalism
department. If he runs an article
when Mr. Bush advises against it,
and the article has "repercussions,"
Ex Committee will act "doubly hard"
upon the editor.
Proposed last week was a regular
luncheon meeting of A.S.S.U. leaders
and Daily editors at which time cur
rent student-body problems might
be discussed informally. This plan
will be reconsidered tonight.
With these as alternatives for its
rule regulating campus surveys, Ex
Committee may rescind its previous
act.
Other official business includes
consideration of the Class of '38's
bid for a big time orchestra for the
Junior Prom next month. Ex Com
mittee has ruled that the student
manager must bring dance plans
to it when they involve outside or
chestras. ,
Committeemen will be appointed
to help Chairman George Ditz with
his Pre-registration Program next
fall.
