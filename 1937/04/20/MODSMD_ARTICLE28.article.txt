# 'Lady Precious' Has Traditional Setting
## 
### 
Since the (raditional barren stage of the Chinese theater is disillusion
ing to an American audience, the problem of designing an appropriate
stage setting for Dramatic Council's spring production of "Lady Precious
Stream" has arisen.
To meet this, Technical Director Waldemar Johansen has completed
plans for an exceedingly simple setting which will retain the quaint

Oriental atmosphere. *
The proscenium arch will resem
ble a Chinese temple, guarded on
both sides by smoke-puffing drag
ons. The settings themselves will be
very stylized, consisting of two sets
of winding stairs, and a series of
levels over a high archway, all
three units being movable.
Between scenes the curtains will
remain open, and the audience will
be able to watch the black-clad
property men and stage crew shift
the scenes by the dim light of a
green work lamp. Oriental color
effects will be obtained through the
use of fiery red, orange, and rich
blue lighting and backdrops .
Leads in the play, to be presented
April 30 and May 1 in the Assembly
Hall, will be taken by Phyllis Lakin
in the title role, with Jim Corner
playing her gardener-husband.
Lady Precious Stream's father,
Prime Minister Wang, will be play
ed by Brobury Ellis, and her mother
by Kay Campbell.
The parts of two sisters, Golden
Stream and Silver Stream, will be
taken by Cherie Meherin and Ger
aldine Schreiber, and those of their
husbands, Su and Wei, by Ken Pet
ers and Jack Gillis. Frances Farmer
will play the Princess of the West
ern World.
Also in the cast are Julius Hooven,
Jack King, Bud Cady, Jack Beaty,
Melville Mack, and Allen Newman.
Ticket reservations for the pro
duction may be placed with Dra
matic Manager Dick Daugherty in
the Dramatic Office in the Old Un
ion this week, while seat sale will
begin April 26.
