"Art embraces all the cultural
forces which make up our artistic
lives," says Beniamino Bufano,
sculptor of the new St. Fi'ancis now
being finished in San Francisco.
On this basis, he explained in a
talk yesterday afternoon at the Art

Vinci said, "To know one thing well,
we must know everything better."
Not only must a painter work in
his two dimensions, but he must
find a medium, different from a
sculptor's, for expression of the third
dimension.
"Furthermore." continued Mr. Bu
fano, "a great artist must live in
the past and future as well as the
present. The simplicity of early art
is something that has been aban
doned for many cetnuries.
