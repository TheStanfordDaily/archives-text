## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 19 (UP).â€”
Franklin Delano Roosevelt heaved a
high, short right-hand pitch into the
midst of a bunch of scrambling ball
players today, as he formally opened
the 1937 baseball season.
While more than 30,000 first-day
fans shouted and the army band
blai'ed, the president let fly with a
brand new baseball straight into
the ranks of nine Washington Sen
ators and nine Athletics.
