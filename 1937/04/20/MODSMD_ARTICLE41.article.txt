GOODS TUFF
KIP AND GLIK
Now that the pupils have had their
inning, while the master, heh, heh,
was having his outing—with a bunch
of the gals and boys over Searsville
way—we can start the old grind
again.
'Twas a creditable column Broth
ers Gleekbug and Van Twinkle
whapped out yesterday, creditable
indeed. They are freshmen, you see,
but you'd never know it from what
they get down in print. Maybe they
could outline a course of ten easy
lessons or something, for the old
Siantster.
A WASTE
OF EFFORT
The boys stood right up yesterday
and advocated the double-header
track meet system so many people
have been boosting — running the
Cal-Stanford freshman and varsity
track meets simultaneously Satur
day—and maybe it's a good idea.
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. got the same
idea last week and they're going to
inn both their meets this Saturday
at the same time.
Maybe it's a craze, like pewee
golf.
From where I'm sitting it does
n't look like much of an idea. It
has its points, sure, luit this idea
of giving the customers more for
their money is a lot of malarkey.
The persons that go to track meets
in !)!) cases out of 100 go to see
the varsity perform, and they don't
give a whoop about the freshmen.
If they want to see the freshmen
they get up a little earlier and go
to see them run by themselves,
hut they don't care much about
getting more for their money.
And the comparison-of-times the
ory is likewise so much oil. In some
cases the times will compare favor
ably, it's a cinch. For instance,
there's Stanley Sadaj of the Bear
Frosh, who ran a 4:21.1 mile last
week to post a better mark than any
made by a Cal varsity man this year.
And Modisette of the Bear Frosh with
his 1:56-plus half mile is plenty good,
while Stan Anderson of our freshmen
did 145:5 inches in the discus Satur
day to look tremendous.
However, you can do all the
comparing you want and you still
won't have anything that means
anything to anybody. About all
you can get is a rough idea of the
general strength of both frosh
teams in proportion to the varsities,
and how they might shape up next
year. The whole thing is hypo
thetical.
The time element might be attrac
tive to some persons, but I'd bet a
nickel to a doughnut (two-to-one
odds, you see) that those who are
really interested in the perform
ances, in the main, would get pretty
tired waiting out the frosh events so
they could see what the varsities
were going to do.
Being a sports-writer, it makes
little difference to me, because I
am interested in both anyway. So
if the coaches want to run their meets
together, why, let 'em. It still doesn't
look like anything to get excited
over, though.

Since Stanford trounced Cal in
baseball Saturday, the Southern Cal
Trojans are now tied with the Bears
for the C.1.8.A. lead. It took Stan
ford's aid to give Troy another
chance at the title.
But if you look at the figures, it's
! surprising why U.S.C. isn't far in
the lead over Cal. Batting averages
for the top ten' hitters in the league
were reelased last week, and U.S.C.
has five men in that bunch, two of
them at first and third positions.
Alex Petrnshkin, second - best
, Trojan pitcher, is one hurler who
really can hit, and who has figures
to back him up. He is hitting .417,
|to lead Stanford's deWitt by 12
j points for first.
j Waliy deWitt is Stanford's only
* man in the top ten, while Cal has
(two, St. Mary's one, and Santa Clara
one. That should give U.S.C. quite
j an advantage in the hitting forces,
i what with five to two over Cal.
i Not only that, but the Trojans
boast the class of the pitching tal
ent in the league this year, Goofy
Joe Gonzales. Joe is undefeated this
year, he has pitched something like
j3B straight games without being
beaten. Outside of Joe, 'tis true,
Sam Barry hasn't got much in the
way of pitchers. Comrade Petrush
kin is just fair-to-middlin', but he
isn't as good as our Spike Furman,
j by a long shot.
California, at the same time, has
| Bill Priest, a good boy but one who
j does have his weak moments, and
! then nothing much to back him up.
j David, Laeremans, and Rinne were
; used by Clint Evans Saturday after
; Priest was pounded out, and none
was horribly effective against the
Cards.
That gives Troy the edge in hit—

i ting and almost certainly in pitch
! irtg, to leave only fielding. Now, if
the Trojans are consistent at the
j pace they set in fielding in their
game against the Cards here two
I weeks ago Saturday, they are the
j equal of Cal any day. In the two
: Bear games here in the past two
j week-ends Cliet Evans' boys have
j n't shown any too much stuff on the
I field, so Troy should at least be even
! with Cal on fielding.
With an even break on the han
dles and better hitting and pitch
ing, U.S.C. should be the class of
the league, but still Cal is right up
there, tied for first place. There
! must be some explanation, but it
I isn't very clear to me.
