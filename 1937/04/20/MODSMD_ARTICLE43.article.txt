# Track Team Bears Down For Big Meet
## Reynolds To Compete In Shot Despite Arriving, One Day before Clash 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
All kidding is aside this week on
Angell Field as Dink Templeton and
the boys bear down for THE day of
the season next Saturday, the meet
with California at Berkeley.
The program this week is work,
work, work, and,then a little more,
as the weather is breaking just right
for bearing down hard until Wed
nesday to be followed by three days
of layoff.
Jim Reynolds, who has won the
shot-put against California for the
last two years, probably will com
pete Saturday in spite of missing his
boat home from Central America.
Many have asked whether he will
be any good after the long layoff—
he did take a shot with him but
hasn't used it much—only to be an
swered that Reynolds can usually
throw 47 feet any day in the year.
But even that won't make much dif
ference, as Montgomery is over 50
feet now, and Gribbin threw 154 in
the discus Saturday. With Hershey,
Zagar, and Lipman behind these
boys Cal will be hard pressed to see
any weight points, whether Rey
nolds is there or not. His boat docks
in Los Angeles Friday morning.
Stanford Hiserman beat Kneu
buhl by an eyelash yesterday in 10
flat to lead the sprint workouts,
while Weiershauser ran a 37 flat 352
to set the fastest mark for that dis
tance since Ben Eastman left Stan
ford.
