# Farm Tennis Team Meets Cal Tomorrow
## Tie with U.C., U.C.L.A. Only Hope after 5-4 Defeat Last Saturday 
### 
With only the hope of remaining
in a tie position with University of
California and University of South
i ern California, Stanford netters will
go to Berkeley tomorrow to cross
! rackets with the Golden Bears, who
defeated them in nine close matches
j Saturday morning, 5-4.
Chances of the Cards and Bears
in the first of the two-game series
: were equal throughout all Satur
i day's contests.
Seward, Dey, and Underwood, who
j won their singles matches, are
i counted upon to repeat their vic
tories, as are Chessum and Braly in
| the doubles. This leaves the Indians
| a chance to defeat Cal simply by
winning any one of three other sin
gles contests and two doubles tour
neys.
Best bet for Stanford is the doubles
I combination of Seward and Dey,
the present national intercollegiate
champions. Although Underwood
and Pommei' will again meet the 1935
champs, Newton and Bennett of Cal,
1 two 7-5 scores Saturday show that
i they are not unable to hold their
I own.
j Lynch. Pommer, and Braly com
plete the singles lineup.
