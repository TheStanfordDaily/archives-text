T NTERESTING, that bit about your feet itching,
1 Dud. You know, my head itches. There are
bugs in it. The bugs can read and write and
Ihey call themselves press agents. They say:
"How about more publicity for Peace Day-"
"Where is that other Convalescent Home
yarn you promised?"
"How about the Registrar's notice?"
"Why did we leave out Mamie Glutz' name
in the play reading?"
"What the hell's the matter with the paper
this volume, Eisenbach?"
"How come the freshman edition Sideline
Slants libeled an athletic coach?"
"There are too many pictures in The Daily."
"Don't you dare print that old picture of me
again!"
"The Women's Health Office doesn't know
anything about it."
"Neither do the Paly cops."
And now, Dudman, what was that you were
saying?
Oh, yes; your feet itch.
