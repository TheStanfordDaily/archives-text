THE boys who will have to fight the next war
still have to fight it, even though the 100
peace posters gotten up by the Peace Commit
tee have been junked for others less warlike.
The new posters will read more tactfully,
probably more adroitly. The Peace Committee
can thank Dean Mary Yost for her suggested
changes.
The junked posters said: "Uncle Sam Asks:
Have You Killed Your Hun Today? Hate Every
body until Peace Day, Thursday April 22." They
are revised to read: "Uncle Sam Asked: Have
You Killed Your Hun Today?" (Italics ours.)
Omitting the silly "Hate Everybody" com
mandment, the original version inferred that
Uncle Sam might now or sometime stoop to the
same propaganda techniques he used in the
World War.
And according to our new International Pol
icy, that inference is probably unjustified. Cer
tainly the United States, as far as Washington
big-wigs know, is working hard for peace. It
has even gone so far as to change its necessary
foreign business from overt international bank
ing to covert reciprocal trade.
Young America should appreciate Uncle
Sam's present attitude. But if it is suspicious
of Uncle Sam's future attitude, no one can
blame it. After all, when Uncle Sam changes
his attitude, he will change us into khaki.
For Uncle Sam will stop working for peace
awfully fast when he declares war. And it will
really be too bad.
Except that when our heads are being shot
off, we can die in peace, knowing that we didn't
imply that Uncle Sam might ask us to kill Ger
mans when we weren't sure whether he would
or not.
