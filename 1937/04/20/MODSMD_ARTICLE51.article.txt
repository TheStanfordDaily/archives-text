# Fairy-Tale Stuff
## 
### 
A week ago this morning the campus trem
bled with an election. Hall had lined up
Hall, Row had lined up Row. Candidates had
declined so that others could win. Bosses were
crossing themselves and double-crossing each
other.
That night favorite sons had or had not won—
and Stanford politicians and Stanford voters
v/ent back to their political science professors
the next morning to learn the "ideals" of gov
ernment.
We had once more failed to synthesize our
learning with our doing. In the little rooms on
the Inner Quad we were taught what govern
ment was good, what government was bad. We
were incensed at the outrages committed in the
name of "the people."

But where our own student government is
concerned — the very place we are actually
training for future citizenship—we forget ideal
ism for expediency and indulge in the same
practices which give American public life its
black eye.
Because it comes to us through 8 o'clocks and
five-pound texts, we brand what we learn as
"theory." The social sciences are abstractions,
we figure, not to be confused with actuality.
When it comes to real life, we forget what we've
learned in college; it's "fairy-tale" stuff.
Few of us will apply our political §cience to
public life when we finish school. Few of us
will accept our current ideals and philosophies
ten years from now. College is merely mental
exercise—the liberals and radicals of 1937 will
become the tie salesmen and feed merchants of
1945. Our abstract attitudes, we know too well,
have astoundingly little functional significance.
Whose fault is it? Ours, not our professors'.
By our own admittance we have already found
the election of student officers too much for
text-book methods; we've got to do it way
they do out in the "world."—D. B.
