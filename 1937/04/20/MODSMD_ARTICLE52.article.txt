### 
winter, come summer, come all ye faithful,
4 and women put out editions and freshmen put out
editions, and Daily staff'members put out editions of
The Daily and yesterday was the first time that any
thing worth anything appeared in these lousy col
umns. It almost makes me feel that ma/be after Our
Hasher publishes his book next month and departs
that somebody else will take over the column wher
ever and whenever I leave off, and that is discoui
aging.
In connection with yesterday's frosh edition of The
Daily and by interconnection with the student Peace
Day there is a story. It seems that the earnest young
publicity entrepreneur of the Thursday frolic went to
a little lady and asked her to do 200 words on the nega
tive side of a debate for yesterday's Daily. She said
she was very busy.
"Well," said the jaunty preneur, "I'll write it if
you'll sign your name to it. This was o.k.'d by the
lady, so the pub man wrote her article for her, and
solicited the services of a great gentleman to write
the affirmative.
"I dowanna but I'll do it," said the great gentle
man. However, Sunday afternoon came and went and
the great gentleman did not turn in his article. The
pub man climbed five flights to the Graduate School
of Business floor of Encina, and beat upon the door of
the great gentleman, but the great gentleman had dis
appeared into thin air or else down the drain, so the
pubrepreneur climbcd over the stoop of the Daily of
fice and dropped down the Graduate School of hard
anti-knocks floor, and wrote the affirmative side of
the question himeslf. The ghost goes west and east, by
north and south.
'X'HERE is an El Campo who is funny.
The last time he was in the hospital he utilized
the well-known trick of unhinging the doors and
watching the nurses maim and contuse themselves,
but added a new wrinkle by leading his bed-fellows
in his ward on a little wheel-chair journey. When
the posse of privy chancellors overtook them, the
boys were down on 101 alternate, headed for an oasis
across the bridge. •
The latest experience is definitely a business ven
ture, and shows a due respect for the profit motive.
For 50 cents the El Campo will cut his own classes and
warm the chair of his customer. For 50 cents addi
tional, he offers the dc luxe service which includes
taking notes, with illustrations, and finding out the
name of the blonde.
He reports that his business is flourishing extreme
ly well, with his principal trade in Current Events
and Prof Hulme's courses.
