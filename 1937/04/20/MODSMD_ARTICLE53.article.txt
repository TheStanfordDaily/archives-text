NO FOOLS WHERE ANGELS WALK
IF it were a little hotter this afternoon it would be
possible to fry an egg on the back page of the
Stanford Daily. And if it were a little hotter than that
i might think of boiling Lady Precious Stream and the
Convalescent Home Drive in oil.
But all I can think about it the appalling number
of unsung minor geniuses that there arc around here.

The major genius, of course, is a common category
and hardly needs explanation. To it belong the recog
nized intellectual giants of world history and if the
current crop of 150 plus 280 whips care to class
themselves in this gang, they are free to do it because
I am not concerned with the major genius at all.
The minor genius is not a lesser light but merely a
less consistent performer who occasionally busts up
the orthodox with a magnificent display of the unex
pected. Like, for instance, the time when the com
mon-sense addicts sat around remarking on what a
clever idea it was in Love on the Run to have the
Fontainbleau caretaker come out leading a dog Bis
mark that was purely an imaginary pooch. The minor
genius of that immortal moment demoralized the as
sembly and routed the discussion in confusion by
saying that she—saw the dog.

'INHERE arc others. A long time ago I told the talc
of the balcony hero who screamed the Tarzan
mating call when President Roosevelt in the newsreel
touched his chest while saying "My"friends."
But I don't think I have told the talc of the shiver
ing wit who sat in one corner of a Quad room night
before a philosophy final. As the other last-minute
crammers spilled talk about the "changeless originator
of all change" antl "the unmovcr motivator of all mo
tion" he shook his head and huddled deeper into his
overcoat and finally murmured, "Words, words. 1
can't seem to get beyond the words."

¥F the Latin word ' genius," meaning highly unusual
inventive power, is related to the Arabic word jinni
meaning the spirit which popped up when Alladin
rubbed his magic lantern, then there is likewise a sort
of parallel between this and the way the one-shot
heroes of whom I speak spark their brains and bring
forth a flame of truly colossal proportions. The proc
ess is esoteric and impossible of comprehension, but
what can be produced renews a faith in the poten
tialities of the human psychological process.
1 am referring here with positive worship to the
recent fraternity initiate who was asked during part
of the high-speed ritual whether he placed his faith
in a Supreme Creator of all Being. He replied, "Well,
I don't know. Come to think of it, I don't think 1 do.
Trv fact, no."
