# CAMPUS OPINION
## SO THERE! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Frosh Editor Dick Dudman may
have enjoyed his one day's suprem
acy as glorious head of our worthy
rag, but as far as I am concerned,
he succeeded well in barking up the
wrong tree.
In the past three years I have
never been a constant reader of
l?aily cditc i'li, but G.F. an 1
have succeeded in catching ny at
tention every day since volume 91
began.
The sensible selection of subjects
has no doubt enlisted more readers
<lun me aloia. And Daily ed t>: iais
aie not, thar.k God, filled with la
ments over a sick social system.
Good day, Mr. Ludman.
