# Actors Score In O'Neill Play
## 'Lazarus Laughed' Scene Is Best on Program 
### 
A scene from Eugene O'Neill's
drama, "Lazarus Laughed," was the
first (in merit) of two one-act plays
presented last night by a combined
acting and directing group in the
Little Theater.
Although in its disembodied state
it was nearly, if not completely, in
comprehensible from the standpoint
of the whole play, the fact that
O'Neill wrote some of his most
beautiful lines in this play was eas
ily apparent. Kcrth Baines led a
cast which was able to tie together
the fragment with surprising solid
ity. What there was of it was a
good job, well done.
The second production, "Mrs.
Noah Gives the Sign," by F. Sladen-
Smith, proved to be very ragged and
almost devoid of point. Perhaps it
was an experiment in writing as
well as production; but it was far
from noble.
Cast for "Lazarus Laughed" was
Art Levinson, Brobury Ellis, George
Wood, Kcrth Baines, and Phil
Brown. For "Mrs. Noah Gives the
Sign," Julius Hooven, Barbara
Thrasher, Jack Beaty, Martha Jane
Lutz, Ken Peters, Elinor Steventon,
Bud Cady, Jeanne Melton, J. P.
Cahn, Kcrth Baines, and Dick Mc-
Carty.
