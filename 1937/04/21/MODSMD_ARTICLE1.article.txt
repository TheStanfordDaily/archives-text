Chief grievance of the A.S.U.
against the P.E. Co. was over the
selection of speakers for the Peace
Assembly tomorrow.
Charging that the Committee re
fused to accept the student peace
committee's proposals for a faculty
speaker, and one of its round-table
leaders, the A.S.U. says the P.E. Co.
bludgeoned the student peace com
mittee into accepting the Adminis
tration's dark and dank horses.
These statements were included
in a letter that was assertedly re
fused publication as a campus opin
ion in The Stanford Daily. At a late
hour last night, the letter was still
assertedly refused publication as a
campus opinion in The Stanford
Daily.

Chief grievance of the A.S.U.
against the P.E. Co. was over the
selection of speakers for the Peace
Assembly tomorrow.
Charging that the Committee re
fused to accept the student peace
committee's proposals for a faculty
speaker, and one of its round-table
leaders, the A.S.U. says the P.E. Co.
bludgeoned the student peace com
mittee into accepting the Adminis
tration's dark and dank horses.
These statements were included
in a letter that was assertedly re
fused publication as a campus opin
ion in The Stanford Daily. At a late
hour last night, the letter was still
assertedly refused publication as a
campus opinion in The Stanford

Chief grievance of the A.S.U.
against the P.E. Co. was over the
selection of speakers for the Peace
Assembly tomorrow.
Charging that the Committee re
fused to accept the student peace
committee's proposals for a faculty
speaker, and one of its round-table
leaders, the A.S.U. says the P.E. Co.
bludgeoned the student peace com
mittee into accepting the Adminis
tration's dark and dank horses.
These statements were included
in a letter that was assertedly re
fused publication as a campus opin
ion in The Stanford Daily. At a late
hour last night, the letter was still
assertedly refused publication as a
campus opinion in The Stanford
Daily.
