# Ray Noble Will Play For Junior Prom
## Ex Committee Approves $1150 Contract by 5-3 Vote after Bitter Fight 
### 
Ruy Noble will bring his orches
tra to Stanford May 14 to play for
the Junior Prom.
By a 5-3 vote after 20 stormy min
utes, Ex Committee approved last
night the Class of '38's $1150 con
tract with the noted band leader.
Student Manager Chuck Fontius
strongly opposed the deal because,
he said, the junior class's bank bal
ance was insufficient to cover a pos
sible loss and because the big-time
band complex would eventually
prove financially ruinous to campus
dances.
But the body finally approved
after Tom Killefer, junior president,
upheld the choice of Noble. "The
bids are even cheaper than last
year's," he said.
Vice-president Esther Pelton and
Graduate Members Joe Weiner and
Larry Rouble felt approval would be
setting a bad precedent. "This 'keep
ing- up-with-the-Joneses' business
will next year prevent the hire of
campus orchestras," they said.
Whether or not the Junior Prom
could break even with Noble was
theorized back and forth until Bob
Mallett asked: "Why don't we give
the dance and find out?" The com
mittee agreed.
Fontius had argued that next year
"no dance will draw even flies
without a big time band." Mallett
countered with: "People who want
to dance will dance with or without
big time bands."
