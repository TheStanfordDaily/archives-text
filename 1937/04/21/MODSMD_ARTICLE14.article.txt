# Labor Day Offers Campus Varied Program Today As Drive Hits Home Stretch
## Drive Will Close Friday With Dance Featuring Theme of Coronation 
### 
With Bean Day, Labor Day, and
the Ping Pong Tournament over,
the Convalescent Home Drive will
end Friday with its traditional gala
climaxesâ€”the Junior Water Carni
val and the Masque Ball.
Though the main deviation from
the usual set-up of the whole drive
has been the absence of the penny
a - vote King - Queen contest, the
Masque Ball Committee has tried
to fill its place by selecting a Coro
nation theme, choosing the rulers
at the ball itself, and including a
royal barge in the water carnival.
The king and queen will be pre
sented at 10:30 at the ball in a farci
cal re-enactment of the English
Coronation in March of Time style,
a skit written by Walt Wickett, Hal
Kahn, and Bud Cady.
