### 
The Farm's Convalescent Home
fever shot up another 2V2 degrees
yesterday, when a thousand dessert
seekers attended the annual Straw
berry Brunch in the Union Court,
after a lunch of donated beans.
Lolling on the lawn, the two-bit
philanthropists ate the Roble
served strawberry shox-tcake, drank
coffee, and listened to Griff Wil
liams and three members of his or
chestra. Buddy Marino sang several
numbers, and phonograph records
were played most of the time.
Surprise Event
High point of the afternoon was
Bud Bernhardt's dive into the Un
ion fountain. His swim around the
pool brought a three-dollar collec
tion for the drive.
According to Brunch Chairman
Anne Martineau, profit will come to
around $190. although cofnplete costs
have not yet been determined. Un
der present arrangements, half of
the net profit will go to the Y. W.
C. A.
Fay Is M.C.
Master of* ceremonies for the
brunch was Peter Fay. There were
250 more persons attending than at
any previous brunch.
Profit from the air show Safurday
came to $30. and the total contribu
tion from Bean Day will be an
nounced late this week.
Winner of the three matched
woods in yesterday's golf tourna
ment was Dave MacHarg, who made
a 74 with an 8 handicap. The tour
ney brought only $26 to the drive
fund, because it conflicted with the
brunch.
Tomorrow the Convalescent Home
Drive swings into Tag Day. Fresh
man women will spend the day pry
ing away dimes in return for little
lags designed to decorate every stu
dent on the campus.
