# Heads Ask All Students To Take Part in Work At Convalescent Home
## 
### 
This day, if no other, shalt thou
labor and do all thy work—at the
Convalescent Home—for this is La
bor Day.
Order of the day for all Stanford
students is the abandon of academic
pursuit in favor of the work and
play that is Labor Day at the Con
valescent Home. All afternoon
classes have been officially dismiss
ed, so that complete student co-op
eration from 11 o'clock to 4:30 can
be had in cleaning grounds, wash
ing windows, and painting toys at
the home.
Committee heads emphasize the
fact that work will not be limited to
committee members, but that there
will be plenty to do for everyone.
Following work, an all-university
barbecue, free to all students, will
take the place of dinners served in
living groups.
No Cars Allowed
Mrs. Atwood, director of the Con
valescent Home, has requested that
no students enter the buildings while
they are working today because it
upsets the little inmates. No qars
will be allowed on the home grounds
today; traffic officers will be sta
tioned at all entrances to keep them
out.
In case of accidents, a first-aid kit
and a nurse will be stationed in the
central three-story building of the
group. Men's and women's rest
rooms are also located there. All
work will stop at 4:30 this after
noon.
I naddition to barbecued meat, to
be prepared by Sam McDonaltl,
Spen Lehmann, Ed Bosbyshell, a'nd
their committee, salad, rolls, spag
hetti, and dessert, sandwiches will
be donated by all sororities.
Band To Play
During and after the barbecue,
which will last from 4:30 to 5:30, a
program of entertainment, planned
by Bob Mallett, will be presented.
Swing by a jam band, with vocals
by Shirley Jones and Owen Clarke,
and individual numbers Hoke
Roberts, will be featured.
Hal Kahn will give several varia
tions of Parent-Killing, the Peavy
Tumblers will tumble, Jack Baker
will whistle, and the Stanford band
will play.
Climaxing the day's activities will
be an all-university jolly-up in the
Pavilion, from 6 to 8 o'clock, with
Charlie Graham's band. The finals
of the ping-pong tournament, which
has been going on for the past
