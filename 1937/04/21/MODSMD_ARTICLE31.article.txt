STOOPING OAK, Tenn., April 20
(UP). â€”Jackson Whitlow, 45, who
claims he has a divine order "to
last until the lord tells me to stop,"
began his 42nd day of fasting to
day. He expected an order at church
Sunday telling him to resume regu
lar meals, but none came.
According to an lowa survey,
farmers' eyes are trained to see far
! ther and as a result the average vis
i ion of farm drivers is better than
of city residents.
