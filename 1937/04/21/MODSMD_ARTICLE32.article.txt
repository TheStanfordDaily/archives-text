WE MIGHT
BEAT EM ALL
They laughed when we started to
play—they didn't know wo had a
track team.
One month ago, if any person had
the nerve to say that Stanford was
going to beat Cal, or that the Cards
had a chance to give the mighty
Trojans a real battle in track and
field, he would have been laughed
down.
In fact, about three weeks ago
Brother Hilmer "Hodge-Podge"
Lodge canie out to the track with
a dope sheet that had Stanford beat
ing U.S.C., and the guffaws almost
rattled the bleachers. Nobody would
even attempt to humor Hodge-
Podge, in spite of the fact that they
all realized he is a Stanford nut
(aren't we all) and can be expected
to say wild things.
But now things have changed, are
changing. Bill Henry of the Los
Angeles Times begins to think may
be Stanford is going to beat U.S.C.,
although he admits he doesn't know
why he thinks so. Being an Angel
eno, Henry should have a good slant
on the Trojans, and while his
statement is fine for selling news
papers, it wouldn't come out unless
there was at least the barest pos
sibility.
As for California, if they lose Ar
chie Williams they lose the meet for
sure, and they don't stand better
than an even chance if they have
the great colored boy. You can fig
ure out a perfectly logical dope
sheet, that gives each team an even
break besides giving Williams both
220 and 440, and Stanford still is
just as good or better than the
Bears.
As it stands now, it is very doubt
ful if Williams will run. Coach
Brutus Hamilton won't let him in if
he thinks there is the barest possi
bility of a recurrence of his injury
—some sort of muscle hurt in his leg
—and if there was a race all year
that might present that possibility it
will be the one Archie will have to
run against Ray Malott.
Perhaps he will be fully recovered
by that time, or maybe he's all right
now and Hamilton is using the old
cover-up strategy, under-dog stuff.
If so, he should beat Malott, of
course, although he would know he'd
been in a footrace.
There is also the possibility that
Williams might run only the 220,
which should give him five points.

The varsity tennis team meets Cal
today for the second time over at
Berkeley, in a match that means
everything to both teams. Saturday
the Bears came down here and pull
ed out a 5-4 victory, to go into the
lead in the conference, but they
can't have the old league until they
beat the Cards again today.
If Lockwood's men win today,
they draw up into a tie once again
—if they lose they won't even be
in it. It means a lot, just as much as
to California, and the teams are so
closely matched that the fray today
should be terrifically wicked.
The Bears won by turning'out an
upset in the doubles Saturday, when
Doug Imhoff and Tate Coulthard de
feated Bill Seward and Ben Dey,
national intercollegiate champs. If
Seward-Dey can come back today,
and the rest of the team can hold its
own on the foreign courts, every
thing will be fine.

changing. Bill Henry of the Los
Angeles Times begins to think may
be Stanford is going to beat U.S.C.,
although he admits he doesn't know
why he thinks so. Being an Angel
eno, Henry should have a good slant
on the Trojans, and while his
statement is fine for selling news
papers, it wouldn't come out unless
there was at least the barest pos
sibility.
As for California, if they lose Ar
chie Williams they lose the meet for
sure, and they don't stand better
than an even chance if they have
the great colored boy. You can fig
ure out a perfectly logical dope
sheet, that gives each team an even
break besides giving Williams both
220 and 440, and Stanford still is
just as good or better than the
Bears.
As it stands now, it is very doubt
ful if Williams will run. Coach
Brutus Hamilton won't let him in if
he thinks there is the barest possi
bility of a recurrence of his injury
—some sort of muscle hurt in his leg
—and if there was a race all year
that might present that possibility it
will be the one Archie will have to
run against Ray Malott.
Perhaps he will be fully recovered
by that time, or maybe he's all right
now and Hamilton is using the old
cover-up strategy, under-dog stuff.
If so, he should beat Malott, of
course, although he would know he'd
been in a footrace.
There is also the possibility that
Williams might run only the 220,
which should give him five points.

The varsity tennis team meets Cal
today for the second time over at
Berkeley, in a match that means
everything to both teams. Saturday
the Bears came down here and pull
ed out a 5-4 victory, to go into the
lead in the conference, but they
can't have the old league until they
beat the Cards again today.
If Lockwood's men win today,
they draw up into a tie once again
—if they lose they won't even be
in it. It means a lot, just as much as
to California, and the teams are so
closely matched that the fray today
should be terrifically wicked.
The Bears won by turning'out an
upset in the doubles Saturday, when
Doug Imhoff and Tate Coulthard de
feated Bill Seward and Ben Dey,
national intercollegiate champs. If
Seward-Dey can come back today,
and the rest of the team can hold its
own on the foreign courts, every
thing will be fine.

WE MIGHT
BEAT EM ALL
They laughed when we started to
play—they didn't know wo had a
track team.
One month ago, if any person had
the nerve to say that Stanford was
going to beat Cal, or that the Cards
had a chance to give the mighty
Trojans a real battle in track and
field, he would have been laughed
down.
In fact, about three weeks ago
Brother Hilmer "Hodge-Podge"
Lodge canie out to the track with
a dope sheet that had Stanford beat
ing U.S.C., and the guffaws almost
rattled the bleachers. Nobody would
even attempt to humor Hodge-
Podge, in spite of the fact that they
all realized he is a Stanford nut
(aren't we all) and can be expected
to say wild things.
