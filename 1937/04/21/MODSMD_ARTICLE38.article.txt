# Gridders Put On Pads In First Real Workout
## 
### 
Varsity gridders donned pads for
the first scrimmage of the spring
season held yesterday on the prac
tice field. â™¦
Nearly four teams had a chance
to show their goods. Coach Tiny
Thornhill started with a white-jer
sey combination of Groves at full
back; Vigna and Reade, halves;
Gamier, quarterback; Clarke and
Olcott, ends; West and Creamer,
tackles; Holdridge and Ferko,
guards; and Tsoutsouvas in the
center post.
The Reds started with Collins,
fullback; Walker and Wilson, half
backs; Coldiron, quarter; Stojkovich
and Greer on the flanks; Young and
Mecia, tackles; Dakan and Damarus,
guards; and Sutton in the pivot post.
Jack Clarke demonstrated out
standing blocking skill. Gamier
made some good tackles, as did
Young, a hard-charging freshman
with an effective slashing tackle.
Jim Groves stood out in his first
scrimmage at Stanford for his hard

'drive and foxy cut-back, both of
j which make him hard to down. Tom
Collins showed a promising toe with
three good quick kicks.
Tom Walker, a freshman half
back, demonstrated fine blocking
skill. Chad Reade, also a frosh, did
a good job of returning punts, and
may some day find himself in Cof
fis' and Madlem's safety post.
Bill Paulman, completely cured
; after a siege of torn adhesions of
the ankle last week, did not take a
chance in scrimmage, but expects to
don the pads before the week is
over.
