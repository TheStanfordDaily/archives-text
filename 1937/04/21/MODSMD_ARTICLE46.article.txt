Dear mr. war god :
On December 21 I always write letters to
Santy Claus. But Santy never answers.
So, on this April 21, I'm writing a letter to you,
assured that some time in my life you will
answer.
You will be glad to hear that you have the
Stanford Chapter of the American Student
Union on your side. I say this confidentially,
because they don't even know it.
Yesterday they tried to start a war (the
war was for peace, by the way) and you will
be gratified to know they started by issuing
Jour pages of propaganda.
They have convinced themselves that they
must FIGHT for Peace. Isn't that swell?
Until the American Student Union and simi
lar organizations came along, I understand you
weren't sure about your job. All you had pull
ing for you were the munitions makers and Pa
Morgan.
But you needn't worry any more. These boys
down here can do half your job for you—just
by getting people ready to fight for something.
It's a fact they fortunately don't realize: that
the ability of man to battle, regardless of what
he battles for, is the basic ingredient of war.
They think peace needs fighting for, and so
they're busy getting on the side of the fence
they say stands for peace. They don't realize
that one side of a fence implies that there's an
other side. And that when you have two sides
on anything, you have the dramatis personae
for a battle, whether it be for peace, for Fascism,
for Communism, or just for war, itself.
Their side, to keep your records straight, is
not the side of those Fascists on the Board of
Public Exercises, nor the side of that champion
of capitalistic corruption—Dr. Wilbur. Their
side is the other side.
They don't want an Assembly on peace. They
want a strike. They don't want this speaker,
they want that one.
I don't know why this is—why the American
Student Union falls so neatly into this paradox.
But it does.
From all indications, I'll be seein' ya.
Sincerely,
Bob Eisenbach

they're busy getting on the side of the fence
they say stands for peace. They don't realize
that one side of a fence implies that there's an
other side. And that when you have two sides
on anything, you have the dramatis personae
for a battle, whether it be for peace, for Fascism,
for Communism, or just for war, itself.
Their side, to keep your records straight, is
not the side of those Fascists on the Board of
Public Exercises, nor the side of that champion
of capitalistic corruption—Dr. Wilbur. Their
side is the other side.
They don't want an Assembly on peace. They
want a strike. They don't want this speaker,
they want that one.
I don't know why this is—why the American
Student Union falls so neatly into this paradox.
But it does.
From all indications, I'll be seein' ya.
Sincerely,
Bob Eisenbach
