# Plug for Pluggers

THIS is what is known as an editorial plug.
Ordinarily The Daily, or any newspaper for
that matter, will shy at the sight of this particu
lar animal, for solicited news is desired pub
licity and desired publicity is often not news.
Today The Daily takes pleasure in not shying.
This week Stanford is holding its annual Con
valescent Home Drive. One glance at the front
page today assures that.
It's a fine project, this drive, one that not
only gives needful kiddies support in their
struggle to regain health, but one that unites
the University in a project the result of which
is plainly visible to each participant.
The drive would lack appeal if it were for
a charity far removed from Stanford. It would
lack appeal if it did not unite student with stu
dent as day laborers, as today, or if it did not

introduce Stanford to Stanford as kings Friday
night.
As it is, the Convalescent Home Drive is a
well-planned, so far efficiently managed project
with suitable appeal and worthy cause. Despite
the fact that these words have been uttered so
often that they are distinctly cliche, the Home
Drive is okay.
It gets our editorial plug.—G. F.
