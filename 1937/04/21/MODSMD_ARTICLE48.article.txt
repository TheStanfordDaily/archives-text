(From the Columbia Spectator)

BEER is one of the best sellers in the Grill.
Everyone likes beer, and the Grill makes
money by selling it in large quantities.
Everybody also likes other similar beverages,
but the Grill doesn't sell them. Some years ago
Grill Manager Arthur Moore announced that
his eating place had tabooed stronger drinks
to prevent gold-digging females from bank
rupting local romeos. This is a fine and noble
sentiment, but it still leaves us with a gnawing
feeling in the pit of our stomach.
Certain grades of wine, which might not
please the seasoned connoisseur, are neverthe
less highly satisfactory. A glass of good Cali
fornia wine can be sold for ten cents, and should
prove pleasing to Grill patrons. At such a price
most students' bankrolls are relatively safe,
unless they run up against ladies of unusual
consumptive abilities.
How about it, Mr. Moore? When does wine
appear on the Grill menu?
