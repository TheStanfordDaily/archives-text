STANFORD lost to California in tennis Satur
day. The matches were played at Stanford.
The rooters were predominantly Californians.
If this were the Stanford Hi Weekly we'd say
today: "You students just must come out and
root for our team especially when they are
playing right here at our own school. You
should show your school spirit, and support the
red and white, for the team needs your support
to win for the red and white, it does."
But this is the Stanford Daily, whether that
be an admittance of superiority or not. And
the facts are these: The reason Stanfordites
don't go to tennis matches is that they don't give
a damn. It might be said more delicately, but
hardly more characteristically.
The reason Stanfordites didn't give a damn
in this particular case is that there are too many
other things to give a damn about.
Most of the people who would have watched
Stanford lose Saturday but didn't, were ignorant
of the fact that the matches were to be played,
not because The Daily didn't give them ade
quate publicity, but because the would -be
watchers didn't give a damn.
Stanford people are, for the large part, sen
sible people. A few times each year they turn
the adrenalin loose to root for dear old Stanford
at a Big Game Bonfire, Big Game, and Big Meet.
The rest of the time Stanford people just
watch. Outsiders call it sophistication.
Perhaps that's what it is. But there is certain
merit in not letting emotions run wild every time
Stanford wants to win something. And whether
there is merit in it or not, that is how Stanford
acts.
So it is that when Stanford loses to California
in tennis, and the rooters are scant, there is no
need to howl over spirit. Stanford people will
still go to see what they want to see if they want
to.—G. F.
