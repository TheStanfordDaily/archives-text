# Committee Ends Censor Survey Snarl
## Bush To Act as Advisor For Daily Articles Of Debatable Nature 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Ex Committee last night made
Professor Chilton R. Bush of the
journalism department its advisor to
the Daily, and subsequently rescind
ed its ruling of a fortnight ago cen
soring campus surveys.
In the future, according to the
ruling, Mr. Bush will advise Daily
editors when they seek his advice on
"questionable" articles. If articles
printed despite his negative deci
sion "kick back," Ex Committee will
take "especially severe punitive
measures" against the editor.
To further "good will" between
Ex Committee and the Daily, A. S.
S. U. executives and the Daily edi
torial board will hold informal
luncheon mefetings regularly to dis
cuss their mutual problems, the
committee decided last night.
These two measures replaced the
one passed two weeks ago which
outlawed all campus surveys or
questionnaires except those ap
proved by Ex Committee.
