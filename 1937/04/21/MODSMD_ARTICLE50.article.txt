ART FOR ART'S SAKE

ACROSS from the English Corner there is a not
very-large building called the Art Gallery, but
just, what is considered arty about it has always been
a mystery.
Of all the white elephants any college ever owned,
the Stanford Art Gallery is perhaps the whitest un
less you think of the museum and then you arcn t
thinking, you're gasping.

We're here in a university, supposedly a center of
culture, and we have a cultural center that is neither
cultural nor a center. In short, it is not much of any
thing except, a miscellaneous collection of abortive at
tempts at art.
Students rarely go to the gallery. Visitors go there
and come away feeling despondent rather than up
lifted. They also feel cheated because on entering
they hope to experience an emotion, but the only
emotion they experience is one of disgust.
Maybe Mr. de Lcmos is to blame. Maybe Stanford
is to blame. Maybe lack of interest of the students in
things cultural is to blame, but anyway something is
wrong.

Now a good art show, given the proper amount of
publicity, can draw more people than the best movie
ever made and, what's more, it can be twice as effec
tive as an emotional stimulus to tired spirits. Note the
Van Gogh exhibit in the city last spring.
The Van Gogh exhibit packed the house for all
performances, not because Van Gogh was a particu
larly great artist, but because he was timely and
vital.
Instead of being timely, however, Stanford contin
ues to hang pictures in its gallery tht speak of a gilded
age; an age with which we of today have but little
sympathy.

We live in an intensely interesting world, a world
in which men do things, a world of reality.
Why can't we have some pictures in the Art Gal
lery that mean something to us, that really live as
we live?
You may complain you don't understand art, that
you don't like art exhibitions, but I'm telling you,
brother, a good art gallery can do wonders for you.
Right* now the best the Art Gallery has to offer in
the way of things real is an exhibit of old Bibles.
Yeah man!
