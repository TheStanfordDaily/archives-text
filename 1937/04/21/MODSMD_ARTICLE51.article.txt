The Editor, Sir:
I take this means to protest
against an article written in your
Monday's Daily in which I am cred
ited with authoring an argument re
garding the "Futility of Peace Agi
tations." I did not write the article,
nor was it written with my permis
sion, and I did not know that such
an article was being written until
I opened my Daily Monday morn
ing. I hope you will print this let
ter to clear my name in the matter.
Sincerely,
Larry Rouble
Mr. Rouble should sec Mr. Jor-
Rcnsen. The editor will be sec
onds for both parties at dawn in
the Little Theater.
