# FROSH FOOT-FAULT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Regarding the "Rule but not
Sportsmanship" comment in "Side
line Slants" of Monday's issue, may
I offer my contribution as based up
on close personal observation.
Why a Stanford coach should be
termed unsporting when he attempts
to protect a competitor under his
charge from illegal or unfair tactics
on the part of the opposition, and
why such unfounded criticism
should come from our own news
paper, is beyond my understanding.
When two such evenly matched
tennis players such as Newton and
Lynch oppose each other, a tremen
dous advantage goes to the man who
can more quickly reach the net on
his own service. My observation
was that the California player left
the ground from one to two inches
with both feet and landed eight to
twelve inches inside the baseline on
practically every service. This gave
him exceptional power on the ball,
and at the same time allowed him
an initial start for the net to cut
off his opponent's passing shots,
which he might not have been able
to achieve had his serves been legal.
To conform to the rules in serving,
so far as foot faults are concerned,
a player "shall throughout the de
livery of the service (a) Not change
his position by walking or running
(b) maintain contact with the
ground, (c) keep both feet behind
the base line." (Wright and Ditson
—Rules of Lawn Tennis, page 8.) I
am convinced that the California
player violated the (b) and (c) pro
visions of this rule, and secured the
advantage outlined above.
Stanford players have been known
to foot-fault in the past. But re
gardless of the statement made by
your critics I submit that Stanford
men did not foot-fault last Saturday
as much as did their opponents.
Two years ago the California coach
rightly requested that a foot-fault
judge be placed on a Stanford play
er, and no objection was made by
the Stanford coach or players. Quite
the reverse was the case Saturday
last.
Your critics state that the Stan
ford coach used "poor taste in bring
ing the matter up when he did." Is
that fair? Here was a situation
where a coach observed one of his
own team fighting unfair odds well
into the deciding set of his match,
hoping to break down those odds
and win out, but finding the advan
tage too great. So he protested in
the way he had a right to do, and
thereby opened the floodgates of
wrath upon his head.

The Editor, Sir:
Regarding the "Rule but not
Sportsmanship" comment in "Side
line Slants" of Monday's issue, may
I offer my contribution as based up
on close personal observation.
Why a Stanford coach should be
termed unsporting when he attempts
to protect a competitor under his
charge from illegal or unfair tactics
on the part of the opposition, and
why such unfounded criticism
should come from our own news
paper, is beyond my understanding.
When two such evenly matched
tennis players such as Newton and
Lynch oppose each other, a tremen
dous advantage goes to the man who
can more quickly reach the net on
his own service. My observation
was that the California player left
the ground from one to two inches
with both feet and landed eight to
twelve inches inside the baseline on
practically every service. This gave
him exceptional power on the ball,
and at the same time allowed him
an initial start for the net to cut
off his opponent's passing shots,
which he might not have been able
to achieve had his serves been legal.
To conform to the rules in serving,
so far as foot faults are concerned,
a player "shall throughout the de
livery of the service (a) Not change
his position by walking or running
(b) maintain contact with the
ground, (c) keep both feet behind
the base line." (Wright and Ditson
—Rules of Lawn Tennis, page 8.) I
am convinced that the California
player violated the (b) and (c) pro
visions of this rule, and secured the
advantage outlined above.
Stanford players have been known
to foot-fault in the past. But re
gardless of the statement made by
your critics I submit that Stanford
men did not foot-fault last Saturday
as much as did their opponents.
Two years ago the California coach
rightly requested that a foot-fault
judge be placed on a Stanford play
er, and no objection was made by
the Stanford coach or players. Quite
the reverse was the case Saturday
last.
Your critics state that the Stan
ford coach used "poor taste in bring
ing the matter up when he did." Is
that fair? Here was a situation
where a coach observed one of his
own team fighting unfair odds well
