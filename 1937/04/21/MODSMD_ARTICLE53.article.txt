# IT'S FIXED, AUNTIE

The Editor, Sir:
May I ask Ihc reason for the sud- !
den desire of the Ex Committee to i
censor "questionable" articles that :
might appear in the Daily in the fu
ture? I have no copy of the A.S.S.U.
Constitution or by-laws, but if my
memory serves me correctly, the Ex
Committee is perfectly within ils!
legal rights. The A.S.S.U. is? the ;
publisher of the Daily, and the af
fairs of the A.S.S.U. arc managed by
Ex Committee. The story of a pub
lisher regulating the conduct of a
paper is not new. Mr. William Ran- i
dolph Hearst also maintains a guid- j
ing hand over his publications. But,
I hardly thought, that the Ex Com- |
mittec of Stanford University ap
proved of this individual to such an !
extent as to imitate his methods. I
Nor, unlike the United States Con- i
stitution, does the A.S.S.U. Consti- j
tution contain any provision guar- ;
anteeing freedom of speech and '
press. This oversight on the part of
drafters has one of two possible ex
planations. Either the drafters felt
that if the United States could trust !
the ayerage person with the right to j
print what he pleased, the A.S.S.U. I
could certainly trust a college stu
dent, and therefore it was thought
to be unnecessary to be included, or
that the possibility that an Ex Com
mittee with an inflated idea of its |

own importance might censor the
Daily was considered too remote.
According to the Daily, the Ex
Committee will content itself with
regulating only "questionable" ar
ticles, and "campus surveys." What
is a questionable article? Now, is
n't that a foolish question. Of course
the answer is obvious. It is one
which the Ex Committee questions.
And, what is a campus survey?
Why, that's easy. It's anything that
pertains to campus life, or three
quarters of the material that ap
pears in the Daily. With the censor
ship powers of the Ex Committee so
well defined, I suggest that the Ex
Committee move into the Daily
shack and start printing the paper
now, and that the present staff con
fine its efforts to editing United
Press reports.
Of course the motive of the Ex
Cqmmittee is clean, pure, and sim
ple. Stanford's name must be kept,
clean. This will enshrine Stanford
in the hearts of its wealthy alumni.
And, the wealthy alumni may be so
moved by the symbol of purity that
they will shower funds on the uni
versity, and thus Stanford's endow
ment will be increased. Think of it,
friends, the Ex Committee will do
all this for us, if we only give them
a chance! Isn't that a lofty and ele
vating motive? Of course, the Ex
Committee doesn't give a d about
the true state of affairs. They only
want the power to prevent the
wealthy alumni from finding out.
As I said before, the motive of the
Ex Committee is clean, pure, and
SIMPLE.
When it comes to choosing be
tween the Ex Committee and the ed
itor, who has had at least three years
of journalistic experience under his
belt, I choose the editor every time
to print what he sees fit in the
Stanford Daily. If the faculty
wants a hand in the paper, I sug
gest that they be given a column,
or even the whole newspaper if that
will satisfy them, and the same
thing goes for the Ex Committee,
who thus far have demonstrated
that they are faculty puppets and
nothing more. But, I decry the plan
which seeks to make every editor a

king, or rather an Emperor of
Manchukuo.

ture? I have no copy of the A.S.S.U.
Constitution or by-laws, but if my
memory serves me correctly, the Ex
Committee is perfectly within ils!
legal rights. The A.S.S.U. is? the ;
publisher of the Daily, and the af
fairs of the A.S.S.U. arc managed by
Ex Committee. The story of a pub
lisher regulating the conduct of a
paper is not new. Mr. William Ran- i
dolph Hearst also maintains a guid- j
ing hand over his publications. But,
I hardly thought, that the Ex Com- |
mittec of Stanford University ap
proved of this individual to such an !
extent as to imitate his methods. I
Nor, unlike the United States Con- i
stitution, does the A.S.S.U. Consti- j
tution contain any provision guar- ;
anteeing freedom of speech and '
press. This oversight on the part of
drafters has one of two possible ex
planations. Either the drafters felt
that if the United States could trust !
the ayerage person with the right to j
print what he pleased, the A.S.S.U. I
could certainly trust a college stu
dent, and therefore it was thought
to be unnecessary to be included, or
that the possibility that an Ex Com
mittee with an inflated idea of its |

own importance might censor the
Daily was considered too remote.
According to the Daily, the Ex
Committee will content itself with
regulating only "questionable" ar
ticles, and "campus surveys." What
is a questionable article? Now, is
n't that a foolish question. Of course
the answer is obvious. It is one
which the Ex Committee questions.
And, what is a campus survey?
Why, that's easy. It's anything that
pertains to campus life, or three
quarters of the material that ap
pears in the Daily. With the censor
ship powers of the Ex Committee so
well defined, I suggest that the Ex
Committee move into the Daily
shack and start printing the paper
now, and that the present staff con
fine its efforts to editing United
Press reports.
Of course the motive of the Ex
Cqmmittee is clean, pure, and sim
ple. Stanford's name must be kept,
clean. This will enshrine Stanford
in the hearts of its wealthy alumni.
And, the wealthy alumni may be so
moved by the symbol of purity that
they will shower funds on the uni
versity, and thus Stanford's endow
ment will be increased. Think of it,
friends, the Ex Committee will do
all this for us, if we only give them
a chance! Isn't that a lofty and ele
vating motive? Of course, the Ex
Committee doesn't give a d about
the true state of affairs. They only
want the power to prevent the
wealthy alumni from finding out.
As I said before, the motive of the
Ex Committee is clean, pure, and
SIMPLE.
When it comes to choosing be
tween the Ex Committee and the ed
itor, who has had at least three years
of journalistic experience under his
belt, I choose the editor every time
to print what he sees fit in the
Stanford Daily. If the faculty
wants a hand in the paper, I sug
gest that they be given a column,
or even the whole newspaper if that
will satisfy them, and the same
thing goes for the Ex Committee,
who thus far have demonstrated
that they are faculty puppets and
nothing more. But, I decry the plan
which seeks to make every editor a

king, or rather an Emperor of
Manchukuo.
