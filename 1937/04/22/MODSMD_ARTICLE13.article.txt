# Peace Strikers Total Million
## Largest Demonstration Set For 11 o'clock 
### 
NEW YORK, April 21 (UP). â€”
Throughout the nation tonight up
wards of 1,000,000 students awaited
word to begin the largest student
peace demonstrations in American
history.
Officials of the United Student
Peace Committee here said the or
der had gone out for students to
leave their classrooms at 11 o'clock
tomorrow.
Last year more than 500,000 stu
dents participated in the anti-war
demonstrations.
Although the form of the demon
strations will range from strikes in
most leading American colleges to
peace assemblies in scores of high
schools, the event will be far more
united and representative than ever
before, John Wechsler, speaking for
the committee, said tonight.
New York again will be the cen
ter of the anti-war activity with
more than 40,000 college students
and 75,000 high school students ex
pected to participate in the day's ac
tivities.
Wechsler said reports from all
parts of the country indicated the
strike is receiving wider endorse
ment in every afea than in previous
years.
The first major note in the anti
war day observance was sounded to
night in Washington where Senator
Robert M. LaFollette spoke, hailing
the student demonstration.
More than 500 colleges and uni
versities will be effected by the
strike call, it was said.
