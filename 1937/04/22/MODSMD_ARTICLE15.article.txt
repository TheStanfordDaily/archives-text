# War Dinged In Student Peace Poll
## 
### 
War virtually was outlawed by
Stanford students yesterday when
1,078 Farm men and women voiced
their opinions on peace in a survey
conducted by Peace Day Committer.
But when the question concerned
the United States, 560 stated they
I would fight if the country were in
i vaded. Of this number, 245 were
women.
Only 43 students — ten of them
i women —voted for war as the best
means of settling world problems.
: Most popular solution was co-oper
-1 ation among nations for the preven
: tion of war, directed against those
! nations provoking war, advocated by
816 students. Seventy-eight voted
; for world socialism. One student
! wrote in his own solution, a world
. government with nations as states.
Munition Makers Dinged
The munitions industry was ding
ed when 856 students voted to pro
hibit the shipment of war materials
to all countries at war. Seventy-five
I would allow munitions to be sup
' plied only to nations attacked, while
147 agreed to the impartial sale of
war materials to all countries.
; Patriotic zeal had little effect on
118 students who stated they would
! fight for the United States under no
j circumstances.
Co-operation Favored
As the United States' policy when
1 war threatens in other parts of the
! world, 501 voted to act with other
nations in barring munitions and
i other supplies from attacking coun
tries, but under no circumstances
using armed force.
A woman student refused to an
swer this question, stating she was
the daughter of a munitions manu
facturer. On other divisions of the
ballot, she advocated war as the best
. means of settling world problems,
' the impartial sale of munitions to all
countries, and reduction of our pres
ent military and naval budgets un
der no circumstances.
Six hundred seventy-one students
favored war budget reductions only
if similar reductions are made by
other great powers.
