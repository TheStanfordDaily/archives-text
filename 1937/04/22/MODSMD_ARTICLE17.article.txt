# Ex Committee Outlines New Election Rules
## Board Chairman Allison Partially Exonerated As Victim of 'System' 
### 
Main reason Election Board was
charged with "mismanagement and
inefficiency" during last week's
election was the lack of codified
rules of procedure, Ex Committee
has decided.
Partially exonerating Chairman
Dave Allison as a victim of the
"system," Ex Committee has ap
pointed a subcommittee to draw up
Election Rules which can be used
and amended from election to elec
tion.
Poll System Changed
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the law
school, A.S.S.U.'s "supreme court,"
has clarified the preferential system
of voting by drafting a by-law to
the Constitution which Ex Commit
tee this week approved. This will
give Election Board hard - and - fast
rules for counting second and third
choices when necessary.
The double-precinct polling meth
od, criticized for the chance it left
open for illegal voting, will be
changed. Students with last names
beginning with A to J may vote in
the future at one poll, the rest at
the other.
The question of ballots with faulty
marks — which enabled Election
Board to throw out 145 votes in the
presidential recount last week—has
been answered by Dean Kirkwood:
Ballot Marks Optional
Second and third choices are op
tional, not absolutely necessary as
demanded this year, he ruled. "X"
marks are not mandatory, either;
any mark may be used which plain
ly indicates the choice.
The election subcommittee—Men's
Council Chairman Bill Quade, Sen
ior Man Bob Mallett, Sophomore
Man-elect Lyle Cook, and Allison—
will report next Tuesday.
