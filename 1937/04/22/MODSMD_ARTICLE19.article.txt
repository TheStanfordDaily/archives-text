# Mob Leader Turns Pacifist After War
## 
### 
In April. 1917. David Starr Jordan, then Chancellor Emeritus of Stan
ford University, narrowly escaped bodily harm when a mob of Johns
Hopkins students attacked him while addressing a peace meeting.
Ten years later, a student who led the mob published a public apology
in The Modern World, a magazine of which he was editor.
The letter is reprinted in The Daily on Peace Day as a reminder of
what has happened and what may happen.

On the first Sunday in April, 1917.
[ you were standing on the stage of
| the Academy of Music in Baltimore,
! Maryland, making—before the Bal
| timore Open Forum — a protest
| against the impending participation
| of this country in the European war.
j You were interrupted and the meet
j ing broken up by the sudden violent
] entrance of a mob which had burst
| through the cordon of police outside
I the theater. I was the leader of this
J mob which succeeded in rendering
| your appeal unavailing.
Appeal Unsuccessful
This event took place nearly ten
I years ago. I was at that time twenty
; years old. 1 have tried to recall what
j motivated my action on this occa
j sion. At twenty, one is mature and
i presumably motivated by reason,
j You were not successful in your
J appeal. Seventy thousand youths
| were killed in the struggle which
j came despite your endeavors. I saw
j many of these youths die! By sea
I and on land I saw their agonies,
' their miseries, their racked and man
gled bodies. I happened to escape
their fate.
No Apology
I do not apologize to you, Sir. No
apology is possible for such an act.
j 1 assure you only that experience
j and maturity have brought me the
j poignant realization that on that
Sunday evening so long ago you
were motivated by the principle* of
civilization, while I was motivated by
i the passions of barbarism.
Sincerely yours,
Carter G. Osborn, Jr.
