# Handicappers Place Odds On Card Trackmen
## Practice Trials Indicate Indian Outfit in Top Form for Cal Meet 
### 
If you can't tell now who'll win
Saturday's Big Meet you might ts
well wait and see it, because from
here oi\ (he boys go into semi-hiber
nation to let their muscles build up
a bit of glycogen for the tasks com
ing due across the bay.
This year's meet will mark a re
turn to the form of a few years back,
i when Stanford used to be favored
as a regular thing. California has
drawn the pre-meet nod for three
! years now, having been a good
newspaper team ever since Coach
Brutus Hamilton took over, but this
' year even the most rabid of handi
-1 cappers have leaned Stanford's way.
Reynolds Returns
Stanford's final workouts yester
day saw Jim Reynolds emerge from
a shroud of doubt about his return
from Central America, and get some
good 49-foot puts out in two prac
j tice sessions. Gribbin, Zagar,
Montgomery, and Hershey all are in
lop form and should present an 18-
point wall in the weight division at
Edwards Field Saturday.
Jack Weiershauser ran 24.4 and
49.7 in his taper-off, and stands
I ready to handle the lows and a re
i lay lap, and to take something out
;of the hundred. Ray Malott is rar
| ing to go in the quarter, and all
kinds of milk-shakes have been bet
each way on his breaking 48 sec
' onds around the one-turn route.
[ Gordy Hyde is definitely out of the
I quarter, with McCall slated to take
his place.
The dashes and high, hurdles are
j presenting the interesting part of
this track meet. George Anderson
a few years ago was the fastest
: white man going, and this year is
I having a rapid but unsteady come
| back after a bad knee injury. Frick
j and Trumbly and Pollock, also of
< the Bears, are turning in good times
j all this week while the Stanford
j trio of Kneubuhl, Hiserman, and
Carew goes serenely on training,
! wondering just what's going to
!happen.
Alexander To Run Mile
Dink Templeton has finally sched
j uled Bob Alexander for the mile,
j after his sterling 3:04.6 performance
; Tuesday, and has set Ed Burrows
and Rusty March back to handle the
| two-mile. California's premier dis
tance man, Chuck Mehlert, is pe
| riodically being shunted from one
race to the other, will probably end
up in the eight-lap.
The McCurdy - Wieman-Mahurin
I battle in the half, the Gill-Monroe
pole vault fest, and the Morrison
; Jacques competition in the high
jump all are uncallable, and should
I present many surprises to the gath
ering. Tickets will be available at
the gate for those who didn't buy

If you can't tell now who'll win
Saturday's Big Meet you might ts
well wait and see it, because from
here oi\ (he boys go into semi-hiber
nation to let their muscles build up
a bit of glycogen for the tasks com
ing due across the bay.
This year's meet will mark a re
turn to the form of a few years back,
i when Stanford used to be favored
as a regular thing. California has
drawn the pre-meet nod for three
! years now, having been a good
newspaper team ever since Coach
Brutus Hamilton took over, but this
' year even the most rabid of handi
-1 cappers have leaned Stanford's way.
Reynolds Returns
Stanford's final workouts yester
day saw Jim Reynolds emerge from
a shroud of doubt about his return
from Central America, and get some
good 49-foot puts out in two prac
j tice sessions. Gribbin, Zagar,
Montgomery, and Hershey all are in
lop form and should present an 18-
point wall in the weight division at
Edwards Field Saturday.
Jack Weiershauser ran 24.4 and
49.7 in his taper-off, and stands
I ready to handle the lows and a re
i lay lap, and to take something out
;of the hundred. Ray Malott is rar
| ing to go in the quarter, and all
kinds of milk-shakes have been bet
each way on his breaking 48 sec
' onds around the one-turn route.
[ Gordy Hyde is definitely out of the
I quarter, with McCall slated to take
his place.
The dashes and high, hurdles are
j presenting the interesting part of
this track meet. George Anderson
a few years ago was the fastest
: white man going, and this year is
I having a rapid but unsteady come
| back after a bad knee injury. Frick
j and Trumbly and Pollock, also of
< the Bears, are turning in good times
j all this week while the Stanford
j trio of Kneubuhl, Hiserman, and
Carew goes serenely on training,
! wondering just what's going to
!happen.
Alexander To Run Mile
Dink Templeton has finally sched
j uled Bob Alexander for the mile,
j after his sterling 3:04.6 performance
; Tuesday, and has set Ed Burrows
and Rusty March back to handle the
| two-mile. California's premier dis
tance man, Chuck Mehlert, is pe
| riodically being shunted from one
race to the other, will probably end
up in the eight-lap.
The McCurdy - Wieman-Mahurin
I battle in the half, the Gill-Monroe
pole vault fest, and the Morrison
; Jacques competition in the high
jump all are uncallable, and should
I present many surprises to the gath
