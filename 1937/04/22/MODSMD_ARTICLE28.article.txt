NOTHING LIKE
BEING PREPARED

Tuesday afternoon big Jim Kitts
put the shot 51 feet over at Cali
fornia, and now Blutus Hamilton
can start feeling sorry for himself.
Kitts is quite a shot-putter, and
51 feet would be just about enough
1o win the event in the Big Meet
Saturday, but unfortunately Broth
er Kitts is not eligible, since he is
carrying only 9 J 2 units of new work.
Ten units, you see, would make him
eligible.,
He came out Tuesday after a
long, long lay-off because of a
sprained wrist, just to see what he
could do, and gave Hamilton an
awful headache with his toss. If the
master minds across the Bay had
only thought to have Kitts carry
enough units to make him eligible
this quarter, and take a chance that
maybe his wrist would be in good
shape by now, they would have a
good shot-putter.
As it stands now, the Bears have
only Hankey, just another weight
man who doesn't figure to even
place in the Big Meet. Are we
laughing!

TAKE IT EASY,
TOM

At the same time. Dink Temple
ton is having a little trouble with
his shotputting talent, in the Tom
Montgomery department. This is
worth laughing out of the other side
of our faces about, too.
It seems that Large Thomas has
been doing entirely too much fool
ing around since he did 49-11% in
the Washington meet —thg mark has
given him quite a superiority com
plex, to hear the boys tell it, and
he won't get back down to work.
Tuesday afternoon Dink told Tom
1o go in and get dressed, because
he didn't want him out there did
dling around in self-complacency.
Tom went in, because if he hadn't
he woiildn't have competed in the
Big Meet, shotputter or no shot
putter.

THE SAME
OLD THING

It's a funny thing, but practically
every year the Bears start out their
track season with a bunch of boys
who are all great prospects, who
make up what is going to be one
of the strongest-ever California
track and field teams. Along about
mid-season things start happening
—some get hurt, some develop
aches and pains, or somehow the
potential greats just don't seem to
materialize.
Stanford usually starts the year
with a bunch of hicks that can't run
or jump fast enough to get out of
their own ways, and then about
two weeks from the Big Meet they
blossom out like nobody's business,
The old situation is true again
this year. Over at Cal they had
the "second-best" college dual
meet team in the country early in
the year, right behind U.S.C. Now
they don't look quite so good, since
being defeated by U.S.C. convinc
ingly, and then bowing to Michigan
even lower. Archie Williams is
hurt, Arnold Nutting is hurt, Char
lie Mehlert dropped like a plum
met after a brilliant early season,
Bob Heavey is slowly getting into
shape but isn't where he should be,
George Anderson still isn't out there,
Doug Lehman has a sore arm, and
so on far into the afternoon.
Stanford, why, the poor old In
dians were in for a series of drub
bings this year, to hear the fellers
tell it a couple of months ago. Out
side of a couple of weightmen, a
good half-miler, a fair miler, and just
an ordinary quarter-miler Dink
Templeton didn't have enough pros
pects to make up a grammar-school
outfit.
The situation started shifting
around, new men appeared, the old
ones showed they still had some
thing on the ball, and now Stanford
is just as good or maybe a little
beter on paper than the mfghty

Bears. That's a peculiar property
that Dink Tempelton has, his being
able to come through with a track
team year after year, even in the
seasons when nobody will concede
him anything.
