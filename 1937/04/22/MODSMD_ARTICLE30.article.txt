### 
One rather amazing performance j
was turned in by a frosh trackman on
Tuesday afternoon in the last stren- |
uous workout of Bill Ellington's Pap- 1
ooses before they test their mettle '
against A1 Ragan's California year
lings on Angell Field tomorrow after
noon.
Russell (Howling) Wulff caused the
spectators that perpetually hang <
around freshman practice sessions to !
open their eyes a little wider when he
cleanly cleared the high jump bar at
6 feet 2 inches, thereby equaling the
"Little Big Meet" record for that
event.
Coach Bill Ellington has made ten
tative plans to switch Big Bill
(Roble) Doble to the lung-punishing '
2-mile event. A worthy successor to
last year's fighting little "Workhorse"
Emmanuel, Big Bill started the sea
son as a quarter miler, ran the 880
during the greater part of the season,
had run the mile in prep school.
