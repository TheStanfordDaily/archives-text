# Chappie Blasts Warfare Today
## 
### 
With peace rampant from cover
to cover, Chaparral will appear to
day in post-office box, Union cigar
counter, English and Engineering
Corners.
Throughout the issue there is a
bountiful supply of anti-war propa
ganda. On every page appears an
illustrated foot-note announcing the
death and burial-under-a-cross of
some dear friend.
Also in today's issue, the "NOW
that" column dedicates itself to
peace, while many drawings are
done with anti-war inspiration.
Dave Leff, he of the inimitable style,
has written. "Saga of the Cinders,"
an amusing poem which is illustrat
ed by Ken Overturf. In another sec
tion, spring, which is here now, is
poetically satirized by Harrison
Stephens.
This issue of Chappie displays a
slightly new masthead. The elements
are used, but the whole set-up is
smaller, with the contributors list
and Hammer and Coffin shifted in
position. ;
