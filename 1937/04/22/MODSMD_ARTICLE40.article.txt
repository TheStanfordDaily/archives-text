# Dear God ...

Dear mr. peace god:
Enclosed herewith, old fellow, is some
thing I thought you ought to see. It's a letter
written by one of the smarter guys around
Stanford. It goes like this:
The Editor, Sir:
What a bunch of yellow-bellied sissies there are around
here! These peace-day advocates are getting away with
their smug, cocky propaganda, and not a man has raised
his hand in counter-demonstration.
If only we could park a tank in front of the Assembly
Hall this morning! If only we could hang a banner,
"Fight for your country, you yellow !"
Let's stop this subversive peace grut and be men. Take
life as it comes, war, conflict, or what have you! And
make the women shut up!
Peace day doesn't do a damn bit of good, so why
run off at the mouth?
Yours for counter-demonstration.
"Disgusted by Campus Adolescents"
I hope you won't mind my throwing a wet
blanket on your big day, but that letter has the
same blood-shot hysteria that sent you scut
tling to Atlanta in 1917.
If you don't mind my saying so, it's just an
other indication that you haven't a chance. And
I don't mean the usual guff about the inevita
bility of war on sociological and economic
grounds.
I mean the inevitability of people being sin
cere jingoists. You probably know by now that
it's easy to spot the professional rabble-rousers.
They always yell a bit too loud, and sharpen
their claws too fine.
But the guy who wrote the letter—he's an
animal of a different phylum; you might call
him an intellectual invertebrate.
You may not know it, but he really believes
(at least he did when he wrote his letter) that
it's better to have no belly at all than a "yellow
belly."
The fact that personal irritation with the Peace
Committee inspired the letter occurs to me when
I read it, but it might not occur to you. You
might actually think he wants the bands to play
and the boys to march.
The man who wrote the letter is dangerous.
He ought to be put away until he can think as
well as he writes.
But that isn't going to help you, old fellow.
There are too many others just like him who
write a bunch of words as emotional relief
instead of swearing under their breath and
counting ten.
We've all done that kind of writing. But it
seems too bad that such undisciplined out
pourings will help finish you off—when the
finishing time is ripe.
I hope this letter won't sour your fun. But if
you're as wise a bird as I think you are, you
don't take too much stock in organized peace
anyway.
I always imagine you feel like the favorite
son who knows he will be nominated on his
delegation's first ballot. He hopes with all his
heart that a miracle will make him the conven
tion choice. He even works for the honor.
But he is dreadfully sure that he will be
beaten on the second ballot when the boys start
booming the big gun.
Sincerely,
Bob Eisenbach
