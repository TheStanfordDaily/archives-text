# Make It Castoria

### 
WHEN Ex Committee finally decided that
the only medicine within its means for cur
ing the campus' social ills was a Union Nitery,
someone—it may have been Franich—saw a
skull-and-cross-bones on the bottle.
Rather than cure the ailment, he said, this
new medicine would kill the patient.
For a long time it looked as if he'd guessed
pight. A Union Nitery would not be, really, a
nitery. It would be more of a social room for
newspaper reading and bull sessioning. Maybe
on dull week-ends (of which there are remark
ably few spring guarter) a few couples would
drop up to dance. But it would certainly be no
night club. What it would lack was "atmos
phere."
It still lacks "atmosphere." There's nothing
inherently romantic, or exotic, or tantalizing
about the A.S.S.U. lobby. Some questionable
artistic sense, to be sure, has tinted the walls a
lurid pink. But the fact remains that the fur
nishings, when they arrive sometime "soon,"
will not in themselves make the Nitery a suc
cess.

Appointed to the new Nitery Board this week
were four efficient "activity" students who may
or may not have the ability to turn castor oil
into Castoria. The ingredient they will most
need is, of course, showmanship. Not perhaps
the spectacular Billy Rose "Jumbo" brand, but
showmanship just the same.
If they can create a "feeling," a "spirit" that
will dispel the pink-walled dullness of that
lobby as it is, they will at least partially cure a
social ill from which this campus has long been
suffering. —D. B.

At ten o'clock this morning Stanford will
hold its Peace Day Assembly—peacefully.
In other universities, peace has too often been
confused with war. Riots, strikes, placard pa
rades and phony demonstrations have been
typical.
Stanford is not a typical university. Which
is reason enough why it will not tolerate such,
typical piddling.
This is not a Field Day for those who want
their own kind of peace.
This is Peace Day.
