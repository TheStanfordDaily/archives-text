Siiiiii yulcnt Night, bang bang,
Hoooooouly Night, knock, knock
All is Caaaaalm unism

The news that the Golden West kept the Golden
Gate Bridge in suspension yesterday afternoon, recalls
a story that unfolded itself not so long ago.
The American Society of Mechanical and Method
ical Engineers held its annual confabulation on the
campus a couple of weeks ago. As a special feature of
the convention the engineers adjourned to San Fran
cisco where they were to interview the Golden Gate
Bridge and take a perspective at Joseph B. Strauss, its
famed and far-flung engineer.
As they waited by the contract bridge for the
famous builder to show his hand, they speculated as
to what manner of scientist he would be. As he arrived
abruptly in a snappy-looking roadster with a snappish
looking blonde, their fears were laid to rest, but their
speculations were only heightened at the ponderous
orange-colored magazine he carried under his arm.
Close inspection on the pvart of Stanford's under
graduate technicians disclosed the fact that the maga
zine was "Popular Mechanics.''
The boys at the boathouse are all swimmers. They
swim in Encina pool, in Lagunita, and in Econ 1.
But that isn't enough; one dark night not long ago
they all divested themselves of raiment and plunged
into the women's pool. The sissies.
Bean Day, Labor Day, Peace Day, and Friday,
thank God.
