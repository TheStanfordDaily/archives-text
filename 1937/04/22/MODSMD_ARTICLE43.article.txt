# BULL SESSION
## THE 						PEACE THAT PASSETH UNDERSTANDING 
### 
IVfOVING up their heavy artillery, the A.S.U., left
wing lucifers to the Stanford peace angels, re
cently laid down a barrage of green pamphlets aimed
at the members of the Public Exercises Committee.
Ostensibly intended to keep apathetic roughs from
sleeping through the assembly today, the manifesto
rather resembled the dyspeptic grousing of a discon
tented freshman. But when it fell back on cliches it
voiced one or two sentiments often expressed by
students.
While the bray of the A.S.U., loud though it is,
cannot be taken as the voice of anything in particular,
the "green grouch" does illustrate a very common
attitude. Supporting its demand for complete student
control of the peace campaign, it cites as its reason
the "war record of the university administrations, which
without exception, devoted themselves to perverting
education to the cause of mass murder."
This statement, euphoniously melodramatic, ex
presses the ideas of many of our "young intellectuals."
Priding themselves on original thinking, these embry
onic geniuses find it thrillingly daring to place a blan
ket rejection on the statements of all authorities. Ac
cording to their lights, an intelligent man who believes
what a professor says is as unthinkable as a poet who
regularly gets a hair cut, or a bank president who can
reach his own shoe laces.

such brilliant, intellectuals ever bother to come
to college is a mystery the answer to which is
known only to God, the wrathful God who guides them
to our college.
One woud think that they would hate to give up
four years of glorious back-patting among themselves
to associate with poor fools who believe that a man
who has devoted his life to a subject probably knows
something about it.
It is sophomoric to rail at the American colleges
for giving their support to the last war. With the
nation worked up to the point of hysteria, no institu
tion could conceivably have kept out of the line-up,
and if it had, the popular reaction might well have
destroyed it.
The only reason why our apprentice soap-boxers
did not lose their heads in the confusion of the World
War is that they were then far more interested in
milk and teething rings. And incidentally, is it so
terrible a sin for a college to support, its country once
a war is undertaken; is it reprehensible to finish a
thing after it is started?

|F, however, it. is childish to hurl smoking adjectives
at the universities for their "perversion" during the
war. one rather wonders what terms could be used to
express the I.Q. of a man who looks upon his profes
sors today as directly subsidized by the devil, who
detects vicious propaganda in their every statement.
Faculties are made up of cultured, well educated men,
whose minds are carefully trained for objective judg
ment. If such men are not better balanced mentally
and emotionally than puerile "thinkers" who scorn
them, our whole system of education is based on a
fallacy.
The student comes to college, presumably, for guid
ance and instruction. When he rates his own ability
higher than that of the professors, he makes his pres
ence at the University pointless.
For the A.S.U., then, we would suggest as a coat
<>f arms: Futility rampant on a field of Frustration.
