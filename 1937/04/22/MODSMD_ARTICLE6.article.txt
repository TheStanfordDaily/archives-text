# Robleites Will Sell Tags To 'Keep Them Smiling'
## Set 2,000 Mark in Drive For 'Kiddies' Kitty' 
### 
"Oh, who will buy my violets?
Oh, who will buy my tags?"
This morning as the quad rings
with this plaintive cry, 50 of Roble's
most "terrific" coquettes will roam
from class to class selling tagsâ€”the
proceeds from which will go to the
kitty for the kiddies.
Sold at a minimum price of 10
cents, the tags will bear the slogan:
"Keep Them Smiling."
Kay Thompson, chairman of Stan
ford's premiere Tag Day, promises
to continue the sale until 2000 tegs
have been sold. "Anybody," she
says, "who doesn't help the con
valescent kids this much is a heel."
Meanwhile, Labor Day arrange
ments went off with a bang. Fol
lowing heavy manual labor at the
home, the campus enjoyed a well
prepared barbecue, and excellent
entertainment wiih Bob Mallett as
M.C. The day's climax came with
a two-hour jolly-up in the Pavilion
followed by the ping pong tourna
ment finals, which featured the vic
tories of Belle Bundle and Malcolm
Black.
Prizes which were distributed to
the two winners as well as six run
ners-up includc: two pairs of ten
nis shorts donated by Roos Broth
ers, a polo shirt from Phelps, a
shampoo and finger-wave from the
Roos Brothers beauty shop, a pho
tograph by Maxine Kellog, and
stockings from Alma Walker.
Drive funds continued to mount
yesterday as the ping pong tour
nament managed by Alan Oddie
and Jayne Copp cleared $80 and
Labor Day concessions managed by
Peg Woodard made $42 for the home.
This brings the total so far col
lected to 54780.
