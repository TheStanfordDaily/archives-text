Tt happened in Salem, Mass., on Februrary 12, 18 <7. Hie
young reporter attended a demonstration of inventor Bell's
new telephone â€” then "talked" hi 9 story to his paper in
Boston by telephone!
Though he didn't realize it, he was inaugurating a new
era in journalism. For today's newspapers eould hardly exist
without the telephone.
Gathering and spreading news with lightning speed is just
one of the telephone's countless contributions to modern
life. And 300,000 Bell System people strive constantly to
make the service still better, still more useful.
Why not telephone home oftener?
Rates to most points are lowest after
/& \ 7 PM. and all day Sunday.
