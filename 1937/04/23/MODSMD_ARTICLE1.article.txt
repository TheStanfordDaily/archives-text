# Cards Tackle Bear Track, Ball Squads
## Indian Cindermen Picked As Cal Seeks Second Victory in 14 Years 
### WALT PETERSON 
It's the biggest afternoon in the
Stanford athletic year over at Ber
keley tomorrow as the Cardinal
trackmen take on California in the
annual dual classic at 2 o'clock on
Edwards Field, and the Stanford
baseball team takes up in its final
against the Bear nine right after
ward, right next door.
The 1936-37 major sports, of
which there are five, stand: football
and tennis to California, basketball
to Stanford, and baseball and track
to go over tomorrow. Get it? It's a
big day!
Flash in Pan Win
They wanted to find out last year
if the California victory of 1935 was
just a flash in the pan or the start
of a Bear victory cycle in the annual
Big Meets, and that's just what they
did find out.
Nobody knows yet whether the
Bears just rose for one year, or if
they showed signs in 1935 of a new
power in track. Their loss last year
might be assigned to the ranks of
just one of those things, and maybe
they're on theil - way back this year.
Cards Are Favored
However, with all the dope gradu
ally swinging to the Cards, making
the team that "didn't have a chance"
the favoriie over the "second-best
college dual meet team" in tjie coun
try, it would begin to appear that
perhaps that 1935 thing was just a
flash in the pan. It was the first
time in 12 years, that '35 victor, and
it was awfully hard to take it on the
chin again in '36,, so the Bears will
really mean everything they do to
morrow.
But that's just the Bears' side of it.
Tomorrow they will have to turn
down one of the toughest teams they
will have ever met. The score, no,
that won't be any landslide, but these
kids that came from no place to a
favored spot over the potentially
great Californians will be running,
jumping, and throwing their hearts
out tomorrow once again, just to
show the Golden Bear he still hasn't
a track team that can beat Dink's
boys. And you can't deny a track
team when it has the old Indian fire
and somewhere near an even break.
