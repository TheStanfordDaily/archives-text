I year's biggest campus party, winds up the 1937 Con
j valescent Home Drive.
Planned as a take-off on the English Coronation,

Masque Ball will be attended by Hitlers, Mussolinis,
Gandhis, and other world notables, by inhabitants in
all parts of the globe from Iceland to Ethiopia and

by all members of the kingV
household from the royal pastry
cook and upstairs maid to the prime

rulers for a night. The two will be J

prize, a free week-end for two at
the smart Ahwahnee Hotel in Yose- j
mite, to the holder of the lucky bid :
in a ticket drawing.
