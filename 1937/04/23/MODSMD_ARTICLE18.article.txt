Thermometer busting was
adopted by Stanford as a major
sport yesterday, as new contribu
tions rolled the total up to $5,405.
This amount is enough to operate
the home for 150 days.
Though this amount betters the
capacity of the thermometer, the
Drive is by no means completed.

King-Queen contest) was over
$7,000.
New amounts turned in yester
day were $209 from Bean Day, and
a record-smashing $231 from Tag
Day. In addition, campus and
