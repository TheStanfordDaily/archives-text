# Four Canneries Defy Unionists
## To Reopen Under Local Police Protection 
### 
STOCKTON, April 22 (U.R).â€”Four
canneries shut down by picket lines
of the Fruit and Vegetable Workers'
Union today defied unionists with a
statement they would re-open the
plants tomorrow and were relying on
local police assurance that "law and
order will be maintained."
The announcement, after a three
hour conference between cannery
operators and representatives of un
organized employees, marked the
apparent end of a truce called by
Governor Merriam in hopes of set
tling differences.
Meantime in Sacramento Governor
Merriam announced he will imme
diately appoint a committee to inves
tigate the strike situation in Stock
ton in compliance with a request
from the San Joaquin Central Labor
Council. The committee will include
vigilante activities in its inquiry, the
governor said.
Mr. Merriam asked all parties in
terested in negotiations to refrain
from interference with the opera
tion of the canneries "or any act that
will provoke further misunderstand
ing and possible violence during the
time the committee Is being ap
pointed and making such investiga
tion of the situation as may come
within its province."
