# Stanford Harriers Battle California Frosh Here Today
## Ray Brown and Dick Simpson Captain Ellington's Underdog Papooses 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Seeking to terminate a three-year losing streak, Co-captains Ray
(Mugsy) Brown and Dapper Dick Simpson will lead Stanford's freshman
cinder aggregation against A1 Ragan's California yearlings here on Angell
Field at 3:15 this afternoon.
On paper the meet belongs to the Berkeley Babes by margins of from
three to thirty points, as CoaCh Bill Ellington's Papoose proteges are woe-

t'ully we;ik in the distance races and 4
relay, while lacking depth in nearly I
every event.
Two of three upset performances I
on the part of a couple oi wily young j
Indians might possibly shake the j
baby Bears down from their preca- i
rious perch of pre-meet favorites and |
clear the way for a Redskin triumph.
Doble a Question Mark
One of the gentlemen whose per- j
formance today has Coach Bill El
lington's jaws working overtime in
an attempt to keep from swallowing
his time-worn cigar is Bill Doble,
"dark horse" entry in the two-mile.
Ellington's anxiety is justified, as
Doble has never run a competitive \
two-mile. The tall, long striding lad
may win his race, hopes to get a
second, and will probably be lucky
to place third in his first crack at the
eight-lap test.
Meanwhile Coach Bill will con
tinue to chew on his stogie and hope
that the kindness of fortune will
bring his team some points in the
two-mile.
Sparling to Sprint
Most prominent of the other so
called Indian "dark horses" is dash
man Ray Sparling. Ever since the
Western Civ Department sent his i
10-fiat-running-mate A! Curtis back .
to prep school to absorb a little more ;
of the mid-Mesopotamian cultural j
background, Sparling has been the j
sole upholder of Stanford's sprinting
superiority.
In the short dashes, California j
boasts of Elton Brombacher, a fly- i
ing phenom who has turned in times
of 9.9 and 21.6 in the 100 and 220
respectively. If Stanford's speeding
Sparling can out-gallop "Bromby" I
