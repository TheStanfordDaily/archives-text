# Stanford Harriers Battle California Frosh Here Today
## Ray Brown and Dick Simpson Captain Ellington's Underdog Papooses 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Seeking to terminate a three-year losing streak, Co-captains Ray
(Mugsy) Brown and Dapper Dick Simpson will lead Stanford's freshman
cinder aggregation against A1 Ragan's California yearlings here on Angell
Field at 3:15 this afternoon.
On paper the meet belongs to the Berkeley Babes by margins of from
three to thirty points, as CoaCh Bill Ellington's Papoose proteges are woe-

t'ully we;ik in the distance races and 4
relay, while lacking depth in nearly I
every event.
Two of three upset performances I
on the part of a couple oi wily young j
Indians might possibly shake the j
baby Bears down from their preca- i
rious perch of pre-meet favorites and |
clear the way for a Redskin triumph.
Doble a Question Mark
One of the gentlemen whose per- j
formance today has Coach Bill El
lington's jaws working overtime in
an attempt to keep from swallowing
his time-worn cigar is Bill Doble,
"dark horse" entry in the two-mile.
Ellington's anxiety is justified, as
Doble has never run a competitive \
two-mile. The tall, long striding lad
may win his race, hopes to get a
second, and will probably be lucky
to place third in his first crack at the
eight-lap test.
Meanwhile Coach Bill will con
tinue to chew on his stogie and hope
that the kindness of fortune will
bring his team some points in the
two-mile.
Sparling to Sprint
Most prominent of the other so
called Indian "dark horses" is dash
man Ray Sparling. Ever since the
Western Civ Department sent his i
10-fiat-running-mate A! Curtis back .
to prep school to absorb a little more ;
of the mid-Mesopotamian cultural j
background, Sparling has been the j
sole upholder of Stanford's sprinting
superiority.
In the short dashes, California j
boasts of Elton Brombacher, a fly- i
ing phenom who has turned in times
of 9.9 and 21.6 in the 100 and 220
respectively. If Stanford's speeding
Sparling can out-gallop "Bromby" I
. in both these events, Redskin hopes
| of victory will be accelerated.
Is Brombacher Unbeatable?
California's most competent quar
' ter-miler is likewise the versatile
! Mr. Br6mbacher, whose previous
i best time of 49.6 stamps him as an
| odds on favorite against Papooses
! Rockwell and O'Leary whose best
times are from two to three seconds
: slower than his. However, it remains
to be seen whether Brombacher can
run and win all three of the races
! in which he excels.
First honors in the 880 appear to
| be the property of Captain DeMott
| Modisette of California, who has
j bettered the meet record for his
! event by a full second already this
i season. Barney Ferguson is Stan
ford's best in the two-lap test, but
I does not appear to have quite the
| speed to catch the Cal captain.
Dick Simpson, smooth striding
I timber topping stylist and co-cap
i tain of the home boys, appears to be
a sure-fire winner in both high and
low hurdles. John (Klop) Stock of
Cal will be his chief competition, es
pecially in the lows. Simpson's run
ning mate Bill (Shamrock) Jess, a
pint-sized Irish lad, good for a
; second in the high sticks.
) Wulff Will Win
Best of a field of better than av
! erage high jumpers appears to be
| rosy-cheeked Russell Wulff, Stan
i ford's rubber-legged leaper. Having
j tied the Little Big Meet record of
ft. 2 in. in practice recently, Wulff
! is picked to out-jump Louis Smith,
I Cal champion, whose "ceiling" is
j just one inch lower.
Diminutive Ray Brown, field lead
er of the Ellington men, is the pros
pective victor in the broad jump, but
may have to extend himself to beat
I the equally, persistent "Louie" Smith
j of the Bear Babes.
The pole vault is a toss-up be
tween Lee of Stanford and McCar
thy of Berkeley, both of whom have
I gone 12 ft. 6 in. in previous com
petition this year. Discus honors are
securely stowed away by Stanford's
Sfan Andersen, who is 20 feet ahead
! of his closest rival, but who will
probably fall short of Pete Zagar's
| meet record of 151 feet.
All the remaining events — mile,
| .shot put, javelin, and relay — are
predestined—so say the prognosti
cators who study such things— to be
won by the California Cubs.
