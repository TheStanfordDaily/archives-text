## 
### 
Leading up to the Cal matches with a series of five decisive victories,
Stanford freshman tennis players closed their season Wednesday with a
7-2 loss to the Golden Bear yearlings.
The Frosh started their season on April 24 with a 5-4 victory over
Salinas Junior College, followed by a 7-2 win over Piedmont High netters.

Modesto Jay sees bowed to the#
Papooses with only one victory
against eight. Frosh followed with
a 5-4 win over San Francisco Jun
ior College.
Card yearlings won their fifth
toumey by an 8-1 score over the
San Mateo Jaysee aggregation. The
first five matches were played on
the Stanford courts.
Lloyd Gates, Dave Brock, and
Myron Folsom interchanged all sea
son at the top of the Frosh ladder.
Gates, the steadiest racketman on
the squad, was outstanding for his
forcing forehand and a skillful
backhand. Starting backcourt, he
seemed to depend on his forehand
to work his way to the net, where
he caused his opponents plenty of
trouble.
Fastest and best net player of the
Papooses was Brock, who proved his
ability by winning his first set
against Harmon of California, for- .
iner national junior champ.
Folsom, lanky freshman from J
Burlingame, was the hardest hitter i
of the squad, particularly when
serving the ball. He also stood out i
as a steady backcourt player.
Bill Jordan showed a forcing fore- ,
hand, as did Bruce Anderson. Jor
dan played almost entirely in the j
back court, while Anderson spent j
most of his time near the net.
George Taoka, short Japanese
netter and one of the fastest on the
squad, played a cutting game with a
good half-drive and exceptional
ability in returning the ball. Bob
Richardson relied on steadiness and
a hard service. Ken Koch and Jack
'Bates, who played mostly doubles,
also played steady games.
