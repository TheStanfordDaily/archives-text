## 
### 
I I
Ten years have elapsed since the
Stanford Frosh have taken a base
! ball series from California. In 1927,
the Papooses won two straight from
the Bears.
Since that time, with three excep
tion, Cal has waxed the Cards in
two straight games, a third game not
even being played. In 1929, the Pap
ooses won a game from Cal but lost
the other two. Also in 1931, and in
i 1935, Stanford managed to take one
J game, but as usual, the Cubs came
i through to win the other two games
j of the series.
This year's frosh team stands an
excellent chance of breaking the 10-
, year fast. Besides winning one and
! losing one to California, Stanford has
I defeated McClymonds, Oakland
| Tech, Lowell, Mission, San Mateo,
! and Palo Alto High Schols, and
i Menlo J.C., Castlemont, Commerce,
| Jefferson, and San Mateo J.C. have
triumphed over the yearlings
