# See Peace Objectively, Rowell Tells Students
## 
### 
4> Whilc England builds for a Caesar's peace, and war-makers rage across
the earth. American youth must abandon its beautiful sentiments and view
the problem of world pcace objectively," Chester Howell, editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle, told the Stanford Peace Day assembly yesterday.
He visions the college as a laboratory where this generation can consider
scientifically the problem of how to keep out of war. Youth, he said, must

observe things as they are, not
| facts to opinion and prejudice.
From the detached viewpoint,
Rowell found the prospect for the
world "dreary indeed." Pointing out
that every war has three stages,
preparation, fighting, payment, he
declared that we arc "already in
the third stage of the last war and
the first stage of the next one."
Scorns Legislation
He sees the world today organized
for war, just as it was organized for 1
pcace at the close of the last great
conflict. "The democracies we set
up have fallen before dictatorships
beside which the Germany of the
Kaiser was a free country. Nations
have been regimented into compul
sory ignorance until we know what <
is going on in Germany and Italy
better than they themselves." i
Scorning current neutrality legis- ;
lation, he assailed Congress for pass- j
ing laws which "commit us to sup- ]
port the side with the largest navy, ,
regardless of right or wrong." He (
considers, co-operation with the ]
League of Nations, or some similar ]
body, the only way of avoiding an
other world conflagration. "We can
not depend on isolation," he said. ,
"We must consider what is our part |
in keeping the next war off the f
earth." c
Following Rowell, Irvin Jorgcnsen, t
ex-editor of the Daily, declared that
emotional appeals for peace are not
fuitle. Academic study is logical, he i
said, but the world is not logical, I
and war has no logical basis at all.
"It's going to be our war, and we've 1
got to stop it," was his assertion, j J
Emotions can be trained, he said,
and we must use ours to fight as a
vested interest.
