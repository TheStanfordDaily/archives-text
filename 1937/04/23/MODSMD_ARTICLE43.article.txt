# Templeton Figures Relay as Deciding Race in Big Meet
## Coaches Are Confident; Hamilton Needs Second Places To Win 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Even-steven they line up for the Big Track Tussle tomorrow afternoon
in Berkeley, as coaches of the two squads swagger around with airs of
confidence and backers of the two squads do likewise, only to bite deter
minedly on fingernails when other hacks are turned.
Because, in addition to the fact that it's the Big Meet, where any
thing goes and everything screwy usually does happen, the thing is

going to be hard to win. Brutus
Hamilton frets that it depends on
his second place guys who haven't
shown much to date, while Dink
Templeton says "We're going to need
that relay.
Eyes on Anderson
In the sprints all eyes will rest on
George Anderson, California phe
nomenal who is just coming back
after a year's lay-off with a bad
knee. Stanford's Kneubuhl, ham
pered with colds and things all win
ter, Captain Mushy Pollock of Cal,
together with Frick, Trumbly, Ca-

rew, and Hiserman all form a bri
gade any member of which could
win without surprising the i*ailbirds.
As things stand now. Jack Weiers
hauser, versatile Cardinal, will en
ter the quarter with Ray Malott to
form a more formidable wall against
the attack of California's Miller and
Watts. Captain McCurdy of Stan
ford also may enter, as may Archie
Williams, dusky California Olympic
Champ who has been hampered with
a pulled tendon for weeks; time only
will tell.

Half Is Toss-up

Captain McCurdy of Stanford and
Elton Wieman of Cal both have
marks of 1:53.9 in the half this sea
son, while Carl Mahurin has beaten
McCurdy several times. The 880
Saturday, if anything, should lift the
customers out of their seats.
Bob Alexander of Stanford defi
nitely will enter the mile, the first
event of the afternoon, and will have
his hands full in trying to beat Bob
Heavy of Cal, who turned in 4:22 last
week. The meet record of 4:20.2 in
this event is in as much danger as
any during the afternoon.
Mehlcrt Favored
Chuck Mehlcrt of California, after
a brilliant early season career, is the
long-ender in the two-mile run, if
he isn't juggled into something else,
while Stanford's White Hope Ed
Burrows, still in a rut caused by a
broken ankle last fall, can do any
thing from the ridiculous to the
sublime. Beman of Stanford won't
enter, having a sore leg, so Bob Al
exander and Rusty March, if he
enters this, will cope with the vet
eran Les Voorhies for secondary
honors.
Weiershauser is expected to breeze
through the lows to win if he isn't
too tired from doubling up, but the
high*' will be a race between Greg
Stout of Cal and Hewitt and Haw
kins. Hawkins was a fifteen flat man
but has had a sore leg for a week;
Hewitt is slower but has been im
proving this week and may sur
prise.
Weight Corps Tops
Stanford's weight corps of Rey
nolds, Gribbin, Hershey, Montgom
ery, Zagar, and Arnold Cornett, a
new entry from yesterday's prac
tice, should be unbeatable in the
.shot and discus, though California
has some entries named Hankey and
Burr.
The javelin may fall to lesser
names with leaders Sh?.w and Leh
man both protesting sore arms, but
javelin throwers always have sore
arms. Keith Monroe (C), and Gill
and Boore of Stanford all are toss
ups in the pole vault.
Jacques Holds Record
California's Jacques is highest on
record in the jump, having gone up
to 6-5, but Irk Morrison has been
known as a guy who goes up when
the necessity goes up. Guy Manuel
of Cal has the best mark in the
broad jump, is mentioned by the.
know-it-all boys ahead of Leo Mad
lem, Stanford's best. Arnold Nut
ting, former Cal leader, is out of the
meet, with a pulled muscle.
The relay, if it turns out to decide
I lie meet, will be a classic, if the
hoys who have doubled up can still
stand.
Tickets will be on sale at the gate;
Stanford will occupy the west side
of the field.

customers out of their seats.
Bob Alexander of Stanford defi
nitely will enter the mile, the first
event of the afternoon, and will have
his hands full in trying to beat Bob
Heavy of Cal, who turned in 4:22 last
week. The meet record of 4:20.2 in
this event is in as much danger as
any during the afternoon.
Mehlcrt Favored
Chuck Mehlcrt of California, after
a brilliant early season career, is the
long-ender in the two-mile run, if
he isn't juggled into something else,
while Stanford's White Hope Ed
Burrows, still in a rut caused by a
broken ankle last fall, can do any
thing from the ridiculous to the
sublime. Beman of Stanford won't
enter, having a sore leg, so Bob Al
exander and Rusty March, if he
enters this, will cope with the vet
eran Les Voorhies for secondary
honors.
Weiershauser is expected to breeze
through the lows to win if he isn't
too tired from doubling up, but the
high*' will be a race between Greg
Stout of Cal and Hewitt and Haw
kins. Hawkins was a fifteen flat man
but has had a sore leg for a week;
Hewitt is slower but has been im
proving this week and may sur
prise.
Weight Corps Tops
Stanford's weight corps of Rey
nolds, Gribbin, Hershey, Montgom
ery, Zagar, and Arnold Cornett, a
new entry from yesterday's prac
tice, should be unbeatable in the
.shot and discus, though California
has some entries named Hankey and
Burr.
The javelin may fall to lesser
names with leaders Sh?.w and Leh
man both protesting sore arms, but
javelin throwers always have sore
arms. Keith Monroe (C), and Gill
and Boore of Stanford all are toss
ups in the pole vault.
Jacques Holds Record
California's Jacques is highest on
record in the jump, having gone up
to 6-5, but Irk Morrison has been
known as a guy who goes up when
the necessity goes up. Guy Manuel
of Cal has the best mark in the
broad jump, is mentioned by the.
know-it-all boys ahead of Leo Mad
lem, Stanford's best. Arnold Nut
ting, former Cal leader, is out of the
meet, with a pulled muscle.
The relay, if it turns out to decide
I lie meet, will be a classic, if the
hoys who have doubled up can still
stand.
Tickets will be on sale at the gate;
Stanford will occupy the west side
of the field.
Even-steven they line up for the Big Track Tussle tomorrow afternoon
in Berkeley, as coaches of the two squads swagger around with airs of
confidence and backers of the two squads do likewise, only to bite deter
minedly on fingernails when other hacks are turned.
Because, in addition to the fact that it's the Big Meet, where any
thing goes and everything screwy usually does happen, the thing is

going to be hard to win. Brutus
Hamilton frets that it depends on
his second place guys who haven't
shown much to date, while Dink
Templeton says "We're going to need
that relay.
Eyes on Anderson
In the sprints all eyes will rest on
George Anderson, California phe
nomenal who is just coming back
after a year's lay-off with a bad
knee. Stanford's Kneubuhl, ham
pered with colds and things all win
ter, Captain Mushy Pollock of Cal,
together with Frick, Trumbly, Ca-

rew, and Hiserman all form a bri
gade any member of which could
win without surprising the i*ailbirds.
As things stand now. Jack Weiers
hauser, versatile Cardinal, will en
ter the quarter with Ray Malott to
form a more formidable wall against
the attack of California's Miller and
Watts. Captain McCurdy of Stan
ford also may enter, as may Archie
Williams, dusky California Olympic
Champ who has been hampered with
a pulled tendon for weeks; time only
will tell.

Half Is Toss-up

Captain McCurdy of Stanford and
Elton Wieman of Cal both have
marks of 1:53.9 in the half this sea
son, while Carl Mahurin has beaten
McCurdy several times. The 880
Saturday, if anything, should lift the
customers out of their seats.

ups in the pole vault.
Jacques Holds Record
California's Jacques is highest on
record in the jump, having gone up
to 6-5, but Irk Morrison has been
known as a guy who goes up when
the necessity goes up. Guy Manuel
of Cal has the best mark in the
broad jump, is mentioned by the.
know-it-all boys ahead of Leo Mad
lem, Stanford's best. Arnold Nut
ting, former Cal leader, is out of the
meet, with a pulled muscle.
The relay, if it turns out to decide
I lie meet, will be a classic, if the
hoys who have doubled up can still
stand.
Tickets will be on sale at the gate;
Stanford will occupy the west side
of the field.
