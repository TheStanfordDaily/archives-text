ent at the meeting from the Farm
will be Coaches Tiny Thornhill, â– 
John Bunn, Harry Wolter, B.A.C.
! Graduate Manager A1 Masters, and
Athletic News Director Don Lieben- i
dorfer.
Brick Morse will be the only Cali
fornia man present and has been re
ported to have been saving up for
i several weeks to down his tradition
al foes. The winner of the debate
will doubtless not be announced un
til tomorrow night.
