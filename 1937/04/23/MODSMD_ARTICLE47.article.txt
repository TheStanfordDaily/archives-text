# Polo Reserves Clash Today With Cadets
## Match Set for 3 o'clock, Highway Field; Southern Men Undefeated 
### 
Captain Haydon Grubbs' second
string Cardinal polo team will have
complete responsibility for the win
ning or losing of today's game with
Black Foxe Military Academy set to
begin on the highway polo field at
three o'clock.
Black Foxe has met the Indians
in polo for the past seven years but
has never yet managed to chalk up
a win. During the past two years,
however, the Southerners have been
gaining in strength, losing by 8-5
and 5-2, and this year they are .set
lo put up a stiff battle.
Undefeated So Far
So far this season they are unde
feated with eight wins to their credit.
Captain Grubbs, Card mentor, will
let the sccond team handle the match
as planned so the first squad will
not be in uniform. The Indian start
ing lineup will probably include:
Bert Hyde, No. l; Don McAusland,
No. 2; Bob Walla e, No. 3, team cap
lain; and Bert McClintock, No. 4.
Third team players who will see ac
tion if all goes well are Lloyd Brook,
Joe Hoenigsberg, Geoigc Keycs, and
Niel Schultz.
Seven Make Trip
Black Foxe has the players and
two coaches making the trip. The
players include Captain Chester
Foxe, John Girling, Jack Marshall,
Dan Fletcher, and Jim Henderson;
coaches are' George Pilkington and
Major Earle Foxe.
As is usual in collegiate games,
both teams will use the local's
horses dividing them into two strings
and trading groups at the end of the
half of the six-chukker game.
The match will begin promptly at
three o'clock and admission is free
to the public.
