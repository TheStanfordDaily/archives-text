# Frosh Diamond Men Meet Cal In Crucial Tilt
## Home Field Gives Farm Tossers Advantage In Third Game of Series 
### DAVE SWANBERG 
Freshman baseballers from Cali
fornia and Stanford will get together
for the deciding battle of their three
game series this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock on the Stanford Frosh dia
mond.
The Indians took the first game
from Cal two weeks ago in a
13-0 slugfest here, while last week
Stanford journeyed to Berkeley
only to be hit for a 14-11 defeat.
The fact that the Cards are play
ing on their own field should give
them a slight edge over their Blue
and Gold rivals.
If Stanford should be able to turn
the trick today, it would mark the
first series win since 1927. Last year
the class of 1939 pastimers were hu
miliated at the hands of Cal by huge
scores.
Co-coaches Bobby Grayson and
Harry Shipkey will likely start
either Gil Rahn or Norm Juney,
both southpaws, on the mound.
Juney started the last two con
tests with Cal, and in both in
stances was relieved by Rahn.
Since both men are valuable hit
ters, the one who doesn't start with
the pitching chores will play in
center field.
Either Ed Smith or Sid Lewis will
be behind the plate. The two have
shared this assignment throughout
the season. Lewis has caught both of
I the Cal games, however.
The infield will consist of John
Livermore at first. "Dee" DcLaucr
I at second, Dick Shortall, a player
slated to go places, at shortstop,
and Lew Stachlc, of basketball
fame, at third.

Besides Rahn or Juney in the out
field wll be Bill Willard in left and
either Paul Hartman or "Andy" An
derson in right field.
The Cubs will probably start
Henry Pruitt on the hill, although
in both of the previous games he
was driven to the showers by the
Card stickmen. Aaron Groper will
be held in reserve.
Next week the Frosh will practice
only three times a week and will
meet, with the varsity on the sunken
diamond. Grayson and Shipkey will
th*n. devote their talents over on
the other side of the fence, where
the football men are holding their
spring practice.
