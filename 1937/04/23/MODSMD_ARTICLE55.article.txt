# Bear—Card Ball Game to Decide Series
## Furman Ready To Hurl Third California Tilt Three Seniors, Johnson, Holman, Heagerty, To Start in Final Contest 
### 
With the burly Spike Furman set
to open on the mound for his third
attack upon the Golden Bear bats
men, Stanford's varsity baseballers
tackle the University of California
nine in the third and deciding same
of the annual Big Series tomorrow
afternoon at Berkeley, directly fol
lowing the Big Meet.
Not since 1931, when Dan John
son was hurling, have the Cards
been able to turn out a series vic
tory over the Bears. Having gained
a split with the Evans-coached
squad by virtue of an 8-3 win last
Saturday, after taking a tough 4-1
trimming two weeks ago, the Indian
deserve at least an even break in
pi tting odds.
Bears Seek Title
The game means the conference to
the Californians—they now hold a
tie for first place with U.S.C., and
a loss might throw them out of the
race. U.S.C. must defeat U.C.L.A.
tomorrow to hold its place.
Three seniors will bo among the
starters tomorrow, Verne Johnson,
center-field; Leo Heagerty, catcher,
and Captain Red Holman, first base.
A fourth senior, Ray Weiershauser,
will be held in reserve to replace
Furman on the mound if the going
gets too tough. In case McNeil starts
the pitching chores for California, in
place of Bill Priest, Glenn Hamilton
will probably play center-field for
Johnson.
Evans Worried
The same line-up which has
played both Bear games this year—
Heagerty, Furman, Holman, Tam,
Farrell, Linde, Coffis, Johnson, and
dcWitt, around the infield and left
field to right—will open tomori'ow
for the Indians. Meanwhile, Coach
Clint Evans juggles his outfit in an
effort to find a workable combina
tion that won't bow to Harry Wol
ter's men. The slightly jumbled
line-up so far announced is De-
Vaurs, cf; Koral, 2b; Chapman, ss or
If; McNeil, If or pit.; McNamara or
Winterbottom, rf; Grimes, 3b; Lom
bardi, cat.; McCaffrey or Humburg,
lb; and perhaps Priest as pitcher or
Dunlap as short.
Feature Indian players of this
year's series have been Jimmy Cof
fis, who broke into the regular left
field assignment with the first Cal
game and has been there since, and
Spike Furman. Coffis has collected
four hits in eight times at bat during
the two games, while Furman has
allowed only five earned runs in 18
innings.
