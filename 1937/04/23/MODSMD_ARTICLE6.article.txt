# Student Support Lacking in ASU Resolution Vote
## 
### 
Thwarted in their attempt to sand
bag through the Pcace Day assembly
a series of demands upon President
Roosevelt concerning world peace,
American Student Union represent
atives failed also to secure sufficient
student support in round-tables to
warrant forwarding the resolutions
to Washington.
Robert Mallett, chairman of the
meeting, ruled out of order a motion
suggested by an A.S.U. supporter
placing the gathering's mark of ap
proval upon the resolutions. Like*
wise an amendment opposing efforts
of Trotskyism toward a world revo
lution was ruled out at the assem
bly.
Text of the resolution follows:
"We, students of Stanford Uni
versity, assembled today as part of
the National Student Pcace Demon
stration, demand that the President
of the United States and Congress
take an unequivocal stand in support
j of the following resolution. We here
| by resolve:
"To oppose the excessive war
j budget of the United Slates Govern
| ment which represents a dangerous
j extension of militarism at the ex
i pense of socially constructive proj
j ects.
! "To demand of Congress the elim
j ination of compulsory military
; training in schools and colleges by
! the passage of appropriate legisla
! tion, such as the Nye-Kavelle Bill.
"To defend civil rights and aca
j demic freedom, because the sup
pression of these is the first step to
j ward fascism.
'"lo advocate genuine neutrality
I legislation to keep America out of
| war."
Brief summaries of round tables 1
j follow:
i War in Spain: Merely a Rehearsal
' for a Greater Conflict? Professor
Max Savelle. "The civil conflict in
Spain is not a war between Fas
cism and Communism," Professor
Savelle stated, "but one between re
actionary and aristocratic elements,
| represented hy the insurgents, and
i libra] and laboring elements, repre
i sented by the government."
| Will Fascist Imperialism Preeipi
: tate a European Conflict? Jean Pa-
I jus of U.S.F. "Where there are Fas
cist governments there will never
be peace," said Mr. Papus. "Euro
| pean powers must prevent Gei'many
j from attempting to acquire territory
purely on a basis of racial doctrine."
War in Asia, a Threat to the
World? Dr. H. 11. Fisher. The United
I States can best prevent war in the
Far East by promoting friendly rela
tions with the Orient, by repealing
j the exclusions act, and by avoiding
threats to Japan through a large
| naval program.
Economic Forces Driving toward
' War. Dr. T. 11. Boggs. Dr. Boggs

r cited four important incentives to
I imperialism: outlet for population,
.source of raw materials, markets, and
business investment.
'lhe Clash between Fascism and
Communism as a Cause for War.
Fasten Kothwell, Clive Warner, and
Emery Fast. The conflict between
Fascism and Communism is not a
cause of war. War is caused from
economic conditions underlying
them.
The Place of Christianity in the
Fight for Peace. Rev. Richard Sil
verthorn. "The Christ concept is in
compatible with war, [or tne king
dom of God is communion not only
with God but with one's fellow men."
The Individual and the War Psy
chosis. Richard LaPiere. War must
be treated as a form of mass in

sanity. The solution is individual im
munization to the insanity accom
panying war.
Can American Neutrality Save Us
from War? Philip Buck. Current
neutrality legislation will not keep
us out of war because it does nothing
to prevent war. Our economic and
diplomatic connections will entangle
u.s despite it.
Can Propaganda Lead the United ,
I States into Another War? l)r. Rus
sell Buchanan. Propaganda con
nected with emotion-stirring events
is likely to play an important part
in bringing the United Slates into
the next war.

pointed out by Professor Gibson: I
Change of labor's pacifsm from the â– '

cal type. "As World War evidence
shows, said Gibson, "radicals and
i radicals alone have a deep-seated
recognition of the futility of war."
Women and the .\e.\i War. Dean

little in a war without women who
