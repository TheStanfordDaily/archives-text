HUT IT'S ALL
GOOD STUFF
The official Stanford Daily Dope Sheet, so named because it was made
out by a bunch of dopes (beat you to it, youse guys, nyuh, nyuh), probably
won't even come close to having the right guys running the right races
Saturday, because the way Coaches Templeton and Hamilton are switching
their men around is a caution.
For instance, we plnci 1 Burrows third in the mile, and nobody knows
yet, not even Templeton, whether he's going to enter the mile. Neither
did we put Miller in the 880, hut Hamilton thinks maybe he will run
him in the half and maybe score some points. Of course, that's just his
view-point, because if he runs the 440 first, and he s the only quartei -
miler of any prominence Cal has, he won't he able to take third away
from Carl Mahurin. He'd have a terrible time taking it anyway.
Charlie Mehlert probably won't run the mile, but if he does he will be
right up there. And Ray Malott will give George Anderson or anybody
else just about all he can handle if Dink runs him in the 220.
Jack Weiershauser might stay out of the 100 and run the 440, and
then he will be right with Malott to give Miller a rough time.
However, our guess is as good as the next guy's as to who is going to
run what races—the only ones who should know are the coaches and they
probably can't make up their minds—so we will let the old sheet go as it is.
WELL,
MAYBE—
Over at Cal they are excited about this boy Bob Frlck, who ran a time
trial 100 in something like 9.8 or 9.9 Tuesday, second to Elton Brombaclver,
1 reshman. lie's had a lot of injuries the past two years and hasn't been
cut, but he did 9.6 to win the state prep meet two years ago.
He's in college now, though, and somehow there are an awlul lot. of
• uys in college who want to see a runner beat somebody before they think
l.e's a runner, honest-to-gosh.
OH, BOY,
CAN HE PICK 'EM!
Dink Templeton refused to make out a dope sheet for the Big Meet
tiiat we might run in the Daily, but that doesn t stop us from going back
to see what he did last year. And from a glance at his dope sheet of 1936
ii looks as though the Daily should have Wheedled him into making out
me, for fair, this year.
The Boy Coach picked 12 of 15 first places last year, with three clean
sweeps. He missed the javelin by calling the whi for Fink of Cal. because
Fitzgerald nosed out Br'er Fink. And he picked Wilson of Cal to beat
Ma diem in the broad jump, but Leo made that last great effort jump to
i urn down Wilson. Hum Smith was supposed to be a cinch for first
in the high jump, and that's how Dink had him picked, but the thing
wound up with Smith in an eight-way tie for first.
He called the 100 right on the nose, wiih Dean, Pollock, and Kneubuh!
r 'nishing in that order. The Klopstock-Moore-Kingsbury (inish in the high
hurdles and the Fi.shback-Moore-Klopstock final in the lows were the other
two personal triumphs by Massa Templeton.
The final score Dink picked was Stanford 79, Cal 52; but the actual
result was 75 ;I ,k-55%. Coming that close to a meet that could have been
victory one way or the other is pretty good picking.
HE HAS ANOTHER
YEAR, TOO
Fred "Spike" Furman, big right hander who has pitched swell baseball
in both of the Cal games this year, will tackle the Bears and Bill Piiest
again tomorrow, but this time it will be in the Bears' bailiwick. He had
a lousy first inning in the initial game, when they nicked him for four
runs, but the Californians were only able to bang out two more hits during
the game. #
In the second contest Spike handled the situation in fine style, allowing
only four hits, besides getting lots more support in the hitting end of the
game from his own team. If he gets the same sort of help tomorrow at
Berkeley, the Cards are going to knock California out of the lead in the
C.1.8.A., but that is inconsequential.
This is the last Big Game of the year, and it gives the Indians a chance
to win their first series since 1931. It's hard to lose five in a row, and it's
lots harder to lose six, so they'll be there trying tomorrow.

Berkeley, the Cards are going to knock California out of the lead in the
C.1.8.A., but that is inconsequential.
This is the last Big Game of the year, and it gives the Indians a chance
to win their first series since 1931. It's hard to lose five in a row, and it's
lots harder to lose six, so they'll be there trying tomorrow.

HUT IT'S ALL
GOOD STUFF
The official Stanford Daily Dope Sheet, so named because it was made
out by a bunch of dopes (beat you to it, youse guys, nyuh, nyuh), probably
won't even come close to having the right guys running the right races
Saturday, because the way Coaches Templeton and Hamilton are switching
their men around is a caution.
For instance, we plnci 1 Burrows third in the mile, and nobody knows
yet, not even Templeton, whether he's going to enter the mile. Neither
did we put Miller in the 880, hut Hamilton thinks maybe he will run
him in the half and maybe score some points. Of course, that's just his
view-point, because if he runs the 440 first, and he s the only quartei -
miler of any prominence Cal has, he won't he able to take third away
from Carl Mahurin. He'd have a terrible time taking it anyway.
Charlie Mehlert probably won't run the mile, but if he does he will be
right up there. And Ray Malott will give George Anderson or anybody
else just about all he can handle if Dink runs him in the 220.
Jack Weiershauser might stay out of the 100 and run the 440, and
then he will be right with Malott to give Miller a rough time.
However, our guess is as good as the next guy's as to who is going to
run what races—the only ones who should know are the coaches and they
probably can't make up their minds—so we will let the old sheet go as it is.
WELL,
MAYBE—
Over at Cal they are excited about this boy Bob Frlck, who ran a time
trial 100 in something like 9.8 or 9.9 Tuesday, second to Elton Brombaclver,
1 reshman. lie's had a lot of injuries the past two years and hasn't been
cut, but he did 9.6 to win the state prep meet two years ago.
He's in college now, though, and somehow there are an awlul lot. of
• uys in college who want to see a runner beat somebody before they think
l.e's a runner, honest-to-gosh.
OH, BOY,
CAN HE PICK 'EM!
Dink Templeton refused to make out a dope sheet for the Big Meet
tiiat we might run in the Daily, but that doesn t stop us from going back
to see what he did last year. And from a glance at his dope sheet of 1936
ii looks as though the Daily should have Wheedled him into making out
me, for fair, this year.
The Boy Coach picked 12 of 15 first places last year, with three clean
sweeps. He missed the javelin by calling the whi for Fink of Cal. because
Fitzgerald nosed out Br'er Fink. And he picked Wilson of Cal to beat
Ma diem in the broad jump, but Leo made that last great effort jump to
i urn down Wilson. Hum Smith was supposed to be a cinch for first
in the high jump, and that's how Dink had him picked, but the thing
wound up with Smith in an eight-way tie for first.
He called the 100 right on the nose, wiih Dean, Pollock, and Kneubuh!
r 'nishing in that order. The Klopstock-Moore-Kingsbury (inish in the high
hurdles and the Fi.shback-Moore-Klopstock final in the lows were the other
two personal triumphs by Massa Templeton.
The final score Dink picked was Stanford 79, Cal 52; but the actual
result was 75 ;I ,k-55%. Coming that close to a meet that could have been
victory one way or the other is pretty good picking.
HE HAS ANOTHER
YEAR, TOO
Fred "Spike" Furman, big right hander who has pitched swell baseball
in both of the Cal games this year, will tackle the Bears and Bill Piiest
again tomorrow, but this time it will be in the Bears' bailiwick. He had
a lousy first inning in the initial game, when they nicked him for four
runs, but the Californians were only able to bang out two more hits during
the game. #
In the second contest Spike handled the situation in fine style, allowing
only four hits, besides getting lots more support in the hitting end of the
game from his own team. If he gets the same sort of help tomorrow at
Berkeley, the Cards are going to knock California out of the lead in the
C.1.8.A., but that is inconsequential.

again tomorrow, but this time it will be in the Bears' bailiwick. He had
a lousy first inning in the initial game, when they nicked him for four
runs, but the Californians were only able to bang out two more hits during
the game. #
In the second contest Spike handled the situation in fine style, allowing
only four hits, besides getting lots more support in the hitting end of the
game from his own team. If he gets the same sort of help tomorrow at
Berkeley, the Cards are going to knock California out of the lead in the
C.1.8.A., but that is inconsequential.
This is the last Big Game of the year, and it gives the Indians a chance
to win their first series since 1931. It's hard to lose five in a row, and it's
lots harder to lose six, so they'll be there trying tomorrow.

HUT IT'S ALL
GOOD STUFF
The official Stanford Daily Dope Sheet, so named because it was made
out by a bunch of dopes (beat you to it, youse guys, nyuh, nyuh), probably
won't even come close to having the right guys running the right races
Saturday, because the way Coaches Templeton and Hamilton are switching
their men around is a caution.
For instance, we plnci 1 Burrows third in the mile, and nobody knows
yet, not even Templeton, whether he's going to enter the mile. Neither
did we put Miller in the 880, hut Hamilton thinks maybe he will run
him in the half and maybe score some points. Of course, that's just his
view-point, because if he runs the 440 first, and he s the only quartei -
miler of any prominence Cal has, he won't he able to take third away
from Carl Mahurin. He'd have a terrible time taking it anyway.
Charlie Mehlert probably won't run the mile, but if he does he will be
right up there. And Ray Malott will give George Anderson or anybody
else just about all he can handle if Dink runs him in the 220.
Jack Weiershauser might stay out of the 100 and run the 440, and
then he will be right with Malott to give Miller a rough time.
However, our guess is as good as the next guy's as to who is going to
run what races—the only ones who should know are the coaches and they
probably can't make up their minds—so we will let the old sheet go as it is.
WELL,
MAYBE—
Over at Cal they are excited about this boy Bob Frlck, who ran a time
trial 100 in something like 9.8 or 9.9 Tuesday, second to Elton Brombaclver,
1 reshman. lie's had a lot of injuries the past two years and hasn't been
cut, but he did 9.6 to win the state prep meet two years ago.
He's in college now, though, and somehow there are an awlul lot. of
• uys in college who want to see a runner beat somebody before they think
l.e's a runner, honest-to-gosh.
OH, BOY,
CAN HE PICK 'EM!
Dink Templeton refused to make out a dope sheet for the Big Meet
tiiat we might run in the Daily, but that doesn t stop us from going back
to see what he did last year. And from a glance at his dope sheet of 1936
ii looks as though the Daily should have Wheedled him into making out
me, for fair, this year.
The Boy Coach picked 12 of 15 first places last year, with three clean
sweeps. He missed the javelin by calling the whi for Fink of Cal. because
Fitzgerald nosed out Br'er Fink. And he picked Wilson of Cal to beat
Ma diem in the broad jump, but Leo made that last great effort jump to
i urn down Wilson. Hum Smith was supposed to be a cinch for first
in the high jump, and that's how Dink had him picked, but the thing
wound up with Smith in an eight-way tie for first.
He called the 100 right on the nose, wiih Dean, Pollock, and Kneubuh!
r 'nishing in that order. The Klopstock-Moore-Kingsbury (inish in the high
hurdles and the Fi.shback-Moore-Klopstock final in the lows were the other
two personal triumphs by Massa Templeton.
The final score Dink picked was Stanford 79, Cal 52; but the actual
result was 75 ;I ,k-55%. Coming that close to a meet that could have been
victory one way or the other is pretty good picking.
