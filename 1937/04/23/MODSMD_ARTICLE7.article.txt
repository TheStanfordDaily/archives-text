# Lines Modern In Chinese Play
## 
### 
When Dr. S. I. Hsiung, author of
Dramatic Council's spring produc
tion. "Lady Precious Stream," first
wrote the play, it was claimed that
this translation of an old Chinese
c'assic was a fake because of its
modern-sounding dialogue.
However, as the author says,
"such phrases as "pulling my leg."
"force majeure." and "breach of
promise" are as old as the moun
tains." These expressions were used
by such ancient writers as Confu
cius.
Dr. Hsiung is known as the "Chi
nese Shakespeare" for his transla
tions of the poet-dramatist into
Chinese, and has also prepared the
works of Shaw and Barrie for
Oriental readers. Reversing this
procedure, he made the translation
of "Lady Precious Stream" especial
ly for English-speaking audiences.
