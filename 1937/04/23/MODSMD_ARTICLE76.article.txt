lord University Press.
"The history," says Dr. Elliott,
"covers Stanford from its earliest
foundations til! the end of Dr. Bran
ner's administration. It is a very in
timate, almost the domestic story of
the University.
Mrs. Stanford's Work
"In it I tell of the great plan which
was its beginning, of the great hero
ism of Mrs. Stanford, her tremen
dous courage after Senator Stan
ford's death. It wa sshe wso man
aged "the finances. Dr. Jordan who
took the burden of the University."
Most difficult of all was the adap
tation of the great amount of mate
rial to the needs of a history of Stan
ford's early life, according to the
author.
Divisions of Book
At present, the book is in five
sections: the first deals with the
foundation, the reasons for Stanford,
and the labor of the founders.
Then there is a narrative of the
main events in both the academic
and student life. The third section
deals with the many and recurring
problems, in the financial depart
ment, with the faculty as in the
Ross affair, and in the charter which
had more than one defect to be bent
around to fit unalterable situations.
Major Problems
There were two major problems
which occurred all through this pe
riod, that of liquor and that of con
duct and discipline. These are
treated in their own sections.
The last division is concerned
with the University under the trus
teeship, from 1891 to 1916. and tells
of the attempts at reforming and
changing the set-up of the univer
sity.
The GOO-page volume is complete
with preface by Dr. Wilbur, an in
troduction by the author, and many
early pictures of the University.
