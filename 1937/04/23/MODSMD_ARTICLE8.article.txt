# Hedley Urges Will To Peace
## Speaker Explains Need Of Movement Unity 
### 
"We must build a will toward
pcacc," Dr. George Hedley, director
of the Workers' Summer School at
Berkeley, told a large crowd of
Peace Day luncheoners in the
Women's Clubhouse yesterday.
Totality of intent is essential to
the pcace movement, Dr. Hedley ex
plained as he cautioned pcace advo
cates against dissension in their
ranks over the means employed to
reach their goal.
Commenting upon the apparent
lack of interest among students in a
peace program, Dr. Hedley said,
"The movement means almost noth
ing with respect to the total mind of
the United States."
Objectives of the peace advocate,
he said, should be: First, to enforce
upon the public mind that it has
prejudices; and second, to be will
ing to pay the price of being in
formed through scientific inquiry.
"Free discussion is a basic neces
sity, but it must be predicated upon
a respect for facts," he added.
Dr. Hedley was introduced by
Peace Day Chairman Carolyn
Moore.
