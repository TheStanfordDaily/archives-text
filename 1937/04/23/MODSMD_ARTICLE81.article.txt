# Still "Killing the Hun"
## 
### 
While Stanford's peacemakers were yester
day exposing the "Kill-ihe-Hun" propa
ganda which sent America into European
conflict twenty years ago, a modernized ver
sion of the same subversive war-scare publicity
was preparing susceptible campus minds for the
next World War.
More polished but hardly less subtle than the
Allied and German "news" published in 1914-
1918, a new magazine called Photo-History was
grinding the Spanish Loyalists' axe over the
Union Cellar counter.
Ostensibly a pictorial revelation of "the forces
lying behind today's headlines," the magazine's
78 lurid pages were splashed with stock atrocity
pictures of raped women and slain children, raw
youths fighting for "Democracy against Fas
cism," slaughtered soldiers sprav/led across
shell-torn streets.
With propaganda such as Ihis, and its Fas
cist counterpart in the Hearst press, the next
World War has already been declared. The
difference between this one and the last is that
we are now, or should be, prepared to accept
such "atrocities" for what they are, the rancid
brew of partisan press agents.
When Communists exhibit as proof of Fascist
butchery identically the same photographs of
identically the same corpses that the San Fran
cisco Examiner and sister papers published a
few weeks earlier as proof of "Red maimery,"
the intelligent reader sees the rise of the most
potent war-magic of all, Propaganda.
Upon America's ability to withstand the
avalanche of up-to-date "Horrible Hun" propa
ganda—without breaking into the hysteria that
followed the same stuff two decades ago—de
pends our chance of escaping the coming
World War.—D. B.
Dear God:
That's All.
