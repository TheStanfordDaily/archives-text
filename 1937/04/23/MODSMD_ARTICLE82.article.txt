Perfect correlation ot rear wneels and front
pistons is what makes the modern auto run
smoothly.
Correlation of rear-guard business practice
and front-guard business theory may make the
American industrial machine rival the autos it
produces, besides giving a smoother economic
ride.
That's one way of interpreting the news that
twelve ranking California business executives
have been appointed advisors on the faculty of
the Stanford Business School.
Interestingly, it isn't the econ authorities who
are out to punch theory into the hard heads of
businessmen. It's just the other way around.
The money-makers are going to teach, not the
money thinkers.
Such turning of tables seems to be significant.
Not so many years ago, it was common for
theorists to lock themselves up on the third
floor of a Washington building and blue-print
the course of industrial America.
Today, at Stanford, some of those blue-prints
may be blue-penciled. For when twelve of the
best money-makers in the state get together
with the be-texted Stanford executive embryo,
something has to yield.
We hope both sides will give, or at least ap
proach within intellectual hailing distance.
If that happens there's a chance some of the
deadwood in both the practical and the theoreti

cal business mind is going to be burned

And American business, even if it finds no
solution, will find out whether there's any corre
lation at all between the wheels of our economic
machine, and its bobbing intellectual pistons.
They will find out whether it's the wheels
that get stuck, or the pistons that are misfir
ing—or whether maybe something else is
wrong—like a slipping clutch, that is interrupt
ing the even flow of credit-power from con
ceiving motor, through the transmission, along
the middleman connecting rods, to the differen
tial, and to you and me, at present blown-out
tires.
