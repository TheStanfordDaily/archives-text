# "Now This Timeâ€”

### 
It was just two years ago Monday that great
big tears rolled down the Stanford Daily edi
torial columns:
"A most pitiful display of Stanford student's
lack of enthusiasm and school spirit and the
disgraceful absence of any sort of a yell leader
or rooting section organizer was seen at the Big
Meet at Berkeley Saturday. Not a yell and
hardly a sound of encouragement was uttered
by Stanford rooters."
"California's student body rallied round in
front of the Cardinal section after their first
victory in 12 years, rooted, sang songs, and
waited expectantly for a Stanford response from
a rooting section which was discourteously
filing out.
"In desperation, or at least in sympathy, the
California yell-leaders turned around and led
Stanford in its own yells. Crowning disgrace
of the day .... was that the Stanford hymn
was not sung. The band did not play it or sound
a chord.
"Instead Stanford suffered itself to walk out
with hanging head and shamed face."
Tomorrow Stanford goes back to Berkeley,
sans hanging head and shamed face, but with a
new 1937 model track team, a small but potent
squad which can win the Big Meet from Cali
fornia's "second best track team in the country"
of early season.
Support would help. Don't make the same
mistake twice.
G.F.
