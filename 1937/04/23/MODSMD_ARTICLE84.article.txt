ONE Stanford Phi Bete in the embryo, repeatedly
and deliberately practices his dance steps, lines, ac
tions, ways to tie tics, etc. for (4) days before each
date.
As dancing consistently aggravates a latent infe
riority complex (some call it shyness), and as he is
possessor of the next best thing to a line, an accent,
those two are more characteristic than habitual. The
two remaining attributes, however, he gives full scope:
When one day his parents learned he was grown
up enough to find impei-ative use for a dinncr-coat,
they were surprised. He too was surprised, but he was
unprepared as well. He couldn t tic a bow. Not caring
to wear a foulard with his tuck, he upended a milk
bottle and tied round it a tie till he was fit to be.
Then he tried it on his neck. Results were acceptable
and bottle, the valet, was given honorable discharge
from a second story window.

r determined to earn at least a minimum wage
of sin. our socialite contemplative backed out the
family chariot and rode to a nearby shady lane, up and
down which he drove in all three speeds clutch with
his left foot, wheel with his left hand, gear-lever with
his right (foot).
Disastrous was the fact that, a leather sole tends
to rub off paint it contacts. A few Hays sufficed to
lay bare the steel rod for inches more than one.
Ere long the patriarch was driving in the car. So
to his son he said:
"If you must play Lothario, don't rowel the horse.
Or, more pertinently, while you're fooling with her
facc paint, look out for my enamel."
