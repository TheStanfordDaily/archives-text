STRICTLY PERSONAL

YESTERDAY the front page of The Daily looked
good and black for a change, with its 300-point
headline. It said that pcace had been declared, but
for the life of me I couldn't feel there was any peace,
cither in me or around me.
Everyone running around posting up placards,
working themselves into a dizzy sweat, papers full of
civil war threats in Stockton, strikes in Ontario, war
in Spain, Hitler, Mussolini, unemployed, and what
not, all in a stew about something.
In a stew because there is no such thing as peace.
* <l * #
T>ERSONS in the everyday walks of life find no
peace until they find it within themselves, so I
decided the best thing I could do to celebrate pcace
day was to try and find some salvation for myself,
not in crowded assemblies, or around tables, or at
two-bit luncheon tables, but at the beach.
Lying there in the sand with the wind whispering
through my hair, listening to the boom of the surf,
suddenly everything became very quiet and I knew I
had found peace.
With the sun gleaming on white sand and the music
of breakers in your ears, you become aware of the
intense smallness of yourself in respect to the world.
* * * *
think back over what you have read in the
morning papers and then listen to the sea for
awhile and you realize how foolish it is ever to get
stirred up over peace or war or anything else for
that matter. The world has existed for thousands of
years, just like this, you tell yourself, and it's good.
No strife, no discord, no cacophony, no nothing
except the timclessness of ljeginning and end, of liv
ing in the future and the past all at the .same time.
You arc immediately aware and unaware, thinking
and unthinking, .happy and unhappy, alone as a being
apart, able to find within yourself perfection.
Any time you feel like you do Peace Day, just sign
up for a trip to San Gregotio. There's nothing quite
like it.
