PEACE DAY'S COMMERCIAL j
WAR

The Editor, Sir:
Having just come from the Peace j
Assembly where crowd psychology !
was mentioned time and again as j
one of the great contributions to the
furtherance of war, I was confront
ed by a crowd of Stanford students, j
none of whom, apparently, rated the j
P*>ace Assembly as worthy of their
attendance.
The students, it seemed, were j
slanding around helping one Roble
student sell 10c tags for the Conval- !
escent Home drive. I have already
j contributed a cheek for $2.56 toward
the Home and would gladly give
more if I could, including the 10c for
the tag. As it happened, I didn't have
10c with me at the time I was ac- |
eostcd. I didn't think it was neces
sary to explain this to the group
and because I didn't buy a tag I
walked away to the accompaniment
of loud "boos" and cries of "cheap
skate" from my fellow students. As
any one can imagine, this was not a (
pleasant experience.
The incident, to my mind, is typ
ical of crowd psychology and its !
complete injustice and stupidity, i
Most Stanford students, had they '
been present, would have joined in '
the great furor of booing without
an instant's real thought as to wheth
er or not it was justified, just as
they would join in the great "hur
rahs" accompanying them to their
slaughter in times of war.
They are students spending their
parents' money learning how to be
come "good Joes" and neglecting
completely the development of the
progess of rationalization when it
comes to practical instances of ap
plication.
