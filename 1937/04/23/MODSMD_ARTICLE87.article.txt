The Editor, Sir:
The opinion of a visitor to your
campus could be of little value or
interest to ohe so sure of himself as
you. Aware of this, I have hesitated
to bother you with this note upon
your editorial addressed to the God
of War.
I should like to point out first
that your letter is based upon a
quibble. You find it paradoxical and
very amusing that these students,
devoted to peace as they arc, should
"fight" war. What would you advo
cate, that they "work against" war
or that they "conduct propaganda"
against war or that they "oppose"
war? It would all come to the same
thing, would it not? The point be
ing all the time merely to try to
reduce the possibility of war, i.e.,
violence, loss of life, and the de
struction of property. In the same
way we speak nowadays of "fight
ing" disease, unemployment, and
even stupidity, but we do not thus
imply taking up arms against dis
ease germs or those who do not
agree with us on the method 1o be
used in combating them.
Students' Side
Again you point out with a hardly
noteworthy astuteness that those
students put themselves "on the side
of the fencc they say stands for
peace."
Surely you would not advise them
to take the side they think stands
for war! Your criticism, to do it
justice, is, however, aimed at their
presuming to make a choice.
You add that they do not realize
that there are two sides to every
fence. To disagree with you again.
I should judge that they realize
more clearly than you do, not only
that there is a fence, but. also that
there are two sides to it.. You per
haps disagree not with the aims of
the group in question but rather only
with its methods. That is a matter

for each man to settle for himself. If i
you are of the opinion that there are 1
not two sides to the question of war
and peace, let me urge you to dis
abuse yourself of a false and com- j
placent sentiment. Certainly there
are two sides, for otherwise there
would not continue to be wars de
spite the reluctance of most com
batants to engage in warfare. Peace
does need fighting for, that is, "fight
in >" of this kind, which does not
involve bloodshed but only the ex
penditure of thought and energy. If
this kind of "fighting" antagonizes
those who approve of war (you
yourself mention some of them), is
the harm so very great?
Your introduction of the gibe of
Fascism Gibe
Fascism as represented by the Board
of Public Exercises seems to lie a
part of your cynical attempt to ridi
cule. Is it remarkable that this
group of students which has taken
the lead in presenting the problems
of war and peace should wish to ex
press itself on the type of meeting
held or the speakers invited to ad
dress them?
It is hardly commendable of you
to deride others for "fighting" for
their beliefs and for attempting to
learn more about a question which
seriously concerns them. You re
mark that you will probably be see
ing Mars, very likely a correct guess
I am willing to grant you. Still you
will not be able to console yourself
that you tried to keep the God away.
You will be able to remember only
[that you steadfastly refused to lake
! sides or to "fight" against his advent.
I hope you find comfort in your iso
| lation.
Very truly yours,
Daniel Stenton,
Amherst, '88
