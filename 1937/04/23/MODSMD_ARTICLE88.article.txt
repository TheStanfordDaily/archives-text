# MORE GUM FROM THE GHOST
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
| I take this means to protest
j against an article written in your
Wednesday's Daily in which I am
j credited with authoring a campus
I opinion entitled "Ghosted by Gum."
jl did not write the article, nor was
i it written with my permission, and
! I did not know that such an article
j was being written until I opened my
j Daily Wednesday morning and col
| lapsed face downward on the floor
jin front of the professor. I hope
you will print this letter to clear my
name in the matter.
Sincerely,
Larry Roublt Jorgensen
