# Bette Davis, Bogart Head New Classic
## 
### 
Marked Woman (Stanford Thea-
I ter) is the most potent .stuff we've
I seen in this town since "Winterset."
! It has the same tensity, to almost
| the same degree, that that classic
i had; but it is relieved enough to
; let you sit back and breathe every j
Iso often. Don't expect an easy eve- j
j ning, though. Bette Davis and
Humphrey Bogart head a cast giving
! clean-cut, sincere acting which is,
\ above all things, natural. Edouardo
j Cianelli cast. 1 : his sinister spell over
1 the picture; good support aids that
[ spell.
i The story is well - built, linas
I smoothly cast, and, while always
building toward climax, are not j
over - dramatic. It i.s excellently
written and directed. If the scene I
where Miss Davis is being beaten up
doesn't lift you right out of your j
seat, you better be psycho-analyzea.
If you actually saw, instead of heard, j
the scene, you probably would comc
| out of it gray-haired.
