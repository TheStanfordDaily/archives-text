# Work on Bowl, Theater Pushed
## Cubberley Job Concrete Pouring Delayed 
### 
Pressing construction on two jobs
| and slacking off on the other two,
i Stanford's busy building chief and
j Assistant Comptroller, Alfred Trow
bridge, is driving toward comple-
I tion of the outdoor amphitheater by
J Commencement time, and the Me
j morial Theater late in June.
Excavation is nearly finished on
j the Cubberley Education Buildirig
j but pouring of foundations will be
j delayed until next month.
Meanwhile all efforts are concen
i trated on the planting of the amphi
| theater. Seat terraces of wollman
i ized wood—processed for protection
j against termites and dry rot—were
| completed last week, and top soil
I will be filled in this week prior to
| turfing. Planting of the "natural"
stage is just getting under way.
j Lagunita's new wings, like the
j Cubberley Building which is ex
! pected to take a year in the build
! ing, are not being rushed since the
const ruction bosses feel that there
I will be adequate time for comple-
I tion by fall.
