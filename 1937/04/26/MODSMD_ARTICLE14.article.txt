VALENCIA, April 25 (U.R). â€”A
submarine, believed to be German,
attempted to torpedo the Spanish
merchant ship "Cyclopc" today while
the latter was midway between Va
lencia and Alicante.
The submarine appeared suddenly
on the surface opposite Calpe, be
tween the Cyclope and the Spanish
coast, and its officers ordered the
Cyclope to proceed to Palma de Ma
jorca, rebel base in the Balearic
Islands. When the captain refused
the torpedo was discharged.
