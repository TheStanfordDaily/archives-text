# Students Discuss Labor Problems
## 
### 
Twenty-five Stanford students
met yesterday afternoon in the "Y"
rooms to discuss "The Significance
of the C.1.0. and the Sit-down
Strikes." Professor Guido Marx,
engineering department, Hilden Gib
son, political science instructor, and
Charles Barker of the history de
partment, were the faculty leaders
of the discussion.
Sit-down strikes, the speakers
agreed, were in conflict with con
cepts of property rights. Jenny
Maytyas, San Francisco organizer of
the International Lady Garment
Workers, said that "if labor will
make the sit-down strike eftective,
it will be made legal."
Plans for the coming Western
Workers' Summer School, which will
be held in Berkeley, were outlined
by Frances Strong and Elizabeth
Lam, of the Y.W.C.A. Deadline is
tomorrow for applications for schol
arships from Stanford to the school,
she announced.
