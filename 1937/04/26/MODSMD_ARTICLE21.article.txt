DETROIT, April 25 (UP).â€”United
Automobile Workers and the new
American Labor League carried
separate appeals to the working

support in an impending test of its

swell its membership.
In a mass meeting, U.A.WA.

as sole collective bargaining agency
in an election to be conducted next
Wednesday under the recently up
held Wagner Labor Relations Act.
In another hall, Daniel M. Robins,
president of the A.L.L., and other
national officers explained the mer

less than 100 curious who ventured
to the mass meeting.
