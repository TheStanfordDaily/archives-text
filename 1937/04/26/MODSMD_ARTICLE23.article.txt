# Campi Mix Rules, Liquor
## 
### GORDY FROST 
At Stanford, mention the word
! "liquor" in the presence of the ad
ministration and you're treading on
; tissue.
At Harvard, drink what and when
i you like and charge cracked ice and
soda to the administration, which
! will quietly tack it on your term
bill.
The striking contrast was brought
out when the weekly newsmag
Time rolled onto the Farm last week
with a yarn concerning recent drink
ing regulations at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Liquor at Pcnn
According to Time, liquor has
' (lowed freely at Penn since Repeal.

Four fraternity houses have openly
cropped out with bars. A recent
questionnaire revealed that none of
the houses were dry.
So Penn's administration decided
to do something, levied a restriction
prohibiting drinking in the houses,
but at the same time promised no
raiding or snooping if bars and bot
tles were out of sight by spring.
Stanford's Rules
In connection with the national
problem of student drinking, it is
pointed out that of 581 United States
colleges, 436 forbid students drink
ing at all, 105 have restrictions and
only 40 have no special rule.
Citing an example of rigid restric
tion, Time says: "Stanford severely

j provides that 'the possession, trans
portation, or use of intoxicating
liquors ... in the university shall
be grounds for expulsion'." Harvard
is mentioned as perhaps the most
! lenient on the question.
Princeton, Yale Do
Drinking in rooms is not allowed
i at Princeton, and eating clubs have
ja gentlemen's agreement with the
l administration not to serve liquor.
At Yale, too, drinking in rooms is
forbidden, though "many Yale clubs
and fraternity houses have state
I permits for bars."
j Time reports the student taste:
'"Both men and women student
: drinkers prefer hard liquor to beer
about 2-1."
