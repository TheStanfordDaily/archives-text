# Capital Seeks Place on Board
## Industrialist Plan Would Revamp Wagner Body 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 25 (U.R).—
Industrialists seeking new safeguards
under the Wagner-Connery Act have
begun a quiet campaign for admin
istration support of a plan to give
business, labor and the public equal
representation on the three - man
board which administers the law,
it was learned tonight.
Under the present law there are
no restrictions on the
of persons chosen by President Roo
sevelt to serve on the board. Neither
Chairman J. Warren Madden, a for
mer college professor, nor his two
associates have had practical busi
ness experience. This fact is being
used as an argument by those striv
ing to revamp the agency now that
its wide powers have been upheld
by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The proposal has not yet been
made to President Roosevelt, it was
understood tonight. It has been
taken up, however, with several new
dealers and among them some of the
chief executive's labor advisers who
are reported to have received the
suggstion without much enthu
siasm.
