# Trackmen Score Surprising Total In Win Over Cal
## Margin Passes Predictions; Promises Close Meet with Troy 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Better than anyone thought possible was the score of 77 1-.'] to 53 2-3
rung up hy Coach I)ink Templeton's Stanford track team over California
in the traditional Big Meet in Berkeley Saturday. Dopesters had reck
oned the breaks every which way, and bad scored Stanford down anv-

♦where from fiSVa up to 75.
The score run up by Stanford—
incidentally just 1 2-3 points under
that done by U.S.C. over the Bears
two weeks ago—came principally as
a result of the high-point activities
of Ray Malott, Jack Weiershauser,
who set a new meet record in the
lows en route, Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, and the steady efforts of the
field men.
Malott Takes 220
Malott won both 220 and 440 in
21.6 and 48.1 together with a lap on
the 3:17.6 relay team, while Weier
shauser was second in the 440 and
, ran 23.2 in the lows, three-tenths
under Podge Smith's former meet
mark. McCurdy made 6V4 points by
winning the half and part of the
I relay.
, Deserving of mention from the
afternoon's proceedings are: Bill
Hawkins, who was way out in front
i in the highs (which were on in 14.9)
before he hit a hurdle and fell. Al
exander's 4:20.9 in the mile, one of
the finest times ever made by a
Stanford man. Mahurin's second in
the 880, way ahead of California's
Wieman, who was supposed to have
) been out of his class.
Weightmen Shine
The work of the weightmen, who
| permitted no California man even to
qualify in either event. Gribbins'
151-9 discus mark is one of the best
i in the country this year; even Ar
; nold Cornett, who was entei'ed 36
hours before the meet, sneaked in
; for a third.
Jack Carlson came through with a
surprise 190-3 for a second in the
javelin, after California had three
| men ahead of him, by far his best
throw. Boore and Gill placed first
1 and third in the pole vault, the first
| decent Stanford score in a Big Meet
! since Deacon left. Rusty March's
third in the mile, after a year work
ing in Paly trying to get back in
! school to compete.
Burrows Clicks
' Ed Burrows back in the public
eye again, way ahead on the last lap
j of the two-mile, but feeling a little
S too good for his condition; Ick Mor
rison over 6-3 once more, and the
two places each from Hewitt and
Carew, all denoted steadiness of
performance and competitive spirit.
Dink Templeton, then, it is
agreed has a track team. The know
it-all-boys are going to cross them
selves goofy trying to call the next
one, U.S.C. here on May 8.

few Stanford fans at that Cal game
Saturday, and they saw how a set of
bleachers can be filled. At Berkeley
they don't just fill the bleachers for
a Big Game in baseball, they sit on
the grass on both sides of the bulg
ing seating space.
We had two of the Big Series on
the Farm this year, and did we fill
the bleachers either time? I'll say
we didn't. That sun isn't any harder
to look at down here than it is up
there, and there were plenty of the
faithful squinting out at the players
up there.
I don't want to complain, you see,
but I'd just like to have you see
what can be done.
