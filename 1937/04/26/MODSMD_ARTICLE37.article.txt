"SECOND BEST."
NOW "FOURTH BEST"
There's been a lot of water under
the bridge since they said Dink
Templeton didn't have a track team,
months ago, and Saturday he put
out on Edwards Field a bunch of
kids that had enough heart, enough
of the old fire that makes Stanford a
little bit better when the going's
tough than California, to make the
railbirds eat their words.
Cal had a great newspaper team,
until they lost three meets in a row.
And it would have taken more than
Archie Williams and Arnold Nut
ting Saturday to turn down the
Cards, they were just that good.
But that's another Big Meet won
and gone, and now Dink's boys have
to point for the all-important U.S.C.
meet this week-end. There probably
isn't a sport writer on the Coast who
will pick Stanford to beat the Tro
jans, and rightfully so, but one thing
is certain now. Dean Cromwell is
going to know he's had a track meet
Saturday afternoon. There is a slight
possibility, and we admit it still
looks slight, that Stanford will beat
Ihe Southern Californians, but if the
Cards lose it won't be because they
haven't enough fight.
If there are any of the track men
who get nervous and jittery and
;ifraid of how they're going to run
Saturday, let them remember the
races run by Bob Alexander, Rusty
March, Bill McCurdy, Carl Mahurin,
Dick Carew, Johnny Hewitt, and
best of all Ed Burrows, among all
the others. There are several not
named in that list—Ray Malott, Jack
Weiershauser, et al — who ran ter
rific races; and there were several
field event men who came through
in grand style, Carlson particularly,
any one of whom might give plenty
of inspiration to jumpy kids who
think they can't handle the mighty
Trojans.
THEY SAID lIE
COULDN'T DO IT
Special mention should be ac
corded Ed Burrows, the old cripple j
who didn't have enough condition or
fight or anything else this season to I
get out of his own way, until Big
Meet. One of the finest competitors
this or any track team has seen,
wobbly but effective Ed stayed right
with that Cal gang — five runners
against him, altogether—until he had
the dopesters talking to themselves.
To illustrate my ponit, let me
quote a remark by Don Liebendorfer
just before the race began. "We will
be lucky," said Don, "if we get a
point for third in this race, and if
we do it will be scored by Alex
ander."
That was just the way everybody
else felt about it, too. Nobody con
coded Ed a chance to score, but as
the race wore on, and Tiger dropped
out in the third lap to leave him all
alone against that small army, some
thing began to happen. The fourth
lap came and Ed was still there, the
fifth lap made no difference. By all
rights and reason Ed should have
folded like a wet towel in that sixth
lap, too, but when they came in for
the lap gun at the end of the sev
enth he not only was still there but
he cut loose with a sprint that gave
him a great lead over Mehlert and
Voorhees.
Everybody was amazed, not so
much in the stands but in the press
box, where we who had been watch
ing him run all season sat gaping.
And then with 220 yards to go Ed
faded, he just couldn't go it any
more. Mehlert caught him at the
turn and passed him like going by a
post, Voorhees was next.
That weak finish doesn't take
away any of the glory of the race
for Ed, though, because he had no
right to do as well as he did, on past i
performances this year. It was the I
first race he had run this year
where he found himself in front at
the last lap, and he couldn't judge
his pace correctly. He didn't know
what he had left, nobody did, but he
tried—oh, how he tried in that last
lap. He made a mistake, true, but
he found himself, found he could
still run without having to quit for
a while during a race. And he won't
make that mistake when he race?

THEY GO FOR
BASEBALL THERE
Everybody knows that old joke
about the rooster that found an os
trich egg. He called over his hens
and said, "I don't want to complain,
t;iris, but I'd just like to have you
see what's being done in other
yards."
'I he baseball season is all over
now, so this is probably out of place
and very untimely, but there were a f
