# California Nine Trims Indians To Win Series
## Stanford Pitchers Receive Poor Defensive Support From Infield Players 
### ART ALLEN 
California's varsity baseball team
had too much for Coach Harry Wol
ter's nine last Saturday at Berkeley,
| winning 12—5, and annexing for
themselves at least a tie for the con
i ference championship. The Bears
drove Pitcher "Spike" Furman from
the mound in the third inning after
scoring five runs. Ray Weiershauser
relieved him, and three more runs
scored before the side was retired.
Both pitchers were victims of poor
defensive play by the Indian infield.
Only three fielding errors made the
score book, but several mistakes in
judgment added materially to Cali
; fornia's scoring.
Coflis, Heagerty Star
' Offensively left-fielder Jimmy
Coffis and Leo Heagerty were the
; shining lights. Jimmy collected a
ninth-inning home run, a single, and
a walk, to bring his total in the Bear
J series to six hits in 11 times at bat.
Heagerty got two singles, driving in
j three runs, two of which were
j scored by Coffis and the third by
Johnson, who had singled in the
fourth inning. Weiershauser's ninth
ining double knocked in Heagerty
i with the last run.
Bill Priest again pitched for the
! Berkeleyites and hurled effective
! ball in the pinches. "Hooks" De
j Vaurs with a double and a triple,
j and Priest with a homer and a single

California's varsity baseball team
had too much for Coach Harry Wol
ter's nine last Saturday at Berkeley,
| winning 12—5, and annexing for
themselves at least a tie for the con
i ference championship. The Bears
drove Pitcher "Spike" Furman from
the mound in the third inning after
scoring five runs. Ray Weiershauser
relieved him, and three more runs
scored before the side was retired.
Both pitchers were victims of poor
defensive play by the Indian infield.
Only three fielding errors made the
score book, but several mistakes in
judgment added materially to Cali
; fornia's scoring.
Coflis, Heagerty Star
' Offensively left-fielder Jimmy
Coffis and Leo Heagerty were the
; shining lights. Jimmy collected a
ninth-inning home run, a single, and
a walk, to bring his total in the Bear
J series to six hits in 11 times at bat.
Heagerty got two singles, driving in
j three runs, two of which were
j scored by Coffis and the third by
Johnson, who had singled in the
fourth inning. Weiershauser's ninth
ining double knocked in Heagerty
i with the last run.
Bill Priest again pitched for the
! Berkeleyites and hurled effective
! ball in the pinches. "Hooks" De
j Vaurs with a double and a triple,
j and Priest with a homer and a single
! lead the Bear attack.
