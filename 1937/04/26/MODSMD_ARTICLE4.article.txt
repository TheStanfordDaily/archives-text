# Fuse that Lighted Stockton's Labor Riot

### 

TAKEN THROUGH AIR MADE FOGGY BY TEAR GAS, this photograph shows the first outbreak
of violence in the April 23 riots at Stockton. At left is the truck, piled high with spinach, which highway
patrolmen attempted to convoy into the strike-bound Stockton Food Products plant. Unionists tried to
halt ft and tip over the crates of spinach. They were met with a barrage of tear gas in the start of disorders
that lasted an hour and a half and were terminated only after shot guns and revolvers were brought into
play and more than 50 men and women were injured.
