# Frosh Nine Bows To Bear Invaders
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball
team suffered defeat in the deciding
game of the series at the hands of
the Cal Babes, last Friday afternoon
on the Frosh Diamond by the lop
sided score of 14 to 1.
The whole Stanford nine played
ragged ball and allowed the visitors
to score at random. However, the
Cubs collected only one more hit
than the Redshirts, numerous er
rors and walks being responsible for
most of the Berkeleyite's tallies.
