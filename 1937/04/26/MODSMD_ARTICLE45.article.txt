# Frosh Track Squad Loses To California
## Wulff Breaks High-jump Mark; Half, Two-mile Records Fall to Cubs 
### 
Despite the heroic efforts of four
exceptionally talented young ath- j
letes, and a frenzied last-minute
finish by a speed-burning relay
team, Stanford's freshman tracksters •
took it on the chin from the Cal !
Babes here last Friday. The final
score read: California, 81; Stanford, I
50. 1
Of the quartet none made more '
effective use of his powers than the
Papoose's own Russell (Hiawatha) '
Wulff. The bespectacled Sacramen
toan sprang over the high jump bar
at the record-breaking height of 6 i
feet 4 inches. The previous best
Little Big Meet performance in this
event was G feet 2 inches.
Simpson Wins
Second Stanfordite to earn star- j
ring honors was Dick Simpson, fast- j
stepping hurdler, who won both :
barrier events in near record time.
His running mate, "Shamrock" Jess,
picked up the third point in each
race.
In the weight events, Stan Ander
son placed first in the discus with a
toss of just over 140 feet, and threw j
almost 47 feet in the shot to nab
second- 4 inches behind California's
highly touted Michaels.
Relay Team
Co-captain Ray Brown emerged
as the best man in the broad-jump
after encouraging considerable dif
ficulty in finding the exact where- j
abouts of the take-off board. Foul- !
ing on his first three jumps, he qua!- I
ified on his last attempt, and went !
on to win with the distance of 23 I
feet 5 inches.
Anchored by the speedy George i
Rockwell, and started off by Ray j
Sparling, with Russ Simpson and |
Tom O'Leary running the intei-me
diate laps, the Stanford relay four '
had little difficulty in finishing well j
ahead of the Bears.
Records Fall
The remainder of the meet had a i
very distinct Blue and Gold tint. I
Captain Modisette of Cal broke the j
half-mile record, and Vollmer j
smashed the old two-mile mark. El- |
ton Brombacher won both sprints |
from Stanford's Sparling, and Cub '
Stanley Sadoj ran away from his \
field in the mile.
California swept the pole vault, 1
captured the 440, and also placed
first in the javelin, with Braheny j
and Munkelt of Stanford grabbing j
second and third honors, respec- J
tively.

The constituent elements of a 200- j
pound human body would be worth »
about one dollar at market prices.
