# Finished Symphony, Opus $000

HENCEFORTH, when Stanford University
wants orchestral music, it will either pay
professionals or phone the Palo Alto High
School.
That's the verdict of Dr. Warren D. Allen,
who has seen student representation at re
hearsals dwindle to fife-and-drum proportions,
and who finds funds for maintaining a sym
phonic ensemble auditable only in red.
He's sorry. But more sorry than Dr. Allen is
the sorry budget on which the music "depart
ment" shoestrings along. More sorry than Dr.
Allen are the students who pay the $5 "syllabus
fees" per course, not for syllabi but to cover
instructors' salaries.
Other than for the elementary foreign-lan
guage courses, "syllabus fees" of that propor
tion are not exacted for any other class work at
exacting Stanford.
It seems that with courses teaching every
thing under the sun, the University actually
has no real money for a music school. Nor
has it a place for rehearsals. Nor has it suffi
cient student interest to maintain, even during
favorable periods, an exclusively student sym
phony orchestra.
These facts would shame the small middle
west schools that Stanford holds itself above.
Yet they are facts, as real within the holy
walls of the Quad as they would be in some
spindly school in America's hinterland.
Formerly, when Stafford's symphony or--
chestra could actually whip a concert into
shape, the University had a musical front even
though it was braced by Palo Altans and in
terested Peninsulans who would "fill in," even
though its performance was a labor for love by
Julius Haug, violinist and librarian of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, who graciously
conducted free.
Now even the front is gone.
The needs for the orchestra are simple:
money, student leadership, and a place to prac
tice.
With them, Stanford could at least hold up
its head in one important branch of art.
Without them, Stanford simply must confess
that music isn't worth bothering about — and
Stanford supporters on the outside must concur.
