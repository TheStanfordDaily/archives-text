# "Isn't That Horrible!"

### 
LAST week while the new magazine, Photo-
History, was educating America in the bar
barisms of Spanish Fascists, while Hearst was
attributing the same barbarisms to the Loyalists,
Spain might have been learning of the barbar
isms of Mississippi ranchers.
It was at the same time that Congress was
debating the anti-lynching bill and while Mis
sissippi Governor Hugh White was boasting of
his state's 15 lynch-free months that two negroes
were made to confess murder by burning their
chests with a blow-torch.
When the Mississippi mob-fury subsided,
chained to a tree just outside Winona was the
charred body of one of the negroes, burned to
death with gasoline-soaked brush.
And in the Winona court-house, deputies
from whom the two negroes had been kid
napped, declared that the procedure "was done
very quickly, quietly and orderly."
Now there is nothing remarkable about a
lynching of this sort. Nor is there anything re
markable about the war-time atrocities of either
the Spanish Fascists or Loyalists.
But what is remarkable is that there are no
time or place limitations on brutality.
The most stomach-turning cruelties are as
likely to occur in the United States as they are
in Spain, or Germany, or Africa, or South
America.
Barely faded from the nation's front-page are
the stories of the Detroit Black Legion, whose
members are as guilty of fiendishness as the
most war-maddened Spaniard.
Southerner.

And there are other cases that have cast a
bloody light on America down the years.
What determines the penchant to brutality
can hardly be hereditary, else many Americans
are brutes. Nor can it be environmental else
there is something horribly wrong with the
way Americans live not only in the South, but
elsewhere.
Yet, in Detroit this week, and in Mississippi,
men who held the lash over Black Legionnaires,
men who held the blow torch over the two
negroes, will gasp in horror when they read of
what is happening in Spainâ€”and thank God
they live in America.
