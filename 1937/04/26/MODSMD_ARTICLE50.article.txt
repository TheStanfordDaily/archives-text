# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
QUOTING from that great newsorgy: the Paly Times
society section: "Howard Clark and Miss Eleanor
Bacon were named King and Queen of the annual
Stanford masqucd ball held on the campus as part of
the Convalescent Home Drive last night.
"Clarke, member of Chi Psi fraternity, is registered
from Pasadena. Miss Bacon is affiliated with Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority and is also from Pasadena."
When called for corroboration by Our Hasher at a
late hour last night, Mr. Clark emphatically denied the
charge. "We arc just friends," he said.
The trouble seems to be that the Times society edi
tor called up the ball chairman at the Chi Psi house
and the ball chairman was not home, but another Chi
Psi was.
The society editor made two other mistakes, how
ever. She should have called the Gamma Phi Beta
house, and she should have called Friday afternoon.
Everyone was surprised. The room was decorated
with beautiful drapes and Stanford couples. Everyone
was surprised that they bought tickets.
|T is nice to know about the fine spirit of co-opera
tion that exists between our two high houses on the
hill, the Sigma Nus and the D. T. Deltas.
It is nice to know and it also is rather funny, but
at 2 o'clock going on Sunday morning, a Dclt discuster
was driving his car and his lady guest up the drive
way toward the Delt house in general and the Sigma
Nu house in particular, and suddenly, ooops, like this
—ooops, his car turned over right in the middle of the
driveway, with the Delt winning the toss, but with the
lady guest pinned under the car.
All in a panic, the discuster rushed into his house
and awakened his brothers with a shout, saying that
there was a girl out there in the driveway under his
car. The Delts laughed qiute cynically, and pointed out
to the offending member the extremely illogical nature
of his story. After convincing him thoroughly they
put him to bed.
In the meantime, a Sigma Nu came along, noticed
the car and noticed the girl, and ran onto the Sigma
Nu sleeping porch with a shout, saying that there was
a girl out there in the driveway under a Delt car.
This did not seem at all illogical to the iSgma Nus, who
tumbled out of bed in a hurry.
The little lady had a bruise upon her knee.

|N CASE some of the readers might not have caught
the point to the little gag at the end of Friday's
Hasher, I think it is my duty to explain. It seems that
in response to numerous requests for a five-day week
on Our Hasher, the freshman who took it over during
the frosh edition was contracted for by the editor to
turn out the column when Our Hash took his San
Francisco pauses to get fresh. The gag about buying
Hasher and four pages of dashing news, etc., for $.05
any day at the Daily business office, was just a subtle
bird for my plugging of My Hasher anthology in the
column. I think it was really pretty clever.

Hasher and four pages of dashing news, etc., for $.05
any day at the Daily business office, was just a subtle
bird for my plugging of My Hasher anthology in the
column. I think it was really pretty clever.
QUOTING from that great newsorgy: the Paly Times
society section: "Howard Clark and Miss Eleanor
Bacon were named King and Queen of the annual
Stanford masqucd ball held on the campus as part of
the Convalescent Home Drive last night.
"Clarke, member of Chi Psi fraternity, is registered
from Pasadena. Miss Bacon is affiliated with Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority and is also from Pasadena."
When called for corroboration by Our Hasher at a
late hour last night, Mr. Clark emphatically denied the
charge. "We arc just friends," he said.
The trouble seems to be that the Times society edi
tor called up the ball chairman at the Chi Psi house
and the ball chairman was not home, but another Chi
Psi was.
The society editor made two other mistakes, how
ever. She should have called the Gamma Phi Beta
house, and she should have called Friday afternoon.
Everyone was surprised. The room was decorated
with beautiful drapes and Stanford couples. Everyone
was surprised that they bought tickets.
|T is nice to know about the fine spirit of co-opera
tion that exists between our two high houses on the
hill, the Sigma Nus and the D. T. Deltas.
It is nice to know and it also is rather funny, but
at 2 o'clock going on Sunday morning, a Dclt discuster
was driving his car and his lady guest up the drive
way toward the Delt house in general and the Sigma
Nu house in particular, and suddenly, ooops, like this
—ooops, his car turned over right in the middle of the
driveway, with the Delt winning the toss, but with the
lady guest pinned under the car.
All in a panic, the discuster rushed into his house
and awakened his brothers with a shout, saying that
there was a girl out there in the driveway under his
car. The Delts laughed qiute cynically, and pointed out
to the offending member the extremely illogical nature
of his story. After convincing him thoroughly they
put him to bed.
In the meantime, a Sigma Nu came along, noticed
the car and noticed the girl, and ran onto the Sigma
Nu sleeping porch with a shout, saying that there was
a girl out there in the driveway under a Delt car.
This did not seem at all illogical to the iSgma Nus, who
tumbled out of bed in a hurry.
The little lady had a bruise upon her knee.

|N CASE some of the readers might not have caught
the point to the little gag at the end of Friday's
Hasher, I think it is my duty to explain. It seems that
in response to numerous requests for a five-day week
on Our Hasher, the freshman who took it over during
the frosh edition was contracted for by the editor to
turn out the column when Our Hash took his San
Francisco pauses to get fresh. The gag about buying
Hasher and four pages of dashing news, etc., for $.05
any day at the Daily business office, was just a subtle
bird for my plugging of My Hasher anthology in the
