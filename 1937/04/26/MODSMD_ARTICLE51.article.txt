LESSONS IN GARDENING
"¥>AT! Pat! Where arc you?" screamed the White
Rabbit. "Sure, then I'm here! Digging for apples,
yer honor!" Tims the gardener in "Alice in Wonder
land."
To many students, graduate and undergraduate, the
idea of taking more than the minimum of courses not
closely connected with their major appears much the
same thing as digging for apples.
They believe that the best education is one which
concentrates on a single field, giving complete mastery
of it and touching no subjects not closely associated.

But those who, coming of stern pioneer stock, have
managed to keep awake through the third week in
Sociology 75, have made the earth shaking discovery
that society is changing constantly. Those who have
wearied in not doing so well and have missed this in
formational treasure can gather much the same impres
sion from even a casual reading of current newspapers.
You may not like the gently persuasive tactics of
John L. Lewis, he whom some call the ambassador
plenipotentiary of Hell. And you might not care to
patronize his barber, but you can hardly overlook the
fact that he is affecting some startling changes in our
industrial set-up.
You may not agree with bland, smiling F.D.R., but
even a Chem major with his nose in a test tube can see
that he and his cohorts have their axe out for the status
of the status quo and are chopping their initials in it.

the world changing under its feet, this genera
tion must be prepared to change with it; and that
means that the more understanding we can got of
fundamental causes, the better chance we shall have of
fitting into the new scheme of things. The specialist
in any one field may find himself unable to apply his
skill because he does not know how to fit it in with
the bewilderingly complex situations that arise today.
Of course, there has always been change, but now
the rate is well over the old speed limit. A pattern of
preparation, satisfactory in the past, will very prob
ably be inadequate in the future. Labor, its demands,
and its gains, will slap the faces of doctors, lawyers,
engineers as well as of business men. Success will de
pend on the ability to adapt a variety of sound prin
ciples to new and fantastic situations.

r PHE old private fight between labor and capital has
taken on the aspects of a laborite coup d'etat. The
representative of labor is no longer a grimy ditch dig
ger with a sweaty shirt that smells like an Encina egg.
He is a keen, relentless expert on diplomacy, psychol
ogy, and military tactics. If such a man begins to
dictate to us what we shall do, we will need a well
balanced mind, emotional control, and a hell of a lot of
charity, tolerance and Christian spirit. It will take
more than specialized learning to deal with such an
opponent.
In preparing to face situations like this, a man will
need to study a variety of subjects. To apply knowl
edge in one, he must have knowledge of another.
Perhaps then, digging for educational apples is not
so foolish as it seems.
