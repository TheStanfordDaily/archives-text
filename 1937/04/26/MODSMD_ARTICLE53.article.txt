THOSE PROGRAMS that you
missed on the radio yesterday are
just moved up an hour from their
regular time. The yearly mix-up
caused by the switch of eastern cit
ies to daylight saving time was
hashed out Sunday, and you were
probably a victim of the mess if you
weren't on your guard.
LOVERS OF GREAT music are
beginning to find the season a bit
slack with the "Met" opera broad
casts gone, and the New York and
Chicago Symphonies off the air.
However, in addition to those auto
mobile symphonic hours, Colum
bia's "Everybody's Music" series,
renewed yesterday for this summer,
is worthy of note. It is heard from
11 to 12 every Sunday morning, and
provides good ideas about good mu
sic, interestingly presented.
PAUL WIIITEMAN opened a new
series of broadcasts from Chicago's
Drake Hotel yesterday with his
"Rhythmic Concerts." Designed
along the lines of his jazz-symphony
concerts of the past, the program
will be aired between 4:30 and 5:00,
Sundays, over KFRC.
MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION in a
radio version, brings Irene Dunn and
Robert Taylor together again for the
"Lux Theater" program this eve
ning, 5 to 6 over KSFO . . . And if
you like Phil Spitalny's all-female
cast, he opens his new "Hour of
Charm" program today at 5:30 over
KGO.
