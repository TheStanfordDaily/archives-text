"SEVENTH HEAVEN." Rebirths
ax*e too often unsuccessful attempts
to bring back the original glory, but
James Stewart and Simone Simon
put their all into this new "Seventh
Heaven," and tlie result is to me
even more satisfying than the Gay
nor-Farrell version.
You undoubtedly remember the
story from your grammar school
days—the young atheist with a heart
of gold takes in a poor girl to save
her from her nasty sister—and he
falls in love with her and his faith in
God is restored.
But Stewart and this French gal
give it something. Stewart, as lie
often remarks in his role of Chico,
is "a very remarkable fellow." He
comes forth with some real' acting,
and it is a surprise and pleasure.
Simone as the wistful, charming
Diane, removes that rather sickly
Janet Gaynor taste that has been
with us all these years, but I won
der if she leaves much more in its
place. Close-ups showing her big
beautiful eyes, and her innocent

child-like look definitely favor the
girl, but when she starts to talk, one
wonders if she has anything but
those eyes and that look.
Coming as it does in the spring,
"Seventh Heaven" offers a good
weep to those young things whose
fancies are turning, and plenty of
laughs for the young cynic who can't
see this sweet love story business.
So consider it recommended as good
entertainment.
"THAT MAN'S HERE AGAIN."
Hugh Herbert goes through his
usual antics in this perfect example
of a second feature, but if you like
Hugh Herbert's antics, you may be
amused.
