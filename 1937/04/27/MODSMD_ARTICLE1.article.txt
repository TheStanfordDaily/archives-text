# Presentation Of 'Precious Stream' May Be Banned
## New York Agents Seek Cancellation Of Advance Farm Performances 
### 
If Dramatic Council's production of "Lady Precious Stream" is pre
sented Friday and Saturday nights, it will be over the protest of Samuel
French and Merle Armitage at the head of the management handling
professional tour of the play in the United States.

According to a telegram received♦
yesterday by Dramatic Manager
Dick Daugherty:
"Management which intends tak
ing Lady Precious Stream on coun
trywide professional tour advise
they have booking for professional
company on Pacific Coast amount- j
ing to thousands of dollars which |
would be jeopardized by your pro- I
duction and they absolutely insist J
you cancel any performances of play ;
you have scheduled."
Contacted French
Daugherty and Dramatic Director
Gordon Lange had previously con- ;
tacted French with regard to royal
ties and permission to produce the
play at the end of last quarter.
French referred them to Armitage,
who granted special permission to
Stanford to give the play its first
amateur production, regardless of
the professional tour.
Complications Result
Early in the present quarter,
Daugherty contacted a New York
music dealer with regard to record
ings for the campus production. He
in turn evidently reported to French,
which resulted in the present com
plications.
Tickets for the production will re
main on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
until further definite reports are
obtained, Daugherty declared.
