# Former Daily Editor Dodges War Bullets
## Bob Jones Visits Farm; Tells of Spanish War 
### 
From one battlefront to another—
that's the itinerary of Bob Jones,
ex-Daily editor, who left the cam
pus as just another gi'ad on a "world
tour," and returned yesterday, a
big-time war correspondent.
Last year he was dodging bullets
in Spain as a United Press repre
sentative on the Guadalajara front.
Last week, less than a fortnight after
his return to San Francisco, he was
dodging bullets in the Stockton can
nery riot as a San Francisco Chon
icle reporter.
Personal Observations
His own observations of the Span
ish War, as straight as steamship
and railroad could bring him and
them to California, are in sharp con
trast with preconceived notions of
valiant Loyalists fighting to pre
serve their land against foreign
fascists.
"If the Loyalist government had
been truly strong, there would have
been no successful revolt," Jones
revealed on a campus visit yester
day. "The fight at its inception was
the fight of General Franco, a mili
tarist and a Spaniard rather than a
Fascist, against a vacillating admin
istration that tended more to an
archy than to Communism.
Lacked Strength
"Franco knew what he wanted,
and in that fact alone lies much of
his power. He is equally aided by
the anarchism of the loyalists, who
lack the centralized authority need
ed for war even when fighting to
preserve themselves."
Using a compendium of philosophy
for a manual of arms, loyalist forces
would look unfavorably on newspa
per correspondents from America
because "they come from a capital
ist country."
Meanwhile, Franco pushed his
foreign supplies through sympathet
ic Portugal, an authoritative state
regarding the liberal Madrid gov
ernment as anathema, and slowly
constructed a life-line of troops
from the North to South in Spain,
from strategic points where the re
volt started.
Only in later stages of the war,
Jones pointed out, did the so-called
Fascists receive aid from outside
nations. Meanwhile, he believes,
similar aid was being given the
Madrid Qovernment by Russia.
Spain Can Benefit
After he scraped off the paint of
prapaganda, Jones has come to be
lieve that the Fascists can present
certain symbolic benefits to Spain.
Franco can give his country a strong
government, and his sales-talk to
Spain's masses is protection of the
country and its restoration to former
glory.
'"That's what he says, not neces
sarily what I believe," Jones pointed
out. "But the belief that Spain needs
a government stronger than the
Loyalist has thrown some popular
support to his side. He is not totally
a persecutor of his mother nation,
financed and motivated by foreign
forces.
"This talk of Spain being a battle
ground of Fascism and Communism
gives me a pain. Most Spaniards
can't read. What do they know or
care about Communism or Fascism?
They can't even look up the defini
tion of the words in the dictionary,
as we can."

from strategic points where the re
volt started.
Only in later stages of the war,
Jones pointed out, did the so-called
Fascists receive aid from outside
nations. Meanwhile, he believes,
similar aid was being given the
Madrid Qovernment by Russia.
Spain Can Benefit
After he scraped off the paint of
prapaganda, Jones has come to be
lieve that the Fascists can present
certain symbolic benefits to Spain.
Franco can give his country a strong
government, and his sales-talk to
Spain's masses is protection of the
country and its restoration to former
glory.
'"That's what he says, not neces
sarily what I believe," Jones pointed
out. "But the belief that Spain needs
a government stronger than the
Loyalist has thrown some popular
support to his side. He is not totally
a persecutor of his mother nation,
financed and motivated by foreign
forces.
"This talk of Spain being a battle
ground of Fascism and Communism
gives me a pain. Most Spaniards
can't read. What do they know or
care about Communism or Fascism?
They can't even look up the defini
tion of the words in the dictionary,
as we can."
From one battlefront to another—
that's the itinerary of Bob Jones,
ex-Daily editor, who left the cam
pus as just another gi'ad on a "world
tour," and returned yesterday, a
big-time war correspondent.
Last year he was dodging bullets
in Spain as a United Press repre
sentative on the Guadalajara front.
Last week, less than a fortnight after
his return to San Francisco, he was
dodging bullets in the Stockton can
nery riot as a San Francisco Chon
icle reporter.
Personal Observations
His own observations of the Span
ish War, as straight as steamship
and railroad could bring him and
them to California, are in sharp con
trast with preconceived notions of
valiant Loyalists fighting to pre
serve their land against foreign
fascists.
"If the Loyalist government had
been truly strong, there would have
been no successful revolt," Jones
revealed on a campus visit yester
day. "The fight at its inception was
the fight of General Franco, a mili
tarist and a Spaniard rather than a
Fascist, against a vacillating admin
istration that tended more to an
archy than to Communism.
Lacked Strength
"Franco knew what he wanted,
and in that fact alone lies much of
his power. He is equally aided by
the anarchism of the loyalists, who
lack the centralized authority need
ed for war even when fighting to
preserve themselves."
Using a compendium of philosophy
for a manual of arms, loyalist forces
would look unfavorably on newspa
per correspondents from America
because "they come from a capital
ist country."
Meanwhile, Franco pushed his
foreign supplies through sympathet
ic Portugal, an authoritative state
regarding the liberal Madrid gov
ernment as anathema, and slowly
constructed a life-line of troops
from the North to South in Spain,
from strategic points where the re
volt started.
