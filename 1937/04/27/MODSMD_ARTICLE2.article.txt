PITTSBURGH, April 26 (UP). —
Swollen rivers tonight raced toward
dangerous flood stages in many pai'ts
of western Pennsylvania, Mary
land, West Virginia, and eastern
Ohio.
Thirty-six hours of rainfall, aver
aging three inches of precipitation,
brought flood threats to the Al
legheny, Monongahela and Ohio
Rivers.
With a drizzling rain continuing
here tonight, the three rivers pushed
toward an expected crest of 36 feet
by tomorrow noon —11 feet above
flood level. At 6 p.m., the stage at
the point where the Allegheny and
Monongahela meet to form the Ohio
was 30 feet and was rising at the
rate of .8 of a foot an hour.
Flood-weary merchants were
ready to man pumps and remove
merchandise to higher floor levels as
the muddy water crept into base
ments for the third time this year in
the golden triangle, Pittsburgh's
rich business district.
