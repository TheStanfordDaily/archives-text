# High Court To Try Vital Security Act
## Legality of Pension Law To Be Judged Soon By Supreme Court Trial 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 20 (U.R).—
The Supreme Court today made
possible an early and comprehensive
test of social security legislation by
accepting a case involving constitu
tionality of federal old age annuity
taxes.
The agreement to review validity
of taxes affecting 26,000,000 wage
earnersa and 2,700,000 employers
came as a prelude to a new plea
from Attorney General Homer S.
Cummings for passage of President
Roosevelt's Supreme Court reor
ganization bill.
Criticizes Statements
In a speech prepared for delivery
over the national radio forum, Cum
mings criticized statements by Chief
Justice Charles Evans Hughes in a
letter which Senator Burton K.
Wheeler, Democrat, Mont., read to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
That committee, meanwhile, pre
pared to start executive sessions to
morrow on the court bill.
Social security is the last vital New
Deal issue pending in the court,
which will recess May 31 or June 7
until next October. The decision will
have an important bearing on the
bitter fight over the judiciary bill.
The case accepted today involves
old age annuities. It was filed by
George P. Davis, stockholder in the
Edison Electric Illuminating Com
pany, Boston, who sought to prevent
collection of the tax.
Decision Appealed
The First Circuit Court of Ap
peals at Boston 10 days ago declared
the old age portion of the act to be
unconstitutional. This decision was
appealed by the Government to the
Supreme Court in record time. ■
The announcement that the court
would consider the old age case came
after the tribunal had presented
several important decisions, includ
ing one reversing the conviction of
Angelo Herndon, Negro Communist
organizer, sentenced to an 18-20-year
prison term ort charges of violating a
Georgia reconstruction days statute.
