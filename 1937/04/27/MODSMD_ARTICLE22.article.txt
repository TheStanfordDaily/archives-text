# Court Controversy Faces Compromise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 26 (UP).—
A long campaign to modify Presi
dent Roosevelt's Supreme Court
program was planned today by Con
gressmen favoring settlement of the
controversy by compromise. They
prepared to press alternative meas
ures as long as there is any chance
of enactment by the Senate.
The compromise bloc did not ac
tually expect success during ex
ecutive deliberations of the Senate
Judiciary Committee starting to
morrow. But they were highly con
fident that an agreement would be
reached before a final Senate vote
on the bill.
One of the first efforts at modifi
cation — reportedly advanced either
by the administration or by admin
istration supporters without direct
approval by the President —was un
derstood to call for reduction of the
number of additional Supreme
Court Justices from six to four.
