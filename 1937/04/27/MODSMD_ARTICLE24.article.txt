## 
### 
VINCENNES, France, April 26
(UP). â€” Authorities arranged today
to send back to his home in Michi
gan the body of 25-year-old Clem
Sohn, the modern world's first bird
man, killed yesterday before more
than 50,000 persons when his para
chute failed to open.
Mr. Sohn called himself a "hawk
man." He crashed to his death on
the air field after he had thrilled
the crowd at a flying festival with
swallow-like gliding, thousands of
feet above the air.
His flying garb of "bat wings,"
consisted of treated canvas over
metal rods strapped to his arms,
waist, and legs.
