# Indian Hoop Aces Perform Tonight For Home Drive
## Debate, Movie To Wind Up Successful Quest for Contributions 
### 
Next year's basketball team gives a preview performance at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion, with Coach John Bunn as referee.
Admission to the game will be 25 cents, and profits will go to the
Convalescent Home Fund. Bunn, with his reputation as a clowning ref
eree, will vie with the two teams as drawing cards in tonight's battle.

> On the veteran team are Dinty
Moore, Howie Turner, Bill Quade,
Nellie Heath, and Dick Lyon. The
new team is composed of Hank Lui
setti, Phil Zonne, Jack Calderwood,
Art Stoefen, and H. B. Lee. Many
I substitutes will be entered through
i out the game.
Two other remaining phases of
the drive are a movie and a de
bate. The benefit show will be
Warner Baxter in "Robin Hood of
Eldorado," to be shown at the
Varsity Theater at 3 o'clock Fri
day afternoon. After $25 is paid
for theater expenses, the 30- and
40-cent admission charges will be
turned over to the Drive Fund.
The time and question of the de
bate have not yet been announced.
Debaters will be those who toured
Central America against those who
have just returned from Hawaii.
