# Frost Contest Decision Near
## Name Committee Awaits Vote from Reynolds 
### 
As Stanford awaits a blast from
the long-quiet guns of the amphi
theater name-selecting committee,
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, with two
decisions and a list of 200 suggested
names on his desk, awaits word from
Jim Reynolds, another member of
the judging board.
200 Names Submitted
Reynolds, still catching up with
activities after the South American
trip, is expected to submit his deci
sion today. It will be combined with
those of President Wilbur, Howard
Frost, and Almon E. Roth, the lat
ter two already having replied by
mail.
Two hundred different names were
submitted. In some cases as many
as 14 contestants suggested the same
name, which means that should such
title be selected, the $100 prize
would be divided.
Wilbur Amused
Latin and Spanish suggestions
were not uncommon. In cases where
the word "the" was prefixed to the
name, such titles were listed sep
arately. In. this way a large number
of combinations have resulted from
relatively few suggested words.
Most amusing fact, to President
Wilbur, whose vote may be the de
ciding one, is that the best name is
not on the list submitted by con
testants.
