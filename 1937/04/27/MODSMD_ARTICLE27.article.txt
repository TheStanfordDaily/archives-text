# More Courses Now Offered For Women
## 
### 
In answer to the demand of the
increased enrollment of women at
Stanford, the University is now of
fering more courses of primary in
terest to women than ever before.
Yet an enlarged curriculum in art,
music, and social service remains a
further need, Miss Mary Yost, dean
of women, declared yesterday.
Lack of resources stands in the
way of expansion of the course of
study to meet the demands of the
1100. she said.
For the first time since the found
ing of the University in 1891, women
are finding spread out before them
in the quarterly published time
schedule, a number of new courses
designed to equip them for an im
portant place in society as well as
in the art of home-making.
New Course Succcss
For instance, last quarter, "Wom
en in Modern Society" was given to
about 65 women. Because of the
success of the course, Miss Yost
hopes to continue it next year and
make it permanent. Time and effort
was donated by Miss Anastasia
Doyle, head resident of the Uni
versity.
As a sequel, Miss Christine Rick
er, head of the dining halls, is now
giving "Women in the Home." Be
cause no other department could be
found suitable for both these cours
es, they are listed under the P. E.
department.
Management Course
For next fall, and to round out
the offerings for a year, the Univer
sity will offer a course in Advanced
Personnel Management designed to
equip women for the task of being
resident assistants in the dormitor
ies.
More music and art courses are
being given than ever before but the
curriculum of the art department
has not been changed radically dur
ing the past few years. The influx
of women has also contributed to a
demand for a new, separate school of
dramatics.
