# Fate of Bilbao Hinges on New Loyalist Push
## Basque Militia Fights In Counter-Attack Against Invading Rebel Troops 
### 
BILBAO, April 26 (U.R).â€”Basque
militiamen, on their last line of de
fense, were ordered to hazard the
late of the entire Bilbao area today
on a desperate counter - attack
against the Rebels.
It was admitted that the Loyalists
had been thrown back before a tre
mendous Rebel attack and that the
fate of Bilbao and the coastal area
around it hinged on the next phase
of the battle.
Council Given Authority
Rebel airplanes bombed and ma
chine gunned Loyalist militia lines
and towns all over the area, while
on the ground Rebel infantrymen
moved against Durango, only 18
miles east of the city by road.
The Basque semi - autonomous
government, after an emergency
meeting this morning, gave the de
fense council supreme authority
over the entire Bilbao area.
Loyalists said the battle was the
most severe of the entire civil war.
Losses were heavy.
Situation Desperate
It v/as admitted frankly here that
the Loyalists' situation was desper
ate. Officially, the militia retirement
to new lines was called a "rectifica
tion of the line," but privately it was
admitted that it was a retreat be
fore overwhelming force.
The food situation was much im
proved. The British freighters j
Thurston and Stesso slipped into the
harbor during the dark hours this \
morning, apparently under the guns |
of two British destroyers.
