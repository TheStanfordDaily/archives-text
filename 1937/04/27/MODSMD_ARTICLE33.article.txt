# Staff Member Tells Experience on Ship
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Bellboy on a cruise steamer may be a far cry from being a Daily staff ;
member, but Dave Lett' has spanned the void in one stride.
From the S.S. Scanpenn bound for the Lesser Antilles, The Daily's I
| "foreign correspondent" writes of his adventures with "decadent old ladies
and seasick diabetic men," and various corridors and stairways which

must be dusted, polished, swept,"
and scoured by 6:45 a.m.
I But the job has its brighter mo-
I ments. As Leff describes it, "Among
! other things, it is remunerative. A
j somewhat inebriated gentleman
' gave me two dollars on account the
other dayâ€”on account of he didn't
j know what he was doing. Today he
repeated the performance. Usually
j bellhops have to wait till the last
i day for the large payoff, so I am
i doing fairly well, what with $5 total
| for the five days we've been at sea."
More difficult than fulfilling the
job was getting it in the first place,
which depended very little on aca
j demic knowledge and a great deal
I on actual maritime experience, Leff
ruefully explains.
After covering practically all the
j New York waterfront, he finally
{ landed a berth on a none too spic
| and span fruit steamer, only to be
! replaced when he couldn't get a
| Certificate of Service in time.
Leff's luck changed the next day,
though, he says. "The first craft I
j tried, I landed a job, though not
without a bit of chicanery."
The University of Minnesota has
j its own newsreel theater.
