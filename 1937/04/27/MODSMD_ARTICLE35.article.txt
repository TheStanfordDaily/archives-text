For some weeks yers sincerely hus \
been laboring under the impression j
that tho Stanford-U.S.C. meet was
going to be this week-end. After !
.stumbling around through a column
yesterday that had that impression |
splashed all over it, it registered on j
my slightly sensitive brain that the !
meet was set for May 8, and that J
May 8 is just one week after May ;
Day, and May Day is the day I had
in mind. Hence, it would follow that
the meet is just one week after this !
Saturday, which is unfortunate all <
the way around.

They cleaned up varsity baseball,
freshman baseball, freshman track,
and possibly varsity and freshman J
K'olf last week-end — now all the j
Daily has to worry about is how to |
fill the sports page, or so they tell !
me.
We are left, you see, with varsity i
track, spring football practice, ten- j
nis perhaps, and a few minor sports j
that aren't supposed to be sufficient i
to fill the paper day in and day out, J
but we shall have to see.

Track looks ahead to a brighter
future, now, since that powerhouse
victory across the bay, for there are
still three definite meets to come
and Stanford figures much higher
in each by tht win. One week from
Saturday, I think, the Cards meet
U.S.C. here. I think, on Angell
Field, I think. One week later, May
15, the annual West Coast Relays
at Fresno State College will occur,
while the Pacific Coast Conference
meet at Los Angeles comes two
weeks after that at Los Angeles.
The chances against Troy are up
30 per cent, now, and it begins to
look as though Doughty Dean Crom
well will have to do at least a little
worrying. A few Stanford upsets, it
wouldn't take more than two or
three, and the meet would belong to
the Indians. One way it might be
doped now, leaving the crippled
Ross Bush out of the meet, gives
Stanford 60 points without prejudice
in the breaks allowance, and it
wouldn't take too much to boost that
to 66.

Of course, nobody in his right
mind can logically give Stanford the
meet yet, even if Ross Bush were
definitely eliminated two weeks
early. We don't know up here just
what kind of shape Bush is in, or if j
he will be able to go May B—all we j
can go on is the report that his in
jury is the same as last year, that
Achilles tendon, and the memory
that last year's hurt kept him out of
things for a good month.
If Bush is through until the Fres
no Relays or the Conference meet,
then Stanford figures awfully strong
in the Trojan contest. The Southern
Californian might be figured for a
win in the mile—might, we say—or
he might be figured for a win in the
880—also might—but he would have
a hard time winning either and for a
cinch couldn't win both in the same
afternoon.

His points, though, would bo just |
about enough handicap to Stanford !
to make it too tough to win the meet. !
In all fairness to Bush, we can't do j
anything but wish him in the meet, j
especially since he allegedly was the j
recipient of one of the dirtiest re- j
marks imaginable when he quit '
against the Olympic Club a week i
ago Saturday. Incidentally, all those
who saw that race seem to think !
that Bush limped and struggled and i
fought for 100 yards or so before he
yielded to anxious Trojans asking
him to step off the track, as he tried
to keep up with the others. And he i
has a reputation with Templeton as |
being one of the guttiest runners on 1
the Coast.

tells me the most fun he had Satur
day was saying goodbye to Bob Her
vvig with a "Thanks for a lovely

nis perhaps, and a few minor sports j
that aren't supposed to be sufficient i
to fill the paper day in and day out, J
but we shall have to see.

Track looks ahead to a brighter
future, now, since that powerhouse
victory across the bay, for there are
still three definite meets to come
and Stanford figures much higher
in each by tht win. One week from
Saturday, I think, the Cards meet
U.S.C. here. I think, on Angell
Field, I think. One week later, May
15, the annual West Coast Relays
at Fresno State College will occur,
while the Pacific Coast Conference
meet at Los Angeles comes two
weeks after that at Los Angeles.
The chances against Troy are up
30 per cent, now, and it begins to
look as though Doughty Dean Crom
well will have to do at least a little
worrying. A few Stanford upsets, it
wouldn't take more than two or
three, and the meet would belong to
the Indians. One way it might be
doped now, leaving the crippled
Ross Bush out of the meet, gives
Stanford 60 points without prejudice
in the breaks allowance, and it
wouldn't take too much to boost that
to 66.

Of course, nobody in his right
mind can logically give Stanford the
meet yet, even if Ross Bush were
definitely eliminated two weeks
early. We don't know up here just
what kind of shape Bush is in, or if j
he will be able to go May B—all we j
can go on is the report that his in
jury is the same as last year, that
Achilles tendon, and the memory
that last year's hurt kept him out of
things for a good month.
If Bush is through until the Fres
no Relays or the Conference meet,
then Stanford figures awfully strong
in the Trojan contest. The Southern
Californian might be figured for a
win in the mile—might, we say—or
he might be figured for a win in the
880—also might—but he would have
a hard time winning either and for a
cinch couldn't win both in the same
afternoon.

His points, though, would bo just |
about enough handicap to Stanford !
to make it too tough to win the meet. !
In all fairness to Bush, we can't do j
anything but wish him in the meet, j
especially since he allegedly was the j
recipient of one of the dirtiest re- j
marks imaginable when he quit '
against the Olympic Club a week i
ago Saturday. Incidentally, all those
who saw that race seem to think !
that Bush limped and struggled and i
fought for 100 yards or so before he
yielded to anxious Trojans asking
him to step off the track, as he tried
to keep up with the others. And he i
has a reputation with Templeton as |
being one of the guttiest runners on 1
the Coast.

definitely eliminated two weeks
early. We don't know up here just
what kind of shape Bush is in, or if j
he will be able to go May B—all we j
can go on is the report that his in
jury is the same as last year, that
Achilles tendon, and the memory
that last year's hurt kept him out of
things for a good month.
If Bush is through until the Fres
no Relays or the Conference meet,
then Stanford figures awfully strong
in the Trojan contest. The Southern
Californian might be figured for a
win in the mile—might, we say—or
he might be figured for a win in the
880—also might—but he would have
a hard time winning either and for a
cinch couldn't win both in the same
afternoon.

His points, though, would bo just |
about enough handicap to Stanford !
to make it too tough to win the meet. !
In all fairness to Bush, we can't do j
anything but wish him in the meet, j
especially since he allegedly was the j
recipient of one of the dirtiest re- j
marks imaginable when he quit '
against the Olympic Club a week i
ago Saturday. Incidentally, all those
who saw that race seem to think !
that Bush limped and struggled and i
fought for 100 yards or so before he
yielded to anxious Trojans asking
him to step off the track, as he tried
to keep up with the others. And he i
has a reputation with Templeton as |
being one of the guttiest runners on 1
the Coast.

Senior Track Manager John Pirdy
tells me the most fun he had Satur
day was saying goodbye to Bob Her
vvig with a "Thanks for a lovely
afternoon. Bob."
