# Strikers' Kitchens May Remain Open

### 
AUBURN. Me., April 26 (U.R).—The
C.1.0.'s commissary and soup kitch
en—only free food sources for 2000
shoe strikers in Lewiston and Au
burn— may remain open, Justice
Harry Manser of the State Supreme
Court ruled today.
Counsel for the manuracturers had
asked Justice Manser to close the
commissary and kitchen on the
grounds their continuance violated
an anti-strike injunction issued by
him last week. Both Auburn and
Lewiston have refused municipal re
lief to strikers.
Larry Rosenthal, Chicago White
Sox outfielder, spurned two jobs in
a brewery last winter. He was afraid
of putting on weight.
