STANFORD annually takes the money of 1100
women, originally admitted because the
University needed their support. But apparently
the Administration still looks back to the days
of Dr. Jordan when Stanford was largely a
school for training professional men.
The time is near when the University must
snap front and center to face a drastic revision
and enlargement of curriculum—in favor not of
the men but of the women.
The academic offerings that pass over Stan
ford's scholastic counters today offer no spe
cial inducement to the University's feminine 25
per cent. An enlarged art department and a
few inconsequential courses in social problems
are all Stanford has felt itself immediately obli
gated or able to do.
Still largely as it was during the days of the
500 is the Music Department, always a stamp
ing ground for women students. Recently, the
prevalence of five-dollar "syllabus fees" in that
department has highlighted the position of the
University in so far as it is taking $115's for
legitimate academic goods, and not delivering
without surcharge.
Now it may be a bitter pill, but the fact
is that many women aren't interested in the
courses interesting to most men. Most women
are not here to be trained in the science of
bread-winning.
Many women are here to get a finish. Time
was when Stanford could have said, "Then go
to a finishing school." But by the University's
own admission, implied by the acceptance of
women, them days are gone forever.
It may not like to completely underwrite or
establish courses which, in the majority male
viewpoint, are gingerbread on the academic
structure.
But Stanford must face the problem of a
transition that includes the women, one that
must be definitely directed toward delivering
the academic goods for which it receives thou
sands of dollars per quarter.
