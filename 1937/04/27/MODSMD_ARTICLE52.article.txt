wtT'S robot education," the griper shouted,
x when he learned that some universities are
using a new mechanical test grader, which in
geniously tallies by a system of holes punched
in the exam.
"It's robot education—first, mechanized lec
tures, now power-driven exam correctors."
And the griper accompanied his hair tearings
with the ultra-popular lament that lectures are
nothing more than paraphrased text books,
shoveled out in 40-minute precision periods by
a mechanical reader whose notes are danger
ously ready to crumble to dust from age.
Though based on an extreme—gripers usu
ally confuse the mean with the extreme —there
is a certain amount of weight in the argument
that professors should occasionally crawl out
of the academic shell for a quick look at the lad
who takes dictation Monday, Wednesday and
Friday at nine.
Stanford's student-faculty relations commit
tee has recently taken steps to promote these
extra-classroom associations.
Several Sunday night bullsessions at profes
sors' homes have been arranged, one has al
ready been held with good success.
And when the nitery is nitering, the commit
tee plans afternoon bulls twixt faculty and stu
dents to prove to the apathetic extremist that
education isn't as mechanized as he believes,
and that despite the apparent academic shell his
average prof not only knows what it's all about,
but is a pretty good guy despite it all.
But the griper won't be there.—G. F.
