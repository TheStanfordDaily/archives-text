# Roman Forum—1937

### 
THIS is a bullsession on bullsessioris. It
doesn't have anything to do with the column
nearby of that name, or anything to do with
what's happening in the news. It's just a bull
session about a bullsession, that's all—about the
one you were in last week.
To be typical this should start with politics,
then drift to religion and racial problems, then
shift to Stanford and finally to topic A.
But this bullsession is not typical. It doesn't
get to topic A, because this is the Stanford Daily
which is under the Ex Committee which wants
all bullsossions on topic A to bo kept under

cover. It's about the political, religious and
racial driftings of the one you had.
In that informal gathering at someone's room
more real thinking went on than transpires
within the intellectual walls of the Quad; think
ing that went deeper than memorization of notes
and glib regurgitation of same.
Here you thought because you wanted to
think, despite the fact that such thinking was
only a preliminary to less cultural, though per
haps more enlightening conversation.
Here, too, perhaps such interest was found
that the transgression to topic A was abandoned.
The bullsession is the proving ground for
college minds. Facts are furnished by the prof
and class; facts are turned into impressions,
ideas, and opinions in the lowly backroom bull.
Refutation, argument, and debate are the orders.
You give your idea, and I mine, now we
shuffle and here is the result—perhaps a con
crete solution to a present-day problem; per
haps the decision that life is futile, or that all
that counts is happiness.
Or sometimes the result may be confusion;
a rock dropped in the placid pools of thought to
send out wavelets of mental action. For two or
three days the confusion stays, and the mind
puzzles, till finally the solution, a self-concocted
one, appears.
The bullsession is the Roman Forum of the
American University. Here minds of the future
do their ground work. Here youth first tries
his hand at figuring what it's all about.
From these embryo impressions spring the
philosophies of tomorrow. —G. F.
