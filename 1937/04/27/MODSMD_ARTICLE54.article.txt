# OUR HASHER
## SATURATION AND SUNDAY 
### 
r | I HIS rainstorm has the drop on me,
I can't see why I can't see
Through the windshield I can't see.
This rainstorm has the drop on me.
April shouters bring May flouters,
Circus shouters sell the doubters
May flout doubt about the scouters,
Good scouts, bad scouts, snouters, pouters
Do their good twist daily, except saturation and
Sunday.
Rain, rain groan away,
Go over and rain on Berkeley.
Come again some other day,
Come again when you can't stay.
Berkeley, jerkily, quirkily,, is moist foist, anyway
Hurray.
For forty years behind the ears, wet.
What a lot of damp foolishness.
r FHIS spring shower that sprang springily upon the
campus caused no end of trouble, as you can read
ily, springily see by the above, but no end compared
to that of the firchouse ladder laddies.
In defiance of folkways, customs, and tradition, two
ladder laddies took up their beds and stalked out on
the roof of the smokehouse.
After cutting holes through walls and tearing out
the window sash in order to get their beds, mattresses,
and springs out on the roof, denying threats of cold and
mosquitoes, and laying beds that it wouldn't rain, the
ladder laddies woke up yesterday morning, like many
another campus roof sleeper and found that spring
had come up from behind and springled all over them.
A TELEPHONE call from the D. T. Delta house has
given me the hot tip, or the hot spot, that several
of the essential details in yesterday's story of the
D.T.D.-Sigma Nu Oh Baby party were inaccurate. In
many respects the story was a gross and impalpable
lie. In the first place, the car overturned in the drive
and not in the driveway. In the second place, the
Delts and not the Sigma Nus returned the car, and in
the third place the story was inaccurate. Well, that's
Sigma Nus to me.
