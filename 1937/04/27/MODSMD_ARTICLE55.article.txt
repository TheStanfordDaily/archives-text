# BULL SESSION
## I LIKE CAPITALISM FINE 
### 
/ \F LATE there has been a lot of talk about capital
ism, communism, Spain, Fascism, and what not.
The A.S.U. and the Spanish Loyalists think Commun
ism will save the world. 1 don't. Capitalism is the
answer to my troubles.
As a human being alive and wandering around on
the earth I want to get just as much out of it as I can.
So docs the next fellow and that makes the competi
tion tough. And that makes life a lot of fun.
* * * *
I suppose I could find joy within myself, but I'd
much rather get together a lot of money and then I
wouldn't have to worry about myself. I could worry
about some dope wanting most of it because he hasn't
any.
And because he has no money, nor ambition, nor
sense, he would call me an economic oppressor. So
what?
I want to get together the biggest pile of dough
you ever saw.
So that my family and friends and I and anyone
else who has enough sense to know what money means
could have one swell time spending it.
Under capitalism I could work like a madman and
get a lot of money. Under communism I'd work like a
madman.
* * * *
Now, under communism I might get ahead faster
than the other guys and then again I might not, but if
I did I still could never make anything. I would gain
only personal satisfaction, which doesn't do you any
good at all once you get used to it.
The way I figure it is that there are a whole lot
of persons in the world who are too lazy to try and
solve their own problems so (he best thing they can
do is sit down and try to figure out somebody else's
problems. How can they figure out my problems when
I can t figure them out myself. Maybe I don't even
want to figure them out.
* * * *
Why should I want to do what they tell me, make
a certain amount of money, eat certain foods, dress
in certain clothes, and act like everyone else. How
can anyone so standardize such a complex thing as
life to make it work for intellects of all descriptions.
Some persons like the movies. Some don't. Some
people like apple strudel. I don't.
Ever stand on the corner of Third and Mission and
try calling every man your brother?
Think it over.

The way I figure it is that there are a whole lot
of persons in the world who are too lazy to try and
solve their own problems so (he best thing they can
do is sit down and try to figure out somebody else's
problems. How can they figure out my problems when
I can t figure them out myself. Maybe I don't even
want to figure them out.
* * * *
Why should I want to do what they tell me, make
a certain amount of money, eat certain foods, dress
in certain clothes, and act like everyone else. How
can anyone so standardize such a complex thing as
life to make it work for intellects of all descriptions.
Some persons like the movies. Some don't. Some
people like apple strudel. I don't.
Ever stand on the corner of Third and Mission and
try calling every man your brother?
Think it over.

/ \F LATE there has been a lot of talk about capital
ism, communism, Spain, Fascism, and what not.
The A.S.U. and the Spanish Loyalists think Commun
ism will save the world. 1 don't. Capitalism is the
answer to my troubles.
As a human being alive and wandering around on
the earth I want to get just as much out of it as I can.
So docs the next fellow and that makes the competi
tion tough. And that makes life a lot of fun.
* * * *
I suppose I could find joy within myself, but I'd
much rather get together a lot of money and then I
wouldn't have to worry about myself. I could worry
about some dope wanting most of it because he hasn't
any.
And because he has no money, nor ambition, nor
sense, he would call me an economic oppressor. So
what?
I want to get together the biggest pile of dough
you ever saw.
So that my family and friends and I and anyone
else who has enough sense to know what money means
could have one swell time spending it.
Under capitalism I could work like a madman and
get a lot of money. Under communism I'd work like a
madman.
* * * *
Now, under communism I might get ahead faster
than the other guys and then again I might not, but if
I did I still could never make anything. I would gain
only personal satisfaction, which doesn't do you any
good at all once you get used to it.
