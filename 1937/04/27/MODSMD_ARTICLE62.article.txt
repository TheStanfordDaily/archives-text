# '40 Soakers Get Soaked By Sponsors
## 
### 
Encina sponsors are getting tough.
In the good old days last fall
naughty freshmen griped about four
hours. Now the only time they get
off with four hours is on Conval
escent Home Labor Day.
Playboys who throw water-bombs
now draw 15 hours and a trip to the
Dean. The sponsors give them 30
hours and a visit with President
Wilbur for shooting off fire-crack
ers. The same punishment goes for
even possessing fireworks. The
sponsors aren't so dumb.
Highest number of hours, though,
is given for moving cars into En
cina's lobby. Some laddies moved a
red Model T in late one Saturday
night, but they didn't get caught,
just threatened.
Freshmen are wondering what it
will take to bring out the state
militia.
