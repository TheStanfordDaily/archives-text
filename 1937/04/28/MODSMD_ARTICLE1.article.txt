# State Soaks Fraternities Hasher Tax
## Houses Must Contribute New Insurance Levies As Labor Employers 
### 
Stanford fraternities, sororities,
and eating clubs learned yesterday
that they are considered "employers"
by the State of California and must
therefore pay an unemployment tax
of from $50 to $100 for 1936.
John L. Sutton, deputy registrar
of the Unemployment Reserve Com
mission, met with the Interfratemity
Board of Control last night to notify
them of the new ruling.
All house and eating club man
agers must interview Mr. Sutton in
the A.S.S.U. offices of the Old Union
today or tomorrow from 1 to 6
o'clock. Each group must register
with him.
Includes All Workers
According to the tax official, each
house or eating club employing eight
or more persons is subject to the
tax, which amounts to 1.35 per cent
of the total payroll, or from $50 to
$100. Part-time workers—hashers,
house managers, cooks, secretaries—
are all included as "pex*sons em
ployed."
If employees are paid in room and
board, they are still subject to the
law. Of the total tax, "employer"
must pay two-thirds, "employee"
one-third. Payments for 1936 are
due immediately, according to Mr.
Sutton, in cash.
Students employed now are not
qualified to receive unemployment
benefits until after they leave school.
Then they may receive aid of from
$7 to $15 a week up to 30 weeks,
depending upon the length of time
they had previously paid the "in- j
surance."
Ruling New
The California commission had not
considered Greek societies and eat
ing clubs as subject to the act until
the Collector of Internal Revenue in
Washington made the ruling for the
Federal Social Security Act. The
California law is interrelated with j
the national act, the provisions be- |
ing the same.
The Collector of Internal Reve
nue's attention was brought to the
matter by the fraternities and so
rorities themselves. Their national
headquarters had advised them to
check on their status.
This new tax applies only to un
employment insurance. The living
groups are already paying an old
age pension tax.
