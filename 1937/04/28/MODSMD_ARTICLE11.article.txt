# STORK RIDES TROLLEY
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, April 27 (UP).â€”
The stork hopped aboard a street
car in downtown Los Angeles. Mrs.
Fanny Mitchel, 21, negress, and her
husband were returning from a visit
to a doctor who assured them the
stork wasn't due for some days yet.
It was at 12th and Central that the
stork caught up with and fooled the
doctor.
