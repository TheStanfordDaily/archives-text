# Reynolds Describes Latin America Tour
## 
### 
"The bed bugs were pretty aw
ful," said Student Body President
Jim Reynolds yesterday, as he told
about his month-long Central Amer
ican debate tour, which led him over
bumpy, narrow-gauge railroads to
bull sessions with university and
government officials and 'Mexican
students.
Accompanying him were Jim
Hill and Talbot Shelton. Shelton
left the party at Mexico City, and
Hill has gone on to Salvador before
starting back.
Having spent most of his time in
Mexico and Guatemala, Reynolds
was able to see many contrasts in
both the governments and univer
sities of the two countries.
Government Rules
The University of Mexico is abso
lutely autonomous, but in Guate
mala the university is directly under
the rule of the government. No
student associations of any sort are
allowed, because they have in the
past become politically minded.
"Under a dictatorship," says Rey
nolds, "they just don't stand for
such things as ridiculing public of
ficials."
The university at Mexico City, on
the other hand has the most student
government of all universities in
the world, says Reynolds. Half of
the members of their board of
trustees are students, who have as
much voting power as the other
members.
Takes Train
One high point of the tour was
the train ride from Mexico City to
Guatemala. "Everybody looked at

us as if we were crazy. It. seems,"
Reynolds explained, "that no one
makes the trip by train any more
except the very lowest classes."
Every time the train stopped,
people crowded up to sell food to
the passengers. Although the natives
didn't want their pictures taken, the
debaters were able to get some snaps
by using a mirror attachment and
pretending to take pictures of each
other.
While in Mexico, Reynolds had
several long talks with Muralist and
Painter Diego Rivera, with whom
Leon Trotsky is staying. They were
not able to meet Trotsky himself
because lie was ill, although they
had arranged for an interview
through the U. S. Secretary of State.
