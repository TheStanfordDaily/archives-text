# New Varsity Cagers Down Senior Squad
## Benefit for Convalescent Home Gives Departing Hoopmen Last Battle 
### WALT PETERSON 
Three chortling seniors and a
handful of mere little sophs fumbled
and scrambled and tore around for
40 minutes of furious basketball in
the Pavilion last night, with next
year's varsity winning the benefit
game 43 to 39.
With natty John Bunn refereeintj
with a stentorian voice, and with
the leading lady absent until the
second half, the game showed how
three has-beens can still dish it out
a little—Dinty Moore, Howie Turn
er, and Bill Quade. The boys that
used to play for Stanford had &

i field day in the first half, and closed
i the period leading 15-12, with the
help of Dick Lyon and Nellie
! Heath.
But they reckoned not with the
I mighty Hank Luisetti—he stalked in
! half an hour late, just in time to
| start the second half, and before
| you could say "rubber baby buggy
1 bumpei-s" the tide had turned. After
| successfully glueing up the works
I with lots of circulating and 12 points,
1 Horrible Hank stalked out again—
i this time in the company of Trainer
Leo Meyer to get an injured left leg
fixed. And Senior Track Manager
John Pirdy said, "There goes an
other good track man."
The senior team wanted to start
the game smoking Havanas, but one
of the fire laddies—there's one at
every game, you see—took away all
the stogies just after tftey were go
in' good. There is no smoking al
j lowed in the Pav, much to the
! players' disgust.
i Those who started for the varsity
! crew were Stoefen, Bob Zonne, Phil
| Zonne, Lee, and Calderwood. Gen
! eral utility subs were Kessel, Cal-
I kins, Rapp, and Huff.
