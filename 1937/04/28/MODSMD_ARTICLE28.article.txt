# Film Craftsmen Threaten Walkout
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, April 27 (UP). â€”
Threat of a crippling strike in the
movie industry by a walkout of film
painters and allied unions was
averted at least temporarily tonight
at a conference between union l*ep
resentatives and Pat Casey, labor
co-ordinatory for the Motion Pic
ture Producers' Association.
The Studio Federated Crafts,
composed of painters, make-up art
ists, scenic artists and hairdressers,
had threatened to walk out tomor
row unless granted a union shop.
None of the group is recognized in
the basic wage agreement under
which the studios deal with other
unions.
