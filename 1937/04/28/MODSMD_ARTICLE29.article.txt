NEW YORK, April 27 (UP). â€”
Amelia Earhart Putnam told the
United Press tonight that she "prob
ably" would resume her round-the
world flight from Burbank, Calif.,
the last of May.
Her husband, George Palmer Put
nam, the publisher, said the report
that his wife would resume her
flight on Saturday is "inaccurate
and fantastic." Amelia left here to
night for Washington. From there
she will go to Chicago and on to
Burbank.
