# Marital Study Recommended By Committee
## Marriage Course Awaits Wilbur's Approval For Addition to Curriculum 
### 
In answer to student demand for
courses relating to marriage and all
its various aspects, the Student-Fac
ulty Relations committee yesterday
drew up a recommendation to be
presented to Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur for a course in Human Rela
tions.
The recommendation is an out
growth of a petition submitted by
several students for an opportunity
to have this material presented, and
of favorable reports by faculty
members.
Combining material from practical
courses which have been successful
at other universities, the proposed
course, to be added to the curricu
lum if approved by Dr. Wilbur, will
be concerned primarily with mar
riage, including phases of social dis
eases, financing and personal bud
geting, parent education and child
training, and consumers' education.
The proposed course would be
given for five units, and would con
sist of lectures and discussion
groups. The latter would be divided
into mixed groups and others for
men and women separately.
