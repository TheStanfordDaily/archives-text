# Movies Bid For Roberta Semple
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD. April 27 (UP).â€”
Two Hollywood studios raced today
to make a movie star out of Roberta
Semple, pretty 27-year-old daugh
ter of Aimee Semple McPherson,
the evangelist.
The offers, as a result of the na
tional notoriety given Robeita in
the Angelus Temple courtroom
rows, came from 20th Century Fox
and Selznick International. Miss
Semple frowned on one of the bids
because she feared the scenario
would reflect upon her mother. The
plot would deal with a woman who
sacrificed her mother, daughter, and
friends for a church.
