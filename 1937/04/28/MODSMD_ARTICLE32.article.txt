# Negro Ideal Land Opposed by Hotels

### 
NEW YORK, April 27 (UP). —A
plan of Father Divine, negro cult
leader, to make all of Ulster County,
N.Y., a "promised land" — a model
co-operative community free from
competition — for his converts, met
opposition today from the civic or
ganizations of Kingston, the county's
largest city.
"The migration of thousands of
Harlem slum residents to a "model
paradise' here would ruin the hotel
and boarding house business
throughout the county," Harry G.
Lamothe, president of the Kingston
Chamber of Commerce, said.
