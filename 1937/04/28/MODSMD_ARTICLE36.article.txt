# Fouled Cord Cause Of 'Bat Man' Death
## 
### 
PARIS, April 27 (UP). â€” Twisted
parachute cords were blamed today
for the death of Clem Sohn, 26-year
old "bat man" of Lansing, Mich.
A coroner's inquiry established
that the first parachute he carried
failed to open because of tine twisted
cords and that the second parachute
because fouled with the first one.
Sohn fell 1000 feet Sunday after
he had glided down 9000 feet in 10
minutes on the "wings" which gave
him the name "bat man."
