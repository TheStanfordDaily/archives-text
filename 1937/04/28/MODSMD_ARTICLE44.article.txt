### 
LONDON, April 27 (UP). â€” The
Duke of Windsor's attorneys served
I a writ today on the Heinemann pub
j lishing house and Geoffrey Dennis,
; author, claiming damages in the
j book, "Coronation Commentary."
The writ charged libel and asked
an injunction against its circulation.
The book commented on the Duke
of Windsor's activities as king last
year and said that he spent most of
his time on the throne "muddling,
fuddling, and meddling."
It was understood that tHo writ
was served either because the pub
lishers did not make an apology or
had made one that was not satisfac
tory to the duke, although the book
was withdrawn.
j There were rumors also that
Heinemann's, the publishers, re
fused compensation for the alleged
I libel.
