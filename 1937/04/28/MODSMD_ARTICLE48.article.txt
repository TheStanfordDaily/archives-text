This guy Hilmer Lodge—he sure
gets his name in this paper, does
n't he?—told me I'm full of hot air
on the U.S.C. track situation. He's
not the only guy, you understand,
who told me so, but he's the only
one who seems to be really con
vinced that Stanford is going to whip
the Trojans come May 8.
Lodge says one of the Los An
geles papers carried the story, with
illustration, of how George Boone,
number three Troy sprint man, dis
located his knee and very probably
will be out of the meet next week.
That, for the present, takes two
men, Boone and Rosh Bush, away
from Dean Cromwell's squad, and
if things keep going at this rate,
Stanford is going to win that meet.
The persistence of Lodge is begin
ning to take a little hold on me. He
was positive of a strong Card win
over Cal, and he is just as sure of
a Stanford win over Troy. Maybe
he has something on the ball in
this track meet - prognosticating
racket.
He mentioned some wild-eyed
score yesterday—l don't think I'd
better mention it, everybody'd think
he was teched —but in making out
his early dope sheet he gave Stan
ford a second in the 220, which at
first doesn't sound so good and then
seems better on more thought.
Adrian Talley of the Trojans figures
for the first in the furlong, with the
times he's been making so far this
season, but Hilmer thinks that
Clark Crane of Troy can't beat Ray
Malott for the second place. Crane
has been running second to Talley
all year so far.
However, my bespectacled friend
is a southern Californian himself,
and he seems to know quite a lot
about Crane, and he still doesn't
think he can beat Ray. Well, as far
as that goes, Ray stepped a pretty
fair furlong at Berkeley, and he
can't be counted out of it yet, but
it's still a toss-up between the two.
Lodge is well acquainted with most
of the southerners—try and mention
the name of any runner of any con
sequence in California, even, and see
if he can't tell you something about
him.
That second-in-the-220-pick of
his is typical of a lot of his ideas.
At first they look kind of silly, and
then they grow on you. And if
Cromwell loses about one more
man, for instance one of his pole
vaulters, it's going to be an awful
temptation to side in with Hilmer.

A MOMENT'S
RESPITE—

The gals are putting out the paper
today, the one that comes out to
morrow morning, and they're taking
it over body and soul. Not even the
sports page, is immune, for Jean
Toffee has been named sports edi
tor and she will take over, of all
things, Sideline Slants for a day.

j There won't be a male member of
I the staff around, for they get a holi
day and a chance to catch up on a
1 slight bit of work while the gals are
j grinding out a colossal Daily.
This should be a golden opportu

| big break they have been looking
for for so long, and all that sort of

This guy Hilmer Lodge—he sure
gets his name in this paper, does
n't he?—told me I'm full of hot air
on the U.S.C. track situation. He's
not the only guy, you understand,
who told me so, but he's the only
one who seems to be really con
vinced that Stanford is going to whip
the Trojans come May 8.
Lodge says one of the Los An
geles papers carried the story, with
illustration, of how George Boone,
number three Troy sprint man, dis
located his knee and very probably
will be out of the meet next week.
That, for the present, takes two
men, Boone and Rosh Bush, away
from Dean Cromwell's squad, and
if things keep going at this rate,
Stanford is going to win that meet.
The persistence of Lodge is begin
ning to take a little hold on me. He
was positive of a strong Card win
over Cal, and he is just as sure of
a Stanford win over Troy. Maybe
he has something on the ball in
this track meet - prognosticating
racket.
He mentioned some wild-eyed
score yesterday—l don't think I'd
better mention it, everybody'd think
he was teched —but in making out
his early dope sheet he gave Stan
ford a second in the 220, which at
first doesn't sound so good and then
seems better on more thought.
Adrian Talley of the Trojans figures
for the first in the furlong, with the
times he's been making so far this
season, but Hilmer thinks that
Clark Crane of Troy can't beat Ray
Malott for the second place. Crane
has been running second to Talley
all year so far.
However, my bespectacled friend
is a southern Californian himself,
and he seems to know quite a lot
about Crane, and he still doesn't
think he can beat Ray. Well, as far
as that goes, Ray stepped a pretty
fair furlong at Berkeley, and he
can't be counted out of it yet, but
it's still a toss-up between the two.
Lodge is well acquainted with most
of the southerners—try and mention
the name of any runner of any con
sequence in California, even, and see
if he can't tell you something about
him.
That second-in-the-220-pick of
his is typical of a lot of his ideas.
At first they look kind of silly, and
then they grow on you. And if
Cromwell loses about one more
man, for instance one of his pole
vaulters, it's going to be an awful
temptation to side in with Hilmer.
