# Prophets Say Indian-Trojan Meet Toss-Up
## Grapevine Reports Bush, Boone Out of Scoring Distance with Injuries 
### 
Who is going to win that U.S.C. j
meet a week from Saturday, any
way? Nobody definitely wants to ,
I sayâ€”yet, but things are still hap
i pening to equalize the strength of |
| Coaches Templeton and Cromwell,
i Ross Bush, middle distance ace of
| Troy, will not run against Stanford, ;
! the Southern California grape-vine :
reports, as his leg ailment is keep- j
l ing him far enough from workouts ;
j to ruin his chances for big points, j
J And in addition, George Boone, j
I sprinter, has now pulled a muscle j
1 and also will be far from the score |
column if he runs at all.
Stanford, fingers crossed and still
without a major injury, due equally
j to luck and the fine Angell Field
running track, was doped by Don
Liebendorfer, off past records and
; nothing else, as some 15 points be
i hind the Trojans, figuring both |
| Bush and Boone to run.
If they don't, do you see the nat
ural the meet's going to become?
! Remember Schween, Hables, and
; the rest in that last great upset,
J 1933?
Last night, soft track and all,
I Templeton put Malott and Weier-

shauser through 49-second quarters,
McCurdy and Alexander through j
3:08 1320'5, and Burrows and March !
ran 3:14 at the same distance. Her- !
shey threw 48-5, Reynolds 47-6.

Auto accident deaths reached an
all-time high on California highways
in 1936 when 3,132 fatalities oc
curred.
