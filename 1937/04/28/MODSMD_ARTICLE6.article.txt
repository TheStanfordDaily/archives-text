# A.S.S.U. Dings 'Pink' Faction
## Ex Committee Quashes Standing Peace Board 
### 
Ex Committee last night downed
a proposal for a permanent A.S.S.U.
peace committee on the grounds that
the "radical element would give the
A.S.S.U. a bad name."
Though members agreed that
peace in itself was "a good thing,"
they failed to see the benefit of a
permanent peace committee. Stu
dent Manager Chuck Fontius did
not think last Thursday's Peace Day
was worth the $175 the student body
spent on it.
Caroline Moore, chairman of the
committee which planned last week's
Peace Day, had asked President Jim
Reynolds to make her committee
permanent.
That Stanford's "pink" faction will
fight for anything just to be fighting
was Ex Committee's opinion. The
attempt of certain American Stu
dent Union member's to push through
resolutions on the Peace Day assem
bly was offered as evidence of their
lack of co-operation.
Ex Committee agreed to let the
A.S.U. "scream all it wants" on its
own, but forbid it to link its name
with the Associated Students.
Other A.S.S.U. business included:
WOMEN'S ELECTIONS were
postponed until next Tuesday to
allow nominations for Senior Wom
an on Ex Committee to get on the
ballot.
GAIETIES SONGS sold better
than anyone expected. Bob Mallctt
announced a profit of $4.66, sug
gested that A.S.S.U. print the spring
show songs to sell at the perform
ance.
ENCINA CLL'IJ can give its spring
informal May 22.
WRESTLING AWARDS were
granted John Haffner, Jerry Tor
rance, and Dwight Zook. Wrestling
is still not a minor sport, was es
pecially recognized this year be
cause of exceptional talent.

A.S.S.U. a bad name."
Though members agreed that
peace in itself was "a good thing,"
they failed to see the benefit of a
permanent peace committee. Stu
dent Manager Chuck Fontius did
not think last Thursday's Peace Day
was worth the $175 the student body
spent on it.
Caroline Moore, chairman of the
committee which planned last week's
Peace Day, had asked President Jim
Reynolds to make her committee
permanent.
That Stanford's "pink" faction will
fight for anything just to be fighting
was Ex Committee's opinion. The
attempt of certain American Stu
dent Union member's to push through
resolutions on the Peace Day assem
bly was offered as evidence of their
lack of co-operation.
Ex Committee agreed to let the
A.S.U. "scream all it wants" on its
own, but forbid it to link its name
with the Associated Students.
Other A.S.S.U. business included:
WOMEN'S ELECTIONS were
postponed until next Tuesday to
allow nominations for Senior Wom

gested that A.S.S.U. print the spring
show songs to sell at the perform
ance.
ENCINA CLL'IJ can give its spring
