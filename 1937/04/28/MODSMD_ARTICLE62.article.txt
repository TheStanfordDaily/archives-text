# "One for the Money"

### 
STANFORD has two track plants.
One is Angell Field, often called "the finest
track in the West."
Angell Field has 2500 seats.
One is the Stanford Stadium—"the wind tun
nel"—reputedly a fair track made near impos
sible by excessive wind in the dash straight
away.
The Stadium has 83,000 seats.
A week from Saturday, Stanford and U.S.C.
are to have a track meet at Stanford. U.S.C. is
supposed to have the best track team in the
country. Stanford has one of the best.
These two "best track teams" will not meet
on "the best track in the West" but in the "wind
tunnel."
There, in the teeth of a crisp westerly breeze
that scoops down the stadium Walls, a group
of the country's finest runners (no exaggera
tion) will grind away —knowing that chances
for record times are practically nil. Records
have come few and far between in the "wind
tunnel."
And meanwhile, 500 yards away will be the
vacant Angell Field, "finest in the West," where
records would be menaced, perhaps broken. A
quiet Angell Field, no wind, no runners.
An immediate remedy for the problem isn't
to be had —Angell Field will not accommodate
the crowd at a U.S.C.-Stanford meet, and only
a roof could curb the Stadium wind.
But the eventual remedy is obvious. Angell
Field must have bleachers.
Enter now the traditional B.A.C. stymie in
effect—"We ain't got the dough, 'cause money
don't grow on trees, not even for the 8.A.C."
But on May 5, the B.A.C. meets to talk over
what it will do with the "dough" it has, and then
it could conceivably consider its bleacher di
lemma. It is estimated that $25,000 to $30,000
would build a 10,000-seat stand, on one side of
the field, adequate to handle present track
crowds.
The B.A.C. says it must first attend to its main
tenance — resurfacing the tennis courts, and
painting the stadium. With this we agree.
But there will be additional building, too, and
No. 1 on this docket is new bleachers for An
gell Field.
Meanwhile Stanford anxiously watches the
bulging cheeks of Aeolus while it hopes for a
calm day in the "wind tunnel'' a week from Sat
urday.
And the "finest track in the West" sits idle.—
G. F.
