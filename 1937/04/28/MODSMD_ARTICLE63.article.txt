AS FIRST Jimmy Dorsey, then Ray Noble are
signed to bring their expensive, big-time
orchestras to Stanford, Ex Committee and the
Administration have begun to ease their collars
a bit. They figure maybe things are getting too
hot.
What they see is a "vicious circle" of big
name orchestras—a situation in which no dance
will be a success unless it brags a bigger band
than the one before it.
Student Manager Fontius suggests a ruling
against big-time orchestras because of the
greatly increased expense on slim organization
budgets. The Administration sees Stanford's
traditional "democracy" toppling under higher
and higher priced dance bids. Campus orches
tras feel their business suffering from the influx
of outside smoothies.
But according to the people who buy the
bids, campus dancers do and will pay a little
more once in a while to enjoy a really good
orchestra. There has been no loss as yet from
dances hiring big-time orchestras.
Fontius' point is probably well taken when
he talks of a "vicious circle." With more and
more popular Eastern orchestras migrating to
California, dance chairmen will have little
trouble finding a good outside band when they
want one. And like any ordinary pocketbook,
Stanford's can only stand so much.
The solution to the whole situation exists
not in a big-time orchestra ban but in the
spreading out of the year's big dances, as some
Ex Committeemen suggest.
Of the year's five biggest dances, four are
spring quarter. Naturally when every one—
except the Masque Ball—clamor for big-time or
chestras, there's maybe too much of a good
thing.

But if the Senior Prom were scheduled in the
fall, the Soph Cotillion and Junior Prom in the
winter, and the Masque and Senior Balls in
the spring, the situation would take care of it
self.
Every one could hire Jimmy Dorsey or Ray
Noble without showing a loss, without upping
bid prices above the present scale.
The evil is the concentration, not the big
time bands themselves. —D. B.
