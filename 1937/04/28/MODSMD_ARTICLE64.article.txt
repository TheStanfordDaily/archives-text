# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
Presented here as a columnist in his own right
is a humble frosh, who seems to have caught some
of the blandness that makes Our Hasher as well as
the Decameron and Pilgrim's Progress. For the
purpose of public pique, he remains anonymous,
and will carry on Wednesdays and Fridays, when
the master goes to town.
A GENTLEMAN from Encina and a Lady from Roble
were quite well acquainted. He wasn't a butterfly
and he was aware that she was one of the more popu
lar. Anyway, come Thursday night, he telephoned
her:
"Hello, Janey! This is Joe. How are you?"
"Oh, hello, Joe, I haven't seen you in years. I'm fine
thanks. How are you?"
"Just fine, thanks, how are—l mean'er—Do you
know anyone who—that is—someone who hasn't a
date tomorrow night?"
"Why? Can't you find a date? Oh, yes. I guess I
do, at that. I'll try anyway. Don't expect anything
better than average, though."
"That's swell, Janey. I mean—that's swell Janey.
I'll see you later."
"Yeah, ring my room at 8 tomorrow night. Good
bye now."
Curtain to denote passage of 24 hours. Scene chang
es from two telephone booths to Roble lobby. Enter
Janey, ready to go out:
"Joe, I'm awfully sorry. I couldn't get anyone
else."
"Well, I guess it's all right." Expression—disap
pointment.
"If you want to though, uh —well."
"Yes?" Expression —hopeful.
"Well, I haven't a date tonight, and."
Expression—embarrassment.
A SUNDAY on Lagunita reveals fact and fantasy of
co-educational lfe on the pond. 'My most recent
Sabbath excursion to the "Sans-Souci" of Stanford
was more than satisfactory. While there I absorbed
more knowledge than ever before through the cover
of a book.
As I lay by the shore, day-dreaming and watching
the idle idlers idle, many visions of fair love passed
before my pensive eyes. Canoe after canoe paddled by
with rough after co-ed. A gentle wind, but not too gen
tle, was blowing from the West. A fine day for sailing,
thought I. And then I thought, no sails. And then I
looked and saw, and said aloud: "So this is Stanford."
Two maidens fair were using a canoe. One pad
dled in the stern. The other stood with all four feet
braced hard against the gunwales of the prow. Hex
head hung low; she used her skirt to catch the pres
sure of the breeze.
Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea ...

Sabbath excursion to the "Sans-Souci" of Stanford
was more than satisfactory. While there I absorbed
more knowledge than ever before through the cover
of a book.
As I lay by the shore, day-dreaming and watching
the idle idlers idle, many visions of fair love passed
before my pensive eyes. Canoe after canoe paddled by
with rough after co-ed. A gentle wind, but not too gen

thought I. And then I thought, no sails. And then I
looked and saw, and said aloud: "So this is Stanford."
Two maidens fair were using a canoe. One pad

"Why? Can't you find a date? Oh, yes. I guess I

better than average, though."
"That's swell, Janey. I mean—that's swell Janey.
I'll see you later."
"Yeah, ring my room at 8 tomorrow night. Good
bye now."

"Well, I guess it's all right." Expression—disap
