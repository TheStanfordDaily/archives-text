# BULL SESSION
## ENCOURAGEMENT NOTE 
### 
\ DJECTIVE-WEARY magazine readers received a
considerable shock reecntly when an advertise
ment booming Southern California proclaimed with
candid sportsmanship, "We have our faults."
It's too bad that this paragon of advertising copy
did not stop there, thus laying the basis for a claim
to immortality.
But even shrouded in glowing language, it strikes
one of the few hopeful notes in this dark age of
alarums and excursions. Insincere though it probably
is, it indicates recognition of the folly of sectional con
ceit.
* * * *
Primary among the reasons why this era is one of
weeping, wailing, and teeth gnashing is the intense
sectionalism which has made mockery of the word
co-operation. Nations, economically inter-dependent,
work overtime trying to cut each others' throats. One
can accept the idea of a God of many aspects; but
when each of a dozen brawling countries firmly as
serts that its culture, and only its culture, is directly
subsidized by the Almighty, a sceptical attitude is
pardonable.
Not too serious, perhaps, but closer to home, is the
cunning game of slug-thy-neighbor that goes on be
tween the sections of countries. The howl of the tax
payer seeking its young, for exemptions, is a gratified
mew, compared to the bleat that goes up from Maine's
rockbound shores when California gets a WPA proj
ect. And as Maine blows off, so blows the Union;
California's sun-tanned lungs are also remarkably
suited to howling.

question of states rights in this country was
settled, messily but thoroughly, by the Civil War,
and we arc taught in high school that the various com
monwealths have lived in touching harmony and broth
erly love ever since. In college we leam that faith in
such teachings is slightly naive.
True, there is no more talk of secession, but of
brotherly love there is hardly a surplus. Each section
of the country seems to feel that its own little part of
creation is "God's country," and that its own customs
and methods are positively the only route to Heaven
—assuming that Heaven is more desirable.
Amidst all the tumult and shouting which arises
from the clash of such opinions, it is comforting to find
a voice that says, even with qualifications, "We have
our faults." Such an attitude is the first step toward
eliminating the faults. If sincere, it is the beginning
of a rational evaluation and adaptation of other ideas
and standards.

{ IF COURSE, this one voice, crying amid the wilfull
ness, is hardly a cause for bank holidays and
dancing in the streets. In the United States, there is
little real difference between sections, and the strife is
all verbal. Other countries are not so fortunate, and
internationally, the prospect is as black as a negro
coal heaver.
If any nation of the world should admit that it has
faults, the diplomatic corps would be wiped out by
apoplexy. But we need lose no sleep worrying about
our diplomats, busily engaged in arranging pari
mutuel odds on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
—War, Famine, Pestilence, Death.
Even so, in these days of riot and revolution, when
the world seems suffering from an over-dose of con
ceit and self-satisfaction, it is reassuring to hear a
voice, however commercialized, that says, "We have
our faults."
