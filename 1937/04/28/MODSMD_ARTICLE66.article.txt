### Clipped by JAMES STONE 
Classical and semi-classical (of
the better sort) programs on the ail
tonight come at the same time . . .
Lily Pons with Andre Kostelanetz'
orchestra, over KSFO, and Frank
Black and the String Symphony over
KGO will be heard at 5:00 . . . The
latter program will include a seldom
heard Bach chorale-prelude and a
transcription of Beethoven's Pas
toral Sonata.
Fred Allen carries on, introducing
Ruby Elzy, the lead in New York's
production of "Porgy and Bess" . . .
She sings some of the music from
that show ... As usual, at 8 over
KPO.
Taking a cue from "Tobacco
Road," Ken Murray has to go one
step further with "Tomato Road" to
night . . . 8:30 on KSFO . . . Shirley
Ross will be around, and Lud Glus
kin plays that Raymond Scott num
ber, "Twilight in Turkey" . . . And
then there's Jessica Dragonette,
singing with Charles Kullman on
the "Beauty Box Theater" at 5:30
over KSFO . . . another reproduc
tion of a Broadway musical produc
tion.
It's not radio but the announce
ment that Sidney Kingsley's Broad
way sensation, "Dead End," opens
at the Curran in San Francisco is
important ... It starts for a limited
engagement on Monday, May 17 . . .
That's one for which you'll have to
get your tickets early.
