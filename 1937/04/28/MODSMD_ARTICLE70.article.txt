# Campus Man Honored As Father of Propellor

### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Soaring in over the Golden Gate
from new routes in the South Pa
cific, the giant China Clipper dips
to San Francisco, settles down gent
ly onto the Bay at Alameda.
Three thousand miles away, the
massive new Queen Mary slips
through Long Island Sound into her
berth at New York.
Had William Frederick Durand
turned to gardening or statesman
ship instead of coming to Stanford
as professor of engineering 33 years
ago, the Clipper propellers might
never have purred across the Pa
cific, or the Queen Mary's propellers
churned across the Atlantic.
For it was this remarkable engi
neer's research in aerodynamics
and, earlier, in ship propulsion, that
enables modern aviation and marine
builders to construct the mighty
ships that they do.
Honor Guest at Dinner
A week from Friday night engi
neers and educators from all over
the world will gather around a San
Francisco dinner table to honor Dr.
William Frederick Durand's out
standing success in the field of men
and machines.
Harry F. Guggenheim, leading
American industrialist and financier
of aeronautical research, will fly out
from New York to preside. Herbert
Hoover and Captain Edwin C. Mu
sick of the China Clipper will speak
in honor of their friend.
Besides these great men, hundreds
of Dr. Durand's former students,
now outstanding engineers and ex
ecutives in every part of the world,
have been invited to the dinner.
Prefers Teaching
''Teaching was my really import
ant work," Dr. Durand declares.
"All this" — pointing to his great
contributions to marine and air
transportation—"was merely a side
line."
Ever since he graduated from An
napolis in 1880, Dr. Durand has
been interested in men. At Michi
gan, and later at Stanford, he al
ways augmented his research and
teaching with an active interest in
student affairs.
Headed Committee
As head of the Student Affairs
Committee during his first years on
the Farm, he eased many a ticklish
situation between students and Ad
ministration. The men he has taught
have looked to him as more than a
teacher. "He," they declare warmly,
"has been a real friend."
Holder of many awards and hon
ors for engineering triumphs, Dr.
Durand has long been an official ad
viser to the federal government in

air and ocean matters. Since retir
ing from active teaching in 1925, he
has spent more and more time delv
ing into research, is at present pres
ident of the important World Power
Conference.

now outstanding engineers and ex
ecutives in every part of the world,
have been invited to the dinner.
Prefers Teaching
''Teaching was my really import
ant work," Dr. Durand declares.
"All this" — pointing to his great
contributions to marine and air
transportation—"was merely a side
line."
Ever since he graduated from An
napolis in 1880, Dr. Durand has
been interested in men. At Michi
gan, and later at Stanford, he al
ways augmented his research and
teaching with an active interest in
student affairs.
Headed Committee
As head of the Student Affairs
Committee during his first years on
the Farm, he eased many a ticklish
situation between students and Ad
ministration. The men he has taught
have looked to him as more than a
teacher. "He," they declare warmly,
"has been a real friend."
Holder of many awards and hon
ors for engineering triumphs, Dr.
Durand has long been an official ad
viser to the federal government in

air and ocean matters. Since retir
ing from active teaching in 1925, he
has spent more and more time delv
ing into research, is at present pres
ident of the important World Power
Conference.
Soaring in over the Golden Gate
from new routes in the South Pa
cific, the giant China Clipper dips
to San Francisco, settles down gent
ly onto the Bay at Alameda.
Three thousand miles away, the
massive new Queen Mary slips
through Long Island Sound into her
berth at New York.
Had William Frederick Durand
turned to gardening or statesman
ship instead of coming to Stanford
as professor of engineering 33 years
ago, the Clipper propellers might
never have purred across the Pa
cific, or the Queen Mary's propellers
churned across the Atlantic.
For it was this remarkable engi
neer's research in aerodynamics
and, earlier, in ship propulsion, that
enables modern aviation and marine
builders to construct the mighty
ships that they do.
Honor Guest at Dinner
A week from Friday night engi
neers and educators from all over
the world will gather around a San
Francisco dinner table to honor Dr.
William Frederick Durand's out
standing success in the field of men
and machines.
Harry F. Guggenheim, leading
American industrialist and financier
of aeronautical research, will fly out
from New York to preside. Herbert
Hoover and Captain Edwin C. Mu
sick of the China Clipper will speak
in honor of their friend.
Besides these great men, hundreds
of Dr. Durand's former students,
now outstanding engineers and ex
ecutives in every part of the world,
have been invited to the dinner.
