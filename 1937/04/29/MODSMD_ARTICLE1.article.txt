# Farm Organizations Will Protest Against Social Security Tax
## Government Levy Affecting Officers May Be Appealed at Hearing 
### 
Objections to the proposed unemployment tax to be levied on fraterni
ties, sororities and sating clubs will be made in the form of a petition to
the Unemployment Reserve Commission for a hearing, according to action
decided upon yesterday by nlterfraternity Board of Control.

First news of the tax came yester
day when John L. Sutton, deputy
registrar of the commission, ar
rived on campus to register all
groups employing more than eight
persons. These are subject to taxes
imposed by the Federal Social Se
curity Act, and the California act
based on similar provisions.

The objection raised by the Stan
ford groups rests on the fact that
honorary officers of the organiza
tions, who do not. receive a salary
or any remuneration, nevertheless
are included as employees and
would have to pay the unemploy
ment tax.
Purpose of the proposed hearing
will be to request the exclusion of
honorary officers from tax, and thus
make most of the organizations ex
empt, since a majority of them do
not employ eight persons outside of
the officers.
According to Mr. Sutton, 18 or
ganizations, about half of those
listed, registered with him yester
day. The majority of those regis
tered will not be subject to 1936
tax, he said, if the petition goes
through. However, he refused to say
which organizations woulu probably
have to pay the tax regardless of the
outcome of the hearing.
Mr. Sutton will be in the A.S.S.U.
office again today from 1 to 6 o'clock
to register the remaining organiza
tions.
