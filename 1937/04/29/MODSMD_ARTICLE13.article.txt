# Spring Play Entertaining Declares Gist
## Chappie Editor Praises Production; Advises All Students To Attend 
### 
" 'Lady Precious Stream' looks as
if it will be a very amusing play,"
announced Chappie Editor Gilman
Gist last night, following his pre
view of Dramatic Council's spring
production. "Whether or not it is
intentional, the acting takes on the
cloak of a caricature of Chinese man
nerisms.
"This is possibly the result of the
quick training in fan-dancing given
the actors by our friend from China,
Francis Wu. Anyway," he added,
"the effect, though graceful and
verging on the poetic, is still full of
rollicking fun."
Play Entertaining
Although Gist has not read the
script of the play and saw only a
portion, he claims that it looks as if
it might be very entertaining if not
"high art."
As he says, "After all that's what
the Dramatic Council seems to think
puts over the plays around here.
Perhaps they are ignorant of the
fact that 'high art' in the theater is
usually funnier when funny, more
beautiful when lyrical, more true
when it speaks, and certainly more
vital when it thinks, than any of the
lighter stuff we've been getting for
the last four or five years."
Actors Good
In conclusion Gist recommended
attendance at "Lady Precious
Stream." "It looks good," he de
clared. "Jim Corner, Phyllis Lakin,
Brobury Ellis look good. And if
the choice of the play is really
good, Mr. Lange will look good, too."
Tickets for the production, to be
presented Friday and Saturday
nights in the Assembly Hall, may
