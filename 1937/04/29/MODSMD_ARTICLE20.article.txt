# Ladies of Press Publish 'Daily'
## 
### 
Ladies of the press had full
charge of the Daily Shack last
night in putting out today's
Women's Edition. While the
men of the staff enjoyed their
vacation, the women chewed
pencils and plunked a few
typewriters amid the unusually
quiet atmosphere of the Shack.
Not only were they fully able
to struggle along without help
from the men, but a sign tacked
on the door announced that
any member of the so-called
sterner sex risking entrance
would be fined "anywhere from
a dime to a quarterâ€”acord
ing to the mood we're in."
