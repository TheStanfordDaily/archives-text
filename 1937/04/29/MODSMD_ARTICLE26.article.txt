# Washington Raps; Stocks Hit Low
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 28 (U.R). â€”
Stocks today broke to new lows
since last October in heavy selling.
Selling waves hit the market at in
tervals. In the last half hour prices
plunged to new depths. Tickers fell
several minutes behind.
Short selling was a factor, but more
important was margin selling and
uncovering of stop loss orders. There
was some liquidation of accounts and
stocks were dumped on the market.
The break was ascribed mainly to
the latest warning against specula
tion issued in Washington. Somo
traders sold also in disappointment
over the $5.75 dividend declared on
U.S. Steel preferred. They had an
ticipated full payment of arrears on
the issue even if it were necessary
for the corporation to draw on sur
plus.
