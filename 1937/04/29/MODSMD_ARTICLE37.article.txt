KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 28
(UP). —The government asked Le
roy M. Norton, manager of the
United Thread Mills plant, to sub
mit a bid to the Works Progress Ad
ministration for thread to be used
in a sewing project. After plodding j
through several pages of specifica- \
tions, Norton found the total order i
amounted to 100 yards—about two
small spools.
The Druids regarded mistletoe as i
a cure for all disease.
