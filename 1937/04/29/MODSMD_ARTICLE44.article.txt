# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### 
TIIANKS,
PKU<:

Thanks for the send-off, Mr. Pet
erson.
After our feeble feminine mind
went over it several times and hon
estly tried to digest the material, we
think —at least, we think we can
think —we detect just the slightest
note of sarcasm, we think. (See
Tuesday's Slants.)
We admit a woman sports editor
is a bit of a curiosity in the news
paper world, but we re all lor this
thing called experience and, any
way, it's nice to see our thinks in
print even ii they do have to go in
Sideline Slants.
Getting around to the plugging of
women's sports, so noticeably lack
ing on most sport pages—mind you,
we mention no names —we've made
a inild survey (apologies to Ex
Committee) among the co-eds we
know and found a goodly number
who peruse the sport columns quite
frequently. Be reasonable, now,
isn't it natural that they might want
to get a slant now and then on what's
doing around the Women's Gym as
well as the low-down on who ran
what in so many seconds flat or who
hit how many homers during the
baseball season?

NICE GOING
ROBLE

Just to prove our point, here's a
yarn that should rate space even in
a man's column.
Nancy Hurst, Robleite, holds the
unofficial course record for women
;il the Stanford golf course. Her
score is 78, one stroke less than
the official mark for the 18 holes.
A future Glenna Collet, maybe?

UP THE
LADDER

Attracting a lot of attention over
at the Women's Gym these days are
the all-University women's tennis
championships, now in full swing.
Topping the ladder, and favored
to stay there, is Betty Pearce, de
fending champion. She isn't in
vincible though, for she was beaten
last year by Elizabeth Resting, now
a graduate.
Close behind Betty and going
strong are Patsy Kennedy, Barbro
Biorkman, and Ann Ellinwood.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S TRUE

You may not believe this, but
our oh, s« terrifically masculine
sports editor just asked our advice
about getting a pale blue shirt to
go with a white detachable collar.
Invading feminine territory, wc call
it.
Now it's your turn, Pete.

vincible though, for she was beaten
last year by Elizabeth Resting, now
a graduate.
Close behind Betty and going
strong are Patsy Kennedy, Barbro
Biorkman, and Ann Ellinwood.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
IT'S TRUE

You may not believe this, but
our oh, s« terrifically masculine
sports editor just asked our advice
about getting a pale blue shirt to
go with a white detachable collar.
Invading feminine territory, wc call
it.
Now it's your turn, Pete.

TIIANKS,
PKU<:

Thanks for the send-off, Mr. Pet
erson.
After our feeble feminine mind
went over it several times and hon
estly tried to digest the material, we
think —at least, we think we can
think —we detect just the slightest
note of sarcasm, we think. (See
Tuesday's Slants.)
We admit a woman sports editor
is a bit of a curiosity in the news
paper world, but we re all lor this
thing called experience and, any
way, it's nice to see our thinks in
print even ii they do have to go in
Sideline Slants.
Getting around to the plugging of
women's sports, so noticeably lack
ing on most sport pages—mind you,
we mention no names —we've made
a inild survey (apologies to Ex
Committee) among the co-eds we
know and found a goodly number
who peruse the sport columns quite
frequently. Be reasonable, now,
isn't it natural that they might want
to get a slant now and then on what's
doing around the Women's Gym as
well as the low-down on who ran
what in so many seconds flat or who
hit how many homers during the
baseball season?

NICE GOING
ROBLE

Just to prove our point, here's a
yarn that should rate space even in
a man's column.
Nancy Hurst, Robleite, holds the
unofficial course record for women
;il the Stanford golf course. Her
score is 78, one stroke less than
the official mark for the 18 holes.
A future Glenna Collet, maybe?

UP THE
LADDER

Attracting a lot of attention over
at the Women's Gym these days are
the all-University women's tennis
championships, now in full swing.
Topping the ladder, and favored
to stay there, is Betty Pearce, de
fending champion. She isn't in
vincible though, for she was beaten
last year by Elizabeth Resting, now
a graduate.
Close behind Betty and going
strong are Patsy Kennedy, Barbro
Biorkman, and Ann Ellinwood.
