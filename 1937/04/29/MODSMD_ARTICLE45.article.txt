# Team Begins Spring Work On Grid Meld
## Thornhill Hopeful When Capable Squad Turns Out, Shows Promise 
### Estelle Seid 
The Stanford football team may
, climb out of the Cellar.
Spring practice is in full swing
and the prospects look pretty fair.
According to Coach Tiny Thornhill
1 the backfield lines up in good form,
since there are more men out for
the positions of fullback and half
j back than last year.
Ends Are Problem
Thornhill's main problem at this
point is the position of end. Three
iettermen, Jack Clark, Neil Rasmus
sen, and Grant Stone, are returning,
but as yet there has been little
I chance to develop freshmen in that
I position.
One line out looks all right but
as yet the substitute lines have not
been .showing much. The coach be
lieves that some of the linemen will
develop, but will not know until the
end of spring practice.
Paulman liatk
There has been a lot of shifting of
positions in the line to find places
for the gridders. Guards have taken
over tackle and end positions.
Stan Anderson, frosh trackman,
looks good as a football man, and
Bill Paulman, who was out last year
because of injuries, will be back for
practice.
There will be no scrimmage for
the teams until next week.
