# Peace Council Is Perpetuated
## Permanent Body Seeks Students' Support 
### 
Organization of a permanent peace
committee, to be known as the Stan
ford Peace Council, was begun last
night at a meeting of committee
members in the Women's Clubhouse.
Jackie Brown was elected chair
man of the new organization, which
declared its intention of functioning
as an independent unit, with no offi
cial connection with the A.S.S.U.
Executive board of the new Coun
cil v/ill consist of a small body of
students representative of living
groups and interested organizations
throughout the campus. Present
committee members expressed their
desire for majority student repre
sentation and participation.
Round Tables Criticized
Suggestions for improvements of
peace action in the next year were
evolved through dissatisfaction ex
pressed with the fact that last week's
activities tended more to stimulate
those students already interested in
the prevention of war than toj edu
cate and awaken the entire campus
to existing problems of peace. That
the proceedings were not futile was
emphasized by the fact that nearly
400 students, approximately twice as
many as last ytseu, attended the
j round tables after the assembly.
Criticisms of the round tables were
that they were more in the form of
I lectures than discussions, and that
! the time allowed was too short to
i permit thorough coverage of the
subject with individual participa
tion. The assembly was cited also
i for informing students without per-
I mitting them self-expression.
Asks Co-operation
Carolyn Moore, chairman of the
recent Peace Day Committee, wished
I it emphasized that the committee
i spent only $110 of A.S.S.U. funds, not
j $175 as was previously stated; and
that the committee has never asked
to be a subdivision of the A.S.S.U.,
desiring only its friendly co-opera
! tion. The co-operation idea was
further stressed at the meeting
when members made it clear that
I they were not antagonistic to the
I Administration, merely seeking its
i co-operation in opposing war and
! conscription.
As a means of promoting continual
i growth of its ideas among all stu
dents rather than momentary stimu
lation of a minority group, the
permanent Peace Council plans a
j monthly peace forum during the
coming year.

peace action in the next year were
evolved through dissatisfaction ex
pressed with the fact that last week's
activities tended more to stimulate
those students already interested in
the prevention of war than toj edu
cate and awaken the entire campus
to existing problems of peace. That
the proceedings were not futile was
emphasized by the fact that nearly
400 students, approximately twice as
many as last ytseu, attended the
j round tables after the assembly.
Criticisms of the round tables were
that they were more in the form of
I lectures than discussions, and that
! the time allowed was too short to
i permit thorough coverage of the
subject with individual participa
tion. The assembly was cited also
i for informing students without per-
I mitting them self-expression.
Asks Co-operation
Carolyn Moore, chairman of the
recent Peace Day Committee, wished
I it emphasized that the committee
i spent only $110 of A.S.S.U. funds, not
j $175 as was previously stated; and
that the committee has never asked
to be a subdivision of the A.S.S.U.,
desiring only its friendly co-opera
! tion. The co-operation idea was
further stressed at the meeting
when members made it clear that
I they were not antagonistic to the
I Administration, merely seeking its
i co-operation in opposing war and
! conscription.
As a means of promoting continual
i growth of its ideas among all stu
dents rather than momentary stimu
lation of a minority group, the
permanent Peace Council plans a
j monthly peace forum during the
coming year.
