# Queen for a Day
## 
### 
Dear eis:
Tonight is my night . . . mine and that
of the other women on The Daily staff. This one
night of the year we have our fling, take over
the reins, become the guiding power in the
"Shack." One night out of 365, women have
some say as to how the campus newspaper
is to be run.
The days of the "500" are gone, whether we
like it or not. Stanford is no longer a man's
university now that one-fourth of the student
body is comprised of women, yet The Daily
continues to be the stronghold of the male, to
represent only a portion of the Stanford stu
dents.
Women have shown that they can manage
the Concert Series as ably, if not more ably,
than the men. The Quad is being edited by a
woman. Yet the mere suggestion that a woman
be made editor of The Daily is hooted down by
you egotistical males.
Up to the point where promotion leads from
Night Editorship to Women's Editor or Asso
ciate Editor, as the paper is now organized, the
men and women are on an equal basis. They
do approximately the same work at the same
time, and whether they do it well or poorly
depends not on their sex but on the individual.
Sometimes a man is the best Night Editor, some
times a woman, but it is ability, and ability
alone, that is the criterion.
Not that every woman on the staff is capable
of being editor, or has the time or the desire to
hold the position. But that is no reason why
someone who does qualify should be denied
the opportunity, or why the women should not
have some part in determining paper policy.
Therefore, Eis, let's reorganize The Daily and
give the women a true representative on the
paper instead of a figurehead. The "1100" can
no longer be ignored.
"Sweetie"
