# You're the Steam-Shovel
## 
### 
OUT on Governor's Lane a little man sits in
his little steam-shovel and shovels hunks
of loose dirt into little trucks lined up waiting
for him. Only sometimes there aren't any little
trucks waiting for him, so he just sits and
bounces the shovel's bucket up and down on
the loose dirt, or waves it from side to side, or
else he just sits.
Which is all very fine for a man and his
steam-shovel.
But unfortunately there is a striking similarity
between the steam-shovel man and the average
student, except that the student handles ideas
instead of unadulterated mud.
As long as there is some waiting receptacle
for these ideas he may take a handful of ran
dom thoughts and hurl it in that general direc
tion. But as soon as his audience has left him,
and he is alone with no one to make noises at,
the so-called thought processes cease function
ing, and he sits bouncing his mental bucket up
and down on vapid nothingness. Or else he
just sits.
This is still very fine for the little steam
shovel man since after his little trucks leave him
there is nothing much else he can do. But when
a student will only sit and vegetate when there
is no external presence urging him on toward
manipulation of his intellectual steam-shovel,
that is a different matter.
Then again, the steam - man only
scrapes across the surface of his pile to collect
a load to chuck at his trucks. And so does the
student, collecting* a load of superficial and
meaningless verbiage to dump upon his hear
ers. But, whereas the shovel's bucket would be
come hopelessly involved if it dug down too
deep, a student should certainly be able to dig
below the mossy surface of his intellectual dirt
pile without his mechanism becoming caught
and lost in its shifting sands.
But after all, the little steam-shovel man's
only objective is to get his load simply and
undramatically into his little trucks. The stu
dent on the contrary seems to believe that a
similar presentation of basic facts, ideas, and
ideals would be contrary to his self-appointed
objective of establishing himself as a "good
fellow" with a "good line" through means of
these multiple, vacuous bucket - scrapings. —

and down on vapid nothingness. Or else he
just sits.
This is still very fine for the little steam
shovel man since after his little trucks leave him
there is nothing much else he can do. But when
a student will only sit and vegetate when there
is no external presence urging him on toward
manipulation of his intellectual steam-shovel,
that is a different matter.
Then again, the steam - man only
scrapes across the surface of his pile to collect
a load to chuck at his trucks. And so does the
student, collecting* a load of superficial and
meaningless verbiage to dump upon his hear
ers. But, whereas the shovel's bucket would be
come hopelessly involved if it dug down too
deep, a student should certainly be able to dig
below the mossy surface of his intellectual dirt
pile without his mechanism becoming caught
and lost in its shifting sands.
But after all, the little steam-shovel man's
only objective is to get his load simply and
undramatically into his little trucks. The stu
dent on the contrary seems to believe that a
similar presentation of basic facts, ideas, and
ideals would be contrary to his self-appointed
objective of establishing himself as a "good
fellow" with a "good line" through means of
these multiple, vacuous bucket - scrapings. —
