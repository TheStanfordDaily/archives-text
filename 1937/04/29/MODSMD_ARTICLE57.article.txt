in order of preference the po-
LJ sitions or duties you will accept, please

fied —" So reads one of the questions in the
application for permanent positions, to be filled
out for the Stanford appointment bureau. Wom
en, unless they have taken an education course,
generally just sit and wonder why, after four
years at an institution of higher learning, they
cannot answer this simple question.
For the girl who wants to work, there is really
nothing offered. Shorthand and typing are re
quired for almost any kind of a position, but the
administration frowns upon such courses as too
practical, and non-cultural. There are colleges
and universities which provide a regular secre
tarial curriculum, few, I admit, but some. Stan
ford may be still laboring under the impression
that it is a rich man's (woman's) school, and that
its graduates will not have to work for a living.
Yet it claims to be democratic, and not to frown
on those who must support themselves.
Stanford has a fine reputation, and its gradu
ates are in demand (so I hear). All well and
good, but a girl cannot walk into a business
office and murmur the magic word "Stanford,"
and expect to be given a $2000 a year job. No,
the business man will ask if she has had expe
rience, if she can take dictation, and if she can
type.
There's nothing more depressing for a senior
woman than to wander up to San Francisco, and
find one of the most prominent women of last
year's senior class working in the basement of
some department store. I am not trying to infer
that Stanford women do not have good jobs,
because a great many of them do. But most of
these had to take up secretarial work, merchan
dising, or some other commercial study before
obtaining their positions.
The Business School is hardly the answer to
the women's problem, as it goes deeper than
secretarial work, and takes more time to com
plete the course than most women desire to
spend. At a good secretarial school she can be
ready for work in six months. Then why, you
say, go to college at all—for background, of
course—but who can eat background?—N. C.

on those who must support themselves.
Stanford has a fine reputation, and its gradu
ates are in demand (so I hear). All well and
good, but a girl cannot walk into a business
office and murmur the magic word "Stanford,"
and expect to be given a $2000 a year job. No,
the business man will ask if she has had expe
rience, if she can take dictation, and if she can
type.
There's nothing more depressing for a senior
woman than to wander up to San Francisco, and
find one of the most prominent women of last
year's senior class working in the basement of
some department store. I am not trying to infer
that Stanford women do not have good jobs,
because a great many of them do. But most of
these had to take up secretarial work, merchan
dising, or some other commercial study before
obtaining their positions.
The Business School is hardly the answer to
the women's problem, as it goes deeper than
secretarial work, and takes more time to com
plete the course than most women desire to
spend. At a good secretarial school she can be
ready for work in six months. Then why, you
say, go to college at all—for background, of
course—but who can eat background?—N. C.
