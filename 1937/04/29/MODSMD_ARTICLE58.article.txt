"Honorable conduct in academic work is the spirit
of conduct at Stanford University."
Translated into the language of the college student,
this means "nounpermittedaidgivenorreceived" scrib
bled at the end of examinations on the pink and yellow
blue books or written legibly before starting with a
childlike faith in one's own self.
I am not naive enough to believe that this inscrip
tion influences the average student. If one is honest
one does not cheat, if one is dishonest one will have no
scruples about signing a pledge.
The very essence of the statement is a doubt of my
own integrity. I do not cheat. I resent being made to
admit that during the past hour I have been in the
path of a great temptation and that the thought of
an enforced honor code and not my own personal re
spect has been my sole salvation.
* * * *
Now let's read the front of the vari-colored exam
ination booklets. Why not suggest sitting every 10
seats, five rows apart, and come equipped with blind
ers? It's just as silly. It is natural to spread out for
elbow room —but why spread it across the cover of
the blue book?
No aid given nor received on term papers. Why
not? You quote professors, you quote books, you quote
authorities. Why is it wrong to believe that fellow
students have opinions that may be worthwhile con
cerning world affairs.
At the present time some of the departments are not
returning themes. This eliminates the evil of copying
from year to year . . . but time marches on—the pro
fessors go on forever.
Why not change the subjects of those term papers
once in a while, oh most wise purveyors of high learn
ing? Sophomores have been writing on "Why I Came
to College" for generations. Give the poor kids a
break and you won't find yourselves so bored reading
the same stuff year in and year out.

But this is the women's edition. The honor code
applies only to academic work and the library. Maybe
you hadn't heard of it but there is a fundamental
standard of honor also. This includes "conduct unbe
coming a Stanford woman" which is ? You tell me.
I don't get drunk. I don't go to Carmel on week-ends.
So who am I to condemn my fellow man for some
thing they believe perfectly right? Who arc my fellow
men to condemn me? Who is Women's Council? They
arc preparing us morally to live better lives in the
oreat wonderful world outside—college is the living
est thing we do.

But this is the women's edition. The honor code
applies only to academic work and the library. Maybe
you hadn't heard of it but there is a fundamental
standard of honor also. This includes "conduct unbe
coming a Stanford woman" which is ? You tell me.
I don't get drunk. I don't go to Carmel on week-ends.
So who am I to condemn my fellow man for some
thing they believe perfectly right? Who arc my fellow
men to condemn me? Who is Women's Council? They
arc preparing us morally to live better lives in the
oreat wonderful world outside—college is the living
est thing we do.

"Honorable conduct in academic work is the spirit
of conduct at Stanford University."
Translated into the language of the college student,
this means "nounpermittedaidgivenorreceived" scrib
bled at the end of examinations on the pink and yellow
blue books or written legibly before starting with a
childlike faith in one's own self.
I am not naive enough to believe that this inscrip
tion influences the average student. If one is honest
one does not cheat, if one is dishonest one will have no
scruples about signing a pledge.
The very essence of the statement is a doubt of my
own integrity. I do not cheat. I resent being made to
admit that during the past hour I have been in the
path of a great temptation and that the thought of
an enforced honor code and not my own personal re
spect has been my sole salvation.

Now let's read the front of the vari-colored exam
ination booklets. Why not suggest sitting every 10
seats, five rows apart, and come equipped with blind
ers? It's just as silly. It is natural to spread out for
elbow room —but why spread it across the cover of
the blue book?
No aid given nor received on term papers. Why
not? You quote professors, you quote books, you quote
authorities. Why is it wrong to believe that fellow
students have opinions that may be worthwhile con
cerning world affairs.
At the present time some of the departments are not
returning themes. This eliminates the evil of copying
from year to year . . . but time marches on—the pro
fessors go on forever.
Why not change the subjects of those term papers
once in a while, oh most wise purveyors of high learn
ing? Sophomores have been writing on "Why I Came
to College" for generations. Give the poor kids a
break and you won't find yourselves so bored reading
the same stuff year in and year out.
