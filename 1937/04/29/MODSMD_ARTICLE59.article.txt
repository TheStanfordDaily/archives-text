I have no "unexpurgated violets" to sell. You can
not sign up for me for 50 cents in the Cellar. I am
just a voice out of the wilderness, coming to you as a
female substitute for Our Hasher, who is said to have
collapsed in his cups yesterday when he heard that a
mere woman was to play his part. "Women!" he was
heard muttering into his beer(d). "Women! There
should be less and less of them and instead there is
Mora's." And he walked down the highway into the
sunset.
It takes a brain
To write on rain
But I'm unabashed
By Qgden Nash
Or even by
Our Illustrious Hash
Come out of Wong's Kitch.
Pomes on rain
Give me a pain
So don't you think this has gone far enough?
(Anyway, who said I had a brain.)
