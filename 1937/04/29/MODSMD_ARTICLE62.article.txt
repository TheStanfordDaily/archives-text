"THE SOLDIER AND THE
LADY," Hollywood's version of
Jules Verne's story, "Michael Stro
goff," is largely pure melodrama,
but pretty good melodrama. Anton
Walbrook, who plays the part of
Strogoff, is a new foreign import,
and his acting is not the modern
American brand, but it is convinc
ing.
Elisabeth Aljan as the peasant girl
is true to type, and gets in some
sensitive acting. Handicapped by
poor lines and situations, Eric Blore,
as an English war correspondent, is
below his usual standard.
The battle scenes, of which there
arc many, are pretty tremendous,
and if you like your entertainment
dished out noisily and gorily, you'll
like this.
"HER IIUSBANI) LIES" is a
slightly better than average second
featui'e, largely on acount of the
novel ending. Ricardo Cortez is his
usual suave self, as a big-time gam
bler, and Gail Patrick is his inde
pendent wife, who, incidentally,
should not try to sing. Her voice,
definitely not the singing type, de
tracts from her appeal many de
grees.
