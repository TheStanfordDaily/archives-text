Connie full well knows that it's a
terrible blow to find your last
year's swimming maillot looks like
a moth-eaten, battered scare
crow. But cheer up! Here's •

where you'd just as soon it
changed to red end white, up
lifted exactly right. Slinky over
the torso and hips . . . hip, hip,
hurray! 5.95, that's all.

Connie full well knows that it's a
terrible blow to find your last
year's swimming maillot looks like
a moth-eaten, battered scare
crow. But cheer up! Here's •
new B.V.D. that turns summer,
saults around past suits, you'll
see. Navy blue up to the b'loom
where you'd just as soon it
changed to red end white, up
lifted exactly right. Slinky over
the torso and hips . . . hip, hip,
hurray! 5.95, that's all.

COLUMNS
SOME PEOPLE will week
end, meyhap, cooped up in
a four-room flat. But not
Connie. She plans to "make
hay while the sun shines" and
hit for the great outdoors . .
get a fine coat of tan, some
place on the sand . . . and
forget all household chores.
Playful toggeries here are
Connie's week-end pet gear.
Slick Slacks
Maybe you never owned a pair
of SLACKS . . . and didn't car®
to. Maybe you think they're not
ladylike ... as some do. But like
it or not, SLACKS are in the sun
spct. Personally, Connie felt hap
pier the minute shs spied these,
by B.V.D. A white shirt (l.OO),
tucks-in to navy trousers (1.95),
managing to look neat . . . even
in the "seat." Also in solid navy
or white. Bandana head tie, 20
/\! 7^T~

Sun Shorts
From Connie, take a cue, and
don't whatever you do, be caught
short on "shorts" wee!:-ending.
Smartest color you could possibly
choose are these gabardines in
navy blue. Practical, washable,
and mighty good-looking too . . .
even from the rear view. 2.50
Also in white, brown or maiie.
Tomboy shirt of broadcloth an
swers a fervent prayer tor a shirt
with long enough toils to tuck-in
. . . and stay there. 1.50 in
navy, white, light blue, maize.
