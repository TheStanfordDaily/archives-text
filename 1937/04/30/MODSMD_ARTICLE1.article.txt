# Lakin Leads As Chinese Play Opens
## First Amateur Showing Of 'Precious Stream' Tonight, Assembly Hall 
### SUZANNE HAMMOND 
With a crash of Chinese cymbals,
Ihe opening curtain of Dramatic
Council's production of "Larly Prec
ious Stream" will rise at 8:30 o'clock
tonight, and tomorrow in the As
sembly Hall.
The play is a romantic success
story of a young Chinese noble
woman, played by Phyllis Lakin,
who falls in love with her father's
gardener, Jim Corner. Her father,
Prime Minister Wang, played by
Brobury Ellis, has succeeded in mar
rying off his other obedient daugh
ters, Cherie Meherin and Geraldine
Schreiber, to the generals Su and
Wei, Ken Peters and Jack Gillis.
Lady Disowned
Lady Precious Stream, however,
decides to take matters into her own
hands, quite contrary to Oriental
custom, and marries' her gardener,
much against her family's will. In
the resulting furore, she and her
humble husband are disowned by
the rich and regal relatives, and go
to live in a cave.
Shortly after this, Hsieh, the hus
band is sent on a military campaign
into the Weslern Regions, where he
becomes enamored of the reigning
princess, played by Frances Farmer,
although the treacherous General
Wei has reported his death to the
waiting Lady Precious Stream.
Lines Are Informed
In regard to the manner in which
the play is written, the lines have
about the same air of informality
which characterizes the Jack Benny
program. None of the characters
hesitates in turning his back on the
action of the play to confide some
entirely irrelevant l'act to the au
dience.
Much of the humor lie* in the
strangeness of the stage routine, in
which stage hands slip pillows un
der fainting actors, and the hero
dashes around the stage on horse
backâ€”mounted on a large stick,
whipping frantically at thin air.
