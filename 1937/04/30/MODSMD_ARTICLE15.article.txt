## 
### 
First student good will delegation
to Mexico and Central America
from an American University, Stan
ford's good will ambassadors, Jim
Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president, and
Jim Hill, ex-debate manager, have
just completed a series of round
table discussions and interviews in a
7000-mile tour of Mexico, Guate
mala, and El Salvador.
Called "good neighbor" student
ambassadors by Latin American
leaders, Jim Hill stated that they
construed "our visits as another way
in which the United States and
Stanford has been promoting better
feeling."
"Animosity has existed a long
time against the United States be
cause of our economic and imperial
istic policies," Jim said, "but this is
rapidly being overcome."
Leaders were deeply impressed
;.nd extremely gratified that Stan
ford students were interested enough
to send representatives to learn
something about their countries and
to promote better feeling, Hill re
ports. "We found them surprisingly
well informed of the United States
and very surprised that we would
send n team there for these pur
poses."
In the round-table discussions and
interviews with student leaders, fac
ulty representatives, and govern

mental officials, our men discussed
the possibility of exchange of stu
dents. Pan-American student con
grosses, and reciprocal athletic rela
tions.
The "Honor Code" is not only a
Stanford tradition, it is incorporated
in the National Autonomous Univer
sity of Mexico. However, their code
does not apply to the taking of ex
ams or preparation of school work.
Instead of entering social science
fields as here, the majority of stu

'dents enter medical and law schools.
Instead of going into campus activi
ties and athletics as in the Urjited
States, students in all countries vis
ited enter into real politics.
While at Guadalajara, the good
will representatives had "a wonder
ful interview* with Consul Wells.'
Hill said. "We found him, as well as
other career diplomats, courteous
and brilliant. At Mexico City they
were guests three times of the lega
tion and American Ambassador Jo
sephus Daniels, who was helpful in
arranging interviews with other
governmental leaders.
One interview in particular im
pressed Jim, that with Senor Licen
ciado Bateta, "young braintruster"
and secretary of state. Although the
waiting room was packed with
people, they became so absorbed that
when they looked at their watches
two hours had elapsed.
Senor Bateta outlined the prob
lems confronting Cardena's regime
when it came into office, and what
it is attempting to do in its under
lying philosophy. At the end ot the
interview lie called his secretary
and told him to bring in two sets of
books he had written, dealing with
present conditions in Mexico.
Jim stated that Senor Bateta had
autographed and given the sets to
them. They plan to present them to
the library.

First student good will delegation
to Mexico and Central America
from an American University, Stan
ford's good will ambassadors, Jim
Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president, and
Jim Hill, ex-debate manager, have
just completed a series of round
table discussions and interviews in a
7000-mile tour of Mexico, Guate
mala, and El Salvador.
Called "good neighbor" student
ambassadors by Latin American
leaders, Jim Hill stated that they
construed "our visits as another way
in which the United States and
Stanford has been promoting better
feeling."
"Animosity has existed a long
time against the United States be
cause of our economic and imperial
istic policies," Jim said, "but this is
rapidly being overcome."
Leaders were deeply impressed
;.nd extremely gratified that Stan
ford students were interested enough
to send representatives to learn
something about their countries and
to promote better feeling, Hill re
ports. "We found them surprisingly
well informed of the United States
and very surprised that we would
send n team there for these pur
poses."
In the round-table discussions and
interviews with student leaders, fac
ulty representatives, and govern

mental officials, our men discussed
the possibility of exchange of stu
dents. Pan-American student con
grosses, and reciprocal athletic rela
tions.
The "Honor Code" is not only a
Stanford tradition, it is incorporated
in the National Autonomous Univer
sity of Mexico. However, their code
does not apply to the taking of ex
ams or preparation of school work.
Instead of entering social science
fields as here, the majority of stu

'dents enter medical and law schools.
Instead of going into campus activi
ties and athletics as in the Urjited
States, students in all countries vis
ited enter into real politics.
While at Guadalajara, the good
will representatives had "a wonder
ful interview* with Consul Wells.'
Hill said. "We found him, as well as
other career diplomats, courteous
and brilliant. At Mexico City they
were guests three times of the lega
tion and American Ambassador Jo
sephus Daniels, who was helpful in
arranging interviews with other
governmental leaders.
One interview in particular im
pressed Jim, that with Senor Licen
ciado Bateta, "young braintruster"
and secretary of state. Although the
waiting room was packed with
people, they became so absorbed that
when they looked at their watches
two hours had elapsed.
Senor Bateta outlined the prob
lems confronting Cardena's regime
when it came into office, and what
it is attempting to do in its under
lying philosophy. At the end ot the
interview lie called his secretary
and told him to bring in two sets of
books he had written, dealing with
present conditions in Mexico.
Jim stated that Senor Bateta had
autographed and given the sets to
them. They plan to present them to
the library.
