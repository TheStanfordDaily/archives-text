# Hasher Tax Fight Halted Temporarily
## Sutton Will Confer With Commission Regarding House Officers Clause 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Stanford living groups' fight to
escape the state unemployment tax
was temporarily halted yesterday
when John L. Sutton, deputy regis
trar of the California reserves com
mission, announced he would con
fer with the commission before in
cluding honorary officers as "em
ployees."
Interfraternity Board had ob
jected to including house and club
officers because in every case they
brought the total employees up to
eight or more. Eight or more em
ployees make an organization sub
ject to the tax, about $50 in mo.it
cases.

Of 32 organizations which regis
tered with Mr. Sutton yesterday and
Wednesday, 12 houses and two eat
ing clubs were subject to the tax
even though honorary officers were
not included.
The Board will petition the com
mission, unless Mr. Sutton gets a
new ruling dropping honorary offi
cers from the "employee" classifica
tion. He will report back to the
Board next week.

Nine organizations still unregis
tered must get blanks immediately
from Warren Turner, fraternity au
ditor. The 1936 tax, amounting to
1.35 per cent of the total payroll, is
due immediately after Mr. Sutton
notifies the campus of the commis
sion's ruling.
A student committee, headed by
Don Moulton, new Board president,
will meet this noon at the Phi Delt
house to draw up plans for a brief
against paying a tax at all.
Committee Members
Bob Hoover, Phi Delt; Wayne
Richardson, Delta Chi; Phil Klau
ber. Breakers; Harry Cragin, El
Campo; Mi-. Turner, and Jud Crary,
Palo Alto bank president and frater
nity financial adviser, will discuss
avoiding the tax through classing
living groups as "educational insti
tutions," already exempt.
According to Moulton, escape from
paying any tax depends upon Fed
eral court action. The California act
takes its provisions from the Na
tional Social Security Act which puts
fraternities on the paying list. The
National Interfraternity Council is
presenting a brief to the Social Se
curity Board claiming fraternities
and sororities are educational.

Committee Members
Bob Hoover, Phi Delt; Wayne
Richardson, Delta Chi; Phil Klau
ber. Breakers; Harry Cragin, El
Campo; Mi-. Turner, and Jud Crary,
Palo Alto bank president and frater
nity financial adviser, will discuss
avoiding the tax through classing
living groups as "educational insti
tutions," already exempt.
According to Moulton, escape from
paying any tax depends upon Fed
eral court action. The California act
takes its provisions from the Na
tional Social Security Act which puts
fraternities on the paying list. The
National Interfraternity Council is
presenting a brief to the Social Se
curity Board claiming fraternities
and sororities are educational.
