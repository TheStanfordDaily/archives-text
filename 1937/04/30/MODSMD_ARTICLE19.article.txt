Stanford, in 1912, it has belonged to
Dr. Coover.
Born in Indiana
Dr. Coover was born in Reming
ton, Indiana, and did his first study- j
ing in Pennsylvania and Kansas as i
a farm boy. In 1892, after one term j
in McPherson College, he went to I
Colorado in search of a job as a tele- i
graph operator.
YVhile in Colorado, he worked for
a while on a newspaper which went j
bankrupt after a short period. For
three years thereafter, he published .
and edited the "Longmont Prog- |
res s."

After this interlude, he entered
the state normal school at Greeley, !
Colorado, and graduated with the j
degree of bachelor of pedagogy.
I 1 hen, before he entered Stanford in
1899, he was principal of schools in
Como, Colorado.
While here, he worked as a printer j
and pressman in Paly and for the i
Daily Palo Alto, now Stanford Daily.
Later he became manager of the j
tc legraph and long-distance tele
