# Essay oil Apple Polishing Prof Gives 'Inside Dope'
## 
### DAVID HARRIS Associate Professor of History 
From at least two of the cultural
currents which make up our turbid'
stream of so-called Western Civili
zation it has come dov/n to us that
the Apple is a most regrettable fruit.
The Good Book of a certain non-
Aryan tribe gives us an attractive
picture of the original Apple: "a de
light to the eyes" and a commodity
"to b« desired to make one |have
the appearance of being) wise."
Yet the ancient scroll does not stop
with describing the glossy surface
that scintillated in the sunlight as
Mother Eve gently stroked it; the
scroll goes on to recount the woes
dealt out to the first Native Son and
Native Daughter and their progeny
for all times to come as punishment
for having succumbed to the lure of

the Apple.
Atalanta's Apple
Likewise the lore of the Greeks—
also non-Aryan but energized, I am
told, by blood of the self-chosen
Race—has its warnings for us; the
fair huntress Atalanta lured to her
first false step on the race course by
a glistening Apple; Paris, by acting
only once as middleman in the Apple
business, letting loose that long
chain of events which led to the fall
of Troy.
These warnings should have suf
ficed but, alas, we learn from his
tory, some Jeremiah has said, that
we learn nothing from history, and
the pomologist we have with us al
ways.
Artful or naive he lurks at the
professorial door to offer his polished
permain or pippin in exchange for
the grade desired for his individual
purpose. He seldom deceives any
one but himself, but he is at times
wearisome and discouraging to the
object of his attentions.
Away with the fear. Most profes
sors are human beings; perhaps all
of them are —at least some of the
time. By and large they are worth
knowing. But in the interest of the
best camaraderie let me interpolate
a word of warning.
Don't make your social calls in
their offices too long. They seem to
have nothing to do but mumble
through old lecture notes, but for
most of them that is only the ap
pearance. The}' have to do a hun
dred things you don't ordinarily
know about.
Busy Writing Books
Moreover, if they are ever to be
clected president of their national
society or garner in such trivial

things as advance in pay and rank
they must write soporific books
about Bulgarian atrocities or the
unicorn in Babylonian literature and
they ought to be up and at it —al-
though they probably aren't.
So, to come back to my point,
"Prosit" to the students who ale not
intimidated by the hue and cry of
apple polishing. Let the smack of
good fellowship grow to banquet
proportions!
li.e marvel is that we are friends
at all, given the practices under
which we all suffer.
College Non-Conducive
There is tittle in college life con
ducive to our common solidarity.
You are supposed to gain Facility
in Making Contacts (as I have some
times heard it described), to perfect
your Vicarious Enjoyment of Sport
through co-ordinated hysteria in the
bleachers, and, finally, you are re
quired to amass 180 Units and a
suitable balance of Grade Points —
and we with our fortnightly exami
nations and blue pencils stand bc

tween you and that consummation
devoutly to be wished, or deplored
as the ease might be.
The student, conditioned from the
day of his arrival to think in terms
of grades, is forced into the second
greatest collegiate game—outwitting
the examination corrector.
Thtre can hardly be a genuine
friendship between undergraduate
and teacher until the tyranny of
units and grade points and their false
standards are overthrown and un
dergraduate and teacher set out
together in search of a liberal educa
tion. A.s the first remedial measure
I endorse the proposal that every
little boy and every little girl that's
born alive be given the A.B. degree
on the day of their birth.

From at least two of the cultural

The Good Book of a certain non-

the Apple.
Atalanta's Apple
Likewise the lore of the Greeks—
also non-Aryan but energized, I am
told, by blood of the self-chosen
Race—has its warnings for us; the
fair huntress Atalanta lured to her
first false step on the race course by
a glistening Apple; Paris, by acting
only once as middleman in the Apple
business, letting loose that long
chain of events which led to the fall
of Troy.
These warnings should have suf

tory, some Jeremiah has said, that
we learn nothing from history, and
the pomologist we have with us al
ways.
Artful or naive he lurks at the

Away with the fear. Most profes

Don't make your social calls in

Moreover, if they are ever to be

they must write soporific books

though they probably aren't.
So, to come back to my point,
"Prosit" to the students who ale not

apple polishing. Let the smack of
good fellowship grow to banquet
