From at least two of the cultural
currents which make up our turbid'
stream of so-called Western Civili
zation it has come dov/n to us that
the Apple is a most regrettable fruit.
The Good Book of a certain non-
Aryan tribe gives us an attractive
picture of the original Apple: "a de
light to the eyes" and a commodity
"to b« desired to make one |have
the appearance of being) wise."
Yet the ancient scroll does not stop
with describing the glossy surface
that scintillated in the sunlight as
Mother Eve gently stroked it; the
scroll goes on to recount the woes
dealt out to the first Native Son and
Native Daughter and their progeny
for all times to come as punishment
for having succumbed to the lure of

the Apple.
Atalanta's Apple
Likewise the lore of the Greeks—
also non-Aryan but energized, I am
told, by blood of the self-chosen
Race—has its warnings for us; the
fair huntress Atalanta lured to her
first false step on the race course by
a glistening Apple; Paris, by acting
only once as middleman in the Apple
business, letting loose that long
chain of events which led to the fall
of Troy.
These warnings should have suf
ficed but, alas, we learn from his
tory, some Jeremiah has said, that
we learn nothing from history, and
the pomologist we have with us al
ways.
