# W. W. Behlow Dies in Palo Alto Hospital
## Passing of Former Navy: Surgeon Ends Service To Local Fraternities 
### 
A familiar sideline figure at local I
athletic events and one of those un- j
glorified alumni who stand in the
background and give freely of their
services and possessions to oil the l
machinery of the University was
Dr. William Wallace Behlow, '07,
who died yesterday in the Palo Alto
Hospital after a long illne.ss and
four months' confinement.
As a member of the Interfraternity
Board in 1934, 1935, and 1937 until
his illness, Dr. Behlow was a lead- i
ing figure in the recent abolition of
Hell Week at Stanford, and was re
sponsible for numerous moves to
ward the betterment of fraternity
life.
Dr. Behlow was born in San Fran
cisco April 8, 1886, graduated from
Stanford in 1907, secured the de
gree of Doctor of Medicine cum
laude at Harvard in 1912, and in
1914 opened offices in San Francisco.
He became connected with the
United States Navy in 1917 as As
sistant Surgeon in the Mcdical
Corps. He was commissioned in 1919
as Lieutenant and in 1925 was pro- j
moted to Lieutenant Commander.
An alumnus of the Stanford chap
ter, Dr. Behlow became president of
the local province of Phi Delta Theta
in 1932. He kept in active contact i
with Stanford, always ready to do his j
share.
