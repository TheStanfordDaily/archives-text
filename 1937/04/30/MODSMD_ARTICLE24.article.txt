# Torrance Fails In Fistic Debut
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 20 (U.R).â€”Jack
Torrance, former world champion
i .shot-putter, made a dismal debut
in big time pugilism by suffering a
technical knockout in the second
round of his scheduled six-round
bout with Abe Simon of Brooklyn
; at the Hippodrome.
I Simon, a former scholastic cham
! pion shot-putter, was slower than
his opponent, but because of more
| experience in 16 previous bouts, he
I did the most damage. It was. a good
| first round and the 4000 fans gave
i the boys quite an ovation. They
| had come to see these two titans in
| action, and they got plenty of action.
In the second round, 254-pound
Abe went to work on Jack who
! weighed 253. A left hook knocked
j the mouthpiece from Torrance's lips,
i Then another left crashed into Jack's
temple. It was a sort of pushing blow,
i but it sent Jack to the canvas. He
{ took the count of nine. The next
left landed on Jack's chin and spilled
him backwards. He took the count
of eight. Again he went down and
this time he stayed there.
