# Greta Garbo Past Outlined in Suit
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, April 29 (UP). â€”
Greta Garbo's pre-Hollywood days,
when the glamorous star was just a
lanky, big footed Swedish girl try
ing to break into the movies, were
outlined today in a deposition Miss
Garbo gave for a $10,500 damage suit
she will face in court Monday.
The deposition, obtained after law
yers hounded the studio so persist
ently that Miss Garbo lost her cam
era poise, was revealed by Attorney
James J. McCarthy. It will be intro
duced at the trial of the suit, brought
by a European film man who claims
he loaned La Garbo the money to
"grub-stake" her movie career.
Miss Garbo's purported European
backer is David Shratter, who claims
he once turned down a fat film job
until the Swedish girl was taken
on the payroll, too. Shratter charges
that after coming to America on his
money and becoming a high salaried
star, Miss Garbo refused to repay
him.
