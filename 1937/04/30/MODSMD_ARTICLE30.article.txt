Pre-fabricated walls arc the main
feature of the "Unibilt Construction"
which is being used on the new wing
of Lagunita, upperclass women's
dormitory. The walls, shipped in
tact from San Francisco, are put
together on the construction grounds.
Throughout all the work of ihc
last two weeks when the ochre, steel
frame, braced by diagonal, round
rods, has been going up on the east
wing, there have never been more
than seven men employed at one
time. During the time when the
frames were erected, before they
were welded, there were only four
men in the gang.
Walls Erected
On the west side of Lagunita, the
concrete bases have been poured
for (hat wing. According to the
foremen of the two construction
gangs, the only supports the steel
framework needs are a few bolts
placed in the concrete.
After the walls had been lifted,
moved into place, and bolted, a
crew of welders came and fixed the
whole structure together. By this
method, the structure has been made
stronger as well as simpler.
Concrete Poured
All the concrete that is used in
both wings was poured in about four
days, and took about three days to
dry. It was mixed on the site of the
Cuhberley Building excavation and
trucked over to Lagunita.
The soil that was taken from the
excavations has all been used in the
new Laurence Frost Amphitheater,
where it i.s used to build up the
edges.
Now that the main framework for
the east wing has been erected,
workmen will soon start laying the
floors. The walls are to be made of
stucco, the same material as the
rest of the dormitory.

Pre-fabricated walls arc the main
feature of the "Unibilt Construction"
which is being used on the new wing
of Lagunita, upperclass women's
dormitory. The walls, shipped in
tact from San Francisco, are put
together on the construction grounds.
Throughout all the work of ihc
last two weeks when the ochre, steel
frame, braced by diagonal, round
rods, has been going up on the east
wing, there have never been more
than seven men employed at one
time. During the time when the
frames were erected, before they
were welded, there were only four
men in the gang.
Walls Erected
On the west side of Lagunita, the
concrete bases have been poured
for (hat wing. According to the
foremen of the two construction
gangs, the only supports the steel
framework needs are a few bolts
placed in the concrete.
After the walls had been lifted,
moved into place, and bolted, a
crew of welders came and fixed the
whole structure together. By this
method, the structure has been made
stronger as well as simpler.
Concrete Poured
All the concrete that is used in
both wings was poured in about four
days, and took about three days to
dry. It was mixed on the site of the
Cuhberley Building excavation and
trucked over to Lagunita.
The soil that was taken from the
excavations has all been used in the
new Laurence Frost Amphitheater,
where it i.s used to build up the
edges.
Now that the main framework for
the east wing has been erected,
workmen will soon start laying the
floors. The walls are to be made of
stucco, the same material as the
rest of the dormitory.
