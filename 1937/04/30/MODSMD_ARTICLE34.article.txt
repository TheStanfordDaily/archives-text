### 
KETCHIKAN. Alaska, April 29
(UP). — In a howling gale, three
ships sped today to the aid of the
S. S. Cordova, afire and disabled
in Hecate Strait en route to Craig,
Alaska.
The Cordova, Alaska Steamship
Co. freighter, which sailed Monday
from Seattle with 104 cannery
workmen and a crew of about 40,
was believed drifting in a south
west gale 50 miles south of t)undus
Island.
The Coast Guard cutter Alert, the
S. S. Northwestern of the Alaska
line, and the U. S. S. Swallow, Navy
miqe sweeper from Bremerton,
Wash., fought their way through
rough seas to reach the Cordova.
Radio communication between
Alaska and the States, however, has
been virtually impossible for the
past 24 hours, due to atmospheric
conditions. Only a terse flash came
from the ship to the Merchants' Ex
change here. "Fire in No. 2 hold.
Rudder disabled. At mercy of south
east gale," the radio crackled.
