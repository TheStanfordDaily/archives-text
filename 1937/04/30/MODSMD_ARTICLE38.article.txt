# Card Trackmen Tackle San Mateo J.C. Squad
## 
### 
Come out this afternoon to Angt'll Field at 3:30 and see yourself a
classic track meet. No, not U.S.C., or California, or a pay-as-you-enter
affair, but simply Tex Byrd and his San Mateo J.C. boys meeting Dink
Templeton's varsity in an informal practice preliminary to tomorrow's
open date.
A classic it's described because of the exceptional talent Byrd is con
stantly turning out. This year, in addition to Cecil Cole, prominent dis-

tance man from last year who is stilH
there and as good as ever, Byrd I
brings Bill Wohle, National J.C.
shot-put champion, Ted Ellison (who
may or may not run), the finest
sprinter within a hundred miles of
here, and others.
Injuries Strike
Injuries, long overdue, struck the
Stanford team yesterday in the form j
of a pulled muscle suffered by !
broad-jumper Leo Madlem in a
sprint warm-up. Madlem, a thick
legged boy, is often dogged by
cramps and things, suffered one in
his freshman year here. Fritz Roth,
team physician, will decide today
how serious this present injury will
be.
Because of the high efficiency of
the "1100" and women's edition,
the Stanford Daily today will tell
the story of Bob "Tiger" Alexander's
4:15 mile run yesterday in a prac
tice behind Norm Bright, the Sunny
vale school teacher distance runner,
who finished in 4:17.6. Skin Wilson's !
Stanford mile record is 4:19. G, set in
1916, so you see (Nimmo and Dixon j
last year, yes) Alexander has built j
himself into a niche with the all- i
time Stanford distance - running!
greats. The 4:18.4 is by far the best
collegiate effort on the Coast this;
year.
