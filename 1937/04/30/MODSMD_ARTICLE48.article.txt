THE UPRISING has been quelled
and the field is again ours.
EVERYBODY who has seen Ram
my Rasmussen play polo is well
aware of the fact that he plays very
earnestly and that his complexion,
like all good Scandinavians, gets
very flushed and apoplectic-looking.
Now, Betty Kline, who covered polo
for the women's edition yesterday,
noticed the color analogy betwixt
Rammy's face and his shirt during
the game with the San Mateo Polo
Club, and mentioned it in her yarn,
along with the revelation that Ram
my's shirt was in sore need of a bit
of mending.
If Itammy has any of the finer
sensibilities peculiar to the
aforementioned Scandinavians —
the finest race on earth, by the
way—his face is once more apo
pleptic-looking because of that
ph rase, "looked too divine in a
trick little riding outfit with knee
pads."
Persons like Betty Kline can get
away with that sort of thing, and
everybody gets a laugh out of it, but
let the male reporter try something
like that and Mr. Rasmussen would
be around directly to see about
knocking down a pair of ears. You
could hardly blame him, of course,
but that just shows to go ya—these
women have all the advantages.
AND LISTEN, my dear Miss Tof
fee, what's the idea of springing that
gag about the pale blue shirt and the
white collar? That sort of puts me
in the same class with Rasmussen —
which isn't so bad considering we're
both good Norsemen, but which
isn't very good either, considering
he's a Dane and I'm a Swede.
STANFORD'S FOOTBALL team
will be an unknown quantity again
next fall, for it will still be building
for the time when it will again be
as good as the Grayson-Hamilton-
Alustiza-Reynolds crew was. That
was a mighty team, when you look
back upon it, a team that posted a
remarkable record for three years
on end. Thornhill's outfit for this
fall looms as an improved team over
a latently strong squad of 1936, but
it doesn't figure to approach that
Vowing Soph outfit.
While the Cards can look for
ward to the coming season only
with speculation, however, Coach
Stub Allison across the bay is go
ing into his season with one of the
finest squads, potentially, he could
wish for. From the team that
walloped an inexperienced Stan
ford team 20-0, Allison will lose
only one regular, Ray Nordstrom,
right tackle.
Along with Nordstrom will go
another right tackle, a letterman but
not a first-string player, Gene Mc-
Ateer, to provide the only possible
spot for worry for Allison. There
will be two lettermen back to try for
that spot, though, Milt Pollack and
Bill Stoll. Left tackle will be
handled by Dave DeVarona, with a
couple of frosh to back him up.
If tackles are the weakest point
on the Bear team, they will be
the strongest spot on the Stanford
team. /agar, a potential AII
- if there ever was one.
and Stan Andersen, up from the
frosh with just as many or more
prospects than Zagar had as a
soph, will be the best pair of
tackles on the Coast. And that in
cludes any school, Washington to
U.S.C.
Zagar and Clark at left tackle and
end again should make that the driv
ing side of the Indian offense this
fall, but perhaps that combination ol
Andersen and Stone on the other
side will develop to the point where
a fine balance will be achieved
When you figure that Matthews anc
Ferko will be back at the guard
spots once more, you can see thai
Thornhill will at least have a fine
defensive wall in front of an as yel
unknown backfield.
Outside of his tackles, Allison
has nothing but the goods. Sparks
and Schwartz return as regulars at
ends, with Dolman, Johnston, and
Callaghan back from the varsity
of last year. Besides that, there
are a few frosh coming up.
Six lettermen at guard, Stockton
"vans, Reginato, Ray, Hanford, anc
Gilbert should handle that situatior
in great style. At center Bob Her
\ i;j returns, and whether or not he
(.in play basketball you have to ad

I til field. At that, if Lou Tsoutsou
\ c> had Herwig's speed he'd makt
belter center—he wasn't in tht
wrong spot very often last year or
defense, but he just couldn't run fas!
eno igh.
hut that backfield—wow! Meek
at quarter, Chapman at right half.
B (tari at left half, and Cotton at

full will probably be the strongest
tingle unit Allison will have, but
the second outfit of Winter bottom,
Thomas, Cornell or Pollock, and
Anderson for the same position is
nothing to he laughed at. Bottari
and Meek can play 011 my team
anytime, particularly Bottari.
What a coach couldn't do with
Bottari of Cal, Schindler of U.S.C.,
Paulman of Stanford, and maybe
Collis of Stanford or Wascowitz of
Washington, on oiTense.
Of course, that California back
field can almost be matched, on
paper, by what Thornhill has. Paul
man at quarter is every bit as good
as Meek on general play, and he can
kick and pass twice as well. The
halfbacks will again be the pony
size, with Coffis, Vigna, and Luckett
as the best-looking so far. It would
n't be so bad to see Tony Calvelli at
a half, either. None so far figures as
strong as either Chapman or Bottari,
but on the Warner system teams the
quarter and the fullback are the
main offense threats, with the halves
supplementary.
Jake Brigham and Jim Groves
at fullback should both be pretty
good when fall rolls around.
Groves is a newcomer, but brings
a good reputation and so far looks
pretty good in spring practice,
while Brigham played lots of ball
last season.

be around directly to see about
knocking down a pair of ears. You
could hardly blame him, of course,
but that just shows to go ya—these
women have all the advantages.
AND LISTEN, my dear Miss Tof
fee, what's the idea of springing that
gag about the pale blue shirt and the
white collar? That sort of puts me
in the same class with Rasmussen —
which isn't so bad considering we're
both good Norsemen, but which
isn't very good either, considering
he's a Dane and I'm a Swede.
STANFORD'S FOOTBALL team
will be an unknown quantity again
next fall, for it will still be building
for the time when it will again be
as good as the Grayson-Hamilton-
Alustiza-Reynolds crew was. That
was a mighty team, when you look
back upon it, a team that posted a
remarkable record for three years
on end. Thornhill's outfit for this
fall looms as an improved team over
a latently strong squad of 1936, but
it doesn't figure to approach that
Vowing Soph outfit.
While the Cards can look for
ward to the coming season only
with speculation, however, Coach
Stub Allison across the bay is go
ing into his season with one of the
finest squads, potentially, he could
wish for. From the team that
walloped an inexperienced Stan
ford team 20-0, Allison will lose
only one regular, Ray Nordstrom,
right tackle.
Along with Nordstrom will go
another right tackle, a letterman but
not a first-string player, Gene Mc-
Ateer, to provide the only possible
spot for worry for Allison. There
will be two lettermen back to try for
that spot, though, Milt Pollack and
Bill Stoll. Left tackle will be
handled by Dave DeVarona, with a
couple of frosh to back him up.
If tackles are the weakest point
on the Bear team, they will be
the strongest spot on the Stanford
team. /agar, a potential AII

frosh with just as many or more

Zagar and Clark at left tackle and
end again should make that the driv
ing side of the Indian offense this
fall, but perhaps that combination ol
Andersen and Stone on the other
side will develop to the point where
a fine balance will be achieved
When you figure that Matthews anc
Ferko will be back at the guard
spots once more, you can see thai
Thornhill will at least have a fine
defensive wall in front of an as yel
unknown backfield.
Outside of his tackles, Allison
has nothing but the goods. Sparks
and Schwartz return as regulars at
ends, with Dolman, Johnston, and
Callaghan back from the varsity
of last year. Besides that, there
are a few frosh coming up.
Six lettermen at guard, Stockton

Gilbert should handle that situatior

at quarter, Chapman at right half.
B (tari at left half, and Cotton at

tingle unit Allison will have, but
the second outfit of Winter bottom,
Thomas, Cornell or Pollock, and
Anderson for the same position is
nothing to he laughed at. Bottari
and Meek can play 011 my team
anytime, particularly Bottari.
What a coach couldn't do with
Bottari of Cal, Schindler of U.S.C.,
Paulman of Stanford, and maybe
Collis of Stanford or Wascowitz of
Washington, on oiTense.
Of course, that California back
field can almost be matched, on
paper, by what Thornhill has. Paul
man at quarter is every bit as good
as Meek on general play, and he can
kick and pass twice as well. The
halfbacks will again be the pony
size, with Coffis, Vigna, and Luckett
as the best-looking so far. It would
n't be so bad to see Tony Calvelli at
a half, either. None so far figures as
strong as either Chapman or Bottari,
but on the Warner system teams the
quarter and the fullback are the
main offense threats, with the halves
supplementary.
Jake Brigham and Jim Groves
at fullback should both be pretty
good when fall rolls around.
Groves is a newcomer, but brings
a good reputation and so far looks
pretty good in spring practice,
while Brigham played lots of ball
last season.

for the women's edition yesterday,
noticed the color analogy betwixt
Rammy's face and his shirt during
the game with the San Mateo Polo

remarkable record for three years
on end. Thornhill's outfit for this
fall looms as an improved team over
a latently strong squad of 1936, but
it doesn't figure to approach that
Vowing Soph outfit.
While the Cards can look for
ward to the coming season only
with speculation, however, Coach
Stub Allison across the bay is go
ing into his season with one of the
finest squads, potentially, he could
wish for. From the team that
walloped an inexperienced Stan
ford team 20-0, Allison will lose
only one regular, Ray Nordstrom,
right tackle.
Along with Nordstrom will go
another right tackle, a letterman but
not a first-string player, Gene Mc-
Ateer, to provide the only possible
spot for worry for Allison. There
will be two lettermen back to try for
that spot, though, Milt Pollack and
Bill Stoll. Left tackle will be
handled by Dave DeVarona, with a
couple of frosh to back him up.

on the Bear team, they will be
the strongest spot on the Stanford
team. /agar, a potential AII

frosh with just as many or more
prospects than Zagar had as a

Zagar and Clark at left tackle and
end again should make that the driv
ing side of the Indian offense this
fall, but perhaps that combination ol
Andersen and Stone on the other
side will develop to the point where
a fine balance will be achieved
When you figure that Matthews anc
Ferko will be back at the guard
spots once more, you can see thai
Thornhill will at least have a fine
defensive wall in front of an as yel
unknown backfield.
Outside of his tackles, Allison
has nothing but the goods. Sparks
and Schwartz return as regulars at
ends, with Dolman, Johnston, and
Callaghan back from the varsity
of last year. Besides that, there
are a few frosh coming up.
Six lettermen at guard, Stockton

at quarter, Chapman at right half.
B (tari at left half, and Cotton at

tingle unit Allison will have, but
the second outfit of Winter bottom,
Thomas, Cornell or Pollock, and
Anderson for the same position is
nothing to he laughed at. Bottari
and Meek can play 011 my team
anytime, particularly Bottari.
What a coach couldn't do with
Bottari of Cal, Schindler of U.S.C.,
Paulman of Stanford, and maybe
Collis of Stanford or Wascowitz of
Washington, on oiTense.
Of course, that California back
field can almost be matched, on
paper, by what Thornhill has. Paul
man at quarter is every bit as good
as Meek on general play, and he can
kick and pass twice as well. The
halfbacks will again be the pony
size, with Coffis, Vigna, and Luckett
as the best-looking so far. It would
n't be so bad to see Tony Calvelli at
a half, either. None so far figures as
strong as either Chapman or Bottari,
but on the Warner system teams the
quarter and the fullback are the
main offense threats, with the halves
supplementary.
Jake Brigham and Jim Groves
at fullback should both be pretty
good when fall rolls around.
Groves is a newcomer, but brings
a good reputation and so far looks
pretty good in spring practice,
while Brigham played lots of ball
last season.
THE UPRISING has been quelled
and the field is again ours.
EVERYBODY who has seen Ram
my Rasmussen play polo is well
aware of the fact that he plays very
earnestly and that his complexion,
like all good Scandinavians, gets
very flushed and apoplectic-looking.
Now, Betty Kline, who covered polo
for the women's edition yesterday,
noticed the color analogy betwixt
Rammy's face and his shirt during
the game with the San Mateo Polo
Club, and mentioned it in her yarn,
along with the revelation that Ram
my's shirt was in sore need of a bit
of mending.
If Itammy has any of the finer
sensibilities peculiar to the
aforementioned Scandinavians —
the finest race on earth, by the
way—his face is once more apo
pleptic-looking because of that
ph rase, "looked too divine in a
trick little riding outfit with knee
pads."
Persons like Betty Kline can get
away with that sort of thing, and
everybody gets a laugh out of it, but
let the male reporter try something
like that and Mr. Rasmussen would
be around directly to see about
knocking down a pair of ears. You
could hardly blame him, of course,
but that just shows to go ya—these
women have all the advantages.
AND LISTEN, my dear Miss Tof
fee, what's the idea of springing that
gag about the pale blue shirt and the
white collar? That sort of puts me
in the same class with Rasmussen —
which isn't so bad considering we're
both good Norsemen, but which
isn't very good either, considering
he's a Dane and I'm a Swede.
