CHICAGO, April 29 (UP).—Jim
my Braddock picked a three-mil
lion-dollar training camp today but
he didn't say for what fight.
Announcing the heavyweight
champion will train at Grand Beach.
; Mich., Manager Joe Gould skipped
: nimbly over the fact Jim is sched
uled to meet Bomber Joe Louis at
Comiskey Park next June 22.
"Jim positively will defend his
! title this summer," Gould said. "Re-
I gc.rdless of where he does it, he will
train for two months at Grand
Beach.
"He's got to settle down in some
permanent spot and start active
j training."
Gould, who has maintained in loud
| voice that Braddock will fight Louis
I rather than Max Schmeling, avoided
the subject and apparently was try
(ing not to anticipate a favorable
j verdict in the Newark, N.J.. Federal
Court case aimed by Madison Square
' Garden at the Chicago fight.

An Ohio high school student saw
1 three starlings perched on a limb,
I took careful aim, and brought them
j all down with a single shot.

The Card team is still a paper
! team, though, while the Bears have
J the same group that rose as one of
I the strongest on the Coast at about
mid-season 1936, an already-proven
gang. From here they look awfully,
awfully tough, even though fall is a
long way off.
