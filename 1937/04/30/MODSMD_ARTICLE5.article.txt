# Four Years on Farm Changes Seniors' Ideas
## 
### 
From serious-minded freshmen to frivolous seniors in four years is the
saga of a score of members of the class of '37, who three years ago last
October 5 confided to Daily reporters their reasons for matriculation at
Stanford. Reasons given today by the remaining IS of the 29 originally
questioned show a marked degree of variation.
Curtis Prendergast. who stomps around on the Chappie, said three
years ago. "I came to college because I wish to gain a cultural background."

* Today he admits the true reason is
j "Because my mother sent me here."
Dick Bullis, freshman soccer coach,
j stated his reasons for attending
! Stanford as a freshman, "I desire to
J make good friends and round out a
J general education." Now he, too,
j admits a less idealistic purpose. "At
: the prep school which I attended,"
! he explained, "everyone went to
Harvard. I wanted to be original, so
! I came to Stanford "
Good Name Important
Bullis' defiance of convention is
negated by Catherine Jennings,
, Gamma Phi. She says now that she
' attends Stanford because the Uni
, versity has a good name in the East,
| where she intends to complete her
education. Three years ago she was
| quoted as saying "I'm here for col
lege life and experience, to find out
what I want to do, and to get general
knowledge."'
i Betty Stearns, Concert Series man
i agcr, declared as a freshman, "I
| came to college for an education—
i seriously!" Strangely enough, she
| gives the same reason today. Bar
, bara Patton, Deegee, replied- as a
! freshman, "Well, I suppose there
were social reasons.''
Take General Course
Ed Lindblom, now debate man
ager, argued when a frosh, "I came
to college to get a general education;
the more a person knows, the more
I he's interested in. This goes to make
| a more interesting, useful life."
Upon entering college, Mary
Welsh, now an Alpha Phi, was
quoted as saying she wanted "an
intellectual and social background."
I As a blase senior, she expresses sim
ply a desire for "stimulus."
Interesting to note is the fact that
those freshmen who declared in
1933 such reasons for entering as "It
! seemed the thing to do," "ust because
I wanted to," or "I was brought up
with the idea," are no longer regis
tered at the University.

tered at the University.
From serious-minded freshmen to frivolous seniors in four years is the
saga of a score of members of the class of '37, who three years ago last
October 5 confided to Daily reporters their reasons for matriculation at
Stanford. Reasons given today by the remaining IS of the 29 originally
questioned show a marked degree of variation.
Curtis Prendergast. who stomps around on the Chappie, said three
years ago. "I came to college because I wish to gain a cultural background."

* Today he admits the true reason is
j "Because my mother sent me here."
Dick Bullis, freshman soccer coach,
j stated his reasons for attending
! Stanford as a freshman, "I desire to
J make good friends and round out a
J general education." Now he, too,
j admits a less idealistic purpose. "At
: the prep school which I attended,"
! he explained, "everyone went to
Harvard. I wanted to be original, so
! I came to Stanford "
Good Name Important
Bullis' defiance of convention is
negated by Catherine Jennings,
, Gamma Phi. She says now that she
' attends Stanford because the Uni
, versity has a good name in the East,
| where she intends to complete her
education. Three years ago she was
| quoted as saying "I'm here for col
lege life and experience, to find out
what I want to do, and to get general
knowledge."'
i Betty Stearns, Concert Series man
i agcr, declared as a freshman, "I
| came to college for an education—
i seriously!" Strangely enough, she
| gives the same reason today. Bar
, bara Patton, Deegee, replied- as a
! freshman, "Well, I suppose there
were social reasons.''
Take General Course
Ed Lindblom, now debate man
ager, argued when a frosh, "I came
to college to get a general education;
the more a person knows, the more
I he's interested in. This goes to make
| a more interesting, useful life."
Upon entering college, Mary
Welsh, now an Alpha Phi, was
quoted as saying she wanted "an
intellectual and social background."
I As a blase senior, she expresses sim
ply a desire for "stimulus."
Interesting to note is the fact that
those freshmen who declared in
1933 such reasons for entering as "It
! seemed the thing to do," "ust because
I wanted to," or "I was brought up
with the idea," are no longer regis
tered at the University.
