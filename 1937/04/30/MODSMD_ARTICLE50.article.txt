Two For the Show
I dropped in at Angell Field yesterday
to see what Dink Templeton had to say
about our editorial of Wednesday. It was
about bleachers for Angell Field. I thought
he'd like it. Dink wants bleachers, I'd been
told.
I found him up on the timing stand, bawl
ing a nasal "get goin" at someone. I asked
him what he thought and he told me.
IT was feeble, that's what I thought of your
editorial. It smelled. Hell, man, you've got to
put some teeth into the thing — some punch.
What would I write? I'd say plenty. We've
got the best track plant in the world, and no
place to sit down.
When they build a $5,000 basketball floor
they put seats around it, don't they?
When they build a stage, they put a $500,000
theater around it, don't they?
(Get goin, Ed.)
Sure, they haven't got the money! But they're
gonna fix the seats in the stadium and the tennis
courts.
Yea, these are maintenance projects. But the
B.A.C. has credit, doesn't it? Just about the best
there is. The University would be glad to have
interest from a loan to an outfit like the B.A.C.
(Get warmed up, Rusty.)
It's silly, this field going to waste 'cause
there aren't bleachers. The stadium track is
okay, but that wind—and no setup could com
pare with this one.
But you don't need any more arguments.
It's the best track in the world, but nowhere
to sit down.
So I went away to think about putting
some "teeth" into it.
G. F.
