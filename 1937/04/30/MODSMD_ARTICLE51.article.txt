# Courting Trouble
## 
### 
THE Supreme Court decided Monday lhat
Georgia could not imprison Angelo Hern
don, Communist organizer, for spreading propa
ganda among the state's negroes.
Tuesday morning the papers declared that
"Supreme Court Says It's No Crime to Be a
Communist."
By Wednesday, Communist organizations all
over the United States were accepting the
Court's order on Herndon as a coup d'etat.
In California they pressed their fight against
the Criminal Syndicalism Act.
Elsewhere, they met to rejoice, not in a
newly found freedom of political belief, but
in celebration of a victory.
Their jubilance is based entirely on infer
ence. Actually, the Court merely decided
that the Georgia anti-insurrection bill was in
violation of the Bill of Rights—in plain English,
that the law cannot prosecute for political
belief or for attempts to peacefully convert
others.
The decision is not a restatement of the Bill
of Rights. The Bill of Rights needs no restating.
Nor is it a needed assurance of political free
dom. That assurance is embodied in the foun
dation of the Constitution.
But inference may go far beyond the Court's
specific subject—belief in Communism. The
decision may be regarded as a guarantee of
complete freedom by the professional agitator
and the vicious malcontent.
He may construe the Court's decision into an
"out" for anything ho wants to do. Ho may

believe he can break the laws of state and na
tion under the cloak of free political preference,
and be shriven clean by the Court's decision.
He may declare that he can have a riot, because
the riot was connected with his belief in Com
munism, and the Court said that a belief in
Communism was not unlawful.
The result may be that every lower court
prosecuting a Communist will be advertised in
the radical press as one who places its preju
dice against Communism higher than the law
of the land. That by prosecuting a Communist,
it admits its conscious intent to "get" reds.
Whether the Nine Old Men know it or not,
they may have tipped over an apple cart. And
the apples may roll farther than they know.
