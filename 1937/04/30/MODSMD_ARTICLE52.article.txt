AIR CONDITIONING
an hour and a half each week, the varnish on
the empty seats in Stanford's Little Theater shriv
els under a blast of superheated air. titled with start
ling originality, the Tuesday Evening Lecture.
Exposed to this sirroco is a somnolent audience con
sisting of one Daily reporter, one representative of the
Public Exercises Committee (legal guardian of the
lecture), a handful of haggard facully members, and
an assorted group of Paly citizenry. With the excep
tion of the good burghers, all wear a look of intense,
suffering. Occasionally, a student wanders in by mis
take and dozes unhappily on the back row.
Ostensibly intended to put a polish on the Stanford
diamond-in-the-rough, the Tuesday Lecture is really
the University's gift to any of Palo Alto's latter-day
saints with a taste for self-mortification. But even as
a gift, it is not received with a chorus of cheers. If
a dozen souls should appear, the Committee would feel
that it had cause to pat itself on the back.
* * * *
ryHE administration moans plaintively that the stu
dents arc not interested, and that they won't stay
on the campus. In explanation, the Committee says that
the undergraduate is inhibited, conditioned, and just
plain screwy. Rather should these terms be applied to
those who attend the lectures.
This is an age of high pressure entertainment; if
the University wants to keep the students from high
way flesh pots, it must put on something that will com
pete favorably with Jean Harlow and Mickey Mouse.
A glance at the list of lecture subjects for the past sea
son reveals nothing likely to make theater managers
lose sleep.
* •»! * *
R DOUBTLESS the topics were fascinating at the turn
of the century, and they might thrill the soul of
a Ph.D. today, but the average student prefers a fan
dancer. A discussion of the psychology of Mother
Goose Rhymes can hardly be expected to hold its own
against Zorita.
Traditionally dry as new blotting paper, the Tues
day. Lecture has no place in the University today. The
rough doesn't want his culture with too much top
spin. Of course, a few of the Paly populace rejoice
in strengthening their will-power by sitting through
90 minutes of torture, but the University might do well
to remember that the Paly populace pays no tuition
fees.
Whether Stanford remembers it or not, it is here to
educate students. It has a beautiful set of formal
courses, labs, and other equipment used in the intra
venous injection of learning, but outside of that it
offers nothing. Blithely it splends students' money on
lectures so dull they would make Puck break into
tears. Naturally no undergraduates attend.
* i'fi #
W/lIEN the faculty gets through squabbling about
who is going to manage the new theater, we will
have a large auditorium practically begging for use.
A dozen Tuesday Lectures running concurrently with
a barrel of lantern slides thrown in could not fill the
first row.
If the Tuesday Lecture goes to bat as "entertain
ment" the tiles on the new roof will writhe in agony
and so will we.

This is an age of high pressure entertainment; if

R DOUBTLESS the topics were fascinating at the turn

Traditionally dry as new blotting paper, the Tues

in strengthening their will-power by sitting through
90 minutes of torture, but the University might do well
to remember that the Paly populace pays no tuition
fees.
Whether Stanford remembers it or not, it is here to
educate students. It has a beautiful set of formal
courses, labs, and other equipment used in the intra
venous injection of learning, but outside of that it
offers nothing. Blithely it splends students' money on
lectures so dull they would make Puck break into
tears. Naturally no undergraduates attend.

Exposed to this sirroco is a somnolent audience con

Public Exercises Committee (legal guardian of the

an assorted group of Paly citizenry. With the excep

suffering. Occasionally, a student wanders in by mis
take and dozes unhappily on the back row.
Ostensibly intended to put a polish on the Stanford
diamond-in-the-rough, the Tuesday Lecture is really
the University's gift to any of Palo Alto's latter-day
saints with a taste for self-mortification. But even as
a gift, it is not received with a chorus of cheers. If
a dozen souls should appear, the Committee would feel
that it had cause to pat itself on the back.
