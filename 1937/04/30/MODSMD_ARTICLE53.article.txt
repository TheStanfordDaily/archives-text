# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
the more distinguishable ingredients of
Tuesday noon's abortive absorption at Encina was
what appeared to be coarse spinach, faintly tinged with
green, and what eventually was agreed to be a saline
cabbage cut in narrow strips. An immediate investi
gation on the part of interested parties who were
acting in behalf of other interested parties evidenced
the following exhumation:
Saturday morning just before 10 o'clock, a truck
full of cabbages was seen to plunge into the muck on
the marshy side of the Bayshore. Before long the
truck had sunk into murky semi-obscurity; somewhat
earlier, however, another truck drew as near as safety
would permit, and disgorged a driver and a loader
from its cab. They tossed aside Ihcir coats, rolled up
their sleeves, got on the slow-submerging truck, threw
all the cabbages into their own truck, ducked back to
shore, ducked inside the truck, and trekked South
(toward Encina?).
jVOT long bephore the Big Meet, one oph our
sophomore transphcrs took his teeth to the den
tit's ophphice and submitted them phor a phew re
pairs.
During the intermittent intermissions conversation
inevitably driphted phrom athletics in general to track
in particular, and phrom Tanphoran to the Big Meet
in particular. The all-but-supine Stanphordifc raised
high his voice dephending Palo Alto's College. High
raised the dentist he his drill and said:
I'm a Cal man, myself; open wide, please.'
() ME of the Daily's reporters was recently discour
aged from holding his nose in the air for news, and
possibly journalistically disillusioned for eons to come.
The reporter, I hear, ferretted out, a story exposing the
adventures of a co-frosh, a fraternity pledge, who had
been laying a smoke-screen from his exhaust one day,
going about 40 on the campus one day, and vindictively
chasing students, hall-men, in his car one day, and I
mean one (1) day. That was fun, but it was more
talking to Men's Council. Anyway, the reporter
smiled smugly as he handed in his yarn.
Wending his way to that paradise of all Stanford,
Encina, he found his room-mate sulking in a corner
among a pile of his own dirty clothes, and, in a futile
effort to cheer him up, told the story, replete with
complacent comment and a few libelous interjections.
Sole reply was a resentful but resigned:
"Dear God, do I have to listen to his lies about
me and pay $10, too?"
Every hundredth line of OUR HASHER JUNIOR
will hereafter be saved and placed at interest with
the government. This will serve notice on the DAILY
that it must equal this amount and place it in my
account.

The reporter, I hear, ferretted out, a story exposing the
adventures of a co-frosh, a fraternity pledge, who had
been laying a smoke-screen from his exhaust one day,
going about 40 on the campus one day, and vindictively
chasing students, hall-men, in his car one day, and I
mean one (1) day. That was fun, but it was more
talking to Men's Council. Anyway, the reporter
smiled smugly as he handed in his yarn.
Wending his way to that paradise of all Stanford,
Encina, he found his room-mate sulking in a corner
among a pile of his own dirty clothes, and, in a futile
effort to cheer him up, told the story, replete with
complacent comment and a few libelous interjections.
Sole reply was a resentful but resigned:
"Dear God, do I have to listen to his lies about
me and pay $10, too?"
Every hundredth line of OUR HASHER JUNIOR
will hereafter be saved and placed at interest with
the government. This will serve notice on the DAILY
that it must equal this amount and place it in my
account.
the more distinguishable ingredients of
Tuesday noon's abortive absorption at Encina was
what appeared to be coarse spinach, faintly tinged with
green, and what eventually was agreed to be a saline
cabbage cut in narrow strips. An immediate investi
gation on the part of interested parties who were
acting in behalf of other interested parties evidenced
the following exhumation:
Saturday morning just before 10 o'clock, a truck
full of cabbages was seen to plunge into the muck on
the marshy side of the Bayshore. Before long the
truck had sunk into murky semi-obscurity; somewhat
earlier, however, another truck drew as near as safety
would permit, and disgorged a driver and a loader
from its cab. They tossed aside Ihcir coats, rolled up
their sleeves, got on the slow-submerging truck, threw
all the cabbages into their own truck, ducked back to
shore, ducked inside the truck, and trekked South
(toward Encina?).
