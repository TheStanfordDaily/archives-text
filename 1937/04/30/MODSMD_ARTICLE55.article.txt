WELL, lIASHER LAUGHED
Our Hasher, Sir:
I wish to correct your very ficti
tious story about the overturned car
on the Delt driveway which appeared
in your column of April 26. The
story was rather amusing and not in
tentionally malicious, but it does give
the Dclt house an entirely unde
served "black-eye."
The accident occurred while re
turning from a rehearsal for a play.
The "Delt discuster" did not own the
car nor was he driving it; it was the
lady's car and she was driving. The
"discuster" aroused about half a
dozen Dells on the sleeping porch
who immediately rushed down to
give him aid. They did not "laugh
quite cynically" and they did not
"put him to bed." The Sigma Nus
arrived on the scene after it was all
over. I hate to ruin your amusing
story, but I was one of the first to be
aroused and am acquainted with the
entire situation.
Malcolm Black,
