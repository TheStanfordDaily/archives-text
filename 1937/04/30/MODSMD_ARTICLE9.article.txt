# Bowl Contest Brings $100 To 7 Winners
## Successful Contestants Offer 'Laurence Frost Amphitheatre' as Title 
### 
"Laurence Frost Amphitheatre."
So Stanford's new open bowl has
! been named by seven students, joint
| winners of the $100 prize offered by
| Mr. John Frost, donor of the bowl.
The winners: Richard Dudman,
; Thomas W. Wills, Charles W. Ros-
I sier, Robert H. Munger, Margaret
| Woolverton, Daniel J. Hewitt, and
I Ralph Keating.
To the winners, the Comptroller's
! office will mail checks for $14.29 im
; mediately.
Decision of the judges, Aim on E.
j Roth, Ray Lyman Wilbur, Mr. Frost,
; and Jim Reynolds, was made yes-
I terday after a series of telephonic
j revotes were taken from Dr. Wil
' bur's office.
Simplicity Important
It was finally decided that, since
| the area surrounding the amphi
j theatre will be called the "Laurence
j Frost Memorial Grove,"' no mention
j of the word "memorial" be made in
i the bowl name. The newly selected
j title offered simplicity, a prime req
| uisite, according to the judges.
Several entrants submitted the
I selected name prefixed by the word
I "the" but because "the line must
I be drawn somewhere," judges de
j cided this was a different name.
New Problem Arises
In his announcement of the deci-
I sion, Dr. Wilbur points to another
] naming problem to be faced. The
I Memorial Hall, which is the official
title of the new theatre, includes the
j little theatre and the main hall. At
1 the present time Stanford already
has a little theatre on the Quad.
Differentiation between the old
little theatre, the new little theatre,
the main hall, and the amphitheatre
1 may cause confusion, Dr. Wilbur
! explains.
