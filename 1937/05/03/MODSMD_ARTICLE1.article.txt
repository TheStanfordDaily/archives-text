BILBAO, Spain, May 2 (UP). â€”
Three thousand Italian volunteers
were killed or wounded today when
Basque defenders of Bilbao, re
enforced by 20 battalions of Santan
der militia and Asturian "dynami
teros," stormed rebel positions in
the Bermeo salient, according to of
ficial Loyalist announcements.
General Franco announced,
through his radio stations at Burgos
and San Sebastian, that he saw "no
objection to the evacuation of the
civil population of Bilbao under the
auspices of Great Britain and
France."
British destroyers and French
warships in the Bay of Biscay took
up positions to protect fefugee boats
plowing through the choppy waters,
145 miles up the Coast to the French
frontier ports of Saint Jean de Luz
and Bayonne.
It was expected that 30,000
Basques, mostly children, would be
removed from Bilbao immediately.
Others will be evacuated as quickly
as transport becomes available.
