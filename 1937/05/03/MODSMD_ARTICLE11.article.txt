## 
### 
Americans have played the lead
ing role in the development of the
Hawaiian Islands. From such a
viewpoint Dr. Harold Whitman
Bradley, assistant professor of his
tory, will this evening review the
short but colorful history of the Ha
waiian Islands on the Stanford Ra
dio Hour from KGO at 8:30.
"By the time the United States ac
quired Oregon and California, the
close tics which bound the archi
palago to the United States and
made annexation virtually inevit
able had been firmly established,"
says Dr. Bradley. The speaker is
assistant professor of history.
