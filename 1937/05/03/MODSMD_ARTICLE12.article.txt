# Theater Benefit Aids Drive Fund
## 
### 
Profits on the Varsity Theater's
benefit showing Friday of "Robin
Hood of El Dorado" added $9.30 to
the Convalescent Home Drive Fund,
after $25 was paid for the use of the
theater and another $5 for printing
the tickets.
Helping to make the show a suc
cess, 200 children from the grammar
school on the campus paid 10 cents
each to see the picture.
