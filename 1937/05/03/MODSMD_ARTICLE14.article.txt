# Farm Delays On Tax Payments
## Row Council Waits For State's Decision 
### 
The state unemployment tax, as
far as Stanford living groups are
concerned, will remain unpaidâ€”for
the time being at least.
That was the decision last night of
Don Moulton, new Interfraternity
Council president, when he an
nounced that Farm houses and eat
ing clubs will keep their check
books closed until further is learned
about tax requirements.
Meet Wednesday
The Council will meet Wednesday
night to hear the opinions of Stan
ley Morrison, professor of law; El
mer Fagan, professor of economics;
and Warren Turner, fraternity
auditor.
After the status of campus organ
izations is learned definitely from
the California Unemployment Re
serves Commission this week, Moul
ton and his colleagues will draw up
the "correct procedux - e," then let
each individual house and club do
as it pleases.
Officials Confer
John L. Stuton, deputy registrar
of the commission, registered all
campus organizations hiring hash
ers and managers when he was here
last week. He is conferring with the
commission's rules and regulations
commission, will notify Moulton to
morrow or Wednesday whether his
living groups are subject to the tax.
Final yes-or-no on the question
of paying the tax at all may depend
upon a national Social Security Act
ruling still undecided on the status
of fraternities and sororities as
"employers," according to Moulton.
The California regulations are based
on the national ones.
