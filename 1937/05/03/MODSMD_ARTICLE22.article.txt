# 'Lady Precious' Clicks as Comedy
## 
### JIM STONE 
"Lady Precious Stream" should
teach us some sort of object lesson;
when the choice of that play was
questioned, Mr. Lange reassuringly
promised us entertainment. And en
tertainment —no more and no less—
was what we got. It was neither the
heavy, half-baked pageantry which
many of us must have feared, nor
was it a dull sacrifice to culture and
hr t.
But all we have to say it that it's
tlucky that the Chinese style of
drama conveniently happens to co
incide with those things which have
put English speaking audiences in
the aisles for years. The audience
Friday night laughed almost solely
at things which, when placed (and
they were) in last fall's Gaieties,
wcYe labeled "gags."
Things like the goose falling from
the light bridge made us wonder if
Dr. Hsiung didn't have a better eye
to the tastes of western audiences
than to the mere interest of Amer
ican and British play-goers in Chi
nese drama. At any rate, we were
too gross to see past such stunts and
see much in the play itself. But I

| don't think we were supposed to. At ]
i any rate, we had a good time wheth- j
I er we got the artistic angle or not. |
As for the cast, little can be said,
chiefly because the actors neither
I did, nor were supposed to figure in
the production as characters. It |
must have been a problem to sub- 1
due personality as much as was j
done; the effect which remained was '
that of having watched voices rath- :
er than people, an effect heightened
of course by the unfamiliar make
up (good) and the costuming (bet- j
: ter).
Chapin Shines
j If we must mention names, we I
i liked, first of all, Lcland Chapin i
as the "Reader" and Kathleen Camp- j
bell as Madame Wang—particularly i
their voices. But to distinguish be- j
tween Phyllis Lakin, Jim Corner, J
Frances Farmer, and the generals
and the sisters and the cousins and i
—but it would be impossible and j
i unnecessary. The whole group
| worked together wtih smooth and |
J well-timed teamwork.
In the first part of this review we
laid too much stress on the unique j
| features of the play, and in the mid- 1

die, on the lack of personality of
the actors (justifiable). And yet the
production was curiously alive; we
can lay this only to the door of skill
ful direction.
Natural Pace Attained
What the process was we do not
know, but the show had an easy,
natural pace which, with the orig
inal informality of the piece itself,
rather took in the audience. It was,
all in all, definitely something to see
for (multiple choice: underline one)
humor, novelty, charm, your mon
ey's worth, the hell of it.
Perhaps, since this is the end of
the year, a word or two about the
"season" would not be amiss. Mr.
Lange, as someone has already
said, has "mugged it heavy" for us,
and Friday night he "mugged it
light." And he's given us beautiful
pictures, excellent acting, and some
of the best all-around staging this
campus has seen. He has done
things delicately or dramatically de
pending on the time and place, and
at worst has given us good enter
tainment. Now, God and the new
theater willing, let him give us those
things again next year, and a play.
