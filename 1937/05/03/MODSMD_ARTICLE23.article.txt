# Hotel Strike Fails to Stop 'Barn Danee'
## 
### 
Striking hotel-workers in San
j Francisco, coinciding evacuation of
} the Beta house, and quick thinking
| on the part of Jeeb Halaby saved
! dates last Saturday night.
Word came through to Stanford
I about 5:45 Saturday afternoon that
j the strike in the city necessitated
| postponement to May 21 of the Con
j valescent Home benefit Barn Dance,
j scheduled at the Palace Hotel that
i evening. Meanwhile, at Stanford,
i the Beta house had the same morn
j ing been cleared of furnishings,
] pending reconstruction. The empty
I "barn" inspired the Betas in gener
al and Jeeb Halaby in particular to
organize a last-minute substitute
1 dance in the house.
Halaby contacted Dean Yost post
haste, and received provisional per
j mission to hold the affaii*, with the
i ratification of Ex Committee. He
then phoned Esther Pelton, who ob
-1 tained the necessary okay by a tele
phonic poll. Patrons were rounded
up, and the "grapevine" news of
; the dance followed clese
| ly after word of the dinging of the
city frolic.
Approximately 50 couples were
' present at the Farm affair, which
I was termed "surprisingly well-man
j nered" by one of the Beta hosts. San
Jose and Oakland night spots, as well
| as Paly theaters, also undei'went a
| night of unexpected albeit profitable
j popularity caused by the influx of
| other couples who had planned or-
I iginally to boom up the bayshore
I Saturday night.
