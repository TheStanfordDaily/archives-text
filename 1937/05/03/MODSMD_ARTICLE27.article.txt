# Service in 15 S.F. Hotels At Standstill
## Employees Seek Shorter Hours as Stars Serve Selves, Climb Stairs 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 2 (UP).â€”
The essential services of 15 major
San Francisco hotels were pai'a
lyzed tonight by a strike of serv
ice employees which raised, for the
first time in a major Pacific Coast
labor dispute, the question of the
place of the so-called confidential
employee in labor relations.
Union demands for preferential
hiring and five-day 40-hour weeks
for clerks and office employees of the
world famous hostelries led to the
strike which left the hotels dark
and partially deserted tonight.
Managers Work
As hotel managers and depart
ment heads ran elevators, answered
telephones, and distributed mail for
the several thousand patrons still in
the hotels, there were indications
that a swift settlement might be
reached.
Bellboys, waiters, busboys, cham
bermaids, elevator operators, and
kitchen help left the hotel rooms,
desks and dining halls deserted.
Saturday night dances were cancel
ed, and radio broadcasters had to
readjust their schedules.
Martini Runs Elevator
Nino Martini, movie tenor, posed
becomingly at the controls of a hotel
elevator to show guests were ready
and willing to help themselves. Fat
man Oliver Hardy, movie comedian,
surveyed disconsolately the prospect
of walking 11 flights to his room in
another hotel. Jean Hersholt, an
other film figure, willingly climbed
the steps at the Palace.
Shirley Joy Ellis, newly crowned
Miss Western America in a beauty
queen contest conducted by the 1939
Pacific International Exposition,
found her queenly prerogatives un
availing in efforts to get service at
the Sir Francis Drake.
Many guests left the hotels, going
to those in the city not affected or
to East Bay, peninsula or Del Monte
accommodations.
