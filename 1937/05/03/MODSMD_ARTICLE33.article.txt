# CAMPUS OPINION
## SMARTS AT SMARTNESS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have read Professor Harris' very
smart and extremely vacuous "Es
say on Apple-Polishing" with ad
miration and disgust. But one (not
an associate professor of history)
might point out to Professor Harris
some of the fallacies in his argu
ment. The apple of the good book
was sought after by our common an
cestors (perish the thought) in the
name of the cult of knowledge—and
would Professor Harris affirm that
knowledge is an evil thing? Would
he, in avoiding the apple, revert
back, or ask us to revert back, to a
condition of complete absence of
knowledge? As a student at Stan
ford, it seems to me that the apple
of knowledge is exactly the fruit 1
came here to get. I understand, fur
ther, that the first demand upon the
hard-working (?) professors' time is
to assist me in polishing that very
apple.
No Regrets
The second apple mentioned in the
learned essay is that which lured
Atalanta to her "first false step"—
toward love. She wasn't so sorry,
afterwards, if I remember my West
ern Civ correctly, that she had en
tered the cult of the apple. If you
will allow the substitution of broth
erly love, friendship, fellowship, or
what have you for the love that
blasted Atalanta's life, this apple,
too, finds a place on the Stanford
campus (not that pure and unadul
terated love finds no place here—
God forbid). For it seems to me that
the apple of fellowship between fac
ulty and student is a fruit most as
siduously to be cultivated. It is
precisely this over-exaggerated fac
ulty dislike of apple-polishers that
prevents Stanford students from en
joying the personal inspiration and
intellectual stimulation that extra
classroom relationships with the pro
fessors—with some of them, at least
—could give.
The third apple designated by the
professor as "regrettable fruit" was
that tossed by Paris in an ancient
beauty-contest, to set in motion the
train of events that led to the de

] struction of the city of Troy. But
something at least might be said for
the cult of beauty, even on the Stan
lord campus—or mightn't it? A lit
tle more beauty of conduct—even by
the professors—a good deal more of
the cult of the beauty commonly
known as art, somewhat more culti
vation of the beauty of freedom—for
the expression of all schools of
opinion, among students and faculty
alike, or just plain realization by en
gineers and others that there is
beauty, of sorts, in the world, aside
from the business of making a liv
ing. All these things, and more,
might be cultivated in the name of
beauty. Poor old Paris might have
started something, but he knew
beauty when he saw it.
Seeks Improvement
f Far from me to destroy the halo
I round that head. But as one who
I came to college in the innocent be
lief that professors were here to
help me to achieve that evanescent
thing called learning, I once asked
! a professor to point out to me the
' errors in my work and the way to
! improvement. But do you think the
j professor was interested in my
problem? He was not. He was in
| terested in his "soporific books
; about Bulgarian atrocities." Worse
j still, »iy pals took me aside and
j made it plain to be—oh, how plain!
—that that was apple-polishing; and
j that the apple is a "regrettable fruit"
i at Stanford.
We all agree — even Mr. Harris
' and I —that the grade system is a
! horror. But Mr. Harris seems to be
j confessing his own subjection to it,
| just as do the students who are
(afraid they will be thought apple
; polishers when they show a genuine
' thirst for knowledge. Does the pro
t fessor confess he can't spot pure
apple-polishing a mile off? Alter be
ing apple-polished by experts all
these years, is he still susceptible?
And is the student body or any part
of it so dumb as not to be able to
see that the professor recognized the
beast? Why can't we disregard the
grade system, since we must have
it, and recognize that the current

\ prejudice against apple - polishing
does more harm than good in keep
ing students and professors apart?
I Isn't it about time that the profes-
I sors grew up and decided they ought
jto encourage closer relationships,
I and consign both the horrible grade
I system and the apple - polishing
I bogie-man to the eternal fires of
j hell?

The Editor, Sir:
I have read Professor Harris' very
smart and extremely vacuous "Es
say on Apple-Polishing" with ad
miration and disgust. But one (not
an associate professor of history)
might point out to Professor Harris
some of the fallacies in his argu
ment. The apple of the good book
was sought after by our common an
cestors (perish the thought) in the
name of the cult of knowledge—and
would Professor Harris affirm that
knowledge is an evil thing? Would
he, in avoiding the apple, revert
back, or ask us to revert back, to a
condition of complete absence of
knowledge? As a student at Stan
ford, it seems to me that the apple
of knowledge is exactly the fruit 1
came here to get. I understand, fur
ther, that the first demand upon the
hard-working (?) professors' time is
to assist me in polishing that very
apple.

The second apple mentioned in the
learned essay is that which lured
Atalanta to her "first false step"—
toward love. She wasn't so sorry,
afterwards, if I remember my West
ern Civ correctly, that she had en
tered the cult of the apple. If you
will allow the substitution of broth
erly love, friendship, fellowship, or
what have you for the love that
blasted Atalanta's life, this apple,
too, finds a place on the Stanford
campus (not that pure and unadul
terated love finds no place here—
God forbid). For it seems to me that
the apple of fellowship between fac
ulty and student is a fruit most as
siduously to be cultivated. It is
precisely this over-exaggerated fac
ulty dislike of apple-polishers that
prevents Stanford students from en
joying the personal inspiration and
intellectual stimulation that extra
classroom relationships with the pro
fessors—with some of them, at least
—could give.
The third apple designated by the
professor as "regrettable fruit" was
that tossed by Paris in an ancient
beauty-contest, to set in motion the
train of events that led to the de

] struction of the city of Troy. But
something at least might be said for
the cult of beauty, even on the Stan
lord campus—or mightn't it? A lit
tle more beauty of conduct—even by
the professors—a good deal more of
the cult of the beauty commonly
known as art, somewhat more culti
vation of the beauty of freedom—for
the expression of all schools of
opinion, among students and faculty
alike, or just plain realization by en
gineers and others that there is
beauty, of sorts, in the world, aside
from the business of making a liv
ing. All these things, and more,
might be cultivated in the name of
beauty. Poor old Paris might have

knowledge? As a student at Stan
ford, it seems to me that the apple
of knowledge is exactly the fruit 1
came here to get. I understand, fur
ther, that the first demand upon the
hard-working (?) professors' time is
to assist me in polishing that very
apple.
No Regrets
The second apple mentioned in the
learned essay is that which lured
Atalanta to her "first false step"—
toward love. She wasn't so sorry,
afterwards, if I remember my West
ern Civ correctly, that she had en
tered the cult of the apple. If you
will allow the substitution of broth
erly love, friendship, fellowship, or
what have you for the love that
blasted Atalanta's life, this apple,
too, finds a place on the Stanford
campus (not that pure and unadul
terated love finds no place here—
God forbid). For it seems to me that
the apple of fellowship between fac
ulty and student is a fruit most as
siduously to be cultivated. It is
precisely this over-exaggerated fac
ulty dislike of apple-polishers that
prevents Stanford students from en
joying the personal inspiration and
intellectual stimulation that extra
classroom relationships with the pro
fessors—with some of them, at least
—could give.
The third apple designated by the
professor as "regrettable fruit" was
that tossed by Paris in an ancient
beauty-contest, to set in motion the
train of events that led to the de

] struction of the city of Troy. But
something at least might be said for
the cult of beauty, even on the Stan
lord campus—or mightn't it? A lit
tle more beauty of conduct—even by
the professors—a good deal more of
the cult of the beauty commonly
known as art, somewhat more culti
vation of the beauty of freedom—for
the expression of all schools of
opinion, among students and faculty
alike, or just plain realization by en
gineers and others that there is
beauty, of sorts, in the world, aside
from the business of making a liv
ing. All these things, and more,
might be cultivated in the name of
beauty. Poor old Paris might have
started something, but he knew
beauty when he saw it.

The Editor, Sir:
I have read Professor Harris' very
smart and extremely vacuous "Es
say on Apple-Polishing" with ad
miration and disgust. But one (not
an associate professor of history)
might point out to Professor Harris
some of the fallacies in his argu
ment. The apple of the good book
was sought after by our common an
cestors (perish the thought) in the
name of the cult of knowledge—and
would Professor Harris affirm that
knowledge is an evil thing? Would
he, in avoiding the apple, revert
back, or ask us to revert back, to a
condition of complete absence of
knowledge? As a student at Stan
ford, it seems to me that the apple
of knowledge is exactly the fruit 1
came here to get. I understand, fur
ther, that the first demand upon the
hard-working (?) professors' time is
to assist me in polishing that very
apple.
