THE RECORD BOOK:
AN APPRAISAL
Track records are funny things,
you know it?
To some people they are nauseat
ing things; when a non-track-en
thusiast hears a bunch of the boys
start talking about the afternoon's
track meet, and asking what time
each race was won in, he usually
leaves the room, with reverbera
tions of heartfelt disgust or deep
seated ecstasy still ringing in his
ears as each mark is mentioned and
receives its due comment from the
assemblage.
I know how that is, because I have
sensed the same thing with swim
ming records myself. If you're not
familiar with the sports figures and
the various records they have made
in their journey down their short
pathway of prominence, you begin
to wonder why so much is said
about records, being meaningless
as they are.
And then if you try to get on the
boat, and begin to learn them, you'll
get on the wrong track, like the guy
who read about Gilhula's 4:54 quar
ter mile up here a few years back,
and thought all the Stanford dis
tance swimmers were a bunch of
heels because they swam around
5:12, way behind the "4:54 turned in
by some guy named Gilhula from
U.S.C. last week."
Still further, you'll go mad if you
try to keep abreast with swimming
records, hot water, cold water, long
pools, short pools, very short pools,
freestyle, backstroke, rough water,
high school, college, conference, met
ric, English, etc., etc., far through the
night, from 25 yards on up to the
Buenos Aires Three Day Main Event.
TO GET BACK TO TRACK
Track records, you'll be surprised,
are nearly as flustering. Although
you never hear about it, there are a
number of conditions that can influ
ence the speed or height which an
athlete can attain completely inde
pendent from his personal condition
and ability.
The track may be hard or soft, wet
or dry, narrow or wide, and the race
may be a tough one with flailing
arms or a cinch boat race. The run
ners may be boxed around the first,
second or third turns, and the con
ditions may favor the time in strange
ways like the dark tunnel on the
Coliseum straightaway in Los An
geles.
Also, the judges may stop their
clocks on 9.2 as they did at Fresno
with George Anderson two years
ago, only to give him 9.4 because
9.2 is too fast for a man to run. There
is a human "personal equation" or
"butch factor" which none of us can
criticize.
The several and varied outfits that
award these records to various ath
letic accomplishments and give their
publicity release to the World Al
manac, possess different standards of
attainment. The International Ama
teur Athletic Federation, which
awards world records, meets some
what biennially, and is a skimpy
bunch of boys, being careful to ac
cept nothing done with light shot,
or short or windy track, no matter
how infinitesimal may be the dis
crepancy.
This is all very fine, except that
they accept Olympic Games marks
hands down without a sitting, be
cause they are done in the I.A.A.F.'s
"backyard." And don't forget the
butch ft*ctor.
The rest of the awarding outfits,
the A.A.U., on American records, the
N.C.A.A., on American collegiate
records, measure on down to the
smaller conferences, leagues, and
college publicity offices, who score
up the individual college records,
with different amounts of discrimi
nation present at their awarding
sessions.
When Ralph Metcalf set three rec
ords in the same day in 1932 at Chi
cago, the N.C.A.A. accepted them, but
the higher-ups didn't, because there
was a wind blowing; countless cases
pass some judgments, fail others.
THE LOCAL ANGLE
At Stanford we have a set of
"Stanford records" kept by Don Lie
bendorfer, along with meet records
and conference records which are
not so closely under his sole juris
diction. We are proud of this
list, because it stacks up well with
any college list you'll ever see.
Meet records of course should be
a carefully selected slate, as their
name qualifies them, that they were
made in meets. Stanford records, on
the other hand, imply a list of the
best achievements ever done by
Stanford men, whether accomplished
in 4'■> laps around Lagunita Court,
or on a freshly smoothed Angell Field
track, so long as they are measured
accurately, and fairly.
Why, then, did not Humbert Smith
receive credit for his 6-7'k high
jump against U.C.L.A. last year?
It's the best ever done by a Stanford
men, and the fact that he did it on i
his fourth trial shouldn't exactly
ding Hum as a failure, should it?
And why, then, does not Tiger Al
exander go on the all-time books for
his 4:18.4 mfle last week? It's the
best ever done by a Stanford man;
what difference if it was in prac
tice and behind Norm Bright? Bright
was no wind-break; Tiger ran 4:18.4,
didn't he?

a carefully selected slate, as their
name qualifies them, that they were
made in meets. Stanford records, on
the other hand, imply a list of the
best achievements ever done by
Stanford men, whether accomplished
in 4'■> laps around Lagunita Court,
or on a freshly smoothed Angell Field
track, so long as they are measured
accurately, and fairly.
Why, then, did not Humbert Smith
receive credit for his 6-7'k high
jump against U.C.L.A. last year?
It's the best ever done by a Stanford
men, and the fact that he did it on i
his fourth trial shouldn't exactly
ding Hum as a failure, should it?
And why, then, does not Tiger Al
exander go on the all-time books for
his 4:18.4 mfle last week? It's the
best ever done by a Stanford man;
what difference if it was in prac
tice and behind Norm Bright? Bright
was no wind-break; Tiger ran 4:18.4,
didn't he?

THE RECORD BOOK:
AN APPRAISAL
Track records are funny things,
you know it?
To some people they are nauseat
ing things; when a non-track-en
thusiast hears a bunch of the boys
start talking about the afternoon's
track meet, and asking what time
each race was won in, he usually
leaves the room, with reverbera
tions of heartfelt disgust or deep
seated ecstasy still ringing in his
ears as each mark is mentioned and
receives its due comment from the
assemblage.
I know how that is, because I have
sensed the same thing with swim
ming records myself. If you're not
familiar with the sports figures and
the various records they have made
in their journey down their short
pathway of prominence, you begin
to wonder why so much is said
about records, being meaningless
as they are.
And then if you try to get on the
boat, and begin to learn them, you'll
get on the wrong track, like the guy
who read about Gilhula's 4:54 quar
ter mile up here a few years back,
and thought all the Stanford dis
tance swimmers were a bunch of
heels because they swam around
5:12, way behind the "4:54 turned in
by some guy named Gilhula from
U.S.C. last week."
Still further, you'll go mad if you
try to keep abreast with swimming
records, hot water, cold water, long
pools, short pools, very short pools,
freestyle, backstroke, rough water,
high school, college, conference, met
ric, English, etc., etc., far through the
night, from 25 yards on up to the
Buenos Aires Three Day Main Event.
TO GET BACK TO TRACK
Track records, you'll be surprised,
are nearly as flustering. Although
you never hear about it, there are a
number of conditions that can influ
ence the speed or height which an
athlete can attain completely inde
pendent from his personal condition
and ability.
The track may be hard or soft, wet
or dry, narrow or wide, and the race
may be a tough one with flailing
arms or a cinch boat race. The run
ners may be boxed around the first,
second or third turns, and the con
ditions may favor the time in strange
ways like the dark tunnel on the
Coliseum straightaway in Los An
geles.
Also, the judges may stop their
clocks on 9.2 as they did at Fresno
with George Anderson two years
ago, only to give him 9.4 because
9.2 is too fast for a man to run. There
is a human "personal equation" or
"butch factor" which none of us can
criticize.
The several and varied outfits that
award these records to various ath
letic accomplishments and give their
publicity release to the World Al
manac, possess different standards of
attainment. The International Ama
teur Athletic Federation, which
awards world records, meets some
what biennially, and is a skimpy
bunch of boys, being careful to ac
cept nothing done with light shot,
or short or windy track, no matter
how infinitesimal may be the dis
crepancy.
This is all very fine, except that
they accept Olympic Games marks
hands down without a sitting, be
cause they are done in the I.A.A.F.'s
"backyard." And don't forget the
butch ft*ctor.
The rest of the awarding outfits,
the A.A.U., on American records, the
N.C.A.A., on American collegiate
records, measure on down to the
smaller conferences, leagues, and
college publicity offices, who score
up the individual college records,
with different amounts of discrimi
nation present at their awarding
sessions.
When Ralph Metcalf set three rec
ords in the same day in 1932 at Chi
cago, the N.C.A.A. accepted them, but
the higher-ups didn't, because there
was a wind blowing; countless cases
pass some judgments, fail others.
THE LOCAL ANGLE
At Stanford we have a set of
"Stanford records" kept by Don Lie
bendorfer, along with meet records
and conference records which are
not so closely under his sole juris
diction. We are proud of this
list, because it stacks up well with
any college list you'll ever see.
Meet records of course should be
a carefully selected slate, as their

cause they are done in the I.A.A.F.'s
"backyard." And don't forget the
butch ft*ctor.
The rest of the awarding outfits,
the A.A.U., on American records, the
N.C.A.A., on American collegiate
records, measure on down to the
smaller conferences, leagues, and
college publicity offices, who score
up the individual college records,
with different amounts of discrimi
nation present at their awarding
sessions.
When Ralph Metcalf set three rec
ords in the same day in 1932 at Chi
cago, the N.C.A.A. accepted them, but
the higher-ups didn't, because there
was a wind blowing; countless cases
pass some judgments, fail others.
THE LOCAL ANGLE
At Stanford we have a set of
"Stanford records" kept by Don Lie
bendorfer, along with meet records
and conference records which are
not so closely under his sole juris
diction. We are proud of this
list, because it stacks up well with
any college list you'll ever see.
Meet records of course should be
a carefully selected slate, as their
name qualifies them, that they were
made in meets. Stanford records, on
the other hand, imply a list of the
best achievements ever done by
Stanford men, whether accomplished
in 4'■> laps around Lagunita Court,
or on a freshly smoothed Angell Field
track, so long as they are measured
accurately, and fairly.
Why, then, did not Humbert Smith
receive credit for his 6-7'k high
jump against U.C.L.A. last year?
It's the best ever done by a Stanford
men, and the fact that he did it on i
his fourth trial shouldn't exactly
ding Hum as a failure, should it?
And why, then, does not Tiger Al
exander go on the all-time books for
his 4:18.4 mfle last week? It's the
best ever done by a Stanford man;
what difference if it was in prac
tice and behind Norm Bright? Bright
was no wind-break; Tiger ran 4:18.4,
didn't he?

THE RECORD BOOK:
AN APPRAISAL
Track records are funny things,
you know it?
To some people they are nauseat
ing things; when a non-track-en
thusiast hears a bunch of the boys
start talking about the afternoon's
track meet, and asking what time
each race was won in, he usually
leaves the room, with reverbera
tions of heartfelt disgust or deep
seated ecstasy still ringing in his
ears as each mark is mentioned and
receives its due comment from the
assemblage.
I know how that is, because I have
sensed the same thing with swim
ming records myself. If you're not
familiar with the sports figures and
the various records they have made
in their journey down their short
pathway of prominence, you begin
to wonder why so much is said
about records, being meaningless
as they are.
And then if you try to get on the
boat, and begin to learn them, you'll
get on the wrong track, like the guy
who read about Gilhula's 4:54 quar
ter mile up here a few years back,
and thought all the Stanford dis
tance swimmers were a bunch of
heels because they swam around
5:12, way behind the "4:54 turned in
by some guy named Gilhula from
U.S.C. last week."
Still further, you'll go mad if you
try to keep abreast with swimming
records, hot water, cold water, long
pools, short pools, very short pools,
freestyle, backstroke, rough water,
high school, college, conference, met
ric, English, etc., etc., far through the
night, from 25 yards on up to the
Buenos Aires Three Day Main Event.
TO GET BACK TO TRACK
Track records, you'll be surprised,
are nearly as flustering. Although
you never hear about it, there are a
number of conditions that can influ
ence the speed or height which an
athlete can attain completely inde
pendent from his personal condition
and ability.
The track may be hard or soft, wet
or dry, narrow or wide, and the race
may be a tough one with flailing
arms or a cinch boat race. The run
ners may be boxed around the first,
second or third turns, and the con
ditions may favor the time in strange
ways like the dark tunnel on the
Coliseum straightaway in Los An
geles.
Also, the judges may stop their
clocks on 9.2 as they did at Fresno
with George Anderson two years
ago, only to give him 9.4 because
9.2 is too fast for a man to run. There
is a human "personal equation" or
"butch factor" which none of us can
criticize.
The several and varied outfits that
award these records to various ath
letic accomplishments and give their
publicity release to the World Al
manac, possess different standards of
attainment. The International Ama
teur Athletic Federation, which
awards world records, meets some
what biennially, and is a skimpy
bunch of boys, being careful to ac
cept nothing done with light shot,
or short or windy track, no matter
how infinitesimal may be the dis
crepancy.
This is all very fine, except that
they accept Olympic Games marks
hands down without a sitting, be
cause they are done in the I.A.A.F.'s
"backyard." And don't forget the
butch ft*ctor.
