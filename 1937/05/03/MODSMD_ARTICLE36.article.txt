# Mascots for the Chicago Cubs
## 
### 

MANAGER CHARLIE GRI-.IM of the Chicago Cubs baseball
team thought he had trouble enough handling his menagerie of two
footed animals, on opening day of the season. Then along came these
Bear cubs presented to him as mascots. With them is Mrs. Leonard
Boyles, who presented them. They were imported from Sonora,
Mexico.
