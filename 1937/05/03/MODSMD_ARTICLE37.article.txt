## Yanks Win Davis Matches 
### 
LAKESIDE, SAN FRANCISCO,
May 2 (U.R). —The United States made
a clean sweep of its Davis Cup tennis
vie with Japan by winning two sin
gles matches today to complete the
five-match series.
J. Donald Budge, the red-haired
boy from Oakland, just across San
Francisco Bay, completed the sweep
with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 victory over Jiro
Yamagishi, Japan's greatest tennis
player.
Yamagishi Stars
In the preceding match Frankie
Parker of New Jersey defeated Fu
miteru Nakano of Japan, 6-0, 6-3,
6-2. •
Yamagishi, considered the best
player the Orient has developed
since Sato, gave a remarkable exhi
bition of gameness and determination
but he couldn't match the American's
power. Playing with a thumb taped
to cover a blister, the Japanese star
twice won the opening game of a
set against Budge only to drop be
hind when Don, who was having
trouble all day with his backhand,
turned on the heat.
Budge. Mako in Doubles Win
Budge and his team-mate, Gene
Mako paired off Saturday to defeat
the Japanese doubles team of Cap
tain Yamagashi and Nakano in
straight sets, 6-0. 6-1, 6-4. The Uni
ted States also swept the two open
ing singles matches Friday.
Meanwhile, in Mexico City ihe
Australian team was winning its
right to meet the United States in
the American Zone final to be played
at Forest Hills, Long Island, May
29, 30, and 31. The Australians swept
their five-match series without a
loss.

j with an . especially stinging back

a clean sweep of its Davis Cup tennis

Yamagishi, Japan's greatest tennis
player.
Yamagishi Stars
In the preceding match Frankie
Parker of New Jersey defeated Fu
miteru Nakano of Japan, 6-0, 6-3,

Yamagishi, considered the best
player the Orient has developed
since Sato, gave a remarkable exhi
bition of gameness and determination
but he couldn't match the American's
power. Playing with a thumb taped
to cover a blister, the Japanese star
twice won the opening game of a
set against Budge only to drop be
hind when Don, who was having
trouble all day with his backhand,
turned on the heat.
Budge. Mako in Doubles Win
Budge and his team-mate, Gene
Mako paired off Saturday to defeat
