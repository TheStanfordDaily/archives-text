Jaysee records flew by the boards
as a regular thing last Friday after
noon as Coach Dink Templeton's
varsity trackmen defeated Tex
Byrd's San Mateo J.C. team 9-5 in
a practice meet on Angell Field. First
places only were counted as points,
English style.
Cecil Cole, stellar distance man
from San Mateo, opened the day by
running the mile in 4:18.2, in an
event that turned out to be a boat
race, with Stanford's 4:18 man, Bob
Alexander, home for the week-end.
Cole's time lowers the former Amer
ican J.C. mark of 4:23.4 held by
Warren Dixon.
Weiershauser Stars
Bill Wohle, also of San Mateo, put
the shot 50 feet 3 inches for a new
mark in his event, a record which
he already holds. Stanford's best
man was Jack Weiershauser, who
won the hundred in 9.8 by inches
over Ellison, Kneubuhl, and Carew,
and then returned to take the low
hurdles in 23.6.
Ellison won the 220 in 21-.5, with
Hiserman but a stride behind in
21.6. his best time yet.
