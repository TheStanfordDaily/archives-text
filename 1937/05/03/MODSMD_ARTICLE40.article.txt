# Edit Staff Whips Admen, 13-7
## 
### 
'Twas a veritable calamity
when the Daily business staff
decided to challenge the Daily
edit staff to a tussle on the soft
ball diamond, because the
money-makers received a tho
rough slapping, 13-7, in spite of
the fact that the typewriter
pounders played with but six
men, while the cash register
ringers had a full team.
Mound duties for the edit
men were well taken care of
by the fast pitching arms of
Harry Press and Lloyd Lap
ham, while the opposing chuck
ers were Jerry Brown and Hal
Fulkerson.
Latest news to come from the
biz office is that the admen
are going to demand a two-out
of three series. 'Tis indeed a
pity. â–
