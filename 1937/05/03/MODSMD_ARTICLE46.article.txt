# Struck Where It Hurts
## 
### 
EVERY night for 20 years a rich old dowager
we know has eaten dinner in her hotel and
not once has the waiter ever spilled soup in
her lap.
Imagine her sky-splitting indignation when
the waiter deliberately dropped the whole tu
reen on her Saturday at 5 p.m.
She doesn't care that something wrong with
his working conditions made him spill the soup.
All she knows is that her dress is ruined, and
that she didn't get any soup where soup should
go.
Childish, isn't she?
But the public is childish. In 1934 they weren't
vitally interested in the rights and wrongs of
the longshoremen's demand as long as they
could get coffee at the corner grocery.
But one day there was a general strike. Mr.
Average Man couldn't get coffee at the corner
grocery.
And that's what stopped the strike. Mr. Aver
age man said, "What the hell, boys, I want my
coffee. Stop this nonsense."
All he cared was that the strike had disrupted
a petty detail of his life. And that was unfor
givable.
It was labor's mistake in thinking he was
thinking, and that a breakfast without coffee
would speed up the mental processes.
But like a powerful animal, labor apparently
doesn't learn by its mistakes. The hotel strike,
in many respects, will get the same reaction as
the general strike of 1934.
Like going without coffee, everybody knows
how it is to have soup in one's lap. They also
know what it means to walk up 20 flights of
stairs. And they can conceive of what it's like
to have the bartender get half through a Mar
tini, and just leave it in the shaker.
And on the other hand people don't directly
care whether the hotel workers have a kick
coming or not. The dowager didn't.
But then, she's childish.
