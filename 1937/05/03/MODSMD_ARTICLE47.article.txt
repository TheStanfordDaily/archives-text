# Precious After All

WHEN Director Lange announced some
weeks ago that he had chosen a Chinese
fairy tale called "Lady Precious Stream" for the
spring play, we doubted the wisdom of his
choice. We had read the New York reviews
and noted the play's extraordinarily short run
on Broadway. "Lady Precious Stream," we de
cided, was a "dish of exceedingly weak tea."
But the proof of the tea, it would seem, is in
the sipping. Last week-end we sipped Mr.
Lange's tea and found it anything but weak.
Brewed by a gourmet, it was differently deli
cious enough for even a beer-drinker. And
making tea taste good to a man of the steins is
a feat in itself worth congratulations.—D. B.
