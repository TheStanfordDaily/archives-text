TiEEB HALABY'S capably handled Convales-
J cent Home Drive is open to compliment for
many attributes, also open to criticism for one
glaring fault—there was too much of it.
After the first week had struck a clarion note
despite the absence of the gold-producing King-
Queen contest, the drive was permitted to drag
on until the note reached a somewhat sour tone.
After the ballyhoo and rush of the drive week
proper, Halaby's party might have been wound
up by the Masque Ball and with complete re
turns announced the following Monday, laid
away to rest for a year.
But no, there was still more to come, though
the campus felt adequately drained and was
ready to call the whole thing off for another
year.
Last Friday's benefit movie netted $9.30,
largely because 200 grammar school children
came to the rescue to make up for a "flat" cam
pus. Halaby was afraid the affair would end
up in red figures, but the kiddies put it in black
by a few dollars.
And still the Convalescent Home Drive goes
on—still a worthy cause, still well handled, but
for an overdosed campus with clenched purse
strings.—G. F.
