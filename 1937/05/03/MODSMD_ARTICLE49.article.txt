# Housing About It
## 
### 
Stanford has long proved pretty disappoint
ing to men and women coming from the
East to do graduate work. Instead of mov
ing info comfortable, congenial residences
with their fellow students, they are forced to
look around in the hills or in Paly for a place
to live.
Dean Yost recognized this problem Wednes
day when she advocated building a new cam
pus dormitory for graduate students, both men
and women and married couples. Her plan
was ideal except for one thing—such a build
ing would cost from $300,000 to $500,000 of

which the University has not a dollar.
While there is always a chance that some
philanthropist will cough up, until that time
some active action must be taken to accom
modate inexpensively the large number of
graduates.
Right now, housing for graduates is scarce
and expensive. The fact that a comfortable
room on the campus costs twice as much as
one in Lagunita or Toyon, is inconveniently
located blocks from the Quad, tends to keep
potential students from entering Stanford grad
uate schools.
Housing is less a problem for men than for
women. Not so particular about their surround
ings, men will accept rooms a woman would
consider unliveeable. Women shy from doing
graduate work at Stanford because Lagunita
and the Union units are too small to hold them,
because they must "live alone and like it."
Until finances permit building Miss Yost's
"dream dorm," partial solution is the Univer
sity's providing a house like Elm or Mariposa
for graduate women. The building would be
self-supporting —yet each Woman's room rent
would be far lower than she must pay in private
homes today.
With the Cubberley education building at
tracting teachers for advanced study, with
every department enlarging its graduate divi
sion, Stanford cannot afford to neglect the
graduate housing problem. This temporary
women's dormitory is the first step toward solu
tion. D. B.
