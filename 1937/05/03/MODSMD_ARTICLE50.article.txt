# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
TF the suntans, the such-a-beachness, the luvberg,
and the Kappa-D.U. exchange Sunday quick lunch
and swimming pool do not convince you, then I have
left only one more argument that spring is here:
Wong's kitch just opened up yesterday with fresh
strawbelly.
r PHIS Kappa - D.U. exchange Sunday quick lunch
and swimming pool is quite a thing. Ihe pro
cedure is simple. They sit around in the suntan. A
Pub Address system plays "Sweet lei-looney" and
tropical flowers. Hashers come out and serve the din
ner around the swimming pool and the swimmers.
Pretty soon there is dancing.
What, no mint juleps?
mNCE the Chi O hlshers' strike spread to the City
hotels, the campus quecncrs and queen bees had
to figure up some sort of entertainment other than a
two-buck cover charge.
In honor of their going-away and coming-out party,
the Betas held a housewarming in the old town tonight
which they quite candidly named a "barn dance."
The Beta nitery went into action shortly after the
news burped down from the city that the Junior Aux
iliary's Barn Dance and swimming pool was called off
and out. The Betas called the administratrix, Ex
Commix and got permission to wring out the old house
and wring in the new with a party as long as they got
chaperones, which they did summarily in spring quar
ter. Pretty soon there was dancing. What, no mint
juleps?
DESPITE the tales in the city peepers that the hotel
pickets routed a crowd of counter-revolutionary
Stanford students who were boo-hooting at them, all
Stanfordites did not pursue this means of entertain
ment.
A Tri-Delt and Phi Sig, who got up to the Palace
and found it indisposed, secured a couple of AFL
picket cards and joined the picket lines for a couple of
hours.
Pretty soon there was dancing and mint juleps.
