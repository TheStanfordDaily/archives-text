ADVICE ALWAYS COMES TOO LATE
r PIIE May 1 issue of the Saturday Evening Post con
tained two articles, one called "I Graduated Last
June," the other "Move Over Please," that everyone
now in college .should read.
The freshmen should read the articles, but they
probably won't. By now the seniors have probably
read them and arc scared to death.

If they're as scared as I am, they're about to shake
themselves out of their shoes.
Which is what they should have done four years
ago - . ,
The great trouble with the seniors is that they arc
about to start out on an adventure they don't under
stand.
They have been taught to read and write and sing
and dance and perform mental gymnastics, but they
have been taught nothing of what to expect on the
other side of the fence.
Behind the ivy-covered walls of higher education,
the seniors haven't been learning anything. They have
been, rather, kept from learning anything. In fact,
the less they have experienced of life and the less
questions they asked, the better off they have been as
far as the administration and their families arc con
cerned.

parents tell you you should study hard, but
they forget to tell you why. Maybe they don't
know themselves.
We aren't learning, we're parroting. We aren't
learning because we never ask "Why" about one single
thing. We simply say, "Yes' or "No" and let it go
at that.
And that seems to be the trouble with our concep
tion of learning.
We are taught to stifle our curiosity.
When we were little fellows, our mothers told us
not to be so curious and that if we peeked inside the
Christmas packages we were considered guilty of a
major crime.
All through our lives, we have been told it is
cither impolite or bad taste or just plain silly to
ask questions.
Now we have forgotten how to ask questions, right
at a time in life when we want so many questions
answered, we dont know on which one to start first.

IN class you arc told you arc holding up the progress
of the class when you ask about some minor point.
"Read it in the'book" is a favorite answer.
The little boy who asked where the stork came
from had the right idea, but he got slapped for his
pains. He'll graduate someday but he still won't have
learned to ask a question.
He probably never will. â€”Tro Harper
