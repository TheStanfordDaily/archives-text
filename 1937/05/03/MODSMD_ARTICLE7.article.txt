# Chaplain Explains Religious Beliefs
## 
### 
"Verification of Religious Beliefs" i
was Dr. Trueblood's topic in his
Sunday sermon in (he Memorial
chapel.
"Christianity is not based on a :
doctrine, but on a man," (he chap
lain said. As examples of how nec
essary verification is, he used Cook's
and Perry's discoveries of the North
Pole. Cook's was not verified, while
Perry's was. He went into the meth- |
ods used to prove these claims, and j
then showed how religious beliefs
are verified.
