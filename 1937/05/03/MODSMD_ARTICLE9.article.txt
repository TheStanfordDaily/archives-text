# Hard Shoes to Fill, But Jackson Does It In Comptroller's Job
## Predict Business Dean's Policies Will Conform With Roth's Program 
### GORDY FROST 
Acting Comptroller . Hugh Jack
son is doing what he says is im
possible, and not only is he doing it,
| but he's doing it well.
| Dean Jackson is on the spot, for
! he is the man who must fill the shoes
of personality powerhouse Almon E.
Roth. In fact, Jackson himsays says,
i "No one can fill the shoes of A1
Roth."
Still he's doing it.
Faced Hard Task
Stepping into an office filled with
I extremely pro-Roth employees, men
I and women who had learned to love
I the amiable ex-Comptroller, Dean
Jackson was faced with a forebod
| ing task, that of making loyal Roth
forces just as loyal Jackson backers.
His battle cry is "No one can fill
I the shoes of A1 Roth." His attack is
from the same human, "win-them
i over-in - spite - of - themselves" ap
proach of Roth. His victory seems
' certain.
Makes Comparison
[ I wanted to talk to Dean Jackson
; in his Comptroller's office, to see him
J as I had Roth a few weeks ago. The
| comparison would be interesting.
J After several unsuccessful at-
J tempts, which served to inform me
I that only one-third of his time is
i spent as acting Comptroller, and the
' rest as Dean of the Business School,
| and that Assistant Comptroller Er
nest Erwin doesn't like to play the
waiting-line game straight, I met
j my man.
Similar to Roth
The comparison was interesting,
because of predominant similarity.
The Jackson manner is the same
j easy good fellowship of Roth, tinged
with an apologetic note designed to
create the "no one can fill the Roth
shoes" impression.
Young — forty-six is considered
; mighty young for a Business School
Dean and Comptroller—Jackson pre
' sents the same tolerant, youthful ap
proaeh of his predecessor. Though
self-professedly not a publicity
hound, he shot out the facts that a
newspaperman might want to know
—as did Roth.
Past Experience
Intensely interested in business
administration both from the aca
demic angle and the actual practice
viewpoint, Dean Jackson came to
Stanford in 1926 after several years'
service in Price, Waterhouse & Com
pany and on the Harvard faculty.
At Stanford he continued the

Price, Waterhouse job while in
structing in accounting and business
methods. In 1!)30 he turned full at
tention 1o his professorship.
See's Roth's Return
Now, as Dean of the Business
School and acting Comptroller, he
spends nearly 12 hours a day be
tween the two jobs, has difficulty in
covering the two offices, but finds
that much of the Comptroller's'du
ties can be handled by subordinates
who are accustomed to taking over
for Roth who took frequent leaves
to promote public relations.
Though completely satisfied with
his new position, Dean Jackson
hopes to see Roth back within the
next two years. In the meantime, it
appears that he will continue to do
what he says is impossible—ade
quately fill Roth's vacated shoes.
