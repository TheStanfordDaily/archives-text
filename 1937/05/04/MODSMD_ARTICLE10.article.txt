# Hall Women To Exchange Dinner
## 
### 
Last of three Roble-Lagunita ex
change dinners will be held tonight.
These dinners are sponsored by the
sophomores in Lagunita to enable
freshmen to become familiar with
the Court before they move in next
fall.
A third of the Roble women will
go to Lagunita, while Lagunita sen
iors will return to their freshman
days by going to Roble to make room
for the guests. Barbara Goodrich
is chairman of the dinner.
