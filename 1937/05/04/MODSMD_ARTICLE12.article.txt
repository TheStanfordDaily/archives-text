# Fame Accompanies Alumnus to Campus
## Novelist Archie Binns Returns Successful 
### 
A Stanford man who couldn't af
ford a diploma in 1926, but who sold
a possible Pulitzer prize-winning
novel in 1937, returned to the cam
pus yesterday.
He is the tweed-suited, quizzical
eyed Archie Binns, who comes from
New York with fame tucked under
his armâ€”and with his diploma.
P.O. Graduate
Author of "The Laurels Are Cut
Down," Literary Guild selection this
month, and last year's winner of
the coveted Prix Femina award for
his novel, "Lightship," Mr. Binns
"graduated in Post-Office Station
'C', New York City." He received
his sheepskin from the postman,
paid for out of meager earnings as
a ghost-writer and a knock-about
editorial worker.
His career closely parallels that of
John Steinbeck, another Stanford
prodigal who today hears the trum
pets of fame played by those v/ho
once wouldn't whistle for him.
Both Men Successful
Both men graduated in successive
years. Steinbeck's "Of Dubious
Battle" won the Prix Femina two
years before Binns' first novel. To
day Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men"
is the Book-of-the-Month Club se
lection, companion to Binns' Liter
ary Guild release.
Both Time and the Philadelphia
Public Ledger have nominated "The
Laurels Are Cut Down" for the Pul
itzer Prize. Like "Lightship," it is
a sensitive but vigorous story of the
Puget Sound country where Binns
was raised.
Marge Bailey Instructed
Campus Mehitabel to the prodigal
Archie is Dr. Margery Bailey, under
whose direction he trialed-and-er
rored to writing skill.
She remembers when Binns would
take his education on the economic
momentum of a year's work in
Northern lumber camps, finding time
to edit the Sequoia and Cardinal,
deceased literary magazines, and
Chappie, still living. He remembers
when he couldn't pass English "A."
"On his way through" to Puget
Sound and maybe another book, he
ruminated over his Chappies, look
ed around, said a reasonable amount
for a man who from now on will be
paid by the word.
Both he and his wife, the former
Molly Windish, '23, were English
Club members.
