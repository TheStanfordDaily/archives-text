# 'Sex Talk' Washes Out At Ha'va'd
## 
### 
Fifteen hundred Harvard boys as
sembled to hear "the facts of life"
the other dayâ€”but something was
amiss somewhere. *
Early one morning Harvard mail
boxes were full of 3500 circulars re
sembling official postcards from the
Hygiene Department. The "official
notice" declared that "statistics com
piled by the department find it de
sirable to have two lectures on sex.
The first, 'Scientific Aspects of Birth
Control,' will be given at the New
Lecture Hall this noon."
The speaker was announced as Dr.
Arnold N. Childes, "well known for
his work in this field." Failure to
attend conflicting classes would be
"excused," the announcement said.
At noon 1500 students swarmed
about the locked doors of the Lec
ture Hall. By 12:15 it was raining
and the crowd disbanded. There
was no lecture.
That night the Crimson, under
graduate newspaper, investigated the
hoax to point suspiciously at the
Lampoon, Harvard funnymag, whose
staff last year raised a red flag over
the United States Supreme Court
building in Washington.
