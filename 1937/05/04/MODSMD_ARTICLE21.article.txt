# Reader's Digest Success Story Told
## 
### 
How a profit-sharing social service I
bccame a magazine with almost 2,- |
000,000 circulation paying six-figure !
salaries was told yesterday to mem- |
bers of Sigma Delta Chi and Theta
Sigma Phi, men's and Women's pro
fessional journalistic fraternities, by
Barclay Acheson, associate editor of
Reader's Digest.
As one of the executives of this
literary pocket - prodigal, Acheson
sees Reader's Digest less as a phe
nomenally successful magazine than
as an indication of a new and un
suspected non-fiction market.
Digest Prosperous
"There's no reason why the world
of reality .shouldn't be as thrilling
as the dreamland of fiction," he told
Ihe group at a joint luncheon meet
ing in the Union Alcove.
Proof that others share his belief
is the prosperity of the Digest, which

| today annually pays two $100.0001
| salaries and employs from six to |
! seven hundred in its editorial and !
i business offices.
Of this number, only 33 cull the i
material and help condense it. Most i
of them are paid to read the 300 pub
lications searched monthly for spe
cial ideas and articles suitable for
abbreviation.
Articles Are Condensed
Finished articles read in about
three minutes often take three
months to condense, and are some
times worked over by as many as
four writers, Acheson revealed.
The Digest operates four editorial j
departments, for general condensa- |
tion. for research on special articles,
for book condensation, and for prep
aration of interesting short material,
| the most expensive division of all I
I because of necessarily low produc- '

| tivity.
Material from Other Magazines
Material for the magazine is
gleaned almost entirely from other
i publications, Mr. Acheson pointed
j out, though recently the Digest has
been preparing originals, of which
the famous "And Sudden Death"
was one.
Still regarded by its publishers as
a social service, the Digest is not
anticipating inclusion of advertising.
As when the magazine was founded,
profits are shared by editorial work
ers and aged employees are pen
-1 sioned, he said.
1 Mr. Acheson holds little encour-
I agement for the beginner. "We
don't like novices," he told the group.
"Try for the other magazines. When
your stuff appears there, we can
| decide whether or not it fits our
I needs."
