DEL MONTE. May 3 (UP).â€”Ster
ilization for men and women eugen
ically unfit to become parents was
advocated by Dr. Edward M. Pal
lette of Los Angeles today in an ad
dress opening the annual conference
of the California Medical Associa
tion. Dr. Pallette, president of the
association, spoke to 1200 physicians
and surgeons in attendance from
throughout the state.
Eugenically sound marriages, he
said, may be the solution of the
threatened collapse of modern civ
ilization.
"Freed by modern scientific ad
vances of the danger of depopula
tion by disease," Dr. Pallette told
the conference, "our civilization
faces a still greater danger from the
ever-increasing number of sub
normals in this country."
