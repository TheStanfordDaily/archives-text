### 
SEATTLE. May 3 (U.R).â€”Mayor
John F. Dore, Seattle's "labor
mayor," warned the International
Longshoremen's Association annual
Pacific Coast convention today that
"labor is drunk with power."
Urging unity within the labor
movement, the mayor pleaded for
union peace.
Turning to Harry Bridges, San
Francisco, Pacific Coast district pres
ident of the 1.L.A., Dore proclaimed
him <l the greatest labor leader this
country has ever seen."
Bridges, thanking the mayor for
his welcoming address, said he be
lieved the convention would go on
record against splitting the labor
movement. "I think I can safely say
that we will support the public and
not selfish individuals in the labor
movement," Bridges said.
Mayor Dore sidestepped thf: issue
of the American Federation of Labor
against the Committee for Industrial
Organization, a question expected to
rock the convention.
