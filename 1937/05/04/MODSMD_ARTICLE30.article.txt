# Wally Freed, Duke Races To Meet Her
## Mrs. Simpson's Divorce Steals Spotlight From Coronation, Bus Strike 
### 
LONDON, May 3 (U.R).—Mrs. Wal
lis Warfield Simpson and the Duke
of Windsor "stole the show" amid
the carnival setting of London's cor
onation plumage tonight as news
paper extras splashed bold headlines
of the American-born divorcee's 25-
second final divorce decree.
The duke', separated from "the
woman I love" for five months,
learned of today's final court action
and rushed by train across Austria,
Germany and France to rejoin her
at the Chateau de Cande near Monts,
France.
Wedding May 24
There, in the sixteenth-century
setting of the chateau'? library, with
a peasant mayor officiating, they
probably will be married during the
week of May 24.
Mrs. Simpson, guarded by French
secret police, awaited him in the
chateau's sylvan setting.
Coronation Forgotten
The billion-dollar plans for the
coronation nine days hence — the
coronation that was to have been
Edward's until he sacrificed his
throne for love—were swept from
the public's mind. The paralyzing
bus strike was ignored.
Many British aristocrats were in
dignant at the re-appearance of pho
tographs of the principals of "the
world's greatest romance" on the
front pages of their newspapers at a
time when London is thronged with
visitors and every effort is being
made to give King George VI full
benefit of the spotlight.
