# Basque Women Battle Italians
## Join Husbands in Raid On Rebel Stronghold 
### 
HENDAYE, Franco-Spanish Fron
tier, May 3 (LP). —Brawny, bare
footed Basque fisherwomen today
tossed Italian soldiers into the sea
by the dozens in a guerilla raid on
rebel positions in Bermeo, near Bil
bao on the Biscay coast.
The Basque women, long famous
as "the Amrsons of Northern Spain,"
joined their husbands in a surprise
attack on the coastal town, 12 miles
north of Bilbao. They fought sav
agely hand-to- hand in the cobble
stone streets.
The women, many of whom were j
without weapons, clawed at General
Eilio Mola's terrified rebels with
bare hands. They seized the Italian
volunteers, hoisted them over their
shoulders and dumped them into the
bay.
Others, screaming in their strange |
Eskuardi tongue, drove Italians from
houses where they had sought ref
uge from the Amazon horde. Many
rebels were thrown from upper win- 1
dows. Their broken bodies lay in !
the streets.
WASHINGTON, May 3 (U.R).—'The j
general council of the National '
League of Women Voters today stud
ied demands for increased activity
to protect consumers against the I
rising cost of living.
