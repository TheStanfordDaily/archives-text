# London Prepares for Coronation

### 

LOOKING DOWN FROM BIG BEN clock tower, this photo shows stands erected in Parliament Square
along the route of the coronation procession. St. Margaret's church is the square-towered building at left
while Westminster Abbey shows slightly at extreme left. The procession will pass twice through this square.
