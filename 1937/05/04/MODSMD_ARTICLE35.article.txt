# Canned Foods Improvements Investigated
## Experiments in Precook Process Conducted By James Taranik, Grad 
### 
I Experiments on improved meth
j ods for processing canned foods are
j being investigated by V. James Tara
| nik, graduate student in the School
of Mechanical Engineering.
I The problem, one of the most in
| teresting in Stanford scientific cir
j cles in some time, is under Ihe su
| pervision of Professor Volney C.
I Finch. It is concerned chiefly with
' the precooking process in food can
j ning which precedes the actual ster
j iiization of the food to eliminate
i bacteria.
I Various methods of obtaining
; high temperatures rapidly are being
j investigated by Taranik with the as
! sistance of several other engineering
! students. The elaborate apparatus in
i the laboratory includes a chamber
, capable of being heated by either
j gas or steam and a hexagonal rotat
j ing device which keeps six cans in
j constant motion. Thermocycles are
j used to measure the temperatures.
| It is hoped that as a result of
these experiments the question of
whether gas or steam is the most
practical for use in canning foods
will be answered with resulting in
| crease of economy and efficiency in
j the canning industry.
