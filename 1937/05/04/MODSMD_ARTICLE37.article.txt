# Reynolds Describes Mexican High Court
## 
### 
While the United Stales worries
over President Roosevelt's plan to
reorganize the Supreme Court, Mex
ico is calm enough under a method
of its own.
As described by Stanford's good
will delegates, Jim Hill and Jim
Reynolds, the Mexican Supreme
Court has power to declare laws un
constitutional in theory only. There
are seven justices, appointed for a
term of about six years.
Cases involving the unconstitu
tionality of a law are brought before
it, but unless the court declares the
law unconstitutional in five suc
cessive cases, the law still remains
in force. If it is declared not valid,

the law nevertheless remains on the
statute books, but it is unenforce
able.
As it works out, Jim Hill states, j
the court would never oppose Car- |
denas' important laws. Furthermore, j
there is no re-election. The motto j
of the revolution is "Effective suf- j
frage and no re-election," the Party j
of the National Revolution being the J
only party.
Minimum wages are set and strikes
are guaranteed by the government,
i When a strike is called, a red flag
is hung out and police enforce no
: production by the place of busi-
I ness. I

I Treating its land problems as ef
fectively, expropriation is used. A
| tenant farmer can petition for divi-
I sion of land. The government will
I expropriate the land and reparti
i tion it to the farmer. The late owner,
; however, is not indemnified.
