# Weddings Hit New High At Farm Chapel
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Things are looking up in the wed
ding worldâ€”if Stanford Chapel rec
ords mean anything, they are. Al
ready, 20 ceremonies are booked for
June, with more expected.
With such a start, 1937's marriage
able month probably will top last
year, the year before, and the year
before that.
June definitely holds first place
among the popular months for chapel
marriages. In 1934, 22 couples took
a chance in June, three in May, and
14 in July. June again had a mo
nopoly in 1935 with 25 wedings.
There were nine in May and four in
July. Last year, June had 16 wed
dings, May four, and July only two.
Cause of '36 Dcclinc
Probable cause for the 1936 de
cline is the ruling, which went into
effect last year, that each couple
must have some connection with the
University. Chapel authorities turn
thumbs down on divorcees. Another
new ruling made this year states
that the University chaplain must
perform all weddings in the Memo
rial Church.
Most chapel brides indulge in the
traditional veil, but on the whole
the weddings arc small, informal af
fairs. Military ceremonies are rare,
only two being remembered in re
cent years.
Mostly Californians
Most couples are from California,
but one bride-to-be drove all the
way from the East (with part of her
furniture stowed in the car) to be
married in the chapel. When asked
the reason, she said Stanford made
such a nice background, and besides
Herbert Hoover lived here.
Another bride came from South
America to meet her fiance, a Stan
ford man, at the altar.
Records date back to 1903. Since
then, 1,168 couples have been mar
ried in the chapel.
