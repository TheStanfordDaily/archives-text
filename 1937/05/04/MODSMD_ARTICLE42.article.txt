LAST FRIDAY the Daily ran a
picture of Stan Hiserman, Card
sprinter. That, as far as it goes, is
fine. It's nice to run pictures in the
paper. The trouble is, there was
supposed to be a credit-line under
that picture to give Bob Zeimer
credit for taking the shot.
Bob Zeimer is an amateur cam
eraman and once in a while he
gels a picture of an athlete. He got
ihis one of Hiserman, and out of
the generosity of his heart offered it
for use in the Daily. The least we
could have done was to give him
credit for his picture, but the sports
editor hutched and Bob Zeimer was
left without recognition. However,
we hope this atones for the error.
Incidentally, it must have meant
something to Stan to see his picture
iri the paper, because he got out
there against San Mateo J. C. Fri
day afternoon and ran the fastest
220 he has turned out this year— ■
21.fi. If he keeps improving he
might fool a lot of these dopesters by
the time the conference meet rolls
around.
THERE HAVE BEEN some very
quiet rumors running around about
Stanford sending a track team to the
1.C.4-A. late this month in spite of
the fact that it conflicts with the Pa
cific Coast Conference meet. Ever
since the West started sending te&ms
back East to enter the classic, an
eastern team has won the meet just
once, Yale in 1924, they tell me.
However, another fine old tradi- ,
tion is definitely gone, because |
Stanford is certain to stay home this j
time and compete in the conference j
meet. The primary purpose in going
to the 1.C.4-A. in the first place was 1
to show the East that they didn't
have any monopoly on track teams,
and now that that is rather clearly
pointed out to them, the smart thing
to do is to stay in our own back j
yard with our v own meet, and let !
them have their fun back there.
The Coast meet figures to be
about twice as good as the icy A's |
anyway, and then the Coasters will i
have their crack at the East this i
year just the same when they hold !
the P.C.C.-Big Ten meet later this
year.
II Stanford went East, it would
force U.S.C. and other Coast schools
to do the same, or else not compete
at rill, because the withdrawal of
any one school from the P.C.C. meet
would make it too tough a load for
the others to make good under. I
Washington, Oregon State and the j
other northern schools plan to be |
lepresented in the Los Angeles tan- j
gle, so it should be a great meet, but
the whole thing wou'd fall flat it any I
of the championship - contending i
schools withdrew.
FROM WHAT should be a re
liable source comes the info that
neither Ross Bush nor George
rioone will compete for the Trojans
come Sattidy. Boore, with a badly
sprained right knee, h;.s been ad- I
vised by his doctor that he would |
be fool'sh to try to run or jump on
it as soon as May 8. Bush is suf
fering from that pulled Achilles ten- j
don, and when he tried to run on
it last Friday it pained him and
welled up again so thit he had to
quit. It is certain that he won't be ;
in any kind of shap-.* for the meet 1
with the Ca'ds. and o : that dope he
< oesn t figure to place even if he
does run.
With those two men out. Stanford
can be figuivd to have a great chance
to nose out the Cromwell crew. 1
Nevertheless, in spite of the optim- j
ism of a lot of persons around here, :
the Cards still will go into that meet |
underdogs, and if they don't some- !
body certainly is trying to wreck the !
train with psychology. U.S.C. to the
start of the mile run should be con- i
sidered the best collegiate dual meet |
team in the country, and Stanford's
position should be as a contender
with the chance for an upset.

to show the East that they didn't
have any monopoly on track teams,
and now that that is rather clearly
pointed out to them, the smart thing
to do is to stay in our own back j
yard with our v own meet, and let !
them have their fun back there.
The Coast meet figures to be
about twice as good as the icy A's |
anyway, and then the Coasters will i
have their crack at the East this i
year just the same when they hold !
the P.C.C.-Big Ten meet later this
year.
II Stanford went East, it would
force U.S.C. and other Coast schools
to do the same, or else not compete
at rill, because the withdrawal of
any one school from the P.C.C. meet
would make it too tough a load for
the others to make good under. I
Washington, Oregon State and the j
other northern schools plan to be |
lepresented in the Los Angeles tan- j
gle, so it should be a great meet, but
the whole thing wou'd fall flat it any I
of the championship - contending i
schools withdrew.
FROM WHAT should be a re
liable source comes the info that
neither Ross Bush nor George
rioone will compete for the Trojans
come Sattidy. Boore, with a badly
sprained right knee, h;.s been ad- I
vised by his doctor that he would |
be fool'sh to try to run or jump on
it as soon as May 8. Bush is suf
fering from that pulled Achilles ten- j
don, and when he tried to run on
it last Friday it pained him and
welled up again so thit he had to
quit. It is certain that he won't be ;
in any kind of shap-.* for the meet 1
with the Ca'ds. and o : that dope he
< oesn t figure to place even if he
does run.
With those two men out. Stanford
can be figuivd to have a great chance
to nose out the Cromwell crew. 1
Nevertheless, in spite of the optim- j
ism of a lot of persons around here, :
the Cards still will go into that meet |
underdogs, and if they don't some- !
body certainly is trying to wreck the !
train with psychology. U.S.C. to the
start of the mile run should be con- i
sidered the best collegiate dual meet |
team in the country, and Stanford's

LAST FRIDAY the Daily ran a
picture of Stan Hiserman, Card
sprinter. That, as far as it goes, is
fine. It's nice to run pictures in the
paper. The trouble is, there was
supposed to be a credit-line under
that picture to give Bob Zeimer
credit for taking the shot.
Bob Zeimer is an amateur cam
eraman and once in a while he
gels a picture of an athlete. He got
ihis one of Hiserman, and out of
the generosity of his heart offered it
for use in the Daily. The least we
could have done was to give him
credit for his picture, but the sports
editor hutched and Bob Zeimer was
left without recognition. However,
we hope this atones for the error.
Incidentally, it must have meant
something to Stan to see his picture
iri the paper, because he got out
there against San Mateo J. C. Fri
day afternoon and ran the fastest
220 he has turned out this year— ■
21.fi. If he keeps improving he
might fool a lot of these dopesters by
the time the conference meet rolls
around.
THERE HAVE BEEN some very
quiet rumors running around about
Stanford sending a track team to the
1.C.4-A. late this month in spite of
the fact that it conflicts with the Pa
cific Coast Conference meet. Ever
since the West started sending te&ms
back East to enter the classic, an
eastern team has won the meet just
once, Yale in 1924, they tell me.
However, another fine old tradi- ,
tion is definitely gone, because |
Stanford is certain to stay home this j
time and compete in the conference j
meet. The primary purpose in going
to the 1.C.4-A. in the first place was 1

in any kind of shap-.* for the meet 1
with the Ca'ds. and o : that dope he

does run.
With those two men out. Stanford
can be figuivd to have a great chance
to nose out the Cromwell crew. 1
Nevertheless, in spite of the optim- j
ism of a lot of persons around here, :
the Cards still will go into that meet |
underdogs, and if they don't some- !
body certainly is trying to wreck the !
train with psychology. U.S.C. to the
start of the mile run should be con- i
sidered the best collegiate dual meet |
team in the country, and Stanford's
position should be as a contender
with the chance for an upset.
