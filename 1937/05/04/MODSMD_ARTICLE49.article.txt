# Trackmen Set For Try on Trojan Jinx
## 
### 
Absolutely it'll be no half-way try that Dink Templeton and 'lis track
men will make this Saturday to dispel the Troian "Indian Sign" that Dean
Cromwell's Trojans have held over Stanford for the last four dual track
i meets.
On paper the score is somewhat Trojan, but no one doubts that Stanford
could win, and by a margin, if various and sundry things saw tit to come
I about. But regardless of wh.it Tem~^

i pleton way inside believes about his 1
j chances, lie is shooting all. Doubling
1 his men up? Naw, look:
I Jack Weiershauser in all serious- j
i ness may run four events, in order !
, the 1(K). 440, low hurdles, and relay.
Ray Malott will run three: the 440,
I 220, and relay, McCurdy three: the
| 440, 880, and relay, and perhaps even
| Johnny Hewitt may come in for the
I yeoman work of both hurdle races
j and a relay lap.
No conference rules ban this com
plex entry list, and with all the boys
set for a practice week that'll make
all previous weeks look like picnics
on the meadows of Heaven, they
may be in shape and in favor for
the big push. When a coach doubles
land triples and quadruples his men
■ he is not building character; he is
| trying to win points. •,
Loo Madlem is still a questionable
j quantity, taking it easy this week,
j and his muscle cramp won't be cor
j rectly appraised till he comes out to
1 jump later in the week.
) Ed Burrows climbed on the Tem-
I pleton machine yesterday after a
: prolonged absence by running 6 laps
j in 7:06.5, best practice time at the
; distance this year. Bob Alexander,
tired by his trip home to the bed
side of a sick brother, was 20 yards i
| behind.
Ray Malott beat the fj(io boys — 1
McCurdy, Weiershauser, Mahurin,
and Burrows, in 1:20.1, another 1537 i
Angell Field mark. Hewitt's 15.2
and Hiserman's 22.2 were the other :

sparks of yesterday's session.
Gordy Hyde, who returned to the
i fold and was boxed out of winning
the 440 trials, may be ready to go ;
Saturday.
Al Wesson, Trojan publicity mon
ger, pulled into town yesterday with
the words he didn't see how George
Boone or Ross Bush would be in
shape to run Saturday, both being
' out with punk legs, but the Los An
geles grapevine reports that Bush
looked O.K. in practice last week.

No conference rules ban this com

all previous weeks look like picnics
on the meadows of Heaven, they

Loo Madlem is still a questionable

I pleton machine yesterday after a
: prolonged absence by running 6 laps
j in 7:06.5, best practice time at the
; distance this year. Bob Alexander,
tired by his trip home to the bed
side of a sick brother, was 20 yards i

Ray Malott beat the fj(io boys — 1
McCurdy, Weiershauser, Mahurin,
and Burrows, in 1:20.1, another 1537 i
Angell Field mark. Hewitt's 15.2

sparks of yesterday's session.

i fold and was boxed out of winning
the 440 trials, may be ready to go ;
Saturday.
Al Wesson, Trojan publicity mon

the words he didn't see how George
Boone or Ross Bush would be in
shape to run Saturday, both being

looked O.K. in practice last week.

Absolutely it'll be no half-way try that Dink Templeton and 'lis track
men will make this Saturday to dispel the Troian "Indian Sign" that Dean
Cromwell's Trojans have held over Stanford for the last four dual track

could win, and by a margin, if various and sundry things saw tit to come
