# "Resolved: Two Continents"
## 
### 
WHEN Jim Reynolds and Jim Hill returned
from Central America a few days ago,
sun-burned and bug-bitten, someone asked
them how many debates they'd won.
"None," they answered. They hadn't de
bated anybody. -
"But we thought you went down there as
debaters."
"We did."
Stanford's two debaters were not actually de
baters on their Central American junket. They
forgot academic premises and pedantic rebut
tals. They went to Mexico and her sister coun
tries not for mental exercise but to actively
spread good-will and understanding among the
American peoples.
Their talks with students and teachers were
not restricted to the pros and cons of "Resolved,
etc., etc." In congenial, informal sessions they
discussed pan - American troubles, arranged
means of bringing together the students of the
United States and Central America.
Out of their conferences—impossible in for
mal debate—grew plans for exchanging stu
dents between Stanford and important Mexican
universities, grew dreams of an inter-American
youth congress to strengthen international
friendship. Athletic contests, long neglected
between the Americas, were scheduled as an
other result of their meetings.
Even more than representing America,
though, these men represented Stanford. To
the hundreds of potential American students
south of the Rio Grande, Stanford is now the
university.
Its ambassadors have been at work—ambas
sadors who know that diplomacy works better
over tea cups than over a gavel and two water
pitchers.—D. B.
