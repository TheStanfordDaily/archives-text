THERE is an ancient Stanford dirge entitled
"Something Must Be Done About the Soro
rities."
Once a year the old song is dusted off, pol
ished, and sung for the benefit of weeping frosh
women who threaten to wash Roble down to the
Quad.
But by this time the tears are dried, rushing
is gone, pledging is over, and Roble is still on
its foundations.
The fires are cooled down. Most everyone
has forgotten the ancient Stanford dirge, and
those who haven't have decided that they didn't
want to go to a house anyway.
Now is the time for Dean Yost, the sororities,
the halls, and everyone else concerned to turn
a dry spring quarter eye to next fall and winter
quarter's dirge.
During the last five years Stanford has more
than doubled its enrollment of women, with no
corresponding increase in sororities. Before
the influx, conditions were admittedly bad. Now
they are worse.
In the days of the "500" half a dozen houses
were able to pick up the nuggets, the rest had
difficulty in pinning their little jewels on the
best material. There just weren't enough nug
gets to go around. Now there aren't enough
houses to go around.
Five years ago too many frosh women wept
because they didn't make a house. Today there
are twice as many frosh, twice as many tears,
and still no definite effort to sweeten the dirge.
It isn't really because the frosh are unhappy
in the hall that this sorority upset exists. It's
because the folks in the home town want the
daughter to "make a house," not realizing that
at Stanford it isn't a case of "making a house,"
but rather "going a house," and that many ar
bitrarily decide against it.

Further, they don't realize that but a handful
have the opportunity to choose. Making this
clear to the admirers at home is what upsets
Roble.
Today, Dean Yost can dip this dilemma
without fear of unleashing the sorority lash or
the Roble tear duct. Today, Dean Yost can so
licit cool and co-operative opinions from both.
It would appear that three solutions are avail
able:
1. Do away with sororities.
2. Increase the number of sororities.
3. Work out some joint set-up by which
women live two years' time in the hall, two
years in the house, as is done at Cornell.
Picking a solution is too vast a problem here.
But one point is undeniably true. The hysteria
of rushing it past. Now is an auspicious time
to act, for if not now, inevitably later.—G. F.

Quad.
But by this time the tears are dried, rushing
is gone, pledging is over, and Roble is still on
its foundations.
The fires are cooled down. Most everyone
has forgotten the ancient Stanford dirge, and
those who haven't have decided that they didn't
want to go to a house anyway.
Now is the time for Dean Yost, the sororities,
the halls, and everyone else concerned to turn
a dry spring quarter eye to next fall and winter
quarter's dirge.
During the last five years Stanford has more
than doubled its enrollment of women, with no
corresponding increase in sororities. Before
the influx, conditions were admittedly bad. Now
they are worse.
In the days of the "500" half a dozen houses
were able to pick up the nuggets, the rest had
difficulty in pinning their little jewels on the
best material. There just weren't enough nug
gets to go around. Now there aren't enough
houses to go around.
Five years ago too many frosh women wept
because they didn't make a house. Today there
are twice as many frosh, twice as many tears,
and still no definite effort to sweeten the dirge.
It isn't really because the frosh are unhappy
in the hall that this sorority upset exists. It's
because the folks in the home town want the
daughter to "make a house," not realizing that
at Stanford it isn't a case of "making a house,"
but rather "going a house," and that many ar
bitrarily decide against it.

Further, they don't realize that but a handful
have the opportunity to choose. Making this
clear to the admirers at home is what upsets
Roble.
Today, Dean Yost can dip this dilemma
without fear of unleashing the sorority lash or
the Roble tear duct. Today, Dean Yost can so
licit cool and co-operative opinions from both.
It would appear that three solutions are avail
able:
1. Do away with sororities.
2. Increase the number of sororities.
3. Work out some joint set-up by which
women live two years' time in the hall, two
years in the house, as is done at Cornell.
Picking a solution is too vast a problem here.
But one point is undeniably true. The hysteria
of rushing it past. Now is an auspicious time
to act, for if not now, inevitably later.—G. F.
THERE is an ancient Stanford dirge entitled
"Something Must Be Done About the Soro
rities."
Once a year the old song is dusted off, pol
ished, and sung for the benefit of weeping frosh
women who threaten to wash Roble down to the
Quad.
