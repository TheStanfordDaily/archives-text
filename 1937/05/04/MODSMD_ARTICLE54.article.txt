# OUR HASHER

'T'HERE is some anxiety about who is writing Our
Hasher, Jr., these days. Well, the answer, my
friends, varies. Sometimes it is a former all-star, 14-
carrot H>-man who carries on his osmotic processes in
the Encina Commons and delivers several precipita
tions in the Daily office daily except Saturday and Sun
day. Sometimes, in other instances, such as yesterday,
when the Associated Students of the Stanford Daily,
publishers of The Stanford Daily, forget to change the
heading, I am the one who writes it. And how are all
your troubles?
Since everybody is now happy over the great suc
cess of Lady Precious Squirt it is quite permissable to
quote from the introduction to the play given by Pro
fessor Lee Chapin. It seems that in his little act, the
former Lingnan-po pofessor started out his talk in
Chinese until a stooge from the wings reminded him
he was not talking turkey.
During the Chinese section, however, he mentioned
the name of The Stanford Daily in the native Stanford
idiom . Exactly what he said about the Stanford Daily
will never be known to science. However, Jeremy
Wong, the kitch despot, who was smoothing into the
rough seats, translated it to read as follows: "The Stan
ford Daily may think you lugs will not appreciate any
stuff except beefsteak and onions, but I can tell you
this play is a swiss on rye on the 50-cent lunch of a
'leven sun, and hashboy bum boy."
r PHE night of dress rehearsal, one of Lady Precious'
Ladies was supposed to be agitated over the fact
that the Lord High Executioner was executioning her
Lord High Lover, so she was supposed to say: "Wait,
Mr. Executioner, the prime minister is on his way."
However, the facts of the matter are simply this
and this simple: "Wait, Mr. ExecutionerMr.Langel've
onlygotatwelveo'clock."
What with all these interruptions, Our Hasher, Sr.,
has been unable to tell a story that unstoried during
the Big Meet.
The Stanford track manager had been getting in
creasingly agitated and exasperated over the fact that
the judges at the finish of the dashes had been mis
calling his shots.
Finally, on the finish of the 220, the judges pulled
an extremely foul one. The track manager quite dis
tinctly heard with his own ears the second-place judge
call Carewe second, and heard the third-place judge
call Carewe third. So they gave Carewe third.
This upset the Stanford manager considerably, so
he advanced upon the judges and called them univer
sally and man-for-man "a bunch of zunsabguns."
One young-looking judge didn't appreciate the flat
tery, and advanced upon the boy coach. The boy coach
understood his resentment quite thoroughly and called
the track manager to him. And he said, "No, please
don't, for my sake, call Robert Gordon Sproul a
zunsabguns, he's one of the best guys they got over
there."
