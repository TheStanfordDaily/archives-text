i iNE of the four star modern miracles is the fact that
Stanford freshmen are not driven to permanent al
coholism. It is almost inconceivable that anyone forced
to eat the culls of Encina Commons should not lubri
cate his indigestion with scotch and soda.
We know the frosh do not drink. That would be
"Conduct Unbecoming a Stanford Gentleman." But
to those who have gone through the Year of Great
Famine, it appears only divine intervention keeps the
rough from giving Bacchus a first mortgage on his
soul.
Authorities may think the corrosive influence or
Encina food will strengthen the frosh and put hair on
his chest. But We Who Have Suffered realize that the
Encina poison nullifies nature's own anti-drinking or
dinance.
The one thing which keeps the majority of young
men headed toward the way, the truth, and the lighl
is the fear of hangover and internal inferno that fol
lows indulgence in spirits. But a man who can digest
the Encina food can floor a stein of sulphuric acid
and chase it with sani-flush.
Moreover, when cremated eggs gang up on pre
historic beef, the rough can hardly be blamed for feel
ing that the digestive juices need supplementing. If
Encina hash doesn't tear a hole in his stomach, why
should whiskey?
Yesterday, I was permitted to see one of the sur
vivors of last Friday's lunch, popularly called the
Massacre of the Day before May Day. After a few
lucid moments he ignored me and addressed his re
marks directly to God. These I cannot transcribe, as the
Daily does not print on asbestos.
ALMOST too sordid to record, his tale concerns a
nameless fish, joined iji unholy wedlock to a
shrimp paste that knew not its father. Together with
some pariah potatoes, these outcasts started boring
from within and soon led an active revolution.
Although the poor man will recover, it is obvious
that neither hell nor hangover will have any fury for
him. In fact, in his one rational moment he expressed
the intention of getting so blank-dashed pie-eyed that
he couldn't eat again until he graduated.
Doubtless, the miracle which gives all Stanford stu
dents reserve seats on the water wagon will prevent
him from falling under the power of the God of Fer
mentation. Nonetheless, his soul is imperiled. Encina
has broken down his resistance, and has shown him the
depths of human degradation.
The University should not sprain its collective
wrist patting its back because its proteges do not drink.
Rather it should humbly thank Providence that It
intervenes to veto the effects of Encina food.

ALMOST too sordid to record, his tale concerns a
nameless fish, joined iji unholy wedlock to a
shrimp paste that knew not its father. Together with
some pariah potatoes, these outcasts started boring
from within and soon led an active revolution.
Although the poor man will recover, it is obvious
that neither hell nor hangover will have any fury for
him. In fact, in his one rational moment he expressed
the intention of getting so blank-dashed pie-eyed that
he couldn't eat again until he graduated.
Doubtless, the miracle which gives all Stanford stu
dents reserve seats on the water wagon will prevent
him from falling under the power of the God of Fer
mentation. Nonetheless, his soul is imperiled. Encina
has broken down his resistance, and has shown him the
depths of human degradation.
The University should not sprain its collective
wrist patting its back because its proteges do not drink.
Rather it should humbly thank Providence that It
intervenes to veto the effects of Encina food.

i iNE of the four star modern miracles is the fact that
Stanford freshmen are not driven to permanent al
coholism. It is almost inconceivable that anyone forced
to eat the culls of Encina Commons should not lubri
cate his indigestion with scotch and soda.
We know the frosh do not drink. That would be
"Conduct Unbecoming a Stanford Gentleman." But
to those who have gone through the Year of Great
Famine, it appears only divine intervention keeps the
rough from giving Bacchus a first mortgage on his
soul.
Authorities may think the corrosive influence or
Encina food will strengthen the frosh and put hair on
his chest. But We Who Have Suffered realize that the
Encina poison nullifies nature's own anti-drinking or
dinance.
The one thing which keeps the majority of young
men headed toward the way, the truth, and the lighl
is the fear of hangover and internal inferno that fol
lows indulgence in spirits. But a man who can digest
the Encina food can floor a stein of sulphuric acid
and chase it with sani-flush.
Moreover, when cremated eggs gang up on pre
historic beef, the rough can hardly be blamed for feel
ing that the digestive juices need supplementing. If
Encina hash doesn't tear a hole in his stomach, why
should whiskey?
Yesterday, I was permitted to see one of the sur
vivors of last Friday's lunch, popularly called the
Massacre of the Day before May Day. After a few
lucid moments he ignored me and addressed his re
marks directly to God. These I cannot transcribe, as the
Daily does not print on asbestos.
