# Is All the World Nerts? Two Fijis Seek Answer
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
"Is the rest of the world nerts, or
are we all nerts?"
To find an answer to that ques
tion, two lower division Stanford
Fijis, Robert B. Jones and Sam
Mattison, left school this quarter and
started out on a two-year vaga
bonding trip around the world,
which will have a serious side in
studying racial and social attitudes
in each country visited.
Late in April Jones and Mattison
landed in Hawaii, and on the front
page of the Honolulu Advertiser. A
three-column photograph in the Ad
vertiser of April 2 illustrates a long
feature story headlined: "Boys Seek
Answer to Age-old Question: Is the
World Nerts?" According to the
story, Jones and Mattison are going
to "dissect racial ingredients in
each country visited," in order to
find out "why do we think other na
tionalities are nerts and vice versa?"

Jones, writer of the "You May
Not Know" column in the Daily
last quarter, says that when he gets
back to this country he is going to
write a book on the results of his
investigations. Mattison, he added,
will supply illustrations for the
book.
According to the Advertiser's ac
count, Jones said that they have let
ters of introduction to the Emperor
of Japan, Chinese General Chang
Fat Kwei and Liu-Chang, and Lord
Marbury. The story added that "in
Germany the boys hope to get close
to Hitler by interviewing Herr
Barrato, Nazi mogul."
From Honolulu, Jones and Matti
son sailed to Japan. From there they
are going on to China, the Straits
Settlements, Java, India, and Eu
rope. They cxpect to be back in a
year or two. "It all depends," Jones
concluded, "on how nerts the world
isâ€”or we are."
