# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some days ago one of your staff
writers uttered a savage criticism of
the Tuesday evening lectures ar
ranged by the University Commit- i
tec on Public Exercises. If that criti
cism is unjust, your correspondent j
was using the responsibility of his |
position to injure the University in I
the eyes of the student body and the j
general public. I believe that the j
criticism was unjust. I was chair- |
man of the Committee for more than !
a year, and since then I have watch
ed its activities with a good deal of
interest. I know how difficult it is J
to provide suitable lectures on the
slender budget on which the Com
mittee has to operate, and I think, j
on the whole, the Committee has !
done extremely well.
At the very time the critical article
was being written the Committee
was offering a lecture on "The Por
traits of Dante" by Professor Ru- |
dolph Altrocchi of the University of j
California. It was one of the wittiest |
and most delightful lectures I have 1

PURPOSES PIED

ever heard and was besides, and this
is an important point, a perfect ex
ample of the interesting but little
known art of iconography, or the
j study of portraiture. I am sure that,
if your staff writer had been pres
| ent, he would have enjoyed the lec-
I ture and would have profited by it
!in his general culture. It is not al
| v/ays possible for the Committee to
j provide so well known and so bril
! liant a lecturer as Professor Al
: trocchi, but the lecturers chosen are
always men whose standing upholds
J the dignity of the University and
I whose ability fulfills the purpose of
! the Committee.
That purpose is not amusement. It
|is instruction. Stanford University
j does not seek to compete with the
j movies. It could not if it would,
and it would not if it could. It seeks
in these Tuesday evening lectures to
afford to its earnest students, of
I whom there are overwhelming num-

I bers, an opportunity to hear lectures
ion public affairs, foreign and do
i mestic, on certain aspects of the arts
| and sciences, and on other matters
I culturally valuable but not provided
| for in its daily programs. Your staff
i writer ought to help the University
!in this laudable undertaking, for
Stanford University has serious bus
iness on its hands. We might apply
to that business the saying of
1 Themistocles: "I cannot fiddle, but I
can make a small town into a large
; city."

The Editor, Sir:
Some days ago one of your staff
writers uttered a savage criticism of
the Tuesday evening lectures ar
ranged by the University Commit- i
tec on Public Exercises. If that criti
cism is unjust, your correspondent j
was using the responsibility of his |
position to injure the University in I
the eyes of the student body and the j
general public. I believe that the j
criticism was unjust. I was chair- |
man of the Committee for more than !
a year, and since then I have watch
ed its activities with a good deal of
interest. I know how difficult it is J
to provide suitable lectures on the
slender budget on which the Com
mittee has to operate, and I think, j
on the whole, the Committee has !
done extremely well.
At the very time the critical article
was being written the Committee
was offering a lecture on "The Por
traits of Dante" by Professor Ru- |
dolph Altrocchi of the University of j
California. It was one of the wittiest |
and most delightful lectures I have 1
