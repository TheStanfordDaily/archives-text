# Theatre Style Combines Utility With Architecture Of Campus

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
A temple of dramatic art is near
j ing completion at Stanford. In it:
! present form it presents a fairlj
I clear picture of the finished struc
j ture.
Gone is the scaffolding from the
j simplified Romanesque exterior, re
j vealing round arches, heavy walls
' and small windows in a consciou;
! effort to recapture the spirit of ths
; Quad. To those sunk deep in Fanr
i tradition, it is recommended tha
they divert their gaze from the neu
theater until the bulky structure i:
j softened with well-designed plant
| ing.
Sandstone Impractical
It Ls practically impossible to make
| a building housing a modern audi
j torium resemble the low rambling
| structures of the Quad. The pro
j hibitive price of the traditional sand
stone as well as the demands foi
I utility places the architect at a dis
[ tinct disadvantage.
True it is that an elaborate struc-
J ture with a low rambling (acade wa;
| a plan originally submitted. But
I with only a half million dollars t<
I spend, that design would have pre-
I vented the use of first-class equip-
I ment. The final decision to sacrifice

exterior beauty to interior practi- I
cability was the obvious one.
Compromises Architecture
Some may regret that in trying to
effect a compromise between the
Romanesque style of the Quad and
the demands of modern materials
and a reduced budget the architect
produced a nominally nondescript,
design. From a practical standpoint,
however, the theater is just what it
should be. Skilled landscape de
sign and ivy growing on the walls
are bound to improve the appear
ance of the building.
The completed lobby presents a 1
good idea of what the appearance of
the auditorium will be. From cool !
gray terrazzo floors, rough plastered
buff walls rise to vaulted ceilings.
Simplicity is the keynote through
out. Baseboards are of black marble;
ornamental moldings are in a mod
ernized conventional design. Ev
erywhere are arches. /
Fixtures Simple
Lighting fixtures are square panes
of frosted glasses in dull chrome
frames arranged in groups of four,
flush with the ceiling. A rounded '
recess faces the main entrance; it?
future contents rest with the gods.
At either end of the foyer stairs go

up to the balcony and down to the
rest rooms.
These are decorated with beauti
ful tile work, the men's a dignified
grey, the ladies' a chaste purple. The
balcony follows conventional plans;
it is divided into front and rear sec
tions.
The little theater is practically
complete. It has the same plaster
finish as the rest of the building and
the same severe fixture design. Ul
tramodern classrooms, lecture halls,
dressing rooms, and offices are
nearly finished.
Show Modern Tendencies
Although severe, the design avoids
sharp lines throughout and favors
soft curves. It appears that the
theater will show modern tendencies
and will be thoroughly dedicated to
the practical aspects of the drama.
The orchestra pit is exceptionally
large. Fixtures in the auditorium
are small square panes of glass, flush
with the plain tan plaster celling,
arranged in a geometric design that
can be changed by turning lights on
and off and changing their colors.
All the wooden doors in the building
are of stained white oak.
Thus a snoop through, a preview
of Memorial Hall.

erywhere are arches. /
Fixtures Simple
Lighting fixtures are square panes
of frosted glasses in dull chrome
frames arranged in groups of four,
flush with the ceiling. A rounded '
recess faces the main entrance; it?
future contents rest with the gods.
At either end of the foyer stairs go

up to the balcony and down to the
rest rooms.
These are decorated with beauti
ful tile work, the men's a dignified
grey, the ladies' a chaste purple. The
balcony follows conventional plans;
it is divided into front and rear sec
tions.
The little theater is practically
complete. It has the same plaster
finish as the rest of the building and
the same severe fixture design. Ul
tramodern classrooms, lecture halls,
dressing rooms, and offices are
nearly finished.
Show Modern Tendencies
Although severe, the design avoids
sharp lines throughout and favors
soft curves. It appears that the
theater will show modern tendencies
and will be thoroughly dedicated to
the practical aspects of the drama.
The orchestra pit is exceptionally
large. Fixtures in the auditorium
are small square panes of glass, flush
with the plain tan plaster celling,
arranged in a geometric design that
can be changed by turning lights on
and off and changing their colors.
All the wooden doors in the building
are of stained white oak.

the demands of modern materials
and a reduced budget the architect
