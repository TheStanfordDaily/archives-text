# Do-nuts To Aid Women's Fund
## 
### 
"Mr. Deeds fed do-nuts to a
horseâ€”why don't you?"
That's what 30 sales-girls will
be asking you this morning
from 9 to 12 o'clock at the
Women's Conference do-nut
sale on the Quad.
Sold at a nickel apiece, the
luscious, crumbly, sugar
glazed doughnuts will fill out
the Women's Conference schol
arship fund instituted last
quarter with proceeds from
the County Fair.
Booths will be set up at the
Engineering and English cor
ners, but students who fail to
purchase do-nuts at either of
these places may get them from
the Roble sales-girls who will
walk about the Quad carrying
trays.
