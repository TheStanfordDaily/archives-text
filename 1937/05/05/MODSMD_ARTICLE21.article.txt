# Dr. Sharp Speaks On European Trips
## 
### 
When you're traveling through
Europe, take it easyâ€”travel like you
eat chocolate cake. Don't take too
much at a time. That is the advice
offered by Dr. Stanley L. Sharp,
Stanford German instructor, based
on his many journeys through Eu
rope. "Americans," he said in the
Tuesday lecture last night in the
Little Theater, "try to cover too
much ground in too little time. They
aren't intellectually prepared to
travel."
An important consideration in
making an itinerary is to plan all
bicycle trips so that they can be
made down hill. Ton many people
want to go up Ihe Danube or up to
Switzerland. "It's much easier to
coast down the Danube than to
peddle up it," said Dr. Sharp.
