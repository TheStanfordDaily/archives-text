HOLLYWOOD, May 4 (UP). â€”
Widely circulated reports that
"strike breakers" were being hired
by motion picture studios were veri
fied today when Pat Casey, studio
labor representative, said approxi
mately 150 persons been engaged
"to replace" strikers.
Previously the film producers had
refused to confirm persistent reports
that striking studio workers were
being replaced by non-union men.
"Studios have hired 150 persons to
replace those who left their jobs,"
Casey declared at his press confer
ence today. "These are exclusive of
painters who are not being replaced
at present."
Casey denied, however, that the
International Alliance of Theatrical
Stage Employes was engaged in
strike-breaking activities.
