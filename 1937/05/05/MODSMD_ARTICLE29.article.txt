# Rough To Write Ph.D. Thesis in Snow Storm
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Writing a thesis for a Ph.D. degree in the midst of an Arctic blizzard
is only one of Ed Levin's plans for the next year and a half, which he
will spend as a member of Father Hubbard's Alaskan expedition.
Levin, who received his master's degree in geology from Stanford and
now is working for the higher degree, will leave tomorrow for Seattle to

join the Hubbard expedition for the'
eighth and, he said in an interview
yesterday, the last time. "But the
Arctic gets in your blood," he added.
"You always want to go back."
Levin's experiences on previous
expeditions read like an action
packed adventure yarn. Last year,
he fell into a 50-foot crevass and,
after being rescued by other mem
bers of the party, was rushed by
launch to a Juneau hospital. Three
weeks later, he was back on the job,
wearing special bandages to protect
several broken ribs.
While on one of the Hubbard ex
ploration trips several years ago.
Levin tells of killing a Pavloff
bear, weighing a ton and measur
ing 10 feet from nose to tail, at
60 feet with a .38 super revolver.
"Some people think those fellows
are slow," he said, "but I once saw
two bears catch a mountain goat.
They only resort to berries and roots
when they can't get fish and meat to
eat."
Levin is field manager for the
present expedition, supervising all
equipment. He has designed spe
cial stoves to burn seal oil, and
houses with shatterproof glass
windows to withstand heavy
snows and specially insulated
floors and walls to keep out the
extreme cold, which he expects to
reach 80 below. Members of the
party will wear leather face masks
with frost-proof goggles.

Levin is taking his own dog,
I three-fourths w.olf and one-fourth
| malemute, to be lead dog on the
expedition. In the party will be
| Ken Chisholm, former U.S.F. foot
j ball star, and Nick Cavaliere, cam-
I eraman for Frank Buck's "Bring
I 'Em Back Alive."
| Father Hubbard expects to study
| Eskimo migrations from Asia to
I North America, and will attempt for
i the first time to put Eskimo gram
! mar into writing. In speaking of the
I "Glacier Priest," Levin said. "He's
1 the finest man in the world. He
j never asks you to do anything he
; wouldn't do himself."
