BILL MoCURDY was stomping
around yesterday morning and put
ting his right foot down easy-like,
because he has a slight stone bruise
that hurts just a little. It doesn't
mean anything as far as his running
Saturday goes, though, because by
that time he will be in fine fettle.
HE PROBABLY will have to be
in fine fettle, too, because he's very
liable to run three races, and you
can't do that unless you're feeling
right. Tempieton supposedly will
put Captain Bill in the 440; and Mc-
Curdy will do his regular chores
in the half and the relay, in an at
tempt to put over a sweep in that
event.
THE TROJANS haven't a quarter
mi ler in a carload, and Stanford can
put Malott, McCurdy, and Weier
shauser ir\ for a cinch sweep.
There's a thought on that 440. though,
that might be worth mentioning—if
Gordy Hyde is back in shape by
then, and Dink can trust him to
break 42 seconds, it would be much
better for McCurdy to stay out of
the race and concentrate on the 880.
The best U.S.C. 440 man hasn't
broken 49.8 this season, while
Gordy was down to the' low :48's
when he suffered that muscle cramp
a week before the Big Meet.
DOULAC, FIRST Trojan in the
half, might figure to break int»o sec
ond place if McCurdy runs too hard
in the 440. Mahurin seems set for a
second if McCurdy is fresh, and a
first if Mac is tired, because Roulac
isn't quite in his class.
THERE'S ANOTHER thought on
that 440, too—even if McCurdy does
run it, it might not mean anything
to him. The three Cards will stay
back and let Trojan Olson set the
pace, a trick which will be some
thing uncommon for Mr. Olson and
something which he doesn't do very
well.
IF OLSON doesn't want to set
the pace, though, and tries to stay
back too, the whole bunch might
just quit running in efforts to stay
behind each other for the first 300
yards. The time on that race might
be laughable, you never can tell,
because none of the Indians will be
running for a record and Olson
couldn't if he wanted to.
WHILE STANFORD figures for a
sweep in the 440, Dean Cromwell's
boys will whitewash everything
Dink has to offer in the pole vault.
Meadows and Sefton will probably
be trying for a new world's record,
while a gent by the name of Howe
will bring up the third point by go
ing something in excess of 13 feet
G inches. Gill and Boore of Stanford
will score the biggest upsets of the
meet if they can tie Howe for third
place.
THE WEIGHTS hold a couple of
terrors for Tempieton, too, with
Hanson doing 50 feet in the shot and
Caspar doing perilously close to 150
in the-discus for the Trojans. This
column is of the private opinion that
Reynolds is going to win the shot,
but that's open to question. Gribbin
won the plate toss at Cal over Zagar,
but Pete's a pretty good competitor
and he's liable to win.
BOTH WILL have to look out for
Caspar, and then there's another
mystery in the stove-wood by the
name of Wrotnowski who hasn't
been doing so poorly by Cromwell.
Stanford has a fine chance for a
first and second, or a first and third,
but U.S.C. has a glorious opportu
nity to sneak over a first, too. The
event is touchy, no doubt.
THE SPRINTS? Why, we're a
cinch for at least two thirds, and
with a little good luck they might
be seconds. It's not out of the realm
of possibility—Weiershauser getting
second in the 100 and Malott snag
ging the place in the 220—now, is
it?

behind each other for the first 300
yards. The time on that race might
be laughable, you never can tell,
because none of the Indians will be
running for a record and Olson
couldn't if he wanted to.
WHILE STANFORD figures for a
sweep in the 440, Dean Cromwell's
boys will whitewash everything
Dink has to offer in the pole vault.
Meadows and Sefton will probably
be trying for a new world's record,
while a gent by the name of Howe
will bring up the third point by go
ing something in excess of 13 feet
G inches. Gill and Boore of Stanford
will score the biggest upsets of the
meet if they can tie Howe for third
place.
THE WEIGHTS hold a couple of
terrors for Tempieton, too, with
Hanson doing 50 feet in the shot and
Caspar doing perilously close to 150
in the-discus for the Trojans. This
column is of the private opinion that
Reynolds is going to win the shot,
but that's open to question. Gribbin
won the plate toss at Cal over Zagar,
but Pete's a pretty good competitor
and he's liable to win.
BOTH WILL have to look out for
Caspar, and then there's another
mystery in the stove-wood by the
name of Wrotnowski who hasn't
been doing so poorly by Cromwell.
Stanford has a fine chance for a
first and second, or a first and third,
but U.S.C. has a glorious opportu
nity to sneak over a first, too. The
event is touchy, no doubt.
THE SPRINTS? Why, we're a
cinch for at least two thirds, and
with a little good luck they might
be seconds. It's not out of the realm
of possibility—Weiershauser getting
second in the 100 and Malott snag
ging the place in the 220—now, is
it?

BILL MoCURDY was stomping
around yesterday morning and put
ting his right foot down easy-like,
because he has a slight stone bruise
that hurts just a little. It doesn't
mean anything as far as his running
Saturday goes, though, because by
that time he will be in fine fettle.
HE PROBABLY will have to be
in fine fettle, too, because he's very
liable to run three races, and you
can't do that unless you're feeling
right. Tempieton supposedly will
put Captain Bill in the 440; and Mc-
Curdy will do his regular chores
in the half and the relay, in an at
tempt to put over a sweep in that
event.
THE TROJANS haven't a quarter
mi ler in a carload, and Stanford can
put Malott, McCurdy, and Weier
shauser ir\ for a cinch sweep.
There's a thought on that 440. though,
that might be worth mentioning—if
Gordy Hyde is back in shape by
then, and Dink can trust him to
break 42 seconds, it would be much
better for McCurdy to stay out of
the race and concentrate on the 880.
The best U.S.C. 440 man hasn't
broken 49.8 this season, while
Gordy was down to the' low :48's
when he suffered that muscle cramp
a week before the Big Meet.
DOULAC, FIRST Trojan in the
half, might figure to break int»o sec
ond place if McCurdy runs too hard
in the 440. Mahurin seems set for a
second if McCurdy is fresh, and a
first if Mac is tired, because Roulac
isn't quite in his class.
THERE'S ANOTHER thought on
that 440, too—even if McCurdy does
run it, it might not mean anything
to him. The three Cards will stay
back and let Trojan Olson set the
pace, a trick which will be some
thing uncommon for Mr. Olson and
something which he doesn't do very
well.
IF OLSON doesn't want to set
the pace, though, and tries to stay
back too, the whole bunch might
just quit running in efforts to stay
behind each other for the first 300
yards. The time on that race might
be laughable, you never can tell,
