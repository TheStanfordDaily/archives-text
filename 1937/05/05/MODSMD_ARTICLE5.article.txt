# Year's Profits Of Bookstore Given to Fund
## Ex Committee Approves Scheme To Contribute Refund to Student Aid 
### 
Bookstore profits will not be re
turned as rebates this year but v/ill
go instead to the Student Aid Fund,
Ex Committee decided last night.
In a letter to President Reynolds,
Professor Everett Leslie, Bookstore
president, declared that the average
refund would amount to only 58
cents, that the Student Aid Fund
was greatly in need of the extra
money.
$6000 Expected
With a $(>OOO profit expected this
year, slightly less than last, Pro
fessor Leslie asked Ex Committee
to grant $5000 of it to the Student
Aid Fund, the remaining $1000 to
the Bookstore reserve.
Student Manager Fontius thought
Mr. Leslie's plan the soundest one;
the Committee unanimously agreed.
Other student-body business in
cluded:
PALY THEATERS will continue
doing business at the same old stand,
at the same old prices, Bob Mallett
reported after an interview with
Harry Siepels, Fox West Coast man
ager in San Francisco.
"We can't buck these economic
factors," said Mallett, pointing to
Siepels' arguments against lower
ing Paly theater prices. The bronze
thatched Ex Committeeman had
started to "negotiate" lower bal
cony prices after the "riot" last fall
in which freshmen clashed with
police.
Began Early
The tradition of roughs' booing
Paly shows began when a stock
company played "Uncle Tom's Cab
in," Mallett said Siepels had told him.
Little Eva was dying and a rough
yelled "Page Mr. Wilbur." The
manager attempted to evict the dis
turber and the long-standing tra
dition began. After that, stock com
panies avoided Palo Alto as a "dan
gerous" place to play.
Siepels volunteei'ed use of the
Stanford Theater for morning rallies
or shows—said he would turn over
the show to the freshmen on Paja
marino night if they "promised not
to wreck anything."
"SPEAKERS' BUREAU does more
to promote Stanford than any other
activity except perhaps athletics,"
Reynolds declared. He read Man
ager Chuck Schafer's report to Ex
Committee* of the Bureau's accom
plishments, noted that Schafer will
want more money for next year's ex
penses.
PUBLIC EXERCISES Committee
will get student suggestions for "pep
ping up" its lectures. Given this
responsibility were Beth Allen, Ann
Martineau, and Bill Mitchell.
JUNIOR TRANSFERS will be
"oriented" by a new committee—
Bud Milligan, chairman; Barbara
Murphy, and Jack Calderwood.
TENNIS AWARDS will go to—
freshmen: Neal Anderson, John
Bates, Dave Brock, Myron Folsom,
Lloyd Gates, Bill Jordan, Kenneth
Koch, Bob Richardson, and George
Taoka.
Varsity: Bob Braley, George Ches
sum, Ben Dey, Bob Pommer, Bill
Seward, Bob Underwood, John
Lynch, and Dexter Mapcl.

The tradition of roughs' booing
Paly shows began when a stock
company played "Uncle Tom's Cab
in," Mallett said Siepels had told him.
Little Eva was dying and a rough
yelled "Page Mr. Wilbur." The
manager attempted to evict the dis
turber and the long-standing tra
dition began. After that, stock com
panies avoided Palo Alto as a "dan
gerous" place to play.
Siepels volunteei'ed use of the
Stanford Theater for morning rallies
or shows—said he would turn over
the show to the freshmen on Paja
marino night if they "promised not
to wreck anything."
"SPEAKERS' BUREAU does more
to promote Stanford than any other
activity except perhaps athletics,"
Reynolds declared. He read Man
ager Chuck Schafer's report to Ex
Committee* of the Bureau's accom
plishments, noted that Schafer will
want more money for next year's ex
penses.
PUBLIC EXERCISES Committee

Murphy, and Jack Calderwood.

Bookstore profits will not be re
turned as rebates this year but v/ill
go instead to the Student Aid Fund,
Ex Committee decided last night.
In a letter to President Reynolds,
Professor Everett Leslie, Bookstore
president, declared that the average
refund would amount to only 58
cents, that the Student Aid Fund
was greatly in need of the extra
money.
$6000 Expected
With a $(>OOO profit expected this
year, slightly less than last, Pro
fessor Leslie asked Ex Committee
to grant $5000 of it to the Student
Aid Fund, the remaining $1000 to
the Bookstore reserve.
Student Manager Fontius thought
Mr. Leslie's plan the soundest one;
the Committee unanimously agreed.

PALY THEATERS will continue
doing business at the same old stand,
at the same old prices, Bob Mallett
reported after an interview with
Harry Siepels, Fox West Coast man
ager in San Francisco.
"We can't buck these economic
factors," said Mallett, pointing to
Siepels' arguments against lower
ing Paly theater prices. The bronze
thatched Ex Committeeman had
started to "negotiate" lower bal
cony prices after the "riot" last fall
in which freshmen clashed with
police.
