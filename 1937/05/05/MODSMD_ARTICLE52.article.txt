# Baseball Hopes High for 1938
## Wolter Optimistic, Despite Loss of Five Stars 
### 
With Catcher Leo Heagerty en j
route to the Boston Red Sox chain, J
and only Captain "Red" Holman, |
Verne Johnson, Ray Weiershauser, !
and Howie Paine lost through grad
uation, Coach Harry Wolter will still
have a host of material for his 1938
varsity baseball outfit.
Dick Tarn at second, Caplain-elect i
George Farrell at shortstop, and |
Leonard "Baldy" Linde at third are j
the returning first-string infielders. ;
Wally deWitt and Jimmy Coffis, j
who may be used as catcher next i
season, as well as Dick LaFranehi, i
Glenn Hamilton, Dick Hanna, Tom !
Killefer, and Bob Matthews will all j
be back.
Of the pitching staff, there will
return Spike Furman, Neil Rasmus
sen, and Joey Griffin as the nucleus
for Wolter to work with. Bob Bur
nett and Dale Reimer, utility in
fielders, both have another season,
with the former a possible replace
ment for Holman at first base.
The frosh coming up present a '
few encouraging possibilities, in
cluding particularly Norm Juney, j
pitcher and outfielder; Bill Willard,
outfielder; and Dick Shortall, short- j
stop.
