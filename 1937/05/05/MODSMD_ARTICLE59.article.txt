TO ASK for a course in typing at Stanford is
probably treason. "It isn't culture, it isn't
background, it isn't even nice."
When the women asked for such a course in
their Women's Edition last week, they weren't
trying to be nice. They were being practical.
They wanted to be able to butter their own
bread when they left Stanford.
Typing may not be as esthetic as "Art and
Architecture," but when the professor asks for
a paper on Greek columns, he won't accept any
long-hand scribble. It must be typed—and the
majority of Stanford students don't know how.
That they should have learned to type in high
school is no excuse for not teaching them here.
If you didn't learn the rules of grammar in high
school, you'll pay Stanford $10 a quarter lor
English A until you do.
Palo Alto public stenographers have long
lived off the fat of Stanford illiterates—illiter
ates because in a modern university anyone
who can't type isn't equipped to be educated.
Many's the hard-earned hasher's dollar that has
gone for 8 pages of typewriting.
One two-unit course would teach the average
student enough typing. Syllabus lees would
withstand the laboratory cost of typewriters,
the course costing the University very little. At
Cal if 15 students want a course, the University
teaches it. At Stanford a dozen times 15 want
to learn to type —but the Administration shies
from what it feels is tinged with commercial
ism, or what it might not be able to afford.
Stanford students want to learn to typewrite,
commercial-schoolish or not —both to help them
in their school work now, and to increase their
chances of employment after they've hit the
World.—D. B.
