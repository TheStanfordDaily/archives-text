# For the Fun of It

### 
ROUND Angell Field's green midfield yester
day afternoon a little man in crimson trunks
with a rusty mop of hair clicked off the laps
toward a practice two-mile race—two, four, six,
seven, the sprint, a grimace, the finish.
Admirers clicked their stop watches, watched
the red trunks circle an extra lap, then mur
mured with sort of guiet reverence something
about nine minutes fourteen seconds. The puf
fing little man asked his time. They told him,
and he nodded and ran off toward the gym.
Then they began to talk about the man in the
red trunks. Norm Bright had just unceremoni
onsly run a practice two-mile in 9:14.8, sixteen
seconds over the world's record, not his best
two-mile, but a great one for a non-competitive
race.
But what they might have thought about was
not Norm's race, but about something deeper;
about the heart in the man in the red trunks.
Norm Bright transferred to Stanford two years
ago to graduate in education. During spare
time he ran, ran enough to make himself one of
the dozen best two-milers in the world. He ran
only for fun; he couldn't compete for Stanford
because he was a transfer.
Then Norm Bright graduated and became a
school teacher at Sunnyvale. But still he ran,
just for fun, wearing the crimson trunks of the
Olympic Club.
Yesterday, just as he does two other days
cach week, Norm Bright broke away from his
Sunnyvale classroom, boarded the train, hiked
past the stadium up to the gym, and went out
to run. Just for fun.
Not because there was fame, not because
there would be rooters, not to train for a meet
Saturday. But just because of something deeper
than fine leg muscles, the clean wind, the per
fect stride: the spirit of sport for the sport of it.
They praised his attitude, and soon they left
Angell Field and drove their cars up the road
past the stadium that goes to the train station.
Jogging the other way, dark business suit
bobbing, a bundle of gym trunks bouncing at
his side, was the little man and his flawless
stride.
Still running. Just for the fun of it.—G. F.

school teacher at Sunnyvale. But still he ran,
just for fun, wearing the crimson trunks of the
Olympic Club.
Yesterday, just as he does two other days
cach week, Norm Bright broke away from his
Sunnyvale classroom, boarded the train, hiked
past the stadium up to the gym, and went out
to run. Just for fun.
Not because there was fame, not because
there would be rooters, not to train for a meet
Saturday. But just because of something deeper
than fine leg muscles, the clean wind, the per
fect stride: the spirit of sport for the sport of it.
They praised his attitude, and soon they left
Angell Field and drove their cars up the road
past the stadium that goes to the train station.
Jogging the other way, dark business suit
bobbing, a bundle of gym trunks bouncing at
his side, was the little man and his flawless
stride.
Still running. Just for the fun of it.—G. F.
