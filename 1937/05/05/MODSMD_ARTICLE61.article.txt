# The
						Jazz Era Ends

### 
(Excerpts from the Oregon Emerald)
MUSIC has always been a criterion of the
tone, the culture, even the economic
trends of the period it represents. It is, of
course, much too early to draw any definite
conclusions about conditions here from the in
flux of wide-known band leaders but there are
consequences of great importance which might
result from this condition. Some of these are
alarming; others indicate a possible turn for
the better,
Last year Paul Pendarvis started the parade
of big name bands. Duke Ellington was first
this year. Then Jimmy Dorsey penetrated the
wilderness and Ellis Kimball followed the path
he had blazed. Soon Ben Pollack will pack his
drums and sot forth from sunny southern Cali

fornia on an expedition into the wilds of the
northwest.
An economic determinist would probably
reach the simple conclusion that these bands
were coming here merely because organiza
tions which hold dances are making them more
lucrative offers. Carrying this vein of reasoning
to its logical extreme, the only possible conclu
sion is the obviously invalid one that times are
better at the University. This immediately es
tablishes anyone who follows such reasoning
as an optimist, a sophist, or a campus racketeer.
Discarding this impractical hypothesis, we
are faced with the selection of another. The
opposite possibility is that bands are offering
their services for less money. There might be
several reasons for such a reduction in prices.
Again rejecting those solutions which are ob
viously without a shred of reasonable backing,
we may strike out such causes as: price reduc
tions because bands are now playing scheduled
tours, et cetera. This leaves only one possible
valid solution: jazz and jazz bands are slipping.

At any rate, to a person with the sharp, in
quiring mind of the scientist, this sudden influx
of dance bands deluxe presents a challenging
problem. Is California, the land of the grape
and orange, becoming the land of the over-ripe
tomato and the cabbage as far as orchestras are
concerned?
To the philosophic it might seem that the
American public is facing life with a greater
seriousness of mind and that entertainers who
formerly satisfied its demands for frivolity are
being forced into the small-town circuits.
If the doom of jazz is imminent, the downfall
of Paul Whiteman will-probably cause the big
gest boom. His sudden de-elevation would
mark a fitting finish to the Jazz Age and would
wipe the musical slate clean for the New Era.
