# OUR HASHER, Jr.

### 
CHERE HASHERE, MON CHERE PERE:
Don't take it so hard about that head. Remembah,
I tried to burn your bushel twice myself.
r pHAT that Spring is here is evident is certain bc
cause many Stanford students woke up Monday
afternoon about 4:00 to find scattered about their col
lective doors a multiple-choice Mother's Day Greeting
Syllabus to be used May 9,1937, et al.
In Compliance with the Daily policy of courtesy if
you have to, Junior is instigating a bureau for students
which will recommend the proper Mother's Day greet
ing, called OUR HASHER JUNIOR'S MOTHER'S DAY
GREETING SYNDICATE FOR STANFORD UNDER
GRADUATES, SERVICE WORLD WIDE. Faculty and
Paly residents are invited to audit, dhr, Roble Lobby,
twice Sundays and holidays including all Mothersdays
and Exam Week. Selection of greetings will be made
on a basis of character as well as dominant and re
cessive genes and major department in the university.
HPHAT applicants may know what to expect, here is
a simplified sample of the choices that might be
in differently diversified cases:
For the Busigrad, with spectacles on nose and money
pouch on mind: "I need no reminder of Mother's Day
to realize all that I owe you in gratitude."
For the curlyblond tracksterstar: "Mother dash the
finest word I know colon dash my mother dash the
finest woman I know period" Time: 23 fiat.
For the self-centered type df person, a selection of
this nature might be chosen, particularly if he has
red hair: "Because you are the mother of my dearest
friend I want to send my kindest greeting on Mother's
Day."
Here's one of the same ilk that would prove pecu
liarly apt for many cases in the education dept.: "M is
for the million thoughts I always have of you dear
mother."
And again for the Military Christian Soldiers with
fascistic tendencies no doubt: "Today I salute the most
precious of all people, my mother." Heil! Mutter!
For the English majors whose mothers want to
know how well their chillin's is writin', I would sug
gest this little couplet:
"I'm just a little tot, I haven't much to say:
Just want to wish my mama a happy Mother's Day."
I don't think I'll send one. My step-mother beats
me.
