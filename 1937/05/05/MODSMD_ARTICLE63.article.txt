### 
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
¥>ECAUSE social customs and manners dictate that
you canst tell people to their faccs exactly what
you think of them, most of us never know how many
persons like or dislike us.
When we meet someone we say, "How do you do? '
when we don't give a damn how they do. Why should
we? We've never seen them before.
You say an awful lot of silly things every day that
haven't the slightest meaning in the world, but you
say them to be "nice" even when you don't feel nice.
And at the price of being nice, now no one knows
just where he stands in respect to his fellows.
Some rationalize their way out of the difficulty by
saying they don't care what people think of them. Some
admit they're back-slappers and expect no returns
from passing friendships. Most of us just stand around
and take it.
* * sit *
You'll never know how many ways you affect the
persons you meet every day. If we sat down and
thought of the various ways we appear to casual ac
quaintances, most of us would probably never venture
out of doors.
One gent feels bad. He thinks you look bad, too.
Another feels swell. You're his pal, for the minute.
And another has heard you blaspheme the things
he likes.
He thinks you're a heel.
Some people worry about what you seem to be
thinking, when really you're not thinking at all.
You worry them to death.
Let a group of artists paint your picture some time
and you'll find out just how many different ways in
which you impress.
♦ * * *
It might not be a bad idea for everyone to walk
up to the mirror once in a while and view the reflec
tion as a total stranger.
Just walk up and say, "How do."
You'll probably scare yourself out of several years'
growth.
