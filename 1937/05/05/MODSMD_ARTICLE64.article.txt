MONTS, France, May 4 (U.R).â€”The Duke of Windsor, no longer ruler
of the British Empire but obviously happier than any king wearing a
crown, stood on the terrace of the Chateau Cande this afternoon with Mrs.
Wallis Simpson, both waving to the French peasants who passed in farm
carts cheering the historic love match.
A few hours before, their reunion had occurred, safe from prying eyes,
in the shadowy interior of the castle's book-lined library, with all reporters

hundreds of yards beyond its win-'
dows, outside the main gate.
Meet Privately
No one saw the first meeting of
the famous lovers, made possible by
the final divorce decree granted to
Mrs. Simpson in London yesterday.
True to their aversion to publiciz
ing their romance, they arranged not
to meet on the terrace of the chateau
this morning.
The duke came here from his re
treat at St. Wolfgang, Austria, as
soon as Mrs. Simpson joyously in
formed him by telephone that her
final decree of divorce had been
granted, leaving her free to marry
him.
The duke brought gifts and (low
ers. In his pocket was the platinum
wedding ring which he bought in
Paris.
Alone at Last
The reunion took place in the
dim-lit library of the old chateau.
Behind its oak doors and stained
glass windows, the lovers were alone
for a brief few moments before they
rejoined their hosts, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Bedaux.
The first appearance together of
former King Edward VIII and Mrs.
Simpson, since the abdication, oc
curred after lunch, when they
emerged on the terrace and acknowl
edged the cheers of the peasants.
