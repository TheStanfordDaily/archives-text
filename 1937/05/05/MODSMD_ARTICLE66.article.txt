## SUCKER FOR SUCCOUR 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is too bad that Bull Sessioner
Cobbs wasted his vivid, picturesque
style yesterday in a puerile attack
on Encina's food.
In the first place, the food at En
cina is entirely satisfactory, if we
consider the large scale production
necessary to feed so many. Individ
ual likes and dislikes naturally can
not be catered to, and it is only oc
casionally that everyone dislikes a
meal.
Secondly, Encina would gripe
about any food it was served, no
matter how good it was. It is part
of the good old tradition of telling
the world in a loud voice that you
are a he-man, a real Stanford
Rough.
I am sorry to see the columnist
be such a sucker, after all his
former condemnation of blind al
legiance to tradition.
