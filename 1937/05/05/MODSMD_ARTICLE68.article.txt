SOMETHING TO SEE as well as
hear was Jose Iturbi Monday night,
conducting the Philadelphia Sym
phony Orchestra, and playing the
piano at the same time . . . He
played Liszt Concerto, leading with
his head and his hands (when they
were free) from the piano . . .
And more great music, over the air
this time, can be heard tonight at 5
o'clock over KPO when Eugene
Goossens with Kirsten Flagstad,
Katherine Meisle, Frederick Jagel,
and Ezio Pinsa as soloists, perform
the great Beethoven "Missa Solem
nis."
ALSO AT 5, KSFO, Lily Pons
and Andre Kostelanetz air their
wares. . . . Directly following, 5:30
o'clock, same station, the Beauty
Box Theater stars Jessica Dragon
nette and Charles Kuhlman . . .
It's another Broadway musical, as
usual.
TOWN HALL TONIGHT goes on
as usual at 8 on KPO . . . Inci
dentally, speaking of Allen, to set
tle a bet will someone kindly come
to the aid of the party . . . The
question is this: Is "The Bee," the
composition which caused so much
trouble between Allen and Benny
awhile back, Rimsky-Korsakoff's
"Flight of the Bumble-bee" or is it
something entirely different? . . .
We hate to bother any of the prin
cipals involved, but there's money
down on it.
CLEVELAND, May 4 (U.R).â€”Roy
Hughes, third baseman for the
Cleveland Indians, was hospitalized
today with severe abdominal pains.
Physicians feared appendicitis.
