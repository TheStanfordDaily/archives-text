# Warmer Days Would Bring Food to Quad
## 
### DOUGLAS JAQUES 
Breakfast served in the Inner
Quad? Well, almost, but the cool
climate delays ripening of the fruit
on the trees and so prevents sleepy
students from snatching a quick
breakfast "a-la-Tahiti."
Scattered among the eight little
tree-islands are three kinds of citrus
trees—lemon, orange, and grape
fruit. The only trees that bear fruit
are the avocados, whose offerings
are picked by thoughtful professors
and exploring students.
Get Latin Titles
Most of the trees in the Inner
Quad are high class and go by their
Latin names. There's one, for in
stance, called Serculia; in the ver
nacular it is a bottle tree. Some
keep their common names well
hidden, such as the Eugenia Myrti
folia on the corners and in front of
the Chapel. The only auspicious
thing about this tree is the name.
Among the palms are the Wash
ingtonia, Phoenix, and a few Yuc
cas. The banana palms have been
frozen out this year.
Loquats Known
The Quad islands contain, besides
coniferous trees, a few camphor
trees and some English laurel—and
loquats, perhaps the best known to
students, as these do offer a form of
nourishment.
Students not too busy finding so
eluded benches in these islands, or
finding classrooms in the near vicin
ity, might take a look at these trees
some day. ,
