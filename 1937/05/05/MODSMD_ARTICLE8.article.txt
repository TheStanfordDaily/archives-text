# Radio Group Clicks Giving First Drama
## 
### JAMES STONE 
Stanford's first radio presentation I
showed last night that there is defi
nitely something in the idea. Kay j
Arthur's play, "Uncrossed Bounda
ry," while not in itself "too sharp," |
made a good vehicle, besides having j
the added qualification of being stu
dent-written. Miss Arthur also di- j
rected the play and tied together the j
cast into a smooth performance.
Amelia Baines, Virginia Rogers, |
and Paul Crary handled their lead- |
ing roles in excellent fashion; all
three have fine radio voices and
across the air waves. Others in the
good dramatic quality which carries
cast were Ken Peters, Mary Craig, j
Wilma McFadden, Ralph Deterling, ,
Janet Dole, and Joe Lawry. Ed Ken
did the announcing and Gene Gear
handled sound effects.
The next presentation. May 25,
will be Herb Diamond's "In Shaft
Seven," Masquers' entry in the '
Northern California Drama Contest.
