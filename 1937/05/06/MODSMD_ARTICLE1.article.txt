# CIO Pledges Support To Movie Strike
## Guild of Actors Might Join with Producers Instead of Strikers 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, May 5 (U.R).â€”John
L. Lewis' Committee for Industrial
Organization threw its support be
hind the Hollywood movie strike
today and promised steel, automo
bile and rubber workers will join
striking film technicians in the
picket lines.
John Brophy, C.1.0. national di
rector, telegraphed from Washing
ton that "union workers, no matter
what their afliliation, should support
the studio strike."
Strikers Weakening
The C.1.0. support came as the
strikers' united front of 11 unions
showed signs of cracking, with one
union ousted and two others threat
ening separate peace negotiations.
The powerful Screen Actors' Guild,
upon which the strikers had hoped
for backing, conferred with pro
ducers and it was announced that
"progress" was made toward a basic
agreement. Franchot Tone and Rob
ert Montgomery signed their names
to the statement.
Hollywood police redoubled pre
cautions after a riot in a rival non
striking union's headquarters. Six
men were severely injured in a club
swinging melee. Fifty men were al
leged to have raided 100 members of
the International Alliance of The
atrical Stage Employees.
2000 at Meeting
Brophy's telegram was read at a
mass meeting of the striking federa
tion of motion picture crafts. Two
thousand strikers rose and cheered
five minutes. It placed the C.1.0. in
the position of supporting a unit of
its rival American Federation of
Labor, with which the federation is
affiliated.
C. H. Jordan, local C.1.0. organ
izer, announced C.1.0. union work
ers from the nearby automobile as
sembly plants, steel works, and rub
ber factories would replace "dog
tired" technicians on the picket
lines.
Stars Pass Pickets
Hollywood's glamour stars have
passed through the picket lines and
gone to work at the studios unmo
lested so far. Messages from two of
them, however, brought cheers from
the mass meeting.
A greeting purportedly from Lu
iso Rainer, Viennese star of "The
Good Earth" who recently won the
Academy acting award, said she
"will certainly abide by the strike
decree" if one is adopted by the
Actors' Guild. Miss Rainer added
she "dislikes" passing through the
picket lines.
