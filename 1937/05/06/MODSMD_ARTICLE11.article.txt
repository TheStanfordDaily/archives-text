# Japanese Win Over Indian Tennis Team
## Lynch Defeated 6-1, 6-3, Braly 6-4, 9-7; Pommer, Underwood 6-4, 6-4 
### 
A capacity crowd of tennis en
thusiasts turned out yesterday to
watch the Stanford varsity bow to
the Japanese Davis Cup aggregation
in three closely fought contests on
the Card courts.
Indian netters entered the tour
ney favored to win easily over their
Nippon rivals, whom they discov
ered to be powerful even though
they lost every match in their Davis
Cup challenge tournament against
the United States last Sunday,
Lynch Loses
Jiro Yamagishi, captain of the
Japanese team and tennis champion
of Japan, defeated Jack Lynch, 6-1,
6-3. His return shots were too fast
and too well placed for the Indian
singles ace to regain his balance in
time to stroke effectively.
Although his service was not
strong, Yamagishi showed an excel
lent forehand stroke and a stinging
backhand. He used his forcing vol
ley shots to great advantage. Al
though he is famous for his fine net
game, he played most of his singles
match back court.
Braly Till Close
More evenly matched was the
singles contest between Bob Braly
and Fumiteru Nakano, second
ranking ace from the Orient, which
the latter won, 6-4, 9-7. Both sets
were contests between two excellent
forehand brokers.
Although Braly wielded a more
powerful racket, the Nippon's shots
were more accurate and more con
sistent. Nakano's acutely angled
and well - aimed return shots
proved too much even for Braly, an
excellent backcourt player.
Doubles Match
Underwood and Pommer showed
distinct superiority throughout their
doubles matches with Yamagishi and
but the Japanese aggrega
tion flourished near the end of each
set to chalk up a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
the Card combination.
The Stanford pair started out
sure winners with four straight
games over their Japanese oppon
ents, but the Nippons came back
with six victories to take the set.
The second set was won in much the
same manner.
'Intcrcollcgiatcs'
Varsity netters arc now awaiting
word from the Board of Athletic
Control, which will decide whether
or not to send representatives to the
national intercollegiate matches at
the Merion Cricket Club in Phila
delphia next summer. Stanford at
present retains a good reputation
from last year's tournament at
Northwestern University, where
Bill Seward, present varsity captain,
and Ben Dey became doubles
champs, and Dey reached the semi
finals in the singles contests.

Varsity netters arc now awaiting
word from the Board of Athletic
Control, which will decide whether
or not to send representatives to the
national intercollegiate matches at
the Merion Cricket Club in Phila
delphia next summer. Stanford at
present retains a good reputation
from last year's tournament at
Northwestern University, where
Bill Seward, present varsity captain,
and Ben Dey became doubles
champs, and Dey reached the semi
finals in the singles contests.
A capacity crowd of tennis en
thusiasts turned out yesterday to
watch the Stanford varsity bow to
the Japanese Davis Cup aggregation
in three closely fought contests on
the Card courts.
Indian netters entered the tour
ney favored to win easily over their
Nippon rivals, whom they discov
ered to be powerful even though
they lost every match in their Davis
Cup challenge tournament against
the United States last Sunday,
Lynch Loses
Jiro Yamagishi, captain of the
Japanese team and tennis champion
of Japan, defeated Jack Lynch, 6-1,
6-3. His return shots were too fast
and too well placed for the Indian
singles ace to regain his balance in
time to stroke effectively.
Although his service was not
strong, Yamagishi showed an excel
lent forehand stroke and a stinging
backhand. He used his forcing vol
ley shots to great advantage. Al
though he is famous for his fine net
game, he played most of his singles
match back court.
Braly Till Close
More evenly matched was the
singles contest between Bob Braly
and Fumiteru Nakano, second
ranking ace from the Orient, which
the latter won, 6-4, 9-7. Both sets
were contests between two excellent
forehand brokers.
Although Braly wielded a more
powerful racket, the Nippon's shots
were more accurate and more con
sistent. Nakano's acutely angled
and well - aimed return shots
proved too much even for Braly, an
excellent backcourt player.
Doubles Match
Underwood and Pommer showed
distinct superiority throughout their
doubles matches with Yamagishi and
but the Japanese aggrega
tion flourished near the end of each
set to chalk up a 6-4, 6-4 victory over
the Card combination.
The Stanford pair started out
sure winners with four straight
games over their Japanese oppon
ents, but the Nippons came back
with six victories to take the set.
The second set was won in much the
same manner.
