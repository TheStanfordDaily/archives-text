'Roadside' Starts

single night's run, eclipsing the most j
successful play of last season, "June '
Moon, also a one-night stand, for j
' which 548 tickets were sold.

| line v/tih 1032 seats sold in two nights
I and $123 made. In making its $40 j
; plus profit "Lady Precious Stream" |
drew 450 customers Friday night'
and 340 Saturday night.
Two Productions
The season's second unusual fea
i ture in its return to normalcy was '
j innovation of giving two perform
ances of a production. "Precious" \
I and "Idolatry" were the first dramas
'to be replayed in seven years.'
Daugherty said.
With an expanded program more I
money was spent during the season ;
than in past years. "Idolatry" was the 1
most expensive play to be produced, I
with "Roadside" the cheapest.
Total profits for the regular pro- j
ductions was $319.30. Money made <
in the Big Game Gaieties, also under j
Dramatic Council sponsorship, was
used to help pay off the Council's
$900 debt.
