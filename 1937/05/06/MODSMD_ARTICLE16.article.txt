# Row Builds; Architects Rejoice
## 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Prosperity is just around the cor
ner for those architects who are for- j
tunate enough to make connections |
with the fraternity and sorority ad- !
ministrators of Mr. Hoovers Alma
Mater.
Depression which has been plagu- |
ing contractors, builders, and archi- j
tects since '29. breathed his last yes- ,
terday, when no less than nine of
the houses on Stanford's Row made I
public their tentative plans for re- [
modeling, rebuilding, and renovat
ing their living quarters.
New Dckc Mansion
Most definite, as well as most
sumptuous plans for "reconstruc- j
tion" are those drawn up by the l
brotherhood of Delta Kappa Epsilon. 1
The "Deke" program calls for an I
expenditure of $50,000 with which
they will make over entirely their
house, garden, and even the cook's |
living quarters.
Details divulged by Howard Rob- |

inson give a rough idea of the
D.K.E. construction campaign. The
house will be completely rebuilt in
natural hardwood, wtih three show
ers on each upstairs floor, and two
sleeping porches on the upper stor
ies. Externally, the Deke mansion
will be flanked by a garden three
times the size of the present ono.
A Car in Every Garage
Behind the building, which is to
resemble the present one in its Co
lonial style of architecture, a new
garage with be built with accommo
dations for nine automobiles. Three
rooms for the cook, his wife, and the
second boy are to be built adjacent
to the garage. Most striking evi
dence that the heretofore democratic
Deke "roughs" have "gone Holly
wood" will be tound in the new
patio which will serve to set off
their front yard from intrusion by
the casual passer-by.
A new chapter room, games room,
and library on a new wing which
they are adding will serve to enlarge
and generally enhance the beauty of

I the new living quarters.
Further up the Row, the ham
mer of carpenters' tools will also
| soon be heard., This time the hous
l ing program is being carried out by,
! and on behalf of, the Alpha Omicron
j Pi sorority. A new wing to be added
to their house will include a new
I suite of rooms for their house
mother and a small sleeping porch.
On the first floor of their home,
i the Alpha O's are adding a combina
| tion chapter room and library. They
I are also going to enlarge their din
| ing room and their den. Not unlike
the Dekes, the A.O.P.'s will likewise
' have a patio, extending from the
: rear of the liVing room to the back
i yard.
The Fiji's feminine neighbors also
plan to renovate the individual up
stairs rooms of their house, add
' some new furniture, and modify to
a slight degree the external ap
pearance of their residence. The
; present English style of architecture
1 will be retained in the general pat-
I tern of the new structure.
