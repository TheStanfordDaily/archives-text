# Clubs Withhold Tax on Hashers
## Eventual Escape From Payment Expected 
### 
Fraternities, sororities, and eat
ing clubs intend to keep the Cali
fornia Unemployment Reserves
Commission waiting for its "hash
er" tax, Interfraternity Council de
cided last night.
The living groups registered with
a commission representative here
last week, but had withheld decision
on paying the tax until they had
talked it over with experts.
Their experts — Professor Elmer
Fagan, Professor Stanley Morrison,
and Warren Turner, fraternity au
ditor—advised them to put their tax
payments in a trust fund at a Palo
Alto bank until the commission has
decided if Stanford organizations are
liable for the tax.
Two Other Alternatives
The Council gave its members two
other alternatives. They could either
pay the tax now "under protest,"
hoping for eventual refund, or with
hold paying at all until next fall,
when an additional penalty will be
due. Dan Moulton. Council presi
dent, said most houses would follow
the latter proposal.
If the commission continues to in
clude honorary officers as "employ
ees," every Stanford eating organi
zation is subject to the tax. It
amounts to between $40 and $60 a
house for 1936 and first quarter of
1937.
May Be Totally Exempt
Moulton and his colleagues are
hoping, however, that they won't
have to pay the tax at all. If the
national Social Security Board rules
that fraternities are "educational"
institutions, the California commis
sion subsequently wiii exempt all
Stanford organizations.
The Council also established a
new committee to entertain high
school athletes and outstanding stu
dents on their visits to the Farm.
Machinery was set in motion which
will take care of guests sent here by
alumni clubs in other cities.
