tonight, in conjunction with the
course on motion pictures.
Tickets for the remaining three
productions of the foreign movie se
ries; may be purchased at the A.S.S.U.

G. W. Pabst directed tonight's film,
and made a break with the old Ger
man style and tradition. "The Love
of Jeanne Ney" owes its pictorial
.style to novel use of the camera. It
demonstrates fully the eloquence
which a simple but intelligent use
of the camera may achieve. Pabst
and his cameraman, Fritz Arno
Wagner, excell in selection of cam
era positions.
Tlie story has a Russian back
ground, and concerns a young
couple whose lives are mingled with
the course of events in modern
Europe and who seek some courage
and comfort in each other.
