# Strike Delays Initial Nitery 'Jam Session'
## Arrangements Rushed To Engage City Orchestra For Opening Jolly-up 
### 
Grand opening of the Union Nit- !
ery has been postponed by the same :
strike that is keeping San Fran
cisco's night-spots dark.
This was revealed last night by A1 |
Hyman, chairman of the Nitery j
Committee, who has been trying to ,
get a city orchestra to play for the j
opening Jolly-up.
Despite delay in remodeling, Hy- i
man says he is certain of getting the |
Nitery open next Wednesday at the |

latest. It is now ready for occu
pancy.
Above all else, the Nitery is in
tended to be a campus social center.
As such, it will be used for informal
gatherings as well as tlie dancing
planned for Friday and Saturday.
One plan to be pushed is a regular
Student-Faculty get-together for an
hour or so each week, according to
Ilyman. Through it, the campus
hopes to establish better relations
with the faculty.
The Nitery Committee, composed
of A1 Hyman, Isabel Goldthwaite,
and Barbara Murphy, will meet to
night to decide program details for
the rest of the quarter.
