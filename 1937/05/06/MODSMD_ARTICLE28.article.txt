# Tradition Origins Recalled Days of Plug Ugly Cited
## 
### 
The day of the "rough," with his
dirty cords, his misshapen, un
pressed clothing, his unshaven face,
and his model T Ford is over, but
Stanford tradition is still going
strong.
Some traditions, such as the
Masque Ball, which was started by a
Phil Delt party for the Convalescent
Home, have had a very informal be
ginning. Others, like the famous '"no
smoking on the Quad" resolution,
which was established by vote of
the Associated Students at the re
quest of Mrs. Stanford, have had a
more formal beginning.
Plug-ugly Cited
The turn of the century brought
the Plug-ugly, grey or brown plug
hats worn by the juniors, taken over
from the supporters of an unsuccess

j ful national political candidate,
i Along with the Plug-ugly, the jun
| iors gave an annual show, which in
its later years invariably ended in a
riot. But, after several participants
were badly hurt, this custom was
abolished.
Friday night calls on faculty mem
bers were once traditional, but the
coming of the automobile and
growth of the University choked this
tradition. Recent attempts to revive
this practice have been made.
After the war, with an apathetical,
disillusioned student body, men and
women went about with a cynical,
don't-care-about-anything air. This
and the "500" brought the traditional
"rough"' into full being.
Ride to Paly Starts
"The ride to Paly" came with the
automobile. But in 1923 and 1924
automobiles became the subject of
much argument, and they were
nearly abolished from the campus.
The entire Daily staff argued that
cars make the campus undemo
cratic. But the "motor age" won.
The Convalescent Home Drive
was started by several small groups.
Dr. Charles Gardner's small summer
camp for children on the campus
and his Social Service Club started
the Home itself. Labor Day came
from A1 Roth's appeal for several
men to help clean up the trash that
workmen left in the Home the day
before its formal opening.
Virtually all traditions have cen
tered on the preservation of Stan
ford democracy or the improvement
of the Stanford standards.
