# Golden Rivet Couldn't Take It
## 
### 

WHAT WAS PLANNED as a historic ceremony had an unhappy climax when the golden "last" rivet in
the $35,000,000 Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco shattered beneath a pneumatic hammer and dropped in
a shower of splinters to the bay below. Here is the start of the ceremony. Chief Engineer Joseph B. Strauss
holds the rivet as Ed Stanley, who drove the bridge's first rivet, is about to drive this one. The rivet cost
$400.
