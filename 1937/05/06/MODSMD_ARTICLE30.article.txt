Trucks scurry along all campus
; roads; steam shovels dig; plaster is

work rises with a bang.
NEW PARKING AREA on the
, south side of the Library will prob
j ably be completed by the beginning
!of next week. All the grading and
leveling has been done, and the
space is now being surfaced with
j crushed rock. Opening of the area
: will mark the end of the traffic con
gestion around the Libe which has
j been a problem the last few months.
IN THE AMPHITHEATER, ter
j races for the movable seats are
completely installed. Each tier af
| fords adequate room for a seat and
j legs of any length. Terraces are
supported by natural-looking green
boards.
Stage, sides, and seating area of
the newly named Laurence Frost
Amphitheater are completely plant
-1 ed with sod and will soon be carpet
; ed with brilliant green lawn. Plant
ing is practically finished. All large
! trees are in on the inside of the
bowl, and only a few remain for the
! outside.
IN THE NEW THEATER the
basement is scene of the installa
| tion of elaborate air-conditioning
[equipment. Gigantic copper air
washers will purify the air and send
it into the blowers. From these a
' labyrinth of pipes will distribute
j 100 pure oxygen to the lungs of au
| dience and actors.
Dressing rooms for the actors are
! numerous, large, convenient, and
have lots of windows (all of which
jis quite unusual, acording to thes
jpians). Tiled drinking fountains,
i gifts of the Class of '35,' similar to
: those on the Inner Quad are being
I installed in the theater.
ASSEMBLY HALL will be con
! verted into quarters for the Grad
uate School of Business during sum
i mer quarter and will be ready for
I occupancy next fall if the necessary
j funds are available. Just what the
| financial status in regard to the
building is will not be definite for
some weeks.
Exterior of the remodeled build-'
ing will be unchanged except for
windows in the rear, where the pres
ent stage is located. In addition to
new classrooms and offices the
[building will house the library of
the Business School; special provi
sions will be made for stacks.
