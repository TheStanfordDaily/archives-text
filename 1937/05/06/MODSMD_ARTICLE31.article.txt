# LAW REMOVES TEETH
## 
### 
HENDERSON, N.C., May 5 (U.R).â€”
James Emanuel, negro, took out his
false teeth today and handed them
over to a man armed with a legal
document. J. B. Hawkins, negro
dentist, repossessed the teeth in an
effort to collect his fee for making
them.
Death Valley was so named in 1849
when 18 of 30 gold-seekers perished
there.
