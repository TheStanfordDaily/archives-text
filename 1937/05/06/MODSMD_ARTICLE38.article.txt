THEY TELL mo Boh Zeimer is
getting the hird over in Branner
because he got his name in the paper
the other day. He should worry—
he isn't in the same boat with some
individuals I know, who get the bird
every day for what's in the Daily,
especially for the butches that they
didn't have anything to do with.
The sports editor, of course, is no
exception—isn't that right, Weier
shauser?
LAST WEEK was the last week
indeed for Bob Wesson, the bespec
tacled gent with a golden smile who
used to be sports editor of the Daily
California!!, "Monarch of the College
Dailies," t'ra-la. They kicked him
out, they did, and put in a new
spoils editor, one Dick Tonc-r, along
with an entire new staff. In his
farewell column, poor old Bob took
a long look ahead, and a short look
backward, as a consummation of his
four years at Berkeley. (Everybody
else concerned has picked up Bob's
last column, it's fit to be handled by
the Stanford Daily now.)
IN HIS LONG-ING look forward
Bob could sec nothing but glee for
his Alma Mater in sports. In par
ticular, the curly-haired one dusted
off his crystal and saw Stub Allison
leading a wonderful California foot
ball team through the conference
undefeated, losing possibly to St.
Mary's in the non-conference open
er. Now, Allison has wonderful
prospects, that we will admit, and
on paper he will have a pretty good
outfit. But as for going through the
conference undefeated—nope.
NOT ONLY will the Bears be
lucky to go through the conference
undefeated, but any team on the
Coast will be lucky to do so. U.S.C.
is going to have an unknown team,
sprinkled with a number of veter
ans who might be just enough to
pull the old Horse past the rest of
the conference. Stanford will have
a team of veterans that is still un
known, a peculiar situation in foot
ball.
DON'T FORGET, that ball club
Thornhill fielded last year had a few
good games in it—that one against
Washington showed there was plenty
of gas and a strong spark, all that was
needed was a little fixing in the
timing gear, and the Big Red Ma
chine would have been ready to roll.
THERE'S A CHANCE that the In
dians will have a good hook-up be
tween the spark and the gas next
year, and if they have, watch out.
Even California won't be able to
stop 'em, veterans and all.
ALLISON HAD a great newspa
per team last fall, even though he
kept insisting the Bears were weak.
Allison was right for the first half
of the season, or ;he »first three
quarters of the season, but all the
figures showed Cal to have a mar
velous team. Well, it was virtually
the same outfit that Wesson is crow
ing about for this year, except that
it was stronger at the tackles than
this year's will be; and it still lost
plenty of Conference games.
VERY INCIDENTALLY, that is a
pretty good move of Allison's, hav
ing St. Mary's for the opener. The
Gaels are supposed to be good. Fine,
if the Bears open with a win they'll
look great and will get that psy
chology drive that's liable to carry
them a long way. If they lose, Al
lison can start harping on that old
underdog psych that's a honey of an
asset, if the Bears have any spirit at
all.
YOU CAN'T count Washington
out of it yet, either, because even
though they do lose that senior
backfield and a tough line there are
several veteran sophs coming up who
look wery, wery dangerous. Cruver
at full, Jones at a half, Captain
Waskowitz at a half, and several oth
ers are pretty fair prospects.
YE All, CAL has a good team on
paper, but if it's any slower getting
started this year than last it won't

be in the conference at all. Allison
might go through the conference un
defeated, sure, but the chances are
against it, considering how the Bears
usually act for the first month of
competition.
