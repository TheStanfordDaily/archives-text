# Reynolds, Hill Describe Impressions of Journey
## 
### 
The dominant note sounded by Jim Reynolds and Jim Hill, Stanford's
"good-will ambassadors, ' in their talks to the Luncheon Club yesterday
was the importance of bringing together the youths of all nations. "It is
only by better understanding between the young people that international
relations can be improved." they said.

It was principally for this purpose
that their journey to Mexico, Gua
temala, and Salvador was undertak
en—to meet students and govern
ment leaders and attempt to bring
about greater mutual understand
ing and sympathy.
Jim Reynolds told of their im
pressions of the universities in
those countries. "There is a distinct
European atmosphere about the
University of Mexico," said Reynolds
in describing his visit there. "The
school has an honor code which deals
with the ability of students to pay
tuition, rather than with honesty on
examinations as at Stanford," he
continued.
Jim Hill then told of their meet
ings with governmental officials and
of his impressions of the countries
visited. "A one-word description
of Mexico," he said, "would be the
word 'tragic'."
Their interview with Senor Licen
ciado Bateta, Mexican secretary of
state, was one of the most interest
ing and instructive. "Senor Bateta is
a brilliant man who knows the prob
lems of his country and is trying to
better conditions," said Hill. He also
described his introduction to the
president of Salvador, and the at
tending pomp and ceremony.
