# Weight Men Hit Tops In Practice Workouts
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Some of the boys on Dink Templeon's track team have learned what to
do now to come across U.S.C. in the dual meet coming up in the Stadium
Saturday afternoon.
Yesterday Tom Montgomery and A1 Ilershey worked themselves be
yond the saturation point in accusing each other of consistently dusting

off the 45-foot mark with their lb
pound shots, so Dink Templeton, to
avoid more serious trouble, gave
each four puts to settle the issue.
Hit 50-foot Mark
Then Jim Reynolds arrived while
the adrenalin was at high ebb and
got taken in on the match. Before
the dust had cleared the trio had
thrown seven tries over 50 feet, and
Reynolds ended with a top of 51-2,
his best in over a year; Hershey with
50-10 by a couple of feet a new
personal record, and Montgomery
with 50-5, his first time over the 50-
foot barrier. Owen Hansen, Trojan
has done 50-4, should be pressed
Saturday, at least.
Pete Zagar also seemed to like the
weather, and brought dust on the
160-foot stripe in the discus, his far
thest. He had a couple just a few
feet short of that. Wrotonowski and
Gaspar of the Trojans stand at 149
l'eet each, on performance.
Trojans Injured
Conflicting reports still arrive from
Los Angeles covering the state of
health of the Trojan teamâ€”they say
Crane has the flu, in addition to
Bush, Boone, and Lafond With weak
legs. All probably will enter, how
ever, but the first two may be con
siderably slowed by lack of prac
tice conditioning.
Stanford will practice in the Sta
dium this afternoon, with jumpers,
hurdlers, and sprinters getting the
feel of pits, rings, and the windy
straightaway. Tomorrow will be a
complete rest for everyone.
Place Points
Placing of the Stanford men still
occupied the greatest attention of
those connected with this coming
track meet, both within the fence
and behind it. Tallev is conceded

his first in the hundred by the most,
but the locating of Kneubuhl, Wei
ershauser, and Malott to take in
the remaining available points in the
short races is highly problematical,
will remain so until about 2 o'clock
Saturday,
Alexander, Burrows, and Mc-
Curdy too are causing concern. Troy,
with Portonovan and Yates, is
strong in the two-mile, and it will
need a strong Stanford entrant for
defense. How then to do this and
take some minor points in the mile,
together with a strong showing in
the half, is dreamfood for Temple
ton, the like of which no bridge
player ever knew.
Fortunate it is that field men are
not so versatile as track men, and
offer fewer variations of entry com
bination.
