PALO ALTO'S merchants who took a sound
lashing from Daily Editor Jorgensen's hu
moresque editorial whip several months ago,
may soon find themselves smarting from a
different, more formidable kind of switch.
This time the shopkeepers across the tracks
are up against a power more potent than the
organized Stanford with its unorganized wail;
one which will probably grasp them by the
proverbial nape, as they have so held the cam
pus.
This time they will probably battle with keen
edged dollar signs and slashed prices the com
petitive efforts of a newcomer who is treading
obtrusively into their realm of quiet co-opera
tion.
The Walgreen drug chain, known for apti
tude in meeting competition, will soon com
plete a new front on University, and if it ad
heres to policy elsewhere, the new front will
probably be backed with everything a drug
store can conceivably carry, plus a few things
extra.
Many a Palo Alto merchant will find it neces
sary to dust off the stock and reach for trade,
even campus trade.
One Paly monopoly—the show houses—will
obviously be unaffected. Having displayed the
books before Ex-Committeeman Bob Mallett,
and explained how they'd like to drop prices
but just simply can't, and how sorry they are
about it all, they stand exonerated, of course.
So the theaters take another round from a
campus which can't scrape together enough
gripes at one time to put up any kind of a
battle.
But other Paly merchants might be less for
tunate, for the competitive punch of this new
comer may carry more sting than the spas
modic screams of the indolent campus.—G. F.
