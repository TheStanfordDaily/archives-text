# Kappas Disclaim Promised 'Beef Trust' Burlesque
## 
### 
A blue-plate special tempest was
stirred up yesterday, when a flam
boyant red-lettered poster appeared
briefly outside of the entrance to the
Cellar, advertising that the Kappas
were to give a burlesque show for
the benefit of the eternal Convales
cent Home drive.
"A grand burlesque with forty new
girls and eight strip-tease acts," said
the poster, until some friend of the
Kappas tore it down.
Kappa suspicions center upon the
Zctes, it was rumored last night. An
unnamed Kappa reported "there
were too many Zetes standing
around the sign," as many as "11 choc
suns" at noon. After questioning
her sisters, the Kappa added that
their suspicions are that Bob Sher
man was responsible for the sign.
Sherman indignantly denied this,
saying, "I never heard anything
about it." Another Zete, speaking of
the Kappas, added. "They're crazy.
Why don't you forget about it?"
