# There's Music in the Air

### 
THE same dim interest in music that has
stifled any attempt at founding a symphony
orchestra at Stanford has—until last night —
kept the Farm's 60-voiced glee clubs officially
songless.
Last time anyone really heard of these sing
ers was seven years ago when they filled the
Assembly Hall with Bach and Grieg at one dol
lar a listener. The listeners, at that price, were
of course few.
Since then the glee clubs have never ap
peared in a campus concert of their own. They
have been neglectd by Stanford audinces be
cause they have been neglected by the Music
Department.
Not until Raymond Kendall took over two
years ago did anyone care enough to whip the
singers into shape for a public appearance. Mr.
Kendall, though, has groomed his charges so
well that San Francisco clubs and radio stations
have recently asked for and enjoyed their
services.
A Stanford audience is the most critical of
all, however, but last night's concert pointed
to the glee clubs' renascence. Good, if not bril
liant, song was well worth the 25 cents the
campus paid to hear it.—D. B.
