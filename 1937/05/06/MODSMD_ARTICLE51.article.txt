# Leisure Hours

(From the Oklahoma Daily)
EFFICIENCY engineers agree that four hours
of work a day would be enough in a prop
erly organized world. However, if such a Uto
pia were possible would we spend our leisure
time any more intelligently than the ape does,
or was Darwin right?
Professor Edward L. Thorndike, leading ex
perimental psychologist, shows in an analysis
of our lowmindedness that our craving for en
tertainment is so insatiable that most of us give
ourselves up to riding, dancing, games, sports,
listening to the radio, going to the movies and
other forms of amusement and recreation, no
matter how much leisure time we may have.
Professor Thorndike finds that 25 out of every

40 hours are spent lor entertainment and other
large fractions of time in gratifying a desire for
companionship and in games and sports.
A table compiled by Professor Niessen, au
thority on anthropoid apes, indicates in a gen
eral way how chimpanzees spend the day in
French Guiana. After he has slept eleven hours
at night, climbed after food and prepared it for
consumption, groomed himself, built nests,
looked for water and fought off rivals, it is easy
to conclude that he doesn't have much leisure
time.
But it is certain that he spends his free time
in getting all the fun possible out of life. The
ape races blithely through treetops during free
time while we race just as blithely from one
pleasure to another. Maybe Darwin had some
thing after all.
