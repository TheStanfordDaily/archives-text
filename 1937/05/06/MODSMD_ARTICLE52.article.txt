A FTER all these years of exhibits of bookplates, let-
ters of authors who lead horrible family lives, and
rare, old books that you wouldn't be seen dead with
(except in the Felton room) in those pretty glass
cases in the Libe, an enterprising member of the Re
serve Book Room stafl has started a very functional
sort of an exhibit down where the Lower Division lights
are usually burning.
The displays are about the current best sellers.
However, the sad and horrible fact about this func
tional exhibit is that it hasn't any function for the Libe.
The Library doesn't have any of these books. Frankly,
gentlemen, the Libe just doesn't give a damn about
best sellers. After all, there's been nothing very snappy
written since Milton.
Ired by the use of the word "individual" to include
both mice and men by his Psych prof, a statistical
Sigma Nu son of a famous statistical political scientist
took statistics. Though I wish at all times to warn
my readers to be objective in the use of figures, and
be careful at all times in conclusions to be drawn, the
statistical son discovered and disclosed that over a
space of weeks the professor used the word "individ
ual" 70 times in the course of one 50-minute lecture,
though his mean average was only 40 times. Though
I derive no conclusion from this statement, I hope my
readers will allow me to indulge in a little speculation
are we individuals or are we individuals?
IT IS a matter of no little surprise to many of us
that the scholars over at Menlo School for Boys
(and young men) have thoughts about women, too.
The young men at Menlo School for Boys, in conse
quence, every once in a while have a dance, to which
women are invited.
To the latest hop, skip, and prom, one of the young
men of very high social aspirations secured a date with
one of the forty (40) girls at the Kappa house. Now
this lady in question (though there are statistics to
prove that none of the forty (40) are ever that) was
the self-same queen whose picture was shipped from
coast to coast as Stanford's loveliest Kappa pledge
(1), and it is said that four Rally Committee men have
sworn under oath that at last year's freshman jolly
ups they got to dance five steps with her without
being tagged, though their feat was later discredited
since it was found that all four were dancing at the
same time.
Now these facts were the matter for a great deal of
pride on the part of the young man of very high social
aspirations, and he took great pains to let this fact be
bruited about the Pacific Coast. The young men of the
Menlo School for Boys, however, are a clannish lot,
and they resented such a to-do. As a result, the boys
conspired, and the young man of very high social
aspirations was unable to trade a single (1) dance
during the evening. What dreadful punishment.

However, the sad and horrible fact about this func
tional exhibit is that it hasn't any function for the Libe.
The Library doesn't have any of these books. Frankly,
gentlemen, the Libe just doesn't give a damn about
best sellers. After all, there's been nothing very snappy
written since Milton.
Ired by the use of the word "individual" to include
both mice and men by his Psych prof, a statistical
Sigma Nu son of a famous statistical political scientist
took statistics. Though I wish at all times to warn
my readers to be objective in the use of figures, and
be careful at all times in conclusions to be drawn, the
statistical son discovered and disclosed that over a
space of weeks the professor used the word "individ
ual" 70 times in the course of one 50-minute lecture,
though his mean average was only 40 times. Though
I derive no conclusion from this statement, I hope my
readers will allow me to indulge in a little speculation
are we individuals or are we individuals?
IT IS a matter of no little surprise to many of us
that the scholars over at Menlo School for Boys
(and young men) have thoughts about women, too.
The young men at Menlo School for Boys, in conse
quence, every once in a while have a dance, to which
women are invited.
To the latest hop, skip, and prom, one of the young
men of very high social aspirations secured a date with
one of the forty (40) girls at the Kappa house. Now
this lady in question (though there are statistics to
prove that none of the forty (40) are ever that) was
the self-same queen whose picture was shipped from
coast to coast as Stanford's loveliest Kappa pledge
(1), and it is said that four Rally Committee men have
sworn under oath that at last year's freshman jolly
ups they got to dance five steps with her without
being tagged, though their feat was later discredited
since it was found that all four were dancing at the
same time.
Now these facts were the matter for a great deal of
pride on the part of the young man of very high social
aspirations, and he took great pains to let this fact be
bruited about the Pacific Coast. The young men of the
Menlo School for Boys, however, are a clannish lot,
and they resented such a to-do. As a result, the boys
conspired, and the young man of very high social
aspirations was unable to trade a single (1) dance
during the evening. What dreadful punishment.
A FTER all these years of exhibits of bookplates, let-
ters of authors who lead horrible family lives, and
rare, old books that you wouldn't be seen dead with
(except in the Felton room) in those pretty glass
cases in the Libe, an enterprising member of the Re
serve Book Room stafl has started a very functional
sort of an exhibit down where the Lower Division lights
are usually burning.
The displays are about the current best sellers.
