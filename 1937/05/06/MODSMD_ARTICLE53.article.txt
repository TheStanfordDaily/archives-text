DRY FARMING
/ I HAMPIONING our shy angel of culture, the Tues-
A day Lecture, Dr. Hardin Craig has politely rebuked
my criticism of it.
Like most champions, Dr. Craig has assumed that he
must defend the principles back of the specific point
of controversy. This is unnecessary. There can be no
objection to a program which does provide the student
with a cultural background. Everyone will agree that
such is a "laudable undertaking."

But. the Tuesday Lecture never rcachcs the un
dergraduates. The "earnest students, of whom there
are overwhelming numbers," do not come. It is ob
vious, then, that the series does not discharge its pur
pose. A fire fighting company is a laudable undertak
ing, but if it doesn't get to the fire, it can hardly be
called successful.
The committee arranging the lectures is only partly
responsible for its failure. If we plough back into first
causes, as alma mater teaches us to do, we find that
the real trouble lies in the American tradition that
culMre be hard to take.
Like savages who discount any medicine that does
n't gag them, Americans seem to feel that nothing is
"improving" if they can listen to it without bankrupt
ing their reserves of faith, hope, and charity. The uni
form dry rot of the Tuesday series illustrates this. The
brilliance of an occasional lecture proves its fallacy.

T HE
idea that anything improving is by its nature dry
as the dust bowl pervades every phase of Univer
sity life. In a formal class, this is understandable; there
we are concerned wtih facts. But in an informal talk,
there is no reason for shouting "sacrilege" if instruc
tion and amusement are wedded.
Speakers here have been talented and learned men,
and undoubtedly their "standing upholds the dignity
of the University"; but their topics and treatment have
not appealed to the rough. After a day of sweating
and swearing over classes and labs, students want a
change of mental scenery—not a reasonably exact
facsimile of a history course.

It is possible that the idea of culture as a de
hydrated dose is so implanted in the student mind
that no lectures, however interesting, can lure him.
In that case, it would be better to give up the idea of
improving him, rather than lecture to the Paly citi
zenry at his expense.
Psychology department to the contrary, the under
graduate knows pretty well what he wants to get from
college. One thing that interests him is knowledge of
the world of modified and controlled competition that
is waiting on graduation. A series of talks by suc
cessful business men on practical problems would
draw crowds if cultural lectures would not. So would
discussion of current events.
The important thing is to smash the tradition that
nothing can be both interesting and valuable.
As Dr. Craig says, "Stanford University has a se
rious business." But we can be serious without being
grim.
