## APPARITIONAL LESSION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To Jim Stone:
I have read your critical analysis
(I think) of the spring performance
of "Lady Precious Stream." I'm ter
ribly happy over the fact that it
"taught you some sort of an object
lesson," but apparently that lesson
was merely an apparition of mind
over matter. I was trying to think
of something to say about your very
flattering criticism but it seems you
have taken the very words out of
my mouth ... "a dull sacrifice to
culture and art."
It must have been very embarrass
ing to have to condescend from
your exalted blow-hard opinion of
the play before you had any idea of
its contents or its possibilities, but
it must have been even more em
barrassing to attempt a dramatic
criticism of the play still knowing
nothing about it. Your ignorance
and complete lack of even horse
sense as to the purpose of the pro
duction is written in every line of
your analysis.
I can well understand why it was
extremely difficult for you to "dis
tinguish between Phyllis Lakin, Jim
Corner, Frances Farmer, and the
generals, and the sisters and the
cousins and . .
The old saying "Clever These Chi
nese" might well be applied to your
masterpiece of journalism, since it
is obvious that they certainly pulled
the wool over your eyes and held it
down during the entire performance.
You will pardon my using your
quaint manners of expression in this
article but they do seem to fit my
thoughts exactly. Now God and the
Daily staff willing, give us more of
these reviews, and a reviewer who
knows something . . . anything.
