The Editor, Sir:
Briefly, Monday's front-page re- j
view of "Lady Px-ecious Stream"
was by all odds the worst piece of j
alleged dramatic criticism to appear
in the Daily for some time.
The basis of this gripe is not the j
fact that the review presented the
play in entirely the wrong light, that 1
it accused Director Lange of a poor |
choice of shows, but that Jim Stone |
obviously knows nothing of acting, 1
nothing of dramatics, and more es- !
pecially is in complete and total ig
norance of Chinese drama. Here is j
the proof:
'"Things like the goose falling from
the light bridge made us wonder if 1
Dr. Hsuing didn't have a better eye j
to the tastes of western audiences
. . ." says Mr. Stone, as he labors j
under the delusion that this was in
serted as a "gag." In the Chinese
theater a piece of stick ornamented
with feathers represents a bird, just
as two small doors on steps repre
sents a cave, just as paper dropped
by the prop men represents snow.
Funny? Yes, and good for a laugh
anytime. But a gag written for a
western audience? No; merely the

Chinese way of doing things.
And thanks a lot for the opinion
of the costuming, which you charac
terized as better than the make-up.
But the make-up was authentic, and
the costuming was not real Chinese
at all and was the cause of many
headaches to Francis Wu and the
costuming staff. "What the process
was we do not know, but the show
had an easy, natural pace," continues
Mr. Stone.
Well, what does all this prove? It
proves your reviewer doesn't know
what he's talking about. Every man
is entitled to his opinion of the play,
but it is just as foolish for Jim Stone
to be allowed the position of dra
matic critic (even though, as I un
derstand it, he is only pinch-hitting)
as it would be for me to write a
daily column on economics, about
which I know nothing, as any of my
ex-econ professors will tell you.
And so to the pith of the matter:
for Heaven's sake get a dramatic
critic who knows his subject, or at
least refrain from publishing such
garbage. Intelligent criticism is al
ways welcome, no matter how ad
verse.
Sincerely,
Bud Cady
