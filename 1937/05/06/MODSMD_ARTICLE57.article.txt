If you like gay, mystery-comedy,
you will enjoy Fifty Roads to Town
! with Don Aincchc and Ann Sothern.
The show is rather unusual in that
' no one in the audience knows why
anything is happening until the last
I reel unwinds.
Ameche's acting doesn't approach
his superlative performance in Ra
mona, but it is fairly convincing in
| a snappish gangster manner, quite
typically conventional. You will be
j surprised, perhaps, to know that
Mr. Ameche has a mighty fine voice
for singing popular songs. After
: hearing him sing "Never in a Mil
lion Years" with Miss Sothern, you
will wish he had been given more
of a repertoire.
| Fifty Roads to Town is the type
of picture for which Miss Sothern

is usually chosen. Because of her
beauty, her limited ability is never
strained — but then, I suppose a
beautiful clothes-horse isn't ex
pected to contribute much in the
line of acting.
All considered, Fifty Roads to
Town is delightfully informal in
spots, full of double talk in others,
and offers some fun for those who
like light entertainment of little
merit.
The best thing about Outcasts of
Poker Flat is freckled, saucy Vir- I
ginia Weidler, who, incidentally, i
plays a darned good game of poker, i
Preston Foster as a lawless gambler j
is still Preston Foster.
Taken from Bret Harte's novel, |
Outcasts of Poker Flat is most val
uable as an accurate biography of |
California in its roaring days "when
men were men." The dialogue shows ;
skillful handling as it spouts prosy i
idealisms and colloquialisms of that j
age. '

rattles.
