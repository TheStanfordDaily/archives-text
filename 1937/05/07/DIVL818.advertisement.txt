SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND
. '
JUNIOR PROMISE
really more than just a promise—a
guarantee that youll be the Prom
sensation. Crisp, spirited white or
gandy—red-striped — topped by huge,
winged puff sleeves. It's fresh as the
Class of '40 — cool as a Senior —as
frivolous as a Prom frock should be.
Navy with white, if you prefer.
