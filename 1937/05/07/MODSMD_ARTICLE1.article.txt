# 33 Plunge to Death In Blazing Zep at Lakehurst
## Gas Blast Demolishes Hindenburg Crowd Shrieks as Ship Crumples Over Field, End to Ocean Flight 
### 
NAVAL STATION, LAKEHURST, :
N.J., May 6 (U.R).—A blast from ex- i
ploding hydrogen in her huge gas
hags brought the dirigible Hinden
burg to earth in flames tonight i
just as she was ready to nose into
a mooring mast at Journey's End.
Ninety-seven persons—passen
gers and crew—were aboard.
Thirty-three of them are dead
or missing.
It was one of the worst disasters
in the history of lighter-than-air j
craft, and the first time since the
World War that Germany's di
rigibles have failed to survive wind,
weather, and fire.
The Hindenburg—latest and fast
est of the great German sky queens ,
—was making her first voyage of •
Ihe season across the North Atlan
tic. She rode 014, L a severe rainstorm
along the Atlantic coast, gliding j
safely through and around forks of
lightning, and then—with a safe j
landirfg in her grasp—plummeted ,
aflame to the ground.
Flames leaped up her silver
sides, and eye witnesses reported
that there was one earth-shaking
blast followed by a series of
lighter ones.
.A ground crew had gone out to !
grasp the ropes and help bring the ,
big ship, sure and swift in the air j
but awkward when she came near
the ground, to a safe landing.
When the first blast came, the
ground crew fled for their lives.
Then they came back.
Smoke veiled half of the long, !
gray airship. There \yas nothing I
left of the other half but girders |
and steel framework—things that
fire could not destroy. Into that
wreckage, glowing red with heat,
plunged Naval Station sailors and
civilian onlookers, heedless of their
own safety.
Hundreds of yards away, wom
en shrieked hysterically as they j
saw bodies come plunging out of
the Hindenburg as she neared the
ground. Many of those who had
enough presence of mind to jump
arc alive tonight. Those who j
hesitated are dead—and burned' f
beyond immediate identification.
Twenty of the passengers are j
definitely known to be alive. Some
are critically injured and may die. j
Forty-four of the crew of 61 have j
checked into hospitals or reported j
themselves uninjured. i
Among those who may not live j
was Captain Ernst Lehmann, vet- !
eran of a score of Atlantic cross- !
ings. He was in Paul Kimball Hos- |
pital, Lakewood, badly burned, and j
just able to murmur:
"I don't understand it. I don't j
understand it."
