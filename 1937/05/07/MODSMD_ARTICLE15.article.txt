# Hand Decries Efficiency Aim
## 'Don't Exploit Activities,' Student Leaders Told 
### JOHN RICE 
Efficiency does not justify student i
exploitation of student government, \
Professor Harold C. Hand told the |
first meeting of the Leadership In- j
stitute last night.
Addressing more than 150 campus j
leaders, Professor Hand said that if j
the Administration sought efficiency,
it would put activities in charge of
professionals instead of making |
them an integral part of Stanford's [
curriculum.
"Student activities should har- j
monize with the purposes of the
University," he declared, "and
should be a laboratory of democ
racy in which the students are \
taught as active participants in a j
democracy."
Following Dr. Hand's address, |
Jackie Brown, head of the Leader
ship Institute, and Barbara Kimball
led discussion on:
THE STANFORD DAILY: "What
part should the press play?" Dr.
Hand felt that all staff members j
should share in formulating an edi
torial policy in line with the policy
of the University. Freedom of the
press, however, is a most important
aspect of democracy, he said.
Both President Reynolds and his
successor, Tom Killefer, agreed
that the Daily should be allowed to
exercise independent policy control. !
CARDINALS: Especially frothy
was the argument that Cardinal j
members were undemocratically
self-perpetuated! Defending Cardi- \
nals were Isabel Goldthwaite and ,
Barbara Murphy. Dean Mary Yost, i
Roble Director Leona Diekema, Pan
Hellenic President Barbara Paine,
and Miss Kimball felt that Cardi
nals' position between Rally Com
mittee and Ex Committee is not
properly organized.
Dean Yost suggested that Rally
Committee members be chosen by !
freshman class vote.
Miss Murphy countered that this j
would" not be as efficient as the pres
ent system, that Cardinals are
"really making an effort to pick
well."
"There is much work and little
glory for Cardinals," she said. Vot
ing is not a sure method of getting
hard workers. People do not neces- :
sarily elect people who are good."
EX COMMITTEE: "Is Ex Com
mittee truly representative?" Chief
weakness pointed out was that Ex
Committee members are represen
tative of no particular group.
Leonard Pockman suggested that
voting be put on the precinct sys
tem with representation by popula
tion.
Student manager was brought up
as being a peculiarly undemocratic
office. But Jack Calderwood, Ex
Committeeman, replied that the po
sition was necessary to protect local
merchants from the sometimes in
efficient organization managers.
The situation would be cased if
students were given more chance to
ask why or why not, Miss Yost
suggested.
"Drinking Nets Stiff Penalty
from Council" is a headline from the
December 7, 1926, Daily.
