# Alexander of Cards May Break Mile Record; Sefton, Pole Vault
## 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
Just how good is this year's
U.S.C. track team, anyway; can it
carry on the reputation of the
three-deep squads that have graced
the southern campus for years?
Can it continue its now four
straight winning streak over Stan
ford, defeat ,a bunch of boys who
are polished just for the purpose of
withstanding its onslaught to the
Pacific Coast Conference dual meet
championship?
That's what about 20,000 people
are coming to the Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow afternoon to find
out, and from 1:45 on, the goods
gradually will be unfolded in front
of them as the proteges of Dean
Cromwell and Dink Templeton
have at each other in two hours of
athletic combat.
Who's going to win? Well, if you
come from U.S.C., Troy is already
in, while if you're of the Stanford
following, ride with Dink Temple
ton: "We've definitely got a better
chance of knocking this crowd in
the creek than we had against Cali
fornia two weeks ago." Compara
tive scores, using the Olympic
Club, California, and U.C.L.A. as
go-betweens, give U.S.C. about a
3-point edge.
Upset Foreseen
Not since the first of two Stan
ford-U.S.C. meets in 1933 has the
Trojan juggernaut been beaten in
dual meet competition, and now, as
happened in that last great upset,
67-64, do those close to the Stan
ford cause foresee a surprise.
Troy looks to an all - around
squad, with world beaters in some
events and good defensive men in
all the rest, as its chance, while
Stanford, to win the meet, will
count on a number of clean sweeps,
and extremely high-point efforts of
the now well-publicized "iron men."
Records in danger are the mile
mark of 4:23,2, which Bob Alex
ander of Stanford has bettered sev
eral times this year, and the pole
vault's which Meadows and
Sefton of U.S.C. seem to toy with
on most of their vaults.
Cards Injured
The U.S.C. cripples, Boone, Bush,
and Crane, all probably will enter,
though the first two may suffer
from lack of practice. Stanford
cripples Beman, Hardin, Kellogg,
and Emanuel will not enter, while
Burrows, Hyde, and Madlem will
still be handicapped by injuries or
pursuant effects.
Weiershauser of Stanford defi
nitely will run the quarter, lows,
ardd relay, and will undoubtedly
take on one of the short sprints in
addition. Ray Malott will handle
the quarter, 220, and relay; Bill
McCurdy the 880, 440, and relay,
while both Alexander and Bur
rows like the idea of doubling in
the long distance runs.
The weight events, as usual, are
picking Reynolds, Gribbin, Mont
gomery, Hershey, and the rest of
Stanford, while Skinner, Crane,
Gracin, Thurber, and the Trojan
pole vaulters look overpowering in
the jump events.
Tallcy Win Conceded
Adrian Talley of U.S.C. is already
conceded the hundred, but the 220
is an open bout between Malott and
Crane. The quarter and half and
mile are the races in which Stan
ford invests its chance to come out
on top at the end of the festivities.
It is here that the "iron men" have
to go one-two, or better, to add on
to the conceded field points enough
to reach the coveted 66. »
Dink Templeton's men held a
light workout yesterday in the
Stadium, pronounced the pits and
rings in fine condition, but criticized
the soft and windy track, some
what of a change from their An
gell Field habitat. Angell Field
will lie deserted tomorrow after
noon with not enough spectator
space; race times will suffer ac
cordingly.
BERLIN, May 6 (U.R).—Trials of
monks on charges of immorality
continued today. In the Coblenz
court, where most have been tried,
three capuchins drew five-year,
three-year, and one month prison
terms, ill at hard labor.

events and good defensive men in
all the rest, as its chance, while
Stanford, to win the meet, will
count on a number of clean sweeps,
and extremely high-point efforts of
the now well-publicized "iron men."
Records in danger are the mile
mark of 4:23,2, which Bob Alex

vault's which Meadows and
Sefton of U.S.C. seem to toy with
on most of their vaults.
Cards Injured
The U.S.C. cripples, Boone, Bush,
and Crane, all probably will enter,
though the first two may suffer
from lack of practice. Stanford
cripples Beman, Hardin, Kellogg,
and Emanuel will not enter, while
Burrows, Hyde, and Madlem will
still be handicapped by injuries or
pursuant effects.
Weiershauser of Stanford defi
nitely will run the quarter, lows,
ardd relay, and will undoubtedly
take on one of the short sprints in
addition. Ray Malott will handle
the quarter, 220, and relay; Bill
McCurdy the 880, 440, and relay,
while both Alexander and Bur
rows like the idea of doubling in
the long distance runs.
The weight events, as usual, are
picking Reynolds, Gribbin, Mont
gomery, Hershey, and the rest of
Stanford, while Skinner, Crane,
Gracin, Thurber, and the Trojan
pole vaulters look overpowering in
the jump events.
Tallcy Win Conceded
Adrian Talley of U.S.C. is already
conceded the hundred, but the 220
is an open bout between Malott and
Crane. The quarter and half and
mile are the races in which Stan
ford invests its chance to come out
on top at the end of the festivities.
It is here that the "iron men" have
to go one-two, or better, to add on
to the conceded field points enough
to reach the coveted 66. »
Dink Templeton's men held a
light workout yesterday in the
Stadium, pronounced the pits and
rings in fine condition, but criticized
the soft and windy track, some
what of a change from their An
gell Field habitat. Angell Field
will lie deserted tomorrow after
noon with not enough spectator
space; race times will suffer ac
cordingly.
BERLIN, May 6 (U.R).—Trials of
monks on charges of immorality
continued today. In the Coblenz
court, where most have been tried,
three capuchins drew five-year,
three-year, and one month prison
terms, ill at hard labor.
Just how good is this year's
U.S.C. track team, anyway; can it
carry on the reputation of the
three-deep squads that have graced
the southern campus for years?
Can it continue its now four
straight winning streak over Stan
ford, defeat ,a bunch of boys who
are polished just for the purpose of
withstanding its onslaught to the
Pacific Coast Conference dual meet
championship?
That's what about 20,000 people
are coming to the Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow afternoon to find
out, and from 1:45 on, the goods
gradually will be unfolded in front
of them as the proteges of Dean
Cromwell and Dink Templeton
have at each other in two hours of
athletic combat.
Who's going to win? Well, if you
come from U.S.C., Troy is already
in, while if you're of the Stanford
following, ride with Dink Temple
ton: "We've definitely got a better
chance of knocking this crowd in
the creek than we had against Cali
fornia two weeks ago." Compara
tive scores, using the Olympic
Club, California, and U.C.L.A. as
go-betweens, give U.S.C. about a
3-point edge.

Not since the first of two Stan
ford-U.S.C. meets in 1933 has the
Trojan juggernaut been beaten in
