UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, May 6.—Riddled by
injury and ineligibility, U.S.C.'s 19.'i7
track edition will entrain tomorrow
night for the Redskin reservation to
take part in the most important col
legiate dual meet of the year Satur
day afternoon.
Appropriately, Saturday's conflict
between the top-ranking college
outfits in the country should be one
of the toughest of the season—in
fact, one of the toughest in the his
tory of Stanford-U.S.C. competition.
Figuring out a dope sheet is a
job that would frighten an under
taker, and as insignificant a gesture
as flipping a nickel and staying at
home. The outcome Ls so conjec
tural that five points either way
would be perfectly legitimate.
Trojan Hopes Rise
A little good fortune this past
week, however, brings new hope to
followers of the fortunes of Troy.
No less than seven men were back
in suit after ordered layoffs from
illness and injury. The most joy
ful news accompanied the recovery
of George Boone, Dean Cromwell's
handy man, who sprained his knee
in the, broad-jumping pits two
weeks ago. George, who is good for
points in the dashes, the 440, or the
broad jump, will be inserted where
Cromwell sees fit. Possibly, genial
Dean will use Boone in both the 100
and broad jump, although he is still
favoring the injured member.
Stanford fans will welcome the
glad tidings that Ross Bush, who
might have been the coast's best
runner in the 880 and mile, is defi
nitely out. Although the lanky
Texan has been working out on
Bovard Field this week, his heel
has .pot mended completely since he
pulled a tendon in the Olympic
Club meet. In both of these races
therefore, the Trojans are weak.
Phil Roulac, who has been alter
nating between the mile and the
half, is entered in the shorter race,
where he should wage a terrific
battle with Mahurin for second
place. We're conceding that first to
Bill McCurdy.
Upsets Possible
The mile, likewise, will be a
question of whether Ned Jensen
can squeeze March out for the sec
ond spot.
Greatest hope of victory for Dean
Cromwell's men lies in some up
sets he hopes to spring—for ex
ample, in the shot and discus, where
the impressive crew of weight men
for which Dink T&mpleton is justly
famous might be in for a surprise.
Offering competition for Zagar and
Gribbin are Phil Gaspar, a meaty
gent who slings the platter 150 feet
one day, 130 the next, and Art
Wrotnowski, consistency personi
fied at 145. One of these boys may
be hot enough to pull the unex
pected.
