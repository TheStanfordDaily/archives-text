UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, May 6.—Riddled by
injury and ineligibility, U.S.C.'s 19.'i7
track edition will entrain tomorrow
night for the Redskin reservation to
take part in the most important col
legiate dual meet of the year Satur
day afternoon.
Appropriately, Saturday's conflict
between the top-ranking college
outfits in the country should be one
of the toughest of the season—in
fact, one of the toughest in the his
tory of Stanford-U.S.C. competition.
Figuring out a dope sheet is a
job that would frighten an under
taker, and as insignificant a gesture
as flipping a nickel and staying at
home. The outcome Ls so conjec
tural that five points either way
would be perfectly legitimate.
Trojan Hopes Rise
A little good fortune this past
week, however, brings new hope to
followers of the fortunes of Troy.
No less than seven men were back
in suit after ordered layoffs from
illness and injury. The most joy
ful news accompanied the recovery
of George Boone, Dean Cromwell's
handy man, who sprained his knee
in the, broad-jumping pits two
weeks ago. George, who is good for
points in the dashes, the 440, or the
broad jump, will be inserted where
Cromwell sees fit. Possibly, genial
Dean will use Boone in both the 100
and broad jump, although he is still
favoring the injured member.
Stanford fans will welcome the
glad tidings that Ross Bush, who
might have been the coast's best
runner in the 880 and mile, is defi
nitely out. Although the lanky
Texan has been working out on
Bovard Field this week, his heel
has .pot mended completely since he
pulled a tendon in the Olympic
Club meet. In both of these races
therefore, the Trojans are weak.
Phil Roulac, who has been alter
nating between the mile and the
half, is entered in the shorter race,
where he should wage a terrific
battle with Mahurin for second
place. We're conceding that first to
Bill McCurdy.
Upsets Possible
The mile, likewise, will be a
question of whether Ned Jensen
can squeeze March out for the sec
ond spot.
Greatest hope of victory for Dean
Cromwell's men lies in some up
sets he hopes to spring—for ex
ample, in the shot and discus, where
the impressive crew of weight men
for which Dink T&mpleton is justly
famous might be in for a surprise.
Offering competition for Zagar and
Gribbin are Phil Gaspar, a meaty
gent who slings the platter 150 feet
one day, 130 the next, and Art
Wrotnowski, consistency personi
fied at 145. One of these boys may
be hot enough to pull the unex
pected.
The shot put, dull enough in it
sell, promises to be the real fea
ture of the meet, inasmuch as both
coaches boast three men capable of
heaving the lead pellet over 47 feet
any day in the week. Owen Han
sen, he of the bull neck, throws 50
feet, and Loren Miller and Bob
Fisher are not far behind.
Certain of 40 Points
The Trojans are counting heav
ily on five events for eight points
apiece. Adrian Talley and Clark
Crane rhould lead the pack in the
sprints. Incidentally, both nearly
equaled world marks on the same
day. Aided by a driving wind at
their backs, Talley whipped
through a century in 9.5 and Crane
came back later to run a 20.4
furlong, just short of Jesse Owens'
new standard. It is difficult to see
how Carew or Malott can take
better than thirds.
The rest of the flat races have a
definite Redskin hue, but Roy Sta
ley has recovered from a cold and is
ready to snap up five points in the
high hurdles.
Our pole vaulters are the pride
and joy of the team. Two good boys
who have bettered 12 feet 6 inches
will be left home to make room for
Captain Bill Sefton, new unofficial
record holder, Earle Meadows,
Olympic champion, and Irving'
Howe, an unsung lad who is good
for 13-6. Bud Day, a 14-footer, will
not make the trip either, as he is
saving his eligibility for next year.
Fear Madk'm
Jerry Gracin, who will be re
membered for his work on the bas
ketball quintet, is the latest fair
haired boy. Jumping G-4 against
U.C.L.A., Jerry is pointing for a
second place ahead of Morrison.
Our last hope is the broad jump,
although Boone and Skinner have
been erratic in their performances.
Madlem. conceded no better than
third, Ls the chief fear.
Well, now is the time for the Daily
Trojan staff to stick out its collec
tive neck. Troy by one point Ls our
choice—take it or leave it.
