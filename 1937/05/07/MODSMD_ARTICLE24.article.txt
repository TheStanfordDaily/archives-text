STANFORD IS BUILDING TODAY—but the sound of hammers
on the Memorial Theater, the Cubberley Building and the new La
gunita Wing sound like an amateur tap-dance compared U) the racket
way back when the original Quad was going up, millions of dollars

worth of construction all at once. At left is a rare view of the Engi
neering Corner, just half-done, with the nearly completed Memorial
Chapel towering up in the background.
Stanford went to war with a will in '18 as this crowded train

anyone shown in this view could know.
To the right is the last of the Toonerville trollies making its last

trip. In the background is Eneina Hall, and standing at extreme left
is a car, symbol of progress that made the trolley a museum-piece.
The fun is done with gasoline today, but old-timers remember when
the thing to do was to jump the rocking trolley,
