(Special dispatch to the Daily Palo
Alto.)
HONOLULU, March 1, 1905.â€”Mrs.
Jane Lathrop Stanford, widow of
United States Senator Stanford and
co-founder of Stanford University,
died at 11:40 o'clock last night at the
Moana Hotel here.
According to a telegram received
this morning by Charles G. Lathrop,
Mrs. Stanford passed away suddenly.
The telegram came from the physi
cian who has been attending Mrs.
Stanford and contained only the fol
lowing text:
"Mrs. Stanford died suddenly."
Mrs. Stanford was in her eightieth
year. According to the best informa
tion obtainable, her death was due to
tenninnual pneumonia.
She contracted a severe cold in the
latter part of January while residing
in her house in San Francisco. She
removed to San Jose, where she was
confined in her apartments at the
Hotel Vendome for about ten days.
The end of this time found her much
better and her doctors permitted her
to attend to some University affairs.
But on the advice of her doctors,
who urged a warmer climate and a
sea voyage, Mrs. Stanford sailed for
Japan on Thursday, February 16. At
this time she was in good spirits and
apparently on the road to recovery.
Five days later, Mr. Lathrop, her
brother, received a cablegram from
Mrs. Stanford at Honolulu stating
that she had arrived there safely
after a very rough trip. From that
tune until this morning's dispatch
bringing the news of her sudden
death nothing wa sheard from Mrs.
Stanford, and it was supposed that
she was satisfactorily regaining her
health and strength. It is reported
that Mr. Lathrop received a letter
from Mrs. Stanford this morning.
Mrs. Stanford was accompanied by
Miss Bertha Berner, her private sec
retary and traveling companion.
