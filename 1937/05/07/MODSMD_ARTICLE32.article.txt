# DOCTOR ROSS RESIGNS
## MRS. STANFORD DEMANDS THE PROFESSOR'S REMOVAL A 						Speech of the Sociologist's In Oakland Displeased Our Benefactress 
### 
November 14, 1900.
Dr. Edward A. Ross, at the insist
ence of Mrs. Stanford, has tendered
his resignation as head of the De
partment of Economics and Sociol
ogy, which was accepted Nov. 21,
and announced by Dr. David Starr
Jordan.
Professor Ross' resignation comes
as the result of statements which
he has made concerning Oriental
immigration and ownership of pub
lic utilities. Mrs. Stanford was
greatly displeased and, most unex
pectedly to Dr. Jordan, refused to
confirm his reappointment. As a re
sult of this, Dr. Ross was given a
! belated appointment June 2 for
| 1900-1902, through the earnest effort
I of Dr. Jordan.
Due to the outlook, he presented
his resignation. This was not acted
on at once as Dr. Jordan and S. F.
Leib, president of the Board of
j Trustees were doing everything in
| their power to prevail upon Mis.
I Stanford to alter her decision. Fail
ing, Dr. Jordan accepted the resig
! nation on November 12.
, Last April, Dr. Ross lectured in
' Oakland on "The Twentieth Cen
tury City." In this address he
pointed out the drift here and
abroad toward municipal ownership
of water and gas. In the matter ol
1 railways, he predicted a period of
municipal ownership ending in gov
! eminent regulation of private owned
| systems.
The next month at a mass meet
ing in San Francisco to protest Japa
nese immigration, Dr. Ross tried to
show that the high birth rate of the
Orient made it the land of "cheap
1 men," and that if Orientals were

allowed to pour into this country the
American standard of living would
be lowered.
Concluding his statement, Dr. Ross
said, "It is plain, therefore, that this
is no place for me. I cannot with
self-respect decline to speak on
topics to which I have given years
of investigation I have long
been aware that my every appear
ance in public drew upon the hostile
attention of certain powerful per
sons and interest* in San Francisco,
and they redoubled their efforts to
be rid of me."
Dr. Edward Ross will leave school
at the end of this semester. He has
no plans as to his future work, he
stated.
