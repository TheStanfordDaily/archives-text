# RULE OF "500" ENDED
## INFLUX OF WOMEN SEEN AS SWEEPING RULES PASSED Board of Trustees Establishes Old 55-45 Ratio; Faces "Exigencies" 
### 
May 12, 1933
Acting under the stress of strained
economic conditions, the Board of
Trustees yesterday afternoon shook
the campus with a bombshell report
that swept aside Stanford's famed
"500."
Basing the validity of their revo
lutionary action on a statement made
by Mrs. Stanford in 1903, just before
her death, the trustees announced
that beginning autumn quarter wo
men would be admitted on a ratio
roughly estimated to be 55 men to 45
women.
The proportion corresponds to that
prevalent at the time Mrs. Stanford
issued her official edict in May of
1899 limiting the women to 500.
In this year Mrs. Stanford noted
a steady increase of women attend
ing the Universities throughout the
state. To halt this movement at
Stanford, founded as a memoriam to
her son, the limiting rectriction was
; read into the founding grant, al
| though men and women were placed
1 on an equal standing.
The Trustees pointed out that the
j action taken was not in conflict with
| Mrs. Stanford's broader aims.
Dr. Wilbur said: "It seems clear
that under the stringency which the
1 University is facing, the paramount
I purpose of the funders to maintain
the University at a high degree can
' best be served by considering the
â€¢ limitations imposed by Mrs. Stanford
j as 'incidental and subordinate.' "
He explained that Stanford has the
1 plant, facilities, and faculty to handle
i the increased enrollment of women,
j Possibility of housing facilities seem
somewhat doubtful, however.
September 20, 1934
Enrollment of women has reached
the thousand mark this fall, increas
ing by 200 over the numbered regis
tered last year.
The feminine portion of the stu
dent body has doubled since the
"500" ban was lifted two years ago
The two women's executive organi
zations, conference and council, fore
see a year of hard work, with oppor
tunities for accomplishing a great
deal.
