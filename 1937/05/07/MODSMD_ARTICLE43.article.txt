# Daily Censorship? Existed Even in '10
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto had censor
ship troubles, too. In 1910, a mem
ber of the staff was suspended from
and derogatory to the University,
fairs Committee on the grounds that
he "was an accessory to the pub
lication of articles which were false
and derogatory to the Uniyersity.
"It seems that the offense con
sisted in the fact that the article in
question intimated that the girls
were light, frivolous and giggly;
that they thought more of getting
the men away from the environs of
Roble than of extinguishing a fire
which broke out in the hall; in
short, that it lowered the estima
tion of University girls in the eyes
of the world."

Editorial in The Daily, January 23, I
1902: "Although no serious conse
quences resulted from the runaway
this morning, the passengers were
in great danger because of the care
lessness of the driver in leaving his
horses unattended when the bus was
full of people."
