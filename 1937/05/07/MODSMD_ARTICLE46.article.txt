"AXE REGAINED"
. _ i.wuu..iio that blazed
across ihe iront page of the Daily
on that memorable morning in
April, 1930. Only twice during the
31 years from April 15, 1899, until
April 3, 1930, did a Stanford man
get his hands on the cherished
weapon.
Finally, on that April afternoon,
the "Immortal Twenty-one" rode
up to Berkeley where they joined
the Californiaris in their big rally.
Stanford Daily, April 7, 1930 —
"At 4:30 Thursday afternoon three
cars slipped quietly away from
Stanford and headed for Berkeley,
for Cal, and for the Axe.
Attend Rally
'"During the rally at the Greek
Theater the members of the twenty
one band cautiously edged their
way to the heart of the bowl so
they could be near the axe at the
cessation of the affair.
"Ten minutes before the rally
closed, five Stanford men secretly
left the Greek Theater. They were
the fake cameramen. . . . They
drove to the bank (where the axe
was kept), backed the car onto the
sidewalk, and rigged up a camera
in the rumble seat.
Take Stand at Bank
". . . It was not long before a
black, stee 1 -covered Studebaker
hove into sight. It carried the axe.
. . . The twenty-one took positions
around the car and near the bank
door.
". . . An overloaded shot of flash
light powder was discharged with
a blinding flash and whitish puff,
just as Norm Homer, axe custo
dian, stepped from the car.
Seize Axe
"Scarcely had Horner touched
the sidewalk than Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car
upon the body of the unsuspecting
custodian, wrenched the axe from
Horner and passed the implement
through several hands to Loof
borrow.
Axe Hid in Sweater
"Loofborrow tucked the treas
ured axe beneath his sweater and
calmly walked through an opening
made for him in the crowd by Stan
ford men. Few suspected that un
der Bob's brown sweater lay hid
den that precious trophy which
California had guarded for 31 years.
He slowly walked to the camera car,
got in, and away went the ma
chine,
"For Howard Avery, that 190-
pounder who jumped on Horner,
the recovery of the Stanford Axe
was a family affair. His mother had
been on the campus back in '99
when the Californians first ob
tained possession of the trophy."
Press Unexcited
Back in the olden days of '99 the
press was terribly slow. The Axe
was taken from three Stanford men
after a baseball game on Saturday,
April 15, but nothing appeared in
the Daily Palo Alto—the Daily's
,i'm» .n da>_; —until April 19,
and then only a gentle ribbing was
given Cal in the editorial columns.
In 1932, Ex Committee voted to
put the axe up for a Big Game tro
phy starting in 1933. The famous
Vowing Soph football team man
aged to keep the trophy in Stan
ford's possession during their stay
on the Farm. Then last fall Stan
ford went down in defeat to the
Golden Bears and California again
had the axe in her possession.
It will only be a matter of time
before Stanford will again have her
axe back.
"The Daily Palo Alto" of Septem
ber 11, 1906, announced that Nevada
had adopted the "new game" of
rugby and that a match between
that school and Stanford had been
scheduled.
