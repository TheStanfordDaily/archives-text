## GRADES GO ON CARDS A, B, C, D MARKS TO BE PLACED ON STUDENT REPORTS Culminates Movement Started Three Years Ago When Idea Was Defeated 
### 
January 13, 1911
By a vote of 41 to 19, the Univer
sity Council last night passed the
ruling that henceforth A, B, C, and D
grades will be entered on student re
port cards.
This culminates the movement
started three years ago when such a
recommendation was defeated in
Council. As yet no definite system
has been devised whereby these
grades are to be arrived at, but it is
understood that such reports will be
made at the end of each semester.
Although since 1903 the university
has used this grading system on
records in the Registrar's office and
since 1908 has been used on tran
scrips for other universities, only the
single grade "passed" has been used
on student grade-cards.

January 7, 1918.
As a result of the adoption of psy
chological tests by the United States
army, Prof. Lewis M. Terman of the
Stanford School of Education has
been summoned to Washington by a
telegram from the War Department.
He left San Francisco at noon today
on the way to the East.
