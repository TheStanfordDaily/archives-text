## 
### 
January 10, 1918
Will President Ray Lyman Wilbur
resign? That is the question that
will be asked of him, by a man pur
porting to be a 'direct descendant of
Leland Stanford, Junior, who was
on the campus this morning to see
the president. The claimant foi
presidential honors says he was born
in 1868, is now 55 years of age, and
that he just lately discovered him
self to be Ihe proper man to occupy
the presidential chair of Stanford
University.
He appeared at the President's of
fice this morning under escort of
friendly Palo Alto people, and was
disappointed to find President Wilbur
out, but asserted his intentions of re
turning this afternoon and demand
ing the President's resignation at
once. He added that he will be a
candidate of the United States in
1920.
