# Former Pranksters Revisit Crime Scene
## Enthusiasm Reflected In Grads' Letters 
### 
What is a reunion without remin
iscences? That's no consideration
for the Stanford alumni who will be
on campus tomorrow to celebrate
university Day, for they have ex
ploits galore to be reminisced about, j
Remember those traditional es
apades like stealing the axe from
Cal, and stabling the cow in a Se
quoia man's room? They all started
back in the days when alumni were
students.
Enthusiastic letters
The call has been sounded for
those former students and they're
trooping back to the campus to re
live their college days for a week
end. Class presidents and reunion
chairmen have contacted their class
mates in letters which reflect their
j own enthusiasm.
Ben S. Allen, reunion chairman
for the classes of '06, '07, '08, and '09,
said in his letter of invitation, "Now
|it can be told. Our four classes
[ made history at Stanford and the
time has arrived for us to tell all."
Playing upon the memories of his
'23 classmates, Claude Conn wrote,
"Do you remember springtime on
the Quad when you had the insa
tiable urge to do anything except
study and work? When your great
desire was to live forever on the
j campus, without a care or responsi
bility in the world?"
'12 Celebrates
The years roll by, but they mean
little to the Class of '12, which will
celebrate its 25th anniversary dur-
I ing the reunion.
Says the reunion committee, "If
you think this is to be a solemn,
! sedate ceremony you're wrong. On
j our silver anniversary we refuse to
i be weighed down by contemplation
;of the quarter-century which has
! rolled by since we left Stanford.
Rather would we revive the spirit of
camaraderie that marked our un
dergraduate days. In other words,
we want to have a bang-up good
j time."
