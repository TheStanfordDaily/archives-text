# Harrison Forced To Pay Admission
## 
### 
Benjamin Harrison, ex-President
of the United States, was admit
ted free to a baseball game at Stan
ford, but had to pay for his admis
sion like any other spectator.
In spite of Harrison's objections,
Herbert C. Hoover, baseball man
ager, demanded that the full ad
mission price be paid.

Historians value highly the finding
of the marker plats of Sir Francis
Drake on San Francisco Bay shore.
