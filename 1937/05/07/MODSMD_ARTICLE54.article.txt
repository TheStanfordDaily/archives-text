# Durand Puts Student Over Achievement
## Scientist Feels Teaching Work More Important Than Accomplishments 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
William Frederick Durand is very
happy about this dinner they are
giving him up in San Francisco to
night. But he thinks that maybe
they have the wrong idea.
"For his great achievements in
the field of aeronautical and marine
engineering," read the announce
ments. Dr. Durand wishes they'd
forget about that. His greatest
achievements, ho feels, are the men
he has built and the minds he has
helped develop while teaching at
Stanford.
He Retired. But Didn't Quit
While trains and planes were
nearing San Francisco from every
corner of the land carrying his
friends and former students — now
famous scientists and engineers —
this little, white-bearded gentleman
was yesterday afternoon working at
his desk in a corner of the great
Guggenheim Laboratory. That he
retired from his professorship 13
years ago has never meant "quits"
for William Durand.
"Yes, I have missed the actual
teaching," he mused. "The human
product I have been able to influence
has been the most important work
of rny career.
Teaching Lives On
"What I gave to my students will
go on. They will give it to others.
Teaching, you sec, has indefinite
life."
His interest in students went far
beyond the classrooms. When he
came to Stanford from Cornell, at
President David Starr Jordan's invi
tation, he brought with him the love
of rowing. As Cornell was noted for
her brilliant crew, Dr. Durand at
tempted to develop one here. After
a few races against California, how
ever, he realized that Cornell's nat
ural advantages were not Stanford's.
Crew racing was discontinued and
the young engineering professor was
appointed chairman of the Student
Affairs Committee. v
"Student government then was
n't what it is now," he said. "Our
committee, besides handling dis
cipline, tried to develop in the stu
dents an essential responsibility as a
member of a community.
They Did It Then
"Our problems weren't so much
different from yours. Drinking and
cheating, now and then. And that
natural exuberance of youthful
spirits bubbled over a bit some
times." His keen, hright eyes twin
kled from behind his spectacles.
Dr. Durand has never "settled
down." Even at 78 years he is still
exceedingly active in aeronautical
research. Right now he heads two
committees of the National Academy
of Sciences on the future of airships
and the stabilization of great steam
ships.
Gardening Is His Hobby
Between trips East and to Europe,
however, Dr. Durand enjoys his
hobby. It is gardening.
"My garden is my recreation. 1
know that when I finish out there I
will have some growing, living re
sult." Rather like his views on
building men instead of machines.
