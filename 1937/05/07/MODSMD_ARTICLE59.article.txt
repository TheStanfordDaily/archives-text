### 
April 18, 1906
Beginning at about seven minutes
past five this morning and lasting
for fully twenty seconds, the greatest
earthquake of modern times shook
the campus. The effect was terrible. |
Two lives were lost, six injured, and
the damage done to buildings Presi
dent Jordan places at $2,800,000.
The first shock in Encina Hall '
brought 300 scantily clad men into !
the corridors in a mad rush for |
safety and the open air. The road in j
front was filled with excited stu- j
dents, who broke through a rain of
falling stones and plaster. The cries i
of the victims buried in the ruins J
were plainly audible. Axes and |
ropes were brought from the fire- j
house, and the injured were re
moved from the debris one by one.
In Roble Hall the floors fell j
through, and some of the girls were !
dropped down to the next floor, but i
fortunately no one was hurt.
The famous Memorial Church is 1
practically demolished; its tower was i
shaken down and many windows and I
mosaics were utterly ruined. The
new Library is an utter loss. The
new Gymnasium and the great Me
morial Arch are also terribly dam
aged. Along the outer quadrangle
many of the arches are down, and for
fully thirty yards on the south side !
of the outer quadrangle the entire |
structure is demolished.
The outlying buildings of the Uni- j
versity were nearly all severely !
shattered. The Stanford residence
was torn asunder, and Mrs. Stan- |
tfordte former chamber was splil
evenly in two. The brick winery
was also broken.
