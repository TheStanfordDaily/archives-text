## 
### 
Thai Dr. Hugo Eckcncr. famed German airship export and captain of
the Graf Zeppelin, had planned to fly to America on the ill-fated Hiuden
l>urg to join the Stanford celebration honoring Dr. William F. Durand
was revealed here last night.
Dr. Eckcncr had been scheduled to talk via long-distance telephone to

President Wilbur received this
telegram last week from Karl Arn
stein, vice-president of the Good
year Zeppelin Corporation in Ak
ron, Ohio:
"I cabled an-d wrote Doctor Ec
kener on behalf his taking part hon
oring Durand May seventh stop Not
impossible that Doctor Eckener may
be this country May sixth on Hin
denburg but fear he will return
same night on ship stop Please be
assured we will do all that's pos
sible to secure Doctor Eckener's
participation."
Even though Dr. Eckener did not
cross on the Hindenburg, alumni
officials hoped the noted Jightei - -
than-air specialist would call Dr.
Durand directly from Germany.
The disaster in Lakehurst, how
ever, removed all chance of Dr.
Eckener's call.
Meanwhile, on the campus here
Dr. Durand himself was last night
rewriting his speech on lighter
than-air transportation for delivery
at the dinner in his honor.
"The terrible tragedy threw new
light on much I had planned to
say," the professor emeritus told
The Daily at dinnertime. Dr. Du
rand intended to tell "inside" de
tails of the construction of the Hin
denburg.
Harry Guggenheim, famous fin
ancier of aeronautical research and
main speaker at tonight's banquet,
was also rewriting his speech on
"Safety in the Air" in light of the
Hindenburg explosion, as he flew
west last night from Chicago.
