# Crew Declines After Poughkeepsie Win
## 
### 
J Falling into a gradual decline
j after culminating in a win at
Poughkeepsie in 1916 that put Stan
ford on the national map athletical
ly, Indian crew lagged and sputtered
through 1918 and 1919, then conked
out altogether after a disastrous
j 1920 season.
In 1919 the crew tciMn had a diffi
j cult time to meet expenses—there
< was held a benefit dance in Encina
during February of that year in an
! effort to fill out a fund that had
been started earlier by a general
I canvassing of the campus for dona
tions.
The team members finally gath
j ered together enough money to open
| a training table at the Theta Xi
| house for two weeks prior to the
I three-race regatta with California
crew late in April, but apparently
the food wasn't so hot, because the
Bears wailoped Stanford in all three
of the contests.
The next year the financing of
the team became even harder, and
when the scullers finally got their
I outfits together they had to race
i California with chipped and cracked
oars and sadly patched boats. Need
| less to say, the Indian varsity, jun
j ior varsity, and freshman crews
■ once more took it on the chin from
j the Blue and Gold.
