EASY TO PICK.
VET NOBODY KNOWS
In that dope sheet the Daily is running today—it really is a marvelous
consensus—there are some remarkable things that don't come to light
Unless you read the individual sheets made out by the contributors.
For instance, everyone, without exception, agreed that Talley would
win the 100, Malott would win the 440. Alexander would win the mile,
Stanford would win the high hurdles, Wciershauser would win the lows,
Thurber would win the high jump, Zagar would win the discus, Reynolds
would win the shot, and that Meadows, Sefton, and Howe would sweep
the pole vault.
Not only did they agree that Alexander would win the mile, but that
Ned Jensen would run second and March would come in third. Just pic
ture that not a person ol' the group disagreeing on a single place in a
race. Many other second and third places were practically unanimous#

Crane in the 100, Malott in the 220,
Weiershauser in the 440, Mahurin in
the half, Portanova in the two-mil«
behind the virtually unanimous Bur
rows-for-first, Crane in the broad
jump, and Morrison in the high jump
are about two-thirds of the second
place choices which were almost per- j
fectly agreed upon.
Now, the purpose in bringing these
things out is to .show the extent of
agreement between a fairly wide range
of pickers (even though they are all
Stanford sympathizers), and still the
meet is as much up in the air as ever.
Such a situation means only one thing.

The meet will depend very, very largely upon the interchanging of sec-,
ond and third places, and the third and fourth places—just the minor
points, you see.
If some of the unknown Trojans come through, or if some of the un
known Indians come through, in only a few cases, it will mean the meet.
Such a situation gives Stanford an edge, and it might prove to be just
sufficient edge, too. This is a home meet for Stanford, and Dink can enter
practically every man he has, while Cromwell will have to have his men
do the best they can and won't be able to take a chance on having some
unknown come through. He brings only so many men up from Los An-,
geles, does Cromwell, and such a little thing as leaving home a couple of
men might mean a winning point.
REMEMRER WHEN WE
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE?
When you look back to about a month ago, the entire setup of this
meet tomorrow is amusing, not to say amazing. U.S.C. was supposed to have
the best collegiate track team in the country, and it has done nothing
meanwhile to lose any claim to that label. Stanford, on the other hand,
was still far behind, didn't have a ghost of a show against U.S.C. and
would have to work miracles to beat even the Bears.
The record of the team, from a mediocre outfit to national contender
in a series of seven-league leaps, is a monument to the coaching methods
of Dink Templeton, the best track coach this side of Kingdom come. And
that includes Lawson Robertson, Brutus Hamilton, Dean Cromwell, or
anybody else you want to name.
THEY'LL RE SHOOTING
FOR A NEW RECORD
If for no other reason, everybody on the campus ought to get to the
meet to watch Earle Meadows and Bill Sel'ton do some pole vaulting.
Here is a single track team with two of the three best pole vaulters in the
world as members, and those two might be trying for a new world record,
tomorrow, ;:t .something like 14 feet 8 or 9 inches.
This i.s good territory for Meadows, he likes the stadium pit and has
done some of his best vaulting here. Sefton, as the world record holder
unofficially, is at home in most anybody's old pit. The two of them
together will be worth anybody's time.

things out is to .show the extent of
agreement between a fairly wide range
of pickers (even though they are all
Stanford sympathizers), and still the
meet is as much up in the air as ever.
Such a situation means only one thing.

The meet will depend very, very largely upon the interchanging of sec-,
ond and third places, and the third and fourth places—just the minor
points, you see.
If some of the unknown Trojans come through, or if some of the un
known Indians come through, in only a few cases, it will mean the meet.
Such a situation gives Stanford an edge, and it might prove to be just
sufficient edge, too. This is a home meet for Stanford, and Dink can enter
practically every man he has, while Cromwell will have to have his men
do the best they can and won't be able to take a chance on having some
unknown come through. He brings only so many men up from Los An-,
geles, does Cromwell, and such a little thing as leaving home a couple of
men might mean a winning point.
REMEMRER WHEN WE
DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE?
When you look back to about a month ago, the entire setup of this
meet tomorrow is amusing, not to say amazing. U.S.C. was supposed to have
the best collegiate track team in the country, and it has done nothing
meanwhile to lose any claim to that label. Stanford, on the other hand,
was still far behind, didn't have a ghost of a show against U.S.C. and
would have to work miracles to beat even the Bears.
The record of the team, from a mediocre outfit to national contender
in a series of seven-league leaps, is a monument to the coaching methods
of Dink Templeton, the best track coach this side of Kingdom come. And
that includes Lawson Robertson, Brutus Hamilton, Dean Cromwell, or
anybody else you want to name.
THEY'LL RE SHOOTING
FOR A NEW RECORD
If for no other reason, everybody on the campus ought to get to the
meet to watch Earle Meadows and Bill Sel'ton do some pole vaulting.
Here is a single track team with two of the three best pole vaulters in the
world as members, and those two might be trying for a new world record,
tomorrow, ;:t .something like 14 feet 8 or 9 inches.
This i.s good territory for Meadows, he likes the stadium pit and has
done some of his best vaulting here. Sefton, as the world record holder
unofficially, is at home in most anybody's old pit. The two of them
together will be worth anybody's time.

BILL SEFTON
EASY TO PICK.
VET NOBODY KNOWS
In that dope sheet the Daily is running today—it really is a marvelous
consensus—there are some remarkable things that don't come to light
Unless you read the individual sheets made out by the contributors.
For instance, everyone, without exception, agreed that Talley would
win the 100, Malott would win the 440. Alexander would win the mile,
Stanford would win the high hurdles, Wciershauser would win the lows,
Thurber would win the high jump, Zagar would win the discus, Reynolds
would win the shot, and that Meadows, Sefton, and Howe would sweep
the pole vault.
Not only did they agree that Alexander would win the mile, but that
Ned Jensen would run second and March would come in third. Just pic
ture that not a person ol' the group disagreeing on a single place in a
race. Many other second and third places were practically unanimous#

Crane in the 100, Malott in the 220,
Weiershauser in the 440, Mahurin in
the half, Portanova in the two-mil«
behind the virtually unanimous Bur
rows-for-first, Crane in the broad
jump, and Morrison in the high jump
are about two-thirds of the second
place choices which were almost per- j
fectly agreed upon.
Now, the purpose in bringing these
things out is to .show the extent of
agreement between a fairly wide range
