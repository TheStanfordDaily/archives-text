# Riders To Play San Mateo Club
## Second â€“ Stringers Hold Inter-squad Games 
### 
Card second-string horsemen will
have to content themselves with an
intrasquad game this afternoon, as
their match with Menlo J. C. was
called off due to the Oaks' inability
to produce a team. However, the
first-string Indian squad will meel
the San Mateo Polo Club in a re
turn match Sunday at Beresford
Field near San Mateo at 2:30.
Sunday's game promises to be a
close one with both teams particu
larly anxious for a win. Last au
tumn quarter, when the Cards met
the peninsula club, they were de
feated 12-10. In a recent return
match the Indians turned the tables
for a 9-8 win, so Sunday's match
will be a decisive one in this series.
Next Wednesday Captain Grubbs'
first-string horsemen will leave for
Utah, where they will meet the
powerful University of Utah squad
in a two-game series Thursday and
Friday.
