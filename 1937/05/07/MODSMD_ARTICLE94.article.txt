# The 						Really Big Things
## 
### 
THE death-rattle of a giant sounded over Lake
hurst yesterday, the air trembled for an eter
nal instant and the Graf Hindenburg crashed
to earth.
It was a big noise, it went along with a great
sight—a spectacle that arrested the nation.
When we heard the news we stopped our
ears to the really great noises in the world.
Those noises were being made on this campus,
and at universities like it throughout the coun
try. We could have heard them as we passed
the open windows of laboratories—the intense
hum of a motor, the drone of a professor's voice,
the murmur of students, the whisper of a wind
tunnel.
Along with those noises are the greatest
sights in the world—not a national disaster, but
a professor's hand, making notes as he watches
the action of his laboratory instruments —a col
umn of mercury bobbing inside a tube, a minia
ture airship sv/inging on a wire in an artificial
hurricane.
These are greater sights and sounds because
they are the amplifying tubes of human knowl
edge, taking the faint impulses of fact and mag
nifying and synthesizing them into scientific
realities.
One of those realities was the Hindenburg as
it sailed the skies. But greater was the Hinden
burg as it lay on blue-print paper. Much more
a triumph was the set of formulae that made the
ship possible than the ship itself, a gargantuan
impact on our senses.
What has been lost in the Lakehurst disaster
is just the physical copy of those formulae. The
proved premises of airship designing are still
undestroyed. And out of the Hindenburg will
come the corollaries of those formulae that will
assure another conquest of the air, next time
perhaps a more permanent one.
The new ship, like the old one, will not just
take to the air. It will be built out of laboratory
tested facts, by the quiet men who make notes
while toy airships buck artificial breezes.
