WHEN the B.A.C. ticket window dropped
yesterday afternoon and sale of U.S.C.-
Stanford track meet tickets officially ended,
only about 500 enthusiasts had remembered t$
make their weekly trek down the line.
Which means that more than one prospective
rooter will either pay $1.10 Saturday afternoon
for general admission, or "see" the meet the
radio way, unless the B.A.C.'s last minute loop
hole is patronized.
The loophole is this. If enough prospective
ticket purchasers bang on the B.A.C. window
enough and scream loud enough today, the
rooters' window will open, and rooters' seats
will go back on sale at the student prices.
This action, however, is hardly as liberal a
concession to students as the disappointed
ticket purchaser might believe, for the B.A.C.
coffers still get the money and the rooter still
pays it. But for those who forgot their weekly
trek it may be good news to be able to pay
the money—less money.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters explains this
reason for the troublesome advance sale sys
tem. In order to carry on a consistent policy
through football, basketball, and track season,
he believes it necessary to hold all rooters'
sales during the week prior to the event and
thus build a definite "advance sale habit" in the
student rooter mind.
This policy appears to be built on a false
premise. Basketball and football crowds differ
from track crowds. Obviously rooters' sales for
the two former sports must be held during the
week previous so that all remaining seats can
be put on general sale.
But track affairs never are sellouts as are foot
ball or basketball games, and there is no reason
to expect students to make the B.A.C. trek when
seats are actually not at a premium, and espe
cially when there is no need to know in ad
vance what will be left for general sale. The
83,000-ceat wind tunnel will handle most any
track crowd with ease.
Because the B.A.C. should sell every ticket
it can. Because rooters should not be denied
special rates when there are plenty of seats.
Because the "weekly trek" should not be re
quired except when absolutely necessary, the
advance sale of rooter's tickets should here
after depend upon the event, the inierest, and
the size of stadium.—G. F.

thus build a definite "advance sale habit" in the
student rooter mind.
This policy appears to be built on a false
premise. Basketball and football crowds differ
from track crowds. Obviously rooters' sales for
the two former sports must be held during the
week previous so that all remaining seats can
be put on general sale.
But track affairs never are sellouts as are foot
ball or basketball games, and there is no reason
to expect students to make the B.A.C. trek when
seats are actually not at a premium, and espe
cially when there is no need to know in ad
vance what will be left for general sale. The
83,000-ceat wind tunnel will handle most any
track crowd with ease.
Because the B.A.C. should sell every ticket
it can. Because rooters should not be denied
special rates when there are plenty of seats.
Because the "weekly trek" should not be re
quired except when absolutely necessary, the
advance sale of rooter's tickets should here
after depend upon the event, the inierest, and
the size of stadium.—G. F.
WHEN the B.A.C. ticket window dropped
yesterday afternoon and sale of U.S.C.-
Stanford track meet tickets officially ended,
only about 500 enthusiasts had remembered t$
make their weekly trek down the line.
Which means that more than one prospective
rooter will either pay $1.10 Saturday afternoon
for general admission, or "see" the meet the
radio way, unless the B.A.C.'s last minute loop
hole is patronized.
The loophole is this. If enough prospective
ticket purchasers bang on the B.A.C. window
enough and scream loud enough today, the
rooters' window will open, and rooters' seats
will go back on sale at the student prices.
This action, however, is hardly as liberal a
concession to students as the disappointed
ticket purchaser might believe, for the B.A.C.
coffers still get the money and the rooter still
pays it. But for those who forgot their weekly
trek it may be good news to be able to pay
the money—less money.
Graduate Manager A1 Masters explains this
reason for the troublesome advance sale sys
tem. In order to carry on a consistent policy
through football, basketball, and track season,
he believes it necessary to hold all rooters'
sales during the week prior to the event and
thus build a definite "advance sale habit" in the
student rooter mind.
