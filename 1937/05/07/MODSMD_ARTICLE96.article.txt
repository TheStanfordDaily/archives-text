# More Wet-Nurses

THOUGH social psychologists contend that
"trial-and-error" adjustments are usually the
most satisfactory, experience at Stanford with
new students has long proved that in itself, trial
and-eror learning is hardly adequate.
Student leaders and the Administration real
ized this last yeai when they established the

pre-registratiori period tor freshmen. Arriving a
week earlier than the rest of the campus, first
year men and women —really high-school boys
and girls—were shown a few of the ropes, were
given a head start on adjusting to Stanford in
particular and college in general.
This short training period—in which upper
classmen explained the Honor Code, study hab
its, campus customs and such—could obviously
not take the place of the freshmen's own ex
perience. But experience can more or less be
directed into the "proper" channels. Anyway,
the Class of '40 was fairly ably wet-nursed and
diapers are already being powdered for the
Class of '41.
Junior transfers are another thing again. They
are, presumably, grown up. They've been to
college, learned college study habits and social
patterns. Their adjustment, therefore, is sim
pler than the freshmen's—only Stanford is new.
But their orientation to even that little has been
grossly neglected.
At its last session Ex Committee admitted it
had a problem in junior transfers. President
Reynolds gave three capable student leaders
the job of bringing next fall's crop of transfers
into the fold with the least amount of stress and
strain. The Farm has finally awakened to the
fact that even at Stanford, strangers can't just
find themselves. —D. B.
