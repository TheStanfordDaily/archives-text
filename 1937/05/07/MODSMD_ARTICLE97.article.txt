# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
night before last Stanford's Glee Team stood
before one body of supporters who were interested
in the songs if they couldn't sec what they were be
cause the lights never came on during the performance.
In between sections of the program, the curtain
on the stage was closed to allow the struggling song
sters breathing spells. On one occasion, the curtain
had difficulty in closing. Men toiled and tugged. The
curtain swirled. One tremendous burst of energy
closed them with a bang, at the same time disturbing
a bat family which has long resided in the ceiling of
the Assembly Hall. The bats camc out of their battery
and flew around in the spotlight awhile. When the
singing started again, they were lulled to rest and
again retired to their hideaway.
A LIMITED group of brothers at another tong, fired
by the will to build and built up with liquid fire,
decided that their house was beginning to look shabby,
particularly around the doors, internally and exter
nally.
Buoyed up by processes of wistful and then whish
ful thinking, they told their confreres that they were
donating new doors throughout. This made the breres
(as in Brerc Rabbit) happy.
JU-81-LA-TE!
ju-bi-la-te
JU-81-LA-TE!
A-AMEN.
They became so stimulated with the idea that they
removed all the doors and broke them to bits.
As the night waned, and the dav/n dawned, it
gradually dawned on the generous donors that they
had donated no money for the doors, and that, in fact,
Ihey had no money at all. Again inspired, they bor
rowed a few doors from the neighbors and fitted them
as best they could. More than one brother could look
through his door and see, like Coleridge's Ancient
Mariner,
"rhe homed moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip."

\ NOTHER undergraduate," not a row man, but defi
nitely a devotee of the grape, lived down the
camino a picce last quarter. There, transportation diffi
culties beset him and he was forced to move over by
the Bayshore, not far from University Avenue. There
he finds himself within easy walking distance.
000 you walk down the first block there,
Your head goes round and round,
And it comes out Beer! (At Mora's)
000 you trot down two more blocks,
You round the next corner,
And it comes out Beer! (At Auten's)

curtain swirled. One tremendous burst of energy
closed them with a bang, at the same time disturbing
a bat family which has long resided in the ceiling of
the Assembly Hall. The bats camc out of their battery
and flew around in the spotlight awhile. When the
singing started again, they were lulled to rest and
again retired to their hideaway.
A LIMITED group of brothers at another tong, fired
by the will to build and built up with liquid fire,
decided that their house was beginning to look shabby,
particularly around the doors, internally and exter
nally.
Buoyed up by processes of wistful and then whish
ful thinking, they told their confreres that they were
donating new doors throughout. This made the breres
(as in Brerc Rabbit) happy.
JU-81-LA-TE!

JU-81-LA-TE!
A-AMEN.
They became so stimulated with the idea that they
removed all the doors and broke them to bits.
As the night waned, and the dav/n dawned, it
gradually dawned on the generous donors that they
had donated no money for the doors, and that, in fact,
Ihey had no money at all. Again inspired, they bor
rowed a few doors from the neighbors and fitted them
as best they could. More than one brother could look
through his door and see, like Coleridge's Ancient
Mariner,
"rhe homed moon, with one bright star
Within the nether tip."

night before last Stanford's Glee Team stood
before one body of supporters who were interested
in the songs if they couldn't sec what they were be
cause the lights never came on during the performance.
In between sections of the program, the curtain
on the stage was closed to allow the struggling song
sters breathing spells. On one occasion, the curtain
had difficulty in closing. Men toiled and tugged. The
curtain swirled. One tremendous burst of energy
closed them with a bang, at the same time disturbing
