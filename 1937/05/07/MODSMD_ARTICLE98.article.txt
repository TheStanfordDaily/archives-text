THE GOOD OLD DAYS
r pHIS morning the third page of the Daily laughs at
the old adage, "There's nothing staler than old
news" and prints five columns full of it. I imagine
these five columns will be more widely read than
any other issue of this volume.
For a short while yesterday afternoon, I too had
the fever to print, old stuff, so I got out all" the old
files of the Daily and looked to see what other Bull
Sessioncrs had torn their hair about. The magic words
of Steve O'Donnell sounded very much like the dulcet
tones of Bob Eisenbach. Mellinkoff wrote about En
cina food too, Brother Cobbs. And, Brother Harper,
you might just as well have not written anything.
You haven't had an original idea since September
30, 1!)2G.

Funny thing: the way they all shouted about the
same things we shout about today. They blasphemed
the chapel, the freshmen, the women, the honor sys
tem, the library, the art gallery, the red tape in the
Ad Building, censorship of publications, and the
people in Paly.
We sit here today at our typewriters and think we
arc beitrj very original. Poor Dr. Wilbur. I pity him.
The composite picture of a Daily writer must be a
pretty drab portrait.

But like all things of other days, around all I hi::
stUiT we've written tVeso hangs a certain aura, a halo,
that no hand can brush away. We can't see the future
any part of it, so we never really worry very much
about it.
The present is terribly clear. We worry about it
constantly. But the past is different.
The present is now past, but the worrying we did
while it was the present has so deeply ingrained it on
our memories, we can't forget.

We look back and think about all the hell we went
through and then laugh like fiends. It's a funny thing
but nearly any remembrance of things past is closely
coupled with the troubles we've been through. Wc
rarely think of the happier times.
Things usually turn out all right in the end. As a
result wc are tempted to say, "Everything that happens,
happens for the best." Memories are realities only after
they are all over with. To quote an old saying, "It';
just like hitting yourself on the head with a hammer.
You feel so good when you quit."
I wish I could remember the name of that blonde
from Ithaca.
