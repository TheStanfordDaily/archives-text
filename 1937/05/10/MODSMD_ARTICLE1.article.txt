# Wilbur Veto Kills Pre-Reg Activity Plan
## President Believes Cost, Insufficient Interest Would Cause Failure 
### W. A. MILLIS 
Cancellation of the annual pre
registration orientation period for
freshmen, tried for the first time im
mediately prior to the beginning of
school last autumn quarter, was an
nounced yesterday by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur.
An estimated expense of from
$2000 to $4000 to the University,
coupled with small attendance and
lack of student interest, were given
by Dr. Wilbur as the reasons for his
action.
Redrafting Necessary
Dr. Wilbur's decision came after
Ex Committee, on April 20, had
drawn up plans and had appro
priated $100 for the pre-registration
period next full. A.S.S.U. President
Jim Reynolds said yesterday after
noon that Wilbur's deciison will ne
cessitate a complete redrafting of
these plans.
In explaining his decision, Dr.
Wilbur stated that it was based upon
a consideration of the heavy cost to
the University involved, and upon
the report of the student committee
headed by Chick Franich which
managed last year's pre-registration
period. The report of this commit
tee, Dr. Wilbur said, emphasized
the relative lack of student interest
in the project.
Plan New Program
The increased cost to the Univer
sity, the President added, came
mainly from the earlier opening of
Roble and Encina halls and dining
rooms, which opened on Friday in
stead of Sunday preceding registra
tion. In Dr. Wilbur's opinion, the
linancial cost of the program was not
justified by what was accomplished.
Several features of the program,
including the barbecue, the Honor
Code discussions, and the Matricu
lation Service in the Chapel, should
be continued, Dr. Wilbur said.
Proposed by Roth
On this point, Jim Reynolds said
that Ex Committee this week will
probably discuss plans for "a defi
nite organization for the orientation
of freshman and junior transfers
after school begins."
Original proposals for the pre
registration period came from Al
mon E. Roth, recently retired Uni
versity Comptroller, at a panel dis
cussion on the Honor Code last
spring quarter. The A.S.S.U. and
Cardinals sponsored the program
last fall.
George Ditz, who has been direct
ing the committee drawing up plans
for next fall's program, was in
Stockton last night, and could not
be reached for comment upon Dr.
Wilbur's decision.
