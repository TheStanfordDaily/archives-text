Will preside tonight at the sec
ond meeting of the Student Lead
ership Institute.
S. U. President Jim Reynolds asking
all student leaders to be present,
but he announced that all who are
interested will be welcome. It is es
pecially important that men and
women sponsors, presidents of fra
ternities, sororities, and halls, and
other organization heads attend.
Gretchen Reinemund, chairman
of the Institute planning committee,
consisting of Dorothy Twelves, Bar
bara Paine, Virginia Sterry, Mary
Vraig, Winnie Jean Smith, and Mrs.
Leona Diekema, asks that both (his
year's and next year's officers be
present.
Purpose of the Institute, as out
lined by Barbara Kimball in last
Thursday's meeting is "to give stu
dent leaders a scale of democratic
values by which they can measure
worth of their activities.
In line with this policy, Professor
Hand named more than 20 points
which he considered should be part
of the fundamental standard for
each activity. He emphasized that
students should learn to:
1. Work co-operatively for the
common good.
2. Lead without dominating.
3. Be tolerant of opposing points
of view.
4. Bring about maximum pos
sible equality of opportunity.
5. Criticize intelligently.

!(. Lead without dominating.
I 10. Govern themselves wisely.
! Dr. Hand's principal postulate is |
' that efficiency in getting work done j
I is not alone sufficient justification
for maintaining any student activity.
! "The activity," he says, "must be ,
educative to be worthwhile."
"There are three basic considera- \
tions," he continued, "which should i
be learned from participation in '
'extra-curricular' articities. Most |
important of these are the essential |
and basic values of democracy, but j
principles of mental hygiene and of
sound physical health are also es
-1 sential."

S. U. President Jim Reynolds asking
all student leaders to be present,

bara Paine, Virginia Sterry, Mary

year's and next year's officers be
present.
Purpose of the Institute, as out
lined by Barbara Kimball in last
Thursday's meeting is "to give stu
dent leaders a scale of democratic
values by which they can measure
worth of their activities.
In line with this policy, Professor
Hand named more than 20 points
which he considered should be part
of the fundamental standard for
each activity. He emphasized that
students should learn to:
1. Work co-operatively for the
common good.
2. Lead without dominating.
3. Be tolerant of opposing points
of view.
4. Bring about maximum pos
sible equality of opportunity.
5. Criticize intelligently.
6. Establish self-imposed type of

law and order.
7. Differ peaceably.
8. Use freedom intelligently.
!(. Lead without dominating.
I 10. Govern themselves wisely.
! Dr. Hand's principal postulate is |
' that efficiency in getting work done j
I is not alone sufficient justification
for maintaining any student activity.
! "The activity," he says, "must be ,
educative to be worthwhile."
"There are three basic considera- \
tions," he continued, "which should i
be learned from participation in '
'extra-curricular' articities. Most |
important of these are the essential |
and basic values of democracy, but j
principles of mental hygiene and of
sound physical health are also es
-1 sential."
"Effective Techniques for Stu
dent Activities" will be the theme for
! the second meeting of the Student
Leadership Institute tonight at 8
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse.
