# Trueblood Urges Blueprints for Life
## 
### 
Dr. Trueblood spoke on the im
portance of blueprints at yester
day's service in the Memorial
Church.
"When a house is built, it is the
tendency to throw the blue-prints
away, but often the blueprints are
more important and lasting than the
house," said the chaplain. Follow
ing this theme he used as examples
Ezekiel and his plan for a temple
which was destroyed, later rebuilt,
destroyed again.
