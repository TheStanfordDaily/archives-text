# Photos Lighten Invalid's Pain

Daily Lensman Tro Harper
brought light yesterday â€” not
through a shutter to a piece of
film, but through the halls of
Palo Alto Hospital to a heart.
At 9:30 a.m. Harper received
an undeveloped roll of pictures
from Deputy Sheriff Fred
Frehe. At 11:30 Mel Frehe, his
son, for a moment forgot that
he was critically ill with a
blood infection. In his hand
were finished prints of his pet
horse, with her two-day-old
colt.
A graduate of Menlo Junior
College, Frehe contracted pneu
monia while working as a Hol
lywood stunt man. Develop
ment of the blood-stream infec
tion makes death a daily pos
sibility and has so far neces
sitated six transfusions, ac
cording to his physician, Dr.
Milton Saier.
