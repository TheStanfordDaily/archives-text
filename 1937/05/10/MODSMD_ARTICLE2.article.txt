Lutz, dean of the School of Grad

at Stanford, will speak on France in
the Little Theater at 7:30 tomorrow

Last week the first lecture, given

information concerning traveling
and preparing to travel in Europe
in general. Dr. Lutz will talk on
spots in France which would be par
ticularly interesting to the student

as well as some of the political

time.
Spain has an area more than
twice that of Great Britain.
