•ihauser, Stanford hope in the low
barrier event who had already sur
passed ail predictions by taking a
second in the century and first in
the 220, hit the second hurdle and
sent it far down the track. This
slowed him up and sent Trojans
Vickery and LaFond on to win 8
points and the track meet.
Record Falls
Bill Selton and Earle Meadows of
U.S.C. again broke the world pole
vault record; this time each surpass
ed Sefton's former unofficial mark
by an inch in leaping 14 feet BV2
inches. The seeming ease with
which both men vaulted higher than
has ever before been done was but
slightly noticed by the crowd of
10,000, which was worked to a fever
pitch over the low hurdles, being
run concurrently.
Bob Alexander was the high
point man of the day, taking both
mile and two-mile runs. His time
of 4:20 fiat in the mile set another
meet record, the old one being
4:23.2, held by Chuck Nimmo of
Stanford and Cliff Halstead of U.S.C.
Thurber Wins
Only other mark to fall during the
day was the high jump, in which
Delos Thurber leaped 6 feet 7 inches
to better Bob King's former mark of
0-6%.
Upsets were few, and wind on the
short-race straight-away hampered
most times. Weiershauser's beating
the Trojan sprint aces was a sur
prise, as was the failure of Burrows
in the two-mile.
Stanford won six first places,
U.S.C. eight; Stanford won all fiat
races from 220 yards up and swept
the shot put, while Troy swept the
javelin. Reynolds threw his best of
the season, 50-6 : % as did Zagar at
158- Vis.
Relay Slips
The Stanford relay team, which
was supposed to be a cinch, was de
feated when Gordy Hyde, the first
man, cramped a muscle, leaving a
30-yard debit. Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, in a Herculean try nearly
made it all up on the last lap, but it
wasn't to be had. McCurdy was sec
ond best for Stanford, along with
Weiershauser, taking a first and a
second.
Next Saturday Stanford will take
another try at U.S.C., in the annual
Fresno Relays.

Record Falls
Bill Selton and Earle Meadows of
U.S.C. again broke the world pole
vault record; this time each surpass
ed Sefton's former unofficial mark
by an inch in leaping 14 feet BV2
inches. The seeming ease with
which both men vaulted higher than
has ever before been done was but
slightly noticed by the crowd of
10,000, which was worked to a fever
pitch over the low hurdles, being
run concurrently.
Bob Alexander was the high
point man of the day, taking both
mile and two-mile runs. His time
of 4:20 fiat in the mile set another
meet record, the old one being
4:23.2, held by Chuck Nimmo of
Stanford and Cliff Halstead of U.S.C.
Thurber Wins
Only other mark to fall during the
day was the high jump, in which
Delos Thurber leaped 6 feet 7 inches
to better Bob King's former mark of
0-6%.
Upsets were few, and wind on the
short-race straight-away hampered
most times. Weiershauser's beating
the Trojan sprint aces was a sur
prise, as was the failure of Burrows
in the two-mile.
Stanford won six first places,
U.S.C. eight; Stanford won all fiat
races from 220 yards up and swept
the shot put, while Troy swept the
javelin. Reynolds threw his best of
the season, 50-6 : % as did Zagar at
158- Vis.
Relay Slips
The Stanford relay team, which
was supposed to be a cinch, was de
feated when Gordy Hyde, the first
man, cramped a muscle, leaving a
30-yard debit. Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, in a Herculean try nearly
made it all up on the last lap, but it
wasn't to be had. McCurdy was sec
ond best for Stanford, along with
Weiershauser, taking a first and a

The Stanford relay team, which
was supposed to be a cinch, was de
feated when Gordy Hyde, the first
man, cramped a muscle, leaving a
30-yard debit. Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, in a Herculean try nearly
made it all up on the last lap, but it
wasn't to be had. McCurdy was sec
ond best for Stanford, along with
Weiershauser, taking a first and a
second.
Next Saturday Stanford will take
another try at U.S.C., in the annual
Fresno Relays.

Vickery and LaFond on to win 8
points and the track meet.
Record Falls
Bill Selton and Earle Meadows of
U.S.C. again broke the world pole
vault record; this time each surpass
ed Sefton's former unofficial mark
by an inch in leaping 14 feet BV2
inches. The seeming ease with
which both men vaulted higher than
has ever before been done was but
slightly noticed by the crowd of
10,000, which was worked to a fever
pitch over the low hurdles, being
run concurrently.
Bob Alexander was the high
point man of the day, taking both
mile and two-mile runs. His time
of 4:20 fiat in the mile set another
meet record, the old one being
4:23.2, held by Chuck Nimmo of
Stanford and Cliff Halstead of U.S.C.
Thurber Wins
Only other mark to fall during the
day was the high jump, in which
Delos Thurber leaped 6 feet 7 inches
to better Bob King's former mark of
0-6%.
Upsets were few, and wind on the
short-race straight-away hampered
most times. Weiershauser's beating
the Trojan sprint aces was a sur
prise, as was the failure of Burrows
in the two-mile.
Stanford won six first places,
U.S.C. eight; Stanford won all fiat
races from 220 yards up and swept
the shot put, while Troy swept the
javelin. Reynolds threw his best of
the season, 50-6 : % as did Zagar at
158- Vis.
