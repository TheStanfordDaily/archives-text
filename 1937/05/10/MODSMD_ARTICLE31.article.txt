THEY ALL
WERE GREAT
A Stanford sportwriter could rave
for hours on (he heart, the spirit,
the old that's-why-we-love-Stanford
fight of every kid that ran for Tem
pleton Saturday. Each one of that
gang that got out there and pitched
with .all they owned, and not for
naught either until the last two
events, ought to get a mention some
place. Such mention would take too
much space here, so that's why Slants
is going to say nothing about any
individual and leave out others who
tried just as hard, and who were
worth just as much, if not in points
then in spirit.
We'll let it go at that—those who
saw the track meet know who de
served individual glory, if any.
Those who didn't missed the finest
track meet they will ever have a
chance to see, from point of compe
tition, but they will hear about the
kids that outdid themselves.
THESE WEREN'T
TO BAD. EITHER
Aparf from the Meadows-Soflon
duo, which has reached the inexpres
sible stage, U.S.C. had a couple of
good boys, too. One was Roulac, the
half-miler who went to the greatest
limits any man can be expected to
reach in effort, only to be beaten
out for second by a greater runner.
He didn't have an ounce left at the
finish, and if Cromwell had any
kick about that one—
Don't think that Olson in the 440,
Jensen in the mile, Yates in the two
mile, and a few more of the Trojans
didn't try, either. They were beaten
by better men, but they made races
of all of them.
