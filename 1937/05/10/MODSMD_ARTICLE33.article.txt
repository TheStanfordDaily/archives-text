NEW YORK. May 9 (U.R).â€”Dizzy
Dean scored his fifth consecutive
victory of the season today, pitching
the St. Louis Cardinals to a 7-1
victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Dean kept nine hits scattered, and
let up for only a moment in the ninth
when two consecutive doubles sent
the only Brooklyn run across.
