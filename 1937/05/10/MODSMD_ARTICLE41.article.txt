IN the old days airplanes flew blind. Once
they became enveloped in fog they were lost.
Then came powerful wireless sets to guide them
through sleet and snow almost as safely as
through sunshine and stars.
Ex Committee, like these early planes, is fly
ing blind. Every Tuesday night it takes off in
strumentless into the legislative stratosphere.
Which way it will go depends not upon its
actual destination on the ground below but upon
its theoretical destination in the minds of its
members.
Stanford's student executives are chosen
by their fellows, for the most part have their
fellows' interests at heart. But the trouble lies
in their minds, not their hearts. Ex Committee
members write the A.S.S.U.'s laws by what
they think the student body wants rather than
by what the student body really wants.
Last week, however, education professor Har
old Hand and Dean Mary Yost began wiring up
a massive sounding board which may in the
future enable A.S.S.U. executives to determine
accurately their constituents' desires and needs.
This new instrument is the Leadership Institute.
Established to train next year's officers, the
Leadership Institute undertook in its initial ses
sion to define and analyze such abstractions of
student government as Democracy, Efficiency,
Exploitation. Some 150 of the campus' most
activity-minded students mulled over the prob
lems of The Daily, Cardinals, and Ex Committee.
Tonight the second meeting will send a few
more currents through the sounding board.
More meetings will mean more opinions upon
more matters of campus concern. This Lead
ership Institute, we hope, will become the in
strument to end blind flying—a powerful re
ceiving set with which Ex Committee can pick
up the actual voice of "the people."—D. B.
