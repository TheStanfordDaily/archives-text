WHEN The Daily bantered about Angell
Field bleachers last week, we thought
there was enough interest to justify the protru
sion of a chin into the matter.
We viewed with alarm a felt need, thought
we had the facts, and we said them.
We were wrong because we should have said
them today—not last week, but today, Monday,
the Monday after a very unfortunate U.S.C.
meet.
For today, much more could havfe been said.
Today, instead of merely pointing with tanta
mount editorial alarm at the "best track in the
world"—Angell Field without bleachers—and
"the windiest in the world," the Stadium—with
bleachers—much more could be said.
Rather than ballyhoo Dink Templeton's caus
tic comment, "best track in the world and no
place to sit down," and pound the editorial chest
between suggestions of "borrow the money"
and "pass the Branner payment," we should
have stood silent.
Instead of condemning the wind tunnel in
abstractions last week, we could today quote
runners who "thought they'd take off when
they hit that seven-mile wind on the straight
away."
There would be mention of a 10.1 time in the
100-yard dash which easily should have been
9.8 without wind; a 220 in 22.4 which might
have been 21.4, and so on.
We might have told about the breeze that
funneled down the straightaway at a velocity
sufficient to have disallowed records, had any
been miraculously achieved.
All this would substantiate our premature
cry for bleachers on Angell Field, the need for
which will undoubtedly be seen by B.A.C. mem
bers who meet Thursday night.—G. F.
