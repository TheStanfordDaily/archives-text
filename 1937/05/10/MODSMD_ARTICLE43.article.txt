\1 ATERNITY WARD OF THE LELAND STANFORD
lTI JR. MEMORIAL MEN'S REST HOME. LOOK
ING EASTWARD TO THE SEA—(Heck yes).—May 9.
— For years now. I've watched with envy the other
columnists in The Daily who could dateline their col
umns from Rest Home and Hospitals and Larkspur
under the pretense that they were sick.
However, until today. I always had to attain my
prose rhythm on the Underwood Elliott Fisher and
Remington Ream hop. skip, and jump principle in that
tropical paradise. The Daily Shack.
It's not that I've been big and strong and healthy all
these years, but just that my body never gets sick ex
cept during vacations or around finals time, when The
Daily doesn't publish or punish.
Well, my golden opportunity came last week when
I had a History of Journalism mid-term. My body just
made a mistake, that's all. It thought it was vacation
again.
I IFE here at the Rest Home is just like in Grand
Hotel—people come and people go but you have
to walk up the stairs, because of the strike while it is
hot. We have three meals a day, and thermometers

and nourishments from the hand of a Nubian slave at
10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Most of us have room-mates
just like other boys and they put Our Hasher in the
same room as the dumb-waiter.
I was having sinapisms fore and aft (mustard plas
ters, you dope) every morning. But 1 put a stop to
that by sneaking out and getting sunburned about the
chest Saturday afternoon when the Rest Home ad
journed to the track meet. All they can do to me now
is to inflict drops in my nose. But I think I've got 'em
fooled again. I'm positive that my nose is slowly
turning to stone.
|VO, I did not go to the Sema Nu Kid Party. Life
may have gone to a party at the Sigma Nude
House, but it began here in the Maternity Ward. I've
just had twins. The name of the father is Simmons
and the doctor says I must have been frightened by
the sight of a bed. Lots of people are, they say.
The case history behind my not going to the Sigma
Nu Kid Party is one of the darkest perfidy and in
trigue occasionally crossed by the slimy track of the
foul fiend himself.
The indisputable fact of the matter is that I got an
attack of bronchitis somewhere between the Stanford
Convalescent Home and the Harris J. Ryan High Volt
age Lab last week-end. (But I never would have
realized it, if it weren't for my midterm Wednesday.)
By Thursday evening I was running a temperature,
and the temperature well in the lead. So I called up
my date at 10:30 that night.
"Hello," I said.
And she said: "Oh, so you got bronchitis, eh?"
And I said, "Yes."
"Well, that means you're not going with me to the
kid party."
"Yes."
"Well, why didn't you phone sooner? Three men
have phoned since 7 o'clock trying to date me for the
party. Two of them weren't so good, but the third one
was cute and I've been waiting for him to ask me
out all quarter. Well, why didn't you phone?"
"I was sick," I said.
"Well, you're sick now, aren't you?"
•fSicker," I said.
"Well?"
"You're never in any earlier."
"When do you think I eat?"
"I didn't think people would be asking you out as
late as this."
"Oh, so you think only one guy ever asks me out
to a dance, huh?"
"My room-mate will take you," I said.
"We'll see about that," she replied.
niy room-mate had a lot of studying to do
that night, and he was taking a Pi Phi out Satur
day night, and he never was very strong at best, and he
didn't have any money, but I finally underwrote him
with a sight draft for a breakage fee of a nominal sum,
and because of his friendship for me, he called her up
at 7 o'clock Friday night and the deal was closed.
The first thing I heard Saturday morning was that
my room-mate wandered into the house drunk early
that morning. This was later denied.
So I called up my alleged date for a Rest Home
Bulletin.
"Oh, your room-mate is a wonderful date," she
said. "He isn't at all the tool you said he was. We had
a swell time."
"What happened after the dance?"
"Oh, we cruised down to Andre's and got some
cheese and crackers and a bottle of Mumm's 1928."
"What, pray tell, is 'Mumm's 1928'?"
"Why, that's champagne. Haven't you ever had
any?"
"No."
"Really, it's keen, and I had the best time." Hon
estly, you've got the nicest room-mate."
"0.K.," I said, "you can't fire me. I quit."
So I'm all over the bronchitis now, and am under
observation as a mental case. The Nubian slaves just
can't understand why I seem to repeat: "I'll never,
never, as long as I live in my whole life ever again
fall in love with a gal who has bronchitis."
Move over, Napoleon, you get in my hair.
