NOT HERE, THANK THE LORD
¥N most colleges the alumni association insists on
juliing stroke oar for the administration and faculty.
They put up the money for priming the pump of the
waters of truth, and as reward demand controlling
interest in the university. It is a cause for general
thanksgiving that Stanford alumni give us credit for
the intelligence to manage our own affairs properly,
and don't try to run the Farm themselves.
When some alumni associations meet, there is gen
eral unhappiness and disturbance among the faculty.
Deans, who can dissolve the most calloused student
with a glance, develop haggard expressions. Professors
who have intimated that perhaps Roosevelt is not the
reincarnation of Lenin, toss fitfully at night and jump
if spoken to abruptly. Football coaches slink about the
campus for a last look.

But no such blight descends upon the Farm. Alumni
have just concluded a Mothers' Day visit with their
intellectual step-parent, and there have been no nerv
ous breakdowns among the faculty. Professors sleep
as peacefully as econ students. Deans would thrill a
life insurance agent.
It is this non-intervention policy of alumni that
makes it possible for Stanford to be a "University of
high degree" in fact as well as in President s reports.
Few things can stifle a university quicker than med
dling alumni. When the faculty is forced to echo the
graduates, the college becomes merely an amplifier for
entrenched opinion. The professors have as much
change of expounding a new idea as a dog with a tal
low leg has of catching an asbestos cat in hell.

r necessity of currying favor with alumni has
prevented many American colleges from offering
any real education. This has been particularly true in
depression years, when the well known wolf staged a
sit-down strike on many a marble doorstep.
When the word got around that some member of
the almost extinct millionaire spccies was about to
transfer operations to the Heavenly stock exchange,
professors actcd like small boys just before Christmas.
The consensus of faculty opinion was that if you had
to let of! steam, blow up the orphans' home, or stab
your grandmother—do anything but make nasty re
marks about capitalism.
It seems that whenever alumni undertake to dic
tate policies to their college, they make it impossible to
give real education. Graduates who arc able to feed
the kitty for alma mater are naturally pretty well sat
isfied with conditions under which they have made
their stake. Therefore, they want their college to be
a shrine to the god of things as they are. Criticism of
the status quo is sinful.

Moreover, the old grads want to see their athletic
squads sweep the earth. Misguided alumni pressure
has been largely responsible for commercialized foot
ball. and for the hiuh mortality rate among coaches.
The laissez-faire policy of Stanford alumni makes it
possible for us to think and act as we wish. In this
we are blessed far beyond most,
