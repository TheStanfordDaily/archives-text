## 
### 
STANFORD THEATER
Wake Up and Li ve is good fun all
the way round. Walter Winchell and
Ben Bernie have a bunch of good
gags which they use to best advan
tage, and the situation (some call it
a plot) is right for this movie-radio
variety show.
The music is what you've been
hearing all over the air and there
are a couple of gentlemen who dance
like fiends. Ned Sparks and Patsy
Kelly do their various specialties to
help things along.
Jack Haley and Alice Faye are the
young people involved. Haley be
comes by accident the "phantom
troubador" who haunts Bernie's
broadcast and the resulting picture
is all about trying to find out who
he is. Bernie and Winchell are neck
and neck in the chase with Winchell
winning by a nose. And Haley wins
Alice Faye (first prize) and the au
dience wins all around.
For a bank night special in case
you don't win you get a Donald
Duck which is right up to standard.
