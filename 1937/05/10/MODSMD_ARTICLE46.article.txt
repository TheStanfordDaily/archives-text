### Clipped by JAMES STONE 
AS WK MENTIONED briefly a
week or so ago, Sidney Kingsley's j
"Dead End" is coming to the Curran 1
Theater in San Francisco on May ;
18 . . . You probably know that it |
is a story of the squalor of New
York's river slums and their influ
ence in making criminals from the :
gutter-snipes unlucky enough to be
born there.
NORMAN BEL GEDDES' super- |
realistic sets have been the talk of I
the town ever since the show opened |
in New York . . . The stage be
comes the edge of the East River |
with all the dirt and filth of the j
district . . . And the kids who play
the majority of parts in the play ,
are supposed to be something to
see . . . It will be one of those
Ihings about which everyone will be
talking.
YOU CAN (JET a combine on the
air of a feature in the air this after
noon when KGO broadcasts a mock
combat between 400 U. S. Army
planes, 2:05 . . . And Ray Noble
stooges with Grade and George and ;
people at 6:30 on KPO.
Several lifesize mannequins of !
Tutankhamen were buried with him
at Luxor.
