## ORCHIDS TO COBBS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It's a darn thing that "Bull
Scssioner" Cobbs took the time and
the space to so magnificently at
j tack Encina's rancid food!
It's really too bad that a kitchen
so equipped as the one in the Encina
, Commons, turns out such non-appe-
I tizing meals as are served to the un-
I suspecting freshmen of Stanford.
| Large scale production should not
! affect the quality of foods, and if
i one has ever eaten in a large hotel
he will readily realize this.
Freshmen pay a goodly sum to eat
in Encina and therefore should re
ceive satisfactory meals, but do they?
No. down and as their eyes
fall to their plates they are greeted
with the sight of a dried piece of
I meat that has been cooked so long
I its identity is hardly distinguishable,
or it the meat is not dried to a
| fr,,zzle it is literally swimming in fat.
if the cooks would only hit a happy
: medium everyone would be satisfied,
i Ifut until this medium is reached I'm
1 going to continue my griping.
In conclusion, I suggest that those
, who can truthfully admit they are
completely satisfied with Mrs. Wat
j son's delicacies, take a little trip up
I to Bay Meadows and get a stable
hand to administer to them a saliva
J test.

world of actuality too realistic, pre
fer to rest in the shelter of their
past prestige(?), this is brought for
ward not to seek appeal from your
tribunal, but to clear a bad name
from more blasphemy.
Our Hasher, his mysterious iden
tity having always proven a source
of great strength to him, has chosen
today to malign a person no closer
to him than his room-mate. Seeing
that person's countless faults and
caprices, he has taken an unethical
advantage for subject matter in a
column.
I That column from its content and
i title, indicates gleanings from gar
bage and, a priori, must have been
written in very bad taste.
Not only the literary debris of
that column but also the naivete with
which its author will perhaps, doubt
ful as it is, someday greet fine wines,
| shows the presence of a very un
educated palate.
It would seem that the young lady
mentioned could hardly long remain
attached, disinterestedly, as it is, to
! the server of such morsels.
