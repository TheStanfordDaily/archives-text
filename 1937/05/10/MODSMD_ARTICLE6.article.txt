# Durand Blames Heavy Load For German Zeppelin Crash
## 
### 
Emphasis on a pay-load incompatible with safety was a contributing
cause to the destruction of the Hindenburg, Dr. William F. Durand, Stan
ford's international authority on aerodynamics, told an audience of dis
tinguished engineers and industrial leaders at the San Francisco dinner

honoring him Friday night.
Following the crash of the Macon,
the Hindenburg's engineers elim
inated a similar possibility of struc
tural defect by putting nearly two
tons of extra material in the aft
end of the German sky-liner. But
while this extra weight made the
ship structurally safer, it led to the
abandonment of plans to put a core
of safe helium about the sacs of
dangerous hydrogen, Dr. Durand
said. The use of helium would have
reduced the Hindenburg's lifting
power from 10 to 12 per cent. This
reduction, in conjunction with the
ship's increased weight, would have
made the zeppelin commercially
unprofitable, he declared.
Believes in Zeps
But despite the Hindenburg dis
aster, regarded as a death-blow to
lighter-than-air aviation, Dr. Du
rand's faith in zeppelins remains
unshaken.
"Despite our unfortunate experi
ence with airships in naval service
in adjuncts to a fleet," he declared,
"I am satisfied that, building on past
experience and on the large advance
in our scientific background of air
ship design and construction dur
ing the past 10 years, we are now
in a position to design and build
large airships with a margin of
safety and security fully justifying
their use whenever their peculiar
advantages are desirable."
Must Use Helium
He added, however, the provision
that inert helium be used as the
lifting gas, and pointed out that the
United States has the world's larg
est supply of that gas.
Ground facilities provide the
"largest opportunity for improve
ment,he declared. Meanwhile, in
struments for blind flying and radio
communication are constantly being
perfected.
