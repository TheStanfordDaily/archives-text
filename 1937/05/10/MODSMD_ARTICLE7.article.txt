Loyalist snipers. Their advance was
covered by a fleet of 50 war planes.
Bilbao's 340,000 inhabitants re
ceived an ultimatum from rebel
Generalissimo Francisco Franco to
surrender "or be destroyed under
the rigorous law of conquerors." He
warned that unless his "Catholic
peace" was accepted, the Basque
capita] would suffer the full horrors
of war.

jSolluve Peaks, captured in 48 hours
'of continuous fighting.
