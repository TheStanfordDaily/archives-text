# 'See-Saw' Fall Fails to Phase Babies' Brawl
## 
### 
LIFE went to a Stanford party Fri
day nightâ€”maybe.
Anyway, Hunter Hendee, a campus
representative of the picture maga
zine, was present at the Sigma Nu
Baby Party while kid .stuff came to
near grief when Pi Phi Alice Hind
was knocked colder than San Fran
cisco on a foggy morning. Her escort,
Sigma Nu "Rammy Rasmussen, bore
down too hard on his end of the
teeter-totter and threw the lady for
a colossal loss.
Miss Hind soon regained con
sciousness and was not injured se
riously enough to be taken to the
hospital. Though she couldn't take
it, the rest of the children seemingly
could. The babies swung out to Les
Hite's licks and roared approval to
his rollicking entertainment.
Not too nostalgically recalling their
childhood days, usually dignified
men and women enjoyed snap-the
whip. ring-around-the-rosy, farmer
in-the-dell, and tug-o-war on the
lawn. No one had a handkerchief
or they would have dropped it all
over the lot while playing the other
little games. Swings, slides, and
such unbroken teeters as remained
saw plenty of action throughout one
of the Farm's brightest and highest
evenings.
