cises Committee, comptroller's of
fice, and the Western Electric Com
pany on the installation of special
amplifying equipment in the Lau
rence Frost Memorial Amphitheater

work of a similar nature at the
Texas Centennial in 1936 and at the
San Diego Exposition in 1935.
Grass that was planted on the sides
and bottom of the bowl last week
will have completely covered it in
time for the ceremonies. Roads and
paths leading into the structure are
being surfaced at the present time.
Parking Area Open
The new parking area south of the
library is now in use, and it is
hoped that it will x - elieve the con
gested condition in the old space.
Only the lower part of the area has
been surfaced with gravel to pro
vide for proper drainage; the rest
will be oiled periodically to keep
the dust down.
When more funds are available
the parking space will be surfaced
with hard material and marked
with lines for diagonal parking in
double lines.

torium and the little theater of Me
morial Hail. Classrooms and offices
