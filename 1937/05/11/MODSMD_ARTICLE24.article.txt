# Wilbur Says Pre-Reg Plan Lacks Value
## Believes Encina Inmates Troublesome as Ever Despite Fall Program 
### W. A. MILLIS 
The pre-registration orientation
period for freshmen, inaugurated
last fall, had little beenficial effect
upon Encina discipline, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur said yesterday
in explaining his reasons for can
celling all tentative plans formu
lated for the 1937 program.
"We have had just as much
trouble with the Encina boys this
year as we had in any previous
years," he declared.
In place of the three-year pro
gram, Dr. Wilbur urges a return to
the former policy of freshman orien
tation after the opening of the
school year. Defending this pro
posal, he said: "We've gotten along
for a good mnay years without the
expensive pre-registration program.
The program last fall was frankly an
experiment. Judging from our ex
perience, there is no clear evidence
that the program got results."
Cost Excessive
Determining factor in the cancel
lation of the program, Dr. Wilbur
declared, was the cost to the Uni
versity from the earlier opening of
halls and dining rooms, which he
said amounted to between $2000 and
$4000. No exact figures on the cost
of the program were available from
either Dr. Wilbur or the Accounting
Office yesterday.
Rumors that the Administration's
action was based upon the protests
of several faculty members against
the large expenditure for the orien
tation program while a 5 per cent
cut in faculty salaries was still in
effect, were termed completely un
true by President Wilbur.
Urges Barbecue
He urged that in the future a
barbecue on Stanford Hill on the
afternoon of Registration Day be
made a main feature of the orienta
tation program. However, an em
ploye of the accounting office said
yesterday that the main cost from
last year's program to the Univer
sity came from the barbecue.
Dr. Wilbur said that he decided to
cancel the program after studying a
report presented May 3 by George
Ditz, 1937 program chairman, rather
than upon a report credited in yes
terday's Daily to Chick Franich,
who directed the 1936 program.
I)it/ Reports
Ditz' report recommended a three
day orientation program, beginning
on Friday, September 24, preceding
autumn quarter registration, with
the opening of Roble and Encina. On
Saturday a welcoming assembly in
the Pavilion and conferences with
faculty advisers were scheduled for
the morning, with the Santa Clara-
Stanford game in the afternoon.
The evening program included an
Encina smoker and a Roble meeting
on Stanford traditions, the Honor i
Code, and student activities, and a
no-date jolly-up in the Women's J
Gym. Sunday features of the pro- I
gram included Matriculation Serv
ice in the Chapel, campus tours, and, j
to conclude the period, a barbecue j
on Stanford Hill.
This report recommended that "if
the administration feels that the ex
pense is too great to carry out this
complete program, the student com
mittee suggests that nothing what- i
soever be done before registration j
in the way of freshman orienta
tion."
Deans Concur
Dean Mary Yost, Dean George
Culver, Registrar J. P. Mitchell, and !
Comptroller Hugh J. Jackson all j
concurred in stating that the pro- |
gram involved an unnecessary finan- 1
cial burden upon the University, Dr. j
Wilbur said. Hence, he favors the '
alternative proposal presented by I
Ditz that "the new students can be
oriented after registration through j
the institutions already set up in the !
University."
Commenting upon the abolition of j
the pre-registration period, A.S.S.U. *
President Jim Reynolds said yester- I
day that "we will work in view of j
the limitations imposed, and do the |
best we can toward orienting fresh- j
men after school starts."
Reynolds added that the whole
pre-registration problem will be j
mulled over by Ex Committee at I
its meeting tonight.
George Ditz said that his com
mittee will continue work upon a I
revised orientation program, and |
that he hopes to have definite plans 1
formulated by the end of this week.

The pre-registration orientation
period for freshmen, inaugurated
last fall, had little beenficial effect
upon Encina discipline, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur said yesterday
in explaining his reasons for can
celling all tentative plans formu
lated for the 1937 program.
"We have had just as much
trouble with the Encina boys this
year as we had in any previous
years," he declared.
In place of the three-year pro
gram, Dr. Wilbur urges a return to
the former policy of freshman orien
tation after the opening of the
school year. Defending this pro
posal, he said: "We've gotten along
for a good mnay years without the
expensive pre-registration program.
The program last fall was frankly an
experiment. Judging from our ex
perience, there is no clear evidence
that the program got results."
Cost Excessive
Determining factor in the cancel
lation of the program, Dr. Wilbur
declared, was the cost to the Uni
versity from the earlier opening of
halls and dining rooms, which he
said amounted to between $2000 and
$4000. No exact figures on the cost
of the program were available from
either Dr. Wilbur or the Accounting
Office yesterday.
Rumors that the Administration's
action was based upon the protests
of several faculty members against
the large expenditure for the orien
tation program while a 5 per cent
cut in faculty salaries was still in
effect, were termed completely un
true by President Wilbur.
Urges Barbecue
He urged that in the future a
barbecue on Stanford Hill on the
afternoon of Registration Day be
made a main feature of the orienta
tation program. However, an em
ploye of the accounting office said
yesterday that the main cost from
last year's program to the Univer
sity came from the barbecue.
Dr. Wilbur said that he decided to
cancel the program after studying a
report presented May 3 by George
Ditz, 1937 program chairman, rather
than upon a report credited in yes
terday's Daily to Chick Franich,
who directed the 1936 program.
I)it/ Reports
Ditz' report recommended a three
day orientation program, beginning
on Friday, September 24, preceding
autumn quarter registration, with
the opening of Roble and Encina. On
Saturday a welcoming assembly in
the Pavilion and conferences with
faculty advisers were scheduled for
the morning, with the Santa Clara-
Stanford game in the afternoon.
The evening program included an
Encina smoker and a Roble meeting
on Stanford traditions, the Honor i
Code, and student activities, and a
no-date jolly-up in the Women's J
