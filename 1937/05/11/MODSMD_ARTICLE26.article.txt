# Row Plans Cleaning, Rebuilding Program
## 
### TIM SULLIVAN 
Spring housecleaning and build- |
ing will make the Stanford Row the
scene of much activity during the
summer months. Nine fraternities
and sororities are renovating and re
building their houses in a recon
struction program which will mod
ernize the Row.
Building plans of the Deke and
Alpha Omicron Pi houses have al
ready been related in The Daily.
Beta Landmark Goes
An historic campus landmark of j
some 40 years standing will pass into i
oblivion when the wrecking crew
begins the work of demolishing the ,
Beta Theta Pi fraternity's living
quarters.
Having already completed the "in
formal" wrecking of their home with
a series of impromptu parties, the
Betas will start "officially" to tear
down their house on May 15. They
hope to have their rebuilding suffi
ciently advanced to be able to move ;
ifi by the time school starts next fall.
Two Sets of Plans
With present plans calling for an |
expenditure of approximately $25,000 I
the Betas have placed the arehitec- '
tural designing in the hands of J. C. j
Branner, prominent campus archi
tect. Branner has submitted two al- \
ternate sets of plans, one calling for !
a colonial design, the other being of j
a conventional "American" nature, i
Meanwhile, the Betas are scat
tered all over the campus. Twelve
of them, along with their cook, Er
nie Dougherty, eat across the street
at the Kappa Alpha house. Three
eat at S&quoia, two dine with the j
Chi Psis, and the rest shift for I
themselves.
Alpha Phi Arrangements
Slightly further up the line, tho j
Alpha Phi sorority will renovate j
parts of their quarters. According to |
House Manager Barbara B. Baer, the |
Alpha Phi house will be topped by a j
new green roof, new colonial style !
windows of the same color which .
will open from the outside, and an j
entirely different front porch sur- I
rounded by new shrubbery and an I
iron railing. I

The Kappa Alphas have also been
able to find time to plan rather in
definitely for a new house. They
hope to raise $30,000 before break
ing ground on their altered struc
ture, and have already
well over half this sum, reports Ar
thur Christiansen.
New Paint for Alpha Delts
Alpha Delta Phi, says House Man
ager Allan Duncan, will make some
modifications in their house's me
chanical set-up this summer also.
Included in their plans for change
are a new dining room, larger living
room, and a new coat of white paint
for the whole exterior.
When queried as to their possible
plans for building, the Alpha Tau
Omegas replied that they had their
share of financial worries, but add
ed that they would raise "anywhere
from $2 to $200,000." With said sum
they will add a third story to care
for their all-time high number of
freshman pledges, and also add a
new sleeping porch.
Sigma Chis on Move?
Sigma Chi plans as outlined by
Tim Hays were of an indefinite na
ture. According to Hays the Sigs
are going to rebuild either this sum
mer or next. They will spend in the
neighborhood of $40,000 on a house
to be built in modernistic style.
Lastly, the Alpha Sigs are put
ting in a red brick sidewalk and a
fan-shaped staircase. They will also
renovate the inside of the house.
