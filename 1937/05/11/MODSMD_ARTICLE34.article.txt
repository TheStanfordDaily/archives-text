NOW THEY'LL PLAY
OUR WAY
Conference basketball team, which
will be tomorrow, it becomes
appropriate to bring up something
concerning the action taken by the
National Basketball Rules Commit
tee, of which Coach John Bunn is
Eighth District representative, when
it met in Chicago March 16 and 17 of
this year.
John Bunn went back there this
year wilh one very large purpose,
that of getting the Committee to
adopt the center-jump elimination
rules as it is used here on the Coast.
Everybody knows by now that the
Committee did juts that—they must
have been convinced by the results
shown in the Stanford hoop tour
during (Christmas vacation, that
ripped eastern basketball circles
wide open.
However, some may not think that
the adoption of the rule means any
thing in the fundamental methods of
basketball in the United States.
Those who do are all wrong. Bunn
has had many queries from different
coaches throughout the country al
ready, who were starting their spring
practices and were deeply concerned
over the differences the elimination
of the center-jump will make next
year.
These coaches want to know if the
new rule will allow them to use
more short and fast men, they want
to know how much the rule means
in regard to quick breaking, and
various other things. Since the ball
is put in play now after every goal
by the team opposite that which
scored the basket from the end of
the court, it is going to give a few
ol the good old conservative mentors
around the country something to
worry about for a while.
The establishment of the rule is
bound to open up the game appre
ciably, and while it is going to mean
revamping of thousands of types of
offense in the nation, it isn't going
to be so terrific as to be entirely dis
rupting. The damage is one for the
better; it should liven up the game
for those unbelieving souls who
think basketball is just as fast as it
will ever be.

IT'S ESSENTIAL
THAT'S WHAT IT IS

There was another rule change
that, while it isn't so fundamental as
the elimination of the center-jump,
is one which will at least serve to
clear up a lot of discussion. This one
concerned the screening, or block
ing, rule, and was very annoying to
the Cards when they played in the
East over Christmas.
In New York, when Stanford
played L.1.U., it was illegal for an
offensive man to dribble around
very close to one of his team-mates
and pick off the man guarding him.
That was one of the fundamental
methods of gaining the advantage
against a man-to-man defense here
nn the Coast, and it balled things up
considerably when the Indians had
to forget about using it. To strike
out that possibility took a lot of
team play out of basketball as we
saw it out here, and Genial John
determined to go after its legaliza
tion at the Rules Committee meet
ing.
The rule didn't need changing as
much as it needed clarification, and
that was done at the meet. Now
there should be little dispute under
the rule as to what constitutes
blocking. Blocking on the Pacific
Coast means stepping into the path
of a defensive man, and that's what
it will mean all over next season
Players won't be called for blocking
any more when they are standing
still.
