# Card Polo Men To Meet Utah
## Salt Lake To Be Scene Of Return Matches 
### 
Captain H. Grubbs' first-string
Card polo team will leave tomor
row for Salt Lake City, where they
will meet the University of Utah
horsemen in a two-game return se
ries Thursday and Friday. In the
match played here the beginning of
this quarter the Indians came out
on top with an 8-2 win, but that is
no indication that they will have an
easy time repeating the perform
ance.
The Utah horsemen rank high in
intercollegiate polo circles and with
the tables reversed and the Cards on
strange mounts and tired from a long
trip they will be hard to beat.
Last year in the series at Salt Lake
City the Cards won one game 7-. r )
and lost the other 4-3. Members of
the Indian team making the trip will
be listed tomorrow.
