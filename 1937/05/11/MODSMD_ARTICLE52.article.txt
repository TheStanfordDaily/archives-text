# An Expensive Necessity
## 
### 
DOWN from the idealistic clouds into the
mud-puddle of economics crash the sup
porters of Stanford's pre-registration program.
The proposition has been dinged not because
it cost too many dollars, but ostensibly because
the dollars didn't buy enough. Attendance was
weak, according to the Administration, and dis
ciplinary problems at Encina this year have
been just as severe as those before frosh got
expensive anti-mischief vaccination.
So instead of the pre-registration program,
yearlings will get the old and inefficient post
registration program decorated like yesterday's
hash. Added will be a reg-day barbecue, rem
nant of last fall's pre-reg experiment.
The traditional post-reg way was cheap, and
like many cheap things, it was uneconomical.
Sold as an orientation program, it simply didn't
orient.
And if the new compromise program is cheap
in the same way, it will end by being just as
expensive.
Actually, Stanford seems to be less interested
in the return on money spent for the period,
than in the amount spent.
For there can be no question that an orienta
tion program, coming as it will after freshmen
have plunged into their mad swim across the
academic Hellespont, will be far less valuable
than a similar program just after they've donned
their bathing suits.
We venture to say that the return on the
lesser number of dollars will be smaller than
the return on the larger number of dollars. And
that, we learned in Econ 55, isn't good business.
Our reasoning, though, may be faulty. The
Accounting Department isn't sure whether the
pre-reg period cost somewhere around $2500,
or somewhere around $4000. It believes unoffi
cially, however, that the greatest part of that
undetermined sum went for the barbecue.
If the Accounting Department is unofficially
right, then the post-reg period, scheduled to
include the barbecue, will cost certainly some
where near as much as the pre-reg period, but
without its benefits.
The whole thing doesn't make sense to us.
We wish it did. For then we could let Stanford's
most valuable help to freshmen slip into the
limbo of "good ideas" without feeling that the
University was losing more money than it was
spending.

hash. Added will be a reg-day barbecue, rem
nant of last fall's pre-reg experiment.
The traditional post-reg way was cheap, and
like many cheap things, it was uneconomical.
Sold as an orientation program, it simply didn't
orient.
And if the new compromise program is cheap
in the same way, it will end by being just as
expensive.
Actually, Stanford seems to be less interested
in the return on money spent for the period,
than in the amount spent.
For there can be no question that an orienta
tion program, coming as it will after freshmen
have plunged into their mad swim across the
academic Hellespont, will be far less valuable
than a similar program just after they've donned
their bathing suits.
We venture to say that the return on the
lesser number of dollars will be smaller than
the return on the larger number of dollars. And
that, we learned in Econ 55, isn't good business.
Our reasoning, though, may be faulty. The
Accounting Department isn't sure whether the
pre-reg period cost somewhere around $2500,
or somewhere around $4000. It believes unoffi
cially, however, that the greatest part of that
undetermined sum went for the barbecue.
If the Accounting Department is unofficially
right, then the post-reg period, scheduled to
include the barbecue, will cost certainly some
where near as much as the pre-reg period, but
without its benefits.
The whole thing doesn't make sense to us.
We wish it did. For then we could let Stanford's
most valuable help to freshmen slip into the
limbo of "good ideas" without feeling that the
University was losing more money than it was
spending.
