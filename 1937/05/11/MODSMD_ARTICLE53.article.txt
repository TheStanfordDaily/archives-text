# What the Prop Men Know
## 
### 
THE prop men who shift and shuffle Stanford's
athletic scenery for the benefit of rooters and
sports scribes in orchestra seats, and for the
satisfaction of alumni and B.A.C. coffer-keepers
in the wings, know something very interesting
about Stanford athletes.
They know that Stanford athletes are Stanford
athletes primarily because they like Stanford,
and distinctly less primarily because Stanford
likes them.
Today the prop men anxiously watch a con
crete case which proves the point.
In a southwestern high school there is an
athlete who can throw the javelin farther than
any present college man on the coast, and, just
as a sideline, plays football well enough to be
first-string all-state choice and the best "prep
school fullback in the country," according to
his coach.
In other words, he's an Athlete.
He is coming to Stanford. At least, he is to
day. He wants to come to Stanford because
Stanford is giving him a scholarship and a job,
but more, because he wants to come to Stanford.
If this weren't true he wouldn't look at the
farm twice, because the Farm's monetary offers
don't begin to match those of certain other
prominent universities.
Every scholarship Stanford offers is paid for
by some outside person or organization—alum
ni, Buck-of-the-Monthers, anyone interested,
sometimes even coaches.
Stanford, unlike other universities, cannot
merely waive tuition. The SI 15 must actually
tinkle into the till.
So all Stanford can dangle before him is a
scholarship and perhaps a job, where others
may lure him with all this, plus room, board and
incidentals.
When the high school athletic gem chooses
Stanford, he looks beyond the monetary lure
into the spirit of the Farm, its academic offer
ings, its prestige.
By this natural selection, those who do wind
up wearing the Cardinal are more than good
physical specimens seeking remunerative re
turn on good muscles and precise co-ordination.
They come to Stanford to mix athletics with
academics, and they tramp off the athletic stage
with benefits other than a handful of medals and
a broken back.—G. F.
