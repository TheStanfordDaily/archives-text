I JSYCHOPATHIC WARD OF THE LELAND STAN
-1 FORD JR. MEMORIAL MEN'S REST HOME EN
CASSEROLE, May 10 (Often). —I don't think I'm
going to leave the Rest Home.
I like it here. I like the sun baths, the sinapisms,
Wolf, the Nordically Mythical German Police, Dooser,
the tree-climbing dog, the gold fish, the canaries, and
Iggie, who eats meals here. But it's not only that.
I can't leave the Rest Home.
From by 99 44/100 per cent Ivory Tower here in the
psychopathic ward of the Rest Home, I can sneer at
the realistic world of actuality and vice versa, which
is besieging the gates.
At risk of cramping the editorial policy of The
Stanford Daily, I must take up the case of my a
priori room-mate. As I explained yesterday, he drinks
champagne. However, that is not all.
When he came to the door of the Men's Rest Home
yesterday, dangling a baseball bat, my bodyguard, op
erating on dispatches direct from the psychopathic
ward, informed him that I was asleep and running a
temperature. Each time he dangled the bat my tem
perature rose one notch; later advices indicated, how
ever, that the bat was just "for fun," but how was
my temperature to know?
Securing no satisfaction from me, I having neither
money nor yesterday's Hasher in my possession, he
proceeded directly to The Daily office. Every time he
brandished the bat, The Editor's temperature went up
a notch, and my room-mate went up a notch, and
finally he wrote a campus opinion, charging that The
Editor's temperature was controlled directly from the
Men's Rest Home.
I know you're all very interested in this.
Considerably refreshed, my room-mate then re
turned to the Men's Rest Home, catching me with my
thermometer down. Here he explained to me in a level
manner that he thought this was very funny, that he
was enjoying this immensely, that I was making a
fool out of myself, and that he was telling me this for
my own good, that he had talked to the gal for an
hour, and that she had said I was llat-chested, and
that she was a wonderful gal, and that if he had the
time and the money he'd take her away from me.
And I replied in a heavy obligatto that I hoped he
had the time, but my doctor bills were going to be
rather heavy this month, sorry to say.
And he left considerably elated, saying I was mak
ing a fool out of myself and that he was enjoying
himself immensely.
So you can see how conditions would be if I get
out of this psychopathic ward for the one over in the
house.
|>UT the reason I'm never going to get out of this
psychopathic ward is involved in that letter he
wrote. So diabolically clever it is—that purple prose,
that majestic internal rhythm, the aprioris, the real
isms of actualities, and the endless innuendo?
See how quickly he gets to the point, scourging me
for my cowardly anonymity, always a weakness of
mine, he rebukes me quite justly in his letter, which
is signed, "A very interested bystander."
Revealing all, he says that this man is a former
editor, and ha, ha, I, with my caprices and countless
faults, am his room-mate.
Pause for Station Announcement
"Say, Maisie, who's that cute fellow with the dreamy
blue eyes over there?"
"Oh, that the former editor's room-mate. He's
maintaining his anonymity, but he has caprices and
countless faults, and is very cute, and they say he is
diabolically clever."
He then points out my naivete, chastising me with
his aristocratic style, for being one of the literary pro
letariat. To quote:
"Not only the literary debris of that column but
also the naivete with which its author will perhaps,
doubtful as it is, someday greet fine wines, shows
the presence of a very uneducated palate."
My room-mate is always broke.
And humor is death to romance!
