# BULL SESSION
## PULL OVER, BUDDY

T>ROMINENT among the many injustices which put
iron into the tender souls of our undergraduates
is the way speed cops seem to single them out for
demonstrations of authority.
Many a student has found that the lightning of the
police force is unaccountably attracted to any car
driven by a young man. Not only does this lightning
strike continually in the same place, but it appears to
pass over those drivers who have the appearance of
tax-payers, or mayors' cousins.

Psychologists disagree as to why our cossacks of
the highway single out youngsters for their atten
tions. But most concede that somewhere the blue-coat
harbors a firm conviction that there is no closed season
011 college students.
Probably the police confuse the antics of high school
cut-ups with those of their elder brethren. They seem
to reason that if a high school sophomore is an idiot
when he gets behind a wheel, a college sophomore is a
bigger and better one. This idea is strengthened by
the small percentage of college men who do feel that
no one will appreciate their cleverness unless they
leave a trail of blistered asphalt.

But it is little consolation to an abused student to
meditate on the psychological factors behind his hu
miliation. This is particularly true when the under
graduate knows that he is a far belter driver than
most of the elderly throttle pullers the law passes
over.
The college student of today has a balance and
seriousness that would break the heart of his rah-rah
predecessors. Coupled with this new self control is a
cautiousness drilled into him by the perils of the mod
ern highway. An evolutionist might point out that
that, natural selection keeps half-witted drivers from at
taining sufficient age to enter a university.

■REACTION tests show that the average young man
is as quick or quicker than the average middle
aged man. Casual observation 011 any road shows that
the majority of cloth-head middle-laners are anything
but youthful.
But still the legend seems to persist among the gen
darmerie that college students should feel the iron
fist. The same policeman who lets a hair-brained
grandfather weave through a traffic at 60 leaps into
action at the sight of a boy doing 50 on an open road.
Of course this situation is hardly a cause for riot
or revolution. We can be brave and bear it. But it
is annoying to be slapped in the face by the old idea
that college men are congenital idiots. The under
graduate has put aside his childish foolishness. It is
only fair to give him credit for the comparative intel
ligence that is really his.
