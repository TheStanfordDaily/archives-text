## YOU'RE FINE, BUT

The Editor, Sir:
Several weeks ago there appeared
in the Daily an engrossing article on
the subject of world peace by a
hitherto unknown person, John
Cobbs. In this editorial, Mr. Cobbs
displayed much promise as a forth
coming newspaper man. He has
undoubtedly received many compli
ments for his independent thinking
with regard to his ideas on peace.
Since that time, however, Mr.
Cobbs has become what appears at
once to be a rancorous and even
pernicious Bull Sessioner. I refer to
his recent unjust topics concerning
Encina food and the Tuesday Eve
ning Lectures. When one has eaten
at Encina for three years and has
found the food wholesome and ap
petizingly served, one becomes irked
to read a malicious article like Mr.
Cobbs'. Similarly, the Tuesday eve
ning Lecture, which I have always
considered symbolic of an earnest
effort of the University to afford
cultural and practical knowledge to
all attending them, have been
sketched in deprecatory terms by
the pen which Mr. Cobbs wields so
boldly.
Not wishing to use malice against
Mr. Cobbs, I shall not intimate that
he presumably does not know what
he wants here at Stanford. I shall
not go to such limits as to say that
he obviously has some kind of axe
to grind as a literary stylist. I
daresay, however, that he has not
attended many Tuesday Evening
Lectures and that he has not learned

to recognize good food when he sees
it.
As for me, I have no axe to grind;
I merely think Mr. Cobbs' articles
unfairly biased. Now, if he must
continue to write editorials, smack
j ing of sensationalism and sometimes
j of pedantry, why can't he at least be
I discreet and, I might suggest, in
genious enough to confine his re
marks to material with which he can
cope more proficiently.
