# STINKS TYPICALLY

### 
, The Editor. Sir:
Our "Disillusioned Frosh" who
was lucky enough to get his gripe
in today's Daily is a typical stinker.
He howls, not because he is right
eously indignant, but because he
wants to write something that he
can clip and send home to the fond
parents.
I Encina food is good. Yes, I really
I think so, and I'm not going to take
the suggested trip to Bay Mead
j ows. The frosh pay $85 a quarter
1 for Encina food. By a little simple
I division we find that a frosh gets his
j three squares for approximately
i $1.30 a day. He can eat as much as
| he wants.
Now, Mr. "Disillusioned," do you
honestly believe that you could eat
' in' a large hotel for $1.30 a day,
i come back for seconds, and get as
! much or better food than you do at
I Encina?
No, you don't.
P.S.: Look, Ma, I'm in the papers!
