# Yost Leads Five Panel Symposium
## 
### 
One hundred women, fifteen men
discussed methods of achieving in
creased student participation in
campus activities last night at the
second meeting of the Leadership
Institute.
Presided over by Dean Mary Yost,
the meeting was a symposium of five
panels led by Frances Strong, Esther
Pclton, Pat Hamilton, Barbara Kim
ball, and Jane Tanner.
Follow Hand's Suggestions
Constructive advice on how to
manage committee meetings, how to
delegate responsibility, and how 1o
secure equality of opportunity fol
lowed directly in line with the sug
gestions of Dr. Hand at last Thurs
day's meeting.
Problem number two was the pos
sibility of achieving efficient assim
ilation of junior transfers. Dean
Yost suggested that the transfers be
given an opportunity for participa
tion equal to that enjoyed by re
turning students.
Most concrete suggestion directed
toward building up equality of op
portunity for students of all classes
was made by Senior Class President
Bob Mc√üoskcy who advocated that
an additional page be inserted in the
registration booklet questioning stu
dents on their interests and their
qualifications.
Men's Conference Advised
the A.S.S.U. office so that commit-
These cards would then be filed in
tec heads would always have an eas
ily accessible source of committee
material. A system of this sort is
being inauguratedb y this year's
freshman women.
Fundamental weakness in Stan
ford's student government is, ac
cording to last night's discussion, the
lack of organization on the part of
the men. Dean Yost advised that this
might be solved by a Men's Con
ference which met only when se
rious problems arose.
