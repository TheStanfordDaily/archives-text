# Coronation Pomp, Splendor Open with State Banquet
## Police Rescue Royal Pair From Jubilant Throng 
### 
LONDON, May 10 (U.R). — The j
| pomp and splendor of the billion- |
dollar spectacle revolving around j
I King George Vl's coronation opened
| officially tonight when the 41-year- i
old monarch and his Scottish queen '
entertained 450 guests at a state
banquet in Buckingham Palace.
The "curtain raiser" of the world's
most extravagant pageant had its
i setting in the palace's white and gold
! ballroom—l2o feet long and GO feet
! wide—that was built for Queen Vic
j toria.
The king, showing no signs of
! weariness after a hectic day of final
| dress rehearsals and last - minute
preparations for Wednesday's cere
! mony, sat at the head of a large j
I oval table chatting amiably with his |
| guests, gathered from every corner
I of the world to pay him homage.
Moves Smoothly
The state banquet moved smoothly
I in contrast to the earlier events of j
! the day when police reserves had to
j be rushed to Westminster Abbey to 1

protect the king and queen after
they were almost mobbed by a jubi
lant throng that smashed down
guard lines.
The crowds got out of hand again
tonight—almost smashing the win
dows of the limousine in which
Dowager Queen Mary and Queen
Maud of Norway, sister of the late
King George V, were riding along
the Mall from Marlborough House
to the palace.
The automobile was forced to halt
by thousands of cheering subjects.
Coronation visitors and natives
jumped upon the running boards.
Mounted police arrived and re
stored order and the queen mother
and her sister-in-law continued
along the Mall to the palace.
Hold Rehearsals
The king and queen spent most
of the afternoon at Westminster Ab
bey going through a final rehearsal
of their parts in Wednesday's two
hour ceremony—a ceremony that
was described by participants as be
ing "pretty ragged."
They participated only in part of
it, however. The Duke of Norfolk,
official master of ceremonies, and
his plump sister, Lady Rachel How
ard,. took the roles of the rulers
during the tedious procedure of
anointing, crowning, and receiving
the 'peers.
Most of London's visitors were
doomed to walk to the ceremony—or
fight for„the inadequate supply of
snub-nosed London taxis —when a
conference of 25,000 striking bus men
met and decided to continue their
strike for a seven and one-half hour
day.

The king and queen spent most
of the afternoon at Westminster Ab
bey going through a final rehearsal
of their parts in Wednesday's two
hour ceremony—a ceremony that
was described by participants as be
ing "pretty ragged."
They participated only in part of
it, however. The Duke of Norfolk,
official master of ceremonies, and
his plump sister, Lady Rachel How
ard,. took the roles of the rulers
during the tedious procedure of
anointing, crowning, and receiving
the 'peers.
Most of London's visitors were
doomed to walk to the ceremony—or
fight for„the inadequate supply of
snub-nosed London taxis —when a
conference of 25,000 striking bus men
met and decided to continue their
strike for a seven and one-half hour
day.

their special coronation flight from
New York to London today when
they landed at Croydon airport al
6:39 p.m. (9:39 Pacific time) after a
brief halt at Northweald, Essex,

LONDON, May 10 (U.R). — The j
| pomp and splendor of the billion- |
dollar spectacle revolving around j
I King George Vl's coronation opened
| officially tonight when the 41-year- i
old monarch and his Scottish queen '
entertained 450 guests at a state
banquet in Buckingham Palace.
The "curtain raiser" of the world's
most extravagant pageant had its
i setting in the palace's white and gold
! ballroom—l2o feet long and GO feet
! wide—that was built for Queen Vic
j toria.
The king, showing no signs of
! weariness after a hectic day of final
| dress rehearsals and last - minute
preparations for Wednesday's cere
! mony, sat at the head of a large j
I oval table chatting amiably with his |
| guests, gathered from every corner
I of the world to pay him homage.
Moves Smoothly
The state banquet moved smoothly
I in contrast to the earlier events of j
! the day when police reserves had to
j be rushed to Westminster Abbey to 1

protect the king and queen after
they were almost mobbed by a jubi
lant throng that smashed down
guard lines.
The crowds got out of hand again
tonight—almost smashing the win
dows of the limousine in which
Dowager Queen Mary and Queen
Maud of Norway, sister of the late
King George V, were riding along
the Mall from Marlborough House
to the palace.
The automobile was forced to halt
by thousands of cheering subjects.
Coronation visitors and natives
jumped upon the running boards.
Mounted police arrived and re
stored order and the queen mother
and her sister-in-law continued
along the Mall to the palace.
