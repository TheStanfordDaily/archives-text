DARTMOOR
At last we've found the shoe all of us have
j wanted for a long time. A genuine white buck
with a rugged leather sole you can dance in yet
that looks he-mannish enough to keep company
with shaggy tweeds and flannels. Dartmoor is
the answer . . . and only 3.50!
Here's a two-tone toughy in brown saddle*
leather trim on white buck. One of the sturdiest
and smartest shoes it has been our delight to
present. Heavy leather sole and a dash of the
British in the oversize perforations that let the
white buck peer thru.
