# Farm Places 4 on All-Star Basket Squad
## Luisetti, Moore on First League Line-up; Turner, Calderwood on Second 
### 
Four of the starting five of John
Dunn's Coast Conference champion
basketballers, Hank Luisetti, Cap
tain Dinty Moore, Howie Turner,
and Jack Calderwood, were named
to the All-Conference teams select
ed by the league coaches which were
finally released yesterday.
The great Luisetti was the only
unanimous choice for the first team,
but Moore lacked only two votes of
being unanimous and was second
only to Luisetti in total number of
votes cast for any player.
Turner was chosen as one of the
forwards of the second squad, while
Calderwood was selected as a guard.
COMPLETE TEAM
Wagner of Washington at forward
opposite Hank, Nelson of Washing
ton State at center, and Oram of
Southern California at guard with
Moore were the others named to the
first team.
Others of the second team are
Silver of Oregon at forward, Ball of
U.C.L.A. at center, and Dahlke of
Washington State at guard. Sur
prising enough was the omission of
second-highest scorer of the South
ern Division, Jerry Gracin, from
either team.
This is the second year in a row
for Luisetti on the first team, the
phenomenal eager has still another
year of competition to continue the
marvelous record he has already set.
Moore receives honors for the sec
ond time, also, for he was picked on
the first team as a sophomore. Ill
ness kept him out for a major part
of last season, but he was selected for
the second outfit.
FIRST YEAR MEN
Neither Turner nor Calderwood
have been named to either team
before, although Turner was given
honorable mention last year.
Luisetti and Oram are the only
repeaters for the first time, while
John Ball of the Bruins comes back
once more for consideration on the
second mythical team.
