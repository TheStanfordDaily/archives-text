# Chappie Features Dramatic History
## 
### 
Next issue of the Chappie, out
either Friday or next Monday, will
feature a comprehensive history of
Stanford dramatics, prepared by
campus actress and critic, Kerth
Baipes. The background of Stan
ford's stage is authentically sketched
by University Press Artist Art Lites,
'32, who is assisting Miss Baines.
Rated as historically impoitant to
Stanford's theater lore, the work
further justifies itself by its reve
lations of the initiative airl nth
humor of the people who have oe
ated the Stanford stage since campus
dramatics began back in th* 'niie
ties.
