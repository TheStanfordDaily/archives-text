# King Is Crowned As Rain Fails To Daunt Enthusiastic Crowds
## Parisian Intends To Claim Rights to Queenship 
### 
LONDON, May 12 (U.R).—King
George VI was crowned King of
England and the Empire at 3:30
this morning (Stanford time), cli
maxing an hours-long ceremony
and months of preparation.
After the ceremony the king and
his consort, the commoner Queen j
Elizabeth, left Westminster Abbey
for a triumphal procession through I
London's crowded streets, rewarding I
crowds who hod stood night-long |
vigils through intermittent showers j
to see their monarchs. They were i
scheduled to return to Buckingham j
Palace at 6:10 o'clock.
PLEDGED SUPPORT
In his first speech of coronation
week, given yesterday afternoon, |
George pledged himself to carry on ;
his father's work "for the welfare of i
our great empire," and in doing so j
ignored the 10 Va-month reign of his j
brother, the Duke of Windsor.
Furnishing comic relief for the sol- j
emn occasion, Mme. Lucie of Paris!
announced yesterday an intention j
to oppose the coronation of King I
George on the ground that she was
the rightful queen of England.
TATTOOED PROOF
As proof she was ready to show j
the royal arms of England and Ger- |
many, tattooed on her back. She i
confessed that they were invisible!
but claimed that they could be seen j
by means of ultra-violet rays.
Despite attempts to play it down
during coronation week, a new
clash over the Windsor-Simpson af- 1
fair cropped up yesterday when the !
royal family expressed its intention j
of having a representative at the
ex-king's wedding against advice
from the government. '
