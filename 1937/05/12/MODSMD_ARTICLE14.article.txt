## Rouble Introduces Plan To Bring Outstanding Pictures to Campus 
### 
Farm men and women may be
able to go to the movies without
leaving the campus if plans dis
cussed last night by Ex Committee
for motion pictures in the new the
ater go through.
Revivals of outstanding pictures
from recent years probably would
constitute the programs, which
would be given once a week. Com
plete projection facilities are in
cluded in theater plans.
The scheme was introduced by
Larry Rouble, who qualified his sug
gestion with the statement that it
would be in line with the policy of
keeping students on the campus for
their amusement.
The difficulties of booking pictures
and with the Operators' Union, cited
by Bob Mallett, led to the decision
in favor of revivals rather than first
rim films.
"President Wilbur might have a
pull," Rouble pointed out, "since he's
head of the Motion Picture Research
Council."
If the plan is adopted during fall
quarter, ballots may be distributed
to determine which pictures students
would prefer.
Rouble, graduate member of Ex
Committee, was named head of a
committee to investigate the matter.
Appointed to assist him were Mal
lett, senior man, and Fred Williams,
member at large.
