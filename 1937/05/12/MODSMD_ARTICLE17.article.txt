# Smith Chosen Concert Head
## Series May Be Removed To Memorial Theater 
### 
Virginia Smith, Chi Omega, was
last night appointed Concert Series
Manager by Ex Committee to serve
for the 1937Â»-38 season.
Other appointments to the Con
cert Series staff are: John Samter,
house manager; Delphine Joy, office
manager; Annabel Johnson, adver
tising manager. Next year's staff
will be Jeannette Brown, Jean
Munro, Moira Ford, and Margaret
Glensor.
WAS OFFICE MANAGER
Office frianager for the past year,
Virginia Smith has been working
under Betty Stearns, this year's
manager. Her job included touring
the living groups prior to concerts
to discuss the artists. During the
season of 1935-36 she was a tryoutee.
Also brought up by Ex Committee
was the possibility of holding next
years series in the new theater.
Main objection lay in the fact that
the theater will not hold as large an
audience as the Pavilion. This would
necessarily mean a rise in the price
of tickets unless cheaper artists
were procured.
GOOD ACOUSTICS
The Pavilion is a fire-hazard, ac
cording to the fire-department, but
the acoustics are very good.
"The aim for next year, as well as
working out a series to please all,
will be a more efficient distribution
of tickets. Work will start imme
diately," according to the new man
ager.
