# Professor Talks On French Travel
## 
### 
Most of the trouble and hard feel
ings between French and Americans
is caused by Americans not realiz
ing and observing French forms of
politeness when traveling in France,
according to Dr. Ralph H. Lutz,
dean of the School of Graduate Study
and Professor of History.
Americans antagonize the French
by continually making comparisons
of French institutions and customs
with those of America, and by
"talking too loudly in nasal tones
about monuments and art galleries
they are visiting."
