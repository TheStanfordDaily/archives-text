# Jackson Sets Fire Penalties
## Arsonists Liable to Fine, Prison Sentence 
### 
Possible expulsion and prison sen
tence for arson, plus costs of the
property destroyed and watchmen's
salariesâ€”that's the penalty of the
"play-minded" Stanfordite who
touches a match to the Farm's hay
stacks, according to an announce
ment yesterday by J. Hugh Jackson,
acting comptroller.
While hay-stack firing may be the
result of non-maliicous thought
lessness, there is always the risk of
a disastrous grass fire like that
which a few years ago destroyed a
large part of Berkeley, Mr. Jackson
pointed out.
In view of this possibility, watch
men will be stationed to apprehend
anyone wlilfully setting a fire any
where on the campus. Those caught
will be turned over to the police for
prosecution, and the cost of the
property destroyed and of the extra
watchmen's services will be assessed
against them.
Recommendation for expulsion will
be an additional punishment, and
will prevail also against these de
stroying fire protection equipment
or turning in false alarms, Mr. Jack
son said.
