# New Pre-Reg Plan Sought to Replace 'Costly' Program
## Ex Committee Questions $4000 Expenditure In Last Fall's Program 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Strongly favoring a revised prc
! registration program for freshmen
next fall, Ex Committee decided last
night to draw up a new plan which
1 "wouldn't cost the administration a
| nickel."
Action came after President Wil
! bur announced that last fall's pro
j gram had been too expensive, too
ineffective to warrant one next
I September.
Ex Committee members and the
| dozen newly-elected officers who
j sat in on last night's session unani-

mously agreed that the program jus
tified "the time and expense."
That the A.S.S.U. and the fresh
men themselves pay for the pro
gram rather than the University was
suggested. Each freshman would be
charged $3 for extra room and board.
Virginia Sterry, secretary-treas
urer of Roble, told the Committee
that "the girls were terribly upset
last night when they heard the ori
entation plan was being dropped.
RAH-RAH SPIRIT DINGED
Where the University could spend
$4000 on the program was questioned
when, according to two or three
members, its only expense was three
days' board. Room expense was
practically nothing since Encina
opened early anyway for football.
"They think the program created
an unusual degree of rah-rah col
legiate spirit," declared Mary Craig,
new senior woman. "The freshmen
had little to do those first few days
and the administration thinks the
rowdy spirit began earlier than in
other years."
The University's principal objec
tion to the program, according to
Jackie Brown, was the necessity for
professors to return early to coun
sel the new students.
COMMITTEE APPOINTED
"Naturally we made mistakes the
first time," argued Joe Weiner. "But
those objections naturally will be
ironed out. The fundamental good
of the program is still there."
Appointed to draw up a revised
plan for the Administration's ap
proval were George Ditz, present
head of the 1937 pre-registration
program; Chick Franich, last year's
chairman; Mary Craig, Roy Ander
son, Bud Milligan, and Esther Pel
ton.
Anderson's chief argument for a
pre-registration program was that it
cut down materially the number of
Honor Code violations among the
freshmen. "They were actually in
formed about the code before they
had a chance to violate it," he said.
PARTY IS DISCUSSED
Meanwhile, once the pre-reg sit
uation was off their minds, President
Jim Reynolds asked Committee
members to consider this problem:
"Should we have a party by our
selves in the city, or shall we have
dinner with the new officers here
in the Union?"
Next fall's Registration Dance
will be granted next Tuesday. Cap
and Gown and Sigma Delta Chi,
journalism fraternity, have already
applied.
