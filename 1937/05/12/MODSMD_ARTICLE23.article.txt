# Wire Tapping Evidence Aids Graft Probe
## Verbatim Conversation Of McDonough Bros. Given to Grand Jury 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11 (U.R).—
San Francisco's fluctuating police
graft .scandal broke wide open today
lollowing the appearance of Peter P.
McDonough, alleged "vice lord" of
the city, before the inquisitorial
county grand jury.
Appearing at the same session with
McDonough was Edwin M. Atherton,
chief graft investigator, who revealed
that McDonough's telephone wires
have been tapped for nine months.
RECORDED CALLS
Records of conversations allegedly
taken verbatim from tapped phone
calls between McDonough Bros, bail
bond firm and the police department
were turned over to the grand jury
by Atherton in a move designed to
prove his contention that McDon
ough is the "fountainhead of cor
ruption" in San Francisco.
The stenographic record of the
conversations purported to show
that McDonough received "tips" on
impending police vice raids before
hand from Captain James Boland,
property clerk of the police depart
ment.
Boland denied acting as a "go-be
tween" for the department and Mc-
Donough's office.
LINK HIGH OFFICIALS
The grand jury was in possession
of a 28-page transcript of conversa
tions taken by Atherton since the
end of the official investigation last
January. The conversations purport
to link present and former mayor's
office secretaries, high police officials,
judges, federal and state employees,
and civic authorities.
As explained by Atherton, the
conversations "disclose" the inner
workings of a huge $1,000,000 police
graft payoff system of which McDon
ough Bros, is the alleged head. The
payoffs are controlled, according to
Atherton, by McDonough and are
paid through police patrolmen by
houses of prostitution and gambling
establishments.
