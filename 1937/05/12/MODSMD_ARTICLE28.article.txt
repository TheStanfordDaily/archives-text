The A.A.A. was both good and
bad," Dr. Joseph S. Davis of the
Food Researeh Institute said yester
day in discussing his recently pub
lished book, "Three Years of the
Agricultural Adjustment Adminis
tration," written in collaboration
with Edwin G. Nourse and John D.
Black.
Dr. Davis went on to say that he
could neither give his stamp of ap
proval nor yet condemn the act or
the administration. As one of its
principal faults, he cited the fact
that the A.A.A. was too widespread,
that it lost rather than gained by
undertaking such a large program.
CONSERVATION LAUDED
Dr. Davis, former economist for
the Federal Farm Board, stressed the
Food Research Institute's position as
something of an interested bystand
er. Its best contribution, he stated,
lies in appraising agricultural poli
cies rather than in formulating
them.
Direct control of production he
listed as undesirable, while soil
conservation and regulation of the
flow of perishable products to mar
kets he termed advantageous aspects
of a national agricultural policy.
NEW BOOK PLANNED
"A European war," Dr. Davis said,
"would have a profound effect on
American agriculture. While the
tendency of the present administra
tion has been to make the United
States less of an exporting nation
than formerly, war probably would
cause an expansion of agricultural
trade."
The Food Research Institute now
is publishing a study on the Russian
wheat situation, answering nega
tively the question of whether or not

Russia will dump an enormous sup
ply of wheat on the world market
within the next few months.
Dr. Davis' book, based on an in
tensive study of the A.A.A. from its
conception to the time when it was
declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court, was published in
February by the Brookings Institu
tion of Washington, D.C.
