# Student Seeks Farm Treasure, Vanishes
## 
### BARBARA SWEET 
Two million dollars in your very grasp!
This is what Raymond K. Bevier, Stanford sophomore, expected to have
momentarily as he dug frantically in IMJ7 for Peter Coutts' huried treas
ure. San Francisco papers went wild as Bevier kepi them informed of the
progress lie was making toward what he was certain was the Frenchman's
missing treasure, subject of local ♦

story and legend.
Peter Coutts, fantastic French
man, was said to have hidden away
million dollars somewhere on what
is now the Stanford Farm. Before
he sailed away to France to end his
days he told Senator Leland Stan
ford where the money was buried.
The Senator was supposed to have
recovered two million dollars (al
though his San Francisco law part
ner Inter denied it.) The two mil
lion dollars which ht was unable to
locate was the object of Bevier's
search.
The Stanford student claimed to
have done research on the strange
.story and to have discovered a hid -
den tunnel as a result. Covered over
with brush of many years' growth,
the passage led back into one of the
lolling hills behind the campus.
WALL DISCOVERED
Bevier followed the tunnel until
ne came to what seemed to be its
end. After scratching away the ac
cumulation of dirt at the terminal,
however, he could see that the pas
sage was blocked by a granite wall.
Man-made, this wall was formed by
great granite blocks, cemented to
gether.
Keeping the newspapers informed
of his progress, although he wouid
not reveal the location of the treas
ure cave, Bevier dug away at this
wall alone, a single candle lighting
up the dimness.
ACCOUNTS CEASE
Suddenly the newspaper accounts
of Bevier's exploits ceased alto
gether. Whether he had found the
treasure and how much it amounted
to, or if the whole affair was a giant
hoax was never revealed. He simply
dropped out of sight.
Since that time various attempts
have been made to locate him.
Through the efforts of the Stanford
alumni secretary, Harlow Rolhert,
he was traced to a Los Angeles
hotel, the address of his business.
However, all mail addressed to him
there was returned—unopened.
And the riddle of Raymond Be
vier remains unsolved, as much a
mystery as the very treasure he
sought to recover.

Through the efforts of the Stanford
alumni secretary, Harlow Rolhert,
he was traced to a Los Angeles
hotel, the address of his business.
However, all mail addressed to him
there was returned—unopened.
And the riddle of Raymond Be
vier remains unsolved, as much a
mystery as the very treasure he
sought to recover.
Two million dollars in your very grasp!
This is what Raymond K. Bevier, Stanford sophomore, expected to have
momentarily as he dug frantically in IMJ7 for Peter Coutts' huried treas
ure. San Francisco papers went wild as Bevier kepi them informed of the
progress lie was making toward what he was certain was the Frenchman's
missing treasure, subject of local ♦

story and legend.
Peter Coutts, fantastic French
man, was said to have hidden away
million dollars somewhere on what
is now the Stanford Farm. Before
he sailed away to France to end his
days he told Senator Leland Stan
ford where the money was buried.
The Senator was supposed to have
recovered two million dollars (al
though his San Francisco law part
ner Inter denied it.) The two mil
lion dollars which ht was unable to
locate was the object of Bevier's
search.
The Stanford student claimed to
have done research on the strange
.story and to have discovered a hid -
den tunnel as a result. Covered over
with brush of many years' growth,
the passage led back into one of the
lolling hills behind the campus.
WALL DISCOVERED
Bevier followed the tunnel until
ne came to what seemed to be its
end. After scratching away the ac
cumulation of dirt at the terminal,
however, he could see that the pas
sage was blocked by a granite wall.
Man-made, this wall was formed by
great granite blocks, cemented to
gether.
Keeping the newspapers informed
of his progress, although he wouid
not reveal the location of the treas
ure cave, Bevier dug away at this
wall alone, a single candle lighting
up the dimness.
ACCOUNTS CEASE
Suddenly the newspaper accounts
of Bevier's exploits ceased alto
gether. Whether he had found the
treasure and how much it amounted
to, or if the whole affair was a giant
hoax was never revealed. He simply
dropped out of sight.
Since that time various attempts
have been made to locate him.
Through the efforts of the Stanford
alumni secretary, Harlow Rolhert,
he was traced to a Los Angeles
hotel, the address of his business.
However, all mail addressed to him
there was returned—unopened.
And the riddle of Raymond Be
vier remains unsolved, as much a
mystery as the very treasure he
sought to recover.
