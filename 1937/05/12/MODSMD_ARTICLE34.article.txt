American rugby.
ALL-STARS TO COME
According to plans of the Exposi
tion Committee, there will be in
vited an all-star team from Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, and Long Island
University to compete for the na
tional collegiate title with a western
team composed of players from
Stanford, California, U.S.C.. U.C.LA.,
and U.S.F. From these two aggre
gations there will be selected an

ter of the game of rugby, it is felt
