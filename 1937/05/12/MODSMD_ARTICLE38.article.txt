# Indian Riders Hit Road For Utah Polo Games
## 
### 
En route to Salt Lake City this morning is a Card polo team made up
j of first, second, and third-stringers, who will meet the University of Utah
j in a two-game series tomorrow and Friday.
Conflicts in individual schedules have resulted in a line-up composed
of one first-string, two second-string, and two third-string players instead

of the regular second team which
) Captain Grubbs, Indian mentor,
j originally intended to use.
Members of the Farm polo squad
making the trip are Lloyd Brooke,
No. 1; Rammy Rasmussen, No. 2;
Bob Wallac , No. 3; A1 McClintock,
No. 4; and Joe Hoenigsberg as alter
nate. It is doubtful if Rasmussen
will be able to play all of both
matches as his wrist was injured
yesterday in scrimmage, so Hoenigs
berg should see a lot of action.
Charles Thomas, senior polo man
ager, and Coach Capt. H. Y. Grubbs
will accompany the team.
The Salt Lake team was taken in
both matches of the two-game se
ries played here at the beginning of
this quarter by the Card second
string, but this coming series will
find them a lot harder to beat, as the
Indian team is not used to playing
as a unit and will be riding strange
mounts.
The Card polo team will return to
the campus late Sunday night.
