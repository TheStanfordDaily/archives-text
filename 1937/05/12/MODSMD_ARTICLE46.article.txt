# Pre-Mortem on Pre-Reg
## 
### 
DINGED by the Administration because it
didn't "take" as a frosh anti-mischief vac
cine, Stanford's expensive pre-reg plan gets the
discard bceause Encina's water bag overflow
fails to decrease proportionately to the increase
in outflow of administrative gold.
But this hypothetical correlation between
post-reg discipline and the pre-reg information
dole simply does not exist. There is no corre
lation.
What the yearling orientation plan seeks to
orient is the rough's mental housing, not his
rough housing.
Fresh from a hundred high schools he comes
to Stanford in a mental muddle; confused ideas,
conflicting impressions interspersed with mul
tiple question marks.
Stanford's pre-reg plan seeks to straighten
the maze, to put antagonistic ideas on the right
side of the fence, and sprinkle in something
new called "spirit of Stanford" (non-alcoholic).
To expect the pre-reg set-up to do more than
that—to calm Encina's troubled corridors, and
stymie painting brigades to the Big "C,"is
nothing more than belief in the supernatural.
For Encina's roughhousers are of the same stock
that filled the bull pen with broken furniture
twenty-five years ago, and no pre-reg prattlings
will halt Encina's water-baggery while there is
still an Encina.

Top of today's Campus Opinions is an En
cina-eye view of the pre-reg ding which refutes
another administrative claim that frosh fail to
show appreciation. It now appears that appre
ciation comes in answer to call, not when un
called-for.
Out of the Dining Halls of Encina and Roble
come the figures of appreciation, figures indi
cating that only twelve members of the Class of
'40 think the University plugged the right num
ber when partial cancellation of the pre-reg set
up was decided Monday.
Freshmen want the orientation proposition,
and want it enough to roll in three dollars apiece
to the administrative gold rush to cover meals
during the period, if that is needed to save it.
Naturally this vote was a hypothetical expres
sion of next year's yearlings.
If frosh will loosen their own purse cords to
defray costs of meals—the largest item of
expense, says the University—and if they agi
tate for its continuation, then, all administrative
bludgeoning to the contrary, the pre-reg end
justifies the pre-reg means, even if it means
expense to the University.
The Class of '40 knows the worth of what it
got.

Every once in a while a great new idea rains
from the clouds of idealism at Stanford. This
was one—a pre-registration period for fresh
men. It looked like a "natural" and, according
to the frosh, it was.
Not a vaccine for physical roughhousers, but
rather a housecleaner for the mental muddle, its
purpose should not be confused, nor its recep
tion underestimated.—G. F.

was one—a pre-registration period for fresh
men. It looked like a "natural" and, according
to the frosh, it was.
Not a vaccine for physical roughhousers, but
rather a housecleaner for the mental muddle, its
purpose should not be confused, nor its recep

DINGED by the Administration because it
didn't "take" as a frosh anti-mischief vac
cine, Stanford's expensive pre-reg plan gets the
discard bceause Encina's water bag overflow
fails to decrease proportionately to the increase
in outflow of administrative gold.
But this hypothetical correlation between
post-reg discipline and the pre-reg information
dole simply does not exist. There is no corre
lation.
What the yearling orientation plan seeks to
orient is the rough's mental housing, not his
rough housing.
Fresh from a hundred high schools he comes
to Stanford in a mental muddle; confused ideas,
conflicting impressions interspersed with mul
tiple question marks.
Stanford's pre-reg plan seeks to straighten
the maze, to put antagonistic ideas on the right
side of the fence, and sprinkle in something
new called "spirit of Stanford" (non-alcoholic).
To expect the pre-reg set-up to do more than
that—to calm Encina's troubled corridors, and
stymie painting brigades to the Big "C,"is
nothing more than belief in the supernatural.
For Encina's roughhousers are of the same stock
that filled the bull pen with broken furniture
twenty-five years ago, and no pre-reg prattlings
will halt Encina's water-baggery while there is
still an Encina.

Top of today's Campus Opinions is an En
cina-eye view of the pre-reg ding which refutes
another administrative claim that frosh fail to
show appreciation. It now appears that appre
ciation comes in answer to call, not when un
called-for.
Out of the Dining Halls of Encina and Roble
come the figures of appreciation, figures indi
cating that only twelve members of the Class of
'40 think the University plugged the right num
ber when partial cancellation of the pre-reg set
up was decided Monday.
Freshmen want the orientation proposition,
and want it enough to roll in three dollars apiece
to the administrative gold rush to cover meals
during the period, if that is needed to save it.
Naturally this vote was a hypothetical expres
sion of next year's yearlings.
If frosh will loosen their own purse cords to
defray costs of meals—the largest item of
expense, says the University—and if they agi
tate for its continuation, then, all administrative
bludgeoning to the contrary, the pre-reg end
justifies the pre-reg means, even if it means
expense to the University.
The Class of '40 knows the worth of what it
got.
