# The 						King Is Dead
## 
### 
NO less a figurehead than the crown he
wears, George Windsor became the em
blem of Empire at dawn today.
A year ago he was just a brother of England's
haloed man-on-horseback, perhaps the least
known member of the royal family.
Today the British press is trying to convince
millions that he will be a greater King than he
was a man.
The ascension of George represents more
than a turn-about of personalities. It indicates
a turn-about of principles.
For Edward did not abdicate because he
wanted to marry a divorced American. Wally
Simpson seemed all along just an excuse, no
more a part of the greater conflict than the flag
that leads troops to battle.
Edward was forced to abdicate because he
was a powerless emblem that had become a
power, and had ceased to be an emblem. He

was openly antagonistic to popular representa
tives who did not represent the people. He
fought those who allowed their public trust to
be perverted to selfish ends. He decried such
abuse as that of the Wales coal-miners.
Ironic reverse this: a monarch who had to
fight against the people's representatives in
order to fight for the people. A King who fought
for his subjects by fighting against those elected
in limitation of his own authority.
When Edward abdicated, the real kingship,
that of the people, died. It was defeated by a
political and financial power that needs the
royal purple only as its own cloak.
With the example of Edward as his lesson,
George today must be content with a lazy man's
job. The less he does, the better he will get
along with the people who really run Britain,
and who regard an Emperor as they might
regard a jovial bum, worthless perhaps, but
tolerated because he amuses the kiddies so well.
