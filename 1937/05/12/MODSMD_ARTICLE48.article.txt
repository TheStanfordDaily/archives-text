# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
CINCE Our Hasher, journalistic progenitor and mental
janitor for Our Hasher, Jr., has started running up
inches with tales of his own love-life and not going to
the Infant Frolic, the heroes of last Friday night s
peace symposium go unsung by the introspective bard
of Alvarado.
One Encina Cousin was playing crack the whip
with a score or so of his hosts and their wenches as well
as the bit of fluff named Agatha whom he had brought
down from the hill-country in San Francisco. She, it
seems, was last in line, and already nursing a few
minor injuries incurred on the now famously lethal
teeter-totter.
She, it also seems, was snapped from the whip and
catapulted down the way a hundred yards. Now
that self-same crack was enough to jar cigarettes and
keys from the breast pockets of the little man's play
suit..
Did he go after the cigarette's? No, he went after
the keys. After all, a Cadillac is more important than
a package of Camels.
By the shore of mighty Searsville,
Lies a garlic patch so sweet.
There in Spring time come the children
For a sun-tan in the heat.
After food a rest is taken;
Then they choose up sides fe softball.
By the garlic patch so sweet
lies the home-plate and the catcher.
If the catcher miss the ball,
It rolls among the onions wild.
Then, by night, as well as day,
The children baseball they can play.
For if, at night, the ball wings by,
By sense of smell they swing their bats.
¥ OST, for all good purposes, in the labyrinth of love,
one of Stanford's young gentleman's thought sure
he'd find a way to make the lady love him, too. At the
home of another girl, he and a friend staged one of those
fake bouts of fisticoughs and harsh words. Our hero
was wounded on the point of his chin and fell down.
Immediately all compassion was the lady-love. For
him she ministered for 20-odd minutes. But he was
knocked out cold as heaven.
At least so he said when she left the room. She
returned with smelling salt. And poured them down his
throat. He woke up. He didn't go out with her again.
She didn't go out with him again.

For if, at night, the ball wings by,
By sense of smell they swing their bats.
¥ OST, for all good purposes, in the labyrinth of love,
one of Stanford's young gentleman's thought sure
he'd find a way to make the lady love him, too. At the
home of another girl, he and a friend staged one of those
fake bouts of fisticoughs and harsh words. Our hero
was wounded on the point of his chin and fell down.
Immediately all compassion was the lady-love. For
him she ministered for 20-odd minutes. But he was
knocked out cold as heaven.
At least so he said when she left the room. She
returned with smelling salt. And poured them down his
throat. He woke up. He didn't go out with her again.
She didn't go out with him again.
r PODAY is coronation day this morning and everyone
is hearing George B. Crowned. In fact, at 11 o'clock
this morning a Math Professor will postpone an ex,
so his students can listen to it from 1 o'clock to 5
o'clock this morning.
CINCE Our Hasher, journalistic progenitor and mental
janitor for Our Hasher, Jr., has started running up
inches with tales of his own love-life and not going to
the Infant Frolic, the heroes of last Friday night s
peace symposium go unsung by the introspective bard
of Alvarado.
One Encina Cousin was playing crack the whip
with a score or so of his hosts and their wenches as well
as the bit of fluff named Agatha whom he had brought
down from the hill-country in San Francisco. She, it
seems, was last in line, and already nursing a few
minor injuries incurred on the now famously lethal
teeter-totter.
She, it also seems, was snapped from the whip and
catapulted down the way a hundred yards. Now
that self-same crack was enough to jar cigarettes and
keys from the breast pockets of the little man's play
suit..
Did he go after the cigarette's? No, he went after
the keys. After all, a Cadillac is more important than
a package of Camels.
By the shore of mighty Searsville,
Lies a garlic patch so sweet.
There in Spring time come the children
For a sun-tan in the heat.
After food a rest is taken;
Then they choose up sides fe softball.
By the garlic patch so sweet
lies the home-plate and the catcher.
If the catcher miss the ball,
It rolls among the onions wild.
Then, by night, as well as day,
The children baseball they can play.
For if, at night, the ball wings by,
By sense of smell they swing their bats.
