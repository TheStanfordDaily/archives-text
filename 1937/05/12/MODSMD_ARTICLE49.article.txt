# BULL SESSION

### 
A S striking hotel employees continue to promenade
the cliffs of Nob Hill, the composure of the Stan
ford rough is increasingly disturbed.
With spring peeping over the hill, with the young
man's fancy and the young girl's head turning like a
merry-go-round, an automobile or railroad strike rated
only passing notice from the proteges of the Farm.
But it was a different story when hotel workers de
cided that the spectacle of customers walking up 14
flights might soften the managers' hearts.
* * * *
When the list of cancelled dances began to look
like Ex Committee rejections for a closed date, the
rough wondered what the hell it was all about. When
a couple of students who booed the pickets had to
turn in remarkably good time for the quarter mile—to
get away—the Farm's snickers had only a thin coating
of joviality. And when rumors came out of the Nob
Hill no-man's-land that the union was excluding all
college men from its ranks, our collective gorge rose
like car-loadings in '26.
* <i * *
college man consoles himself with the thought
that if he can't get a bank presidency after gradua
tion, he can always dig ditches or run elevators. It
scares him to think that unions may close even this
to him.
In his early training, the rough was introduced to
sweet little stories which instilled the idea that the
'poor but honest' sons of toil, covered with tons of
soil, were the elect of God.
Later he came to regard labor as a bunch of naughty
names whose antics were annoying but entertaining if
you had time to follow them. The realization that labor
unions may be the most important influence on his
life is very much a punch below the belt.
* # * *
The hotel strike, like most such fiascos, is probably
a useless and futile business. But it has brought to the
attention of the Stanford undergraduate the greatest
problem of modern times. According to all indications,
the labor question is going to dominate business and
society for a generation. It appears that the college
students of today will be involved in the final pay-off.
* * . *i : *
I>UT the undergraduates, particularly at Stanford,
have smugly ignored the issue. They have concen
trated on improving their line and their liquid capac
ity; and have wandered dreamily amidst the well
known ivied walls, oblivious to the shouting and tu
mult just outside.
Such "students" will set an all-time record for con
sternation when they are suddenly ambushed by a
world in which the capital-labor tea party is the domi
nating feature.
College men, we hope, will be the leaders of tomor
row's society. As such they will have to cope with the
labor question.
The hotel strike has helped to make us conscious of
the importance of the problem, and in that it has
served one good pur pose; if not one good meal.

When the list of cancelled dances began to look
like Ex Committee rejections for a closed date, the
rough wondered what the hell it was all about. When
a couple of students who booed the pickets had to
turn in remarkably good time for the quarter mile—to
get away—the Farm's snickers had only a thin coating
of joviality. And when rumors came out of the Nob
Hill no-man's-land that the union was excluding all
college men from its ranks, our collective gorge rose
like car-loadings in '26.

In his early training, the rough was introduced to
sweet little stories which instilled the idea that the
'poor but honest' sons of toil, covered with tons of
soil, were the elect of God.
Later he came to regard labor as a bunch of naughty
names whose antics were annoying but entertaining if
you had time to follow them. The realization that labor
unions may be the most important influence on his
life is very much a punch below the belt.

The hotel strike, like most such fiascos, is probably
a useless and futile business. But it has brought to the
attention of the Stanford undergraduate the greatest
problem of modern times. According to all indications,
the labor question is going to dominate business and
society for a generation. It appears that the college
students of today will be involved in the final pay-off.

I>UT the undergraduates, particularly at Stanford,
have smugly ignored the issue. They have concen
trated on improving their line and their liquid capac
ity; and have wandered dreamily amidst the well
known ivied walls, oblivious to the shouting and tu
mult just outside.
Such "students" will set an all-time record for con
sternation when they are suddenly ambushed by a
world in which the capital-labor tea party is the domi
nating feature.
College men, we hope, will be the leaders of tomor
row's society. As such they will have to cope with the
labor question.
The hotel strike has helped to make us conscious of
the importance of the problem, and in that it has
served one good pur pose; if not one good meal.

A S striking hotel employees continue to promenade
the cliffs of Nob Hill, the composure of the Stan
ford rough is increasingly disturbed.
With spring peeping over the hill, with the young
man's fancy and the young girl's head turning like a
merry-go-round, an automobile or railroad strike rated
only passing notice from the proteges of the Farm.
