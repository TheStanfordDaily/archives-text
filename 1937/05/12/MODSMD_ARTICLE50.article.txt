# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						FROSH-EYE VIEW 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I suppose it's funny for a member
of the Class of '40 to have any con
cern over next year's frosh, but I'd
like to uphold the continuation of
the pre-registration period next fall.
The big argument seems to be that
we frosh didn't come across with
the goods the administration thought
we would for the money they spent.
Not being an authority on the water
bomb market, I cannot say much
about the improved or unimproved
conduct of Encina inmates. How
ever, I have just witnessed members
of '37, '38, and '39 having a little
"water spoil" across the street that
made the Encina boys green with
envy.
That's not my main point, though.
While the Class of '40 may be lax
in showing their appreciation of the
pre-reg period last fall, I believe that
m the majority of frosh there is an
appreciation. It's a great feeling
when you can get lost with no up
perclassmen to laugh at you, to go
to a football game that seems to be
put on for your special benefit, to
get the old college spirit and learn
"Come Join the Band" at the Pa
vilion gathering.
President Wilbur says the barbe
cue should be continued. As I re
member, this was the only event
our President was at.
A<= far as the extra cost for free
food goes, I think it helps the frosh
enjoy Encina food for a maximum
period. Maybe that "gold mine,",
commonly known as the English A
Syllabus Fund, could help take care
of the deficit.
At most of the colleges the frosh
are the last to show up on the cam
pus. I think it is a unique and
worthwhile feature to have the pre
reg period at Stanford. Personally,
1 wouldn't want my first impression
of Stanford to be waiting in line half
a day to hand over $115.
So, let's give the frosh a break.
