# IRONY, PERHAPS?

The Editor, Sir:
Recently Tro Harper, in a column
entitled, "I like capitalism fine,"
said, "Ever stand on the corner of
Third and Mission and try calling

every man your brother? Think it
over."
Those who desire to change the
present social order would no doubt
use the same picture as an argument
against capitalism. If the profit
system produces such backwashes of
humanity, it may be we should try
something else.
But, perhaps the column was writ
ten in an ironical mood similar to
the poem which was posted in the
Palo Alto peace exhibit last week:
"All men my brothers?
I must love all these?
'T will take some doing: but
what must, must be.
Though God preserve me, if
in their turn, they
Should all start loving me!"
(Saturday Review of
Literature)
