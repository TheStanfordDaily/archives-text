# $1.30 FOOD'S-WORTH
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It would be very interesting to
know just how thorough a study
NOT disillusioned frosh has made
of the subject of feeding large num
bers of people. He asks whether
you can eat in a "large" hotel for
$1.30 a day—not taking into consid
eration the fact that food in large
hotels is sold at retail prices, and
that you pay, not only for superior
food but for superior service and
surroundings; obsequious waiters,
soft lights, etc. Needless to say, En

] cina does not have these. And it is
j possible to eat, if not luxuriously, at
| least adequately — which is more
| than can be said for Encina fare—in
| the city on $1.30 a day.
| In the best run commissaries of
' thp C.C.C. there is a food allotment
! of 41 cents per man per day—and
; that is the highest price allowed.
| i'vlany camps do it on less. And this
food includes fresh milk and vege
tables, good cuts of meat, ice cream,
chicken, and turkey on Sundays.
J And the food .is better cooked,
; served, and prepared than it ever is
j in Encina—not to mention its being
better food. Even allowing for gov
-1 eminent discounts on wholesale food
purchases, Encina should be able to
J do better than it docs. Any private
. family whose kitchen is well run
should be able to have good food
for less than $1 per person per day
j —considerably less. And private
families don't buy wholesale. No—
j cheapness isn't an excuse for En
j cina's food.
