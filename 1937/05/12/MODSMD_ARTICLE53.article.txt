# STOCKINGS SHOCK

### 
The Editor, Sir: ,
Cannot some way be found to
convince Stanford women how un
seemly is the habit of rolling their
stockings below the knee?
It is not at all attractive to see
that area where the stocking ends
and the girl begins. And especially
with current styles dictating skirts

as short as they are, it is impossible
to long escape showing the flesh
when stockings are rolled.
It's not that I object to seeing a
pretty leg. Let them go bare-legged
if they wish. It's the line of transi
tion that's annoying. If they must
wear stockings, can't they please
wear them properly.
Either bare legs or stockinged
ones, but no half-way measures for
me! 1
