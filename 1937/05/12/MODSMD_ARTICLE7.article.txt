# Lopez to Feature Tunes From Gaieties at Prom
## 
### 
Vincent Lopez was yesterday running his 15-piece orchestra through
strains of three hit Gaieties songs, preparing at least one for a special'
Junior Prom arrangement here Friday night, according to a letter re- !
ceived by Wayne Richardson, prom chairman.

Lopez also agreed to
over a Pacific network from the [
Pavilion but Richardson found the |
cost of leased wires prohibitive.
Although Lopez has never before |
played at a Pacific Coast college, he i
has entertained at proms and co- i
tillions at 14 eastern schools—Dart- I
mouth, Yale, Harvard, Virginia, :
V.M.1., Georgia, Texas, Lafayette, j
Lehigh, Pennsylvania, New York, j
Columbia, Chicago, and Notre Dame.
The composer of "Knock, Knock,"
Lopez has long been famous through- i
out the East for his original ar- j
rangements and sparkling piano- !
novelties. He recently brought his !
band to Hollywood to play regular- j
ly on Grace Moore's radio program, i
The A.S.S.U. office had by clos- I
ing time last night sold 217 bids—at
$3.50 —to the prom. The dance is in- i
formal—women may wear "fluffy
summer formals," the men white
coats and slacks, Gerry Reed, com
mitteewoman, suggested.
