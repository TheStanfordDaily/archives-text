# Clubs All Wet; Councilmen Join In Water Fight
## 
### 
Men's Council met a few minutes
late yesterday afternoon -two of its
members were slipping into dry
clothes after the first bis engage
ment of the eating clubs' spring
water-fight season.
Located a water-bag's throw from
Encina's east end, the three inde
pendent eating clubs—Breakers, El
Campo, and El Toro — began their
spring campaign during lunch when
Campo men stripped down to shorts,
began dousing Toros and Breakers
with bucket-fulls of cold water.
Within five minutes, the vicinity
was covered with 50 half-naked
clubmen splashing cans of water
over each other, running back into
the kitchens for more ammunition.
Encina freshmen, to whom even a
12-ounce water-bag means Con
valescent Homo hours, hung out
windows cheering their dripping
sponsors across the road.
At dinnertime Toro, usually last to
join the battles, attacked both
Breakers and Campo. Before hos
tilities ended at dusk, two dozen
waterboys had .even invaded En
cina.
