# King George Crowned At Westminster
## New Monarch Dedicates His Reign to 'World Peace and Progress' 
### 
LONDON, May 12 (UP).—George
VI was crowned king of the world's
mightiest empire in Westminster
Abbey today while ermine-robed
peers of his realm shook the nearby
sepulchres of forgotten sovereigns
with shouts >of "May the king live
forever."
The coronation ritual, in which
the 72-year-old Archbishop of Can
terbury anointed the king's head,
breast and palms with hallowed oil
while a cloister choir raised voices
in "Be Strong and Play the Man,"
was carried out in all its centuries
old splendor before 7,700 persons in
the abbey.
ARCHBISHOP HESITATES
There was a moment of awkward
ness in the crowning of the king.
The archbishop turned the crown in
his hands, hesitating and puzzled to
find the front. When he got it on, it
was askew, setting rakishly on the
left side of the king's head.
He spoke of his revex-ence for the
crown of the British empire which
he received at Westminster Abbey,
adding: "In me as your king is
vested for a time the duty of main
taining its honor and integrity."
SERVICE OF EMPIRE
The 41-year-old monarch, an
nointed with the holy oil of king
ship in a centuries-old religious
ceremony, told his vast radio audi
ence that his reign will be dedicated
to the service of the British empire
and the cause of "world peace and
progress."
Then, late tonight, he appeared —
for the third time—on the balcony
of Buckingham Palace and waved
cheerfully to a throng of thousansd.
EDWARD, WALLY LISTEN
As the choir sang "Te Deum Lau
damus," ending the ceremony that is
steeped in long tradition — symbolic
not of the enthroning of a new mon
arch but the fact that kings may
come and go but the empire goes on
in glory forever—Edward, Duke of
Windsor, and Mrs. Wallis Warfield
sat beside a radio at Monts, France,
listening in silence.
Edward, the "prince charming" of
the empire, would have been crown
ed today had he not sacrificed all
for the love of the American -"bom
divorcee who could never become his
queen. In three weeks — either
June 1 or June 2—they plan to be
married in a quiet ceremony.
IRISH DISTURBANCES
While millions of British subjects
proclaimed the crowning of George
VI today, thousands demonstrated
against him. Chief disturbance oc
curred in the Irish Free State which
officially ignored the coronation.
The masses come to shout their
home had stood for hours—some for
two days—in rain, fog and sunshine
to witness the rich processions that
wound through six miles of London
streets before and after the corona
tion ceremony.
