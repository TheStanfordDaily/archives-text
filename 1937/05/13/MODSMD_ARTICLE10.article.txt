## 
### 
Winstead Weaver, former
Gaieties star and now a paid
for funnyman working 'at
Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer, has
just completed a two-reeler,
"My Little Feller," with Andy
Clyde, to be released next
week.
"In the pix I dance, sing, and
do my best to play a good
stooge," he said in a letter to
the Daily. "Its preview was
well accepted, and I am very
evident all through it, on ac
count of there being only two in
the cast outside of a little
baby."
