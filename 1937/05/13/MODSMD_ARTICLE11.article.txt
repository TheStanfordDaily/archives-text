# CIO Pickets Close Two Steel Plants
## 25,000 Workers Called On Strike as Parley Fails To Get Contract 
### 
PITTSBURGH. May 12 (U.R).—
John L. Lewis' Steel Workers' Or
ganizing Committee, aiming a blow
at major independent steel corpora
tions which have not signed union
contracts, tonight so effectively pick
eted two plants of Jones and Laugh
lin Steel Corporation that the 11
p.m. shift did not go to work.
Philip Murray, SWOC chairman,
issued orders for the strike at the
Jones and Laughlin Pittsburgh and
Aliquippa, Pa., plants, where 25,000
are employed, after his conference
with H. Edward Lewis, corporation
chairman, failed to produce a signed
contract. Negotiations for a con
tract will continue tomorrow.
U.S. SENDS CONCILIATOR
Corporation spokesmen indicated
there would be no attempt to oper
ate their mills if they are closed by
strike. James Francis Dewey, U.S.
Labor Department conciliator, who
aided in,eliding the recent automo
bile strikes, conferred with SWOC
leaders after workers at the plant
made no attempt to go through the
picket line manned by husky union
steel workers.
Dewey left the SWOC headquar
ters shortly after midnight,- saying
there was nothing to announce.
It was reported that J. & L. officials
had offered a proposal for an elec
tion to be held by the National La
bor Relations Board to determine
whether a majority of the employees
are SWOC members.
INDEPENDENTS DELAY
The calling of the strike at the
J. &L. plants shattered the peace
that had prevailed in the steel in
dustry since Unitew States Steel
ended its traditional anti-union pol
icy by signing a union contract.
About 100 small companies followed
the lead of big Steel, but the five
major independents have delayed
acting on signed agreements.
These major independents employ
about 200,000 of the nation's 500,000
steel workers. Union workers at
Republic Steel Corporation, which
employs 52,000 in 35 plants, and
Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com
pany, which employs 26,000, have
authorized SWOC leaders to call
strikes in their mills if no written
agreement is made.

aided in,eliding the recent automo
bile strikes, conferred with SWOC
leaders after workers at the plant
made no attempt to go through the
picket line manned by husky union
steel workers.
Dewey left the SWOC headquar
ters shortly after midnight,- saying
there was nothing to announce.
It was reported that J. & L. officials
had offered a proposal for an elec
tion to be held by the National La
bor Relations Board to determine
whether a majority of the employees
are SWOC members.
INDEPENDENTS DELAY
The calling of the strike at the
J. &L. plants shattered the peace
that had prevailed in the steel in
dustry since Unitew States Steel
ended its traditional anti-union pol
icy by signing a union contract.
About 100 small companies followed
the lead of big Steel, but the five
major independents have delayed
acting on signed agreements.
These major independents employ
about 200,000 of the nation's 500,000
steel workers. Union workers at
Republic Steel Corporation, which
employs 52,000 in 35 plants, and
Youngstown Sheet and Tube Com
pany, which employs 26,000, have
authorized SWOC leaders to call
strikes in their mills if no written
agreement is made.
