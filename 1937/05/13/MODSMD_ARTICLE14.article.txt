# Marriage Course Professor Sought
## 
### 
Decision on whether a course in
I Human Relations should be added to
[ the curirculum depends on the i*e
[ suits of investigation now under way
as to what department the course
would be in and who would teach
it, according to President Ray Ly
-1 man Wilbur.
Request for the course, which
I would deal wtih various phases of
| marriage and social conduct, came
I from the Student-Faculty Relations
j Committee, in answer to a student
| petition asking for such a course.
