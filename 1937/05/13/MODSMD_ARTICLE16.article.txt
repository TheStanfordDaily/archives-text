The private life of Doctor Mar
gery Bailey, illustrated with candid
studies and other pictures by Daily
Editor Bob Eisenbach, and written
by humor Editor Gist, will be a
major feature of Chappie's history

comes out today.
Tracing her life from childhood in
Santa Cruz through her days as an
undergraduate at Stanford, where
she won Phi Beta Kappa and Cap
and Gown honors as well as working
on the Chappie art staff, the article
goes on to tell of her work as a
faculty member and efforts to make
Stanford a center of the arts in the
West.
Inside slants on her personal likes,
dislikes, habits and a clear picture
of her varied character will aid tim
orous freshmen and befuddled up
perclassmen to understand her bet
ter.
On sale today on the Quad by
campus beauties, and stocked by Mr.
Gunther in the Cellar, this issue will
attempt to make history for Stan
ford dramatics and, perhaps, create
some for Chappie.
