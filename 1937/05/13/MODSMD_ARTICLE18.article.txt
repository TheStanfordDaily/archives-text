# Paly Police Plead For Pedal Patrol
## 
### 
The Palo Alto police department
wants a bicycle. After five years of
renting a man-power vehicle for one
of their "finest" to ride around the
down-town section, Paly police have
asked the city council to
one of their own.
According to Chief Howard Zinke,
bicycle-riding is a highly effective
means of nocturnal patrolling. The
council ways and means committee
has taken the matter under consid
eration.
