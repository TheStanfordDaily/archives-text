# Fontius Wins Second Term As Manager.
## Masters Appoints Frost, Daugherty to Dividex Managerships for Fall 
### 
Chuck Fontius yesterday was re
appointed student manager for 1937-
38 by Graduate Manager Alfred
Masters.
Fontius' reappointment came after
Masters "had great difficulty" in
choosing from the three candidates
â€”Fontius, Dick Daugherty, dra
matics manager, and Jerry Brown,
business manager of The Daily.
Accompanying the appointment is
the naming of Daugherty and Gordy
Frost to managership of the Dividex
for next fall.
The choice of Fontius for the sec
ond consecutive term as student
manager, a distinction achieved
only once before, terminates a long
series of managerships.
Named junior manager of the
Quad during his sophomore year and
senior manager while still a junior,
Fontius set precedent for rapid pro
motion. During his senior year,
Fontius held over as manager of the
yearbook.
For the past two years he has held
sponsor positions in Encina, and last
year was chairman of Publications
Council. He was president of his
sophomore class and twice voted
S.A.E. house president.
"TOUGH JOB"
Masters' announcement was made
after a three-week period of delib
eration in which the three applica
tions were weighed. "It's always a
tough job, but this time all three
men were so close that I delayed the
decision a week trying to settle the
matter," Masters explained.
The Dividex managership was al
lotted after examination of five tip
plications, chosen from a group of
ten and submitted to Masters' for
his final choice by Publications'
Council.
