# Pre-Reg Plans Still Indefinite
## 
### 
Plans to continue the pre-regis
tration orientation program remain
ed indefinite today, after a special
committee appointed by Ex Com
mittee Tuesday failed to meet last
night. Five of the seven members of
the committee did not turn up for
the meeting.
Last night's meeting was sched
uled for the purpose of drawing up
revised plans for an orientation pro
gram, which would be financed by a
special $3 fee upon freshmen and
which would meet the objections
raised by President Ray Lyman Wil
bur when he cancelled the pre-reg
plan on Monday.
A.S.S.U. President Jim Reynolds
says that he hopes to get the com
mittee together later this week, so
that the new orientation plan can be
presented to Ex Committee and Dr.
Wilbur next week.
