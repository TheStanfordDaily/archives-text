# Attorney Sees Indictment Of McDonough
## S.F. 'Vice Lord' May Be Charged with Perjury In Graft Investigation 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (UP).
â€”Deputy Attorney General Wil
liam F. Cleary today predicted grand
jurf indictment of Peter McDon
ough, asserted "vice lord" of San
Francisco, his associates and promi
nent municipal figures mentioned in
Edwin N. Atherton's "tapped" tele
phonic recordings.
"We are pointing toward indict
ments and it is highly possible we
can act in that direction," Cleary
said. "I believe there is already
enough on the record to justify per
jury proceedings against McDonough
and Captain James Boland, police
property clerk."
Cleary is now the leading prose
cutor of San Francisco graft in
quiries since District Attorney Mat
thew Brady turned the work over to
Attorney General U. S. Webb's of
fice.
It was revealed that Atherton, the
city's chief police graft investigator,
not only tapped wires of McDon
ough Bros, bail bond firm, but had
recorded phone conversations of
"suspected" persons in the Federal
Building, State Building, and City
Hall.
"The result*" Atherton said, "shows
the influence of McDonough Bros,
extending into all branches of gov
ernment."
In his recently published report,
Atherton asserted that McDonough
Bros, was the "fountainhead of cor
ruption" in a $1,000,000 annual pay
oil' system in which houses of pros
titution and gambling establishments
paid a high price for "police pro
tection."
