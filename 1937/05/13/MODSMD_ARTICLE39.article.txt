# Yawning Students Hear Coronation Ceremony
## 
### 
While loyal English subjects stood
in the rain to watch their king be
ing carried through the streets of
London to Westminster Abbey to be
crowned, yawning Stanford students
sat up Tuesday night, huddled
around radios listening to the cere
monies.
According to a rough estimate,
more people stayed up at Lagunita
Court than at any other dormitory.
Approximately one out of every five
women listened in. The Oaks, Roble,
Toyon, Branner, and Encina also
had their quota of all night specta
tors-by-proxy. One Encina man
who had a room-mate who likes his
sleep locked the room-mate, along
with his bed and dresser, out in the
hall for the night and listened in
side to the coronation.
Fifteen Fijis sat around their ra

dios all night listening and drinking
coffee. Five didn't go to bed at
A.T.O. and three at Sigma Chi. Six
or seven Sigma Nu'Â« started to hear
the ceremonies, but only one fin
ished the night out by the. radio.
The largest single sorority group
to stay up was at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma house. Six Delta Gamma's
and six Tri Delts tuned in on Eng
land all night. Three enduring Pi
Phis lasted the night out, going to
bed as the sun came out and King
George left Westminster Abbey.
In most of the campus living places
five or six gathered into one room,
crowded onto the beds, and tried to
keep awake while King George made
his seemingly endless way through
the London crowds. Many gave up
before the actual coronation at 3:30
o'clock.
