# Encina Sheep Retrieve Fleece From Gamblers
## 
### 
Gambling on the Encina board refunds ceased abruptly yesterday, with
the announcement that refunds would amount to as much as $25.
The fact that all 1.0.U.'s were torn up as soon as such a high refund
was announced yesterday has been generally taken for evidence that the
amateur Encina speculators were uninformed of the actual amount of

refunds at the time the transactions*
were made.
Evidently hoping to make a dollar
or two on the deal, the several En
cinamen were buying up rights to
other students' refunds at prices
ranging from $10 to $14. As soon
as they found the tremendously high
profit they were making, the specu
lators canceled all contracts.
"IT WAS ALL IN FUN"
Inadvertent originator of all the
commotion was Sponsor Gordy Mal
latratt, who jokingly announced in
the dining hall Monday noon that he
would pay $7.50 for anyone's right
to a refund.
Mallatratt said last night that he
"had nothing to do with it after my
poor judgment in the dining hall.
There was no intent on the part of
anyone to be crooked."
Exact amount of the refund, an
nounced yesterday by Special Ac
countant Walter C. Drugg, will be
$25. This is for the fall and winter
quarters. Spring quarter refunds,
which arc expected to be much
lower, will be paid next fall.
CHECKS OCT TUESDAY
Checks will be distributed Tuesday
from 1 to 4 o'clock.
In the case of students who al
ready have received board refunds
for hashing or meals missed by
sickness, the present refund will be
given on a basis of 14.7 per cent of
the net amount each student has paid
for board during the first four quar
ters.
The total fund to be divided for
refunds amounts to approximately
$12,000.
