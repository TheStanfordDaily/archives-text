STANFORD THEATER
Romeo and Juliet has been re
viewed before but this is just to let
you know that it's here again. And
very well worth your time if you
haven't already seen it. As you
know, Norma Shearer and Leslie
Howard take the title roles and are
backed by a fine cast including
Basil Rathbone, Lionel Barrymore,
C. Aubrey Smith, Reginald Denny,
and Edna May Oliver.
The powers that be spared no ef
forts to make it a combination of all
the arts, pictorial, dramatic, and mu
sical, and they succeeded. Miss
Shearer plays Juliet with as fine a
touch as she has ever done any
thing. When speaking of Howard,
one thinks of the line from "This
Side Idolatry," where Shakespeare
says, "I had to kill Mercutio to save
the play for Romeo." Only in the
picture they did not kill him soon
enough to prevent Barrymore from
stealing it from Howard. However,
the cast, all round, is hard to beat in
any way.
Again, it is something to add to
your collection of culture, and be
sides, you will certainly enjoy it.
