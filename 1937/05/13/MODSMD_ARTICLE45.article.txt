# Youth Hostels Trend Lauded At Lunch Club
## Duveneck Tells of Move To Found Low-Priced Lodgings in California 
### 
Talking on the movement fores- 1
tablishing of youth hostels, F. B.
Duveneck spoke to the Luncheon
Club yesterday. Duveneck, member
of the International Committee of
Youth Hostels, described the trend
as it has been taking place in Eu- !
rope and the United States.
He sketched the history of the
movement from its inception by a i
German school teacher in 1910 to
the present day. The idea spread
rapidly in Germany under the back
ing of a wealthy merchant, and soon
chains of such hostels were all over
Europe. Three years ago they were
started in New England, and at
tempts are being made to establish
hostels in California.
The hostels are primarily lodging
houses for hikers and bicyclers,
providing bedding and a place to
prepare meals. The cost is very low,
ranging from 25 cents per night
down. Possession of a "pass" for the
hostels permits lodging in any part
of the world.
Newest development of the idea
is the "rolling" youth hostels â€”
trains which are run on the same
plan as the earlier establishment,
and which provide tours throughout
I the United States at a very low
cost.
Far-reaching were
seen by Duveneck in the furthering
of world peace through bringing to
gether the youth of all nations by
the hostels.
