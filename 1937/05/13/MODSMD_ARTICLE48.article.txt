# PERMANENT CCC DENIED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (U.R).â€”
Overriding President Roosevelt's
recommendations, the House today
passed and sent to the Senate a bill
continuing the Civilian Conservation
Corps for two years.
The President had asked tha* the
CCC be made permanent.
Steel spectacles which obscure the
view straight ahead have been put
on hens in Maine, to stop frequent
battles.
