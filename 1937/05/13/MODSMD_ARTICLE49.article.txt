THEY COMPLETED the task of
rebuilding Angell Field last year,
and when they were done they had
what was potentially the fastest
track any man would ever want to
run upon. So far all hopes have
been justified — the track is very
fast, it drains off quite rapidly, and
all in all everything's just hunky
dory. Given a couple years more
and that track should be mellowed
into magnificence.
But when they bliilt that track
they didn't put any bleachers to
amount to anything around it,
and now people arc griping be
cause even though the track is
far superior to the stadium oval
it can't he used when the B.A.C.
expects a good crowd for a meet.
Maybe they had a reason for not
putting bleachers around, maybe it
would have cost too much or the
head men were afraid they would
get the same wind-tunnel results as
the stadium if stands were put up.
All 1 know is what somebody tells
me, and they haven't told me that
yet.
However, there is obviously a
need for some sort of seating ac
commodations around the track.
There is plenty of room, there need
be no kick on that score. Two
straight tiers of seals, one on each
side of the field, might he all right
as far as (lit* fear of drafts is con
cerned, since the wind more often
blows across the track than along
it, anyway.
Of course, the placing of the dis
cus pit, in the hollow at the end of
the trick just low enough that con
testants can't be seen from field
level now, is not exactly one of the
track's good points from the specta
tor's angle. If bleachers were built
high enough the spectators on the
top row would be able to see the
evenl, at a distance at that, but those
sitting on the lower rows just would
n't get in on the affair a-tall. Re
moval of the pit onto the center of
the field, in the same spot with the
javelin, would remove that difficulty,
but it might raise others, because
discus throwers are sometimes pret
ty wild.
Outside of a few minor faults
like that, though, the field merits
a set of good stands. It just means
a little more money for the 8.A.C.,
which is in itself no puny obstacle.
You sort of have to sympathize
with the B.A.C. sometimes, too, be
cause the only time it gets any
recognition is when it's giving, but
it might be better to build some
stands around Angell Field than
on some other project.
There can be no question that
bleachers around the field are nec
essary if Stanford is to have a repu
lsion for tracks that will match the
effort put in on fixing the field last
year. It's a cinch that the stadium
track is no favorite among track
men.
HARRY MALONEY is once more
president of the California Rugby
Union, having been chosen at the
annual meeting in San Francisco
Monday night. Harry was president
for 14 years, 1920-33 inclusive, and
then refused office because duties be
came too heavy.
He accepted office again this
time because it gives him a chance
to build up the game he loves most
of all. rugby. An Empire man.
Harry probably was born with a
love of the game, and he has been
for years one of the outstanding
exponents of the sport in America.
This year the World Fair com
mittee is starting plans to have in
ternational rugby competition in
this neck of the woods in 1939,
and by working as president of the
C.R.U. Harry can get in some
mighty licks for the game.
When you show devotion the likes
of Harry's to any sport, it's a cinch
you're going to get a lot of help.
Harry will have a lot to do with this
pending rugby competition, and you
can bet yourself that the contests
are going to be successful. And
when some of you birds think you
have done some real work for an
organization, take a look at Harry's
record with the C.R.U. and the game
of rugby in general and then go
back to work.
