# Seniors Defeat Junior Nine, 2-1
## Pitching Honors Shared By Johnson, Paine 
### 
In a five-inning intersquad game,
the seniors of Coach Harry Wolters'
baseball team defeated the juniors
2 to 1 out at the Sunken Diamond
yesterday. *
Vern Johnson and Howie Paine
shared pitching honors for the sen
iors while Spike Furman tossed for
the '38 men. Dick LaFranchi got
the best hit of the day with a long
drive out to center field, but was
thrown out trying to stretch his
clout into a home run.
Earlier in the game Leonard Linde,
star third-sacker, who was recruited
onto the seniors' team, slid into third
base .and received a painful ankle
injury.
Today the frosh baseball players
will have a chance to get revenge
for their defeat in the mudfight last
fall, as the schedule calls for an in
terclass game between the freshmen
and sophs.
