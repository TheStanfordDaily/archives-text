# Indians Given Chance To Win Fresno Relays
## Cards Face U.C.L.A. As Chief Competition In Mile Highlight Event 
### 
From the Fresno State College of
fice of public relations comes ihe
news that Stanford "realizes she can
beat the Trojans . . . and gain re
venge for the beating in dual com
petition." From San Francisco col
umnists comes the news that Stan
ford stands a good chance of knock
ing off a world's record in the mile
relay.
Three members of the Card team,
Jack Weiershauser, Ray Malott, and
Bill McCurdy are around 48 sec
onds. Johnny Hewitt and Jimmy
Kneubuhl, one of whom will be the
fourth man on the team, can both
tip the clock under 50 seconds. The
above times are from a standing
start and if the boys can knock off
two seconds with a running start
and if one of them hits it off under
48 seconds, such as McCurdy did
against U.S.C. and Weiershauser at
>Cal, another world record will be
broken this Saturday. The present
mark is held by U.S.C., made at the
relays l,ast year.
BRUIN TEAM STRONG
Among big names in other events
will be Terry, the intercollegiate
javelin champion from Hardin-Sim
mons, Texas, who has thrown the
spear 229 feet; Sam Francis of Ne
braska, champion of the Drake,
Kansas, and Texas relays in the shot
put, who will seek to add another
relays' title to his list; Elroy Rob
inson and Norman Bright, two of
this country's finest middle-distance
runners who will seek a new world
record in the 1000 yards; Bill Sefton
and Earle Meadows of Southern Cal
ifornia, who will attempt to reach
15 feet for another world pole vault
record.
The Cards' main opposition in the
mile relay, which will be the high
light event, will be U.C.L.A. The
Bruins' team of Bob Young, Grimes,
Calleri and Kiefer have turned in
a 3:16.1 this season.
MEDLEY IS CARD HOPE
The Indian 880 relay men of Ma
lott, Hiserman, Carewe, and Iron
Man Weiershauser also will stand a
good chance, but U.S.C. and Cal who
feel pretty confident about this
event will be hard to beat. The
Trojans have Crane, Talley, Boone,
and Jordan, all of whom can do a
plenty fast 220 and the Bears have
Williams, Anderson, Pollock, Frick,
Trumbley, and Dowdakin from
whom to pick a team.
Another of the Cards' hopes is the
medley team of Malott in the 440,
Mahurin in the 880. McCurdy in
the 1320, and Alexander in the mile.
Jim Reynolds wlil be in fast com
pany with Sam Francis of Nebraska
who represented the United States

at the Olympic Games in the shot
j put.
Stanford, who tied Southern Cali
i fornia for the relays title last year,
â–  has raised her entry list from 25 to
33 and will be really out to win, but
i competition in all events promises to
be tougher than ever and none of
the contestants are resting easy.
