WHILE the paint is still drying on Stanford's
new Memorial Hall, the first of many an
ticipated headaches throbs through certain cam
pus heads.
The headache goes this way. Stanford has
just built itself a new theater, technically com
plete, but physically small. "Only 1700 seats?"
they say. Not enough.
Already the Concert Series bosses argue that
the back-board studded Pavilion's extra seat
ing capacity makes it more practical for Stan
ford's biggest cultural plug than the Memorial
Hall.
But the Concert Series is not a type case by
which to judge Stanford's none-too-large but
thoroughly adequate new theater, even though
the apparent Concert Series dilemma can be
solved.
When engineers laid their penciled first
drafts for Stanford's hall, there was this question
of size to decide, and conceivably the reasoning
took this form —straight from Econ 1.
Marginal utility of a theater's seats is gov
erned by the number of seats, the frequency
with which they are used, the cost. Stanford
could have installed enough to handle the
greatest Concert Series crowd of all time, but
between concerts, the dusty empties would re
duce the marginal utility of the whole to near
nothing. Neither would too few seats make for
greatest marginal utility.
The point of greatest returns, of greatest mar
ginal utility, is reached apparently at 1700 in
Stanford's theater—adequate to handle campus
productions which can be run two perform
ances, still not over-built to the extent that seats
and floor space often lie idle.
There will be chronic cat-calls on the size of
Memorial Hall, and there will be times when
they are substantiated, but small imagination
is needed to discover that the seating problem
hugs the classic favorite of philosophers, econo
mists, even engineers—the eternal midline.—
