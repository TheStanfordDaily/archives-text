AN instrument set up to increase student
participation in extracurricular activities is
breaking down because it lacks the very thing
it encourages.
Last week the Leadership Institute's initial
meeting contained enough fire from the floor
to make it worth while as a "bullsession" on
student government, a fairly accurate gauge of
public opinion.
We saw its possibilities as a sounding board
for Ex Committee, a body whose ability to put
its ear to the ground is astoundingly slim. This
Leadership Institute, we thought, was an ideal
set-up for drawing out the opinions and atti
tudes of People Who Presumably Think.
But the second meeting discussed little more
important than ways and means of running a
Sunday afternoon tea. Instead of finding out
what some 125 representatives of "the people"
felt about underlying trends of student govern
ment, Miss Yost and her five "panel" leaders
pumped Women's Conference training rules
into a justifiably unresponsive audience.
There was no response —and hence no bene
fit—because the Institute dulled rather than
sharpened any interest the "leaders" had in
student government. —D. B.
