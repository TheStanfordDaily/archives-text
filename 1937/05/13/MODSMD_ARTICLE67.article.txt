# An Education

### 
(From the Tulane Hullabaloo)
OF RECENT years there seems to be a
growing tendency on the part of the so
called intelligentsia of this country to deprecate
as much as possible the value of a college edu
cation. Many widely read authorities blatantly
assert the four years spent in college are a
gross waste of time, and could be used to much
greater advantage in some other way. Strong
hold of their arguments seems to be that col
leges, as they are today, fail to prepare young
men for what they must face upon graduation;
upon entering the world of business. The
term "college," in these instances, is under
stood to denote academic schools solely.
True, academic curricula apparently do little
to prepare men for the trials and tribulations
of the business world—but have colleges of
the arts and sciences ever claimed that as their
object? In the criticisms the making of money
is presupposed as the prime object of a higher,
education, while such is not the case. Unlike

the Patent Medicine Man, philosophers and the
classical languages professors have never stood
upon a soap-box and proclaimed their product
a cure-all for what ails you, in this instance the
lack of money. They don't advertise their
wares as a short cut to worldly success.
As we understand it, a higher education is
intended primarily to aid one to understand
what is going on about him, and the supreme
innate satisfaction that comes from knowledge.
There are other important benefits to be de
rived, but we shall not now concern ourselves
with them. The point being, as one author
tersely put it, "We don't go to college to learn
how to make a living; we go to learn how to
live."
