# OUR HASHER

### 
FOLLOWING the reunion of Wally and Windsor, the
crash of the Hindenburg and the Coronation of
my room-mate, Our Hasher can now return to nor
malcy and continue with a recital of other people's
troublels.
There is a Delta Gamma pledge in Roble Hall who
has been reeciving a series of mysterious packages by
way of the U.S. Mail. Emanating from the general di
rection of the Sigma Nu house (this is the house that
did not turn the car over, remember?), the series has
been gradually building up to a climax. The first
package contained a fine brace of goldfish just swim
ming in tears. The next one was full of an extra
dead gopher snake. And the last one to date held a
bat, which was alive only to some extent. By process
of logical deduction, we all may expect the next pack
age to contain a Sigma Nu.
I don't wish to keep taking up the time of my
readers with the baser sort of things, but sometimes
we must face the facts. The story under consideration
concerns that fundamental standard of Stanford life
known as the basement of the English building. Sev
eral years ago, according to rumor, tradition, legend,
and hearsay there was nothing under the English
building but a basement. Then along came spring
quarter and a general growth of the student body, the
relaxation of the 500 ruling, and several minor relaxa
tions all down the line. The University discovered
it needed more classroom space.
(JO THEY went down into the basement prepared to
insert rooms 200 A and 10Q. But before they could
get underway, there was a mysterious room way over
there in the corner that had to come out. The mys
terious room was barred and bolted at door and win
dow. But they got a tool over from the Corp. yard
who gnawed his way in.
There followed a few brief moments of muffled
curses and strange clankings, then out from the dark
recesses the tool passed soup tureens, oyster forks,
butter spreadersâ€”a complete silver service, down to
knives and forks. This was climaxed by three cases
of champagne.
No one could ever explain it. The English Depart
ment denied it came out of English A syllabus fees,
and there was no contemporary evidence to prove
that Pete Coutts, the Frenchman, saved cigar coupons.
Personally, I think it's all a lie. .
L, after all this time, I wish to announce a story.
The Mills College Bulletin of Summer Courses, in
telling of the many virtues of Mills College (to which
some Stanford men reputedly can swear) says, in short,
that Mills summer students not only have the oppor
tunity to meet their instructors informally in the class
room but have the chance to live with them.
When Stanford's office of the registrar saw this
notice he laughed in his inimitable coloratura and is
sued a Bulletin. Said he, "I'm afraid Stanford can't
compete with that."
Said Stanford's beloved history professor, whose
Middle Ages will end this year: "Well, I don't know,
the Oaks girls can come up and live with me."
