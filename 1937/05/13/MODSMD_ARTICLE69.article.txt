SMILE PRETTY FOIt THE ISIHDY
WfHEN Stanford looks at the world through its own
eyes, it's treading on fairly safe ground, but when
two cameramen from LIFE magazine come down to
look at Stanford they don't use eyes, they use micro
scopes. They take Stanford apart and let the pieces
fall into type forms so that 1,500,000 people can put
them back together again.
Yesterday two representatives of v the now famous
picture magazine came down to see what they could
see.
"What sort of stuff do you want?" we asked.
"That's hard to say, but first of all we want to prove
Stanford is a farm," they said.
"Do you want to take pictures of coeds?" we asked.
"No, we're using U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. coeds. They're
much better."
"Do you want research labs to show what Stanford
does in the field of science?" we asked.
"No, we're taking all our research pix at Cal,"
they said.
"Do you want professors?"
"The only ones we want are Hulme and Marge
Bailey and then we're not sure the New York office
will use them."
"Is there anything in the way of athletic pictures
we could get you?"
"No, we've got lots of those on file."
"Well, just what do you want?"
* * * *
Eastern offices told us to get pictures of Stan
ford showing its informality in dress, customs, and
ways of living. They want fellows in cords who have
n't shaved or washed for weeks. Pictures of hayfields,
canoeing on the lake, playing golf. Say, you haven't got
any good shots taken in the local grog shops, have
you?"
"Yeah, we have a few, but we'd probably get thrown
out of school if you published them."
"We also"want some pictures of students dancing in
the afternoon over at your new Nitery, some more
down in one of the creameries. Saturday night we're
going to take a lot in the White Tavern. A lot of the
fellows looked pretty funny last week when they were
all dressed up in baby clothes."
"Yeah, that party was a lot of fun," we said.
* * * *
"That's what we want, students having fun in an
informal way. We got some good horseback pictures
this afternoon. This morning we took some swell stuff
out in front of the library where a lot of students were
basking in the sun."
I looked at Eis and Eis looked at me.
"Sons of the Stanford Red."
I was whistling away at a great rate.
"College sure was a lot of fun," said Eis.
"Funny how that country-club idea got out in spite
of the administration."
