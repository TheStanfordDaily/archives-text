The Editor, Sir:
On behalf of the Board of Direc
tors of the Stanford Convalescent
Home, I want to express our appre
ciation of the very fine interest that
has been in the Home by the
student body during the last few
weeks.
The Committee in charge of the
annual campaign to raise funds for
the home have done an unusually
fine piece of work, and the results
are better than anyone could have
anticipated. Everyone tells me that
the character of the campaign was
most satisfactory, and all the friends
of the Stanford Convalescent Home
are enthused by the generous and
lively interest taken by so many
members of the student body.
The assistance rendered by the
Stanford Daily was most effective,
and I hope you will be able to find
a place for this expression of appre
ciation on the part of our Board of
Directors.
