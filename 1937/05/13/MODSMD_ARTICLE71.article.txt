# ANOTHER COUNTY

The Editor, Sir:
After the strange contrast made by
President Wilbur's statement con
cerning pre-reg period, it seems to
me that one other strange contrast
should be noted.
In a University where lack of
money is continually harped about
and where efficiency should be para
mount, the Library as it is handled
now offers a sore thumb which has
stuck up for some time—but with
true inefficiency has been over
looked by the administration.
Every so often an article is print
ed in the Dippy about the effort to
recover lost books. In classes the
same cry is always heard—shortage
of or absence of necessary material.
Both of these could be in a large
measure overcome by the simple
procedure of requiring each student
to have a card, stamping the. card
when a book is withdrawn and when
it is returned. With a limit of four
books or so, and the requirement
that the card must be presented
when taking out and returning a
book, available material would be
more adequately distributed and
definite responsibility could be
fixed.
As it is now, one person by tak
ing out "21 books," as I heard one
person say he already had the other
day as he gave his cards for four
more volumes, can corner a sub
ject. With a mere signature that
no one knows for sure is not fake,
conditions grumble along as at pres
ent.
Why not some immediate action?
Yours for some action,
Another Victim
