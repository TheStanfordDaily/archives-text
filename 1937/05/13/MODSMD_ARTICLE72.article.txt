The Editor, Sir:
So this is a student democracy!
Oh my yes, all Stanford students
have an equal opportunity to apply,
try out, and run for various A.S.S.U.
offices! Well, maybe they have the
nominal opportunity to do all this
but just where the hell does it get
them. Runfor has it, official but as
yet unannounced, that this guy Fon
tius has raked himself up the job of
student manager for another year.
Equality of opportunity, huh?
Now this doesn't mean to cast any
aspersions at Fontius' capability to
handle the office. He probably is the
best man for the position now, with
a whole year's experience behind
him. But what of Brown and Daugh
erty, who never have and never will
be given the chance to prove that

they could be just as good. Yea, j
student equality of opportunity.
They may not have been holding
the reins this year as student man- j
ager, but each in his more special- j
ized field has certainly done a supe- i
rior job. Management of a student
newspaper is no pipe to keep out of !
the red—Brown has done it, taking j
over after a year of more or less
disorganization.
Putting across three dramatic
productions, and coming out on the
top side of the ledger for the first
time in over seven years, and on
top of that cancelling a $900 debt
that has been outstanding for a pe
riod of years, is practically a super
human job—well Daugherty did it,
and then some.
So Fontius, a fine upstanding man
no doubt, gets the job of student
manager for another year, on account
of he already has a year of fine up
standing experience in the office.
Okay, Fontius, you've got your j
gravy now! Okay, Masters, you've j
slung your ladle around in it! But
here's one cookie that thinks you've j
tossed out a pretty grim mess for j
the campus to swallow.
