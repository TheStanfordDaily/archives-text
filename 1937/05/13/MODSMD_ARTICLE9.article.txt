### 
Seniors who failed to order pro
grams and announcements during
the regular period of sale may still
secure them for a limited time,
Committee Chairman Bob Lake said
yesterday.
Orders may be placed at the
A.S.S.U. office, at standard prices of
$1 for programs and 10 cents for
announcements.- The booklets will
probably be delivered about June 1.
