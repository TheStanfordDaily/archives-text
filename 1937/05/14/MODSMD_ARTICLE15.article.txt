# Warns Against Mediocre Films
## Art Instructor Requests Good Campus Movies 
### 
Unless pictures superior to those
I shown in commercial theaters arc
! screened in Memorial Hall, the cam
j pus movie showings proposed by Ex
! Committee are worthless, in the
! opinion of Daniel M. Mendelowitz,
j instructor in Motion Picture Appre
; ciation.
He recommended old and new for
i eign pictures of unusual merit, old
\ American pictures recognized as
I cinematic landmarks, and only those
j new films whose merit justifies their
exhibition at a University.
SILENTS LAUDED
Experience in his movie course
has proved that silent pictures hold
! just as much audience appeal as
' talkies after the first few minutes
,of the showing, Mr. Mendelowitz
I said. He classed them merely as a
! different form of the art.
Foreign films would be able to at
! tract an audience by offering the
j lure of a foreign culture, according
ito Phil Brown, prominent campus
actor.
FIRST-RUNS IMPOSSIBLE
Dramatic office officials stated that
| showing first-run films in the series
iis impossible because of biock
( bookings and competition with Palo
j Aho theaters.
However, all the old pictures of the
major companies of Hollywood will
! be available in addition to nurner
! ous educational features, especially
i about engineering and scientific
I topics.
I Among pictures suggested for

| er," "All Quiet on the Western
j Front," Rene Clair's "Le Million,"
! Sergei Eisenstein's "Potemkin,"
| Charlie Chaplin pictures, and D. W.
I Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" and
J "Intolerance."
i Mr. Mendelowitz recommended
i that films should not be shown on
jthe campus more than once every

I of unusual merit are available."
