# Best' Sound Set Planned For Theater
## Amplifier Horns May Be Transformed to Stage Of Frost Amphitheater 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Stanford will have the most mod
ern motion picture equipment
available in its ne»v theater.
Projection and sound machines of
'he most modern type are being
jpehially designed for Memorial
Hall. The sound system can also be
used in the Laurence Frost Amphi
theater by transfer of the amplifier
horns.
All equipment was designed espe
cially for the theater by C. R. Skin
ner. president of the Skinner Manu
.acturing Company of San Francisco
ind an alumnu? of the Stanford
School of Engineering. Mr. Skinner
is;■ specialist in this field and did
graduate work at the University in
Ihe communications division under
Professor Frederick Terman.
I- OR COMMENCEMENT
Special equipment, designed espe
cially for the amphitheater by the
Western Electric Sound for Public
Address and installed for demonstra
tion purposes at the request of the
C. E. Langevin Company of San
Francisco, will be used at the dedica
tion of the bowl and commencement
exercises Juno 13. These amplifiers,
declared flawless for their purpose
by their manufacturer, are merely
being tried out. If they prove prac
tical and the Lauience Frost Am
phitheater is used frequently enough
after its opening, they may be pur
chased by the University.
In the meantime the system from
the main theater can be used with
slight adjustments, although it was
designed primarily for indoor use.
The high fidelity sound heads have
been manufactured by R.C.A., and
after the equipment has been in
stalled expert technicians will make
final adjustments for use in the au
ditorium.
NEW PROJECTORS
Ihe two 35-millimeter projectors
are the new Wanzel Ace Simplex
type with special non-vibrating
bases. An auxiliary motor genera
tor and a motor developing 15 horse
power have also been purchased.
Equipment to show 16 millimeter
films may be purchased later, espe
cially since many visual education
films are of this she. This equip
ment is portable and may be us«d in
the little theater in Memorial Hal!
where a projection booth has been
provided. However, regular pictures
will not be shown there becausc the
theater is too small for sound and
the 35-millimeter equipment can
not be moved.
DAYLIGHI TYPE
The s"ieen is the latest "daylight"
type, measuring 21 by 28 feet. It
has a fiat white perforated surface,
:nd is i oninflamuir.ble. It is pos
sible that a glass bt aded screen may
be substituted before the opening of
the theater.
Movie equipment that is being
used in Memorial Hall at present
will be transferred to a little the
ater with a capacity of 500 in the
new Cubberley Education Building.
It consists of an old sound machine
with a modern sound head, an au
tomatic turntable, and rewinds
which enabled the first continuous
movie to be given on the campus
when it was purchased for the
Graphic Arts course in motion pic
ture appreciation. Previously a de
lay for changing reels was necessary.
