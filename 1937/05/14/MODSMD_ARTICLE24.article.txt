# Indians Send 22 Man Track Team To Fresno Relays
## Templeton's Men To Enter All Relays, Five Field Events in Revenge Attempt Against Trojans 
### WALT PETERSON 
No matter which way you look at it, this Fresno Relays business to
morrow afternoon and night in tire valley city is a natural.
As for team competition, Stanford gets another crack at the mighty
Trojans after having lost a heartbreaker dual contest lust week in the last
two events of a sizzling afternoon. They gave Dink's boys a chance against

♦the Cromwell crew last week, ami
justly so; they do it again this week,
and iustly so.
When you get to individual com
petition, where else in this cockeyed
old country are you going to find 1 he
equal of the Meadows-Sefton polc
i vault argument, the Reynolds-
Francis shot-put tussle, the Terry-
Todd javelin battle, the Bright -
I Robinson 1000-yard footrace, or a
list of outstanding relays that the
Raisin City will boast tomorrow?
FOUR-MAN 440 RELAY
Now take that sprint relay—if you
j don't take it somebody else will, be
cause three Trojans of four who set
i a new world's record last year in the
440 baton test are back this year,
with a new playmate, to take a crack
at that mark of 40.7. Adrian Talley,
| George Boone, Clark Crane, and
newcomer Payton Jordan in Foy
Draper's place are the four light
looted sprinters who will whiz for
the boys.
They'll get a little competition
from Stanford and from California,
for while bolh of these schools may
not have any present world record
breakers, they can field four pretty
fast men each. The Card team of
Kneubuhl, Malott, Hiserman, and
Weiershauser turned in a 41.7 last
I night, and while Carew may run in
place of Malott, that will be a pretty
fast team.
INDIANS STRONG IN SSO
The 880 relay looks very much the
same, with the exception that the
Indian team will be a little stronger
in this one than in the 440. Malott
is substituted for Kneubuhl, while
•the Trojans will run the same quar
tet. California probably will run
Pollock, Anderson, Trumbly, and
Dowdakin or Frick in both of the
! short relays.
Stanford will stand the best
chances in the mile, two-mile, and
| medley races, especially in the
former since McCurdy, Malott, Hew
itt, and Weiershauser ran 3:14.9 in
practice Wednesday afternoon. That
puts them just a little in front of the
strong U.C.L.A. outfit of Young,
Calleiri. Kiefer, and Grimes, which
has a best mark this year of 3:1(5.1,
: in competition.
