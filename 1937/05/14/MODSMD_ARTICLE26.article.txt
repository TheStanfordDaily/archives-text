# Spanish Mine Bombs British Boat; 8 Killed
## Hole Torn in Destroyer Hunter; International Difficulties Foreseen 
### 
GIBRALTAR, May 13 (U.R).— I The
British destroyer Hunter was badly
damaged, eight of her crew were
reported killed and 12 others in
jured today in an explosion, sup
posedly caused when she struck a
rebel mine five miles off the southern
Spanish coast.
Th<> British Admiralty said the
cause of the explosion was un
known but the Loyalist Spanish gov
ernment at Valencia said the Hun
ter struck a mine.
The explosion occurred five miles
off Alrneria, Spanish Loyalist port
midway between Malaga and Valen
cia.
TROUBLE IMMINENT
A serious international ' situation
may arise if it is determined that the
Hunter, a 1,340-ton warship, hit a
rebel mine two miles outside the
limits of Spanish territoi'ial waters.
Great Britain repeatedly has
warned Genei*al Francisco Franco,
rebel generalissimo, that any inter
ference with the British flag on the
high seas would bring stern re
prisals.
Franco's Insurgent navy has
planted mines around every Loyalist
port—with the exception of Barce
lona and Valencia where "neutral
zones" have been established—in an
effort to force them into submission.
The Admiralty, immediately after
learning of the explosion aboard the
Hunter, flashed orders to the de
stroyers Hardy and Hyperion at Gi
braltar to proceed to Almeria and
.stand by the Hunter.
DESTROYER DAMAGED
The Hunter, towed to port by the
Spanish Loyalist destroyer Lazaga,
has a large hole in her bow.
The damaged destroyer was
launched in 1936. Armed with four
guns of 4.7-inch size, six smaller
rifles, and eight torpedo tubes, she
was assisting the warships of four
neutral powers — Great Britain,
France, Germany, and Italy—in pa
trolling the Spanish coasts to en
force the international non-inter
vent on plan.
Ths estimate of eight killed and
12 injured aboard the Hunter was
not confirmed by naval authorities
here.
