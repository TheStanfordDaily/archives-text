# Convalescent Drive Makes $6,000 Profit
## Sophomore Carnival Tops As Profit Maker; Halaby Praises Student Spirit 
### 
With a profit of more than $6000
tucked safely away, 1937's Conval
escent Home Drive has retired into
Stanford history. Jeeb Halaby,
drive chairman, announced yester
day that proceeds total $0,047.81.
This year's mark is only $1000
short of last year's, $3000 of which
came from the Masque Ball King-
Queen contest, abolished this
spring.
Rated by Halaby above the money
involved was the attitude of the
student body toward the drive. In
a letter to The Daily the chairman
stated, "The Drive showed that hun
dreds of students were willing to
forego a little personal pleasure to
make others happy—to give 'days of
sunshine'."

activities came from the Sophomore
