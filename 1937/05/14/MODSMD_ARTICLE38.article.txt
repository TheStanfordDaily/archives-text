# Moser Retires As Professor Of Engineering
## Received First Practical Experience When Farm Repaired Quake Ruin 
### HERBERT ALWARD 
Professor Charles Moser of Civil
Engineering, secretary of the School
of Engineering, will retire from ac
tive participation in his classes at
the end of this year in order to
"change a lot of things that were
mistakes in the first place."
Young Charlie Moser obtained his
first engineering experience in 1906
when Stanford first started to re
assemble itself after Ihe earthquake.
At that time, Dr. W. F. Durand,
Dr. C. D. Marx, and Charles B.
Wing, now emeritus but then active
members of the faculty, called sev
eral of the students to their aid.
ACTIVE CIVII. ENGINEER
Under his guidance, the water
mains were repaired, the old
straightaway at Angell Field was
constructed, the old football bowl
was built, several tennis courts
vvere laid, and the first Encina swim
ming pool was excavated.
Many evidences of his work have
been covered by time, but one re
mains. When Stanford needed a new
track in 1935, Professor Moser was
asked to construct what has since
become known as the "best outdoor
track in the world."

He first received a degree in en
gineering from Ohio Northern Uni
versity and then came to the Pa
cific Coast with a desire to "see the
country." In 1908 he received an
A.B. here, and became a member of
the teaching staff and an assistant
in the engineering laboratories.
AUTHORITY ON MATERIALS
Throughout his career, Professor
Moser has always been most inter
ested in the materials of the labora
tories and in their development here
at the university.
Several years ago, the American
Welding Society commissioned him
to run some high-temperature ex
periments in welding, and financed
his work through their research in
come.
At present, Professor Moser is in
tent on a study of the hollow mason
ry units which are in general use in
industrial architecture today. On
his retirement, he will continue to
work in his own laboratory and at
tempt to improve those of the uni
versity, which, he belfeves, are in
rlire need of it.
