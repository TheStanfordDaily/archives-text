# Family Seeks Control of Duke

### 
LONDON, May 13 (U.R). â€” King
j George VI tonight sent a stern "royal
! command" to his brother in exile,
i informing the Duke of Windsor that
the royal family will have something
to say about where he and Mrs. Wal
lis Warfield may live after their
marriage.
Edward was told, politely but firm
ly, that his royal birth still binds him
fast to some of the restrictions that
led him to abandon his throne so
that he might find happiness with
"the woman I love."
The king, a happy monarch with
the adulation of his coronation day
still ringing in his ears, turned from
the glory to the power of hi;; crown
ing to send the stern message to
his headstrong brother.
Edward and his American-born
fiancee have leased a honeymoon
villa in the Austrian mountains, but
neither tho king nor the government
intends to let them live there be
cause Central Europe is regarded as
a potential trouble spot.
On the other hand the king was
involved with Edward's critics within
the government who insist, that the
wedding ceremony by which Mrs.
Warfield will become the Duchess
of Windsor be ignored by the royal
family.
The king, in graciousness to the
brother whose romance thrust him
upon the throne he had "under
j studied" but never expected to oc-
I cupy, wants to send some member of
J the royal family to the wedding, if it
j is a church ceremony.
Michigan has passed a law forbid
j ding the sale of most varieties of
| game fish.
