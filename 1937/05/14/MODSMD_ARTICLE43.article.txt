### 
LOS ANGELES, May 13 (UP). â€”
Bobby Riggs of Los Angeles left last
night for New York and a tryout with
(he American Davis Cup team, but
before he departed he gave critics
.something to think about when he
defeated Jiro Yamagishi of Japan in
straight sets, (j-3, 6-1.
The 19-year-old youngster had no
trouble in dismissing the captain
and ace of the Nippon squad, who
was a stubborn foe for Frank
Parker, No. 2 singles man for the
United States, in the zone matches
in San Francisco recently.
Certain seats in the balcony in
Stanford's Assembly Hall face away
from the stage rather than toward it.
