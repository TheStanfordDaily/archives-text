Commenting upon his appointment
Wednesday to a second term as stu
dent manager, Chuck Fontius yes
terday said: "It was a surprise to me
since I didn't think I would have a
Chinaman's chance to get it. Of
cour.se, I'm very much pleased to
continue with the job."
Fontius, who was chosen by Grad
uate Manager Alfred Masters from a
list of candidates that also included
Dick Daugherty and Jerry Brown,
is the second student manager in the
history of the A.S.S.U. to serve two
terms.
Few changes in policies are an
ticipated in the coming school year,
Fontius said. "It is hard to work out
general policies ahead of time," he
stated. Most changes, he added, will
be along the line of clarification and
improvement of the operation of the
Students' Organizations Fund.
"There is a need at the present
time to popularize the rules of the
Organizations Fund among the man
agers of the various student organi
zations," he said. "As it is now, it
is a slow educational process which
usually takes effect only after mis
takes have been made by an organi
zation." During summer quarter,
Fontius plans to work out a method
to remedy this problem.
1037-TJB student budget will be
drawn up and presented to Ex Com
mittee within the next two weeks,
Fontius said yesterday. He urges
managers of student organizations to
bring their estimates to him by Sat
urday, if possible. The budget will
be approximately the same as this
year, around $10,000, he stated.
