SINCE THE MILE relay team of [
! Malott, Hewitt, McCurdy, and Weier
| shauser ran 3:14.9 in practice Wed
j nesday night, it begins to look as j
I though Stanford is definitely going I
! to win that race at Fresno Saturday. ;
I U.C.L.A. has a pretty fair outfit in
j Young, Grimes, Calleiri, and Kiefer
i —good enough, in fact, to have turn- ;
1 ed in the fastest competitive time on !
i the Coast this year at 3:36.1 —and it 1
fceat Stanford in the dual meet this I
! year in a slow 3:20.4.
The Bruins will have to run
fairly fast, though, to win this
| time, because their win before is
l n't going td mean very much.
Dink didn't run a winning team
against U.S.C., either, but don't
think he wouldn't have done so if
the relay meant the meet. He ran
♦ Hyde to get his letter, for Gordy
had tough luck before the Big Meet
by getting a cramped muscle and
couldn't go in that one. He turned
i out a good quarter in the Trojan
meet, and it looked as though he <
might have recovered, so Dink ;
I took a chance and put hiin in the
I relay to earn the letter. If that
: leg hadn't tied up, he would have }
! earned it, too.
If Dink # had had to win that re- !
j lay he would have run Mahurin, |
! instead of taking a chance with
! Gordy and his game leg, but as it j
! was Carl already had his block from
; the Big Meet and from the half ear- j
j lier in the U.S.C. affair, so Gordy j
i deserved the chance.
j Incidentally, Cousin Brick Morse |
j mentioned something yesterday in .
! his column in one of the S.F. dailies |
: to the effect that the only point of i
I criticism of Templeton in that Tro
i jan meet was his selection of the
crippled Hyde to run that relay. He
j said Dink should have run Hewitt. J
i The explanation given above ought
j to take care of Cousin Morse's gripe,
j and Mahurin can run a faster 440 j
than Hewitt, anyway.
JIM REYNOLDS STEPS into the j
best shot-putting company in the
j country again when he meets Sam ,
Francis, of Nebraska in the Relays J
shotput. Francis is quite capable,
you see, but Jim is no small potatoes
himself and is still on the improve.
! James won the event last year at
51 feet 1% inches, and he's liable to
be pretty close to that mark again
I this year, even with that five weeks'
| layoff.
Speaking of what Reynolds did
last year brings to mind some of
j the other marks set in the Relays j
last spring, when Stanford tied the ;
mighty Trojans 64-G4. One of the
' most remarkable things, in light [

of recent developments, is the fact
that Earle Meadows took fifth place
in the pole vault at the terrific
ally-low-hefght-for-him-of 13 feet.
Sefton won the event at 14 feet,
while Hooker and Day of U.S.C.
and Mauger of the Olympic Club
tied for second at 13-9. U.S.C. had
a monopoly of pole vaulters there,
too, with four out of live places.
Ray Dean surprised a lot of folks
by winning the 100 over Mushy
Pollock, too, in 9.8. Leland LaFond,
Troy hurdler, was a sprinter last
year, it seems, because he took third,
and the mighty Milton "Dubby" Holt
of Fresno, supposed to be one of
the best, was fourth. The old Pride
of Pago-Pago, Jimmy Kneubuhl, was
fifth.
There were a couple of relay
marks that were pretty good—the
Trojans set world's records in both
440 and mile relays, running one
tenth of a second under the world
mark of 40.X in the quarter-mile,
and eh(f}>ping a full second off the
Eastman - Shove - Ilables-Hahles
mile record of 3:12.(i. That sprint
team was a beauty, with TaJley,
Boone, Crane, and while
Johnson, Cassin, Smallwood, and
Fitch in the longer one were a
great quartet of 440 men, if there
ever was a great quartet.
The Trojans lost just one of those
sprinters, little Foy Draper, but they
lost the whole crew of quarter
milers, three through graduation and

Smallwood through injury. Still
I Lhey keep right on having track
teams, like nobody's business.
