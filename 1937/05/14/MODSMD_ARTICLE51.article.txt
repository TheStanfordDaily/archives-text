# Horses Picked For Preakness
## War Admiral, Pompoon To Meet Again 
### 
BALTIMORE. Md„ May 13 (U.R).—
A select field of nine and possibly
I ten was forecast today for Saturday's
47th renewal of the $50,000 added
Preakness Stakes.
Many horsemen believe that the
[ race will be a two-horse affair be
tween War Admiral, Samuel D. Rid
dle's Kentucky Derby winner, and
Jerome H. Louchheim's Pompoon,
i which finished second.
Sternest contention may come
from V/alter M, Jeffords Matey
which, like War Admiral, is a son
! of Man o' War. Matey was given his
final trial yesterday, running a mile
' and a quarter (Preakness distance
is a mile and three-sixteenths) in
2:10 2-5 under a slight breeze. War
Admiral also got in his last work,
doing a mile and a furlong in 1:56
2-5, running smoothly, while Pom
poon, hard held throughout, did the
same distance in 1:57 2/5.
The other six probable starters are
Mrs. Julia M. Loft's Mosawtre, Miss
E. G. Rand's Merrymaker, Joe W.
! Brown's Jewell Dorsett, Mrs. H. C.
Phipps' Melodist, John Hay Whit
ney's Flying Scott, and Samuel D.
; Riddle's Over the Tod.
