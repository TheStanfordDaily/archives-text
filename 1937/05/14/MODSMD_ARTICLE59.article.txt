# Golfer Sinks Ace For Birdie on No. 8
## 
### 
Though Roger Williams, San Ma
teo newspaperman, made a hole-in
one out on the Stanford golf course
last Wednesday, his score card
showed a birdie two. Mr. Williams
was unlucky enough to hit the
first tee shot out of bounds. The
second one went right into the cup.
The "golfer's eternal hope" was
accomplished on the 140-yard eight
hole with a pitch shot.
