# Gripes, Sublimated
## 
### 
PUT all student gripes about Stanford into
a big book, and what have you? A collec
tion of fuzzy thoughts, criticisms absolutely
worthless because they are made without
knowledge of the things criticized.
But if you took that book in manuscript form,
stripped away criticisms obviously without
valid foundation, fairly presented those with
merit, you'd have a valuable compendium of
student reaction.
This is the thesis of Senior Class President
Mort D'Evelyn, who is working with his class
to leave more than a fountain or a plaque. '37's
legacy v/ill be supplemented by a last will and
testament that will deal kindly, but justly, with
a dead chapter in Stanford's history.
The job is more than a big one: it has never
been done before, at least within the hand-me
down recollections of '37-ers.
But it is probably the most valuable labor
any senior class has undertaken.
Historically, seniors are sentimental idiots.
So in love with Stanford, so regretful on leav
ing it, they naturally tend to drown Stanford's
defects under the emotions of tears and parting.
Historically, heavy-duty criticism comes not
from the graduating class, most cognizant of
Stanford's faults, but from hot-headed frosh or
moribund sophs, who know least of the "why"
about undergraduate and administrative de
fects.
But the seniors this year are going to violate
history. From their four years here they are
going to distil v/hat they believe to be the really
valuable critical elixirs.
The finished report will be presented to the
Board of Trustees, through Dr. Wilbur, accord
ing to tentative plans of the Senior Executive
Committee.
The idea is not griping for the gripe's sake,
but constructive criticism for the University's
sake, based on the premise that tomorrow's
alumnus, who can help Stanford, is today's stu
dent.
