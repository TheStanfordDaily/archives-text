# A 						Four-Star Scenario
## 
### 
WITH two strikes on him as the result of
fall quarter's Pajamarino and Sergeant Da
kin's torn pants, Ex-Committeeman Bob Mallett
couldn't do much more with Paly theaters than
pour on the oil.
He did. And the result is that balcony seats
will still cost 40 cents, that students can pa
jama on theater property if they will promise
to leave the theater.
But just below the Art Gallery is a little
number called Memorial Hall, not only a the
ater, but one with talking picture projection
cameras.
Which made inevitable the inevitable sug
gestionâ€”our own movies in our own movie
house.
The idea is fascinating, even to the most ana
lytic Ex-Committeemen who Tuesday helped
appoint a committee to work on it.
Meanwhile, the thought grows that some ap
parently insuperable obstacles to campus mov
ies may not be as apparent as they appear.
While commercial block - booking by Paly
houses might make impossible the showing of
new pictures, even if available at necessarily
reduced rates, there's the possibility of re-runs
of old but outstanding films we'd all like to
see again.
While the distributors might object, pointing
out that their leasing of films to Stanford would
automatically wreak hardship on Paly theaters,
campus performances could hardly be held

more often than one night a week.
And besides, studios aren't blind to the value
of good will. Giving Stanford old and commer
cially worthless pictures would make a com
mercially worth-while hit with students, some
of whom may be civic leaders in the future.
Further reassurance to distributors who must
protect their clients' interests might be arranged
by the exclusion at the door of all but students
and faculty.
Campus movies would do more to keep Stan
ford a truly resident University, for something
other than studying, sleeping and eating, than
any other one thing.
And they would make a weekly movie a #
certainty for those who juggle forty cents with
care, but who would easily spend a dime.
From where we're sitting, the idea is a four
star production, even if it is still just a scenario.
