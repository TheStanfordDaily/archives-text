r I' , HE Biology Building, haunt of many freshmen, also
reveals wild tales of older students. Scarcely in
tending a social jaunt, a small group went (here one
night and started prowling about the premises. The
only room they could find open was near the roof
and piled knee deep with dust and over-ripe equip
ment. Among the other gadgets found was a bicycle
with only one wheel.
Appropriating this and a companion for the other
wheel, the playmates began to run around the room
and have fun. Before long an apparently deaf and
blind night-watchman came along and closed the
door, clicking the latch at the same time. Nonplussed,
the student intellects sat down to ponder the situa
tion, entitled: "How Can We Get Out?" or ' The Mys
tery of the Locked Door."
Finally our friends decided to turn on the light.
They did, and lo and behold the door latch was on
the inside. They turned out thu light and went home
singing.
When one of Stanford's younger first started to
smoke, he took great delight in playing with matches.
He was continually moved with impulses to set fire to
everything he saw, including himself wTien he looked
in the mirror.
One day, he could resist the devil no longer. He
set fire to his dog. Then he showed how efficient he
was. He put the fire out before more than three
fourths of the dog's tail feathers had disappeared in
smoke.
A PROFESSOR in Stanford's mathematics depart
ment was recently proudly announcing the fact
that he was a proud father of a fine, healthy nine-and
a-half-pound son and passing out the cigars. As he
had supplied himself well with the North Carolina
variety of Manila, he decided his students deserved a
treat of the same nature.
Unfortunately it was quiz day that week, and he
couldn't make much of a speech. So instead, he made
a little announcement and left his box of cigars on
the desk. When he returned at the end of the hour,
there was the traditionally polite last cigar left in the
cigar box.
Profiting by the experience, he left exactly the
proper number of cigars in the box the next time, no
handfuls for the nine-o'clockcrs. One was left any
way. Awful polite, Stanford!
If you want to sec the world, don't join the Navy,
go to the Tuesday Evening Lecture the rest of the
year.

that he was a proud father of a fine, healthy nine-and
a-half-pound son and passing out the cigars. As he
had supplied himself well with the North Carolina
variety of Manila, he decided his students deserved a
treat of the same nature.
Unfortunately it was quiz day that week, and he
couldn't make much of a speech. So instead, he made
a little announcement and left his box of cigars on
the desk. When he returned at the end of the hour,
there was the traditionally polite last cigar left in the
cigar box.
Profiting by the experience, he left exactly the
proper number of cigars in the box the next time, no
handfuls for the nine-o'clockcrs. One was left any
way. Awful polite, Stanford!
If you want to sec the world, don't join the Navy,

r I' , HE Biology Building, haunt of many freshmen, also
reveals wild tales of older students. Scarcely in
tending a social jaunt, a small group went (here one
night and started prowling about the premises. The
only room they could find open was near the roof
and piled knee deep with dust and over-ripe equip
ment. Among the other gadgets found was a bicycle
with only one wheel.
Appropriating this and a companion for the other
wheel, the playmates began to run around the room
and have fun. Before long an apparently deaf and
blind night-watchman came along and closed the
door, clicking the latch at the same time. Nonplussed,
the student intellects sat down to ponder the situa
tion, entitled: "How Can We Get Out?" or ' The Mys
tery of the Locked Door."
Finally our friends decided to turn on the light.
They did, and lo and behold the door latch was on
the inside. They turned out thu light and went home
singing.
When one of Stanford's younger first started to
smoke, he took great delight in playing with matches.
He was continually moved with impulses to set fire to
everything he saw, including himself wTien he looked
in the mirror.
One day, he could resist the devil no longer. He
set fire to his dog. Then he showed how efficient he
was. He put the fire out before more than three
fourths of the dog's tail feathers had disappeared in
smoke.
A PROFESSOR in Stanford's mathematics depart
ment was recently proudly announcing the fact
that he was a proud father of a fine, healthy nine-and
a-half-pound son and passing out the cigars. As he
had supplied himself well with the North Carolina
variety of Manila, he decided his students deserved a
treat of the same nature.
