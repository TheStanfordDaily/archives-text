L'ENVOI
"C'NGLAND'S crown having been set somewhat askew
on the ears of George VI, the captains and the
kings arc legging it back to their own bailiwicks. The
shouting and the tumult dies. And in America, a dis
contented grumble becomes audible. Chambers of
commerce grouse that the coronation has received too
much publicity; that our business has suffered; that
this is most un-American.
• They throw the blame on the already burdened
shoulders of the press.

Business men complain in pained voices that we
are making fools of ourselves over a foreign king;
protest that we are being unpatriotic and undemo
cratic. They snarl that the newspapers are seducing us
from our grand old tradition that monarchs are useful
only for demonstrations of profanity. And they moan
that "something ought to be done." (
News that should muzzle such grouchers — but
won't—came in yesterday. It reads: "Rome, May 12
(UP). —Nothing about the coronation of King George
VI or any other British news appeared in Italian papers
today."
* * * *
/ OBVIOUSLY, Italy has done something, and done it
very effectively. Italians spent no money on the
coronation; but if reports are correct, Italian business
men are not singing hosannas. The same Caesar's
Ghost that haunts naughty newspapers stands rebel
lious financiers in their own corner.
The Mussolini boom in Italy demonstrates nicely
what happens when a clever man takes advantage of
the latent hero worship present in every populace.
It has been pointed out that there arc two classes of
people: the quality, and the equality. The equality
likes to pat itself indirectly on the back by exalting
someone ostensibly its representative.
Americans like to work up a lather about the coro
nation because underneath they feel that the monarch
is in no way superior to them. When a clerk notices
that George is just not built for. knee pants, his ego
swells.
When newspapers whip up enthusiasm for the coro
nation, they provide a painless way for the American
public to let ofT steam. They do the same thing when
they boom aviators, football players, or hog callers.
But business howls savagely that the press is taking
money out of the country, that it is breaking down
our grand American spirit.
* «tt * $
W/TIEN woolen-headed pressure groups yelp that the
press stop working up enthusiasm for foreign he
roes they pave the way for a man on horseback who
will know how to exploit our bottled up emotion.
It is hard to imagine anything more pitifully fool
ish than a chamber of commerce which carols the
praises of liberty and individualism with one breath,
and with the next complains that enthusiasm about
foreign events should be discouraged. Italy, Germany,
and Russia keep their enthusiasm very much at home.
But they have experienced no mass immigration of
chambers of commerce.
When America lets off steam over an English
coronation there is just that much less chance that
our hero worship will back a local version of Musso
lini. And so Cod save the King, and the press.
