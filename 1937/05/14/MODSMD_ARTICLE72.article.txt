# CAMPUS OPINION
## GRIPES AT GRIPER'S GRIPING 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Obviously written by a highly
prejudiced friend of a defeated can
didate for student manager, this
morning's campus opinion missed
fire completely.
Beating around a too-high bush,
"Griped" neither offered any real
reason why Chuck Fontius should
not have been reappointed, nor did
it make any constructive suggestion
as to a substitute method of ap
pointment.
Based on Professor Harold Hand's
theorem that efficiency is not alone a
justification for student government,
the letter ignored the fact that stu
dent manager is not, in the true
sense, part of student government.
Rather, that position is the adminis
tration's only check against too
flighty elective officers.
Student manager is, hovvever, sup
posed to be well acquainted with
student needs and sympathetic with
student desires. In the past this at
titude has been assured by appoint
ing men fresh from undergraduate
life, and therefore cognizant of un
dergraduate attitudes.
This year, Mr. Masters, in seeking
to maintain a higher margin of effi
ciency, has chosen to risk sacrificing
this sympathetic harmony by ap
pointing a man who has been on the
managing side of the fence for four
years.
Is it not probable that in this time
he has drifted into an attitude con
trary to the desires of the student
body as a whole? Is it not likely
that Fontius will hold efficiency at a
maximum and student desires at a
minimum?
A possible suggestion to this prob
lem is that the University appoint a
permanent student manager. Rec
ommended last year by Bob Gros,
this system would lead toward the
greatest possible efficiency—but it
would also tend to slash student lib
erty and student initiative.
Best solution, so far as the A.S.S.U.
is concerned, is to continue as in
the past—appointing for a term of
one year, a student fresh from un
dergraduate activities.
