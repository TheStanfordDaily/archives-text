# ABOUT TUESDAY VS. FRIDAY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While we're talking about the
Tuesday Lecture Scries, why not
see what other schools have been
doing along that line? My own ex
perience is limited to one other
school, but it seems to> me that they
have something worth looking at.
They have a series of lectures,
about 6 to 10 per year, for which
tickets are sold much the same as
season tickets to the Concert Series
here. The price is around three dol
lars. For this sum, students can hear
lectures by such people as Admiral
Byrd, Amelia Earhart, Osa Johnson,
Gertrude Stein, Carl Sandburg,
Thornton "Wilder, and many other
notables in the political, economic,
and social fields.
These people are the people who
are known to and who interest the
students. They impart the most vital
kind of culture, the culture of today
as seen by the cultural leaders of
today. At the same time they can
give what they have in a fashion
which packs them in, and leaves
them lying in the aisles. Or at least,
student enthusiasm is manifested.
Stanford has a new theater which

is going to be too small for our Con
cert Series. It would be the only
place which could and should house
such a lecture series: anyway, there
is little use considering such a thing
if, at the outset, you are visializing
the little theater. It would take a
lot of work at the beginning tu put
the thing over, and financial backing.
But the Concert Series started on a
shoestring. Nor do I think that the
presence of- both on the campus
would be a conflict â€”this college I
am describing also has a Concert
Series, and even larger one than
ours.
The elaborative planning neces
sary to put the idea over is prob
ably prohibitive at the outset; but
the attitude seems to have been that
the Tuesday Lecture is the only
thing which can be done along that
line, and that we will just have to
stand it or sit it out until divine aid
comes to our rescue.
I for one would pay to hear those
people mentioned at the beginning
of this, and I think there are enough
others who, if pressed by a little
campaigning, would too.
