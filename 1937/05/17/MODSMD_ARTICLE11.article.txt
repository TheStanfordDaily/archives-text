# Stunt Flying Costs Farm Men $1500
## 
### GORDY FROST 
The roar of airplanes low over
Stanford — the glance of a Depart
ment of Commerce chief inspector
coincidentally dining at a Stanford
home—and today three Stanford
airmen are cursing both bad luck
and poor judgment to the tune of
three $500 fines and three license
suspensions.
Friday evening the three flyers in
rented planes were loafing along
over the Farm, then decided to cut
low, wave to friends and "make a
little noise," as they put it. In for
mation they winged-over, skimmed
within the 1000-foot restricted area,
playfully gunned motors, and then
raced off.
Next day they weix- in Oakland,

appearing before Chief Inspector
R. D. Bedinger, who had risen from
his scat at a Stanford dinner party
the night before to watch the three
planes unsuspectingly go through
their antics.
But even more ironically, Bedinger
had just walked in the office from a
routine inspection near Milpitas
Saturday afternoon where two stu
dents had crashed an unlicensed
"flying coffin" into a field. He had
just seen the two bodies lifted from
the old monocoupe, just looked at
the dead faces, surveyed the wreck,
and entered his report.
Without sympathy he dealt out
maximum penalties for Stanford';:
three who were charged with flying
low (under 1000 feet) in populated

areas, and with flying in close for
mation, a violation of the ruling
which prevents any plane from
maneuvering within 300 feet of an
other ship.
As an example to others the top
penalty was laid —-$500 apiece, and
license suspension probably for a
period of six months, although defi
nite notice of length of suspension
has not bcqn given. The department
has the licenses, will return them
when it feels ready.
Meanwhile. Stanford's flyers won
der where $1500 in fines is going to
come from—and why the chief in
spector of this area happened to
drop down for dinner at Stanford
