# Lopez Music Sets Record Prom Profit
## 
### 
One of the largest dance profits in
Stanford history—s297.44—tinkled in
to the Class of '38 treasury Friday
night after 490 couples paid $1715 to
hear Vincent Lopez play for the
Junior Prom.
Lopez' 20 bandsmen arrived here
Friday morning for their first west
ern engagement in three years.
They were shown about the campus
that afternoon.
Saturday morning Lopez and his
five headliners took the plane for
Los Angeles while the rest motored
to Santa Cruz. After a national
broadcast with Grace Moore that
afternoon they flew north again for
an evening engagement.
Like most big-time leaders, Lopez
has a total orchestra of 35, alternates
musicians on different engagements.
Wayne Richardson, prom chair
man, last night compared Lopez's
showing with Jimmy Dorsey's at
last year's Junior Prom. Though
Dorsey cost $100 less than Lopez's
$1000, his dance lost $83.
