# Date Conflict May Ding Barn Dance
## 
### 
More obstacles than a few bales
of hay face the annual Barn Dance
given by the San Francisco Aux
iliary of Stanford's Convalescent
Home, originally planned for two
weeks ago, but dinged by the hotel
strike called at that time.
Tentatively planned for next Fri
day night at the Palace Hotel, the
dance must await settlement of the
strike, which has not yet been
reached. If given, it would conflict
with first night presentation of
Barnstormers' show, "Down the
Hatch," many of whose audience it.
would take.
Additional reasons for possible
cancellation of the dance are seen
in the fact that all following Friday
nights are taken up by the Golden
Gate bridge festival, finals, and the
Senior Ball, respectively.
