# Fairclough to Talk On Italian Travel
## 
### 
"Travels in Italy" is the title of
the talk to be given by Dr. Henry R.
Fairclough, professor emeritus of
classical literature, Tuesday at 7:30
in the Little Theater.
Slides of famous cities, monuments
and beauty spots will be used to
illustrate the lecture. Third in the
series of talks being given for the
benefit of students planning to
travel in Europe this summer, the
lecture will give the student some
idea of what he should best see
and how he should see it while in
Italy.
Lectures have already been given
on traveling in Europe in general,
on France, and another lecture will
be given next Thursday by Freder
ick Anderson, Professor of Romanic
languages, on touring through
Europe.
