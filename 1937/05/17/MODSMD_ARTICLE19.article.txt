# Cards Beat Troy, Set New Record At Fresno Relays
## Trackmen Turn Tables in 10-point Win Over S.C.; California Third 
### WALT PETERSON 
Stanford's varsity trackmen pulled back onto the Farm early yester
day afternoon slightly elated and infinitely eased in mind and spirit as
they tugged along the old war sack that had a new world's record in it
and best of all a table-turning victory over the mighty Trojans, from
the spoils of the Fresno Relays of Saturday night.

► There were other great marks
I made in the Relays, especially a new
world record for 1000 yards by El
roy Robinson at 2:09.7, but those
things are minor to Stanford when
you consider that Dink Templeton's
22 men severely laced the team that
j beat them one week earlier in a dual
! meet, U.S.C., G4 to 54 ,/ 2.
FARM MAKES RECORD
The Trojans were supposed to be
just about even with the Cards, but
; they weren't, not quite. Last year
Dean Cromwell's team was supposed
to be much better than Stanford, but
| the best it could do then was a
j 64-64 tie with the Indians. This time
there was too much outside compe-
I tition for U.S.C. in its little duel
; with Stanford, for California cut in
with 40 1 points to draw Troy down
! and leave Stanford high on top, with
the identical total of last year.
The four boys who now can be
pointed out as members of the fast
j est 880-yard relay team in the world
are Jim Kneubuhl, Ray Malott,
j Stan Hiserman, and Jack Weiershau
| ser, for they knocked eight-tenths
i of a second oft' the accepted world
record at that distance, 1:25.8, in
beating U.S.C. by five yards. There
| seems to be some question about
U.S.C. having done 1:24.8 last year,
I but no such mark has been recog-
I nized, while everything is in or
| der with the new Stanford record.
CROMWELL SHIFTS MEN
That was a race that had to be
conceded to U.S.C. before post
time, but when Dean Cromwell
withdrew Adrian Talley for Leland
LaFond, after Talley had two hun
di-eds and a 440 relay lap under his
' belt, and Payton Jordan for Earl
Vickery to save him for the mile
j test later, the Trojans didn't have a
chance. Kneubuhl showed Boone his
; heels for the first lap, Malott had
i too ( much for LaFond, Stan Hiscr
i man gladdened Templeton with his
J third lap, and then the driving
I Weiershauser drew away from
j Crane to finish all alone.
Weiershauser's victory only vin
dicated the win he scored over the
Trojan sprinters a week ago here
j in the 220, and marks him as pos
sibly the fastest white runner in
America at that distance this year.
CAREW UNNERVED
Outside of that relay, Stanford
took second in the 440 relay, and
! then won the mile, two-mile, and
medley tandem races on the track.
Dick Carew showed them he can
percolate a little, too, by taking
third in the open 100, a yard and a
half behind Talley and just six
inches behind California's Pollock.
Five false starts by contestants un
nerved him slightly, and he got a
1 slow start. He either gets a terrific
start or he begins rather late, being
a jump individual.
Zagar and Gribbin threw one-tv/o
in the discus, Big Pete at 152-9 and
Gribbin at 148-5 1 to get back at
■ Gaspar of the Trojans who broke up
I their combination last week. The
Trojan took third ahead of his
teammate Wrotnowski.
! Jim Reynolds couldn't get past,
the left-handed Sam Francis of Ne
braska for first in the shot, doing
50-6 as Francis did 52-10; but he got
credit for the winning points on the
official score sheet since Francis was
ineligible to compete for points. A1
Hershey took fourth behind Owen
Hershey of Troy, the muscular gent
he and Tom Montgomery shut out
in the Card-Trojan dual meet. Mont
gomery failed to place Saturday
night.
