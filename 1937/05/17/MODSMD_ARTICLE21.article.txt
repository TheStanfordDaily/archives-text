# Spain Socialist Cabinet Fails
## Communist Leader Diaz May Become Premier 
### 
VALENCIA, Monday, May 17
! (UP). â€” Premier Francisco Largo
Caballero, 67-year-old Socialist who
: led the Spanish Loyalist government
! through half a dozen crises during
| the last few months of war, told
i President Manuel Azana early to
; day for the second time in 12 hours
! that he can not form a new cabinet.
President Azana, faced with no
other alternative, was expected to
designate Communist Party Secre
, tary Jose Diaz to form a cabinet
| this morning. If appointed and suc
cessful, Diaz would be the first Com
munist to head a government in
Spanish history.
President Azana had asked Diaz
} to support Caballero but the Com
munist replied that his party could
I not back the Premier in his attempt
to be both head of the government
; and war minister. Caballero was told
I of the Communist decision, and tele
phoned President Azana definitely
refusing office.
Caballero's government resigned
Saturday supposedly in an effort to
; reduce anarchist influence in gov-
I ernmental affairs. After agreeing,
lin response to the pleadings of
J President Azana, to form a new gov
ernment, Caballero called confcr
j ences with leaders of the various
| political divisions.
