# Chaplain Discusses Spread of Religion
## 
### 
For yesterday's sermon at the
Memorial Church. Dr. Trueblood
chose "The Incredible Conversion of
the World" as his subject. He
pointed outÂ«that the Christian
Church, in its effort to uphold moral
standards, was largely responsible
for the crowning of George instead
of Edward as the King of England.
The chaplain, taking his text from
the Book of Acts, showed how Chris
tianity has spread. From a small
beginning in which a few worship
pers met in a single room, it has be
come a world-wide institution, he
said.
