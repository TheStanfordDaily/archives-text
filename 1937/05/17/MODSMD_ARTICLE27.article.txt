# Founding of University Recalled on Anniversary
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
It was on May 14, 1887—50 years
ago Friday and the nineteenth birth
day of the son for whose memory
Senator Stanford was building a
university — that the cornerstone
was laid and construction started
for the university that was to open
four years later.
Professor E. E. Robinson of the
history department has collected a
number of contemporary newspa
per clippings telling of the day, and
a complete account of the laying of
the cornerstone is found in Dr. Or
rin L. Elliott's recently published
history, "Stanford University — the
First 25 Years."
Special trains from San Francisco
brought more than 300 people to the
ceremony at the Palo Alto farm.
Only a week before, Architect
Charles A. Coolidge had preliminary
sketches, and Senator Stanford or
dered that construction begin im
mediately.
"An übiquitous photographer"
seems to have repeatedly disrupted
the proceedings of laying the cor
nerstone, with requests that Senator
and Mrs. Stanford pose for pictures
at each stage of the ceremony.
The exercises, described by Dr.
Elliott as "simple in character but
rich in emotional experience," con
sisted of a prayer of dedication by
the Rev. Horatio Stebbins, one of

the trustees; an address by Judge
Lorenzo Sawyer, the president of the
Board of Trustees: the singing of the
Doxology by the choir of the Menlo
Park Presbyterian Church; the read
ing of the Nineteenth Psalm: and the
sealing of the cornerstone by Sena
tor Stanford.
On the following day the San
Francisco Chronicle related in an
editorial the history of Palo Alto
and of Stanford's farm, and com
mented that "there, upon the an
niversary of his son's birth, was yes -
terday laid the foundation of one of
Lhe best endowed universities of the
United States."
