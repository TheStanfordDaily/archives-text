FORT BRAGG. May 14 (UP). —
More than anything else, Abe Trip
lett wanted a comfortable grave. Ho
was afraid the diggers might cram
his six-foot bulk into too small a
space, so he dug a place for himself
to his own specifications. He lined
it with redwood and tended it sev
eral weeks, cleaning out refuse.
Yesterday it looked inviting. He si ot
himself and died.
Encina Gym was opened in 1915,
as were the main buildings of
Stanford Uftion. The Library was
dedicated in 1919.
