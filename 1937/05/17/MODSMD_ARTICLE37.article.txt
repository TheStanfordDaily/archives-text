IT'S REALLY O.K.
FOR THE BOOKS

A lot of the walking record-books
i on the campus here sighed wearily
| Saturday night when Doug Montell
announced from Fresno over KYA
! that the Stanford team of Jimmy
i Kneubuhl, Stan Hiserman, Ray Ma
lott and Jack Weiershauser had set
ja new world's record of 1:25 fiat in
| the four-man 880-yard relay.
They remembered a 1:24.8 turned
|in by a Trojan squad of Draper,
! Parsons, Abbott, and Fitch in 1934.
| But a close perusal of the World
' Almanac shows that one of these
I boys stepped behind his starting line
I in taking a baton pass, and their
time is not good, leaving the mark
of 1:25.8 set by Borah, Smith, Lewis,
and House of the southern school in
1927 as the best official record.
I So Stanford has brought forth a
j "turn-about" on the Trojans.
You will remember that Stanford
J had the mile record of 3:12.6 for a
long time after it was set by Shove,
1 Hables, Hables, and Eastman at
1 Fresno in 1931, and then Fitch. John-
I son, Cassin, and McCarthy of U.S.C.
! took it away by running 3:12.4 in
the summer of 1935. Smallwood re-
I placed McCarthy on that team and
I they made 3:11.6 last year at Fresno
i for the best so far. But it still isn't
j on the books, as records never are
j until long after they're made, and
' sometimes broken again.
Stanford, with Kneubuhl, Malott,
I McCurdy, and Weiershauser running
lin that order, ran 3:12.8 Saturday,
| showing them to be potential world
beatex - s. But that's as far as they
will get this year, as this week's
P.A.A. meet will be run on the
I slow Stadium track, and next week's
j Intercollegiates, together with the
subsequent N.C.A.A.. doesn't sched
' ule a mile relay. The remaining com
| petition this season, the Big Ten
I meet, if it has a mile relay, will have
| entered from the West a hybrid
| squad of the best quarter-milers on
the coast.
Stanford may have several of them
but not all of them.

THEIR MONEY'S WORTH
—TO ALL CONCERNED

Everyone that went clown to the
Raisin City seemed to think the Re
lays to have been the best ever, in
spite of the heat. (Spectators were
in shirtsleeves all evening long.)
Some of it might have been the
marked favoritism shown Stanford
by the crowd, which, fed up with
long years of Trojan victories, was
definitely partisan.
Dink Templeton was trying to tell
some newspaper guys that he was
going to sweep the relay events,
and typical of newspapermen, they
didn't believe him. But he came very
close, with Stanford taking the 880,
mile, two-mile, and medley, drop
ping only the 440. which some ob
servers said the Cards could have
taken if their passing had been a
bit smoother.
Fine $20 Walttham (adv.) gold
wrist watches were given to all first
place men; Stanford sent 21 run
ners to Fresno and brought back 17
watches.
Lap times in the winning two
mile relay were: Alexander 1:57.2,
March 1:56.2, Mahurin 1:57.1, and
McCurdy 1:54.4. For the Medley,
McCall ran 51.5, Mahurin 1:54.8. his
best, Burrows 3:10.6, and Alexander
4:25.7, just fast enough to win. In
the mile relay Kneubuhl 49.9. Ma
lott 47.6, McCurdy 47.9, Weiershau
ser 47.1. It doesn't add up? They
never do, without a little adjust
ment.
Again, as is usual, the small-town
West Coast Relays, to which but
four sizeable schools send delegates,

literally pushed the great Drake and
Penn Carnivals into the creek, with
every one of the relay times set in
Fresno Saturday night the best done
in the three meets. —Klauber
