# And 3½ to Get Ready

W HITE lights glared onto the red clay track
at Fresno Saturday night, and four Stanford
runners circled the 880 yards for a new world's
record. Though all four deserve acclaim, the
last man did more—he proved a point.
The last man's name is Jack Weiershauser.
He ran around a lot at Fresno and did things
in all sorts of fast times, and then after that, ran
his lap of the 220 in 46.9. In short, he ran a lot,
and he ran a lot fast.
That was at Fresno. There is no wind at
Fresno and the track is supposed to be almost
as fast as Angell Field, here at Stanford.
A v/eek ago this man Weiershauser ran a lot
against U.S.C. in the Stadium wind tunnel, not
on Angell Field, because the wind tunnel has
bleachers. But he did not run as fast. The wind
blew the man down. Stanford's victory did a
Margaret Mitchell.
But at Fresno it was different. Fresno's track
is almost as good as Angell Field and it has
bleachers.
The B.A.C.'s twice postponed meeting is
scheduled to finally come off next week.
The little story about Jack is no fairy tale. The
"fastest track in the West" must have bleachers.
