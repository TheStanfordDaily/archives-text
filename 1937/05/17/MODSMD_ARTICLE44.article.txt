# Contribution to Aviation . . .

(From the Daily Trojan)
BOMB-DROPPING, it seems, will be a part of
the program in which six U.S.C. aviators
are entered when they meet Stanford tomorrow
in "the first intercollegiate air meet ever to be
presented on the Pacific Coast."
The other events on the program—spot land
ings and deadstick landings —will afford proof
of the contention that collegiate interest in avia
tion will someday prove extremely valuable to
commercial aviation. But what will the bomb
dropping contest prove?
Will this exercise in sending missiles of death
toward a circle 500 feet below ever foster in the
student aviator any traits which will enhance the
air's safety a decade from now?
Perhaps someone conversant with the ways
of aviation can explain what other abilities the
knack of dropping a bomb in a circle is father to
other than that of dispensing with as many
human lives as happen to be in the range of the
bomb and its screaming fragments.
As far ar is known United, TWA, and Ameri
can Airlines are not carrying bombs in their
transport planes, and the only extensive aerial
bombardments now in progress are in Spain
where this diversion is sport, but in deadly
earnest.
Bomb-dropping is no more an integral part
of aviation than torpedo-launching is a part of
seamanship. Bombs are instruments of death,
not agents of commerce.
When commercial aviation itself is in such a
frail position when air disasters daily prove that
man really does not know enough about either
his equipment or the all-important weather,
why must students play at games of war?
