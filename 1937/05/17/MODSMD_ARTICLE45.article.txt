# Six-Bits of Life

ll' you want to see Europe—really see Europe
the best way is by bicycle. Professor Hulme
will tell you that a gander at the towers of
Notre Dame in a party of tourists is nothing
compared to pedaling from one little town to
another, a bottle of Burgundy under each arm,
living with peasants on thick French soup and
thick French bread.

The international institution which makes
possible such a life is the Youth Hostel. Fitted
out with two-bit beds, a stove, and two friendly
houseparents, the hostels—7soo in all—offer
overnight facilities to traveling students every
15 or 20 miles along the picturesque roads of
England and the Continent.
Three years ago a young American couple
who had learned the joys of hostelling along
the Rhine, over the Alps, and down into the
rich grape country of Italy, brought the idea
to the United States.
Recruiting New England farmers and small
town philanthropists into their scheme, they
established a loop of hostels whose route
touched all the scenic and historic spots of New
England. Ten thousand youngsters last sum
mer saw this beautiful White Mountain country
from their bikes —enjoyed the woods, the sky,
the fresh air for less than 75 cents a day.
This summer the hostel idea jumps to the
Pacic Coast with a string being opened down
the Peninsula and into the Santa Cruz Mounr
tains and Big Basin regions. Northern California
youths will take to the "open road" on foot
or their bicycles—spend every night in a com
fortable, clean hostel with their fellow travelers.
But hosteling maybe wouldn't appeal to Stan
ford kids. They probably wouldn't get much
kick out of pounding back-roads all day and
hitting the hay (it would be literally that) before
nine o'clock at night. They wouldn't admit that
a few weeks on a bicycle is exactly what we
soft, neurotic pseudo-roughs really need.—D. B.
