HPWO examples of the lubbug biting off more than he
can chew have come to light, and, as might be ex
pected, the Betas are involved.
The house-warmers had a house meeting in which
everybody decided to have a dance. As soon as the
returns from the last precinct came rolling in, a lub
buggy brother rushed to the phone and got Roble on
the wire.
"I'm sorry," said the Robleite, "but I've already got
a date for your house dance."
"And with whom, may 1 ask?" the Beta may have
asked.
"Why, with that tall, dark, and curly Phi Delt—
Roble hashboy," she replied.
The Betas immediately called of! the dance.
r |' , HERE is a Kappa pledge in Roble who has achieved
a new innovation on the double-date principle. It
goes like this: another tennis player, though an Alpha
Delt to all intents and purposes, got a date with the
pledge who is an old friend of the family for the
Junior Lopears Prom.
Came Friday afternoon and the Alpha Delt went
over to Roble Holler and asked his date if she wanted
to go swimming on that Friday afternoon. She took
the matter under advisement, saying: "Yes, but how
about tonight?"
"Well, how about it?"
"I'm very sorry," she said, "but I've just had a
friend come up from Los Angeles, and I won't be able
to go."
That night she appeared at the prom with a Beta
soph, who may have just come from out of nowhere,
but not that part included in the city limits of Los
Angeles.
jyjEANWHILE, the Beta house still hand-stands, de
spite the fact that some friend of the Beta boys
hooked his car onto the front porch pillars, and yanked
them out. Three Betas are still living inside.
We shall now progress to the Sigma Nus. Our
Hasher received an unsigned card today saying: "The
Sigma Nu's did help turn the car over—they do not
come in packages." Bottled in bond, probably.
