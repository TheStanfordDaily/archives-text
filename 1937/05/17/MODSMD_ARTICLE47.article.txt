# BULL SESSION
## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
### 
a long time now Stanford bigwigs have been
wondering why they can't get money out of their
graduates. They say: "We gave you a swell education
in nice surroundings. We started you on the road to
bigger and better times. You love the old school, so
why don't you give us a iittle money.
The dramatics department wanted money for a
new theater. The only way they could get it was by
charging the students an extra dollar each quarter.
The medical school wants' money, yet a donation
that would have set them on their feet for a long time
was given to California instead. The law school would
like a new building.
There isn't a department at Stanford that couldn't
use money, and lots of it.

Maybe personal grievances arc th<j reason for lack
of funds and surplus of excuses, but I doubt it. Emo
tional grievances tend to die out and disappear with
the passing of years.
Instead of looking into the real cause of its troubles,
however, the university blames the loss of a donation
on some silly story the Daily printed, as if anyone who
had made a really large fortune and wanted to give it
away would be so small.
They never look around them. The answer to their
troubles is right in their own backyard.

STANFORD has the world's worst classrooms and the
k world's best athletic equipment.
That should mean something.
For a long time now Stanford has been basking in
the light cast by its stellar athletes. People through
out the world heard of Stanford, not because some
scientist, working in a dark little room, using only the
poorest sort of makeshift equipment, has made giant
strides in conquering syphilis, but rather because Ben
Eastman could run a 440 faster than anyone else in
the world, and Stanford rightly maintains an athletic
publicist.

But the academic University is afraid of publicity,
but only because they don't understand it. They never
meet the press half-way.
They give out practically nothing, yet there isn't a
paper in the country that wouldn't rather run a good
informative story about Stanford than a lot of gar
bage dished up by some rewrite man.
Yet just try and get a decent story out of a de
partment head sometime.
The press has eyes, but they can't always see very
well. It sup to Stanford to simply them with glasses.
Stanford wants money. They'd better let people
know why money should be given.
