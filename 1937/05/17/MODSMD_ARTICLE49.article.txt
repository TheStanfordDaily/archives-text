# Harvard Cops Use Tear Gas In Water-Fight
## 
### 
When one clubman runs through
a door in a Stanford water-fight, it's
screamed in headlines.
But. across the land at Harvard, a
water-fight means nothing unless it
ends with sirens, firemen's hoses,
and tear-gas bombs.
THROW EGGS
Like Encinamen, Harvard lads re
lax from academics with water
wrapped in waste-baskets. One
night last week motorists and pedes
trians passing Cambridge dormitories
wore doused from above a little
more intensely than usual. Stu
dents who lacked strategic positions
in upper story windows took up the
fight on the ground, bringing col
lege police to the scene.
Photo-finish bulbs and last
month's eggs began to pop. Aroused
students' imaginations did too. The
cry went up—"On to Radcliffe."
BESEIGE RADCLIFFE
Across the Charles River, fash
ionable Radcliffe daughters had just
retired—until sirens awakened them
t.n bonfires blazing in the quad
rangle. Powerful searchlights soon
were illuminating the girls in the
dormitory windows.
Firemen put out the fires while
police put out the playful Harvard
men with tear-gas bombs. The
"water-fight" was over.
CAMBRIDGE, 0.. May 16 (U.R).—
When a 14-inch snake crawled into
the Sarchet Run school, the teacher
and 24 pupils scrimbled to tops of
desks and chairs. One small boy, now
the school hero, dashed from the
room and returned with a mouse
trap. This he dangled from a piece
of string in front of the intruder.
When the snake struck, the trap
snapped neatly around its neck.
