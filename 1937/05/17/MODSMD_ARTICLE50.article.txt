"THE PRINCE AND THE PAU
PER," Warner Brothers' epic to
{ celebrate the English coronation, is
j meat and drink for all lovers of
l spectacle, cute children not of the
i Shirley Temple mold, and Errol
Flynn's typical heroisms.
Featured as the prince and the
pauper are the Mauch twins, two
very attractive lads about 12 years
of age, who prove the rule that chil
dren cannot act by being the excep
j tions. Both are very natural, with
[ an infectious, unaffected laugh that
| is a pleasure to hear after years of
' giggles and simpers.
Mark Twain's ever popular story
| of the prince and beggar boy who
| inadvertently change places lacks
I none of the original thrills and mo
i ments of suspense in this film ver
j sion, whose ending coronation scenes
I are exceptionally timely, and give to
| t hose Americans who missed the
sight, a pretty good idea of the
' pomp and ceremony that went on
! last week.
| Errol Flynn is his usual dashing
I self, as he goes around rescuing the
prince — (or was it the pauper —
j well, even their own mother gets
| them mixed up) from those evil
doers who seek the downfall of the
j house of Tudor. Photography in
many places is fine, and the inev
itable contrast between the filth and
I squalor of the poor section of Lon-
I don and the splendor and richness of
| the court is not over done.
You'll cheer the heroes and hiss
| the villains and will have a very
! good time throughout, ever keeping
j an eye on these Mauch boys, who
I will do fine things if more suitable
j stories can be found for them.
"Fair Warning." This one's about
j a murder in a mine, with Edward
• Bromberg as the kindly candy
j chewing deputy, who solves the
; mystery with the aid of a young
j brat and a good-looking hero. It
I was directed by Norman Foster,
[and we can't decide whether he
should stick to acting or directing
I —it's just that kind of indifference.
