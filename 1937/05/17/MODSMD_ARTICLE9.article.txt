# Guests Get Bird; Pickets Get Chicken
## Strikers Dine in Luxury, Served by Best Chefs, As Public Stays Home 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 16 (UP).
—The world's finest strike soup
kitchen served an enticing menu to
day to 2000 pickets in a 16-day-old
San Francisco hotel strike that has
tied up the city's 16 leading hostel
ries.
While wealthy visitors to the
Golden Gate metropolis seek food
and lodging at second-rate hotels,
the strikers are served twice daily
by the pride of Pacific Coast waiters
in a spacious dining room in Druids'
Hall.
CHEFS FAMOUS
Chefs known the world-over for
their practice of the art of food pre
paring superintend a modern kitch
en where choice meats, vegetables
and fruits are concocted to tempt the
palates of weary strike marchers.
A meal in the strike kitchen that
the city's elite usually pay $2.50 for
at the best hotels—and can't buy at
any price there now, includes: fresh
vegetable salad, sea bass American,
roast chicken, squash, new peas,
long branch potatoes, pie, cake or
ice cream, coffee, tea or milk.
TICKETS PASSED OUT
A striker serving in the picket line
is given a ticket for each brief shift
he stays on duty, pacing up and
down before the hotels with a
strike banner, or a brassard bearing
the legend of the American Federa
tion of Labor.
Then he goes to the lodge hall in
down-town San Francisco, not far
from the city's famed civic center
and a stone-throw from Market
Street. There is no long queue of
hungry-looking, tattered strikers in
front of the hall as is common in a
strike kitchen. It appears more like
a gathering for a Sunday lodge
meeting.
HOTEL STRIKE
SEEN IN L.A.
LOS ANGELES, May 16 (UP).—
Possibility of a general hotel strike
was conceded tonight as the two
main dining rooms of the fashionable
Beverly-Wilshire Hotel were closed
as a result of a walkout of musicians,
cooks and waiters.
Hotelmen and union leaders alike
admitted the possibility the strike
may spread to other hostelries in
Los Angeles and Hollywood, al
though no immediate walkout was
planned.
