# Spring Fete To Be Given By Mothers
## Pageant To Be Feature Of Festival Held Today At Historical Estate 
### 
Attempting a more elaborate pro
gram than ever before, the Stanford
Mothers' Club will present its annual
spring fete this afternoon on the his
toric Ogden Mills estate in Millbrae.
Thirty-five students, as well as club
members are scheduled to appear in
the pageant of early California, "It
Happened in the Seventies," to be
presented at 2:30 o'clock.
Receiving her guests for tea on
the lawn of the Mills house will be
Mrs. Alfred Hillback, the "hostess"
of the pageant. Among her visitors
who will step out of history for one
afternoon will be Lola Montez, the
famous actress, played by Mrs. Sam
uel Slater, ani Hall McAllister, San
Francisco attorney and social lion of
the 'seventies, played by Mr. H. L.
Van Winkle.
Costumes Authentic
The authentic antique costumes
and props which have been borrowed
for the occasion will lend much to
the professional appearance of the
pageant. Mrs. R. L. Wheeler, who is
in charge of costuming, went as far
south as the Pasadena Community
Playhouse for the habits to be worn
by the six women who will ride side
saddle. The Mills estate is particu
larly appropriate as a setting for the
pageant, since it is built in early
Californian style.
Proceeds from the festival will go
to the Mothers' Club fund, which
supports the Men's and Women's
Rest Homes as well as carrying on
Ihe club's scholarship and welfare
work.
