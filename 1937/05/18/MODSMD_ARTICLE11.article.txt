# Efficiency Makes Encina's Student Hash Squad Click
## Hashflash Saga Reveals Backstage Encina 
### RICHARD DUDMAN HARRY PRESS 
(Many letters have come to the
editor's desk since Bull Scssioncr
John Col>bs attacked Encina food.
Because Cobbs' version might
have been good gastronomy, but
poor reporting, the Daily sent
Harry Press and Dick Dudman to
find out the facts and present them
in a series of articles of which this
is the lirst.—The Editor.)

Where do they come from?
Who are they?
What organization lies behind that
slightly soup-stained corps of men
in-white which serves Encina its 18
meals a week?
There's no haphazardness in the
system that metes out these 50-odd
student-filled jobs each year. Head
ed by Mrs. H. L. Watson, a compli
cated and highly co-ordinated ma
chine moves into action a month be
fore school opens each fall, to make
it easier for half-a-hundred men to
attend Stanford, and to be sure that
the new frosh will get their first
meal as scheduled.
Many Applications Filed
Chosen from the incoming first
year men and from the previous
year's regular hashers, all appli
cants' names are included in a file
which is later segregated into two
groups: those who are entirely or
partly self-supporting, and those
who merely want to earn some
spending money. The former group
is given initial consideration for the
steady jobs, while the latter men are
placed on the substitute list.
In assigning jobs, there is no gen
eral preference given to athletes, but
six openings are filled by the 8.A.C.:
football, three; basketball, track, and
swimming, one each. In addition to
these, three jobs are held till the
'last minute for students who "just
come," with no money, no prospect
of earning any.
This fall, the number of applicants
for Encina hashing jobs dropped to
175 from a previous average of 300
each year.
590 in Ten Minutes
And the job of serving in 10
minutes 500 gluttonous frosh who
arc pregnant with the übiquitous
tradition that "Stanford men don't
wait for their food" also requires a
well-oiled mechanism.
Let's follow Joe Hashflash as he
serves lunch to his two tables of
eight men each.
After eating his meal in the hash
ers' dining hall, Hashflash uniforms,
tables bread, butter, jam, mayon
naise, and the rest of his "set-ups,"
then waits until 12:05, when he
brings in the water. Then Joe lines
up with the other hashboys in front
of the ice box, until the 12:08 gong
signals him to take in salads, which
necessitates two trips, as there are
only 11 salads on a tray.
Gets the Gong
Next our little buckaroo dashes to
the range, where the second gong,
at 12:12, cues him to carry in his
entrees, two trips, eight on a tray.
A third trip brings in the vegetables
and gravy, after which Hashflash re
laxes a moment till the dining hall
doors are opened and the stampede
booms in, finds its collective seat
which was assigned at the beginning
of the quarter.
Drink orders (milk, coffee, tea,
chocolate milk, buttermilk: choose
one) are taken, and Hashflash dash
es cut for the aforementioned lubri
cants so that he can be back by the
time his patrons ax - e x-eady for "sec
onds."
Home Stretch
Then come desserts, and Joe can
row begin cleaning off his tables.
Carrying out his scrapings and
empty milk bottles, he leaves to a
squad of busboys the work of carry
ing out scraped plates, silverware,
and glasses.
Waiters-on-table and busboys are
not the only students employed at
Encina. Also in the hierarchy are
dining room sponsors, head hash
ers, food checkers, glass wipers, dish
stackers, bake shop helpers, and a
truck driver.
