# Efficiency Makes Encina's Student Hash Squad Click
## Hashflash Saga Reveals Backstage Encina 
### RICHARD DUDMAN HARRY PRESS 
(Many letters have come to the
editor's desk since Bull Scssioncr
John Col>bs attacked Encina food.
Because Cobbs' version might
have been good gastronomy, but
poor reporting, the Daily sent
Harry Press and Dick Dudman to
find out the facts and present them
in a series of articles of which this
is the lirst.—The Editor.)

Where do they come from?
Who are they?
What organization lies behind that
slightly soup-stained corps of men
in-white which serves Encina its 18
meals a week?
There's no haphazardness in the
system that metes out these 50-odd
student-filled jobs each year. Head

it easier for half-a-hundred men to

Many Applications Filed
Chosen from the incoming first
year men and from the previous
year's regular hashers, all appli
cants' names are included in a file
which is later segregated into two
groups: those who are entirely or
partly self-supporting, and those
who merely want to earn some
spending money. The former group
is given initial consideration for the
steady jobs, while the latter men are
placed on the substitute list.
In assigning jobs, there is no gen
eral preference given to athletes, but
six openings are filled by the 8.A.C.:
football, three; basketball, track, and
swimming, one each. In addition to
these, three jobs are held till the
'last minute for students who "just
come," with no money, no prospect
of earning any.
This fall, the number of applicants
for Encina hashing jobs dropped to
175 from a previous average of 300
each year.
