### 
HOLLWOOD, May 17 (P). â€”The
| Screen Actors' Guild went to work
i today under a contract forbidding
j strikes for 10 years. Coincidentally
! it sharply washed its hands of the
j strike of 6000 film craftsmen.
I At a mass meeting of 2000 mem
i hers ranging from high-salaried
I stars to $5-a-day extras, the guild
j executive board announced it rati
i fied a contract which exaoted nearly
! 30 concessions from the studios in
return for the promise not to strike.
The board, including such stars as
Joan Crawford, Franchot Tone,
Frederic March, James Cagney, Rob
j ert Montgomery and Jean Muir, is
l sued a statement in defense of ac
| cusations of craft strike leaders that
j the actors "let us down" by not
! walking out in sympathy.
Making Charles Lessing, strike
| leader, the target of their charges,
j the stars claimed he called the strike,
j supposedly in the name of the Fed
erated Motion Picture Crafts, two
days before the federation actually
i was formed on May 2.
