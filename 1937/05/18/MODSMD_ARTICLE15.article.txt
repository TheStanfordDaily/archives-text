i Mrs. Wilbur.
C'liapel Magnificent
"The chapel is .magnificent!" he
I exclaimed. His perfect English
would have charmed the stormiest
international conference.
After luncheon at the Wilbur
home, Professor and Mrs. Eliot D.
Mears escorted Their Excellencies
and the Torchianas around the cam
pus. Lagunita Court, the New The

trip from Havana through the Pana
ma Canal, arrived in San Francisco
last week after two days at U.S.C. as
; guest of Dr. Rufus B. von KleinSmid,

its president.
"Stanford is well known in Hol
land," he said. "We think of it along
with Harvard and Yale."
Dutch students, the Minister ex
plained. do not have Stanford's hous
ing advantages. "In the Nether
lands students live in boarding
houses or inns and go to the univer

are small compared to American
schools, de With is proud of their
standing and age. "Several were
founded as early as the sixteenth
