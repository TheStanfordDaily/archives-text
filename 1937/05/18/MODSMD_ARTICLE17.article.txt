Due to Ihe big demand for tickets
for Barnstormers' spring show,
"Down the Hatch", to be presented
Friday and Saturday nights, all re
served tickets not paid for by 3
o'clock tomorrow afternoon will be
put on public sale, announced Dra
matic Manager Dick Daugherty yes
terday.
Most of the tunes for "Down the
Hatch" were not composed on the
piano according to Frank O'Neill,
author. Mac Gordon wrote "Nice
Night for It, Isn't It?"; "You Con
quered My Heart"; "I Gotta Take
Steps"; "Your Eyfes Have It"; and
"Down the Hatch" in the wilds of
Nevada, jotting notes and chords on
music paper, creating the tunes en
tirely out of his head.
"All arrangements have been es
pecially made to fit the numerous
situations, as well as being stylized
to fit the personalities of singers
Shirley Jones, Owen Clarke, Jerry
Reed, and Larry Randall," announc
ehs Chuck Ransom, musical director
of the show.
Gordon and O'Neill's new musi
comedy also features Jerry Reed in
a tap dancing number besides the
several singing numbers in which
she appeal's with Owen Clarke.
Bud Cady and Jack Ward, playing
the roles of crooks posing as big cat
hunters, will supply the gags and
wit.
