## Democrats Opposing Plan Make Pact to Veto Any Substitute for Bill 
### 
' Despite statements by President
! Roosevelt and Postmaster General
James A. Farley that there will be
I no compromise in the Supreme Court
j reorganization fight, administration
| strategists worked actively tonight
I to find a suitable substitute for the
| President's bill.
j The action seemed to be too late.
! Democratic senators opposed to add
j ing up to six new justices to the
! high tribunal met secretly in the of
| fices of Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
D., Mont., late in the day and voted
i to stand solid against compromise.
Proposal Withdrawn
Senator Pat McCarran, D., Nev.,
most active compromise advocatc,
I said after the meeting that he would
| withdraw his proposed amendment
J for a court of 11 members.
The Senate judiciary committee is
I scheduled to start voting tomorrow
!on the President's bill and all
! amendments.
Senators attending the opposition
meeting included several not yet
J publicly committed on the Presi
| dent's bill. Among them were Fran-
I -is T. Maloney, D., Conn.. William J.
i Bulow, D., S.D., and A. Harry
Moore, D., N.J.
Wheeler announced after the
' meeting:
"All were agreed to vote against
j all amendments and against the bill.
I The President says no compromise.
| Mr. Farley says no compromise. We
: say no compromise too. We've got
j at least 10 of 18 votes in the Senate
j judiciary committee against the bill
j and we've got at least 50 votes in the
! Senate to beat it."
Compromise Appears
The compromise efforts appeared
: when Senator M. M. Logan, D., Ky.,
! an administration supporter, inform
j ed the committee that he would offer
j three modifications to the President's
i bili.
{ From a high administration ofli
i cial the United Press learned that
I Logan's proposals were part of an
I eleventh-hour sounding of compro
| mise sentiment. This official said the
j committee's action tomorrow may
occasion "some surprise."
If the committee votes directly on
the President's bill as it now stands,
tne attitude of members promises an
unlavorable vote of 10 to 8.
Meanwhile the Supreme Court,
| meeting to render decisions, set
j June 1 for its summer adjournment,
j It failed to act on pending appeals
j involving unemployment insurance
j laws and federal old age pensions,
