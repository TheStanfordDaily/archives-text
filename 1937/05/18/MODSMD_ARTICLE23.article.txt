# Toyon Chosen As Scene Of Senior Ball
## Bids Limited To Senior Classmen; Phil Harris Contract Guaranteed 
### 
Decision to change the locale of
the annual Senior Ball on June 11
from the Women's Gym to the lobby
of Toyon Hall was announced last
night by Chairman Ralph Huntsber
ger.
The action was taken after a num
ber of seniors complained that the
cold of the gym patio would render
summer formal wear impractical,
Huntsberger said. Original plans
provided for dancing in the studio
and open court of the gym.
Contrary to previous announce
ments, the Senior Ball will be open
only to members of the graduating
class, the chairman declared. Bids,
priced at $8.50 per copy, will go on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office Thursday
or Friday. The sale will be limited
to approximately 325 couples; Hunts
berger therefore urged that seniors
obtain their bids early.
Meanwhile, class officials received
confirmation of a contract from Mu
sic Corporation of America, guaran
teeing the appearance of Phil Harris
and his band at the ball from 10 to 4
o'clock. The 17-piece orchestra will
complete an engagement at the Co
coanut Grove in Los Angeles just
before its arrival at Stanford.
A squab breakfast will be included
in the price of the bids, dancers being
nerved in the specially decorated
Branner dining hall from 12 to 3
o'clock. Programs will be in the
form of picture frames. Photogra
phers will take pictures of the dance,
print them by the next day, and
give them to the seniors present to
fit in the frames.
