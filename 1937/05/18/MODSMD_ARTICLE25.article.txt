# Student Authors Successful Sell Stories to Magazines
## 
### RITA SZEKERES 
Stanford students are becoming
magazine writers in Professor Ber
ton J. Ballard's Class in Forms of
Journalistic Writing, where more
than 50 orders for stories have been
reecived from magazines this quar
ter.
The course is a continuation of one
given last fall, in which the students
sold 32 articles and feature stories
on subjects on and off the campus.
The process followed is to send
queries to various magazines at the
beginning of the quarter, and then
gather the data. Sometimes an edi
tor will specify in his order exactly
what he wants, thereby simplifying
the writing.

This free lancing, according to Mr.
Ballard, makes the magazine edi
tors final judges of the students' ar
ticles, and thus the instructor is
comparable to a football coach work
ing together with his team with the

public as final critics. "Anything
required is approved of," he said,
"in view of the object in mind."
j Some of the successful students of
j the autumn quarter class are Charles
j Voigt, whose article on aviation was
i published in Aviation Magazine;
; Margaret Loud, with "The Life of
i the Stanford Coed" in the Illus
: trated Review; and Dave Botsford,
j with his article on Dr. Hulme in the
| same magazine.
Orders for Stories
Barbara Sweet had feature ar-
I tides printed in several newspapers,
I one on Dr. Cubberley in the New
j York Times, and a similar story in
| the Literary Digest. Millard
| Browne, also writing on Dr. Cubber
! ley, had his article published in the
\ American Magazine.
Gordy Frost's article on Stanford
j Yachtsmen appeared in The Pacific
j Skipper, J. Roy Peterson's "Bad
| lands of Wyoming" in Travel Maga
j zine, and Hilmer Lodge's two articles
! on track in Sporteye and the Illus
j trated Review.
| This quarter, orders have been re
ceived from such magazines as
Harper's Bazaar, McCall's, and sev
j eral trade journals, including nine
orders for one article from the en
j gineering laboratories at Stanford.
The subjects ordered included stu
dent activities, features on build
ings and grounds around the cam
pus, and sorority and fraternity re
| modelings. Tro Harper has already
j sold a number of pictures to maga-
I zines.

Orders for Stories
Barbara Sweet had feature ar-
I tides printed in several newspapers,
I one on Dr. Cubberley in the New
j York Times, and a similar story in

\ American Magazine.
Gordy Frost's article on Stanford
j Yachtsmen appeared in The Pacific
j Skipper, J. Roy Peterson's "Bad
| lands of Wyoming" in Travel Maga
j zine, and Hilmer Lodge's two articles
! on track in Sporteye and the Illus
j trated Review.
| This quarter, orders have been re
ceived from such magazines as
Harper's Bazaar, McCall's, and sev
j eral trade journals, including nine
orders for one article from the en
j gineering laboratories at Stanford.
The subjects ordered included stu
dent activities, features on build
ings and grounds around the cam
pus, and sorority and fraternity re
| modelings. Tro Harper has already
j sold a number of pictures to maga-
I zines.
Stanford students are becoming
magazine writers in Professor Ber
ton J. Ballard's Class in Forms of
Journalistic Writing, where more
than 50 orders for stories have been
reecived from magazines this quar
ter.
The course is a continuation of one
given last fall, in which the students
sold 32 articles and feature stories
on subjects on and off the campus.
The process followed is to send
queries to various magazines at the
beginning of the quarter, and then
gather the data. Sometimes an edi
tor will specify in his order exactly
what he wants, thereby simplifying
the writing.
Successful Students
This free lancing, according to Mr.
Ballard, makes the magazine edi
tors final judges of the students' ar
ticles, and thus the instructor is
comparable to a football coach work
ing together with his team with the

public as final critics. "Anything
required is approved of," he said,
"in view of the object in mind."
