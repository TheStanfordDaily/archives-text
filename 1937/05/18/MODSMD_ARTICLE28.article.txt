# U.A.W. Charges Ford Violation Of Labor Act
## Labor Chieftains Accuse Auto Manufacturer Of Anti – Union Agitation 
### 
DETROIT, May 17 (U.R).—United
Automobile Workers officials ex
plored the possibility tonight of fil
ing charges against Henry Ford for
allegedly violating the Wagner Labor
Relations Act by distributing anti
union literature to his men.
Homer Martin, president of the
union, called in his ace organizers
directing an intensive membership
drive in the great Ford plant at River
Rouge after all employees of the
company had been given small cards
on which were printed a list of
""Fordisms."
The "Fordisms" were brief ex
cerpts from the elderly manufac
turer's public statements in opposi
tion to labor unions.
Printed on white cards, they were
attached to employees' time cards
when the men signed out. Harry
Bennett, chief of the Ford service
department, said they had been dis
tributed to all of the company's
140,000 workers in all sections of the
country.
"Figure it out for yourself," a
"Fordism" urged. "If you go into a
union they have got you—but what
have you got?"
"We have always made a better
bargain for our men than an out
sider could," another read. "We have
never had to bargain against our
men and we don't expect to begin
now."
Martin believed Ford's action came
within the Wagner Act's provision
prohibiting "overt" acts on the part
of employers in attempts to prevent
workers from joining labor organi
zations.
