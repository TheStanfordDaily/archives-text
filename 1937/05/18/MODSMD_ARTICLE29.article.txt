# Maloney Trains Youths In Weekly Gym Classes
## 
### MATTHEW VAN WINKLE 
A common sight to behold out on
the frosh field or in the swimming
j pool on a Saturday morning during
| spring quarter is Harry Maloney's
I class of youngsters.
| Starting his pet hobby in 1916, the
| minor sports director has built up
a total of about 400 athletes who have
j been prominent in various varsity
j sports. Not only have the alumni of
this class been prominent in athletics,
| but almost all of them have since
been successful in nearly every walk
; of life.
Activities in which the members of
the class indulge are such favorite
sports as soccer, touch football, base
ball, basketball, track and field, and
J swimming.
To winners of the various events,
i prizes are given, the cost of which is
covered by small fees paid by the
| youngsters at the beginning of the
term. At the end of the season, a
j gold medal is presented to the most
| outstanding boy of the group, the
| award being given on a basis of
I leadership, scholastic standing, ath
j letic ability, and character.
Full Day's Work
j At the beginning of each session
j of the class, the boys go through some
light physical exercises designed to
! correct their postures and give them
' a sense of balance. After this is fin
-1 ished, the young ones play at their
I various field sports, after which they
j go to the swimming pool for class
instruction. Here, those who cannot
j swim very well or cannot swim at
all are given special attention by
some of the instructors. Diving is
given individual attention and faults
! are corrected.
When the class was started in 1916,
30 boys were enrolled; this year
there are 137, Maloney's work has
been going on each spring quarter
with the exception of the time during
the war when he was at the front,
and last year when he was on leave
| of absence.

The instructors in the class all re
ceive a certain amount for their time j
and services with the exception of J
Maloney who .says, "These Saturday ;
classes come after a week of hard J
work for the University, and are a j
sort of rest for me. I'm dealing with
future athletes, and love my work. - ' j
All but four of this year's class are |
sons of Stanford alumni or faculty ]
members; the other four come from |
San Jo.se. Among the sons of promi- i
nent faculty members and alumni
are the two boys of former President j
of the United States Herbert Hoo
ver; the three sons of Ray Lyman j
Wilbur; Dr. Branner's boy; and the
son of David Stair Jordan.
"I have been accused by many of |
proselyting for Stanford," says Ma
loney, "and if it is so, one can sec
that I certainly believe in getting j
them young. I go after them when
they are eight years old!"
