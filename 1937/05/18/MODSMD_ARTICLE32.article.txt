—TO SPEAK OF
OTHER THINGS
The smoke has pretty well clear- j
ed away now from the Fresno af- |
fair, and that gives a chance to j
bring out some of the little things j
that weren't considered in the midst j
( f the records and such that got all j
the comment at first.
One mark that v/as almost abso- |
lately passed over by virtually every i
paper you could find, including the |
Daily, was that turned in by the j
Stanford mile relay team of Kneu
buhl. Malott, McCurdy, and Weier
shauser, <»! 3:12.8. Phil Klauber
dished out Slants yesterday, and he
had something to say about it, but
lie didn't give it the build-up it
should have had.
Just think—Maynor Shove, Ike
Hables, Lcs Hables, and Ben East
man ran 3:12.6 just a few years ago
to set a new world's record, and
that was considered quite a mark
wh< n they set it. Even though a
U.S.C. team knocked a full second off
it last year, here is a Stanford team
; '<ain running dangerously close to
record time. Sure, the boys were 1.2
seconds away from the record set by
U.S.C., but they still ran far and
away the fastest relay in the coun
iry this year, and if they have an
other chance they might clip oil
enough time to break even the Tro
jan record.
Jimmy Kneubuhl has run very
fi'W quarters this j ear—he's a sprint
er by trade—and still he opened that
relay with a lap that cracked 50 fiat.
Maybe if he had concentrated on
running a 440 instead of 100 and 220 j
j ;;rds all season, he would have been
much lower in time by now for a
relay lap.
Yes, ye-;, here we have the fine.si
relay team in the country, and it
deserves a good build-up. It prob
ably won't have another chance to
perform this season, under favor- j
able conditions at least, which is un- j
fortunate. Neither the conference
nor the N.C.A.A. schedules mile re
lays, while such a race against the
Big Ten All-Stars would be run by
a motley crew from several schools.
There is still a chance that the
Pacific Association meet set for I
here this Saturday will be held on
Angell Field, instead of the Stadium,
and if it is the team will have a fine
chance to set a new record. How
ever. if the meet is held in the Sta
dium there won't be much fear of
that.
THEY'RE FOUR
WORLD RECORD HOLDERS
Speaking of relays, that 880 team
should get some more credit, too. In
that one Kneubuhl surprised a lot
f people by beating both Bob Frick
of California and George Boone of
S C. in the first lap, when Boone was
definitely supposed to be ahead.
Dink Templeton ran Malott in the
second lap for the express purpose
ol building up a lead, and that he
did, like nobody's business, by run
ning the legs off LaFond of U.S.C.
Hiserman had about a four-yard
lead over Vickery of the Trojans
when he started, but the red-headed
one caught him a little over half
way out. Just as Vickery was set to
go past him, though, Stan started
roaring and he finished the lap just
as far ahead as when he started. It
was an ideal move, catching Vickery
when he didn't have muoh left and
then drawing out everything he did
have.
Weiershauser, of course, only
lengthened the gap between him and
Clark Crane to finish five or six
yards ahead, which must have been
; wfully embarrassing to Dean

Cromwell, Troy coach. Weiershau
ser is one kid who deserves a lot of
glory if anyone ever did—here he is
in his last year, and just running
his head off. His work in the low
hurdles this year has brought him
from a good quarter-miler to na
tional recognition as a trackman,
and the efforts he has put forth in
the sprints in his last three meets
has also been something to smile
about.
Let's hope he'll have enough time
when he leaves school to keep prac
ticing, particularly in the lows, so
that he can earn himself a berth on
the American Olympic team in
Tokyo, 1940.
