# Water Polo Squad Starts Matches
## 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton's waterpolo
squad, the largest ever to turn out
for spring practice, will climax this
quarter's sessions in a series of regu
lation contests almost daily from May
19 to 28 in the Encina Pools.
Outstanding game of the series will
be played tomorrow afternoon, when
a crack team of seniors and alumni
will return to take on the varsity.
The "has-beens," nearly all of
whom have won all-Coast honors, are
favored over their more inexperi
enced successors.

The largest single order for truck
exports since the World War was
one for 130 trucks ordered by Irania.
