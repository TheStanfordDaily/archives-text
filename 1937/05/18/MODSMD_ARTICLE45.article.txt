# Long Shot — Bull's Eye
## 
### 
WHEN Junior President Tom Killefer asked
for Ray Noble's band, his class had just
$600 on deposit and wanted to take a $1200 risk.
It was a long shot.
If things hadn't worked out, the A.S.S.U.
would have been out about $600 and next year's
seniors would have been saddled with an em
barrassing debt.
Disaster seemed inevitable. Yet the Junior
Prom, with Lopez instead of Noble, chalked up
a record campus dance profit—s297.44. There
were 490 people who paid $1715 to hear the
most expensive band in Stanford's history.
These are the facts that should open many
campus eyes to the big-band situation, not only
those of student legislators, but administrative
authorities.
To student financiers it indicates that those
who have $2.50 to spend for a dance will spend
$3.50. Actually, attendance was heavier for
Lopez at the higher price than for Jimmy Dor
sey a few weeks before at a dollar less.
Though it's only fair to remember that city
hotels were not competing because of the strike,
yet $3.50 is a steep grade. And in spite of it,
Lopez and the juniors gunned over in high.
To Stanford's administrators, there is some
thing more significant in the record. The night
that big-name bands visit the campus, the stu
dents with money to spend—the ones who con
stitute the "Bayshore Menace"—stay at Stan
ford.
They have their fun here, perhaps not as their
fathers did in the early days, but still here.
The only fly in the ointment is the abnormally
high tariffs, undemocratic because they discrim
inate on economic grounds.
Yet the possibility presents itself that some
day there will be enough interest in campus
dances to assure the attendance of 2000 instead
of 500, with prices correspondingly low.
The way to achieve that end may be the
maintenance of the present toierant policy
toward big name bands, rather than their exclu
sion from the campus, so that the interest requi
site to such attendance at campus good times
can be awakened and sustained.
