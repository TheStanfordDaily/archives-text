# "Mothers' Day"
## 
### 
AT least $1000 — that's the goal Stanford's
mothers have set for themselves in today's
Spring Festival. The money isn't for an off
campus charity, nor is it to swell the moneybags
of just another organization. It's for the Mothers'
Club treasury. Which should be reason enough
for your patronage.
If it isn't, consider the fact that Mothers' Club
annually spends $7000 for Stanford students,
maintaining both the Men's and Women's Rest
Homes and financing welfare work and schol
arships.
The festival will be at the Ogden Mills es
tate at Millbrae at 2:30. Your obligation to sup
port the organization that helps support the or
ganization that helps support you can be con
sidered or not, as you please.
But need we add, your help is welcome.
