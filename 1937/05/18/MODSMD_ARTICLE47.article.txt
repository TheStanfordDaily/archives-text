{From the Minnesota Daily)
IF you count 13 pockets to a man's suit, a man
could go to a newsstand today and stuff three
or more digest magazines into each pocket, and
still not have room for one of the little maga
zines of pocket size—all because, as the maga
zine Tide has remarked, publishers think people
want magazines to put in their pockets. There
are, according to Tide, at least 40 digests cur
rently upon the market, including the Digest
Year Book, which strikes a new angle in com
piling the year's best selections from the world's
digest magazines. All are patterned after Read
er's Digest — whose phenomenal success is
measured in a near 2,000,000 circulation today—
and none shows signs of repeating its success.
There is Women's Digest, Facts of Life, and Con
sumer's Digest, and at the other end of the
scale, Pocket Western, Pocket Detective, and
even Pocket Love —which is something to think
about.
The new little magazines, if not so widely cir
culated, have been more rewarding. Coronet,
fathered by Esquire, magazine for he-men, pre
sents an interesting but scattered editorial con
tent, and marvels of photographic reproduction
ior 35 cents.

What will the future historian say of an age
that asks for its knowledge in pocket size and
yet stops to read such bulky encyclopedic ro
mances as "Anthony Adverse" and "Gone with
the Wind"? Certainly those who bought over
a million copies of each are also buying and
reading the new magazines. It is indeed diffi
cult to understand why the late 1930's should
see a magazine renaissance. Superficially at
least it means that things are getting better, that
the slump is being left further behind. Without
a doubt it means, too, that the depression years
have left their mark, made us more conscious
of the world we live in. The midget magazines
promise to make the contemporary world be
come more alive, and the better among them,
at least, are giving us our information more
attractively and intelligently.
