# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
ON EVERY Sunday afternoon the smokehouse lad
dies take out their pretty red fire wagons and
play I'un-sheep-run with Chief Dugan. The chief hops
in his sunburn speedster and goes out and hollers
"wolf" at the most remote fire boxes, just to see if the
boys still remember their old flames.
When the alarm comes in, the laddies hop in their
squirt machines, and go trailing out, with the chemical
truck, the pumper, and the hook and ladder pounding
along in sequence, with three or four cars of Daily pho
tographers burning along behind.
If they ever find the alarm box, they next have to
smoke out the chief, who is usually hiding behind a
tree. Since there is no fire, the laddies then spend then
surplus energies in putting out the chief.
However, if the boys can't find the fire box, they
just stop their trucks in the middle of the street and
spend their time laughing at The Daily photographers,
who get sucked in every time.
This, of course, is all in the interest of efficiency,
just in case there ever is a fire on the campus that
isn't in the grass skirting the halls, though The Daily
has held several editions late in the hopes that the
fire house would bum down some time while the boys
were out diggin for Dugan.
A LL this practice, of course, nerves the boys for the
big ordeals of actual fire fighting. One such ordeal
occurred recently, when the call came in that a car
was on fire on foothill bullyvard.
"What truck should I take," asked Hook, visiting
fireman at the Chi O hashery.
"Take the Ford," said Tiger-man Herb, who pours
water at all Deegee conflagrations.
"Maybe I ought to take the Seagrave," said Hook.
"No, take the Ford," screamed the tiger-man.
So Hook took the Ford truck out to quench the car
with the hot bolts.
Which is perfectly all right, except that the Ford
is the hook and ladder truck.
My mail just keeps pouring in. The latest two mis
sives have come in from some Hatch-man with suicidal
Down the Our Hatcher tendencies. The man quite
coyly reveals such great cosmic truths as the fact
that there are S.A.E.'s in the cast, and that the director
is in love with one of the cast members and that the
director is going to surprise the audience with his mov
ing pictures in a "clever way," and that the director
has arranged for his "old friends" to drop in "from
Broadway."
Well, I won't reveal the director's secrets, but I've
got a quiet little secret of my own: I have strong
reasons for suspicioning the anonymous, deep, dark,
secretive missive was written by the hand of the di
rector himself.
