# Barn Dance Waits Strike Settlement
## 
### 
If the hotel strike is settled by
May 21, the Convalescent Home
benefit barn dance will be held as
scheduled on that date, acording to
the committee in charge.
The dance is being arranged by
the San Francisco Auxiliary of the
Home, and was originally planned for
two weeks ago at the Palace Hotel,
but was postponed because of the
strike. Although the May 21 date
conflicts with the first night of the
Barnstormers' production, "Down
the Hatch," the committee does not
plan to make another postponement
unless the strike makes-it necessary.
The dance, they explained, draws its
crowd from the entire bay area, not
from Stanford alone.
