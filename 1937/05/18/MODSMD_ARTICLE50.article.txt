SATAN'S CHILDREN
'T'HE administration complains that the frosh are
rowdy, barbarous, and murderous. It points with
agony to the Encina breakage bill, and to the water
bag cloudbursts that make bathing suits formal Encina
attire.
Determined not to spare the rod and let the children
spoil the furniture, it deals out chain gang hours at
the Rest Home, putting no strain on the quality of
mercy.
Administration and faculty forget the elementary
principle of Sociology: that the individual's actions
are largely determined by his environment. Encina is a
battered hulk, bearing unlimited testimony to the devil
ment of yesteryear. About it hangs the tradition that
college men should raise more and better hell than
the devil himself.
* * * *
Moreover, there is no one to show the frosh the
way, the truth, and the light. Raised on the rah-rah,
magazine-college tradition, the freshmen find nothing
to contradict the idea that a University course is four
years of uproar. Sponsors are saddled with the task of
acting as policemen. They do not advise their charges.
They coerce them. And there is nothing quite so
withering to sympathy and brotherliness as the threat
of wood sawing at the rest home.
* * * *
r pHE freshmen will do what they think they ought
to do. Most of them come to college feeling honor
bound to make as much trouble as possible. Lurid tales
of old grads, and magazine stories have painted uni
versities as institutions dedicated to riot and revolu
tion. As long as the frosh think this they will do their
best, to contribute to the world's confusion. If the ad
ministration wants them to behave like good little
boys, it must convince them that they have the wrong
impression.
There will be a surplus of weeping and wailing and
teeth gnashing, as long as we persist in stabling the
entire freshman class in one barn, unguided, unadvised.
Pre-reg programs and orientation lectures cannot be
expected to overcome the mob instinct for trouble that
automatically springs up when an entire class just out
of high school is forced to live under one roof.
♦ * * *
The freshmen need more contacts with upper class
men. They need examples, not weed-hoeing at the
rest home. The obvious solution is to scatter the fresh
man living groups, and increase the number of spon
sors.
Foi* as long as the first-year men are forced to live
in Encina, they will make Stanford fret and fume.
And no amount of hard labor at the rest home will
change them.
