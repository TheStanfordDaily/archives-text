# CAMPUS OPINION
## BOMB ON BOMBING 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily Trojan has voiced an
opinion on bomb-dropping as an
event in intercollegiate airmeets. It
is difficult not to explode, not to
shout back an answer. Rather, we
feel that the correction of such a
delusion must be approached quiet
ly, with the delicacy il takes to re
move a cataract from the eyes of
truth and vision.
The Stanford -US C. Airmeet of
May 8 included two events: spot
landings (condoned) and bomb
chopping (condemned). In bomb
dropping, the }.iiot attains an alti
tude of 500 feel, flies over a circle
on the ground, and drops his "mis
siles of death"—two one-half-pound
paper bags, contabi'ng a mixture of
sand and fcour. Upon hitting, the
"screaming fragments" of these
bomb.s fly a good two or three feet,
div-pcndir.g, p'.vhaps, with a bit of
grass or weed in the vicinity.
Measures Skill
Now. quite p.ioifically, we contend
to be those "conversant with the
ways of aviation" who can explain
bomb-dropping as other than the
father of a war-time game of death.
When rifle teams shoot at paper tar
gets, do we say that it is a get-your
man practice? When spoilsmen hit
clay pigeons, are we anticipating
their marksmanship for the inevi
table next war?
Might we say that the gentle art
of dropping paper-bag bombs is in
the same category? The object of
bomb-dropping is to develop and
measure the pilot's accuracy and
judgment of distance in flying over
a certain designated position. Now,
you will obviously agree that it is
impractical to dangle anything, such
as. a long tape measure, from the
plane to the ground to calculate this.
Therefore, something is dropped. We
call it a bomb—it might be an old
shoe or a tennis ball.
Air Meet Practice
Why should this be an integral
part of aviation? We need only citc
one reason: the dropping of food,
supplies, and medicine in inacces
sible, stricken areas. Really, the
most naive cannot deny that this
service has in the past saved lives,
and undoubtedly will in the future.
And now, friends, we understand
that we are not to play this little
p,ame when commercial aviation's
air disasters prove "that man really
does not know enough about either
his equipment or the all-important
weather." We are, in the first place,
considering an air-meet, a contest,
and not every-day flying. There are
no pilots who do not concern them
selves with meteorology; but at an
airmeet, should the contestants sit
down and figure out that the weath
er in New York will be bad next
Friday, or good in tropical Los An
geles to the middle of December?
We hope that in this mild explana
tion, we have brought the sought
for enlightenment to our friends,
and that we have made, in defense,
a slight contribution to aviation.

siles of death"—two one-half-pound
paper bags, contabi'ng a mixture of
sand and fcour. Upon hitting, the
"screaming fragments" of these
bomb.s fly a good two or three feet,
div-pcndir.g, p'.vhaps, with a bit of
grass or weed in the vicinity.
Measures Skill
Now. quite p.ioifically, we contend
to be those "conversant with the
ways of aviation" who can explain
bomb-dropping as other than the
father of a war-time game of death.
When rifle teams shoot at paper tar
gets, do we say that it is a get-your
man practice? When spoilsmen hit
clay pigeons, are we anticipating
their marksmanship for the inevi
table next war?
Might we say that the gentle art
of dropping paper-bag bombs is in
the same category? The object of
bomb-dropping is to develop and
measure the pilot's accuracy and
judgment of distance in flying over
a certain designated position. Now,
you will obviously agree that it is
impractical to dangle anything, such
as. a long tape measure, from the
plane to the ground to calculate this.
Therefore, something is dropped. We
call it a bomb—it might be an old
shoe or a tennis ball.
Air Meet Practice
Why should this be an integral
part of aviation? We need only citc
one reason: the dropping of food,
supplies, and medicine in inacces
sible, stricken areas. Really, the
most naive cannot deny that this
service has in the past saved lives,
and undoubtedly will in the future.
And now, friends, we understand
that we are not to play this little
p,ame when commercial aviation's
air disasters prove "that man really
does not know enough about either
his equipment or the all-important
weather." We are, in the first place,
considering an air-meet, a contest,
and not every-day flying. There are
no pilots who do not concern them
selves with meteorology; but at an
airmeet, should the contestants sit
down and figure out that the weath
er in New York will be bad next
Friday, or good in tropical Los An
geles to the middle of December?
We hope that in this mild explana
tion, we have brought the sought
for enlightenment to our friends,
and that we have made, in defense,
a slight contribution to aviation.

The Editor, Sir:
The Daily Trojan has voiced an
opinion on bomb-dropping as an
event in intercollegiate airmeets. It
is difficult not to explode, not to
shout back an answer. Rather, we
feel that the correction of such a
delusion must be approached quiet
ly, with the delicacy il takes to re
move a cataract from the eyes of
truth and vision.
The Stanford -US C. Airmeet of
May 8 included two events: spot
landings (condoned) and bomb
chopping (condemned). In bomb
dropping, the }.iiot attains an alti
tude of 500 feel, flies over a circle
on the ground, and drops his "mis
siles of death"—two one-half-pound
paper bags, contabi'ng a mixture of
sand and fcour. Upon hitting, the
"screaming fragments" of these
bomb.s fly a good two or three feet,
