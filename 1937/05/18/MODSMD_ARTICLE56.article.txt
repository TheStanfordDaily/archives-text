# Exchange Student Plan Considered
## 
### 
Tentative plans for a system of
exchange students with three Central
American universities, those of Mex
ico, Salvador, and Guatemala, will
be submitted to Interfraternity
Council, according to Tom Killefcr,
next year's student body president.
Aid from the University in the
form of exchange scholarships is im
possible, Killefer said, because uni
versity costs here are approximately
four times as large as those in the
other universities. Therefore, it will
be suggested to fraternities that they
make arrangements similar to that
now maintained by the Phi Delts,
who annually exchange one of their
members with a German student
from Heidelberg, paying the visitor's
tuition.
If the fraternities are willing to
work under this arrangement, the
plan will go into eifect next year.
Final decision will be reached later
in the quarter, Killefer announced.
