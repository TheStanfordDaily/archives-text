# War Admiral Races Pompoon 3rd Time
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Md„ May 17 (U.R).—
War Admiral, double victor in the
Kentucky Derby and Pimlico Preak
ness, today was pointed toward a
third tilt with Pompoon in the Bel
mont Stakes at New York, June 5.
The longer distance of a mile and a
half in the Belmont classic was ex
pected to favor the little seal-brown
son of Man o' War. War Admiral
beat Pompoon handily at a mile and
a quarter in the Derby, but barely
nosed out J. H. Louchheim's juvenile
champion of 1936 over the mile and
three-sixteenths route in the Preak
ness Saturday.
