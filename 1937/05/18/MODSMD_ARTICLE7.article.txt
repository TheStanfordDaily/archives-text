## 
### 
VALENCIA, Tuesday, May 18
(UP). â€”Dj\ Juan Negrin, moderate
Socialist leader, today formed a new
"win the war" cabinet to succeed
the government headed by Francisco
Largo Caballero which resigned
Saturday.
The new cabinet does not include
Caballero, who was unable to form
a new cabinet because Communists
refused to support any government
in which the premier also held the
war ministry portfolio. Caballero
had insisted upon holding both
posts.
The new government also does not
include any members of the power
ful general workers union which
supported Caballero, or the C.N.T.
(anarchist federation).
The cabinet is the sixth since the
Spanish Civil War broke out 11
months ago.
