# VanDevanter Leaves Court In Early June On Full Pay
## New Deal Foe Announces Retirement to President; Liberal Line-up Seen 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 18 (UP). —
Justicc Willis Van Devanter, dean of
the Supreme Court conservatives
who have voted almost invariably
against President Roosevelt's New
Deal legislation, today announced his
retirement.
The announcement was made
known in a brief note to President
Roosevelt, who, according to a
source close to the White House,
feels the resignation leaves the Ad
ministration's court program stand
ing at a score of "one up and five
to go."
Was 78 in April
Mr. Van Devanter, who celebrated
his 78th birthday April 17, will quit
the post he has occupied since Jan
uary 3, 1911, on June 2—the day
following the Supreme Court's final
session of this term.
His intention was revealed less
than an hour before the Senate ju
diciary committee voted 10 to 8
against the President's program for
increasing the court to a maximum
of 15 justices.
The judiciary committee vote and
the Van Devanter retirement height
ened strong congressional indications
that Mr. Roosevelt's program is
headed for compromise i-evision or
outright defeat.
New Measures Sought
The Administration immediately
began preparing a compromise, re
portedly with White House approval,
for submission to the Senate. Sen
ator M. M. Logan (D., Ky.), who
sought to limit appointment of addi
tional justices to one each year, said
he believed the compromise would be
accepted in the fioor battle.
Of 22 vital New Deal tests, Justice
Van Devanter has joined his con
servative colleagues—Justices George
Sutherland, Pierce Butler and Mc-
Reynolds—in condemning 13.
Among cases which Mr. Van Dev
anter had voted against were NRA,
AAA, "hot oil" legislation, the Fra
zier-Lemke Act, the Railroad Re
tirement Act and the original Guffey
coal control law. Mr. Van Devanter
was appointed to the court in 1911
by President Taft.
Appointment of a liberal justice
in the place to be vacated would
shift to the liberal jurists the bal
ance of power exercised by the con
servative group over the past seven
years.
Conservative Minority
With a liberal member in Mr. Van
Devanter's place, the liberal bloc
will consist of four members, the
same number that hitherto has
comprised the conservative bloc.
They, then, will need only the vote
of cither Mr. Hughes or Mr. Rob
erts to carry the court.
Mr. Van Devanter's retirement
will materially reduce the import
anpe of the impending social secur
ity act test cases.
Should unemployment insurance
and old age pensions be condemned
by a five-to-four vote, a rehearing 1
petition could be granted in the fall
by a five-to-four vote, which might j
well result in a reversal of the spring
decision.
President Roosevelt said later he
has not yet considered an appointee !
to fill the vacancy. He declined a j
direct reply when asked if Mr. Van i
Devanter's retirement would affect
his court plan.

Was 78 in April
Mr. Van Devanter, who celebrated
his 78th birthday April 17, will quit
the post he has occupied since Jan
uary 3, 1911, on June 2—the day
following the Supreme Court's final
session of this term.
His intention was revealed less
than an hour before the Senate ju
diciary committee voted 10 to 8
against the President's program for
increasing the court to a maximum
of 15 justices.
The judiciary committee vote and
the Van Devanter retirement height
ened strong congressional indications
that Mr. Roosevelt's program is
headed for compromise i-evision or
outright defeat.
New Measures Sought
The Administration immediately
began preparing a compromise, re
portedly with White House approval,
for submission to the Senate. Sen
ator M. M. Logan (D., Ky.), who
sought to limit appointment of addi
tional justices to one each year, said
he believed the compromise would be
accepted in the fioor battle.
Of 22 vital New Deal tests, Justice
Van Devanter has joined his con
servative colleagues—Justices George
Sutherland, Pierce Butler and Mc-
Reynolds—in condemning 13.
Among cases which Mr. Van Dev
anter had voted against were NRA,
AAA, "hot oil" legislation, the Fra
zier-Lemke Act, the Railroad Re
tirement Act and the original Guffey
coal control law. Mr. Van Devanter
was appointed to the court in 1911
by President Taft.
Appointment of a liberal justice
in the place to be vacated would
shift to the liberal jurists the bal
ance of power exercised by the con
servative group over the past seven
years.
Conservative Minority
With a liberal member in Mr. Van
Devanter's place, the liberal bloc
will consist of four members, the
same number that hitherto has
comprised the conservative bloc.
They, then, will need only the vote
of cither Mr. Hughes or Mr. Rob
erts to carry the court.
Mr. Van Devanter's retirement
will materially reduce the import
anpe of the impending social secur
ity act test cases.
Should unemployment insurance
and old age pensions be condemned
by a five-to-four vote, a rehearing 1
petition could be granted in the fall
by a five-to-four vote, which might j
well result in a reversal of the spring
decision.
President Roosevelt said later he
has not yet considered an appointee !
to fill the vacancy. He declined a j
direct reply when asked if Mr. Van i
Devanter's retirement would affect
his court plan.
WASHINGTON, May 18 (UP). —
Justicc Willis Van Devanter, dean of
the Supreme Court conservatives
who have voted almost invariably
against President Roosevelt's New
Deal legislation, today announced his
retirement.
The announcement was made
known in a brief note to President
Roosevelt, who, according to a
source close to the White House,
feels the resignation leaves the Ad
ministration's court program stand
ing at a score of "one up and five
to go."
