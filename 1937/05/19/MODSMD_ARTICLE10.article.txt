# Wilbur Cites Need for Film Legislation
## Article Sees Cause For Mediocre Movie In Forced Book Blocking 
### SARAH SERGIS 
Elimination of compulsory block
booking will not automatically pro
vide better movies, but it's the first
step in that direction, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, president of the Motion
Picture Research Council, will point
out in an article for the June issue
! of the Journal of the American As
i sociation of University Women.
"If selective booking is substitut
j ed it will at least break down the
stock alibi of the organized industry
by making each link in the chain
from the producer to the theater pa
-1 Iron responsible for bringing better
' pictures before the public," Dr. Wil-
I bur writes.
Legislation Needed
But legislation is necessary even

, .
; i eturn on good pictures as com
pared to poor pictures has not led
to an improvement of general out
put. Proof of this is contained in
figures provided by the Educational
Screen magazine. Of 353 films rated
''excellent" 45 per cent were box of
fice successes, while of the 1392 rated
i "poor" only 8 per cent were money
makers.
"Surely there is sound reason to
challenge a practice that guarantees
; a dumping ground for mediocre pic
tures at the rate of four to one, par
ticularly when eminent producers
I and directors say quite frankly that
they are deliberately produced as
"\B" and "C" pictures," Dr. Wilbur
declares.
Many Poor Films
Since 1934 there have been some
highly commendable films, Dr. Wil
i our concedes, but there have been
too many "shoddy, stupid, and com
monplace pictures" which the movie
; going public in most small neighbor
j hood theaters has had to accept un
{der the prevailing system of ex
hibitor contracts.
j He asks whether the movie indus
| try will clean house of its own ac
cord despite the loss, or whether the
sunse of gain is so powerful that only
( outsiders through pressure on legis-
I lators can perform the operation.
Regardless of the remedy follow
ed, Dr. Wilbur sees a need for some
form of grading pictures as to qual
| ity and suitability to juvenile audi
: ences in order that exhibitors can
know just what type of goods they
may purchase.
Ultimately he visions legislation
for selective booking as the most
piobable panacea to an "intolerable

Many Poor Films
