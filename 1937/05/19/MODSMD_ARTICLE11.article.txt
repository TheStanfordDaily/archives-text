# Council men, Frosh Will Discuss Code
## 
### 
Thursday evening in Encina will
be enlivened by Honor Code discus
sions between members of Men's
Council and the freshmen. Each
member of the Council will under
take to answer questions for three
tables. The groups will meet indi
vidually in the various sponsors'
rooms.
This plan has been decided on as
the most informative for the frosh
after discussion of several plans in
meetings of Men's Council. The
idea was originated after it was
found that the average student
knows too little about the honor
code, according to Bill Quade, chair
man of Men's Council.
