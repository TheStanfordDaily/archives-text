# Campus Project Held Up by Strike
## 
### 
Steel for the new Cubberley Edu
cation Building, due on the campus
in the middle of July, will be held
up two weeks because of the cur
rent steel strike in Pittsburgh.
Concrete was scheduled to be
poured for the structure June 12,
but this date probably will be'chang
ed two weeks later, according to
John Levers, superintendent of con
struction.
This material was ordered by the
George Wagner Construction Com
pany, contractors for the Education
Building, from the Judson Pacific
Company of San Francisco. Exactly
one year ago, construction on the
new theater was held up because
Pittsburgh floods delayed the deliv
ery of structural steel.
