# Pre-Reg Plan Wins Review From Wilbur
## Frosh To Pay $4 Each; Sponsor Appointments To Be Made in Spring 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
President Wilbur will reconsider
the pre-registration program this
morning when George Ditz, orien
tation chairman, presents his com
mittee's revised plan, it was revealed
in Ex Committee last night.
Ditz's new plan calls for student -
; financing entirely. Each freshman
will pay $4 to join the pre-registra
tion activities. This, Ditz hopes, will
overcome Dr. Wilbur's objection to
the administration's paying $3000.
Actual cost of last year's three-day
I program could not be determined,
; however, by the Accounting Office.
| Expenses for different items were
recorded in different accounts, mak
ing total cost impossible to ascer
tain.
I Sponsors Will Help
Ditz's report to the president ad
j vises appointing Encina sponsors
I now, having them on hand when the
; freshmen arrive in September.
J Business of adjusting the new men
I to Encina will be largely the spon
j sors'.
| Freshmen themselves — outstand
j ing leaders in high school—may take
| part of the discipline responsibility
] next year from the sponsors who
! will, if the program goes through,
j become "more advisers than police
| men."
All-Quarter Orientation
Orientation for the first-year stu
; dents, according to Ditz, would not
lend registration day. Special frosh
! jolly-ups, exchange dinnei's, and
j other affairs will be held through-
I out fall quarter. The "dope" on re
! iations with California will be es
j pecially emphasized.
The barbecue on Stanford Hill,
j campus tours, assembly, and other
j main points of last fall's program
I will be retained.
Meanwhile, caught in the web of
j its own date rulings, Ex Committee
S decided to pay for its own party.
Every spring the Committee has
| granted itself some $40 for a party
in San Francisco or a dinner in
Palo Alto.
But last night Chuck Fontius,
student manager, doubted the whole
business of student organizations
party-partying on A.S.S.U. funds.
Draw the Line?
"Student officers work hard all
year and really deserve some recom
pense," Fontius said, "but where
will we draw the line? Everyone
will want a party."
Once the Committee had ruled
j that the A.S.S.U. will no longer
I sponsor "wine, women, and song,"
j President Reynolds asked: "Now
| about our party, do you still want
I one?"
j All members agreeing, Jean Roy
; nolds and Joe Weiner were appoint
!ed to handle it. Both scratched their
j heads over this—should Ex Commit
: tee grant itself a date? Decision:
j not necessary.
"Should we take a vote whether
I we may bring outside dates?" Miss
| Reynolds wondered. She decidcd to
'thresh it out with each member in
j dividually.
Barbara Kimball suggested the
| party take in the new San Francisco
I play, "Dead End." Reynolds smiled,
I countered with: "Rather appropriate,
I eh?"
Band (Jets Keg Dancc
Fall quarter registration dance
was granted to the Stanford band;
the profits will go for two band
j scholarships.
Awarded minor letters for polo
i were: Lloyd Brooke, Archie Derby,
] Jim Fullerton, Bob Fullerton, Joe
Hoenigsberg, Al Hyde, George
Keyes, Don MacAusland, Herb Mc-
Clintock, Russ Rassmussen, and
Bob Wallace.

in Ex Committee last night.
Ditz's new plan calls for student -
; financing entirely. Each freshman
will pay $4 to join the pre-registra
tion activities. This, Ditz hopes, will
overcome Dr. Wilbur's objection to
the administration's paying $3000.
Actual cost of last year's three-day
I program could not be determined,
; however, by the Accounting Office.
| Expenses for different items were
recorded in different accounts, mak
ing total cost impossible to ascer
tain.
I Sponsors Will Help
Ditz's report to the president ad
j vises appointing Encina sponsors
I now, having them on hand when the
; freshmen arrive in September.
J Business of adjusting the new men
I to Encina will be largely the spon
j sors'.
| Freshmen themselves — outstand
j ing leaders in high school—may take
| part of the discipline responsibility
] next year from the sponsors who
! will, if the program goes through,
j become "more advisers than police
| men."
All-Quarter Orientation
Orientation for the first-year stu
; dents, according to Ditz, would not
lend registration day. Special frosh
! jolly-ups, exchange dinnei's, and
j other affairs will be held through-
I out fall quarter. The "dope" on re
! iations with California will be es
j pecially emphasized.
The barbecue on Stanford Hill,
j campus tours, assembly, and other
j main points of last fall's program
I will be retained.
Meanwhile, caught in the web of
j its own date rulings, Ex Committee
S decided to pay for its own party.
Every spring the Committee has
| granted itself some $40 for a party
in San Francisco or a dinner in
Palo Alto.
But last night Chuck Fontius,
student manager, doubted the whole
business of student organizations
party-partying on A.S.S.U. funds.
Draw the Line?
"Student officers work hard all
year and really deserve some recom
pense," Fontius said, "but where
will we draw the line? Everyone
will want a party."
Once the Committee had ruled
j that the A.S.S.U. will no longer
I sponsor "wine, women, and song,"
j President Reynolds asked: "Now
| about our party, do you still want
I one?"
j All members agreeing, Jean Roy
; nolds and Joe Weiner were appoint
!ed to handle it. Both scratched their
j heads over this—should Ex Commit
: tee grant itself a date? Decision:
j not necessary.
"Should we take a vote whether
I we may bring outside dates?" Miss
| Reynolds wondered. She decidcd to
'thresh it out with each member in
j dividually.
Barbara Kimball suggested the
| party take in the new San Francisco
I play, "Dead End." Reynolds smiled,
I countered with: "Rather appropriate,
I eh?"
Band (Jets Keg Dancc
Fall quarter registration dance
was granted to the Stanford band;
the profits will go for two band

Awarded minor letters for polo
