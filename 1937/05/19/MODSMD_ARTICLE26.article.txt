# Committee To Outline Three New Courses
## Students Request Typing, Shorthand, Cooking As Curriculum Additions 
### 
Working on the suggestion of stu- !
dents for courses in typing, .short- ,
hand, and cooking, the Student-Fac- j
ulty Relations Committee yesterday
appointed a sub-committee to han- i
die the question.
The committee will work on the
possibilities of arranging a set pro- !
cedure for having typing and short- |
hand courses for no credit, either on
campus or in Palo Alto. It was !
pointed out during the meeting that
a shorthand course is now available |
at the University in the psychology ,
department under the direction of
Professor J. E. Coover. The investi- i
gation is being held due to the many
requests from students.
The relations committee is con- j
(acting all department heads to ac- i
quaint them with the organization, |
and to request criticisms by the pro- 1
lessors of student attitude in classes, j
Other suggestions during the meet- j
ing were for a course in going to i
Europe. It was decided that lectures |
in the manner of the Tuesday eve- !
ning series, arranged for those in- |
terested, would be preferable.
A plan for cataloguing campus |
activities and the participants in
those activities was forwarded. Those |
interested in working on this cata- j
lugue committee are asked to leave I
their names with Jim Reynolds or at J
the A.S.S.U. office.
