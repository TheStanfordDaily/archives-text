ANI) FOR
POLO, TOO

The Oregon State polo team which
is on the campus to play the Cards
today and Friday is remarkable for
its size—that is, its size is what
makes it remarkable. Polo is not a
very strong sport on the Coast, and
it only takes four men to make up a
team anyway, but the Beavers have
brought down 10 players, three man
agers, and the coach.
Now, when you can send that big
a polo team from as far away as
Oregon—and mind you, the team ar
rived here Monday and will spend
almost a week here —it means only
one thing. Since such a venture
means mazuma to any school, Ore
gon Stale must be shelling out quite
a stack of stones for this trip.
They tell me, my grapevine
friends do, that the wherewithal for
this little junket is comink from a
fortunate series of circumstances
that involved motorizing the Ore
gon State R.O.T.C. a little while
ago. They had an appropriation or
some such thing that more than cov
ered putting engines into the Beaver
R.0.T.C., and since that division
handles polo the same as at Stan
ford, it looked like a tine chance to
send a few boys oft on a trip for
their efforts during the season.
This competition today and Fri
day winds up the Orange year of the
galloping sport, so the team mem
bers hope to go out with a blaze of
glory. If they could win both of
these games and get even for the
two trouncings they took earlier in
the year when the Indians went
north,' they could go home happy
with the thought of a swell trip
and happy ending and all that sort
of tiling. They won't win, though, so
they just have to get along with
the trip a? a glee-inducer.

DON'T SELL
THEM OUT YET

Not so long ago, when the water '
polo team finished its season, every- '
body in the know started feeling
sorry for Coach Ncrt Thornton.
The} couldn't see where he was gc
ing to get a team for next fall, see
ing as how he lost four of his first
seven men.
However, funny things always
happen around Encina Pools, be
cause year after year Stanford al
ways manages to get out a water
polo team that won't take any back
talk from any college team . There
have been men graduating before
this year, and yet the team is al
ways right on top.
This spring again Nort sees the
possibility of having another con- j
i'erence champ, in spite of the fact |
that he lost so many men. He will |
have back first-stringers Jack
Loupe, Bill Hanna, and Johnny
Lamb, and then there are several
others who look quite promising.
For instance, Dick Clarke, the husky
sprint sensation of the varsity swim
ming team this spring, seems to be
coming along in great style, and
may make it awfully tough for con
ference opponents next year.
Then there's Dick Hoover, young
er brother of graduating Bob, who is
no slouch, to take over his broth
er's duties. He is probably the most
promising player Thornton has out
there, and since he will play his
first year of varsity competition next
season, he might be useful for some
time.
With several other frosh coming
up, and with those kids already
mentioned staying over from this
year's varsity, Nort is liable to have
some sort of team when autumn
comes again. We'll see just how good
it is when the alumni team offers a
little competition presently.
Incidentally, on that alumni team
there will be Vlad Taranik, the
stocky Russian who played here in
1933, 1934. arid 1935, and who was
good enough to be named an All-
Con I'erence first each year he play
ed. Ho is going to make it tough for
lot of those newcomers, in spite
of the fact Ihat he hasn't been do-
any playing for a long time.
