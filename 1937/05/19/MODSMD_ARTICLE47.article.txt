# P.A.A. Meet Set For Angell Field
## 
### 
Angell Field will definitely be the
setting for Saturday's P.A.A. track
and field meet, it was announced
yesterday, after the San Francisco
20-30 Club, sponsor of the affair,
decided that the 300 seats of the
new oval would be sufficient for
their demands.
Plans still went forward, however,
to hold the 10,000-meter run, 24-lap
special preliminary to the regular
meet, in the stadium at 12:30.
Yesterday Curl Hahurin ran 50
seconds flat in the quarter-mile,
possibly earning himself a berth on
the mile relay team.
Dink Templet'on, in an effort to
get his shot-putters back to their big
push of the week before the U.S.C.
meet, had another four-throw con
test yesterday, but Reynolds was
the only man on form, and barely
dusted the 50-foot mark.
Spaniards brought grapefruit to
Florida in the 16th century.
