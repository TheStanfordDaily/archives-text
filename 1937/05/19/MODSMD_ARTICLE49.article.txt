WHEN man bites dog, when bull throws
professor (Chappie ad), even when the
hypercritical Daily gently pats an unaccustomed
Ex Committee back, though ever so lightly—
that's news.
Too many dissenting tirades on tactical
troubles at the Tuesday evening round table
have rattled around in this body type. The word
"Ex Committee" (pardon) carries some sort of
a defeated ring. The thrill is gone.
Still there is a serious substantiation for Daily
tirades, because the little gang that bulls over
Stanford's student governmental woes is the
one which acts officially on them, and these col
umns are designed to comment on that action.
But here is the news, the Ex Committee back
pat.
Last night the knights of the A.S.S.U. round
table decided not to give a party for themselves
on A.S.S.U. funds—an innovation in Stanford
student government.
For years it's been customary for the knights
to make a night of it in the City. Funds were
budgeted for the fling this year.
But Ex Committee decided that if it had a
party, Dramatic Council should have funds for
a party, and the party, party custom should
apply to Men's Council, Women's Council and
all the rest. So rather than dabble with line
drawing, Ex Committee went on record as op
posing parties on A.S.S.U. funds, and dinged its
own.
Tritely "the action is highly commendable."
But even more commendable was the Commit
tee's decision to have its fling anyway—on the
individual pocketbook.
In one evening Ex Committee dings itself,
and The Daily doesn't ding Ex Committee. All
in one evening. That, gentlemen, is news.—
G.F.
