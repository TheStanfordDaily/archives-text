AN intolerable situation in the movie indus
try is analyzed by Dr. Wilbur, president of
the Motion Pictures Research Council, in an
article soon to be published.
He makes this simple, but point-ful compari
son: Suppose a woman goes to market to buy
12 fresh eggs, only to be told, "You may have
four good fresh eggs, but you are compelled
to buy four half-bad and four definitely bad
eggs to make out the dozen." That's the exact
position of American movie exhibitors.
Chief reason for the bad eggs is the take-all
or-none system of block booking, by which pro
ducers and distributors push four times as many
poor pictures down the public throat as those
classed as excellent.
Dr. Wilbur sees greatest fault in the fact that
eminent producers and directors are deliber
ately turning out "B" and "C" films to dump
onto a market which guarantees booking for
mediocre pictures at the rate of four to one.
In other words, when the eggs are unavoid
ably bad, there is some excuse, but when the
hens make no bones about admitting they are
laying rotten eggs, it's time to either check up
on the hens or refuse the product.
Dr. Wilbur socs these two possible solutions.

Either the industry "must respond to sincere and
vital criticism by doing its own surgery, or out
siders must legislate the operation."
If the latter solution were adopted, the pri
mary move is the elimination of block booking
and the substitution of selective booking. This
would break up the traditional like-it-or-lump-it
set-up and instill a natural, competitive situation
in which each link in the chain, from picture pro
ducer to theater patron, carries its own respon
sibility.
Obviously the public wants the best eggs it
can get. And also obviously, the industry would
rather lay some bad ones with the good.
Eventual control seems the only solution,
according to Dr. Wilbur. "Why not hurry up the
process?"â€”G. F.
