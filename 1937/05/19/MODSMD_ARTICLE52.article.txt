# OUR HASHER, Jr.
## 
### 
STANFORD men are not famed for the sobriety of
their judgments or their good luck when it comes
to women. Some are rash enough to fall in love; some
are so foolish that they spend money on the girls; and
some wander far enough from the path of righteous
ness to write letters to their friends of the weaker sex
back home.
But think how disillusioned they would be if they
really knew what was happening, under their noses
or behind their backs as the case might be. Stringing
you along, it seems, is one of the more highly per
fected feminine sciences.
The accompanying folio of correspondence will
show what actually happens to the rough who asks
one of the home-town beautifuls for a date.
Stanford, Wednesday
I)EAR JEAN:
Well, here I am back in Paly, on the old farm,
9,000 acres to play in and that sort of thing. How are
you and your mother and father? Give them my re
gards.
We are having the Freshman Prom down here. It is
the big dance of the year. Donald Duck and the Walt
Disney Screen' Orchestra will be here to play for us,
if we can scrape up the $5000 to pay them. Will you
come with me to it? I'd like awfully to have you.
Please answer me as soon as possible as the dance
comes a week from Saturday.
Yours with love, Junior
Berkeley, Wednesday
JEAN DEAR:
Every time I think of you I say to myself: "Quel
beau brin dc fillc!" That's French, and very compli
mentary.
How about a couple of dates a week from Friday
and Saturday? I don't know quite what we'll do,
but something. Let me know as- soon as you can.
Love, J. Rutherford Jones

]\| Y OWN DEAR, Darling Junie-kins:
ITI STOP!
Take a deep breath!
Lean against the wall and prepare for a shock.
I am actually writing you an epistle back within the
week. Now don't have a fit but inasmuch as I am
answering your last epistle so promptly, I feel SURE
you won't mind if I make this epLstle short and to the
point. (Here a marginal diagram of a point labeled:
"Don't point, apex.")
In short, I won't be able to come. Mother says I
have to stay in at least one night that week-end and
we're having a play at school that I simply must go
to Friday. You know how those kind of things are.
And another thing, you great big FRENCH STU
DENT, you! What docs "Quel beau brin de fillc"
mearw? I translated it as: "What a brain the girl has."
Dr would wench be better? Is that right? Please write
and tell me right away.
Goodbye now, Jean
P.S.: How are the wimmin at Stanford? J.

Western Union
Rutherford Dearest:
Accept for both dates. Loads love.
Your Jean
STANFORD men are not famed for the sobriety of
their judgments or their good luck when it comes
to women. Some are rash enough to fall in love; some
are so foolish that they spend money on the girls; and
some wander far enough from the path of righteous
ness to write letters to their friends of the weaker sex
back home.
But think how disillusioned they would be if they
really knew what was happening, under their noses
or behind their backs as the case might be. Stringing
you along, it seems, is one of the more highly per
fected feminine sciences.
The accompanying folio of correspondence will
show what actually happens to the rough who asks
one of the home-town beautifuls for a date.
Stanford, Wednesday
I)EAR JEAN:
Well, here I am back in Paly, on the old farm,
9,000 acres to play in and that sort of thing. How are
you and your mother and father? Give them my re
gards.
We are having the Freshman Prom down here. It is
the big dance of the year. Donald Duck and the Walt
Disney Screen' Orchestra will be here to play for us,
if we can scrape up the $5000 to pay them. Will you
come with me to it? I'd like awfully to have you.
Please answer me as soon as possible as the dance
comes a week from Saturday.
Yours with love, Junior
Berkeley, Wednesday
JEAN DEAR:
Every time I think of you I say to myself: "Quel
beau brin dc fillc!" That's French, and very compli
mentary.
How about a couple of dates a week from Friday
and Saturday? I don't know quite what we'll do,
but something. Let me know as- soon as you can.
Love, J. Rutherford Jones
Home, Friday
]\| Y OWN DEAR, Darling Junie-kins:
ITI STOP!
Take a deep breath!
Lean against the wall and prepare for a shock.
I am actually writing you an epistle back within the
week. Now don't have a fit but inasmuch as I am
answering your last epistle so promptly, I feel SURE
you won't mind if I make this epLstle short and to the
point. (Here a marginal diagram of a point labeled:
"Don't point, apex.")
In short, I won't be able to come. Mother says I
have to stay in at least one night that week-end and
we're having a play at school that I simply must go
to Friday. You know how those kind of things are.
And another thing, you great big FRENCH STU
DENT, you! What docs "Quel beau brin de fillc"
mearw? I translated it as: "What a brain the girl has."
Dr would wench be better? Is that right? Please write
and tell me right away.
