THAT'S AN IDEA
"IF YOU have an idea and you think it'a a good
one," said the man, "don't you bother what any
one says about it. Just go ahead and work it out.
You may even surprise yourself."
To the group of students sitting around the table
that noon, such words sounded fine. Through each of
them went a thrill. Suddenly each one of them turned
and looked at his neighbor and then, as if embarrassed,
quickly began fiddling with his spoon.

Each one of them felt the knowledge of the ages
within himself, tried desperately to get a hold on it
all, yet couldn't just at that moment.
Every one of them had had ideas, ideas that had
perished either in their own minds, or in the hands of
their fellows. Such words brought new light into their
eyes.

YOUTH of otday, or of any day, is a gold mine of
ideas. The ideas are crude and unfinished, but
why shouldn't they be. They've not yet had time to
ripen. Most of them will never ripen.
For ideas hanging on the juicy boughs of youth,
will be plucked by the iconoclasts, dropped to earth,
never to ripen.

The average student of today is all too free with
his laughter. Whenever someone thinks of anything
vital and necessary, something that might change the
course of the world, he is greeted with laughter. Why
a person laughs at ideas has never been quite clear.
Perhaps great thoughts scare the unthinking average
and they are embarrassed and to relieve themselves
they laugh.
But by laughing they are damming up the springs.
The thinker is sensitive, otherwise he wouldn't be a
thinker. He's full of thoughtfulness, not a brute ma
chine. Believing deeply in his convictions, he knows
that given time and encouragement, nothing could
stop him. Yet wanting to share his thoughts lie tells
others. Stinging laughter poisons him.
The thinker is soon branded as unsocial. He rc
* * * *
fuses to speak to others, is really afraid to say anthing.
He's not unsocial. He's terribly conscious of what it's
all about, yet rather than send his feelings crashing
against the walls of his stomach, he keeps his mouth
tightly closed.
Next time someone says something that sounds
good, eveti if you don't know why it sounds good, it
might be a good idea to sit back and listen. Listen,
then help.
