# CAMPUS OPINION
## WE THANK YOU 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I use your columns to express
what I should like to be able to say
individually to each of the many
students who contributed to the
success of the Mothers' Club Spring
Fete at the Mills Estate? Our thanks
go to you as Editor for the helpful
publicity you have given as well as
for the editorial of Tuesday.
The co-operation of the A.S.S.U.
in lending the Public Address Sys
tem, with a capable student operator,
meant that all the hundreds of guests
scattered about the lawns could en
joy the program.
We hope that all of the students
who took time at this busy season to
participate in the colorful pageant of
"the 'seventies" sensed enough ap
preciation in the audience to repay
them for their efforts.
The particular ones who helped
yesterday may not be those who
profit by the financial returns, but
they may have real satisfaction in
knowing that the Rest Home fund
for next year is assured of a good
start.
And that brings me to another
point — the Rest Homes are main
tained entirely as a service project
for students, not as a reform school
for freshmen as the Tuesday Bull
Session would indicate. The Con
valescent Home, which is Stanford's
charity for underprivileged children,
is the place where Encina men work
out sentences imposed by Men's
Council. Please do not confuse the
two homes supported by Mothers'
Club—which incidentally have en
abled nearly a thousand students to
carry on in spite of illness this year
—with the Home for Convalescent
Children on the old Stanford Estate.
