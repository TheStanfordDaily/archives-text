## 
### 
A lot can happen in a week-end—
15 major mishaps to be exact —ac-
cording to Alpha O Betty Kline and
Brannerite Stan Kreugh, who jour
neyed to Hotel Ahwahnee in Yosem
ite over last week-end as winners of
the Masque Ball prize trip.
Snowbanks and detours were bad
enough until the undaunted Stanford
couple came driving down from the
Point and, as Betty put it, "We
pushed a car with some people in it
off a cliff. It wasn't an awfully big
cliff and nobody was killed."
Climax of the whole thing was the
hotel manager's definition of a week
end—one night and three meals.
They missed all but one of the meals.
(They lost track of the minor mis
haps.)
