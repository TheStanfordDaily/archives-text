# Students Strike For Fired Teacher
## 
### 
HAYWARD, May 18 (UP). â€”
Twelve hundred students of Hay
ward Union High School went out
on strike today, demanding the re
instatement of Vice-Principal Hen
ry S. Hampton. The students de
clared they would not return to their
classes until Hampton was restored
to his position.
The school board of trustees noti
fied Hampton last Saturday that his
contract would not be renewed for
the next semester. Culminating a
heated movement that has gained
momentum during the past two
days, the students voted the strike
at a meeting of the student body
this afternoon.
