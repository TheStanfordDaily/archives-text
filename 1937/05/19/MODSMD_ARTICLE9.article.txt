# Encina, Class A Hotels Use Same Quality Food
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN HARRY PRESS 
"What can they be serving Junior there at Encina that makes him
fuss so much about the food?"
This is the Stanford version of the question that always perplexes
Mamma when she has sent Sonny away from home for the first timeâ€”to
college.
Is the meat dry or raw?
Is the butter rancid?
Does Encina food fail to compare satisfactorily with Wednesday night's
Row cuisine if he happens to have joined a house? Or does the Row slip

>in a once-a-week steak on Wednes
day to make Junior think he's get
ting something?
'Class A' Meat
Facts are a better basis for opin
ion than rumor, so let's go back into
the kitchen to see what quality food
is used, how it is purchased and
prepared.
Meat, for instance, is of the same
quality as that used in the Class A
hotels in San Francisco. It is bought,
not by the "side," but in smaller
cuts, according to need, so that
stew and hamburger will not be an
every-other-day dish.
Hanging at 38-40 degrees in the
Encina meat icebox this morning arc
lamb chops for tonight's dinner,
round steak for tomorrow night's
swiss steak, and some Swift's ham.
At Encina, one-half pound of meat
is allowed per person per meal, as
compared with one-third of a pound
in hotels and restaurants.
Milk for 500
A glance at the amount of dairy
products used by Encina Commons
in a typical week gives an idea of
what it .takes to serve 500 typical
t'rosh.
In these six days were used 8,050
ten-ounce bottles of milk plus 170
gallons of milk for cooking, eight
gallons of buttermilk, 65 gallons of
table cream, 12 gallons of pastry
cream, 84 gallons of ice cream, 360
dozen eggs, and 450 pounds of but
ter.
Perhaps the knowledge that milk,
butter, and eggs arrive daily will
help to refute rumors of sourness,
rancidity, and staleness.
Keep It Cold
A large refrigeration plant helps
keep Encina's food fresh by produc
ing the same cooling force as would
one ton of ice per day. In addition
to these are three electric ice boxes
with a total capacity of 550 cubic
feet.
Representative of Encina's modern
kitchen equipment is its bakeshop,

which supplies baked goods to the
Union Cellar and Dining Room, and
the Encina store, as well as to Encina
Dining Halls.
Capable of baking at one time the
60 to 70 pies necessary for one meal,
the bakeshop is a larger plant than
most small commercial bakeries. All
butterhorns and snails used in cam
l pus dining halls are baked in this
shop.
