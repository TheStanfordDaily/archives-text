## 
### 
Hugh Eadie, "A" student known
for his bare-feet-and-sheet-garbed
appearances on the Quad, was ar
rested by the police at 9:30 yesterday
morning at Sequoia for disturbing
the peace and "exceptional miscon
duct" which began at 5 a.m. when
Eadie aroused the entire hall by
running up and down the fire es
cape.
Gordy Davis, campus cop, said the
rumor that Eadie had struck a pro
fessor was unfounded, since Eadie
did not leave Sequoia and there was
no professor there at the time.
Eadie is held at the Palo Alto
police station pending the arrival of
his parents from San Francisco. The
preliminary hearing will take place
this afternoon.
