# Wilbur Upholds Movie Teaching
## Screen Medium Superior To Books, Says Prexy 
### 
Calling the screen a universal me
dium with which books cannot vie
and only a very superior school may
excell, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
speaking before the Union Public
Affairs Dinner last evening, declared
that the motion picture can be turn
ed into an extremely effective edu
cational instrument.
"The screen makes possible 70 per
cent retention reaching the human
consciousness as it does both through
the visual and auditory senses," said
Dr. Wilbur, who is president of the
Motion Picture Research Council.
According to investigations con
ducted by the council, the movies
are the most powerful single instru
ment in education affecting the con
duct, behavior patterns, morals, and
even the health notably of the
younger spectators.
The use of moving picture theaters
in the morning hours when they are
vacant as substitutes for classrooms
was among suggestions made by Dr.
Wilbur in advocating the alignment
of movies with the process of
teaching.
This might decrease the number of
teachers necessary in the present
educational system, Dr. Wilbur pre
dicted. but as has been proved, the
quality and retention of learning
would be increased.
As yet educational films have not
been perfected because there has
not been a market for them but Dr.
Wilbur believes that as soon as pub
lic opinion so demands pictures of
great value will be turned out. He
predicted the future traffic of such
pictures would be comparable to
the sale of textbooks in schools to
day.
