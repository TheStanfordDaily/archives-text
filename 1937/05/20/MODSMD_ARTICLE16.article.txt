# Tunes From 'Down Hatch' Go On Sale
## Six Songs To Be Printed, Sold at Performances; Play Sell-out Expected 
### 
Due to the success of the publica
tion of the songs from last fall's Big
Game Gaieties, six of the hit tunes
from Barnstormers' "Down the
Hatch!" will be printed and on sale
during the intermissions and after
the performance both nights oi the
show, according to Dramatic Man
ager Dick Daugherty.
Among the tunes which will be
published are, "I've Got the Devil to
Thank for You," "Nice Night for It
Isn't It?" "Your Eyes Have It," "Love
in a Mist," "I've Gotta Take Steps,"
and "Down the Hatch!"
Special orchestrations of Mac
Gordon's music have been arranged
by Musical Director Chuck Ransom
for leading singer Shirley Jones,
Larry Randall, Bud Bernhardt, and
the other specialty numbers.
Sell-out Indicated
Since yesterday's seat sale indi
cates a sell-out by the end of the
week, Daugherty urges that all stu
dents planning to attend obtain their
tickets as soon as possible. Seats
may be procured at the A.S.S.U. of
fice for 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.
Three Settings
Co-technical Directors J. P. Calm's
and Gene Callnon's crew has
constructed three separate set
tings for the production, which opens
on the deck of the S. S. Platonic.
Complete with a bridge and prome
nade deck, the scene is typical of a
modern luxury liner.
A second set includes the interiors
of three staterooms on the same ship.
Most impressive of the three, ac
cording to Callnon, is the last scene,
taking place on a tropical island in
the South Seasâ€”haven of Mrs.
Hatch's floating university cruise.
An ominous idol, looming through a
jungle clearing, is the only stage
property.
