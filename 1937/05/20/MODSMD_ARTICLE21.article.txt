# New Theater Praised By Farmer, Mendelowitz

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
"A practical solution of a problem involving desire for harmony with
the rest of the campus buildings, economic limitations, and demand for the
finest technical equipment"—thus Professor Edward Farmer and Daniel
Mendelowitz of the Graphic Arts Department characterized the new theater.
On a critical tour through Memorial Hail with a Daily representative the
two campus authorities on art and architecture debited and credited the

►qualities of the new structure.
Style of the building is an inevi
table compromise between the Rom
anesque Revival style of the Quad
and the architecture of a modern
theater built on a limited budget.
The interior is modern Roman
esque simplified to a point of being
almost completely without style. The
only decoration the actual structure
is supplied by straight lines.
According to Professor Farmer
and Mr. Mendelowitz this simplicity
is entirely in keeping with Farm
taste. An extreme modern style
was outlawed because harmony with

the rest of the campus was desired.
Stylized columns, arches, and de
tail give the lobby an attractive
Romanesque appearance. It has been
suggested that the large niche op
posite the main entrance be filled
with the statue, "Isis," now in the
Art Gallery, which was presented to
ex-President Herbert Hoover by the
Belgian government.
Lighting Wins Praise
The lighting fixtures were espe
cially praised by Professor Farmer.
The flat panes of glass arranged on
the ceiling do not give indirect light
ing such as is used in most theaters
to illuminate the architectural fea
tures. Instead, they cast a warm
light directly on the audience, soft
ening the plain lines of the auditor
ium and making it possible to read
programs.
The decorative balconies and
doorways on each side of the stage
form a simple transition from the
body of the theater to the stage. Like
the frame of a picture, they lead
the eye of the spectator directly to
the dramatic scene.
Ornaments Sacrificed
Elaborate ornamentation and ar
chitecture in the theater have wisely
been sacrificed in the interests of
size and the finest technical equip
ment, according to Mr. Mendelowitz.
The seating capacity of the auditor
ium is adequate, and it can be re
duced by half by cutting off the
rear portion of the main floor and
balcony with a drop curtain. The
orchestra pit is unusually large.
The equipment of the mammoth
stage has been declared perfect by
campus actors, producers, and tech
nical men. Under supervision of Phil
Brown, a large sum was spent for
these necessities.
Eminently practical, pleasing in
appearance, and in harmony with
the rest of the Farm buildings, Me
morial Hall receives the authorita
tive okeh of Artmen Farmer and
Mendelowitz.
