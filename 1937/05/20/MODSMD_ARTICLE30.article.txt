# Gate Span Quake Insurance Asked
## 
### 
| SAN FRANCISCO. May 19 CUP).
—Twice the San Francisco tower of
| the Golden Gate bridge quivered so
! violently 23 workers became sea
! sick, and several slid down a 750-
; foot rope and scurried to safety, it
! was revealed today.
The revelation came as bridge di
| rectors were discussing placing of
! $22,400,000 insurance on the struc
! ture.
The shaking, it was emphasized,
! occurred June 6 and 7, 1935, and
[ was due to light earthquakes.
"At that time, the tower had no
cables," explained Clifford Paine,
assistant chief engineer. "As a re
sult. the tower acted like a tuning
fork—it vibrated. But now cables,
weighing millions of pounds, arc up,
and it could never happen again."
