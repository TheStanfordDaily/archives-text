PERHAPS A RECORD
FN TIIE OFFING
Since it is definitely decided that
the Pacific Association meet will be
held on Angell Field this Saturday,
instead of in the stadium, it looks
as though perhaps that mile relay
team is going to have another
chance to set a world's record.
When Kneubuhl, Malott, Mc-
Curdy, and Weiershauser ran 3:12.8
at Fresno they put themselves into
a spot that is very favorable to the
possibility of a new record. 11 the
20-30 Club had decided upon the
stadium as the best place for the
meet, things would have been sad,
but here that chance that came at
Fresno comes once more. *
The track will be fine, provided
one of those haywire spring gales
doesn't start to blow, and the com
petition will be enough to give the
boys plenty of push. California's out
lit ran a close second to the Indians
at Fresno, and it will be right back
this Saturday to make another ef
fort. Of course, Charlie Weiman, the
Bears, third-best 440 man, won't be
running this time, as he did at Fres
no—he has a job, they say, now
that school is out for him, and he
won't leave it—but Brutus Hamilton
can still field a pretty fair team in
Williams, Miller, Watts, and Cleary,
or some other stout-hearted son of
the Gold and Blue.
Where Cal loses Weiman, Stanford
might gain Mahurin in the team,
since he can run a faster quarter
than Kneubuhl, and he won't have
to run a pair of 880's this week, as
he did at Fresno. Kneubuhl is es
sentially a sprinter, 440 yards is a
little too far for him, whereas Ma
hurin is a half-miler who doesn't
waste any time in his first 440.
LITTLE SHORT OF
A NOVELTY, HIMSELF
One of the headliners of the
N.C.A.A. track meet in Berkeley
June 18 and 19 will be Forrest
' Spec" Towns, the Georgia phenom
enon in the 120 highs. Brutus Ham
ilton, Cal coach, calls him the great
est hurdler that ever lived, which is
an observation quite a few people
agree with.
Since Towns holds the world rec
ord at 14.1, a mark that he equalled
eight times in 34 races last year, you
kinda have to concede his greatness.
He has a mark coming up for con
sideration at the next meeting of the
International Federation of 13.7, that
he set when barnstorming around
Norway last year, which if accepted
will be a hurdle mark that athletes
will be shooting at for a long time
to come.
The sinewy southerner will have
quite a little competition from Roy
Slaley of U.S.C., who stepped 14.3
ag;.inst that stadium wind two and
a half weeks ago to establish himself
as a definite threat. Fritz Pollard,
North Dakota colored flash, is an
other who won't be waiting for the
laggards in that meet.
