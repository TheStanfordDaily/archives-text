# Fish Lands Glider, Tears Hole in Wing
## 
### 
VENICE, Calif., May 19 (U.R).â€”
Don Stevens told this one and has
the pictures and fish to prove it: He
landed his power glider in the ocean
some distance off Venice and sat on
a wing to fish. A big barracuda
grabbed the line and pulled him
right through the wing, leaving a
big hole in the fabric.
