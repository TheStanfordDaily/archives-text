Records Broken
The astoundingly slow P.A.A. rec-
I ords that have been much publicized
of late seem to come from two
I causes: The meet has often been run
at metric distances, giving a sepa
i rate set of marks, and the 20-30 boys
! haven't quite kept their books up
to-date, such as:
In 1936 seven of the still listed
records were broken:
Norm Bright's mile was 4:17.3,
| against a listed mark of 4:28.
A1 Blackman's 440 was 47.9 against

Records Broken
The astoundingly slow P.A.A. rec-
I ords that have been much publicized
of late seem to come from two
I causes: The meet has often been run
at metric distances, giving a sepa
i rate set of marks, and the 20-30 boys
! haven't quite kept their books up
to-date, such as:
In 1936 seven of the still listed
records were broken:
Norm Bright's mile was 4:17.3,
| against a listed mark of 4:28.
A1 Blackman's 440 was 47.9 against
a listed mark of 49.2.
Johnny Lyman's shot-put was 52-
71/8, against a listed mark of 51-
I 10%.
