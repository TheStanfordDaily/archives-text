# Varsity Water Poloists Whip Alumni Squad
## Thornton Team Registers Upset Victory; Hanna, Hoover Lead Scorers 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo boys
pulled a surprise in Encina Pools
yesterday afternoon when they
downed the highly touted aggrega
tion of seniors and alumni by the
close margin of 6-5.
The has-beens, minus two of their
stars, Vlud Taranik and Ben Voss,
trailed all the way but closed fast in
the waning seconds of the battle.
Pearson Scores
Pat Pearson, senior guard, scored
the opening shot of the 1937 practice
season to put the old timers out in
lront. Captain Bill Hanna scored
twice and Johnny Lamb sent one in
to give the varsity a 3-1 lead at
half time. Hanna shared high scor
ing honors with little Bob Hoover of
the senior-alumni squad, each man
whizzing three goals into the net.
Cameron Hall showed up surpris
ingly well in the varsity net, stop
ping many of the oldsters' thrusts.
The two frosh flashes lived up to
Nort Thornton's praises, namely:
Bob Plate, forward, and Dick Hoo
ver, guard.
The three veterans, Hanna, Lamb,
and Bellowing Jack Loupe proved
to be the backbone of the varsity
squad, leading the attack throughout
the entire hattle.
Plate Makes Two
Besides Kanna's three points,
Plate sent in two goals and Lamb
scored one to complete the varsity
scoring. Augmenting Hoover's three
goals for the senior-alumni team was
one by Pearson and one by Bob
Savage, frosh, who played the whole
game in place of the missing Voss.
Alec MacKenzie, sprinter on the
swimming team, filled in for Tara
nik on the has-been squad.
Hanna, Plate, and Lamb started
at forwards for the varsity; D. Hoo
ver, Loupe, arid Dick Clarke at
guards; and Hull, goalie; MacKenzie,
B. Hoover, and Bill Clemo started
at forwards for the alumni; Savage,
Pearson, and Don Peterson at
guards; and Captain Bob Haslacher,
goalie.
The interclass water polo series
starts today at 4:30 when the strong
sophomore team faces the equally
strong junior squad. The game can't
be called anything but a toss-up.
The seniors are rated as favorites to
win the championship.
