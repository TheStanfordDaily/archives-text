"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"
THERE are times when you've been waiting
so long for something to happen that when
it linally does, you're so tired you don't care.
We feel just that way about the Nitery.
For some time now, Wednesday has come
each week as the day the "Nitery will open."
But it never has. We suppose the committee in
charge couldn't help the slow decorator, or the
hotel strike, or "Down the Hatch," but these
things have all worn down our patient hopes.
The Nitery was a great idea, still is. But in
the minds of the campus it's turned into no
more than a joke—an old joke at that. And it's
too easy to laugh even a great idea out of ex
istence.
Why not forget about the Nitery this quarter.
One more "Nitery Opens Tomorrow" headline
and we'll go screwy. Finals are almost here
anyway, and people trying to finish up the
year are in no shape for a "gala opening."
Next fall, with this year's nitery-tired seniors
gone and 700 new frosh to entice, the chances
of putting over that pink-walled lobby as a
"Nitery" will be one hundred per cent better.
So for now, let's call the whole thing off.—
