BECAUSE college is what it is, progress in
the field of "how" learning has never quite
matched that of traditional "why" learning.
Which makes Stanford's course in Forms of
Journalistic Writing, and its teacher, Berton J.
Ballard, a national exception to a national rule.
Pointing to the record, Mr. Ballard can show
you that students in his class sold 32 articles
and feature stories last fall, that he has received
50 orders this quarter, and seen articles about
Stanford by his enrollees in such magazines
and newspapers as the American Magazine,
Aviation Magazine, the New York Times and
many others of lesser note.
True, the stuff sold (and paid for) hasn't been
short stories or novels. Mr. Ballard has not
trained his writers in the art of fiction, nor awak
ened in them an appreciation for "good writ
ing." But he will point out that you can't eat
"literature," that you can sell "good stories,"
buying food and paying rent on the proceeds.
Time was, not so long ago, when students
aimed not lower than Scribner's, the Atlantic
Monthly, Harper's Magazine, and other "class"
magazines. For the average immature writer to
place in such a discriminating market was al
most hopeless. Yet for years the futile process
was kept up, not to sell stories, apparently, but
to train in an "art."
The exceptional acceptance was just a "shot
in the arm" to the flagging enthusiasm of most
students, who got nothing more for their efforts
than a letter-grade and practice.
Mr. Ballard is giving them both these old
benefits, and has added a new one, success.
The letter-grade is for those who want to learn,
and who can't dish out the saleable stuff.
The practice isn't on difficult fiction forms,
but in practical "saying what you mean," the
first step in learning to write, and one that
should, in all reason, precede an ambition for
the Pulitzer Prize.
The third and priceless benefit, success, is an
inevitable derivative of the first two. Mr. Bal
lard has made it so by hitching his literary
wagons not to a blazing star, but to a hitching
post that students can actually reach.
Mr. Ballard's writers may never be Thomas
Manns, earning both critical applause and more
than-a-living.
But they will be able to sil down at a type
writer and write a saleable story, and then know
where to sell it.
Grocery bills being what they are, you un
derstand.

Manns, earning both critical applause and more
than-a-living.
But they will be able to sil down at a type
writer and write a saleable story, and then know
where to sell it.
Grocery bills being what they are, you un
derstand.
BECAUSE college is what it is, progress in
the field of "how" learning has never quite
matched that of traditional "why" learning.
Which makes Stanford's course in Forms of
Journalistic Writing, and its teacher, Berton J.
Ballard, a national exception to a national rule.
Pointing to the record, Mr. Ballard can show
you that students in his class sold 32 articles
and feature stories last fall, that he has received
50 orders this quarter, and seen articles about
Stanford by his enrollees in such magazines
and newspapers as the American Magazine,
Aviation Magazine, the New York Times and
many others of lesser note.
True, the stuff sold (and paid for) hasn't been
short stories or novels. Mr. Ballard has not
trained his writers in the art of fiction, nor awak
ened in them an appreciation for "good writ
ing." But he will point out that you can't eat
"literature," that you can sell "good stories,"
buying food and paying rent on the proceeds.
Time was, not so long ago, when students
aimed not lower than Scribner's, the Atlantic
Monthly, Harper's Magazine, and other "class"
magazines. For the average immature writer to
place in such a discriminating market was al
most hopeless. Yet for years the futile process
was kept up, not to sell stories, apparently, but
to train in an "art."
The exceptional acceptance was just a "shot
in the arm" to the flagging enthusiasm of most
students, who got nothing more for their efforts
than a letter-grade and practice.
Mr. Ballard is giving them both these old
benefits, and has added a new one, success.
The letter-grade is for those who want to learn,
and who can't dish out the saleable stuff.
The practice isn't on difficult fiction forms,
but in practical "saying what you mean," the
first step in learning to write, and one that
should, in all reason, precede an ambition for
the Pulitzer Prize.
The third and priceless benefit, success, is an
inevitable derivative of the first two. Mr. Bal
lard has made it so by hitching his literary
wagons not to a blazing star, but to a hitching
post that students can actually reach.
Mr. Ballard's writers may never be Thomas
Manns, earning both critical applause and more
than-a-living.
