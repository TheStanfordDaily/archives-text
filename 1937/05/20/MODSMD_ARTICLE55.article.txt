# Interring Intramural's Inspiration
## 
### 
MIRED in the mud of disinterest, Stanford's
intramural carnival plan which manager
Phil Klauber sought to pull into reality, seems
doomed for another year in the asphalt pits of
unrealized ideals.
Lacking support from its supporters, and com
plicated by the demands of guasi-supporters,
the plan, patterened after one successfully used
at California this year, and definitely a good
one, will have to wait.
The idea is this. During the spring a single
day is devoted tt> intramural finals when every
thing Jrom handball to swimming comes into

its own. For one day intramural—sport for the
sport of it—reigns, and the gods of intercolle
giate competition and the student body can
watch.
In the East and at Cal the idea has gone well.
At Stanford it was killed by those who felt that
conflict between various sports, if finals were
all run on one day, would make it impractical.
Because men double up in mural, the impossi
bility of one contestant being several places
at the same time was the obvious fly in the
mural day ointment.
But these difficulties can be overcome by
stretching the intramural carnival into a two
or three-day event, and spacing the individual
finals sufficiently.
Next spring the idea may come up again,
and someone else will try to pull it out of
the ooze. And if it stays stuck then, it will
probably be revived the next year.
Eventually, despite the sour grapemen, Stan
ford will follow the steps of the country's lead
ing colleges in boosting mural athletics with an
intramural carnival.
Eventually.—G. F.
