# OUR HASHER

### 
MY DAY
VTEXT we come to unfinished business.
Oh, yes, the Our Hasher book. Remember? The
book that 13 people, including Gist and myself, signed
for at the Cellar Cigar Counter? Well, it went to bed
yesterday (this distinguishes it from Our Hasher).
This is all very funny, because it should have gone to
bed last week (this does not distinguish it from Our
Hasher), and it means that the Press won't be able to
get it printed, bound, and gagged until a couple of
days before finals.
I hope nobody takes it for a blue book, or a due
boar boring from within.
Besides, it probably will be green, like the grass,
and The Daily office, and the statue of Isis, garbage,
and my head.
The book will be very humorous. This is due to the
fact that the type-matter has been very hastily cut
out of all the old Dailies for three years back, and
pasted down on big sheets of paper for photographing.
This makes it funny, because, the old Dailies being very
old, and the type being rather small, nobody will be
able to read it, but the drawings on the margin by
Gist are very good.
Why join the Navy when you can see Jerry Reed
through a porthole?
In addition to all this, I have indexed the book
quite thoroughly, giving the names of such people as
Chef Wong, and the Gloomy Moor, and the lovely Des
demona and Ben Dey, and this is printed in plain type,
which can be read vei"y easily, even though the libel
cannot. This is done for strictly legal reasons.
The spring show hasn't hatched yet.
The book will be 184 pages long, will be bound in
fine, hand-tooled, hand-lettered Moroccan paper, will
be sold (I hope), and Daily want-ads bring results.
Meanwhile, I shall leave with you a thought for
today.
During the winter quarter of the last epoch, a cus
tomer walked into the Stanford Cellar brings results
and asked for a bottle of milk.
"Any deposit on the bottle?" asked the customer.
"Oh, dear no," said the Hasher, "we use the Honor
Code here."
