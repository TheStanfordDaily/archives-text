# BULL SESSION
## STAGE-STRUCK 
### 
/ I OMMANDER : IN-CHIEF of the army of hobgoblins
that haunts American Universities is that old phan
tom, public opinion. Our colleges seem to feel that
their reputations must be kept spotless at any cost
Ajkl frequently they sacrifice free thought to maintain
an imagined popularity with the public.
The frantic efforts of our universities to keep from
being compromised are very similar to those of a
melodrama heroine. And they are just about as neces
sary. Administrations seem to think, when a profes
sor suggests that communism may not have been in
vented by Stan, dear alma mater will have to pay,
and pay, and ditto. They forget that most of the
people whose opinions really matter will be those who
understand modern education and will pay no atten
tion.
* * * *
The majority of those who howl that colleges are
making revolutionists out of our youth, are those who
know nothing about education.
A fow minority pressure groups are responsible for
practically all of the shouting and tumult about "per
version of education." The public, lacking better in
formation, provides an off-stage echo to these howls,
but it really isn't interested one way or another.
The people who chip in when alma mater passes the
hat are the ones who understand her. They arc the
ones who appreciate the fact that colleges are sup
posed to give learning, not bias.
Similarly, when a family slaps a mortgage on the
homestead and decides to send its pride and joy to
college, it makes a careful investigation. It doesn't
judge a university by hearsay, but tries to find out
the facts about it.
* * * *
B", 1 : still, our colleges tremble for their reputations
like a movie star with a morality clause in her
contract. When students stage a minor riot about
something, it is not the display of animal spirits that
makes deans shudder. It is the terrifying thought of
what the "public" will think. When a sociology pro
fessor runs a survey on student morals, it is not amaze
ment that makes trustees cower behind their secre
.taries' skirts. It is fear of the rebound.
* * * *
Our colleges are like stage struck school girls pos
ing in front of a mirror. The vast and critical audience
they self-consciously imagine, is non-existent. The
public 4s too busy trying to shake the world down for
a living, to pay more than passing attention to edu
cation.
Moreover, those who do take an interest in what
he colleges say and do have become a #reat deal more
olerant in recent years. People tire beginning to
"ealize that the present state of affairs is not exactly
perfect. It is becoming increasingly apparent to them
hat new ideas and practices might be helpful.
It is time our colleges stopped acting for a public
that doesn t exist, bowing to the voice of a minority
just because it is loud.
