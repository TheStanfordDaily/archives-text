# Encina Menus Fit Tastes No Diet Regimentation

### RICHARD DUDMAN HARRY PRESS 
Regimentation?
Are all Stanford's first-year men
regimented into having the same
menu for a given meal?
Far from it—Encina Commons al
lows much leeway in the daily menus
to fit individual tastes and needs.
One of the many special services
offered is permission for a table of
diners to carve its own meat. Such
an arrangement has often been made
when the eight men dislike having
their meat carved in the kitchen and
when one of their number will take
the trouble to learn to officiate with
the knife.
Eggs If You Like
Substitutions for certain parts of
the menu are always permitted. If
someone doesn't like the entree, he
can always get eggs. Or if he does
n't care for combination vegetable
salad, he can arrange to have hearts
of lettuce or fruit salad whenever
combination salad is 011 the menu.
If one of the frosh is ill in his
room, a note from the Men's Health
Service is all it takes to have his
meals sent up to the room—even if
he is on the fourth floor.
And, on 24 hours' notice, a sack
lunch will be prepared for picnick
ers, field trippers, and even Daily
desk workers.
Any Suggestions?
Long offered, but seldom utilized
by dissatisfied frosh, is the Thurs
day Night Menu Committee Bull
Session, which anyone can attend.
For the last three months, no stu
dent has "sat in" to make sugges
tions, air gripes.

Diet table, however, is much more
important than any of these other
services offered at the Commons.
What's more, Stanford is unique in
offering this service; no other col
lege dining hall in the country can
boast about doing anything for the
inevitable percentage of pyknics,
aesthenics, and diabetics.
Any diet will be served here if
approved by the Men's Health Serv
ice. Diets are provided for those
who wish to take off weight, add
weight, or for anything else needed.
At least one diabetic has been served
ever since 1931, when • the service
was inaugurated. The charge for
special diets is an additional $3 per
month.

by dissatisfied frosh, is the Thurs
day Night Menu Committee Bull
Session, which anyone can attend.
For the last three months, no stu
dent has "sat in" to make sugges
tions, air gripes.

Diet table, however, is much more
important than any of these other
services offered at the Commons.
What's more, Stanford is unique in
offering this service; no other col
lege dining hall in the country can
boast about doing anything for the
inevitable percentage of pyknics,
aesthenics, and diabetics.
Any diet will be served here if
approved by the Men's Health Serv
ice. Diets are provided for those
who wish to take off weight, add
weight, or for anything else needed.
At least one diabetic has been served
ever since 1931, when • the service
was inaugurated. The charge for
special diets is an additional $3 per
month.
