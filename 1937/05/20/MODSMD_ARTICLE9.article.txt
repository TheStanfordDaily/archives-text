### JOHN COBBS 
Resignation of Jus (ire Willis Van Devanter from the United States Su
preme Court will strengthen the opposition to the President's plan for
court reform, according to I)r. Arthur M. Cathcart, professor of law.
Foreseeing the appointment of a liberal successor to the retiring jus
tice, Dr. Cathcart explained yesterday, that this would remove much of

the New Deal pressure against "con
servatism." He believes that the
probable liheral realignment of the
court will make change undesirable
to many who have supported the
President's proposal for apponiting
more justices.
"Roosevelt," he said, "will look
for a successor to Van Devanter,
who will stand hitched. The retiring
jurist has been one of those least
friendly to the New Deal policies,
and it is only natural that the Presi
dent should choose a man favorable
to his program."
Dr. Cathcart does not believe that
the resignation came as a result of
attacks upon conservative and elder
ly justices. "Van Devanter," he
said, "has too much sense of respon
sibility to withdraw unless he felt
other reasons made it necessary."
He explained that the justice was
78 years old, and not in good health,
and pointed out that his resignation
has been expected for some time.
Van Devanter, according to Dr.
Cathcart, has been one of the four
strong men on the court. He is a
specialist in the jurisdiction of the
federal courts, and in problems in
volving water rights. An expert in
the question of states' police power,
he has been one of the four con
servative justices.
