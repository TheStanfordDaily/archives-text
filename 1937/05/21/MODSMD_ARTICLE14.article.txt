# U.S. Refuses Apology For Hitler Slur
## American Cardinal Calls Der Feuhrer "A Poor Austrian Paper Hanger" 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP). -
The state department probably will
not reply to informal representations
by the German Embassy against
George Cardinal Mundelein's criti
cism of Chancellor Adolf Hitler as
"an Austrian paper hanger, and a
poor one at that," Secretary Cordell
Hull said tonight.
The department's position was
made known after a series of swift,
behind-the-scenes maneuvers had
headed off international complica
tions similar to those caused by
Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia of
New York, two months ago, when
he suggested Hitler for a "chamber
of horrors" at the forthcoming New
York world's fair.
Chicago Speech
Cardinal Mundelein, himself of
German extraction, denounced Hitler
and the German government in a
speech before priests of the Chicago
Archdiocese Tuesday.
He accused the Reichsfuehrer and
his aids of persecuting the church
and of forcing the German people to
return to paganism. He said it would
be "cowardly" if some member of
the church did not make some an
swer.
Apology Asked
Mundelein's remarks evoked bit
ter attacks in the German press
which demanded the ecclesiastic re
cant or that the Vatican apologize for
him since Mundelein, as a prince of
the church, "naturally represents
the Holy See." Simultaneously, the
Reich communicated with its em
bassy here.
Embassy officials moved so
swiftly, and secretly, that the mat
ter had been adjusted, at least to
the State Department's satisfaction,
before reported receipt of new in
structions frorp Berlin advising Dr.
Dieckoff to make a more vigorous
protest.
