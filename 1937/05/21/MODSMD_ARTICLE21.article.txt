# Frosh Riot In Western Civ Library
## 
### 
'"Let's have it absolutely quiet for
15 minutes. At 9:30, by the clock
up front, anything goes! But don't
make another sound until then. Do
it right and it will be perfect." Last
night in the Western Civilization
Library freshmen bandied the above
notice from table to table.
At 9:25 smoke from burning shoe
laces was present, a few minutes
later in the best cheering section
manner skyrocket whistles rent the
air as a blonde left the room, sec
onds later a paper barrage was un
der way.
Sit-Down Strike
The librarian, whose previous
cautions and threats were called,
arose and demanded, "Turn in your
books." Then he went down and
turned out the lights to stimulate
the hesitant. Immediately a com
manding voice from the rear boom
ed out, "Keep your seats. Sit-down
strike! Who's afraid of the dark?
Sit-down strike!"
A loud crash and the sound of
falling glass were heard in the hall.
Casualty Record
Timid frosh fleeing into a quiet
room had swung open a door on ex
iting Eloise Lambert and forced her
arm through the glass partition.
Bleeding, but not seriously hurt,
Miss Lambert was rushed to the
hospital. Tlie would-be sit-down
strikers found themselves outside
the libe with the door securely
locked.
