# Wilbur Opposes Court Reform
## President Says Court Must Be Free 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president
of Stanford University and former
Secretary of the Interior, is op
posed to President Franklin D.
Rooseevlt's plan to "pack" the U. S.
Supreme Court, United Press re
ported last night.
"In a democracy such as ours the
courts must be kept as free from
political and other influence as is
possible," he said, "the protection of
the life and property of every citi
zen or person is within the province
of the court. Both legislation and
administration are often dominating,
unreasonable and unfair.
"Those who built up our form of
government realized the necessity of
keeping the Supreme Court untram
meled. The attempt to pre-judge the
decisions of the Supreme Court
through additional appointments is
an attack upon our form of govern
ment that must be sternly and per
sistently resisted."
"We can afford to be patient in the
evolution of social changcs. Experi
ence has shown that in the long run
our Supreme Court keeps up with
the advances of civilization," he de
clared.
