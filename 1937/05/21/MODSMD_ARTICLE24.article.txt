# Records At Stake Here Tomorrow In P. A. Trackfest
## 10,000 Meters, Hammer, 56-Ib. Weight Throw To Open Championships; Mile Record Threatened 
### WALT PETERSON 
Meet records right and left, and perhaps a world record or two in the
bargain, will be definitely endangered tomorrow afternoon when the an
nual Pacific Association A.A.U. meet, newly named the John Elliott Me
morial Track and Field Championships for the late dean of the sport, is
staged by the San Francisco 20-:s(> Club on Angell Field.

♦ For instance, Norman Bright holds
! the meet record for the mile at pres
ent, but with the aid of that Angell
Field surface and a little competi
tion from such boys as Bob Alex
| ander, Cecil Cole, Guadalupe Gon
-5 zales, and maybe even Fresno's stur
!dy Elroy Robinson, the ramblin'
redhead might crack that 4:17.3
j mark.
Blackmail's Record 47.9
A1 Blackman ran the 440 in 1935
- in 47.9 to set a meet record, too, but
; that doesn't look too safe with Ar-
I chie Williams, Ray Malott, Howard
LJpton, Jack Weiershauser, A1 Fitch,
land lesser lights all set to have at it.
Remember, some time ago Weier
shauser, Malott, and Fitch were very
closely bunched at the iinish of the
Stanford-Olympic Club quarter,
which Fitch won in 48.3. Both Ma
lott and Weiershauser have come a
long way since then as far as con
dition is concerned, and unless
somebody gets in somebody else's
way going around that turn — of
which there is only one, too—they
both will be mighty close to record
I time.
You can't tell about those low
| hurdles, either, for Jack Weier
' shauser certainly rates a chance to
i break the meet record of 23.5, held
by Dell Fishback, on his perform
ance at Edwards Field in the Big
1 Meet. Fishback is competing again
1 this year, and he doesn't take back
talk from anybody when it comes
jto low hurdling.
Lowell Todd To Compete
And then there's a husky lad from
San Jose State who might surprise
John Mottram in the javelin, Lowell
Todd s his name, by beating him out
and also setting a new meet record.
John holds it now at 214-5, but Todd
| threw 213-odd at the Drake Relays
earlier this year and there's no tell
| ing when he's going to get one of!
1 three or four feet better.
As for world records, there's a
definite chance that the hard-to
| reach 3:11.6 for the mile relay set by
j U.S.C. will be supeceded by the
Stanford team which ran 3:12.8 last
week at Fresno. With all due credit
to Jimmy Kneubuhl, who is now a
world record-holder in the 880 relay,
; Stanford can field perhaps a faster
team than the Fresno outfit by using
Carl Mahurin in the first lap in
! place of Jimmy. Mahurin is trained
Ito the distance, while Kneubuhl
proved he's a better sprinter than a
j quarter-miler by his showing in the
880 tandem test.
Watches for Prizes
Yes, you can figure that the meet
will be well worth watching. It will
be worth while for the athletes, too,
for the 20-30 Club is donating gold
wrist watches for first place, and
| silver and bronze medals for second
; and third places.
The 10,000 meters, annual half
hour grind that never shows up on
the coast elsewhere but in the
A.A.U. festivities, will start at 12:30.
for all those faithfuls who think
they can stay around until the jave
lin starts at 1:45. The mile is booked
for 2:00. Hammer throw and 56-1 "o.
weight will go on with the 10,000
' meters, in order to protect the crowd,
j no doubt.
Admission for everyone, students
: or otherwise, will be 55 cents.
