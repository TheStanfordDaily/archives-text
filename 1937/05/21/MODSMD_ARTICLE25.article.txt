# Glee Clubs to Revive Operettas Next Year
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Men's and Women's Glee Clubs
have put behind them a successful
1936-37 season and now are pointing
toward next year — with tentative
plans for sponsoring an operetta,
joining campus musical forces. Such
a production would revive a practice
which resulted in several successful
operettas during past years.
Raymond Kendall, completing his
first year as director of the Stanford
clubs, is the last in a series of fac
ulty directors one of the first of
whom was Warren D. Allen, who
served from the 1918 to 1932, lay
ing the groundwork for the present
organizations. Students directed for
several years from the time of the
clubs' organization early in the '90's.
New Name
Only this year has the Women's
Glee Club become known as such.
For many years its members sang
under the title of the Schubert Club,
becoming the Women's Choral two
years ago.
The clubs have to their credit a
number of outstanding performanc
es, one of these being given two
years ago when the men's group

sang here with the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, Alfred Hertz
conducting. On one occasion in 1927,
the Men's Glee Club appeared in a
joint concert with the University of
California Glee Club at the Fair
mont Hotel in San Francisco.
Joint Programs
Joint programs between the men's
and women's groups are an import
ant part of next year's plans. The
clubs will hold tryouts during fall
quarter registration week, with va
cancies for about 25 new members,
11 in the men's club and 14 in the
women's.
Helen Robertson has been elected
president of the women's club, with
Aiice Allen as business manager;
Delphine Joy, junior manager; Bar
bara Gray, sophomore manager; and
Elizabeth Meyer, librarian. A frosh
manager will be chosen next fall.
Helen Hirschfelder and Katherine
Waltz are retiring president and
business manager.
Charles Runner, former business
manager, has succeeded John Ellis
as president. New officers will be
installed at a joint picnic at Sears
ville May 28.
