# Steelworkers, 27,000 Strong, Choose Leaders
## LewiS Union in First Contest for Control Of Major Steel Concern 
### 
PITTSBURGH, May 20 (UP). —
Steelworkers, the grime and dust of
a day's work still clinging to their
clothes, paraded to polling places to
night as the biggest industrial elec
tion on record neared an end.
The 27,000 workers, employes of
the Jones & Laughlin Steel Corpo
ration, are deciding who they want
to represent them in collective bar
gaining.
Since early this morning the men
who work in the mills at the Pitts
burgh and Aliquippa, Pa., plants of
J. & L., the nation's fifth largest
producer of steel, have been voting
"yes" or "no" to the question:
Vote Question
"Do you want the Amalgamated
Association of Iron, Steel and Tin
Workers of North America through
the steel workers organizing com
mittee of the Committee for Indus
trial Organization to represent you
as the exclusive representative for
collective bargaining?"
Should the 5.W.0.C., year old un
ion of John L. Lewis' Committee for
Industrial Organization, win the
election, it will be the first time it
has won exclusive bargaining rights
in a major steel concern.
C.1.0. Sole Agent
The union's contracts with U. S.
Steel Corporation subsidiaries and
most of those with more than 100
smaller concerns provide that the
S.W.O.C. has the right to represent
only those workers who are mem
bers of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Iron, Steel & Tin Workers, a
C.1.0. affiliate.
Late today the majority of the
workers had cast their votes. Al
though special details of state police
were present at the polling places—
all on company property—there were
no disorders.
The task of counting the ballots
was to begin early tomorrow follow
ing close of the election shortly
after midnight.
