# Frosh Hear Talks On Honor System
## 
### 
Members of Men's Council dis
cussed the Honor Code with Encina
frosh last night as a final check-up
before the men are scattered to Hall
and Row.
Purpose of the bull sessions was
to make sure that all first-year men
have a complete understanding of
the code before they take finals and
break up the organization of Encina.
Men who eat in Dining Room 7 took
part in the discussions last night, and
the rest of the Hall will take part
next week.
According to Bill Quade, presi
dent of Men's Council, Honor Code
talks at the start of fall quarter re
sulted in the elimination of all major
cases including frosh. Last night's
discussions emphasized the fact
that violators are punished so that
others may enjoy the Code, and also
solved a number of individual
problems.
