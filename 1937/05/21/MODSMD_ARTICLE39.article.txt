# Director of Encina Commons to Retire
## 
### HARRY PRESS RICHARD DUDMAN 
Mrs. H. L. Watson, longtime di- |
rector of Encina Dining Hall, is leav- |
ing at the end of the quarter after .
serving Stanford's first year men for I
over a decade. She will move to j
Berkeley to keep house for her hus
band, who is manager of the Berke
ley Women's City Club.
Succeeding her will be Mrs. Doro
thy Bell, present head of the Oaks
Dining Hall and the Cellar.
New Director
The new director has been con- j
nected with the Stanford Union for |
over a year. Previously she had j
charge for several years of a dining
hall much like the Union Cellar, at
the University of Pennsylvania.
Flooded out of her subsequent com
mercial tearoom position by the 193*3
Ohio River deluee, Mrs. Bell moved
to California, lighting in her present
job.
In buying food for the Commons,
Mrs. Bell will be able to use the same
strategy practiced by Mrs. Watson,
because her husband is in charge of
all food served at the Sir Francis
Drake Hotel. She too will be able to
remind food salesmen that they are

Stepping up prices, making them
greater than those in San Francisco.
Emilia's 15tli Year
Built at an original cost of $291,-
899 —which included both building
and equipment—the Encina foodery
will this fall begin serving its 15th
year. It was built in 1922-23, and
was first opened for the school year
1923-24. This original cofet, paid by
the University, is being paid off at
the yearly rate of $5,000. In addition
to this, a freshman's quarterly $85
must also help pay the annual five
per cent interest charge of the Uni
versity on its investment.
