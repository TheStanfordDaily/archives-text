### 

LOOKING DOWN FROM THE BRIDGE of the S.S. Platonic arc (left to right) Shirley Jones, Jerry
Read, Jeanne Melton, and Frances Farmer who have leading roles in tonight's production of "Down the
Hatch." Owen Clark is taking the count after a knockdown registered by his co-star, Jerry Reed, during
a friendly little boxing match, in the lower left panel. At right 1 . Fred Clark stops another incipient fight,
pushes Larry Randall away.
