OKAY.
CHUCK
Through a bit of unprecedented
activity on the part of the business
staff yesterday there were so many
ads in the paper that the Campus
Opinion column was left out, and
thereby hangs a tale.
Slants made a crack —a series of
cracks, in fact—on the financial and
otherwise status of the Oregon State
polo team earlier this week, and
they caused repercussions. The
gentleman guest writer here from the
Oregon State Barometer, who also
happens to be a manager of the polo
team, gave me a sound lecture on
how I was all wet, and then he was
going t wo retiETAOINETAOINet
going to write a Campus Opinion
that would have come out in yes
terday's paper blasting me length
wise, crosswise, and all over.
Then I was supposed to come back
in this column today in abject reply,
or some such thing, in what would
be a mighty publicity buildup for
the polo game today, last of the
series.
The idea is entirely that of Mr.
Chuck Fries, the guest writer —inci-
dentally, he wrote that story on polo
yesterday but he didn't get a by
line—and a creditable idea it is, or
was, too. Not only has the Oregon
State polo team a manager, but it
has a publicity agent par excellence
in the bargain. Such things don't
happen very often.
However, even though the busi
ness staff crabbed the act by forcing
Campus Op out, there's 110 reason
why I shouldn't explain wherein I
was all wet about the Beaver polo
team. In the first place, the O.S.C.
polo team is not school or R.O.T.C.
supported, but is an independent
sport, run by a club or some such
thing, and is entirely self-support
ing. In other words, Oregon State
is not shelling out any stack of
stones, as reported.
In the second place, the reason
the team is spending so much money
this year is because there isn't going
to be any polo at the school next
year, so the boys are getting rid of
all their surplus this season. It
seems that the team uses the R. O.
T. C. horses to play up there, but
the government just isn't going to
co-operate any longer, and is going
to put motors in place of the nags
at the Beaver post to get the Re
serves where they want to go. Since
the poloists won't have any horses
next year, they won't play polo,
horses being essential to polo in a
way.
And that isn't all. Brother Fries,
and his compagnaro, Bob Alexander,
no relation to our Robert, didn't
like the statement I made to the
effect that Oregon State didn't have
a chance to win. Not wishing to hurt
their feelings, I retract that state
ment, but considering the score of
Wednesday's game, I can't help
thinking that perhaps I was right.

THEY'LL PLAY
ON RENTED lIOKSES
While speaking of polo, something
else worthy of mention is the im
pending game Saturday at Los An
geels between Stanford and Arizona
for the western collegiate champion
ship. The two teams are conceded
to be the best college teams in the
West, so they will play off for the
chance to go back East play the
eastern champion for the national
collegiate title. The plan puts polo
on a national scale, and is a signifi
cant move in atheltics.
The crowds that come out to see
the polo team play new are fair
enough, when you consider that
there are no bleachers, and the front
row capacity for cars is usually pret
ty well taken up. However, if the
Cards defeat Arizona to earn that
trip east the National Intercollegiate
Polo Association is handing out,
there ought to be lots more people
out to watch the horsemen play.
First thing you know they'll be
wanting bleachers at the polo field,
as well as at Angell Field.
ONE OF SEVERAL
BUTCHES
At the end of the track story in
yesterday's Daily there was supposed
to have been listed seven records
of the Pacific Association that have
been broken but never filed, but a
little of the old interdepartmental
stupidity that bawls up the machin
ery every once in a while was re
sponsible for that list being cut
short with only three records listed.
Those were Norman Blight's 1936
record of 4:17.3 in the mile, A1
Blackman's 1935 mark of 47.9 in the
440, and John Lyman's 1935 mark of
52-7% in the shot. The four that
weren't listed were 14.5 in the high
hurdles, set by Sam Klopstock in
1935; 13-9 in the pole vault, set by
Garret and Mauger in 1935, and
then boosted to 14-1 by George
Varofl last year; 214-5 in the jave
lin, set by John Mottram in 1935;
and 6-6Vk in high jump by Watson
of Sacramento J.C. in 1936.
Clark of the Olympic Club broad
jumped 24-10 in 1935, to tie the rec
ord set by Kim Dyer of Stanford in
1928, as another change in the record
book that hasn't been kept up-to
date since 1933.
