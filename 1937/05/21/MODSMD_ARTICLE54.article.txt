# Card, Beaver Poloists Close Series Today
## Indians Will Go South To Meet Arizonans For West Coast Title 
### 
Card horsemen start off a heavy
weekend today at 3 o'clock on the
highway polo field when they meet
the Oregon State squad in a return
match. After the game Captain
Grubbs and hi.s first .string men will
entrain for Los Angeles where they
will meet the University of Arizona
at 2:' JO on Uplifters Field Saturday.
The Arizona match will be for the
championship of the Western Di
vision of the National Intercollegi
ate Polo Association and the winner
will receive a trip east after school
is out at the expense of the associa
tion to meet such powerful eastern
teams as Cornell, West Point, Yale,
and Princeton.
Toss-up Saturday
Indian horsemen are conceded
about a fifty-fifty chance in Satur
day's match having met the Bobcats
three times this year, losing one 4-3,
winning one 5-4. and throwing an
other 4-1. Both teams are in tip-top
shape and will have no advantages
in mounts as they will be riding
neutral horses and will trade at the
half as usual.
The western division of the col
legiate polo association has just been
organized and will be a great boost
to college polo on the coast, afford
ing recognition, and national com
petition. U.S.C. is the only other
member on the coast as yet, but will
not enter in Saturday's meet, having
been defeated by both the Cards and
the Bobcats.
Six Cards Go
Card horsemen making the trip
south will be Leon Derby, Jim Ful
lerton, Bob Fullerton, Rummy Ras
mussen, Don McAusland, and Bert
McClintock.
The first four will compose the
starting lineup of today's game with
Oregon State, but the second string
will probably see plenty of action
because of tomorrow's match. Last
Wednesday in this present two
game series with the Beavers, the
Cards won 12-2.
