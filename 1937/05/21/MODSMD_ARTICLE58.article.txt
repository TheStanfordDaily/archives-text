# Debaters May Tour England Next Year
## 
### 
Proposals for a debate tour to England during next winter quarter,
sending the Debate Council budget up to $1400. is one of the most im
portant changes being considered for next year's A.S.S.U. budget.
Chuck Eontius, recently reappointed student manager, estimates that
the new budget will total around $10,000. Final draft of the budget will

be presented to Ex Committee at its
meeting next Tuesday night, "Fon
tius indicated yesterday.
"There won't be any radical cuts
in next year's budget," Fontius de
clared. "We can't tell yet what
minor changes will be made, but I
believe that the total budget this
year will be about the same as it
has been this."
Ed Kerr, new debate manager,
said yesterday that "we are asking
for an increase in our budget be
cause we think it would be justified
by the extensive program we have
planned."
Besides the trip to England, Kerr
also is considering tours to British
Columbia, the Rocky Mountain
states, and the Southern states. He

I is asking for an increase next year of
| $250 over the current appropriation
jof $1150. During the past year, Kerr
1 added, the cost of the tours has been
j met largely by the members of the
teams, with debaters on major tours
! spending an average of $100.
I Pointing to the value to Stanford
; from the two major tours to Ha
j waii and Central America in the
! past year, Kerr said that "debating
] is one of the most favorable means
for increasing the reputation of
j Stanford in this country and abroad."
Since Debate Coach Professor Lee
I Chapin will be on sabbatical leave
I studying in Scotland next year, and
! could arrange debates for the Stan-
I foM team, Kerr believes that "next
' year is the logical time for the trip."
