# Lights! Curtain!
## 
### 
THIRTY EIGHT years ago tonight in Stanford's
New Assembly Hall, most modern of thea
ters, the lights dimmed for the first time, voices
lulled and curtain swung. The show was on!
Then they came, good shows and bad, song
hits, actors in the making, directors and musi
cians, lights, tears, makeup, Gaieties and Spring
Shows, curtain calls, applause, success.
Tomorrow night this parade ends when the
Assembly Hall darkens after a last performance
of "Down the Hatch," most current of the march,
and reportedly not least though last.
But in a few months the parade takes a new
stage, again in the most modern of theaters.
A buzz in the orchestra pit, a figure at the
giant light console moves, the house darkens,
a new curtain swings, and again the Stanford
show goes on. —G. F.
