RIGHT under our noses, Lee Chapin and his
debate squad are probably doing more to
advertise Stanford to the world—and receiving
less credit for it—than any other campus ac
tivity, unless it's that old ogre athletics.
Two weeks from tomorrow the boys will step
up to a San Francisco microphone, cough a few
times, and utter words which will be heard by
all of America, Great Britain, and the countries
of Western Europe. Their opponents will an
swer them by transatlantic radio from Edin
burgh, Scotland.
This great hook-up, like the one with Cam
bridge two years ago, will broadcast "Stanford"
in something like 20 nations, establish this Uni
versity in millions of minds as one of the
world's greatest.
To Mr. Chapin goes the credit for arranging
this international contest. When he was ex
change professor at the University of Edin
burgh last year, he was made a member of the
150-year-old Dialectic Society, a famous debat
ing club which in 1792, incidentally, argued:
"Resolved, that Great Britain has gained by los
ing the American colonies."
One of the few Americans ever to join the
society, Mr. Chapin laid tentative plans for this
radio debate. He was enthusiastically received
and complimented for the Cambridge debate in
1935.
The junket to Central America taken last
month by Messrs. Reynolds and Hill was an
other aspect of the debate squad's "internation
alism." While not exactly debating, these men
brought immeasurable fame to Stanford in Mex
ico, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Then down in Hawaii, America's little empire
in the Pacific, Mr. Mallett and Miss Ford were
selling thousands more on Stanford.
Stanford's debaters — there's no getting
around it are among the University's greatest
salesmen. Maybe someone will hear them,
donate enough money to fix that street in front
of the New Theater.—D. B.
