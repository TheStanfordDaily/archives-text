# Science Tracks Down Track

### 
THE traditional stereotype of the academic
physics prof whose bespectacled research
is done in a dusty dungeon iab doesn't coin
cide at all with the picture of Stanford's asso
ciate professor of physics, Paul Kirkpatrick.
The high jump pits and javelin ranges of a
modern track plant are Kirkpatrick's Jabs, and
there he puts a physicist's tools to work on a
practical problem as contemporary as next
Saturday's track meet — inaccuracy .of track
records.
He shows that the painstaking accuracy of
measurement of a shot put, when the distance

is taken down to the eighth inch, is nothing
more than a gross example of what the precise
scientist calls "fictitious accuracy."
The shot put pit is supposed to be level,
though seldom is strictly that. An inch differ
ence in height of the landing spot with the
throwing circle may account for an inch differ
ence in length of throw, if the shot comes down
at the average 45-degree angle.
Thus it is highly inconsistent to measure shot
distances to the eighth-inch, v/hen a small dis
crepancy in the level of the pit may account
for nearly a full inch difference.
And Kirkpatrick can go through most all of
the field events to show similar inconsistencies
accruing not only from inaccurate measuring
but from geographical differences and effects of
earth rotation.
But this practical young physics prof is not
a debunker. He's a comoination of track en
thusiast and scientist with a desire to work out
a more accurate method for recording man's
track and field capabilities, not to discredit exist
ing records.
• Today he is working with A.A.U. officials
toward this end—an example of an educator
researching the impractical phases of a practi
cal problem. —G. F.
