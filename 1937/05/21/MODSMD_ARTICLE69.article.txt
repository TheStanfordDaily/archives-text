# OUR HASHER, Jr.

|"|NE night last week, reports began to trickle in and
drift about and around that the new theater was
blazing to high hell, and had been set afire by a
bunch of frosh who live in the neighborhood.
Investigation, however, soon bared the fact that
the janitor was burning up some rubbish together with
the leavings of the exterior construction. Thus calmed,
the campus turned to viewing one of the loveliest
sights it has seen, exclusive, of course, of the local
sunsets and the collectively beautiful coeducational
campus.
This excitement nearly parallels that of the yearly
burning of the haystacks in the East Library Acreage
and the South Encina Commons Blue Joint Field,
when upper-classmen fire (he stacks and freshmen pay
the bills through breakage fees.
This year, the incendiary fiends are waiting for a
good South Gale, so the sparks will blow over onto
what there isn't in the way of a Cubberlcy Bldg. If
the plan succeeds in toto and the lumber burns, the
library inmates, libra sancta, will receive a more than
adequate baking. Then there will be no books to study
and Stanford will have nothing io offer us but
syllabus fees.
Two psychology instructors arc proud possessors of
an antiquated Hudson which they drive to and fro
their classes. Much have they travelled in their car
of old. Each time one leans over in front of it to
stir the marvel out of inactivity he receives another
honorable scar on his forehead. That's where the ra
diator cap strikes hardest.
A ND who among you noticed the empty beer bottle
sitting enthroned in sunshine before the Library?
No one wanted to take it. Maybe Ex Committee just
passed a rule about the possession of empty beer
bottles on the campus too.
