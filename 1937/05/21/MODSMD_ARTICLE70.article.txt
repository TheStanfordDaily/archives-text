WE'RE A HATCHIN'
r pWO years ago Frank O'Neill and Mac Gordon got
tired of batting out minute scripts for Gaieties and
decided they would collaborate on a full-length feature
that would give full reign to their combined talents.
The spring show of tw<>" years ago was successful
but not good.
Last year "Three Sheets to the Wind" was pretty
good show and ran two nights in a row, thereby set
ting a precedent for long runs on the campus.
This year all shows have followed the example.
Good shows have filled the house two nights running.
It is a money making idea.
Stanford is hatching, but it hasn't hatched yet.
Always more or less of an incubator baby, Stanford
is about to make its debut into the open air. Dramatic
blood, lony sluggish in its action, has had new cor
puscles added to it and with gratifying results. We
have a new theater, a new director, new names, new
faces, a new era.

Back East the Harvard Hasty pudding show not
only runs several nights but also goes on tour. Dur
ing Christmas vacation the Princeton Triangle Club
show packs four or five ears full of equipment and goes
to Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, New Orleans, Pitts
burgh, and New York, and what's more, it makes
money.
"Down the Hatch," however, will run two nights for
a Stanford audience.

The football team takes trips and shows itself "(1
to good advantage, is a good advertisement for the
school. The track team wins 1.C.4A. after 1.C.4A.,
also advertises the school. Lawson Little won golf
championships; Stanford's name made headlines.

HPHE Spring Show this year can't take a trip, prin
cipally because it wasn't written with that end in
view. Right now it needs cutting, rehashing, more
time, more money, but maybe next year, with every
one pointing toward the fun it would be, campus au
thors, maestros, and actors could produce something
worthy of taking a jaunt to Seattle, Portland, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
Stanford has a good show this year. Given more
time, it could hit the rails, show nfF Stanford talent.
It has good songs, good dances, nice looking persons
who talk, walk, and act like educated gentlemen and
women. It has a good director and is well acted.
Harper is pretty good, too.
