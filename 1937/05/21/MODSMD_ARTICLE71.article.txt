# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Shortly after my arrival at Stan
ford University, 1 was tyld of the
Hall-Row split; being idealistic at the
time, it sounded like some dissatis
fied politician's backroom talk. And
this seemed all the more evident
when my first few applications for
extra-curricular jobs were readily
accepted.
But I now realize that these com
mittee appointments were possible
because nobody else offered to do
the dirly work; it makes no differ
ence whether a man is Hall or Row
when it comes to the working part of
the job. But the time has now come
when this worker would like to get
up to the top, and on some of the
Hall-Row split stands put like a sore
"gravy train" and immediately the
thumb; we must draw the line there,
and the Row draws their line.
No more flagrant abuse of this
power is evident than this morning's
announcement of senior honorary
fraternity appointments. If the Row
wants athletes in that group of illus
trious seniors, the Hall can equal
any of those appointed; if the Row
.wants dirty politicians, the Hall can
at least come close to the number on
the Row. Surely a candidate for
Student Body President, two men on
the executive committee, the head
yell leader, two Cardinal men, out
standing athletes in every sport
surely all these men in the Halls
cannot justly be denied recognition
by a senior class of their services to
the class and the school.
It would be very enlightening to
learn how these appointments were
made, and what qualifications were
required that made Row men so su
perior to the Hall men.
