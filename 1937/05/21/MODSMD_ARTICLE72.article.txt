# SLANTED WRONG

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's "Sideline Slants," j
mention was made of the Oregon
State polo squad. Some of the state- |
ments that the writer of this column
made were untrue.
In the first place, "Oregon State '
did not shell out quite a stack of
stones for this trip." Polo at our i
college does not receive any finan- j
cial support from the college either
through the intercollegiate athletics !
department or the department of j
physical education. The school did
not contribute one cent to the ex- i
pense of this trip.
Mention was also made that there |
was "a fortunate series of circum- j
stances . . . involving the motori- j
zation of the R.0.T.C." This series !
of circumstances was supposed to j
provide "the wherewithal for this j
little junket." This statement is j
doubly false.
Members of the polo squad at ]
O.S.C. regard the motorization of the 1
R.O.T.C. as unfortunate because it
means that there will be no more ,
horses for the polo team. As horses 1
are somewhat essential in the game, :
we will be forced to discontinue polo.
Secondly, the polo team did not j
get money from the R.O.T.C. Polo
funds come from receipts of admis- j
sion charged for our polo games, |
which are held in an indoor arena, j
As there is no more polo at 0.5.C., j
we have no more need for the re- j
maining funds in our treasury and

therefore we have spent the money
on a trip as the final act of the polo
squad.
