### 
"Dead End" (Curran Theater).
Run, do not walk, to the nearest
telephone and reserve tickets to this
amazing play, it wiii pick you up,
slam you around, and leave you beg
ging for more. It will knock all the
smug complacency most of us have
about being '"born to be good" out
of you, and fill your philosophy of
society as full of holes as they filled
"Babyface" Martin.
The curtain rises on the dead end
of a dirty tenement street, with its
back against' the slimy East River
and its flank to a high-class apart
ment house. It isn't a stage repre
sentation of a street, it is a street,
and you're right at the end of it,
amidst the action. Norman Bel
Geddes' job of setting this play was
as important, if not more so, as was
Sidney Kingsley's job of writing it.
Throughout everything you feel it
beating its imprint into the charac
ters until they become like their en
vironment, sordid and twisted.
Kingsley does not hammer in his
theme, but rather lets you watch his
figures and sec what he means. The
five street-brats who lead the action
will be unforgettable; Kingsley has
lifted them and their jargon from
the streets he portrays, and here
they arc. The rest of the cast makes
most of the high points of their ac
tion come through remarkably fine
restraint. Antoinette Rochete as
"Mrs. Martin" plays a small sccne
in a manner which will long stay
with you, expressing all the hate of a
mother betrayed without once rais
ing her voice. But they are all good,
and many, very good.
This is a play to see. Don't go
expecting ringing lines or smooth
plot construction. Just go, and the
brats and the set will take care of
the rest.
