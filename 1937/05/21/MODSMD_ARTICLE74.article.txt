# English Customs Trouble Tourists
## 
### 
"What Americans planning to
travel in England need to know is
how to get along without infuriating
the native;;," said Professor Philip
W. Buck last night in his travel lec
ture on England.
The first thing to remember is
that the English speak a foreign
language. When the tourist asks
for a round-trip ticket or for hi.s
trunk, he won't be understood. Eng
lishmen aren't familiar with those
terms. Next thing to get straight is
England's complicated money sys
tem. Besides the un-deeimal regu
lar currency, Ihey deal with several
mythical moneys. "But." Dr. Buck
said, "complicated as their money
mav be, have some of it before you
land."
The tourists will also have trouble
with trains, servants, and hotels.
Dr. Buck recommends hotels in the
Bloomsbury section of London for
the person looking for clean, com
fortable, cheap lodgings. For coun
try lodgings, the tourist should ask
at the post-office or at the local pub.
He will be readily accommodated.
Next Tuesday at 7:30 in the Liltle
Theater, Captain George Clements,
Arctic explorer, will give a lecture
accompanied by a motion picture,
tilled "On Top of the World." The
picture will cover 12,000 miles of
territory from Seattle, through
Alaska, within 300 miles of the North
Pole, to Siberia. Tne picture is
eight reels long. ,
