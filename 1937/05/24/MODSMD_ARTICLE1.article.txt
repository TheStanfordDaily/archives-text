Debate 011 League
In celebration of its 150 th anni

Edinburgh University, whose hon
orary president is Hugh Walpole,
will meet Stanford on the question,
'"Resolved: that the English-speak
ing nations of the world should
form a new league."
As the negative side, the Cardi
nals will show that "the tacit under
standing which exists at present is
better both as regards prospects of
world peace in general and amicable
roiations between Britain and the
United States in particular," said
Bob Hartmann.
Chapin Arranges Tilt
Their opponents will be James W.
Watson, president of the Associated
Societies of Edinburgh University,
a position corresponding to student
body president; and J. C. Mackenzie,
honorary secretary of the Dialectic
Society.
The general foundation of the
debates was laid during Professor
Chapin's trip to Edinburgh last year,
where he was initiated as the sec
ond American to be elected to mem
bership by the society.
