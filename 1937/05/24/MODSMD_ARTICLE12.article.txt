Two Indian hoopsters, Dinty
Moore and Hank Luisetti, recently
won more honors to add to their
long list of awards.
At an informal bull session held
at "Genial John" Bunn's home last
night, the incomparable Hank was
named captain of next year's edi
tion of the Crimson hoop team. This
supplement his record of all j Coast
forward for two years, plus high
conference scorer for both years,
plus record holder for high score for
one year of conference games. And
Cap'n Dinty did right well too.
This time it's the medal of the
Gimbel Mental Attitude Prize, an
nually awarded to the senior stu

attitude toward athletics during at
tendance at Stanford.
Dinty's amazing record includes
being captain of the Indian hoop
sters for two successive years, as
well as being chosen All-Coast guard
during his sophomore and senior
years. In his first year, he was also
the only guard to be listed among
the first ten scorers, while during his
final year of competition he was
chosen for the All-Coast team with
but one coach dissenting.
