# Rockefeller, U.S. Croesus, Dies at 97
## Ambition To Reach 100 Not Realized; Senses Unimpaired by Age 
### 
ORMOND BEACH, Flu., May 23
(U.R).—John D. Rockefeller, Sr., who
earned more money than any man
who ever lived, died today at the
age of 97.
His wealth had purchased for him
comfort, luxuries, power and the es
teem of his fellow men, but it could
not buy fulfillment of the only am
bition he had left—to- live to be 100.
Dies at 4:05 a.m.
Death came at 4:05 a.m. on the day
that Rockefeller always set aside to
worship the things of the spirit and
to forget the world and all that's
in it.
It was a peaceful, painless death.
Rockefeller went into a coma
shortly after midnight and never
emerged from it. Physicians said
he died from sclerotic myocarditis,
which means, in the everyday lan
guage that Rockefeller himself
spoke, that a tired heart gave up.
In Good Health
Until last week it appeared that
Rockefeller's ambition to have a
100 th birthday party would be real
ized. Physicians said he was "in the
best physical condition" in several
years. His faculties were hardly im
paired by age; his hearing was acute;
he had retained most of his teeth;
and he had a lively interest in the
world around him.
Years ago Rockefeller retired from
business, weary of earning money
that rolled into his vaults faster than
he could spend it. He had rivaled the
Harrimans and the Goulds in the
railroad business; he had bought into
steel until he threatened the primacy
of Andrew Carnegie; he had in
vested in public utilities, real estate,
street railways, ferries and ocean
lines. His trucks were on the main
streets of every cross-road town in
the United States; his oil caravans
plodded the Arabian deserts; his
tankers fed oil to South America; his
oil barrels rolled into doorways in
China and along jungle trails in
Africa.
Shiny Dimes
And everything he touched turned
to gold.
So he turned away from the accu
mulation of money and began to
give it away. Finally, that, too, be
came too arduous a task—manage
ment of 750,000,000 in philanthropies
is a full-time job for hundreds of
persons. So he passed the work
along to younger hands and became
what he was when he died — a
wrinkled old man in dark glasses
who gave away shiny dimes, and
loved hymns and sentimental poetry.
