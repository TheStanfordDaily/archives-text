# Art--—But NOT For Art's Sake
## 
### 
Not art for art's sake, but art for I
the sake of fine living—that's what
summer-quarter students will be
exposed to if they take Instructor
William Irvine's novel new course
in "Art Appreciation.''
A week-end trip to Hollywood's
biggest studios to see movies in the
\ making, intimate evenings in the
j homes of famous Bay Region art
i lovers, personal talks with famous
American architects — these are the
| "labs" Mr. Irvine hopes will make
i his students really "feel" the place
j of art in their everyday lives.
More lo Life
"Life should be more than a busi
' uesi of eating, drinking, and sleep
ing" is this cultured young man's
j opinion. "It can be enhanced im
measurably by art and the ability to
appreciate it."
For the first time since "Art Ap
-1 pieciation" has been taught at Stan
ford, the motion picture will not be
overlooked. Two Farm graduates
now high in the film world—Delmer
Daves and Waldemar Young, out
standing Hollywood scenarists—will
make special trips here to speak to
Mr Irvine's class on the artistic
i qualities of the cinema.
Background of the motion picture
will be covered by Mr. Daniel Men
dclowitz, graphic art instructor,

when the "Art Appreciation" class
listens in on the first two weeks of
his regular course on the films.
While Ihe party is in Southern
California visiting 20th Century

] Fox and other picture studios, it
I will spend a day at the great Hunt
j ington Library in Pasadena, which
| displays one of the world's most
| vsluable collections of fine books
I and paintings.
Many trips are planned up the
' peninsula and across the Bay to the
| beautiful homes and estates of peo
ple who have, according to Mr. Ir
vine, "made art an important part of
their lives." Especially enlightening
will be an evening in San Francisco
with Mr. John Francis Neylan and
i his library of fine books.
Architects To Speak
Frank Lloyd Wright, who is cur
rently building the unique campus
j home of Professor Richard Hanna,
Sand Richard Neutra—both eminent
j architects of the new modernistic,
i functional school — will probably
speak to the class.
When it comes to Oriental rugs,
i the class will be able to view one of
the world's finest collections right
here in the Stanford home of Pro
fessor Karl Brand.
The whole theory back of the
| course is this —to make art really
live to his students, Mr. Irvine
I wants to make it as little academic
ins possible. "Art and its applica
tion in modern living" is how he
I will attempt to present it.
