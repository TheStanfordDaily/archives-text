# F.R. To Submit New Labor Bill
## Wages, Hours Measure Will Go To Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 (UP). -
Senate Majority Leader Joe T. Rob
inson said tonight after a White
House conference that President
Roosevelt would Submit a general
message on wages and hours to
Congress tomorrow and that a bill
embodying his objectives would be
introduced immediately in both
houses.
Robinson, after a two-hour con
ference with the chief executive and
Senator Hugo L. Black, D. Ala.,
chairman of the Senate Labor Com
mittee, said the bill would be turned
over to committees in both cham
bers for quick action.
He predicted rapid consideration
of the proposed measure which will
supplant the labor features of the
outlawed NRA. He said the bill
would be put into final form as rap
idly as possible.
The measure was drawn up by
Black and Representative William
Connery, D.. Mass., chairman of the
House Labor Committee, after
lengthy conferences between gov
ernment, business, and labor lead
ers. It is understood to have the
general backing of the labor unions.
Tentatively, the bill will include
a maximum work-week of between
35 and 40 hours, depending upon the
industry, and a minimum wage of 40
cents an hourâ€”giving all workers a
flat minimum weekly earning of $16.
It will apply to all strictly inter
state industries, thus excluding such
enterprises as the service trades,
hotel business, and other purely in
trastate affairs.
