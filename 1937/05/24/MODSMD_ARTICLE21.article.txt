# Ten Records Broken In Elliott Meet
## Dean Runs 9.6 Century; Weiershauser, Mallott Star on Angell Field 
### PHIL KLAUBER 
As fine a set of all around marks
that may result in any track meet
this year was the result Saturday
afternoon on Angell Field in the new
John Elliott Championships, reno
vated offspring of.the old P.A. meet.
Nn less than 10 meet records
were broken as all those present
seemed to sense the rare opportu
nity for outdoing themselves — a
chance to compete on the rarely
used Angell Field track.
It was a regular sprint carnival,
with records broken in all the short
races: Ray Dean, former Stanford
dash man, reached his first 9.6 in
the hundred to beat out Tommy Nel
son, sensational Pasadena J. C. and
Fresno State negro, by inches; Jack
Weiershauser entered the ranks of
the Stanford sprinting great by
running the 220 in 20.9, fastest time
around here since Hec Dyer's days,
and Ray Malott ran 47.7 to win the
quarter—a new personal record for
him and under A1 Blackman's 47.9
meet record set two years ago.
McCurdy Pushes Malott
Malott was pushed to the limit in
his race by Captain Bill McCurdy of
Stanford, and won by about a hand;
Weiershauser, who had coasted in
with Archie Williams of Cal in a 21.4
trial heat, won handily as the Olym
pic star dropped out at the half-way
point. ,
The mile was the classic that all
locals have been waiting
Cecil Coluiiii«+ty defeating Bob
a foot after as sterling a J
stretch nTJluli as IUK Ijyun .seen heu\
The time was 4:16.1, another meet
and national J. C. record.
The 10,000-meter run was taken
Saturday by Ted Vollmer, chunky
California freshman, who outlasted
a fine field of 15 entrants and fin
ished strong in 33:44.7, another meet
record. But five of the original
starters finished.
Reynolds in Sweet Win
Jim Reynolds gained sweet victory
by dumping his old rivals, Dunn and
Allee of the Olympic Club in the
shot put. Reynolds threw 52-7 ,v s for
a half inch better than Johnny Ly
man's meet record, and by a half
foot the prexy's best ever. The
weather seemed to please him, as
one of his tosses dusted the 53-foot
mark, but, anxious to watch it land,
Jim turned his head and stepped
foul.
Another compliment was paid
Sam McDonald's athletic plant when
Jack Mauger of the Olympic Club
and Cornelius Warmerdam of Fresno
broke the meet and their personal
records in the pole vault when they
tied at 14-4.
This week Dink Templeton will
pour it to his trackmen, as their
biggest encounter of the year—the
Pacific Coast Conference meet — is
set for Los Angeles Coliseum this
Saturday. Entries from each school
are limited to 15 men.
