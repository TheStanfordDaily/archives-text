# Two Haystack Fires Deplete Frosh Refunds
## Comptroller Threatens Offenders with Court Prosecution for Arson 
### 
Two haystack fires burned Friday
night as Encina and Toyon inhab
itants leaned out their windows and
watched i'rosh breakage fund re
funds diminish. "Smitty" Smith, dor
mitory nightwatchman, turned in the
fivst alarm at 8:45, and the fire de
partment left the fire, still in coals,
25 minutes later.
The other fire, about an hour later,
occasioned less interest on the part
of the- upperclassmen, long inured to
such excitement.
Makes Statement
Meanwhile, the following declara
tion of the University's policy was
released by Acting Comptroller J.
Hugh Jackson:
May 22
One of the principal responsibili
ties of the University is to protect
its own property as well as the
sources of its income. Off and on
over a period of years, we have suf
fered losses because of arson, largely
the result of thoughtlessness on the
part of students in the burning of
haystacks. This, however, is not
or.ly destructive of University prop
erty, but there is also always a risk
that we may have such a disastrous
grass fire as that which a few years
ago destroyed a large portion of the
westerly addition of the city of Ber
keley. Last year, for example, some
nir.e fires started simultanueously
on different parts of the campus,
and only this past Friday night two
such fires occurred near the dormi
tories.
Assumes Responsibility
As acting comptroller, I have the
n • ponsibility of dealing with this
problem. It will be my endeavor to
follow the general plans that have
been used by Mr. Roth in the past,
which means that the following
steps will be taken: x
(a) A sufficient number of watch
men will be employed to endeavor
to apprehend anyone who wilfully
sets fire anywhere on the Stanford
campus. Anyone so apprehended
will be turned over to the civil au
thorities for punishment in accord
ance with the statutes relating to
arson, and the cost of the property
destroyed, together with the cost of
the additional watchmen's services,
will be assessed against such indi
vidual.
To Recommend Expulsion
(b) Because of the seriousness of
this situation, any student who wil
-1 ully sets fire, destroys fire protec
tion equipment, or turns in false
alarms will be recommended to the
President of the University for ex
pulsion.

The experience of this office has
been that Stanford students are glad
to respond and co-operate with the
University in eliminating any dan
gerous or objectionable practice,
when its bad features are brought to
their attention, and it is sincerely
hoped that we will have the fullest
co-operation of the Student Body in
j meeting this serious px-oblem.
