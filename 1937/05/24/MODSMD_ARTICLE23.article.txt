THINGS HAPPENED IN THE 40 YEARS that elapsed between
the taking of the picture at left of John D. Rockefeller, who died yes
terday and the one at the right. In 1872 United States was starting its
great period of industrial development and the Standard Oil Company
was in its infancy. When the second was taken Rockefeller was 72,
and ready to retire from a corporation that had grown too large and
had been split up in Teddy Roosevelt's "trust-busting era."
