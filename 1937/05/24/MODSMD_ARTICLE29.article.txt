## Declares Reform Would Make U.S. Fascist

NEW HAVEN. Conn., May 23
(UP). â€”William Lyon Phelps, in a
radio talk prepared for delivery to
night, said that Americans will have
no right to criticize Italians, Ger
mans and Russians for "surrender
ing all their liberties to one dicta
tor" if we permit the President's
Supreme Court reform to be passed.
He said approval of Mr. Roose
velt's court proposal would signify
that Americans had "sold our
birthright, betrayed our heritage
and lost our independence" with
"less reason" than the Europeans
when they embraced dictatorship.
Phelps quoted numerous remarks
by American political figures as
showing that the pending measure
should not become law.
"I have enough confidence in the
Senate of the United States to be
lieve that it will resist absolutely
this usurpation of power by the ex
ecutive," Phelps said. "For this pro
posed plan amounts to a complete
overthrow of the constitutional form
of government in America, under
which our country has remained
free and powerful."
The Supreme Court, he said, is
"the great bulwark of the liberty of
individual citizens," and "the bul
wark of the liberty of the press." He
predicted that if the independence
of the Supreme Court is destroyed,
one of the "first casualties" will be
the freedom of the press.
