ON WEIERSHAUSER
WHEN the season started Jack
Weiershauser was Dink Templeton's
main hope in the 440, and while he
was supposed to be a pretty fair
quarter-miler, he wasn't figured to
be too much of a much. Now that
isn't meant to make Jack look like
a punk who came from nowhere,
because he has lots of hard work
and a sturdy reputation behind him,
but he didn't rate terrifically high
because there were others on the
Coast who were supposed to be bet
ter.
SINCE the start of the season,
though, Dink has found another
quartei-miler or two, and now Jack
has shifted from the 440 as his forte
(no pun intended) to the low hur
dles and the sprints. While he ran
a few times at the 220 lows last year,
ho wasn't a stellar attraction and
that wasn't what Dink was hoping
for so much this year.
BUT here Jack is in his last year,
bavin;; achieved a wonderful con
dition and running the best he ever
has in his life. And his best is just
about as good as you'll find any place
in this country.
THAT's no extreme statement,
either. Consider his ability at the
220 lows and then see if you can
name another runner in the country
who has any better right to the title
of "best." Since he has defeated
the Trojan sprinters twice in a row
in the 220 flat race, and then has
pasted up that 20.9 race in what
was virtually a dead calm Saturday
in the P.A. meet, you must begin to
fool that he is one of the best in
the country at that race, too.
EULACE Peacock, Bobby Pack
aid of Georgia. Marty Glickman, and
Bon Johnson all carry lots of weight
in the sports world as sprinters, but
the way Weiershauser has devel
oped in the last month has made me
a believer in his ability to beat at
least two of those in a 220. Peacock
is the only man who ever beat
Owens when Owens was at his peak,
and it is pretty hard to concede
Weiershauser a place over him. Just
what will be the outcome of such a
race we shall see with the N.C.A.A.
in Berkeley June 18 and 19, for then
the two will meet.
PEACOCK, of course, is a logic
ally cold favorite for the 100, but
he's going to know he's running a
race when he meets Weiershauser in
the 220. He will have to be at least
two yards ahead at 200 yards out,
too, or he'll come in second.
JACK hasn't defeated Ray Malott
in a 440 this year, but by virtue of
his very close second in the Big
Meet, and the remarkable relay
times he has turned in since, it must
be agreed that he is just about even
with Ray. That too is a boost for
him, as well as for Malott, for isn't
Hay still just as tough a 440 man as
the ( Ms! has to offer? Loren Bonke
of Washington State is very good,
and whether he can take Ray should
be the makings of a pretty fine ar
gument in the Conference Meet Sat
urday.
AT am rate, Weiershauser would
bo awfully close to both of them if
that was ail he had to run, so that
make. l , him pretty smart apples.
YES, if there ever was a driving,
relentless, dynamic runner it is
Weiershauser, and from the contacts
1 have had with him I'm willing to
back him to the limit in any com
pany. —Peterson

who has any better right to the title
of "best." Since he has defeated
the Trojan sprinters twice in a row
in the 220 flat race, and then has
pasted up that 20.9 race in what
was virtually a dead calm Saturday
in the P.A. meet, you must begin to
fool that he is one of the best in
the country at that race, too.
EULACE Peacock, Bobby Pack
aid of Georgia. Marty Glickman, and
Bon Johnson all carry lots of weight
in the sports world as sprinters, but
the way Weiershauser has devel
oped in the last month has made me
a believer in his ability to beat at
least two of those in a 220. Peacock
is the only man who ever beat
Owens when Owens was at his peak,
and it is pretty hard to concede
Weiershauser a place over him. Just
what will be the outcome of such a
race we shall see with the N.C.A.A.
in Berkeley June 18 and 19, for then
the two will meet.
PEACOCK, of course, is a logic
ally cold favorite for the 100, but
he's going to know he's running a
race when he meets Weiershauser in
the 220. He will have to be at least
two yards ahead at 200 yards out,
too, or he'll come in second.
JACK hasn't defeated Ray Malott
in a 440 this year, but by virtue of
his very close second in the Big
Meet, and the remarkable relay
times he has turned in since, it must
be agreed that he is just about even
with Ray. That too is a boost for
him, as well as for Malott, for isn't
Hay still just as tough a 440 man as
the ( Ms! has to offer? Loren Bonke
of Washington State is very good,
and whether he can take Ray should
be the makings of a pretty fine ar
gument in the Conference Meet Sat
urday.
AT am rate, Weiershauser would
bo awfully close to both of them if
that was ail he had to run, so that
make. l , him pretty smart apples.
YES, if there ever was a driving,
relentless, dynamic runner it is
Weiershauser, and from the contacts
1 have had with him I'm willing to
back him to the limit in any com
pany. —Peterson

ON WEIERSHAUSER
WHEN the season started Jack
Weiershauser was Dink Templeton's
main hope in the 440, and while he
was supposed to be a pretty fair
quarter-miler, he wasn't figured to
be too much of a much. Now that
isn't meant to make Jack look like
a punk who came from nowhere,
because he has lots of hard work
and a sturdy reputation behind him,
but he didn't rate terrifically high
because there were others on the
Coast who were supposed to be bet
ter.
SINCE the start of the season,
though, Dink has found another
quartei-miler or two, and now Jack
has shifted from the 440 as his forte
(no pun intended) to the low hur
dles and the sprints. While he ran
a few times at the 220 lows last year,
ho wasn't a stellar attraction and
that wasn't what Dink was hoping
for so much this year.
BUT here Jack is in his last year,
bavin;; achieved a wonderful con
dition and running the best he ever
has in his life. And his best is just
about as good as you'll find any place
in this country.
THAT's no extreme statement,
either. Consider his ability at the
220 lows and then see if you can
name another runner in the country
who has any better right to the title
of "best." Since he has defeated
