# Tradition Makes Coutts Stanford 'Mystery Man'
## Tales about French Exile Puzzling to Students 
### JOHN RICE HUNTER HENDEE 
(At the risk of wrecking Stan- j
ford's best legend, the Daily has
sent reporters Hunter Hendee and j
John Rice to read and hear all j
about the Frenchman, Peter |
Coutts. The results of their in

Who was the Frenchman? And
what was his story?
Is he truly the skeleton in the
Farm closet, or was he just a peace
loving dairyman, "eccentric" but
harmless, made notorious by circum
stance and the whims of coliegiate
romancedicts?
Tradition of Mystery
Those are questions puzzling to
Stanfordites since 1892. Each under
graduate generation blossoms forth
with new answers as regularly as its
annual epidemic of measles.
For years campus newcomers have
been fascinated by tales of "that ec
centric old Frenchman," Peter
Coutts — a tradition as deep-rooted
in Stanford hills as the giant live
oaks. By junior year newcomers are
authorities on Coutts' history; and
war, fraud, piracy, even murder
color their rumoric accounts.
Came from Paris
First big mystery surrounding this
most mysterious man is why he, his
family, and his fabulous wealth left
cosmopolitan Paris for the rustic
wilderness of this then hidden val
ley.
Because Peter Coutts, assumed
name of Monsieur Paulin Caperon,
chose never to discuss his former
life, theories as to why he came be
ban circulating almost as soon as his
residence here became known.
Theories Enumerated
And theories kept coming year
after year — like freshmen — almost
as numerous, almost as varied. Fol
lowing are those most generally
sworn to by those "who know." Of
them the real reason may or may
not be one:
That Peter Coutts fled France
after—
1. . . . antagonizing Napoleon 111
by opposing France's entry into the
Franco-Prussian War.
2. . . . murdering a member of
the nobility.
3. . . . disappearing from his of
fice as Pay-Master General in the
French army, leaving behind a
$5,000,000 shortage.
4. . . . selling war equipment to
the Germans.
5. . . , filling government muni
tions contracts with unexplodable
explosives.
0. . . . refusing to pay off depos
itors after the bank of which he was
director failed.

7.. . . absconding with money
deposited in his brother's Strass
burg bank and refusing to pay war
tax on that money.
Most probable is reason number
one:
Opposed Napoleon 111
M. Paulin Caperon was a wealthy
pacifist active in Parisian public af
fairs. As publisher of "La Liberie,"
still a leading financial journal, he
advocated peace with Prussia.
Whether he was actually exiled for
publcizing his sentiments against
Napoleon 111 or whether he merely
deemed it wise to flee is uncertain.
Known it is, however, that he with
other ardent pacifists including Vic
tor Hugo fled to Switzerland in 1871.
There he borrowed the name of his
English cousin, Peter Coutts, and
used that relative's identification pa
pers to get him and his family to
America.
Visited Valley
In the late 1830's Cameron visited
San Francisco while on a trading
voyage. At this time he hunted up
the Santa Clara valley, which he
thought was the most beautiful he
had ever seen and California the
"coming country of the world."
Undoubtedly this explains his
choosing Stanfordland for his place
of exile.

M. Paulin Caperon was a wealthy
pacifist active in Parisian public af
fairs. As publisher of "La Liberie,"
still a leading financial journal, he
advocated peace with Prussia.
Whether he was actually exiled for
publcizing his sentiments against
Napoleon 111 or whether he merely
deemed it wise to flee is uncertain.
Known it is, however, that he with
other ardent pacifists including Vic
tor Hugo fled to Switzerland in 1871.
There he borrowed the name of his
English cousin, Peter Coutts, and
used that relative's identification pa
pers to get him and his family to

San Francisco while on a trading

Who was the Frenchman? And

Tradition of Mystery
Those are questions puzzling to
Stanfordites since 1892. Each under
graduate generation blossoms forth
with new answers as regularly as its
annual epidemic of measles.
For years campus newcomers have
been fascinated by tales of "that ec

Coutts — a tradition as deep-rooted
in Stanford hills as the giant live
oaks. By junior year newcomers are
authorities on Coutts' history; and
war, fraud, piracy, even murder
color their rumoric accounts.
Came from Paris
First big mystery surrounding this
most mysterious man is why he, his
family, and his fabulous wealth left
cosmopolitan Paris for the rustic
wilderness of this then hidden val

name of Monsieur Paulin Caperon,
chose never to discuss his former
life, theories as to why he came be
ban circulating almost as soon as his

Theories Enumerated
And theories kept coming year
after year — like freshmen — almost
as numerous, almost as varied. Fol
lowing are those most generally
sworn to by those "who know." Of
them the real reason may or may
not be one:
That Peter Coutts fled France
after—
1. . . . antagonizing Napoleon 111
by opposing France's entry into the
Franco-Prussian War.
2. . . . murdering a member of

3. . . . disappearing from his of
