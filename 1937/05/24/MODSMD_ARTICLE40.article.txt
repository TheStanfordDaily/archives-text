## Teams Will Be Selected Today for Saturday's 'Spring Game' Tussle 
### john shallenberger 
Jimmy Coffis, cagey little Card
halfback and safety man, was named
"most valuable member ol the Stan
ford football team during the 1936
season"' at the annual gridders' ban
quet given by Jimmy McAllister,
prominent alumnus, at (he Family
Farm near Searsville Lake Friday
night. Coffis received a scholarship
for his "punch-injecting" spirit as
"spark plug" of the team.
The banquet followed the hardest
scrimmage of the spring season. With
the spring game only a week away,
the zest, of competition prevailed for
the first time.
Paulman Puts 'Em Out
Bill Paulman, who does his best
work under pressure, was again
making kicks on a par with those
that made him famous before he
broke his ankle early la.-t fall.
Peter Fay, who has stood out in
backfield in nearly every scrimmage
this quarter, put on one of the fin
est ball-carrying exhibitions side
liners can hope to see.
Jim Groves, fullback transfer who
has practically cinched himself a
reguiai spot, showed considerable
improvement in his only weakness,
hitting the line.
Linemen Improve
Although the offense was a little
ragged because of rodent changes in
some of the plays, linemen showed
real defensive skill. Stan Andersen
has improved greatly at tackle after
a recent ietdown.
Andy Stojkovich, who has gone
down in the books as a "waiting
end," surprised onlookers with a
smashing defense.
Tony Calvelli, whose speed and
backfield experience give him the
edge over Louis Tsoutsouvas as a
defensive center, gave a fine dem

onstration of line-backing tactics.
First on this afternoon's program
will be organization of teams for
the spring game, which is scheduled
for Saturday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock.
At Harvard's tercentenary a cen
tury slipped by as the college flag,
sealed at the close of the 200 th an
niversary, was raised, broke out in
the fresh 1936 breeze.
