Life Begins for the Doctor
WHAT'S wrong with the professors is that
they go to bed too early. What's right
with the Nitery is that it keeps the professors
awake.
For this morning, providing Dr. William Web
ster Hansen has an eight o'clock physics class,
he will wake up feeling just a little bit like the
students he teaches.
Niteryites whose Love Bug Was Biten Em
shortly after 12 p.m. Friday, on a 25-watt output
auditorium-type speaker, are still laughing.
At that time Dr. William Webster Hansen
arose from his couch in the Old Union, raided
the joint, yanked out phonograph plugs, tore
out radio tubes, and screamed defiance at the
Nitery owls who were making the night hideous
and Hansen perfidious.
They are laughing because undercover men
have revealed that Dr. Hansen's bed-time is
8 p.m. and that Saturday night Dr. Hansen
couldn't get to sleep until the wee hours, oh
not until way after midnight.
He will be in lousy shape this bright and hor
rible Monday, almost as bad as the fellows he
teaches.
Which is in the nature of a New Deal for
harried Hansen, and in the nature of a revela
tion for his students.
For it's about time that this sleeping business
was put on an Honor Code basis. If professors
go to bed with the chickens and get up with
them, it's no wonder that they are impolitely
healthy at 8 a.m. Nor is it a wonder that they
never cut a class, aVid always comment on
eight o'clock cutters.
If the Nitery does nothing else, by keeping
professors awake it will have paid for itself—
an investment in the public weal like the Co
lumbia River salmon ladders.
We mustn't kick Dr. Hansen out of the Old
Union or shut up the Nitery.
No!
The complaint against noise indicates that
all professors should be housed in the Old
Union and that Ihe Nitery should remain open
at least until 2 a.m., undergraduate bedding
hour.
I'll run the phonograph personally.

For it's about time that this sleeping business
was put on an Honor Code basis. If professors
go to bed with the chickens and get up with
them, it's no wonder that they are impolitely
healthy at 8 a.m. Nor is it a wonder that they
never cut a class, aVid always comment on
eight o'clock cutters.
If the Nitery does nothing else, by keeping
professors awake it will have paid for itself—
an investment in the public weal like the Co
lumbia River salmon ladders.
We mustn't kick Dr. Hansen out of the Old
Union or shut up the Nitery.
No!
The complaint against noise indicates that
all professors should be housed in the Old

Life Begins for the Doctor
WHAT'S wrong with the professors is that
they go to bed too early. What's right
with the Nitery is that it keeps the professors
awake.
For this morning, providing Dr. William Web
ster Hansen has an eight o'clock physics class,
he will wake up feeling just a little bit like the
students he teaches.
Niteryites whose Love Bug Was Biten Em
shortly after 12 p.m. Friday, on a 25-watt output
auditorium-type speaker, are still laughing.
At that time Dr. William Webster Hansen
arose from his couch in the Old Union, raided
the joint, yanked out phonograph plugs, tore
out radio tubes, and screamed defiance at the
Nitery owls who were making the night hideous
and Hansen perfidious.
They are laughing because undercover men
have revealed that Dr. Hansen's bed-time is
8 p.m. and that Saturday night Dr. Hansen
couldn't get to sleep until the wee hours, oh
not until way after midnight.
He will be in lousy shape this bright and hor
rible Monday, almost as bad as the fellows he
teaches.
Which is in the nature of a New Deal for
harried Hansen, and in the nature of a revela
tion for his students.
