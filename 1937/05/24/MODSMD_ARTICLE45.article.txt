# The 						Spirits of Princeton Halls
## 
### 
Apparently Princeton has somewhat the same
liquor regulations as Stanford. The editoriaj
below from the Daily Princetonian is a clinical
illustration ot howv a perfectly good law turns
bad because it is broken. The views it presents,
though interesting, are not necessarily those ot
The Daily.
THE number of short suspensions from the
University that resulted from a beer spree in
Witherspoon last week has brought to our at
tention once more Princeton's regulation for
bidding the possession and consumption of
alcoholic spirits in dormitory rooms.
The rule and its enforcement are open to
much criticism from either extreme: on one
hand, because it is not thoroughly enforced; on
the other, because it is, like the 18th Amend
ment, unenforceable and should therefore be
discarded completely. It is our opinion, how
ever, that the action of the officials in Nassau
Hall and Stanhope Basement in regard to this
question is very wise.
The Administration retains the rule in order
to soothe outraged parents and to have a club
to wield in the case of extreme violations, but
the proctors do not make a habit of spying on
tippling undergraduates and are especially
lenient on convivial holidays.
This position is, of course, a compromise, but
since there are plentiful and good reasons why
the rule should not be abolished and cannot be
enforced, compromise is obviously the answer.
We are very sorry for the undergraduates who
do happen to fall afoul of the regulation, while
other offenders may avoid detection, but we
must advise all students that they are still get
ting a good bargain in the drinking regulations
and that if they want to run the risk of riotous
carousal in dormitory rooms, they must be
willing to face the consequences.
