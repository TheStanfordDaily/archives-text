### 
/ I HAPARRAL'S next issue, as you all know, is it's
4 tradition-breaking number, which will be very
funny, and everybody will laugh. Everyone will laugh
because Chappie will defy the conventionalities of
college life in print, and the funnymen will get their
little vicarious thrill out of being very "different" and
very funny. Something very different happens, how
ever, when someone defies conventionalities on some
place besides rag content bond or newsprints.
Maybe some day when you're sitting in a class lis
tening to a lecture on the Juxtaposition of Phonetic

Phinigling, you would like to put down your cross
word puzzles, stand up and say, "Frankly, professor,
I think you're making an awful ass of yourself," and
then retire in utter rout to a quiet beer, a loaf of
bread, and thou, singing in the wilderness. But do
you? No, you sit still and make an awful ass of your
self. »
What happens, though, when somebody has the
courage of his impulses, when he tells people what he
thinks of them, does old sense-of-humor Stanford
laugh? No, it thinks he's drunk and tells him to go
see the nearest psychiatrist.
IV OT so long ago there came a knock at the door of
204 Sequoia. "Who's there?" came the muffled
voice.
"Friends," said the knocker.
The muffled voice opened the door, and in walked
the Men's Council.
The man it sought had a long list of offenses against
him.
In classrooms he had eaten loaves of bread and a
series of doughnuts off a stick. He had walked around
barefoot in a sheet.
One day, when bored with a lecture, he got up be
neath the splits in a participle and a underneath hang
ing indention, and just walked out, peering in through
the window at the stupid cattle who had no nerve to
resist this insult to their intelligences.
One day when Professor Hulme locked his class
room doors to late-comers, he locked them against an
intellect of no average ability.
Instead of meekly submitting to the dictum, the in
tellect, resenting the act, climbed up on a skylight over
the class, hung his legs down, and cooed like a dove
all during the performance.
TOURING last finals time, he was bored by the thought
of taking his own finals, so he went around and
gathered up blue books and examination sheets of
other handy classes.
One rainy day last quarter he was seen walking
about in a snappy white suit, with a buttercup in his
buttonhole. Amazed at the dressyness of the intel
lect, since he usually dressed in Sequoia Sempervirens
style, inquirers discovered that the reason for his
chic was the fact that he had taken a shower in his
regular clothes.
As a sample of the distortion that his individuality
invited was the story going around that he came home
late one night during spring vacation and saw some
pink rabbits in the corner and then went down town to
buy some white rabbits to keep them company.
This is untrue. What actually happened was that
it was Easter, and our intellect had an impulse. He
wanted rabbits; so he bought rabbits. He bought a
dozen rabbits of one kind and then, feeling sorry for
their lonesomeness, he went down town and bought a
dozen rabbits of another kind. These were turned
completely loose in his room along with a duck, a
drake, three roosters and two hens, while the intel
lect tfat down and waited for geometric progression to
set in. The man loved animals.
W/ELL, the Men's Council didn't get their man that
time, the room-mate said he was out, and he
was. But the officers of the law finally caught up with
him, as you all know, last Wednesday at 5 o'clock in
the morning when he, in company with his room-mate
and an English sailor, they had uncovered at a local
counter, manned the fire escape and jolly-well sailed
Sequoia Hall through hay-hay shoals to the Physics
Corner.
The officer sailed with them through the shoals,
but made them pull the hall over to the curb when
they got to the rat mazes. A rat maze is no place for
a sea-going men's dormitory; it's not charted.
The result of the encounter was that the Jolly Tar
was sent sailing off into space. The room-mate, son of
a famous writer of detective stories, was expelled from
school, and the intellect was jugged, bottled, and sent
home.
A STRAIGHT-A student, a budding social psychol
ogist and anthropologist, the man with the sheet
probably read too much, he probably knew too much
about social controls and how they grew.
After his hasty departure from Stanford, he intends
to head for Spain, where things aren't quite so conven
tional, and in another 30 years will probably be on
the Board of Trustees, along with all the other famous
Stanford men who have been kicked out.

buy some white rabbits to keep them company.
This is untrue. What actually happened was that
it was Easter, and our intellect had an impulse. He
wanted rabbits; so he bought rabbits. He bought a
dozen rabbits of one kind and then, feeling sorry for
their lonesomeness, he went down town and bought a
dozen rabbits of another kind. These were turned
completely loose in his room along with a duck, a
drake, three roosters and two hens, while the intel
lect tfat down and waited for geometric progression to
set in. The man loved animals.
W/ELL, the Men's Council didn't get their man that
time, the room-mate said he was out, and he
was. But the officers of the law finally caught up with
him, as you all know, last Wednesday at 5 o'clock in
the morning when he, in company with his room-mate
and an English sailor, they had uncovered at a local
counter, manned the fire escape and jolly-well sailed
Sequoia Hall through hay-hay shoals to the Physics
Corner.
The officer sailed with them through the shoals,
but made them pull the hall over to the curb when
they got to the rat mazes. A rat maze is no place for
a sea-going men's dormitory; it's not charted.
The result of the encounter was that the Jolly Tar
was sent sailing off into space. The room-mate, son of
a famous writer of detective stories, was expelled from
school, and the intellect was jugged, bottled, and sent
home.
A STRAIGHT-A student, a budding social psychol
ogist and anthropologist, the man with the sheet

about social controls and how they grew.
After his hasty departure from Stanford, he intends
to head for Spain, where things aren't quite so conven
tional, and in another 30 years will probably be on
the Board of Trustees, along with all the other famous
Stanford men who have been kicked out.

because Chappie will defy the conventionalities of

little vicarious thrill out of being very "different" and

Maybe some day when you're sitting in a class lis
tening to a lecture on the Juxtaposition of Phonetic

Phinigling, you would like to put down your cross
word puzzles, stand up and say, "Frankly, professor,
I think you're making an awful ass of yourself," and
then retire in utter rout to a quiet beer, a loaf of
bread, and thou, singing in the wilderness. But do
you? No, you sit still and make an awful ass of your
self. »
What happens, though, when somebody has the
courage of his impulses, when he tells people what he
thinks of them, does old sense-of-humor Stanford
laugh? No, it thinks he's drunk and tells him to go

IV OT so long ago there came a knock at the door of
204 Sequoia. "Who's there?" came the muffled
voice.
"Friends," said the knocker.
The muffled voice opened the door, and in walked
the Men's Council.
The man it sought had a long list of offenses against
him.
In classrooms he had eaten loaves of bread and a
series of doughnuts off a stick. He had walked around
barefoot in a sheet.
One day, when bored with a lecture, he got up be
neath the splits in a participle and a underneath hang
ing indention, and just walked out, peering in through
the window at the stupid cattle who had no nerve to
resist this insult to their intelligences.
One day when Professor Hulme locked his class
room doors to late-comers, he locked them against an
intellect of no average ability.
Instead of meekly submitting to the dictum, the in
tellect, resenting the act, climbed up on a skylight over
the class, hung his legs down, and cooed like a dove
all during the performance.
TOURING last finals time, he was bored by the thought
of taking his own finals, so he went around and
gathered up blue books and examination sheets of
other handy classes.
One rainy day last quarter he was seen walking
about in a snappy white suit, with a buttercup in his
buttonhole. Amazed at the dressyness of the intel
lect, since he usually dressed in Sequoia Sempervirens
style, inquirers discovered that the reason for his
chic was the fact that he had taken a shower in his
regular clothes.

invited was the story going around that he came home

courage of his impulses, when he tells people what he
thinks of them, does old sense-of-humor Stanford
laugh? No, it thinks he's drunk and tells him to go
see the nearest psychiatrist.
IV OT so long ago there came a knock at the door of
204 Sequoia. "Who's there?" came the muffled
voice.
"Friends," said the knocker.
The muffled voice opened the door, and in walked
the Men's Council.
The man it sought had a long list of offenses against
him.
In classrooms he had eaten loaves of bread and a
series of doughnuts off a stick. He had walked around
barefoot in a sheet.
One day, when bored with a lecture, he got up be
neath the splits in a participle and a underneath hang
ing indention, and just walked out, peering in through
the window at the stupid cattle who had no nerve to
resist this insult to their intelligences.
One day when Professor Hulme locked his class
room doors to late-comers, he locked them against an
intellect of no average ability.
Instead of meekly submitting to the dictum, the in
tellect, resenting the act, climbed up on a skylight over
the class, hung his legs down, and cooed like a dove
all during the performance.
TOURING last finals time, he was bored by the thought
of taking his own finals, so he went around and
gathered up blue books and examination sheets of
other handy classes.
One rainy day last quarter he was seen walking
about in a snappy white suit, with a buttercup in his
buttonhole. Amazed at the dressyness of the intel
lect, since he usually dressed in Sequoia Sempervirens
style, inquirers discovered that the reason for his
chic was the fact that he had taken a shower in his
regular clothes.
As a sample of the distortion that his individuality
invited was the story going around that he came home
late one night during spring vacation and saw some
pink rabbits in the corner and then went down town to
buy some white rabbits to keep them company.
This is untrue. What actually happened was that
it was Easter, and our intellect had an impulse. He
wanted rabbits; so he bought rabbits. He bought a
dozen rabbits of one kind and then, feeling sorry for
their lonesomeness, he went down town and bought a
dozen rabbits of another kind. These were turned
completely loose in his room along with a duck, a
drake, three roosters and two hens, while the intel
lect tfat down and waited for geometric progression to
set in. The man loved animals.
W/ELL, the Men's Council didn't get their man that
time, the room-mate said he was out, and he
was. But the officers of the law finally caught up with
him, as you all know, last Wednesday at 5 o'clock in
the morning when he, in company with his room-mate
and an English sailor, they had uncovered at a local
counter, manned the fire escape and jolly-well sailed
Sequoia Hall through hay-hay shoals to the Physics
Corner.
The officer sailed with them through the shoals,
but made them pull the hall over to the curb when
they got to the rat mazes. A rat maze is no place for
a sea-going men's dormitory; it's not charted.
The result of the encounter was that the Jolly Tar
was sent sailing off into space. The room-mate, son of
a famous writer of detective stories, was expelled from
school, and the intellect was jugged, bottled, and sent
home.
A STRAIGHT-A student, a budding social psychol
ogist and anthropologist, the man with the sheet
probably read too much, he probably knew too much
about social controls and how they grew.
After his hasty departure from Stanford, he intends
to head for Spain, where things aren't quite so conven
tional, and in another 30 years will probably be on
the Board of Trustees, along with all the other famous
Stanford men who have been kicked out.
/ I HAPARRAL'S next issue, as you all know, is it's
4 tradition-breaking number, which will be very
funny, and everybody will laugh. Everyone will laugh
because Chappie will defy the conventionalities of
college life in print, and the funnymen will get their
little vicarious thrill out of being very "different" and
very funny. Something very different happens, how
ever, when someone defies conventionalities on some
place besides rag content bond or newsprints.
Maybe some day when you're sitting in a class lis
tening to a lecture on the Juxtaposition of Phonetic

Phinigling, you would like to put down your cross
word puzzles, stand up and say, "Frankly, professor,
I think you're making an awful ass of yourself," and
then retire in utter rout to a quiet beer, a loaf of
bread, and thou, singing in the wilderness. But do
you? No, you sit still and make an awful ass of your
self. »
