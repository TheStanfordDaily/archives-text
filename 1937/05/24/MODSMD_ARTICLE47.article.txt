PROOF OF TIIE PUDDING
"to find out the facts" about Eneina Commons,
news-hounds Dudman and Press have returned
heavy laden. Under their direction, Truth, crushed to
earth, has risen again, made manifest in some 75 square
inches of print, with art. It appears that in equipment
and management Encina makes the kitchens of Heaven
look like a second-rate beanery.
With some hesitation, I submit one fact not includ
ed in our news-hounds' data: The food Encina serves
the frosh is not as good as it should be.
The cautious wording of this statement results from
the reverberations of my last criticism of the foodery.
For several days after that, dire tales of heartbreak in
the Encina backshop came to me. My hasher friends
dropped in with reproachful looks, and demonstiatcd
new ways of saying, "And thou too, Brutus."
* # * *
But in making a whitewashed glory out of Encina,
Messrs. Dudman and Press made an Augean stables
out of the Daily shack. Someone must do a clean-up
job.
An unofficial (Ex Committee take note) survey of
the unsolicited (E.C.T.N.) reports that trickle out of
Encina's hinterland indicates that many if not most
of the frosh consider the food pretty awful. And for
what it is worth, I may say that I feel the same, I who
am "pregnant" with nothing, particularly not with
"übiquitous tradition."
It is practically impossible to discover the reason
why the "food" is below standard. Most of us agree
that it is not the fault, of the hashers whom D. and P.,
Inc., defend so eloquently. Blame may rest on man
agement, on cooking, or on that old devil, "übiquitous
tradition." Perhaps it is impossible to feed 300 men
properly at one time.
* ♦ * *
/ \NE obvious trouble is that neither frosh nor hash
ers have been informed of their privileges. Last
Friday, one of the braver frosh asked for a lettuce
salad instead of combination, citing as authority the
Dudman and Press- scries. The astounded hasher's re
ply carried that emphatic negation found only in
four-letter words.
Hardly a freshman in Encina knew that he couid
air his objections in any way that would bring real
results. Most of them don't believe it now. Current
opinion is that there is no court of appeal from cellu
loid carrots and sea-weed spinach.
# * * *
When the University forces the frosh to eat at En
cina. it assumes the obligation of feeding them properly.
Despite the beauty of the kitchens'and the magnificent
efficiency of the hashers, it is not doing it. Nor is
contemplation of the glories of mass production any
cure for indigestion. If numbers make good food im
possible, the numbers should be reduced.
Encina may be a marvel of efficiency, but it doesn't
satisfy the frosh.
Hashers with reproachful looks will please call dur
ing office hours one I<> three at the Daily shack.

/ \NE obvious trouble is that neither frosh nor hash
ers have been informed of their privileges. Last
Friday, one of the braver frosh asked for a lettuce
salad instead of combination, citing as authority the
Dudman and Press- scries. The astounded hasher's re
ply carried that emphatic negation found only in
four-letter words.
Hardly a freshman in Encina knew that he couid
air his objections in any way that would bring real
results. Most of them don't believe it now. Current
opinion is that there is no court of appeal from cellu
loid carrots and sea-weed spinach.

When the University forces the frosh to eat at En
cina. it assumes the obligation of feeding them properly.
Despite the beauty of the kitchens'and the magnificent
efficiency of the hashers, it is not doing it. Nor is
contemplation of the glories of mass production any
cure for indigestion. If numbers make good food im
possible, the numbers should be reduced.
Encina may be a marvel of efficiency, but it doesn't
satisfy the frosh.
Hashers with reproachful looks will please call dur

PROOF OF TIIE PUDDING
"to find out the facts" about Eneina Commons,
news-hounds Dudman and Press have returned
heavy laden. Under their direction, Truth, crushed to
earth, has risen again, made manifest in some 75 square
inches of print, with art. It appears that in equipment
and management Encina makes the kitchens of Heaven
look like a second-rate beanery.
With some hesitation, I submit one fact not includ
ed in our news-hounds' data: The food Encina serves
the frosh is not as good as it should be.
The cautious wording of this statement results from
the reverberations of my last criticism of the foodery.
For several days after that, dire tales of heartbreak in
the Encina backshop came to me. My hasher friends
dropped in with reproachful looks, and demonstiatcd
new ways of saying, "And thou too, Brutus."
* # * *
But in making a whitewashed glory out of Encina,
Messrs. Dudman and Press made an Augean stables
out of the Daily shack. Someone must do a clean-up
job.
An unofficial (Ex Committee take note) survey of
the unsolicited (E.C.T.N.) reports that trickle out of
Encina's hinterland indicates that many if not most
of the frosh consider the food pretty awful. And for
what it is worth, I may say that I feel the same, I who
am "pregnant" with nothing, particularly not with
"übiquitous tradition."
It is practically impossible to discover the reason
why the "food" is below standard. Most of us agree
that it is not the fault, of the hashers whom D. and P.,
Inc., defend so eloquently. Blame may rest on man
agement, on cooking, or on that old devil, "übiquitous
tradition." Perhaps it is impossible to feed 300 men
properly at one time.
