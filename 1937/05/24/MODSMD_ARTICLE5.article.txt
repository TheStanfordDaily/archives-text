# Nitery Noise Sends Profs On Rampage
## 
### 
Dancing to the music of the radio
and phonograph. Hatchery first
nighters were testing the possibilities
of the new nitery Friday evening
when, with a shout of "That's all!
Go on home!" the electric cord to the
phonograph, was jerked from its
socket.
Looming in the doorway before
the startled dancers were Dr. Wil
liam Hansen, assistant professor of
physics, and Robert Wathen, lecture
assistant in the same department.
"How do you expect anyone to
sleep upstairs?" shouted one of the
pair. Dead silence. "There's more
ways than one to fix this thing,"
Hansen said, turning to the radio
and yanking the cord from the wall.
Wathen, meanwhile, removed a
couple of tubes from the radio. Then
the two stalked out of the room and
back to their sleeping quarters on
the second floor.
With their disappearance, indig
nant couples busied themselves in
fixing the phonograph. Meanwhile,
Officer George Burns arrived. Fol
lowed by interested nitery-guests,
he went up to see Hansen and
Wathen, who stated their case.
After asking one radio player at
about 10 o'clock for a little less noise,
they had again been disturbed by
the noise below. Admitting their in
judicious haste, they asked Burns to
close the nitery. Burns refused,
acting, he said, on orders from Stan
ford officials. The tubes were re
turned and the dance went on.
