# Student Heads Plan Exchanges
## Pan â€“ American Transfers Asked by Association 
### 
A resolution to attempt inaugu
ration of an exchange student plan
with Central American universities
was one of the many actions taken
at the convention of the Pacific Stu
dent Presidents' Association, which
met in Fresno the end of last week.
Jim Reynolds and Tom Killefer,
present and incoming student body
presidents, represented Stanford at
the convention, at which representa
tives from Pacific Coast and other
Western universities were also pres
ent. Purpose of the convention is to
give the new presidents the benefit
of the experience of the outgoing
officers, and to exchange ideas con
cerning intercollegiate activities.
Reynolds told the convention about
his good-will tour to Central Amer
ica, and was largely responsible for
the adoption of the resolution to pro
mote co-operation between Ameri
can and Central American universi
ties by means of exchange students.
A plan whereby student body
presidents would receive a scholar
ship during their term of office was
advocated by the convention, after
the representatives reported that
many able students were forced out
of running for the office because they
could not maintain paying jobs at
the same time, and because it took
too much time from their scholastic
and other extra-curricular activities.
Opposition to the bill now before
the California legislature proposing
compulsory R.O.T.C. for universi
ties was expressed by the convention
in a resolution.
After 18 years of sleeping in his
own coffin, Frederich Jesse, of Ak
ron, Colorado, was buried in the
same coffin.
