# Laughs, Capable Crew Save 'Down the Hatch'
## 
### JIM STONE 
When Barnstormers' "S. S. Platonic" set sail Friday night she was a
pretty boggy old vessel, showing the wear and tear of collcge musicals
for years back. But a goodly number of belly-laughs and the efforts of a
willing and able crew kept her afloat. But sometimes 110 more than that.

The most finished job in the show'
' was probably Mac Gordon's music;
|we liked particularly, "Love in a
| Mist," "I've Got the Devil to Thank
i for You," and the finale, "Down the
! Hatch." But the fingers had to fight
: a losing battle with the orchestra
' and a mike on the blink.
Lots of people were good, and fun
to watch. Owen Clarke, though, was
I disappointing, being, as an actor, a
i good physical education instructor
! rather than a stage version of one.
Plot Indigestible
But he and Jerry Reed, who han
dled her part to the whistles of the
roughs, did the best they could with
the plot, which was sort of an in
digestible lump around which every
i one had to dodge. The less said
'about it the better; which seems to
■ have been the attitude when it was
written.
Cady deservedly pulled down his
; share of laughs, and those two mad
I zanies, Larry Randall and Hoke
i Roberts, stopped the show at regu
j lar intervals.
Fran Farmer was her own indi
vidual self, and Bud Bernhardt,
I though kept under wraps, made us
wish he had been given more chanc
, es to strut his stuff. The chorus was
' in there fighting all the time and
j did as much as anyone to keep the
j show from sagging too often.
Singing Hampered
As a whole, the production lacked
j punch in the crucial moments. Tne
difficulties which made the singing
[ almost ineffective were partially at
! the root of the matter. However,
; where some sort of climax—any sort
I - seemed indicated—as at the end of
| a song—things just sort of stopped
l and sat down for a while until somc
j one got it going again.
For instance, the finale of the first
j acc, with one of the better numbers
to work with, "Gotta Take Steps,"
J should have made a top-notch cur
| tain. Everyone except the ship's cat
j vocally followed Travis Windsor's
J nimble heels, but that was the trou
' ble.
After everyone had taken steps,
things just stopped and someone re
membered to draw the curtain. No
1 timing; and it was characteristic of
(he whole show except for the finale,
which was all anyone could ask for.
This fault is more a technical one
than inherent in the play.
But the aforemerttioned belly
-1 laughs, which came often enough,
1 and the work of Cady, Randall,
Robertson, Jones, et al, kept the old
ark riding through to the end.
