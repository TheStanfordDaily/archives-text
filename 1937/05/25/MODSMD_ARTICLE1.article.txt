# Security Act Upheld By 5-4 Decision
## Unemployed Insurance, Old Age Pensions Win Okay from High Court 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 24 (UP). —
The Supreme Court today upheld
constitutionality of federal old age
annuities and of unemployment in
surance, the two chief phases of the
New Deal's vast social security pro
gram affecting 30,000,000 American
employers and wage earners.
Maintaining its record of not hav
ing ruled against a Roosevelt ad
ministration policy this term, the
court completed action on the last
major test by deciding four cases
involving three issues in favor of the
government.
Tax Decisions
1. The federal employer-worker
taxes imposed to make it possible

for workers to retire at 65 on gov
ernment pensions. The vote was
7 to 2.
2. The federal taxes levied on em
ployers to make possible benefits to
their workers when they are unem
ployed. The vote was 5 to 4.
3. The Alabama state employment
insurance law setting up the ma
chinery under which unemployed
workers of that state shall receive
benefits. The vote was 5 to 4.
The four justices who voted to
invalidate unemployment insurance
were James C. Mcßeynolds, Willis
Van Devanter, George Sutherland,
and Pierce Butler. They presented
three separate dissenting opinions,
with Van Devanter, who retires from
the court eight days hence, joining
Sutherland in one of them. The two
dissenting justices in the old age
annuity case were Mcßeynolds and
Butler.
Political Thought Cleavage
The climax of the term which be
gan last October and which saw the
court involved in an historic con
troversy between President Roose
velt and Congress over its functions
in the American government, dem
onstrated the sharp cleavage that
has developed in the political think
ing ofMhe "liberal'' and "conserva
tive" blocs. For the third successive
time Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes and Justice Owen J. Rob
erts sided with the "liberals" to give
the government victory.
Justice Benjamin Cardozo, 67
years old today, read the decision
involving the federal old age an
nuity and unemployment insurance
taxes. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone
read the opinion upholding Ala
bama's jobless law.
