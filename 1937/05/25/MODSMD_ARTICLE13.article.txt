# Niterv Will Open Tomorrow-Honest
## 
### 
Stanford's Union Nitery will open
tomorrow night at 8 o'clock, when
Masquers deliver a playlet, entitled
"Comedia del Arte," and when the
Union Dining Hall passes out the re
freshments.
"The Nitery Committee," says A1
Hyman, "feels that this is a particu
larly opportune time to open the
room officially. It is not every year
that we have such exceptional talent
among the entertainers.
"Then, too, it is better to get this
community gathering spot ofT to a
good start in the year when it was
begun than to wait till next year,
when there would be much less in
terest."
