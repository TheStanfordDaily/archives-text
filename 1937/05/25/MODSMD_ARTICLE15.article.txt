Dr. Willis reveals the fact that he
is making significant geological dis
coveries, in a recent letter to Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.

"The present boom in the islands,
due to the discovery of several very
rich gold deposits, will not last,"
predicts Dr. Willis. "A serious de
pression is inevitable."
Works for Government
The well known geologist is work
ing for the government in the inter
est of development of the Philippine
Geologic Survey. A number of

Willis being the only representative
of Stanford.
Dr. Willis has already taken an
