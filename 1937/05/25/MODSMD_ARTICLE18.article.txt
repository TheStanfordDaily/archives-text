# Botsford, Frost Vie For Daily Editorship Today
## Editorial Board To Make Thirty Promotions 
### 
Associate Editors Dave Botsford
and GArdy Frost will battle with
ballots for editorship of next year's
Daily this afternoon, when staff
members cast their votes for Bob
Eisenbach's successor from 1 to 3
o'clock at polls set up in the Daily
shack.
According to Daily custom, the
two associates after marking their
ballots will adjourn with the rest of
the editorial board to a meeting in
the A.S.S.U. committee room to
make about 30 stall promotions for
the coming Volume 92. Their ap
pointments, including the positions
of women's editor, managing editor,
associate editors, night editors, de
partment heads, and copyreaders,
will be announced about 5 o'clock.
Candidates Have Final Fling
Preparatory today's electoral
race, Associates Botsford and Frost
yesterday entertained each other
v/ith the final editorial fling under
Volume 91. Leaving the Daily shack
at noon, the two motored to San
Francisco, where they arrived at 6
o'clock, after stopping at various
points of interest en route.
After a Dutch treat dinner, the
would-be editors concluded their
all-day jaunt by attending the cur
rent production, "Dead End."
Experience Listed
Frost—the "G.F." of the edit page
—has been a member of The Daily
staff since fall quarter of his fresh
man year. He served successively as
copyreader, sports editor, and night
editor before reaching his present
position as associate.
Botsford, known through his by
line Ex Committee stories and for
his "D.8." edits, joined the staff of
the paper spring quarter of his fresh
man year. Like Frost, he served as
copyreader and night editor and was
also feature editor of the volume a
year ago.
31 Votes Expected
To be eligible to vote in this after
noon's elections, members of The
Daily staff must have been active on
the paper for three quarters, exclud
ing the quarter they came on and
the present one.
Night editors and members of the
Edit Board, except the editor, have
two votes each; Editor Eisenbach
has four. Thus, about 34 ballots will
be cast, though only about 21 staff
members will vote. Election Board
Chairman Dave Allison will preside
at the polls.
