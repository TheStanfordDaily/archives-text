# Criticisms Halt Pre-Reg Plans
## Administrators To Hold Redrafting Meeting 
### 
Minor objections by members of
the administration are holding up
the adoption of the revised pre-reg
istration program, according to a
statement made yesterday by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
The plan was submitted to Dr. Wil
bur by Pre-Reg Chairman George
Ditz last week and was approved by
him. Next it was presented to Dean
of Women Mary Yost, Dean of Men
George Culver, and Acting Comp
troller J. Hugh Jackson, who have
registered various criticisms of the
planned execution of the program.
Meeting To Revise Plans
Objections will be ironed out and
the revised plan adopted at a meet
ing of the committee to be held later
this week, Dr. Wilbur predicted.
"Because of the large number of
people involved in pre-registration
scheme, the details have to be care
fully discussed. The thing will not
work itself out," he explained.
The redrafted program calls for
freshman orientation before the
opening of fall quarter financed with
a $4 fee paid by each student at
tending. This takes care of the ad
ministration's chief objection to last
year's scheme which cost it approx
imately $3000, according to Ditz.
Attendance Not Compulsory
Plans include continuing orienta
tion throughout fall quarter. At
tendance at the pre-reg instruction
and festivities will not be compul
sory. Encina sponsors will be al
ready living in the hall when new
men arrive.
Handbooks, which in past years
have arrived so late that they are of
little use to frosh, will be mailed to
them at home during the summer
this year.
