# Child Labor, Wage, Hour Laws Asked
## Roosevelt Wants Board To Govern Industries In Interstate Commerce 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 24 (U.R). —
President Roosevelt asked Congress
in a special message today to enact
at thus session sweeping labor legis
lation which would outlaw child
labor in interstate industries, and
establish wage and hour standards
along the lines of the invalidated
NRA for all workers in interstate
commerce.
Almost immediately corollary
bills were introduced in both the
House and Senate.
They embodied the President's
ideas and, in effect, formally
launched his long-heralded "sec
ond new deal for those at the bot
tom of the economic ladder."
The measures, sponsored by Sena
tol- Hugo L. Black, D., Ala., and
Representative William R. Connery,
D., Mass., chairmen of the Senate
and House labor committees —were
promptly referred to those commit
tees for study.
Their provisions were identical.
They provide for creation of a five
man board, to be named by the
President, which would set up and
administer maximum hour and
minimum wage levels for the mil
lions of workers engaged in in
dustry within the limits of inter
state commerce.
Mr. Roosevelt, in his message,
emphasized that his plan was not
only to bolster living standards of
industrial workers but also to em
brace the farm worker.
The nature of his proposals
would permit Congress to outline
such limits as it may desire on
maximum work week and mini
mum wage regulations, or leave
these issues entirely to the board
the legislation would create.
The President's message was, in
effect, a challenge to the courts to
deny the right of government to
deal with labor conditions. He .said
his plan was "within the common
sense framework and purpose" of the
constitution.
"Legislation can, I hope, be
passed at this session of the Con
gress further to help those who
toil in factory and on farm." de
clared the President. "We have
promised it. We cannot stand still."
"Goods produced under condi
tions which do not meet rudimentary
standards of decency should be re
garded as contraband and ought not
to be allowed to pollute the channcb
of interstate trade.
