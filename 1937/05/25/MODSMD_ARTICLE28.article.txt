# Students To Visit Hearst's Estate
## 
### 
Leaving this morning for San
Simeon, 21 members of Dr. William
Irvine's art appreciation course will
make a two-day study of William
Randolph Hearst's art treasures,
spending the night at Paso Eobles.
According to a letter received by
Dr. Irvine, there is a possibility that
the group will be able to meet Mr.
Hearst personally.
Most important of Mr. Hearst's
well known art collections are his
many sets of silver and his expensive
collection of Oriental rugs, consid
ered by some the most complete on
the west coast.
This art appreciation class. Let
ters A, consists solely of visits to
local homes which are known for
their art collections. Mr. Hearst,
says Dr. Irvine, was greatly pleased
at the prospect of showing a group
of Stanford students the sights of
San Simeon.
