# Lavish Tunneled Estate Adds to Coutts Mystery
## 
### HUNTER HENDEE JOHN RICE 
Weird is the word for the way
Peter Coutts built his baronial es
! tate here in the hills of Stanford.
He surprised Maylield natives late
in 1874 when he popped up from
nowhere, bought a 1400-acre farm
I which he called Ayrshire after a

| breed of cattle, began throwing
[ costly parties and picnics lor any- |
| one who would come.
Physically he was 5 feet 7, weigh
ed 180 pounds, was broad-shoul
| dered, white-haired, 64, possessed
j fine facial features (see cut) and an i
J accent tastefully foreign. Mentally
he was widely learned, addicted to
numerous idiosyncrasies which may :
or may not brand him loco, kind to
all he met —especially animals.
Cottage Resembled Trianon
He lived in a Mayfield hotel until (
work was completed on a small cot
tage which he called Escondite
(Hide-away) patterned after Marie
Antoinette's Petite Trianon hidden
in the forests of Versailles.
A resemblance between the two
cottages stronger than mere looks
is suggested by the charming per- j
sonage of Mile. Eugenie Clogenson, |
who moved into the Hide-away j
house with the invalid Mme. Coutts
and her two small children.
Known is the fact that Mile. Clog
enson was the children's governess; j
presumed is the fact that she was j
Coutts, mistress. Whether Escondite j
Cottage (on Portola Road midway
between the Quad and College Ter
race) was to be the playhouse of \
the young woman after completion |
of the castle Coutts planned for his j
family is a matter of conjecture.
Like Don Quixote, Coutts wanted
himself living in an atmosphere me
dieval, surrounded by castles and
fortresses, towers and tunnels. Un
like Quixote, he had money to make
his dreams come true.
He advertised for "100 men not
afraid of hard work," and when la
borers came by the droves he gave
them all jobs—especially encourag
ing married men from nearby
homes.
Attention was centered on two
projects: breeding thoroughbred cat
tle and landscaping the estate. He
claims to have worked on the latter
as though he "expected to live for
the next 400 years."
Built Artificial Lake
Cyprus trees on his Mystery hill
(between Ryan lab and Coronada
road) and oaks on higher hills back
o(T the campus today testify to his
reforestation plans which he hoped
would increase rainfall.
An army of workmen walled off
an artificial lake at the foot of Mys
tery hill and remnants of his
crumbling fortress at water's edge
still stand hidden jn the brushwood
alongside Coronada.
In 1922 the University filled in
Coutts' lake, once the wonder of the
countryside. Today deep in the
weeds lay its old stone embank
ments, and back a hundred yards
arches the quaint brick bridge
which once crossed one of the two
streams feeding the lake with water
from the hills.
Tunnels Converge from Lake
But most fantastic constructions
of all are Coutts' mysterious tun
nels, long publicized in wild tales
of Coutts' hiding and escape. Early
accounts name six separate tunnels
converging from the artificial lake.
Today, however, evidence remains
of only three: one opening on the
north side of Mystery Hill and ap
parently running under the hill to
Coutts' brick dam opposite the Ryan
lab; another opening across the creek
and running to a lost outlet; and the
third from Coutts' picturesque tower
on Page Mill road to a caved-in en
trance 100 yards down Matadero
Creek.
Mysteries Keep Coutts Alive
Mid-way along the Mystery hill
tunnel is supposedly Coutts' refuge
chamber, filled with the answers to
countless Coutts' mysteries Stan
fordites have long been eager to
know. Today one entrance is com
pletely caved in, the other accessible
for only some 40 or 50 feet.
Why did Coutts' tunnel these
catacombs? And why did he want
them completed before work on his
mansion began? And why did he
build a doorless tower hidden back
in the woods along Matadero Creek?
These are questions that keep Peter
Coutts alive on the campus today.

the young woman after completion |
of the castle Coutts planned for his j
family is a matter of conjecture.
Like Don Quixote, Coutts wanted
himself living in an atmosphere me
dieval, surrounded by castles and
fortresses, towers and tunnels. Un
like Quixote, he had money to make
his dreams come true.
He advertised for "100 men not
afraid of hard work," and when la
borers came by the droves he gave
them all jobs—especially encourag
ing married men from nearby
homes.
Attention was centered on two
projects: breeding thoroughbred cat
tle and landscaping the estate. He
claims to have worked on the latter
as though he "expected to live for
the next 400 years."
Built Artificial Lake
Cyprus trees on his Mystery hill
(between Ryan lab and Coronada
road) and oaks on higher hills back
o(T the campus today testify to his
reforestation plans which he hoped
would increase rainfall.
An army of workmen walled off
an artificial lake at the foot of Mys
tery hill and remnants of his
crumbling fortress at water's edge
still stand hidden jn the brushwood
alongside Coronada.
In 1922 the University filled in
Coutts' lake, once the wonder of the
countryside. Today deep in the
weeds lay its old stone embank
ments, and back a hundred yards
arches the quaint brick bridge
which once crossed one of the two
streams feeding the lake with water
from the hills.
Tunnels Converge from Lake
But most fantastic constructions
of all are Coutts' mysterious tun
nels, long publicized in wild tales
of Coutts' hiding and escape. Early
accounts name six separate tunnels
converging from the artificial lake.
Today, however, evidence remains
of only three: one opening on the
north side of Mystery Hill and ap
parently running under the hill to
Coutts' brick dam opposite the Ryan
lab; another opening across the creek
and running to a lost outlet; and the
third from Coutts' picturesque tower
on Page Mill road to a caved-in en
trance 100 yards down Matadero
Creek.
Mysteries Keep Coutts Alive
Mid-way along the Mystery hill
tunnel is supposedly Coutts' refuge
chamber, filled with the answers to
countless Coutts' mysteries Stan
fordites have long been eager to
know. Today one entrance is com
pletely caved in, the other accessible
for only some 40 or 50 feet.
Why did Coutts' tunnel these
catacombs? And why did he want
them completed before work on his
mansion began? And why did he
build a doorless tower hidden back
in the woods along Matadero Creek?
These are questions that keep Peter
Coutts alive on the campus today.
Weird is the word for the way
Peter Coutts built his baronial es
! tate here in the hills of Stanford.
He surprised Maylield natives late
in 1874 when he popped up from
nowhere, bought a 1400-acre farm
I which he called Ayrshire after a

| breed of cattle, began throwing
[ costly parties and picnics lor any- |
| one who would come.
Physically he was 5 feet 7, weigh
ed 180 pounds, was broad-shoul
| dered, white-haired, 64, possessed
j fine facial features (see cut) and an i
J accent tastefully foreign. Mentally
he was widely learned, addicted to
numerous idiosyncrasies which may :
or may not brand him loco, kind to
all he met —especially animals.
Cottage Resembled Trianon
He lived in a Mayfield hotel until (
work was completed on a small cot
tage which he called Escondite
(Hide-away) patterned after Marie
Antoinette's Petite Trianon hidden
in the forests of Versailles.
A resemblance between the two
cottages stronger than mere looks
is suggested by the charming per- j
sonage of Mile. Eugenie Clogenson, |
who moved into the Hide-away j
house with the invalid Mme. Coutts
and her two small children.
Known is the fact that Mile. Clog
enson was the children's governess; j
presumed is the fact that she was j
Coutts, mistress. Whether Escondite j
Cottage (on Portola Road midway
between the Quad and College Ter
race) was to be the playhouse of \

converging from the artificial lake.
Today, however, evidence remains
of only three: one opening on the
north side of Mystery Hill and ap
parently running under the hill to
Coutts' brick dam opposite the Ryan
lab; another opening across the creek
and running to a lost outlet; and the
third from Coutts' picturesque tower
on Page Mill road to a caved-in en
trance 100 yards down Matadero
Creek.
Mysteries Keep Coutts Alive
Mid-way along the Mystery hill
tunnel is supposedly Coutts' refuge
chamber, filled with the answers to
countless Coutts' mysteries Stan
fordites have long been eager to
know. Today one entrance is com
pletely caved in, the other accessible
for only some 40 or 50 feet.
Why did Coutts' tunnel these
catacombs? And why did he want
them completed before work on his
mansion began? And why did he
build a doorless tower hidden back
in the woods along Matadero Creek?
These are questions that keep Peter
Coutts alive on the campus today.
