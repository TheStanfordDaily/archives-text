SINCE PITTSBURGH trimmed
Washington in the Rose Bowl the
first of this year on a straight power
offense, while the Huskies were !
floundering around all afternoon
trying everything they had in a fair
ly versatile book of tricks, you'd :
think that the Coast teams would
stick to power in football, instead of
any of the open game stuff.
But no, there seems to be a trend |
in Pacific football that junks the big- j
line, straight-ahead theory in favor i
of more liberalized play.
FOR INSTANCE, take a look at j
Stub Allison's plans so lar this
spring. Last year and the year be
fore he had what was classed as j
great material, but his attempts to
develop a powerhouse attack last 1
year in particular fell flatter than a
stove-lid. Along about the middle j
of the season last year he started to j
use a few laterals, and what hap- '
pened? Boom, that's what hap
pened, and Stanford sadly enough !
got caught in the rush.
Now Stub has called off the rough j
.stuff, and figures to have a light, j
fast outfit next year. In John Meek, j
Vic Bottari, and a host of others I
Stub will have a slough of backs j
good enough for that type of offense, j
and in spite of the fact that he i
won't have any great tackles his |
line might be sufficient for a fast at- !
lack, too. Whether that line will be I
able to put up a stiff-defense, though, I
is going to be one of his chief wor- ;
lies.
U.S.C. HAS changed the style of J
attack, too, because Howard Jones
is beginning to use the single and
double wingbacks of the Warner
system, with variations, of course.
Laterals supposedly will come into
play in profusion. The use of Bill
Sangster at fullback in the Warner
type offense, too, is going to mean
quite a lot to Jones, if all they say
about this kid is true. However, his
efforts will be more on the power
line, since he is a fast-moving driver
on the Grayson type.
U.C.L.A. PROBABLY won't change
too much, since Bill Spaulding's line
this year will be just about the same
as last year—willing but none too
steady. His backs will be good, they
say, but he won't have any out
standing threat, and without a good
line you can't hope to see the Bruins
at the top. No matter what offense
you play, booming or flitting, you
have to have a stiff line to prevent
opponents from sifting through too
fast.
HERE AT STANFORD, of course,
the return of Bill Paulman means a
lot of accurate passing, and since
that pony backfield is largely going
to be the case again this year, wide
open play should be the mode of
the moment. Jim Groves is sup
posed to be a power threat, but he
can't be considered in the same
breath with Grayson, and then again
his speed might make him more
helpful in open attack.
Thornhill's search for speed is
shown in the report that he is try
ing to lure Jimmy Kneubuhl out
to the grid for a fling at his game
for a while. That's no idle jest,
either, for Jimmy was one of the
finest backs in the Islands in his
high school days. He came here
with a sprinting reputation that
overshadowed his name for football,
hut you never can tell about these
Islanders. Tiny might have some
thing there.
WHEN YOU THINK back to last
season you remember that Stan
ford's best moments came when
things were opened up. With Cal
velli and Brigham throwing passes
to Clark, Coflis, and Stone, the team
did its best work. Think what can
be done this fall, with Paulman
pitching.
ALL-IN-ALL, the Coast is liber
alizing, 'tis true. Even Washington
will have to go a bit farther this year
than last, since Phelan has lost the
heart of a mighty line and retains
a crew of light, fast backs.

for a while. That's no idle jest,
either, for Jimmy was one of the

high school days. He came here

WHEN YOU THINK back to last
season you remember that Stan
ford's best moments came when
things were opened up. With Cal
velli and Brigham throwing passes
to Clark, Coflis, and Stone, the team
did its best work. Think what can
be done this fall, with Paulman
pitching.
ALL-IN-ALL, the Coast is liber

SINCE PITTSBURGH trimmed
Washington in the Rose Bowl the
first of this year on a straight power
offense, while the Huskies were !
floundering around all afternoon
trying everything they had in a fair
ly versatile book of tricks, you'd :
think that the Coast teams would
stick to power in football, instead of
any of the open game stuff.
But no, there seems to be a trend |
in Pacific football that junks the big- j
line, straight-ahead theory in favor i
of more liberalized play.
FOR INSTANCE, take a look at j
Stub Allison's plans so lar this
spring. Last year and the year be
fore he had what was classed as j
great material, but his attempts to
develop a powerhouse attack last 1
year in particular fell flatter than a
stove-lid. Along about the middle j
of the season last year he started to j
use a few laterals, and what hap- '
pened? Boom, that's what hap
pened, and Stanford sadly enough !
got caught in the rush.
Now Stub has called off the rough j
.stuff, and figures to have a light, j
fast outfit next year. In John Meek, j
Vic Bottari, and a host of others I
Stub will have a slough of backs j
good enough for that type of offense, j
and in spite of the fact that he i
won't have any great tackles his |
line might be sufficient for a fast at- !
lack, too. Whether that line will be I
able to put up a stiff-defense, though, I
is going to be one of his chief wor- ;
lies.
U.S.C. HAS changed the style of J
attack, too, because Howard Jones
is beginning to use the single and
double wingbacks of the Warner
system, with variations, of course.
Laterals supposedly will come into
play in profusion. The use of Bill
Sangster at fullback in the Warner
type offense, too, is going to mean
quite a lot to Jones, if all they say
about this kid is true. However, his
efforts will be more on the power
line, since he is a fast-moving driver
on the Grayson type.
U.C.L.A. PROBABLY won't change
too much, since Bill Spaulding's line
this year will be just about the same
as last year—willing but none too
steady. His backs will be good, they
say, but he won't have any out
standing threat, and without a good
line you can't hope to see the Bruins
at the top. No matter what offense
you play, booming or flitting, you
have to have a stiff line to prevent
opponents from sifting through too
fast.
