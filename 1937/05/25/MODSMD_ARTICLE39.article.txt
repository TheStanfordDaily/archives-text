# Poloists Defeat Oregon State; Lose Title Tilt
## Arizonans Win Western Honors in Nationwide Collegiate Tournament 
### 
Indian second-string horsemen j
played top-notch polo here last Fri- j
day to defeat the Oregon State team
10-2, but the first-string riders
fared less successfully in Los An- j
geles where they were taken, 8-3, !
by the University of Arizona in the '
Western Division of the Intercol
legiate Polo Association champion
ship play-off.
Saturday's game was probably j
lost through early tenseness and j
perhaps superior horsemanship on
the part of the Wildcats, although
the Redshirts matched them in
mallet work. The Arizona triumph
leaves the Cardinals runners-up
for the Pacific Coast championship
and gives the University of Ari
zona a trip east at the expense of j
the association to meet eastern j
schools.
Friday's game with Oregon State
marks a high point for second
string performance as the Indian
first-string previously won over the
Oregonians by only two more j
points. Wallace at No. 3, captain- j
ing the Indians, was high-point man J
with 5 goals. Hyde at No. 1 brought i
in three tallies and McAusland at
No. 2 drove through two. McClin
tock played back at the No. 4 posi
tion.
Panglc of Oregon State at No. I), j
who with Scoville at No. 1 brought j
the visitors two points will
probably be remembered here as
an all-American football player in
his undergraduate days.
Cardinal polo men will end the
season this week with an inter
squad for the Military
Department trophy and for the "B"
squad trophy. Members of the win
ning teams will also receive indi
vidual cups. "A" squad teams are
captained by members of the regu
lar first team and composed of three
other men picked by Captain
Grubbs. In the semi-finals played
off yesterday Jim and Bob Fuller
ton's teams were victorious and will
meet each other in the final game to
be played at 3 o'clock Friday on the
highway polo field.
