### PHIL KLAUBER 
I Eight hundred miles of free trav
el will be at stake on Angell Field
j this afternoon as Dink Templeton's
| trackmen run through time trials |
i competing for places on the 15-man
; squad that will enter the conference
| meet in Los Angeles Saturday.
Several of those to go, of course,
l are well established in the minds of
j both Templeton and the interested
: public; but a few of those on the
! fringe will be determined this after
! noon.
Stanford at present has about an
' even chance to win, according to
! those dopesters who already are at
work. U.S.C. and Washington State
j seem to be the only others to threat
| en the team championship; the Tro
jans are defending champions. Cali
fornia will be especially hard put
Saturday because school has dis
missed and most of her athletes have
finished the year's competition.
Events to be held, contrary to last
year when such things as the 400-
meter hurdles were run in at the
meet in Berkeley, will be straight
stuff — standard distances measured
in yards, and a 4-man mile relay.
Scoring will be 5-3-2-1.
The relay again should be a class

ic, with the Stanford team which has
turned in two races under 3:13 al
ready this year up against the
Washington State quartet who are
new record holders in the northern
division meet, and who were first in
their event at the Drake Relays a
month ago.
