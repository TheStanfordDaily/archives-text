# Still Getting Ready, Folks

### 
Board of Athletic Control
Gentlemen:
THIS is to inform you that unless someone
postpones your meeting again, there will
be a get-together of the Board Thursday night,
when you will bull over Angell Field and the
bleachers it doesn't have.
We've been writing a lot of edits about this
thing, and we could say more today, but to tell
the truth, gentlemen, it's getting tiresome.
However, you might keep in mind last Sat
urday's successful P.A.A. meet and fast times
some of those lads turned in—times that would
have been miraculous in the stadium wind
chute.
Someone has said it was the "best meet on
the Coast this year," and allowing for a slight
stretch of the point, it still is obvious that all of
Stanford's meets should be held on "the fastest
track in the West."
It's easy to go hog wild on a typewriter, you
say, without worrying about the money. But,
gentlemen, when the B.A.C. actually sees a
need, it usually can find the money, even if
Dink Templeton's suggestion of a University
loan must be the answer.
We all know that sooner or later the bleacher
appropriation will go through. It's part of the
athletic building plan. And if the "kids" don't
scream loud enough this year, there will be
another group who'll be bawling next season,
and the next.
One of these days you'll have to swing it to
quiet 'em down.
A couple of years ago the Angell Field track
plant was rebuilt into one of the finest any
where. You know because you did it.
But before that plant becomes outmoded, the
bleachers must be put around it. Each year
of procrastination is a year of lost competition
for the "best track in the West."
Now here's something you ought to know,
but for Pete's sake don't let it out.
A1 Masters will tell you apologetically Thurs
day night that the foundation for bleachers
was graded when the track was built. He'll
apologize for doing it, because it wasn't part
of the actual track building. He probably also
will swing on us for slipping you the word.
And Don Liebendorfer won't like it either be
cause we expose his expectancy by this quite
confidential tip. You see, Don was inquiring
among the sport scribes in the press box Sat
urday whether they would rather have the
press box high or low, just in case you decide
to build bleachers. Just in case.
So everything is set, gentlemen. See you
Thursday night.
Sincerely,
—G. F.
