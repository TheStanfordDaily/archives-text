# "Dear Grenadine —"
## 
### 
WE are beginning to wonder if there isn't
something in this grade system after all.
You see, we take Current Events.
Almost 400 of us eat a heavy lunch every
Thursday, then stroll over to the Assembly Hall
for an afternoon siesta. For doing this, our re
ports at the end of the quarter show an addi
tional one unit. A short paper, which we wrote
two years ago for Citizenship anyway, deter
mines whether or not we pass.
Current Events is really education for edu
cation's sake. It's there. We can take it or leave
it. If we don't care to hear about the burly
Basque fisherwomen and the Spanish war, we
can finish that letter to sister Grenadine in
Horsefalls about the Kappas' burlesque show.
There isn't, you see, a midquarter or a final.
We have always thought that higher educa
tion would never be really "high" until the
Administration quit the grade system. We've
argued that grades made education a competi
tive sport, like pole vaulting or the 100-yard
dash.
Then, when the Administration gave us a test
with this course without grades, well—here are
tlio figures tabulated by two gentlemen looking

down on the class from the balcony last Thurs
day afternoon:
Of 199 students sitting on one side of the
Assembly Hall that day—
68 were reading the New Yorker, Coming of
Age in Samoa, etc.
27 were catching up on the night-before's
sleep.
5 were writing letters.
3 were playing cards.
2 were kibitzing.
4 were knitting.
2 were arguing back and forth from row "L"
to row "N."
And the remaining 88 were, to a degree, try
ing to hear'the lecturer through a defective
public-address system.
Incidentally, Grenadine, Current Events isn't
listed in the new fall quarter Time Schedule.—
