# OUR HASHER
## 
### 
AFTER the fearful set-back faced by the hashing
profession this year with the abortive Sit-Down
and -Shut-up Strike, it gives Our Hasher ecstatic
pleasure to announce, in the next-to-last Hasher for
ever column, of the gradual lifting of the hashing head
above the mire and gravy stains, of! the neck.
The new drive for social recognition will be con
summated tomorrow night, when the first All-Univer
sity Hashers' Exchange Dinner takes place at the Pi
Phi and Chi Omega houses, on the cuff.
Though the exchange was originally scheduled for
a three-way trade with the Delta Gamma hashboys,
the five-seconds-in-every-hour men were forced to
scale down their grandiose plans, when the D.G. head
hashing tiger man got cold pause that refreshes.
Official statement from the tiger man is that the
D.G. hashing force is happy where it is, but according
to The Daily's recent series, the Encina hashers are
happy where they are, too, so I guess you just don't
know what to think these days.
However, I shouldn't air these petty differences in
the face of this tremendous forward step on the back
steps. News that hashers can have exchange dinners,
too, will be greeted with a shout by such philosophers
of social equality as Chef Jeremy F. Wong, who will
undoubtedly shout: "Pi Phi-Chi O hashboy bumboy
allatime stealum oppul, talk to girl, drinkum too much,
get off my feet you big bum," and I am sure that this
hashers' fete will mean a new Declaration of Independ
ence, with resultant repercussions throughout the in
dustry.
Vf/'HILE we are in the kitchenworn department, it
" would be well to wind up with a story emanating
from the kitchery of one of my old timers, Jin Jack,
cook and counselor of the Sigma Chi house and wild
west dance. Jin Jack previously figured in my column
under the phonetic spelling of Jean Jack. The new
spelling, however, is official.
Well, to make a short story long, Jin Jack has sec
ond-boy whose name, according to the official spelling,
is Jin Bin.
Jin Bin, according to the custom of campus
yellow churnalists which is sanctioned by the approval
of Buddha and the Nanking Government, left on the
train one Sunday night for the weekly funfest on
Grant Avenue.
After the fest was over, Jin climbed on the S.P.'s
theater special and fell to sleep, waking up when the
train stopped at San Jose. Since his finances had been
depleted by the granting on the avenue, he had to get
out on the highway and walk home, arriving at 5:00 in
the morning, just in time to peel the spuds and grease
the pans for the next day's Sigma Chis.
Next timec, try the busee, mebbe?

Vf/'HILE we are in the kitchenworn department, it
" would be well to wind up with a story emanating
from the kitchery of one of my old timers, Jin Jack,
cook and counselor of the Sigma Chi house and wild
west dance. Jin Jack previously figured in my column
under the phonetic spelling of Jean Jack. The new
spelling, however, is official.
Well, to make a short story long, Jin Jack has sec
ond-boy whose name, according to the official spelling,
is Jin Bin.
Jin Bin, according to the custom of campus
yellow churnalists which is sanctioned by the approval
of Buddha and the Nanking Government, left on the
train one Sunday night for the weekly funfest on
Grant Avenue.
After the fest was over, Jin climbed on the S.P.'s
theater special and fell to sleep, waking up when the
train stopped at San Jose. Since his finances had been
depleted by the granting on the avenue, he had to get
out on the highway and walk home, arriving at 5:00 in
the morning, just in time to peel the spuds and grease
the pans for the next day's Sigma Chis.
Next timec, try the busee, mebbe?
AFTER the fearful set-back faced by the hashing
profession this year with the abortive Sit-Down
and -Shut-up Strike, it gives Our Hasher ecstatic
pleasure to announce, in the next-to-last Hasher for
ever column, of the gradual lifting of the hashing head
above the mire and gravy stains, of! the neck.
The new drive for social recognition will be con
summated tomorrow night, when the first All-Univer
sity Hashers' Exchange Dinner takes place at the Pi
Phi and Chi Omega houses, on the cuff.
Though the exchange was originally scheduled for
a three-way trade with the Delta Gamma hashboys,
the five-seconds-in-every-hour men were forced to
scale down their grandiose plans, when the D.G. head
hashing tiger man got cold pause that refreshes.
Official statement from the tiger man is that the
D.G. hashing force is happy where it is, but according
to The Daily's recent series, the Encina hashers are
happy where they are, too, so I guess you just don't
know what to think these days.
However, I shouldn't air these petty differences in
the face of this tremendous forward step on the back
steps. News that hashers can have exchange dinners,
too, will be greeted with a shout by such philosophers
of social equality as Chef Jeremy F. Wong, who will
undoubtedly shout: "Pi Phi-Chi O hashboy bumboy
allatime stealum oppul, talk to girl, drinkum too much,
get off my feet you big bum," and I am sure that this
hashers' fete will mean a new Declaration of Independ
ence, with resultant repercussions throughout the in
dustry.
