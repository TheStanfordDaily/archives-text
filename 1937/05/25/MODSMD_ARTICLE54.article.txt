COUTTEY EXTERMINATION
WHEN The Daily announced yesterday that it
planned to run a series of articles on the Farm's
legendary figure, Peter Coutts, Stanford felt a vague
irritation in its collective bosom. Most of us experi
enced that resentment that comes when a meddler
pins us down and spoils our best story.
Stanford is very self-conscious about its traditions.
One sure way to bring out the savage in the
undergraduate is to tell him of the ivied walls and
hallowed legends of dear old Harvard or Yale.

Stanford's not-so-Romanesque architecture is not
adapted to ivy, and an annoying amount of docu
mentary evidence makes myths very hard to comc by.
Sensitive on this point, the Farm has worked indus
triously to build up tradition. Naturally it feels an
noyed when someone starts hunting for facts.
None of us know why we prize our scanty stock of
legend so highly. For some reason our colleges feel
naked unless they are cloaked wtih a mass of myths.
None seem to realize that they can get along very
nicely without legends. Few realize that a vast amount
of American educational tradition is actually harmful.

'ITIE idea of formal presentation strangles half of the
courses presented today. The stimulation of per
sonal contact of student and instructor is lost. Under
graduates can take course after course under sonic pro
fessor without ever finding out what he really thinks.
Instead they are given a series of formal lecturcs—no
more informative or thought-provoking than the aver
age textbook.
Another glorious tradition that is chewing gum on
the heel of education is that of "logical development."
When he takes up a course, the student is subjected
to months of work on the most elementary principles.
He is forced to memorize useless names. He is exam
ined on whether the Fussencuss theory holds that
children should be spanked with a hair brush or with
a razor strop.
When undergraduates howl, professors reply sweet
ly that they must "learn the fundamentals." They con
veniently forget that such "fundamentals" are either
useless, or are known to the most moronic ditch
diggcr.

STANFORD is a young college. It lacks ivied walls,
k haunted bridges, and rooms where General What
ellssisname spent a night. Unfortunately, it has taken
over much of the aged-in-wood tradition that stifles
education. Instead of trying to improve the defects
in the educational system, we strive for them.
We want tradition so badly that we take any sort.
The West needs a liberal university. Just now it
seems to feel that blind conservatism, tradition wor
ship, is aristocratic and cultured. Liberalism in the
colleges would help to counteract this.
# * * *
If Stanford forgets tradition, and concentrates on
improving education, the legends will take care of
themselves. We can create a tradition of liberalism
that will be than any myth about a Frenchman.
