Don't let dust and dirt damage your typewriter this
summer. FREE STORAGE may be had for the asking at
the typewriter department of the Bookstore.
And if any adjusting, cleaning, oiling or repairing is
needed you can count on us to do it as it should be done.
If you're taking your typewriter with you this summer,
let us service it before you leave.
