### ANNALEE WHITMORE 
Designed to lessen the Hall-Row gap, a new Axe Society, composed not
of "big shots, but of good guys who have accomplished something," was
tentatively approved at last night's Ex Committee meeting.
Chick Franich, Jack Clark, John Dcrn, J eel) llalahy. Grant Stone, Bud
Milligan, and other sizeable representatives filed in. "We're only a part
of the organization," they explained. An explanatory letter asked for rec-

ognition, stating that "The
can be wielded behind any of the
multiple problems facing the cam
pus, and by its inherent prestige push
them to a logical conclusion."
Not over 15 members from either
Hall or Row may be chosen at any
one time, from the total membership
of 25. Dr. Harold Hand, Dr. Harry
Rathbun, and John Bunn will act as
udvLsers. Final approval will be i
granted at next week's Ex Commit- j
lec swan song, subject to Dr. Wil- j
bur's sanction.

showing of motion pictures next
year, will 'be named next week. In
terested students may sign up at

Definite possibility of having about
20 showings of outstanding old and
foreign pictures was seen, according
to Fred Williams. The administra
tion, he says, stresses the educa
tional ,side. "I prefer a couple of
Mickey Mouses," interpolated Jim
Reynolds.

fornia. Ex Committee opposed any j
alteration of these rules.

poned for a year.
