# Chaplain Talks At Lunch Club
## Trueblood Is Speaker At Final Meeting Today 
### 
Concluding the series of meetings j
of the Luncheon Club for the spring
quarter, Dr. D. Elton Trueblood will
speak on "Stanford in the Eyes of a
Convert." Dr. Trueblood's talk will |
deal with Stanford as he has seen it I
in this year, his first here.
The Luncheon Club was started
winter quarter by Dr. Trueblood to j
fill a need which he felt was present.
It has offered speakers who were of ;
interest to the student, and, to a 1
large degree, suggested by them.
Such men of the faculty of Pro- ;
fessor Elmer Fagan, Professor E. M.
Hulme, President Ray Lyman Wil- !
bur, Paul Hanna, Dean Mary Yost,
and Professor Lee Bassett have ad- I
dressed the club. Other speakers in
cluded Dr. Gardner, chaplain emer- :
itus, Jim Hill and Jim Reynolds, |
Harry Rimmer, and Dr. F. Griffen. |
Mothers' Club has sent two women i
to provide flowers, serve, and set ;
tables for each lunch. The club will |
continue throughout next year, j
starting soon after school opens.
