# Fontius Outlines Year's Objective
## 
### 
A more general student knowl
edge of rules regarding dances and
student funds is among Chuck Fon
tius' objectives for his second year
as graduate manager.
In order to halt the confusion
often experienced in the past, Fon
tius plans to consolidate and distrib
ute the important rules on these
subjects â€” perhaps publish them in
the pre-reg edition of The Daily next
fall.
"There has always been more or
| less confusion," said Fontius
I "'about the number of complimentary
\ bids for dances, and also about the
' granting of dates."
Although most of this material can
j be found now in the Frosh Hand
| book, Fontius pointed out that no
I one pays much attention to the long
list of rules printed there. Misun
derstandings also arise often in con
nection with the Students' Organi
| zation Fund. Many of the students
Ido not understand the process of
gbtting requisitions for student body
expenditures.
