(iLNEVA, May 25 (U.R).â€”Emperor
Hallo Selassie I, ejected from Ethio
pia by Italy a year ago, sent a note
to the League of Nations today ad
vising that he was not sending a
delegation to the League Assembly,
of which Ethiopia still is a recog
nized member despite Italy's objec
tions.
Italy had threatened to withdraw
from the League if it continued to
recognize Ethiopia as a sovereign
member.
