# Three Frosh Receive Hours Tor Stealing
## Men's Council Punishes 'High School Behavior'; Driver Loses License 
### 
Three freshmen were called before
yesterday's session of Men's Council
and fined 40 hours of work at the
Convalescent Home for stealing signs
near Woodside. The work must be
complete before they register at
Stanford next autumn.
"This conduct," says Bill Quade,
"has got to stop. High-school con
duct on the part of freshmen can
not be tolerated. When they come
to Stanford, it is time for them to
start a four-year career as a gen
tleman."
"There has been a good deal of
complaint," he continues, "about
students stealing many small things
.such as signs and lanterns."
Another student was arraigned on
a charge of negligent driving which
resulted in serious injury to an
occupant of the car he was driving.
His license was suspended for the
remainder of the quarter and he
was fined $5.00 with the under
standing thut his license would be
revoked if he were not careful here
after.
Men's Council Chairman Bill
Quade asks that all the students be
particularly scrupulous about the
Honor Code rules.
