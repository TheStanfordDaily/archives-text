# Coutts' Tunnels Sought Water, Not Sanctuary
## 
### HUNTER HENDEE JOHN RICE 
First tale campus newcomers hear |
about "that .eccentric old French- j
man" is how he dug two miles of j
, tunnel with his own hands from his j
mansion to an impregnable tower i
| hidden away in the woods.
That was so he could escape when j
whoever was coming after him came. |
Old issues of Sequoia, early Farm |
: "lit" book, carry gripping accounts
1 of how, when that fatal day arrived, j
; Peter Coutts tucked his lovely mis- |
j tress and his two children away in <
a secret chamber deep in the heart of !
; Mystery Hill.
Suffocated
And then the door slammed on j
| him and he lost the key and the j
' gophers filled up the air vents he !

had previously constructed; and so
they were all buried alive until some
Stanfordite dug up their skeletons
and thereby established tradition.
Unquestionably all that makes for
splendid literature. But it hardly
does justice to the memory of Peter
Coutts, a man whose love for trees
and lakes and waterfalls has made
the Farm a far more fascinating
place in which to live.
Truth need not wreck the tradi
tion of Peter Coutts—he is tradi
tional enough without the "romance"
of murder and embezzlement and
dare-devil escapes.
Sought River
His tunnels, like the Roman sys
tems alter which they were pat
terned, sought an underground river
which Coutts hoped would flood his
lakes and irrigate his estate. Men
burrowed them day and night for
two years, found no river, gaw it
/ r-\ ± • 1 A \
up as a bad job.
Perhaps Coutts originally plan
ned a tunnel from his tower on Mata
dero Creek to his artificial lake at
the foot of Mystery Hill, purpose
being to direct the creek into the
lake. The tunnel, however, got only
100 yards in that direction.
The doorless brick tower, unscal
able and weird, is just one more ex
ample of Coutts' love for the me
dieval and the picturesque. Un
questionably it was intended as a
water tower, the tank to be inside.
Planned Pump
Coutts planned to pump water
from the creek up into the tower,
and from there send it either by

pipes or underground tunnel to gar
dens somewhere near the lake.
Coutts was undecided as to where
he would build his castle-mansion.
At first it was to be atop Mystery
Hill, and he covered the hill with
trees and built a roadway, still dis
cernible from Mayfxeld Road, lead
ing to the summit.
However, when building began it
was on Sigma Nu-Delt hill that
foundations were laid. The mansion
was never completed, for Coutts'
sudden departure from Stanford
land followad shortly afterward.
Family Settled
That Coutts should be more con
cerned, with his tunnels than his me
dieval mansion is understandable.
The family was perfectly comfort
able for the time being in Escondite
Cottage. And to Coutts finding of
water supply so that the estate might
grow green and tree-covered as soon
as possible was of first importance.
Tomorrow's article will present
some of Coutts' ececntricities and
an account of his stock
home of the best blooded cattle in
the territory.
