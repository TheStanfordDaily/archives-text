THE COMPETITION in the N. C.
A. A. half-mile is really going to be
tough this year, if the entry list
means anything.
Long John Woodruff, the colored
Olympic champion at 800 meters
from the University of Pittsburgh,
will probably run, and it's quite
likely he'll be the favorite. He
won't have any cinch, though, be
cause Charley Beetham of Ohio
State is also going to be in the event,
and he is N.C.A.A. champ from last
year, at 1:53.0.
When you put those two on a
track alongside of Vic Palmason,
Ross Bush, and Bill McCurdy, you
have the makin's of a pretty good
race.
OHIO STATE will have the strong
est single delegation in the race,
for with Beetham will come two
others who have done 1:53.4 and
1:53.5 this year so far. Not only
that, but they look for one of them,
a lad by the name of Dick Squires,
to do 1:52 by the end of the season.
Just think, three men from one
.sc+iool who can crack 1:54 in the
half. Ohio State ought to find one
more man who can run around the
track twice and really go after that
world's four-man, two-mile relay
record.
JUST TO GET AWAY from track
for a shake, let's weep a few tears
for poor Maxie Schmeling.
He came over here almost a year
ago and made a grand fight to trim
Joe Louis, a fight that should have
put him in line for a title go with
Braddock, but is he going to get it?
Well, unless this is one of the finest
build-ups in a long, long time, there
will be no Schmeling - Braddock
fight.
Louis and Braddock have both
gone into' training, and ticket sales
have started for their fight, so it
certainly looks like the McCoy.
Schmeling came over just the same
and began a training siege not so
long ago—he even had a contract to
show he was going to fight the
champ—but it looks as though he is
going to be left in the cold.
THE PRIDE of Germany deserves
a lot of credit for winning from
Louis, because he figured out a way
to stop the ebony rhapsody of mo
tion, and he certainly should have his
chance before Louis gets his. At
that, it's very doubtful whether Max
could stop the Irishman in a title
light, because Braddock's left is the
ideal defense against Schmeling's
vicious l'ight, but he ought at least
to have his chance.
Another thing, Max beat Louis,
but he'll have a very hard time to
do it again. He hit the Bomber as he
was floating along, trying Maxie out,
and the punch so unnerved the negro
that he never got over it. The next
time they fight, if and when, Louis
will come out to give Schmeling the
toughest first round he will ever
have experienced, and if he gets
through that one he'll throw every
thing he has at the German for an
other round, and another, if neces
sary.
Schmeling on the defensive is not
a very impressive fighter, and he
can't stop every one of Louis'
punches with his elbows.
SOMEBODY must want pretty
much to keep the title in this coun
try, or something, because Schme
ling is getting a plenty raw deal.
And when you stop to think that he
had a bona fide contract that is just
being disregarded, something begins
to stink in Copenhagen. Ah, well,
such are the ways of these New
York fight promoters. How they do
go on!

Joe Louis, a fight that should have
put him in line for a title go with
Braddock, but is he going to get it?
Well, unless this is one of the finest
build-ups in a long, long time, there
will be no Schmeling - Braddock
fight.
Louis and Braddock have both
gone into' training, and ticket sales
have started for their fight, so it
certainly looks like the McCoy.
Schmeling came over just the same
and began a training siege not so
long ago—he even had a contract to
show he was going to fight the
champ—but it looks as though he is
going to be left in the cold.
THE PRIDE of Germany deserves
a lot of credit for winning from
Louis, because he figured out a way
to stop the ebony rhapsody of mo
tion, and he certainly should have his
chance before Louis gets his. At
that, it's very doubtful whether Max
could stop the Irishman in a title
light, because Braddock's left is the
ideal defense against Schmeling's
vicious l'ight, but he ought at least
to have his chance.
Another thing, Max beat Louis,
but he'll have a very hard time to
do it again. He hit the Bomber as he
was floating along, trying Maxie out,
and the punch so unnerved the negro
that he never got over it. The next
time they fight, if and when, Louis
will come out to give Schmeling the
toughest first round he will ever
have experienced, and if he gets
through that one he'll throw every
thing he has at the German for an
other round, and another, if neces
sary.
Schmeling on the defensive is not
a very impressive fighter, and he
can't stop every one of Louis'
punches with his elbows.
SOMEBODY must want pretty
much to keep the title in this coun
try, or something, because Schme
ling is getting a plenty raw deal.
And when you stop to think that he
had a bona fide contract that is just
being disregarded, something begins
to stink in Copenhagen. Ah, well,
such are the ways of these New
York fight promoters. How they do
go on!

THE COMPETITION in the N. C.
A. A. half-mile is really going to be
tough this year, if the entry list
means anything.
Long John Woodruff, the colored
Olympic champion at 800 meters
from the University of Pittsburgh,
will probably run, and it's quite
likely he'll be the favorite. He
won't have any cinch, though, be
cause Charley Beetham of Ohio
State is also going to be in the event,
and he is N.C.A.A. champ from last
year, at 1:53.0.
When you put those two on a
track alongside of Vic Palmason,
Ross Bush, and Bill McCurdy, you
have the makin's of a pretty good
race.
OHIO STATE will have the strong
est single delegation in the race,
for with Beetham will come two
others who have done 1:53.4 and
1:53.5 this year so far. Not only
that, but they look for one of them,
a lad by the name of Dick Squires,
to do 1:52 by the end of the season.
Just think, three men from one
.sc+iool who can crack 1:54 in the
half. Ohio State ought to find one
more man who can run around the
track twice and really go after that
world's four-man, two-mile relay
record.
JUST TO GET AWAY from track
for a shake, let's weep a few tears
for poor Maxie Schmeling.
