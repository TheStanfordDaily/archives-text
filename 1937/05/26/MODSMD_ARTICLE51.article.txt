# Burrows Hits Season's Peak In Workouts
## Trackmen Hold Tryouts For Conference Meet; Oregon Drops Entries 
### 
Edson Burrows, lanky letterman
two-miler who suffered a broken
leg last lall, finally reached his
previous form yesterday after
months of slow work up from the
bottom.
Ed, in trials to see whet Tier or not
he was good enough for the trip to
the Conference track meet in Los
Angeles this week-end, turned in a
9:34.9 for 8-laps, a stride ahead of
Bob Alexander for the best at the
distance for either of them this
year. Burrows will make the trip.
Other developments went on;
Oregon yesterday decided not to
make the trip south because of con
flicts with final exams, and imme
diately the shot, discus, and pole
vauit became changed tales. George
Varofl' former world record holder,
and Foskett and Holland, winners in
the weight events at Seattle last
week, will not make the trip. Fos
kett threw 49-6V4, Holland 148-6%.
Burrows' record is not his best;
he ran 9:25.3 in practice last year,
but yesterday's race is still under
the Stanford record of 9:35.1 set by
Hank Coe in 1928.
Shot-put trials were held yester
day with Reynolds leading at 50 feet
and both Montgomery and Hershey
at 48. Other trials were postponed
because of a small tornado that
was whipping back and forth on the
track, and will be held today, after
which Stanford's 15 entrants will be
announced.
Carl Mahurin, 880 man, may auto
matically be left home, as he turned
up yesterday with a cramped leg
that kept him out of a suit.
