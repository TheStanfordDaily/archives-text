# Dear Dave:

IT'S hardly necessary to make apology for
writing the traditional "Dear " edit to you.
Shall we say only this: that sportsmanship be
came a reality after three o'clock yesterday,
when Frost won the post that both of you had
worked for for three years.
That The Daily is at best a silly business is
evident to us. What we so proudly hail as a
newspaper each midnight cannot be what we
call it, nor can it be a saccharine house-organ.
We hope that truth is evident to you, a com
fort, so far as can it be, to balance the staggering
blow.
Though in the famous words "The world will
not long remember what we say here," we sus
pect that many will long remember what you
have v/ritten in these columns. Through Vol
ume 92, a minute in Stanford's hour, as a man
and as copy you have been above par; to es
tablish the fact—one oasis in the Sahara.
To see you go is no discredit to you, rather, it
is an exposition of the deficiency in a system,
like all systems, a classical deficiency.
It is somewhat disconcerting to see so Ro
tarian an ideal as sportsmanship suddenly come
to mean something. Particularly so, since col
lege is the time when so-called "ideals" are
cast off for so-called "facts." How awful it is
when the abused word - symbols for "good
things" suddenly gain full meaning is an event
you can only imagine, since you have made
the event.
The symbol you symbolize is a word that has
lost meaning through repetition by the wrong
people.
Through you, we realize that the word
"sportsmanship" is still good; that it seems bad
only because it is repeated by the repetitious.
This, you will realize, is disruptive to the
apeingly professional routine of word-slinging
by which day-to-day college editors live and
die.
There are many people who do not know this.
They will say this editorial is garbage, which it
undoubtedly is—to them. All I can say is—
I have finally seen something which I cannot
put into words. It is most amazing—to me.
