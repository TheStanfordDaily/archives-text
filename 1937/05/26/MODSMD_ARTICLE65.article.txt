# Art for Life's Sake
## 
### 
TIME was when art was something that existed
in dusty European galleries, the sort of thing
the girls were interested in largely because it
stayed in one place and didn't require the lifting
of long skirts.
In those days, an artist was one who lived
a life of art, apart from a world that was con
sidered inartistic. And those who appreciated
him were suspected of being worthless dream
ers, sometimes more vicious than that.
This stereotype has not passed with Victo
rianism. There are men in the high places today
who expect an artist to wear a bow-tie and a
slouch hat, and to drink himself to death.
Which makes William Irvine's course in Art
Appreciation something not only new, but radi
cally and daringly different.
He doesn't intend to teach art. He intends to
have his students learn it. For art, he realizes,
is life itself—so deeply a part of the modern con
sciousness that'appreciation is part of the equip
ment of civilized man.
The kind of art he's going to study is as dif
ferent as his method of studying it. Not old
masters, interpreted to death, but the movies,
gardening, fine books, modern architecture—
the kind of art that we come to grips with every
day, but seldom embrace.
Fitting in admirably with President Wilbur's
projected School of the Fine Arts, the new
course should do more than open jaded eyes
in a boring way to well-known professional
objects of beauty.
It should instead tune the human mind sharp
ly to the beauty of the living, working world,
and give life a new fullness—as a fine radio
recreates a symphony orchestra.
