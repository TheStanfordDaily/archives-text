WHEN a Republican admits he's done for,
the world should shake and the heavens
fall.
The fact that a veteran Southern Kansas Re
publican leader said just that Monday, and his
statement rated only a caption in most papers,
is indicative more of the loss of a great national
characteristic rather than the practice of con
scious indifference by a deadline-ridden press.
If the history books are right, the prescription
for national success is inter - party conflict.
Through the years, America seems to have
grown fat while squeezed between the locked
horns of political bulls.
And now the bull is wandering around the
paddock, with not even a red flannel in sight,

and only a few reds.
At least that is the present state of affairs
according to R. C. Howard, who harangued 'em
back in the days when Bryan crossed 'em.
He suggests that the Republican Party retire
as gracefully as possible and "get behind some
outstanding Democrat to offer effective oppo
sition to the New Deal forces."
If what Mr. Howard says is true, and if the
historical prescription is accurate, America is
hell-bent for the elections of 1940, but for
a particular kind of impotence.
For unless the Republicans rally, or unless
a new party is coalesced out of the remnants
of last November, America will find itself in the
position of approving without arguing, suffer
ing thereby a national suppression almost
Freudian in its ronsequences.
Mr. Howard, himself, is symptomatic of this
national anaemia. He bespeaks a national de
cline, in so far as he is admitting many things
besides his own failure. He confesses, by his
Spring-timed statement, that his boys are so
lulled to sleep with New Deal soporifics that
they have no fight left.
That is bad politics and bad publicity. Mr.
Howard's statement will be a confession that
many people consider New Deal measures
good. To those on the fence, it will indicate
that even Republicans think they are good.
This is bad, but typically Republican in a
"Roosevelt" year.
