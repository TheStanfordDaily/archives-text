r r , HERE once was a girl at Stanford. She said she
was a Chi O. She sometimes went out Saturday
nights. She liked a man very well, and he likewised
her. But he went away to study at Harvard. So she
went out occasionally Saturday nights with a man
named John. And the man's name at Harvard was
James and he was her Joe.
At 8:15 one night, she got a telephone call, and the
callee said Hello dear, how are you? and whispered
sweet nothings in her ears.
And she said why John you shouldn't say things
like that what with me wearing Jim's pin and all. And
the callee replied But this is Jim. And she said where
are you. And he said: I'm in Cambridge will you
marry me? She said, Sure, why not?
/"kNE day an express wagon and a driver drove up
in front of a house on the Row and debouched the
driver and travelling companion onto the sidewalk.
They went around back of the truck and lifted two
big cases out and carried them up to the front of the
house, where they went in the main door.
Now on the outside of these cartons was the single
word Champagne which carries definite connotations,
and the bottles clinked inside.
In a few minutes they came back clinking the
bottles in the cases. And then they put the cases in
the truck with themselves and the truck drove off
and the house needs its face lifted.'
jVTOW that the theater is nearly finished and pol
ished, it is mete and right that the senior class
should do some little thing to give it a good send-off.
They will see the inside on June 12, but we can see
the outside now. Stanford's new theater is here, but
there seems to be a little left to pay for.
There are ways and ways to do something to the
exterior, but my little plan would accomplish two
things, provide an income for the future payments. I
feel that the senior class could sell all the space on
the long yellow walls for advertising purposes. As I
stand now on the west side, looking east, there is a
definite something indefinitely lacking. Think, now,
how a lingeree ad would look, or even a Real Estate
Agent's name and telephone number.

Now on the outside of these cartons was the single
word Champagne which carries definite connotations,
and the bottles clinked inside.
In a few minutes they came back clinking the
bottles in the cases. And then they put the cases in
the truck with themselves and the truck drove off
and the house needs its face lifted.'
jVTOW that the theater is nearly finished and pol
ished, it is mete and right that the senior class
should do some little thing to give it a good send-off.
They will see the inside on June 12, but we can see
the outside now. Stanford's new theater is here, but
there seems to be a little left to pay for.
There are ways and ways to do something to the
exterior, but my little plan would accomplish two
things, provide an income for the future payments. I
feel that the senior class could sell all the space on
the long yellow walls for advertising purposes. As I
stand now on the west side, looking east, there is a
definite something indefinitely lacking. Think, now,
how a lingeree ad would look, or even a Real Estate
Agent's name and telephone number.
