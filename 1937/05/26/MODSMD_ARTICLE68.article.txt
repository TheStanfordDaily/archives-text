THE LIONS AND THE MICE
IT IS one of the delicate ironies of American educa
tion that students and faculty have about as many
common interests as a Christian martyr and a lion.
They come in contact with each other, and the pro
fessor makes his living out of the contact, like the lion,
but there is no companionship, no exchange of ideas.
Supposedly, undergraduate and teacher co-operate
closely in the task of instilling education and "culture."
But in practice, the lecture platform prevents any
real contact.
It is literally true in our universities that one half
doesn't know how the other lives. Some of the pro
fessors say that what with salary cuts and depres
sions, they don't know how they live themselves. But
even if they have solved their own problems, the in
structors don't understand the students. And the un
dergraduates understand neither the professors nor the
assignments.

Stanford typifies this. When the freshman is first
taken under the wing of dear alma mater, he is
handed over to a faculty "adviser." Amid the shouting
and the tumult that is registration, he is carefully
guided through the machinery of "make all checks
payable to Stanford University." After that he is
alone in the wide, wide Ad Building lobby.
Making up his program by the Time Schedule, he
fights his way through the mob scene to get it signed,
and then staggers back to Encina. This is his only
personal contact with the faculty until the next regis
tration riot.
Throughout his college course, the students meet
professors only when their term papers are late, or
when the grade point market takes a slump.
At no time is there any opportunity for compan
ionship or friendly discussion.
* * * #
STANFORD is over-run with cultured and brilliant
men; which is very nice. But brilliance and cul
ture arc like a kiss; they must be shared before they
are worth anything. The theory of education is that
professor will share his knowledge with student, re
ceiving in return insight into the undergraduate mind.
But culture withers away in the musty air of the
lecture room; and brilliance is dimmed in the dark
caves of the Quad. Similarly, the instructor gets very
little insight from a class of drowsy note-takers.
With such a set-up it is hardly cause for amaze
ment that professors are called "theoretical" and "im
practical." In the students they have a perfect chance
to observe a cross section of humanity; but they ignore
it. Nor is it surprising that our college graduates are
often considered uncultured and uneducated. Fre
quently our universities give them little more than a
verbal correspondence course.
Student-faculty contact is probably the most im
portant single phase of education. And in this feature,
American colleges are sadly deficient.

With such a set-up it is hardly cause for amaze
ment that professors are called "theoretical" and "im
practical." In the students they have a perfect chance
to observe a cross section of humanity; but they ignore
it. Nor is it surprising that our college graduates are
often considered uncultured and uneducated. Fre
quently our universities give them little more than a
verbal correspondence course.
Student-faculty contact is probably the most im

THE LIONS AND THE MICE
IT IS one of the delicate ironies of American educa
tion that students and faculty have about as many
common interests as a Christian martyr and a lion.
They come in contact with each other, and the pro
fessor makes his living out of the contact, like the lion,
but there is no companionship, no exchange of ideas.
Supposedly, undergraduate and teacher co-operate
closely in the task of instilling education and "culture."
But in practice, the lecture platform prevents any
real contact.
It is literally true in our universities that one half
doesn't know how the other lives. Some of the pro
fessors say that what with salary cuts and depres
sions, they don't know how they live themselves. But
even if they have solved their own problems, the in
structors don't understand the students. And the un
dergraduates understand neither the professors nor the
assignments.

Stanford typifies this. When the freshman is first
taken under the wing of dear alma mater, he is
handed over to a faculty "adviser." Amid the shouting
and the tumult that is registration, he is carefully
guided through the machinery of "make all checks
payable to Stanford University." After that he is
alone in the wide, wide Ad Building lobby.
Making up his program by the Time Schedule, he
fights his way through the mob scene to get it signed,
and then staggers back to Encina. This is his only
personal contact with the faculty until the next regis
tration riot.
Throughout his college course, the students meet
professors only when their term papers are late, or
when the grade point market takes a slump.
At no time is there any opportunity for compan
ionship or friendly discussion.

STANFORD is over-run with cultured and brilliant
men; which is very nice. But brilliance and cul
ture arc like a kiss; they must be shared before they
are worth anything. The theory of education is that
professor will share his knowledge with student, re
ceiving in return insight into the undergraduate mind.
But culture withers away in the musty air of the
lecture room; and brilliance is dimmed in the dark
caves of the Quad. Similarly, the instructor gets very
little insight from a class of drowsy note-takers.
With such a set-up it is hardly cause for amaze
ment that professors are called "theoretical" and "im
practical." In the students they have a perfect chance
to observe a cross section of humanity; but they ignore
it. Nor is it surprising that our college graduates are
