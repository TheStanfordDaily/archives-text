# German Swastika Torn from Bridge
## 
### 
A German swastika flag was rip
ped from its place in Golden Gate
Bridge Celebration decorations on
San Francisco's Market Street last
night by a gang of black-clad, un
identified men.
Earlier in the day, Mayor Rossi
refused petitions demanding remov
al of the German flag, presented by
a committee styling itself as repre
senting "organized labor groups
against Naziism and friends of
democracy."
