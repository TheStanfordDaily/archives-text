# Bluffing Diplomacy Called War Threat
## 
### 
The chief danger of a world war
in the coming months will come
from a smaller war, Professor Hugh
McDowell Clokie declared at the an
nual banquet of the Stanford chap
ter of Pi Sigma Alpha, national hon
orary political science fraternity, held
last night at Bertrand's.
International diplomacy was
likened to "a poker game of 15 or
20 players, with some of them hold
ing blank cards," by Professor Clokie.
"The danger will come from a slip,
when someone calls a bluff â€” and
then we will have the same disaster
occurring as in 1914."
James Eldon Fields was elected
president! for the coming year of the
local fraternity at the meeting last
night.
