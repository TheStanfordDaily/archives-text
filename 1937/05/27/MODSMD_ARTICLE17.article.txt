# Packed Nitery Sees Saga of 'Little Nell'
## Melodrama Punctuated By Cat-Calls 
### HERB ALWARD 
With the Nitery packed to the no
standing-room-left condition, "Little
Nell and the free punch gave the
i new campus night spot its official
opening in a big way last night.
To the accompaniment of whistles
and cat-calls from the audience, Fred
Clark, villain from way back, spir
ited away Janet Dole, the country
girl, mainly by puiling a nice night
gown out of his pocket. But Jack
Gill is, hero, came to the rescue,
thought late or early for most of
his cues, and the dastardly villain
ended up with Nell's penny-wise
mother.
"Make Him Pay"
Jane Clary, in the role of the
mother, brought the biggest laugh
when she let her daughter go to
New York with the parting words,
"Make him pay!"
Glamorous actress Gerry Schreib
er did her worst, but to no avail.
The play ended anyway, and there
was no curtain call, since the actors
gave it first, not wanting to risk one
at the end.
After "Little Nell," came a series
of specialty acts featuring Hoke
Roberts, Larry Randall, Bud Cady,
Jerry Reed, Owen Clarke, and Har
rison Stevens. Modernized versions
of "Down by the Old Mill Stream,"
"When You and I Were Young,
Maggie," were vehicles for the as
sembled talent.
Long Campaign
This successful Nitery opening
climaxed the long campaign for a
campus community center begun last
fall.
Committee Chairman Al Hyman
feels that this opening will help the
Nitery on to a successful future; he
also expresses his thanks to Miss
Christine Ricker, Union head, who
supplied the refreshments for the
show; to Masquers, who put on
the playlet; and to the individual
actors who put on the skits.
The Nitery is open.
