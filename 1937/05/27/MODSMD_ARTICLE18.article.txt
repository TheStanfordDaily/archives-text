### 
A half-hour was chopped off the
Nitery schedule yesterday— closing
it every night at 10:30—by the Union
Board of Directors in answer to re
cent complaints by professors who
live upstairs.
This arrangement was made so
that "everybody would be satisfied."
"Union residents," acording to the
Board, "took their rooms on the un
derstanding that they would have a
quiet place to study. Since the Nit
ery is for all the students, this com
promise seemed the most agreeable
to all."
Then, starting Summer Quarter,
the Loungery will be open until 11
nightly except on Friday and Sat
urday evenings, when curfew time
will be midnight. However, on Fri
day evenings when there are special
parties or dances, the Nitery will
