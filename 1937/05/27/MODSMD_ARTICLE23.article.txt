# Pageant Opens Span Tomorrow
## Gate Bridge Will Receive Official Dedication 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 26 (U.R).—
Against a background of elaborate
Western pageantry, San Francisco
tomorrow will officially dedicate and
open the Golden Gate Bridge, the
largest single suspension span in the
world.
The bridge connects the San Fran
cisco Peninsula with Marin County
on the north and links the San
Francisco metropolitan area directly
with the Redwoed Empire region of
Northern California. It also offers a
more direct route to all points of the
Pacific Northwest.
The bridge cost $33,000,000. Eleven
men lost their lives in its construc
tion. Ten of these were killed in the
disaster of February 17 when 12 men
were plunged into San Francisco Bay
on a collapsed scaffolding which
crashed through a safety net. The
span was four years in construction
under the direction of Joseph B.
Strauss, called the "greatest bridge
builder in the world."
The bridge spans the famed "Gate"
at a height of 250 feet above San
Francisco Bay waters. It is 6,450 feet
in length from end to end, and 4,200
feet center to center of piers. The
spun—all suspension—is three times
the length of Brooklyn Bridge in
New York, and 700 feet longer than
the greatest single span ever built
to date, the George Washington Me
morial Bridge across the Hudson
River at New York.
