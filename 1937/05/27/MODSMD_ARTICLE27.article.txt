# Hasher Tax Ruling Hits Farm Groups
## All Houses, Eating Clubs To Pay Unemployment Tax, Says Commission 
### 
All campus eating organizations
must pay an unemployment reserve
fund tax.
That is the consequence of a rul
ing by the Federal Social Security
Board that all fraternity, sorority,
and eating club officers are "em
ployees" under the terms of the so
cial security act regardless of wheth
er they are paid or honorary.
Ruling Revealed
The ruling was revealed yesterday
by Harley Norris, district director
of the California Unemployment Re
serve Commission, who is sending
John L. Sutton, deputy registrar of
employers, to the campus next Wed
nesday to confer with organization
heads.
Sutton, who registered campus or
ganizations last month, will occupy
an office in the Old Union after 10
a.m. on June 2.
All Clubs Hit
Interfraternity Board had pre
viously objected to the classification
of house and club officers as em
ployees because in every case they
brought the total employees up to
eight or more, and eight or more em
ployees make an organization sub
ject to the tax.
Twelve houses and two eating
clubs of the 32 organizations which
registered with Mr. Sutton last
month were subject to the tax even
though honorary officers were not
included. The other 18 would have
been exempt.
The 1936 tax, amounting to 1.35
per cent of the total payroll, is due
immediately. In most cases, this
amounts to about $50. If not paid
until next fall, an additional penalty
will be due. It is for this reason
that Mr, Sutton is coming to the
campus Wednesday to make all nec
essary arrangements before the
close of spring quarter and the sum
mer exodus.
May Be Exempt
Some possibility of avoiding the
tax still exists. The National Inter
fraternity Council is presenting a
brief to the Federal Social Security
Board claiming fraternities and so
rorities are educational institutions
and thus exempt from the tax under
the terms of the National Social Se
curity Act. Since the California act
takes its provisions from the national
one, an exemption under the national
act would result in an exemption
under the California act.
However, since an immediate rul
ing is not expected, the tax must be
paid and a refund claimed if the
Social Security Board exempts cam
pus organizations.

Board that all fraternity, sorority,
and eating club officers are "em
ployees" under the terms of the so
cial security act regardless of wheth
er they are paid or honorary.
Ruling Revealed
The ruling was revealed yesterday
by Harley Norris, district director
of the California Unemployment Re
serve Commission, who is sending
John L. Sutton, deputy registrar of
employers, to the campus next Wed
nesday to confer with organization
heads.
Sutton, who registered campus or
ganizations last month, will occupy
an office in the Old Union after 10
a.m. on June 2.
All Clubs Hit
Interfraternity Board had pre
viously objected to the classification
of house and club officers as em
ployees because in every case they
brought the total employees up to
eight or more, and eight or more em
ployees make an organization sub
ject to the tax.
Twelve houses and two eating
clubs of the 32 organizations which
registered with Mr. Sutton last
month were subject to the tax even
though honorary officers were not
included. The other 18 would have
been exempt.
The 1936 tax, amounting to 1.35
per cent of the total payroll, is due
immediately. In most cases, this
amounts to about $50. If not paid
until next fall, an additional penalty
will be due. It is for this reason
that Mr, Sutton is coming to the
campus Wednesday to make all nec
essary arrangements before the
close of spring quarter and the sum
mer exodus.
May Be Exempt
Some possibility of avoiding the
tax still exists. The National Inter
fraternity Council is presenting a
brief to the Federal Social Security
Board claiming fraternities and so
rorities are educational institutions
and thus exempt from the tax under
the terms of the National Social Se
curity Act. Since the California act
takes its provisions from the national
one, an exemption under the national
act would result in an exemption
under the California act.
However, since an immediate rul
ing is not expected, the tax must be
paid and a refund claimed if the
Social Security Board exempts cam
pus organizations.
