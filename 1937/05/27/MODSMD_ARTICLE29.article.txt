# Dean Advises Stricter Law School Entry
## Increases in Applications Causes Move for Rule; New Course Planned 
### 
More rigorous requirements for
admission to Stanford s Law School
were suggested yesterday by Dean
Marion R. Kirkwood in his annual
informal report on the school s
progress.
According to Dean Kirkwood, the
school has accommodations for only
100 new students, while applica
tions already received indicate a
substantial increase lor fall quar
ter. Although experiments with
aptitude tests during the last few
years have failed to discover any
single satisfactory test, Dean Kirk
wood believes the school now has
sufficient basis for discriminating
among applicants.
Present admission requirement is
an A.B. degree from Stanford or any
other university of recognized
standing.
Among other plans for next fall is
a course in legal writing for first
year students, in which legal prob
lems will be analyzed from the
standpoint of law application and
clear expression of conclusions.
John B. Hurlbut of Los Angeles, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
has been named to succeed Profes
sor Clarke B. Whittier, who will re
tire in June.
