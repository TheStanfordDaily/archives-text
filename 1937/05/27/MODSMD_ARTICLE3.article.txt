# Daily Says '30' For Volume 91
## 
### 
Tonight the Daily goes to
bed for a summer-long rest.
Students, professors, and ad
ministrators who have axes to
grind or announcements to
make should call the Daily this
afternoon. A program will be
printed including all campus
activities and events during the
last two weeks of this quarter.
Tomorrow morning's paper,
which is the last of Volume 91,
will include four pages of pho
tolith and the annual senior
edition, in addition to the regu
lar news section.
Present Editor Bob Eisenbach
plans to celebrate "30" for
Daily stall members with ice
cream and cookies tonight in
the shack.
