# Chappie Bills Gist's Poems In Final Issue
## Ferry Sisters Compose 'Unexpurgated Senior Poem' for Magazine 
### 
Revealing what talented twins
Elizabeth and Frances Ferry would
like to compose for proud parents
on Commencement Day if tradition
and inhibition did not dictate other
wise, "Unexpurgated Senior Poem"
will be published in the final issue of
Chaparral, which will be out next
Wednesday, June 2.
Highlight of this month's funny
mag is Editor Gilman Gist's story
of "Candide" among the Stanford
ites and his classic poem "Swan
Song" engraved for posterity on the
opening page. Both items are illus
trated by the old boy himself.
A full page of pictorial satire on
Stanford's more thoroughly abused
traditions will be contributed by
Jack Boyd, art editor.
Next year's Editor Bob Hartmann
promises a choice collection of
Fables from the Farm, and Bob
Presnell presents as a departing
gesture his "Four Ages of Man," a
succinct summary of college in re
trospect.
Anne Ritchie, whose stories and
"Letters from Grenadine" have con
vulsed Chappie readers for four
years, contributes a work titled,
"Jones of Smith." Editor Gist
promises a final and devastating
barrage of Now Thats.
