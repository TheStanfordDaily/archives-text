# Trueblood Lists Assets, Defects in Farm Set-up
## 
### JIM STONE 
"Stanford has a great future,"
said Dr. D. Elton Trueblood in his
address to the last meeting of the
Luncheon Club yesterday. "But,"
he declared, "it must not fall into
the error of becoming indefinitely
large."
Dr. Trueblood described Stanford
as a large liberal arts school, un
hampered by control of political ox
social powers. It has the unique po
sition of being the only school of its
size and influence west of Chicago.
Lists Assets
Dr. Trueblood told of his obser
vations of Stanford as he made them
this year. Listing the architecture
among the Farm's assets, he said
that "the Inner Quad is symbolc of
Stanford's academic character—that
cf giving universal knowledge rath
er than segregated instruction.
He also praised the system <rf co
education— provided men were al
ways in the majority—the facts that
Stanford is a residence school, and
the heritage of great men in Farm
history.
Sees Defects
He considered as Stanford's great
est defect the intense provincialism
of the student body, and their intel

lectual immaturity. This latter de
fect was especially noticeable, he
said, in the case of religion, and
spoke of his wish to see a Divinity j
School here.
He saw the lack of interest in va
rious school events as an evidence of
the possibility that Stanford was al
ready growing too large, lhat it was }
too centrifugal to maintain the
unity of a great educational center. '
