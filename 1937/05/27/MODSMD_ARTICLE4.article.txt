# Hashbook Release Back to June 4
## 
### 
The bookworm took a turn for the
worse yesterday, as University Press
officials announoed that the Our
Hasher book release date was re
turned to Friday, June 4.
Delay, the authorities explained,
was due partly to the Press' press
ing business, but mostly to the fact
that the author was unable to
choose the kind of paper to be used
in printing.
When the man with the pretty red
hair asked the author what kind of
stock he wanted to use, the com
piler and editor took a look at the
mounting costs and replied: "Water
ed, please," and went off muttering
something about it being bottled in
some sort of a Stanford bond.
