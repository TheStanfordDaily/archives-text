GLORY THAT
IS STANFORD'S

Some day when you think you can
take time out for a half hour or so,
fellers, why don't you drop into the
trophy room in Encina Gym and
take a look around?
Old times, old faces, old' deeds
come to light when you browse
around in that little room chudk
full of cups, medals, pictures, and
various awards that have come to
Stanford athletes and teams since the
founding day.
Silver cups galore, gold ones, too,
little ones to great big ones that
would hold eight or ten gallons, are
packed into a lot of show cases, and
it won't be long before a new room
will have to be found to hold the
ever-growing collection.
There are pictures all over the
walls, too, from two inches square
to a great yard-square photograph
of Stanford's immortal Bud Spencer
winning a quarter-mile race. In
them are many laces that hold a
great place n sports world today, as
well as many that have become
known in business and social life
everywhere. You can find relations
of kids who are at Stanford today—
for instance, if you look at the photo
of the 1910 rugby team you will see
a player who you'd swear is Jack
Partridge of this year's rugby squad.
It's not Curly, though, it's his father,
who was a stalwart forward for
Harry Maloney's rugger squad the
same as is his son today.
There are many others, too, who
you might or might not recognize,
hut who made names for themselves
in Stanford athletics. Dink Temple
ton is shown with the 1920 rugby
team, and in several other places as
trackman, American football player,
coach, and what have you. Dink is
one of the very few four-letter men
you'll find, and a great athlete he
was, too.
The 1924 varsity football team,
coached by Pop Warner and Andy
Kerr, deserves its place on the wall
there, too, for that was the year the
squad went into the Big Game un
defeated, and came from behind in
the last quarter to tie the Bears
20-20. Murray Cuddeback was the
sparkplug of that team, and he was
one of the greatest players Stanford
has ever produced. In that Big Game
that he won almost single-handed
Stanford scored 20 points in the last
quarter, to get the laugh on news
papers that had anticipated too well
and carried the score of the game in
extras on the street before the
game ended.
There are many others, all who
recall old victories, and old losses,
too. If you want to spend an inter
esting half hour it would be hard to
/ind a better place than in that tro
phy room.

YO SEE, CROMWELL,
WE'VE HAD 'EM, TOO

While reminiscing with Harry
Maloney yesterday, there came to
light another old Stanford athletic
feat that runs a rare parallel to a
situation today. U.S.C. has Meadows
and Sefton in the pole vault who are
competing for the world record be
tween themselves week in and week
out this spring, but Stanford 'way
back in 1910 had not two, but three
pole vaulters in the school at the
same time who were world record
holders.
Norman Dole was the first of the
three to hold the record—he set it
at 12 feet 6 inches, a far cry from
today's 14-812 but a world's record
just the same. Then came Lee Scott
to take it away from him by vault
ing 12-9, but even his mark fell be
fore the efforts of Sam Bellah, who
oomphed it over 13 feet. All this
happened in one year, and the three
men were all at Stanford at the
same time. That's a better record
than U.S.C. has set, if you look at it
from the record standpoint.
