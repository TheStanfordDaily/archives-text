## Squad Splits for Annual Spring Conflicts 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER

yesterday as spring gridders, split
into Reds and Whites, held dummy
scrimmage at opposite ends of the
field in preparation for the approach
ing climax, the Spring Game Satur
day at 2:30 in the stadium.
As Timekeeper Tiny Thornhill
oils his stop-watch, for the coming
event, grid fans are reminded of last
year's game, in which the first
stringers were losing to the seconds,
12-0, at the beginning of the fourth
quarter. Then the firsts, by careful
manipulation of new pass plays and
Tiny's own skill in handling the
stopwatch, retaliated with three
touchdowns to win the game, 20-12.
Grayson Still Coach

the first three quarters wore the
white jerseys and were coached by

first string. Coach Grayson, Esquire,

new gray suit and hat, has not yet
planned his attire for Saturday's tilt.
Jim Lawson, coach of the Red
jersey aggregaton, is favored with the
second-string backs 'that nearly won
last year's game. There will be
passers Collins and Hamilton, who
figured in two scoring plays. Doc
Luckett, star of the 19H6 Spring
Game, and Peter Fay, deer-footed
fullback, will also be on hand.
Will Miss Zagar
The Whites will miss Pete Zagar,
who cleared the way as Carl Schott
last spring carried a 20-yard pass
from Paulman 4G yards through a
well-covered field to the goal-line.
Pete is still tossing the discus next
door to the practice field, and Dink
won't give him up.
Groves, Kirsch, CofTis, and Paul
man will play in the White back
field. On the line will be Stone and
Clark, ends; Walton and Ferko,
guards; Kremer and Anderson,
tackles; and Tsoutsouvas, center.
