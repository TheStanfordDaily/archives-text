The high flying junior water polo
team tangles with the upstart Class
of '40 amphibians for the annual
interclass water polo title in Encina
Pools at 4:30 this afternoon.
Yesterday the sophomores won on
a forfeit from the seniors to put
themselves in third place. Tomor
row the frosh will splash things up
with the seniors-in the final game of
the series.
If the Class of '38 wins today they
will rest on top of the aquatic heap
with an undefeated record. The
frosh still have to defeat the sen
iors tomorrow. A senior win will
call for another playoff between the
juniors and the first year men.

sophs and a 10-7 victory over the
seniors. The Encina Inmates won

Juniors: Forwards—Hanna, Loupe,
and Vibert; guards—Hall, Gear, and
Osborn; goalie—Aldrich.
