# Aims vs. Possibilities

COMPOUND of futility to produce the inef
fective —that's the new Axe Society. Set
ting its idealism aside, as one must do to most
idealism, the new organization simply cannot
perform its function —not because the society
is defective, but because the function simply
cannot be performed.
The admirable ideal is to lesson the Hall-Row
gap. To this end, the Axe Society will have as
its members outstanding men from both ends
of the campus who will work together to make
the Stanford student body a unity.
But the new organization comes on the heels
of such bodies as Cardinals, even Ex Com
mittee itself, where exactly the same ideals pre
vail, and where both Hall men and Row men
distinguish themselves for the common weal.
Yet Stanford still has the Hall-Row split.
Will another society, the same in ideals as
two already existent, change the fundamental
causes for the Hall-Row schism? It may, but
the odds are against it.
It seems to us that the Hall-Row antagonism
is an evil out of reach of such societies. There
are elements of Row life different from Hall life.
There is a certain "recognition" in a fraternity
not present in a hall. There are, between Hall
and Row, certain social distinctions —implied
more often than actual—but nevertheless there
in the campus and public mind.
This may be bitter vetch, but it is as true as
Axe Society's aims are idealistic.
Meanwhile, those aims should be credited as
sincere. They are the brain-children of a num
ber of campus leaders, from both Hall and Row,
who sincerely want a united Stanford. Some
of the men who organized it are members of
Phi Phi, Row men's honorary.
If good thoughts get honor, they should
have it. And if good thoughts bring success,
it should be brought to them.
But looking at their idea through the sharp
cutting eyes of reality—we can see only another
scrvice society.
