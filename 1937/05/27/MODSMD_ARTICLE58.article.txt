DR. ELTON TRUEBLOOD saw "Stanford
Through the Eyes of a Convert" at the
final meeting of his luncheon club yesterday,
and decided that Stanford, through the eyes of
a convert, is too provincial.
A quality similar to that evidenced by one
European who said she wanted to go to the
"United States and California" is that which
Dr. Trueblood so aptly tabs as Stanford pro
vincialism.
It is an element comparable to the one which
led someone to compare Stanford to the time
tattered fish bowl," and Stanford's non-cosmo
politan students to its lazy inhabits whose con
tented gliding is seldom interrupted for a look
out through the glass.
Through the converted eyes of Dr. Trueblood,
Stanford's provincials are students rather than
faculty, persons who fail to maintain the differ
entiating characteristics of their many former
environments, but flow into the shape of the
Stanford mold for the four-year fling.
When at Stanford they do as the Stanfordites
do, and do it to such extent that the refreshing
individuality of the cosmopolitan society, often
quite apparent in eastern universities, dissolves
in the acid of Stanford symmetry.
Less provincial than the composite Stanford
student is the cosmopolitan Stanford faculty.
Whether it be due to conscious effort to main
tain the cosmopolitan outlook, or because of an
inherent worldly view into the sphere of
thought, is debatable; the fact remains that the
few cosmopolites Stanford has are instructors
for the provincials.
Panacea for Stanford's provincialism—though
many don't agree with Dr. Trueblood that
Stanford's condition is in need of remedy—
would be found in such world-wide activities
as the Edinburgh debate, the South American
good-will tour, Ling-Nan scholarships and the
like. Anything that draws the Stanford eye
beyond Paly, L'Omelette and The City is a
corrective.

But this is not a problem students are likely
to regard as serious, and as far as the indi
vidual is concerned it isn't serious. It is a situ
ation that exists, and it will continue to exist in
degree till senior class plates reach around the
Quad.
At that time, Stanford may look at itself and
decide that it is more cosmopolitan than in 1937,
but the change would be hardly noticed from
year to year.
We see the greatest reason for Stanford's
provincialism in Stanford's youth. When as old
as Harvard is today, it will be more wise, more
worldly, and more cosmopolitan; a condition
brought about by the increase of national and
international activities.
Not to be remedied by»instantaneous change,
Stanford's provincialism must wait its coming
of age. —G. F.

politan students to its lazy inhabits whose con
tented gliding is seldom interrupted for a look
out through the glass.
Through the converted eyes of Dr. Trueblood,
Stanford's provincials are students rather than
faculty, persons who fail to maintain the differ
entiating characteristics of their many former
environments, but flow into the shape of the
Stanford mold for the four-year fling.
When at Stanford they do as the Stanfordites
do, and do it to such extent that the refreshing
individuality of the cosmopolitan society, often
quite apparent in eastern universities, dissolves
in the acid of Stanford symmetry.
Less provincial than the composite Stanford
student is the cosmopolitan Stanford faculty.
Whether it be due to conscious effort to main
tain the cosmopolitan outlook, or because of an
inherent worldly view into the sphere of
thought, is debatable; the fact remains that the
few cosmopolites Stanford has are instructors
for the provincials.
Panacea for Stanford's provincialism—though
many don't agree with Dr. Trueblood that
Stanford's condition is in need of remedy—
would be found in such world-wide activities
as the Edinburgh debate, the South American
good-will tour, Ling-Nan scholarships and the
like. Anything that draws the Stanford eye
beyond Paly, L'Omelette and The City is a
corrective.

But this is not a problem students are likely
to regard as serious, and as far as the indi
vidual is concerned it isn't serious. It is a situ
ation that exists, and it will continue to exist in
degree till senior class plates reach around the
Quad.
At that time, Stanford may look at itself and
decide that it is more cosmopolitan than in 1937,
but the change would be hardly noticed from
year to year.
We see the greatest reason for Stanford's
provincialism in Stanford's youth. When as old
as Harvard is today, it will be more wise, more
worldly, and more cosmopolitan; a condition
brought about by the increase of national and
international activities.
Not to be remedied by»instantaneous change,
Stanford's provincialism must wait its coming
of age. —G. F.
DR. ELTON TRUEBLOOD saw "Stanford
Through the Eyes of a Convert" at the
final meeting of his luncheon club yesterday,
and decided that Stanford, through the eyes of
a convert, is too provincial.
A quality similar to that evidenced by one
European who said she wanted to go to the
"United States and California" is that which
Dr. Trueblood so aptly tabs as Stanford pro
vincialism.
It is an element comparable to the one which
led someone to compare Stanford to the time
tattered fish bowl," and Stanford's non-cosmo
politan students to its lazy inhabits whose con
tented gliding is seldom interrupted for a look
out through the glass.
