W7HEN the end of every year conies around, particu
larly when it comes around in the Spring, beer
busts seem to be in vogue with organizations of every
description, and even among people who aren't or
ganized. Occasionally, even a class or two busts, too,
informally, of course.
Anyway, one Geology Field Trip Class went out
and looked at rocks one Saturday morning, and some
of them had some beer on the way back, and the car in
front collected a lot of empty bottles and the driver
kept throwing them, one by one out the window all
the way home.
And the other drivers cursed and swore at the first
driver, because they had to drive through and around
and over all the broken glass on the highway.
ALSO at this time of year, it becomes the policy of
(hose who appreciate the out-of-doors atmosphere
of the out-of-doors to go out of doors and into the
open for some camping or fishing.
Now there was one freshman who just wanted to go
camping, but he had a car and some of his friends de
cided he would go fishing at Monterey one week
end.
Now he had never been fishing before, and he
didn't expect to catch any fish. As a matter of fact,
he only pulled in a few hundred, 150 to be exact, so
they ate some and gave some away and still had a
lot left, so he brought some back to Stanford and kept
them in his washbowl in his room and in a five-gallon
gasoline can and everywhere else for a while. But
that didn't work because they didn't live long and the
mortality rate was so high.
A ND so he thought and thought and decided what
to do.
One night at midnight, he crept out of Encina with
the fish in his hip pocket and put them in the rumble
seat of his car and drove off.
He came back 20 minutes later.
The next morning one of the janitors looked in
the Union fountain-pool and thought he had drunk
something he shouldn't: the fish were blue, not or
ange. So he drained the pool and put in new gold
fish, and the Union had fish last Friday^
Yesterday the Wednesday R.O.T.C. class was ended.
Members were asked to turn in their suits as soon as
possible, so they went over to the desk and took off
their uniforms, and walked all the way home in the
hot sun in their shorts.
