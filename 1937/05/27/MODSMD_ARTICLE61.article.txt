# BULL SESSION
## IN PACE REQUIESTANT 
### 
'THE Daily has a new editor. A new volume will roll
off the battered presses next year and a new stafT
of tryoutees will be hammered into shape by the wom
en's editor, all so that the campus may know what's
happening from day to day.
Bull Session will continue under the able hands of
John Cobbs, who will try to keep campus blood boil
ing, but I have to say good day, to Stanford, to the
Daily, to Dr. Wilbur.

There is something very moving and yet still very
gratifying about saying good-bye to a column of this
sort. It is gratifying because you realize that no longer
will you have to sit in the Daily shack on hot after
noons and beat a typewriter when you could be out
lying in the sun, drinking mint juleps, or just riding
around in your car going nowhere, thinking of nothing.
It is moving because you realize you will never
write it again. You feel as if you had just left an old
friend standing on a station platform waving you off
on new journeys.
# * * *
here in the afternoons, you hit off a few
k sentences, tear them out, begin again. Each time
you start to write, a little more of yourself has been
sapped out onto the paper. You can't help it. It just
happens. Each time part of you goes out into print,
you become a little bit more embarrassed until at
times you are almost afraid to walk down the Quad. ,
I have been intense about this column, have prob
ably thought it meant more than it has, but I have
always tried to say something. Whether I did or not
is another question. Trying to get your thoughts down
on paper, you sometimes say a lot of silly things. Give
anyone enough time to talk and sooner or later he'll
say something pretty foolish. But then that's to be
expected. I hope I'm forgiven.
♦ # ♦ *
If I've offended anyone, I'm sorry. If I've said any
thing worthwhile, anything that made anyone happy,
I'm glad. Nothing I've said in this column was ever
meant with any malice to any particular person, but
rather to some group of stuffed shirts who are too
pompous to look over their bulbous stomachs to see
where the ground is.
It's been a lot of fun. I'd like to continue, but I'm
through. Good link, John.

happens. Each time part of you goes out into print,
you become a little bit more embarrassed until at
times you are almost afraid to walk down the Quad. ,
I have been intense about this column, have prob
ably thought it meant more than it has, but I have
always tried to say something. Whether I did or not
is another question. Trying to get your thoughts down
on paper, you sometimes say a lot of silly things. Give
anyone enough time to talk and sooner or later he'll
say something pretty foolish. But then that's to be
expected. I hope I'm forgiven.

If I've offended anyone, I'm sorry. If I've said any
thing worthwhile, anything that made anyone happy,
I'm glad. Nothing I've said in this column was ever
meant with any malice to any particular person, but
rather to some group of stuffed shirts who are too
pompous to look over their bulbous stomachs to see
where the ground is.
It's been a lot of fun. I'd like to continue, but I'm
through. Good link, John.

'THE Daily has a new editor. A new volume will roll
off the battered presses next year and a new stafT
of tryoutees will be hammered into shape by the wom
en's editor, all so that the campus may know what's
happening from day to day.
Bull Session will continue under the able hands of
John Cobbs, who will try to keep campus blood boil
ing, but I have to say good day, to Stanford, to the
Daily, to Dr. Wilbur.

There is something very moving and yet still very
gratifying about saying good-bye to a column of this
sort. It is gratifying because you realize that no longer
will you have to sit in the Daily shack on hot after
noons and beat a typewriter when you could be out
lying in the sun, drinking mint juleps, or just riding
around in your car going nowhere, thinking of nothing.
It is moving because you realize you will never
write it again. You feel as if you had just left an old
friend standing on a station platform waving you off
on new journeys.

here in the afternoons, you hit off a few
k sentences, tear them out, begin again. Each time
you start to write, a little more of yourself has been
sapped out onto the paper. You can't help it. It just
happens. Each time part of you goes out into print,
you become a little bit more embarrassed until at
times you are almost afraid to walk down the Quad. ,
