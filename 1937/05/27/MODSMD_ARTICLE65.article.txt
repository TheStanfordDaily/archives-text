# March Excels In Subtle 'Star Is Born'
## 
### 
"A Star Is Born" (coming to Stan- I
j ford Theater) brings the best job
j that either Janet Gaynor or Fred
i eric March has done for a long time.
The picture is in Technicolor, but it
is not just an efTort to show off the
process.
March, with a sensitive and mov
ing performance, dominates the pic
ture and changes the whole angle in
which it was written. The story be
comes not "A Star Is Born," but "A
Star Is Dying," as you see him go
from the top to the bottom.
Hollywood, in taking this concept,
that for every one that goes up, an
other goes down, does one of the
most subtle bits of production we
have seen in pictures. However, they I
return to what was evidently their
original purpose (showing the mak- !
ing of a silk purse from a sow's
ear) in their closing scenes, and al- j
most spoil the effect of their pre- i
vious efforts. In being consistent to ]
their first idea, they are inconsist- i
ent in the picture itself. But it is
something worth seeing.
