# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
A good many students seem to
like "swing" music. However, it is
impossible for any one person to
own all the records that he would
like to hear. Because of this it
seems to me a good idea to organize
a "jam club," that could meet one or
more afternoons or evenings a week
at the Nitery. Members could
bring their records and a fine pro
gram of swing music arranged.
I believe that the advantages of
such a club are enough to make it
highly successful, and would like to
have some opinions.
