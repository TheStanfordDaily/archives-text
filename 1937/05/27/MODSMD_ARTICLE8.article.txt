# Peter's Quirks Reflect Love for Native France
## Coutts Amazed Neighbors With Queer Behavior 
### HUNTER HENDEE JOHN RICE 
To be referred to as "eccentric"
full 50 years after his departure, a
man must have been "plenty pecu
liar"—to put it mildly.
Many of Peter Coutts' "peculiari
ties" were founded on one great
love; not so peculiar in itself. That
was his love for his native France.
His long rolls of French bread were
entrained fresh from San Francisco
every morning, and it was not until
the bread arrived that Coutts would
breakfast.
He arose every morning at 7
o'clock, tucked his pant-legs into
yellow-topped walking "ooors, tap
ped his cane on the ground as he
stamped over the 1400 acres of Ayr
shire Farm.
Workers knew never to speak to
Coutts before he had breakfasted;
for an empty stomach made him a

curt talker. He would return to Es
condite at 11 o'clock, by which time
the bread had arrived from the
Mayfield station.
After breakfast, Coutts was talka
tive —democratically so.. Whenever
his workmen discovered a strange
rock or plant, Coutts sat down and
told them all about it.
Imported Rare Plants
Because he wanted his estate to
remind him of France, Coutts cul
tivated foreign plants and trees,
fashioned his buildings after Euro
pean ones. First popular trees in the
vicinty were in his grove planted
on the north shore of Mystery Hill
lake, near the corner of Mirada and
Coronada Roads.
First law of Ayrshire Farm was
"Be kind to animals," and Coutts
himself was not only kind to ani
mals, he was downright gracious.
His brick-built stable was a model
of cleanliness and beauty. A hun
dred spotless stalls housed 95) pure
blooded HoLstein and Ayrshire cows
and one giant black ox which he
affectionately called "Monsieur
Curate."
Because Coutts thought cows —
like anybody else—liked good music,
he gave each of his cows a silver
bell engraved with his own pet
French name. Each cow had its
individual groom who combed them
and promenaded them around the
meadows every day.
Across Portola Road from Escon
dite Cottage towers the library and
office of Peter Coutts who once kept
a great number of rare books there.
Among his literary treasures were
some 800 publications printed by
the Elzevirs, famous Italian typog
raphers.
Built Look-out Toyvcr
From the tower of the library
Coutts could overlook his entire es
tate, and if he ever needed a look
out tower, as some Coutts yarns
would indicate he did, it was this
building that he used and not
"Frenchman's Tower" hidden back
in the woods of Matadero Creek.
Perhaps it was because he partic
ularly disliked gophers, or perhaps
he found he had too many workers
for too little work and so devised
new jobs to keep old employees
busy. At any rate, he ordered his
men to fill up all the gopher holes
on his 1400 acres—or at least so he

! did according to stories of Mayfield
old-timers.
And wild are the tales, too, of his
tremendous wealth and the utter
disregard he had for it, His weekly
farm expenses, including a $5000
payroll, came v/eekly by train. On
Friday afternoons, $5000 silver dol
lars would arrive from San Fran
-1 ciseo, and on Saturday another
$2500 in gold coin from San Jose.

his workmen discovered a strange

told them all about it.

Fable Describes Game
j Pet fable of most Coutts-addicts
'concerns Peter Coutts' young son,
Albert, whose favorite game shows
evidence of a stroke of genius. Al
bert used to throw a silver dollar,
as far into the bushes as he could,
and then pay each of his friends
1 Iwo dollars not to chase it.
So reports Mayfieldman C. E.
Murick, one-time Mayfield express
man, who still remembers the gen
erous old Frenchman who departed
las suddenly, as mysteriously as he
j came . . .
Why did he leave his "most beau
tiful valley" just when his baronial
esfate was taking form? And where
did he go?
(Concluding article on M. Peter
Coutts will be published tomor
' row.)
