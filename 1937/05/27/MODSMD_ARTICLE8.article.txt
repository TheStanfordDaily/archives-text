# Peter's Quirks Reflect Love for Native France
## Coutts Amazed Neighbors With Queer Behavior 
### HUNTER HENDEE JOHN RICE 
To be referred to as "eccentric"
full 50 years after his departure, a
man must have been "plenty pecu
liar"—to put it mildly.
Many of Peter Coutts' "peculiari
ties" were founded on one great
love; not so peculiar in itself. That
was his love for his native France.
His long rolls of French bread were
entrained fresh from San Francisco
every morning, and it was not until
the bread arrived that Coutts would
breakfast.
He arose every morning at 7
o'clock, tucked his pant-legs into
yellow-topped walking "ooors, tap
ped his cane on the ground as he
stamped over the 1400 acres of Ayr
shire Farm.
Workers knew never to speak to
Coutts before he had breakfasted;
for an empty stomach made him a

curt talker. He would return to Es
condite at 11 o'clock, by which time
the bread had arrived from the
Mayfield station.
After breakfast, Coutts was talka
tive —democratically so.. Whenever
his workmen discovered a strange
rock or plant, Coutts sat down and
told them all about it.
Imported Rare Plants
Because he wanted his estate to
remind him of France, Coutts cul
tivated foreign plants and trees,
fashioned his buildings after Euro
pean ones. First popular trees in the
vicinty were in his grove planted
on the north shore of Mystery Hill
lake, near the corner of Mirada and
Coronada Roads.
First law of Ayrshire Farm was
"Be kind to animals," and Coutts
himself was not only kind to ani
mals, he was downright gracious.
His brick-built stable was a model
of cleanliness and beauty. A hun
dred spotless stalls housed 95) pure
blooded HoLstein and Ayrshire cows
and one giant black ox which he
affectionately called "Monsieur
Curate."
