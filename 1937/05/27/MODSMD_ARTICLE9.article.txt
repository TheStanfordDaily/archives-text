The writers wish to thank
Mrs. David Starr Jordan for
calling their attention to the
fact that Mr. Jordan gave the
name of "Escondite Cottage" to
Coutts' home, and not Coutts
himself, as appeared in Tues
day's article. Mr. and Mrs.
Jordan lived in Escondite some
two years before the President's
home was completed.
