h Mermaids,indeed!
It seems that all the beauty
r queens are out to make the mer-
L maids green . . . with envy. They
do not turn their backs, but
f calmly face the BARE FACTS,
y that suits can be brief if the fit
► it neat. They like to slip into a
skin, resembling a fish scale or
fin. So Connie picked this rubber
wonder to help them steal the
mermaid's thunder. Connie tried
it on herself and it fit like a
postage stamp. (She swears it
would make the Venu* de Milo's
curvatures look scant!) No belt
... moulded so it's svelte . . ,
even from the rear. Seams care
fully taped, especially where the
crotch is shaped. Gorgeous
shades, sun-yellow, coral, turquoise
and white. Dazzling in the water
. . .or out. 1.95. Other models
with skirts, 3.25. Street floor,
Capping the Climax
Just to cap the climax and to t
diver's delight ... these comely
bathing caps for provocativ«
water sprites. The one with e
fringe'of bangs over your charm
ing brow, The other with
colored spots and rope across
the prow, 75i£. Pastel and
white colors . . . take your picl
and make your bow. White
rimmed, black glasses will keep
the sun from making passes al
your eyes. Connie likes the octa
gon shape and she thinks these
take the prize at Besides,
white rims are a fashion whim
. . . whether you need them or
not, you'll want to be seen in.

Mahatma Scanlies
Brief little rubber Ghandi's ara
one of summer's come-in-handies,
Connie named them Mahatma
scanties, though they're rightfully
Kleinert's panties. Made of spe
cially processed rubber to wear
under cover of swim suits or
sportive clothes. Flattering to the
"figger" . . . comfortable and
about as big as a minute. Flesh
pink, 50c only. If you're one to
fish for compliments, you'll catch
them with this beach bag. Canvas,
rubber-lined, to carry in safety
your bathing "glad rags." Flee!
of fish, very amusing, swimming
ON TOP of the WAVES. Ba C in
white and blue is 1.00.
