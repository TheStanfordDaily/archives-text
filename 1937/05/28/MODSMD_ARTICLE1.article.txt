# The 						Farm's Three Big Achievements For 1937
## Two New Landmarks on the Stanford Horizon 
### 
New playgrounds in Stanford's 9,000 acres marked the
academic year 1936-37 as one notable in construction of
physical plant..
Virtually completed today are the new $500,000 Me
morial Hall, finest college theater in the West, and the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater, gift of a father of one of
Stanford's sons.
Commencement Exercises this year will signalize the
return of the University to the out-of-doors in its observ
ance of academic holidays. On June 13th, 7,000 will see a
graduation ceremony that promises to be the most impres
sive in Stanford's history, set in a man-made glen of arden
already taking on the touch of Nature.
Curtain-ringer in the new theater will be the midsum
mer drama festival, featuring an elaborate production of
"Twelfth Night."
Surrounding the play itself will be courses in the drama,
theatrical discussion groups, and experimental plays in
the new Little Theater in the Memorial Hall. Not just a part
of summer school, but the realization of a dream is this all
inclusive dramatic celebration.
In years to come, it will be one of the main supports of
the new School of Fine Arts that will make Stanford the
western center of artistic thought.
With this end in view, land surrounding the art gallery,
amphitheater, and Memorial Hall has been set aside for new
buildings, when and if the University can start on its new
adventure in training for life.
Next fall, when Stanford returns for the next academic
year, there will be new temples to its old faith.

Clatter of rivet guns on the campus could not quite drown out the
click of candid camera shutters during 1936 37.
Lower right is the height of the camera craze; a magazine sent a photog
rapher down to the Farm to snap President Wilbur on his way to the Ad
Building.
Achievement number two, the Memorial Theater, looms on the right
with not only riveters, but plasterers and finishers ready to depart.
The Theater opens a week after the class of '37 departs. Below is the
only photograph taken so far that gives any conception of the beauties
of the Laurence Frost Amphitheater. Gifts totaling $65,000 made possible
this setting for Commencement Exercises June 13.
