# Frosh Gridders Do Their Stuff
## Men To Vie in Punting, Drop, Place Kicking 
### 
Kickers on last fall's freshman
football team will battle it out this
afternoon for kicking honors in a
punting, drop kicking, and place
kicking contest to start at 2:30 on
' the Frosh field.
j Judging for all three of the events
| will be based on accuracy, distance,
j time, and form and in the case of
j punting also height. Judges for the
j contest will be Frank Alustiza,
■ Larry Rouble, and Frosh Coach Har
ry Shipkey. In the punting and drop
kicking each contestant will kick
12 times, six with a center, and six
without. In the place kicking all
twelve kicks will be with a center.
I The three events will probably
be run off at the same time in order
i to get them over with before the
regular spring grid practice. Coach
Shipkey urges that all entrants in
i the contest get out on the field and
! warm up as soon as possible because
\ of the speed with which the events
I are run off. •
