# Campus Sees Changes On Farm in '37
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
103G-37 viewed in retrospect adds
j another chapter to Stanford's his
l tory—a chapter filled with develop-
I ment of new plans, new activities.
Changes on the campus itself have
j been numerous. The all-but-com
j pleted Memorial Theater sounds the
i doom of Assembly Hall as a setting
' for plays and concerts. Simply styled
I in its architecture, the theater fea
j tures the most modern stage equip-
I ment.
New Amphitheater
A short distance away is the Lau-
I rence Frost Amphitheater, its lawn
-1 covered terraces ready to be the
I setting for Commencement June 13.
j The project was made possible by
I funds donated by Howard Frost in
| memory of his son, for whom the
j amphitheater is named.
Under construction is the Cub
j berley Education Building, to be
! completed a year from now. Donors
| are Ellwood P. Cubberley, Dean
! Emeritus of the School of Education,
i and Mrs. Cubberley.
Lagunita Wings
| Lagunita's two wings will be ready
j for occupation fall quarter. The
building urge has spread to sorori-
I ties and fraternities, 16 of which are
' either rebuilding or remodeling their
i houses.
i • Several traditional activities have
disappeared or been replaced during
! the last year. Focal point in a Uni
! vcrsity-wide controversy fall quar
| ter was the annual soph-frosh mud
l fight. After being ratified by a
landslide vote in a student election,
i the fight was abolished by Ex Coin
| mitt.ee October 20, the same day that
| sophs defeated their freshman rivals
j for the first time.
Masque Hall Contest
Conflict raging over the Masque
| Ball King-Queen contest finally was
! settled when the rulers were chosen
j from the floor at the Coronation
i theme dance April 23. The decision
i was a moral victory for Women's
Conference, which had opposed the
vote-buying popularity contest.
Ihe County Fair held in Union
i Court February 9 replaced Women's
1 Conference annual party during fall
quarter. Proceeds from the Fair
formed the basis for a new scholar
ship fund.
New Activities
New activities have developed
rapidly. Chuck Schaefer's brain
I child, the Speakers' Bureau, was or-
I ganized in December, now is one of
| the most successful groups on the
i campus. Jim Reynolds, along with
! the rest of Ex Committee, appointed
' the new Student-Faculty Relations
i Committee during winter quarter,
' and Tuesday night tentatively ap
! proved the Axe Society, designed to
promote Hall-Row co-operation. Or
t ganized only a few weeks ago was
the Student Leadership Institute,
in which 150 campus activity men |
and women have been asked to par- |
ticipate.
Naturally topping fall quarter ac- j
livities was the Big Game. Stan- I
ford's rah-rah spirit reached its cii- I
max with the Ram s Head Gaieties
November 20, and the bonfire rally
the night before. More football spirit
cropped up in the rally and Frosh
Pujamarino before the U.S.C. game.
'Idealist' Plaii
Polftics, both campus and national,
have aroused interest all year. A
University poll before the national
presidential election showed stu
dents to be for Landon, and 1 acuity
for Roosevelt.
The "idealist" joint Hall - Row
ticket proposed for A.S.S.U. elec
tions this spring faded from view
before students went to the polls
and voted in a Row majority, headed i
by Tom Kille'fer, president-elect.
Home Drive
Honors for the most intensive cam
paign go to the' Convalescent Home |
Drive, chairmanned by Jecb Halaby.
With the Soph Carnival, Bean Day, |
the Strawberry Brunch, Labor Day, J
and the Masque Ball as its highlights, j
the drive accumulated more than
$6,000.
The faculty has come in for its
of attention, as well as stu
dents. Comptroller Almon E. Roth 1
resigned early in March to become
president of both Pacific American
Shipowners' Association and San
Francisco Waterfront Employers' As- |
sociation. Sociology Professor Rich- j
ard LaPiere had his novel, "Son of '

Han," published by Harper's, and
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliott's "Stanford,
the First Twenty-five Years" came
off the Stanford University Press.
Drama Productions
Dramatic productions have con
sistently made profits all year, among
them Drama Council's presentations,
"This Side Idolatdy," "Roadside,"
and "Lady Precious Stream." Barn
stormers' "Down the Hatch!" closed
the season.
Student leaders worked overtime
planning Peace Day, April 22. Stan
ford debaters traveled far afield,
Jim Hill and Jim Reynolds touring
Central America, and Bob Mallett
and Frances Ford sailing off to the
Islands to meet the University of
Hawaii.

landslide vote in a student election,

j for the first time.
Masque Hall Contest
Conflict raging over the Masque
| Ball King-Queen contest finally was
! settled when the rulers were chosen
j from the floor at the Coronation
i theme dance April 23. The decision
i was a moral victory for Women's
Conference, which had opposed the
vote-buying popularity contest.
Ihe County Fair held in Union
i Court February 9 replaced Women's
1 Conference annual party during fall
quarter. Proceeds from the Fair
formed the basis for a new scholar
ship fund.
New Activities
New activities have developed
rapidly. Chuck Schaefer's brain
I child, the Speakers' Bureau, was or-
I ganized in December, now is one of
| the most successful groups on the
i campus. Jim Reynolds, along with
! the rest of Ex Committee, appointed
' the new Student-Faculty Relations
i Committee during winter quarter,
' and Tuesday night tentatively ap
! proved the Axe Society, designed to
promote Hall-Row co-operation. Or
t ganized only a few weeks ago was
the Student Leadership Institute,
in which 150 campus activity men |
and women have been asked to par- |
ticipate.
Naturally topping fall quarter ac- j
livities was the Big Game. Stan- I
ford's rah-rah spirit reached its cii- I
max with the Ram s Head Gaieties
November 20, and the bonfire rally
the night before. More football spirit
cropped up in the rally and Frosh
Pujamarino before the U.S.C. game.
'Idealist' Plaii
Polftics, both campus and national,
have aroused interest all year. A
University poll before the national
presidential election showed stu
dents to be for Landon, and 1 acuity
for Roosevelt.
The "idealist" joint Hall - Row
ticket proposed for A.S.S.U. elec
tions this spring faded from view
before students went to the polls
and voted in a Row majority, headed i
by Tom Kille'fer, president-elect.
Home Drive
Honors for the most intensive cam
paign go to the' Convalescent Home |
Drive, chairmanned by Jecb Halaby.
With the Soph Carnival, Bean Day, |
the Strawberry Brunch, Labor Day, J
and the Masque Ball as its highlights, j
the drive accumulated more than
$6,000.
The faculty has come in for its
of attention, as well as stu
dents. Comptroller Almon E. Roth 1
resigned early in March to become
president of both Pacific American
Shipowners' Association and San
Francisco Waterfront Employers' As- |
sociation. Sociology Professor Rich- j
ard LaPiere had his novel, "Son of '

Han," published by Harper's, and
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliott's "Stanford,
the First Twenty-five Years" came
off the Stanford University Press.
Drama Productions
Dramatic productions have con
sistently made profits all year, among
them Drama Council's presentations,
"This Side Idolatdy," "Roadside,"
and "Lady Precious Stream." Barn
stormers' "Down the Hatch!" closed
the season.
Student leaders worked overtime
planning Peace Day, April 22. Stan
ford debaters traveled far afield,
Jim Hill and Jim Reynolds touring
Central America, and Bob Mallett
and Frances Ford sailing off to the
Islands to meet the University of
Hawaii.
103G-37 viewed in retrospect adds

I ment of new plans, new activities.
Changes on the campus itself have
j been numerous. The all-but-com

I ment.
New Amphitheater

Naturally topping fall quarter ac- j
livities was the Big Game. Stan- I
ford's rah-rah spirit reached its cii- I
max with the Ram s Head Gaieties
November 20, and the bonfire rally
the night before. More football spirit
cropped up in the rally and Frosh
Pujamarino before the U.S.C. game.
'Idealist' Plaii
Polftics, both campus and national,
have aroused interest all year. A
University poll before the national
presidential election showed stu
dents to be for Landon, and 1 acuity
for Roosevelt.
The "idealist" joint Hall - Row
ticket proposed for A.S.S.U. elec
tions this spring faded from view
before students went to the polls
and voted in a Row majority, headed i
by Tom Kille'fer, president-elect.
Home Drive
Honors for the most intensive cam
paign go to the' Convalescent Home |
Drive, chairmanned by Jecb Halaby.
With the Soph Carnival, Bean Day, |
the Strawberry Brunch, Labor Day, J
and the Masque Ball as its highlights, j
the drive accumulated more than
$6,000.
The faculty has come in for its
of attention, as well as stu
dents. Comptroller Almon E. Roth 1
resigned early in March to become
president of both Pacific American
Shipowners' Association and San
Francisco Waterfront Employers' As- |
sociation. Sociology Professor Rich- j
ard LaPiere had his novel, "Son of '

Han," published by Harper's, and
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliott's "Stanford,
the First Twenty-five Years" came
off the Stanford University Press.
Drama Productions
Dramatic productions have con
sistently made profits all year, among
them Drama Council's presentations,
"This Side Idolatdy," "Roadside,"
and "Lady Precious Stream." Barn
stormers' "Down the Hatch!" closed
the season.
Student leaders worked overtime
planning Peace Day, April 22. Stan
ford debaters traveled far afield,
Jim Hill and Jim Reynolds touring
Central America, and Bob Mallett
and Frances Ford sailing off to the
Islands to meet the University of
Hawaii.
103G-37 viewed in retrospect adds
j another chapter to Stanford's his
l tory—a chapter filled with develop-
I ment of new plans, new activities.
Changes on the campus itself have
j been numerous. The all-but-com
j pleted Memorial Theater sounds the
i doom of Assembly Hall as a setting
' for plays and concerts. Simply styled
I in its architecture, the theater fea
j tures the most modern stage equip-
I ment.
New Amphitheater
A short distance away is the Lau-
I rence Frost Amphitheater, its lawn
-1 covered terraces ready to be the
I setting for Commencement June 13.
j The project was made possible by
I funds donated by Howard Frost in
| memory of his son, for whom the
j amphitheater is named.
Under construction is the Cub
j berley Education Building, to be
! completed a year from now. Donors
| are Ellwood P. Cubberley, Dean
! Emeritus of the School of Education,
i and Mrs. Cubberley.
Lagunita Wings
| Lagunita's two wings will be ready
j for occupation fall quarter. The
building urge has spread to sorori-
I ties and fraternities, 16 of which are
' either rebuilding or remodeling their
i houses.
i • Several traditional activities have
disappeared or been replaced during
! the last year. Focal point in a Uni
! vcrsity-wide controversy fall quar
| ter was the annual soph-frosh mud
l fight. After being ratified by a
landslide vote in a student election,
i the fight was abolished by Ex Coin
| mitt.ee October 20, the same day that
| sophs defeated their freshman rivals
j for the first time.
Masque Hall Contest
Conflict raging over the Masque
| Ball King-Queen contest finally was
! settled when the rulers were chosen
j from the floor at the Coronation
i theme dance April 23. The decision
i was a moral victory for Women's
Conference, which had opposed the
vote-buying popularity contest.
Ihe County Fair held in Union
i Court February 9 replaced Women's
1 Conference annual party during fall
quarter. Proceeds from the Fair
formed the basis for a new scholar
ship fund.
New Activities
New activities have developed
rapidly. Chuck Schaefer's brain
I child, the Speakers' Bureau, was or-
I ganized in December, now is one of
| the most successful groups on the
i campus. Jim Reynolds, along with
! the rest of Ex Committee, appointed
' the new Student-Faculty Relations
i Committee during winter quarter,
' and Tuesday night tentatively ap
! proved the Axe Society, designed to
promote Hall-Row co-operation. Or
t ganized only a few weeks ago was
the Student Leadership Institute,
in which 150 campus activity men |
and women have been asked to par- |
ticipate.
