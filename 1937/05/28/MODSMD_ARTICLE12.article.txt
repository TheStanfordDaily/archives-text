### JEAN TOFFEE 
103G-37 viewed in retrospect adds
j another chapter to Stanford's his
l tory—a chapter filled with develop-
I ment of new plans, new activities.
Changes on the campus itself have
j been numerous. The all-but-com
j pleted Memorial Theater sounds the
i doom of Assembly Hall as a setting
' for plays and concerts. Simply styled
I in its architecture, the theater fea
j tures the most modern stage equip-
I ment.
New Amphitheater
A short distance away is the Lau-
I rence Frost Amphitheater, its lawn
-1 covered terraces ready to be the
I setting for Commencement June 13.
j The project was made possible by
I funds donated by Howard Frost in
| memory of his son, for whom the
j amphitheater is named.
Under construction is the Cub
j berley Education Building, to be
! completed a year from now. Donors
| are Ellwood P. Cubberley, Dean
! Emeritus of the School of Education,
i and Mrs. Cubberley.
Lagunita Wings
| Lagunita's two wings will be ready
j for occupation fall quarter. The
building urge has spread to sorori-
I ties and fraternities, 16 of which are
' either rebuilding or remodeling their
i houses.
i • Several traditional activities have
disappeared or been replaced during
! the last year. Focal point in a Uni
! vcrsity-wide controversy fall quar
| ter was the annual soph-frosh mud
l fight. After being ratified by a
landslide vote in a student election,
i the fight was abolished by Ex Coin
| mitt.ee October 20, the same day that
| sophs defeated their freshman rivals
j for the first time.
Masque Hall Contest
Conflict raging over the Masque
| Ball King-Queen contest finally was
! settled when the rulers were chosen
j from the floor at the Coronation
i theme dance April 23. The decision
i was a moral victory for Women's
Conference, which had opposed the
vote-buying popularity contest.
Ihe County Fair held in Union
i Court February 9 replaced Women's
1 Conference annual party during fall
quarter. Proceeds from the Fair
formed the basis for a new scholar
ship fund.
New Activities
New activities have developed
rapidly. Chuck Schaefer's brain
I child, the Speakers' Bureau, was or-
I ganized in December, now is one of
| the most successful groups on the
i campus. Jim Reynolds, along with
! the rest of Ex Committee, appointed
' the new Student-Faculty Relations
i Committee during winter quarter,
' and Tuesday night tentatively ap
! proved the Axe Society, designed to
promote Hall-Row co-operation. Or
t ganized only a few weeks ago was
the Student Leadership Institute,
