# Inter-Fraternity Council Bans Summer Pledging
## 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
A gentleman's agreement that 110 house will do any pledging during
the summer brought to a close Interfraternity Council activities for the
present school year at the final meeting ol the quarter last nignt at the
S.A.E. house.
Suggested by Ralph Huntsbcrger, the agreement was made in order to
give freshmen a fair chance to see other fraternities before making a

►definite choice. It was pointed out,
however, that although early pledg
ing has been made legal, none would
be binding or recognized until the
! official pledge date.
! The council confirmed the fact that
: no sophomore pledge may live in a
i house unless he has a C average in
! the Bawlout or for this spring quar
ter. They may eat their meals at
• the fraternities, however. Housing
j plans for delinquent sophomores
j were discussed, but no definite ac
j tion was taken.
President Don Moulton advised
house presidents to go to the Union
Wednesday to discuss the social se
curity act with John L. Sutton, reg
istrar of employers. The council
decided to leave final decision con
cerning payment of the tax to Moul
ton and Bob Hoover, who will in
vestigate possibilities of avoiding
the tax.
It is possible that the tax will not
include fraternities because honor
ary officers might be withdrawn from
the category of "employees"; be
cause officers and hashers could be
decreased so that the tax would not
include those with less than eight
such positions; or because fraterni
ties may be considered part of an
educational institutions as campus
dining halls, and thus not be taxed.
Wayne Richardson, Jack Benian,
and Bob Adams were elected stu
j dent members of Interfraternity
| Board for the coming year.
