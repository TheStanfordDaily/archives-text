## 
### 
The filtration of a hitherto non
filterable virus, along with the iso
lation of a previously undiscovered
element, has been accomplished at
Stanford after three years' research.
The results will be announced next
Friday.
The researcn was not conducted
within the confines of a laboratory's
walls, but included a whole univer-

sity. The results were not tabulated
in a scientist's office, but in the
Stanford Daily office 011 a new kind
of Bunsen burner known as the Un
derwood Standard.
The virus i.s a combination of the
love-bug, the St. Anford Dance, and
the down-the-highway itch, the new
element is more redundantly known
as Stanford life, ft will be included
in a monograph, whose title is as
yet unannounced, by the research
assistant, whose name, "Our Hash
er," has appeared on the edit page
of the past six volumes of The Daily.
The discovery is presented in
graphic form which will be 184 pages
long, will be paper-bound, and will
include almost all of the material
collected from day to day in the col
umn, rearranged according to topics.
Final examinations will be given
June 5-9.
