# The 						Daily's Cameraman Takes a Final Examination
## 
### 
Not finals, just a term paper. It's one thing after another. Finish your midquarters and it's
time to pay syllabus fees. Somewhere in that so-called breathing space between the day when
bills "are due and payable" and "end-quarter examinations" begin, term papers are due and
presentable.
This journalism senior, aping a press service teleprinter, typed his output on a single con
tinuous sheet. From his position it got him down literally as well as figuratively. Below an
other student is down—also literally. Not for the'count, just taking a breathing space in the
middle of one of those four-hour, four-star finals.
She is getting a break, though, it's one of those rare things at Stanford, an open book ex
amination.

INIot because funny pictures are most entertaining, but because the pictures on this
page represent a cross-section of how-Stanford-students-act, Daily staff photographer
Tro Harper printed these up for a special page dedicated to that medieval hangover
the final examination. It shows, among other things, that Stanford students have an al
lergy for sleep, and that they show remark able intelligence in taking short cuts.
The whole business is barbaric, and a most ineffective way of determining how
much a student knows. The students admit it. The professors admit it. Yet the system
goes on, making everyone miserable largely because no one has had the courage to
stop it.
Let this be your final examination about final examinations. The gory details are all
on this page. Remember 'em when you sit on the Board of Trustees.

This is the examination that was never taken—the ex
aminee that was never examined. In the afternoon he will
see his prof, explain that his alarm clock didn't work, ar
range for a makeup.
Of what is he dreaming?
Perhaps a school where there are no examinations, no
eight o'clocks, in a country where alarm clock manufactur
ers would go out of business. But he's only dreaming.

Piled high on the desk these blue books in the picture at the left are the
results, the supposed epitome, of 10 weeks study. With no aid given or re
ceived scrawled on the cover, they represent a standard 20 hours study per
unit. Readers complain they represent the students' ability to guff. Both
readers and students agree they represent a headache. The reader above
is getting his headache now, a sort of delayed hangover of the students' in
tellectual spree of a few hours before. His standard equipment he holds in
his left hand -a blue pencil.

Getting in a little ground work, a preparation vulgarly called cramming.
Heads together these women typify a point of procedure around which heated
discussion rages. Cynics claim that free interchange of opinions and learning
in a collective study seance degenerates into a Stanford institution- a bull ses
sion, which in turn might be defined as a free interchange of non-academic
opinions. Standard time for the discussion to go from F.D.R.'s latest trick to
sex is 20 minutes in a fraternity. Sorority statistics are lacking.

Making use of a Stanford tradition these men do their studying on the Quad in one the
traditionally unlocked rooms. Here they burn the midnight juice not oil. The oil have
been applying carefully all quarter, on the professor's ego, they hope. Like smoking there
is no bullsessioning on the Quad, silence is enforced by tacit consent. Sometime i! t ''' 11
o'clock these students will pick up their books and straggle up to the cellar for a little mild
stimulant a coke or a coffee and a little of the neglected bulling before they call it a day.

This journalism senior, aping a press service teleprinter, typed his output on a single con
tinuous sheet. From his position it got him down literally as well as figuratively. Below an
other student is down—also literally. Not for the'count, just taking a breathing space in the
middle of one of those four-hour, four-star finals.
She is getting a break, though, it's one of those rare things at Stanford, an open book ex
amination.

INIot because funny pictures are most entertaining, but because the pictures on this
page represent a cross-section of how-Stanford-students-act, Daily staff photographer
Tro Harper printed these up for a special page dedicated to that medieval hangover
the final examination. It shows, among other things, that Stanford students have an al
lergy for sleep, and that they show remark able intelligence in taking short cuts.
The whole business is barbaric, and a most ineffective way of determining how
much a student knows. The students admit it. The professors admit it. Yet the system
goes on, making everyone miserable largely because no one has had the courage to
stop it.
Let this be your final examination about final examinations. The gory details are all
on this page. Remember 'em when you sit on the Board of Trustees.

This is the examination that was never taken—the ex
aminee that was never examined. In the afternoon he will
see his prof, explain that his alarm clock didn't work, ar
range for a makeup.
Of what is he dreaming?
Perhaps a school where there are no examinations, no
eight o'clocks, in a country where alarm clock manufactur
ers would go out of business. But he's only dreaming.

Piled high on the desk these blue books in the picture at the left are the
results, the supposed epitome, of 10 weeks study. With no aid given or re
ceived scrawled on the cover, they represent a standard 20 hours study per
unit. Readers complain they represent the students' ability to guff. Both
readers and students agree they represent a headache. The reader above
is getting his headache now, a sort of delayed hangover of the students' in
tellectual spree of a few hours before. His standard equipment he holds in
his left hand -a blue pencil.

Getting in a little ground work, a preparation vulgarly called cramming.
Heads together these women typify a point of procedure around which heated
discussion rages. Cynics claim that free interchange of opinions and learning
in a collective study seance degenerates into a Stanford institution- a bull ses
sion, which in turn might be defined as a free interchange of non-academic
opinions. Standard time for the discussion to go from F.D.R.'s latest trick to
sex is 20 minutes in a fraternity. Sorority statistics are lacking.

Making use of a Stanford tradition these men do their studying on the Quad in one the
traditionally unlocked rooms. Here they burn the midnight juice not oil. The oil have
been applying carefully all quarter, on the professor's ego, they hope. Like smoking there
is no bullsessioning on the Quad, silence is enforced by tacit consent. Sometime i! t ''' 11
o'clock these students will pick up their books and straggle up to the cellar for a little mild
stimulant a coke or a coffee and a little of the neglected bulling before they call it a day.







IT'S THROUGH AS THEATER, BUT WESTERN CIV FINALS GO ON. SITTING IN UNCOMFORTABLE ASSEMBLY HALL SEAT!:


Not finals, just a term paper. It's one thing after another. Finish your midquarters and it's
time to pay syllabus fees. Somewhere in that so-called breathing space between the day when
bills "are due and payable" and "end-quarter examinations" begin, term papers are due and
presentable.
