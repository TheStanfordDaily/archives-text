# Card Trackmen Go to L.A. For Conference Tilt
## Trojans, Cougars Favored with Indians; Stanford Team Enters N.C,A.A., Big 10 Meet after Finals 
### PHIL KLAUBEK 
Fifteen stalwarts of Coach Dink Tcmpleton's Stanford track team left
on the Lark last night for Los Angeles and the Pacific Coast Conference
meet, tomorrow's rubber match with the L'.S.C. Trojans, which will be
kibitzed by Washington State, northern division champs.
All ten teams of the conference will be represented, with 5-4-3-2-1
scoring holding sway. The Trojans have licked Stanford in dual meet

'competition, while Stanford defeated
U.S.C. at Fresno. Washington State,
after a strong showing in Seattle last
week, is right up in the odds with
the former two.
Entries Limited
All teams have been limited to 15
entrants, and coaches are to scratch
their entries down to this figure at a
meeting tomorrow morning. Actual
competition will start at 2:15 and will
be broadcast locally over KFRC.
Captain Bill McCurdy will lead
the Cards into their last competition
before finalsâ€”he will enter the 880
against Bush and Palmason, who
have both broken 1:52 already, and
will run a lap on the relay.
Weiershauser to Run
Jack Weiershauser will have a
full clay as usual, probably going into
the 100, low hurdles, and relay. Jim
Kneubuhl and Stan Hiserman also
will enter the sprints, and will re
ceive chief competition from Mushy
Pollock, Adrian Talley, and Lec
Orr, the northern division champ.
Bob Alexander is supposed to have
a coat race in the mile, and Ed
Burrows, after his 9:34 practice this
week, should finish well up in the
two - mile. The other Stanford
strength division is the weights,
where Jim Reynolds, Tom Mont
gomery, Pete Zagar, Hugh Gribbin,
and A1 Hershey are developing into
the solid front that used to be
a standard characteristic of Stanford
teams. Foskett of Oregon in the
shot, and Gaspar of U.S.C. in the dis
cus will be the outside threats.
Close Race Seen
The quarter-mile threatens to be
a world-beater, as Benke of W.S.O.
has 46.9 to his credit, while Ray Ma
lott and Weiershauser of Stanford
and Bob Young of U.C.L.A. are all
close to that mark, and rarely de
feated.
Norman "Ick" Morrison, Temple
ton's No. 1 high jumper, will tangle
with Thurber of U.S.C. and Van
dermay of Washington, both of whom
are a couple of inches ahead of him,
but stands an excellent chance to
place. Johnny Hewitt and Bill
Hawkins, hurdlers, complete the
Stanford team.
Big Ten Meet
Competition does not end this
week for the Card runners, as the
| first three place winners in tomor
! I'ow's meet will tangle with a simi
lar group determined at the Big Ten
championships in the Middle West
i last week; the Big Ten-Pacific Coast
meet will be held in the Los Ange
les Coliseum June 12.
Following that, the N.C.A.A.. the
j all-American collegiate classic, will
be held in Edwards Field, Berkeley,
on June 19.
