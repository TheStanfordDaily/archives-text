Daily staff members today re
linquish their typewriters to
study for finals, according to
University regulations.
Some few will indeed crack
books, but the majority will
cram for Poker 1 and Liquid
Disposal 3.
Last night at midnight, this,
the last issue of the year, went
to bed. But not the staff. For
at 12:01 this morning began
that traditional, continuous
game of blackjack that lasts till
cap and gown time.
Earlier, Editor Bob Eisen
bach celebrated his release from
duty with an ice cream and
cooky party for the staff.
