# News Photographs Highlight Our Stanford Year
## 
### 
The World's pole vault record was completely demolished by Bill Sefton and Earle Mead
ows of U.S.C. who swung over the cross bar at 14 . 8 Va" to jointly establish a new mark on May
8. Sefton is shown clearing the record height in the Stanford stadium pit, where attacks on the
record have repeatedly been so successful that vaulters are talking about the Stanford luck.

The Nitery (above) opened.last Wednesday night marking the successful climax of a Stan
ford Daily editorial campaign. Canoe Tilting (below) becomes the order as Juniors stage their
annual Lake Lagunita water carnival on April 23.

The curtain drops on another year of Stanford Life, a year
punctuated with achievements and vitality. Stanford builds
and at the same time new faces appear and old ones fade.
The mud fight is banned and the king-queen contest, for sev
eral years gold mine of the Convalescent Home Drive, is
outlawed.
The Memorial Hall theater takes form, becomes a part of
the Stanford skyline; the Laurence Frost Amphitheater is con
ceived, built, and named within the year; the Cubberley Edu
cation Building is begun; and new wings are added to Lagu
nita to provide finest of living conditions for Stanford's women.
Activity on the Stanford newsfront comes when freshmen
riot at the annual Pajamarino, when the Big Game bonfire is
saved by detection of a California bomb, when the Convales
cent Home Drive is pronounced both financial and popular
success.

When spring takes over the Farm, the D.U's take to their pool
for a bit of water and sunlight (above) and the mowing machine
comes out of the barn to lay low the fields of so-called hay behind
the libe (below).
In the view below, Tro Harper contrasts the sleek streamlines
of modern automotive design to the rugged horse-drawn mowing
machine, and powerful lines of the red-roofed library all three
integral parts of the Stanford world.

These days are gone forever, as the Mudfight takes to the trail of
the Plug Ugly and King-Queen Contest- Stanford traditions that have
outlived their usefullness. Clad in laundry bags and trunks the fresh
man-sophomore forces looked like this last fall.

Pledge day for men arrives, and the Encinite makes his trip
to see the official lawyer, states his choice, is told "yes, you have a
card," and leaves; soon to join the fraternity trail and go up the Row
for a three year sojourn with the Greek letter men.
