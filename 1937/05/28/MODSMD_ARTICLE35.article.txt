# Coutts' Tunnel To Be Closed By Paul Hanna
## Frenchman Quits Farm After French Pardon, Dies in Parisian Home 
### 
If the ghost of Peter Coutts is shut
up in some secret cell deep under
Mystery Hill, it will be imprisoned
there forever; for heavy wooden
gates will close the mouth of the
Frenchman's tunnel sometime soon.
The cave has been branded dan
gerous by Dr. Paul R. Hanna, asso
ciate professor of education, whose
lease to the ground near its en
trance would make him liable for
injuries incurred by anyone explor
ing the tunnel.
Will Open Tunnel
However, Dr. Ilanna is a Coutts
fartatic, like so many other Stan
forditcs, and upon request he will
open the gates to explorers willing
to investigate at their own risk. And
by clearing out caved-in portions,
he hopes to further the interest of
the tunnel and perhaps to add to
the knowledge concerning Stanford's
most romantic figure.
But the ghost of Peter Coutts docs
not, as some would have it, lie con
fined in Mystery Hill.
Voyages to Franco
The invalid Mmc. Coutts was not
fond of the rustic valley her husband
found so beautiful, and she missed
France and the company of her Pari
sian friends far more than he.
So during Coutts' residence here
(1874-82), he made two voyages to
England in order to arrange for his
pardon and return to France. The
second trip was made in 1880 in the
company of a San Francisco friend,
a Mr. Koenig, and the latter's son
Charles was educated in France at
Coutts' expense and is now a lead
ing eye specialist in Paris.
Receives Pardon
Sometime after Coutts had come
back to Ayrshire Farm, he received
permission to return to France. His
pardon was secured mainly through
the efforts of his cousin, Baroness
Burdctte-Coutts, said by Edward VII
to be the second most influential En
glishwomen of her time (Queen Vic
toria being the first).
That he was pardoned and allowed
to return proves conclusively that
Coutts had been forced to flee France
in 1872 for reasons purely political,
not criminal.
Never Returns
When he and Mine. Coutts started
for France with their two children;
Albert and Marguerite, in 1882, it
was supposed that he would return
to continue building the Ayrshire

estate. But he never came back.
Consul Brings News
However, according to testimony
of C. E. Murdick, Mayfield express
man during Coutts' residence here,
the consul was admitted to the
house and talked with the French
man over an hour. It was then that
trunks were ordered packed, and
the family left the following morn
ing.
Probable it is that the consul
brought news of Coutts' pardon, for
none of his personal belongings were
jacked, and servants were told he
would return shortly after escorting

I his wife to Europe.
Dies in Paris
They stayed in Brussels a short
time, completing arrangements for
| their return to France, and then
j journeyed on to Paris. Soon after
| warcls Coutts built a castle at Evairi
ies-Bains of the same design as his
I proposed Ayrshire mansion.
It is called the Chateau du Marte
let, and it stands today testifying to
Coutts' love for the medieval. There
I he lived until 1888 at which time he
I moved to his Parisian town house
! following the death of his daughter.
He died two years later, aged 68.
