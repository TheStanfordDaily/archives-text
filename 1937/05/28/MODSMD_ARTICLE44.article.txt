# Annual Battle To Culminate Grid Practice
## Divided Squad Will Play In Tomorrow's Spring Game; Admission Free 
### 
Culminating seven Weeks of spring
practice, spring grid candidates will
go to war against each other in the
annual Spring Game to be played
in the stadium tomorrow afternoon
at 2:15. There will be no admission
charge.
The squad has been divided into
Reds and Whites. Each team has
practiced separately for a week, and
each has developed its own plays.
Thornhill to Watch
Bobby Grayson will coach the
"White Trash," as they are known
to the Reds, while Jim Lawson will
pilot the "Ha If-Breeds." Coaches
Tiny Thornhill and Ben Winkleman
will be on the sidelines scouting for
next fall's material.
Jack Clark and Grant Stone will
be on the White flanks, with Leo
Ferko and Jack Walton, a veteran
with renewed fire* this year, at
guards. Louis Tsoutsovas, who
missed only 14 minutes of play last
fall, probably will be in the Whites'
pivot post, although Haffner may
play. Andersen and Krfimer will be
at tackles.
Coffis, Paulman to Start
Jimmy Coffis, idol of safety men,
will start at Whites' left half, and
Bill Paulman, star of the 1935 team
whose injury early last fall kept
him out the whole season, will be on
the field to show that his ankle is
cured and that he is again in shape
to kick and pass for the Indians.
Following the game, the gfidders
will adjourn to the Buck-of-the-
Month Club barbecue at Searsville
Lake.
