Leaping six feet with an ear-splitting crack, this million \ : charge will d
more than make this beautiful picture. Perhaps it has broken an insulator that
would have failed to support a power-line on some lonely Sierra peak, had not
its hidden defects been found in Stanford's high-voltage laL )ratory. Endowed
by large public utilities, University engineers test power equipment in their
special laboratory, and have contributed mightily to the development of power
transmission.
Possessing one of the largest transformer assem: lies in the West, Ryan Lab
determines what Lest shall serve the public:. It's a business in itself, a new kind
of general store on the horizon of this state's business domain selling brains
and the evidences of the laboratory to lead men to a better life.
