Swamping Sigma Alpha Epsilon
11-0, Kappa Sigma became Intra
mural baseball champs yesterday
after a winning season of league
play.
Until the fifth inning the game was
a pitching battle between Kappa
Sigma's Heringer and S.A.E.'s Pop
Barsocchini. Then it changed to a
slugging field day for Kappa Sigma's

batters. They got five runs in that
period, four in the next and two in
the last.
Errors Help to Win
Of Kappa Sigma's eleven runs, only
two were earned —the other nine
coming as a result of errors made
by S.A.E. baseballers.
S.A.E.'s greatest asset was stocky,
hard-pitching Pop Barsocchini. Their
greatest deficit was their dearth of
batters who could hit a ball past the
pitcher. Heringer, brother of Stan
ford's famous pitcher of two seasons
ago, was outstanding for Kappa Sig.
He pitched the balls where S.A.E.
couldn't touch them, and scored one
man on his single in the fifth in
ning, coming home himself later.
