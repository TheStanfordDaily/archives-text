IT WAS AT THE FRESNO RELAYS that Shove, Hables, Hables, and Eastman set the world's record for
the mile relay. Two weeks ago Jimmy Kneubuhl, Ray Malott, Stan Hiserman, and Jack Weiershauser, left
to right, set another world mark in the half-mile relay at the same Raisin City oval, in 1:25 flat. (Photo
