BY WAY OF
FINALE—
To start with, in the final clean
up, let's lake a look at the sports
situation for next year.
Football, of course, is the big thing
to look forward to. Tiny Thornhill
is going to have a pretty good crew
to work with, and in spite of the
fact that he is going 1o have 18 re
turning lettermen to build the Big
Red Machine around, Stanford is go
ing to be one of the big question/
marks in Coast football this fall.
Much depends upon Bill Paul
man. and perhaps the newcomer,
Jim Groves, who shows promise of
being very dangerous. With a vir
tually intact line, even strength
ened by the addition of the giant
Stan Andersen at tackle to bal
ance Fete Zagar and a creditable
crew of reserves, any one of which
might develop into a sensation,
Tiny will have most of his worries
over the backficld.
If Paulman doesn't fall to an in
jury again, and there is no reason
why he should any more than any
one else, he will be one of the best
backs on the Coast. His passing, his
1 kicking, his blocking will be three
of Stanford's greatest assets.
Jim Groves has demonstrated
enough speed and power in prac
tice this spring to give him the
fullback spot over Brigharn and
Hamilton, and if he keeps it up
throughout the fall Tiny will have
little more to ask from him.
Jimmy Coffis at left half is tried
and true—there won't be any games
in which he doesn't play at least 50
minutes, and there won't be any
| body anyplace who is trying any
harder, no matter where you look.
The right half spot is a question
! mark, too, for Joe Vigna and Bill
Kirsch will put on a savage battle
for that position. Joe as a defensive
man is pretty hard to beat, and if
he can hold up steadily enough on
offense to match Kirsch he probably
| will start lots of the games. Kirsch
is a better blocker than Joe, they
' say, but the two are so even in most
departments that Tiny should have
great trouble chosing between them.
There are several others, too,
who will be heard from — Doc
Luckctt, the fiery little Texan
, who's always in there pitching;
Tom Collins, a rugged, fast boy
who might surprise a lot of peo
ple; Pete Fay, the wiry speed de
mon who can take anything they
want to dish cut; Tony Calvelli,
1 who wavers between full and cen
ter but who would make one of
the sweetest right halves you'd
ever want to see, on his blocking,
passing, and punting ability; Jake
Brigham and Glenn Hamilton, two
steady fullbacks who can pass and
kick and run—oh, there is plenty
of material for Thornhill to build
with.
BRIGHT DAYS AHEAD
FOR KANSAN JOHN
Basketball is the next biggest
sport to follow football, and in that
there can be nothing but cheer. With
Luisetti back for what will be his
last and probably greatest year of
varsity competition, and backed by
Calderwood and Stoefen, the Zonne
brothers, the Lyon brothers, Tom
, Siebert, Leon Lafaille, Will Ander

son, Gil Rahn, Beeb Lee, and a
more, John Bunn shouldn't have j
much to worry about.
The team will- again make a tour
of the East, so let's wish Smiling
John the best of luck and be con- i
lident that he and his boys will
cnce more stride unsparingly !
through the best that (he eastern !
and mid-western schools can offer
in competition.
The conference should be all Stan
ford for the third year in a row, to 1
close up a glorious career for not j
□nly Hank Luisetti but also Jack
Calderwood and Stork Stoefen and |
the others who have gone the route!
with the marvelous Italian.
RELY ON THE DINK,
HIS TEAM WILL BE O.K.
As for track, there won't be Jack
Weiershauser, Bill McCurdy, Bob
Alexander, Norm Morrison, Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, Hugh Grib
bin, Chuck Voight, or Swede Carl
son back to perform for Templeton,
but with some brilliant frosh com
ing up and probably a few jaysee
transfers, the Boy Coach is going to
have another pretty fair outfit.
An intact sprint crew except for
Weiershauser, strength in the 440,
BXO, two-mile, and hurdles, and a
probable even balance in the field
is what Dink will have to start oIT
with, and when he has that much
you can figure he will have a
track team.
After seeing what Dink did with
the outfit he had to begin with this
year, I'm ready to believe he can
do almost anything with track men.
AND IN THE
OTHER SPORTS
Nort Thornton will have a good
water polo team, and a better swim
ming team next year, but the com
petition his teams will have to meet
will also be very good, so Stanford
will have no corner on the tradi
tionally Stanford - tinted swimming
racket.
THANK
YOU
With that taken care of, now I
wish to shortly and sweetly offer my
thanks to those who helped and tol
erated me for the length of the vol
ume. To mention one name would
necessitate mentioning all, and that
would be too lengthy. I know who
I want to thank, and those I want to
thank know who they are, so let's
let it go at that.
BON
VOYAGE
To the incoming sports editor,
Gene Gear, I offer congrats and
wish him luck in putting out sports
for the fall volume. He'll do a good
job. So long.

ever want to see, on his blocking,
passing, and punting ability; Jake
Brigham and Glenn Hamilton, two
steady fullbacks who can pass and
kick and run—oh, there is plenty
of material for Thornhill to build
with.
BRIGHT DAYS AHEAD
FOR KANSAN JOHN
Basketball is the next biggest
sport to follow football, and in that
there can be nothing but cheer. With
Luisetti back for what will be his
last and probably greatest year of
varsity competition, and backed by
Calderwood and Stoefen, the Zonne
brothers, the Lyon brothers, Tom
, Siebert, Leon Lafaille, Will Ander

son, Gil Rahn, Beeb Lee, and a
more, John Bunn shouldn't have j
much to worry about.
The team will- again make a tour
of the East, so let's wish Smiling
John the best of luck and be con- i
lident that he and his boys will
cnce more stride unsparingly !
through the best that (he eastern !
and mid-western schools can offer
in competition.
The conference should be all Stan
ford for the third year in a row, to 1
close up a glorious career for not j
□nly Hank Luisetti but also Jack
Calderwood and Stork Stoefen and |
the others who have gone the route!
with the marvelous Italian.
RELY ON THE DINK,
HIS TEAM WILL BE O.K.
As for track, there won't be Jack
Weiershauser, Bill McCurdy, Bob
Alexander, Norm Morrison, Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, Hugh Grib
bin, Chuck Voight, or Swede Carl
son back to perform for Templeton,
but with some brilliant frosh com
ing up and probably a few jaysee
transfers, the Boy Coach is going to
have another pretty fair outfit.
An intact sprint crew except for
Weiershauser, strength in the 440,
BXO, two-mile, and hurdles, and a
probable even balance in the field
is what Dink will have to start oIT
with, and when he has that much
you can figure he will have a
track team.
After seeing what Dink did with
the outfit he had to begin with this
year, I'm ready to believe he can
do almost anything with track men.
AND IN THE
OTHER SPORTS
Nort Thornton will have a good
water polo team, and a better swim
ming team next year, but the com
petition his teams will have to meet
will also be very good, so Stanford
will have no corner on the tradi
tionally Stanford - tinted swimming
racket.
THANK
YOU
With that taken care of, now I
wish to shortly and sweetly offer my
thanks to those who helped and tol
erated me for the length of the vol
ume. To mention one name would
necessitate mentioning all, and that
would be too lengthy. I know who
I want to thank, and those I want to
thank know who they are, so let's
let it go at that.

BY WAY OF
FINALE—
To start with, in the final clean
up, let's lake a look at the sports
situation for next year.
Football, of course, is the big thing
to look forward to. Tiny Thornhill
is going to have a pretty good crew
to work with, and in spite of the
fact that he is going 1o have 18 re
turning lettermen to build the Big
Red Machine around, Stanford is go
ing to be one of the big question/
marks in Coast football this fall.
Much depends upon Bill Paul
man. and perhaps the newcomer,
Jim Groves, who shows promise of
being very dangerous. With a vir
tually intact line, even strength
ened by the addition of the giant
Stan Andersen at tackle to bal
ance Fete Zagar and a creditable
crew of reserves, any one of which
might develop into a sensation,
Tiny will have most of his worries
over the backficld.
If Paulman doesn't fall to an in
jury again, and there is no reason
why he should any more than any
one else, he will be one of the best
backs on the Coast. His passing, his
1 kicking, his blocking will be three
of Stanford's greatest assets.
Jim Groves has demonstrated
enough speed and power in prac
tice this spring to give him the
fullback spot over Brigharn and
Hamilton, and if he keeps it up
throughout the fall Tiny will have
little more to ask from him.
Jimmy Coffis at left half is tried
and true—there won't be any games
in which he doesn't play at least 50
minutes, and there won't be any
| body anyplace who is trying any
harder, no matter where you look.
The right half spot is a question
! mark, too, for Joe Vigna and Bill
Kirsch will put on a savage battle
for that position. Joe as a defensive
man is pretty hard to beat, and if
he can hold up steadily enough on
offense to match Kirsch he probably
| will start lots of the games. Kirsch
is a better blocker than Joe, they
' say, but the two are so even in most
departments that Tiny should have
great trouble chosing between them.
There are several others, too,
who will be heard from — Doc
Luckctt, the fiery little Texan
, who's always in there pitching;
Tom Collins, a rugged, fast boy
who might surprise a lot of peo
ple; Pete Fay, the wiry speed de
mon who can take anything they
want to dish cut; Tony Calvelli,
1 who wavers between full and cen
ter but who would make one of
the sweetest right halves you'd
ever want to see, on his blocking,
passing, and punting ability; Jake
Brigham and Glenn Hamilton, two
steady fullbacks who can pass and
kick and run—oh, there is plenty

To the incoming sports editor,

for the fall volume. He'll do a good

—Peterson
BY WAY OF
FINALE—
To start with, in the final clean
up, let's lake a look at the sports
situation for next year.
Football, of course, is the big thing
to look forward to. Tiny Thornhill
is going to have a pretty good crew
to work with, and in spite of the
fact that he is going 1o have 18 re
turning lettermen to build the Big
Red Machine around, Stanford is go
ing to be one of the big question/
marks in Coast football this fall.
Much depends upon Bill Paul
man. and perhaps the newcomer,
Jim Groves, who shows promise of
being very dangerous. With a vir
tually intact line, even strength
ened by the addition of the giant
Stan Andersen at tackle to bal
ance Fete Zagar and a creditable
crew of reserves, any one of which
might develop into a sensation,
Tiny will have most of his worries
over the backficld.
If Paulman doesn't fall to an in
jury again, and there is no reason
why he should any more than any
one else, he will be one of the best
backs on the Coast. His passing, his
1 kicking, his blocking will be three
of Stanford's greatest assets.
Jim Groves has demonstrated
enough speed and power in prac
tice this spring to give him the
fullback spot over Brigharn and
Hamilton, and if he keeps it up
throughout the fall Tiny will have
little more to ask from him.
Jimmy Coffis at left half is tried
and true—there won't be any games
in which he doesn't play at least 50
minutes, and there won't be any
| body anyplace who is trying any
harder, no matter where you look.
The right half spot is a question
! mark, too, for Joe Vigna and Bill
Kirsch will put on a savage battle
for that position. Joe as a defensive
man is pretty hard to beat, and if
he can hold up steadily enough on
offense to match Kirsch he probably
| will start lots of the games. Kirsch
is a better blocker than Joe, they
' say, but the two are so even in most
departments that Tiny should have
great trouble chosing between them.
There are several others, too,
who will be heard from — Doc
Luckctt, the fiery little Texan
, who's always in there pitching;
Tom Collins, a rugged, fast boy
who might surprise a lot of peo
ple; Pete Fay, the wiry speed de
mon who can take anything they
want to dish cut; Tony Calvelli,
1 who wavers between full and cen
ter but who would make one of
the sweetest right halves you'd
ever want to see, on his blocking,
passing, and punting ability; Jake
Brigham and Glenn Hamilton, two
steady fullbacks who can pass and
kick and run—oh, there is plenty
of material for Thornhill to build
with.
BRIGHT DAYS AHEAD
FOR KANSAN JOHN
Basketball is the next biggest
sport to follow football, and in that
there can be nothing but cheer. With
Luisetti back for what will be his
last and probably greatest year of
varsity competition, and backed by
Calderwood and Stoefen, the Zonne
brothers, the Lyon brothers, Tom
, Siebert, Leon Lafaille, Will Ander

son, Gil Rahn, Beeb Lee, and a
more, John Bunn shouldn't have j
much to worry about.
The team will- again make a tour
of the East, so let's wish Smiling
John the best of luck and be con- i
lident that he and his boys will
cnce more stride unsparingly !
through the best that (he eastern !
and mid-western schools can offer
in competition.
The conference should be all Stan
ford for the third year in a row, to 1
close up a glorious career for not j
□nly Hank Luisetti but also Jack
Calderwood and Stork Stoefen and |
the others who have gone the route!
with the marvelous Italian.
RELY ON THE DINK,
HIS TEAM WILL BE O.K.
As for track, there won't be Jack
Weiershauser, Bill McCurdy, Bob
Alexander, Norm Morrison, Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, Hugh Grib
bin, Chuck Voight, or Swede Carl
son back to perform for Templeton,
but with some brilliant frosh com
ing up and probably a few jaysee
transfers, the Boy Coach is going to
have another pretty fair outfit.
An intact sprint crew except for
Weiershauser, strength in the 440,
BXO, two-mile, and hurdles, and a
probable even balance in the field
is what Dink will have to start oIT
with, and when he has that much
you can figure he will have a
track team.
After seeing what Dink did with
the outfit he had to begin with this
year, I'm ready to believe he can
do almost anything with track men.
AND IN THE
OTHER SPORTS
Nort Thornton will have a good
water polo team, and a better swim
ming team next year, but the com
petition his teams will have to meet
will also be very good, so Stanford
will have no corner on the tradi
tionally Stanford - tinted swimming
racket.
