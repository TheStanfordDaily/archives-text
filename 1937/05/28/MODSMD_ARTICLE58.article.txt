# Dear Stanford:
## 
### 
Twenty years from now I want to step out
of my Hispano Suiza and make another
check payable—a good big one. I'll do it even
if I have to stand in line before a wicket in the
Ad Building and gel stamped.
For even though your salesroom tactics v/ere
unpleasant, you have the goods.
There are a very few places that have them.
But I've often wondered if your expressed con
sciousness of Stanford's worth and its students'
unimportance, was good business on your part.
It's a small matter, this matier of a student's
personal ego, but it's something to be consid
ered as long as Stanford must look to her chil
dren for occasional help.
It's often occurred to me that there might be
a definite correlation between the "pay lip and
shut up" stereotype in present students' minds,
and the tightness of their hold on the purse
strings later in life.
Naturally, when we stop to think about it, we
can understand that Stanford can't bow us in
and out of the Ad Building like a maitre-d'hotel.
We can also realize that we are paying a mere
fraction of our cost to the University.
But your own psychology department will tell
you that the stereotypes derived from unpleas
ant impact on the ego are proof against so-called
rational thought.
I believe this is the case with your students.
If you would sneak into a fraternity living room,
the cellar lobby, a Toyon bull session, you might
recognize Stanford's student policy as psycho
logical personifications of Shylock and Satan.
It would open your eyes, I'm sure, to a condi
tion that is neither desirable nor necessary, but
which exists simply because no one has con
sidered it important enough to eradicate.
The Administration's assumption that stu
dents, those of any one generation, are unim
portant, is undoubtedly correct. In the long-run
perspective, they are minutiae.
And this may be a valid reason for not work
ing out a more pleasant co-operative approach,
particularly as regards student activities.
But I've always questioned the advisability
of letting anyone know that you consider them
unimportant.
Rationally, we ought to know that we are un
important. But emotionally we can't stomach '
the fact. Forcing it down our gullets will not
make it stay there.
Nor can it conceivably make us feel kindly j
toward Stanford, the Administration, though it |
can never influence our affection for Stanford, j
the University.
The thing that might be changed is nothing j
specific. If I quote your sign "Make Checks
Payable," and suggest you change it to
"Please Make Checks Payable," I would merely
convey the idea of what I mean, not a sugges
tion for a definite change.
It's a business of attitude of letting the stu- j
dents, unimportant as they are, feel that they
are "somebody" so far as the University is con- j
cerned.
You might call it flattery. But it might pay !
dividends—in twenty years.
Sincerely,
Bob

ing out a more pleasant co-operative approach,
particularly as regards student activities.
But I've always questioned the advisability
of letting anyone know that you consider them
unimportant.
Rationally, we ought to know that we are un
important. But emotionally we can't stomach '
the fact. Forcing it down our gullets will not
make it stay there.
Nor can it conceivably make us feel kindly j
toward Stanford, the Administration, though it |
can never influence our affection for Stanford, j
the University.
The thing that might be changed is nothing j
specific. If I quote your sign "Make Checks
Payable," and suggest you change it to
"Please Make Checks Payable," I would merely
convey the idea of what I mean, not a sugges
tion for a definite change.
It's a business of attitude of letting the stu- j
dents, unimportant as they are, feel that they
are "somebody" so far as the University is con- j
cerned.
You might call it flattery. But it might pay !
dividends—in twenty years.
Sincerely,
Bob
Twenty years from now I want to step out
of my Hispano Suiza and make another
check payable—a good big one. I'll do it even
if I have to stand in line before a wicket in the
Ad Building and gel stamped.
For even though your salesroom tactics v/ere
unpleasant, you have the goods.
There are a very few places that have them.
But I've often wondered if your expressed con
sciousness of Stanford's worth and its students'
unimportance, was good business on your part.
It's a small matter, this matier of a student's
personal ego, but it's something to be consid
ered as long as Stanford must look to her chil
dren for occasional help.
It's often occurred to me that there might be
a definite correlation between the "pay lip and
shut up" stereotype in present students' minds,
and the tightness of their hold on the purse
strings later in life.
Naturally, when we stop to think about it, we
can understand that Stanford can't bow us in
and out of the Ad Building like a maitre-d'hotel.
We can also realize that we are paying a mere
fraction of our cost to the University.
But your own psychology department will tell
you that the stereotypes derived from unpleas
ant impact on the ego are proof against so-called
rational thought.
I believe this is the case with your students.
If you would sneak into a fraternity living room,
the cellar lobby, a Toyon bull session, you might
recognize Stanford's student policy as psycho
logical personifications of Shylock and Satan.
It would open your eyes, I'm sure, to a condi
tion that is neither desirable nor necessary, but
which exists simply because no one has con
sidered it important enough to eradicate.
The Administration's assumption that stu
dents, those of any one generation, are unim
portant, is undoubtedly correct. In the long-run
perspective, they are minutiae.
And this may be a valid reason for not work
ing out a more pleasant co-operative approach,
particularly as regards student activities.
