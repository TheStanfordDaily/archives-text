Dear Gordy
Well, fella, you did it. I'm not going to wear j
out Bailey's patience making him set a lot of :
stuff about the kind of an Editor I think you'll j
be. You've got to be good, otherwise you [
wouldn't have made the grade in every de
partment of this rag. You get the thanks of the 1
whole staff for some fine writing and some of
the best organizing that's been done in the ;
Shack since way back when.
You have no doubt, nor have I, that Lloyd i
Lapham, the calm guy off the desk of the Sacra
mento Union, and Johnny Rice, the excitable guy
from St. Louis are going to be Associate Editors
worthy of that title. As for Suzanne Ham
mond, she'll manage with a capital "M" and
Margaret Loud is going to smile more than one
tryoutee onto the assignment sheet.
Art Stokes, fresh from some professional work
on the Modesto Bee, will be there when Charlie i
yells and the Blue Streak gets hunger pangs.
Running the night desk you'll have John i
Cobbs, cool as a julep, Corena Crase who comes
from Petaluma where they make a business of
making good eggs, Silent Bill Millis, Walt Peter
son fresh off Angell Field, Barbara Rosenblatt j
with and without chewing gufn, Jim Stone of
the Dramatic Council Stones, and Phil Klauber
and Herb Diamond, Deans of tho sport dope
sheets,

Gene Gear will mesh with sports, as will
Shallie, his sidekick. Harry Press has the right
name for his job on UP desk. And we musn't
forget Rita Szekeres, who intends to hit a few
bull's eyes in the feature department as well as
on the rifle range, or Allen Drury in Review
Editorship, or Bill Moses.
And don't forget those lower-classmen,
Jaques and Rip Van Winkle, Lyman Wear—
and the four horsemen, Dudman, Alward, Liv
ingstone and Lurie—and Jean Toffee, v/ho's
also done her stint in a big-time Daily with
Lloyd Lapham, Phyllis White, Bob Glikbarg
and right on down to Jean Valjean and his
manhole covers.
As for myself, all I can say is thanks for the
damndest three years of newspapering that
ever were.
Now, please tell Tinney's to come get me.
Love,
