The new eyes of science beat Nature's old ones, as this infra-red ph< iph
from the top of the psych building testifies. Getting a picture like this
question of wave lengths. Infra-red rays are next to heat, and way b -w
out of the sight range and into the range of feeling.
Quad Photograher Ed Steinheimer carried his plates on ice, x:
whole seconds to get this unusual shot.
The day this picture was taken, the human observer could nt
Santa Cruz mountains so perfectly defined here. Even Dr. Wilbur s he
rays as the nearest objects. The detail rendition is independent of ha.:
