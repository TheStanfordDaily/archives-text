# OUR MASHER

### 
I should be happy, somehow I should be
sady. I am neither. This is the last of a long-line
of Our Hashers, and my emotions are the same that
have been with me on every previous column. I am
worried. I don't know how I'm going to fill the al
lotted three pages of Daily copy paper.
It's been fun, and sometimes it's been hard work.
Sometimes the "humor" has been forced and the scan
dal scandalous. However, I had the nerve to publish
my impending book, so I have more or less publicly
admitted that I think there must have been something
to it.
J CAN admit this quite prettily, however, without ap
pearing as egocentric in print as I am in real life,
by refusing to take the credit for the good features of
my three years of mongering.
And I don't, even in that field of endeavor known
as "real life." Always I have resented the implica
tion that my stories have owed their success to a
peculiar hashery distortion after they've been re
ceived at the central emergency ward of the Daily
office.
I've probably been deluding myself, but I've always
felt that the best stories have been those that wrote
themselves, and I've always felt my principal service
has been to use my tangled and twisted metaphors
and similes to reproduce as much as possible the
reality of the original occurrence.
The lousy puns and the cheap writing tricks al
ways increased in direct proportion to the weakness
of the original story.
'J'HE OUR HASHER column started out with a few
stories Id picked up in my year on the campus.
After those were exhausted( the column was main
tained by a large number of contributors, known as
H-men, who heard of the incidents, thought they were
funny, and told them to me. If I thought they were
funny and not particularly libelous, I recreated them
on the Underwood.
The column, then, has been a communal enter
prise. It was t?ie product of an environment. The
humor was inherent in the milieu. It necessitated rec
ognition of a situation as humorous by people who
had senses of humor, or at least what I consider to be
a sense of humor. The column, therefore, has been a
selective reflection of Stanford.
It could only have been written for a Stanford
journal, and only for a Stanford audience. If the book
is a success, it is due to its accuracy of that re
flection.
And, now that I am graduating, I will no longer
remain your humble and obedient servant. In other
words, you can't fire me. I quit.
