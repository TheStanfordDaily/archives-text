## PHI PHI EXPLAINS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
At Stanford, Phi Phi has been
subjected to a good deal of criti
cism—mostly unwarranted —because
little or nothing about Phi Phi is
known by those who have done the
criticizing. Phi Phi is, in essence,
a senior men's honorary society. But
it is more than that. It is a frater
nity organization. Its membership
is officially limited to fraternity men.
The fact that Phi Phi is not per
mitted to choose hall men may be
open to criticism, but Phi Phi can
not be condemned for not choosing
hall men.
Another source of much agitation
on the part of the eager reformists
is the so-called "fraternity politics"
that gum up the Phi Phi elections.
The fact that three Dekes, two
Zetcs, and two Sigma Nu's were
elected to Phi Phi at the recent elec
tion is hailed as proof that one or
two houses "control" Phi Phi. The
method of electing new members
has been carefully designed to elim
inate the slightest possibility of hav
ing fraternity rivalries govern the
choice of candidates. And what if
there were three Dekes, and two
Zetes, and two Sigma Nu's elected?
Is it surprising that there are more
than one outstanding seniors in any
one house? If the society is truly an
honorary one it should strive in its
choice of members to overlook fra
ternity affiliations as far as possible.
Phi Phi strives for precisely this.
Two elections are held annually;
one in the autumn, when the candi
dates are selected from men who
then constitute the senior class, and
one in the spring, when the candi
dates are selected from men who
will be seniors the following year.
An average of twelve men are elect
ed each time —with the constitution
al minimum of nine, a maximum of
fourteen. Not more than three men
from any one fraternity may be
elected at any one election. Thus it
is hoped that the group will remain a
small enough percentage of the eli
gible fraternity men to keep mem
bership in the society truly an honor.
At present Phi Phi is purely an
honorary organization. The present
membership, however, has been con
ducting an extensive investigation
for the purpose of discovering some
project that could be undertaken
and would serve the double purpose
of benefiting the University in its
results and of benefiting the society
in the accomplishment. Phi Phi is
not so over-zealous or so conceited
as to believe that it can, with the
simple resources at its command, ac
complish anything startling or even
wonderful. But it is thoughtful
enough to realize that it can do
something; and it is ambitious
enough to want to accomplish that
something, whatever it may be. So
the next year or two may see Phi Phi
develop from what is purely an hon
orary society to what the adminis
tration and the student body may
regard as a little more "practical."
Sincerely,
Dinty Moore
