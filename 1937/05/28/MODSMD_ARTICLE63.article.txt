# THE 						PROFESSOR IS ALWAYS RIGHT

### 
ThcEditor, Sir:
It is rumored that the administra
tion is displeased by the attitude
shown by the students toward the
speakers of the current events class;
furthermore, it is threatened that the
course is going to be discontinued
for this very reason.
It may just happen that the ad
ministration has not taken into con
sideration the fact that there might
be some reason for the students' at
titude in many of these lectures; in
most of those of this quarter as a
matter of lact. If yesterday's lec-

I ture can serve as a good example of
i class behavior, I think that the point
| is well made that the class will
! listen attentively to anyone having
anything to say and ii half-way de
j cent way of saying it. Yesterday's
I lecture was good; mo. t of the stu
dents agree on that point. Perhaps
this is the reason there was no ap
parent inattention.
'Ihe smart-aleck who let out the
boo, however, has every reason in
1 the world to consider himself more
of a jack-ass than an intellect.
Sincerely,
—P. H.
CLEVELAND, May 21 (UP). —
With increasing bitterness, marked
by union protests and threatened
protests to the federal government,
a strike sponsored by the Committee
for Industrial Organization crippled
operations of three of the country's
biggest independent steel producers
i today.
