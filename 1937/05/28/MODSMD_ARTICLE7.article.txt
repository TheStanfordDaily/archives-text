# Ann Pingree Kills Self In Automobile
## Stanford Junior Found Dead from Monoxide Fumes on Alpine Road 
### 
Locked in a gas-filled coupe, Ann
Pingrce, Stanford junior, was found
dead yesterday morning. Suicide by
carbon monoxide poisoning was the
verdict returned by Coroner William
Crosby of San Mateo.
After purchasing a length of gar
den hose from a Palo Alto hardware
store, Miss Pingree parked at a pic
nic ground on the Alpine Road near
Portola, left the motor running. She
taped the hose to the exhaust and
ran it through the window, stuffing
cracks with rags.
Writes Note
Beneath her head was an unsigned
note to her mother: "Please forgive
me. I just can't stand it any longer."
According to Dr. Harry Mason of
Redwood City, who made examina
tion, she had been dead but a short
time when her body was found.
William Nahmens, picnic ground
worker, discovered the body, when
he went to investigate the apparently
empty car with its engine running.
Identification was made from Miss
Pinglee's books and binder found
beside her, and from the registration
slip of the car. The body was re
moved to the Tinnev funeral parlor
in Palo Alto, and her parents noti
fied.
Poor Health Cause
Miss Pingree, an education and
graphic arts major, 22 years old,
had been a top-ranking student. Last
year, she was vice-president of Roblc
Hall. This year she lived at Madrona
Hall.
Friends surmised that poor health
and worry over studies may have
caused her to take her life.
Her parents are Mr. and Mrs. L. W.
Pingree, 427 Manuella Road, Los
Altos. Her brother, Louis Pingree,
is a freshman here.
