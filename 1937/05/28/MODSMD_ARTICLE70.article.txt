## D'Evelyn Will Present Senior Evaluation To Administration Board 
### 
- Mort D'Evelyn, senior president,
will personally submit the "Class
Testament," embodying an evalua
tion of Stanford, to the Board of
Trustees next week, it was decided
yesterday following meeting of the
Senior Class Executive Committee.
Dr. Wilbur will receive another
copy of the document prior to its
presentation to the University's Su
preme governing body, the Commit
tee declared.
Proposes Changes
Virtually completed, save for pol
ishing and retyping, the document is
divided into sections, each discuss
ing a problem relevant to both stu
dent and administrative interests.
Among topics under consideration
are 8.A.C., the pre-registration pe
riod, big-name bands, "attitudes,"
and press relations.
Constructive Plans
In drafting the document, the
committee has attempted to approach
the subject - matter constructively
and generally to assume a long-run
value. It is not a student attempt to
meddle in administrative machinery,
President D'Evelyn declares in his
preface.
"Students associated with the
University throughout four years are
not expected to have the depth and
vision of those who have long been
a part of the University. This is a
brief summary of the reactions of a
class of Stanford students to their
University and the ways in which
they feel that this University, from
the standpoint of the majority of
students, can be improved."
"Many of the problems herein con
sidered are undoubtedly obvious to
the administration. Many of the
improvements suggested may have
been considered impractical for va
rious reasons, financial or other
wise.
New Idea
"This paper is built on an untried
foundation, because for the first time
it presents student problems to tho
Board of Trustees. Yet if it estab
lishes a custom through which stu
dents can reach, in a iormal man
ner, the supreme governing body of
the University, it will have served
a worthy purpose.
"It is an attempt to build a greater
Stanford University."
