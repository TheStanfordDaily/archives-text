# $750 Added To Stanford Fund
## Seniors Donate Amount From Contributions 
### 
For the newly inaugurated Stan
ford Fund, the Class of '37 has col
lected from its members $750. The
fund has been officially put into ac
tion with the work of this year's
class, although '36 contributed a
i large sum last year.
The committee of the senior class
; working on this fund has been un
| der the chairmanship of Don Moul
i ton. He divided the committee into
i representatives of men and women
J on the Row and in the living groups:
Caryll Mudd, Row women; Virginia
Hawkes, Hall women; Bob Haslach
' er, Row men; Don Strauss, Hall
! then, were chairmen of these sub
; ordinate committees.
Reynolds Directs
The organization and explanation
of the purpose of the fund have been
under the directorship of Dr. Harry
1 Reynolds, and the executive advicc
under Harlow Rothert, alumni sec
j retary.
The Stanford Fund work is sepa
i rated into two committees; one has
charge of the solicitation of funds
from alumni and gifts from the gen
eral public, the second has charge of
j special gifts, trusts and bequests.
The goal of the fund is to have
! every Stanford man and woman rep
resented no matter how small their
| contributions may be, and the
I method used for building the fund
! is senior class contributions.
The method of giving the money to
a board of trustees to use for unre
stricted funds is taken from that
| used by many other universities.
Starting wtih a total gift of $25,000
land assuming this amount will be
[increased every year, the endow
ment has already increased $600,000.
j The immediate objective is to run it
j up to one million.
Effect Shown
To show the effect this money can
j have upon the welfare of the Uni
j versity, Dr. Wilbur has reported that
. three men, members of the electrical
! engineering department, biology de
j partmcnt, and the psychology de
! partmcnt, have refused offers of po
j sitions as dean of their school in an
| other university at higher wages.
I It is due to the fund that Stanford
is able to retain these men.
