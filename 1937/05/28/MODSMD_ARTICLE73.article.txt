# Graduates Promised Jobs by Next Fall
## 
### WARREN RADFORD 
The depression is over, at least as far as Stanford graduates are con
cerned. By fall, all graduates who are ready for positions will be on the
payroll of some employer, according to Miss Ruth Tracksell, executive
assistant of the appointment service.
This spring, business and profession have been turning to Stanford to
a greater extent than in previous years and the seniors have responded

♦by registering with the Appointment
Service earlier and in larger num
! bers. At this time senior registra
, tions are at least 50 per cent beyond
| the figure attained at the end of
; May last year.
Engineers Seek Jobs
Engineers make up the largest
! group. Those who have taken train
j ing in liberal arts are finding jobs in
I sales work and merchandising, gov
; eminent service, banking, invest
| ments and insurance, advertising
! and journalism, foreign trade manu
j facturing and transportation. The
! women have registered chiefly for
! office and secretarial work with
j personnel and social service work a
| close second. One woman has regis-
I tered for engineering and already
: has her job.
The number of calls for seniors
j shows an improvement over last
i year. Requests from San Francisco
! and other nearby points are showing
ian increase, but the most signifi
| cant phase of the employment situa
tion lies in the demand on the part
j of business organizations of national
j scope. These companies have sent
[representatives from their eastern
| headquarters to the campus to in
terview students, and a gratifying
I number of offers has been the re
sult. Salaries are increasing and
average about $100 a month.
Many Offers
Certain fortunate students have
been able to choose between two,
three, and eevn four offers. Those
who have earned their expenses as
students while at Stanford are hav
ing less difficulty in knowing what
they want to do than those who
have had no employment experi
ence.
As for last year, outlook was con
sidered good due to the fact that
the office was informed of at least
20 offers of regular, salaried em
ployment which were rejected by its
candidates.
Teachers Placed
In 1936 more orders for Stanford
trained teachers were received and
a larger number of candidates for
positions were placed than during
the previous year. This constitutes
| the third year of an upward trend
in teacher placement.

sult. Salaries are increasing and
average about $100 a month.
Many Offers
Certain fortunate students have
been able to choose between two,
three, and eevn four offers. Those
who have earned their expenses as
students while at Stanford are hav
ing less difficulty in knowing what
they want to do than those who
have had no employment experi
ence.
As for last year, outlook was con
sidered good due to the fact that
the office was informed of at least
20 offers of regular, salaried em
ployment which were rejected by its
candidates.
Teachers Placed
In 1936 more orders for Stanford
trained teachers were received and
a larger number of candidates for
positions were placed than during
the previous year. This constitutes
| the third year of an upward trend
in teacher placement.
The depression is over, at least as far as Stanford graduates are con
cerned. By fall, all graduates who are ready for positions will be on the
payroll of some employer, according to Miss Ruth Tracksell, executive
assistant of the appointment service.
This spring, business and profession have been turning to Stanford to
a greater extent than in previous years and the seniors have responded

♦by registering with the Appointment
Service earlier and in larger num
! bers. At this time senior registra
, tions are at least 50 per cent beyond
| the figure attained at the end of
; May last year.
Engineers Seek Jobs
Engineers make up the largest
! group. Those who have taken train
j ing in liberal arts are finding jobs in
I sales work and merchandising, gov
; eminent service, banking, invest
| ments and insurance, advertising
! and journalism, foreign trade manu
j facturing and transportation. The
! women have registered chiefly for
! office and secretarial work with
j personnel and social service work a
| close second. One woman has regis-
I tered for engineering and already
: has her job.
The number of calls for seniors
j shows an improvement over last
i year. Requests from San Francisco
! and other nearby points are showing
ian increase, but the most signifi
| cant phase of the employment situa
tion lies in the demand on the part
j of business organizations of national
j scope. These companies have sent
[representatives from their eastern
| headquarters to the campus to in
terview students, and a gratifying
I number of offers has been the re
sult. Salaries are increasing and
average about $100 a month.
