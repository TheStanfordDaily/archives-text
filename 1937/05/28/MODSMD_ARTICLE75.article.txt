# Attributes Year's Success To Co-operation of All
## 
### 
Upon the completion of his year as
president of the Associated Students
of Stanford University Jim Rey
nolds last night made the following
statement:
''As the curtain is about to ring
down on the last act of our 1936-1937
year, my old heart takes an extra
sputter. For four years now, I have
had the privilege, honor and good
fortune to make Stanford my home,
and my greatest regret is that I can't
begin all over again, not with the
idea of doing things differently, but
with the idea of living over again
the best four years of my life.
"During the past year, I have done
my best to carry out the responsi
bilities with which you have honored
me. Mistakes I have made, and yet,
each mistake has made me less
liable to get caught the next time.
Everyone Plays a Part
''What success we have had this
year, if any, has not resulted from
any one individual, but rather, from I
the whole-hearted co-operation of I
you all. No one individual can make 1
or break our student government.
You, each and everyone, play a most
necessary part in our success or j
failure.
"I believe that the greatest single
achievement that has been made in
our student activities in general this |
year is a realization, especially on 1
the part of both old and new stu
dent officials, that our extra-curricu
lar activities should teach us to learn
democracy by living and practicing
it in everything we do. Student ac- ,
tivities are a definite part of the
educational program here at Stan
ford; and hence the more students
we have participating in them, the
more benefits that we, as a group, '
will receive.
Stanford Responsibility Unique
"It should be remembered that
there are few, if any, other univer
sities in the United States which give
their students as much responsi
bility as does the administration
here at Stanford. Consequently, we
have an opportunity to learn and
develop our abilities by actually do
ing the job instead of having some
one else give us the answers and do
the job for us.
"Before my last goodbye, I would
like to say that your vice-president,
Esther Pelton, has certainly done a
fine piece of work this year. She has
been a tireless worker and has made
innumerable constructive criticisms
and suggestions. It has been a pleas
ure to work with her.
Chick Franich Thanked
"One name I would like to
mention is that of Chick Franich.

Throughout the year Chick has been
more than willing to help, suggest
and organize along any lines that
would further the interest of the
student body. In a year when the
interest of many might very easily
have lagged, Chick has given even
more time and effort than before, a
fine example for all of us to try to
follow.
"Now in closing, I want to thank
you all for the fine year that we
have had together, and to say that
you will have a most capable leader
in Tom Killefer next year."

liable to get caught the next time.
Everyone Plays a Part
''What success we have had this
year, if any, has not resulted from
any one individual, but rather, from I
the whole-hearted co-operation of I
you all. No one individual can make 1
or break our student government.
You, each and everyone, play a most
necessary part in our success or j
failure.
"I believe that the greatest single
achievement that has been made in
our student activities in general this |
year is a realization, especially on 1
the part of both old and new stu
dent officials, that our extra-curricu
lar activities should teach us to learn
democracy by living and practicing
it in everything we do. Student ac- ,
tivities are a definite part of the
educational program here at Stan
ford; and hence the more students
we have participating in them, the
more benefits that we, as a group, '
will receive.
Stanford Responsibility Unique
"It should be remembered that
there are few, if any, other univer
sities in the United States which give
their students as much responsi
bility as does the administration
here at Stanford. Consequently, we
have an opportunity to learn and
develop our abilities by actually do
ing the job instead of having some
one else give us the answers and do
the job for us.
"Before my last goodbye, I would
like to say that your vice-president,
Esther Pelton, has certainly done a
fine piece of work this year. She has
been a tireless worker and has made
innumerable constructive criticisms
and suggestions. It has been a pleas
ure to work with her.
Chick Franich Thanked
"One name I would like to
mention is that of Chick Franich.

Throughout the year Chick has been
more than willing to help, suggest
and organize along any lines that
would further the interest of the
student body. In a year when the
interest of many might very easily
have lagged, Chick has given even
more time and effort than before, a
fine example for all of us to try to
follow.
"Now in closing, I want to thank
you all for the fine year that we
have had together, and to say that
you will have a most capable leader
in Tom Killefer next year."
Jim Reynolds,
President, Associated Students,
Upon the completion of his year as
president of the Associated Students
of Stanford University Jim Rey
nolds last night made the following
statement:
''As the curtain is about to ring
down on the last act of our 1936-1937
year, my old heart takes an extra
sputter. For four years now, I have
had the privilege, honor and good
fortune to make Stanford my home,
and my greatest regret is that I can't
begin all over again, not with the
idea of doing things differently, but
with the idea of living over again
the best four years of my life.
"During the past year, I have done
my best to carry out the responsi
bilities with which you have honored
me. Mistakes I have made, and yet,
each mistake has made me less
liable to get caught the next time.
