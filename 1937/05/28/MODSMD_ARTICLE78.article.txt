# Mort D'Evelyn Thanks Seniors
## Committees Praised For Carrying Out Program 
### 
Molt d'Evelyn, president of the
Class of '37, last night issued the
following statement as his parting
message to his classmates:
"To the chairmen and unsung
members of the various committees
goes all credit for what we can
rightly call a successful senior pro
gram.
"The amount of sincere interest
and pride which the members of he

class have taken in the activities of
the past nine months has been grat
j ifying. The various traditions of the
j senior year have been carefully
! weighed. Those of doubtful value
I have been dropped and the ones
l considered worthwhile have been
carried on with vigor, enthusiasm.
"The Ciass of 1937 has collected
an endowment fund several times as
large as that of any previous senior
class. It has topped all previous
highs for registration in the alumni
association. The revival of the Prom
has met with unanimous approval.
"This much completed, we arc
looking forward to Stanford's finest j
Senior Ball, to a baccalaureate with ,
one of America's most highly prais- j
ed clergymen, and graduation exor
cises in what is certain to be Cali- j
fornia's most beautiful outdoor am- ;
phi theater.
"For the truth of this flood of su
perlatives the Class of '37 is indebt
ed to the loyalty and activity of its j
own members and to the trerncn- I
dous opportunities afforded by
Stanford University, whose present |
greatness and promising future we'
are just beginning to appreciate.
