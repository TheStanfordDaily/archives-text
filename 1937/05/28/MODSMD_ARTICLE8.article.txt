# Plan May Raise Recs for Law
## Need for Restrictions Stated by Kirkwood 
### 
Steadily increasing enrollment in
the Stanford Law School during the
past few years will necessitate more
restrictive entrance requirements
within another year or two, accord
ing to Dean Marion R. Kirkwood.
Dr. Kirkwood recommended such
a change in his annual letter sent to
the law alumni. No action has as yet
been taken on the subject by the
faculty.
One basis for selection from Law
School applicants is the law apti
tude test, worked out by the Uni
versity of Minnesota Law School.
Professor James E. Brenner of the
Stanford Law School will experi
ment with the test this summer.
Grade-point averages will be com
bined with the aptitude test results
in making selections from applicants'
lists.
According to Dr. Kirkwood, no
entrance changes will be made next
fall, since the probable 100 applicants
will .still come within the Law
School's capacity. Tightening of the
regulations is likely to be made in
the fall of '38.
