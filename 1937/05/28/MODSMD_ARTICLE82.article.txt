the school year.
r l he Alumni Association has con
cluded its activities for this year, in
cluding a series of lecture tours, Uni
versity Day, and other important de

success of the "Forward with Stan
ford" program of long-term mem
berships.

50-year pictorial history of Stanford
to commemorate the Golden Anni
versary period from 1936 to 1941.

cently awarded for 1937-38 to out
standing candidates from a group of
over 100 applicants.
