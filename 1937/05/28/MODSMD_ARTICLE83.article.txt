# '37's Crusade Built Theater
## Class Will See Fruition Of $587,000 Dream 
### 
The Class of '37, which did more ,
than any other group to change the
new theater from a vague idea into !
concrete reality, will see the results (
of their efforts before they graduate.
The Student Theater Committee :
faced a seemingly hopeless task in
Irying to raise the necessary funds.!
They had $186,000 to start with,
which was collected immediately
after the war for the original Me- 1
morial Fund.
Chappie Pushes
A Chaparral campaign in 1931 to ;
raise money for a theater resulted in 1
an additional $2000. All the money
was set aside with the idea that it [
would be many years before enough
could be collected- even to consider J
building.
Taking their cue from former
Daily editor and theater - crusader
Stan Beaubaire, the Class of '37 de- I
cided to take definite action. Wally
Brooke, Bob Gros, Annalee Whit- j
more, Phil Brown, and A1 Hyman
were appointed to the Theater com
mittee. Consultations and confer
ences with the Administration and
Ex Committee lead to the sugges
tion that the students pay $1 each
quarter toward the Memorial Hall
fund.
Posterity's Debt
Submitted to a student vote, the
plan was approved, and money began ,
to pile up toward the $587,000 goal.
The theater is practically complete.
Until 1957 Stanford men and wom
en will be paying for the structure.
On June 2 of last year the corner ,
stone was laid. The theater was |
scheduled to open last January. De- i
lay followed delay; months passed
and Memorial Hall looked like it
would never be finished.
And now, on June 12 the Class !
of '37 will look at their theater prac- j
tically complete, look at the dream j
that has become reality through j
their initiative.
