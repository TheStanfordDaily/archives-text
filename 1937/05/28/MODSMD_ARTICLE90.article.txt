"The Senior Class Will will he out ]
sometime in Senior Week, in time :
for them to bury it along with till
of the other archives under the class |
plate on the Quad," Irvin "Our
Hasher" Jorgensen, former Daily
editor and alleged writer of the class j

will, declared yesterday.
Explaining that he is busy as a
bee now preparing his "Our Hasher
Book" (adv.), Jorgensen drawled:
"I haven't the slightest idea when
I'll get around to writing that will."
Rationalizing his ut'.uy, he de
clared that "the senior class Is noted
for its autistic thinking—psycholog
ical term for day dreaming—and also
for its abulia — psychological term
meaning it has no will."
