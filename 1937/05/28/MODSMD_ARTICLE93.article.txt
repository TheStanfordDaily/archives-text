Class History of the Class <>1 19.T7
as written l>,v Mary Craig, class
historian.—Ed. Note.)
The Class of '37 is on its way out.
If looks eagerly forward and fondly
I backward ... to Freshman days
of scholastic uncertainty and social
bewilderment . . . to that first game
in the Rose Bowl ... to the im
portance of pledging an extra dol
lar each quarter to build the theater.
Backward not quite so far and
, perhaps not so clearly to the sophis
i tication of Sophomorism . . . rah
-1 rahing to the Rose Bowl again . . .
laughing at the Class of '35 donning
i academic robes in the football sta
| dium . • . . looking on Lagunita
j Court as a symbol of a new inva
| sion.
Junior Year
Progress in the Junior year . . .
academic work begins . . . and also
theater construction . . . big-time
| orchestras appear . . . three times
I a charm in the Rose Bowl but n«rt
i so collegiate this time, "We're upper
! classmen, you see" . . . '36 bade
I farewell and '37 moves in on the
A.S.S.CJ.
Seniors now . . . with pride they
point to a pre-registration program
i . . .to the beginning of a much
! discussed night spot ... to a stu
dent-written book on student gov
ernment ... to a future school of
the drama, Lagunita annexes, and a
Cubberley education building . . .
1 to a vocational guidance committee.
Graduation!
Four years it has taken to com
plete the cycle when the Class of '37
will find itself freshmen again . . .
1 just beginners . . . but it is drenched
in units, damp with grade points,
and somehow the bawlout doesn't
seem so important ... '37 is ready
to step aside in favor of '38 . . . but
it goes forward in favor of itself.
