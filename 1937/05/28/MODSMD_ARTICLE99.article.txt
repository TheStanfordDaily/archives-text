# Graduation To Take Toll In Athletics
## Track Only Sport To Be Hard Hit by Annual Commencement Slash 
### 
The annual reaper of sports talent,
old Dame Graduation, takes a kind
ly glance at Stanford this year, for
with the exception of track the Car
dinal forces in practically every sport
will lose only a few men.
T,. • instance, football has lost only
.'■> ix men from a squad of fifty or more.
Claude "Cab" Callaway, the burly
blond tackle played great ball for
two years in tandem with All-Amer
ican Bob Reynolds, and then lost a
year when bronchitis nailed him to
a bed for a long time in 1935, fin- j
L hod up his football at Stanford
with a steady, strong season last fall. [
Mangan. Hoos, Too
Another tackle who leaves for |
good is Bob Mangan, the handsome 1
Lothario who for three years has
turned in steady and sometimes spar- ■
kling play when Zagar, Reynolds, I
Callaway, or Beedle weren't per
forming up to snuff. Earl Hoos, cap
tain-quarterback last year and one
of the best blockers ever to play for
Stanford, also goes. He will be
missed, for it wasn't for nothing that
he got the cognomen of "Dutch Dy
namite."
. Fred Williams, fullback who rose j
to the heights as a senior last fall,!
will ; lso be gone when the '37 season
j l 'ills around, as will ends Rog Mun- ;
";er ind Carl Schott. Munger is a
iang/ from 'way!
1 aek while Schott will never be |
forg 'tten on the Farm for his place- j
kick that won the 1934 Big Game.
Bunn Will Miss These
P;isketball loses from its first line |
the great twice-repeating captain
and All-Coaster Dinty Moore, and
the torrid Howie Turner, both of i
whom have carved sizable niches |
in Stanford athletic halls. With them I
go big Sparky Robertson, depend
able as the sunrise, and the slighter j
Bill Quade, tricky black-haired for
ward who reached his performance
peak as a senior this winter and
spring.
Baseball, too, will be lightly I
touched in point of numbers, for j
Harry Wolter will lose just four j
men, Captain Darrell "Red" Hol
man and pitchers Ray Weiershauser, j
Vern Johnson, and Howie Paine. |
Holman was one of the steadiest first .
basemen in the league this spring, !
while Weiershauser and Paine turned
in their share of pitching on that j
seven-man hurling staff. Johnson
played more time in center field than
on the mound, where he made many
a safe handle.
Dink Templeton's track team will i
be hit hard by the loss of twelve [
men, Jack Weiershauser, Captain Bill
McCurdy, Bob Alexander, Jim Rey- |
nolds, A1 Hershqy, Hugh Gribbin, j
Norm Morrison, Chuck Voight, Jack
Carlson, John Moeller, Gordy Hyde, 1
and Jack King. Weiershauser, j
brother of baseball's Ray, has by his .
record this year in the low hurdles j
placed himself at the top of the :
list of Stanford obstacle men, while
his sprinting puts him with Hector
Dyer as the best the Farm has seen
at 220 yards.
Bill McCurdy is another who has
come along gradually to have his best
year as a senior, his attitude toward
the sport exemplifies him as one of i
the finest trackmen ever at Stan
ford. Little Bob Alexander is right
quiet lad whose courage is shown by )
his nickname, "Tiger."
