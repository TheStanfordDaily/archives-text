This is a column about nothing in particular.
Last summer it started out to be something, ended up in a rather
desultory mass of type, proof errors, and general nothingness.
So I've decided that since it ended that way it might just as well start
off the same way.
When someone tells me a funny story, I'll try to retell it so it will
make sense to someone besides the editor. If nothing happens, then I'll
write a column like I'm writing today.

I once knew a man who said he'd stolen a merry-go-round right from
the back door of Madison Square Garden. I called him a liar and he
got sore.

Things not many persons notice: The newsboys on the street, holding
iheir newspapers next to their mouths so that the paper will act as a
sounding board. The cashier in any restaurant putting your money on top
of the cash register drawer until change has been made. The terrific
number of face feelers, hair pullers, tie twisters, key jugglers there are
in the world. If you don't believe me just take a short trip to the Union
sometime and sit there for an hour or so. The waiter always folding the
check so it will be easy for you to pick it up from the table.

Dr. H. C. Brown, head of the philosophy department, has often said
"Alice in Wonderland" should be used as the philosopher's handbook.

There used to be a girl around here who said the reason she got such
high grades on her exams was because she was psychic, could look into
her mind and see the answers written in the book. One day the pro
fessor caught her looking into her book instead.

Does anybody know any good stories?
