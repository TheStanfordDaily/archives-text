A statement sent to those par
ticipating in the conference by the
conference says in part:
Change Inevitable
"Few analytical observers of or
ganized business doubt that pro
found change awaits Chamber of
Commerce and Trade Association
effort Circumstances, if nothing else,
will compel this change These or
ganizations were geared to a politi
co-economic situation that no longer
exists Change, therefore, is inevi
tblc!
"What is to be the character of
this change? What is to be the tone,
the temper, the strategy, the tech
nique of this new and certain tactic?
Will it take the form of greater vin
clictiveness, more of the 'I-double
dare-you' attitude toward the irri
tating forces? Will it, perhaps, take
the form of an acquiescence to the
raging currents of unwisdom?
"Or is there some position, aside
from these two wholly unattractive
alternatives, that is at once eco
nomically sound and psychologically
good?
Constructive Effort
"The Board of Governors of the
Western Conference believes there
is a constructive and effective
course of action for those of us who
will seek it, for those of us who
will carefully examine the nature
«f the forces at work. We don't like
the 'brick-tossing' method nor do we
believe in showing hospitality to
unintelligent schemes merely to get
ourselves on the winning side.
"Our 1937 program is neither
'right' nor 'left' in the political sense.
Nor is it shackled to the prejudices
and the economic predilections of
one side or the other. Rather, it rep
resents a fearless and serious at
tempt at determining what our po
sition should be and how we should
take it."

A statement sent to those par
ticipating in the conference by the
conference says in part:
Change Inevitable
"Few analytical observers of or
ganized business doubt that pro
found change awaits Chamber of
Commerce and Trade Association
effort Circumstances, if nothing else,
will compel this change These or
ganizations were geared to a politi
co-economic situation that no longer
exists Change, therefore, is inevi
tblc!
"What is to be the character of
this change? What is to be the tone,
the temper, the strategy, the tech
nique of this new and certain tactic?
Will it take the form of greater vin
clictiveness, more of the 'I-double
dare-you' attitude toward the irri
tating forces? Will it, perhaps, take
the form of an acquiescence to the
raging currents of unwisdom?
"Or is there some position, aside
from these two wholly unattractive
alternatives, that is at once eco
nomically sound and psychologically
good?
Constructive Effort
"The Board of Governors of the
Western Conference believes there
is a constructive and effective
course of action for those of us who
will seek it, for those of us who
will carefully examine the nature
«f the forces at work. We don't like
the 'brick-tossing' method nor do we
believe in showing hospitality to
unintelligent schemes merely to get
ourselves on the winning side.
"Our 1937 program is neither
'right' nor 'left' in the political sense.
Nor is it shackled to the prejudices
and the economic predilections of
one side or the other. Rather, it rep
resents a fearless and serious at
tempt at determining what our po
sition should be and how we should
take it."
