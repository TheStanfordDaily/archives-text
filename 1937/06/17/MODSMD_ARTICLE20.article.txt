# CAMEL BARBECUE
## 
### 
Paleontologists of the Smithsonian j
Institution have identified as "cam
el'' sbones found at the only known
dwelling site of Folsom Man, in j
northern Colorado. Bison was an
other meat familiar to these oldest
Americans. The camel survived the
Ice Age in North America for a
short time, if at all. That Folsom â€¢
hunters ate camel indicates that man
was here at the close of the Ice Age. !
