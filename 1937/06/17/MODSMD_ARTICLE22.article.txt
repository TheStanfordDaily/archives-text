# Elliott Writes Book on Early Stanford Days
## First Twenty â€“ five Years Recorded in Volume By Emeritus Registrar 
### 
"Stanford University, the First
Twenty-five Years," by Dr. Orrin
Leslie Elliott, emeritus registrar,
was released recently by the Stan
ford University Press.
"The history," says Dr. Elliott,
"covers Stanford from its earliest
foundations till the end of Dr. Bran
ner's administration. It is a very in
timate. almost the domestic story of
the University.
Mrs. Stanford's Work
"In it I tell of the great plan which
was its beginning, of the great hero
ism of Mrs. Stanford, her tremen
dous courage after Senator Stan
ford'sd eath. It was she who man
aged the finances, Dr. Jordan who 1
took the burden of the University."
Most difficult of all was the adap
tation of the great amount of mate
rial to the needs of a history of Stan
ford's early life, according to the
author.
Divisions of Book
At present, the book is in five sec
tions: the first deals with the foun
dation. the reasons for Stanford, and
the labor of its founders.
Then there is a narrative of the
main events in both the academic
and student life. The third section
deals, with the many and recurring
problems, in the financial depart
ment, with the faculty as in the Ross
affair, and in the charter which had
more than one defect to be bent
around to fit unalterable situations.
Major Problems
There were two major problems
which occurred all through this pe
riod. that of liquor and that of con
duct an discipline. These are treated
in their own sections.
The Jast division is concerned with
the University under the trusteeship,
from 1891 to 1916, and tells of the
attempts at reforming and changing
the set-up of the University.
The 600-page volume is complete
v/ith preface by Di\ Wilbur, an in- !
troduction by the author, and many
t'/rly pictures of the University.
