# Rats Aid Science In Proper Feeding
## 
### 
Dr. C. M. Jackson of the Univer
sity of Minnesota at a meeting of the
American Association of Anatomists
disclosed results from a series of ex
periments with rats. He found that
.severe and prolonged underfeeding
at an early age leaves its mark
throughout life on body size. Full
growth is never attained, no matter
how much food is given after the
early period of semi-starvation.
