# Hashers Garbage Still on Sale
## 
### 
The story of Stanford that the
summer time schedule won't
tell you is contained in a little
volume still on sale at the Cel
lar cigar counter.
"The work is euphemistically
entitled 'Garbage,' is illustrated
by Gilman Gist, Jr., Chaparral
editor, and is the product of a
humQr column in The Daily
written by Our Hasher, whose
daily spicy tales of fun and
foibles among the University's
undergraduates were as in
digenous a part of the Stanford
scene for three years as the
morning Cellar snail and cup
of coffee." So Irvin Jorgensen,
the author, says.
