Dr. D. Rothschild has concluded
from a study of old people at the
Foxborough State Hospital, Fox
borough. Mass., that when old people
have failing minds, changes have oc
curred in the brain itself, but these
changes do not tell the whole story
of the senility.
No relation seems to exist be
tween the extent of brain changes
and the deterioration of the intel
lect, for although all cases of senile
psychoses are accompanied by
changes ir the brain, other old peo
ple of normal mentality also show
the age-induced changes.
