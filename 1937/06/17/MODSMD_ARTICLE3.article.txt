# Art Class Will Visit Movie Lot
## Students Will Make Visits To Artistic Residences 
### 
"Art Appreciation" offers one of
its most attractive programs this
summer. A week-end trip to one
of Hollywood's biggest studios, inti
mate evenings at the homes of well
known Bay Region art lovers, per
sonal talks with eminent people in
various fields of art, afternoons in
beautiful Peninsula gardens—these
are among the "labs" which will
form part of this unique course.
According to William Irvine, in
structor, the purpose of the
course is to develop a real and
intelligent appreciation of such
arts as painting, domestic architec
ture, interior decoration, and land
scape gardening—arts which may
become an integral and vital part of
the student's later life. For the study
of these arts the student is given op
portunities, which he would not oth
erwise have, to see beautiful private
homes, private gardens, private col
lections of books and other art treas
ures, Mr. Irvine said.
The motion picture will also be
studied during the summer quarter.
Two Stanford graduates now in the
film world—Delmer Daves and Wal
demar Young, Hollywood scenarists
—will speak to the class on the ar
tistic technique of the cinema. The
week-end trip to Hollywood will in
clude a day at the great Huntington
Library at Pasadena, which contains
one of the world's most valuable col
lections of books and paintings.
Typical "labs" will be visits to
many beautiful houses and gardens
on the Peninsula, including those
of Mr. Mortimer Fleishhacker, Mrs.
Leon Sloss, Jr., Mrs. Sigmund Stern,
and Mr. J. W. Lilienthal, an evening
with Mr. John Francis Neylan in his
library of fine books, and an evening
with Professor Karl Brand, who will
discuss his collection of beautiful
oriental rugs. The class will spend
an afternoon among the famous
Goya paintings at the Palace of the
Legion of Honor at San Francisco,
and an afternoon among California
water-colors at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
