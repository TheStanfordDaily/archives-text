# Dr. Wilbur Speaks On Unused Talent
## 
### 
Following his commencement ad
dress in the Laurence Frost Amphi
theater last Sunday, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur addressed himself
more particularly to the graduating
seniors, pointing out to them that
iheir training at Stanford had been
planned to develop within them un
used capacities which might other
wise have remained permanently
dormant.
Speaking of the differences be
tween propaganda and education,
Dr. Wilbur said:
"In recent years there have been
so many attempts to use youth to
plant propaganda in order to secure
political power that it is easy for
our boys and girls to wonder just
what kind of a world they are living
in. Many of you have felt the pres
sures of these various minority
groups. One of the peculiarities of
education is that in spite of all of the
procedures that have been devised
to siyly insert facts into the brain,
hard individual work is required if
education is to 'take.' There is a
confusion on the part of many be
tween education and propaganda.
The smart propaganda does get his
point of vie waccepted by those
whose minds axe capable of absorp
tion but not of analysis. Education
i caches us to analyze as well as to
. bsorb."
Intimating that today's college
graduates are tomorrow's leaders,
Dr. Wilbur said: "I hope that you
have learned here that intelligence
is the basis of modern power. Our
democracy rests on the masses. Our
greatest problem is whether the
iThPSS can be led along scientific lines
to make wise decisions. The fear of
change disturbs us all more or less.
This is peculiarly true at the present
time, when we find great forces
stirring in the world and feel that
our navigation must be cautious and
skillful. One need not fear those
forces or navigation if one has faith
in human kind and in education—
if one believes in values that are
worth fighting for even though they
seem to be somewhat illusive. With
out hope mankind would be like a
band of animals pressing toward the
precipice. We are in danger of turn
ing our eyes backward if we rely on
the cynic. We can handle the world
that is to come only if, wise in the
ways of the past, we 'look up and not
down, forward and not back.' "
In closing. President Wilbur said:
"Above all, we must act and not sit
by spouting criticism and scorn. It
is better to lay cornerstones than to
throw cobblestones. Be a part of
tho life about you. Milton put it
well, in his Areopagitica, 'I cannot

Following his commencement ad
dress in the Laurence Frost Amphi
theater last Sunday, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur addressed himself
more particularly to the graduating
seniors, pointing out to them that
iheir training at Stanford had been
planned to develop within them un
used capacities which might other
wise have remained permanently
dormant.
Speaking of the differences be
tween propaganda and education,
Dr. Wilbur said:
"In recent years there have been
so many attempts to use youth to
plant propaganda in order to secure
political power that it is easy for
our boys and girls to wonder just
what kind of a world they are living
in. Many of you have felt the pres
sures of these various minority
groups. One of the peculiarities of
education is that in spite of all of the
procedures that have been devised
to siyly insert facts into the brain,
hard individual work is required if
education is to 'take.' There is a
confusion on the part of many be
tween education and propaganda.
The smart propaganda does get his
point of vie waccepted by those
whose minds axe capable of absorp
tion but not of analysis. Education
i caches us to analyze as well as to
. bsorb."
Intimating that today's college
graduates are tomorrow's leaders,
Dr. Wilbur said: "I hope that you
have learned here that intelligence
is the basis of modern power. Our
democracy rests on the masses. Our
greatest problem is whether the
iThPSS can be led along scientific lines
to make wise decisions. The fear of
change disturbs us all more or less.
This is peculiarly true at the present
time, when we find great forces
stirring in the world and feel that
our navigation must be cautious and
skillful. One need not fear those
forces or navigation if one has faith
in human kind and in education—
if one believes in values that are
worth fighting for even though they
seem to be somewhat illusive. With
out hope mankind would be like a
band of animals pressing toward the
precipice. We are in danger of turn
ing our eyes backward if we rely on
the cynic. We can handle the world
that is to come only if, wise in the
ways of the past, we 'look up and not
down, forward and not back.' "
