# Dr. Hulme Talks on Aim of Scholarship Four Enemies of Mankind Listed
## 
### 
At the annual open meeting of
Phi Beta Kappa, honorary scholar
ship fraternity, in the Women's
Clubhouse Saturday afternoon, Dr.
Edward Maslin Hulme, Stanford his
tory professor, said that the aim of
scholarship today should be to en
able the individual to live a well
balanced life and to reduce and re
move the four burdens of mankind—
ignorance, war, poverty, and disease.
This summer's work will be Dr.
Hulme's last as an active professor.
For many generations a person was
not considered a Stanford graduate
unless he had sat in Dr. Hulme's
lectures on medieval culture.
To achieve the high goal Dr.
Hulme pleaded that scholars must
submerge themselves in personal de
velopment and social reform. "No
scholar has the right to remain a
mere spectator in society and poli
tics," he exclaimed.
"Do not be afraid of being called
an idealist, a dreamer, or even a
red. Such is the customary stigma
tization of great souls by little ones.
Such is the censure with which the
defenders of vested interests pursue
the sovereigns of thought. Idealism
is the only principle of progress.
So I bid you to dream.
"Let your thought be known. Love
thought in others when it agrees
with your own. Respect it when it
differs. Then carry over your
thought in action. Work for the
welfare of your fellowmen. It is
with the mass of the common men
that the future lies.
"The scholar's highest function is
to help in establishing, throughout
the world, and in every phase of
life, the solidarity of mankind."
• The nation's irrevocable commit
ment to democracy makes great de
mands upon efficiency of the indi
vidual. "And for bringing about

efficiency on the part of the major
ity where else shall we look if not
to scholarship?" Dr. Hulme pro
ceeded.
He named the general causes of
war as "economic rivalries, national
jealousies, religious hatreds, pressure
of over-population, influence of a
military class, and influence of prof
iteers," he said that all were pre
ventable.
"A high standard of comfort and
security for the mass of the people
is the only true and final test of
the wealth of a country. To this
grave and basic problem of raising
the standard of living of the mass of
our people scholarship must ad
dress itself."
Although marked progress in the
control of disease has been made
it is still further possible to de
stroy germs, stop communicable
disease and "make ourselves invul
nerable to their attacks," Dr. Hulme
declared.
Aside from these public works
"The true scholar is a man whose
life is complete in itself, who lives
to enrich his work, aMd whose work
enriches his own life. Work, then,
is the first element of a balanced
personal life. Play is no less im
portant. There are the fine arts—
literature, architecture, sculpture,
painting and music," the historian
told his audience.
"And then there is religion. I
don't mean theology. I mean the
religion of humanity, the religion
that concerns itself with life here
and now, the reliigon of social serv
ice.
"To these things in the personal
life, scholarship, if it is to justify
itself, if it is to be worth while,
must address itself, intelligently,
sincerely, and persistently."
