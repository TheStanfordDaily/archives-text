# Mears Greets Students With Welcome Message
## 
### 
Dr. Eliot G. Mears, director of
summer quarter, today welcomed all
incoming students. The smaller stu
dent body offers an unrivaled op
portunity for an atmosphere of gen
uine freindliness, he pointed out.
He emphasized the coming events,
such as the Summer Drama Fes
tival, the Tudor Lecture Series, and
the coming Concert Series. Dr.
Mears' message is as follows:
In welcoming the students who
will be with us this summer, I want
to stress particularly the atmos
phere of friendliness prevailing on
our campus. The unique advantages
which Stanford presents throughout
the year as a residence university
are intensified in the summer; a
smaller student body, and the inac
tion of the more formal organiza
tions have the merit of bringing the
members of the community more
closely together.
Friendly Spirit
It is the desire of the members of
the regular staff who remain on
duty, and I believe that I may speak
also for those students who are con
tinuing on from the spring quarter,
to welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and make them feel
that they are among friends. With
this spirit prevailing, even the in
tensive study which courses re
quire will not be found irksome, and
it is hoped that everyone will util
ize the opportunities for recreation
which the University has provided.
The program of public exercises
this summer is of special distinction.
One noteworthy feature is that for
the first time the splendid facilities
of the Memorial Hall \yill be made
available. Most of our university
entertainments will be given in one
of the two auditoriums there. The
Women's Clubhouse will be used for
the Tudor Lecture Series, and the
present Little Theater (Room 100 on
the Inner Quad) and the Women's
Gymnasium may also serve as meet
ing places.
Lecture Program
The weekly public activities con
sist of the Tuesday Evening series,
devoted to a varied program of en
tertainment, the Tudor Lectures on
Wednesday evening, the Thursday
evening lectures by members of
our visiting teaching staff, and the
presentation of plays, readings, and
films occasionally on Monday after
noon and Friday evening. Regular
services will be held in the Church
on Sunday morning, and organ re
citals are scheduled for Sunday
evenings and Thursday afternoons.
The Summer Drama Festival is a
great feature of our summer session.
Prime emphasis this year will be on
comedy, with the culmination at the
close of the quarter in performances
of "Twelfth Night" under the direc
tion of Acting Professor Heffner from
Northwestern University. Specially
designed courses, public lectures,
recitals, and studies in technique
will be supplemented by a series of
free public lectures of Lee Simon
son, noted stage designer.
Education Conference
Among the other attractions this
summer are the Stanford School of
Education Conference, July 7-11,
devoted to "Mental and Physical
Health and the Curriculum Develop
ment," the Graduate School of Busi
ness Conference, July 18-23, for
Junior Business Executives, and the
Japanese-American Students Con
ference the first week of August.
With an academic program of un
usual breadth and value, a faculty
of leading members of the regular
staff and visitors of outstanding
ability, unrivaled opportunities for
outdoor recreation, and an atmos
phere of genuine friendliness, I
trust that each and every student
will find real enjoyment and profit
in attending this summer quarter.
