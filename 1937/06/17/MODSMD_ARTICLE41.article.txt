# State To War Upon Malaria And Mosquito
## State Abatement Officials Meet on Stanford Farm In Spring Conference 
### 
Dr. L. L. Williams of the United
States public health service, speak
ing before a conference of California
Mosquito Abatement officials on the
Stanford Univei'sity campus yester
day, warned public health officers to
be prepared for possible recurrence
of malaria in California.
Fifty officials attended the confer
ence, representing counties through
out Northern California as far north
as Tehama and including San Joa
quin, the San Francisco Peninsula,
and East and North Bay districts, the
California State Board of Health and
the United States Public Health
Service.
Information on the technics of
controlling mosquitoes was pooled
and ideas and observations ex
changed.
Pointing out that it may be only
accidental, Dr. Williams said there
had been an appreciable increase of
malaria in the Central States this
year.
"Five years ago," he stated, "ma
laria had no significance to Califor
nia public health workers. It was
not known here. But in the last
three years a slight increase in cases
has been reported and the disease
has been observed in sections pre
viously free of it."
He attributed this- increase to
changing economic conditions and
the impounding of waters for flood
and drought control and power de
velopment which have created new
conditions favorable to infection.

Trailers Spread Disease
Shanges in the habits of people,
the infectious virus itself, and the
mosquito which is its host can bring
about the recurrence of malaria, Dr.
Williams told the conference. He
noted that there have been decided
changs in the habits of the public; i
trailer automobile traffic with its at
tendant problems of sanitation and
the creation of large bodies of still
water as a result of water and power !
development were two he noted.
New tactics have been employed
in the Eastern states to thwart the
advance of malaria by its mosquito

borne virus, he declared. Whereas
previously the mosquito abatement
officer worked almost single-handed,
he is now supported by experts in
entomology, sanitary engineering,
laboratory technics, and medicine.
Through the combined efforts of
these scientists it has become pos
sible to establish the precise origin
and numbers of mosquitoes and to
take detailed steps for their control
at less expense, Dr. Williams re
ported.

Dr. L. L. Williams of the United
States public health service, speak
ing before a conference of California
Mosquito Abatement officials on the
Stanford Univei'sity campus yester
day, warned public health officers to
be prepared for possible recurrence
of malaria in California.
Fifty officials attended the confer
ence, representing counties through
out Northern California as far north
as Tehama and including San Joa
quin, the San Francisco Peninsula,
and East and North Bay districts, the
California State Board of Health and
the United States Public Health
Service.
Information on the technics of
controlling mosquitoes was pooled
and ideas and observations ex
changed.
Pointing out that it may be only
accidental, Dr. Williams said there
had been an appreciable increase of
malaria in the Central States this
year.
"Five years ago," he stated, "ma
laria had no significance to Califor
nia public health workers. It was
not known here. But in the last
three years a slight increase in cases
has been reported and the disease
has been observed in sections pre
viously free of it."
He attributed this- increase to
changing economic conditions and
the impounding of waters for flood
and drought control and power de
velopment which have created new
conditions favorable to infection.

Trailers Spread Disease
Shanges in the habits of people,
the infectious virus itself, and the
mosquito which is its host can bring
about the recurrence of malaria, Dr.
Williams told the conference. He
noted that there have been decided
changs in the habits of the public; i
trailer automobile traffic with its at
tendant problems of sanitation and
the creation of large bodies of still
water as a result of water and power !
development were two he noted.
New tactics have been employed
in the Eastern states to thwart the
advance of malaria by its mosquito

borne virus, he declared. Whereas
previously the mosquito abatement
officer worked almost single-handed,
he is now supported by experts in
entomology, sanitary engineering,
laboratory technics, and medicine.
Through the combined efforts of
these scientists it has become pos
sible to establish the precise origin
and numbers of mosquitoes and to
take detailed steps for their control
at less expense, Dr. Williams re
ported.
