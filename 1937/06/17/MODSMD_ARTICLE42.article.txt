# Dink's 'Best' Team Fit For National Meet
## Weiershauser Spotted In 440, 220; Malott Sticks To 440 with McCurdy 
### HILMER LODGE 
"The greatest track team" Coach j
Dink Ternpleton has ever coached at ;
Stanford leaves tomorrow morning |
in top condition for the National i
Collegiate track and field champion
ships to be held at Berkeley Friday |
and Saturday afternoons.
This classic track meet will offer
the Indians another chance to de- ;
feat their Coast rivals, the Trojans j
of Southern California. So far this j
season, Dean Cromwell's Southern
California team has been able to j
down the Indians twice. Stanford,
however, slapped it to S.C. at the
Fresno Relays when they set one j
•world's record and walked away
with every relay championship ex- |
eept the quarter-mile relay and ,
would have won it if their baton !
passes had been up to par.
Hard Team Struggle
In tomorrow's skirmish a host of j
big university teams have a better 1
than even chance to upset either j
Templeton's Indians or Cromwell's
Trojans.
Michigan, led by big Bill Watson, j
the colored broad - jumper and J
weight thrower; Indiana, paced by !
her crew of distance runners, Deck
ard, Smith, and Trutt; and Wash
ington State, with such stars as Lee
Orr and Bill Benke, promise to give
the two California teams a battle
•for team honors.
Critics seem to doubt the plausi
bility of the Indiana outfit's poten
tiality without the services of their
ace distance runner, Don Lash, who
will be competing in the Princeton
Invitational meet the same after
noon. However, the scoring in the
Collegiates amounts to 10 points for
a first place, 8 for second, 6 for third,
4 for fourth, 2 for fifth, and 1 for
.sixth.
The Weiershauser Enigma
Shying away from figures and get
ting back to the Stanford team, we
find that Dink Ternpleton has his
Indians rightly keyed for this im
portant meet.
His ironmen, Jack Weiershauser,
Ray Malott, and Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, are prepared to shoot their
bolt against all opposition.
The way things shape up light
now, Jack will probably run the 440
and the 220. A bare possibility ex
ists that might find him entered in
the low hurdles instead of the 440.
The latter possibility rests as Dink
Ternpleton says "upon the amount of
time between the hurdles and the
220."
Malott, whose ironman role fea
tured Stanford's victory over the
California Bears when he won the
220, 440, and ran anchor lap in the
relay, will confine his efforts to the
flat quarter-mile where he will be
opposed by such stalwarts as Bill
Benke of Washington States, Johnny
Woodruff of Pittsburg, and his own
team mates Weiershauser and Cap
tain McCurdy.
Dink's shotputting trio of Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, and Tom
Montgomery h*tve excellent chances
of garnering about twenty points in
this event. Reynolds has completely
recovered from a torn muscle sheath
in his back and has been tossing the
iron ball out close to the 51-foot
mark during the past week."

Pete Zagar, Tiny Thornhill's prob
able All-American tackle next year,
is due to turn in a good discus per
formance Saturday. Pete has been
hovering around the 155-foot mark
all season and during the past week
has spent considerable time having
faults ironed out by Coach Temple
ton.
Bob "Tiger" Alexander, a man
who has run the mile in 4.10.4, three
and two-tenths faster than Paul
"Skin" Wilson's Stanford mile rec
ord, yet not credited to "Tige" be
cause he didn't win the race in which
he made that time, has a good
chance to place against the "select"
Eastern distance men.
The complete squad named by
Coach Ternpleton last night includes:

Stan Hiserman, Jack Weiershau
ser, sprints; Ray Malott and Bill
McCurdy, 440; Carl Mahurin, 880;
Edson Burrows and Bob Alexander,
mile; hurdles, Johnny Hewitt and
Bill Hawkins; discus, Hugh Gribbin
and Pete Zagar; shot put, Jim Rey
nolds. Al liershey, and Tom Mont
gomery; high jump, John Moller.

Trojans.
Michigan, led by big Bill Watson, j
the colored broad - jumper and J
weight thrower; Indiana, paced by !
her crew of distance runners, Deck
ard, Smith, and Trutt; and Wash
ington State, with such stars as Lee
Orr and Bill Benke, promise to give
the two California teams a battle
•for team honors.
Critics seem to doubt the plausi
bility of the Indiana outfit's poten
tiality without the services of their
ace distance runner, Don Lash, who
will be competing in the Princeton
Invitational meet the same after
noon. However, the scoring in the
Collegiates amounts to 10 points for
a first place, 8 for second, 6 for third,
4 for fourth, 2 for fifth, and 1 for
.sixth.
The Weiershauser Enigma
Shying away from figures and get
ting back to the Stanford team, we
find that Dink Ternpleton has his
Indians rightly keyed for this im
portant meet.
His ironmen, Jack Weiershauser,
Ray Malott, and Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy, are prepared to shoot their
bolt against all opposition.
The way things shape up light
now, Jack will probably run the 440
and the 220. A bare possibility ex
ists that might find him entered in
the low hurdles instead of the 440.
The latter possibility rests as Dink
Ternpleton says "upon the amount of
time between the hurdles and the
220."
Malott, whose ironman role fea
tured Stanford's victory over the
California Bears when he won the
220, 440, and ran anchor lap in the
relay, will confine his efforts to the
flat quarter-mile where he will be
opposed by such stalwarts as Bill
Benke of Washington States, Johnny
Woodruff of Pittsburg, and his own
team mates Weiershauser and Cap
tain McCurdy.
Dink's shotputting trio of Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, and Tom
Montgomery h*tve excellent chances
of garnering about twenty points in
this event. Reynolds has completely
recovered from a torn muscle sheath
in his back and has been tossing the
iron ball out close to the 51-foot
mark during the past week."

Pete Zagar, Tiny Thornhill's prob
able All-American tackle next year,
is due to turn in a good discus per
formance Saturday. Pete has been
hovering around the 155-foot mark
all season and during the past week
has spent considerable time having
faults ironed out by Coach Temple
ton.
Bob "Tiger" Alexander, a man
who has run the mile in 4.10.4, three
and two-tenths faster than Paul
"Skin" Wilson's Stanford mile rec
ord, yet not credited to "Tige" be
cause he didn't win the race in which
he made that time, has a good
chance to place against the "select"
Eastern distance men.
The complete squad named by
Coach Ternpleton last night includes:

Stan Hiserman, Jack Weiershau
ser, sprints; Ray Malott and Bill
McCurdy, 440; Carl Mahurin, 880;
Edson Burrows and Bob Alexander,
mile; hurdles, Johnny Hewitt and
Bill Hawkins; discus, Hugh Gribbin
and Pete Zagar; shot put, Jim Rey

gomery; high jump, John Moller.

Curdy, are prepared to shoot their
bolt against all opposition.
The way things shape up light
now, Jack will probably run the 440
and the 220. A bare possibility ex
ists that might find him entered in
the low hurdles instead of the 440.
The latter possibility rests as Dink
Ternpleton says "upon the amount of
time between the hurdles and the
220."
Malott, whose ironman role fea
tured Stanford's victory over the
California Bears when he won the
220, 440, and ran anchor lap in the
relay, will confine his efforts to the
flat quarter-mile where he will be
opposed by such stalwarts as Bill
Benke of Washington States, Johnny
Woodruff of Pittsburg, and his own
team mates Weiershauser and Cap
tain McCurdy.
Dink's shotputting trio of Jim
Reynolds, A1 Hershey, and Tom
Montgomery h*tve excellent chances
of garnering about twenty points in
this event. Reynolds has completely
recovered from a torn muscle sheath
in his back and has been tossing the
iron ball out close to the 51-foot
mark during the past week."

Pete Zagar, Tiny Thornhill's prob
able All-American tackle next year,
is due to turn in a good discus per
formance Saturday. Pete has been
hovering around the 155-foot mark
all season and during the past week
has spent considerable time having
faults ironed out by Coach Temple
ton.
Bob "Tiger" Alexander, a man
who has run the mile in 4.10.4, three
and two-tenths faster than Paul
"Skin" Wilson's Stanford mile rec
ord, yet not credited to "Tige" be
cause he didn't win the race in which
he made that time, has a good
chance to place against the "select"
Eastern distance men.
The complete squad named by
Coach Ternpleton last night includes:

Stan Hiserman, Jack Weiershau
ser, sprints; Ray Malott and Bill
McCurdy, 440; Carl Mahurin, 880;
Edson Burrows and Bob Alexander,
mile; hurdles, Johnny Hewitt and
Bill Hawkins; discus, Hugh Gribbin
and Pete Zagar; shot put, Jim Rey
nolds. Al liershey, and Tom Mont
gomery; high jump, John Moller.
