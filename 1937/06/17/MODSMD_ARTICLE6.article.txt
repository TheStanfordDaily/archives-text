# Wilbur Praises Summer Work
## Stanford's Summer Has Extra Values 
### 
An appeal to summer students to
join in the spirit of comradship at
Stanford was made today by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur. His mes
sage follows:
'"Stanford's summer has its own
peculiar charms. In many ways the
campus is at its best in its quiet and
restful beauty, and such diversions as
there are have in them a dash of ar
tistic, musical or intellectual inter
est. The students come closer to
their professors than is possible dur
ing the rest of the year.

President and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur will be at home informally
to faculty and students of the
summer quarter at the President's
House on Lagunita Knoll, at 8
o'clock on Friday evening, June
18th.

"In welcoming the students for the
summer quarter of 1936 may I em
phasize the hope that you will
I promptly join in the spirit of com-
I radeship that has been developed
! in past summers, and that you will
; feel yourselves full-Hedged Stan-
I ford men and womenâ€”even if you
'cannot become rooters at athletic
I games.
"There are so many advantages be
fore you that I wish they could be
enjoyed at least once by every
Stanford student."
