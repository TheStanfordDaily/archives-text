# Wilbur Warns Seniors of 'Coasting' Lag
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Presi-
I dent of Stanford University, in his
Commencement address last Sunday
| in the Laurence Frost Amphitheater
j warned students and their parents
that the United States is rapidly
j "coasting" toward destruction in the
{ consumption of natural resources
and loss of individual liberty.
Dr. Wilbur's address was followed
by the granting of 1127 degrees, of
which 784 were Bachelor's and 343
I were advanced.
Dr. Wilbur said in part:
"Our civilization seems to be char
j acterized at present by the attitude
| of coasting on the stored-up energy
' of what has gone before—of spend
ing the reserves built up in the past,
and of mortgaging the human energy
of the future. Perhaps the thing we
have done most efficiently is to build
up mechanisms, explosives, and or
ganizations, so that we can be as-

Isured of a periodic but unnecessary
I destruction of lives and property
' through war."
Applying his observations more
particularly to California, President
Wilbur said: "The migrations that
have built up our California in rec
ord time are still under way. Will
| our gracious climate develop enough
men and women of fortitude and
j character to make this one of the
great civilizations? It must be a
j civilization ever on guard to protect
j itself against drought, disorder, and
political decay. There is a minor
j factor of safety, since we can do as
Japan has done and turn to the sea
i for a considerable part of our food
i supply. For we are just beginning to
j look upon the ocean as a source of
j great biological wealth. Our har
| vests there are beginning to rival
| those from the land. Even here,
I though, our reckless use of natural

wealth is markedly in evidence. Our
legislature is discussing the im
mense destruction of plichard, or
sardines, turned to fertilizer instead
of food in the open seas. The dams
across the Columbia River will soon
destroy the ten million dollar salmon
industry, which was good for hun
dreds of years if properly conserved.
Each marked change extracts its
price. We must weigh benefits
against losses to measure our steps
forward
"All of this concerns us intimately
here at Stanford, for California and
its neighbor states are of particular
importance to our University, As
an institution looking forward into
the future and training men and
women for that future, the pro
tection and preservation of this part
of our country is one of the out
standing functions of Stanford Uni
versity."

great civilizations? It must be a
j civilization ever on guard to protect
j itself against drought, disorder, and
political decay. There is a minor
j factor of safety, since we can do as
Japan has done and turn to the sea
i for a considerable part of our food
i supply. For we are just beginning to
j look upon the ocean as a source of
j great biological wealth. Our har

| those from the land. Even here,
I though, our reckless use of natural

wealth is markedly in evidence. Our
legislature is discussing the im
mense destruction of plichard, or
sardines, turned to fertilizer instead
of food in the open seas. The dams
across the Columbia River will soon
destroy the ten million dollar salmon
industry, which was good for hun
dreds of years if properly conserved.
Each marked change extracts its
price. We must weigh benefits
against losses to measure our steps
forward
"All of this concerns us intimately
here at Stanford, for California and
its neighbor states are of particular
importance to our University, As
an institution looking forward into
the future and training men and
women for that future, the pro
tection and preservation of this part
of our country is one of the out
standing functions of Stanford Uni
versity."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Presi-
I dent of Stanford University, in his
Commencement address last Sunday
| in the Laurence Frost Amphitheater
j warned students and their parents
that the United States is rapidly
j "coasting" toward destruction in the
{ consumption of natural resources
and loss of individual liberty.
Dr. Wilbur's address was followed
by the granting of 1127 degrees, of
which 784 were Bachelor's and 343
I were advanced.
Dr. Wilbur said in part:
"Our civilization seems to be char
j acterized at present by the attitude
| of coasting on the stored-up energy
' of what has gone before—of spend
ing the reserves built up in the past,
and of mortgaging the human energy
of the future. Perhaps the thing we
have done most efficiently is to build
up mechanisms, explosives, and or
ganizations, so that we can be as-

Isured of a periodic but unnecessary
I destruction of lives and property
' through war."
Applying his observations more
particularly to California, President
Wilbur said: "The migrations that
have built up our California in rec
ord time are still under way. Will
| our gracious climate develop enough
men and women of fortitude and
j character to make this one of the
great civilizations? It must be a
j civilization ever on guard to protect
