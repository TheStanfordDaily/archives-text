# Row Plans Cleaning, Rebuilding Program
## 
### 
Led by the wrecking of the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity house, started
some time ago by the members in a
series of informal parties, nine fra
ternities and sororities have started
on a rebuilding and reconstruction
program never before equaled on
the Stanford Row.
They hope to have their rebuilding
sufficiently advanced to be able to
move in by the time school starts
next fall.
Two Sets of Plans
With present plans calling for an
expenditure of approximately $25,-
000, the Betas have placed the archi
tectural designing in the hands of
J. C. Branner, prominent campus ar
chitect. Branner has submitted two
alternate sets of plans, one calling
for a colonial design, another being
of a conventional "American" na
ture.
, Alpha Phi Arrangements
1 Slightly further up the line, the
Alpha Phi sorority will renovate
parts of their quarters. According
to House Manager Barbara B. Baer,
the Alpha Phi house will be topped
(by a new green roof, new colonial
style windows of the same color
"which will open from the outside,
and an entirely different front porch
surrounded by new shrubbery and
an iron railing.
Alpha Delta Phi, says House Man
ager Allan Duncan, will make some
modifications in their house's me
chanical set-up this summer also.
Included in their plans for change
are a new dining room, larger living
room, and a new coat of white paint
for the whole exterior.
A.T.O. Plans
When queried as to their possible
plans for building, the Alpha Tau
Omegas replied that they had their
share of financial worries, but
added that they would raise "any
where from $2 to $200,000." With
said sum they will add a third story
to care for their all-time high num
ber of freshman pledges, and also
add a new sleeping porch.
Sigma Chi plans include an ex
penditure in the neighborhood of
5840,000 next spring on a house to be
built in the modernistic style.
Lastly, the Alpha Sigs are putting
in a red brick sidewalk and a fan
shaped staircase. They will also
renovate the inside of the house.
