# Movie Series To Start With Ancient Films
## Sarah Bernhardt Stars As 'Queen Elizabeth' In Program Tomorrow 
### 
Early American films that were
milestones in the history of the cine
ma will be unreeled for Stanford au
diences with the opening tomorrow
night in the Little Theater of the
first of a series of five programs giv
en in conjunction with the course,
"Lectures on the Motion Picture."
"The Great Train Robbery," "A
Trip to the Moon," Sarah Bernhardt
in "Queen Elizabeth," and others
will illustrate the first chapter in the
rise of the film from a few seconds
of flickering action to the present
day talkie. Later in the series will
come such famous productions as
Harold Lloyd in 'The Freshman,"
Theda Bara in "A Fool There Was,"
D. W. Griffith's "Intolerance," and
the epic "All Quiet on the Western
Front."
Show Progress
Made frequently without script,
scenario, noteworthy actors, and
even plot, these early films clearly
demonstrate the vast strides which
have been made over the period of
32 years since "The Execution of
Mary Queen of Scots" was made
in 1895 for a kinetoscope, or peep
show.
"This series is interesting," Mr.
Mendelowitz said, "because, while it
shows the advances which have been
made, it also shows how early in
the development of motion pictures
plot formulae were brought into use
which are still popular today."
'Divine Sarah' Stars
Main feature of the first program,
which deals with the development of
the narrative, is the Divine Sarah as
"Queen Elizabeth" playing opposite
Lou Tellegen.
