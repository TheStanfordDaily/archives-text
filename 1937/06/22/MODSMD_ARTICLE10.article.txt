# Summer Rolls Top '36 Mark, As 805 Enter
## School of Education Has Largest Registration; Upward Trend Seen 
### 
Stanford yesterday mounted an
other rung on the summer quarter
registration ladder in a gradual climb
toward the all-time high of pre-de
pression days.
Figures compiled at the close of
the fourth day of registration showed
a total of 805, topping last year's
mark for the same day by 105. The
gain is concentrated among men stu
dents, with 520 enrolling this year
against 439 in 1936. Two hundred
and eighty-five women have regis
tered for this quarter, compared with
261 last year.
Hits High
This summer's registration is the
high point of a gradual increase
since 1933, when enrollment reached
the low level of 599, culmination of
a steady decrease since 1929's rec
ord-breaking registration of 1408.
Karl M. Cowdery, associate regis
trar, cited these figures as an effect
of the depression and subsequent
recovery. The depression, he stated,
was reflected sooner in summer
quarter registration than in other
quarters, probably due to the fact
that most regular students attend
Stanford on a financial plan based on
four years' work.

Highest registration in a single
department is claimed by the edu
cation department, with more than
300 enrolled. According to educa
tion heads, most of those registered
in the department are administrators
and executives only one-third being
teachers. A majority are working
for advanced degrees, principally for
Master of Arts, with a few candi
dates for doctors' degrees.
Statistics announced yesterday are
for fully registered students, not in
cluding auditors.
