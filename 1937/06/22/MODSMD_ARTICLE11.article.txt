Police calls on short-wave radio
now frequently heard across the At
lantic are caused by the increased
number of sunspots, Dr. L. V. Berk
ner, Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington physicist explained recently.
The activity on the sun produces its
effect by increasing the density of
the electrically charged layers 65,
130 and 190 miles above the earth
that reflect radio waves.
