## 
### 
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington, well
known on the Pacific Coast for her
readings of current plays, will pre
sent the Moss Hart-George Kauf
man comedy "You Can't Take It
with You" in Memorial Hall tonight
at 7:30 o'clock.
A satire by the authors of "Once
in a Lifetime," "You Can't Take It
with You" won the Pulitzer Drama
prize for the current Broadway sea
son. Mrs. Farrington characterizes
it as "the funniest play I have ever
read," and describes it as expressing
a charming philosophy through lov
able characters.
Praised as Interpreter
As an interpreter of the current
theater, Mrs. Farrington has re
ceived the plaudits of Pacific Coast
critics for a number of years. She
has appeared at Stanford twice in
the past year and a half, last year in
"Victoria Regina" and earlier in
"Touchwood."
On one of these occasions, Stan
ford Daily said of her performance,
"With a facility of expression that
charmed her audience, 'The Outsid
er' was beautifully interpreted by
Mrs. Farrington. Through Mrs. Far
rington's characterizations her au
dience found moving, breathing ac
tors on the empty stage."
Critic Lauds Performance
John Hay Chadwick, San Fran
cisco critic, wrote of one of her per
formances, "Mrs. Farrington is the
finest dramatic artist I have ever
heard. There is a delicacy, an ar
tistry, an indescribable finesse about
her characterizations. That stillness
that is only given to a great artist
held for fully a minute after she had
finished."
Mrs. Farrington, a San Francisco
woman, is an instructor in speech at
the University of California at Ber
keley.
