### 
Jim Reynolds, A.S.S.U. president,
has recently completed the chapter
which he is contributing to the stu
dent-written symposium on Ameri
can campus government to be pub
lished in book form by McGraw Hill
Company next spring.
Reynolds has found in his survey
of American colleges and univer
sities that, in colleges of under 1000
enrollment, 80 or 90 per cent of the
students belong to fraternities and
sororities, a figure which decreases
inversely with the size of the en
rollment. This, Reynolds states, in
dicates that large institutions are
more democratic than small ones.
He devotes several paragraphs to a
small middle-western college where
"trucking," a Harlem variant of
ballroom dancing, is taboo but stu
dents are permitted to stroll to
music.
Other Articles
Another article recently completed
and turned over to Dr. Hand of the
School of Education, who is editing
the publication, is that on student
faculty relationships by Roy Thomp
