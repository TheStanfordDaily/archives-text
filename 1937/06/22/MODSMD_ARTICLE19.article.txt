# U.S.C. Power Team Wins N.C.A.A. Meet Cardinal Tracksters May Go on Tour
## 6-man Indian Squad Gives Trojans Hard Battle 
### 
Power played its part at Berkeley
Saturday afternoon when the Uni
versity of Southern California won
the National Collegiate track and
field championship by defeating
Dink Templeton's Stanford varsity
team 64 to 50.
It took ten Trojans to make
enough points to beat down the
challenge of Stanford's six point
scorers.
Weiershauser Versatile
Aside from the fact that the Tro
jan power was truly evident, Stan
ford's Jack Weiershauser proved the
most versatile man on Edwards
Field. His sensational victory over
Lee Orr of Washington State Col
lege in the 220 for second place to
Ben Johnson of Columbia Univer
sity, and then his return for an
other second place forty minutes
later to Earl Vickery of U.S.C. in the
low hurdles, brought a great ovation
from the 12,000 spectators.
It was undoubtedly the fine per
formances of Pete Zagar and Hugh
Gribbin, the two Indians who placed
one-two in the discus throw, which
really inspired Jack to turn on the
gas in his low hurdle race. Both
Gribbin and Zagar, fresh from their
unexpected win, were down at the
start of the barrier race firing Jack
with the expectation that the In
dian might still have a chance for
victory.
Malott Handicapped
A saddening blow to Dink Tem
pleton came in the 440 when Ray
Malott failed to conquer his coast
rival Bill Benke of Washington
State. Two weeks ago silent Ray
defeated the Cougar star at Los An
geles in 47.4, which indicated that
he would most likely repeat when
they met again. Ray was handi
capped to some extent by the fact
that he was assigned the outside
lane and when he hit the turn it
was necessary for him to run wide
or else lose a chance to challenge
when he came out of the turn for
the sprint down the homestretch.
Malott ran wide and had to run eight
or ten yards farther than would have
been necessary if he had been on
an inside position.
As Benke and Malott came down
the stretch it looked like a victory
for the Stanford star, but Benke
turned on the heat about fifteen
yards from the tape to win by a
yard in the very good time of 47.1.
Captain Bill McCurdy, Stanford's
%ither entrant, who was figured to
get no worse than third, finished up
in sixth place. Bill looked like the
goods in his heat Friday afternoon
with a 48 flat trial.
In the mile run, Bob "Tiger" Al
exander, the Indian distance ace,
ran sixth. This was Bob's first com
petition in a race with more than six

or seven entrants. Without a doubt
Bob would have finished third or
fourth if he had not gotten lost in
the pack on his first lapâ€”a slow lap
run by the leader, Rogan of Ken
tucky, in 65. Alexander was timed
in 4:17.7.
Student body president Jim Rey
nolds lost to Sam Francis of Ne
braska and Dimitri Zaitz of Boston
College in the 16-pound shot. Rey
nolds' best toss went out 51 ft. 9 in.
