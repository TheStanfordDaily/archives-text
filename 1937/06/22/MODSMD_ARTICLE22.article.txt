# Past and Present Stanford Trackmen May Tour
## 
### 
A number of present and former
Stanford track and field athletes
have excellent chances of being in
cluded in a series of foreign trips
being planned by the Amateur Ath
letic Union, according to Gustavus
A. Kirby, secretary of the union.
Four European excursions and one
trip to the Orient have been ar
ranged for approximately 75 of the
nation's leading track and field per
formers. Selections for trips will be
based upon performances made at
the National A.A.U. track and field
meet to be held at Milwaukee July
2 and 3.
Levy Is Possibility
Phil Levy, holder of the Stanford
discus record with a toss of 173 ft.
V 4 in., is the most likely possibility
at the present writing to be included
on the eve of the "sailing" lists.
Humbert Smith, member of last
year's Indian squad, with a mark
this season of 6 ft. 7 1 A in. and a
victory over U.S.C.'s great jumper,
Delos Thurber, may give some of
the country's negro leapers—Cruter,
Treadgill, Walker, Albritton, Burke,
and Johnson—a run for their money
and head for foreign shores.
Jack Weiershauser, "ironman" of
Dink Templeton's 1937 squad with
outstanding performances in the low
hurdles, 220-yard dash, and the
quartermile, has an excellent chance
for a tour.
Malott Has Chance
Ray Malott, who, along with Wei
ershauser and Captain Bill McCur
dy, has played an ironman role on
this year's squad, is almost a cinch
to make a trip if he measures up to
his performance of last week at
Berkeley. McCurdy, likewise, has a
very good chance to be included on
the A.A.U. list.
Shot putter Jim Reynolds, too,
should be scoring high in the Mil
waukee meet and heading for for
eign lands.
Other possibilities include Pete
Zagar, discus; Gordon Dunn, shot
and discus; John Mottram, javelin;
and Ray Dean, sprints.
All of these men will compete for
the San Francisco Olympic Club in
the Milwaukee meet.

discus record with a toss of 173 ft.
V 4 in., is the most likely possibility
at the present writing to be included
on the eve of the "sailing" lists.
Humbert Smith, member of last
year's Indian squad, with a mark
this season of 6 ft. 7 1 A in. and a
victory over U.S.C.'s great jumper,
Delos Thurber, may give some of
the country's negro leapers—Cruter,
Treadgill, Walker, Albritton, Burke,
and Johnson—a run for their money
and head for foreign shores.
Jack Weiershauser, "ironman" of
Dink Templeton's 1937 squad with
outstanding performances in the low
hurdles, 220-yard dash, and the
quartermile, has an excellent chance
for a tour.
Malott Has Chance
Ray Malott, who, along with Wei
ershauser and Captain Bill McCur
dy, has played an ironman role on
this year's squad, is almost a cinch
to make a trip if he measures up to
his performance of last week at
Berkeley. McCurdy, likewise, has a
very good chance to be included on
the A.A.U. list.
Shot putter Jim Reynolds, too,
should be scoring high in the Mil
waukee meet and heading for for
eign lands.
Other possibilities include Pete
Zagar, discus; Gordon Dunn, shot
and discus; John Mottram, javelin;
and Ray Dean, sprints.
All of these men will compete for
the San Francisco Olympic Club in
the Milwaukee meet.
