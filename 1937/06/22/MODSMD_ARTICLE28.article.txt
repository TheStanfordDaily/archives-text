# Radio Lecture Treats Early Science Study
## English Instructor Tells Of Britain's Struggle For Science Training 
### 
"England's First Public Teacher of
the Mathematical Sciences" was the
topic of the Stanford Radio Hour talk
last night given by Francis R. John
son of the English department over
KPO at 8:30.
The struggle of science for educa
tional recognition goes back to the
reign of Queen Elizabeth when sev
eral vain attempts were made foi; the
scientific education of artisans and
technicians. Among these was an at
tempt which enlisted the aid of Sir
Francis Drake to establish a lecture
course in navigation. No government
money was available, according to
Mr. Johnson, until the coming of the
Spanish Armada created a national
crisis so great that mathematical ed
ucation was imperative for the un
trained leaders of the volunteer
militia.
Lectured on Mathematics
Thomas Hood was the lecturer at
the public classes and was paid by
private donations for two years. His
lectures covered the elements of
arithmetic and geometry and their
applications to astronomy, surveying
and navigation.
The city of London supported the
lectures until 1592 when the danger
from Spanish attack was considered
over. Hood provided cheap pam
phlets similar to syllabi as a substi
tute for expensive texts, and adapt
ed his methods of teaching to the
needs of a middle-class public. He
created an interest in scientific
knowledge that found new converts
in all classes, and his lectures fore
shadowed a series of notable victor
ies in popular scientific education
that were to come.
Coming Radio Talks
Next week on the Stanford Radio
Hour, Dr. William Martin Proctor,
professor of education at Stanford,
will speak on "The Function of Jun
ior Colleges in a System of Public
Education." Dr. Proctor is an out
standing authority on education and
has been closely associated with the
development of junior colleegs for a
I number of years.
