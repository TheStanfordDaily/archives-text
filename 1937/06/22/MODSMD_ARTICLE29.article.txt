### 
"A Star Is Born," currently play
ing at the Fox-Stanford theater:
When Esther Victoria Blodgett of
Fillmore, N.D. (Janet Gaynor) tells
crusty old Grandmother Blodgett
(May Robson) that she wants to be
a star, Granny warns: "For whatever
success you may achieve, you'll have
to pay in heart-break."
Then Granny shoves a roll of bills
into her hand and Esther goes to
Hollywood. But the glittering studio
gates are shut to her. Finally, mat
inee idol Norman Maine (Frederic
March) meets her, is impressed by
her, makes her a star. He also falls
in love with her. She falls in love
with him. They are married.
Hits Top
Esther hits the top; Norman hits
the skids. Tragedy befalls them
both —the kind of tragedy peculiar
to a place like Hollywood where
fame and producer desert a star
when the gold is gone, like miners
desert a ghost-town when the mine
is played. A place where a has-been
great hears himself called by his
wife's last name. A place, in short,
where Granny Blodgett's prophesy
might well come true. And it does
come true. Esther pays for success
in heart-break.
"A Star Is Born" is a moving,
sincere, honest picture. It shows
filmdom to be at once glamorous
and ruthless. Frederic March, the
real star of the picture, plays con
vincingly the likeable, erring Nor
man Maine; Janet Gaynor is sweet.
Role Suits
But this time she does not cloy.
The role of Esther Blodgett was
made for her.
"A Star Is Born" is filmed in
technicolor. That color filming may
well replace other screening me
diums shown by this picture.
