# Future Bright For Grads As Jobs Increase
## 
### 
Words of a more encouraging na
ture than in many years past have
issued this year from the office of
Miss Ruth Tracksell, head of the
Student Employment Service. All
students who have applied for work
probably will have jobs by October.
Reason for this is that the num
ber of jobs open this year is 50 per
cent above that of last June. Many
opportunities have had to be turned
down, with some students having as
many as four offers for permanent
positions.
Salaries Rise
Salary levels also have increased.
College graduates may now expect
between $90 and $105 monthly as
beginning incomes.
Greatest demand for new workers
comes from the engineering field.
Here employers are seeking more
men than are available. The demand
for selling positions also is high.
Companies place neophytes on defi
nite salaries, instead of on the old
commission basis.
Stanford - trained school marms
are also in great demand. The ma
jority are placed in California,
though administrative work takes
education graduates all over the
country.
Women's Jobs
Most women go into secretarial
and office work, though their lack of
training here at Stanford usually
necessitates nine months of addi
tional study at a secretarial school.
Women also find jobs in personnel
and social service work. One wom
an has gained a job as an engineer.
The journalism department reports
that every graduate now has landed
a job.
Over 95 per cent of business
school graduates are successful in
getting employment. Large national
firms are constantly demanding men
of the additional two years' train
ing. These include Proctor and
Gamble, Armstrong Cork, Firestone
Rubber, Goodrich Rubber, General
Electric, Westinghouse, U. S. Steel,
Shell and Standard Oil, Ingersoll-
Rand, Sears Roebuck, and American
Telephone and Telegraph.
