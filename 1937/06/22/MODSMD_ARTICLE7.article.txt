# Need for Plan Of Life Shown
## Yale Divinity Dean Talks At First Service 
### 
"Need for a Positive Plan of Life"
was the subject of Dr. Charles R.
Brown, Dean Emeritus of Yale Di
vinity School, at the opening church
service for summer quarter last
Sunday.
Admitting the necessity for a large
amount of doubt in the world, Dr.
Brown nevertheless showed the
weakness of a life which ends in
doubts. A possible creed of four
affirmations which do not do violence
to the intelligence of any man was
his suggestion for a good plan of life.
Dr. Brown is well known at Stan
ford, having lectured on ethics from
1899 to 1906. He also preached in
Oakland during that time.
Esther Houk Allen, wife of the
University organist, sang a solo in
the absence of a choir. The summer
quarter choir will be organized
Thursday at 7:15 in the choir room
in the basement of the Memorial
Church. Mr. Allen welcomes the
participation of any who may be
interested.
