### 
Lee Simonson, noted pioneer in
American stage design, will inaugu

with an illustrated lecture entitled
"Past Performances" tomorrow at 8

The lecture, first of a series Mr.
Simonson will deliver on the the
ater, will concern stage settings from
1535 to 1935. It will be followed
Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock by
"Alternatives" and by three othei

To Speak of Dinner
Following the Saturday afternoon
lecture, a dinner in honor of Mr.
Simonson will be held in the Union
at 6 p.m. at which a number of per
sons prominent in Bay region dra
matics will speak. Mr. Simonson
will make a few informal remarks
at this time.
Mr. Simonson was born in New
York City in 1888, which makes him
what native New Yorkers like to
call "one of those rare phenomena,
a native New Yorker." He was
graduated from Harvard in 1908, a
Phi Beta Kappa and winner of the
Bowdoin Prize for that year. Im
mediately upon graduating he left
for Paris, traditional mecca of Amer
ican art students, and studied paint
ing there until 1912.
Interested in Murals
Returning from Paris, Mr. Simon
son, then 24, became associated with
the Washington Square Players as
scene designer. His interest up to
this point had been directed toward
mural painting, but his work, espe
cially his use of color, with the
Washington Square Players was
hailed by many critics as the en
trance of the artist into the theater.
The Washington Square Players was,
at the time of Mr. Simonson's debut,
a group of players in Greenwich
Village who specialized in one-act
plays written and acted by its own
members, many of which are among
the best ever written and are still
being played extensively. The group
was prominent in instituting dra
matic reforms, and a number of its
graduates of whom Susan Glaspel
and George Cram Cook are two
leaders in the theater and allied
fields today.
In 1918 the Washington City Play
ers blossomed into the Theater
Guild, the most successful reper
tory theater in the United States,
and Mr. Simonson became a director
and scene-designer with the new or
ganization. A few of the sets which
he has designed for the Guild are
those for "Heartbreak House,"
"Elizabeth the Queen," "Marco
Millions," and "Apple Cart." Some

of his more recent sets are those
for 'Roar China" and "Idiot's De
light," the late Lunt vehicle, which
closed several days ago in San
Francisco. He has just completed
the stage set for "Amphitryon '38"
which the Lunts will introduce this
week at the Curran Theater.
