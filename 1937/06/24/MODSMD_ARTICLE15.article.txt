# 'Divine Sarah' Just a 'Ham' To Film Class
## Stylized Acting in Early Movie Is High Spot Of First Night Showings 
### 
The first program in a series on
the evolution of the motion picture
was shown last night in the Little
Theater (Room 100). Illustrated by
six features was the development of
narrative from 1894 to 1911.
"Wash Day Troubles" filmed in
1895 showed the first time a film
could do more than record and re
create; it could invent new stories.
The plot was short and simple. A
lady trying to hang clothes found
herself sitting in the washtub sev
eral minutes later at the climax.
Melies' "A Trip to the Moon" of
1902 illustrated the use of the first
scenario and the first attempt at
continuity.
"The Great Train Robbery" dem
onstrated how such daring exploits
as photography from the top of a
moving train thrilled and horrified
movie-goers of 1903.
The modern audience found it
hard to believe Sarah Bernhardt had
achieved such universal fame por
traying the stilted and stylized type
of acting as she displayed in "Queen
Elizabeth." While it constituted
great tragedy in 1911 to see Mss
Bernhardt die by falling stiffly face
down in a great pile of pillows, those
attending last night's performance
found the scene humorous. Since
"Queen Elizabeth" was little more
than a filmed drama it also proved
a record of the early-century legit
imate stage.
The next performance, to be given
Monday, July 12 ,will be on the
American comedy.
Tickets for any three of the re
maining four showings in this series
may be purchased in the A.S.S.U.
for $1.
