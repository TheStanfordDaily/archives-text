# Big Ten Meet Boasts Galaxy Of Trackmen
## Indian Relay Team May Lower World Record In L.A. Competition 
### HILMER LODGE 
"The greatest dual meet ever
staged."
That's what sports fans are say
ing of the Pacific Coast Conference
Big Ten all-star track and field
meet to be held at Los Angeles Sat
urday afternoon.
Seldom can a dual meet claim
such a galaxy of stars as Don Lash
of Indiana, premier distance man of
America; Earl Meadows and Bill
Sefton of U.S.C., greatest vaulters
in the world; Lem Ho wells of Ohio
State and Ray Malott of Stanford,
two of the finest quartermilers in
the country; and Pete Zagar and
Hugh Gribbin of Stanford, the two
leading collegiate discus throwers.
Relaymen May Compete
One world record may be in the
offing if the Pacific all-stars are able
to send their relay team of Jack
Weiershauser, Lee Orr, Bill Mc-
Curdy and Ray Malott out to see
how fast they can really amble.
In the shotput, Jim Reynolds will
have plenty of competition from Big
Bill Watson, University of Michi
gan, who in the National Collegiates
last week let the iron ball sail out
53 feet 6 inches, but fouled.
Tom Montgomery, other half of
Dink Templeton's shot-putting crew,
who was struck accidentally by
Dmitri Zaitz of Boston College with
a 16-pound shot, is out of the hos
pital and in Los Angeles. Tom
should be back into shape this week
and possibly score a third place.
Weiershauser May Star
If Jack Weiershauser concen
trates on the low hurdles, he may
be able to go close to 23 flat. But
if he is used in the 220, he may have
a stiff battle with Lee Orr of Wash
ington State.
Ray Malott will have easy sailing
in the quarter-mile without com
petition from Lorin Benke of Wash
ington State, who is passing up this
meet for a marital engagement. Lem
Howells of Ohio, Bill McCurdy of
Stanford and Bob Young of U.C.L.A.
probably will be fleet-footed Ray's
closest opposition.
