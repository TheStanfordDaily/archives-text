# Olympic Club Enters Indian Stars in A.A.M.
## 
### 
Drafted by the Olympic Club to
carry the Winged "O" into the Na
tional A.A.U. meet in Milwaukee,
July 3, three or four members of the
present Stanford varsity and five
one-time Card stars will set out Sat
urday night for the city of the amber
fluid.
The three contemporary thinclads
sure to go are Ray Malott in the 440,
Jack Weiershauser in his usual
quota of races, and Jim Reynolds
in the shot. Captain Bill McCurdy
is the doubtful entrant.
These men will leave Los Angeles
after the Big Ten meet Saturday
night and meet Charley Hunter and
his Clubmen in Ogden Sunday.
The Stanfords going with Charley
are Ray Dean, Phil Levy, and Hum
bert Smith of last year's team and
Johnnie Mottram and Slinger Dunn
of 1935.
Cecil Cole, the Junior College
champion, figured on to be a dark
horse mile sensation at the A.A.U.,
will not run in that meet or any
other this season. He has a job with
an oil company and will not enter
college next fall. Beyond that
nothing is definite as to his run
ning future.
Cole's partner at San Mateo, Bill
Wohle, 50-foot shot-putter, did not
register summer quarter, but said
he planned to matriculate here in
September.
