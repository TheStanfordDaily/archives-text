# Kaufman-Hart Play Reading Is 'Good Show'
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
That "You Can't Take It With
You," the George S. Kaufman-
Moss Hart Pulitzer prize winner for
1936-37 was not important enough
to win the Pulitzer prize, no one
who heard Mrs. Guy Stevens
Farrington read it Tuesday will
deny. That it is funny enough to
rank high as comedy, and that it
was deftly handled by Mrs. Far
rington no one will deny either.
Mrs. Farrington read easily, in
flected nimbly. She cut each char
acter clearly. Her reading of the
play was lively, pointed, and spir
ited.
As for the play itself, it is an ac
cepted fact that the playwright who
would bag the Pulitzer prize must
translate the American scene. Other
playwrights may try to reform the
world. But noble motive, or noble
play, they will not bag the Pulitzer
prize unless they limit themselves to
the American scene.
Thus, George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart, who did not once get in
the hair of the status quo when
they wrote their nice, harmless little
comedy, "You Can't Take It With
You," ran off with the Pulitzer
prize because they translated the
American scene.
More specifically, Kaufman and
Hart deal in "You Can't Take It
With You" with the American soul,
what it is and what it should be.
They tell the story of two American
families. The girl of one is in love
with the boy of the other. The girl's
family is completely natural, and
therefore, crazy. For instance, the
girl's mother is a playwright, be
cause "someone accidentally left a
typewriter in the house." Her grand
father is not liable to income tax
inspectors because at some time

previous he had a nameless milk
man buried under his name. He is
listed as dead. He also collects
snakes in the parlor.
The whole family, in fact, lives in
a nice amiable bedlam, shot
through with the philosophy that
God helps those that won't bother
to help themselves. This family has
a free soul. The soul of the boy's
family, on the other hand, is laced
tight by assorted ticker and red tape
of Wall Street and modern life, re
spectively. How the two families are

reconciled is the story.
All told, "You Can't Take It with
You" is a slight, but racy comedy.
Mrs. Farrington made the most of
all the best situations. She made
each part distinct with a nice pre
cision and timing. "You Can't Take
It With You" was an entertaining
reading.

play, they will not bag the Pulitzer
prize unless they limit themselves to
the American scene.
Thus, George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart, who did not once get in
the hair of the status quo when
they wrote their nice, harmless little
comedy, "You Can't Take It With
You," ran off with the Pulitzer
prize because they translated the
American scene.
More specifically, Kaufman and
Hart deal in "You Can't Take It
With You" with the American soul,
what it is and what it should be.
They tell the story of two American
families. The girl of one is in love
with the boy of the other. The girl's
family is completely natural, and
therefore, crazy. For instance, the
girl's mother is a playwright, be
cause "someone accidentally left a
typewriter in the house." Her grand
father is not liable to income tax
inspectors because at some time

previous he had a nameless milk
man buried under his name. He is
listed as dead. He also collects
snakes in the parlor.
The whole family, in fact, lives in
a nice amiable bedlam, shot
through with the philosophy that
God helps those that won't bother
to help themselves. This family has
a free soul. The soul of the boy's
family, on the other hand, is laced
tight by assorted ticker and red tape
of Wall Street and modern life, re
spectively. How the two families are

reconciled is the story.
All told, "You Can't Take It with
You" is a slight, but racy comedy.
Mrs. Farrington made the most of
all the best situations. She made
each part distinct with a nice pre
cision and timing. "You Can't Take
It With You" was an entertaining
reading.
That "You Can't Take It With
You," the George S. Kaufman-
Moss Hart Pulitzer prize winner for
1936-37 was not important enough
to win the Pulitzer prize, no one
who heard Mrs. Guy Stevens
Farrington read it Tuesday will
deny. That it is funny enough to
rank high as comedy, and that it
was deftly handled by Mrs. Far
rington no one will deny either.
Mrs. Farrington read easily, in
flected nimbly. She cut each char
acter clearly. Her reading of the
play was lively, pointed, and spir
ited.
As for the play itself, it is an ac
cepted fact that the playwright who
would bag the Pulitzer prize must
translate the American scene. Other
playwrights may try to reform the
world. But noble motive, or noble
play, they will not bag the Pulitzer
prize unless they limit themselves to
the American scene.
