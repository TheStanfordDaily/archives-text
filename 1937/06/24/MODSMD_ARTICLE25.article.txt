# FIREARM LAW ENFORCED
## 
### 
In contrast to the guns carried by
many Americans for their own pro
tection, German citizens arm them
selves with small guns especially
made for firing blank cartridges or
tear gas. Because of strict regula
tions, German guns are made to
explode if loaded cartridges are fired.
