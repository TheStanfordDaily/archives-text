# Angus To Talk On Far East
## Peace Change New Professor To Speak On Changing Relations With Orient Tonight 
### 
"Peaceful Change in the Pacific"
will be the topic of a speech by H. F.
Angus, acting professor of econom
ics and political science tonight at
8 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Angus, who comes from
the University of British Columbia,
will endeavor to show the changes
which have been peacefully made in
the Pacific area during the last 10
years. He will explain especially the
difference between Chinese and
Japanese demands.
Asks for Equality
China, he explained, has made
claims of tariff autonomy and an
end to extraterritoriality, claims
which attempt to bring back to her
equality with other nations and the
rights of a sovereign state. Japan
has made claims to immigration, ac
cess to raw materials, and access to
foreign markets, claims which are
morally good, but which go beyond
sovereign rights. These claims re
quire other countries to give up
part of their own sovereign rights.
Professor Angus will endeavor to
show how Chinese claims have been
received sympathetically, Japanese
not.
Made Research
The oriental question has been a
special hobby of the lecturer. He
has done much research on the
United States and Canadian atti
tudes toward the yellow race. Japa
nese are not allowed naturalization
in the United States because of our
Exclusion Bill. Japanese who are
born here, however, are United
States citizens and have the right to
vote.
In Canada all legislation regard
ing "aliens" is federal, Professor An
gus says. Not so affected by the
pressure of small groups, the Do
minion allows Japanese entry into
Canada on the quota basis and per
mits naturalization. Once Canadian
citizens, however, Japanese are sub
ject to provincial laws. The Province
of British Columbia has therefore
forbidden Japanese suffrage, al
though Japanese may vote in any
other province.
Prevents Ownership
British Columbia makes no land
owning restriction. The state of
Washington, however, does not per
mit a foreigner to own land except
for industrial purposes. This is de
signed to exclude Japanese and
Chinese, but it applies as well to
British Columbians who otherwise
would own summer resorts across
the boundary in Washington.
The Japanese quota entry into
Canada is limited to 150 per year.
There is no resentment in Japan as
there is toward the United States on
a non-quota arrangement, Profes
sor Angus says. Canada treats the
Chinese, however, in the same man
ner we do. Exclusion has been a
necessity mainly because it has been
impossible to determine which gov
ernment in China would be respon
sible.
A current problem of present in
terest to Professor Angus is that of
the Japanese floating fish canneries
off the Alaskan islands. They are
able to interrupt the fish stream be
fore it reaches American fishermen.
The United States is more affected
than Canada.
Legally, the United States case is
not a good one, Professor Angus
says, because of our adherence to
the principle of "freedom of the
seas." If claims are made on a basis
of fairness and ethics, Japan will
point to our Exclusion Bill.
