# Labor Troubles Delay Construction Programs
## 
### 
Steel strikes will hold up the prog
ress of the Cubberley Education
Building as they did on the Me
morial Hall, according to Alfred L.
Trowbridge, assistant comptroller.
Soon, however, the steel will be
available; probably on July 26, but
until then the work will continue on
the foundation rather leisurely.
If the work goes along on sched
ule without further delays the
buildings will be ready for occu
pancy by next year sometime. The
entire school of education will be
housed there with classrooms and
offices, and an auditorium which can
be used for any other department
which can make use of it will be in
cluded.
Work on the Memorial Hall is pro
gressing so rapidly that by Friday
night the permanent seats will be in
on the ground floor of the auditorium
and Lee Simonson, set designer for
the Theater Guild, will deliver a lec
ture there then.
Includes Classrooms
The building includes, besides the
main auditorium, a little theater,
classrooms, and offices for the pub
lic speech department.

When the Memorial Hall is func
tioning there will be no further use
for the old auditorium as such, and
so it is being converted into a new
department of classrooms and of
fices for the graduate school of busi
ness. When the construction there is
finished, there will be a library hous
ing about 40,000 volumes included in
the section. A sum of $110,000 is be
ing expended on that unit, which
will include two stories.
Make Annex
The space used at present by the
business school will be converted,
then, into an annex for the biology
department so that more equipment
may be housed.
Two new wings of Lagunita Hall
will be ready for occupancy by next
fall quarter under the same provisos
as the educational building, if no
strikes interfere with construction.
The wings will house 80 more wom
en, raising the tenancy of the build
ing to a possible 290 in all. Each
wing will be connected to the pres
ent building by a corridor and the
entire project will be finished in
architecture of the same design as
the old wings.
