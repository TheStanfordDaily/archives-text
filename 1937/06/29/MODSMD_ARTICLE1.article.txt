# Deadline Near; Play Entries Flood Judges
## Anderson Verse Contest Draws 100 Manuscripts From Entire Country 
### 
With only two days remaining un
til the July 1 deadline, manuscripts
for the Maxwell Anderson Prize
Play Contest are being received at
the rate of more than 20 a day, con
test officials report.
The competition, open only to
plays in verse, has attracted wide
spread interest in both the United
States and Canada among college
and non-college writers. Plays will
be graded by eight judges, four
from professional ranks, and four
from universities. The latter include
Margery Bailey, Hubert Heffner,
Bayard Morgan, and Margaret
Storey.
Professionals Judge
Judges connected with the profes
sional stage are Burgess Meredith,
star of numerous Broadway produc
tions, Guthrie McClintic, producer,
Helen Deutsch and Harold Freed-
man. The winner will receive a cash
award of $300, an increase of $200
over last year's prize.
Miss Florette Henri, alumna of
Columbia University in New York,
whose "Surrey" won the contest last
year from a field of 98 entries, has
already submitted her selection for
this year's contest, as has DeWitt
Bodine, associate director of the
Pasadena Playhouse. Most of the
hundred or more plays received are
based on historical subjects, includ
ing narratives dealing with Captain
John Smith, Shelley, Catherine Parr
and Lady Jane Grey. However, a
substantial number deal with pres
ent-day American themes, includ
ing three in modern racial dialects.
