versity's fifth annual educational
conference, opening July 7, it was
announced Monday.
With Harvard's Psychiatrist Doug
las A. Thom and Dean Grayson N.
Kefauver of the Stanford School of
Education officiating as leaders,
"Mental and physical health for
America's school children" will be
the major theme of the parley.
Authorities To Attend
Under the theme, the conference
will investigate the results of tradi
tional classroom practices on the
personality of growing children.
Nationally known psychologists
who will participate in the meet in
clude Dr. Thom, Dr. Alvin C. Eu
rick of the University of Minnesota,
and Dr. Lewis M. Terman, Stanford
co-author of the intelligence test.
Approximately 1200 school men will
attend, the department said.
According to its charter, "the com
mission seeks to stimulate thought
ful, realistic, long-time planning
within the teaching profession, to
bring about desirable changes in the
purposes of procedure and to or
ganize education on a nation-wide
basis."
Exerts Influence
The commission, organized Janu
ary, 1936, received its charter from
the National Education Association
and the Department of Superintend
ence.
While without official executive
powers, the commission exerts strong
influence over large sections of
American education, leaders stated.
In line with this year's theme,
Dean Kefauver commented: "Edu
cators are becoming increasingly
aware that the task of public edu
cation does not end in mere schol
arship. Just as parents, teachers
must assume responsibility for the
mental health of their actions, and
therefore must not forget that their
classroom techniques will profound
ly influence children, either for good
or for ill."
Teachers who weigh the mental
needs of their students might con
tribute to building more sane and
healthy attitudes toward life, Dean
Kefauver contends.
The report of the commission will
supplement the major conference
emphasis on mental and physical
health for America's school chil
dren.
