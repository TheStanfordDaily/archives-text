# Stanfordiana History Kept Locked in Library
## 
### BILL BRETT 
Stanford's past, as revealed in ponderous records, in student publica
tions, in ancient "treasure books," and in photographs of campus buildings
which no longer exist, is locked up in a tiny room on the second floor of
the library. Known as the "Stanford Collection." this archive collection of
Stanfordiana contains a wealth of original source material about Stanford
University, its founders, its faculty, its students, and its campus.

' Much of the material is of an of
ficial nature, such as the volumes of
President's Reports, and collections
of syllabi.
Publications Filed
Complete files of the Quad, the
Sequoia, the Chaparral, and the
Daily are also in the collection. The
first proof made of the "Daily Palo
Alto," which was the original stu
dent paper, has been preserved, with
the note that it was made on Tues
day, September 20, 1892, at 1:35
p.m., in the office of the "Redwood
City Democrat."
The paper was about the size of
the present summer Daily, and the
principal front pages stories were
headed "Last Tuesday's Lecture,"
"Berkeley Notes," "Athletics," and
"The Alumni."
Used for Book
The Stanford Collection is not list
ed in the library catalog, nor is it
open to ordinary student inspection.
Rather, it is an accumulation of orig
inal source material of real histor
ical value, dating from the inception
of the University to the present. It
was used extensively by Dr. Elliott
when he wrote his recent book,
'Stanford, the First Twenty-five
Years."
At present the activities of the
University are so many and complex
that it is becoming increasingly dif
ficult to obtain all the publications
of various sorts with which the Uni
versity is concerned. Material is
constantly being sent in by alumni,
however, and it is the hope of Miss
Alice Hayes, custodian of the col
lection, that this practice will con
tinue so that the record of Stanford's
progress may be kept complete and
up-to-date.
