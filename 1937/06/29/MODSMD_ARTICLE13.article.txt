# Angus Explains Strife in East
## Lecturer Labels Japan Tube of Toothpaste' 
### 
"Japan is a tube of tooth paste,
her people are the paste, and the
nations of the West are the fingers
squeezing the paste out of the tube
into Manchuria."
This comparison was made by
Professor H. F. Angus last Thurs
day evening in his speech on
"Changes in the Pacific."
If Japan is to support her popula
tion at home, he said, she must
change from an agricultural nation
to a manufacturing one. This is im
possible without a certainty abroad
of export markets and sources of
foodstuffs and raw materials.
Out of the Manchurian question
Professor Angus drew the differ
ences between current Chinese and
Japanese demands. China desires to
get back what she once had and
makes no demands treading on the
sovereign rights of other countries.
Japan's Manchurian demands en
croach on China's rights. If granted
all her claims, she would find more
to make. Because of this, Professor
Angus feels, the chance for peace
ful settlement seems unlikely.
Professor Angus says, however,
"There is the possibility that if
countries begin any kind of inter
national planning with common in
terests, then peaceful changes may
occur as 'by-products'."

As the earth, traveling along its
orbit, passes the other planets, they
appear to travel backwards, making
a complete loop in the sky, before
resuming their original direction.
