# Indians Break World Record In Mile Relay
## Coast Conference Beats Big Ten All – Stars In Los Angeles Contests 
### 
One existing world record toppled
and another was tied at Los Angeles
Saturday afternoon when the Pa
cific Coast Conference track and
field team defeated the Big Ten All-
Stars 92 to 44.
Three Stanford quartermilers, Ray
Malott, Jack Weiershauser, and
Captain Bill McCurdy, teamed up
with Harry Nettleton of Washington
State and broke the present accepted
world record for the one-mile relay,
supplanting the standard set in 1931
by a Stanford team of Maynor Shoke,
Ike and Abe Hables, and Ben East
man of 3:12.6, with 3:11.8. A British
team anchored by A. G. K. Brown,
second-place winner in last year's
Olympic Games, has a time of 3:10
which is up for consideration.
Malott's Time 47.1
Ironman Weiershauser opened the
afternoon's festivities by anchoring
a four-man quarter-mile sprint relay
team composed of George Boone of
S.C., and Lee Orr and Curt Ledford
of Washington State, which tied the
world record of 40.7 made by an
S.C. team at Fresno in 1936.
It was the 440 which really
brought Stanford enthusiasts to their
feet as the Indians' quartermiler,
Ray Malott, came thundering down
the home stretch for a Coast victory
and in doing so pulled along his
team-mate, Captain McCurdy. The
time of 47.1 is the fastest quarter
mile Malott has ever run. McCur
dy's approximate time was 47.4.
Woodruff Fails
Johnny Woodruff ran a special
race at Los Angeles Saturday in an
attempt to erase Ben Eastman's
world record of 46.4. He fell far
short, running 47.3—tw0-tenths of a
second above Malott's winning time.
He was racing against A1 Fitch,
former S.C. ace.
Jack Weiershauser came back
after his sprint relay performance
to take a bang-up second to Lee
Orr of Washington State, who won
in 21 seconds.

and in doing so pulled along his
team-mate, Captain McCurdy. The
time of 47.1 is the fastest quarter
mile Malott has ever run. McCur
dy's approximate time was 47.4.
Woodruff Fails
Johnny Woodruff ran a special
race at Los Angeles Saturday in an
attempt to erase Ben Eastman's
world record of 46.4. He fell far
short, running 47.3—tw0-tenths of a
second above Malott's winning time.
He was racing against A1 Fitch,
former S.C. ace.
Jack Weiershauser came back
after his sprint relay performance
to take a bang-up second to Lee
Orr of Washington State, who won
in 21 seconds.
