A year ago Ray Malott was a
second-rate half-miler, but last
Saturday Dink Tempclton's find
ran the second fastest 440 ever run
by a Stanford man. Ben Eastman,
who holds the Farm 440 record, is
also the world record holder at
40.4—the man Malott must bow to
—at least for the present, for he
is but a junior and may really go
places next year.
