The Late Christopher Bean; Palo
Alto Community Players; Commun
ity Theater. Some years ago, Sid
ney Howard minted a bright, new
Broadway coin, "The Late Christo
pher Bean." No theatrical gold
piece, it was merely a "good for
amuseemnt only "slug." Despite its
age, it was still good for that, still
definitely in circulation when it
came to the Palo Alto Community
Theater last week.
However, the players, as a whole,
wandered about happily through it,
acting and reacting all right, but not
necessarily on each other or to a
situation —just at random. Fred
Clark as Dr. Haggard played intel
ligently, but he used the same Ed
gar Kennedy hair-pull that he used
in the baby-killing act. He should
shelve his stock mannerisms. All
told, "The Late Christopher Bean,"
despite a not-very-well-co-ordinat
ed production, was still amusing on
the strength of its own sound com
edy.
Parnell; currently playing at the
Fox-Stanford—shows what happens
when biography is mistaken for sce
nario. The action trudged up to at
least three climaxes which was pret
ty tiring. But—Myrna Loy's words
still drip from her mouth like honey
off a spoon; Clark Gable is still
handsome; "Parnell" is still an in
teresting life story of an Irish revo
lutionary.
Amphitryon 38; currently at aSn
Francisco's Curran. Ampitryon
38 will be a very sleek comedy when
stray wisps of dialogue are trimmed
off to make it hug smoothly to the
plot. Meanwhile, San Francisco,
guinea - pig audience for the latest
Lunt-Fontanne piece, was definitely
infected with its audacious brand of
wit. Amphitryon is all about Jupi
ter who woos alkamena, who is al
ready married and chaste and re
fuses to be wooed.
Brother Rat; at San Francisco's
Geary—still packs them in for a third
week to watch the lunatics of
V.M.I.
KSFO's day looks cold in the
morning, warm in the afternoon, and
hot in the evening, with a Benny
Goodman heat-wave blowing from
the East via C.B.S. at 5:30. A1 Jol
son's Cafe Trocadero bows out for
the season at 7:30 with Martha Raye
and Parkykarkus.

A violin is composed of 70 separate
