# Simonson Lauds Farm Dramatics Discusses Early Scenery
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Attempting to explode a popular (
misconception concerning the bare
ness of early stage design, Lee Si
monson, noted Theater Guild scene
designer, Friday night showed his
audience in Memorial Hall slides il
lustrating his tenets.
Mr. Simonson's lecture was en- i
titled "Past Performances" and was
devoted to a discussion of stage de
signing |rom 1535 to 1935. The
main theme of the lecture was an
effort to disprove the idea, acquired
in the classroom and elsewhere, that
stage sets were practically non-ex
istent in Shakespearean and earlier
dramatic productions. Contrary to
this generally accepted idea, stage
sets in many of these "primitive"
productions were extremely real
istic and elaborate.
Slides Illustrate
Illustrating his lecture with slides
which showed a realistic Hell and
Noah's flood reconstructed with
water-filled wine barrels, Mr. Si
monson told his audience that the
stage designer was a very important
man in the early theater, and audi
ences at many plays then were not
required to use their imaginations
any more than contemporary audi
ences are.
"Alternatives," Mr. Simonson's
Saturday afternoon lecture, brought j
out the theme that there is no one I
way of designing a set for a play.
Mr. Simonson showed, with slides, a
number of sets for (he same play
and pointed out that no one of them '
was right or wrong. They were I
simply different.
Cites Unit Setting
He told his listeners that many of
' the methods of stage design which
j are popularly supposed to be recent;
I have actually been known and used !
for hundreds of years, such as the j
unit setting, in which certain basic
parts of the set remain throughout i
the production, while the scene
around these parts is changed.
Last night, Mr. Simonson deliv
ered a lecture entitled "Plan of Ac- <
lion." Tonight at 8 o'clock he will !
talk on the development of the mod
ern director, and tomorrow night at
8 o'clock he will discuss the theater
and the community.

Mr. Lee Simonson, Theater Guild
set designer, swung his varnished
cane as he walked, and began: "The
new theater here is marvelous. Look
at the floor—a place where you can
drive nails. And the lighting is ade
quate.
"I like the simplicity of the archi
tecture, too. I prefer simplicity in
architecture in any case." (Those
who saw "Amphitryon 38" remember
the angular simplicity of his sets.)
"Just a personal preference, of
course. Furthermore, unlike most
theaters, this one was built by some
one who really understood theater
architecture. Everything here at
tests to that."
Mr. Lee Simonson, a small, dark,
unsmiling man with large, dark,
smiling eyes, tucked his varnished
cane under his arm, stopped walk
ing, and added:
"Of course this new project here
will serve both as a cultural me
dium and as preparation by students
for the professional stage. Any pro
duction culturally worth while is of
professional calibre, anyway. You
can't differentiate between the two.
"That brings up the question of
training students. Although I am
not familiar with the teaching end
of dramatics, I certainly think it has
a future in the United States today.
Mr. Lee Simonson aimed his var
nished cane at the lights, and
called over his shoulder:
"I need more light here, Johan
sen."

Attempting to explode a popular (
misconception concerning the bare
ness of early stage design, Lee Si
monson, noted Theater Guild scene
designer, Friday night showed his
audience in Memorial Hall slides il
lustrating his tenets.
Mr. Simonson's lecture was en- i
titled "Past Performances" and was
devoted to a discussion of stage de
signing |rom 1535 to 1935. The
main theme of the lecture was an
effort to disprove the idea, acquired
in the classroom and elsewhere, that
stage sets were practically non-ex
istent in Shakespearean and earlier
dramatic productions. Contrary to
this generally accepted idea, stage
sets in many of these "primitive"
productions were extremely real
istic and elaborate.
Slides Illustrate
Illustrating his lecture with slides
which showed a realistic Hell and
Noah's flood reconstructed with
water-filled wine barrels, Mr. Si
monson told his audience that the
stage designer was a very important
man in the early theater, and audi
ences at many plays then were not
required to use their imaginations
any more than contemporary audi
ences are.
"Alternatives," Mr. Simonson's
Saturday afternoon lecture, brought j
out the theme that there is no one I
way of designing a set for a play.
Mr. Simonson showed, with slides, a
number of sets for (he same play
and pointed out that no one of them '
was right or wrong. They were I
simply different.
Cites Unit Setting
He told his listeners that many of
' the methods of stage design which
j are popularly supposed to be recent;
I have actually been known and used !
for hundreds of years, such as the j
unit setting, in which certain basic
parts of the set remain throughout i
the production, while the scene
around these parts is changed.
Last night, Mr. Simonson deliv
ered a lecture entitled "Plan of Ac- <
lion." Tonight at 8 o'clock he will !
talk on the development of the mod
ern director, and tomorrow night at
8 o'clock he will discuss the theater
and the community.

Mr. Lee Simonson, Theater Guild
set designer, swung his varnished
cane as he walked, and began: "The
new theater here is marvelous. Look
at the floor—a place where you can
drive nails. And the lighting is ade
quate.
"I like the simplicity of the archi
tecture, too. I prefer simplicity in
architecture in any case." (Those
who saw "Amphitryon 38" remember
the angular simplicity of his sets.)
"Just a personal preference, of
course. Furthermore, unlike most
theaters, this one was built by some
one who really understood theater
architecture. Everything here at
tests to that."
Mr. Lee Simonson, a small, dark,
unsmiling man with large, dark,
smiling eyes, tucked his varnished
cane under his arm, stopped walk
ing, and added:
"Of course this new project here
will serve both as a cultural me
dium and as preparation by students
for the professional stage. Any pro
duction culturally worth while is of
professional calibre, anyway. You
can't differentiate between the two.
"That brings up the question of
training students. Although I am
not familiar with the teaching end
of dramatics, I certainly think it has
a future in the United States today.
