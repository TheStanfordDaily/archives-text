# Campus Critic Okehs Latest Marx Cinema

"A Day at the Races," currently play
ing at the Fox-Stanford Theater:
The Marx Brothers made a per
sonal appearance in San Francisco
with the script of this one. The
writer stood in the wings, and blue
pencilled bromide gags, according to
audience reaction.
Now they're off and up to edited
"lun-antics" in the finished film.
Groucho plays a horse-doctor. He
gets in a swank hospital on a fluke
and plays doctor to the horsey.
Harpo, he of the floor-mop hair, the
cleverest idiot of them all, is a jock
ey. Chico runs also.
In addition, thei'e is plenty of ac
tion getting nowhere in the best
Marx manner. "A Day at the Races"
is a typical Marx picture—funnier
than many and as funny as any.
On the same program, "The Hos
pital Murder" baffles everybody up
to the last minute. Sally Blane,
winsome sister of Loretta Young,
and Jane Darwell are featured.
Dial: KGO today at 2:15 for Wim
bledon finals, via short-wave; to
night at 8 for Ted Lewis' Chez
Paree orchestra. Tune in: KPO to
night at 6 for Bing Crosby.
