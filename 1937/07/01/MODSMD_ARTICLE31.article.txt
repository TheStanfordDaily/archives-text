Faithful to the spirits of '76 and
Vat 69, I have determined to devote
today's footnotes on the sands of
Time to the glorification of the god
dess of Liberty, in whose honor we
will sleep late next Monday morn
ing.
Somewhere between the dark and
the daylight, when the punch is be
ginning to sour, there will come a
lull in our bomb and bull throwing
activities. It is only fitting that we
should devote this to quiet rever
ence for those who have been instru
mental in making Liberty more than
a legendary figure on the legendary
twenty-five-cent piece.
* * *
My nominations for this moment
of silent thanks are Henry Ford,
Walter Chrysler and General Mo
tors. For the freedom that this trio
has brought to college students out
shines the combined contributions of
our forefathers, our foremothers
and the three bears.
Reports and charters to the con
trary, few undergraduates were
ever permitted even a mild flirtation
with Lady Liberty until the flivver
made its blot on the page of history.
Of course, there were no ostenta
tious restrictions, and, theoretically,
the college man was as free as an
advertising sample.
But the founders of our intel
lectual nurseries had usually seen to
it that quite a bit of wilderness sep
arated them from civilization; and
the student who wanted to venture
from dear alma mater's arms was
faced with a pilgrim's progress that
made Bunyan look like an arm
chair traveller.
* * *
It does not take exhaustive re
search to determine why the Farm
men of three decades ago stayed on
the campus, went to bed early, and

generally found a path through the
sad hearts of professors.
But, enter the automobile, and ex
eunt the students. For the first time
in the history of American universi
ties, undergraduates were able to
cash in on their freedom.
It is to the everlasting glory of
college administrations generally
that they accepted the automobile
with good grace. Of course, some
complain bitterly that their charges
are lighting cigarettes with hell-fire,
and they speak bitterly of the high
way flesh-pots. But most have ac
cepted the new situation with true
Christian spirit.
* * *
The new set-up may not spread
quite as much sweetness and light
among the faculty as the old stay-at
home system, but it comes closer to
real education. After all, colleges
ostensibly prepare us for life, and
four years on an isolated campus is
hardly "seeing the world." The Lady
of Shallott saw everything in her
mirror, but she came off second best
when she met Lancelot.
And so, at the end of the lull in
our life that is July 4, let us gather
in humble thanksgiving. After
which we will take up a collection
and buy gas. —John Cobbs

has brought to college students out
shines the combined contributions of
our forefathers, our foremothers
and the three bears.
Reports and charters to the con
trary, few undergraduates were
ever permitted even a mild flirtation
with Lady Liberty until the flivver
made its blot on the page of history.
Of course, there were no ostenta
tious restrictions, and, theoretically,
the college man was as free as an
advertising sample.
But the founders of our intel
lectual nurseries had usually seen to
it that quite a bit of wilderness sep
arated them from civilization; and
the student who wanted to venture
from dear alma mater's arms was
faced with a pilgrim's progress that
made Bunyan look like an arm
chair traveller.

It does not take exhaustive re
search to determine why the Farm
men of three decades ago stayed on
the campus, went to bed early, and

generally found a path through the
sad hearts of professors.
But, enter the automobile, and ex
eunt the students. For the first time
in the history of American universi
ties, undergraduates were able to
cash in on their freedom.
It is to the everlasting glory of
college administrations generally
that they accepted the automobile
with good grace. Of course, some
complain bitterly that their charges
are lighting cigarettes with hell-fire,
and they speak bitterly of the high
way flesh-pots. But most have ac
cepted the new situation with true
Christian spirit.

The new set-up may not spread
quite as much sweetness and light
among the faculty as the old stay-at
home system, but it comes closer to
real education. After all, colleges
ostensibly prepare us for life, and
four years on an isolated campus is
hardly "seeing the world." The Lady
of Shallott saw everything in her
mirror, but she came off second best
when she met Lancelot.
And so, at the end of the lull in
our life that is July 4, let us gather
in humble thanksgiving. After
which we will take up a collection
and buy gas. —John Cobbs
Faithful to the spirits of '76 and
Vat 69, I have determined to devote
today's footnotes on the sands of
Time to the glorification of the god
dess of Liberty, in whose honor we
will sleep late next Monday morn
ing.
Somewhere between the dark and
the daylight, when the punch is be
ginning to sour, there will come a
lull in our bomb and bull throwing
activities. It is only fitting that we
should devote this to quiet rever
ence for those who have been instru
mental in making Liberty more than
a legendary figure on the legendary
twenty-five-cent piece.

My nominations for this moment
of silent thanks are Henry Ford,
