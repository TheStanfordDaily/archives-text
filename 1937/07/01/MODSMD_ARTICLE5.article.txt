# Bawlout Out Tomorrow—Is Your Name In?

### ROBERT IRELAND, C.O.D., 46+19 
Book Review—Not a Paid Adver
tisement.
The Stanford Dictionary of Useful
Information. Also known as the Di
rectory of Officers and Students. To
yo*se guys, the Bawlout. A neat
little volume, bound in hand-tooled
Morocco cardboard, containing all
you ought to know, and much that
should be suppressed. Date of pub
lication: tomorrow morning. Price:
15 cents, 3/20ths of a dollar, plus a
penny for Governor Merriam. You
can get it at the Ad Building, worse
luck. They didn't even publish proofs
this quarter, so you haven't got a
chance.
Among the articles featured will
be a little jewel by Beltramo E.
Auten, LD 23—7, on highway con
ditions between here and Menlo
Park. Thousands of dollars have
been spent on research on this sub
ject.
In the industrial section will be
found an exhaustive treatise on
methods of apple-polishing by Sally
Kappa, Psych. 96+179 (without half
trying). "The Wages of Sin," by
Montgomery J. Sousse, LD o—2B,0 —28,
now at Manhattan Barber's College,
is of more than passing interest.
Professor Bloodgood of the Chair
of Introverted Aesthetics gives the
book his whole-hearted endorse
ment. "Why bother working out a
grading curve, when you have the
bawlout? If the chumps in my
classes are minus, who am I to go
against the judgment of my faculty
colleagues?" Joe Goone, campus
Lothario, backs the professor in
spirit if not in letter. "Those who
know never date girls who are more
than plus 5. They will usually spend
the evening discussing Thomas Hux
ley, or worrying about their 10:30
lockout."
