Author of a large number of suc

less Victory," "Masque of Kings,"
and "High Tor," were produced this
year on Broadway, the latter win
ning the Critics' Prize as best play
of the year. Maxwell Anderson
ranks as one of America's most im

his Master's degree at Stanford in
1914, and for a time was an instruc

Historical Subjects
Miss Florette Henri, graduate of
New York's Columbia University
whose "Surrey" won the contest last
year from a field of 98 entries, has
already submitted her selection for
this year's contest.
Most of the plays received are
based on historical subjects, includ
ing narratives dealing with Captain
John Smith, Shelley, Catherine Parr,
and Lady Jane Grey. However, a
substantial number deal with pres
ent-day American themes, including
three in modern racial dialects.
