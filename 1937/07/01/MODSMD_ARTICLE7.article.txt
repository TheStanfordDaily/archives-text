# Simonson Talks On Play Director
## 
### 
That directors as we know them
today were non-existent until the
opening of the present century was
explained by Mr. Lee Simonson in
his lecture, "The Development of
the Modern Director," last Tuesday
evening.
Stars, far from being products of
the twentieth century movie indus
try, flourished, to a degree now un
known, in the days of Booth and
Barrett. In their time, there was no
rehearsal of the entire company be
fore a play. A great actor, such as
Edwin Booth, would hire a company
of actors to fill out the cast of the
play, and the performance would
consist of walkings on and off of
these players.
Mr. Simonson told his audience
that the birth of realistic stage
properties came when the Duke of
Saxe-Meinigen began experimenting
in his court theater with realistic
properties.
In his lecture last night, Mr Si
monson discussed the theater and
the community.
