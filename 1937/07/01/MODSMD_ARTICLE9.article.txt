# Bemis To Give Far East Talk
## Professor Will Discuss U.S. Foreign Policy 
### 
American foreign policy in the Far
East will be discussed by Professor
Samuel Flagg Bemis of Yale tonight
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theater in
Memorial Hall. The lecturer is con
sidered by Ralph Haswell Lutz of
the Stanford history department to
be one of the foremost experts on
the foreign policy of the United
States and especially of this nation's
relations in the Far East %
Dr. Bemis will tell of the mis
take of the acquisition of the Philip
pines and what is wrong with the
Open Door policy, which he believes
is the reason for serious diplomatic
issues between the United States
and Japan. He feels that American
foreign policy in the Far East is now
in a process of readjustment and
clarification, as he will show by sev
eral examples tonight.
If the United States will step aside
and let other nations more directly
concerned, such as England and the
Netherlands, take care of the Open
Door, though still maintaining
strong national defenses, Dr. Bemis
feels that Japanese - American re
lations would gradually drift from
worse to better.
