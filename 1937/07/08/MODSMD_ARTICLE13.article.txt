# Bemis Brands U.S. Far East Plan Blunder
## Policy Declared at Fault; Interest in Philippines Not Considered Vital 
### 
'American foreign policy in the
Far East since 1898 has exhibited a
.series of colossal diplomatic blun
ders," declared Dr. Samuel Flagg
Bemis in his lecture Thursday night
:;n the Memorial Hall.
Acquisition of the Philippines, he
said, was the first significant mis
step in the diplomatic history of the
United tSates, as there had been no
serious mistake before that time.
"The ensuing Open Door policy
was also a mistake," he asserted,
"because it committed the United
States to a major policy—a major
policy like the Monroe Doctrine—in
a region of the world where the
United States had then, and even
xiow, no vital interests." The Peace
<${ Portsmouth, the Knox neutraliza
tion proposals for Manchurian rail
x'oads, and "not to mention" the
.'Stimson doctrine were other diplo
matic blunders the speaker noted.
! The clarification of the Far East
ern policy, Dr. Bemis suggested,
Would result in the relinquishment
of any active diplomacy on the con
linen t of Asia and a retreat from
territorial possessions in the Far
East. He stated that he was em
phatically for a big navy and an
adequate air force as a means of
Keeping the peace of the Pacific on
l|he line of Alaska-Honolulu-Pana
»|na. Under these conditions he felt
that Japanese - American relations
would gradually drift from "worse
to better."
