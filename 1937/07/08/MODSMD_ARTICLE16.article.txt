# Ph.D.'s Lose To Examiner Ace Reporter
## 
### WILLIAM R. HASSENPFEFFER 
Despite the fact that California
boasts of the best educational facil
ities in the United States, some sign
painter on the Golden Gate Bridge
failed to take advantage of them,
according to yesterday's San Fran
cisco Examiner.
For over a month since the open
ing of the span the more literate
section of the population has been
offended, shocked and aggrieved by
a sign on the Waldo approach say
ing, "Do Not Blow Horn in Tun
nell." In the parlance of the Hearst
house organ, college professors and
Ph.D.'s galore swooned at the sight
of this colossal blunder ("butch,"
to you).
It is unfortunate that the engi
neering geniuses of the Golden Gate
Bridge, or the bright tights of the
San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, failed to wipe this blot from
the escutcheon of Marin County,
San Francisco, the Golden Bear
Flag and the western half of the
United States in general. However,
the strangest feature of the case is
that an Examiner reporter, of all
people, discovered the misspelling.
Daily correspondents at San Sim
eon were unable to contact the
Examiner's owner at a late hour
last night, but it is assumed that in
order to preserve the Examiner's
well known standards of journalism,
the reporter in question will be
transferred to either the Tokio or
Memphis branch.
