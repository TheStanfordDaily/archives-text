# English Club Publishes Best Campus Writings
## 
### 
Offering a representative selection
of the best that is being written on |
the Stanford campus, the 1937 Year
book of Stanford Writing, published
by English Club, is devoted chiefly ;
to fiction and contains a number of I
stories which are truly outstanding, j
Especially notable is Ernestine j
Magagna's "Broken Patterns," a
psychological narrative dealing with
the process by which a bereaved
woman was able to escape from pain- i
ful memories. The story is handled !
throughout with delicate skill and
restraint.
Realism Successfully
In "Twelfth Birthday," Eleanor
Jansen shows a keen insight into ;
the adolescent mind. The story, I
through the medium of remarkably
well-written dialogue and stream-of
consciousness, gives an unforget- '
table portrait of a weak and pathet
ic little girl just on the threshold of
what must be a sordid and unhappy i
life. Because it is unpretentious and j
realistic, it is one of the most sue- !
cessful stories in the yearbook.
Strange Drama
Unforgettable also is the setting
which J. Grant Liebert creates as
the background of a conflict be
tween himself and some unknown
creature in his "The Island and the
Animal." The island is somewhere

on the upper bayâ€”a place ol wind
and sky and salt marshes, and is so
well described that by the time the
reader finishes the story he feels as
if he, too, had some part in the
strange drama. Leibert is the win
ner of the Howard Judson Hall
prose prize of $25.
