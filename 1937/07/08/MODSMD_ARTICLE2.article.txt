# Noted Physicist Will Join Staff
## Fermi, Italian Scientist, Here This Summer 
### 
Professor Enrico Fermi, Italy's
foremost physicist, whose book,
"Thermodynamics," written espe
cially for American students to be
ready for 1937 fall courses, will ar
rive at Stanford July 18 to act as
professor in the physics department
for the remainder of the summer
quarter.
Dr. Fermi, a member of the Ital
ian Royal Academy, is one of the
world's most noted authorities on
the structure of the atom, and is
the finder of the heaviest bit of
matter ever known on this planet,
chemical element No. 93.
He is the founder of the promi
nent "Fermi School" of physicists
in Rome which is noted for its ex
periments on the construction of the
nuclei of atoms.
Dr. Fermi has, by bombardment
with neutrons, induced radioactivity
in more elements (about 40) than
has any other scientist. He is also
the maker of the Fermi Statistics
and the discoverer of the much dis
cussed "neutrino."
Written in his usual straightfor
ward easy-to-read style, from the
point of view of the student who has
had the general course in physics,
Dr. Fermi's book is patterned after
the arrangement of his course pre
sented at Columbia University's
1936 summer session. He uses the
same material that he offers in his
own CQurses at the University of
Rome.
