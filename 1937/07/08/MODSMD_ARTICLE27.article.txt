# Old Language Changes Cited On Radio Hour
## Contact of Race Groups Given as Reason Many Speech Changes Occur 
### 
"English Five Thousand Years
Ago" was the subject of a talk given
by Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Stroth
mann, assistant professor of Ger
man, over the Stanford Radio Hour
last Monday night.
Dr. Strothmann stated that prac
tically all modern languages, and
some that are now extinct, like Hit
tite, are nothing but dialectic vari
ations of a very old language which
has been given the name of Indo-
European.
He said that this early language
was spoken by a tribe of people
around the year 3000 B.C. From this
tribe groups migrated into different
sections, subjugated the original in
habitants, and made them learn
Indo-European. In turn the con
querors- accepted some of the lin
guistic habits of the former inhabi
tants and thereby speeded the
process of linguistic development so
that by 1,000 B.C. the national
groups that sprang from the Indo-
European people could not under
stand each other without the help
of an interpreter.
Dr. Strothmann pointed out other
ways in which languages change.
He said that each generation not
cnly invents new terms and phrases
but also changes the sounds slightly.
Just as a Harvard man tends to pre
serve his Harvard accent in order to
be known as a Harvard man, so the
various social groups imitate the ac
cent of the socially leading group.
Furthermore, there is a tendency to
make difficult words easier, which
gradually brings about a change in
both grammar and sounds. He said
that such changes do not amount to
much during one generation. But
over a period of centuries they may,
and do, change a language so com
pletely that Chaucerians would
hardly be able to understand a word
of modern English.
