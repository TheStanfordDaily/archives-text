An afternoon in a beautiful home
of early California architecture
filled with objects of artistic inter
est and surrounded by gardens of
varied design was the pleasure Tues
day of the art appreciation class.
The home was that of Mrs. Louis
Stearns in Palo Alto. The occasion
was one of William Irvin's class's
regular "lab" periods.
The home, a spacious white stucco
with tiled roof, contains some of
Whistlex*'s etchings, as well as many
by Francis Hayden, who was Whis
tler's son-in-law. Two delicately
colored China vases of the Ming dy
nasty and an intricately designed
antique Persian rug were among the
objects examined by the class. Be
sides the large garden opening out
from the patio at the back of the
house, there are smaller gardens
around»the sides. One of these is an
Italian garden with an arbor of

Italian Cypresses bordered with
lavendar.
Mrs. Stearns has a "Stanford
! room" in the process of making.
The rugs and drapes of this room
. are of deep red. The book cases are
| gradually being filled with books
about Stanford. Mrs. Jordan and
President Wilbur have already con
i tributed to this group, which in
! eludes many back issues of the
Stanford Quad. On the walls are
' many photographs given to Mrs.
I Stearns by students who have vis
ited her home in the past.
