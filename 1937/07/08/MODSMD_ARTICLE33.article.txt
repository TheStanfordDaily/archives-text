# LAGUNITA WINGS NAMED
## 
### 
Acording to a vote taken last
quarter by Lagunita Court residents,
the two new wings of Lagunita
Court, now under construction, will
be named Casa del Olivo, meaning
"house of the olive trees," and Casa
Granada, "house of the pomegranate
trees."

Arabian camels are bred from
carefully selected stock, and many
of them boast pedigrees longer than
those of Arabian horses.
