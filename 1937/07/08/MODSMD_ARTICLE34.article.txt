### 
Expressing his satisfaction with
the progress of psychological meth
ods of teaching in the Northwest, Dr.
Reginald Bell of the Department of
Education returned to the campus
recently after a five-day tour of
Idaho and Washington where he at
tended conferences at the Univer
sity of Idaho and Washington State

At the Moscow institution Dr. Bell
addressed a group of educators and
school superintendents from Idaho
and western Washington on psycho
logical foundations of curriculum
development, and on the adminis
trative problems of schools from the
point of view of educational psy
chology. Leaving the Idaho campu~
after a two days' stay, Bell pro
ceeded to Ellensburg, Washington,
where he lectured to the students of
the Normal College on the same
topics.
."Progressive educational methods
making: great strides in both
oh the institutions I visited," said
Dr. Bell in an interview yesterday.
"I was particularly gratified with the
response of the students at Washing
ton State Normal. Judging from the
interest and intelligence shown by
them in open - forum discussions
after my lectures, I feel safe in say
ing that the ne\v generation of
teachers in this district will be
deeply interested in educational psy
chology. The experimental approach
was both vigorous and sound."
To President McConnell, head of
the college, Dr. Bell ascribes much
of the credit for the progress of
Washington State Normal. Dr. Mc-
Connell is now in Palo Alto for the
Educational Conference.
