Crusading as always on the side of
right and virtue. Senator Ebenezer
Q- Sassafras, '08, announced a cam
pa i|£n to preserve many Stanford
relics that are in danger of passing
into oblivion.
"As a loyal Stanford alumnus, my
heart bleeds at the thought that the
many artistic and literary works re
corded on the seats and desks of
Stanford classrooms may soon waste
away and be lost to posterity, if
steps are not taken for their imme
diate preservation," the senator told
a Daily reporter, when cornered in
his palatial suite at Agnew. "My
constituents, both of them, are be
hind me heart and soul in my
struggle to preserve these master
pieces for posterity."
Among the better known works of
art on the campus is "The Morning
After." Sketched by an unknown
master, it depicts a creature, half
fish and half parrot, wearing a bland
smile and a clerical hat. It is lo
cated unobtrusively on a seat out
side of Room 260 A in the Engineer
ing Building.
In Room 23 of the Political Sci
ence Department the Surrealist
School is represented by a cryptic
drawing depicting a man hanging
from a gallows, along-side of an
other person who is enjoying a fight
lunch under a tree. The victim, who
is labeled "Dave," appears to be en
joying himself thoroughly.
It is to be regretted that Stan
ford's literary endeavors have not
heen as uniformly successful. Preju
dice frequently rears its ugly head,
as in the obviously exaggerated se
ries of statements in Room 23, cast

ing doubts on the legitimacy of al
the members of El Campo. A com
mittee is investigating the authen
ticity of several other remarks. At
least one, written by a member of
Phi Delta Theta, in which he main
tains that he would rather be a
dirty dog than a Beta Theta Pi, is
almost certain of being expunged
from the records, as it has been con
clusively established that the dogs
at the Beta house are merely the
property of the members.
It has been suggested that the
extra dollar of the student body
fees, heretofore devoted to the New
Theater, be given to establish a fund
to preserve works of this type, and
to be used as prizes to stimulate
further creative endeavor.

dirty dog than a Beta Theta Pi, is
almost certain of being expunged
from the records, as it has been con
clusively established that the dogs

Crusading as always on the side of
right and virtue. Senator Ebenezer
Q- Sassafras, '08, announced a cam
pa i|£n to preserve many Stanford
relics that are in danger of passing
into oblivion.
"As a loyal Stanford alumnus, my
heart bleeds at the thought that the
many artistic and literary works re
corded on the seats and desks of
Stanford classrooms may soon waste
away and be lost to posterity, if
steps are not taken for their imme
diate preservation," the senator told
a Daily reporter, when cornered in
his palatial suite at Agnew. "My
constituents, both of them, are be
hind me heart and soul in my
struggle to preserve these master
pieces for posterity."
Among the better known works of
art on the campus is "The Morning
After." Sketched by an unknown
master, it depicts a creature, half
fish and half parrot, wearing a bland
smile and a clerical hat. It is lo
cated unobtrusively on a seat out
side of Room 260 A in the Engineer
ing Building.
In Room 23 of the Political Sci
ence Department the Surrealist
School is represented by a cryptic
drawing depicting a man hanging
from a gallows, along-side of an
other person who is enjoying a fight
lunch under a tree. The victim, who
is labeled "Dave," appears to be en
joying himself thoroughly.
It is to be regretted that Stan
ford's literary endeavors have not
heen as uniformly successful. Preju
dice frequently rears its ugly head,
as in the obviously exaggerated se
ries of statements in Room 23, cast

ing doubts on the legitimacy of al
the members of El Campo. A com
mittee is investigating the authen
ticity of several other remarks. At
least one, written by a member of
Phi Delta Theta, in which he main
tains that he would rather be a
dirty dog than a Beta Theta Pi, is
almost certain of being expunged
from the records, as it has been con
clusively established that the dogs
at the Beta house are merely the
property of the members.
