# Wilbur Catches Great Big Fish
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, edu
cator, physician, and President
of Stanford University, assured
himself of permanent immor
tality by landing a record
breaking Rainbow Trout while
on vacation in Canada.
According to the Chronicle,
the trout in question, landed at
Stuart Lake, 8.C., was a 20-
pound, 32 1 /2-inch specimen,
with a girth of 22 inches. The
girth of the reporter who wrote
the story was not given.
With characteristic brevity
our San Francisco competitor
failed to mention how the
"landing" was acomplished. A
consensus of local fishermen re
veals that trout of this size are
usually lassoed, harpooned, or
caught on marlinspikes, using
wildcats as bait.
There is no truth in the re
port that the fish will' be
mounted and placed in the
Cashier's office in time to su
perintend the payment oi syl
labus fees.
