# Stanford Cast Catches Mood of Anderson Play
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Reading Maxwell Anderson's
"High Tor" Friday night, a Sword
and Sandals cast caught all — or
i.early all—the quicksilver comedy
of the one flash of fantasy in the
' '.6 theatrical pan. Whatever re-
Marks follow are aimed only to
qualify a sum-total appraisal, defi
j itely on the credit side.
Fred Clark and Rosemary Benet,
ifter a brief stray in other pastures,
returned to the Stanford drama fold
Lise and Van Dorn, the two prin
cipals of the Anderson fantasy.
Fred Clark's performance can best
be described as competent. "Com
petent," of course, is a moldy crust
which hits been tossed to supporting
oasts in the last paragraphs of re
\ lews since the beginning of time.
Clark Scores
But deftly and (irmly Clark made
each of his lines behave in a way
to suggest only one description—
"competent." He could, perhaps,
V-ive been a little more spiritual as

the young Dutch idealist who wants !
to keep his mountain, "High Tor," j
from being gutted by trap-rockers, j
But to ask Clark to be ethereal is j
a little like expecting Gypsy Rose |
Lee to do Ibsen. He, in common j
with Gypsy Rose, recognizes hi.slim- ■
itations.
There were those who thought
Miss Benet's plaintive wraith was a '
little monotonous—dead even for a j
ghost. It is said, however, that she j
was influenced by Broadway's Peggy !
Ashcroft who, acting on Maxwell
Andersons direction, gave the role j
of the phantom wife of a phantom i
17th-century sea captain just that j
interpretation. Thus, Rosemary Be
net's Lise was by Rosemary Benet |
via Ashcroft via Anderson, who'
should know.
Bud Cady as De Witt, bos'n of the
ghost crew, was a salty phantom '
salt. Joe La wry and J. P. Cahn as j
two trap-rockers were the prime j
comics of the show.
