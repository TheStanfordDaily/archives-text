As educators of all sorts and con
ditions gather within our gates this
week, that problem child of modern
times, mass education, again becomes
the subject of a family conference.
The convention may or may not
contribute to the methods by which
teachers can make two ideas stick
in a head where nature made room
for only one. But whether it brings
progress or not, the conference
brings a note of encouragement that
is very welcome in these dark days
of weeping, wailing, and teeth gnash
ing.
Our educators may agree only on
the theory that we are approaching
chaos and damnation with a velocity
equal to the square of human stu
pidity. But if they think enough of
their work to sit through a confer
ence in Stanford's summer weather,
it may not be necessary to man the
lifeboats quite yet. Such heroism is
both an inspiring example of forti
tude and an indication that improve
ment in education is not some im
possible ideal, like a pipe course in
economics, or a fan dancer without
a fan.

Despite the dissenting opinions of
a few "old-timers" and the protest
ing bleats of some civic organiza
tions, education has made tremen
dous progress in recent times. To
day's high school student may use
words not in the King James version
to describe his Latin course, but he
does not have to recite from memory
hundred line doses of Cicero.
But modern methods of education
are still some distance from any
soul-stirring state of perfection. In
the high schools, pressure from re
tired grocers or dry goods merchants
on the board forces teachers to im
part a rosy aura to the world. Stu
dents are given the impression that
"all is for the best in this best of all
possible worlds." Everything from
the cunning little amoeba up (or
down) to the Republican and/or
Democratic party is clothed with a
radiance of approval. It is hardly
surprising that the high school
graduate gets a rather tragic shock
from his contacts with the world.

In the colleges, the Olympians
who guide our destinies are too

often hypnotized by the idea that
universities are created for research
alone. They forget that their pri
mary purpose is to teach. Blithely
they accept tuition fees, pass them
on to Professor Foganfuss who in
vestigates the glorious mystery of
the south end of a Paramecium and
lectures under his breath to a be
wildered class. The great problem
that faces colleges today is to learn
how to teach.

Both universities and high schools j
are hampered by the attention they j
are forced to pay to the misfits. !
Classes are held back, material is i
neglected, all because a small per- j
centage cannot absorb as much as j
their fellows. Sentimentalists say
that environment is the cause of
backwardness. To these gentlemen
we may point out that Heaven has
been considered uniformly good as
an environment, but that Satan i
just didn't get along there.
But imperfect though our educa
tion system is, it is constantly im- |
proving. And the conferences of j
teachers show that they are taking
the lead in its progress.
