# Mental, Physical Health Stressed by Speakers In First Day Sessions

### 
"An Integrative Conception of
Mental and Physical Health" by Dr.
Douglas A. Thom and ''Environ
mental Factors Affecting Mental and
Physical Health" by Dr. Jesse F.
j Steiner, speeches given in the Me
morial Hall, started the first day of
the education conference yesterday.
"The major emphasis in child
guidance," said Dr. Thom last night,
j "is the environmental factor and its
effect on the child. From the indi
vidual standpoint heredity can
neither be ignored nor yielded to.
Each should make the most of his
environment."
Physical Handicaps
Dr. Thom pointed out that al
though many children are physical
ly handicapped from the start, they
should be made to use the advan
tages they have, notwithstanding.
"Many serious problems are cre
ated around and about and because
of physical handicaps. Some malad
justments are occasioned by phys
ical as well as mental handicaps."
In the future, he predicts, psy
chologists will believe emotions to
be more flexible and fluid than pres
ent theories indicate.
Behavior Patterns
A{*opos of that he said, "In the
future perhaps patterns of emo
tional behavior need not be accept
ed as fixed. Heredity and environ
ment neither coincide nor compete
with each other."
Dr. Steiner in yesterday after
noon's speech said, "Our approach to
health problems is environmental
rather than biological." He pointed
out that there was a lag in the en
vironmental approach which should
if possible be prevented.
Although the environmental and
physical approach to health are in
separable and therefore it is impos
sible to lay too much stress on the
environmental side, he sees an ex
tension of the medical viewpoint to
public school problems.
Wives of conference registrants
will be admitted to other conference
speeches but if both the wife and
husband are engaged in educational
work, it is expected that they will
purchase separate registrations.
The public address system in the
Memorial Hall was not operating at

full efficiency and it was impossible
for many to hear portions of Steiner't'
j speech, which was carried on, as
all programs of the conference in
the Memorial Hall, in panel discus-'
sion.
Those on the panel for the Thom
talk were Walther H. Brawn, Nor
man Fenton, Ernest R. Hilgard and
Helen B. Pryor. Those for the;
Steiner speech were Ethel Percy
Andrus, H. E. Chamberlain, I,
James Quillen, Douglas A. Thom,
and Dean Mary Yost.

"An Integrative Conception of
Mental and Physical Health" by Dr.
Douglas A. Thom and ''Environ
mental Factors Affecting Mental and
Physical Health" by Dr. Jesse F.
j Steiner, speeches given in the Me
morial Hall, started the first day of
the education conference yesterday.
"The major emphasis in child
guidance," said Dr. Thom last night,
j "is the environmental factor and its
effect on the child. From the indi
vidual standpoint heredity can
neither be ignored nor yielded to.
Each should make the most of his
environment."
Physical Handicaps
Dr. Thom pointed out that al
though many children are physical
ly handicapped from the start, they
should be made to use the advan
tages they have, notwithstanding.
"Many serious problems are cre
ated around and about and because
of physical handicaps. Some malad
justments are occasioned by phys
ical as well as mental handicaps."
In the future, he predicts, psy
chologists will believe emotions to
be more flexible and fluid than pres
ent theories indicate.
Behavior Patterns
A{*opos of that he said, "In the
future perhaps patterns of emo
tional behavior need not be accept
ed as fixed. Heredity and environ
ment neither coincide nor compete
with each other."
Dr. Steiner in yesterday after
noon's speech said, "Our approach to
health problems is environmental
rather than biological." He pointed
out that there was a lag in the en
vironmental approach which should
if possible be prevented.
Although the environmental and
physical approach to health are in
separable and therefore it is impos
sible to lay too much stress on the
environmental side, he sees an ex
tension of the medical viewpoint to
public school problems.
Wives of conference registrants
will be admitted to other conference
speeches but if both the wife and
husband are engaged in educational
work, it is expected that they will
purchase separate registrations.
The public address system in the
Memorial Hall was not operating at

full efficiency and it was impossible
for many to hear portions of Steiner't'
j speech, which was carried on, as
all programs of the conference in
the Memorial Hall, in panel discus-'
sion.
