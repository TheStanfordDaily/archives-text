# Drama Season Includes Numerous Productions
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Proved a royal flush in last Fri
day's presentation, "High Tor" will
be given two repeat performances
Friday and Saturday nights, at 8
o'clock.
The second and third "High Tor"
readings will launch the new experi
mental Little Theater of Memorial
Hall. Jane Clary will sit in for
Rosemary Benet as Lise, the fem-

inine lead of the Maxwell Anderson
fantasy. (Miss Benet, it appears, is
otherwise engaged, or engaged oth
erwise, according to'reports that she
will soon wed Dick Dawson, prom
inent in Stanford dramatics and
brother to Jack.)
For the rest, Fred Clark. Bud
Cady, George Wood. J. P. Cahn, and
Joe Lawry will play their original
lead cards. In the supporting cast

f are Don Bl own, John Cline, Doro
j thy Brookroan, Sylvia Onesti, and
Bob Ireland.
With three male role gaps, Direc
tor Arthur Gleditzsch has temporar
j ily dropped production on "The
i Green Cockatoo," a one-act play,
originally scheduled for evening
performance with "The Exchange"
for Friday night.
Whether one one-act was worth
an evening performance and two
bits of the public's money was
doubted. But when Director Gor
don C. Lange saw a classroom pre
sentation of "The Exchange" Tues
day he decided it was, remarked,
"Well, frankly this is much better
than I had expected." Now, "Ex
change," hoped to be an ace-in-the
hole, will come off a week from Fri
day, making way for "High Tor"
tomorrow.
Moves to Theater
It seems construction still flour
ishes apace in the new Little The
ater, and it was decided that, where
a more tender show might get dis
couraged, "High Tor," which had
survived Quad Room 100, would go
bravely forward amidst falling
beams, pounding hammers, and stray
carpenters innocq,ntly prying up the '
planks of the stage and ferreting in
nooks and crannies of the cast in 1
search of misplaced screw drivers.
Gurstenberg's "Overtones," one of
the forthcoming Tuesday one-acts,
shows what two women say and
then what they are really thinking
â€”all very subtle and psychological.
It was written in the last part of the
nineteenth century, and the idea is
from Eugene O'Neill via Eddie
Cantor. Directed by Miss Agnes
Hoffman, the cast comprises Jane
Clary, Melba Rae Toombs. Ruth
Martin and Sylvia Onesti.


Hud Cadv
With casting set for tonight at 7:30,
Quad Room 100. Robert Brauns and
Myna Hughs will direct the forth
coming Sword and Sandals reading,
to be given Friday, July 16. Mo
liere's "Dr. Willy Nilly" and Cer
vantes' "Cave of Salamanca" top the
bill. Both are highly risque, and it
is therefore hoped that a large crowd
will attend. But win, lose, or draw,
the comedies will be risked on the
house in the name of art.
Dark Horses
Biggest stakes of the year are on
"Twelfth Night," climax show of the
summer drama festival. Several
main entries including Arthur Gled
itzsch, James Bacigalupi and Joseph
Whitaker are dark horses never seen
and little heard of in Stanford dra
matics thus far. According to Mrs.
Helen Green, costume director, all
the gems for the production will be
chiseled out of gum drops. For ex
ample, rubies will be cherry gum
drops. Wintergreen or liine gum
drops will be emeralds, and so on.
So bring along the jelly beans, and
let's play Cartier.
