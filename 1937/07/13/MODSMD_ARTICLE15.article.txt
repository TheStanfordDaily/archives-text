# Talk on Health Ends Meeting Of Educators
## Kefauver Puts Emphasis On Need for Broader View of 'Good Health' 
### 
Stanford University's Fifth Annual
Education Conference came to an
end Sunday afternoon with the
closing remarks of Dean Grayson N.
Kefauver, who placed before the as
sembled educators the aims and pur
poses that the conference had at
tempted to develop.
"Our conception of health should
not be limited to the presence or
the absence of disease or illness,"
emphasized Kefauver. "Throughout
this conference a much broader and
a much more adequate connotation
has been given to the term. The
more positive conception compre
hends the effective functioning of
the total organism."
Efficiency Varies
Individuals who are not suffering
from actual illness, says Kefauver,
vary greatly in their efficiency. The
individual with good health is one
with an abundance of physical en
ergy and strength, with efficient
functioning of the different body
organs, with emotional stability and
the absence of emotional conflicts,
with feelings of satisfaction and hap
piness rather than that of depres
sion, and with ability to bring all of
his resources to bear upon the prob
lems or the activities with which he
is dealing.
"The school environment set-up,
to facilitate the development of
youth, should be favorable for the
type of life which builds mental and
physical health," Kefauver con
cluded.
Bell Speaks
Dr. Reginald Bell of the Stanford
School of Education implied that the
present system of grading should be
replaced by a system of individual
grading where the pupil would work
for an individual goal rather than
something to fit the masses.
Dr. Clyde M. Hill of Yale Univer
sity denounced college entrance re
quirements as antiquated, and such
subjects as foreign language, his
tory and mathematics he declared
were not the necessary items for a
college entrance examination.
