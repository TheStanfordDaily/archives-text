# ALUSTIZA ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Frank Alustiza, former Stanford
football great, was a visitor on the
campus yesterday. He recently re
turned from a trip to Wyoming.
Alustiza was married to Miss
Yvonne Beattie, a Stanford co-ed,
early in June.
The University of Kansas tennis
team enjoyed an undefeated sea
son, winning a dozen dual meets
and sweeping through the Big Six
meet without a defeat.
