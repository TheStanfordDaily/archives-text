# Buffooneries Shown Here In Old Films
## 
### 
Brief buffooneries and chases ex
hibited in some of the features of
"The American Comedy," second
program in the early film series
shown last night in the Quad Little
Theater, were some of the first con
tributing factors to impress upon
producers and directors the vast
possibilities of their medium.
"The Doctor's Secret," though
filmed in the archaic days of 1900,
showed imagination and invention
on the part of its producer, George
Melies, in creating a revelry in pres
tidigitation. All sorts of devices,
available only in cinema, were con
ceived to make a non-existent world
of fantasy come true.
Years before even photography
was invented children flipped over
little booklets and saw animated pic
tures, but Winsor McCay, of "Little
Nemo" fame, is credited with the
first experiments in projecting an
thropomorphic creatures on a screen,
and his "Gertie the Dinosaur" was
shown as a result of those experi
ments.
Golden Era of Westerns
By 1916 the "Golden Age" of
Western had arrived, but to Mack
Sennett it was merely material for
one of his celebrated satires.
"His Bitter Pill" brought down the
house last night.
Harold Lloyd in the "Freshman"
recalled memories of the standard,
country-boy-struggles-in-city theme
used during the '20's.
"The Sex Life of the Polyp" 's
lack of all the old motion picture
comedy tradition proved surprising
to many. One of the first talking
pictures, it was considerably slowed
down by a novelty.
First Silly Symphony
"The Skeleton Dance," first of the
now celebrated and beloved Silly
Symphonies, completed the program,
demonstrating how sound could be
used as an integral part of a film,
re-enforcing the pictorial image,
rather than just an accompaniment.
