# Helen Green Describes Brief Dramatic Career
## 
### BEN OLDS 
Dark-haired, vital little Helen Green, Stanford's new costuming in
structor, sat in her tiny office in the English corner and enthusiastically de
scribed her rise, in a little over a year, from student to instructor. That is,
she sat in her office for a few sentences, but, from then on, the interview
was jerkily conducted as the Daily reporter followed in her hurrying foot-

►steps from the old costuming room
| to the new one in Memorial Hall.
Tells Story of Career
The story of her career is briefly
this: Shortly after her marriage, Mrs.
Green, indulging a latent propensity
j for creative art work, entered the
Chouinard School of Fine Arts in
Los Angeles. She enrolled for every
course she could get—magazine il
lustration, still-life, design, life
drawing, costum — historical and
modern, and practical costuming.
Under Jules Gagne, the noted teach
er, she received the thorough incul
cation of the fundamentals to which
she attributes much of her success.
Always active, she went from
Chouinard's to the Speech School at
University of Southern California.
This was in 1934, and her studies in
art were still a hobby and more or
less aimless. It was in connection
with a speech course that her pre
cipitous entrance into the field of
professional costume design came
about. During an interview with the
secretary of the Shakespeare Guild,
a traveling repertory company, Mrs.
Green saw a room full of historical
costumes, declared her ability and
eagerness to designe costumes of a
similar nature.
Complete Shakespeare Wardrobe
The Guild had purchased, at auc
tion, an incomplete wardrobe which
had belonged to Robert Mantell, the
great Shakespearean actor, and Mrs.
Green offered to complete the ward
robe for them without remuneration.
Her offer was accepted and she was
soon touring through California,
Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico
with the company. Mrs. Green be
lieves that the experience gained
with this organization, one of the
few roadshows left in the United
States, was extremely valuable to
her, for she had to carry on her work
under innumerable difficulties.
When William Thornton, principal
actor of the Guild, came to Stanford
as an instructor in the summer of
1935, he brought Mrs. Green with
him as acting instructor in costum
ing. She returned to this position in
the summer of 1936.
During the fall of 1935 Mrs. Green
went to the San Francisco Opera
Company and became a member of
the backstage staff there. She stud
ied traditional opera costuming and
designed the costumes for Rosina in
"The Barber of Seville" and for the
princess in "Sister Angelica."
