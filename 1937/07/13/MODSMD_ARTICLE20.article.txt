# Cancer Cures Cited by Emge In Radio Talk
## Clinical Professor Says Disease on Increase; Mechem to Talk Next 
### 
Dr. Ludwig A. Emge, clinical pro
fessor in the Department of Obstet
rics and Gynecology, stated in his
talk on the Stanford Radio Hour last
night that cancer is on the increase
and that in spite of progress in
diagnosis and treatment, more people
die from cancer today than 50 years
ago.
There are many theories which
account for this increase, according
to Dr. Emge. Some specialists say
that our life span has increased, and
more of us reach the cancer age,
which falls between 40 and 60, while
others believe that, because of bet
ter training and greater experience,
physicians recognize cancer more
often than formerly, a fact which
may account for the apparent in
crease.
Early Cure Possible
Dr. Emge said that, with few ex
ceptions, early cancer can be cured
and, as far as is known, it remains
cured, but when it has gone be
yond its local confines cure becomes
doubtful, and instead of saving life
there can only be prolongation of it
and the alleviation of suffering.
"We know where cancer may ap
pear," Dr. Emge said, "but since we
do not know when it may appear we
must be constantly on the watch for
it. If we can prevent its occurrence
by correcting abnormal conditions,
or if we at least can attack it in its
early forms, we can obtain a high
percentage of permanent cures.
Prevention Is Weapon
"However, fear of cancer often
keeps the victim from seeking in
formation, and hence cancer is seen
most frequently when it has reached
doubtful limits of curability. To
day our most efficient weapon against
cancer is prevention."
Next week's radio talk will fea
ture Dr. Philip Mechem, acting
professor of law at Stanford, who
will discuss the "Social Implications
of Our Wills Law" over KGO Mon
day at 8:30 o'clock.
