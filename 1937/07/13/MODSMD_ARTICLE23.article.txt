# Summer Tennis Matches Begin
## First Round To Be Over By This Week-end 
### 
The annual summer tennis tour
nament will begin this week on the
men's courts, and the first round
should be finished by the end of the
week. All students and faculty mem
bers interested in tennis and here
for the summer are eligible to par
ticipate.
Several of the players have been
given 15-point handicaps. Rambo,
Sparks, Cassel, Jenne and Ward are
those whom Elwyn Bugge, tennis
coach, has considered good enough
to handicap.
Bugge said yesterday that the first
round must be finished this week.
Those men at the top of the brackets
are obliged to notify the others al
though everyone is expected to find
his partner. The losers are respon
sible for the cost of the balls and
the sets are the best two out of
three.
The tournament should be over in
three weeks, and if enough interest
is shown, there might be a doubles
tournament later in the quarter.
The prize for this tournament will
be a perpetual plaque on which the
winner's name will be engraved.
Two of the faculty members who
are entered in this meet are Harry
Shipkey and John Bunn.
De Kol Plus Legis Dixie, a Hol
stein-Friesian cow, produced 33,464
pounds of milk and 1349.3 pounds of
butterfat in one year.
