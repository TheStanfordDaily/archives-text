Outcast, currently playing at
the Fox-Stanford Theater:
The jury frees Dr. Jones (Warren
William) on a murder count. But the
husband of the murdered woman
scotches his career. Dr. Jones pawns
his surgical instruments and lands
in a North Wisconsin junction. The
sister of the murdered woman (Kar
en Morley), traces him, determines
to break him. But she falls in love
with him, thickening the plot not a
little.
On the face of it, this is tread
out of the usual Hollywood grape,
improperly aged, and labeled Class
B. Actually, it is a distinguished
film—largely by virtue of some ex
pert still shots, and the presence of
Dame May Whitty in the cast.
Dame Whitty was recruited from
the British stage. In the recent and
very adult film, "Night Must Fall,"
she played a hypochondriac. In
"Outcast," she plays a bigot. In
both, she is a hysterical mental case.
In these two roles alone, she has
proved herself unmatched in the
field of "hysterionics." Dame Whitty
will assuredly be heard about.
"Mountain Music," starring Bob
Burns and Martha Raye, is sup
posed to be the better half of the
double bill. All about Arkansas
mountaineers, "Mountain Music" is
good, low-down slapstick. With
Martha, Bob, and the ingenue, the
only hill-billies in the picture with
clean faces, "Mountain Music" is
chiefly enlightening because the
mountaineers actually look like the
drawings in Esquire.
"The Petrified Forest," a very
arty and significant picture, plays
a return engagement at the Varsity
tomorrow.
Lucky crowds will jam to Benny
Goodman at Santa Cruz Wednesday
night for the swing-master's one
night stand there.
