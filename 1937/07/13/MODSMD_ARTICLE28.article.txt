For some time the Olympians who
guide this great culture factory have
been working up an alarming blood
pressure over the question of what's
to be done with our newest tan ele
phant, Memorial Hall. From the
welter of account books, floating
loans, and sinking funds, one fact
stands out like a girl at a jolly-up.
Like the melodrama heroine, the
theater must pay and pay and ditto
if it is to be more than a costly play
pen for the school of drama.
Most of the suggestions for put
ting our worship of art on a paying
basis have been as full of holes as
a manhole cover; but one or two
show the steadying influence of the
business instinct. A striking ex
ample of the Shylock school of
thought urges that the University
charge the students rent for using
the theater. Moralists object that
since the students have contributed
$3 a year since the dawn of history,
they have as much of an equity in
the product as anyone else. Con
census of opinion is that it would
not pay to push the syllabus-fee
technique too far.
* * *
More equitable is the suggestion
that we use the wall of the theater
to advertise. Practical minded ex
ecutives consider this the ideal solu
tion. Just back of the impressive
verandah, foyer, marquee (multiple
choice, select one) is a broad ex
panse of brindle plaster running
roughly east and west, ignoring the
point which has run in all directions.
Advertising companies would fight
for display space on this bill-board,
and the resulting income would
make the endowment fund look like
cigarette money.
And consider how a good lingerie
ad would brighten up the lives of
Encina's frosh, how it would put
new spirit into weary sightseers.
And a well-drawn beer poster would
give us strength to sit through even
a sociology lecture.
But such is only a beautiful
dream. Our dignity must be pre
served, and a university must not
boom corsets, though it would profit
esthetically, financially, and perhaps
morally thereby. It is feared that if
we set a precedent with the theater,
sooner of later a roadhouse will
have the chapel front. And so we
must put our faith in the inside of
the theater, the outside being a froz
en asset. On Stanford dramatics falls
the burden of keeping our artistic
nose above water.
♦ * *
Obviously we cannot invest in any
black ink if we stick to the old
system, preparing two months for
a play that runs two nights. Truly
art is long, and time and box office
attraction is fleeting.

We might divert some of the
Farm's potential buying power to
the theater if we boomed dramatics
with the same fervor as football.
One-tenth the enthusiasm that fills
the stadium would route a stream of
gold through our Temple of Thes
pis. But theaters are not adapted to
cheering sections, and a long end
run is more up-to-date than Shake
speare. It appears that if dramatics
are to bring in more shekels they
must find new markets.
* * *
And in Berkeley there is a mar
ket that would thrill a promoter's
soul. Why couldn't we trade drama
with the University of California?
Instead of a two-night run here, we
could double the time by playing
there as well. In turn, Cal could
show her major productions here.
We could get twice as many first
class plays, and put dramatics on a
really paying basis.
There is no need to labor through
a description of the advantages of
this arrangement. They are obvious.
Any scheme to swell the exchequer
and at the same time advance the
principles of the University speaks
for itself. After all, two similar "in
stitutions of learning" can hardly de
grade each other by a bit of co
operation.
If Stanford dramatics are to sup
port the theater, they must go out
into the world like all other heroes,
and make enough to pay off the
mortgage. And there's gold in them
thar Berkeley hillbillies.

For some time the Olympians who
guide this great culture factory have
been working up an alarming blood
pressure over the question of what's
to be done with our newest tan ele
phant, Memorial Hall. From the
welter of account books, floating
loans, and sinking funds, one fact
stands out like a girl at a jolly-up.
Like the melodrama heroine, the
theater must pay and pay and ditto
if it is to be more than a costly play
pen for the school of drama.
Most of the suggestions for put
ting our worship of art on a paying
basis have been as full of holes as
a manhole cover; but one or two
show the steadying influence of the
business instinct. A striking ex
ample of the Shylock school of
thought urges that the University
charge the students rent for using
the theater. Moralists object that
since the students have contributed
$3 a year since the dawn of history,
they have as much of an equity in
the product as anyone else. Con
census of opinion is that it would
not pay to push the syllabus-fee
technique too far.
* * *
More equitable is the suggestion
that we use the wall of the theater
to advertise. Practical minded ex
ecutives consider this the ideal solu
tion. Just back of the impressive
verandah, foyer, marquee (multiple
choice, select one) is a broad ex
panse of brindle plaster running
roughly east and west, ignoring the
point which has run in all directions.
Advertising companies would fight
for display space on this bill-board,
and the resulting income would
make the endowment fund look like
cigarette money.
And consider how a good lingerie
ad would brighten up the lives of
Encina's frosh, how it would put
new spirit into weary sightseers.
And a well-drawn beer poster would
give us strength to sit through even
a sociology lecture.
But such is only a beautiful
dream. Our dignity must be pre
served, and a university must not
boom corsets, though it would profit
esthetically, financially, and perhaps
morally thereby. It is feared that if
we set a precedent with the theater,
sooner of later a roadhouse will
have the chapel front. And so we
must put our faith in the inside of
the theater, the outside being a froz
en asset. On Stanford dramatics falls
the burden of keeping our artistic
nose above water.
♦ * *
Obviously we cannot invest in any
black ink if we stick to the old
system, preparing two months for
a play that runs two nights. Truly
art is long, and time and box office
attraction is fleeting.

We might divert some of the
Farm's potential buying power to
the theater if we boomed dramatics
with the same fervor as football.
One-tenth the enthusiasm that fills
the stadium would route a stream of
gold through our Temple of Thes
pis. But theaters are not adapted to
cheering sections, and a long end
run is more up-to-date than Shake
speare. It appears that if dramatics
are to bring in more shekels they
must find new markets.
* * *
And in Berkeley there is a mar
ket that would thrill a promoter's
soul. Why couldn't we trade drama
with the University of California?
Instead of a two-night run here, we
could double the time by playing
there as well. In turn, Cal could
show her major productions here.
We could get twice as many first
class plays, and put dramatics on a
really paying basis.
