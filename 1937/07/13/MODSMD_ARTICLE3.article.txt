# "Make All Checks Payable"
## 
### 
Summer quarter syllabus
fees, bills for which were sent
out last week, are due and pay
able today from 8 a.m. to 12
noon, 1 pm. to 5 p.m. Pay
ments should be made to the
cashier at the accounting de
partment in the Administration
Building.
For failure to pay today an
additional fee of $2 will be
made (except in cases where
fees are less than $2, in which
case the fine will be equal to
the fees), and unless the fee is
settled by July 20, registration
will be subject to cancellation.
If there are any questions
regarding the syllabus charges,
they should be submitted to the
Registrar's Office for adjust
ment before paying.
