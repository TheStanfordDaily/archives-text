# Tudor Songs Will Be Topic Of Talk Today
## 
### 
Claude R. Petty of the faculty of
Fresno Junior College will speak on
"The Singing English" this afternoon
at 4:30 in the Women's Clubhouse.
Sponsored by the Summer Drama
Festival Committee, the talk will
deal with forms of Tudor songs and
will be illustrated by phonograph
recordings of this type of music.
Petty, a Stanford graduate, is par
ticularly well qualified to deal with
musical topics as he was an orches
tra leader for several years before
entering the teaching field. He has
made two trips around the world
with his band, studying character
istic native forms of harmony in
many countries.
According to Petty, Elizabethan
music was written in the same fash
ion employed by some of the mod
ern popular composers, notably Ir
ving Berlin. Instead of writing words
to fit a definite, completed, harmonic
pattern, Tudor composers wrote mu
sic to fit individual short phrases.
This, in Petty's opinion, tends to
bring out the lyric beauty of the
English language to a far greater
extent than the more common prac
tice of completing a musical selec
tion before writing the words.
Records to be played tonight in
clude selections on the lute, virginal,
and oboe, songs by the internation
ally famous English Singers and a
composition, "Music for a Chest of
Viols," which is regarded as the
forerunner of modern string sym
phonic arrangements.
