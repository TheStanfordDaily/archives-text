This diagram less crossword puzzle is, without mincing words, tough!
Not only are the words unusual, but the design may lead you com
pletely astray. The problem is to fill in the crossword puzzle from
the definitions alone, with no knowledge about the design except that
the over-all size as given here is correct. Whenever you fill in a
word, put a black square after it. In this one, you may have to erase
No. 1 several times before you get it in the right place!

This diagram less crossword puzzle is, without mincing words, tough!
Not only are the words unusual, but the design may lead you com
pletely astray. The problem is to fill in the crossword puzzle from
the definitions alone, with no knowledge about the design except that
the over-all size as given here is correct. Whenever you fill in a
