# Former Daily Head To Talk For S.F. Fair
## New Collegiate Exhibits Will Be Big Feature During '39 Exposition 
### 
Stanley Beaubaire, former editor
of the Stanford Daily, now assistant
director of exhibits and concessions
for the Golden Gate Exposition, will
announce plans for an "International
Collegiate Village" on Treasure Is
land program over KGO and the
NBC Red network Sunday evening
at 7:15 o'clock.
The collegiate village, which will
be a feature of the exposition,
scheduled for San Francisco in 1939,
is the first project of its kind. It
was first conceived in 1933 by three
Stanford students, Beaubaire, Beech
er Kellogg and Bill Waltman, after
they had driven east for the Century
of Progress and found no reflection
of college life in the entire fair.
'Village' Planned
After endless discussion and delib
eration, the plans for the "Collegiate
Village," first exhibit in any of the
major expositions to represent insti
tutions of higher education, were
formulated.
Every university on the Pacific
Coast will be represented with one
of its outstanding features. Stan
ford's Memorial Chapel will be du
licated, while California's Campanile
is to be erected. Other bits of campi
from schools all over the world will
be built, with Flirtation Walk at
West Point and Heidelberg's Rath
skeller random examples.
With these picturesque highlights,
the romantic side of college life will
be unfolded to the exposition visitor
as he wanders through the lanes of
the "Collegiate Village."
