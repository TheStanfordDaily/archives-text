# Dr. Steiner Will Talk On Recreation
## 
### 
Dealing with current trends in
American recreation, Dr. J. F. Stein
er, acting professor of economics at
Stanford, will speak on "Americans
at Play" tomorrow night at 8 o'clock
in the Little Theater, Memorial Hall.
One-time member of the Hoover
-Social Trends Commission in charge?
of the section on leisure time, Dr.
Steiner recently published his find
ings on the subject. His latest re
search on this topic, done under aus
pices of the National Commission on
Social Aspects of the Depression, is
near completion and will be pub
lished the coming fall.
In his talk, Dr. Steiner will point
out influence of the depression on
types of recreation, according to his
reecnt survey, revealing that forms
of "mass recreation" have increased
in popular favor, with the propor
tionate decrease of expensive leisure
mediums. Both the movies and ra
dio, according to the figures com
piled, have climbed as amusement
devices in the American scene since
the advent of the depression.
That the FERA has allotted funds
for recreation facilities in addition
to regular relief sums, indicates, ac
cording to Dr. Steiner, the import
ance attached to recreation in con
nection with social welfare.
In his talk tomorrow, the author
ity will attempt to draw conclusions
concerning the future of recreation
and its aspects and place under fed
eral or local control and subsidy.
