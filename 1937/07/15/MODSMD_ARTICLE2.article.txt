Student delegates from far-off
Japan will meet delegates from
American universities at Stanford
the first part of August, it was an
nounced here yesterday by George
Campbell and Hortense Spoehr, co
chairmen of the Stanford delegation.
First begun in 1933, this Student
Conference meets once each sum
mer. Delegates are chosen by uni
versities in both countries and rep
resent the best minds of youthful
Japan and youthful America.
Promotes Harmony
Purpose of these get-togethers is
the promotion of harmony and good
relationships between the two
countries. Delegates who take part
in these conferences today will be,
it is hoped, the men and women of
responsibility in the respective gov
ernments tomorrow, the sponsors
point out.
The fifty Japanese delegates will
arrive in San Francisco July 28 and
will be entertained in the bay region
for several days. On the first of
August they will move to Stanford,
staying at Lagunita.
Round table discussions will be
held for the remainder of the week
in both morning and afternoon ses
sions. During these confabs, Ameri
can and Japanese students may put
their heads together in earnest, dis
cussing contemporary problems.
To Go South
Following the actual conference
here, the Japanese delegates will
journey south to be entertained by
representatives of U.S.C. and U. C.
L. A. Then they will travel to Port
land and will sail from Seattle
toward the end of August.
Fifty Japanese and 75 American
delegates will attend the round-table
discussions here. A definite number
has been allotted to the several uni
versities of both countries. Stanford
delegates are to be announced next
week.
