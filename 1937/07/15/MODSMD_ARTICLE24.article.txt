# S.F. Printer 'At Home' To Farm Art Students

### 
Studying the relation of art to
printing and make-up, members of
William Irvine's Art Appreciation
lab visited the San Francisco work
shop of John Henry Nash, noted
printer, Monday, where they "viewed
some of Nash's own work and also a
large number of rare old books in
his own private collection.
Nash, who recently completed a
book on the life of Phoebe Hearst
for her son, William Randolph
Hearst, told the class that he had
been forced to travel six times to
Europe to get the paper for the vol
ume. The paper was bought in a
small town near Amsterdam where
pure water from a nearby stream is
used to make the unusually fine
paper.
Hand-set Type
Type for the book was hand-set
by Nash himself. There is a finely
made etching of Mrs. Hearst opposite
the title page, and the whole volume
is bound in fine calf-skin vellum.
This one book cost $48,000 to make,
and Nash made only two of them.
In Nash's private collection is a
valuable old manuscript known as
an Antiphonal, a chant of the serv
ices used during the day in the old
monasteries of Europe. It is claimed
to be of Fourteenth Century origin.
The book is bound in heavy vellum
stretched over a board and held to
gether with metal clasps.
Elaborate Painting
The pages are handprinted on
sheepskin, and each capital is elab
orately painted. Monks made use of
various animal and fish figures in
working out their capital letters.

Of interest to many was a page of
the Gutenberg Bible printed in Ger
many. It is considered the earliest
of the printed works, and today the
heavy black-faced type is still used
in printed German.
Another book of value was the
first printing of Euclid's mathemat
ical works edited in 1432.
The coloring used in these early
books was very bright and through
the many years they have managed
to keep their brilliancy. The blue
used in many of the works was made
by grinding lapis lazuli into a pow
der and using it as ink pigment.
Giraffes can deliver terrific blows
by using their heads as hammers.
