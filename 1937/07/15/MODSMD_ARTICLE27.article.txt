# Theatre, Radio Fare Outlined By Reviewer
## 
### 
"The Singing Marine," currently
playing at the Fox-Stanford The
ater:
Dick Powell is a leather-neck from
San Diego. His buddies buy him a
ticket to New York. Radio mogul
Major Bowes makes him a big star.
His head swells like feet in the sum
mer and he forgets the girl back
home (Doris Weston). However, he
rises to heroic heights of self-denial
before the final fade-out. It is prob
able you have seen this picture or
something remotely like it, before.
"King of Gamblers" is an ex
pose of a big city slot machine rack
et. While the scenarist does not
quite hit the jack-pot, "The Thir
teenth Chair" makes for exciting
second-feature fare.
"Slave Ship" comes Sunday to the
Fox-Stanford. Warner Baxter and
Wallace Beery co-star. It pictures
the adventures of history's last slav
er, as it sails on its last desperate ad
venture. Baxter plays the scourge
of two oceans, defying the navies of
the world. Beery is the villain of
the piece, as a bull-headed treachery
dealing mate. "Slave Ship" bids fair
to rank as good beefsteak drama—
tough and red-blooded.
"Married before Breakfast," fea
turing Robert Young and Florence
Rice, to be screened with the Baxter-
Beery opus, is all about an inventor
and his robot.
