To those of us who have watched
the messing of the heels-within
wheels that makes up campus poli
tics, it is a considerable relief to see
the smoothness with which summer
session is handled. Student govern
ment, of course, is a beautiful and
inspiring thing, and in this demo
cratic age, it is as necessary as a
good football team. But after the
guerrilla warfare between student
committees that marks the regular
year, the quiet facility of our sum
mer regime looks like a heavenly
peace that passeth all understand
ing.
It is customary today to regard
university administrations either as
holding companies for senile demen
tia or as subcommittees of the Su
preme Court of Heaven. Neither
view, of course, is correct, but those
who bray so loudly about the supe
riority of student management will
not enjoy conti'asting the summer
system with our regular melee.

Campus government, this summer,
is certainly in the hands of the fac
ulty. And yet, we bow under no
iron heel, nor are wives and children
murdered before our eyes. Ex com
mittee no longer turns the Quad
into a facsimile of Aeolus' cave, but
no Cossacks ride into the crowd on
the law steps. Only Men's Council,
sitting like a Daniel come to judg
ment on "a certain student," stands
between us and complete faculty
management, but we still sleep safe
in our beds.
It is interesting to note that de
spite the dire predictions of amateur
soap-boxers, faculty government has
not resulted in a back-to-the-bustle
movement. On the contrary, Stan
ford is more liberal summer quarter
thari at any time during its ten
months of glorious freedom and
equality.

Professors can comment on the
fact that the stork theory of repro
duction has been discredited, with
out fearing the outraged modesty of
Women's Conference (or the coun
cil or whatever they call it). A care
less reference to the quality of the
orange juice at some roadhouse no
longer draws a look of studied (but
poorly simulated) disapproval from
the professors. Inhibited lectures ac
tually dare to pan the Republican
party without attributing the opin
ion to half the scholars since Abe
lard.
Reason for this sudden burst of
liberality is not entirely faculty su
pervision, but also the altered nature
of the student body. Summer quar
ter, graduates or advanced students
are a majority, and it can be as
sumed that they don't have to be
sheltered.

And besides the pleasant surprise
of hearing a professor state a per
sonal opinion, there is also some
thing encouraging about seeing a lec
ture arranged without having to
fight it through half a dozen com
mittees and a closed date system.
Student government is no doubt the
fairest and most equitable system.

But the Gordian knot cutting of the
summer is decidedly satisfactory
after the throat-cutting of the regu
lar year.
