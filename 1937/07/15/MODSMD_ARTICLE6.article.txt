# Tudor Exhibit Shows at Libe
## Display Includes Metal Work, Miniatures 
### 
Leading up to the final production
of "Twelfth Night" during the week
of the drama festival, the Tudor ex
hibits in the Library have been plan
ned to give as much information of
the period as is possible before the
actual performance.
Dr. Margery Bailey has planned
this first exhibit, which will be on
display until the end of the month,
with an eye to representative ar
ticles of the Tudor period.
In one of the cases there are dis
played some portraits in etching and
miniatui'e of the English artist,
Holbein, who painted Henry VIII.
In another case there is an exhibit
of metal work of the time. Small
portraits show the minute detail of
the armor by metal workers and
jewelers.
George Z. Wilson, director of dra
matics at the Hayward High School,
has donated a copy of Camden's
Britannia, a history of the natural
resources of England in Tudor times,
published in the 15th century.
Following this exhibit there will
be two more placed in the same
cases; the next will be shown some
time around the first of August.
