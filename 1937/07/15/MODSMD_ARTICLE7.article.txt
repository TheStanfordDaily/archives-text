### 
Notice of the final decision in the
Maxwell Anderson play contest
probably will be released this week,
according to Dr. Margery Bailey,
Stanford judge.
Three plays, "Souvenirs de la
Malmaison," by Dorothy Dow of
Chicago; "Dawn of Darkness," by
William Lidell Stephenson; and
"Song of the Bridge," by Thomas
Conger Kennedy of New York, were
sent for final decision to Burgess
Meredith and the other professional
readers in New York. These plays
were chosen by four campus judges
from a field of 180 entries. This is
the second of the annual contests.
