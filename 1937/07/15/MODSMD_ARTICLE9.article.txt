# Hartmann Promises New Features in Chaparral
## 
### BEN OLDS 
The Stanford Chaparral, Volume
39, received an unofficial champagne
bottle over its glossy cover today as
next season's editor, Robert Hart
mann, issued a prospectus of the
coming year's installment of the 40-
year-old humor periodical.
"New typography, layouts, and
emphasis," Editor Hartmann antici
pated, "will be combined with Chap
pie's (as he affectionately calls it)
40-year-old tradition of leadership
among the nation's funny magazines,
to produce what we hope will be the
best Chappie ever."
Cites Function
Citing the Chaparral's three-fold
function â€” to entertain, to view the
contemporary scene, to serve as a
proving ground for embryonic liter
ary and artistic talent, Editor Hart
mann promised greater effort in the
first two divisions and more abund
ant opportunity in the third.
The Fables of the Farm will
be continued and expanded, Marco
Thorne having unearthed a veritable
treasure-chest of old farm lore
which will be supplemented by cur
rent fact and fable of the campus
beau monde. Little Pop-Off, the
modern Candide of Pueblo-Much-
High-Learning, goes into his fifth
year as amusing and popular as
ever.
Staff Seasoned
Among the seasoned wits whose
return Editor Hartmann announces
with pleasure and trepidation are
Sister McGonigle, Our Hasher Jor
gensen, Tom Fleming, Harrison Ste
phens, Art Levinson, Bud Arnold,
and Pres Ellington. Artists who will
illuminate Volume 39's "pictured
page" include Bob Gillespie, Ken
Overturf, Page Gilman, and Jack
Boyd. Patty Bosqui, she of scissors
and tin fame, will continue to create
in her bizarre medium under the
auspices of the Continental Can
Company.
Ted Cornell, new circulation chief,
will handle the annual drive for
subscriptions, and business manager
Foster Markolf will hold the Chap
paral's financial destinies in his able
and itching palm.
The rumor that the "West's oldest
college comic" may be ensconced in
new and luxurious quarters com
bined with the information that eli
gibility for election to Hammer and
Coffin, national honorary humor so
ciety, is extended to successful wits,
bon vivants, mad-men, and hard
working office-boys, should lure
flowers now blushing unseen into a
place in the sun.
