ON THE OTHER HAND,
if you're an ordinary mortal (and, aren't we
all), you're probably thinking it's about time
to buy a new Fall suit. So, please consider
this an invitation to drop in and look at our
rather excellent (in our opinion) selection of
NEW FALL SUITS. The patterns are more
colorful than usual: smart stripes and plaids,
and we can show you both single and double
breasted models at
$30 and $ 35
Store Hours: 9:30 A.M.-5:30 P.M.
