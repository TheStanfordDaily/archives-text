# Local Students Conclave Hosts
## Fifty Japanese Students Arrive for Meeting 
### 
Stanford students who will act as
delegates to the Fourth Annual
American-Japan Student Confer
ence July 28 to August 28 were an
nounced here yesterday.
They are George Campbell and
Hortense Spoehr, members of the
executive committee, and Gretchen
Allswede, Audrey Brumfield, Philip
Woodyatt, Jack Laney, Buddy Iwata,
Perry Chisum, Oliver York, Phil
Clock, George Henderson and Rob
ert Hartmann.
Organized in 1934 as a student
project to further a mutual and en
lightened understanding of the prob
lems of the Pacific, the Conference
this year will be attended by 50
students from 27 Japanese colleges
and universities, and 75 American
delegates from some 15 schools.
Starting July 28 with the arrival
in San Francisco of the Japanese
group on the Asama Maru, the con
ference will engage in its academic
activities at Stanford during the
week starting August 1 with a se
ries of round-table discussions on
political, religious, ethical, and in
ternational questions.
It is outside the classroom, how
ever, that the most important pur
pose of the project will be realized,
through the informal association
among the delegates during the four
weks of living, eating and traveling
together on their trip, on which
they will visit Southern California,
the Sierras, Seattle and Portland.
