# New Degree System to Be Adopted
## Special Section Planned For Brilliant Students 
### 
Preparing the way for a new era
in Stanford education, the Academ
ic Council granted approval to two
new plans for admission to Upper
Division standing which will make
special provision for students of ex
ceptional ability, it was announced
yesterday by Dr. J. P. Mitchell,
Registrar of the University.
The creation of a "University Di
vision" was authorized by the Coun
cil, in order to take care of brilliant
students who are planning graduate
work and wish to organize their up
per division and graduate work into
a single unit.
Favors Good Students
Admission to this division will be
granted to all students who have
completed their freshman year with
a B average, or to all transfers with
two years of advanced standing and
the equivalent of B grades. Such
students will not have to meet the
Lower Division requirements and
they will not be candidates for the
A.B. degree, but may formulate in
dividual plans of study under the
guidance of their department heads,
that will lead directly to advanced
or professional degrees.
Provision has also been made
which will permit applicants for ad
mission to the Upper Division who
present scholastic records equiva
lent to a B average on the Stanford
scale, to enroll without being held to
Stanford Lower Division require
ments if they have completed the
requirements of the first two years
of undergraduate work established
by the institutions from which they
transfer.
Pioneers Way
Despite the fact that several insti
tutions in the East have pioneered
in the field of waiving rigid en
trance and Lower Division require
ments, Stanford is the first univer
stiy to offer the M.A. degree on
this basis. Although there will be
no reduction in the time require
ment for the degree, faculty mem
bers feel that the importance of the
plan cannot be underestimated, as
by eliminating many unrelated
courses, it is expected that a greater
degree of concentration can be
placed on the major field. Opportu
nities for independent study under
this system are unlimited, although
University Division students will
not necessarily do only independent
work.
It is hoped that these plans will
not only serve as a stimulus to more
modern methods of education in
American universities, but will at
tract many outstanding students to
Stanford who might otherwise have
matriculated elsewhere. However,
it is not planned, as has been ru
mored, to do away with the Lower
Division entirely.
