# Play Slated For Reading Here Friday
## 
### ALVIN ZELVER 
Sir George Etherage's "The Man
of Mode; or, Sir Fopling Flutter,"
a delightful little presentation full
of fluttering fops (in character) has
been cast for reading this Friday
evening at 8 o'clock in the Quad
Little Theater (Room 100).
In its treatment of the restoration
period, "The Man of Mode; or,
. . ."is definitely not risque by
suggestiveness. Rather it is broad
and candid. If somebody is a naugh
ty name, no inhibitions are felt in
calling him (or her, as the case gen
erally is) a naughty name.
"Most Sophisticated"
Myna Hughes, assistant in super
vision of the Summer Drama Fes
tival, commented on the play's ex
treme sophistication saying, "It is
probably one of the most sophisti
cated works ever attempted in the
Quad Little Theater."
"The Man of Mode" is quite un
sentimental and satirical with the
pseudo-sophistication of its time and
so, therefore, is full of gentlemen and
gentlewomen like Sir Fopling (Sid
ney Head), who, fresh from Paris,
manages to send London town into
social dithers with his too, too deli
cately beautiful Barroy suit, Le Gras
graniture, Piccat shoes, Chedreux
periwig; and Mr. Dorimant (Joe
Whitaker) who sighfully mutters to
himself bits of verse.
