# Tudor Farce Readings Riotous Comedy Success
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
In degree and kind, last Friday's
four Tudor farce readings packed
the same comic wallop as would a
U. S. Senator's slip on a banana
skin. All were riotous slapstick. In
all, a great part of the fun was at
the expense of some pompous wind
bag.
To generalize further, with the
exception of Lope de Rueda's "The
Olives," the formula, "man dupes
woman," or vice versa, fits the
whole group including Moliere's "Dr.
Willy Nilly"; Hans Sachs' "The
Scholar Bound for Paradise"; and
Cervantes' "The Cave of Sala
manca." To wit, in Moliere comedy,
a faggot-maker's wife tricks her
husband into a spot where he has
to act as a doctor. "The Cave of
Salamanca" tells of a traveling
man's wife who cheats on him. In
"The Scholar Bound for Paradise,"
a canny scholar rooks a trusting
wife by fleecing her of coin to take
to a dear-departed husband in the
happy hunting grounds.
In one of the best performances of
the evening, Robert Brauns as Dr.
Willy Nilly boiled his own fine ket
tle of comedy fish in Moliere's scald
ing satire on medicos. As Papa
Geronte, and again as the paradise
bound scholar, Sydney Head, as
usual, suggests the royal-crest Brit
ish lion, slyly turning around to
wink at a pretty girl — droll, off
guard, but still distinguished. In
what was perhaps the most authen
tic and colorful performance of the
show, Dr. Margery Bailey tied a
pillow case under her chin, folded
her hands demurely in her lap, and
seemed, undoubtedly what Hans
Sachs had in mind as the wife of
his one-act. Tom Seller, dynamic
Little Caesar of last summer's "An
thony and Cleo," distilled a high
proof kick into his several roles Fri
day. Lucie Bentley and Myna
Hughes were both excellent in as
sorted wife, female-companion parts.
