# World Record Again Broken In 800 Meters
## Woodruff Lowers Half-Mile Record to 1:47.8; Malott Cops Quarter 
### 
Performances by Stanford's con
tingent of trackmen at the Pan-
American Games held in Dallas,
Texas, July 15-18, were obliter
ated by the sterling exhibition turn
"ed in by Pittsburgh's Long John
Woodruff who astounded the track
world with a new world's record
performance over 800 meters. Wood
ruff broke Ben Eastman's record of
1:49.8 by two full seconds.
Ray Malott was the only Stanford
representative to score a first place.
He easily took his specialty, the 400
meters, in the very good time of
47.3. This time, as was Woodruff's,
was the more commendable consid
ering the type of track the boys
were running onâ€”a fifth of a mile
layout.
Weiershauser Bows
Jack Weiershauser lost a close de
cision to Perrin Walker of Georgia
over the 200-meter route. Walker's
time of 22.2 definitely shows the
slow condition of the track.
Ray Dean in the 65-meter dash,
Jim Reynolds in the 16-pound shot,
and Phil Levy in the discus all
scored second places.
Sail for Europe
Malott and Levy, immediately
following the meet left for New
York, where they board a boat for
Europe tomorrow. They will travel
throughout Europe performing
against European stars.
Reynolds and Weiershauser arriv
ed in Los Angeles yesterday. Rey
nolds will remain in Southern Cali
fornia while Weiershauser will
come north to his home near Stock
ton. Weiershauser and Reynolds
sail for Japan on August 5.
