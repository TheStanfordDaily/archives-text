# Film City Gets Varsity Coach
## 'Dink' Templeton To Aid Scenario Writers 
### 
Robert L. "Dink" Templeton,
Stanford's varsity track and field
coach, has finally gone Hollywood.
For several years various motion
picture producers have been angling
for Dink's services in their scenario
departments. Saturday Templeton
confirmed the report that he had ac
cepted a position with Metro-Gold
wyn-Mayer studios.
This studio will begin production
on several collegiate films very soon
and Templeton will aid in working
up the script and certain technical
matters related to the production of
the pictures.
His connection with the motion
picture industry will not interfere
with his work as Stanford's track
coach. Tentative arrangements with
the studio calls for his work to be
completed by September 15 so that
he can return to the farm and begin
to mold his 1938 track and field team.
Templeton left to assume his new
duties Sunday night. San Francisco
papers carried a story Saturday
morning that Templeton was seri
ously injured in an automobile ac
cident near Atherton. A minor acci
dent, entirely over-emphasized by
San Francisco reporters, was the
origin of the story.
