# 'Slave Ship' Is Good Sea Melodrama
## 
### 
"Slave Ship," starring Warner
Baxter and Wallace Beery, cur
rently at the Fox-Stanford The
ater:
When the Clipper "Wanderer"
slides from Salem drydock, a man
is crushed under her hull. Like the
Ancient Mariner's Albatross, the
jinx curses her thereafter. The
"Wanderer" is auctioned to Warner
Baxter, skipper, who charts her
course for North Africa, brings back
a cargo of slaves.
Finally, the "Wanderer," launched
in blood, razed by fire and mutiny,
sinks off the coast of St. Helena Isle.
Critics have beefed because Holly
wood wasted an epic with "Slave
Ship." What they did film was a
melodrama, which has every sea saga
since "Mutiny on the Bounty" beat
en by long odds. In any case, cin
ema-goers who can down a good
stiff finger of melodrama will like
"Slave Ship's" shots of gleaming
blacks huddled in a hold . . . the
rumble of mutiny like summer thun
der, striking like heat lightning . . .
men hurdled from the ward-arms by
pistol fire . . . splattered on the
decks . . . reeling into the water.
With audience and critic I.Q. what
it is today, San Francisco papers
notwithstanding, most of the house
was glad "Slave Ship" escaped he
roics.
"Married before Breakfast." A
nice young inventor (Robert Young)
cleans up on a shaving preparation,
sets himself up as henchman to Lady
Luck, picks up Florence Rice on the
way, scatters $50 bills, dodges gang
sters, winds up on a cell cot to re
flect about life.
