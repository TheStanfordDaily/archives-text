About the middle of last spring
some of the more militant of our
embattled Farmers decided that
Stanford should contribute its two
cents, plus sales tax, toward a new
muzzle for the dogs of war. There
followed a great shouting and tu
mult, where blind committees clash
ed by night; and somewhere in the
midst we had a peace day assembly.
It was doubtless very interesting for
a student of insanity, but most of us
left the assembly with a slightly
sick feeling, wondering how we
would look in uniform. Some of the
speeches were inspiring; some were
funny. But from them two things
were obvious: nobody knew what
peace was; and nobody knew how to
maintain it.
Since that time it has become in
creasingly apparent that our shot in
the dark was not heard round the
world. The Spanish still consider a
bouquet of shrapnel preferable to
olive leaves; in the Far Eastern
league the Japanese and the Peiping
tongs are starting another double
header.

As our imitation silver tongued
orators said last spring, it is up to
the "rising generation" to lead the
way to peace. And since it is the
duty of the universities to lead the
rising generation, it seems only fair
that they should do their bit toward
dismounting the Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse.
Our colleges are very proud of
the bravery and initiative with
which they face modern problems.
Faculty chests swell at the mention
of "practical" courses and "practical"
achievements. But how many uni
versities offer a course in practical
peace? It is customary today to ro
gard peace as a glorious intangible,

the heavenly mysteries of which will
be revealed to youth through some
sort of divine miracle. It will be
remembered that much the same at
titude Was held with regard to
babies in the last century. And
those were the days of the astound
ing birth-rate.

If we don't care for the idea of
shoving bayonets into chaps we
never saw before, we must make a
scientific study of war and peace, just
as we have studied the causes and
cures of physical diseases. And we
must teach peace as a science, just
as we teach hygiene. If universities
want to lead thought and research,
they will have to open courses in
peace.
Students unquestionably want to
avoid war, but they have no idea of
how to go about it. To most of us
the word peace brings a picture only
of a rather chic angel in a white
kimono. Such visions are very at
tractive but have little influence on
international diplomacy. If the uni
versities are to live up to the prin
ciples they so gayly advertise, they
must replace that picture of a sim
pering angel with a definite pattern
of cause and effect we can under
stand and apply.
