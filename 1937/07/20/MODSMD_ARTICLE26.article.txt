# Millikan Will Speak To Education Club
## 
### 
Robert A. Millikan, scientist and
lecturer, will speak on some aspect
of scientific education, the definite
subject left to his discretion, at the
regular meeting of the education
club at noon Thursday in the Union
dining hall.
There are only 35 tickets available
to the public and they are on sale
at the education department office.
At last week's meeting Professor
Lee Chapin spoke on the subject,
"Three Years and Three Days in
China."
"Communism is not attractive to
people who have only poverty to
divide," said Professor Chapin, "and
South China, under the leadership
of General Chiang Kai Shek, was
much more concerned with the uni
fication of the country, improving
means of transportation, communi
cation and other constructive proj
ects, than the division of property."
In 1927 a Communist coup d'etat
was carried out in Canton, and Pro
fessor Chapin explained his experi
ences as a refugee in the city during
the first three days.
