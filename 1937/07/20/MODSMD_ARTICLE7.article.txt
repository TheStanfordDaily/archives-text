# Dance Group To Perform Here Tonight
## 
### 
Launching Stanford's new Me
morial Hall on its career of art and
drama, the Summer Drama Festival
will give the theater's first presen
tation tonight at 8 o'clock with a
program of 16th century court and
modern dances by the Allied Dance
Group of San Francisco.
First on the program will be a se
ries of 16th century dances by Ar
beau, which have been worked out
carefully after extensive research
into old books on the subject, with
the help of a member of the group
who has studied them in England.
Modern Dances
Following this will be a group of
modern dances based on old forms.
Miss Mary Tiffany, who spent two
years at Stanford, and is at present
the only dance major at Mills Col
lege, will dance in "Pavane and
Gaillarde," which she herself cre
ated.
"June," a duet by Anne Whit
tington and Rosalie Wagner, is ex
pected to be a success as it is a
satire on bridesmaids.
Maxine Cushing's modern Cha
conne is third of the program, and
the closing number is a Courant for
five girls and a man, which is a re
versal of the authentic Courante, in
which five men pursue one girl.
Independent Movement
The San Francisco Dance Group,
which is presenting the program, is
a manifestation of the independent
art movement that is developing in
the West. The group, which made
its debut a little over a year ago,
is an elastic, co-operative associa
tion of about 15 young but experi
enced men and women. It was
formed for the purpose of casting
off the shackles of Eastern influence,
and to create a distinctive regional
dance, using Western talent and
ideas.
When interviewed at a dress re
hearsal, Miss Maxine Cushing, one
of the leading members of the
troupe, was extremely enthusiastic
about the future of the modern
dance movement. Miss Cushing, who
is a Stanford graduate, and an ex
perienced publicist and manager as
well as a dancer, believes that the
future of dancing lies with the col
leges because they are increasingly
teaching it. They are not only de
veloping many promising young
dancers, but are creating an ap
preciative audience which has
learned through experience to watch
action "kinesthetically."
