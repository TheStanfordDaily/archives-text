# Theater Problems Given in Lecture
## 
### 
"A show is any presentation from
a circus to a grand opera. Enter
tainment should entertain even
though it is designed to make mon
ey." These were the opinions of
Miss Margaret Storey, who ad
dressed the newly formed class in
theater management in Room 200 of
the English Building last Friday
afternoon.
Miss Storey discussed the differ
ences between the stage crew and
the front office of the theater, the
publicity problems and the types of
actors to be sought. Her speech
was of gerat value to the department
because of her tremendous experi
ence, said Dr. Bailey. She has been
affiliated with the Jessie Bonstelle
stock company of Detroit, she has
worked in the Cornell Theater do
ing everything from acting to di
recting, and she is interested in the
theater from a professional angle.
