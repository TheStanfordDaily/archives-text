# Picture Series To Offer Four Early Movies
## Typical Films of 1908-1918 Selected for Showing 'Intolerance' to Come 
### 
This week's Quad Little Theater
program in the Early American
Film Series will consist of four
films, "The Clever Dummy," "The
New York Hat," "The Fugitive,"
and 'A Fool There Was," to be shown
Monday evening at 7:30. These pic
tures have been chosen to show the
development of characteristic Amer
icanisms in early films made between
1908 and 1918.
Slapstick Comedy
"The Clever Dummy" was the
first of many slapstick comedies to
be made by Ben Turpin, Chester
Conklin, and Wallace Beery. It was
followed by similar comedies, reach
ing the height of their popularity
with the films showing Fatty Ar
buckle, Mack Swain, Charlie Chap
lin, and Mack Sennett. Sennett di
rected the comedy to be shown this
week.
Mary Pickford is to appear before
the Film Series audiences in "The
New York Hat," her first picture and
the first film which attempted to
depict real life. Miss Pickford is
supported by Lionel Barrymore,
whose rise from the obscurity occa
sioned by the splendor surrounding
his younger brother's fame at that
time has been steady and contin
uous.
Western Thrillers
The era of western thrillers was
initiated in 1916 when Thomas Ince
presented William S. Hart in "The
Fugitive." It was in this western
that Director Ince began adorning
the borders of the illuminated sub
titles with symbols. A snarling
wolf designated the villain, a cac
tus indicated desert scenes to fol
low, and rose buds informed 1916
audiences the heroine would make
her appearance.
Adding a new "type" to film ac
tors, and a new word to the English
language, was accomplished by
Theda Bara, whose first picture, "A
Fool There Was," introduced her as
an Arab seeress of evil aspect and
set the pace for thirty-nine others to
follow, in which the actress was in
variably to be seen as a "wicked
vamp."
Music for this week's program
will be arranged by Alden Beach
and Theodore Huff.
Season ticket holders will have
two later opportunities to use their
tickets since two programs are
scheduled for the near future. The
feature of the next Film Series pre
sentation will be D. W. Griffith's
"Intolerance."
