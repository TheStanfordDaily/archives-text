Reconstruction and renovation on
the seven fraternity and sorority
houses now undergoing rebuilding
has advanced so rapidly, University
officials report, that it is believed
they will be sufficiently completed
by the opening of fall quarter to en
able members to move in.
More than $25,000 will be spent by
the Betas in the building of their
new house which was designed by
J. C. Branner, prominent campus
architect. The Betas were the first
to get started on the reconstruction
program when they gave a series of
informal house wrecking parties
which left few details to the pro
fessional crew.
The Alpha Delts are installing a
new fireplace, adding more rooms,
building on a new sleeping porch,
and putting on a fresh coat of white
paint.
The Alpha Phi Sorority house, as
reported by House Manager Barbara
Baer, will be topped by a new green
roof, new colonial style windows of
the same color, and an entirely dif
ferent front porch.
The Deke house, following closely
in the footsteps of the Betas, will be
almost completely rebuilt.
The Alpha Tau Omegas, living up

to their threat of last year to raise
from $2 to $200,000 for a third floor
to take care of their pledges, are
also adding new showers and install
ing a new furnace.
A complete third floor of study
rooms is being added to the Sigma
Nu house, along with twelve built
in dressers and new closets.
The Daily reports with glee that
there are no cases of bubonic plague
or locusts on the Farm this week.
