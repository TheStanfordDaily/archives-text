# Gridiron Fans Foresee Strong Team Next Fall
## 
### HILMER LODGE 
Stanford's return to football su
premacy on the Pacific Coast may
be realized this fall if Tiny Thorn
hill's Big Red Machine functions as
he expects.
Ten men, all of first-string rating
last year with the exception of Full
back Bill Paulman, spark plug of
Stanford's 1936 Rose Bowl victory
over S.M.U. who was out with a leg
injury, will be battling to hold their
positions when Thornhill opens
practice on September 14
Returning First-stringers
The returning first-stringers in
clude Jack Clark and Grant Stone,
ends; Pete Zagar, tackle; Bob Math
ews and Leo Ferko, guards; Louis
Tsoutsouvas, center; Jake Brigham,
fullback; and Jimmy Coffis and Joe
Yigna, halfbacks. Also to be added
to this list is Tony Calvelli, who was
shifted from center to fullback on
last year's squad when Paulman was
injured. Tony was about the only
man on the squad capable of a com
bination of passing, ball carrying,
and blocking, essential to a fullback
on Thornhill's system. With the re
turn of Paulman this season Tony
has been shifted back to center,
where he will give Tsoutsouvas a
run for his money. During the final
spring practice game, Calvelli dis
played the consistency which Tiny
demands of his centers.
Reserves Plentiful
Reserves, men capable of giving
any of these so-called first-stringers
a battle for their positions, are
plentiful. With such good reserve
material Thomhill may have a tough
time whittling out what he wants to
call his first string.
The one line position definitely
open is the right tackle spot held
down last year by big Claude Cal
laway. The white edition of "Cab"
graduated last spring and Stan An
dersen, a 215-pound juggernaut up
from Harry Shipkey's last year's
frosh squad looks like the man to
hold down this berth. He possesses
the speed and power for the position
but will have to have a few games
under his belt before he will com
pare with Pete Zagar, who plays the
other tackle post.
AU-Amcriean Caliber
Eastern sport critics who saw
Zagar in action against Columbia
last year in New York definitely
labeled him as being "of All-Amer
ican caliber." Zagar's main forte
last season was not only consistency
but the ability to rush the opposition
offense, often charging in and bring
ing down ball carriers for losses be
fore they could hardly get going.
Other reserves who are figured to
count heavily in making things
tough for the returning lettermen
include By West, tackle; Frank Mc-
Millan, guard; Chet Patton, full
back; Ed Gamier, halfback; Doc
Luckett, who played a considerable
amount of time last year, quarter
back; A1 Alustiza, quarterback; and j
Rod Parker, fullback.

Zagar in action against Columbia
last year in New York definitely
labeled him as being "of All-Amer
ican caliber." Zagar's main forte
last season was not only consistency
but the ability to rush the opposition
offense, often charging in and bring
ing down ball carriers for losses be
fore they could hardly get going.
Other reserves who are figured to
count heavily in making things
tough for the returning lettermen
include By West, tackle; Frank Mc-
Millan, guard; Chet Patton, full
back; Ed Gamier, halfback; Doc
Luckett, who played a considerable
amount of time last year, quarter
back; A1 Alustiza, quarterback; and j
Rod Parker, fullback.
Stanford's return to football su
premacy on the Pacific Coast may
be realized this fall if Tiny Thorn
hill's Big Red Machine functions as
he expects.
Ten men, all of first-string rating
last year with the exception of Full
back Bill Paulman, spark plug of
Stanford's 1936 Rose Bowl victory
over S.M.U. who was out with a leg
injury, will be battling to hold their
positions when Thornhill opens
practice on September 14
Returning First-stringers
The returning first-stringers in
clude Jack Clark and Grant Stone,
ends; Pete Zagar, tackle; Bob Math
ews and Leo Ferko, guards; Louis
Tsoutsouvas, center; Jake Brigham,
fullback; and Jimmy Coffis and Joe
Yigna, halfbacks. Also to be added
to this list is Tony Calvelli, who was
shifted from center to fullback on
last year's squad when Paulman was
injured. Tony was about the only
man on the squad capable of a com
bination of passing, ball carrying,
and blocking, essential to a fullback
on Thornhill's system. With the re
turn of Paulman this season Tony
has been shifted back to center,
where he will give Tsoutsouvas a
run for his money. During the final
spring practice game, Calvelli dis
played the consistency which Tiny
demands of his centers.
Reserves Plentiful
Reserves, men capable of giving
any of these so-called first-stringers
a battle for their positions, are
plentiful. With such good reserve
material Thomhill may have a tough
time whittling out what he wants to
call his first string.
The one line position definitely
open is the right tackle spot held
down last year by big Claude Cal
laway. The white edition of "Cab"
graduated last spring and Stan An
dersen, a 215-pound juggernaut up
from Harry Shipkey's last year's
frosh squad looks like the man to
hold down this berth. He possesses
the speed and power for the position
but will have to have a few games
under his belt before he will com
pare with Pete Zagar, who plays the
other tackle post.
