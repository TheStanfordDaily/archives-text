# Coester to Talk On Radio Monday
## 
### 
Dr. Alfred Coester, professor of
Spanish-American literature, will
discuss the new role being played
by the landscape in South American
literature over radio station KGO
Monday, July 26, at 8:30 p.m.
Dr. Coester's talk, entitled, "Some
South American Novels," will be il
lustrated with references to three
writers whose work particularly ex
emplifies the changed part which
landscape is assuming in Latin
American writing.
"In the literature written by
South Americans, the country itself,
the great rivers, the forests and the
mountains have always been im
portant," Dr. Coester said yesterday
in commenting on his forthcoming
talk. "Recently in South American
novels the landscape has appeared
in a new role. It has become a char
acter in the story, or, if not pre
cisely a character, at least an evil
influence which neither human be
ings nor animals can escape."
