# Fresno Lecturer Talks on Campion
## 
### 
Speaking before a gathering in
the Women's Clubhouse Tuesday
afternoon on the subject, "Master
Thomas Campion, Musician Poet,"
Claude R. Petty, instructor at Fresno
Junior College, told the group that
the essentially musical quality of
Elizabethan verse was the result of
the custom of the time which caused
poets to write words and music at
the same time. Thomas Campion,
Petty said, was one of the best of
these poet-musicians.
Mrs. Samuel Swaize Seward, con
cert singer, sang several of Cam
pion's songs for the audience. Mrs.
Seward's interest has led her to
make extensive study of Renaissance
music, especially madrigal singing.
Her work has consisted principally
of interpretation of Elizabethan po
ets from a musician's point of view.
The lecture given by Petty was the
third Music Hour program held in
the clubhouse.
