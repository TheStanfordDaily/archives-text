# Glenda Farrell Featured At Fox-Stanford
## 
### 
''Fly Away Baby," playing Thurs
day at the Fox-Stanford Theater:
a take-off on attractive girl-reporter
Dorothy Kilgallen who, recently
circled the globe, syndicated the
woman's angle, posed in a blossom
strewn toque, and endorsed cigar
ettes "for digestion's sake."
The screen version features smart
cracking Glenda Farrell, who plays
cops and robbers along with globe
girdling. Barton Mac Lane co-stars.
"The Last Train from Madrid,"
featured on the Thursday's bill:
The Hollywood aspect (non-polit
ical) of the Spanish crisis seen
through the rose-colored Hollywood
lens, and carried out a la Vicki
Baum with 10 destinies hanging by
a single thread on board the last
train from Madrid to Valencia.
The motley throng includes Doro
thy Lamour, a patrician lovely; Lew
Ay res, an American newsman; Gil
bert Roland, a young officer; and
Karen Morley, the inevitable adven
turess.
Friday and Saturday, Peter B.
Kyne's redoubtable Cappy Ricks
comes to the Stanford screen. As
head of the Ricks Lumber and Navi
gation Company, he assigns Bill
Austin (George Brent) the 12 labors
of Hercules (20th century version),
finally stamps him fit for Daughter
Ricks (Anita Louise).
"Sing and Be Happy" is the sec
ond feature. Jack Benny picked up
Vocalist Tony Martin from San
Francisco's Orpheum, made him a
network vocalist. Leah Ray sang
with Phil Harris. The two are
starred in the Twentieth-Century
film.
From Mills College comes word
that the Pro Arte String Quartet of
Belgium has been booked for an en
gagement in the Palo Alto Commun
ity Theater July 30, in a Beethoven-
Ravel concert.
Billy Mauch, juvenile: In the re
cent film, "Penrod and Sam," three
Hollywood scenarists took Booth
Tarkington's Penrod, garnished him
with a beautiful soul and high se
riousness, and served him up as an
gel on toast. That the original char
acter was thus mangled, however,
is not so important as the fact that
a new juvenile-Billy Mauch-looms
in the offing as a result of this film.
