Alarmed at the way Stanford's
tender flowers of tradition are be
ing trampled under careless feet,
several of the Farm's old guard have
suggested that the Daily do a bit of
missionary work and convert the
strangers within our gates to our
customs. When presented in good
old-grad style and backed up with
references to the tobacco smoke
screen that profanes the sacred mys
teries of the Quad, such proselyting
sounds like a manifest destiny. But
after a glance over our list of tra
ditions, most of us wonder what's
the use.
Of mores and folkways, we have a
full quota, but I trust that the mis
sionaries who balanced the diets of
cannibal chiefs died in a better
cause. For instance, there is our
first and great commandment: "Thou
shalt not smoke on the Quad." Per
haps I am reverting to second child
hood, but the two-year-old in me
asks, "Why not?" If it is out of re
spect to the founders, good enough.
But there is no authority in a hazy
x*ationalization of fire insurance; but
the physics department customarily
plays with fire in its labs, and while
the students pay and pay tuition
fees, there is no direct causal re
lation.
* * *
Again, there is that soul-stirring
manifestation of the spirit of true
communism, the hitch-hike equali
tarianism along Palm Drive. But
giving a ride to a brother student is
only common courtesy (my room
mate writes a dissenting opinion,
holding that it's a damn rare cour
tesy) .

Being one of the unfortunates who
had no choice but to believe the
dean's form letter and come to
school afoot, I have a vested inter
est in the hop-in communism. But
I'd rather take a chance on some
body's courtesy than go around
bleating about tradition.
* * *
We are also burdened with several
customs about conduct that the more
restive students consider downright
unconstitutional. Based on our
Holy Writ, the Founders' Grant, is
the dictum that Stanford men shall
not drink. Again the infant in me
asks, "Why not?" Similarly, there is
the tradition based on Schopen
hauer's pessimism which requires
that co-eds be put under lock and
key after ten-thirty. But that is
strictly none of my business, and I
decline to court trouble, or anything
else, by entering into it.
It seems the best policy, then, to
let Stanford's traditions go unsung,
and let the ungodly go unsmitten.
It is much easier and more practical
to trust to common sense and ordi
nary courtesy.

Holy Writ, the Founders' Grant, is
the dictum that Stanford men shall
not drink. Again the infant in me
asks, "Why not?" Similarly, there is
the tradition based on Schopen
hauer's pessimism which requires
that co-eds be put under lock and
key after ten-thirty. But that is
strictly none of my business, and I
decline to court trouble, or anything
else, by entering into it.
It seems the best policy, then, to
let Stanford's traditions go unsung,
and let the ungodly go unsmitten.
It is much easier and more practical
to trust to common sense and ordi
nary courtesy.

Alarmed at the way Stanford's
tender flowers of tradition are be
ing trampled under careless feet,
several of the Farm's old guard have
suggested that the Daily do a bit of
missionary work and convert the
strangers within our gates to our
customs. When presented in good
old-grad style and backed up with
references to the tobacco smoke
screen that profanes the sacred mys
teries of the Quad, such proselyting
sounds like a manifest destiny. But
after a glance over our list of tra
ditions, most of us wonder what's
the use.
Of mores and folkways, we have a
full quota, but I trust that the mis
sionaries who balanced the diets of
cannibal chiefs died in a better
cause. For instance, there is our
first and great commandment: "Thou
shalt not smoke on the Quad." Per
haps I am reverting to second child
hood, but the two-year-old in me
asks, "Why not?" If it is out of re
spect to the founders, good enough.
But there is no authority in a hazy
x*ationalization of fire insurance; but
the physics department customarily
plays with fire in its labs, and while
the students pay and pay tuition
fees, there is no direct causal re
lation.
* * *
Again, there is that soul-stirring
manifestation of the spirit of true
communism, the hitch-hike equali
tarianism along Palm Drive. But
giving a ride to a brother student is
only common courtesy (my room
mate writes a dissenting opinion,
holding that it's a damn rare cour
tesy) .

Being one of the unfortunates who
had no choice but to believe the
dean's form letter and come to
school afoot, I have a vested inter
est in the hop-in communism. But
I'd rather take a chance on some
body's courtesy than go around
bleating about tradition.
* * *
We are also burdened with several
customs about conduct that the more
restive students consider downright
unconstitutional. Based on our
Holy Writ, the Founders' Grant, is
the dictum that Stanford men shall
not drink. Again the infant in me
