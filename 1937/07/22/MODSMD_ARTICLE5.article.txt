50 Japanese Here
Organized in 1934 as a student
project to further a mutual and en
lightened understanding of the prob
lems of the Pacific, the Conference
this year will be attended by 50
Japanese students and 75 American
delegates. American representatives
will hail from over 15 schools
throughout the country.
First on the program for the vis
iting Japanese will be a four-day
tour of the Bay region, sightseeing
in San Francisco and at the Univer
sity of California in Berkeley. On
August 1, the Conference proper
will begin at Stanford. Delegates
will stay at Lagunita.
Round-tabic Discussions
Round-table discussions will be
held in both mornig and afternoon
sessions throughout the week fol
lowing. During that time delegates
will attempt to solve current polit
ical, religious, and ethical interna
tional questions of contemporary
importance.
Following the actual conference
here, delegates will journey to
Southern California where they will
be the guests of U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
student bodies. Then the Japanese
representatives will go to Portland
and Seattle, where they will leave
for the Orient toward the end of
August.
Purpose of these conferences is
the promotion of harmony and good
relationships between the two
countries. Sponsors point out that
the delegates who take part in these
conferences today may be the men
and women of responsibility in the
respective governments tomorrow.
