Summer residents of the Delta Chi

Field Day and Jolly-up for early
August, according to David Brown,
social chairman. The afternoon pro
gram will feature track events such
as dashes, high and broad jumping
and a novelty sack race. A comic
exhibition on large-wheeled bicycles
is tentatively scheduled also.
The evening's entertainment will
include, besides dancing, a piccolo
solo by J. Humphries, crooning by
G. Campbell, and a tango number
by S. Kinsman and partner. S. J.
Hartmann is assisting Chairman
Brown with arrangements.
