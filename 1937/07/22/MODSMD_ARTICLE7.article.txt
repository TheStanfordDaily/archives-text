# Degree System Change Received with Approval
## 
### 
Stanford's new degree system, which is to be adopted by the Univer
sity, is being favorably looked upon by administration and students alike.
Although the general attitude is that the plan will affect only a select
group of students, everyone interviewed on the matter believes it will be
of great benefit to those students. Dean Grayson N. Kefauver, of the School

of Education, says that it is a step<
in the right direction. He believes
that if universities do not impose
requirements that are too rigorous
on junior transfers it will attract
more students to those institutions
by making it possible for them to
look further forward in their edu
cational program.
Culver Approves
Dean of Men George Bliss Culver
is decidedly for the plan. In his
opinion it offers students of unusual
ability a wonderful opportunity to
begin specializing early in college.
However, he believes that many
students who could benefit by the
plan will not be able to as most stu
dents take several years in college
to decide on a major subject.
One student, when interviewed on
the plan, said that most freshmen,
in junior colleges as well as univer
sities, do not know what their spe
cialty will be.
Disadvantage Cited
However, one decided disadvan
tage to the plan, a student pointed
out, is that if a brilliant student is
forced to leave school at the end of
two years, after signing up for his
Master's under the new plan, he
will have nothing to show for his
work as he will not be eligible for
an A.B.
By recognizing transfers of jun
ior standing in another institution
as juniors at Stanford, the cultural
standard of Stanford is apt to be
lowered, an education major be
lieves. Another student said that
students trained in a technical jun
ior college, for instance, would be
definitely handicapped if he trans
ferred and took more academic
work, but if he could continue in
vocational work, the plan would be
of great help to him.
Will Not Avoid Courses
A graduate in the School of Edu
cation who is working for his Ph.D.
believes that students of sufficient
aptitude to work directly for a
Master's degree would not avoid any
of the courses required for an A.B.
degree which they believed would
be of benefit to them culturally.
Several graduate students in the
School of Education said that if
they had had the opportunity to
work directly for a Master's degree
they would have done so, and they
would take what extra courses they
believed would be of benefit to them.
