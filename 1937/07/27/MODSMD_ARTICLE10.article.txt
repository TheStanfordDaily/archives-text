# Mullendore Lectures At Trade Conference
## 
### 
Tolerance in dealing with current problems of labor and industry was
urged by W. C. Mullendore, vice-president of the Southern California
Edison Company and a director of the United States Chamber of Com
merce, at the first session of the Western Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives which will continue on the campus until Friday.

â–º Mullendore discussed "human re
lations in the working field" and
pointed out that the public must be
patient with the arbitration boards
because in the end it is the consumer
who stipulates the wages and prices
of the country.
Public Interest
"Property is often clothed with a
public interest, and a job with such
a public interest intimates that no
private citizen could deny the right
to others to continue working in
that job if he decided to discontinue
working in it himself. That, at least,
is a point which is worth consider
ing."
Because of the extreme importance
of wise leadership in labor and in
dustrial relations matters, this
year's program is giving special at
tention to that subject. In the opin
ion of Dean J. Hugh Jackson this
phase of the conference alone will
insure considerable attendance, par
ticularly on the part of presidents
and secretary-managers of chambers
of commerce and trade associations
on the Pacific Coast.
Harvard's Nixon Heard
The trade executives also heard
Thomas Nixon Carver, professor
emeritus of Harvard, in a short ad
dress yesterday in which he said
that, "until there is a definite change
in public sentiment there will be no
limit to taxation."
Other noted business leaders who
are expected to speak at the confer
ence are Dr. Paul Eliel, director of
Industrial Relations at Stanford,
and John F. Shelley, president of
the San Francisco Labor Council.
The conference also heard last
night a talk by George H. Davis of
the United States Chamber of Com
merce on "The United Voice of
Business." Davis' talk followed a
banquet given at the Union dining
hall at 6:30.
