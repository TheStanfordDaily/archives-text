# Early Films Seen in Movie Series Show
## Films, Stars of Wartime Decade Appear Before Movie Series Audience 
### 
America's sweetheart and Amer
ica's first movie vamp appeared in
the scenes which made them na
tional institutions for the Motion
Picture Series audience last night
Series, which is being presented in
the program, which dealt with the
rise of the American film from 1908
to 1918, were Bill Hart, Wallace
Beery and Lillian Gish.
Poker-faced Hero
Mary Pickford's vehicle was "The
New York Hat," filmed in 1912 un
der the direction of D. W. Griffith.
For its use of small details and ac
tions to delineate a character type,
and because Miss Pickford injected
warmth and sincerity into her role,
this film is considered one of Grif
fith's finest contributions to the
cinema.
Second on the program came Wil
liam S. Hart, hard-riding, poker
faced hero of the West, in "The Fu
gitive," directed by Thomas Ince.
Most unusual feature of the film was
the ruthless tragedy of the endingâ€”
as rare in the movies of 1916 as it
is today.
In "The Clever Dummy," a Mack
Sennett opus, vintage 1917, the au
dience was shown slapstick in its
purest form, with Ben Turpin lead
ing in a carnival of pie-throwing
and chases.
Theda Bara Stars
Climaxing the offering came Theda
Bara in "A Fool There Was," the
film that gave the word "vamp" to
the English language. Although
modern movie fans might be able to
see little connection between this
determined femme fatale and her
more glamorous and sophisticated
talkie counterpart, nevertheless in
pre-war days Theda Bara, con
stantly photographed with skulls
and serpents, was regarded as a
strikingly wicked personality, and
her career of evil was pursued
through 40 successful films.
Next of the Early American Film
Series, which is being presented in
connection with D. M. Mendelowitz'
course on the motion picture, will be
D. W. Griffith's "Intolerance," to be
shown August 2, and the final pro
gram, dealing with the development
of the talkie, will be shown Aug
ust 9.
