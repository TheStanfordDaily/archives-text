A fire inside an automobile and
outside the Phi Delt house disturbed
the tranquility of the Fire Depart
ment last night at 7:15 o'clock. One
fireman was caught in the act of tak
ing a shower, and another was
asleep. As more than enough men
were available, he was allowed to
slumber undisturbed. The fire was
immediately put out with no dam
age done.
