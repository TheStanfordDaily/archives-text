# Court Music To Be Topic Of Talk Here
## 
### 
Illustrating his talk with record
ings, Hugh C. Baker, former Stan
ford man and now instructor of
English at San Francisco State Col
lege, will lecture this afternoon at
4:30 o'clock in the Woman's Club
house on "Twelfth Night" music.
Mrs. Samuel S. Seward will assist
Baker by singing some of the rep
resentative muisc.
During the Elizabethan times it
was customary to have a court cele
bration on the twelfth night after
Christmas, known as Epiphany. Al
though the festival had a religious
root, the celebration was one whose
spirit could easily be compared to
April Fool's Day.
Presented under the auspices of
the Summer Drama Festival, Bak
er's lecture, which will deal with
both modern and old settings of the
play, "Twelfth Night," will show
how the music typifies the spirit of
the Elizabethan revelers during the
festival.
In the original Shakespeare play,
Baker points out, the heroine, Viola,
did a great deal of singing; though
the music was kept in later ver
sions, the singing parts were given
to the clown.
Among the records being used will
be one by the living Finnish com
poser, Jan Sebelius, sung by Marion
Saunders, famous negro contralto,
who will be on the concert series this
coming year.
