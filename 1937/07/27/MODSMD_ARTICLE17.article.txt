# Chronicle Writer Will Discuss Bach Concerts
## 
### 
Alfred Frankenstein, music editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle, will
give an introductory talk at 8 p.m.
Thursday in preparation for coming
concerts on the six Bach Branden
burg Concertos. The first concert
will take place next Tuesday eve
ning, at 8 p.m., and the second will
be held at 3:30 p.m. on Friday after
noon August 6.
Frankenstein, who is an author
ity on the music of the 18th cen
tury stated that the six Branden
burg Concertos, commissioned by
and dedicated to Christian Ludwig,
Margrave of Brandenburg, are the
composer's earliest known essay in
orchestral music. Completed in 1721,
they are the product of the period
in which Bach served Brandenburg's
friend, Leopold, of Anhalrt as chief
musician.
In discussing the difficulties of
the composers of the early period
Frankenstein said, "The orchestra of
that day was vastly different from
the orchestra of the present. The
public concert did not exist; orches
tral music was made for the private
entertainment of princes in their res
idences. Every princely house sup
ported a few musicians, but the
smaller establishments, like those of
Coethen and Brandenburg, could
not afford the luxury of a complete
staff of professional performers.
Consequently servants who could
blow or scrape — grooms, butlers,
guardsmen—were required to assist
in orchestral entertainments."
"This meant," Frankenstein went
on, "that each orchestra in each
household was capriciously differ
ent from every other. The composer,
therefore, had to know in advance
what instruments were available in
each particular band, which of these
instruments were? in professional
hands, and which in the hands of
amateurs. The contrast in modern
orchestral practice is profound, for
the modern orchestrator can safely
assume that all orchestras, wherever
located, have essentially the same
instrumental complement, and that
they will be made up of professional
players."
Frankenstein's lecture will be il
lustrated by phonograph records
and is open without charge to all
music lovers.
