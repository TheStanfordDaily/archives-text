# Stanford Rugby Squad To Take Eastern Trip
## 
### 
Rugby football at Stanford is destined to become a sport of major inter
est if tentative plans for its future go through. Such is the opinion of
Coach Harry Maloney and Wayne Richardson, high-point scorer in Pa
cific Coast rugby circles last year and an outstanding player on the Stan-

ford team.
Because the Indians' 1938 team
looks like one of the best rugby
outfits ever to represent Stanford —
even rivalling the great team of
1920 with such stalwarts as Dink
Templeton, Norman Cleveland, and
Morris Kirksey as stars—Coach Ma
loney has outlined plans for a trip
east to play Harvard, Yale and
Princeton, as well as interesting
other Pacific Coast universities to
combine and form an all-star team
to tour Australia next summer.
Veterans to Return
Heading the list of returning vet
erans are ex-Captain Joe Vigna,
star back, Wayne Richardson, key
man of the entire offense, Jack
"Curly" Partridge, who plays front
rank and is congidered the most con
sistent performer on the squad, and
Doc Luckett, a back, also quarter
back on Tiny Thornhill's American
football squad.
These three boys form the nucleus
of what Maloney believes will be
one of Stanford's greatest rugby
teams. Ray Lewis' return to the
Farm from Temple University will
greatly strengthen the outfit. Ray
was a star of the squad two years
ago before he pulled stakes to join
Pop Warner at Temple.
New Eligibility Rule
A new Pacific Coast Conference
ruling states that any man regis
tered in the University is eligible to
play on the university team. No re
quirements as to eligibility other
than registration are necessary.
Other returning men include
George Ditz, second rank; Jay Hold
ridge, back; Jim Grubbs, back;
Marvin Taylor, breakaway; Bill
Harrington, breakaway; and Karl
Schaup, scrum half.
Coach Maloney expects to see
several of the outstanding football
players from Tiny Thornhill's squad
turn out for rugby when that sport
begins during the first week in Jan
uary. Bill Paulman, Tony Calvelli,
A1 Alustiza, Jack Clark, Grant
Stone, Gene Coldiron, and Ed Gar
nier are a few of the men who may
report.
Assisting Maloney with the
coaching duties are Jim Wylie, Wil
lard Classen, and Norm Cleveland,
all former star rugby players. These
men donate their time and services
to the sport without compensation.
Rugby is not a recognized sport at
Stanford and no letter awards are
made. The men who turn out for
the squad play for "the love of the
game."
