# Anderson Contest Decision Delayed
## 
### 
Final decision on the Maxwell
Anderson play contest will be de
layed until August, Dr. Margery
Bailey announced yesterday.
Cause for this delay is Anderson's
difficulty in getting his four nation
ally famous judges together to pass
on the plays. Burgess Meredith,
Guthrie MeClintic, Helen Deutsch
and Harold Freedman are to make
the final selections.
Three plays have survived the
semi-final selections made here re
cently by Margery Bailey, Hubert
Heffner, Bayard Morgan and Mar
garet Storey. They are "Souvenirs
de la Malmaison" by Dorothy Dow,
"Dawn and Darkness" by William
L. Stephenson.
