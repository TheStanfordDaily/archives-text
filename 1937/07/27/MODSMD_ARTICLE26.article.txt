# Paly Thespians Receive Praise For War Play
## 
### 
"Journey's End," produced last
week by the Palo Alto Commun
ity Theater Players:
By far the most important dra
matic offering from either Stanford
or Palo Alto this season.
If "Journey's End" audiences
wept, their emotion was not spent
on cheap theatrics. The story of
"arms and the man" is legitimate
tragedy. And the strong honesty of
the drama was matched by that of
the players.
Stanley Pearce, as Lieutenant Os
borne, sounded depths of sincerity
and dignity. Gordon C. Lange in the
role of Captain Stanhope occasion
ally leaned rather heavily on the
stage-prop emotions of too facile
acting. For the most part, however,
he achieved a searing portrayal of a
young, war-shot neurotic. Jack
Dawson, as Lieutenant Raleigh,
brought sensitivity and pale high
breeding to the part of a high-born
young English soldier.
These three men from the same
company reach Journey's End in
March of 1918. Lieutenant Osborne
lays his watch on the table, walks
serenely over the top to certain
death by machine-gun fire. Raleigh,
the youngest man, goes over the top
like an advancing football guard, is
shot in the spine, and dies in the
arms of his boyhood idol, Stanhope.
Captain Stanhope, a war-shattered
man, disappears over the top at the
moment when his trench is shelled
in enemy bombardment.
The Palo Alto production of
"Journey's End" proves again that
it is unnecessary to greet every
home-town amateur production,
simply because it is home-town and
amateur, like a brother Elk "under
the spreading antlers" of protective
patronizing kindness and phoney
benevolence. Whatever this "Jour
ney's End" receives in praise is due
it by any standards.
