From the hinterland of the B.A.C.
the news trickles out that Coach
Dink Templeton has trekked to Hol
lywood to give movie producers
some information about the species,
college student. Although we hate
to risk a good coach, most of us feel
that Dink has a better cause than
that of many importers of light into
benighted areas.
..Heading the list of annoyances
that put the iron into the souls of
college students are the moving pic
ture caricatures of university life.
The situation has become so revolt
ing that the mention of a coonskin

coat is enough to set even a chem
major frothing like his test tubes.
We are shown dance and/or
classroom scenes which are indis
tinguishable from one another. We
see ourselves represented as an un
classified genus, somewhere below
the round worms, and slightly above
the polyps. We are told that col
lege consists of equal parts of sleep
ing, whiskey, and beautiful girls,
well mixed.
It would not be hard for a red
baiter to detect in this representa
tion the taint of communist propa
ganda. For the movie version of the
college student bores from within,
even as it bores on the screen. When
the average freshman comes to
college, it takes him most of his
first year to break down the im
pression that he is on an institu
tionalized beer-bust.
And for two years before high
school spews forth its graduating
class, the rising generation has been
paying exorbitant prices for broken
down flivvers, race-track clothes,
and "experience." It really is amaz
ing that more college students do not
strangle their younger brothers.
In the last few years, the increas
ing number of college graduates and
the growing disgust of undergrad
uates has taken some of the edge off
the movie libels. But the myth of
"college life" continues. Compare
the movie version of a campus
dance, complete with skirtless
chorus and a minimum of 50 al
most-censured poses, with our own
jolly-up, which would be a bromide
even to Billy Sunday.
If Coach Dink can do something
about reducing the movie popula
-1 tion of coon-coated sub-idiots, he
will deserve a statue on the English
corner.
