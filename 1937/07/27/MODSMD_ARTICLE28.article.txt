# Artists Study Oriental Rugs
## Art Class Visits Home Of Noted Collector 
### 
Art Appreciation Class 51, in its
fourth field trip in the study of mod
ern and contemporary art, visited
the home of Dr. Carl Brand, pro
fessor of history, who has one of
the best private collections of rugs
in this locality.
Dr. Brand, in a short lecture to
the class, described the different
types of rugs and said an Oriental
rug is never perfect. The nomads
believe that it is impossible for man
to create anything perfect, and to
create anything perfect would be a
violation of their religion; so they
purposely weave in imperfections in
their rugs."
Dr. Brand said that a student of
the subject could tell what region a
rug was from by the type of design
common to various tribes. When one
tribe copies the designs of another,
it is possible to detennine the origin
of the rug by learning the ingredients
in the dyes used.

The inorganic theory of the crea
tion of petroleum is that it was
formed in the earth by chemical re
actions due to volcanic disturb
ances.
