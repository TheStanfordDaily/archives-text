# D. W. Griffiths 'Intolerance' Will Play Here
## Early Films Considered Influential in Motion Picture Development 
### 
"Intolerance," the film which, be
cause of its sociological implications
and advanced photographic tech
nique, is regarded as being one of
the most significant films in the his
tory of the cinema, will be shown
Monday night—the first screen pro
duction presented in Memorial Hall.
Fourth in the series of early
American films being shown in con
nection with the course on the mo
tion picture, it is, according to In
structor D. M. Mendelowitz, the most
serious and impressive work under
taken by the famous director, D. W.
Griffith.
Regarded as Great
"While not so popular in this
country as "The Birth of a Nation,"
Mendelowitz said, " 'Intolerance' had
a great deal of influence on directors
here and abroad and has frequently
been revived in Europe, where it is
regarded as a great work."
So vast was the theme which Grif
fith attempted to project on the
screen, that four separate stories,
laid in four different historical pe
riods, are necessary to bring the film
to a climax.
When completed, each separate
story of "Intolerance" was recorded
on a different color film—pink, blue,
sepia and the customary black-and
white, in order to help the audience
keep the plot straight. It was so
long that it took the best part of a
day to exhibit it. Monday night's
presentation, however, has been cut
to 12 reels and is all in the black
and white film.
Cast Notable
Not the least among the picture's
notable features is its cast, which
contains, often in minor roles, play
ers who, until the advent of the
talkie, occupied top positions as
stars. Among those whom movie
fans may still recall are: Monte Blue,
Bessie Love, Constance Talmadge,
Alma Rubens, Carmel Myers and
Colleen Moore. Lillian Gish has a
prominent role, and Douglas Fair
banks is an extra.
Single admissions to the film,
which will be shown at 7:45 in the
Memorial Hall, cannot be sold, as it
is necessary to purchase a subscrip
tion ticket allowing the purchaser to
attend three of the five of the series.
