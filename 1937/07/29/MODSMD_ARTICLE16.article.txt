# Stanford To Get J.C. Track Man
## 
### 
Stanford track prospects took a
decided turn for the better when it
was learned that William Wohle,
shot-put ace, will matriculate here
next fall. Wohle, a husky lad from
Brooklyn, New York, is the present
national junior college record-holder
in his event and was undefeated in
junior college competition last sea
son, while attending San Mateo J.C.
Starting his athletic career at New
Utrecht High School in New York,
Wohle was fortunate enough to come
under the tutelage of Barney Hy
man, a coach who has developed
many outstanding weight men.
While in P.S.A.L. competition he
hurled the 12-pound shot over 56
feet.
His best mark to date with the 16-
pound pellet is 51 feet V\ inch, made
in the P.A.L. meet at Angell Field
last May.
