# Stanford Students Get Artillery Commissions
## 
### 
Commissions in the Field Artillery Reserve Corps were given to two
Stanford students and two others received medals of honor this summer
at the annual R.O.T.C. Summer Camp at Monterey.
John Loupe and Wlliam Goldner, both of San Francisco, received their
commissions as second-lieutenants in the Reserves, culminating four years

♦of military science along with their
regular college studies.
Medals of Honor
The American Legion presented
Robert Garrettson with a medal for
being the best type of field artillery
man at the camp. Cameron B. Hall
was given a similar medal by the
Field Artillery Association.
The Field Artillery camp, which is
located in the historic old Presidio
of Monterey, lasted from June 10 to
July 21, during which time the stu

ond-lieutenant in the field artillery.
Activities included firing the 75 mm.

"Stanford men exhibited a high

Warden, Wash., also made excellent
showings during their six weeks
training period this summer.
Just returned from Ft. Warden,
located on Olympic peninsula 30
miles from Seattle, is John Savage,
who, with three other engineering
students, Frank Lindsay, Marvin
Taylor, and John Burt, were kept
busy June 14 to July 24 testing
and remounting guns and determin

chamber pressure.
Although far outnumbered by the

Stanfordites, said Savage, made a
good showing, especially in marks
manship, and had a thoroughly en
