# Gridiron Stars Keep in Shape During Summer
## Gridders Spend Summer Getting 'Kale' or 'Rest' For Busy Season Ahead 
### HILMER LODGE 
Gridders from Stanford's football
team are earning their "dough" at
various jobs this summer, in fact, a
number of them are not even earn
ing the old "kale," for they feel that
"rest" is what they need. But most
of the aces are out to get as many
dollars salted away as possible be
fore winter sets in.
Tony Calvelli, who'll probably be
first-string center this fall, being
shifted from fullback, where he
functioned last year, and Joe Vigna
are working as roustabouts for the
Shell Oil Company at Long Beach.
Bob Mathews, who plays a mean
game at guard, is doing the same
kind of work at the same place.
Mathews spent several days on the
campus last week, giving his reason
for coming north as "the climate
lured me."
Keeps Greens
Jack Clark, first-string end, de
cided that working on the Farm was
better than slaving for dollars down
in Glendale. He is a greenkeeper on
the Stanford Golf Course.
Bill "Wimp" Paulman, a probable
Ail-American next year and co-star
along with Bobby Grayson in Stan
ford's Rose Bowl victory over
S.M.U. in 1936, is a member of the
weed-hoeing department of the
Ventura division of the Shell Com
pany. A recent letter from Bill in
dicates that he "never saw so many
weeds in all my life as they have
around Oxnard and Ventura."
Grant Stone, who plays the flank
opposite Clark, is just "sojourning"
at his home in San Diego.
Zagar Ranches
Pete Zagar, tackle, who, along
with Paulman ranks as All-American
material and the national intercol
legiate discus-throwing champion,
is a leader of a group of boys at
Orme's Dude Ranch in Arizona. A
card from Pete says that he likes
"the country down here. There's
plenty of huntin' and shootin' to
keep a fella busy."
Leo Ferko, left guard, is spending
his summer vacation toiling in the
fog of South San Francisco. Jim
Coffis, the ace of Indian safety men,
is working in San Francisco.
Tiny Thornhill, who oversees the
work of these boys when they're out
on the football field, is traveling
through northern California, Oregon,
and Washington in his trailer wagon.
Mrs. Thornhill is with him on
the trip.
