# Stanford's Giants Look Like Potential Champs
## 
### 
Stanford's "rollicking, frolicking
crimson giants of the hardwood," the
finest collegiate basketball team in
America during 1937, will be just as
patent this coming season as ever
before, in the opinion of Coach John
Bunn.
Two stellar players, Dinty Moore,
guard, and Howell Turner, forward,
will be the only lettermen lost from
last year's squad. To compensate for
the loss of these men Coach Bunn
has several promising men from the
frosh and some excellent reserve
material from last year's squad.
Championship Squad
Stanford's chances to become the
nation's number one team in 1938
rests upon the shoulders of the In
dians' ail-American forward, Hank
Luisetti, Jack "Ghost" Calderwood,
one of the Coast's outstanding
guards, and Art "Stork" Stoefen, a
rangy and aggressive center.
Three men appear at the present
writing capable of filling Moore's
and Turner's vacated positions. The
guard position is a toss-up between
H. B. Lee, the smallest member on
the squad, and Bob Zonne, who is
6 feet 4 inches tall, are a definite as
set at this position. Coach Bunn fig
ures that Lee, who possesses a lot
of "zip and speed" might make a
better running mate for Calder
wood. Lee plays the same type of
fiery ball as displayed during the
past few seasons by Dinty Moore.
Towering Team
Bob Zonne's chances at guard de
pend on whether Bunn decides to
use a "tower" squad. If Bunn de
pends on height as a factor in next
year's team and uses Zonne, his
squad will average over 6 feet 3
inchesâ€”Luisetti and Calderwood be
ing the shortest, a mere 6 feet 3
inches.
Veterans Lost
At Turner's forward position,
Phil Zonne, younger brother of Bob,
will probably be stationed. During
the past season Phil was playing
center and guard. The shift to the
new position will give him more of a

chance to display his scoring ability.
Bill Quade and "Sparky" Robert
son are the other members of last
year's squad who will not return
next year.
"Nellie" Heath, a guard, is the
other returning letterman and mem
ber of last year's squad. Heath, who
proved an excellent relief man last
year, will probably be used in this
same capacity this year.
Reserves from last year's squad
who are to bo reckoned with for the
1938 squad are: Jack Kessell, for
ward Bill Schutte, guard; Dick Lyon,
center; and Bill Rapp, guard.
Last year's frosh squad, which
Coach Bunn plans to keep intact and
play as one team, furnishes Ted

Lyon, Lou Staley, Leon LaFaille and
Darrell Huddleson, forwards; Tom
Siebert, 6-foot 6-inch center, and
Wilbert Anderson, Gil Rahn, and
Sherwood Norton, guards.
Will Tour Country
The Indian quintet will make an
other tour through the country dur
ing Christmas vacation and play sev
eral teams in New York's Madison
Square Garden, including Clair
Bee's famous Long Island Univer
sity Blackbirds, the team which
Stanford defeated before 17,000 fans
last year. Previous to this game,
Bee's team had not lost a game in
something like 45 starts. Stanford's
win was really a tribute to a great
team and John Bunn, a great coach.
