# G. B. S. Gibed In S. F. Show By Marionettes

George Bernard Shaw strings
along: During the World's Fair,
summer of '35, while Sally Rand
shivered in the Midway, puppet
George Bernard Shaw quipped
Shavianisms in the Open Theater.
Now, the Irish scorpion-wit, a little
older, will creak in the joints as he
bows again before a San Francisco
audience Wednesday night, August
4, in Ralph Chesse's renowned
Marionette show at the Alcazar.
Appropriately under the auspices
of the F.T.P., shoe-string producer
Chesse also dangles from the top of
his miniature theater wooden rep
licas of Toscanini in a symphony and
Bill Robinson in new routines.
On August 12, the Alcazar bills
"Power," a newspaper drama fea
turing a cast of 100 players.
"Easy Living," featuring Jean Ar
thur, Ray Milland, and Edward Ar
nold, runs at the Fox - Stanford
through Thursday. Mitchell Leisen,
after directing bombshell Arthur in
this one, mopped' his brow, issued
the following statement: "Without
temperament no actor or actress will
ever be any good."
"Temperament," Liesen says, "is
a manifestation of a high mental ten
sion absolutely necessary to a good
performance. In fact, I always work
best with temperamental casts."
"I Cover the War" doubles with
the "Easy Living" comedy.
Marion Davies illustrates that his
tory repeats itself in "Ever Sincc
Eve," a comedy starring her oppo
site Robert Montgomery and coming
to the Fox-Stanford Friday and
Saturday. No snake in the Garden
of Eden, Montgomery plays only the
worm in the apple into which La
Davies has bitten many times during
her screen career. The theme: a
stenogiapher takes the curlers out
of her hair, hitches on a pair of
glasses and makes funny faces to
scare away advances from her em
ployers.
"The Great Gambini" is the rab
bit in the hat of the main featureâ€”
a hocus pocus spook show, featur
ing Akim Tamiroff in the title role.
