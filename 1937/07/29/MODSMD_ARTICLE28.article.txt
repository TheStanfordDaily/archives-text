# BEMIS ON EDUCATION
## 
### 
Samuel Flagg Bemis, professor
from Yale University, will be the
speaker at this week's Education
Club luncheon to be held tomorrow
noon in the Union Dining Hall on
"Education on the Defensive."

We are taller in the morning than
when we go to bed at night; the
night's rest eases the weight of our
joints.
