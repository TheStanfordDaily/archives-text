Campus cynics declared an ex
tra dividend last week when one
of my attempts to do my duty by
the back page of the Daily sug
gested that the University offer a
course in practical peace. The
article itself now lines bureau
drawers or has been sent home so
licitously wrapped around sox whose
open-work toes need the maternal
touch. And the critics' pyrite con
tributions to the golden store of sar
casm are hardly destined for immor
tality, but some of the questions they
asked might stand consideration.
My press agent work for the angel
of peace was hardly completed be
fore the local chapter of the league
of cold water throwers formed a
bucket brigade. They pointed out
gleefully that there is no professor
who could teach peace without in
curring the wrath of our noble pa
triotic societies, and that no man who
knows anything about it could be
brought here to teach.
* * *
But it happens that Stanford has a
number of men thoroughly fitted to
conduct a practical course in peace.
Several of our economics and history
professors have specialized in the
subject, and we need only co-ordi
nation of their studies. Moreover,
among the sponsors of the Univer
sity we have a man with greater
prestige and experience in peace re
lationships than almost any other
living statesman. Mr. Herbert Hoo
ver has had as good an opportunity
to understand peace and war as any
man in this generation; and Mr.
Hoover is identified with the Univer
sity.
* * *
It seems to me that Stanford could
take the lead in attacking one of
the fundamental problems of our
times, if it would ask Mr. Hoover to
conduct or supervise a course in
peace.

In case the cynics begin to shout
"politics," I may point out that I
am a confirmed Democrat and was
raised in a country where any Re
publican candidate who gets two
votes is suspected of repeating. In
ternational peace is usually consid
ered above party lines.
