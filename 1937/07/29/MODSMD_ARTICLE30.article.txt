# MRS. JACKSON ENTERTAINS
## 
### 
Forty visitors to the Stanford
campus, wives of men who are at
tending the annual Western Con
ference of Commercial and Trade
Executives, were entertained at a
tea given by Mrs. J. Hugh Jackson,
wife of the dean of the Graduate
School of Business, at her home
Monday.

peace, we automatically think of men
who have devoted their lives to in
ternational relations. We consider
men like Ramsey Mac Donald and
Edouard Herriot as qualilied to ren
der judgment. But Mr. Hoover has
had even more international expe
rience than that connected with the
Presidency. Most of his life has
been spent in cleaning up the wreck
age felt by war, or other tragedies
all over the world. He saw the
Boxer revolt in China. His work on
relief in Belgium during and after
the World War is well known.

He has always stood for interna
tional co-operation and good feel
ing, and as President his efforts to
advance these principles are notable.
Founder of the Hoover War Library,
his theoretical knowledge is exten
sive.
And so it appears that Stanford
has an unparalleled opportunity to
lead the attack on the great prob
lem of our generation. If we take ad
vantage of it, we may be able to
make peace something more than a
subject for stained-glass windows.
