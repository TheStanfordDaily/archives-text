Broadway playwright and former
Stanfordite, to produce any of his
plays royalty-free at Stanford,
Sword and Sandals society is pre
senting "The Buccaneer" as twin
piece to Anderson's "High Tor,"
read here recently.
Romantic Comedy
"The Buccaneer," one of the ear
liest Anderson dramatic efforts,
deals with the career of the Eng
lish sea-captain, Henry Morgan, who
pillages his way down the coast of
Panama in the period of legalized
piracy. His encounter with Donna
Lise, an English-born woman living
in Panama, during one of his looting
adventures, supplies the romantic
interest of the comedy.
As Morgan, the epitome of Eng
lish nationalism during the reign of
King Charles 11, Clark fills his sec
ond leading role since his return to
the Farm stage from the American
Academy of Dramatic Art where he
studied last year. Clark's first
starring role this summer was as Van
Dorn, the young Dutch idealist in
"High Tor." Both Jane Clary and
Sylvia Onesti also figured in the
"High Tor" reading, as Lise and the
stage-direction - reader, respectively.
Cady in Cast
Bud Cady was featured in the
Spring Show and as De Witt, the
phantom salt of the Dutch crew in
"High Tor." James Bacigalupi, re
cruit from Santa Clara, is one of
the leading players in the forthcom
ing Stanford production of "Twelfth
Night."
"The Buccaneer" is under the gen
eral supervision of the Summer
Drama Festival and was selected be
cause it conforms with the comedy
motif of this summer's offerings.
