# Japanese Visitors Find U.S. Not So Astonishing

Perhaps the most surprising thing
I about the Japanese visiting the cam
' pus this week is their refusal to be
amazed at the United States.
Looking thoroughly occidental in
their western clothes, slightly self
conscious about their English, but
not at all shy, they quickly assured
the reporter that America and
Americans were not a new experi
ence for them. Through courses in
school, previous Japanese-American
student conferences, and American
students and professors in Japanese
universities, they had become quite
familiar with the United States long
before landing in San Francisco.
Americans Hospitable
They were prompt, however, in
stating their impressions of the
American people, most of which, the
reporter gathered, were formed be
fore coming to this country. Amer
icans, they said, are extremely hos
pitable, very frank and open. They
found life moving at a more rapid
tempo here than in Japan. Asked to
indicate a characteristic which dis
tinguished Americans from other
peoples, they enthusiastically se
lected American "sense of humor."
Although there are no night clubs
in Japan, the delegates were pre
pared for the Bal Tabarin, where
they were entertained Saturday
night, and by American movies,
which make up 45 per cent of all
the movies shown in Japan. The
larger cities on the islands have
dance halls where western "swing" is
the rule, but clubs where dancing,
wining, and dining are engaged in
almost simultaneously are unknown.
Moriuchi Speaks
According to Nobuji Moriuchi,
president of the Japanese delega
tion, "the thing which keeps the
Japanese capitalistic system, bor
rowed from the United States, from
siring huge monopolies and produc
ing tycoons like Ford and Rocke
feller is the old family system.
"A man cannot go very far," he
said, "without thinking of his fam
ily. No one can get along in the
business world by considering him
self only. He must work for the
good of his brothers, his sons, his
cousins, his father."
"We took the best in western civ
ilization," he continued, "and adapt
ed it to our family system. But our
westernization is merely on the sur
face. Underneath it lies the tradi
tion and spirit which has descended
through countless generations."
Emperor Held Supreme
The Japanese still regard their
emperor as a god. They hastened
to explain, however, that their con
ception of God is different from
ours. The Emperor is regarded
rather as the father of his people,
who are, in turn, his family. This
explains the Japanese emphasis on
family which in turn explains their
reverence for the Emperor.
"The Emperor has been kind
enough to place the work of gov
ernment in the hands of the people,"
a Japanese delegate said, "but the
final power is his."
