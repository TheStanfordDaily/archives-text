ship'."

director of the summer session, wel
comed the delegates with the mes
sage that it was particularly appro
priate that Stanford, whose motto is
"The Wind of Freedom Blows,"

ship'."

comed the delegates with the mes
sage that it was particularly appro
priate that Stanford, whose motto is

essential. He also indicated the close

isted between Japan and Stanford,
