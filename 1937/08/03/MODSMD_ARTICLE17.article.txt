# Play Set Based On Painting
## 
### 
The set design of the mythical
sea-coast of Bohemia which figures
in Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night,"
slated for Stanford production Aug
ust 20 and 21, was suggested by a
Giotto painting, Waldemar Johansen
said yesterday in discussing the, set
construction he expects to complete
by the end of the week.
The shore scene is one of six sets
for the play and features in the
working model. It consists of three
jagged cliffs against a cloud-drift
drop, based on a landscape by the
Renaissance master, Giotto.
Tudor Too Heavy
Commenting on the general plan
of production, the Stanford tech
nical director said, "Although
"Twelfth Night" belongs in the Tu
dor period, we felt that the Tudor
motif, with its low arches and sculp
tural effects, was too heavy for the
light and fanciful spirit of Shake
speare's comedy.
"Again, Tudor architecture is
English," he continued, "and the
whole play suggests the decorative,
romantic spirit of the late Renais
sance Italian style. So, we have
taken all this into consideration and
added something of our own.
"I can't say that these are strictly
authentic or stylistic or modernistic
â€”or put them into any definite cate
gory. The main thing we have tried
to catch is the clever, imaginative
mood of the play."
