## 
### 
Expressing a wish to make Stan
ford her alma mater, Shirley Tem
ple, Hollywood's number one starlet,
left the Farm Saturday afternoon
for a month's stay in Hawaii, after
a brief visit with her brother, Jack,
now enrolled in summer session
here.
Arriving late Saturday morning,
Shirley and her parents accompa
nied Jack to his usual eating place,
the Lodge in Palo Alto, where they
enjoyed a meal at which autograph
hunters were conspicuous by their
absence. After lunch, Shirley ex
pressed a wish to see the New The
ater, through which she was con
ducted by J. P. Cahn of the Stage
craft group. The party then pro
ceeded to the Quad and to the
Lawrence Frost Memorial Amphi
theater.
A tour of the Row ended at her
brother's fraternity the Delta Chi
house, where the the Temple party
was shown the building by Social
Chairman David Brown.
On leaving the campus, Shirley
expressed her interest in the work
taking place in the New Theater and
hoped that she would be able to see
Director Waldemar Johansen and
the rest of the staff in the near fu
ture. Johansen appears to have
made quite an impression on the
young actress by his explanations of
the technical features of the build
ing.
Shirley will return to the main
land August 28 and will start work
immediately on her second million
dollar feature, "Rebecca of Sunny
brook Farm," adapted from the Kate
Douglas Wiggin novel of the same
name.
