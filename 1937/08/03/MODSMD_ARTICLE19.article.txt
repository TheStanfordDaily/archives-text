# Bach Concert To Be Heard Here Tonight
## 
### 
With the playing of three of the
Bach Brandenburg Concertos to
night at 7:50 o'clock, the Memorial
Theater will receive its musical ini
tiation.
The concert, sponsored by Eliza
beth Sprague Coolidge and the Cool
idge Foundation, is to be broadcast
over the National Broadcasting
Company at 8 p.m. Another concert
consisting of three other Branden
burg concertos will be presented at
3:20 o'clock Friday afternoon.
First American Performance
Distinguished by being the first
American performance of the entire
series in the original chamber mu
sic form, the concerts will be pre
sented by the Roth String Quartet,
E. Robert Schmidt, pianist, and
members of the San Francisco, Los
Angeles, and Denver symphony or
chestras. Feri Roth, solo violinist,
will direct.
As pointed out by Alfred Frank
enstein, music editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, in his lecture
in the Little Theater last Thursday,
the six concertos were Bach's first
efforts in the purely orchestral field.
Both in form and orchestration they
represent a radical departure from
the conventional practice of Bach's
day.
Tonight's Program
Tonight's program will consist of
Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G
major, for three violins, three violas,
and three violoncelli, with bass and
pianoforte; Brandenburg Concerto
No. 5 in D major, for pianoforte,
violin, flute and strings; and Bran
denburg Concerto No. 1 in F major,
for two horns, three oboes, bassoon
and violin, with strings and piano
forte.
The original text will be followed
as closely as possible. However, due
to the fact that some of the instru
ments for which Bach wrote the
music were obsolete for a long while
it is difficult to find musicians who
can play these instruments.
