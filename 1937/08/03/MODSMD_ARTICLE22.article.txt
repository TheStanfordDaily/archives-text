# Anderson Prize Play to Be Read
## 
### 
The prize play in the Maxwell An
derson contest for verse drama will
be presented as a formal reading
next Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Little
Theater in Memorial Hall. Out of
183 entries, "Souvenir de la Mal
maison," a warm comedy of royal
marriage relations by Dorothy Dow
of Chicago, was judged the best by
eastern judges, according to a wire
received from Anderson last Fri
day.
The reading will follow an after
noon symposium on verse drama
and a dinner for contributors and
their friends. Lucie Bentley will
read the part of Josephine, France's
wayward empress, who defies her
husband's relatives and appreciates
her husband's officers. Miss Bent
ley was seen earlier this year in a
program of foreign farces. As Jose
phine she will be given every op
portunity to exercise her flair for
high comedy.
Charles, most appreciated by Jo
sephine, will be read by James San
doe, who has appeared before in
campus productions. He has recent

ly returned from directing plays at
the University of Colorado.
Napoleon, who turns from martial
to marital troubles, will be J. Fen
ton McKenna.
