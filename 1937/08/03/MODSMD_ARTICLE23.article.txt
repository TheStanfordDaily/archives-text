# Templeton Anticipates Powerful Track Team
## 
### HILMER LODGE 
It is an old story at Stanford to say, "Well, I feel kind of sorry for Dink
Templeton and his track team. He lost all his good material last year
and we'll be mighty lucky to score 50 points against Cal." But each year
Dink manages to mold a team which kicks the stuffing out of Cal and
gives U.S.C. all they want.
Stanford's 1938 track team looks, at the present writing, to be a poten
tially great team. Of course, the potentiality lies much in the great ability

of Dink Templeton to make cham- i
pions from laggards of last year's
reserves and to keep his present
stars on top.
Malott Is Star
Ray Malott, the unneralded lad
who came from nowhere during the
past season to become the national
champion for the quarter mile, prob
ably is the outstanding letterman
from last season's squad.
In a recent interview Dink stated
that Malott would break Ben East
man's world record for the 440 very
soon. He even went so far as to say
that Silent Ray might even turn
the trick this summer on his pres
ent European barnstorming tour.
Malott To Double
Next season Dink figures to
double Malott in either the quarter
and half or the quarter and 220, and,
of course, he would also be used in
the mile relay. Malott has a best
mark of 21.6 in the 220, made when
he scored the only double in this
year's Big Meet, also winning the
440 in 48.1.
Zagar Second
Pete Zagar, national intercolle
giate discus throwing champion
with a toss of 159 feet, ranks right
along with Ray Malott as one of
next year's major point makers. Big
Pete should have no trouble in con
sistently tossing the platter over the
160-foot marker.
Use Old Frosh
With these two major point-mak
ers as a nucleus, Templeton will
be able to gather the rest of his re
turning lettermen plus four fresh
man stars and what material arrives
from junior colleges, and will form
what should be Stanford's greatest
dual meet team. Dink believes this
year's team was by far the best dual
meet team he has ever coached; but
next year's team should be head and
shoulders above this year's squad.
Returning Lettermen
To team up wtih Malott and
Zagar, Dink has the following let
termen returning:
Stan Hiserman, with a mark of 9.9
in the 100 and 21.5 in the 220, is a
member of Stanford's world record
holding 880-yard relay team. It is
more than likely that he will try a
new event next year, the low hur
dles, thus cutting out the 220.
Dick Carew, another crack sprint
er, will be a definite menace to
coast sprinters. Dick is fairly con
sistent at 10 flat, and with fall work
should get well under this mark.
(Editor's Note. â€” A second in
stallment on Stanford's 1938 track
prospects will appear in the next j
issue of the Daily.)
