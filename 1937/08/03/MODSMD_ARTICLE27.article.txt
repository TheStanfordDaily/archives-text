# Harlow's Last Play Now At Local Cinema
## 
### 
"SARATOGA," currently playing at
the Fox-Stanford Theater:
Carol (Jean Harlow) goes toney on
her horse-breeding family, snares
a millionaire socialite from Newport.
When her father collapses in his
folding chair at the Saratoga track
(no pun intended), Harlow and
Duke, the bookie (Clark Gable),
merge as business partners. Before
the final fade-out, he has drained
enough kale from the Newport
fiancee to cover living expenses for
himself and Carol for the rest of
their married lives.
The action in "Saratoga" is neu
ralgic—stiff in the joints. The se
quences spin like a "yo-yo" top;
build-up—stop—jerk—build-up. The
plot wheezes. Still, "Saratoga" is a
good picture to see —if only for sen
timental reasons, and despite its
glaring faults, makes for fairly good
entertainment.
"THE JONES FAMILY, second fea
ture:
At least two reels of this should
have been canned instead of tin
ned. Spring Byington is in the cast.
DATELINES:
August 6 and 7—Palo Alto work
shop production of Edmond Ros
tand's "The Romances," in the out
door theater.

tive appearances up and down the
coast until the public has finally
tested and approved its value.
