# Exchange Prof Lectures Thursday

Dr. Samuel Flagg Bemis, of the
Yale department of history, spoke
at the Education Club luncheon
Thursday on "Education on the
Defensive."
Dr. Bemis, awarded the 1926 Pu
litzer prize for letters in social sci
ences, said that he observed a split
in college faculty between "educa
tors" and "teachers."
Educators, whom he defined as
concerned with enlarging the cur
riculum, were lowering the stand
ards; the teachers, concerned with
subject matter, were struggling to
maintain the standards.
