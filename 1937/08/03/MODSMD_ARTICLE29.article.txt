Almost every student can remem
ber some occasion in his not-so
chequered career when he wished
fervently that American universities
took part in politics. The pathetic,
wind-up of a pajamarino has made
more than one undergraduate burn
to crack heads or rouse rabbles.
Reports this summer indicate that
the monastic tranquility of campus
life has contrasted badly with stu
dent riots in Europe.
* * *
Few of us, of course, want any
street fighting on the European plan.
And no one cares to have his teeth
kicked in by the gendarmerie, just
for the excitement; but it does ap
pear that American students might
play a more active part in national
politics and policies.
The first step in this direction is
offered by the conference of Japa
nese and American students now in
progress on the campus. Confer-

ences of this type offer the under
graduate his one dignified and ef
fective approach to politics. The
question of international relations is
certainly one of the most important
that faces the world today. When
students begin to figure in it, they
can no longer be considered political
little boys, to be patted on the
head and dismissed.
Many of our educational stand
patters shudder at the idea of un
dergraduates "playing politics."
They seem to consider anything con
nected with government the trunk
highway to hell. And they snarl
that they would see their boys in
Cal, Stanford, Harvard (multiple
choice or fill in) rather than having
them fouled with political mire.
* * *
But the students see no reason
why they should be good boys and
play with their theories while their
elders trade dirty names and insane
bets. In England it is customary for
students to campaign for the can
didate they favor. On the continent,
it is the polite thing to stage a
good riot in the name of a political
something or somebody. Why, in
America, should we limit ourselves
to sad little discussion groups where
everybody talks at once about dif
ferent things?
It is true, of course, that students
are hardly ready to run the country.
But certainly they know as much
about it as the soap-box orator.
And it is probable that they would
swallow the political line less read
ily than the ditch digger. Undoubt
edly students would be idealistic;
but idealism in politics is badly
needed to temper the prevalent
cynicism which is better adapted to
raids on the treasury than to gov
ernment.
It appears that in the Japanese

conference students are making an
opening for real participation in
American politics. The old guard
will grouch at this and the cynics
will have a field day. But despite
grouches and jeers, students are be
ginning to figure in our government.

why they should be good boys and
play with their theories while their
elders trade dirty names and insane
bets. In England it is customary for
students to campaign for the can
didate they favor. On the continent,
it is the polite thing to stage a
good riot in the name of a political
something or somebody. Why, in
America, should we limit ourselves
to sad little discussion groups where
everybody talks at once about dif
ferent things?
It is true, of course, that students
are hardly ready to run the country.
But certainly they know as much
about it as the soap-box orator.
And it is probable that they would
swallow the political line less read
ily than the ditch digger. Undoubt
edly students would be idealistic;
but idealism in politics is badly
needed to temper the prevalent
cynicism which is better adapted to
raids on the treasury than to gov
ernment.
It appears that in the Japanese

conference students are making an
opening for real participation in
American politics. The old guard
will grouch at this and the cynics
will have a field day. But despite
grouches and jeers, students are be
ginning to figure in our government.

Almost every student can remem
ber some occasion in his not-so
chequered career when he wished
fervently that American universities
took part in politics. The pathetic,
wind-up of a pajamarino has made
more than one undergraduate burn
to crack heads or rouse rabbles.
Reports this summer indicate that
the monastic tranquility of campus
life has contrasted badly with stu
dent riots in Europe.

Few of us, of course, want any
street fighting on the European plan.
And no one cares to have his teeth
kicked in by the gendarmerie, just
for the excitement; but it does ap
pear that American students might
play a more active part in national
politics and policies.
The first step in this direction is
offered by the conference of Japa
nese and American students now in
progress on the campus. Confer-

ences of this type offer the under
graduate his one dignified and ef
fective approach to politics. The
question of international relations is
certainly one of the most important
that faces the world today. When
students begin to figure in it, they
can no longer be considered political
little boys, to be patted on the
head and dismissed.
Many of our educational stand
patters shudder at the idea of un
dergraduates "playing politics."
They seem to consider anything con
nected with government the trunk
highway to hell. And they snarl
that they would see their boys in
Cal, Stanford, Harvard (multiple
choice or fill in) rather than having
them fouled with political mire.
