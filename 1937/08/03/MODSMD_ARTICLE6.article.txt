Dr. Bemis further showed there
was interplay between the social
crisis of today and the educational
crisis.
The social problem, Bemis stated,
is: "Can democracy cope with to
day's large technological problems?"
Citing certain European nations as
examples of countries using differ
ent political forms to meet large
technical problems, Bemis declared
that the ineffective political opera
tion of American direct democracy,
and its accompanying political cor
ruption, are endangering the form of
government here.
