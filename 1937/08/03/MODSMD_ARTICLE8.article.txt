### GEORGE CAMPBELL 
Co-Chairman, Stanford Delegation
To the delegates of the Fourth America-Japan Student Conference:
The fourth America-Japan conference has now begun. We
American delegation from Stanford take this opportunity to ex
tend to our Japanese and American guests the most hearty
greetings. We hope that your stay here will be a pleasant one
and that it will prove a source of information and the starting
point for many new friendships.
It is an honor to the University that such an organization
should meet here for its discussions. We feel that these con
ferences between the young people of our two nations are sig
nificant in many ways. Their value lies not only in the dis
cussion groups themselves, which offer an opportunity for a
frank and searching exchange of ideas, but also in the in
formal and friendly meetings which occupy much of the
leisure time. At the nine discussion round tables we will talk
about such subjects as armaments and security, world society
and the national state, marriage and family life in Japan and
America, and the role of arts in the two countries. Each of
you will attend the eight hours of discussion on each of the
three round tables of your choice. Thus there will be an op
portunity to cover many different aspects of each problem, and,
above all, a chance to assimilate each other's viewpoint.
Surely, understanding and friendliness are the best guar
anties of good will among nations. The round tables will do
much to establish these relations, for there will be a completely
candid exchange of ideas which will permit us to find out
what we of Japan and America
think about our mutual problems.
So, in establishing such relations,
we feel that we have a happy mis
sion before us in attempting to make
the conference a success. You must
feel that Stanford is heartily in ac
cord with everything we are doing.
The hospitality of the University is
gladly extended to you, and we hope
that when you leave you will feel
as happy to have been here as we
are to welcome you.

The world's loftiest capital is La
Paz, Bolivia.
