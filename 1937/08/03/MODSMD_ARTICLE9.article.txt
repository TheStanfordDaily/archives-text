# D. W. Griffith Production Shown Here
## 
### 
Although at times it found the
rapid sequences and plot shifts be
wildering, the audience at last
night's showing in Memorial Hall of
"Intolerance" showed an apprecia
tion of the skill and imagination
which have caused this picture to be
considered D. W. Griffith's greatest
work and one of the most important
films ever made.
For plot material the movie
reached into four periods—the slums
of today, 16th century France, Cal
vary, and ancient Babylon, in order
to illustrate its theme of social in
justice. The climax of all four stor
ies came in the dramatic trial scene
in the last two reels, in which the
principals were Mae Marsh, Miriam
Cooper and Robert Harron.
Filmed in 1916, "Intolerance" was
one of the first movies to combine
lavish sets and huge mob scenes
with such new photographic tricks as
close-ups of faces and hands and
odd camera angles. This and its so
ciological implications; which are
said to have made it a favorite
with Lenin, who arranged to have
it shown throughout the U.S.S.R.,
account for its significance in the
history of the cinema, according to
Daniel M. Mendelowitz, instructor
of the course in the motion picture.
The talkie, "All Quiet on the
Western Front," will be shown next
Monday as the last in the series of
a short survey of American films.
