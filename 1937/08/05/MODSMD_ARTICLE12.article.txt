## Parliamentary System Is Cited as Best Bulwark Against Dictatorship 
### 
In full swing at the America-
Japan Student Conference's midway
point are the daily round table dis
cussions. A list of the subjects up
for discussion, including student life
in Japan and America, Japan's and
America's economic stake, arma
ments and national security, govern
ment, marriage, and family life, the
worker and his job, moral and spir
itual values, world society and the
national state, and the role of the
arts in Japan and America, revealed

to solve all the problems of the
world, but to understand them."
Colegrove Speaks
Kenneth W. Colegrove, authority
on political science from Northwest*
ern University, spoke on "Parlia
mentary Government in Europe,
Asia, and America" during the con
ference's second general meeting
yesterday. Professor Colegrove
stated that common opinion now
has the British Parliamentary Sys
tem as the surest bulwark against
dictatorship, with tradition helping
to check revolutionary changes. "The
immediate revolt in congress is an
indication of the extension of presi
dential influence and leadership
within the last few years. Theodore
Roosevelt acted like a prime min
ister, Woodrow Wilson believed he
was a prime minister, but Franklin
Roosevelt is a prime minister," Pro
fessor Colegrove stated.
He further added, "Japan will
never have a truly representative
parliamentary government until the
method of direct appeal from the
military to the emperor is abro
gated."

will be discussed by Dr. Samuel
Flagg Bemis, visiting professor of
