# Making of Law Will Be Topic Of Cohen Talk
## Professor of Philosophy To Discuss Pros, Cons Of Legislative Action 
### 
Dr. Morris R. Cohen, acting pro
fessor of philosophy, will speak on
"â€¢Making of the Law" in the Little
Theater, Memorial Hall, Thursday
evening, August 5, at 8 o'clock.
Dr. Cohen, regularly a professor
of philosophy at the College of the
City of New York, will endeavor to
show the philosophical side of legis
lation together with the pros and
cons of law enacting methods.
In commenting on his forthcom
ing address, Dr .Cohen said yester
day, "Deliberate law-making is a
relatively recent phenomenon in
human history. It arises out of the
needs of rapidly changing conditions
in a heterogeneous society. For
the most part men are governed by
habits and customs and not only
punish departures from the latter,
but also put them under divine
sanction and attribute them to divine
origin."
"In the United States judges at
first claimed the right to set aside
legislation which they did not ap
prove as contrary to natural right.
Since the Civil War, however, the
same result has been achieved by
stretching the terms 'due process,'
'liberty,' and 'property,' until no
one really knows, with any certain
ty, what proposed law is or is not
constitutional," Dr. Cohen said.
Professor Harold Chapman Brown,
of the Stanford philosophy depart
ment, will introduce Dr. Cohen.
