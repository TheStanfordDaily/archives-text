## Population, Emigration Topic of Lecture 
### 
Speaking on "The Problems of
Population and Emigration in Italy,"
in the Little Theater of Memorial
Hall yesterday afternoon, Dr. Luigi
Villari, Commendatore della Colona
d'ltalia, expressed the conviction
that problems of population must be
considered in the light of what the
future must hold. "The same forces
which make for an increase in popu
lation also give birth to a robust
nation in the majority of cases,"
he said.
Dr. Villari pointed out that unem
ployment does not reduce the birth
rate, and therefore reduction of the
rate would not aid unemployment,
because with a smaller population
the market for goods is smaller.
Dr. Villari has spoken in several
other American universities this
summer while on a tour of this
country. He was educated in Flor
ence and the University of Siena,
Italy. He has lived in England and
has held several consular posts in
the United States. During the
World War he was with the Italian
Expeditionary Force in Macedonia
and was decorated with the Italian
Croce di Guerra, the British Mili
tary Cross, and the French Croix di
Guerra, the British Military Cross,
and the French Croix de Guerre
avec Palmes. He is also a Cheva
lier in the Legion of Honor.
