# Review of Returning Veterans Shows Track Prospects Good
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond installment on Stanford's 1938
track and field team prospects.)
Hay Malott is the only returning
letterman in the quarter mile. In
this event, however, Carl Mahurin,
a 1:54.8 and letterman, may be
used next year. Mahurin has a re
lay time of 48-6 for the 440.
Mahurin, if he runs the 880, should
be able to get under 15.3, and team
up with Rusty March, who has a
1:55.5, to form a combination which
will be hard to beat.
Mile, Two-milers
In the mile and two-mile Edson
Burrows and March will be avail
able. As a sophomore two years ago,
Burrows ran the mile in 4:19.7 and
the two miles in 9:25.3â€”b0th excep
tionally good times. Last year Ed
was handicapped by a broken ankle
sustained in a game of touch foot
ball. Burrows ran 4:22. March's best
time over the mile is 4:23 but this
coming season, his last, should wit
ness his time going down close to
4:17.
Bill Hawkins will be the only var
sity high hurdler returning. Haw
kins had a best mark of 14.8 last
year. If he turns out for fall prac
tice, there is no doubt but what he
should lower his time to 14.5 or
better.
Shot Putters
Stanford's long line of shot put
ters will not end with the gradua
tion of Jim Reynolds and A1 Her
shey. Six-foot 8-inch Tom Mont
gomery, who has a mark of 50 feet
4 inches, is the only returning let
terman in this event. Two boys,
Jack Lippman, with a mark of 48
feet IV4 inches, and Ted Huckle
bridge, with a mark of 48 feet 4
inches, neither being lettermen,
should show enough improvement
next year to keep Dink Templeton's
prestige in the shot on the top rung.
Hugh Gribbin, second-place win
ner in the National Collegiate dis
cus throw, with a toss of 156 feet
6 inches, should follow right along
with Pete Zagar and be over the
160-foot marker.
Vaulters
Templeton has two men in the
pole vault, Summer "Duke" Gill
and Vic Boore. During the past year
both of these boys seemed to reach
their ceiling at 13 feet. Both have
faults which only practice can rem
edy. Until these faults are removed
their vaulting future is limited.
Up from Bill Ellington's team of
1940, Dink has Russ Wulffe, little
Big Meet high jump winner at 6
feet 4 inches; Dick Simpson, a .15
high hurdler and a 24.5 low hurdler;
Ray Brown, with a mark of 24 feet
4 inches in the broad jump and also
potentially a great low hurdler, and
Stan Anderson, Little Big Meet win
ner in the discus with a mark of
145 feet.
