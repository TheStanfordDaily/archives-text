# 'New Faces' Scheduled For Fox-Stanford
## 
### 
"NEW FACES" tops the Fri
day-Saturday bill at the Fox-
Stanford Theater:
The priceless scene in this very
funny comedy comes where Milton
Berle, a broke producer, in the space
of 15 yards of ticker tape, sinks his
last dollar in stocks at 29, sells out
at 19, buys up at 29 again, sells out
at 16, and winds up again at 29 with
thinning hair and neurosis. Ac
tually, Milton Berle-esques make
this sequence much better than the
original in "As Thousands Cheer,"
Broadway musicomedy; whence, it
appears, it was gently but firmly
lifted. Joe Penner and Parkyakar
kus also disguise the fact that "New
Faces," as far as acting talent goes,
only serves to show how well the
old ones do.
"CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS"
conies to the Fox-Stanford Sun
day.
Based on the stirring Kipling leg
end, starring Spencer Tracy, Freddie
Bartholomew and Lionel Barrymore,
this is guaranteed to squeeze tears
out of the House of Morgan.
"POWER" is set for a four week's
run under F.T.P. auspices at the
Alcazar in San Francisco starting
August 12.
Still packing the house in its east
ern run in New York, "Power" dram
atizes, from a newsman's front
page slant, the role of power in the
world today. Grist for the mill of
the newspaper reporters who wrote
the play have been supreme court
records and stock and bond manipu
lations regarding the development of
electricity and the dramatic true
stories surrounding them.
The Federal Music Project her
alds the advent of the Bay Region
100-piece symphony in its third con
cert August 10 at the Veteran's
Auditorium, Civic Center, at 8:20.
Boris Blinder, cellist, who played in
Pierre Monteux's Paris orchestra,
will solo.
Leslie Howard on acting: Actor
Howard in a recent article, "Thespis
the Jade," holds forth on the glit
tering game. Among other things,
acting for movies bores him stiff
. . . any man worthy of a beard
to mutter in would do so at the
prospect of painting his face and
exposing his emotions . . . he, Les
lie, would never be an actor except
for the tad for mental acting which
is no acting at all, as far as he, Les
lie, is concerned and finally he
wouldn't stick with the business at
all except that it keeps him in the
manner to which he has become ac
customed. —Frances Slater

at 19, buys up at 29 again, sells out
at 16, and winds up again at 29 with
thinning hair and neurosis. Ac
tually, Milton Berle-esques make
this sequence much better than the
original in "As Thousands Cheer,"
Broadway musicomedy; whence, it
appears, it was gently but firmly
lifted. Joe Penner and Parkyakar
kus also disguise the fact that "New
Faces," as far as acting talent goes,
only serves to show how well the
old ones do.
"CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS"
conies to the Fox-Stanford Sun
day.
Based on the stirring Kipling leg
end, starring Spencer Tracy, Freddie
Bartholomew and Lionel Barrymore,
this is guaranteed to squeeze tears
out of the House of Morgan.
"POWER" is set for a four week's
run under F.T.P. auspices at the
Alcazar in San Francisco starting
August 12.
Still packing the house in its east
ern run in New York, "Power" dram
atizes, from a newsman's front
page slant, the role of power in the
world today. Grist for the mill of
the newspaper reporters who wrote
the play have been supreme court
records and stock and bond manipu
lations regarding the development of
electricity and the dramatic true
stories surrounding them.
The Federal Music Project her
alds the advent of the Bay Region
100-piece symphony in its third con
cert August 10 at the Veteran's
Auditorium, Civic Center, at 8:20.
Boris Blinder, cellist, who played in
Pierre Monteux's Paris orchestra,
will solo.
Leslie Howard on acting: Actor
Howard in a recent article, "Thespis
the Jade," holds forth on the glit
tering game. Among other things,
acting for movies bores him stiff
. . . any man worthy of a beard
to mutter in would do so at the
prospect of painting his face and
exposing his emotions . . . he, Les
lie, would never be an actor except
for the tad for mental acting which
is no acting at all, as far as he, Les
lie, is concerned and finally he
wouldn't stick with the business at
all except that it keeps him in the
manner to which he has become ac
customed. —Frances Slater
"NEW FACES" tops the Fri
day-Saturday bill at the Fox-
Stanford Theater:
The priceless scene in this very
funny comedy comes where Milton
Berle, a broke producer, in the space
of 15 yards of ticker tape, sinks his
last dollar in stocks at 29, sells out
at 19, buys up at 29 again, sells out
at 16, and winds up again at 29 with
thinning hair and neurosis. Ac
tually, Milton Berle-esques make
