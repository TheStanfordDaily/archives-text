If the elevator operators in the
fabled ivory tower had gone on
strike, the princess who lived in its
penthouse would have felt very
much the same as Stanford did when
the specter of unionization moved in
on the new theater last week. When
the theater employees' union an
nounced that Memorial Hall must
engage a full-time "back stage"
worker, most of the students felt
like a princess told to walk up ten
flights. The whole affair seemed un
precedented, and it looked very
much like lese majeste.
But the unfortunate feature of the
union's stand is not that it upsets
educational Dignity. The trouble is
that to grant the union's demands
will set a precedent permitting labor
organizations to interfere with and
dictate to the University.

It is a platitude that the primary
purpose of a college is to educate its
students. But in the fuss and fury
that surrounds labor agitation this
principle is often ignored. If the
universities and the unions can
work together advantageously, there
is no reason why they should not do
so. But if union demands interfere
with education, it is time for labor
to make a concession.
The total employment by univer
sities is negligible in comparison to
other fields which concern labor.
When labor makes demands on a
college, it does so only for "the prin
ciple of the thing." Real benefit to ;
the workers is almost non-existent, j
But to grant union demands may
cause a tremendous handicap to edu
cation. It is obvious that the great- :

And in this case, granting the the
ater workers' demands will be a
definite hindrance to teaching at
Stanford. We will have to employ a
man for whom there is no work most
of the time. And students will lose
the opportunity for experience in
back stage work.
But the worst aspect of the situa
tion is the precedent it will set. If
we have to employ one union man
next we can be forced to employ all
union men. And this principle can
be applied to all departments. Will
we be forced eventually to employ
union men in forge lab, in the en
gineering school? Will the Daily be
placed on an "organized" system,
with frosh reporters punching time
clocks?

When the unions interfere with
colleges and antagonize college stu
dents, they are making future
trouble for themselves. The men
who are in school now are the men
who will be running business and
leading public opinion 15 years from

now. If unions are to continue, they
must gain the friendship, not the
hate, of these men.
It appears, then, that everyone
will benefit if the theater workers
will leave Memorial Hall alone.

The word quarantine comes from

If the elevator operators in the
fabled ivory tower had gone on
strike, the princess who lived in its
penthouse would have felt very
much the same as Stanford did when
the specter of unionization moved in
on the new theater last week. When
the theater employees' union an
nounced that Memorial Hall must
engage a full-time "back stage"
worker, most of the students felt
like a princess told to walk up ten
flights. The whole affair seemed un
precedented, and it looked very
much like lese majeste.
But the unfortunate feature of the
union's stand is not that it upsets
educational Dignity. The trouble is
that to grant the union's demands
will set a precedent permitting labor
organizations to interfere with and
dictate to the University.

It is a platitude that the primary
purpose of a college is to educate its
students. But in the fuss and fury
that surrounds labor agitation this
principle is often ignored. If the
universities and the unions can
work together advantageously, there
is no reason why they should not do
so. But if union demands interfere
with education, it is time for labor
to make a concession.
The total employment by univer
sities is negligible in comparison to
other fields which concern labor.
When labor makes demands on a

And in this case, granting the the

definite hindrance to teaching at
Stanford. We will have to employ a
man for whom there is no work most
of the time. And students will lose
the opportunity for experience in
back stage work.
But the worst aspect of the situa
tion is the precedent it will set. If
we have to employ one union man
next we can be forced to employ all
union men. And this principle can
be applied to all departments. Will
we be forced eventually to employ
union men in forge lab, in the en
