ture with singing or talking. A1 Jol
son's famous "Mammy" scene is one
of those to be presented.
Part of one of the original talking
newsreels, an interview with George

"Steamboat Willie," the first

is still very moving to audiences de-
spite its being filmed seven years
ago," D. M. Mendelowitz, who has

tle sound effects which helped place
the talkies on the same fluent bases
as silent films, "All Quiet" was ac
claimed as one of the first social
problem cinemas, disclosing the
horrors of war. "The Road Back," a
sequel to "All Quiet on the West
em Front," is a current production.
