# Union Orders Hiring Of Theater Worker
## 
### 
Unless University officials accede
to union demands to employ a full
time property and utility man in Me
morial Hall, it may be necessary to
cancel the Concert Series for next
year, according to a notice received
by Acting Comptroller J. Hugh
Jackson.
The International Alliance of
Theatrical Stage Employees notified
Jackson that it could no longer waive
union regulations that a full-time
union man be employed back stage
in the new theater.
Rule Previously Waived
Jackson pointed out that in past
years the theatrical workers' group
had not attempted to impose the
same regulations upon Stanford
performances as it does upon those
in a commercial theater.
He said that a statement concern
ing the action to be taken would be
issued after he had conferred with
President Wilbur, who has been ab
sent from the campus for the past
few weeks. In the meantime there is
no indication how far the union is
prepared to go to press its issue with
the University.
Union Insistent
It was pointed out, however, by
an unofficial spokesman for the
group, that the union is insisting up
on the employment of one of its own
men as property custodian "in fair
ness to other union men who accom
pany some of the units which travel
with concerts and other road show
companies which give performances
on the campus."
In answering this, Jackson pointed
out that the University already em
ploys a full-time custodian for Me
morial Hall in the person of Walde
mar Johansen, technical director,
who also serves as a member of the
University faculty. If the Univer
sity does not comply with the de
mands of the union it faces the pros
pect of abandoning the campus ap
pearances of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra and such in
ternationally known stars as Nelson
Eddy, Lawrence Tibbett, and Lily
Pons.
