# Bach Concert Pleases Audience Next Program Set for Tomorrow
## 
### ERNESTINE MAGAGNA 
Under the musical direction of
Feri Roth, solo violinist who directed
the Tuesday night concert, the sec
ond program of Johann Sebastian
Bach's Brandenburg Concertos will
be presented tomorrow afternoon at
3:20 o'clock in the Memorial Hall.
The concert will consist of Con
certos Nos. 6, 4, and 2.
Rcorcliestration
In the 19th century, Bach's Con
certos were reorchestrated in the
light of modern devices and the so
norities built up far beyond the
limitations intended by the com
poser. The concert tomorrow, to
gether with Tuesday night's pro
gram; marks the first presentation
in America of the concertos in their
original intimate chamber form.
The attempt to reconstruct the
original text and thereby reveal the
exquisiteness of effect which Bach

Demonstrating the fine acoustics
of the Memorial Theater, a sparkling
presentation of three of the six Bach
Brandenburg Concertos drew a large
audience Tuesday night. The pro
gram was broadcast over the NBC
network.
The three concertos, varied in
form and each requiring different
grouping and orchestral arrange
ment, were presented in the original
chamber form. With the exception
of the use of a modern piano instead
of a harpsichord and an ordinary
violin instead of the violino piccolo
(a small fiddle tuned a minor third
higher than a violin) the music was
played by the instruments for which
it was written.
Presentation Dramatic
A stirring presentation, the con
cert consisted of Concerto No. 3 in
achieved is hampered, however, by
the fact that many of the instru
ments used in Bach's time have be
come obsolete, and it is difficult to
find instruments and players for
some parts. In the fourth concerto
Bach intended the old-fashioned
fipple flute (played with a beaked
mouthpiece and held before the
player like an oboe or clarinet) to
be used. However, transverse flutes,
a modern instrument, will be
used in the performance here. Sub
stitutes are also being made for the
violas da gamba of the sixth con
certo.

G Major, for three violins, three
violas, three violoncellos, double
bass and continuo; Concerto No. 5
in D Major, for violin, flute and
piano forte, with string accompani
ment; Concerto No. 1 in F Major for
two horns, three oboes, bassoon,

violin, with string accompaniment
and continuo. The concertos were
dramatic and elaborate — yet finely
flexible, allowing for many varia
tions and combinations.
It is to be noted that the finale
of each of the concertos consisted of
some type of dance music: No. 3, a
fast wheeling jig; No. 5, an inge
niously polyphonic jig; and No. 1,
a minuet. Since incorporating dance
music in a concerto is a highly un
orthodox procedure, it is probable
that Bach did this in order to flatter
his patron's taste for dance music.

piano forte, with string accompani
ment; Concerto No. 1 in F Major for
two horns, three oboes, bassoon,

violin, with string accompaniment
and continuo. The concertos were
dramatic and elaborate — yet finely
flexible, allowing for many varia
tions and combinations.
It is to be noted that the finale
of each of the concertos consisted of
some type of dance music: No. 3, a
fast wheeling jig; No. 5, an inge
niously polyphonic jig; and No. 1,
a minuet. Since incorporating dance
music in a concerto is a highly un
orthodox procedure, it is probable
that Bach did this in order to flatter
his patron's taste for dance music.
Under the musical direction of
Feri Roth, solo violinist who directed
the Tuesday night concert, the sec

Bach's Brandenburg Concertos will
be presented tomorrow afternoon at
3:20 o'clock in the Memorial Hall.
The concert will consist of Con
certos Nos. 6, 4, and 2.

In the 19th century, Bach's Con

light of modern devices and the so
norities built up far beyond the
limitations intended by the com

in America of the concertos in their
original intimate chamber form.

Demonstrating the fine acoustics
of the Memorial Theater, a sparkling
presentation of three of the six Bach
Brandenburg Concertos drew a large
audience Tuesday night. The pro
gram was broadcast over the NBC
network.
The three concertos, varied in
form and each requiring different
grouping and orchestral arrange
ment, were presented in the original
chamber form. With the exception
of the use of a modern piano instead
of a harpsichord and an ordinary
violin instead of the violino piccolo
(a small fiddle tuned a minor third
higher than a violin) the music was
played by the instruments for which
it was written.
Presentation Dramatic
A stirring presentation, the con
cert consisted of Concerto No. 3 in
achieved is hampered, however, by
the fact that many of the instru
ments used in Bach's time have be
come obsolete, and it is difficult to
find instruments and players for
some parts. In the fourth concerto
Bach intended the old-fashioned
fipple flute (played with a beaked
mouthpiece and held before the
player like an oboe or clarinet) to
be used. However, transverse flutes,
a modern instrument, will be
used in the performance here. Sub
stitutes are also being made for the
violas da gamba of the sixth con
certo.

G Major, for three violins, three
violas, three violoncellos, double
bass and continuo; Concerto No. 5
in D Major, for violin, flute and
piano forte, with string accompani

two horns, three oboes, bassoon,

violin, with string accompaniment
