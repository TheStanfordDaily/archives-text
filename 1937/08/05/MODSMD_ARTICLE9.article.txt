### 
A touring exhibition of paintings
by 12 of California's leading young
water colorists, together with a lec
ture illustrated by Lawson P.
Cooper, youthful art critic, is the
unusual offering of "The California
Group" to be given in the large
back lecture room of the Art Gallery
at 8 p.m. August 16.
Cooper, who represents the group,
says, "Perhaps never before, in all
the history of art, has just such a
group arisen. These men are not
the usual struggling, neglected
geniuses, but successful, normal
young men, who have taken posi
tions of leadership in their separate
communities. They glory in the
color and movement of the life they
live in this modern western world of
today."
Those whose work will be shown
are Millard Sheets, Paul Sample,
Barse Miller, Phil Dike, Paul Mays,
Gee Jackson, George Post and Tom
Lewis. Most of the members of the
group are under 30, yet all have re
ceived national recognition.
