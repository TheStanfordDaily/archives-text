### 
Concluding the Japan - America
Student Conference, in session here
from August 1 to 7 was a dinner
given for the delegates last Satur
day night by Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur in the Stanford nion. Guests
included Dr. and Mrs. Eliot Mears
and Dr. and Mrs. P. J. Treat. Dr.
Mears, who is director of the Sum
mer Session, and Dr. Treat spoke
for the American delegates, while
Mr. Tajima represented the Japa
nese.
Many of the Japanese students
were dressed in their native cos
tumes, adding color to the scene.
Following dinner eight acts of en
tertainment with such traditional
dances as the sword dance and the
parasol dance were presented in the
Nitery.
Informal Dancing
Informal dancing occupied the re
mainder of the evening. This is re
ported to be the first opportunity for
many of the Japanese men students
to associate with Japanese women
students in the American fashion. In
Japan there are no coeducational
schools and "dates" are unknown.
The Japanese delegates left La
gunita Court Sunday morning for
Southern California and the start of
the tour they are to make of the
western states before returning to
Japan.
Conference Successful
The conference as a whole was a
social and an academic success,
George Campbell, co-chairman of
the Stanford delegation, announced
yesterday.
Campbell further stated that this
conference is believed to be even
more of a success than the 1936
Tokio conference because the round
table subjects were more specific in
nature and the discussions had been
more equally divided from both the
United States and Japan.
