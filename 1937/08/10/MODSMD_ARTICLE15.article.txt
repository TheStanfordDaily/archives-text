# Wells To Give Next Tudor Lecture Here
## 'Queen's English' Topic Of Speech Scheduled For Tomorrow Night 
### 
How Shakespeare's lines were
spoken when his plays first were act
ed before Elizabeth audiences will be
described by Dr. William Wells in
tomorrow night's Tudor lecture on
"The Queen's English."
Dr. Wells, who formerly taught
here, is an assistant professor at
the University of North Carolina,
where he has done extensive re
search in the history of the English
language. His lecture will be sixth
in a series in which the School of
Letters is providing a background
for the Summer Drama Festival pro
duction of "Twelfth Night," by
means of describing what life was
actually like in the Tudor era.
The work of recreating the sounds
of Elizabethan speech has been car
ried out, according to Dr. Margery
Bailey, by studying rhymes, metrics,
and the rather erratic spelling of the
time, and from these deducing what
the phonetic qualities of the various
vowels actually was. Dr. Wells,
through compiling bibliographies of
diaries, memoirs, and other books
in which the vigorous, everyday
language is used, has made valuable
contributions to the study.
Although Elizabethan writing is
easily understood by people of to
day, their speech would practically
be unintelligible, Dr. Bailey said,
and therefore there will be no at
tempt to use the authentic pronun
ciation in "Twelfth Night."
