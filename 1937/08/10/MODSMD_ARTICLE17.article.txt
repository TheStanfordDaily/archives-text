# Jane Clary Plays Lead In 'Buccaneer' Reading
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
With the leading feminine role of Donna Lisa in Maxwell Anderson's
romantic comedy, "The Buccaneer," due for reading Saturday night in the
new Little Theater, Jane Clary chalks up her fourth major part in campus
dramatics since her arrival here a year ago.
Most recently, the young actress, who came here from Pasadena J.C. in
September and has since been featured as hard bitten Bankside Kate in

►"This Side Idolatry" and as torch
singer Abbey in "Brief Moment,"
played opposite Fred Clark in a
reading of Anderson's "High Tor,"
as Lise. Again Saturday Miss Clary
teams with Clark, the privateer, as
the haughty Englishwoman who
falls for the swashbuckling pirate
when he sets himself up in her
home in Panama.
Held Offices
The smokey-voiced thespian, who
toured with a New York stock com
pany, served as vice-president of the
Pasadena Players Association, and
has recently been elected president
of Masquers Stanford girls' dramatic
society for fall quarter, comments
thus on the peculiarities of Play
wright Anderson's lines and charac
terizations:
One Difficulty
"The only difficulty 1 can see in
Anderson's plays after this, my sec
ond part, is that of getting enough
variety in the lines. This was espe
cially true of Lise in "High Tor"
and, as a matter of fact, wherever
he uses poetry. With Lise, for in
stance, I had to read the poetry
with zest and life and still make the
Dutch phantom woman sound like a
ghost. One thing I particularly like
about Anderson, though, is this: he
gives all his women very interesting
and subtle personalities — none of
this ingenue, old lady, villainess
sort of typing."

man are featured in the cast of Sat
urday's reading, as Donna Lisa's two
attendants.
