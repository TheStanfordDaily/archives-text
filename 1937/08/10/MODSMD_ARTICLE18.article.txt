# Cohen Depicts Legal Change
## Professor of Philosophy Traces Innovations 
### 
How modern law is gradually
changing from the ancient concepts
of custom to deliberate legislation
was described by Dr. Morris R. Co
hen, acting professor of philosophy,
in a lecture last Thursday.
Until very recently, Dr. Cohen
stated, legislation has consisted of
mere recognition and definition of
age-old habits and customs. Viola
tions of such "legislation" not only
were punishable but also were linked
to divine origin. Consequently, pun
ishments could be given divine sanc
tion.
Changing Needs
The needs of modern heteroge
neous society, however, with its
rapidly changing conditions, is giv
ing rise to a new type of law-mak
ing, the deliberative type. Now, Dr.
Cohen said, less consideration is
given to what has been traditional
and more attention is directed at ef
fectiveness.
The philosophical methods used
by justices to set aside legislation of
which they did not approve was also
discussed by Dr. Cohen. Formerly,
he said, judges accomplished such
deletion by not approving what was
"contrary to natural right." Since
the Civil War the same result has
been achieved by stretching such
terms as "due process," "liberty,"
and "property."
Definitions Uncertain
So far has this stretching process
been carried, Dr. Cohen stated, that
| uncertainty now exists as to the ac
j tual meanings of these terms.
I Dr. Cohen is regularly a profes
' sor of philosophy at the College of
| the City of New York but is lectur
ing at Stanford this summer as an
j exchange professor. He is recog
| nized as one of the country's lead
j ing philosophers.
