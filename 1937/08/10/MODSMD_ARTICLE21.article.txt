# Thornhill to Start Fall Practice September 10
## 
### 
Thirty more days and football will
be on a playing basis at Stanford.
September 10, head coach Tiny
Thornhill will gather his 50-odd war
riors about him and show them the
tactics and intricacies necessary for
the acquisition of the 1937 Pacific
Coast Conference championship.
Of course all Tiny can do to bring
the championship which Stanford
won three years in a r0w —1933,
1934, and 1935—back to the Farm is
to implant into the boys "what
they've got to do to get it!" The
major task of making this team does
not rest so much this year on
Coaches Thornhill, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson and Ben Winkleman,
but rather upon the boys themselves.
Lettermen Returning
Most of the men reporting for the
squad this year will be returning
lettermen and reserves from last
year who have got the hang of Stan
ford football. This year's team's fu
ture will rest upon the playing abil
ity of such stars as Pete Zagar at
left tackle, Jack Clark at right end,
Bill Paulman at quarterback or full
back, Grant Stone at left end, Jim
my Coffis at left halfback, and Tony
Calvelli or Louie Tsoutsouvas at
center.
Leo Ferko and Bob Mathews, re
turning first string guards, are go
ing to have a stiff task holding down
their positions. Frank McMillan,
Wayne Richardson, Jay Holdridge
and Dick Brigham will furnish
Mathews and Ferko plenty of
trouble.
Battles for Positions
At right tackle, held down last
year by Claude Calloway, Stan An
dersen will be the leading contender,
although a junior college transfer is
expected to give Andersen a battle
for the position. The two backfield
positions which bear watching are
fullback and right halfback. Joe
Vigna played the halfback spot last
year, but Bill Kirsch, Ed Garnier or
A1 Alustiza, might give Vigna
trouble.
Right now the fullback position is
wide open. Bill Paulman could be
used here if a suitable man can be
found for the quarterback spot. Jake
Brigham and Chet Patton stand out
as the two logical candidates. Thorn
hill can always use Calvelli, who
played this position last year, if
necessary. J

Brigham and Chet Patton stand out
as the two logical candidates. Thorn
hill can always use Calvelli, who
played this position last year, if
necessary. J
Thirty more days and football will
be on a playing basis at Stanford.
September 10, head coach Tiny
Thornhill will gather his 50-odd war
riors about him and show them the
tactics and intricacies necessary for
the acquisition of the 1937 Pacific
Coast Conference championship.
Of course all Tiny can do to bring
the championship which Stanford
won three years in a r0w —1933,
1934, and 1935—back to the Farm is
to implant into the boys "what
they've got to do to get it!" The
major task of making this team does
not rest so much this year on
Coaches Thornhill, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson and Ben Winkleman,
but rather upon the boys themselves.
Lettermen Returning
Most of the men reporting for the
squad this year will be returning
lettermen and reserves from last
year who have got the hang of Stan
ford football. This year's team's fu
ture will rest upon the playing abil
ity of such stars as Pete Zagar at
left tackle, Jack Clark at right end,
Bill Paulman at quarterback or full
back, Grant Stone at left end, Jim
my Coffis at left halfback, and Tony
Calvelli or Louie Tsoutsouvas at
center.
Leo Ferko and Bob Mathews, re
turning first string guards, are go
ing to have a stiff task holding down
their positions. Frank McMillan,
Wayne Richardson, Jay Holdridge
and Dick Brigham will furnish
Mathews and Ferko plenty of
trouble.
Battles for Positions
At right tackle, held down last
year by Claude Calloway, Stan An
dersen will be the leading contender,
although a junior college transfer is
expected to give Andersen a battle
for the position. The two backfield
positions which bear watching are
fullback and right halfback. Joe
Vigna played the halfback spot last
year, but Bill Kirsch, Ed Garnier or
A1 Alustiza, might give Vigna
trouble.
Right now the fullback position is
wide open. Bill Paulman could be
used here if a suitable man can be
found for the quarterback spot. Jake
Brigham and Chet Patton stand out
as the two logical candidates. Thorn
hill can always use Calvelli, who
played this position last year, if
necessary. J
