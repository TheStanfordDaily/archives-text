# Malott, Levy Win in Sweden
## 
### 
Stanford's two national track and
field champions, Ray Malott in the
400 meters and Phil Levy in the
discus, were victorious in their first
European appearances last week.
Malott won the 400 meters at
Stockholm, Sweden, in the fair time
of 48.7. In this same meet Levy won
the discus with a toss of 155 feet.
Times and distances for both of
these meets were comparatively slow
in all events, save possibly the mile
run, where Archie San Romani, the
great miler from Kansas State
Teachers, won his specialty in 4:08.4.
