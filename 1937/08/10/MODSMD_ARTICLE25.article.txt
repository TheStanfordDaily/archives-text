Eighteen members of William Ir-
I vine's class in art appreciation vis
ited the estate of John Francis Ney
lan, nationally known attorney, last
Friday where they were entertained
with swimming, dinner, and an eve
ning with Neylan, who exhibited his
books.
Among the valuable books which
make up the collection are the sec
ond, third, and fourth quarto edi
tions of Shakespeare's plays, first
editions of Hawthorne's "Scarlet
Letter," and Whittier's "Snowbound."
The American first editions were
bound in plain cloth; most of the
English works have hand-tooled
leather bindings.
In addition to Dickens "Martin
Chuzzlewit" in the original paper
bound serial form, Neylan also has
an early edition of the St. James
version of the Bible, a first edition
of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, an
autographed edition of Charlotte
Bronte's "Jane Eyre," an Incinabu
lum, several volumes of Cruik
shank's and Rollinson's drawings,
and a first edition of Shelley.
