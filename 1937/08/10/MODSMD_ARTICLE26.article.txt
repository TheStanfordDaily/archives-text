# Arnold To Give Salzburg Talk
## Professor Will Feature Festivals, History 
### 
Dr. Robert F. Arnold, acting pro
fessor of German, will speak on
"Salzburg and Its Festivals" in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall
Thursday evening at 8 o'clock. The j
lecture wlil be illustrated with
slides.
In commenting on his forthcoming
address yesterday, Dr. Arnold said
that he would attempt to give "an ;
impression of Salzburg, which, ac- j
cording to the consensus, ranks with ;
Naples, Hong Kong, Rio de Janeiro,
and San Francisco, as one of the l
world's fairest cities."
For a thousand years, Dr. Arnold
says, Salzburg was the capital of a j
country ruled by archbishops as in
dependent as lords. The lecturer
will endeavor to trace the town's
history during that time, emphasiz
ing especially the stories of the birth
of Mozart and of the Protestant ex
pulsion of 1731 which sent hundreds
of refugees to Georgia.
Slides will also be shown of the
various musical dramatic festivals
which are held each year in Salz

| burg. Most famous of these are the
| Max Reinhardt festivals which have
become popular since the World
War.
The week of seven days was es
tablished by the Babylonians.
