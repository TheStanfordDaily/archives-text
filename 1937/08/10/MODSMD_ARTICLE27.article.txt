"SOUVENIR DE LA MALMAISON":
Dorothy Dow of Chicago hauled
off the Maxwell Anderson verse
drama purse for uncorking the par
lor and bedroom antics of Napoleon
and Josephine.
Saturday's reading of her "Sou
venir de la Malmaison" showed that
parlor and bedroom antics are still
as good a comedy situation as Noel
Coward thinks, that Miss Dow's
verse breezed along at proper com
edy clip, and that said antics were
linked into a neat plot. Only a little
matter of dialogue and acting can
explain why Dorothy Dow's really
topping idea shot its bolt in Satur
day's reading. For the former, it
can be said that the lines needed
sustaining come-back bounce. To
simplify the point still further, there
wasn't enough witty content in
them to last for all the words, and
not enough in the situation itself to
disguise that fact.
Furthermore, there can be no
doubt that J. Fenton McKenna, who
read Napoleon, pushes his voice from
the diaphragm in a way that should
awe all public speaking majors. And
his laugh booms forth from depths
unknown. But just why, in this en
lightened day and age, any actor
should plop himself into an over
stuffed, old-fashioned characteriza
tion is not quite clear. After all, it
is reasonable to suppose that even
Napoleon relaxed in his own bed
room.
Lucie Bentley's Josephine, on the
other hand, needed Lynn-Fontan
ning. Miss Bentley should have
caught up her lines, been little less
conscious of playing the great
"femme fatale," and lit her speeches
with that cozy glow that is switched
on only by spontaneity. Unfortu
nately missed were all Josephine's
royal opportunities for that sort of
"I - love-you-darling-but-there's-a
bee-crawling-up-your-neck" infor
mality. However, Robert Brauns as
Josephine's one-time flame (e pluri
bus unum), Myna Hughes, as her
jealous sister-in-law, and James
Sandoe and Sydney Head, in minor
roles, were excellent.

rently playing at the Fox-Stanford
Theater:
When spoiled brat Harvey Cheyne
(Freddie Bartholomew) planks $50
on the desk of an instructor at his
exclusive Connecticut school to
bribe him to make the history ex a
pipe, he is expelled. When Harvey
pitches over the side of his tycoon
father's liner and is saved by a
Portuguese fisherman (Spencer
Tracy), he changes his tune, by oc
taves. "Captains Courageous" tug
the heart strings and jerk the lach
rymal glands to make for thorough
ly satisfying pathos in a thoroughly
implausible situation.

exclusive Connecticut school to
bribe him to make the history ex a
pipe, he is expelled. When Harvey
pitches over the side of his tycoon
father's liner and is saved by a
Portuguese fisherman (Spencer

the heart strings and jerk the lach

"SOUVENIR DE LA MALMAISON":
Dorothy Dow of Chicago hauled
off the Maxwell Anderson verse
drama purse for uncorking the par
lor and bedroom antics of Napoleon
and Josephine.
Saturday's reading of her "Sou
venir de la Malmaison" showed that
parlor and bedroom antics are still
as good a comedy situation as Noel
Coward thinks, that Miss Dow's
verse breezed along at proper com
edy clip, and that said antics were
linked into a neat plot. Only a little
matter of dialogue and acting can
explain why Dorothy Dow's really
topping idea shot its bolt in Satur
day's reading. For the former, it
can be said that the lines needed
sustaining come-back bounce. To
simplify the point still further, there
wasn't enough witty content in
them to last for all the words, and
not enough in the situation itself to
disguise that fact.
Furthermore, there can be no
doubt that J. Fenton McKenna, who
read Napoleon, pushes his voice from
the diaphragm in a way that should
awe all public speaking majors. And
his laugh booms forth from depths
unknown. But just why, in this en
lightened day and age, any actor
should plop himself into an over
stuffed, old-fashioned characteriza
tion is not quite clear. After all, it
is reasonable to suppose that even
Napoleon relaxed in his own bed
room.
Lucie Bentley's Josephine, on the
other hand, needed Lynn-Fontan
ning. Miss Bentley should have
caught up her lines, been little less
conscious of playing the great
"femme fatale," and lit her speeches
with that cozy glow that is switched
on only by spontaneity. Unfortu
nately missed were all Josephine's
royal opportunities for that sort of
"I - love-you-darling-but-there's-a
bee-crawling-up-your-neck" infor
mality. However, Robert Brauns as
Josephine's one-time flame (e pluri
bus unum), Myna Hughes, as her
jealous sister-in-law, and James
Sandoe and Sydney Head, in minor
roles, were excellent.
