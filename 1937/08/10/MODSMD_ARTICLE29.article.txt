Students able to turn in excep
tional time for the quarter-mile and
snatch a copy of the vanishing Daily
have noticed that most of Stan
ford's resources this summer are
devoted to making a hit with the
austere goddess of "culture." It ap
pears that the only activities which
can tear students away from watch
ing the birth-throes of the Cubber
ley Building are dramatics, art ap
preciation, and the movie series.
After toiling in low gear through
the detours of "background mate
rial" and "sociological aspects," it is
encouraging to see a direct approach
to aesthetics. A great many of the
courses which pad the time sched
ules of universities and high schools
exist only for their "cultural value,"
and yet most of these are as far re
moved from real culture as Toyon is
from the post office.

Education in the past has been sad
dled with the delusion that culture
is a variety of spots before the eyes
that will vanish if you look directly
at it. Coupled with this has been
the idea that anything "uplifting"
must be hard to take. And so, many
of our courses have become factual
blind alleys. We cram a list of the
kings of Judah and wonder how we
are going to work it into a conver
sation. We salt away the fact that
Holbein, not Holstein, painted pic
tures showing the effects of neo
something-or-other, but when we
see one of his works, we look blank.
The approach to culture through
actual observation of "cultural" ob

jects eliminates ths fumbling with
indigestible facts. After all, culture
is just so many useless wrinkles in
the cortex unless it gives the pos
sessor some pleasure. Sterile facts,
and assorted concepts are distinctly
inferior to Mae West as emotional
stimuli. The only way to get any
cultural benefit is to see real ob
jects of art and pick out what pleases
you.
This approach, simple as it is, has
been used only recently, and its
appearance indicates real progress in
education.
When the University installs a
course in art appreciaton, it indi
cates that it has abandoned the old
theory that culture can be seen only
out of the corner of the eye. And
when we make actual production of
dramatics one of the main features
of summer quarter, it shows that we
no longer regard art as an intangible
will-o'-the-wisp. Moreover, when
we admit the proletarian movie to
the realm of the blessed, we give
our aesthetic senses a footing in
practical application.
It is encouraging to watch the de
cline of the old cram-and-flounder
school of culture and to see that we
are being taught to know art rather
than to know about it. And it is
encouraging to see that the univer
sities are taking the lead in the use
of the new method.
