# Paly Subway Plans Affect School Land

Three hundred thousand dollars
from a fund allotted by the Federal
government to California for the
elimination of grade crossing will
finance an underpass at the Uni
versity avenue intersection if Stan
ford agrees to sell the land which
they own and which is necessary
for the project.
The money,"it was pointed out by
the office of the district engineer of
the State Highway Division will be
for construction alone. Acquisition
of the necessary property must be
taken care of by the sponsor.
Plan Given
The proposition is based on the
preliminary plan as worked out re
cently by the Southern Pacific Com
pany. An outlay of about $270,000
was figured for the underpass and
an additional $100,000 to be provided
by the railroad, for a new station.
The principal features of the proj
ect are:
1. Moving the tracks from 70 to 80
feet to the west of their present
position and elevating the rails
about 5 feet at the University Ave
nue intersection.
2. Constructing an underpass hav
ing four vehicular lanes, sidewalks,
and a bridge over Alma Street.
3. Building a new railroad station
approximately 100 feet west of the
present site and moving the freight
depot to the Palo Alto side of the
tracks.
No Hann
No damage to the private business
property on the Circle is involved.
The proposed underpass will con
sist of two 22-foot vehicular road
ways and a 16-foot sidewalk on the
north, or station, side, with an 8-
foot walk on the south side. The
ramp of the structure would start
at the north edge of the Circle and
run down on grades varying from
zero to a maximum of 8 per cent,
the two lines of traffic being sepa
rated in the barrel under the bridge,
and emerge to the surface at a point
about opposite the oil leasehold at
El Camino Real.
There would be roadway connec
tions between Alma Street and the
underpass as well as access to the
municipal corporation yard prop
erty.
