## 
### 
Presented in the original chamber orchestration, the second and final
concert of Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg Concertos was played
Friday afternoon at 3:20 o'clock in the Memorial Ilall. The concert, which
was a gift of the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation of the Library of
Congress, Washington, D.C., was broadcast over the NBC network.

Unique in being the first Ameri-'
can presentation of the concertos in
the original chamber form, the con
cert was under the musical direc
tion of Feri Roth, solo violinist, who
was assisted by the Roth Quartet —
E. Robert Schmitz, pianist, and
string players from San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and Denver.
Bach's concertos, which represent
his first attempts in the purely or
chestral form, serve to illustrate the
daring scientific spirit that charac
terized him as an artist. Concerto
No. 6, in B Flat major, for two
violas, violoncellos, double bass and
continuo, Concerto No. 4 in G
major, for violin, two flutes, with
string accompaniment and continuo,
and Concerto No. 2, in F major, for
trumpet, flute, oboe, violin, with
string accompaniment and continuo,
were played.
The music, sparklingly presented,
following the original text with ac
curacy, called forth the skill of the
artists, and again demonstrated that
the Memorial Hall makes a fine con
cert hall. This is the fifth consecu
tive summer that Stanford has bene
fitted by musical gifts from the Eliz
abeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation.
