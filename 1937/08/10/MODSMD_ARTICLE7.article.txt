# New Drama Plans Made
## 
### 
The decline and possibly the dis
solution of Stanford's student dra
matics council was foreshadowed
when the appointment of an advis
ory faculty committee to select fu
ture productions in Memorial Hall
was announced yesterday. Both the
financial responsibility and the choice
of plays will pass from hands of
the students to the faculty under the
new arrangement.
The committee, which will start to
function with the opening of fall
quarter, proceeded to name a play
for production some time in Novem
ber. It will consider contemporary
plays, revivals of old favorites,
classics, and translations of plays
from other nations.
According to Professor Lee Emer
son Bassett, head of the public
speaking department, the associated
students will probably continue their
presentation of the Big Game Gaie
ties in the fall, and the Barnstorm
ers in the spring and will be free to
use the theater for other shows.
