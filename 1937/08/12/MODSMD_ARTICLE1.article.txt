# Fall Quarter Registration May Increase
## Housing Arrangements Drafted for Entering Men, Women Students 
### 
Fall registration is expected to be
about the same or slightly greater
than last year, according to a state
ment made by Registrar J. P. Mitch
ell yesterday.
Although it is impossible to fore
tell the exact total enrollment,
Mitchell said that only the usual
quota of 450 new men and 250 new
women students will be admitted
into the Lower Division next quar
ter.
Number Limited
This summer quarter a limited
number of men and women with
Lower Division standing have been
offered the opportunity to secure ad
mission to the University as regular
students. Applicants who completed
all entrance requirements have been
admitted to summer quarter with the
understanding that not more than 50
men and 30 women, selected at the
end of the quarter, will be allowed
to continue as regular students in
the University this fall.
All of the men's dormitories have
waiting lists, according to Dean of
Men George B. Culver. The fourth
floor of Encina will not be opened
to Upper Division students, as was
the rule in the past, and there is a
waiting list of graduate students for
fifth floor rooms. As usual, a cer
tain percentage of rooms in Branner
and Toyon will be reserved for jun
ior transfers.
Reservations
Dean Culver wishes to call to the
attention of all junior transfers the
fact that if a room is saved for them,
they are expected to stay in the
room at least a quarter, as it is not
fair to the University for them to
stay only a few weeks and then
leave in order to join a fraternity.
No junior transfers who have 87 or
more quarter units will be required
to live in Encina.
All undergraduate women students
will be on the campus this fall, as
the Oaks will not be used as a dor
mitory. The new wings on Lagunita,
which will be finished by fall, are
expected to house all women who
might have had to live off-campus.
