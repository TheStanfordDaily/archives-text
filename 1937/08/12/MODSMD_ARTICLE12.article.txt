# J. F. McKenna To Be Featured In Belch Role
## Newcomer to Stanford Takes Low Comedy Role in Campus Play 
### 
Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek will be up to their famed
clowning again when J. Fenton Mc-
Kenna and George Z. Wilson team
in those roles for the summer fes
tival revival of "Twelfth Night,"
August 20 and 21, in Memorial Hall.
Baines Featured
The immortal ale-guzzling Sir
Toby and the skinny oldster, Sir
Andrew, supply the low comedy in
terest of the play, written in the
bard's second period and featuring
Amelia Baines, Joe Whitaker, Elise
Werthman, and James Bacigalupi in
leading roles of the Stanford pro
duction, which comes as a climax
of the summer drama season.
Comics Unimportant
Although the two comics are not
important to the plot of "Twelfth
Night," their capers run through
out a tale dealing with a ship
wrecked pair of twins and the mix
ups arising from mistaken identity.
Sir Toby is one of the few com
edy roles McKenna has played dur
ing a long dramatic career which
has included directorship in Santa
Clara University and participation
in several religious pageants. George
Wilson is known to Stanford audi
ences for many past performances,
in both comedy and straight por
trayals.
Clark as Malvolio
In addition to the low slapstick,
several other comic elements are
woven through "Twelfth Night."
Arthur Gelditzsch, as Feste, repre
sents the court fool. Fred Clark, as
Malvolio, typifies the humorless
poker-faced personality. The scrapes
arising from mistaken identity which
involve Amelia Baines as Viola, and
Joe Whitaker as her twin brother,
Sebastian, provide the high comedy
theme.
