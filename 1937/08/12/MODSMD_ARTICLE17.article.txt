# Professors' Book Shows Way to Better Reading
## 
### 
"The purpose of the book is to
make young people better readers by
giving them what they need," said
Holland D. Roberts, Stanford pro
fessor of education, in respect to
"Let's Read," the new reading book
which he and Helen Rand, profes
sor at Northwestern University,
have brought out this summer.
Photo Illustrations
The book, which is newly off the
press, is bound in an aluminum
cover, and filled with photo illustra
tions which accurately depict scenes
from the selections. Divided into
six sections, the book features ma
terials both informative and recrea
tional in type that will appeal to
young people.
The selections include animal
stories by Mrs. Martin Johnson, ac
tual experiences of Helen Hayes, ar
ticles from "Popular Mechanics" and
"Literary Digest," stories and com
ments by high school students, po
ems by Robert Frost and Carl Sand
burg, and informative articles about
moving pictures, radio, electricity,
airplanes, bridge building, and
sports.
Poorly Directed Reading
"There is ample historical evi
dence that reading directed solely
to individual pupil ends or for the
building or mechanical habits and
skills is not only superficial, evasive,
time serving, and reactionary, but
that it is a direct injury to the child
in society. Our schools have dem
onstrated that they can produce vast
numbers of readers who are me
chanically fluent and socially illit
erate," Roberts said.
Reading Taught Here
"At one time it was thought that
reading, one of the three R's, was
taught in grammar school, and that
finished the process," Roberts said.
"Now, for the past three years, we
have offered courses at Stanford in
how to read."
"To teach children the mechan
ics of reading without teaching them
what to read and how to evaluate
the contents of newspapers, maga
zines, and books is to aid in their
destruction and to place ourselves
at the disposal of the forces of re
action which are gathering now as
they did in 1775 and 1860," Roberts
pointed out.
