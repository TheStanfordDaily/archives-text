# 'Brain' Storm Sends Critic To Cyclone Cellar

### 
"THE ELMSWORTH BRAIN," by
Bud Cady, produced Tuesday in
the Little Theater:
And it came to pass that play
wright Bud Cady inscribeth (on the
blackboard in the rehearsal room):
"Shakespeare, phooey. I will write a
play that is funnier than "Twelfth
Night," more profound than "Ham
let." Look to thy laurels, O Ander
son! Here I go."
And on the first day he saith, "I
will have a brain—a large brain,
whole and complete." And, 10, there
stood Fred Clai'k, a large brain
whole and complete. And Cady
saith unto Clark, "Thou art the
'Elmsworth Brain'."
Cady Speaketh
And on the second day, he saith,
"I will have a girl who stands as
tride and swings a mean racket."
And 10, there stood Dorothy Brook
man, the girl who should stand legs
astride and swing a racket.
And on the third day, he saith:
"I will have an old hag with a bad
temper." And 10, there stood Jane
Clary, an old hag with a bad temper.
And on the fifth day it came to
pass that Cady rested from his la
bors, and the plot was never writ
ten. But the play was produced as
he had ordained. And it struck
lightnings that day and thundered
and Lange made markings in his
book and saith unto Cady, "Are you
taking this course for credit?"
Still Puzzled
Yea verily, it was a funny play.
Only one thing puzzles us still:
Elmsworth: "Have you eaten
breakfast yet?"
Brookman: "Yes, I just finished."
Elmsworth: "Well, I think I'll bung
along, then, and have a spot before
dinner."
The "Elmsworth Brain" was like a
dentist's promise—"lt hurts a little.
But it only lasts a minute."
