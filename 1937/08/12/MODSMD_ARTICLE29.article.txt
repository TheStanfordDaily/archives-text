As the last days of the eight weeks
session roll in out of space-time
substance, the teachers who have
been studying here prepare for an
other battle with the rising genera
tion. Opinions vary as to what pub
lic school instructors have learned
from their struggle with the theory
of education. Some report that the
only important thing is a degree
they can flash before the board of
education. But all of the teachers
have received one benefit from the
course, even if they have not re
duced child psychology to heel.
They have been given a vivid re
minder of the difference between the
students' and the teachers' point of
view.
After a few years of attempting to
make two ideas blossom in heads
where there is room for only one,
many instructors lose sympathy with
the students' attitude. They forget
that the taste for knowledge, like
the taste for olives or for surrealism,
is acquired, not innate. And they
are likely to rise in wrath to smite
the ungodly pupil who would rather
carry on a conversation than an
arithmetical remainder.

Eight weeks of student life should
remind the teachers that it is not a
capital offense to let sleep do its
knitting on the sleeve of care in the
classroom. And it should point out
to them that a pure heart and good
intentions are not reflected by quiz
averages.
Never having been a teacher, I
cannot answer for their reactions;
but we may assume from analogy
that their desires are the same as our
own. Surely then, every teacher
who has sat behind a pair of spread
eagle ears has longed to pull them.
And it is hard to believe that no in
structor has failed at times to con
sider his own conversation more en
tertaining than that of the lecturer.
Remembering this would take much
of the acid out of the teacher's Olym
pian wrath when one of his charges
I feels the same way about him.

If the teachers will only remem
ber their own experiences, they will
understand their students far better.
Instructors brood over the skeleton
of the Cubberley Building when they
have term papers due. Can they
blame the student whose theme is
late? And can the teacher who has
yawned the water louse through its
metamorphosis censure the pupil
who is not en rapport with the arth
ropoda?

After eight weeks as a student,
teachers should have a new under
standing and sympathy with their
students. And perhaps this under
standing will shed a little light into
student-faculty relations which are
so often battle-grounds where "blind
armies clash by night."
