# Imperialistic U.S. Attacked by Rippy
## 
### 
Attacking the platitudes that led
America into the Spanish-American
War, Dr. J. Fred Rippy, professor
of history at the University of Chi
cago, entertained an interested audi
ence in the Memorial Hall Little
Theater, with his talk on "Enthus
iasms of 1898" Tuesday night.
Quoting from speeches of legisla
tors and journalists of that period,
Dr. Rippy showed how America,
cloaked her imperialistic aspirations
with sophistries and catch-phrases.
