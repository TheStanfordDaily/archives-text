## 
### 
Although the male lead is still
uncast, many of the major roles of
Robert Sherwood's comedy, "Re
union in Vienna," set for reading
August 19, were assigned yesterday,
j according to Robert Brauns, direc
j tor.
Dr. Margery Bailey will play the
I gruff old harridan, Frau Lucher, and
j Dorothy Tully will appear as Sher
| wood's "cool, self-possessed" heroine,
j Elena. Tryouts for Rudolf, dashing
crown prince, and several minor
roles, have been called for Thursday
at 7:30 o'clock in the Quad little
I theater.
Present Cast
The cast, as it now stands, fea
| tures Thomas Seller as Anton Krug,
an internationally famed psychiat
| rist, who is forced to prescribe for
I his own wife, Elena; A. Grove Day,
j as Poffy, an old war-horse; Melba
: Toombes as a teary old member of
the ex-nobility; Lee Chapin, as
General Hoetzler, another titled ex;
and Phoebe Neubauer, as a bitter,
aristocratic former beauty.
"Reunion in Vienna,'' centering
around a meeting of the broken
down nobility of Austria in the
post-war years, had a long run on
Broadway and was made into a mo
tion picture several years ago. The
situation has been comically viewed
by the Broadway playwright, who
has reduced all his aristocratic char- i
acters to shabby second-rates.
Fontanne Role
Miss Tully, prominent member of
Masquers, will appear in the role
that brought acclaim to Lynn Fon
tanne and Ina Claire on the stage,
and Diana Wynyard on the screen.
Alfred Lunt, on Broadway, and John
Barrymore, in the film, starred as j
Rudolf.
Sherwo. d's play was picked to !
represent modern comedy in a series
of three plays read this summer,
chosen a typical of various periods.
The first belonged in the Tudor pe
riod and featured broad farce. The
second, "Sir Fopling Flutter; or The
Man of Mode," characterized the
Restoration comedy, and "Reunion
in Vienna" carries comedy types
through the twentieth century.
The reading forms part of the
Drama-Speech Conference, which,
with the production of "Twelfth
Night," climaxes the summer drama
festival.
