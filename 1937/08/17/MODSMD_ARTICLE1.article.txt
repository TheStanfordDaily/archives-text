# Final Dramas For Summer To Open Here
## 'Twelfth Night,' Shaw's 'Pygmalion' Mark End Of Summer Festival 
### 
All Palo Alto dramatic interests
will be pooled in the climax pro
ductions of the Stanford Summer
Drama Festival this week-end when
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," to
be presented Friday and Saturday in
Memorial Hall, runs simultaneously
with Shaw's "Pygmalion" at the
Palo Alto Community Theater.
"Pygmalion" was selected espe
cially as a modern contrast in high
comedy to the Elizabethan version
represented in "Twelfth Night."
Dealing with a phonetician who
coaches a cockney girl into a duch
ess, the Shaw piece is a take-off on
the classic legend of a sculptor who
modeled a perfect woman and asked
Venus to breathe life into the statue.
Jeanette Rosenfeld plays the lead.
Amelia Baines will be seen as
Viola, the key figure, whose adven
tures masquerading as page boy to
a Duke, provides the core of Shake
speare's famed play.
Dr. Margery Bailey, supervisor of
the Stanford Festival, and Ralph
Emerson Welles, director of the Palo
Alto Community Theater, are head
ing the respective productions. Hu
bert Heffner is directing "Twelfth
Night" and Hall Martin, former
Stanfordite, stands at the helm of
the Community Theater venture.
Enrollment in the two-day speech
drama conclave next Friday and
Saturday entitles participants to ad
mission to both plays.
