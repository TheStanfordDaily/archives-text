# Chapin to Leave For Scotland
## 
### 
Because of the Sino-Japanese con
flict Lee Chapin, Stanford debate
coach, has altered his original plan
of reaching Edinburgh, Scotland, by
way of the Orient and is to sail from
New York, September 17, on the
Franconia.
Chapin, on sabbatical leave from
Stanford, will continue his studies at
the University of Edinburgh, where
he is working for his doctor's degree.
Research work into the backgrounds
of American history, politics and
law will form the major portion of
his labors this year. He plans to re
main in Scotland for 13 months and
will return across Siberia, Japan,
and the Pacific to San Francisco
some time next summer.
"A teacher has more to offer his
students," Chapin said, "if he can
augment his reading and library re
search work with travel and contact
with the people of other countries."
A member of the debating society
at the University of Edinburgh,
Chapin organized the trans-Atlantic
radio debate between Edinburgh and
Stanford which occurred in June.
He plans to bring the Edinburgh
debate team to America next year,
if details can be successfully worked
out.
