the Soul," directed by Arthur Gled

The first deals with two proud
aristocrats facing the guillotine,
and features Jack Dawson and Syl
iva Onesti in leading roles.
"Corridors of the Soul" has been
translated from the Russian and re
veals the drama within the individ
ual soul. The idea has been orig
inally adapted and interpreted by
Giffen for Saturday's production and
features Fred Clark, Fred Geare,
George Wilson and Bud Cady as the
complex elements of one man.
