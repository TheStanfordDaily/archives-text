# Amphitheatre To Be Court Dance Scene
## 
### 
Only event of the summer sched
uled for the Frost Amphitheater
will be held this Saturday afternoon
in the form of a group of Elizabethan
court and country dances.
Directed by 'Mrs. Ruth Radir and
Miss Harriet Ann Trinkle, these
dances will give delegates to the
Speech and Drama Conference a
chance to see the outdoor theater.
Informal Gathering
The festivities will be very in
formal in nature and spectators are
to group themselves on the grass or
bring their own stools or blankets.
The performances are to be pre
sented on the intimate stage to the
right of the main stage. The dances
will be divided into three groups,
country dances, competitive dances
and court dances.
In the first group will be exhib
ited social dances for men and wom
en, typical of the jolly summer eve
nings on Elizabethan greens. In
cluded are "Black Nag," "Rufty
Tufty," "If All the World Were
Paper," and "Gathering Peascods."
Men To Perform
Only men will perform in the sec
ond part, which will be a competi
tion in the sword, stick, and morris
dances. Precision, form, and height
of leap are to determine the win
ners.
Scene of the originals, of which
the third group is a copy, was the
Elizabethan court. Unlike the other
two groups which will be performed
informally in modified modern dress,
the court dancers will be clothed in
satins and velvets of the period.
Music will be provided by four
flutes and a drum. There will be no
admission charge.
