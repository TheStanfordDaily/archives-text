### 
Stanford was connected with the
Chinese-Japanese war zone last
Saturday when Ellen "Luigi"
Schmid, a senior student here,
barely escaped serious injury or
death in the bombing of Shanghai's
International Settlement.
The bombing, which killed sev
eral Americans, including Hubert S.
"Syl" Honigsberg of San Francisco,
was witnessed by Miss Schmid from
the roof of the Cathay Hotel, next
to the Whangpoo River, where Japa
nese warships lay at anchor.
According to Miss Schmid, three
Chinese bombers flew over the war
ships which opened fire on them.
The planes then dropped bombs
which went wide of their mark and
landed in the street between the
Cathay and Palace Hotels, killing
and wounding hundreds.
Miss Schmid, who was visiting
her parents in Shanghai at the time
the hostilities started, has been
prominent in campus activities dur
ing her three years at Stanford. She
was a member of the Stanford Wom
en's Conference last year and was
on the tennis and basketball teams.
She lived in Lagunita Court.
William C. King, Palo Alto drug
gist, expressed concern over the
safety of his mother and daughter,
medical missionaries, who are in
the danger zone.
