# Water Polo Team Seeks Championship
## Coach Thornton Expects 23rd Coast Conference Win Within 25 Years 
### 
Stanford water polo teams have
won the Pacific Coast Conference
title 22 times in the past 24 years,
and now this year Coach Nort Thorn
ton predicts the Indians will have
one of the greatest squads of all
time.
It was in 1932 when U.S.C. walked
off with the crown and again in
1935 when the U.C.L.A. Bruins
splashed enough water and ducked
too many Cards to permit Thornton's
boys to make the string of victories
consecutive.
Forward Wall Strong
"This year's team," says Nort,
"will be potentially a strong outfit
because of the power and experience
we can display with our forward wall
composed of Captain Bill Hanna and
John Lamb, both all-Coast last year,
and Bob Plate up from last year's
frosh team. All these men need is
sterling support from the guards and
we will be off on our power jaunt
to another Coast crown."
At guards Thornton has tenta
tively listed Dick Hoover, from the
Class of '40, Dick Clark, Bob Allen,
and Jack Vibert, all members of last
year's squad.
Goalie Spot Open
The goalie position seems wide
open with Cameron Hall, Bill Burns,
Hank Aldrich, Lloyd Wilson, and
Frank Downing aiming for the one
assignment.
Thornton figures his second string
set of forwards—Bill Bleecker, Jack
Wilson, and Jack Read — will be
worked next in anticipation of their
becoming regulars in 1938 after the
graduation of Lamb and Captain
Hanna.
Competition Stiff
"Our stiffest competition," said
Thornton, "will be from U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. The Trojans have decided
it is high time to begin to do some
thing about the water polo situation,
and they have secured the services
of Ed Bittke, a former S.C. star. In
fact, he was on the S.C. swimming
team the same time I competed for
Stanford. Bittke is really a student
of the game and will put forth strong
water polo teams from S.C. in the
future."
"However, California must always
be reckoned with, as A1 Dowden, the
Cal Coach, has a definite way to
develop great teams."

Stanford water polo teams have
won the Pacific Coast Conference
title 22 times in the past 24 years,
and now this year Coach Nort Thorn
ton predicts the Indians will have
one of the greatest squads of all
time.
It was in 1932 when U.S.C. walked
off with the crown and again in
1935 when the U.C.L.A. Bruins
splashed enough water and ducked
too many Cards to permit Thornton's
boys to make the string of victories
consecutive.
Forward Wall Strong
"This year's team," says Nort,
"will be potentially a strong outfit
because of the power and experience
we can display with our forward wall
composed of Captain Bill Hanna and
John Lamb, both all-Coast last year,
and Bob Plate up from last year's
frosh team. All these men need is
sterling support from the guards and
we will be off on our power jaunt
to another Coast crown."
At guards Thornton has tenta
tively listed Dick Hoover, from the
Class of '40, Dick Clark, Bob Allen,
and Jack Vibert, all members of last
year's squad.
Goalie Spot Open
The goalie position seems wide
open with Cameron Hall, Bill Burns,
Hank Aldrich, Lloyd Wilson, and
Frank Downing aiming for the one
assignment.
Thornton figures his second string
set of forwards—Bill Bleecker, Jack
Wilson, and Jack Read — will be
worked next in anticipation of their
becoming regulars in 1938 after the
graduation of Lamb and Captain
Hanna.
Competition Stiff
"Our stiffest competition," said
Thornton, "will be from U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. The Trojans have decided
it is high time to begin to do some
thing about the water polo situation,
and they have secured the services
of Ed Bittke, a former S.C. star. In
fact, he was on the S.C. swimming
team the same time I competed for
Stanford. Bittke is really a student
of the game and will put forth strong
water polo teams from S.C. in the
future."
"However, California must always
be reckoned with, as A1 Dowden, the
Cal Coach, has a definite way to
develop great teams."
