# Clary Lauded For Clear Cut Performance
## 
### 
Between the main production of
the summer and the fag end of a
season's readings, "The Bucca
neer" Saturday was a tasty slab
of comedy.
Just how good Fred Clark can
be in a hairy chested role was shown
by his portrayal of swashbuckling
Sir Henry Morgan. Clark slashed
his way through the part with a
minimum of hammy bluster with
which such a character tempts the
amateur, and with a maximum of
fresh vigor. If not inspired enough
to carry off a Van Dorn, Clark is
technically smooth enough to be
more than adequate in a role that
does not call for inspiration. And
the Buccaneer does not.
Clary Clear-cut
Jane Clary's high-spirited Donna
Lisa was hard as diamond dust, and
just as sparkling. Miss Clary cuts
her characterizations clearer than
any actress on the campus. No pow
der sugar heroine, Miss Clary, un
like most college actresses, is up to
the more interesting feminine types.
However, with all hands on the
table, it was Joe Lawry who crawled
away with the show. His King
Charles II was the best Fx*ank Mor
ganing and the most expressive piece
of comedy to date. George Z. Wil
son, as sputtering Esmeraldo, also
ranked in honors. And both Dorothy
Brookman and Sylvia Onesti rate
honorable mention for two Spanish
girls of the play.
Not Well-oiled
But above and beyond the fact
that the lights blew during the cli
max, "The Buccaneer" was in no
way a well-oiled production. Indi
vidual performances stuck out like
signs on undeveloped suburban lots.
The whole thing lacked co-ordina
tion.
For the play itself, it can be said
that "The Buccaneer" was neither
as significant nor as artistic as "High
Tor." But this very early Anderson
piece suggests that Broadway lost a
good dramatist when that play
wright turned poet.
