To those of us who have periled
our lives, our fortunes, and the re
spect of our younger brothers by
maintaining that the college stu
dent is a human being, the Stanford
summer session is an antidote for
wavering faith. The flood of litera
ture about "college" life has
reached such proportions that there
are moments when every undergrad
uate feels that he is about to go
down for the third time. Like the
philosopher who dreamed so viv
idly he was a butterfly that he
couldn't decide which he was
when he awoke, the student often
wonders whether he is a student
dreaming he's a or a
play-boy dreaming he's a student.
Men whose mental machinery has
slowly gone off its rocker can prob
ably appreciate the feeling of the
student as he sees the world mak
ing an idiot out of him by sheer
pressure of opinion. Ivied walls be
gin to look vacant without a pas
sionate clinch proceeding beneath
them. Hip pockets appear useless
without a flask. To such incipi
ent madness, the sanity of the sum
mer quarter offers a welcome con
tradiction.

Editors of magazines about col
leges would break into tears at the
sight of Stanford in the summer.
Not once have we ridden forth to
storm the dormitories of neighbor
ing universities. No professor has
come to class wtih lipstick on his
collar; no student has dropped a

bottle of scotch in the lecture room.
It is possible to traverse the Quad
wihtout finding the way blocked by
lovers.
The battered jeans of the under
graduates fit smoothly, with no
double bottom for flasks. And the
attire favored by the co-eds makes
any such concealment impossible.
When we present a play, the
campus is not overrun with skirtless
chorines who alternate dance num
bers with fervid investigation of
extra-curricular genetics. Instead
(shades of MGM) we put on a drama
by Shakespeare, an author known
to the movie and magazine world
only since his recent discovery by
Hollywood.
It is reported that books are ac
tually taken out of the library, and
that students have been seen study
ing. And we have it on excellent
authority that the punch at the
dean's reception was not spiked.
And so when it appears that the
world of fiction knows more about
the undergraduate than the under
graduate does, we can turn to the
summer session to prove that col
lege students are not only human,
but also reasonably sane.

authority that the punch at the
dean's reception was not spiked.
And so when it appears that the
world of fiction knows more about
the undergraduate than the under
graduate does, we can turn to the
summer session to prove that col
lege students are not only human,
but also reasonably sane.

To those of us who have periled
our lives, our fortunes, and the re
spect of our younger brothers by
maintaining that the college stu
dent is a human being, the Stanford
summer session is an antidote for
wavering faith. The flood of litera
ture about "college" life has
reached such proportions that there
are moments when every undergrad
uate feels that he is about to go
down for the third time. Like the
philosopher who dreamed so viv
idly he was a butterfly that he
couldn't decide which he was
when he awoke, the student often
wonders whether he is a student
dreaming he's a or a
play-boy dreaming he's a student.
Men whose mental machinery has
slowly gone off its rocker can prob
ably appreciate the feeling of the
student as he sees the world mak
ing an idiot out of him by sheer
pressure of opinion. Ivied walls be
gin to look vacant without a pas
sionate clinch proceeding beneath
them. Hip pockets appear useless
without a flask. To such incipi
ent madness, the sanity of the sum
mer quarter offers a welcome con
tradiction.

Editors of magazines about col
leges would break into tears at the
sight of Stanford in the summer.
Not once have we ridden forth to
storm the dormitories of neighbor
ing universities. No professor has
come to class wtih lipstick on his
collar; no student has dropped a

bottle of scotch in the lecture room.
It is possible to traverse the Quad
wihtout finding the way blocked by
lovers.
The battered jeans of the under
graduates fit smoothly, with no
double bottom for flasks. And the
attire favored by the co-eds makes
any such concealment impossible.
When we present a play, the
campus is not overrun with skirtless
chorines who alternate dance num
bers with fervid investigation of
extra-curricular genetics. Instead
(shades of MGM) we put on a drama
by Shakespeare, an author known
to the movie and magazine world
only since his recent discovery by
Hollywood.
It is reported that books are ac
tually taken out of the library, and
that students have been seen study
