# Plans Announced For 1937-38 NYA
## 
### 
NYA for 1937-38 is expected to be
on the same basis as it was last
year, according to L. L. Yancey of
the accounting department, pay
master for the NYA. Although as
yet there has been no official con
firmation that the necessary funds
will be provided by the Relief Ad
ministration, it is assumed that word
will be received early in Septem
ber.
Last year the total amount paid
out to Stanford students by the NYA
was $73,873.75. The average month
ly wage of undergraduates was $15,
wtih a $20 maximum. Graduate stu
dents received the average sum of
$25 a month, with a maximum of
$40. During May, a representative
month, 367 undergraduates and 148
graduates were on the NYA rolls.
As far as is known, Mr. Yancey said,
the same system will go into effect
when the University opens in the
fall.
