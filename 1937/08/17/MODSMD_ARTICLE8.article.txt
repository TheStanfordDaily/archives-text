# Noted Quartet Will Present Concert Today
## Classical, Modernistic Program To Be Given For Memorial Theater 
### 
Combining selections from both
the classics and the moderns, the
Kolisch Quartet will present the sec
ond concert of its series here at 3:30
o'clock this afternoon in Memorial
Hall.
A modernistic touch will be heard
in the playing of Berg's "Lyric
Suite." Mozart's "Quartet in D
Minor, K. V. No. 421" and Beet
hoven's "Quartet in E Minor, Opus
59, No. 2" will round out the pro
gram.
Mozart Quartet
The Mozart Quartet has four
movements, allegro moderato, an
dante, menuetto allegretto and alle
gretto, ma non troppo. It contains
many romantic features which
were revolutionary at its writing in
1773, among them a trio similar to
a folk song which strikes a solitary
note of gaiety in contrast to its pes
simistic main section.
The lyric-dramatic character of
the six movements of the Berg Suite,
with its alternating fast and slow
movements, contrasts strongly with
the two older string quartets on the
program.
Beethoven Quartet
The Beethoven Quartet is in four
movements, predominantly in the
Sonata form. The third movement,
a scherzo, is famous for its use of
a Russian fold theme, used 70 years
later by Moussorgsky in the Coro
nation scene of his opera, "Boris
Godounoff."
The concluding program of the
series will be given at the same
time Friday afternoon, and will in
clude quartets by Mozart, Bartok
and Beethoven.
Series Begun Friday
The series opened with a concert
last Friday, featuring selections from
Schoenberg, Haydn and Beethoven.
The Kolisch Quartet, hailed as the
finest ensemble of its kind in Eu
rope, is one of the few musical
groups to play its concerts entirely
from memory.
