Use Deep Colors
Besides actually grooming the
play, three months have been spent
in research and construction on cos
tumes and sets. Waldemar Johan
sen, technical director, and Helen
Green, costuming designer, have su
pervised corps of students in the
work of executing designs, which
have been planned to carry out the
imaginative spirit of the play, and
not to conform with any definite
period. Costume materials have
been dyed in deep rich colors to har
monize with sets in the ornate Ital
ian Renaissance style.
Assisting in Production
J. P. Cahn and Phil Brown head
a technical stage crew consisting of
30, and including four scene shift
ers, two prop groups, and one light
crew. There are six scenes, each
twenty-eight feet high, comprising
the Duke's Palace, the seacoast of
Illyria, Olivia's court, a street scene,
a kitchen scene, and Olivia's garden.
Employing a method whereby each
prop may serve in more than one
scene, there are 18 shifts.
