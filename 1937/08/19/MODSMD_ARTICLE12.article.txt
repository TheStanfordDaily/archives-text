# Final Kolisch Concert Set For Tomorrow
## Selections from Mozart, Beethoven To Be Given In Last Performance 
### 
Final concert in a three-perform
ance series here will be presented
by the Kolisch Quartet at 3:30
o'clock tomorrow in Memorial Hall.
Selections from Mozart and Beet
hoven will constitute the major part
of the program, with the modern
school being represented by a quar
tet from Bartok. The program will
consist of Quartet, D major, K.V.
No. 575 (Mozart), Quartet No. 5, B
flat (Bartok), and Quartet, M major,
Opus 59, No. 1 (Beethoven).
The Mozart quartet has four move
ments, Allegretto, Andante, Men
uetto and Rondo. First of three
quartets written by Mozart for
Frederick William 11, King of Prus
sia, the work is noted for its featur
ing of the cello.
The Bartok selection is written in
five movements, Allegro, Adagio
molto, Scherzo, alia bulgarese
(Vivace), Andante and Finale (Al
legro vivace). The composer's early
study of the folk music of Central
Europe shows its influence in the
intensely emotional, rhythmic char
acter of the work and its relatively
primitive materials.
The Beethoven quartet has four
movements, Allegro, Allegretto vi
vace e sempre scherzando, Adagio
molto e mesto and Russian theme;
allegro. First of the three Rasou
morsky Quartets, this selection is
probably the most popular of the
group, with its steadily ascending
theme reaching a climax in the
Finale's Russian motif, so sugges
tive of the peasant dance.
