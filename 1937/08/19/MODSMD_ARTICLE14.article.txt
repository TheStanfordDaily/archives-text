Instead of heroes in Stanford's
battle with the underworld, John
"Watso" Matties and Henry "Hawk
shaw" Rodda today found them
selves a neat hoax.
The ignominy of their position be
came clear to them when phony
deputization papers and shiny Jun
ior G-Man badges arrived in yes
terday's mail. Enervated by in
tensive sleuthing, Matties and Rod
da, from their perches on a "well
sawed limb," protested that they
knew it all along.
The story behind the "Case of the
Dangling Rope" is roughly this:
Ced Porter, an SAE with time on
his hands, after toying with 50 feet
of heavy rope for an hour or so,
suddenly ran upstairs and dangled it
in front of Matties' window.
Rodda, evidently possessed of a
latent Dick Tracy complex, sprang
to the floor below the window, his
agile imagination picturing a swart,
squat thief sliding down the rope,
knife in teeth, to enter the room.
Securing the rope to a piece of
furniture, Rodda and Matties rushed
to the room above. Rodda forced
the door, whipped around the cor
ner, back to the wall, and flashed his
light about the room.
Evidently relieved at finding noth
ing, Rodda and Matties set off down
the row to warn other houses and
police. Returning, they found that
the thief had paid another visit and

were told that the safe had been
robbed of some $200. Another search
under the leadership of Rodda and
Matties disclosed nothing, although
Rodda thought for a while that he
had found a "hot car" in the SAE
driveway.
Still another assault was made,
again on the super-sleuths' room,
before things settled down for the
night. This time the "burglar" left
a knife deeply imbedded in the door
jamb, conjuring up wild, phantas
magoric flights of conjecture on
Rodda's part. By this time he was
able to describe the thiefs habits,
clothes, and thoughts, not to men
tion his being a fraternity man who
had flunked out of college.
The conspirators, bored with their
escapade, went to bed. Matties, how
ever, armed with a baseball bat and
a three-cell flashlight, .remained on
guard in his room ali night, pro
tecting his "valuables."

squat thief sliding down the rope,
knife in teeth, to enter the room.

furniture, Rodda and Matties rushed

Instead of heroes in Stanford's
