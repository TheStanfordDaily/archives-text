# Farm Football Hopes Depend on Lettermen
## 
### HILMER LODGE 
Stanford's success on the gridiron
this fall depends materially on the
work of four returning lettermen—
Pete Zagar, left tackle, Jack Clark,
right end, Bill Paulman, fullback,
and Jimmy Coffis at left halfback.
Any one of these four have ex
cellent chances of receiving Ail-
American recognition if they pick
up where they left off last season
and, in the case of Bill Paulman,
continue the phenomenal playing
displayed in the 1936 S.M.U.-Stan
ford Rose Bowl game. A broken
ankle sustained in last season's
opening scrimmage robbed Bill of a
chance to see action during the sea
son. Spring practice proved to Tiny
Thornhill that these boys will be bat
tling all the way.
Clark To Star
Clark's spring practice perform
ances definitely labeled him as a
potentially great end, and, if his
playing this year bears out this pre
diction, he may be ranked along
with other great Stanford ends of
the past—Jim Lawson, Monk Mos
crip, Ted Shipkey, Mush Muller, and
Keith Topping.
Pete Zagar did not report for
spring practice as Dink Templeton
was guiding him toward the Na
tional Intercollegiate discus throw
ing crown. But Zagar, during his
spare moments, was learning Thorn
hill's new plays and has been work
ing this summer on a dude ranch in
Arizona, getting him in good shape
for the coming grid campaign.
Coffis at Safety
Smiling Jimmy Coffis will prob
ably be the ace safety man of the
coast before this season is out. Jim
consistently returned the opposi
tion's punts from 20 to 30 yards on
almost every runback last year. His
ball-carrying ability, exemplified by
his great broken field running and
his off tackle dashes, may prove the
making or breaking of the Stanford
offensive, which depends on Tiny
Thornhill's finding a first class
blocker to hold down the right half
back position.
Bill Paulman is the man of two
positions. He can play either quar
terback or fullback. Just where he
plays depends entirely upon the
strength of the material giving him
opposition for either of these posi
tions. If the strongest man is found
to be Jim Groves at the fullback
spot, undoubtedly Paulman will play
quarterback, as it wouldn't pay to
sacrifice a man of Groves' ability
simply to keep Paulman at fullback.
Paulman Promising
Paulman's main forte his sopho
more year was his kicking and pass
ing. This past spring practice dem
onstrated to Coach Thornhill that
"Bashful" Bill was the hardest run
ning and driving back on the squad
and was really capable of lugging
the old porkhide.
Most of the gridders will be ar
riving on the campus about Septem
ber 7. On the Bth and 9th physical
examinations will be made, and
suits will be issued. On September
10 the eventful day of the first prac
tice will arrive. Thornhill expects
about 75 men to report for the var
sity squad, and Harry Shipkey, head
freshman mentor, anticipates ap
proximately 90 for the Class of
1941 squad.
