# Critic Reviews Farm Summer Drama Season
## 
### 
End of Summer: With "Twelfth
Night" holding it up in the mid
dle, the season's drama was split
like a culotte.
Talent and gate receipts jingle
about equally in both pockets. There
the likeness ends. One faction is
known as the intelligensia, or, in the
language of the streets, the unpos
sessed. And this takes in Robert
Brauns, Sydney Head, James San
doe, Myna Hughes, Dorothy Tully,
and surrounding territory. Which
leaves Clark, Cady, Clary, Dawson,
and Lawry in the other.
Tryouts for the first meant diving
for old bawl-outs, the nearest
phone, and any available Ph.D.'s.
For the second, everything was
much simpler, involving only hang
ing around the new theater until
class let out and assigning parts en
route to Beltramo's. This is not ex
actly a scare-head expose. Just a
difference in method, indicative of
the spirit behind the two.
In selection of plays, the Brauns
faction went back as far as the Tu
dor period, and plunged into the
seventeenth century after "Sir Fop
ling Flutter." Theater history for
the other began with Balaban and
Katz.
Where relative merit is concerned,
each has much to recommend it.
Myna Hughes plays the same part in
every play. But she does it ably.
Robert Brauns, Dr. Willy Nilly was
one of the most natural and refresh
ing performances seen at Stanford.
James Sandoe, who just crawled un
der the wire, has a voice like Mau
rice Evans and versatility like a
chameleon. In rehearsal, his Papa
Krug of "Reunion in Vienna" is ut
terly disarming. On the other hand,
Jane Clary was a little too worldly
for Lise in "High Tor." But clever
skillful reading, coupled with a rare
zest and spirit, should shoot her to
the top next quarter.
Look for Sylvia Onesti from this
bunch next year, too. Clark proved
himself a level-headed performer,
nothing less. Jack Dawson's only
real chance came with "Journey's
End" at the Palo Alto Theater. His
performance there suggests some
ability, but limited scope.
All considered, the first group is
more seasoned, more learned. Their
chief pit-fall, in fact, lies in a tend
ency toward scholarliness. The
other has more glamour perhaps.
They wear more tasty formals. They
have more showmanship. But their
productions were inferior in groom
ing and grounding.
