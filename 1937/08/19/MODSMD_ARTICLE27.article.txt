### L' ENVOI 
As this last issue of the Sum
mer Daily goes to press without
screaming headlines, and with no
investigation into genetics or the
chemistry of alcohol, some of the
more restless undergraduates re
ceive a disappointment. "My God,"
they say, "you haven't printed a bit
of news all quarter."
* * »
It is very sad that such spirited
souls should be weaned of their diet
of sensation. But the Daily has been
a reflection of the summer quarter,
and the absence of streamer heads
shows that the session has run
smoothly. News may be defined as
something that should not have
, happened. And nothing has hap
pened at Stanford that was not in
the time schedule and the weekly
calendar. Dogs have dozed peace
fully on the English Corner, and no
man has snapped at them. Men's
Council has drowsed in its chairs,
having found "certain students" al
most an extinct species.

And although the Daily has made
no bid for the tabloid trade, it has
had its own triumphs. We have not
been forced to pan Ex Committee.
Not once have we had to face the
outraged virtue of Woman's Coun
cil which so often mars the beauty
of its collective brow with an Olym
pian frown, and comments, "We
are not amused."
After such idyllic peace, the ap

proaching turmoil of the regular ses
sion loses some of its fascination.
Many of us feel like Fiji Islanders
on the arrival of the first mission
aries, bringing civilization's gifts,
war, chewing gum, Mother Hub
bards, and stand-up collars. We re
alize that doubtless the new order is
good, and that we will enjoy it no
end; but we like the way things are
done now.

It is not that the regular session
lacks charm. As any "old grad"
will tell you after two drinks, col
lege life cannot be described by all
the superlatives in the language.
And most of us will agree. But the
quiet peace and smoothness of sum
mer gains by contrast with the
lather we work up in the winter.
And so when we are tearing our
hair over student government, stu
dent activities, and student Bawl
out averages, we can remember the
summer session as a golden age.
