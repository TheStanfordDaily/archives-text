# Angus Named To Commission
## Acting Professor To Aid In Canadian Study 
### 
Henry Forbes Angus, acting pro
fessor of economics and political
science at Stanford for the summer,
has been appointed as a member of
the Royal Commission on Dominion
Provincial Relations which is being
formed in Canada to examine the
financial relations of the provinces
and the Dominion government.
Dr. Angus, who is visiting here
from the University of British Co
lumbia, will be one of five members
of the commission, which will have
the Hon. Newton Rowell, chief jus
tice of Ontario, as its chairman. The
members have been picked so that
there will be one from each of the
five main geographical divisions of
the country.
The purpose of this newly ap
pointed commission is to straighten
out the complicated financial rela
tions between the Dominion govern
ment and the provinces. The heavy
expenditures of the World War pe
riod compelled the Dominion to in
vade fields of taxation which the
provinces had thought of as theirs.
Some provinces have experienced
difficulty in meeting the interest on
public debts, and the depression, the
rising costs of social services, and
the losses incidental to crop fail
ures have forced them to seek aid
from the Dominion. The result has
been continual bargaining between
provincial and Dominion govern
ments, and with the appointment of
the Commission, it is now hoped to
reach a permanent settlement which
may necessitate changes in the Do
minion's constitution.
