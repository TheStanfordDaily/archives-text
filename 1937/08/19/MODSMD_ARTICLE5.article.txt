# Director Calls Summer Session Work Profitable
## 
### 
"This summer has been unusually
interesting and profitable," was the
announcement made yesterday by
the office of the director of the sum
mer session.
Visiting faculty this year repre
sented 14 universities of the United
States, Canada, and Europe. It was
further stated that eight professors,
already appointed for summer quar
ter, 1938, will come from the uni
versities of Brussels, Madrid, Co
lumbia, North Carolina, Wisconsin,
Duke, Michigan, and Chicago.
Attendance for the quarter reached
877, not counting special students
who would bring the total to 989, or
15 per cent over last year. There
was also a considerable gain over
previous years of lower division
students. Memorial Hall, it was
stated, was perhaps the center of
summer activities, for with the
marked registration and the record
number of conferences it was used
to the best possible advantage.
Worth-while Programs
"Anybody so inclined," Eliot
Mears, director of the summer quar
ter stated, "could attend a worth

while program every night in the
week, this summer. While the num
ber of student activities does not
compare with other quarters, stu
dent life has been active and grati
fying."
Through the generosity of Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, a pro
gram of concerts was presented—the
first musicales to be heard in Me
morial Hall. The Roth Quartet and
String Ensemble gave in two con
certs the first American perform
ance in the original chamber music
form of the entire series of Bach
Brandenburg Concertos.
Other Programs
Other opportunities to attend mu
sical programs were offered in the
series of four music hours on court
music of the middle ages and the
Renaissance, given as part of the
drama festival, and a Tuesday eve
ning program of Russian music,
held in the court of the Stanford
Union. There were' also the usual
organ recitals given by Warren D.
Allen, University organist, on Sun
day evenings and Thursday after
noons in the Memorial Church, and
the usual program of recorded music
Wednesday afternoons.
More conferences were held at
Stanford this summer than ever be
fore, bringing to the campus men
eminent in their fields as leaders and
many visiting delegates. In July was
the Education Confernece on Mental
and Physical Health, the conference
for Junior Business Executives un
der the auspices of the Graduate
School of Business, and the West
ern Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives. The first week in
August saw Stanford the host to
the Japan-America Student Confer
ence. This week a Conference in
Speech and Drama is meeting, to tie
in with the Stage Classics Produc
tion course.

announcement made yesterday by
the office of the director of the sum
mer session.
Visiting faculty this year repre
sented 14 universities of the United
States, Canada, and Europe. It was
further stated that eight professors,
already appointed for summer quar
ter, 1938, will come from the uni
versities of Brussels, Madrid, Co
lumbia, North Carolina, Wisconsin,
Duke, Michigan, and Chicago.
Attendance for the quarter reached
877, not counting special students
who would bring the total to 989, or
15 per cent over last year. There
was also a considerable gain over
previous years of lower division
students. Memorial Hall, it was
stated, was perhaps the center of
summer activities, for with the
marked registration and the record
number of conferences it was used
to the best possible advantage.
Worth-while Programs
"Anybody so inclined," Eliot
Mears, director of the summer quar
ter stated, "could attend a worth

while program every night in the
week, this summer. While the num
ber of student activities does not
compare with other quarters, stu
dent life has been active and grati
fying."
Through the generosity of Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, a pro
gram of concerts was presented—the
first musicales to be heard in Me
morial Hall. The Roth Quartet and
String Ensemble gave in two con
certs the first American perform
ance in the original chamber music
form of the entire series of Bach
Brandenburg Concertos.
Other Programs
Other opportunities to attend mu
sical programs were offered in the
series of four music hours on court
music of the middle ages and the
Renaissance, given as part of the
drama festival, and a Tuesday eve
ning program of Russian music,
held in the court of the Stanford
Union. There were' also the usual
organ recitals given by Warren D.
Allen, University organist, on Sun
day evenings and Thursday after
noons in the Memorial Church, and
the usual program of recorded music
Wednesday afternoons.
More conferences were held at
Stanford this summer than ever be
fore, bringing to the campus men
eminent in their fields as leaders and
many visiting delegates. In July was
the Education Confernece on Mental
and Physical Health, the conference
for Junior Business Executives un
der the auspices of the Graduate
School of Business, and the West
ern Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives. The first week in
August saw Stanford the host to
the Japan-America Student Confer
ence. This week a Conference in
Speech and Drama is meeting, to tie
in with the Stage Classics Produc
tion course.
"This summer has been unusually
interesting and profitable," was the
