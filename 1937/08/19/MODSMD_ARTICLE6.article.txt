# 'Twelfth Night' will Terminate Summer Drama Festival Here
## Bard's Comedy Directed To Suit Modern Group Says Drama Director 
### 
After delving into prompt books
from several nationally known
Shakespearean sources and gather
ing notes on productions given from
the eighteenth century on, the in
formation gained was used in mak
ing "Twelfth Night" pleasing to the
modern audience, Hubert Heffner
said yesterday.
"We have attempted to avoid the
antiquarian scholar's viewpoint, be
cause we don't believe in reviving
Shakespeare for purely historical
interest," the director commented in
enumerating the factors which have
figured in the Stanford production of
the classic comedy which will be
presented in Memorial Hall Friday
and Saturday nights.
Modernization Avoided
"Then, again," he continued, "we
have dodged the so-called modern
izing of Shakespeare in which the
director cuts speeches and rewrites
to reshape the play along modern
lines. Terming "Twelfth Night" one
of the bard's "most genial and de
lightful pieces," Heffner, who has
headed at various times four Uni
versity productions of the play,
pointed out how he modified the
many interpretations he has stud
ied for the revival at Stanford.
"In the first place, in the nine
teenth century, Malvolio was senti
mentalized into a hero. We see him
as the butt of almost all the humor
in the play. He is the serious-minded
sober kind who is always a dupeâ€”or
"gull," as the Elizabethans called
them.
Different Treatment
"On the other hand," he declared,
"Olivia was treated unsympathet
ically, as a haughty, unpleasant
woman. The lines indicate, in my
opinion, that she is fundamentally
likeable.
"Where in many productions we
see Sir Andrew Aguecheek played
as a fop, we prefer to play him here
as a nit-wit, which gives him more
appeal to modern audiences through
humor
With the closing of "Twelfth
Night," Director Heffner returns to
Northwestern to resume his post as
professor of dramatics.
