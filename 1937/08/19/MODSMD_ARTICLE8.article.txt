# Drama Season Will End With Gala Weekend
## 
### 
With eight dramatic performances,
one concert, and one outdoor dance
program, Friday and Saturday will
be climax days of the music, dra
matic, and dance activities which
have been strong fields of interest
during the summer session. With
the exception of the concert, the
programs are all under the auspices
of the Summer Drama Festival
which has focused its interest on the
dramatic comedy from the sixteenth
century to modern times.
With the presentation at 1:30
o'clock of three experimental one
act plays in the little theater of
Memorial Hall as a starter Friday
afternoon also offers a concert by
the Kolisch Quartet of Vienna. The
plays feature a cast of summer ses
sion students, and the quartet pre
sented the fifth concert donated this
summer by Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, who has sponsored mu
sical programs on the campus for
several years.
Allowing the interval of the din
ner hour to go unchartered, the
third feature, Shakespeare's "Twelfth
Night," is offered at 8:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall. The play, under the
direction of Hubert Heffner, marks
the first dramatic presentation in the
new theater.
With a repeat performance of the
experimental plays in the little
theater of the Memorial Hall, Satur
day's activities begin at 2 o'clock.
At 4:15 there will be an outdoor
dance program of sixteenth century
court and country dances in the
Laurence Frost Amphitheater, the
only program to be offered from
the amphitheater during the summer
session.
In the evening the local thespians
again gain the spotlight with a re
peat performance of "Twelfth Night."
In conjunction with Stanford's
drama activities is the presentation
at the Palo Alto Community The
ater of Shaw's "Pygmalion."
