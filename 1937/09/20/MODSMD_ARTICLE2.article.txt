Life at Stanford combines the simplicity and lack of affectation of a country
school with the polish and achievement of a first rate university. The picture at
the right is typical of many campus scenes.
Back of the well-kept lawns and formal gardens are the meadows and fields of
the old Farm. Every spring a mowing machine tacks back and forth behind the
Library leaving neat little stacks of hay. Except when the frosh get careless with
cigareti t utts, these serve as 1 peaceful reminder that Stanford seeks to be quiet
and efficient rather than pretentious.
The solid bulk of the Library, rising above the thresher keeps before the stu
dents thf leit motif of study that always comes up when you feel like taking a nap.
And th> . Inning fender of the car in the foreground represents the modern world
which is everp iosent in the living University.
The trim haystacks, and the churning mower are an established part of the
Stanford scene, even thou jh there is no truth in the rumor that the Comptroller
plows the south forty every May Day. Students remember this picture as typical
of the peace and simplicity of the Farm.
