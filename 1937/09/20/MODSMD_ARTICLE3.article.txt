						Glance at .. . The Inside of Stanford
## 
### 
While war bombs rend the Orient, machine guns spray death in
Spain, the nation jitters with labor unrest and the world gulps diplo
matic aspirin, Stanford's 4,000 will temporarily forget the melee next
week to return to the guietude of the Farm.
To the new faces, Stanford will appear to be a collection of sand
stone buildings, a football team, the professorial force, and all the
rest that makes up the physical structure of the University.
Without great difficulty the new faces will find such common
cinematic portrayals of "real collitch life" as the waving pennant,
moonlight on the campus, and, perhaps, a good-looking coed.
But the old faces will "see" all this and more.
Behind the physical structure of this University lies some strange,
ethereal thing that inspires editorials about "Stanford spirit" and
leads old-timers to rant about the red tile roofs.
It's that sentimentality, that fondness for the spiritual Stanford, that
has led old faces to read meaning into the adjoining picture of the
interior of the Stanford Chapel.
Near the center of the Quadrangle, which is the nucleus of Stan
ford's academic plant, is the chapel, always open. There, in the
midst of classroom hustle,, two young visitors have wandered into
the quiet hall to peer with curiosity at its mosaic porticos above.
The newcomer may fail to find meaning in this scene. But give
him this year in spell of these physical things that make Stanford
and he will begin to "feel" the spiritual attachment for his vital young
University. He will look beyond sandstone and tile.
To our new faces, welcome to the Inside of Stanford.
