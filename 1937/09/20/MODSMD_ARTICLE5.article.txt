# But . . . Stanford Recommends a Balanced Diet
## 
### 
Some freshmen come to college expecting to raise the ther
mal output of flaming youth. Others come trembling in antici
pation of four years of drudgery under Simon Legree profes
sors who flog lagging spirits with grade books. Only the more
fortunate frosh realize that university life is neither picnic nor
punishment.
As these pictures show work and relaxation both enter into
life at Stanford. Even here the pleasure side may be overempha
sized; hours spent in the Library can't be shown in photographic
terms. The rough can play as much or as little as he pleases, but
examinations are scheduled according to the Gregorian calen
dar, which is seldom changed. Those who don't remember this
needn't bother about life at Stanford.
The University provides opportunities for both work and re
laxation. But it leaves it up to the students to mix them correctly.
Extra-curricular activities can be made an important part of col
lege life if built on the bed-rock of study.


It is one of the ironies of college life, that the professors who are supposed to teach the students seem tremendously interestad in making the
students tell them what the course is about. Final examinations, in two- and four-hour sizes, are a manifestation of this professorial phenomena.
The one shown above will never be duplicated, for the old Assembly Hall in which it was given has been converted into classrooms for the Gradu
ate School of Business. Destination of the laboriously prepared blue books is the corrector shown below, left. Like the goddess of justice, this gentle
man is divinely impartial, but unfortunately he is not blindfolded. He asks no questions about the nature of truth, and he does not believe in salvation
either by faith or by purity of soul.



Pleasant it is for little tin gods to make a noise like Jim Farley when they gather in party
caucus. But when its time to count the votes there's nothing but headaches and empty seats.
The two Spartans above are among the workers that make Stanford's democratic government
possible.


"Oh God of Hosts, be with us yet, lest we forget." The psych book says there is less
forgetting during sleep than at any other time. Here's one girl that got as far as that chapter.


It's just a skin game as you'll find out after four years.
The Math Department would graph it as a circle. They have diplomas for students and students for diplomas. Nobody loses but the sheep and
Little Bo Peep who comes out short on the spring roundup. Above, University Press employees preparing diplomas. Left, taking a proof and checking
it for errors. Right, making the impression.
Below, the lines of recipients of degrees at last year's Commencement file into the newly dedicated Laurence Frost Amphitheater. At left, under
the olive tree are the speakers' desk and diplomas waiting to be distributed. Part of the 8,000 spectators appear in the foreground. P. A. 1 imes Photo
