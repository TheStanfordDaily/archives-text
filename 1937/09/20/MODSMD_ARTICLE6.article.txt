# Here's Your New Red Machine
## As It Lines Up For The Broncs Saturday 
### 
Stanford's Big Red Machine of the gridiron heads
onto the football roads of 1937 with a much brighter
outlook than last season when head man Tiny Thorn
hill had to depend on prayerful passes to pull him over
the rough spots.
Just the addition of Bootin' Bill Paulman at the quar
terback spot adds a world of strength to the Cardinal
team. Paulman's kicking was sorely needed last sea
son, when he was shelved with an injury before the
first game against Santa Clara.
The Broncos of Santa Clara again invade the Indian
sanctuary for the first game of the season, Saturday,
September 25. The Sugar Bowl champs walked all
over Stanford last year to win 13-0. But last year Paul
man and Jimmy Coffis were missing from the Stanford
lineup. Next Saturday Bill will be in there punting
them down into enemy territory and Jimmy will be
lugging the pigskin back toward the Santa Clara kicker,
namely Chuck Palvelko.
Early practice indicates that Tiny will depend upon
Paulman at quarter, Ed Gamier at right half, Coffis at
left half, and Jim Groves at fullback. The first string
line shapes up with Grant Stone and Jack Clarke at
ends; Stan Anderson and Pete Zagar, tackles; Leo
Ferko and Jack Walton, guards; and Tony Calvelli at
center.
Tiny has a wealth of backfield material to choose
from and can put four sets of backs in the ball game to
stand up against any team on the coast.


This is the squad that Coach "Tiny" Thornhill expects to put on the field
against Santa Clara next Saturday. They are, left to right: Grant Stone, right end;
Stan Andersen, right tackle; Pete Zagar, left tackle; Tony Calvelli, center; Jack

Walton, right guard; Leo Ferko, left guard; Jack Clark, left end. In the backfield,
Ed Gamier, right half; Bill Paulman, quarter; Jim Groves, full; Jimmy Coffis, left
half.—S. F. Chronicle photo


At right the photographer caught a
group of Stanford backs that will be
tearing over the turf this fall in an
effort to wreak havoc on the enemy.
They're non-letter winners of 1936,
freshmen, junior college transfers, and
others who were "saved'' last year.
Full of determination to gain Var
sity berths, they are, left to right,
front row: Bill Kirsch, Elmer Sjostrom,
A1 Alustiza, brother of the famous
Frank; Pete Fay, Gene Coldiron, and
Tom Walker; back row, left to right:
Howard Hickingbotham, Rod Parker,
Fred Ledeboer, Chet Patton, Gerald

the rough spots.
Just the addition of Bootin' Bill Paulman at the quar
terback spot adds a world of strength to the Cardinal
team. Paulman's kicking was sorely needed last sea
son, when he was shelved with an injury before the
first game against Santa Clara.
The Broncos of Santa Clara again invade the Indian
sanctuary for the first game of the season, Saturday,
September 25. The Sugar Bowl champs walked all
over Stanford last year to win 13-0. But last year Paul
man and Jimmy Coffis were missing from the Stanford
lineup. Next Saturday Bill will be in there punting
them down into enemy territory and Jimmy will be
lugging the pigskin back toward the Santa Clara kicker,
namely Chuck Palvelko.
Early practice indicates that Tiny will depend upon
Paulman at quarter, Ed Gamier at right half, Coffis at
left half, and Jim Groves at fullback. The first string
line shapes up with Grant Stone and Jack Clarke at
ends; Stan Anderson and Pete Zagar, tackles; Leo
Ferko and Jack Walton, guards; and Tony Calvelli at
center.
Tiny has a wealth of backfield material to choose
from and can put four sets of backs in the ball game to
stand up against any team on the coast.


This is the squad that Coach "Tiny" Thornhill expects to put on the field
against Santa Clara next Saturday. They are, left to right: Grant Stone, right end;
Stan Andersen, right tackle; Pete Zagar, left tackle; Tony Calvelli, center; Jack

Walton, right guard; Leo Ferko, left guard; Jack Clark, left end. In the backfield,
Ed Gamier, right half; Bill Paulman, quarter; Jim Groves, full; Jimmy Coffis, left
half.—S. F. Chronicle photo


At right the photographer caught a
group of Stanford backs that will be
tearing over the turf this fall in an
effort to wreak havoc on the enemy.
They're non-letter winners of 1936,
freshmen, junior college transfers, and
others who were "saved'' last year.
Full of determination to gain Var
sity berths, they are, left to right,
front row: Bill Kirsch, Elmer Sjostrom,
A1 Alustiza, brother of the famous
Frank; Pete Fay, Gene Coldiron, and
Tom Walker; back row, left to right:
Howard Hickingbotham, Rod Parker,

the rough spots.
