# Picture Day
## 
### 
Wednesday, September 8, was a big day on the
Farm. From every corner of the nation came aspirants
for berths on the Stanford Varsity—some 80 in all. But
that was only part of it.
A flood of photographers poured in from Sari Fran
cisco and turned the practice field into a four ring circus.
They rushed "Tiny" Thornhill into a sulky and snapped
him wheeling for a touchdown. They had little Jimmy
Coffis flying through the air, and landing with none-too
great ease. They lined up the first string, the second
string, the newcomers, the oldtimers, the kickers, the
ends, and so on —until by nightfall everyone was worn
out —but not from football.
Howard Brodie, the S. F. Chronicle's ace artist, made
the accompanying drawings depicting the highlights of
Stanford's first grid battle of the season. .
