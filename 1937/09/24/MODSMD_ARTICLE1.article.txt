# New Division Falls Heir To Major Plays
## Dramatic Council Loses Control of Productions To Drama Department 
### 
Major changes loom for Stanford's
dramatic structure as the newiy
formed Speech and Drama Depart
ment lays plans to take over the con
trol of the year's three big piays,
according to Gordon C. Lange, di
rector of dramatics.
These plays will henceforth be
classroom projects and part of the
speech-drama courses although stu
dent groups will be granted use of
the Memorial Hall to produce any
number of shows du/ing the year and
the traditional Spring Show and
Gaieties will still be financed by the
A.S.S.U.
May Amalgamate
Lange also suggested that the
Council may amalgamate with Ram's
Head, Sword and Sandals, Masquers,
and Barnstormers and elect a set of
officers. Under those circumstances,
Clay McDaniels, present Dramatic
Council head, would probably go in
as business manager, Lange said.
Chuck Fontius, student manager
and member of the Council expressed
his doubt that the student societies
would be willing to merge.
He intimated, however, that the
Council was heartily in accord with
♦he idea of giving over the three
plays to the drama department.
Conflict in Choice
'"There was a lot of conflict any
way about choice of plays between
the public speaking department and
the council," said Fontius. "They
wanted more arty stuff. We wanted
box-office hits. Now the plan is just
about ideal. They have left us with
the two biggest money-makers, the
Spring Show and the Gaieties. We'll
tr> to put on another musical in the
winter which will give us three
shows a year."
Director Lange also suggested that
it may be possible to set aside a cer
tain night each week for Drama De
partment plays in the Little Theatre
besides the major productions.
In addition to courses in acting and
directing the new school offers
classes in stage design, practical
staging, costume design, and light
ing.
