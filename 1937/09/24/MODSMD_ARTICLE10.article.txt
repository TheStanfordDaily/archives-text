# Pinza to Open Concert Series in New Theater
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
Completion of the new theater
means one thing to Stanford Concert
Series first nighters—they will sit in
comfortable seats this year with a
clear view of the stage, for Concert
Series programs in the burlap-hung
Pavilion are a thing of the past.
Perhaps the biggest drawing card
of this year's series will be Marion
Anderson, talented Negress contral
to, who made her debut on the con
cert stage last year.
Now Famous
She is now known not only as a
singer of Negro spirituals but also
as a master of other types of music.
She will appear here on February 24.
Opening attraction of the season
will be Ezio Pinza, whose concert is
scheduled for November 10. Con
sidered the leading basso of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, his
career began a few years ago with
his debut in New York. Like Marion
Anderson he has appeared in San
Francisco.
More spectacular than usual will
be the program of the Salzburg Op
era Guild on January 11. The Guild
presents both modern and classical
operas, includes about 75 artists, and
come directly from Austria where
the great drama festival is held ev- j
ery year.

Opera production is now possible
on the campus because of the facili
ties of stage and curtain in the Thea
ter.
Another addition to concert series
will be the dance team of Fowler


VIRGINIA SMITH
Concerts Series Manager
and Tamara. Essentially a Spanish
team they are unique in that they
do not confine their program to the
tango and Spanish selections but
present modern, interpretative, and
satirical numbers as well. Their pro
gram will be the last of the series
and has been set for April 5.
End oi Scries
Although the series will be held in
the new Theater it has not been nec
essary to raise the prices with the
exception of an added section.
Student tickets for the entire sea
son will be $5, $4, and $3 for the
orchestra, $5 and $4 for the balcony
circle, and $3 arid $2 for the balcony.
General admission prices are $1.50
more in each case.
Stanford summer session enroll
ment was second this year among all
the schools in the country that hold
summer sessions.
