# Women to Have Rush Rule Books
## 
### 
Booklets containing rushing rules
will be distributed to new women
sometime before (he first autumn
quarter Panhellenie teas, according
to the Dean of Women's office. The
provisions in this year's Panhellenie j
Bidding Contract, as the booklet is
officially titled, differ only slightly
from those of last year.
During autumn quarter and until
pledging in winter quarter no new
woman can be in a private room in
Hoble with a sorority woman even
though a sponsor is present. This
does not apply to sisters and cou
ins who may be together at any
time or place except during formal
winter quarter rushing, provided no
sorority sister or any other new
woman is present. Likewise PanheL
! lenic restrictions on social inter
course do not apply autumn quarter
to new women living in upper class
dormitories nor to transfers living
with partner or guardian.
