# Administration Foresees Continuation of Trend To Higher Registration
## 
### 
With King Football opening the
throttle, Stanford students are climb -
ing aboard the Indian special for the
1937-38 run. Returning in numbers
expected to exceed last year's fall
registration—3,92l—the campus will
come to life under the impetus of
extensive activity programs.
As at this time last year, the quota
for new Lower Division students has
been reached, bringing a total of 450
new men, and 250 new women into
the Lower Division. Any increase in
total registration will be derived
from an increase of returning old
students. Following the trend of en
rollment shown in the past three
years, an all-time high in registra
tion—over 4,000 —is expected to be
reached.
This trend is shown in pre-regis
tration figures for past years, from a
total of 3,599 in 1934, an increase of
11 per cent over the depression year
of 1932, to last year's final fall en
rollment of 3,995. An interesting
comparison in the growth of the Uni
versity is seen in the registration
figure for the fall of 1891, the begin
ning of the University, of 500 stu
dents.
Men's dormitories—Toy on, Bran
ner, and Sequoia—will be open on
Saturday, the 25th. Lagunita, Union,
and outside houses will be open for
returning women on the 26th. Al
though the new wings of Lagunita
will reduce the number of outside
houses in use, the number of women
able to be housed in campus dormi
tories will not be increased. This
limit of housing facilities places the
limit on women to be enrolled in the
University at approximately 1100.
Although at present, Encina has a
few vacancies, Toyon, Branner, and
Sequoia are filled. Women's dormi
tories are also filled to capacity, with
vacancies expected to open through
last-minute withdrawals.
