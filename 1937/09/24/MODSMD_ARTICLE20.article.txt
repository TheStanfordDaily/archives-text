# Farm Adopts New Advanced Degree Plans
## M.A. Honors to Be Goal Of B â€“ Average Student In 'University Division' 
### 
Pointing the way towards a new
era in Stanford education, two new
plans making special provision for
above-average students in the Up
per Division will go into effect with
the opening of autumn quarter. The
creation of the University Division"
was authorized by a meeting of the
Academic Council held during sum
mer quarter.
The purpose of the new degree
system, Dr. John Pearce Mitchell,
University Registrar, said, is to take
care of bri.Ujf.nt student who are
planning graduate work an 1 wish to
organize their upper division an J
graduate work into a single unit.
New Idea Present jd
Associate Registrar M. Cowdery
said recently that "the plan is such
a completely new idea that it will
really not become effective until
after the students return, and those
who are eligible discuss their work
with the heads of their departments."
All freshmen students who have
completed their first year with an
average grade of 8 or better, or all
transfers with two years of ad
vanced standing and the equivalent
of B grades, will be granted ad
mission to the "University Division,"
Registrar Mitchell declared.
Under the new plan, such students
will not have to meet the usual
Lower Division requirements, and
they will not be candidates for the
A.B. degree. It is expected that such
students will formulate individual
pisnc of study under the direction
of their department heads, which will
lead directly to advanced or profes
sional degrees.
Transfer Application
The second part of the new degree
system applies to transfei students
applying for admission to the Upper
Division. If they present scholastic
records equal to a B average, they
will be exempted from any Stanford
Lower Division requirements which
they might not have fulfilled.
Although several universities in
the East have pioneered in the field
of waiving rigid entrance and Lower
Division requirements, Stanford, un
der the new degree plan, will be
the first university in this country
to offer the M.A. degree on this
Lasis.
It is against the law to hitch-hike
in many towns and highways.
