Music Activities
Extra-curricular activities in mu
sic are represented by the men's
and women's glee clubs, symphony
orchestra, choir, and band, all of
which offer units of University
credit. Positions on the managerial
staff of the Stanford Concert Series
are obtained through tryouts.
Membership in Stanford's Y.W.C.A.
with its various administrative posi
tions and interest groups is open

to all University women. While no
such ban exists fior freshman men,
freshman women are barred from
participating in campus dramatics
during their first quarter in school,
but later in the year if their grades
so warrant, are given opportunity to
join other would-be student actors
in play tryouts.
Debating is open to both men
and women, as in membership in
the Speakers' Bureau, which sends
student speakers to clubs and schools
on the Peninsula.
Finally among university extra
curricular* activities are clubs cater
ing to special interests or -hobbies.
Some of these are the rifle club, ski
club, badminton club, flying club,
sailing club, and Orchesis, women's
national honorary dance society.
