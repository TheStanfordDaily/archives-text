# Chappie Offers New Features
## Editor Promises Change In Policy, Make-Up 
### 
New typography, layouts, and pol
icy will be featured in Volume 39
of the Stanford Chaparral, campus
humor magazine, according to Editor
Bob Hartmann. These changes, he
said, "will be combined with Chap
pie's 40-year-old tradition of lead
ership among the nation's funny
magazines to produce what we hope
will be the best Chappie ever."
ChaparraL, Hartmann explained,
has three main purposes: to enter
tain, to view the contemporary
scene, and to serve as a laboratory
for embryonic literary and artistic
talent. This year's volume will stress
entertainment and comment, and
will try to provide more opportuni
ties for promising writers and car
toonists.
The Fables of the Farm depart
ment which records Stanford's folk
lore of the future will be continued
and expanded. Little Pop-off, xed
skinned Candide of Pueblo-Much-
High-Learning, will go into his fifth
year of puzzled contemplation.
Ted Cornell, new circulation chief,
will handle the annual drive for sub
scriptions, and business manager
Foster Markolf will determine the
Chaparral's financial destinies.
The area of the city of London is
603 square miles.
