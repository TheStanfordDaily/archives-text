# Student Rule On Farm Is Greatest In Nation
## 
### JIM STONE 
In a survey recently conducted
by the education department of the
University, it was revealed that Stan
ford students maintain a greater de
gree of self-government than any
other university.
Combining legislative and execu
tive powers, Executive Committee
exercises final authority in student
affairs. The body is composed of
the president and vice-president oi
the student body, and nine other
elected members. Co-ordinated with
this group is Women's Conference
which deals with matters of interest
to the women only.
Judicial Power
The judicial power of the student
body is vested in Men's and Women's
Council. Financial control is exer
cised by the General Manager
through a Student Manager appoint
ed by him.
In controlling all student body
funds, either directly or in a super
visory position, the most important
student officer is the Student Mana
ger. Student body moneys derived
from the community lee are handled
directly by him in accordance with
a budget formulated by the Execu
tive Committee. In addition he has
a supervisory control of the funds
of all classes, societies, publications,
and other student organizations, with
the single exception of the living
groups and the eating clubs.
Ex Committee
The office of student body presi
dent is filled by general election
each year. He presides over the
Executive Committee, is the official
representative of the Stanford stu
dents, and is the official link be
tween students and faculty. He
maintains wide appointive powers ;
and is enabled to act on all com
mittees which he appoints.

All business of student organiza
tions, excepting living groups, passes
through the hands of the Executive
Committee. It's greatest power is de
rived from its control of student
body expenditures, a control seldom
exercised. It also approves all ap
pointments of the President, and can
pass, amend, or revoke any of the
by-laws governing the student body
or subsidiary organizations. Through
the recommendation of the vice
president, the Executive Committee
grants ail social dates.
Men's and Women's Council, com
posed of five elected members, exer
cise disciplinary control through rec
ommendations to the President of
the University.
