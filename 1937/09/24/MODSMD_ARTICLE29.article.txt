# Dividex To Be Out For Registration
## 
### 
Dividex for 1937-38, now being
printed, will be available free on
registration day at the Bookstore,
Roos Brothers' downtown and En
cina stores, and at halls, sororities,
and fraternities.
The dividex are the dividing sheets
used in student binders as indices.
Two students are appointed each
year by the A.S.S.U. to sell adver
tising space on the pages. This year
the managers, Gordy Frost and Dick
Daugherty, report six pages of space
have been sold.
