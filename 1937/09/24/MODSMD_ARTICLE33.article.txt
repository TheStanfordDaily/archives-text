## Welcome Sans Meringue 
### 
ONCE upon a time someone wrote
a little piece and called it "a wel
come to freshmen." It was a neat little
bit that went something like this:
"We are glad to welcome you as a
freshman to our university. We hope
you will like it here and we know you
will. We hope you will uphold our
traditions and will give the best you
have. What you get out of college de
pends upon how much you put into it.
We are happy to welcome you as a
freshman to our university."
Smudged into trite simplicity those
verbose sermons no longer deserve
even a corner in the editorial waste
basket. Their epitaphs should have
been written when the last trusting
frosh threw up his hands and screamed
"garbage," but, unfortunately, the tra

ditional little messages of goodwill
hang on. And, I suppose, if this were
to run true to form, it would bury itself
in a welcome and emerge with the
panacea to every freshman ill.
The freshman knows without read
ing how it goes—he's heard a high
school principal dish it out trimmed in
one way or another for the past three
or four years. Perhaps, as a prep school
official —and most every frosh has
been one—he may have warmed the
same hash for his underlings.
The Stanford Daily takes this oppor
tunity to sidestep that trite little chat
and sweep the fluff out of its welcome.
To the Class of '41 it extends the
traditional greeting of Stanford man
to Stanford man.
Hello!
