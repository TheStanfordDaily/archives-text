# COTTON CALL
## 
### 
IT'S a coincidence, and perhaps a happy one,
that one of the largest cotton crops the south
has produced came in a year when there may
be a record demand for cotton at Stanford.
Stuffing for the ears of Dramatics Director
Gordon C. Lange would create the demand.
Mr. Lange is the center of a situation which,
at this point, seems to indicate a lot of scream
ing, perhaps from dramatic groups, perhaps
from the theater-going rough, and perhaps not
at all. But lesser things than the present situa
ation have caused dramatic screaming in the
past.
Occasion for the noise is the new dramatic
setup, which puts the three big plays of the
season in the classroom under direction of the
new Speech and Drama Department. Student
groups are left two productions: Gaieties to
Ram's Head, Spring Show to Barnstormers.
Because the dramatic department "wanted
more arty stuff and the A.S.S.U. office wanted
more box office hits" under the old arrange
ment, student manager Chuck Fontius is happy
now. That conflict is ironed out, but theater
goers may be caught in the mangle. The de
partment is now free to produce the art, but
roughs put on a steady diet of "Lady Precious
Stream" and "This Side Idolatry" may make Mr.
Lange call for more cotton.
Mr. Lange himself predicts that the dramatic
groups, Ram's Head, Masquers, Barnstormers,
and Sword and Sandals may merge with dra
matic council and elect one set of officers.

There is no hint that this will be forced, and
majorities of each group may put it through,
but individual screaming is to be expected from
members who take seriously group loyalty and
traditions of years standing.
That the University is assuming control of
dramatics is sign of growth. Dramatics at Stan
ford comes out of the limbo of student spon
sorship onto the solid ground of academic rec
ognition. But vested interests are being pushed
around and Mr. Lange, as dramatic director,
will probably hear about it, even through the
cotton.

Speaking of the Dionne quintuplets in a re
cent issue of the New Yorker, it is suqgested
that some one write a book entitled "The Five
Little Economic Royalists, and How They
Grew."
