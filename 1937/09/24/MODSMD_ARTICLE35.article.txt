AGE OF INNOCENCE
As this issue of the Daily goes forth with its tidings
of comfort and joy, incoming freshmen are re-read
ing the Dean's form letter and wondering what college
is really like. Many of them have a hazy impression
that university life is composed of periods of intense
study, alternating with periods of riot and revolution.
And quite a few frosh-to-be wonder unhappily if natu
ral selection won't crack down on poor devils with
peaceful dispositions and to-bed-at-ten-thirty tra
ditions.
Such frosh may forget their worries and devote their
energies to packing the lares and penates and to bid
ding goodbye to the girls they leave behind them. But
the men who plan to roll into the campus with a hi
there toots, and a rah-rah-rah would do well to take
another look for the way, the truth, and the light.

Movies and magazines to the contrary, it is not the
undergraduate's mission to sec how many command
ments he can break at once. Psychologists can pro
duce saw-tooth curves that prove that the average
college student is not only sane but also reasonably
intelligent, which is more than can be said of the
average of almost any other group. And when the old
grad begins to romance of cows in chapels and eggs
in fans, the psychologists label him with ten syllabic
words which translated mean "damn fool."

The modern undergraduate finds it an unfortunate
but unavoidable fact that the Lord did not put enough
time into a day to permit either high pressure romance
or spirited rioting. The movies, of course, give the im
pression that any man who docs not have a date every
night is taken out by his friends and quietly drowned.
The movies also take as a working principle the idea
that half an undergraduate's time is spent in trying
to kick somebody's teeth out, or in sobering up the
quarterback so that he can run ninety-nine yards and
eleven inches for a touch-down.
The freshman who comes to college expecting to lead
such a life will be cither a disappointed man or a psy
chopathic case at the end of a month. He will find
that the undergraduate today is too busy to imitate
insanity. He will discover that for some, reason no
co-ed whips into tap routine on the professor's desk,
and that nobody ever spills a bottle of scotch in the
middle of a lecture.

A nd the frosh who prefers to go to bed some time
before dawn, and who doesn't en re to strangle a
man just because he is from another school, will not
find himself treated as a leper. Nor will the wrath of
outraged tradition fall on the man who stops after a
few drinks and who is a bit timid about whistling at
strange girls.
Of course, the form letters are a bit on the conserva
tive side. Nobody will exactly scorn a man with a
car. And the Mark and the Fairmont are rather nasty
about letting people in who are not pretty well dressed.
But for an accurate picture of college life, the grand
old form letter is considerably more dependable than
movies directed by men who failed the fifth grade.
