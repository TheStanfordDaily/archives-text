'T'HE moment has now arrived, when, according to the
calendar on the wall of the Daily shack, summer is
at an end or is drawing to a rapid conclusion.
As a result, things done in the warm part of the
year, such as working for those accustomed to little
besides studying and other forms of life at Stanford.
The Daily Staff has busily exchanged experiences be
tween stories, trips to the Union and borrowed
cigarettes.
Among other tales finding their way about is that of
the ardent young reporter who went to his friend the
small-town newspaper editor and had a long friendly
chat with him, man to man and face to face and re
ceived many fine pearls of advice which were not in
vain. Among these was a word of caution about taking
a job with a small newspaper on a ten-dollars-a-week
basis which wouldn't get him very far, baccuse he
would never get anywhere. At the termination of the
conversation, the young gentleman tactfully brought
up the subject of a position for the summer months
which included reporting in his best manner, etc.
The executive of the small town newspaper said he
was happy to comply with the request. He could have
a job doing general stooge work saying: "You'll get
lots of experience, at ten dollars a week."

Another form of summer activity was the summer
vacationing trip with or without the family and friends.
One young Stanfordite is now recognizable over his
two-pants suit of tan by his bedroom slippers which he
wears all day. These dignify him with the reputation
of a man who has been to Mexico, pronounced Mehico,
as all Mexicans, pronounced Mehicanos, wear bedroom
slippers. He also says. "Salud" over afternoon orange
juice instead of mud in yer eye.
This same gentleman felt almost at home the other
day coming down the peninsula, as he glanced up and
saw a sign advertising the San Mateo County Siesta a
little later this month. Close friends of the Mexico
lover told him that it was a Fiesta, because they had
been driving slower, so he put on his bedroom slippers
and went to sleep.

Returning Sponsors will soon be preparing pam
phlets, booklets, and mimeographed sheets for the new
freshmen. Probably the only advice they have left out
is to let your roommate have the bed out of the draft
for the first few weeks. It will be warm enough to
need one.
