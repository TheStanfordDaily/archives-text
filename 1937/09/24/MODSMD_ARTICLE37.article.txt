# Huston Stars In New Play On S.F. Stage
## 
### 
"The Miles of Heaven," now at the
Curran: Starring Walter Huston, as
William Herschel, 18th Century as
tronomer, and featuring Nan Sun
derland and Barbara O'Neill.
This play, judged as a play alone,
is thin. In the last scene Mr. Hus
ton is wrenched through his major
struggle in five minutes fiat, some
thing of a record. It looks as if play
wright Hertz regards a climax as
something of a bad tooth, to be
yanked out by the dramatist's pliers
left dripping in the third act.
Despite lots of nice curtain
speeches about the San Francisco
audience's intellect, I begin to sus
pect the San Francisco audience
goes to see a play for the same rea
son as anybody else—to get a good
dose of the type of bedroom and
murder slop they could read in the
Sunday rotos. Good theater has an
element of sensationalism. "The
Miles of Heaven" has not.
On the other hand, if the play
lacked dime-store glitter, it was
burnished with the dull luster of
quality. All threfc performances of
the stellar players were beautiful—
Huston's, Sunderland s, and O'Neill's.
Moreover, the characters in the play
are subtly conceived, their emotional
problems carefully wrought. No
character is flatly this or that. Even
the black villainy of the possessive,
malicious sister (Miss Sunderland)
who tries to wreck her brother's
marriage, is fully motivated. All
told, "The Miles of Heaven" tells a
quiet, wise story, and the realization
that its voice is probably too small
to carry is a little rueful.
