# Roos Opens Sale Of Rooters' Caps
## 
### 
About the only prerequisites for
attending Stanford's football games
are hearty voices and rooters' caps.
The former are natural, but the lat
ter can be obtained only at Roos
Bros.' store in Palo Alto or their
Stanford Shop in Encina.
The caps sell for 65 cents, and are
the only official rooters' caps on sale.
It is expected that each rooter will
wear the cap, and a white shirt, in
order to provide a proper back
ground for between - the - halves
stunts.
