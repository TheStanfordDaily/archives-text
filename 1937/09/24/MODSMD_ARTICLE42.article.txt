# Psychology Course Aids Slow Readers
## 
### 
Designed to aid students who have \
difficulty in reading rapidly and
thoroughly, Psychology R will be
given during the fall quarter only.
The course is under the direction of
Mr. W. M. Danner, and is in three
sections, each section being limited
to 35 students.
Classes in the past have shown an
average improvement of from 50 to
80 per cent in reading speed and
comprehension. Students whose en
trance examination shows the need
for special training of this sort have
received a notice to that effect. They
should see Mr. Danner- in his office
on Registration Day to reserve a
place in the sections.
