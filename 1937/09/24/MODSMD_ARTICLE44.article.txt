# Beefy Frosh Gridders Set For first Tilt
## Man – Mountain Papooses Hit Santa Ana Jaysee In Brone Preliminary 
### Hurry Press 
Being a pretty big guy himself,
Mr. Harry Shipkey has a logical ar
gument when he says that most good
things come in large quantities. To
prove his point, Mr. Shipkey hesi
tates not one moment in aiming his
index finger in the general direction
of his pride and joy—Stanford's 1937
Papoose gridders.
These young gentlemen not only
form what is the largest frosh squad
ever to hit these parts, but what is
more, the fellows are not the slight
est bit puny. Far from it. "Mooses"
very adequately describes these big
guys who are going to pound up turf
under the able direction of their
boss, Mr. Shipkey.
Mr. Shipkey, being a charter
member of that group of men who
are categorically listed as strong and
silent, hesitates to comment on his
charges for fear of having the man
mountains turn on him. His vocabu
lary, he claims, is not up to the co
lossal task of doing adequate justice
to this super-squad which has shown
up in this, Mr. Shipkey's second year
as coach of the Papoose footballers.
To Meet Santa Ana
That time, it seems, is when the
starting cannon will blast for the
opening Papoose battle of the sea
son. It's bound to be a thriller
diller, for the worthy opponents are
none other than the fellows frohi
Santa Ana Jaysee, who enjoy the
pre-season rating of the strongest
junior college team in the southland.
Which is indeed a strong statement.
Strong Lineup
At the present time, it appears
that the starting lineup will be a
strong one: at full will be Norman
Standlee, a 207-pound gent from
Long Beach who was chosen for the
all-southern California eleven. Half
backs are to be Thor Peterson, a
very tough fellow whose opponents
would pale when he would head
their way up in Hoquiam, Washing
ton, and Bob Olden, all-city from
Los Angeles. Stan Graff, a short,
stocky quarter, hails from Oakland,
and will flip in his two-bits worth
many a time, much to the disgust of
the other team.
On the line at left end is Jim Far
quharson, who made all-city in the
nation's capital city. Which is quite
an accomplishment when one con
siders the gravy-grabbing congress
men. Next door at left tackle lives
Ed Johansen, a gentleman who
names his home as Pinole, Califor
nia, and who had little trouble in
receiving all-city honors when at
Richmond High. Left guard is John
Kerman, who hails from Los Ange
les, although he made his name as a
light fine footballer in New Jersey.
Thompson Tough
Not just another center is Jack
Thompson, from Butte, Montana. His
scoreboard says that he was all-state
for two years. Which is okay in any
language. "Chick" Orme holds down
right guard in a very capable man
ner, thank you. He's from Phoenix.
Right tackle is Bill Braheny from
Chicago, Illinois, who did all light
for himself, being named all-state.
And at right end is Jack Cudihy
from Massachusetts. He was a very
successful captain of a likewise very
successful eleven at Kiski Prep.
The full squad is as follows:
Ends.—James Farquharson, Jack
Cudihy, Stan Charlston, Arnold Mei
ners, Robert Olden, Howard Ruth,

for himself, being named all-state.
And at right end is Jack Cudihy
from Massachusetts. He was a very
successful captain of a likewise very
successful eleven at Kiski Prep.
The full squad is as follows:
Ends.—James Farquharson, Jack
Cudihy, Stan Charlston, Arnold Mei
ners, Robert Olden, Howard Ruth,
Jim Lincoln, Robert Lewis, Stan
Graff, Eugene Stockwell, Mario Vial,
Joseph Wilson, L. B. Harbour, Bill
Grant, Edwin Jones, Ben Berry, Bob
Ditlevsen, and Fred Taylor.
'lackles.—Edward Johansen, Roy
Adamson, Dean Burford, Charles
Orme, Robert Schultz, Bob Leaver,
John Funderburg, John Kerman,
Jack Gustavson, Robert Park, Claude
Purkitt, James Taylor, and Charles
Cleveland.
Guards.—Bill Braheny, Harold
Barnard, John Moore, Ray Diekem
per, Jr., John Macau ley, Jack War
necke, James Johnson, Lester Hib
bard, Don Smiley, and Adrian Engel
hard.
Centers.—Bill Tucker, Hughes
Ogilvie, Jack Hull, Frank Marvin,
Fred Bischoff, Bill Hirst, and Jack
Thompson.
Halves.—Monty Pfyl, Glen South,
Eugene Kern, Glanville Wheeler,
Stan Summeril, Bruce Hawley,
Ralph Miller, Sid Hayes, Fred Ali
bi ight, and Thor Peterson.
Quarters. —Hardin Stephens. Wal
ter McKenzie, William Miller, Elton
Boone, Kenneth St. John, and David
Nottage.
Fulls.-—Norman Standlee, Hugh
Smith, Jim McCJoud, Marius Rocle,
Reginald Aston, Barney Deasy, Rob
ert Gill, and Quentin Thompson.
Being a pretty big guy himself,
Mr. Harry Shipkey has a logical ar
gument when he says that most good
things come in large quantities. To
prove his point, Mr. Shipkey hesi
tates not one moment in aiming his
index finger in the general direction
of his pride and joy—Stanford's 1937
Papoose gridders.
These young gentlemen not only
form what is the largest frosh squad
ever to hit these parts, but what is
more, the fellows are not the slight
est bit puny. Far from it. "Mooses"
very adequately describes these big
guys who are going to pound up turf
under the able direction of their
boss, Mr. Shipkey.
Mr. Shipkey, being a charter
member of that group of men who
are categorically listed as strong and
silent, hesitates to comment on his
charges for fear of having the man
mountains turn on him. His vocabu
lary, he claims, is not up to the co
lossal task of doing adequate justice
to this super-squad which has shown
up in this, Mr. Shipkey's second year
as coach of the Papoose footballers.
To Meet Santa Ana
That time, it seems, is when the
starting cannon will blast for the
opening Papoose battle of the sea
son. It's bound to be a thriller
diller, for the worthy opponents are
none other than the fellows frohi
Santa Ana Jaysee, who enjoy the
pre-season rating of the strongest
junior college team in the southland.
Which is indeed a strong statement.
Strong Lineup
At the present time, it appears
that the starting lineup will be a
strong one: at full will be Norman
Standlee, a 207-pound gent from
Long Beach who was chosen for the
all-southern California eleven. Half
backs are to be Thor Peterson, a
very tough fellow whose opponents
would pale when he would head
their way up in Hoquiam, Washing
ton, and Bob Olden, all-city from
Los Angeles. Stan Graff, a short,
stocky quarter, hails from Oakland,
and will flip in his two-bits worth
many a time, much to the disgust of
the other team.
On the line at left end is Jim Far
quharson, who made all-city in the
nation's capital city. Which is quite
an accomplishment when one con
siders the gravy-grabbing congress
men. Next door at left tackle lives
Ed Johansen, a gentleman who
names his home as Pinole, Califor
nia, and who had little trouble in
receiving all-city honors when at
Richmond High. Left guard is John
Kerman, who hails from Los Ange
les, although he made his name as a
light fine footballer in New Jersey.
Thompson Tough
Not just another center is Jack
Thompson, from Butte, Montana. His
scoreboard says that he was all-state
for two years. Which is okay in any
language. "Chick" Orme holds down
right guard in a very capable man
ner, thank you. He's from Phoenix.
Right tackle is Bill Braheny from
Chicago, Illinois, who did all light

junior college team in the southland.
Which is indeed a strong statement.
Strong Lineup
At the present time, it appears
that the starting lineup will be a
strong one: at full will be Norman
Standlee, a 207-pound gent from
Long Beach who was chosen for the
all-southern California eleven. Half
backs are to be Thor Peterson, a
very tough fellow whose opponents
would pale when he would head
their way up in Hoquiam, Washing
ton, and Bob Olden, all-city from
Los Angeles. Stan Graff, a short,
stocky quarter, hails from Oakland,
and will flip in his two-bits worth
many a time, much to the disgust of
the other team.
On the line at left end is Jim Far
quharson, who made all-city in the
nation's capital city. Which is quite
an accomplishment when one con
siders the gravy-grabbing congress
men. Next door at left tackle lives
Ed Johansen, a gentleman who
names his home as Pinole, Califor
nia, and who had little trouble in
receiving all-city honors when at
Richmond High. Left guard is John
Kerman, who hails from Los Ange
les, although he made his name as a
light fine footballer in New Jersey.
Thompson Tough
Not just another center is Jack
Thompson, from Butte, Montana. His
scoreboard says that he was all-state
for two years. Which is okay in any
language. "Chick" Orme holds down
right guard in a very capable man
ner, thank you. He's from Phoenix.
Right tackle is Bill Braheny from
Chicago, Illinois, who did all light
for himself, being named all-state.
And at right end is Jack Cudihy
from Massachusetts. He was a very
successful captain of a likewise very
successful eleven at Kiski Prep.
The full squad is as follows:
Ends.—James Farquharson, Jack
Cudihy, Stan Charlston, Arnold Mei
ners, Robert Olden, Howard Ruth,
Jim Lincoln, Robert Lewis, Stan
Graff, Eugene Stockwell, Mario Vial,
Joseph Wilson, L. B. Harbour, Bill
Grant, Edwin Jones, Ben Berry, Bob
Ditlevsen, and Fred Taylor.
'lackles.—Edward Johansen, Roy

Barnard, John Moore, Ray Diekem

Smith, Jim McCJoud, Marius Rocle,

ert Gill, and Quentin Thompson.
Being a pretty big guy himself,
Mr. Harry Shipkey has a logical ar
gument when he says that most good
things come in large quantities. To
prove his point, Mr. Shipkey hesi
tates not one moment in aiming his
index finger in the general direction
of his pride and joy—Stanford's 1937
Papoose gridders.
These young gentlemen not only
form what is the largest frosh squad
ever to hit these parts, but what is
more, the fellows are not the slight
est bit puny. Far from it. "Mooses"
very adequately describes these big
guys who are going to pound up turf
under the able direction of their
boss, Mr. Shipkey.
Mr. Shipkey, being a charter
member of that group of men who
are categorically listed as strong and
silent, hesitates to comment on his
charges for fear of having the man
mountains turn on him. His vocabu
lary, he claims, is not up to the co
lossal task of doing adequate justice
to this super-squad which has shown
up in this, Mr. Shipkey's second year
as coach of the Papoose footballers.
To Meet Santa Ana
That time, it seems, is when the
starting cannon will blast for the
opening Papoose battle of the sea
son. It's bound to be a thriller
diller, for the worthy opponents are
none other than the fellows frohi
Santa Ana Jaysee, who enjoy the
pre-season rating of the strongest
junior college team in the southland.
Which is indeed a strong statement.
