# Business School Completed; Row Rebuilding Progresses
## 
### 
Stanford's Graduate School of Bus- j
incss moves into new $100,000 quar
ters this year. The historic old As- j
sembly Hall has been entirely re
built to make way for ultra-modern
classrooms, libraries, and offices.
The School of Biology will take
over the space formerly occupied by
the Business School. When work
started on this project June 10 !
nothing was left of the Assembly .
Hall but the stone walls and the floor
of the stage.
Three Libraries Included
Three libraries occupy the second I
floor of the building; the reserved
book room, Industrial Relations Li
brary, and the main reading room
will be at the disposal of all students
in the Graduate School of Business.
New type steel stacks with room for
40,000 volumes of the Library of the
Graduate School of Business occupy
the space between the Administra
tion Building and the old Assembly I
Hall.
Another addition to the Stanford
skyline this quarter is the massive
steel framework of the Cubberley
Educational Building. This struc
ture, the gift of Emeritus Dean El
wood Cubberley, will house the
School of Education when it is com
pleted.
Two Stories Constructed
It will be connected with the Li- !
brary by means of the present Li- |
brary arcade, and the two structures j
will harmonize perfectly. There will j
be two stories in the front part of I
the Education Building and three in ;
the rear. It will be flanked by open
court yards on the north and south, j
The facade will be covered with
sandstone in a design similar to that j
used on the Library, and the wings
on either side will be finished in j
stucco. As is the rule at Stanford,
the roof will be tiled.
To Be Air Conditioned
The new building contains an audi
torium for lectures and conferences
seating 720, complete with a balcony
and a projection room, and it will be I
air conditioned throughout. Class- !
rooms, offices, work rooms, seminn ;
rooms, and rooms equipped for rx- |
perimental child research will oc- !
cupy the rest of the building. With
the steel work complete, the pouring
of the concrete is now under way.
Finishing touches arc being ap
plied to the Farm's super-project,
