# Clayton Frye Named Farm Boxing Coach
## 
### 
Coming to Stanford by way of
Oregon State College, the Los Ange
les Athletic Club, and The Beverly
Hills Athletic Club, Clayton Frye
takes over the duties of boxing coach
on the Farm this year for the first
time.
Behind him stands an impressive
record both as a boxer and coach.
As an undergraduate at Oregon
State, he won the Oregon welter and
middleweight titles, the Pacific Coast
welterweight, Pacific Northwest
middleweight, and Nutional middle
weight collegiate crowns.
Immediately following graduation,
he served as boxing coach and
trainer of the athletic teams at his
alma mater. While there he brought
the school five of eight Pacific Coast
championships and two of his boxers
won berths on the American Olym
pic squad.

He coached at the Los Angeles
Athletic Club after leaving Oregon
and he has been physical director
for the Beverly Hills Club during
the past year.
Before him lies a tough year. To
start with he has very few out
standing men to climb into the ring
with Stanford's colors, and a definite
dearth of low-weight men His will
be a season tough enough to test
the mettle of the most experienced
coach.
John Priddle, acting instructor of
boxing last season, has been ap
pointed to the physical education
staff of Menlo Junior College, a full
time position which places him in
charge of soccer, boxing, wrestling,
and gymnasium classes.
