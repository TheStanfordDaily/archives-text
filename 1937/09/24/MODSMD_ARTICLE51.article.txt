# 'Best Since Hank' Comes to Farm
## 
### 
Don Burness, Lowell high school
graduate in June and rated the
greatest prep basketballer in San
Francisco since Hank Luisetti, has
chosen to come to Stanford, it was
announced last week.
The presence of Burness on the
Farm will assure Coach John Bunn
of a potential replacement for the
marvelous Luisetti, who plays his
last year for the Cards this winter.
Burness was a unanimous choice for
All-San Francisco center, and is a
meaty lad who looks more like a
footballer than a hoop artist, but
who was the cleverest of the San
Francisco crop this year.
