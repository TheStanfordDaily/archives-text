# Indians Ready for Santa Clara Opener
## Paulman Returns To Bolster Team Tor Bronco Game Big Red Outfit Rejuvenated for Pre-Red Game; Critics Predict Tossup 
### Gene Gear 
A thundering herd of wild Broncos, fresh from a dip in the Sugar Bowl,
will come charging into the Stanford Stadium from Santa Clara SepHeni
her 25 to test Tiny Thornhill's new improved football machine of 1937.
Coast critics rate the game a toss-up. It will be a Bronco outfit some
what weaker than last year s'team which took the Indians into camp 13-0,
and a definitely rejuvenated Big Red Machine which sputtered spasmodi
cally through last season's grid warfare.
Whereas the Cardinals struggled through last season with practically
no backfield material at all. Tiny will have four complete sets to throw
against the enemy. There won't be any prayerful passes tossed around in
the game against the Santa Clarans this year.
The Cardinal first-string line appears to be ready to hold the onslaughts
of any coast teams, but Tiny will really clutch at the remaining hairs o|i

his head if anything happens to any
of these boys, because the Cards lack
reserve strength in the line, espe
cially at the two tackle spots.
Buck Shaw, who mentored the
Broncos into the Sugar Bowl cham
pionship in his first year as head
man at the Mission village, admits
that his team might be as good as
last year if it had more experience
and greater depth. Reserves of qual
ity are lacking in both the line and
backfield.
"We lack depth at ends and half
back especially,' says Shaw, "unless
ends Jim Coughlin and Bruce Brown
are okeh after knee cartilege opera
tions."
Broncos Lose 13
Shaw lost 13 valuable lettermen
from last year's squad while Tiny
can count eight losses on the Indian
side of the ledger. Santa Clara's
losses include Dick Bassi and Li
Rogers, guards; Nello Falaschi, All-
American quarterback; Bob McGee
and Leo Artoe, tackles; Norm Fin
ney, "Mississippi" Smith, and John
Misegades, ends; Don De√üosa, Hal
Seramin, Manny Gomez, and Nick
Sanoff, halfbacks; and Joe Kelly,
center.
The Indians' loss of eight men in
clude three from last year's first
string: Cab Callaway, tackle, Earl
Hoos, quarterback; and Freddie Wil -
liams, half. Other losses are Carl
Schott and Roger Munger, ends;
John Grant and Bob Mangan, tack
les; and Don McMillan, guard.
After the first week of practice
Tiny announced that his starting
backfield array would probably read
as follows: Bill Paulman at quarter;
Ed Gamier, right half; Jimmy Cof
fis, left half; and Jim Groves, full
Standbys Back
Paulman and Coffis were 6oth
missing from the lineup in the 13-0
Bronco debacle last year. Ed Gar
nier has come in from plenty of
praise from both Tiny and Publicity
Director Don Liebendorfer. Don
claims that Gamier will be as good
a blocker as "Bones" Hamilton after
the season gets under way. Big Jim
Groves, who came to the Farm by
way of Black Foxe and San Mateo
J.C., holds the key to the Stanford
first-string backfield situation. If
Groves falls, Paulman may be
shifted to full, which would throw
everything wide open.
The old standbys will be back at
ends for the Cards. All-Coaster Jack
Clark at left end and Grant Stone at
right end. Neil Rasmussen is threat
ening Stone's securing on the start
ing lineup and Bill Willard, up from
the frosh, has moved ahead of Irv
Cummings for a crack at Clark's spot,
Zagar at Tackle
AII-American candidate Pete Za
gar will face the Broncos at left
tackle with Stan Anderson, sopho
more giant, a sure fire starter at
right tackle. Dick Shannon at right
tackle and Byron West at left tackle
are perched on the second team.
Left guard will be filled by Leoi
Ferko and big, redheaded Jack Wal
ton will probably start at right guard.
Bob Matthews, first stringer last
year, will be right behind Walton.
Frank McMillan stands ready to re
lieve Ferko.
At center is Tiny's star pupil, Tony
Calvelli, who can play any position
on any man's ball club. Last year,
because of obvious weaknesses in
the Indian backfield, Tony was
shifted to fullback. This year he is
at his best, according to Thornhill,
and should be one of the best centers
on the coast. Louis Tsoutsouvas, last
season's 60-minute man, should still
see plenty of action at the pivot po
sition.
The Stanford-Santa Clara ticket
sale is 30 per cent ahead of what it
was at this time last year. It is esti
mated that between 40,000 and 50,000
fans will see it. The record for the
game ls around 45,000,
