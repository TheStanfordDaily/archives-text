## 
### 
Stanford track and field athletics
this summer arrived at a year
around basis, with Indian colors
being carried to far parts of the
globe by Jim Reynolds, Jack Weier
hauser, and Ray Malott, stalwarts
of Dink Templeton's 1037 varsity.
The Cards started oft the summer
season by bowing for the second
straight time to U.S.C. in the N.C.-
A.A. meet at Berkeley, 50-64. Other
schools were left far behind. Weier
shauser led the local scoring by
taking seconds, in the low hurdles
and 220, while Pete Zagar and Hugh
Gribbin scored one-two in the dis
cus. Ray Malott was second to
Benke of Washington State in the
440, Reynolds was third in the shot,
and Bob Alexander ran 4:17.7 to
place 6th in the mile.
Relay Rccord Set
A week later, at Los Angeles, was
held the Big 10 meet between Coast
Conference athletes and runners of
the midwestern league. The west
won a tidy victory, with Malott,
Weiershauser, and Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy of Stanford teaming together
with Netlleson of Washington State
to win the mile relay in 3:11.8, world
record time. Malott won the quarter
this time, in 47.1. Zagar for the sec
ond week in a row won the discus.
In Milwaukee July 3rd were held
the A.A.U. championships, which
do not limit competition to college
men. Here Jack Weiershauser
achieved what may be his greatest—
a new American record of 20.9 sec
onds for the 220 around-a-curve.
This is six tenths behind the straight
away mark held by Jesse Owens.
Malott worked his victory string
into the habitual by again taking
the quarter, while Reynolds was
turned out national champion in the
shot-put with a throw of 51-8. Phil
Levy and Ray Dean, Stanford men
of a year ago, were first in the discus
and third in the 100 respectively.
At Randall's Island, New York, on
July 11 was held the National Labor
meet, at which Weiershauser, Malott,
and Reynolds all won their special
ties against strong runners of the
east coast. Shortly afterward came
the Pan American Championships in
Dallas, to which were invited lumi
naries from Latin America, together
with a limited number of United
States competitors.
Malott Cops Quarter
At the later track fest Malott was
the only Stanford man to maintain
his winning streak, again copping
the quarter, while Weiershauser
Dean, Levy, and Reynolds were all
second place men.
Soon after, the traveling bug
really dug in in earnest, with the
A.A.U. foreign trip seeing Malott
and Levy to northern Europe, and
Weiershauser and Reynolds to Ja
pan.

Dallas, to which were invited lumi
naries from Latin America, together
with a limited number of United
States competitors.
Malott Cops Quarter
At the later track fest Malott was
the only Stanford man to maintain
his winning streak, again copping
the quarter, while Weiershauser
Dean, Levy, and Reynolds were all
second place men.
Soon after, the traveling bug
really dug in in earnest, with the
A.A.U. foreign trip seeing Malott
and Levy to northern Europe, and
Weiershauser and Reynolds to Ja
pan.
Stanford track and field athletics
this summer arrived at a year
around basis, with Indian colors
being carried to far parts of the
globe by Jim Reynolds, Jack Weier
hauser, and Ray Malott, stalwarts
of Dink Templeton's 1037 varsity.
The Cards started oft the summer
season by bowing for the second
straight time to U.S.C. in the N.C.-
A.A. meet at Berkeley, 50-64. Other
schools were left far behind. Weier
shauser led the local scoring by
taking seconds, in the low hurdles
and 220, while Pete Zagar and Hugh
Gribbin scored one-two in the dis
cus. Ray Malott was second to
Benke of Washington State in the
440, Reynolds was third in the shot,
and Bob Alexander ran 4:17.7 to
place 6th in the mile.
Relay Rccord Set
A week later, at Los Angeles, was
held the Big 10 meet between Coast
Conference athletes and runners of
the midwestern league. The west
won a tidy victory, with Malott,
Weiershauser, and Captain Bill Mc-
Curdy of Stanford teaming together
with Netlleson of Washington State
to win the mile relay in 3:11.8, world
record time. Malott won the quarter
this time, in 47.1. Zagar for the sec
ond week in a row won the discus.
In Milwaukee July 3rd were held
the A.A.U. championships, which
do not limit competition to college
men. Here Jack Weiershauser
achieved what may be his greatest—
a new American record of 20.9 sec
onds for the 220 around-a-curve.
This is six tenths behind the straight
away mark held by Jesse Owens.
Malott worked his victory string
into the habitual by again taking
the quarter, while Reynolds was
turned out national champion in the
shot-put with a throw of 51-8. Phil
Levy and Ray Dean, Stanford men
of a year ago, were first in the discus
and third in the 100 respectively.
At Randall's Island, New York, on
July 11 was held the National Labor
meet, at which Weiershauser, Malott,
and Reynolds all won their special
ties against strong runners of the
east coast. Shortly afterward came
the Pan American Championships in
Dallas, to which were invited lumi
naries from Latin America, together
with a limited number of United
States competitors.
