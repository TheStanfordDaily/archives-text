# Ellington Snags Mink in Lily Pads
## 
### 
Bill Ellington, freshman track
coach, is considering going fishing
for a fur muff, according to reports
from his summer neighbors. During
his vacation, Ellington picked out a
promising trout stream, began fish
ing, and ended up by pulling in a
full grown mink.
When Bill cast his alluring fly
next to a lily pad, a couple of fish
made a rush for it, and a hungry
mink waylaid one of the fish. In the
brawl that followed, Ellington's hook
snagged the mink under the chin.
After fighting for half an hour Bill
landed the mink.
