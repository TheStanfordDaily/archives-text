### 
Plans to place California rugby on j
a major scale were formulated at a J
meeting of the California Rugby
Union in Berkeley this summer. |
Plans were made to make sports*fol- j
lowers more "rugby minded."
Arrangements were made for the :
opening of the California intercolle
giate rugby season on January 2, ;
and the Stanford-California Big
Game was moved to the Seal's Stad- !
ium in San Francisco from the local j
field. A junior college league, in- 1
eluding teams from San Mateo, Menlo
and Santa Rosa J.C.'s and from Card
and Bear Frosh was formed.
