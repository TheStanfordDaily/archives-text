# TINY'S TRIP TRIPS
## 
### 
Tiny Thornhill, the Farm's football
mentor, got part way through his
annual trip-by-trailer this summer
and had it cut short by the of
half his caravanâ€”the trailer. Some
one liked it so well that Tiny sold
it to him.
In 1929 Harold Ncwby, St. Olaf
College, Minn., scored a touchdown
on the first play in four straight
games.
