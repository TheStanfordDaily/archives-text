# Water Polo Prospects Dim For New Season
## 
### Doug Jaques 
If Stanford's varsity water polo
prospects for the 1937 season were
to be summed up in one word, that
word would be dimâ€”dim in com
parison to the dazzling light of last
year's Coast League championship
team.
Only two of Coach Nort Thornton's
varsity men from last year's squad
will be back to steer the aquatic In
dians through another tough Coast
League season and a chance at the
title again: Captain Big Bill Hanna
at sprint and high-scoring Johnny
Lamb, forward.
: Three Subs Back
Aside from these two regulars,
there are only three subs from last
year's squad, Jack Loupe, Jack Vi
bert, and Bob Allen, guards, who
will move up to varsity positions.
Bob Plato, stellar forward from last
year's frosh team, will hold down
the other forward position with the
goalie job wide open. Chief candi
dates for that job will be Cameron
Hall, Bill Burns, Hank Aldrich,
Lloyd Wilson, and Frank Dowling.
From the swimming team, ace
sprinter Dick Clarke comes to threat
en Bob Allen's position at guard, and
Dick Hoover, young brother of last,
years captain and star, Bob Hoo
ver, comes up from the frosh squad
as another outstanding guard, and
may replace either Allen or Vibert
at that position.
Along with second-string forwards
! Bill Bleecker, Jack Wilson, and Jack
| Read, Coach Thornton will have
Marvin Blackburn and Gene Gear,
i guards, to complete his potential
i line-up.
U.S.C. Strong
As for this season's schedule,
! Coach Thornton says, "our stifTest
competition will be from U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. The Trojans have decided
it is high time to begin to do some
: thing about the water polo situation.
"They are tired of ending up every
I year in the cellar position, so they
have secured Ed Bittke, a former
S.C. star, as coach. He was on the
S.C. swimming team the same time I
; competed for Stanford. Bittke is
really a student of the game and will
put forth strong water polo teams
from S.C. in the future.
"However, California must always
< be reckoned with, as A1 Dowdcn, the
Cal coach, has a definite way of de
: velooine lireat teams."
