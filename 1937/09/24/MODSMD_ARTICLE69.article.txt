LOS ANGELES.â€”Coach Howard
Jones found plenty of good ball
carrying material on hand when the

The list includes seven quarter
backs, four fullbacks, and six half
backs who have shown ability in
pigskin lugging either on past Tro
jan varsity or freshmen teams.
Heading the list is Ambrose
(Amby) Schindlcr, hard driving,
175-pound signal caller, who is ex
pected to get first call on the triple
threat quarterback berth.
