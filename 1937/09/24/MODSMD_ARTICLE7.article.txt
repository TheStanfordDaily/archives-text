## 
### 
New Stanford students will be
greeted in the Chapel at 11 o'clock,
October 3, at the annual matricula
tion service by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dean Mary Yost, Dean
George B. Culver, and Dr. Elton D.
Trueblood, chaplain.
Freshmen particularly are urged

Summer after summer the Row
rebuilds. The Greeks spent more
than $160,000 this year reconstruct
ing and repairing fraternity and so
sorority houses.
Most opulent of the new mansions
is the Deke house. An old Univer
sity rule states that the original
foundations must be used whenever
a house is rebuilt, but the Dekes
tore down everything else. The ex
terior of the $37,500 structure was
designed to preserve the spirit of
the old house by Architect Gardner
1 Dailey. It follows a modified Colo
nial tradition with a white wooden
finish, shingled gabled roof, large
bay windows, and brick terraces,
wails, and trimming.
Beta House Rebuilt
The Beta House was completely
rebuilt this summer at a cost of $28,-
000. Returning Rowmen will notice
its stately neo-classic columned port
ico and white stucco walls designed
by John Branner. The work will not
be finished by the start of school,
but the contractor, George Wagnei
j states that he plans to put more men
[ to work completing the house in a
J short time.
Alpha Delta Phi has gone in for
elaborate remodeling to the tutfe of
$20,000. The old classical-columned
front porch has been removed and
a simpler colonial entrance substi
tuted. The exterior has been re-
I painted, and a new wing has been
added to the rear of the house.
Phi Kaps Improve
The Phi Kappa Sigmas will find
1 $25,000 worth of additions and im
j provements on their house when they
return to the Farm. The Alvarado
1 Row manse will accommodate ten
j more men in two new wings and a
j new third floor.
Up on the hill the Sigma Nu house
had a third floor added to it this
year.
One Sorority Rebuilds
The Alpha Omicron Pi's spent $13,-
000 for a terrace on the rear of their
' house, new steps, and enlarging the
I downstairs rooms. This was the only
sorority to do any rebuilding this
summer.
Other fraternities with new addi
tions to greet the returning brothers
include Alpha Sigma Pi, Phi Delta
Theta, Theta Delta Chi, Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Phi Gamma Delta, Theta
Xi, and A.T.O.

One Sorority Rebuilds
The Alpha Omicron Pi's spent $13,-
000 for a terrace on the rear of their
' house, new steps, and enlarging the
I downstairs rooms. This was the only
sorority to do any rebuilding this
summer.
Other fraternities with new addi
tions to greet the returning brothers
include Alpha Sigma Pi, Phi Delta
Theta, Theta Delta Chi, Alpha Kappa
Lambda, Phi Gamma Delta, Theta
Xi, and A.T.O.
New Stanford students will be
greeted in the Chapel at 11 o'clock,

Wilbur, Dean Mary Yost, Dean
George B. Culver, and Dr. Elton D.
Trueblood, chaplain.

Summer after summer the Row
rebuilds. The Greeks spent more
than $160,000 this year reconstruct
ing and repairing fraternity and so
sorority houses.
Most opulent of the new mansions
is the Deke house. An old Univer
sity rule states that the original
foundations must be used whenever
a house is rebuilt, but the Dekes
tore down everything else. The ex
terior of the $37,500 structure was
designed to preserve the spirit of
the old house by Architect Gardner
1 Dailey. It follows a modified Colo
nial tradition with a white wooden
finish, shingled gabled roof, large
bay windows, and brick terraces,
wails, and trimming.
Beta House Rebuilt
The Beta House was completely
rebuilt this summer at a cost of $28,-
000. Returning Rowmen will notice
its stately neo-classic columned port
ico and white stucco walls designed
by John Branner. The work will not
be finished by the start of school,
but the contractor, George Wagnei
j states that he plans to put more men
