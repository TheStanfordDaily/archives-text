# Swim Stars Face Bright Season
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that various
citizens have doubts about the pos
sible success of Stanford's football
team, the water polo squad, and the
basketball team, Stanford's coach
Nort Thornton wears just the trace
of a smile on his passive face these
days. Because he knows that Stan
ford will have one of the strongest,
if not the strongest, swimming team
on the coast this year.
Led by Dave Rider, national dis
tance star, Thornton will have most
of his last year's championship team

back, stronger this year by virtue of
a stifT season of competition. Out
standing aquarians who will be
counted on to pile up the points for
the Indians are: Dick Clark, big,
speedy, junior sprinter; Harold
Weatherbe, swimming backstroke for
his second year; Don Towne, breast
stroke flash; Winfield Needham, who
swims the distances with Rider; Jack
Vibert, sprinter; backslroker Jack
Read, and John Brahtz, a junior
transfer from Cal Tech who is rated
as sensational, no less.

Roy Winkleman, Stanford's only
; diver, comes back for his second
year on the Farm varsity to again
lead all other Pacific Coast divers in
the graceful and intricate art of fall
ing off a high board into a pool of
water. That Stanford is fortunate in
having Mr. Winkleman to bring in
meet points is proved by the state
ment of diving coach Ernst Brand
sten, who predicts that Winkleman
will be diving in the 1940 Olympics
â€”if, of course, there are any Olym
pics in 1940.
