PULLMAN, Wash. —Coach Babe
Hollingberry of the Washington
State Cougars picks Washington to
win the conference title this year, as
well he might, for it was chiefly the
1936 Husky reserves (the varsity of
this year) that pounded out that 40-0
win over Washington State last year
in the game that decidcd the cham
pionship.
The Cougar mentor rates Southern
California second, California third,
and Oregon State and U.C.L.A. on a
par for fourth.
