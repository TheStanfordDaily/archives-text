i WHEN FOOTBALL COMES
IT MOVES RIGHT ON
If you'll pardon the use of several hackneyed phrases always found on
i a sports page along about this time of year, we'll toll you that King Foot
' ball has been ushered onto the Farm amid the customary din of the
! cleated boot on the lush turf.
For the time being at least, every Stanford sporting fan will forget all
about the Davis Cup, Ryder Cup, America's Cup, Wightmun Cup, and the
Messrs. Dimaggio, Budge, Farr, etc., to turn their attention to Big Chief
Tiny ThoiTihiH's gridiron extravaganza of 1937.
Everybody, including the head man, is looking for a brighter season for
, the Big Red Machine which sputtered over the football roads ol 1936 with
everything from fiat tires to a leaky gas tank.
PAULMAN HEADS VAST
CREW OF BACKFIELD TALENT
Tiny's 1937 edition has been strengthened by the addition of that man
of destiny, William Paulman, who should go great guns at the quarterback
spot for the Cards. Paulman's punting ability alone will provide the In
dians with a strong weapon lacking last year. With Paulman booting the
j pigskin down the field, and little Jimmy Tom Coflis running back enemy
punts, what more could a coach ask for in the punting department'
Card coaches have so much backfield materiaf galloping around on the
j practice field these days they re beginning to stumble oyer them. When
j Tiny is asked to name his first four backfields, he has to ponder for quite
a while before he can remember all the names in the sizeable list of
candidates.
Last year the Card mentor didn't have much to worry about along this
line—live or six names would cover the whole backfield situation. Tiny's
first-string backs line up with Big Jiin Groves at fullback, Paulman at
| quarter, Ed Garnier at right half, and Jimmy Coffis at left half.
After a bit of head scratching Tiny comes up with a second choice for
his backfield and places Glenn Hamilton at full, Gene Coldiron at quarter,
Bill Kirsch at light half, and Pete Fay, left half.
It takes Tiny a while longer to gather up his faculties and produce a
third backfield. Finally he comes up with Jake Brigham at lull, Al Alustiza
at quarter, Joe Vigna, right half, and Chad Reade, left half.
And believe it or not even the fourth outfit brings forth familiar
such as Chet Patton at full, Rod Parker at quarter, Howard Hickingbotham,
right half, and Mat-Murray or Jerry Sparling, left half.
A glance at these four teams shows that Tiny has so many backfield
men of ability on the brain that he has completely forgotten Doc Luckett,
a capable quarterback on any man's team. Luckett right now looks to be
second-string.
LINE SUBSTITUTES
NOT SO PLENTIFUL
This brilliant display of ball packing material will have a solid first
string wall to pave the way, but when the first-string line needs a little
relief Tiny may be somewhat pressed for capable subs.
During the first week of practice the Card mentor is pretty well deter
mined as to his first-string line, which will be composed of Jack Clark
and Grant Stone at ends; Pete Zagar and Stan Anderson at tackles; Leo
Ferko and Jack Walton at guards; and Tony Calvelli at center.
Bob Matthews, the stocky little guard, has been shoved onto the second
team by Walton, and Iron Man Tsoutsouvas has been replaced by Calvelli.
Don't count those two out, they'll be forcing Walton and Calvelli all sea
son and may yet land back in their old spots.
CAL IX>ST LAST SEASON,
BUT HEP TO WHEREABOUTS NOW
Cal looks like the top money team this season, with some of the smart
money boys putting in a warning about Washington. Cal was rated near
the top at the beginning of the 1936 season, but it took them nearly the
whole season to find themselves. This year the Bears will probably find
themselves before they step into Memorial Coliseum for their first struggle
of the season with those toughies from Moraga—the Galloping Gaels of
St. Mary's.
Stanford is perhaps the most underrated team on the_ coast. Sports
writers from border to border don't give the Big Red Machine much of a
chance —oh, yes improved, but no match for teams like Cal, Washington,
and U.S.C. If you've been worrying over Stanford's chances because o
these reports, just calm down and prepare to watch a Cardinal team win
a few ball games and generally conduct itself like a grid team to fear.
The Indians won't take back their lease on the Rose Bowl this year, but
we look for them to finish among the top four of the conference.
