# Assembly To Give Theater Formal Start
## Dr. Wilbur Will Address All â€“ University Meet Tomorrow Morning 
### 
Stanford's Memorial Hall will have
its long-awaited formal opening to
morrow morning when President
Ray Lyman Wilbur addresses an all-
University assembly of both faculty
and students.
Set for 11 o'clock, the assembly
will mark the inauguration of the
new auditorium as general meeting
place of the University community.
Planned as Memorial
Although summer quarter students
had a preview of the Hall when
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" was
presented there in August, a ma
jority of the Stanford student body
will have its first opportunity to
inspect the new building and its
equipment.
Center of the University construc
tion program for the last year, the
Hall was designed as a memorial to
those who died in service and as a
tribute to others who served in the
World War. The 77 Stanford men
and women who gave their lives and
whose names make up the Roll of
Honor in the lobby of the Hall will
be honored at a memorial service on
October 24. Stanford war records
give the names of more than 3,000
men and women who served in the
Great War.
Official Opening
Equipped with the most modern
stage facilities, Memorial Hall will
have its official theatrical opening
when the first fall play is produced
late in October, although both the
main auditorium and the little the
ater were used in connection with
the Summer Drama Festival this
year.
Tomorrow's program will replace
the usual welcoming assembly, since
entering freshmen already have been
greeted by President Wilbur during
the pre-reg period.
