# Millions Cheer Duce in Berlin
## Hitler, Mussolini Parade For Roaring Crowds 
### 
BERLIN, Sept. 27 (U.R).—Reichs
fuehrer Adolf Hitler brought his
Fascist friend, Premier Benito Mus
solini, into Berlin tonight along a
triumphal route where millions
roared greetings of Nazi "Heils" and
Italian "Vivas."
Hitler, glorying in a spectacle more
flamboyant than anything ever
staged by a Hohenzollern, smiled
broadly and threw up his arm in
sweeping salutes as he rode at II
Duce's side down Unter den Linden
through Brandenburg Gate.
Persons living along the route
opened their windows at the risk of
arrest. No one was allowed on roof
tops. Officers by the hundreds
moved among the tightly packed
crowds. Owners of buildings were
warned against admitting strangers
to their premises and many persons
were asked to produce credentials
before they were permitted to ob
tain points of vantage.
The former palace of President
Paul von Hindenberg in the Wil
helmstrasse—ll Duce's home during
his visit of state—was guarded night
and day both inside and without by
storm troopers. Mussolini was the
first man to occupy the presidential
palace since Hindenburg died three
years ago.
Tomorrow Hitler and Mussolini
will make speeches at Olympic Sta
dium, inviting the world to join them
in preserving peace but at the same
time warning of their joint might
on land, sea, and in the air against
the menace of Bolshevism.
