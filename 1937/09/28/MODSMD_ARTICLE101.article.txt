Concentrating on the weaknesses
that appeared in the Santa Clara
game, Stanford varsity griddcrs
went through a long session of punt
ing, blocking, tackling, and charging
yesterday on the practice field.
Coach Tiny Thornhill will begin
planning a line-up for the trip to
Eugene to meet Oregon Saturday
during a scrimmage this afternoon,
beginning at 3:30.
Nearly every varsity candidate
went through a hard workout with
the tackle dummies, after which
linemen and backs separated to
practice their weak points.
Linemen Develop Charge
Linemen gathered in groups of
three and practiced two more
blocking and charging plays for most
of the afternoon.

Greatest concentration in the
backfield was on punting. Bill Paul

Sunday in the hospital with a throat
infection. He was bothered by a
slight remaining cold, which should
be gone Saturday.
Pete Zagar, who was just released
from the hospital after losing 15
pounds because of stomach trouble
and Saturday's heat, took practice
easy. He has not completely regained
his weight, and is still feeling weak.
Walton O.K. Again
Jack Walton was completely re
covered after a slight throat infec
tion that had kept him in the hospi
tal. Ed Garnier, who is out of the
hospital, was kept from practice with
an ankle that is still too bad to use.
Irv Cummings was still out with a
cold.
Stanford gridders will meet a
squad of 15 returning lettermen
when they take on the University
of Oregon Saturday. Both teams wiil
be fighting hard after losses the
week before, the Oregon men hav
ing bowed to U.C.L.A. in Los An
geles, 26-13.
