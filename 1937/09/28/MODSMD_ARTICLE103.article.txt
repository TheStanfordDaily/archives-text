INDIANS TURN
TO DUCK HUNTING
Yes, we all saw the collapse of th
Indian roadster when it ran into
tough hombre from Santa Clar
called Bronco Benny, but don't be
gin to climb off the Red steamrolle
just yet.
The steamroller didn't have quiti
enough steam last Saturday after
noon, hence it didn't do much roll
ing, but this Saturday duck hunting
season opens up in the wilds of Ore
gon and Stanford fans should see .
rejuvenated bunch of Cardinal grid
iron warriors climb onto the steam
roller for the first Stanford Confer
ence game of the season against the
University of Oregon Webfeet.
Stanford was excelled in every de
partment of the game by the Broncos
except in the air. Tiny thinks the
( ''oys should have opened up with
rnc rc P assin £ earlier in the game
jVj a y *h e score would have been a
little u lifferent -
TO BE c >R , GA NIZED ,
FOR ORFa. on
The Stanfo." d ou tfit cnn't help but
be a better orgc niz ed be inch of grid
sters when they line up against
Prink Callison's W'.ebfent this Sat
urday.
In the first place, Bill P aulman will
probably be in th/-=re patching and
kicking. Right now .he's in the hos
pital suffering from a th ''oat infec
tion. The Cards will Blonde
Bill's punting this year. Bill only
got out one good kick a; 1 , the
Broncos before he went on t in the
first quarter, but he was a pretty
sick boy.
In the second place, the T ndian
tackling and blocking should b - far
superior to the ragged exhibition
turned in Saturday. This writi >rs
humble opinion is that one serin
mage was not enough to prepare thv'
team for actual tackling and block- ,
ing under fire. The Indian backs will
probably have real interference pav
ing the way for them.
In the third place, jittery opening
game mistakes will probably be
erased. Mistakes were made even by
the most seasoned of veterans in the
Bronco game —costly mistakes, too.
Little Jimmy Tom Coffis dropped the
ball in Stanford territory and at
tempted to pick it up on the dead
run "instead of dropping on the pig
skin. That paved the way for the
second touchdown.
The first Santa Clara touchdown
was made possible when Neil Ras
mussen, Indian left end, thought only
of getting down under a punt and
didn't figure on Jesse Coffer and
Tony Mazzina of the Broncos to
come crashing through to block
Hamilton's kick in the end zone.
Then Tony Calvelli intercepted
that Bronco pass deep in Cardinal
territory on a fourth down, instead
of knocking it down. The Stanfords
lost 20 yards there.
CARELESS
THROUGHOUT
All through the game the Indians
gave the impression of being highly
disorganized. Things should be dif
ferent in weeks to come. On paper
the Cards really have a ball club.
The boys didn't seem to be sure
of themselves in Saturday's opener.
The line wasn't charging at all; the
backs were slow in starting; and the
whole team seemed a wee bit hazy
on their signals—the team, lacking
organization, lacked fire.
An interesting sidelight on the
game is the cast of Acting Captain
Grant Stone, the Indians' right end.
With one minute to play in the game
Stone caught Glenn Hamilton's 15-
yard pasfe and scampered through a
broken field 35 yards to score.
There arc two versions of Mr.
Stone's dash into pay dirt. Fans up
in the stands claim Mr. Stone looked
like a frightened antelope and that
he wanted to get rid of that old pig
skin as soon as possible. Sounder
reasoning, however, comes from his
fraternity brothers who claim he
learned that fake lateral he used in
his scoring run in touch football on
the Row last spring.
Any way you look at»it, it was a
pretty sweet run and chalked up six
big points on the Indian side of the
ledger. Incidentally, the best Indian
blocking of the afternoon was turned
in at that time to aid Stone.
Every player on the field Saturday
(including those mammoth squads
from the Berkeley Rotary and Lions
clubs) agreed unanimously that it
was very, very hot. The Stadium
was like an oven as the thermometer
nearly reached the 100 mark. Tiny's
Indians lost eight to ten pounds per
man.
