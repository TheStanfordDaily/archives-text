Harry Maloney is optimistic about
the prospects of this year's soccer
season, as he announces the begin
ning of practice Thursday.
"We have good schedules for both
the Varsity and frosh, and I think
we should have a good turnout,"
Maloney said. "We need any fresh
men who are interested in athletics
and haven't gone out for any other
sport."
This year, as usual, the season,
which begins on October 16, will be
climaxed for both squads with the
two games with Cal on the Saturday
before and the Saturday morning of
the Big Game.
