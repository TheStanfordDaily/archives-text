### (By United Press 
Taking both ends of a double
header from Boston, the New York
Giants gained another half-game
on Chicago yesterday and just about
wound up the National League base
ball race.
The Gothamites triumphed 5-4 and
3-1. Chicago defeated Cincinnati,
7-4, but dropped to four and one
half games behind, with only six
games remaining on its schedule.
New York plays nine more.

In the American, Philadelphia
and Boston split a doubleheader, the
Red Sox taking the first, 6-2, and
the A's getting the six-inning night
cap, 6-0.
Jimmy Foxx, Boston first base
man, hit his 35th and 36th homers,
putting him eight behind Joe Di
Maggio.
Detroit bested Cleveland, 2-1.
Other teams were idle.
