# Santa Ana J.C. Nips Papooses 12-7 in Opener
## Southland Team Passes Young Cards Dizzy; Frosh Show Promise 
### 
A burly Santa Ana Jaysee bunch
pushed the Stanford freshmen around
a wee bit Saturday afternoon in de
feating them 12-7 here in a prelimi
nary to the Santa Clara tilt.
As the score indicates, the game
was in doubt much of the time, and
the lead changed a couple of times.
Coach Harry Shipkey's Papooses
showed evidence of their short train
ing period to date, and showed need
of more work on offensive plays, to
gether with a lack of defensive
punch. The hot weather did them
no good.
The Jaysee men held the upper
hand in most of the first half, run
ning about two plays to the Indian's
one.
Santa Anans Score
But in the second quarter the cat
moved in for the kill. Co-Captain
Bob Youell passed the ball down the
r \v\d to both ends and the quarter
back, Co-Captain Bill McCarter ad
vancing the ball thirty yards to Stan
ford's twenty where it was lost. Then
by blocking a kick and again work
ing their passing attack, Santa Ana
finally worked the ball close enough
to the goal for John Mcßeall to
plunge over for a touchdown.
The third quarter was a dull repe
tition of the first half until late in
the third period. A twenty-yard pass
from fullback Norm Standlee to end
Jack Cudihy, and a twenty-yard run
by halfback Quentin Thompson
brought the pigskin to Santa Ana's
7-yard marker. Inspired for the first
time, Stanford's line opened up a
hole for hard-hitting Standlee to
plunge through for the tying six
points. Standlee's place kick was
good.
Line Slows Up
Stanford's line in the fourth quar
ter decreased its charge, and Santa
Ana again passed over Stanford to
score again. This time a pass from
Youel to McCarter in a corner of
the safety zone did the trick. Stan
ford's frosh could do nothing more
in the remaining minutes of the
game to change the resulting 12-7
score.
Long Beach's Norm Standlee
proved that he is the kind of a full
back Tiny Thornhill will be looking
for next year. He is not fast, but is
a smooth and hard-hitting runner,
"f is the only passer on the team,
■and a good passer. He did all the
kicking Saturday, and his kicks were
good, though with slow getaway.
Thompson Speedy
Quentin Thompson is the closest
thing the fi'osh have to a safety man,
and his speed should take him
places. The highly touted kicker,
Thor Peterson, still hasn't been
tested; the Card yearlings may be
stronger when he's playing.
But the fact that Stanford's frosh
didn't come up to par Saturday
doesn't prove too much. It's hard
for eleven men who have never
played together before to play as a
team in their first game. Next Sat
urday they may look like a new
bunch against Modesto J.C.
