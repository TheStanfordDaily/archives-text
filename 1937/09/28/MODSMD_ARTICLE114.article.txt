# Templeton Versatility Gives Screen the Axe
## 
### BY HARRY PRESS 
It seems that Mr. Dink Templeton
is a very versatile guy.
It is not enough for Mr. Temple
ton to be one of the top-notch track
coaches of the country. Now he is
poking out a script on Hollywood's
typewriters. What is more, he is an
important fellow, for he gets an as
sistant who is helping Mr. Temple
ton at the keyboards of the tripe
writers. So it is very evident that
our Mr. Templeton is quite a potent
Joe in Hollywood town.
Birth of an Idea
The wise boys at the studios owned
by Messrs. Metro, Goldwyn and
Mayer are of the idea that a flickie

which involves the lives of the boys
who spend their time in runs and
jumps all over a large field while
wearing very short breeches will be
of great interest to those of the
sports public who patronize the cine
ma nowadays. Since they are de
siring only the best of talent to
take over the technical matters of
the picture, they are immediately
signing up Mr. Templeton, who with
out doubt is very talented.
Now it seems that Hollywood is
the home of some very brainy per
sons who are being called yes-men.
One of these yessers is having one
day a very brilliant idea. So he is
telling Messrs. Metro Goldwyn and
Mayer that since we are having Mr.
Templeton along for the ride as tech
nical scenario writer, it is indeed a
good plan to be basing this story
about the great institution, Stan
ford, and its rival, California. So it
is, say Messrs. M., G. and M.
The Idea Grows Up
So the boys are getting together
with Mr. Templeton, and soon a con
coction is emerging which has to
do with the Stanfords and the Cali
fornias, although the names in the
picture are not being Stanford and
California. What is more, there is
also a fellow in the picture who is
instructing the boys their runs and
jumps. It is, however, nothing more
than a coincidence that this fellow
is resembling Mr. Templeton.
It is no harm in telling that Messrs.
M., G. and M. are very smart fel
lows, since they are including an in
cident which is being similar to a
certain Axe which is once causing
a great deal of trouble between the
Stanfords and the Califomias.
It is indeed a tough job to be wait
ing for Mr. Templeton's work of art.
