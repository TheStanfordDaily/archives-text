# Loss of Five Seniors Hits Track Chances
## Malott, Quarter – miler, Returns with Bright Record for Summer 
### BY PHIL KLAUBER 
j How will Stanford be in track
this season?
That's easy. They've been asking
that in September for years; the out
look has always been the same—dis
mal, and the final results have always
been the same—class. In fact, they
are frequently even the money,
U.S.C. notwithstanding.
Coach Dink Templeton seems to
delight in being responsible for the
above inconsistency; he never has
much to start with, but always does
enough work with what green stuff
he has to make the railbirds at least
murmur.
Lost by Graduation
Those graduating are, Captain Bill
McCurdy, half miler, Bob Alexander,
miler, Jack Weiershauser, sprints and
low-hurdles, Jim Reynolds, shot-put,
and Norman Morrisori, high jump.
Johnny Hewitt, hurdler, has not yet
decided to return to school.
On the other hand, coming up
from the Frosh are enough perhaps,
to offset the above debit: Co-Cap
tains Dick Simpson and Ray Brown,
hurdler and bi'oad-jumper respec
tively, will develop into the finest
Stanford has seen in these events
in some time. Russell Wulff broke the
Little Big Meet high jump record
last season by leaping 6-4, and has
only begun to learn the trade.
YVeightman Andersen
Stan Andersen in the weights and
Barney Ferguson in the 880 are
others that should be heard from;
Andersen was winner in the Little
Big Meet with a mark of 145 feet.
Those of the veterans that will
lead the pack next time are led
by Ray Malott, quarter-miler, who
by his 47 second efforts of last
spring and the summer European
season gives promise of getting on
the books with Eastman. Malott
arrives on the campus from Europe
tomorrow, and will start his fall
training with the 1937 season but
a few weeks past.
Pete Zagar, discus champ at the
N.C.A.A. who has touched 159 feet,
will be back there better than ever
as soon as football is over, and will
be ably backed up by Hugh Gribbin,
who frequently defeated him over
150 feet last spring. The weight
corps, always a Stanford stronghold,
will be further fortified by Arnold
Cornett, discus, and Montgomery,
Hucklebridge, and Lipman, shot
putters.
J.C. Record Holder
BiH Wohle, who set an American
J.C. record of 51 feet % inch in the
shot put at San Mateo last season,
will enter Stanford today, but will
not be eligible to compete until
1939. Wohle is also a boxer and
football man.
Duke Gill and Vic Boore will re
turn to keep the pole vault ranks
full, while Hank Luisetti will be
useful in the high jump. Hiserman
and Carew will be back to work
in the sprint division: Hiserman is
holder of one leg on the world rec
ord 880 yard relay team.
Mahurin, March Return
Carl Mahurin, a steady 1:56 man
last year, will lead the 880 strength,
while Rusty March, two-year letter

man, should be Stanford's main
strength in the mile. The two mile
should be well taken care of by
Edson Burrows, who hit 9:23 in his
sophomore year, and was deterred
last season by a broken ankle. Bill
Hawkins is returning to run the
hui'dles.
Walker, Brownton, Hardin, and
Shaw all may be javelin luminaries,
and Leo Madlem, letterman, will re
turn for another broad-jump season.
Registration will start immediately
for all track men, and the full-prac
tice season will begin as soon as uni
forms can be issued.
