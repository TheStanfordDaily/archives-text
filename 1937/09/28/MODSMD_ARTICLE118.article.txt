# Nations Fans Dazed By Football Openers
## 
### 
It's here again—can ya take it?
Moving into lightning action on all
fronts this week-end was the nation's
first dose of football. And a mighty
stiff dose it was. As he walked out
of the country's many stadia, John
Fan walked a wee bit unsteadily,
for an afternoon of dazzling, power
house grid tactics had left him with
out much of a leg to stand on.
California, consensus choice to
walk away with the coast crown,
surprised even Bear rooters with a
slashing machine that ripped through
a supposedly strong St. Mary's team,
30-7. It soon turned into a serni
farce, with Stub Allison sending into
action a staggering total of 41 men,
all of whom had little trouble claw
ing the Gaels into very passive sub
mission.
Passes and potent marches down
field paved a very smooth road for
Howard Jones' Trojans in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, where College
of Pacific was severely slapped in
the face, 40-0. Amby Schindler, flash
backfield star, started things off with
a sensational 64-yard slashing run
back of a punt to Troy's first score.
Again it was passes that won a
ball game, 14-0, for defending champs
Washington, over the Hawkeyes from
lowa. Captain Fritz Waskowitz was
on the throwing end both times, and
the heaves were good for 47 and 27
yards in the second and fourth peri
ods, respectively.
Cougars Tie Gonzaga
Gonzaga had its win streak broken
by Washington State's Cougars, who
slipped in a scoreless tie on the Bull
dogs. The game went, to the air in
the first quarter, but passes were
inaccurate.

Oregon State, picked by many to
be in the money when the season's
totals are added, was knocked for a
very wide loop when Idaho's Van
dals pulled an upset, 7-0, with a last
minute rally.
Panther's Tough
Going back east, it sems that Jock
Sutherland's Golden Panthers are
just as strong as they were last New
Year's Day in the Rose Bowl. The
boys from Pitt gave ample evidence
of their famed power in a trampling
win, 59-0, over Ohio Wesleyan.
Inevitably, Minnesota breaks into
headlines with a "better-than-ever"
team. And, just as inevitably, they
deserve the title. Bernie Beirman's
Gophers opened their 1937 season
with a smashing powerhouse victory
over North Dakota State, 69-7. Led
by Andy Uram, who scored twice,
the Gophers paraded ten touchdowns
across the Bison goal.
Which is indeed enough scoring
for one week-end.

totals are added, was knocked for a
very wide loop when Idaho's Van
dals pulled an upset, 7-0, with a last
minute rally.
Panther's Tough
Going back east, it sems that Jock
Sutherland's Golden Panthers are
just as strong as they were last New
Year's Day in the Rose Bowl. The
boys from Pitt gave ample evidence
of their famed power in a trampling
win, 59-0, over Ohio Wesleyan.
Inevitably, Minnesota breaks into
headlines with a "better-than-ever"
team. And, just as inevitably, they
deserve the title. Bernie Beirman's
Gophers opened their 1937 season
with a smashing powerhouse victory
over North Dakota State, 69-7. Led
by Andy Uram, who scored twice,
the Gophers paraded ten touchdowns
across the Bison goal.
Which is indeed enough scoring
for one week-end.
It's here again—can ya take it?
Moving into lightning action on all
fronts this week-end was the nation's
first dose of football. And a mighty
stiff dose it was. As he walked out
of the country's many stadia, John
Fan walked a wee bit unsteadily,
for an afternoon of dazzling, power
house grid tactics had left him with
out much of a leg to stand on.
California, consensus choice to
walk away with the coast crown,
surprised even Bear rooters with a
slashing machine that ripped through
a supposedly strong St. Mary's team,
30-7. It soon turned into a serni
farce, with Stub Allison sending into
action a staggering total of 41 men,
all of whom had little trouble claw
ing the Gaels into very passive sub
mission.
Passes and potent marches down
field paved a very smooth road for
Howard Jones' Trojans in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, where College
of Pacific was severely slapped in
the face, 40-0. Amby Schindler, flash
backfield star, started things off with
a sensational 64-yard slashing run
back of a punt to Troy's first score.
Again it was passes that won a
ball game, 14-0, for defending champs
Washington, over the Hawkeyes from
lowa. Captain Fritz Waskowitz was
on the throwing end both times, and
the heaves were good for 47 and 27
yards in the second and fourth peri
ods, respectively.
Cougars Tie Gonzaga
Gonzaga had its win streak broken
by Washington State's Cougars, who
slipped in a scoreless tie on the Bull
dogs. The game went, to the air in
the first quarter, but passes were
inaccurate.

Oregon State, picked by many to
be in the money when the season's
totals are added, was knocked for a
very wide loop when Idaho's Van
dals pulled an upset, 7-0, with a last
minute rally.
