# Paly Subway Project Still Awaits Okah
## 
### 
Plans for a subway at the intersec
tion of University Avenue and the
Southern Pacific Railway tracks are
being considered by the State High
way Division engineer, according to
Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller. The proposal is being
studied with the view of combining
the railroad underpass with a sub
way under El Camino Real.
Most of the expense of the project
will be borne by the Federal govern
ment. Three hundred thousand dol
lars from a Federal Bureau of Roads
fund, administered by the State of
California, will finance construction.
The city of Palo Alto will pay for the
necessary rights of way and for any
liabilities.
As the right of way involves land
owned by the University, plans must
be approved by the trustees. The
board has given tentative approval
of the proposal, but has indicated
that it disapproves of any plan that
would change the University en
trance on El Camino Real.
The project would involve moving
the railroad tracks from 70 to 80
feet west of their present position,
and elevating them about five feet of
the University Avenue intersection.
The underpass would have four ve
hicular lanes and a bridge over Alma
Street. The ramp of the structure
would start at the edge of the Circle.
In their present form plans do not
alter property rights on Alma Street
or on the Circle.
