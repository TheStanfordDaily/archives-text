# Ten Baseball Veterans Back For '38 Squad
## Wolter Expects Strong Pitchers, Fielders; Catcher Spot Is Open 
### BY DAVE SWANBERG 
With a team well fortified with
veterans, Stanford's baseball team
faces the 1938 season with a bright
outlook.
Coach Harry Wolter has capable
men returning to fill the majority
of positions. Two spots, however,
should cause Wolter some concern.
The services of catcher Leo Heag
erty, who went to the Boston Red
Sox, will be missed, and the failure
of Leonard Linde to return to school
will leave the third base job vacant.
On the bright side of the ledger,
Wolter will have two fine pitchers
in Spike Furman and Neil Rasmus
sen. Dick Tam and Captain George
Farrell will probably resume their
duties at second and third respec
tively.
Six Outfielders
Six lettermen from the outfield
are expected to be on hand. They
are Dick LaFranchi, Wally deWitt,
Dick Ilanna, Glenn Hamilton, Jimmy
Coffis, and Tom Killefer.
One of these will probably be
switched to first base to fill the
shoes of last year's captain, Red
Holman. Members of last year's
freshmen team, one of the strongest
in recent years, and junior college
transfers are expect to give their
more experienced teammates a lot
of competition.
Practice will get under way as
soon as Coach Harry Wolter settles
down from a trip to the east. In
the fall quarter practice will be held
only three times a week, and not
until next January will the strenu
ous practice session begin.
Practice Together
Freshmen and the varsity squads
will practice together this fall at the
Sunken Diamond. Wolter urges all
those interested in baseball to come
and tryout for the team.
Last year, Stanford finished third
behind California and U.S.C. in the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association, with eight wins against
seven defeats. Stanford swept the
Santa Clara series three straight
and defeated St. Mary's two games to
one. U.S.C., California, and U.C.L.A.,
however, all won their three game
series with the Indians. All games
that Stanford lost, except two, were
extremely close contests.
