# New Grid Rules Put into Effect
## Pass Interference Law Change Significant 
### 
When eleven distinct representa
tives 011 the Football Rules Com
mittee got together this summer to
decide on policies to be followed by
referees during the 1937 grid season,
they made several changes in last
year's rules.
Most significant among the changes
concerns interference with a pass
receiver. Physical contact with the
receiver, no matter how severe, will
not be construed as interference if
the defensive playr is making an
honest effort to catch or bat down
the ball.
Hereafter, a kickoff out of bounds
will not be taken over; the ball
will be placed on the ~ 5-yard line
instead. The rule is intended to
avoid kicking out of bounds.
"Block that kick" needs no longer
ring out from the rooting section,
because, according to the new rules,
the offensive can pick up the blocked
kick and run it over for the con
version point.
Two new, less important rules go
into effect with the 1937 season.
Players are no longer required to
wear numerals on both sides of
their jerseys, and no longer will
officials keep track of substitutions.
Each coach will be on his honor to
put in new players complying with
the substitution rule.
