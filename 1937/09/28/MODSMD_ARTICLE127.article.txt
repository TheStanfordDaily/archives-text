# Call for Tennis Managers Issued
## 
### 
An opportunity for freshmen to
retire their physical education re
quirements presents itself with the
signing up of tennis managers to
day by Elwyn Bugge at the B.A.C.
building, according to Ed Barnett,
senior manager.
Service as a sophomore manager
takes care of the physical educa
tional requisites for lower classmen,
but there are places for only four
or five applicants in tennis, Barnett
states.
