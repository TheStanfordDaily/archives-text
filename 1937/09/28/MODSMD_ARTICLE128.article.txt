# Lone Veteran Returns To Bolster Polo Squad
## 
### 
If Captain Haydon Grubbs knows
as much about predicting the out
come of a polo sdaSon as he does
about coaching a polo team, Stan
ford's varsity horsemen will begin a
winning season, October third, when
they get their horses and sticks out
of moth balls for the first practice
of the season.
Coach Grubbs is optimistic even
though three of his last year's varsity
squad graduates. "Even if we did
lose three of our best men, I think
we should have a very successful
season," he said.
Jim Fullerton, last year's only re

maining man, is captain of the team
and plays number one. Number two
will be Don McAuslard; number
three, Bob Wallace; and number four,
Bert McClintock. These last three
men were on last year's second
team. Reserves for this year will
,come from the old "A" team.
The first of the v egular weekly
games, which last out the year, will
be a week from Friday, and it will
probably see Grubbs' first string
playing his second team. Later this
fall Stanford is entering the Golden
Gate Park tournament, and on
Thanksgiving Day they play their
annual game against Arizona there.
