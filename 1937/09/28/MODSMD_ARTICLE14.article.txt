# Bride, Paris Claim Ex-Daily Eds
## 
### 
Following the urge of a "get away
from it all" feeling apparently fos
tered by skippering the Stanford
Daily, Europe has been the beat of
two ex-daily editors, Bob Jones, '35,
and Bob Eisenbach, '37, editor last
spring.
That Jones has decided to settle
down was indicated this month by
his marriage on the 23d to Joan
Skinner, University of California
Theta, '36. oJnes saw action as spe
cial U.P. reporter last year on the
Spanish front at Guadalajara, and
was then stationed as a correspond
ent in Geneva. After several months
of dodging bullets, he returned to
the United tSates, joining the staff
of the San Francisco Chronicle.
Eisenbach, who graduated last
June, left soon afterward for Eu
rope. After a short stay in England,
he went on to Paris. At present he
is working on copy-desk on the
Paris New York Herald-Tribune.
