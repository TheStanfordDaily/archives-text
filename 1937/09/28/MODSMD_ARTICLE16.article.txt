# Farm Debate Season To Open October 20
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
Stanford's debating program for
the coming year will commence with
a major debate on October 20, when
members of the varsity meet a team
from the University of Melbourne,
Australia.
The debate, which will be the first
to be held in the new Memorial The
ater, will be on the question "Re
solved: That the power of the fed
eral Supreme Court to declare stat
utes unconstitutional should be re
stricted."
Kerr to Manage
Debate coach this year will be
Russell R. Johnston and Ed Kerr will
be debate manager.
Johnston, who is on a year's leave
of absence from Long Beach Junior
College where he was dean of men,
is taking the faculty debating posi
tion formerly held by L. T. Chapin,
who is now working for an ad
vanced degree at Edinburgh Univer
sity in Scotland. The new debate
coach is a Stanford graduate, and he
will teach public speaking classes in
addition to coaching debate teams.
Emerson Returns
In addition, Professor J. G. Emer
son, debate coach here several years
ago, has returned from a leave of
absence and this quarter will give a
course in argumentation, and he also
may advise the debaters.
Anticipating a turnout of about 50
debaters, Johnston says that he plans
"to carry on the policies of Chapin
of giving as many debaters as pos
sible chances to represent Stanford
in contests with other schools." Few
schools besides Stanford have such a
policy for debating, he commented.
Meeting Planned
First meeting of the entire debate
squad will be held at 4 o'clock next
Tusday afternoon, October 4, in room
200C in the English corner, it was
announced today.
All students interested in debating,
whether as a course or as an extra
curricular activity, are urged by De
bate Manager Kerr to attend this
meeting. It will be open to varsity
members, junior transfers, and fresh

men. Plans for a series of inter
squad debates to be held early this
quarter will be discussed at that
time, Kerr said.
