# Missouri Student Accidental Suicide
## 
### 
COLUMBIA, Mo., Sept. 27 (U.R).â€”
Fraternity brothers believed today
that Albert R. Waters, Jr., killed
himself accidentally in the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon house early Sunday
morning while holding a revolver to
his head to frighten a fellow student
at the University of Missouri.
Waters and Jack Kilpatrick, 19, of
Oklahoma City, a philosophical
youth who was a pledge to the fra
ternity, had been lounging in Wa
ters' room. The talk had turned to
religion.
"I feel a sudden urge to com
mune with my Maker," Waters said.
A few minutes later he put a bullet
through his brain while Kilpatrick
stood a few feet away holding his
fingers in his ears, grimacing a
feigned terror that became reality
in an instant.
