OAKLAND. Sept. 27 (UP). â€”
W. D. Briggs, 52, employed on a
WPA music prospect, was arrested
today because he was suspected of
having started the devastating fire
that swept the Oakland hills Satur
day night. He was charged with
building a bonfire without a permit.
Fire Marshal Fred Carlson said
the bonfire threw sparks that started
the brush blaze that was not brought
under control until it had blackened
14 acres, burned two homes, and
forced scores of residents to flee.
The marshal said the starting of the
brush fire was due to carelessness.
