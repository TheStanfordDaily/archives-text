# New Enrollment Hits 1,101 At End Of First Reg Day
## New Division Draws 30 Students; Mitchell Is Pleased at Response 
### 
With the first and most hectic day
of registration over, administration
officials report 1,101 new students
enrolled for the fall quarter. This
total includes all new students,
freshmen and transfers, and is' di
vided into 722 men and 379 women.
As this is the first time that new
students have registered independ
ently of the rest of the school, no
comparative figures with previous
years are available. The number of
new students is probably larger than
usual, .said Registrar J. P. Mitchell.
Of this group approximately thirty
students will enter the newly cre
ated "University Division," waiving
requirements for the bachelor's de
gree and working directly for the
master's. This number includes
some upper division transfers and
old returning students. Mitchell said
he is highly pleased with the re
sponse to the new plan.
Besides the added freedom given
to students with a "B" average, in
this new division the ruling of the
Academic Council allows transfers
who have fulfilled lower division ie
quirements in their own school to
enter Stanford's upper division im
mediately. It is expected that to
day's registration of upper division
will swell the ranks of those enter
ing the University Division.
