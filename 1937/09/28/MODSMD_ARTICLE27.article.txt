SHANGHAI, Tuesday, Sept. 28
("UP). — Japanese began bombing
Chinese positions northwest of
Shanghai today with 14-inch Krupp
.siege guns, which they landed se
cretly three weeks ago. All Shang
hai rocked to a series of unprece
dented explosions.
Simultaneously the Japanese be
'•aii a new assault on the Chinese
lines around the town of Kiangwan,
about four miles north of the inter
national settlement.
The Chinese lines still were hold
ing at 2:30 a.m. and a spokesman
for General Chu Shao-Liang, the
new Chinese commander on the
Shanghai front, said the Japanese
were losing heavily from exploding
Chinese land mines.
He said the whole area around
Kiangwan had been mined under
Ihe supervision of German military
advisers employed by the Chinese
army. The mines were exploded
electrically as soon as the advanc
ing Japanese reached positions over
them.
He said the Japanese were using
'Suicide squads" to test the ground
lor mines before the main infantry
columns advanced.
The Japanese said the big guns
were only being tested, for the mo
ment, and might not be used exten
sively until Lieut. Gen. Iwane Mat
sui launches his final "big push"
which has been expected almost
daily for nearly a month.
SUB WARFARE
CHARGED TO JAPAN
Chinese survivors of a fleet of 12
Chinese fishing junks charged in
Hong Kong that the Japanese had
resorted to submarine warfare. Only
10 lived to tell of an attack by a
Japanese submarine which sank
their fleet off Cheelung Point, about
30 miles from Hong Kong, five days
ago. They were picked up by the
German liner Schamhorst.
