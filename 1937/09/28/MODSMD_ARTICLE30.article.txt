# U.S. Watches China Customs
## Officials Still Collect Merchandise Duties 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (U.R).—
State Department officials said today
that this government is watching
carefully the situation in North
China concerning collection of cus
toms duties on merchandise shipped
into the area now occupied by Japa
nese forces.
Officials said they had received no
intimation concerning any recent
change in the customs collection sit
uation. It was believed possible that
a condition might arise in the fu
ture under which there would be
dispute as to whether the Japanese
or Chinese had authority to levy
customs duty on imports.
