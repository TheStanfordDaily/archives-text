ABOARD PRESIDENT ROOSE
VELT'S SPECIAL TRAIN EN
ROUTE TO SEATTLE Sept. 27
(UP). â€” President Ro >-Vjlt spoke
.side-by-side today with Sen. Wil
liam H. Borah, the Republican lead
er against the New Deal Supreme
Court plan, and told 10,000 persons
in Boise, Idaho, that his mind is
occupied with making a "better
America" through industrial co
ordination and conservation and not
with "the petty quarrels of the day."
The President, sitting in an open
car with Borah on one side and
Senator James P. Pope, loyal Demo
crat, on the other, told the cheering
throng in the "city's' Capital Park

that his goal was to improve the
country for future generations
through wise development of human,
industrial, and national resources.
Mr. Roosevelt's speech showed dis
tinctly to political-observers that he
holds no deep down rancor against
Borah for his anti-cpurt enlarge
ment fight. Borah spoke briefly be
fore the President's talk. Mr. Roose
velt mentioned the Idaho veteran
three times, each time in warm and
friendly fashion.
While Mr. Roosevelt did not men
tion the Supreme Court battle di
rectly, it was believed he included
the question and Borah's opposition
to his plan in the problems he con
sidered smaller than "the bigger ob
jectives of American life."
