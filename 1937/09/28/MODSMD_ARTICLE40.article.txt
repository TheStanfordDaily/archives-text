# Frosh Women To Be Allowed 'Cultural' 2:30's
## New Regulations Also Include All Women With Minus Averages 
### 
Freshman women and all women
who are minus may this year apply
to Women's Council for two "cul
tural" 2:3o's a quarter in addition
to their other late leaves, according
to Jean Hemphill, chairman of
Council. "Cultural" leaves arc
those taken for San Francisco op
eras and symphonies, and for simi
lar performances.
Granting of these extra leaves is
the chief innovation in this year's
late leave system. Sophomore, jun
ior, and senior women who are in
good standing scholastically must
still take cultural 2:3o's from their
regular quota.
Other Rule* Retained
Other regulations are practically
the same as last year's.
First quarter freshman women will
receive one week-end 2:30 leave
each week, and three "floating"
2:3o's during the quarter — to be
used only on week-ends. Second
and third-quarter freshmen with a
"C" average will receive in addition
three 12 o'clocks to be used during
the week—not more than one to be
taken each week.
Freshman women below a "C"
average will have the same leave
quota as first quarter freshmen.
Other undergradaute women minus
from 1-5 will receive five "floating"
2:3o's to be used as midweek or
week-end leaves plus five midweek
12 o'clocks—not more than one to
be used in one week. Undergrad
uate women minus more than five
will receive five "floating" 2:3o's,
but no 12 o'clocks. All women au
tomatically get one 2:30 each week
end. All 2:3o's may be used as
overnights.
Other undergraduate women will
receive one midweek 12 o'clock each
week and two 2:3o's to be used as
either week-end or midweek, and
five 2:3o's to be taken at large.
Special Leaves
Graduate women living in under
graduate living groups may have
unlimited late leaves, but must
abide by the sign-out rules of the
University and their residences. Spe
cial leaves will be arranged for
women on rest schedule.
Cultural 12 o'clocks will be al
lowed for A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
They expire half an hour after the
concert is over, and if the remainder
is used it is counted on the student's
regular quota. Daily copy editors on
desk are given 12 o'clocks, night
editors on desk l:3o's, and l:3o's for
women members of edit board when
ever necessary.
Women appearing in campus dra
matic productions may take 2:30
leaves for dress rehearsals. Special
leaves are granted for work on the
Quad and debating by permission of
the chairman of Women's Council,
Jean Hemphill.
