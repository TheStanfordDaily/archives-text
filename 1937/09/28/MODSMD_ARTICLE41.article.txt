# WHERE CAN SHE BE?

Four out of five women in the
United tSates are beautiful—the fifth
comes to Stanford.
In a way this is an epigram. In
a way this is Stanford's most ven
erable epigram. True or not, it has
reached the ears of generations of
Encina inmates and prepared them
for the worst.
Saturday night awed '41-ers
brushed their teeth and started for
their first jolly-up ready for any
thing. They got it. They arrived at
the Women's Gym to discover that
resourceful upperclassmen had bor
rowed names and addresses of prom
inent freshmen and that these prom
inent freshmen had taken over the
names of tardy classmates. Result:
more men than monikers.

Other ingenious oldtimers crashed ,
the gates armed with unloaded min
niecams, forged Daily passes, and
burned out flash bulbs. Doormen
also let some frosh in.
Once inside the fun began. The
females of '41 are "terrific" and the
freshmen loved the frosh women.
Consensus about the girls—Okay!
Ratio of the evening was one up
perclassman to one beautiful girl.
Hits of the evening were: To the
women—Jim Groves; to the men—
four girls from San Jose State. Re
sult of the evening: enthusiastic
freshmen.
Both the men and women of '41
were pleased with their first taste of
collegiate social life. Football pl;iy
ers and cameraddicts were ditto.
