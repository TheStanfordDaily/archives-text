# AN OLD CUSTOM AND SOME NEW STANFORD 'FACES'
## 
### 

CONSTRUCTION CHANGES the Stanford viewâ€”and the university protects its
own. Once a year campus roads are roped off to enable the Board of Trustees to hold
jurisdiction over the thoroughfares in behalf of the University, as the view, upper left,
shows. The half-million-dollar Cubberley Building, upper center, rapidly taking form
as steel work rises on the site west of the library, will eventually house the School of

Education. The old assembly hall undergoes a transformation into modern classrooms for
the School of Business as construction, upper right, indicates. The Beta house, lower
left, is shown during summer rebuilding which cost .S2B.oft(), and the Deke house, recon
structed at an estimated cost of $37,500, is shown lower right in its new front.
