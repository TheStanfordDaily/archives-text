# Honor System Heads Farm's Old Traditions
## 
### BERT ALWARD 
First tradition to be encountered
by the freshman on the Stanford
campus was the Jolly-up, then the
Barbecue on the hill.
As the newcomer becomes better
acquainted with the intricacies of life
here he will find that there are many
more of different types.
Honor Code
Stanford men and women are first
of all expected to live up to the
principle and the letter of the Honor
Code which was introduced by the
student body.
It is considered in bad taste to
smoke on the Quad at any time, but
students congregate on the steps of
the English corner during the brief
period between classes for a cigarette
and exchange of conversation.
Another regulation to be strictly
followed is the "no cords for fresh
men" rule, the only one which in any
way restricts the sartorial elegance
of the first-year men.
Lock-out Salve
Men bringing women in to lock
outs after a date are expected to buy
them candy to the extent of a pound
for each minute past the late leave
deadline.
The only place on the campus for
bidden to frosh is the law steps,
where the rough still holds forth
during and between classes.
At Stanford, men are not expected
to give their dates corsages, except
for very special occasions which
rarely occur.
Nor is a dinner coat ever necessary
here. Stanford semi-formal dress
for the men consists of a plain dark
suit, though sometimes on parties in
the City, it is customary to wear a
tuxedo.
