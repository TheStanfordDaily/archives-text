# $20,000 Fund Helps Needy Farm Students
## 
### 
Funds totaling nearly $20,000 were expended during the college year
1030-37 by the Commission for Student Aid, for the purpose of aiding the
considerable body of students who have difficulty in meeting the financial
requirements of University registration. A similar expenditure is antici
pated for this year.
Organized several years ago under the sponsorship of President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and the University Hoard of Trustees, (he Commission

administers all funds that it receives"*
for the sole purpose of assisting
needy students by paying tuition
charges for them.
Members Told
The commission represents the
more important groups making up
the University body through three
alumni members, two student mem
bers, and four faculty members, in
cluding Dean of Women Mary Yost,
Dean of Men George B. Culver, and
Associate Registrar Karl M. Cow
dery.
Operating during all quarters ex
cept summer quarter, the Commis- i
sion allots $100 per quarter to each
student that qualifies. This sum pays
the regular tuition, leaving a small
additional amount, mainly extra fees,
to be met by the student.
A total of 380 applications for aid
during this fall quarter have been
filed with the Commission, with each
I student filling out application and i
! questionable forms giving full in- 1
I formation on the situation of each !
! student and the requirements for I
| help.
50 Aided
Because of limitation of funds,
( the Commission is able to grant ap- j
proximately 50 awards of $100 each. j
: In considering the applications, the I
| Student Aid board reaches deci- <
I sions after discussing the character !
j of the individual student and his or j
, her willingness to appreciate the j
| benefit of university work at Stan
j ford.
i In addition, each student must;
have a minimum scholarship aver- j
age of "C." The majority of grants
I for student aid are to sophomores,
juniors, and seniors, since it is felt
unwise to aid entering students who
i have yet to demonstrate their ability
in fulfilling University work.
However, none of these rules are |
i absolutely and allowances are
; made in some cases—excepting only !
the grade requirement. Hence, it is !
I expected that the Commission will
i aid a few freshmen after they have !
attended Stanford for at least one ;
quarter.
Most generous contributors to the
Student Aid Fund are the Board of \
Athletic Control, the Bookstore, and |
the student body, as well as many ]
individual sustaining contributors.'
All donations should be addressed to
the Commission for Student Aid,
i Box 3022, Stanford.

| and twelve o'clock for each 12 hours. !
Funds totaling nearly $20,000 were expended during the college year
1030-37 by the Commission for Student Aid, for the purpose of aiding the
considerable body of students who have difficulty in meeting the financial
requirements of University registration. A similar expenditure is antici
pated for this year.
Organized several years ago under the sponsorship of President Ray
Lyman Wilbur and the University Hoard of Trustees, (he Commission

administers all funds that it receives"*
for the sole purpose of assisting
needy students by paying tuition
charges for them.
Members Told
The commission represents the
more important groups making up
the University body through three
alumni members, two student mem
bers, and four faculty members, in
cluding Dean of Women Mary Yost,
Dean of Men George B. Culver, and
Associate Registrar Karl M. Cow
dery.
Operating during all quarters ex
cept summer quarter, the Commis- i
sion allots $100 per quarter to each
student that qualifies. This sum pays
the regular tuition, leaving a small
additional amount, mainly extra fees,
to be met by the student.
A total of 380 applications for aid
during this fall quarter have been
filed with the Commission, with each
I student filling out application and i
! questionable forms giving full in- 1
I formation on the situation of each !
! student and the requirements for I
| help.
50 Aided
Because of limitation of funds,
( the Commission is able to grant ap- j
proximately 50 awards of $100 each. j
: In considering the applications, the I
| Student Aid board reaches deci- <
I sions after discussing the character !
j of the individual student and his or j
