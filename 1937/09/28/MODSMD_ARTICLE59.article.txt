# Pre-Reg Ends; Sponsors Start
## Waterbags, Orientation Tax Leadership 
### 
With the pre-registration period
now over, and school under full
swing, Stanford's sponsors are doing
their work of orienting the new
students, freshmen and transfers, to
life on the campus.
Jean Bird, head sponsor of Roble,
has already told her charges the
important facts regarding late leaves,
the honor code, and less important
social regulations for Roble women.
Lee Lewis, in charge of the girls
at the Union, is helping the trans
fers to get acquainted on the cam
pus, always a difficult task for the
girls who enter school after their
freshman year.
The biggest job, in view of num
bers at least, falls to Jack Caldeiv
wood, new head sponsor in Encina.
He, with 20 aides, has undertaken
the task of persuading Stanford
frosh to become Stanford Gentlemen
in one year.
Introductory talks by officials,

varying from talks by athletic
coaches to an address by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, have been on
the freshman program.
All of the first-year students have
been led and introduced about by
sponsors at various social func
tions such as the jolly-up, the bar
becue, and the informal get-togeth
ers at the Unin.
While the problem of the sponsors
in the women's halls is to see that
everything is running smoothly, that
in Encina approaches a task of al
most mammoth proportions. It is
already rumored that the era of the
waterbag is back again.
