# Mussolini, Windsor, Alfonso On Bob Mallett's Calling List
## Grad Meets Celebrities On Summer Four 
### 
Because Spanish Princess Beatriz
had a baby in Rome's Anglo-Ameri
can Nursing Home this summer,
Stanford grad Bob Mallett is back
on campus with tales of an exclu
sive corner on Europe's celebrity
market, Mussolini, the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor, Hitler, et al.
It all started when Bob was sud
denly taken ill in Rome. First quar
tered in the Policlinico, Italian state
hospital, and "a very terrible place,'
he was soon transferred to the
nursing home through the machina
tions of Chi Psis Bill Hovey and
Ed Littlefield, who accompanied him
on the trip.
Coincidence arranged the l - oyal
Meets Alfonso
blessed-event in the same nursing
home and an introduction to the
princess followed. When ex-King
Alfonso came to visit his daughter
Bob met him, too.
A few days later, the former ruler
and his estranged queen met acci
dentally in the hall and conveniently
'staged a royal reconciliation scene
just outside Bob's door, with fond
embraces and a few sentimental
tears.
One day Bob casually mentioned
to Alfonso that he would like to
meet Mussolini. The next morning
he was told that he was to be taken
to the Piazzo Venezia, II Duce's
official headquarters. Driven through
Rome in a Fascist car, Bob was es
corted in the back door, up a flight
of stairs into the main office.
Shake's Duce's Hands
Introductions over, II Duce began
what appeared to be a Fascist sa
lute but Bob beat him to the draw
with an orthodox American hand
shake. It turned out to be a vigor
ous affair. Says Bob, "He almost
dropped me on the spot."
After talking informally for 15 or
20 minutes, Bob was shown Musso
lini's private balcony with a dicta
tor's-eye view of the square so often
thronged with black-shirted Italians
listening to their master's voice.
Princess Beatriz again played a
part in Bob's adventures when she
was visited by the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor, more introductions fol
lowing. Bob describes the heroine of
the most famous modern love story
as "not beautiful, but very, very
charming."
Passing through Venice, Bob
glimpsed King Victor Emmanuel,
and in Berlin caught up with Hitler
•.is the Reichsfuehrer was leaving a
radio show with propaganda min
ister Gocbels. "I wasn't much im
pressed," Bob said. "He lacked Mus
solini's dynamic personality. He just
came out and patted a few babies on
the head while cameras clicked all
over the place."
Progressing from royalty and dic
tators to prime ministers, Bob saw
England's Neville Chamberlin dur
ing his tour through the British
Isles, and climaxed the whole thing
with an introduction to movie queen
Connie Bennett on tjne Normandie
coming home.

Because Spanish Princess Beatriz
had a baby in Rome's Anglo-Ameri
can Nursing Home this summer,
Stanford grad Bob Mallett is back
on campus with tales of an exclu
sive corner on Europe's celebrity
market, Mussolini, the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor, Hitler, et al.
It all started when Bob was sud
denly taken ill in Rome. First quar
tered in the Policlinico, Italian state
hospital, and "a very terrible place,'
he was soon transferred to the
nursing home through the machina
tions of Chi Psis Bill Hovey and
Ed Littlefield, who accompanied him
on the trip.
Coincidence arranged the l - oyal
Meets Alfonso
blessed-event in the same nursing
home and an introduction to the
princess followed. When ex-King
Alfonso came to visit his daughter
Bob met him, too.
A few days later, the former ruler
and his estranged queen met acci
dentally in the hall and conveniently
'staged a royal reconciliation scene
just outside Bob's door, with fond
embraces and a few sentimental
tears.
One day Bob casually mentioned
to Alfonso that he would like to
meet Mussolini. The next morning
he was told that he was to be taken
to the Piazzo Venezia, II Duce's
official headquarters. Driven through
Rome in a Fascist car, Bob was es
corted in the back door, up a flight
of stairs into the main office.
Shake's Duce's Hands
Introductions over, II Duce began
what appeared to be a Fascist sa
lute but Bob beat him to the draw
with an orthodox American hand
shake. It turned out to be a vigor
ous affair. Says Bob, "He almost
dropped me on the spot."
After talking informally for 15 or
20 minutes, Bob was shown Musso
lini's private balcony with a dicta
tor's-eye view of the square so often
thronged with black-shirted Italians
listening to their master's voice.
Princess Beatriz again played a
part in Bob's adventures when she
was visited by the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor, more introductions fol
lowing. Bob describes the heroine of
the most famous modern love story
as "not beautiful, but very, very
charming."
Passing through Venice, Bob
glimpsed King Victor Emmanuel,
and in Berlin caught up with Hitler
•.is the Reichsfuehrer was leaving a
radio show with propaganda min
ister Gocbels. "I wasn't much im
pressed," Bob said. "He lacked Mus
solini's dynamic personality. He just
came out and patted a few babies on
the head while cameras clicked all
over the place."
Progressing from royalty and dic
tators to prime ministers, Bob saw
England's Neville Chamberlin dur
ing his tour through the British
Isles, and climaxed the whole thing
with an introduction to movie queen
Connie Bennett on tjne Normandie
coming home.
