# History of Opera Course Scheduled
## 
### 
History of Opera (Music 105) is
being offered for the first time this
quarter by Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist and professor of
music.
This course is being given in re
sponse to many requests. It is es
pecially timely, according to Profes
sor Allen, because of the new em
phasis on speech and drama in the
curriculum, and because of the con
current performances of the San
Francisco Opera Company.
History of Opera is a three-unit
course with lectures Tuesday and
Thursday at 9 o'clock and Wednes
day evening at 7:30. Students wish
ing to audit the course may obtain
permission from Professor Allen.
The syllabus covers the entire his
tory of theatrical music with special
emphasis on the works of the 19th
century.
Credit will be given for the first
time for Choir (Music 11) this fall.
This course will offer more intensive
preparation and drill than regular
choir work (Music 1), for which no
credit is given. However, only
members of the choir are eligible to
take Music 11. The new course is
also designed to give a better foun
dation for Musical Fundamentals
(Music 51).
