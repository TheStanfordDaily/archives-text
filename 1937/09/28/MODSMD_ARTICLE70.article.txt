# Frosh Rushing Rules Retained
## Row Council Will Set Dates Next Week 
### 
Rushing will continue this year on
the same basis as last when an en
tirely new system was inaugurated
to attempt an alleviation of the ille
gal rushing conditions.
Under the new plan there were
two salient features: first, rushing
was confined to week-end periods
which enabled a more informal con
tact between frosh and Row; and
second, enforcement of the rushing
rules was put on an honor basis,
placing the responsibility for fair
rushing on the respective house
presidents.
Tentative plans for the opening
rushing period this year set the date
at October 15 according to Don
Moulton, president of the Interfra
ternity Council.
Definite information in regard to
rushing dates and any rule changes
will be made following the Interfra
ternity Council meeting to be held
next week.
Normal goats are able to produce
