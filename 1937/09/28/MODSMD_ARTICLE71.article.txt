# Speakers' Bureau Program Planned
## 
### 
Speakers Bureau program for this
quarter will be arranged finally by
the end of this week, Manager
Chuck Schafer said today. All stu
dents planning to submit speeches
should see Schafer in his office in
the Old Union before Friday, he
announced.
Fifteen speeches were approved
by the review board last spring, and
Schafer believes that after this week
the bureau will offer a program of
around 28 topics, which is the same
number as was offered last year.
Organized three years ago, the
Speakers Bureau, sponsored by the
A.S.S.U., acts as a clearing-house
agency to furnish student speakers
to clubs and organizations in the bay
region.
A printed program of the speeches
offered will be available within
about three weeks, Schafer con
cluded.
