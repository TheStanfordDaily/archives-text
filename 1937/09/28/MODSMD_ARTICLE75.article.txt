## Dear Eis...How's Paris? 
### 
Dear eis:
How's Paris?
Yours, Gordy
P.S.
With the obvious self-consciousness of the
embryonic editor trying to avoid, repetition, we
who take over the reins of each new volume of
The Daily sit in our little green shack and
struggle for originality in "Dear Ex-Editor" let
ters.
You struggled, Eis, and ended up with the
shortest edit on record. You just said "thanks"
and that was plenty. Stan Beaubaire, of a few
years back, wrote more, you'll remember. But
his two full columns —except for a record of
verbosity—said less than your word.
I should end with my simple query about
Paris, where I hear you are sprinkling blood
and thunder into sketchy cables that pour
through the French headquarters for the New
York Herald Tribune. But that's not enough.
There are those who don't know that you are
the best newspaperman this office has turned
out in years —not journalist—but newspaper
man. This postscript must tell them.
It should tell them, and yourself, that as a
quick-thinking, vital, accurate, metropolitan re

porter you put The Daily through editorial paces
that befitted the urban news sheet. Sometimes
you forgot that the Stanford Daily is only part
newspaper, that it is part house organ. Some
times you were too good a metropolitan news
paperman for the Stanford Daily.
You should go great guns in the present call
ing, Eis. Here's luck.
* * *
And as this new volume of The Daily swings
into its own, only one definite pre-determined
editorial policy—more of an outlook than a
policy—is certain. It is this.
The Daily will take neither itself, Stanford,
nor life too seriously. All will exist after this
volume is buried in the files room.
Not that The Daily intends to turn into a
humor sheet; or regard all that is good, pure,
and true as farcical. Rather, it will undoubtedly
lack the scintillating wit and inimitable editorial
jinglings of recent editor Irvin Joigensen.
Volume 92 seeks to see Stanford as interest
ing, not faultless, but alive.
It will comment, commend, and occasionally
condemn.
It will not work itself into a fever over the
difference it will make ten years from now.
It will remember it probably won't make any.

jinglings of recent editor Irvin Joigensen.
Volume 92 seeks to see Stanford as interest
ing, not faultless, but alive.
It will comment, commend, and occasionally
condemn.
It will not work itself into a fever over the
difference it will make ten years from now.
It will remember it probably won't make any.
Dear eis:
How's Paris?
Yours, Gordy
P.S.
With the obvious self-consciousness of the
embryonic editor trying to avoid, repetition, we
who take over the reins of each new volume of
The Daily sit in our little green shack and
struggle for originality in "Dear Ex-Editor" let
ters.
You struggled, Eis, and ended up with the
shortest edit on record. You just said "thanks"
and that was plenty. Stan Beaubaire, of a few
years back, wrote more, you'll remember. But
his two full columns —except for a record of
verbosity—said less than your word.
I should end with my simple query about
Paris, where I hear you are sprinkling blood
and thunder into sketchy cables that pour
through the French headquarters for the New
York Herald Tribune. But that's not enough.
There are those who don't know that you are
the best newspaperman this office has turned
out in years —not journalist—but newspaper
man. This postscript must tell them.
It should tell them, and yourself, that as a
quick-thinking, vital, accurate, metropolitan re

porter you put The Daily through editorial paces
that befitted the urban news sheet. Sometimes
you forgot that the Stanford Daily is only part
newspaper, that it is part house organ. Some
times you were too good a metropolitan news
paperman for the Stanford Daily.
You should go great guns in the present call
ing, Eis. Here's luck.

And as this new volume of The Daily swings
into its own, only one definite pre-determined
editorial policy—more of an outlook than a
policy—is certain. It is this.
The Daily will take neither itself, Stanford,
nor life too seriously. All will exist after this
volume is buried in the files room.
Not that The Daily intends to turn into a
humor sheet; or regard all that is good, pure,
and true as farcical. Rather, it will undoubtedly
lack the scintillating wit and inimitable editorial
jinglings of recent editor Irvin Joigensen.
