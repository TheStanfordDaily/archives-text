SOMEWHERE in that milling crowd in the Ad
building this morning will be a person who
may be symbolic of a new era at Stanford. He
will be the 4000 th student to register for autumn
quarter; the first 4000 th registrant in Stanford
history.
That person may be a symbol of many things
that Stanford has not been in the past, a symbol
of a large university, with a large off-campus
population, with single classes of a thousand or
more, with student factionalism that would make
the Hall and Row seem chummy.
Having all freshmen live in Roble and En
cina, discouraging off - campus residence, has
contributed more to Stanford individuality than
red tile roofs, and this could be done only at a
small university. Living on campus, in the same
hall with the rest of your class for a year, has
been a common denominator for all students.
Numerical growth so far has been tentative,
almost haphazard, and the brake may be set
now. But there are over 500 more students here
now than in 1930, nearly 1000 more than in 1932,
and this is the first year that there have been
frosh women living outside of Roble.
In 1891, 500 students, mostly from poor fam
ilies, registered at a new university; in 1937,
4000 students, almost entirely from middle-class
families, registered at Stanford. In 1975 . . .
