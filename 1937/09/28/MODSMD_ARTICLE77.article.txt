# BULL SESSION
## WEATHER: FAIR AND WARMER 
### 
IN the old days of journalism, when rococo writing
was the rule, this column would have been labelled
"a stormy petrel." In this age of streamlined phras
eology and dehydrated grammar, there is no neat term
with which "Bull Session" can be tagged. Compara
tively an old institution for a college paper, this col
umn has voiced as many assorted opinions as a student
committee. But no one has ever discovered an apt and
printable name for it.
A mighty warrior hight Abe Mclinkoff began "Bull
Session" in the early eocene (faculty called it the ob
scene) era of the Daily's history. Burdened with the
reputation of being Stanford's nearest approach to a
radical, Melinkoff used it to throw verbal bombs and
incendiary epithets.
When his sessions had taken their place among the
substrata of the Daily's files, the column veered back
and forth through various typewriters. Sometimes it
made the stand-patters squirm. Occasionally it made
the radicals look around for an attractive wall to be
used as a backstop in the coming revolution. At times,
the writers have beaten out a session with one eye on
a shaky bawlout average; at others, they have written
it with suitcases packed, and a well rehearsed speech
of farewell ready to be used if necessary.
* * * *
This year "Bull Session" will toddle along, holding
fast to the coat-tail of preceding years. There will be
times when the radicals will picture me against a
granite backdrop. And there will be occasions when
the conservatives will growl, "Look with a spot I
damn him" and put my name on a red list.
When those brief prc-views of Utopia that keep
this earth from being a pessimist's paradise show up,
this column will note them. And when the works of
the world, the flesh, and the devil, become too appar
ent, they also will be recorded.
College life has often been called a picnic. And com
pared with various ways in which various other halves
live, it docs look like a holiday jaunt. But all picnics
arc apt to be cursed by extremes of feeling. Either
they are "swell" or they are "lousy." In every picnic
there is a future for someone who can see something
the others overlook. He may point out that the food
is resting on an ant-hill while the crowd is bleating
about the scenery. Or he may call attention to the
rainbow when the others are wiping the water off their
necks.

J N cither case, the detached observer serves a pur
pose. And during this volume, "Bull Session" will
play the part of the detached observer. There will be
times when it will be called pollyanna, other times
when it will be called radical, senseless, and less print
able names.
"Bull Session" will comment on those aspects of
college life which appear worthy of comment. And if
anyone feels that he is unjustly criticized let him
remember "Purity is its own security."

"Bull Session" will comment on those aspects of
college life which appear worthy of comment. And if
anyone feels that he is unjustly criticized let him
remember "Purity is its own security."

IN the old days of journalism, when rococo writing
was the rule, this column would have been labelled
"a stormy petrel." In this age of streamlined phras
eology and dehydrated grammar, there is no neat term
with which "Bull Session" can be tagged. Compara
tively an old institution for a college paper, this col
umn has voiced as many assorted opinions as a student
committee. But no one has ever discovered an apt and
printable name for it.
A mighty warrior hight Abe Mclinkoff began "Bull
Session" in the early eocene (faculty called it the ob
scene) era of the Daily's history. Burdened with the
reputation of being Stanford's nearest approach to a
radical, Melinkoff used it to throw verbal bombs and
incendiary epithets.
When his sessions had taken their place among the
substrata of the Daily's files, the column veered back
and forth through various typewriters. Sometimes it
made the stand-patters squirm. Occasionally it made
the radicals look around for an attractive wall to be
used as a backstop in the coming revolution. At times,
the writers have beaten out a session with one eye on
a shaky bawlout average; at others, they have written
it with suitcases packed, and a well rehearsed speech
of farewell ready to be used if necessary.

This year "Bull Session" will toddle along, holding
fast to the coat-tail of preceding years. There will be
times when the radicals will picture me against a
granite backdrop. And there will be occasions when
the conservatives will growl, "Look with a spot I
damn him" and put my name on a red list.
When those brief prc-views of Utopia that keep
this earth from being a pessimist's paradise show up,
this column will note them. And when the works of
the world, the flesh, and the devil, become too appar
ent, they also will be recorded.
College life has often been called a picnic. And com
pared with various ways in which various other halves
live, it docs look like a holiday jaunt. But all picnics
arc apt to be cursed by extremes of feeling. Either
they are "swell" or they are "lousy." In every picnic
there is a future for someone who can see something
the others overlook. He may point out that the food
is resting on an ant-hill while the crowd is bleating
about the scenery. Or he may call attention to the
rainbow when the others are wiping the water off their
necks.

J N cither case, the detached observer serves a pur
pose. And during this volume, "Bull Session" will
play the part of the detached observer. There will be
times when it will be called pollyanna, other times
when it will be called radical, senseless, and less print
able names.
"Bull Session" will comment on those aspects of
college life which appear worthy of comment. And if
anyone feels that he is unjustly criticized let him
remember "Purity is its own security."
