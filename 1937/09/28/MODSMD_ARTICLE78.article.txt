# Another Man's View
## 
### 
It has recently been customary for the Stanford Daily
to mix zvitli its men editorial gems in the adjoining col
umn the salient statements of some other editor on some
other campus. "Clipped edits" were mercilessly sand
wiched in with locally written comment. Readers were
frequently baflled at the array of opposing opinion.
Put it took up space.
Hereafter this column will contain all "clips" from our
editorial contemporaries, bits that zvill keep Stanford
posted on the activities and editorial controversies at other
universities and colleges. Their reprint here does not
necessarily indicate that the Daily concurs. It docs mean
that The Daily found interest in "the other man's view"
The Editor
Finding the editorial windmills somewhat quiet after
three weeks of publication, the Daily California!) re
vived a months-old gripe against Phi Beta Kappa.
This blast from the heavy artillery is rcprintable here
if only for the pure flower of its invective.
The Daily docs not agree.
pompous, dignified, and useless, Phi Beta Kappa,
scholastic honor society, needs an excuse for living.
Assertedly holding a monopoly on the "brains" of the
campus, the group is dead from the feet up, which is
an unhealthy condition even for brains.
Absorbed in the delightful pastime of self-congratu
lation, Phi Beta Kappa as an organization has done
very little to deserve praise.
It excuses itself from the charge of being blind to
campus problems by the simple expedient of announc
ing it is blind to world problems, too. In austere dig
nity it basks in the warmth of its superior wisdom and
officially ignores the tiresome problems around it with
a disdainful flip of the hand. It is Phi Beta Kappa!
Illustrative of this polite superiority was the position
of the group during the investigation of examination
conduct last semester. Although rather obviously af
fected by the question, Phi Beta Kappa remained po
litely aloof while others did the work, then belatedly
sent well wishes and "Phi Beta Kappa approves and
recognizes, etc." Throughout the period the society
frowned disdainfully upon publicity in explanations of
its actions.
This attitude is very unfortunate. If Phi Beta Kappa
standing is indicative of nothing more worth while
than a phonograph memory then it can be understood
that it should ignore campus issues. Unless they were
typewritten out with full explanations of the solution,
such a Phi Beta Kappa group could not comprehend
them.
Replied Dr. L. A. Harper, faculty secretary of the
organization: "Phi Beta Kappa is not a statement
making, resolution-passing group."
But the Californian had the last word. It asked what
Phi Beta Kappa was for, and answered itself—
"It holds initiations!"

officially ignores the tiresome problems around it with
a disdainful flip of the hand. It is Phi Beta Kappa!
Illustrative of this polite superiority was the position
of the group during the investigation of examination
conduct last semester. Although rather obviously af
fected by the question, Phi Beta Kappa remained po
litely aloof while others did the work, then belatedly
sent well wishes and "Phi Beta Kappa approves and
recognizes, etc." Throughout the period the society
frowned disdainfully upon publicity in explanations of
its actions.
This attitude is very unfortunate. If Phi Beta Kappa
standing is indicative of nothing more worth while
than a phonograph memory then it can be understood
that it should ignore campus issues. Unless they were
typewritten out with full explanations of the solution,
such a Phi Beta Kappa group could not comprehend
them.
Replied Dr. L. A. Harper, faculty secretary of the
organization: "Phi Beta Kappa is not a statement
making, resolution-passing group."
But the Californian had the last word. It asked what
Phi Beta Kappa was for, and answered itself—
"It holds initiations!"
It has recently been customary for the Stanford Daily

The Editor
Finding the editorial windmills somewhat quiet after
three weeks of publication, the Daily California!) re
vived a months-old gripe against Phi Beta Kappa.
This blast from the heavy artillery is rcprintable here
if only for the pure flower of its invective.
The Daily docs not agree.
pompous, dignified, and useless, Phi Beta Kappa,
scholastic honor society, needs an excuse for living.
Assertedly holding a monopoly on the "brains" of the
campus, the group is dead from the feet up, which is
an unhealthy condition even for brains.
Absorbed in the delightful pastime of self-congratu
lation, Phi Beta Kappa as an organization has done
very little to deserve praise.
It excuses itself from the charge of being blind to
campus problems by the simple expedient of announc
ing it is blind to world problems, too. In austere dig
nity it basks in the warmth of its superior wisdom and
officially ignores the tiresome problems around it with
a disdainful flip of the hand. It is Phi Beta Kappa!
