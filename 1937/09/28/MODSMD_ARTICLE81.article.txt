"ROOM SERVICE": "Three times
funnier than 'Three Men on a
Horse,' reads a blushing little blurb
about "Room Service" in the lobby
of the Geary, where "Room Service"
is hanging on by its fifth week mol
ars. Now maybe it would be strip
ping a critical gear to say that
"Room Service" is that funny. In
fact, with a little hasty mathematical
calculation, we would say it's about
one-tenth of one per cent what it's
cracked up to be.
Still anybody can pull a chuckle
or even a full size laugh out of this
minor farce about a bunch of sec
ond-string Broadway producers
who once produced "Special Deliv
ery" between two "no parking"
signs.
"STELLA DALLAS," currently at
the Fox-Stanford: Olive Higgins
Prouty wrote "Stella Dallas." Life,
we feel, is very real and earnest to
Olive Higgins Prouty. Stella Dallas
drips more grief than a hired mourn
er at a wake. Â»It is softer than a
three-minute egg, but still it is the
most effective hearts and flowers
slush in a decade, and thoroughly
satisfying melodrama.
Stella Dallas (Barbara Stanwyck)
is a mill hand's daughter. Stephen
Dallas (John Boles) is a rich man's
son. Stella has a crude streak and
taste in clothes that would raise
eyebrows in the best Third and
Mission Street circles.
Strait-laced Stephen and Stella
come to the parting of ways. Stella
devotes her life to her daughter
Laurel (Ann Shirley). Laurel falls
in love and the rest is a tale of
noble self-sacrifice on Stella's part.
Stanwyck contributes an admirable
performance, John Boles is a good

deal of a pain in the neck, and Ann
Shirley often beats both of them to
the dramatic draw.
