# Grid Prophets Hit 4 Out of 7
## Miss on Indian, Beaver, Cougar Games 
### 
Stanford Daily sports writers
climbed out on the proverbial limb
when they printed their consensus
predictions of the first week's foot
ball scores in the pre-registration
issue.
The dippy writers crashed to earth
with a little better than a .500 batting
average when they called four out
of seven games correctly.
The Broncos from Santa Clara came
right into the front yard of the
Stanfords to spoil number one prog
nostication. The dope sheet had the
Cards winning 13-6, but Buck Shaw's
men fixed that with a 13-7 re
versal.
Little Gonzaga held Washington
State to a scoreless tie to make the
18-0 Cougar win prediction number
two mistake for the week-end. The
third upset was furnished by the
trampled-on Idaho Vandals who eked
out a 7-6 victory over Oregon State.
Your correspondents called it 20-0
for the Beavers.
The prediction of a 13-7 win for
California over St. Mary's was right
as far as the winner was concerned
but slightly underestimated the
Bear's scoring power, who won going
away, 30-7. U.S.C. 32, Pacific 6
wasn't far off as the Trojans ran
roughshod over the Bengals to win
40-0. The Daily called it U.C.L.A.
13, Oregon 0, and the final score was
26-13 in favor of the Bruins. Finally,
the typewriter pounders called the
intersectional classic right with a
20-0 win prediction for Washington
over lowa. The defending Coast
Conference champs won 10-0."
Now the boys can rest until Fri
day when they will again climb out
on the end of the shaky limb for a
few more predictions.
