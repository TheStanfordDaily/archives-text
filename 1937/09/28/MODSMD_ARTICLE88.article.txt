## 'Genial John Bunn' Has Few Worries To Face For Coming Season 
### 
He's a lucky guy, is this fellow
who for many years has been chief
tutor of the basketball machines
which pound the coast hoop pavilions
to frazzles for Stanford.
The name, in case your memory
is a wee bit on the rusty side, is
Mons. J. Bunn. The initial can
rightly stand for John, Jenial—as
in Jenial —John, or still more apro
priate, Jenius—as in —Jenial John,
the Jenius of the jumping jacks.
Indeed a brainy man is Mons.
Bunn, for his teams have neatly
pocketed the crown of the Pacific
Coast Conference for two consecu
tive years. What's more, the guy has
a team that's going to do it again
this year, and perhaps for many
years to come.
Mons. Bunn will have to do very
little worrying this year as to ma
terial to make up a championship
bound team.
Hank Back
It seems that, for one thing, there
is a fellow named Angelo Luisetti
who plays forward. Mr. Luisetti,
known round about as Hank, has
been hanging around for some time
now, and generally makes himself
known as the greatest basketball
player ever seen in these hyar parts
—and that's inclusive.
As running mate to Hoopin' Hank
will most likely be Phil Zonne,
younger member of the Zonne boys.
Mr. Zonne had little trouble nabbing
scoring honors during his frosh year.
Tall and slim, he has the knack of
going around a guard like an eel
going around a corner—and twice
as fast. In other words, the lad is
quite slippery.
Stork Jumps High
Holding down the center spot, and
very, capably, thank you, will be
Art Stoefen, known to all and sun
dry as Stork, for obvious reasons.
The Stork likes nothing better than
to outwit villainous opponents by be
ing unorthodox. He jumps high into
the air when in the vicinity of the
bucket, then immediately pushes
the ball through said bucket for a
score. He doesn't shoot the ball in
an upward arc—he makes sure by
shoving the ball down. A very
tricky guy, indeed.
In the defense line will be another
fellow who nearly touches the rafters
with a little jump. John "Spook"
Calderwood is the elongated gentle
