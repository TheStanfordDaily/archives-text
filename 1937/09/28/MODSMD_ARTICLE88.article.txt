## 'Genial John Bunn' Has Few Worries To Face For Coming Season 
### 
He's a lucky guy, is this fellow
who for many years has been chief
tutor of the basketball machines
which pound the coast hoop pavilions
to frazzles for Stanford.
The name, in case your memory
is a wee bit on the rusty side, is
Mons. J. Bunn. The initial can
rightly stand for John, Jenial—as
in Jenial —John, or still more apro
priate, Jenius—as in —Jenial John,
the Jenius of the jumping jacks.
Indeed a brainy man is Mons.
Bunn, for his teams have neatly
pocketed the crown of the Pacific
Coast Conference for two consecu
tive years. What's more, the guy has
a team that's going to do it again
this year, and perhaps for many
years to come.
Mons. Bunn will have to do very
little worrying this year as to ma
terial to make up a championship
bound team.
Hank Back
It seems that, for one thing, there
is a fellow named Angelo Luisetti
who plays forward. Mr. Luisetti,
known round about as Hank, has
been hanging around for some time
now, and generally makes himself
known as the greatest basketball
player ever seen in these hyar parts
—and that's inclusive.
As running mate to Hoopin' Hank
will most likely be Phil Zonne,
younger member of the Zonne boys.
Mr. Zonne had little trouble nabbing
scoring honors during his frosh year.
Tall and slim, he has the knack of
going around a guard like an eel
going around a corner—and twice
as fast. In other words, the lad is
quite slippery.
Stork Jumps High
Holding down the center spot, and
very, capably, thank you, will be
Art Stoefen, known to all and sun
dry as Stork, for obvious reasons.
The Stork likes nothing better than
to outwit villainous opponents by be
ing unorthodox. He jumps high into
the air when in the vicinity of the
bucket, then immediately pushes
the ball through said bucket for a
score. He doesn't shoot the ball in
an upward arc—he makes sure by
shoving the ball down. A very
tricky guy, indeed.
In the defense line will be another
fellow who nearly touches the rafters
with a little jump. John "Spook"
Calderwood is the elongated gentle
man who will uphold the dignity of
one guard position. John simply
delights in frightening the very
dickens out of opposing players by
looking at them and gently shouting
"boo." When this happens, the op
posing player usually turns white
around the gills, and weakens rapid
ly, which enables John to easily
capture the sphere.
Zonnc or Lee
Carrying on beside Mr. Calderwood
will be one of two hoop stars. Per
haps it will be Bob Zonne, elder
member of the Zonne boys. Or may
be it will be H. B. Lee. Both of
these gentlemen being guards of the
best calibre, the only difference in
the two is that Mr. Zonne pierces
the atmosphere to the great height
of six feet four inches, while Mr.
Lee has a hard time getting away
with five feet ten inches. Although
Mr. Zonne has a great advantage
in being able 1o reach over the other
players, Mr. Lee can often run the
length of the court before being
seen. Thus the choice is a toss-up.
As for reserves, there is no dearth
whatsoever. Last year's frosh team,
one of the best ever to pound the
Stanford Pavilion, sends up a man
mountain center who stands no less
than six feet and six and one-half
inches tall. And that is something.
Tom Siebert is the name, and a bas
ketball in his paws is a baseball in the
hands of Carl Hubbell. Forwards
coming up are Leon Lafaille and
Lew Stachle, while from the guard
spots appear Will Anderson and Gil
Rahn.
