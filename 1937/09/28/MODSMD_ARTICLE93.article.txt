# Dean Ordered To Take Rest
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 27 (UP).â€”Dizzy
Dean, paid off for the balance of
the season because of a sore pitch
ing arm, was in temporary retire
ment today while Frankie Frisch, a.
new 1938 contract in his pocket,
prepared to move the Cardinals to
Pittsburgh and Chicago this week
for the final games.
Dean will not accompany the
team because Sam Breadon, owner
of the Cardinals, decided Dean's
ailing arm would prevent him from
pitching. Dean planned to remain in
St. Louis for medical treatment.
Breadon indicated there was little
possibility of Dean being retired
from the club permanently. The
lame arm will be placed in a cast,
he said.

California women rooters must
have pompoms at every game.
