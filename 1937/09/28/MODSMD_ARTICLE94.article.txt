# Wilbur Catches Record Trout; Ellington Fishes, Lands Mink
## 
### 
There are many places where you
can spend a summer's vacation, ;
but Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur and
coaches Myron Sprague, Bill Elling
ton, and Bones Hamilton think the
only place to go is to a good liver,
| stream, or lake filled with fish.
They all went to such places this
I summer. They all caught some
thing.
Wilbur Caught Fish
President Wilbur caught a fish.
Fishing in the north end of Stuart
Lake in Northern British Columbia
this summer, he caught one of the
largest Rainbow trout ever to be
landed in northern or central Brit
ish Columbia. The rainbow, offi
cially weighed and measured,
I weighed twenty pounds, was thirty
i two and a half inches long, and
1 had a girth of twenty-two inches.
Dr. Wilbur caught the large fish
j with a six-ounce, nine-foot rod with
1 light tackle after an hour and four
minutes battle. In the absence of a
landing net, Dr. Wilbur landed the
big one with the aid of a pocket gaff.
Ellington Caught Mink
Bill Ellington, fishing for fish,
. caught a mink. Casting on the Sac
ramento River, he saw a fish rise,
and being a dry fly addict, cast for
it. He saw the fish roll toward the
! fly and thought he would get him.
! But at the same time a mink jumped
| for the fish, and Ellington got the
mink instead. The mink got nothing.
At first Bill wanted to lose the mink,
which he had hooked under the jaw.
But after he had played with it for
■ about ten minutes, he wanted to
kep it and landed it shortly after.
He was using a small number 12 fly.
Bones Hamilton went fishing, but
the best thing he got was a good
, fish story. Fishing on the Silver
i Fork of the American River, he
hooked a six inch trout. But before
j he could pull him in a big seven
pound brown trout came up and
' grabbed his trout sideways. Bones
could have clubbed the big trout
I and got him if he had had any help,
but he was by himself and lost the
fish.
Fish Caught Sprague
Myron Sprague, who fishes every
summer and talks fish every fall,
winter and spring, went after salmon
in the Rogue River in Oregon this
year. He caught two large salmon
weighing sixteen and twenty-four
pounds, and was caught by a steal
head. The fish got a , hold on his
line and pulled him overboard into
the swift flowing Rogue. Myron
was pulled nearly a quarter of a mile
downstream before he could convince
the fish who was doing the catching.

The uneven lava bottom of the river <
combined with the Rogue's very
swift current, conspired against
Sprague to give one fish a few
minutes feeling of superiority over
man.

Contrary to students' estimation of i
their professors, no records in fossil [
form of man's early existence on
earth have ever been found, j

There are many places where you
can spend a summer's vacation, ;
but Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur and
coaches Myron Sprague, Bill Elling
ton, and Bones Hamilton think the
only place to go is to a good liver,
| stream, or lake filled with fish.
They all went to such places this
I summer. They all caught some
thing.
Wilbur Caught Fish
President Wilbur caught a fish.
Fishing in the north end of Stuart
Lake in Northern British Columbia
this summer, he caught one of the
largest Rainbow trout ever to be
landed in northern or central Brit
ish Columbia. The rainbow, offi
cially weighed and measured,
I weighed twenty pounds, was thirty
i two and a half inches long, and
1 had a girth of twenty-two inches.
Dr. Wilbur caught the large fish
j with a six-ounce, nine-foot rod with
1 light tackle after an hour and four
minutes battle. In the absence of a
landing net, Dr. Wilbur landed the
big one with the aid of a pocket gaff.
Ellington Caught Mink
Bill Ellington, fishing for fish,
. caught a mink. Casting on the Sac
ramento River, he saw a fish rise,
and being a dry fly addict, cast for
it. He saw the fish roll toward the
! fly and thought he would get him.
! But at the same time a mink jumped
| for the fish, and Ellington got the
mink instead. The mink got nothing.
At first Bill wanted to lose the mink,
which he had hooked under the jaw.
But after he had played with it for
■ about ten minutes, he wanted to
kep it and landed it shortly after.
He was using a small number 12 fly.
Bones Hamilton went fishing, but
the best thing he got was a good
, fish story. Fishing on the Silver
i Fork of the American River, he
hooked a six inch trout. But before
j he could pull him in a big seven
pound brown trout came up and
' grabbed his trout sideways. Bones
could have clubbed the big trout
I and got him if he had had any help,
but he was by himself and lost the
fish.
Fish Caught Sprague
Myron Sprague, who fishes every
summer and talks fish every fall,
winter and spring, went after salmon
in the Rogue River in Oregon this
year. He caught two large salmon
weighing sixteen and twenty-four
pounds, and was caught by a steal
head. The fish got a , hold on his
line and pulled him overboard into
the swift flowing Rogue. Myron
was pulled nearly a quarter of a mile
downstream before he could convince
the fish who was doing the catching.

The uneven lava bottom of the river <
combined with the Rogue's very
swift current, conspired against
Sprague to give one fish a few
minutes feeling of superiority over
man.
