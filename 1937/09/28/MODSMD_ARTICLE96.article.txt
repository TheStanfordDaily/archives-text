# Gridders Forget, Point Toward Oregon
## Red Machine Loses 13-7 To Broncos In First Game Farm's Team Crumples In First Tilt With Santa Clara Squad 
### GENE GEAR 
Stanford's Big Red Machine of
1937 sputtered around the Stadium
Saturday afternoon badly in need of
repairs, and almost fell apart until
Tiny's gridders tacked wings on the
contraption.
This tragic little tale with a near
happy ending took place when Santa
Clara's footballers outplayed Tiny
Thornhill's Indian gridders through
56 minutes of torrid football to take
a 13-0 lead.
Within the last four minutes of
play the Cards put across two pass
plays for a total of 100 yards and 7
points to make things a little
brighter for the Stanfords on the
scoreboard and on the statistician's
sheet.
Bronco 8-Man Line
Stanford's grid machine looked
very ineffective as it cracked away
at the Bronco eight - man line
throughout a sweltering afternoon to
run up a net ground gain of 20 yards.
The old Indian just couldn't get
the patched up Red Machine to
ramble. The line wasn't charging;
the line wasn't opening holes; and
the line wasn't breaking through to
stop Santa Clara backs. The back
field was slow in starting, and the
punting was well under par.
Bill Paulman, the Cards' ace quar
terback went out in the first quarter.
A throat infection and the terrific
heat combining to make Blonde Bill
ineffective during his short stay in
the Cardinal lineup.
Three Scoreless Quarters
Stanford just couldn't get going
offensively or defensively, but still
the Santa Clarans failed to put over
a score until the fourth quarter.
The break came when Jimmy Bar
low, Bronco hero, kicked out of
bounds on the Stanford 3-yard line.
Stanford's Glenn Hamilton dropped
back in punt formation. The ball was
snapped and Jesse Coffer, Bronc left
end, crashed through to block the
kick. The ball was promptly fallen
on by Captain Phil Dougherty of the
Broncos in the Stanford end-zone
for the first six points of the game.
A little later Jimmy Coffis, who
played a whale of a game at safety
for the Cards, fumbled on the Stan
ford 35 and Tony Mazzina recovered
for the Broncos. It took Barlow two
plays to put the ball over from there.
The Santa Clara hero circled the
Cardinal left end for 17 yards, and
then crashed through a wide hole
at left guard for 16 yards and the
score. Bruno Pellegrini kicked the
extra point.
Coffis' Lon# Gain
With four minutes to play in the
game the Stanfords came back fight
ing. Hamilton dropped back of the
25-yard scrimmage line, faked a lat
eral, and shot a long pass across the
field into the arms of Coffis on the
Santa Clara 40. The scrappy little
Card punt returner scampered down
the sidelines to the Bronco 15-yard
line.
An intercepted pass ended the
Stanford threat, Hamilton again
dropped back and tossed a 15-yard
pass to acting captain Grant Stone,
who raced 35 yards to pay dirt, aided
by a clever fake lateral and nice
blocking.
Stanford piled up 162 yards on
parses to Santa Clara's 35, but the
Bronco's 153 yards gained on run
ning plays against the Cards' 47 gave
mute evidence of Stanford's lack of
steam on the g'xound. First downs
were even up with both squads
pulling down fiv&.
â€¢Cards Outshone
Whether it was the heat, lack of
scrimmage practica, or one of a hun
dred reasons, the Stanford grid ma
chine appeared to be composed of a
disorganized hunch of footballers
facing a snappy, fast clicking outfit
from Santa Clarit. The fast charging
Broncos should go< a long way this
season in uphold.'JV* the reputation
they made last year in the Sugar
Bowl. >
Jim Groves lookod good in his
initial start both to "the crowd and
to Thomhill. The djmamiting full
back proved his mettle in all depart
ments except kicking. He was try
ing just a little too hard' for the side
lines on his punts and not concen
trating enough on distance.
Throughout the game it was clearly
evident that the Stanfords were well
below par in tackling and blocking.
The Stanford backs could" get no
where and the Bronco runners were
going to town. Barlow, Fisher, and
Gunther all averaged oveir three
yards per carry for the Broncos.
And the Statistics
Right half Ed Gamier was the
chief Indian ground gainer, aver
aging three yards in two attempts.
The Stanfords were outpunted, av
eraging 24.9 yards from scrimmage
for 13 attempts, while the Santa
Clarans were gathering in an aver
age of 33.8 for ten kicks.

Seven passes were intercepted dur
ing the day's proceedings. Four
Cardinal passes were inteixepted and
three Santa Clara tosses. The Cards
threw 17, completing 6, while the
Broncos were getting two for ten.
Stan Andersen, with more experi
ence under fire should make a great
tackle. Louis Tsoutsouvas played a
brand of ball at center that may press
the hard fighting Tony Calvelli's
hold on the first string pivot position.
Irv Cummings, who broke into the
starting lineup at left end caught
Tiny's eye with his work at the flank
position.
Again it was little Jimmy Coffis
who put the spark into the spark
plug of the dented red machine. It
wasn't until the last quarter until
Bronco punts began coming into his
arms, and he was reeling them back
for 15 and 20 yards.
