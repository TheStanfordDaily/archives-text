# Gridders Forget, Point Toward Oregon
## Red Machine Loses 13-7 To Broncos In First Game Farm's Team Crumples In First Tilt With Santa Clara Squad 
### GENE GEAR 
Stanford's Big Red Machine of
1937 sputtered around the Stadium
Saturday afternoon badly in need of
repairs, and almost fell apart until
Tiny's gridders tacked wings on the
contraption.
This tragic little tale with a near
happy ending took place when Santa
Clara's footballers outplayed Tiny
Thornhill's Indian gridders through
56 minutes of torrid football to take
a 13-0 lead.
Within the last four minutes of
play the Cards put across two pass
plays for a total of 100 yards and 7
points to make things a little
brighter for the Stanfords on the
scoreboard and on the statistician's
sheet.
Bronco 8-Man Line
Stanford's grid machine looked
very ineffective as it cracked away
at the Bronco eight - man line
throughout a sweltering afternoon to
run up a net ground gain of 20 yards.
The old Indian just couldn't get
the patched up Red Machine to
ramble. The line wasn't charging;
the line wasn't opening holes; and
the line wasn't breaking through to
stop Santa Clara backs. The back
field was slow in starting, and the
punting was well under par.
Bill Paulman, the Cards' ace quar
terback went out in the first quarter.
A throat infection and the terrific
heat combining to make Blonde Bill
ineffective during his short stay in
the Cardinal lineup.
Three Scoreless Quarters
Stanford just couldn't get going
offensively or defensively, but still
the Santa Clarans failed to put over
a score until the fourth quarter.
The break came when Jimmy Bar
low, Bronco hero, kicked out of
bounds on the Stanford 3-yard line.
Stanford's Glenn Hamilton dropped
back in punt formation. The ball was
snapped and Jesse Coffer, Bronc left
end, crashed through to block the
kick. The ball was promptly fallen
on by Captain Phil Dougherty of the
Broncos in the Stanford end-zone
for the first six points of the game.
A little later Jimmy Coffis, who
played a whale of a game at safety
for the Cards, fumbled on the Stan
ford 35 and Tony Mazzina recovered
for the Broncos. It took Barlow two
plays to put the ball over from there.
The Santa Clara hero circled the
Cardinal left end for 17 yards, and
then crashed through a wide hole
at left guard for 16 yards and the
score. Bruno Pellegrini kicked the
extra point.
Coffis' Lon# Gain
With four minutes to play in the
game the Stanfords came back fight
ing. Hamilton dropped back of the
25-yard scrimmage line, faked a lat
eral, and shot a long pass across the
field into the arms of Coffis on the
Santa Clara 40. The scrappy little
Card punt returner scampered down
the sidelines to the Bronco 15-yard
line.
An intercepted pass ended the
Stanford threat, Hamilton again
dropped back and tossed a 15-yard
pass to acting captain Grant Stone,
who raced 35 yards to pay dirt, aided
by a clever fake lateral and nice
blocking.
Stanford piled up 162 yards on
