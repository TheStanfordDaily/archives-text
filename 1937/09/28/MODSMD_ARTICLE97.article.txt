# New Coach Meets Boxers Tomorrow
## 
### 
Boxing on the Farm remains an
open book to date for Coach Clay
ton Frye, who comes to Stanford
this season after several years with
the Los Angeles Athletic Club and
the Beverly Hills Athletic Club.
Because he is new to the Farm,
Coach Frye is ignorant of what
material will greet him tomorrow,
when the first practice is held. But
he looks with optimism to the coming
year, as boxing, long under the able
eye of Director Harry Maloney, con
tinues high in the Stanford Athletic
program.
The first glimpse that spectators
will have of Frye's boys will be late
this fall, when the Novice Tourna
ment will be held. Most of the ac
tivity in the sport comes winter
quarter, when the University
Championships and intercollegiate
dual meets will be held.
Frye himself was an outstanding
boxer while in college, winning both
Pacific Coast and National Inter
collegiate titles for his alma mater,
Oregon State. He also produced
championship teams for that school
immediately after graduation, when
he was boxing coach there.
