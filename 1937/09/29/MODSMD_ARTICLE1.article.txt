## Strong Nipponese Units Face Annihilation At Hands of Communists 
### 
SHANGHAI, Sept. 29 (Wednes
day) (UP). —Chinese sources re
ported persistently today that the
Japanese have suffered a heavy de
feat in Northwest China by the new
Bth Route Army.
It was asserted that two crack
Japanese columns in the Tatung
area, 170 miles west of Peiping, had
been routed and that considerably
larger forces were in danger of be
ing cut off and annihilated.
Trained Reds
The Bth Route Army consists of
upward of 100,000 veteran soldiers
who for 10 years had fought the na
tional government as the Chinese
communist army under their famous
leader, General Chu Teh. A few
weeks ago they declared their al
legiance to the government to fight
Japan.
From Nanking Soviet Ambassador
Dimitri V. Bogomolov was flying to
Moscow in a specially chartered air
plane today to discuss "urgent dip
lomatic matters" with his govern
ment.
Soviet Aid Asked
Reports were widely circulated
that China has offered Russia wide
spread concessions in return for
Soviet military assistance in her war
with Japan.
Two days ago the Chinese Central
News Agency asserted that the Bth
Route Army under General Chu
had killed or wounded more than
•3000 Japanese near Kwangling, 70
miles southeast of Tatung, after
several earlier successes.
Today the Central News Agency,
in a dispatch from Taiyuan, as
serted that "remnants" of two
crack columns were fleeing in great
confusion from Hungyuan, 35 miles
west of Kwangling, toward Yingsien,
which is south of Tatung.
Harass Japanese
Patrols of the Bth Route Army,
the agency asserted, were constantly
meeting and harassing fleeing Japa
nese troops.
General Chu, according to the dis
patch, hoped soon to capture Yang
chow, on the Peiping-Suiyuan rail
road, and cut off all Japanese forces
in the Tatung-Pintichuan area from
their Kalgan and Nankow pass bases.
It was asserted that the commun
ists have 300 Japanese prisoners and
had captured 60 motor trucks.
Strong Force
The Japanese force in question is
one of considerable strength. It is
the Japanese hope to cut off North
west China from Outer Mongolia—
and Soviet. Russia on the other side.
The Russian Ambassador left the
airport at Wuhu, 50 miles southwest
of Nanking, shortly before it was
bombed by Japanese planes which
raided a dozen cities in the Nanking
area throughout yesterday, killing or
wounding scores of additional Chi
nese civilians.
Aim for Airport
Eyewitnesses said the attack on
Wuhu was concentrated on the air
port and that the city was not
bombed. Chinese military authori
ties deliberately had placed four
old training planes in the center of
the landing field and these were de
stroyed. Hangars in which modern
fighting planes were housed were
not hit.
Twelve Japanese planes partici
pated in the attack and were be
lieved part of flights which earlier
had bombed Nanking, Pukow,
Hangchow, Kwanteh, Chinkiang,
Kashing and other cities.
Reports that the Soviet Ambassa
dor will submit a Chinese proposal
to the Russian government for a
general Chinese - Russian military
pact could not be confirmed.
