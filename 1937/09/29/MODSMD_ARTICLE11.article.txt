# Retailers Warned To Add Sales Tax

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 28 (UP). â€”
The State Board of Equalization to
day warned California retailers that
they specifically must add the 3 per
cent sales tax to all purchases, or
face prosecution. Fred E. Stewart,
board member, said the enforcement
drive will begin October 1.
It is expected to force both con
sumer and retailer to brush up on
their fractions. For example, offi
cials explained, a bartender selling
a 25-cent cocktail either will have to
charge the customer the extra pen
nies or readjust listed prices to the
point where, with taxes added, the
amount will come out even.
If the buying public still is to pur
chase a two-bit cocktail at the old
price of a quarter, the dispensary
will have to list the price at 24 3/10
cents, also showing the seven mill
tax. A 10-cent schooner of beer
simply would be priced at 9 7/10
with the 3 mill tax listed sepa
rately.
