# Gordy Lays Down Traffic Laws
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
When Stanford students come back
to the Farm 4000 strong, it means
just one thing to Campus Cop Gordy
Davis—traffic, because a large share
of the 4000 students come back in
cars.
To keep them from cracking up
themselves and their bright and
shiny cars, Davis has set rules gov
erning traffic around the campus
which will make for surer and safer
living.
Regulation that has caused most
comment is the 25-mile speed limit
on Palm Drive, expressed by the two
new black and white signs at each
end of the drive. Although formerly
there was no marking sign, the limit
has always been 25 miles, but be
cause of a five-mile allowance for
speedometer fluctuations, Davis says,
the 30-mile precedent was estab
lished.
Twenty-five miles is also the speed
limit on Lasuen from Memorial Hall
to Highway 101, except at the five
point intersection by the Faculty |
House, where drivers must slow
down. Maximum speed rate any j
other place on the campus is 20 miles j
per hour. All stop signs must be
obeyed at all times. This means
coming to a full stop.
Parking also is restricted. Stop
ping at the Post Office is permitted
only on one street and on one side |
of that street: in front of the Wom
en's Clubhouse. It is illegal to park j

on the other side of the street. Park
ing is prohibited when it obstructs
the pedestrian entrances to any of
the campus halls. Because Salva
tierra is so narrow, parking is al
lowed only on one side of the street
between Lasuen and Arguello.
One of the most important rules 'on
the campus is the regulation which
prohibits riding on running-boards.
J That rule will be strictly enforced,
because last year—the first year it
was enforced —was the first year no
accidents have occurred in which
someone was hurt riding on the out
side of a car.
Gordy Davis emphasizes the fact
that he is on the campus to pre
vent accidents, not to give out tick
ets. He feels that most Stanford
j drivers want to co-operate with
him, and that most violators break
Farm traffic laws unthinkingly, not
intentionally. He hopes so. But at
any rate, consistent law-breakers
will find themselves meeting with
the Men's Council— and not to talk
about (he weather.
"Also,' says Gordy, "I try to keep
from making arrests a personal af
fair with me. I don't get sore and
bawl offenders out. I just give them
i a ticket and send them to the Men's
! Council." Somehow, that seems
quite sufficient.

Gordy Davis emphasizes the fact
that he is on the campus to pre
vent accidents, not to give out tick
ets. He feels that most Stanford
j drivers want to co-operate with
him, and that most violators break
Farm traffic laws unthinkingly, not
intentionally. He hopes so. But at
any rate, consistent law-breakers
will find themselves meeting with
the Men's Council— and not to talk
about (he weather.

from making arrests a personal af

When Stanford students come back
to the Farm 4000 strong, it means
just one thing to Campus Cop Gordy
Davis—traffic, because a large share
of the 4000 students come back in
cars.
To keep them from cracking up
themselves and their bright and
shiny cars, Davis has set rules gov
erning traffic around the campus
which will make for surer and safer
living.
Regulation that has caused most
comment is the 25-mile speed limit
on Palm Drive, expressed by the two
new black and white signs at each
end of the drive. Although formerly
there was no marking sign, the limit
has always been 25 miles, but be
cause of a five-mile allowance for
speedometer fluctuations, Davis says,
the 30-mile precedent was estab
lished.
Twenty-five miles is also the speed
limit on Lasuen from Memorial Hall
to Highway 101, except at the five
point intersection by the Faculty |
House, where drivers must slow
down. Maximum speed rate any j
other place on the campus is 20 miles j
per hour. All stop signs must be
obeyed at all times. This means
coming to a full stop.
Parking also is restricted. Stop
ping at the Post Office is permitted
only on one street and on one side |
of that street: in front of the Wom
en's Clubhouse. It is illegal to park j

on the other side of the street. Park
ing is prohibited when it obstructs
the pedestrian entrances to any of
the campus halls. Because Salva
tierra is so narrow, parking is al
lowed only on one side of the street
between Lasuen and Arguello.
One of the most important rules 'on
the campus is the regulation which
prohibits riding on running-boards.
J That rule will be strictly enforced,
because last year—the first year it
was enforced —was the first year no
accidents have occurred in which
someone was hurt riding on the out
side of a car.
Gordy Davis emphasizes the fact
that he is on the campus to pre
vent accidents, not to give out tick
ets. He feels that most Stanford
j drivers want to co-operate with
him, and that most violators break
