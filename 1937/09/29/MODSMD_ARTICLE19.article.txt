# Fall Reg Total Hits Record Mark of 3,999
## Estimated Enrollment Of 4000 Is Missed; Further Gain Seen 
### 
Topping last fall's record enroll
ment, 3999 students had registered
at the end of the second day. This
enrollment shows an increase of 78
students over last yeai', and is di
vided into a total of 2837 men and
1162 women.
The second day's registration
brought 2.898 returning students;
these, added to the number of new
students registering yesterday, 1101,
made up the complete total.
More to Come
The increase was spread among
men and women in an approximate
2-1 ratio, with 49 more men enrolled
over last year's number, and 29 more
women.
It is expected that the addition of
late registrations will swell the total
slightly. The trend of enrollment can
be seen in the constant year by year
increase since the depression low of
31G7 students in 1932. Part of this
increase is due to the increased
housing facilities for women.

of the division indicated.
