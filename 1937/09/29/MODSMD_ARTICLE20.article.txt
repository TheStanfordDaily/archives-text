WITH PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT,
EN ROUTE TO SEATTLE, Sept. 28
(U.R).—President Roosevelt said today
that he expected a balanced budget
by the next fiscal year, which begins
July 1, 1938.
He made this remark, almost casu
ally, in an address before he pressed
a button which started first produc
tion of power from auxiliary equip
ment of the still incomplete $51,-
000,000 Bonneville dam project on
the Columbia river in Oregon.
Looking into the future with 10,000
persons gathered in a natural am
phitheater of jagged hills, the Presi
dent proposed division of the coun
)ry into TVA-like authorities for
development of cheap electricity and
other natural resources. He saw a
nation of thriving cities, moderate
in size, turning their industrial ma
chinery on power derived from such
achievements as Bonneville.
He declared the long range federal
local planning program would tend
to decentralize big "industrial cities
by the "widest use" of the low cost
current in rural sections.
