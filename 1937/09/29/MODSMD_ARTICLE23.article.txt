Farm men and women will have their first official view of Memorial
Hall this morning when an all-University assembly formally opens the
new auditorium. President Ray Lyman Wilbur will give the address.
Eleven o'clock classes will be dismissed for the assembly, scheduled to
begin at 11:15.
Letters of invitation have been sent to faculty members by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, in charge of the assembly. Seats on the stage

â–ºwill be reserved for them. Admission
to the reserved section will be by the
west side entrance.
The assembly will close with the
traditional singing of the Stanford
Hymn, led by Warren D. Allen, Uni
versity organist and professor of
music.
Memory to War
With tomorrow's ceremony, Me
morial Hall becomes the official
meeting place of the University com
munity, replacing the old Assembly
Hall next to the Ad Building, now
converted into headquarters for the
Graduate School of Business.
In keeping with the Hall's purpose
as a memorial to those who died in
service, Stanford will honor its 77
World War dead with a special cere
mony October 24. Names of the 77
are inscribed on the Roll of Honor,
posted in the lobby of the Hall.
Drama Center
Memorial Hall will become the
official center of Stanford dramatic
activity with the production of the
first fall play late in October. High
lights of the theatrical season will
be the Big Game Gaieties in No
vember and the annual Spring Show,
with a winter musical being planned
tentatively by Dramatic Council.
Because Memorial Hall was com
pleted early in July, it was used dur
ing summer quarter, principally for
events of the Summer Drama Festi
val, climaxed by the production of
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in
August.
Tomorrow's assembly, replacing
the fall quarter welcoming meet,
has been arranged by the Commit
tee on Public Exercises, under the
direction of Professor E. E. Robin
son. The committee requests all stu
dents to come to the Hall immedi
ately after their 10 o'clock'classes,
enabling the assembly to begin
promptly.
