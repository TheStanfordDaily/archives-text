# Farm Student Left Stranded In War Zone
## Saves Only One Shirt, Toothbrush En Route To Lingnan Campus 
### 
One shirt and a toothbrush were
all that Richard Spencer, Stanford
S.A.E., had with him when he was
.stranded this summer in Hong Kong.
Spencer's war-zone train of trib
ulations started when he left Kobe,
Japan, just ahead of the typhoon
.season for Canton, where he had
planned to attend Lingnan Univer
sity as an exchange student from
Stanford.
When one of the storms caught up
with the ship, they ran aground near
I long Kong, but none of the passen
gers was hurt.
.Goes to Canton
Arriving finally at Canton, Spencer
found that anti-aircraft guns and
camouflaged searchlights had turned
the university campus into a fortress,
shattering the atmosphere of educa
tion.
Having checked his baggage to
Shanghai, where he had intended to
visit for two weeks, Spencer found
that he could not go on to the center
of Japanese-Chinese fighting.
His last letter, received recently
by his parents in Denver, tells how
he went through three air raids and
ran a blockade to get to Hong Kong.
Isolated
"And here we are," he wrote,
"with no safe way of getting back—
no ships, no railroad and no high
way, and I am not going to take a
plane with the Japs flying all around.
"My hand luggage is at Canton.
I left there with a shirt and a tooth
brush. My other baggage is lost
now. The town is packed and over
flowing with refugees and excite
ment. Through pull we have the
mezzanine floor of the Luk Kwok
hotel, sleeping on cots and sofas.
"One ship has gone through the
blockade with an envoy of two
British destroyers. If another goes,
I may be on it. 'Am having the time
of my life. Only one worry—how am
T going to get my baggage from
Lingnan if I go on?"
