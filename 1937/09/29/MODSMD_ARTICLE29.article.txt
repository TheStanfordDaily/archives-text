# A.F.L. Leader Attacks C.I.O.
## Calls for Expulsion Of Industrial Unions 
### 
DENVER, Sept. (U.R). â€”Frank
Duffy, first vice-president of the
American Federation of Labor, called
tonight for expulsion of all C.1.0.
unions after the powerful metal
trades department voted down a
proposal to "hold the door open" for
return of the rebels.
"The present situation in our ranks
cannot be permitted to continue,"
Duffy said shortly after the metal
trades unions overrode their reso
lutions committee's request to re
frain from ouster proceedings.
Duffy represents the International
Brotherhood of Carpenters, largest
union i-emaining loyal to the A. F.
of L.
The scrap arose when Chairman
Arthur O. Wharton's resolutions
committee recommended that the
metal trades take the position that
the C.1.0. had already left the A. F.
of L. and that expulsion was not
necessary. The report was a sur
prising change in Wharton's previous
demands for expulsion of the rebels.
A strong faction, led by John Coe
field, president of the plumbers, op
posed the committee's proposal on
the grounds it might hinder the
drive against the C.1.0. The reso
lution was referred back to com
mittee where delegates will present
their views.
