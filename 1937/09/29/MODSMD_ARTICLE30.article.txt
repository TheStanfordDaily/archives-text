# Business School Moves Into Old Assembly Hall
## Rebuilding Given New Enlarged Quarters 
### BILL MILLIS 
Although carpenters are still busy
putting the finishing touches on a
few uncompleted rooms in the new
quarters of the Graduate School of
Business, the faculty member.; of the
school have completed moving from
their old quarters adjoining the
School of Biology to their new loca
tion in the completely rebuilt former
Assembly Hall.
Tentative estimates based upon
registration figures available yester
day afternoon indicate that for this
quarter there will be an increase of
more than 50 per cent over the en
rollment last year, according to J.
Hugh Jackson, dean of the School
and acting University Comptroller.
Reason Told
Attendance last year totaled 80
first year students and 55 second
year students. Jackson believes that
this quarter the number of first year
students will increase by 75 per cent
to 80 enrollees.
The reason for this significant in
crease in attendance in the business
school, he commented, is that in the
whole field of industry, business, and
commerce there are more types of
professional jobs available than in
any other particular field, and that
business men are showing greater
preference for professionally trained
business school graduates.
Assembly Hall Rebuilt
More than $100,000 was spent dur
ing the summer months in com
pletely rebuilding the old Assembly
Hall into well-designed quarters to
serve the business school.
Construction work commenced last
June 9. The building was cleared out
completely and, aside from wails and
roof, entirely rebuilt. Business
School quarters will now occupy
two floors and a basement, with each
floor possessing approximately 9600
square feet of space.
Stacks Built
Adjoining the wall of the Adminis
tration Building, a six-floor fire
j proof stack room is being built,
j which will have a capacity of nearly
50,000 volumes. Work on these stacks
j will be completed within about three
j weeks, Dean Jackson estimates.
Five class rooms with capacities
varying from 65 to 160 students are
{ provided on the first floor, while in
the rear of the building there are
I two offices, a telephone exchange,
' and the Division of Industrial Rela
j tions library.
The second floor of the Business
| School is devoted entirely to the
j general and reserve libraries and the
I offices of the school. The two main
i floors of the school have a forced
j ventilation system.
History Related
Following a discussion for a num
ber of years of plans for a graduate
1 school for the exclusive purpose of
J business professional training, the
School was inaugurated with the be
-1 ginning of the academic year 1925-
26. In that year there was an at
| tendance of only 15.
In the current issue of the School's
i Bulletin, Dean Jackson comments
that these early years represented
J "pioneering in professional educa-
J tion for business."
He expressed the hope that "our
! first aim and major program will be
1 the maintaining of the spirit of the
j pioneer—that spirit which builds sol
idly and intelligently, and with a
i definite determination that the indi
viduals who go out from the School
into business will recognize their ob-
I ligations and responsibilities not only
i t;o the organizations which they serve
j directly but also to the public at
large.
"In thus doing, the School will
carry forward into all the years of
the future the genuine spirit and
sturdy qualities of the pioneer."

year students. Jackson believes that
this quarter the number of first year
students will increase by 75 per cent
to 80 enrollees.
The reason for this significant in
crease in attendance in the business
school, he commented, is that in the
whole field of industry, business, and
commerce there are more types of
professional jobs available than in
any other particular field, and that
business men are showing greater
preference for professionally trained
business school graduates.
Assembly Hall Rebuilt
More than $100,000 was spent dur
ing the summer months in com
pletely rebuilding the old Assembly
Hall into well-designed quarters to
serve the business school.
Construction work commenced last
June 9. The building was cleared out
completely and, aside from wails and
roof, entirely rebuilt. Business
School quarters will now occupy
two floors and a basement, with each
floor possessing approximately 9600
square feet of space.
Stacks Built
Adjoining the wall of the Adminis
tration Building, a six-floor fire
j proof stack room is being built,
j which will have a capacity of nearly
50,000 volumes. Work on these stacks
j will be completed within about three
j weeks, Dean Jackson estimates.
Five class rooms with capacities
varying from 65 to 160 students are
{ provided on the first floor, while in
the rear of the building there are
I two offices, a telephone exchange,
' and the Division of Industrial Rela
j tions library.
The second floor of the Business
| School is devoted entirely to the
j general and reserve libraries and the
I offices of the school. The two main
i floors of the school have a forced
j ventilation system.
History Related
Following a discussion for a num
ber of years of plans for a graduate
1 school for the exclusive purpose of
J business professional training, the
School was inaugurated with the be
-1 ginning of the academic year 1925-
26. In that year there was an at
| tendance of only 15.
In the current issue of the School's
i Bulletin, Dean Jackson comments
that these early years represented
J "pioneering in professional educa-
J tion for business."
He expressed the hope that "our
! first aim and major program will be
1 the maintaining of the spirit of the
j pioneer—that spirit which builds sol
idly and intelligently, and with a
i definite determination that the indi
viduals who go out from the School
into business will recognize their ob-
I ligations and responsibilities not only
i t;o the organizations which they serve
j directly but also to the public at
large.
"In thus doing, the School will
carry forward into all the years of
the future the genuine spirit and
sturdy qualities of the pioneer."
Although carpenters are still busy
putting the finishing touches on a
few uncompleted rooms in the new
quarters of the Graduate School of
Business, the faculty member.; of the
school have completed moving from
their old quarters adjoining the
School of Biology to their new loca
tion in the completely rebuilt former
Assembly Hall.
Tentative estimates based upon
registration figures available yester
day afternoon indicate that for this
quarter there will be an increase of
more than 50 per cent over the en
rollment last year, according to J.
Hugh Jackson, dean of the School
and acting University Comptroller.
Reason Told
Attendance last year totaled 80
first year students and 55 second
year students. Jackson believes that
this quarter the number of first year
