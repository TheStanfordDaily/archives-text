# Alumni Picture Book Tells Farm History
## 
### ESTELLE SEID 
Commemorating the fiftieth an
niversary of Stanford University,
the Alumni Association will edit a
pictorial history of the development
of the Stanford campus since its
founding.
The book, "Fifty Years on Quad,"
will consist of one thousand pic
tures, most of which have been
collected from the albums of Stan
ford graduates, and will present
many rare photographs of the orig
inal Quad, the original faculty, and
the founders.
Has Four Parts
The review will be divided into
four parts and will embrace all the
phases of development and change
in the years since the laying of the
cornerstone in 1892. The first
buildings, the wreckage of the
earthquake, the reconstruction, and
the latest construction will be in

eluded in the physical aspects.
The old traditions which have
died out and the new ones which
have arisen, the change in fashions
of men and women on the Row and
in the dorms, and the evolution of
student amusements will receive a
section of this historical picture.
Features Sports
All phases of sports in which
Stanford has participated will be
represented. The first football
teams, the crew which once existed
here, and the championship teams in
other sports will get a new play.
This book is offered free to all
alumni who have taken out a five
year or life membership in the
Alumni Association in the last
membership drive. "Fifty Years on
Quad," edited by Norris James, will
be printed by the Universtiy Press
and will be ready for sale some time
in December.
