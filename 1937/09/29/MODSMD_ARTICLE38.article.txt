### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28 (U.P).— I
Walter E. Garrison, president of
Associated Farmers of California,
Inc., warned today agriculturalists !
will take their business elsewhere
than San Francisco unless that city
guarantees them protection from la
bor troubles.
"Farmers do not want to boycott
San Francisco, or any other city,"
Garrison said. "But they will be
forced to invoke such an embargo J
if the metropolitan area permits in
terruption of the delivery of the
crops grown upon farms.
'Regret Necessity'
"If one city denies protection to
the farmers we will have to move
our crops to such localities as will
guarantee us protection. We will
regret the necessity of taking such
action."
Garrison said that California "pro
duces approximately 40 per cent of
all the fresh fruits and vegetables
grown in the United States.'
To interfere with the marketing of
these crops, he said, would bring
about a partial famine as regards
fresh fruits and vegetables.
'Notorious Alien'
Garrison referred to current war
fare at the San Francisco waterfront
between Committee for Industrial
Organization longshoremen and j
warehousemen, and American Fed
eration of Labor teamsters. The !
teamsters have placed an embargo
on dock cargoes.
"Farmers of California will never
surrender to the organization of
their workers under the dictation of
Harry Bridges, the notorious alien,
who controls the Communist-C.1.0.
in this state," Garrison said.
