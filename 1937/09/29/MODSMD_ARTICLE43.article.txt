# Mussolini Sees Fascist Europe
## 
### 
BEPLIN, Sept. 28 (U.R).—Premier
Benito Mussolini, openly announc
ing that thousands of Italian vol
unteers had perished in "the fascist
defense of European civilization" in
Spain, proclaimed to a madly cheer
ing throng of Germans tonight that
"Europe tomorrow will be fascist."
Mussolini and Hitler, the two great
dictators — although Mussolini de
nied in his speech that there is a
dictatorship either in Italy or Ger
many—addressed a throng which
Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels, in his
introductory speech, estimated at
3,000,000 persons.
Both Mussolini and Hitler de
clared their firm desire for peace in
Europe — inferentially in western
Europe, with Soviet Russia excluded.
