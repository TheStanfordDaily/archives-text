# Speed Limit Recalls Era Of One Auto
## 
### 
Now that the speed limit on Palm
Drive has been whittled down to 25
miles an hour, old grads recall
stricter days when no automobiles
were allowed on the Drive. Such
contraptions would have frightened
the buggy-busses' horse power and
have annoyed pedestrians and bi
cyclists, it was thought.
There was one — and only one —
auto in existence on the Stanford
campus. It belonged to Mrs. Stan
ford's brother. Since cars weren't
allowed on the Drive, something had
to be done, and the parallel road
south of the Drive came into being
as a private thoroughfare for the
lone car of the campus.
To even things up, regulations
were made forbidding trespass oij
the road by anything but this auto.
But an air of mystery prevailed. No
matter how many students walked
along the new road (they couldn't
keep pedestrians off) the famous
car was never seen.
