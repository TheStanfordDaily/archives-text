# Fear Ross Dead As Wire Silent
## Police Believe Abduction Made by Amateurs 
### 
CHICAGO, Sept. 28 (UP).—Each
tick of the clock beside the silent
telephone in the apartment home of
aged Charles S. Ross brought new
fears today that he had died in the
hands of his kidnapers.
Mrs. Ross, on the verge of a nerv
ous breakdown, kept vigil beside the
telephone, awaiting instructions from
her wealthy husband or his kidnap
eis. None came.
Ross, 72, was ill when he disap
peared. He suffered a weak heart
which might have collapsed under
sudden strain.
Investigators reasoned that if Ross
were now in a condition to be re
turned to his home, the abductors
would have offered to release him,
probably for $250,000.
Police saw indications that the ab
ductors were amateurs.
Three men in a car halted Ross and
his secretary, Miss Florence Frei
hage, as they were returning from
a dinner-conference in Sycamore,
111., Saturday night. One of them
was so nervous he almost dropped
his gun.
"1 am convinced this was a real
kidnaping, but that it was accom
plished by amateurs," said Captain
Daniel Gilbert, chief of the state's
attorney's police.
Miss Freihage and a bell-boy,
Cecii Vandcrmere, 19, who saw Ross
talking to a strange "man in a gray
cap" in Sycamore's Fargo hotel a
few hours before his kidnaping,
were asked to look at pictures in the
"rogues gallery" of the Federal Bu
reau of Investigation.
Miss Freihage said she would rec
ognize one of the abductors, at least.
