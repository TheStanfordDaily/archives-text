### 
OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Me.,
Sept. 28 (U.R).â€”Swept aloft by a clus
ter of 27 small balloons when his
safety line snapped today, a camera
man was brought safely to earth an
hour later by a sharp-shooting priest
who punctured several of the bags
with rifle fire.
The cameraman was A1 Mingalone,
33, Pelham Manor, N.Y., employed
by Paramount News. The priest was
the Rev. James J. Mullen, pastor of
the Old Orchard Catholic Church.
Discovering the photographer's
plight while motoring, the priest
hurried home, got a rifle and began
sniping at the balloons.
