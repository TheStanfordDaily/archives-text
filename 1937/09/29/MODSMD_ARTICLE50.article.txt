# Brown Bomber Wants To Quit Still Champion
## Louis Will Fight Four More Years, Retire With Title — Maybe 
### 
DETROIT, Sept. 27 (UP). — Joe
Louis yearns to do a "Gene Tunney"
—retire from the ring undefeated.
Not now —but in about four years,
, nd he figures his arms and legs will
< arry him through any and all chal
lengers to his heavyweight cham
pionship over that period, his man
ager, John Roxborough, disclosed
to the United Press tonight.
"Since he licked Braddock, Joe's
greatest ambition has been to retire
: s undefeated champion," Rox
borough said, "and regardless of
how some people have felt since he
won that decision from Tommy Farr,
Joe himself knows his own ability.
He is sure of fighting at least four
more years. If he still holds the title,
or has lost and regained it during
that time, he'll satisfy that ambition
by quitting the ring forever."
Believes in Joe
Roxborough, insurance salesman,
who with Julian Black of Chicago
took over the bomber's destinies
when he turned professional in 1934,
believes the champ will be the same
knockout artist that he was while
climbing to the top.
"Joe's only 23 years old—won't be
24 until next May 13," he said. "He's
a whole lot younger than most of the
other heavyweight champions were
when they won the title. The kid's
just growing and developing,
which means he has several good
years left to defend his crown. Joe
feels great and is suffering from no
physical handicaps. In fact, he is
cocksure he will retire with the title
—say about in 1941. He'll be only
27 then."
Laughs at Rumors
Roxborough laughed at rumors
that Louis planned to retire this
year.
"It's been printed in two or three j
cities since Joe started the national
tour with his softball team," he said,
"and every time I read it I jump on
a telephone and call Joe. He always
just laughs and says he is itching to
fight anybody that comes along, but
particularly Max Schmeling. He is
aching for a chance to redeem him
self from that knockout Maxie put
over last year."
Another erroneous report about
Louis—that he has earned a million
dollars and is working on his second
million—was spiked by Roxborough.
Drains on Income
"For his first few years in the
ring, Joe probably has gotten along
better than any fighter in history,"
he stated, "but his total earnings
have been about $977,000, and there
are at least six drains on his income.
There are expenses for each fight,
managers artd trainers' fees, and in
come taxes. He supports his mother,
brothers and sisters in addition to
having his own household to keep
up."
The comanager has been chief
financial adviser to Louis and has
established several rosy annuities
for "his boy. - ' He has also assisted
him in the purchase of real estate
and other investments. Joe now
owns an apartment house in Detroit's
negro section, has an interest in the
"Brown Bomber Chicken Shack,"
and has bought a comfortable home
hqre for his mother.
"No matter what happens, Joe
won't have to go back to work on
any automobile assembly line,"
Roxborough concluded. "When he
retires from the ring he's going to be
a very wealthy man."
