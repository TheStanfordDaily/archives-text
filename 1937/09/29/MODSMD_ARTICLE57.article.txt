### 
Harry Shipkey and the frosh foot
! ball coaching stafl are convinced that
| Stanford will see a different football
team against Modesto J.C. here next
i Saturday, in spite of the fact that
They are confident that the young
Indians have a good chance to win
Saturday, in sipte of the fact that
Modesto is rated nearly as high as
the strong Santa Ana teem.
"We will be a much stronger
team when we don't have the apti
tude test and injuries keeping half
of our best men out," line-coach
Woodie Adams said. "I think we
should beat Modesto."
The coaches think that the ab
sence of Halfback Thor Peterson is
one of the reasons Stanford lost to
Santa Ana last week, and that his
presence Saturday may mean a
redskin victory. Peterson, who is
the best kicker, shiftiest runner, and
as good a passer as Norm Standlee,
was out of the Santa Ana tilt with a
bruised heel and a stomach ailment.
Practice this week will be con
•centrated on fundamentals, block
ing, tackling, and smoothing out the
rough spots in the plays.
