### 
PAKIS. Sept. 28 (UP).-The Duke
of Windsor, as popular in self
chosen exile as he was as king, dis
covered today after 24 hours of
dodging Paris crowds that the only
place he could find privacy was in a
Turkish bath.
Taking a day off while the Duch
ess went on a shopping spree, the
duke finally was forced to duck into
the American hospital for a "bracer,"
the British equivalent for a steam
bath. When he came out he found
he had not only "braced" himself but
set a new Parisian fad.
