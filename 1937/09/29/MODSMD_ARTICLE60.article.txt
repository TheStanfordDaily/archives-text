# Net Fans Up In Air Over Prospects
## 
### 
The serious loss of last year's
stars, the impact of a strong fresh
man squad, and the fact that there
are only a small group of men of
known strength returning, all com
bine to leave Stanford tennis fans
up in the air when it comes to judg
ing this season's prospects.
Ben Dey and Bill Seward, former
intercollegiate doubles champs, as
well as Jack Lynch and Bob Palmer,
have graduated. The imposing list
of freshmen entries is headed by Bob
Low, last year's high school inter

scholastic champion.
Foremost of those returning are
Bob Underwood, Bob Braly, and
Jim Seaver, of last year's frosh.
Outside of these men it is anybody's
guess as to how the team will shape
up.
Some light will be thrown on the
matter by the annual novice tennis
tournament, sign-ups for which be
gin today in Encina Gym. The nov
ice competition is open to all stu
dents who have not earned a varsity
letter or were not members of last

| year'jt frosh tennis team. The win-
J ner will receive the perpetual tro
phy; but more important to Coach
Lockwood and Bugge will be a par
tial determination of how the new
material is going to line up.
