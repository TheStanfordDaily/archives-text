# Regulars Score Twice In Scrimmage With Subs
## Graves Stars With 2 Trips Over Goal Line Tiny Takes Advantage Of Cold Weather To Hold Long Session 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Stafford's regular varsity grid
combination won its first game of
the season yesterday—by a 12-0
score over a picked team of second
and third-string men.
The scrimmage climaxed the long
est practice session the ball players
have been put through this year. A
cool breeze gave relief after a series
of hot days, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill took advantage of favorable
weather by inviting the boys to come
early and stay late.
Jim Groves stood out as the shin
ing star, claiming the only two
touchdowns of the afternoon. The
first came shortly after the beginning
of the game on the longest, fastest
run of the day. Groves carried the
ball nearly half the length of the
lie Id, followed closely by his red
jerseyed opponents.
Stone Calls Signals
Grant Stone called signals for the
regulars, and it was indicated that
he is in line for the barker's job de
spite denials from those who should
know.
Although Coach Thornhill and his
staff members insist that Bill Paul
man and Doc Luckett will do the
brain-work in the Oregon gunie at
Eugene Saturday, it will not be sur
prising if Stone is suddenly chosen
to take the helm.
The most significant line-shift of
the day was centered about Bobby
Matthews. Until yesterday the short
stalky guard had been seen on the
right side of the fine, but the scrim
mage found him a left guard.
It was on this side that weaknesses
appeared Saturday in the Santa
Clara game, so it is not surprising
that new material is being recruited
for the left guard spot. Matthews
saw plenty of service last season, and
may see plenty before this one is
over.
Pau I man Passes
The Paulman-to-Stone and Paul- i
man-to-Groves passing combinations j
were both in perfect order, and the •
blond ball-toser continued to show
phenomenal ability in choosing re
ceivers. J
Two hard long sessions of block- j
ing, tackling, and charging practice
had brought considerable improve- j
ment since Saturday, and many bad j
spots seem to have been ironed out. |
Irv Cummings was in pads again !
after a week-end sojourn to the I
hospital, but was not yet up to
scrimmage. Calvelli was also re- !
leased with only a slight remaining' I
cold.
Ed Gamier had also made his hos- !
pital exit, but he wore only a sweat !
suit. His ankle is still bad, and he !
may not use it before the team leaves !
for Eugene Thursday night. It is
likely, however, that he will be able !
to play Saturday.
The only serious injury of the day j
came in the "two and one" blocking
practice preceding the scrimmage. I
Pete Skaer, an end transfer, was sent
to the hospital with a bad knee.
