WHAT THE DAILY CAL
SPORTS EDITOR SAYS

Let's take a little side step off
the football turf for today and stand
behind the fair name of Stanford
and a husky gent- who spends his
spare time coaching aquatic sports
on the Farm.
Dick Toner, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, in his column last
month wrote a sweet little ditty all
about how the "southerners" (Stan
ford students) always get in the first
blow in the annual feud between
Cal and Stanford.
Mr. Tyner claims that the "south
erners" have "outdone themselves
and taken the first crack at the Bears
even before the latter could be or
ganized enough to retort."
The chief of the Daily Californian's
sports pages blames the first Indian
slam of the season on Card water
polo coach Nort Thornton.
It seems that Thornton was quoted
quite extensively in an article in the
Summer Daily, printed by summer
school journalism classes. Nort's
supposed opinions on the coming
Coast Conference water polo chase
are what caused the uprising in
Bear aquatic circles in general and
in Mr. Toner's column in particu
lar.

WHOLE THING WAS
A BIG MISTAKE

The whole thing was one big mis
take—it was NOT meant to be a
slam at our worthy friends up
Strawberry Canyon way either by
the Card water polo .mentor or the
writer of the article.
It happens that a gentleman,
whose name I shall not divulge, was
writing sports for the summer Daily.
Now this gentleman has an extra
dash of imagination in his make-up,
especially when it comes to writing.
People way back east were hear

ing reports that Tiny Thornhill was
planning on taking the Rose Bowl
by storm this season. Traced down
to its original source, it was discov
ered that Thornhill had told this
imaginative wi'iter that Stanford
would have a better team than last
year—those were Tiny's words in
plain, simple language. But Tiny's
quotes appearing in print predicted
nothing less than an iron clad op
tion on the Pasadena finger bowl.

CARD MENTOR
HAS NO PREDICTIONS

To get back to the situation at
hand, Nort Thornton is fully aware
of the fact that the Bears have po
tentially the best water polo team
on the coast this year. Upon further
prodding Genial Nort might even
break down and praise the Bears
as the best college team in the en
tire country this year.
If we can forget about the sum

mer school writer, Nort rates the
Bear aqua polo team first; U.C.L.A.,
second; and,a dog fight between a
weakened defending championship
Stanford septet and the highly im
proved Trojans of U.C.S. for third
place.
The Card mentor does NOT pre
dict another championship for his
team, but Mr. Thornton is a very
handy gent when it comes to teach
ing aspiring young aquarians to pile
up water polo points and this col
umn looks for the Indians to give
the highly touted Bears a real splash
in the two-game series this fall.
I hope this clears up the situation
for Mr. Toner and Bear sports fans.
Incidentally, the imaginative gent
is not writing sports for the Daily
now, so you'll have to look a little
harder, Dick, for the first real Cardi
nal slam of the current Indian-Bear
feuding. —Gene Gear

ered that Thornhill had told this
imaginative wi'iter that Stanford
would have a better team than last
year—those were Tiny's words in
plain, simple language. But Tiny's
quotes appearing in print predicted
nothing less than an iron clad op
tion on the Pasadena finger bowl.

CARD MENTOR
HAS NO PREDICTIONS

To get back to the situation at
hand, Nort Thornton is fully aware
of the fact that the Bears have po
tentially the best water polo team
on the coast this year. Upon further
prodding Genial Nort might even
break down and praise the Bears
as the best college team in the en
tire country this year.
If we can forget about the sum

mer school writer, Nort rates the
Bear aqua polo team first; U.C.L.A.,
second; and,a dog fight between a
weakened defending championship
Stanford septet and the highly im
proved Trojans of U.C.S. for third
place.
The Card mentor does NOT pre
dict another championship for his
team, but Mr. Thornton is a very
handy gent when it comes to teach
ing aspiring young aquarians to pile
up water polo points and this col
umn looks for the Indians to give
the highly touted Bears a real splash
in the two-game series this fall.
I hope this clears up the situation
for Mr. Toner and Bear sports fans.
Incidentally, the imaginative gent
is not writing sports for the Daily
now, so you'll have to look a little
harder, Dick, for the first real Cardi
nal slam of the current Indian-Bear
feuding. —Gene Gear
WHAT THE DAILY CAL
SPORTS EDITOR SAYS

Let's take a little side step off
the football turf for today and stand
behind the fair name of Stanford
and a husky gent- who spends his
spare time coaching aquatic sports
on the Farm.
Dick Toner, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, in his column last
month wrote a sweet little ditty all
about how the "southerners" (Stan
ford students) always get in the first
blow in the annual feud between
Cal and Stanford.
Mr. Tyner claims that the "south
erners" have "outdone themselves
and taken the first crack at the Bears
even before the latter could be or
ganized enough to retort."
The chief of the Daily Californian's
sports pages blames the first Indian
slam of the season on Card water
polo coach Nort Thornton.
It seems that Thornton was quoted
quite extensively in an article in the
Summer Daily, printed by summer
school journalism classes. Nort's
supposed opinions on the coming
Coast Conference water polo chase
are what caused the uprising in
Bear aquatic circles in general and
in Mr. Toner's column in particu
lar.

WHOLE THING WAS
A BIG MISTAKE

The whole thing was one big mis
take—it was NOT meant to be a
slam at our worthy friends up
Strawberry Canyon way either by
the Card water polo .mentor or the
writer of the article.
It happens that a gentleman,
whose name I shall not divulge, was
writing sports for the summer Daily.
Now this gentleman has an extra
dash of imagination in his make-up,
especially when it comes to writing.
People way back east were hear

ing reports that Tiny Thornhill was
planning on taking the Rose Bowl
by storm this season. Traced down
to its original source, it was discov
ered that Thornhill had told this
imaginative wi'iter that Stanford
would have a better team than last
year—those were Tiny's words in
plain, simple language. But Tiny's
