# WATER POLO BEGINS
## Nineteen Frosh Turn Out 
### 
Class of '41 swimmers made their
initial dives into Encina Pool waters
yesterday in the first practice ses
sion of the freshman water polo
squad.
Nineteen of the largest neophyte
mermen in Stanford history turned
out. Some had never touched a
water polo ball; many knew a little
about handling one, and very few
were expert.
Thornton Aids
Freshman Coach Dave Rider was
aided during his first hour as a
swimming mentor by Varsity Coach
Nort Thornton, who will work with
the freshmen every day before the
veterans come out.
Rider's name is by no means new
in Stanford swimming circles. He
has long been heralded as master of
the 1500-meter and other long-dis
tance swims. But he has not had a
great deal of water polo experience

and will be aided considerably by
Coach Thornton's long coaching ex
perience.
Maurer Outstanding
Rex Maurer is outstanding candi
date of the squad. He attended
practice with the varsity last spring, I
but was not here in the fall. He
also worked during the summer un
der the varsity mentor's supervision.
Robert Tietjen looms as the sec
ond regular for the frosh and makes
a good showing in any position, j
Lanky John Botsford was the only I
good prospect in the goal, while Roy
Vitousek stood out as a ball-tosser ,
with a mighty right arm.
Fastest members of the squad are :
Flint, Maurer, Jessup, Vitousek,
Tietjen, and Morris. Other candi
dates are Copp, Pfleuger, Sherman,
Watrous, Ward, Einstein, Spensley,
Moreno, Jamieson, Walling, and
Frost.
