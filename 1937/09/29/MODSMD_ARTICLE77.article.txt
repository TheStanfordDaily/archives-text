## Thirty Minus Five Equals "Thirty" 
### 
ALARMISTS who shuddered at the word of
a five-mile speed-limit reduction on Palm
D r i ve —30 to 25 —may now quiet their palpi
tating brains on these salient facts and per
haps become realarmed at the complicacy of
such simplicity.
The speed limit on Palm Drive has always
been recognized as 30 m.p.h.
The speed limit on Palm Drive is now 25
m.p.h.
But there has been no change in the speed
limit on Palm Drive.
Those of our alarmed alarmists who consulted
Stanford's guardian of the law, Gordy Davis,
found him quite able to unmuddle the appar
ent garbling of a couple of unpretentious speed
laws. He ungarbles thusly:
For years the limit on Palm Drive has been
25, but because of a five-mile allowance for
"speedometer fluctuations, it was interpreted

as 30. (The allowance is really to stymie grip
ing by those arrested for a less than five-mile
infraction of the limit.)
After a dozerl years of wheeling cop-free at
30, the old 25 limit was forgotten—buried under
a mudbank of precedent. Thirty became the
recognized speed.
But the other day Gordy wanted to put up
signs to remind the dynamiters that 45 would
not do, and in order to maintain consistency
with California State provisions the old phan
tom 25 was dusted off and the signs went up.
But today the old five-mile allowance still
holds. And today, despite the signs, the tra
ditional 30 will be recognized.
All of which makes much ado about nothing
except a couple of signs which don't really mean
what they say, and a couple of speed limits that
don't really say what they mean.
But Gordy Davis does. Says he, "Keep 'er
around 30 and we're friends."
