# Obit to Stanford's "Ox Road"
## 
### 
TWENTY-FIVE years ago a tree surgeon came
to the Farm.
He came to work out a scheme to beautify
Governor's Lane, with its twin rows of giant
eucalyptus trees, to trim off the tops of the trees
in order that a second growth of low, arching
limbs would intertwine above the road.
But his work was too successful.
Today, a quarter of a century later, his trees
stand as a monument to foresight and skill —
but they stand where few can see them!
Today Governor's Lane—favorite haunt of the
spring-struck and Stanford s old ox road is
closed, closed as a safety measure lest heavy
limbs resulting from the twenty-five-year-old
trimming crack off and crash upon the road
below.
When University officials blocked off the lane
last year, editorial columns of The Daily were
filled with complaint, and the campus rightly
alassed and alacked over the loss of another
tradition.
Few heard the explanation —that eucalypti
that have been allowed to grow naturally are
quite safe, but trimming weakens them so that
even on calm days thousand-pound, branches
are liable to fall.
Few realized—but all should know now—that
it was merely a case of ambitious foresight
boomeranging into failure.

Vanity is the more odious and shocking to
everybody, because everybody, without excep
tion, has vanity; and two vanities can never love
one another. —Lord Chesterfield
Writing is not literature unless it gives to the
reader a pleasure which arises not only from
the things said, but from the way in which they
are said.—Stopford A. Brooke
