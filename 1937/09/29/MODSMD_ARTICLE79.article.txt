# BULL SESSION
## COME THE EVOLUTION 
### 
r |' , o the battered self-esteem of psychologists and so
ciologists, freshman behavior has been a salve for
a number of years. Muddle-headed rats may miss
every turn in the maze, and the mouths of conditioned
dogs may water at the wrong time; but the consistent,
patterned reactions of the frosh can be predicted by
any observer. The average first-year man invariably
swings from submission to rebellion, and finally winds
up with evidences of rudimentary intelligence, which
the cynics say, is more than most of humanity ever
exhibits.
The process by which the university shapes its new
men is a subtle one; it involves no coercion or stern
ness, but it is interesting to note that in the end, the
school shapes the freshman, no matter how determined
he is to remake the school.
The average first-year man arrives at the univer
sity in a state of malleable bewilderment, like a newly
initiated knight off to pick a fight with one of the
more popular dragons. He entrusts his trunk to a man
who looks like a bandit, receives no receipt, and after
various wanderings finds himself in one of Encina's
bleak cells, feeling about as much at home as a horse
in a garage.

rjURING the ensuing week, the university concen
trates on patching the leaky self-confidence of the
freshman. Assorted brass-hats tell him that he is the
back-bone of the college, that he is blessed above most
men, that he owns a first mortgage on the world.
His trunk arrives, restoring his faith in the goodness
and personal intervention of God. And after about
three or four days, the frosh oozes assurance and high
schoolism.
It is this state of mind that keeps the freshman
from merging into the university and becoming an
indistinguishable part of it. It is this attitude that
makes him tread on the toes of upper classmen, and
causes his violation of traditions to appear criminal
instead of unimportant.
In past generations the upperclassmen used mob
violence and fascist terrorism to shatter the freshman's
concrete cocksureness. Hot and cold applications ad
ministered by means of paddles and mill ponds were
considered the best cure for swell head. But today
the frosh must be manhandled with care, and upper
classmen may not touch.
Now the universities rely on example and matura
tion to lead the frosh into green pastures, and make
them lie down quietly. Administrators know from
experience that new men gradually arrive at the
realization that water-bag throwing is not suited to
a life profession. Eventually (if you like beautiful
thoughts) the frosh emerge from their chrysalis as
glorious butterfles. If they did not there would be no
upperclassmen to grumble about the new freshmen.

patterned reactions of the frosh can be predicted by
any observer. The average first-year man invariably
swings from submission to rebellion, and finally winds
up with evidences of rudimentary intelligence, which
the cynics say, is more than most of humanity ever
exhibits.
The process by which the university shapes its new
men is a subtle one; it involves no coercion or stern
ness, but it is interesting to note that in the end, the
school shapes the freshman, no matter how determined
he is to remake the school.
The average first-year man arrives at the univer
sity in a state of malleable bewilderment, like a newly
initiated knight off to pick a fight with one of the
more popular dragons. He entrusts his trunk to a man
who looks like a bandit, receives no receipt, and after
various wanderings finds himself in one of Encina's
bleak cells, feeling about as much at home as a horse
in a garage.

rjURING the ensuing week, the university concen
trates on patching the leaky self-confidence of the
freshman. Assorted brass-hats tell him that he is the
back-bone of the college, that he is blessed above most
men, that he owns a first mortgage on the world.
His trunk arrives, restoring his faith in the goodness
and personal intervention of God. And after about
three or four days, the frosh oozes assurance and high
schoolism.
It is this state of mind that keeps the freshman
from merging into the university and becoming an
indistinguishable part of it. It is this attitude that
makes him tread on the toes of upper classmen, and
causes his violation of traditions to appear criminal
instead of unimportant.
In past generations the upperclassmen used mob
violence and fascist terrorism to shatter the freshman's
concrete cocksureness. Hot and cold applications ad
ministered by means of paddles and mill ponds were
considered the best cure for swell head. But today
the frosh must be manhandled with care, and upper
classmen may not touch.
Now the universities rely on example and matura
tion to lead the frosh into green pastures, and make
them lie down quietly. Administrators know from
experience that new men gradually arrive at the
realization that water-bag throwing is not suited to
a life profession. Eventually (if you like beautiful
thoughts) the frosh emerge from their chrysalis as
glorious butterfles. If they did not there would be no
upperclassmen to grumble about the new freshmen.
