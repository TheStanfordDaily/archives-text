### 
TODAY is Wednesday, and on Wednesday,
which is today, all Stanford Daily staff mem
bers, tried and true, will meet at 1:15 o'clock for
the first weekly chit chat of Volume 92.
Youth is to all the glad season of life; but often
only by what it hopes, not by what it attains or
what it escapes.â€”Schiller
