jV"OW that the era of the water-bag at Encina is in
again, a new method of depleting the frosh's $10
breakage fee has come into view.
One of Palo Alto's Special Delivery Post Officers
brought a letter to a fond son from his likewise fond
mother to the castle of Campus Youth, Encina. Before
he was able to climb the stairs and deliver the epistle,
he was bombed from above by two pounds of water,
enclosed in a brown manilla bag.
Irate, he retreated damp quick and knocked violent
ly on the office door. Once in, he successfully de
manded of the management moneys for the purpose of
pressing his pants, the item most damaged by the aerial
attack. Thereupon, he stated that should he ever be
ordered to deliver a letter to "that foul hole," he would
stand in front of the building and scream till the in
habitants poured out and took the letter to its proper
owner.
With the publication of this ultimatum, little does he
realize that he will scream in vain, unless he attracts
a chance water-bag poured out from an upper or lower
floor.
Another complication arises with the payment of
the cleaning bill. Will the Encina Club advance a cer
tain fund toward the cleaning and pressing of pants
involved in the v/ater-bag scandal or will it deny the
precedent? One new freshman wants to know what
will become of his famous breakage refund.

I" bulletin from the front of the Administra
tion building where ex-Encina-H-'Men have been
propounding the merits of Our Late Hasher's "Gar
bage Book" involves the story of a somewhat antique
gentleman who inquired about the author of the book,
discussed its merits and asked the price. When told it
was only one-half dollar, he said nothing but walked
to the nearest stack of Dailys and picked one up—
free.
* * * *
any wrong conjectures be made about the re
liability or the value of the Stanford Aptitude
test, it would be apt at this point to report a conver
sation between a Utah transfer and a freshman on the
'41 football team.
The former, somewhat puzzled on the reecipt of a
card which said he had passed the test in Group I,
asked the latter if he had taken the test and what
Group I meant.
The freshman replied to the effect that he had been
in Group 111, and produced the card telling about it,
saying:
You see, if you re in Group 111, you have seven
out of ten chances of succeeding in college. But—if
you fall into Group I, you have nine out of ten chances
of getting there. You see, in this case, you become
just one of the mob."

again, a new method of depleting the frosh's $10
breakage fee has come into view.
One of Palo Alto's Special Delivery Post Officers
brought a letter to a fond son from his likewise fond
mother to the castle of Campus Youth, Encina. Before
he was able to climb the stairs and deliver the epistle,
he was bombed from above by two pounds of water,
enclosed in a brown manilla bag.
Irate, he retreated damp quick and knocked violent
ly on the office door. Once in, he successfully de
manded of the management moneys for the purpose of
pressing his pants, the item most damaged by the aerial
attack. Thereupon, he stated that should he ever be
ordered to deliver a letter to "that foul hole," he would
stand in front of the building and scream till the in
habitants poured out and took the letter to its proper
owner.
With the publication of this ultimatum, little does he
realize that he will scream in vain, unless he attracts
a chance water-bag poured out from an upper or lower
floor.
Another complication arises with the payment of
the cleaning bill. Will the Encina Club advance a cer
tain fund toward the cleaning and pressing of pants
involved in the v/ater-bag scandal or will it deny the
precedent? One new freshman wants to know what
will become of his famous breakage refund.

I" bulletin from the front of the Administra
tion building where ex-Encina-H-'Men have been
propounding the merits of Our Late Hasher's "Gar
bage Book" involves the story of a somewhat antique
gentleman who inquired about the author of the book,
discussed its merits and asked the price. When told it
was only one-half dollar, he said nothing but walked
to the nearest stack of Dailys and picked one up—
free.

any wrong conjectures be made about the re
liability or the value of the Stanford Aptitude
test, it would be apt at this point to report a conver
sation between a Utah transfer and a freshman on the
'41 football team.
The former, somewhat puzzled on the reecipt of a
card which said he had passed the test in Group I,
asked the latter if he had taken the test and what
Group I meant.
The freshman replied to the effect that he had been
in Group 111, and produced the card telling about it,
saying:
You see, if you re in Group 111, you have seven
out of ten chances of succeeding in college. But—if
you fall into Group I, you have nine out of ten chances
of getting there. You see, in this case, you become
just one of the mob."
jV"OW that the era of the water-bag at Encina is in
again, a new method of depleting the frosh's $10
