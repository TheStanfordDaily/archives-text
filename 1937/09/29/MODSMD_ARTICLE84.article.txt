# Muni Excells In 'Zola' At St. Francis
## 
### 
"The Life of Emile Zola" (St.
Francis, San Francisco). With a role
admirably suited to his special tal
ents, Paul Muni repeats the quality
of work which won him last year's
award for finest performance.
With Muni leading, yet not over
shadowing, a fine cast, the whole
picture has a finesse which marks it
as outstanding. He is able to create
a character which, while showing
remarkable attention to detail, can
carry a picture with its sweep and
power. For this reason, biographical
plays which often depend more on
the central character than on the
sequence of events, lose no vitality
in his hands.
But, as Emile Zola, Muni is given
a story dramatic enough in itself to
be fit" fare for pictures, regardless of
the importance of the man connected
with it. In an adapted version of the
famous Dreyfus case, Zola is top
pled from his perch as literary lion
of France, into the very center of the
whole noisesome broth of the scan
dal. His celebrated, "J'Accuse,"
criticism of the government, places
him on trial, results in his exile; he
is brought back when a new gov
ernmental regime investigates the
case, acquits Dreyfus.
Muni's is not the only fine per
formance. Joseph Schildkraut's
work as Captain Dreyfus is a vivid
and poignant thing. Vladimir Soko
loff's Paul Cezanne will catch your
eye.
But it is Muni that you will watch.
His artistry makes Anatol France's
tribute to Zola no hollow thing: "He
was a moment in the conscience of
man."
