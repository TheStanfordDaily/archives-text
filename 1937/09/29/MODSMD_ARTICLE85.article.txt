# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Dozing in the peaceful tranquility
of Encina's noiseless corridors, I was
aroused today, not by a water
bomb (Sponsor Zagar is feeling well
again), but by Stanford's journalistic
torpedo, The Daily. I noticed there
isn't a Campus Opinion yet, but I
trust by the time this arrives there
will be enough "beefers" and "pol
ishers" to start one.
I come (as Brutus said) neither to
beef nor to polish, merely to inquire.
(And that, after all, is what fresh
men are for.)
Changing style from Shakespeare
to direct approach, may I ask what
Bull-Sessioner John Cobbs, the "de
tached observer of the modern era"
means by "Stanford's nearest ap
proach to a radical"? As an impartial

observer I am inclined to agree with
Mr. Cobbs on the "high and mighty"
part of his description of Abe Mel
linkoff, BUT . . . Well, what does
he mean by that radical-rave?
Bull Session and the Daily sound
good (and stimulating). And in the
Encinasylum a stimulant disturbs.
Yours from the land of
peaceful corridors,
Sherman Mellinkoff
