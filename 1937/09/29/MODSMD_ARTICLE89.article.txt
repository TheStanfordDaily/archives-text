The rungs of success may be dif
ficult to climb, but the ladder to the
top of the Bell Tower offers close
competition.
A Daily newshawk, curious to get
a look at the bells that punctually
awaken the campus at 7:30 every
morning, ascended a shaky ladder to
emerge, dripping with cob-webs,
on the roof.
The four bells are mounted on
wooden beams, their clappers oper
ated by wires from the mechanism
house inside the tower. Each bears
the name of the caster and the date,
1901. Originally meant for the
steeple on the chapel, they were
set up in their present location about

| 1912, after having fallen through the
chapel roof during the earthquake of
1906.
1 lie bells have to be hooked up
daily, after being disconnected at 10
o'clock for the night, a job which
falls to Matt Potovick of the yard..
The University electrician tells of
the campus wag who, a few years
ago, tampered with the bells, trying
to cross wires so that the notes
would intone "How Dry I Am."
The mechanism of the clock is
worked by weights, which are
wound every few days.
