# Theater Will Offer Double Opening Bill
## Drama, Comic Operetta To Be First Autumn Presentation in Hall 
### 
First night in Memorial Hall for
regular session students will be a
double Ml, "Murder in the Cathe
dral," by T. S. Eliot and "Trial by
Jury" by Gilbert and Sullivan, ac
cording to the announcement of Di
rector Gordon C. Lange.
The performance may be called
"The Comic and Tragic in British
Justice" because completely con
trasting vehicles are being presented.
"Murder in the Cathedral" is a
drama, partially in verse, depicting
the 'Martyrdom of Thomas Beck
ett at the hands of four knights of
the English king. The action of this
fine work is intensely dramatic, and
the plot has an almost universal
significance.
Operetta a Satire
The fact that most men with gi-eat
visions and the power to realize their
plans are misunderstood by the
world is the basis for the philosophy
of the play. Mr. Eliot, one of the
greatest contemporary poets, has
written a powerful and beautiful
historical drama which carries a
message of great importance to the
audience.
To complete the bill Stanford ac
tors will turn toward the comic muse
and present "Trial by Jury," a lively
satire on British justice and court
procedure. This short operetta was
the first work of the great team of
Gilbert and Sullivan.
Warren D. Allen, professor of mu
sic, will supervise the'production of
"Trial by Jury," since the cast con
sists almost entirely of singers. The
lively musical score follows the Gil
bert and Sullivan tradition, well ex
emplified by popular "The Mikado,"
"S.S. Pinafore," and "The Pirates of
Penzance."
Music Department Represented
The inclusion of this attraction on
the new theater's opening bill gives
recognition of the importance of the
Music Department in the new speech
and drama set-up. It will also coun
terbalance the sombre "Murder in
the Cathedral" with humor by the
greatest writers of comic opera.
Settings for the productions will be
designed by Waldemar Johansen.
Both vehicles are proven suc
cesses. "Trial by Jury" is an "old
standby" all over the English
speaking world but still retains its
freshness and satirical comedy.
"Murder in the Cathedral" has been
presented successfully in London,
by the Federal Theater in New
York, by the Yale University School
of Drama, and by the Pasadena Com
munity Playhouse since it was writ
ten several years ago.

in the Cathedral" will not be limited

Both vehicles are proven suc
cesses. "Trial by Jury" is an "old
standby" all over the English
speaking world but still retains its
freshness and satirical comedy.
"Murder in the Cathedral" has been
presented successfully in London,
by the Federal Theater in New
York, by the Yale University School

in the Cathedral" will not be limited
to members of the speech and drama
classes. Parts are open to all stu
dents who are interested, according
to Director Lange. Tryouts will be
held in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall from 4 to 5 this after

en's Glee Clubs and the choir. Try
outs for these organizations will be
held today at 1 and tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the choir room.
First night in Memorial Hall for
regular session students will be a
double Ml, "Murder in the Cathe
dral," by T. S. Eliot and "Trial by
Jury" by Gilbert and Sullivan, ac
cording to the announcement of Di
rector Gordon C. Lange.

Justice" because completely con
trasting vehicles are being presented.
"Murder in the Cathedral" is a
drama, partially in verse, depicting
the 'Martyrdom of Thomas Beck
ett at the hands of four knights of
the English king. The action of this
fine work is intensely dramatic, and
the plot has an almost universal
significance.
Operetta a Satire
The fact that most men with gi-eat
visions and the power to realize their
plans are misunderstood by the
world is the basis for the philosophy
of the play. Mr. Eliot, one of the
greatest contemporary poets, has
written a powerful and beautiful
historical drama which carries a
message of great importance to the
audience.
To complete the bill Stanford ac
tors will turn toward the comic muse
and present "Trial by Jury," a lively
satire on British justice and court
procedure. This short operetta was
the first work of the great team of
Gilbert and Sullivan.
Warren D. Allen, professor of mu
sic, will supervise the'production of
"Trial by Jury," since the cast con
sists almost entirely of singers. The
lively musical score follows the Gil
bert and Sullivan tradition, well ex
emplified by popular "The Mikado,"
"S.S. Pinafore," and "The Pirates of
Penzance."
Music Department Represented
The inclusion of this attraction on
the new theater's opening bill gives
recognition of the importance of the
Music Department in the new speech
and drama set-up. It will also coun
terbalance the sombre "Murder in
the Cathedral" with humor by the
greatest writers of comic opera.
