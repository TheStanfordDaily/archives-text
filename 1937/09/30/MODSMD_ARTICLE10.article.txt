SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29 (UP).
â€”San Francisco's Embarcadero, key
port in a discontinued teamsters'
embargo, roared today with the wa
terfront commerce tied up 28 days
by a jurisdictional fight between
American Federation of Labor team
sters and Committee for Industrial
Organization longshoremen and
warehousemen.
Observers said that within 24
hours after the teamsters called off
their embargo at the "request" of
the farmers of California, water
borne and dock traffic had reached
normal. Five hundred heavy trucks
rolled over waterfront cobblestones
moving the freight;
The teamsters have served notice
they will continue their fight with
longshoremen for jurisdiction over
warehousemen, despite the rulings
of the National Labor Relations
Board and the refusal of other un
ions to recognize teamster picket
lines.
