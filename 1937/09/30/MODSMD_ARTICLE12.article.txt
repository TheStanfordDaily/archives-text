# Wilbur Talks To Students At Assembly
## Memorial Hall Opening Marked by Overflow Assembly of 2000 
### 
"All government is like student
government," President Ray Lyman
Wilbur told 2,000 Stanford students
and faculty members who crowded
Memorial Hall yesterday morning
for its formal opening. "To be suc
cessful it requires participation on
the part of its citizens. No form of
government operates itself—all of us
are put "on the spot'."
Stressing the spiritual qualities
necessary to the individual, Dr. Wil
bur said, "Cynicism means a loss of
faith in self and in human nature.
When it becomes nationwide it is
easy to have the development of
either fascism or communism. Both
of these represent a low ideal and
lack of spirit."
Warns of Bad Habits
Dr. Wilbur warned the assemblage
about the danger of bad habits when
he cautioned, "Look yourself and
your plan of life over if you have
gotten so that you can't operate the
wonderful machine given to you by
God without snarling it up with al
cohol, nicotine, caffeine, aspirin, pep
per and other forms of gravel and
emery to work on the bearings and
choke up the motor. Leave some
thing for the days when the fight
against fat begins."
Yesterday's assembly marked the
formal opening of Memorial Hall as
the public meeting place of the Uni
versity. The 1,750 seating capacity
of the Hall was filled by 11:10 o'clock

Tells History
Speaking of the history of Memo
rial Hall, Dr. Wilbur explained its
pui'pose as a memorial to the 77
Stanford men and wompn who died

"Stanford University is a memorial
university," he said. "It has a Me

war; it now has a Memorial Hall, all
emphasizing the contribution of
Stanford University to the state."
Concerning Stanford's place in the
educational world,. Dr. Wilbur re
marked: "It took competition to get
here. You have to meet competition
while you are here—and after you
leave. There are no easy answers to
social and personal problems here at
the University or outside of it."

Wilbur told 2,000 Stanford students
and faculty members who crowded
Memorial Hall yesterday morning
for its formal opening. "To be suc
cessful it requires participation on
the part of its citizens. No form of
government operates itself—all of us
are put "on the spot'."
Stressing the spiritual qualities
necessary to the individual, Dr. Wil
bur said, "Cynicism means a loss of
faith in self and in human nature.
When it becomes nationwide it is
easy to have the development of
either fascism or communism. Both
of these represent a low ideal and
lack of spirit."
Warns of Bad Habits
Dr. Wilbur warned the assemblage
about the danger of bad habits when
he cautioned, "Look yourself and
your plan of life over if you have
gotten so that you can't operate the
wonderful machine given to you by
God without snarling it up with al
cohol, nicotine, caffeine, aspirin, pep
per and other forms of gravel and
emery to work on the bearings and
choke up the motor. Leave some
thing for the days when the fight
against fat begins."

Tells History
Speaking of the history of Memo
rial Hall, Dr. Wilbur explained its
pui'pose as a memorial to the 77
Stanford men and wompn who died

Court containing a tablet to those
who served in the Spanish-American
war; it now has a Memorial Hall, all
emphasizing the contribution of
Stanford University to the state."
Concerning Stanford's place in the
educational world,. Dr. Wilbur re
marked: "It took competition to get

social and personal problems here at
the University or outside of it."

government," President Ray Lyman
Wilbur told 2,000 Stanford students
and faculty members who crowded
