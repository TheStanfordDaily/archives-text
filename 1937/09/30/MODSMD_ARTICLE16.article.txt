# Black Issue Alienates F. H. Voters: Barclay

.Barclay of the Stanford political'
science department.
Justice Black returned yesterday
from a four-week trip to France and
England, and refused to comment on
a series of newspaper articles pub
lished recently which declared that
the former Alabama Senator and
the first appointment of Roosevelt to
the Supreme Court held a life mem
bership in the Klan.
'Winners Have Lost'
Black's appointment to the court
seems to have been primarily the
result of political jockeying between
the President and the Senate," Bar
clay commented. He added that "as
a contest in tactifcs, it has well been
said that 'all the winners seem to
have lost'."
Barclay feels that the political con
sequences are of primary signifi
cance.
"In the East and North where the
Democratic Party has recently
achieved great success, the Klan is
thoroughly despised," the Stanford
professor pointed out.
Senators 'Bitter'
Democratic Senators from those
states who voted for the confirma
tion of Black "now resent bitterly
the fact that the alleged Klan con
nection of their colleague was not
fully investigated," Barclay believes.
The direct effect of the Black-
Klan controversy upon President
Roosevelt's political fortunes, he
commented, was that the President
"in making an appointment that
was largely political and geograph
ical, may have offended important
elements among his following, as it
is certain that he has been sup
ported by large numbers of Jewish,
Negro, and Catholic voters."
In concluding, Barclay said that
"the record of Mr. Justice Black on
the Supreme Court will, in my
judgment, determine whether the
issue will be an important factor in
the Congx - essional elections in 1938."

The continued silence of Associate Supreme Court Justice Hugo L.
Black on his asserted membership in the Ku Klux Klan. white-hooded
"secret organization" once prominent in American politics, may result in
alienating from President Roosevelt several important racial and religious
groups of voters that once supported him, according to Professor Thomas S.
