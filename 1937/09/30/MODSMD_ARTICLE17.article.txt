# Farm Employee Claims Longest Service Title
## 
### ESTELLE SEID 
John McGlynn, who works in the
University powerhouse, claimed yes
terday that he has been in Stanford
service longer than any other em
ploye, challenging the title of Jim
the plumber.
McGlynn says that he worked on
the Farm when it was rightly named
such. He started in the famous
stables of Senator Stanford 40 years
ago and has been here ever since.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford were a
good couple to work for, he claims.
And, he says, he ate, slept, and
worked well for them.
Short, cheerful of face, McGlynn
looked out on the students coming
in and out of the B.A.C. across from
the powerhouse and said that he
didn't think the students had chang
ed much. They were a little younger,
and some were better and some were

worse, but all in all they were pretty
much the same.
Backing up McGlynn's memories
of the evolution of the Farm was Mr.
Eallen from the plumbing shop in
the corporation yard. Eallen, who is
72, has worked here 27 years. He
points out that many physical im
provements have bettered the action
of the students.
"I was scared to death in Encina
when I first went there. They would
duck boys in the bath tub and make
them sing, and I was sure they'd
drown." According to him modern
plumbing has changed this.
Both agree that the campus is
more beautiful and better planned.
McGlynn, who lives on campus,
.said that he's worked here a mighty
long time and he didn't know where
else he'd work; and he hopes he'll
work here for a long time to come.
