## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 <U.R).—
Supreme Court Justice Hugo L.
Black rested tonight in nearby Alex
andria at the home of his wife's
brother-in-law after refusing, on
his arrival from Europe at Norfolk,
Va., to answer questions regarding
his alleged membership in the Ku
Klux Klan.
Black, however, indicated on
landing that he might make a radio
reply to the charges later.
He made a brief statement on the
windy deck of the steamship City of
Norfolk as she rolled in Hampton
Roads outside Norfolk, a statement
that hinted that at some unspecified
time he would take to the radio and
—"when the public can hear"—re
ply to the charges against him.
