# Registration Hits All-Time High with 4,070
## Third Day Figures Top 1936 Total by 121 As New Record Is Set 
### 
After the third day of registration,
fall entrollment figures reached an
all-time high, with 4.070 students
registered. Topping last year's total
at the end of the same period by
121, the enrollment exceeded expec
tations of administration officials.
Number of men enrolled for the
quarter is 2,884, as opposed to 2,809
registered last fall. Total number of
women registered this fall also ex
ceeds last year's figure, with 1,186
against 1,140. Last year's combined
total was 3,949.
Further late registration should
add considerably to the present total
if last year's record is any basis for
prediction. Final fall registration in
1936, after late registrations closed,
was 4,052, an increase of more than
100 over figures after the third reg
day. A similar increase this year
from late registrations would bring
this fall's total to nearly 4,200.
