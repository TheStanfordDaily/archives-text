# DAILY TRYOUTS START Reporters To Learn Ropes
## 
### 
Because of a change in editorial
plans, tryouts for the editorial staff
of The Daily will start at 5 o'clock
this afternoon in Room 8 of the Press
Building instead of Tuesday, as was
previously announced.
Though the main call is for staff
reporters, students interested in
drawing cartoons and taking photo
graphs for The Daily should also
come out at this time. Because of
the rapid turnover in staff positions,
a large number of reporters is
needed.
To Take Two-Week Course
This afternoon's tryoutee meeting
will be the first in a series of meet
ings which will last for two or three
weeks. During this time, training in
writing news stories, feature stories,
and headlines, and in copyreading,
proofreading, and news coverage
will be given tryoutees by Margaret
Loud, women's editor. Other mem
bers of the editorial board will also
explain various phases of the
Daily's activities to the tryoutees.
At the end of the tryout peiiod a

number of the group will be ad
mitted to the staff of the campus pa
per as reporters, and initiated into
the Daily's "afternoon club" in the
Cellar. As no other tryouts will be
held this quarter, students interest
ed in joining the editorial staff
should attend every tryoutee meet
ing.
Training for staff photographers
will be conducted by John Rice, as
sociate editor. The best-equipped
darkroom on the campus will be
available to the photographers ac
cepted on the staff.
News Writing Important
Staff organization and news writ
ing will be the principal subjects dis
cussed at the meeting today. No pre
vious experience is necessary to try
out for the staff. Reporters' jobs are
open to both old and new students.
Besides offering practical experi
ence in editing and writing for a
newspaper, the Daily offers its staff
members valuable contact with all
campus activities, a chance to get on
the "inside" of student affairs.
