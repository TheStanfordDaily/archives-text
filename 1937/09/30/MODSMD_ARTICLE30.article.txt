# Nitery Patrons Offered Music, Refreshments
## Old Union Lounge Open To Everyone, Says Committee Chairman 
### 
"The Nitery is open to everyone,
and all the time."
Freshmen are taking up Alan Hy
man, chairman of the Nitery Com
mittee, on that remark. They are al
ready frequent visitors to the lounge
next to the A.S.S.U. office in the Old
Union. The committee, which also
includes Jan North, Maury Rosen
feld, Barbara Murphy, and Isabelle
Goldthwaite, emphasized that it is
trying to make the Nitery a real
community center, to be patronized
not only by students, but also by
faculty, between whom they hope it
may help create a more informal
relationship.
Established at the end of last
quarter on the pattern of similar
centers at other universities, the
opening programs of the Nitery
drew an unexpected number of stu
dents in search of entertainment and
relaxation.
The committee will not be able to
repeat its dance and amateur show
of last year, but reports show that
the radio and victrola have served
as adequate substitutes.
Those who do not care to dance
and who confine their exertions to
mental realms may play cards, while
imbibing drinks from the Cellar.
