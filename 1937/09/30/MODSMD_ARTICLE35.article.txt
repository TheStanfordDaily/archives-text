# Landscaping Planned For Theater Area
## Streets To Be Widened To Give Additional Space for Parking 
### 
Next spring Memorial Hall will no
longer look like a citadel rising from
desert sands, for the entire block on
which it is situated is about to be
planted with trees and shrubs.
An underground pipe system is
now being installed which will pro
vide irrigation for the area. Rows of
olive trees planted on the brick
terraces and other large trees in
front of the building will soften the
lines of the bare theater walls, ac
cording to the plans worked out by
Landscape Architect Leslie Kieler
in conjunction with Al Roth.
Extra Parking Space
Memorial Hall block is surround
ed on all four sides with streets 60
feet wide. This will reduce traffic
congestion to a minimum and pro
vide a great deal of additional park
ing space. Work is being completed
on Galvez Street, which was wid
ened for this purpose. Concrete
curbs have been built on three sides
of the block.
According to present plans, Serra
Street, in front of the theater, will
be marked for diagonal parking
shortly, allowing additional room for
those who drive to class. The semi
circle in front of the entrance to
Memorial Hall will be kept clear at
all times.
Terraces Installed
Brick terraces and the ornamental
tile and concrete walls were added
to the theater block during the sum
mer. Walks are being installed at
present so that there will be paved
footways to all entrances to the new
theater.
The other construction jobs on the
Farm are complete, with the excep
tion of the Cubberley Education
Building, where the steel frame is
finished and the concrete floor of
the first level is being poured. Some
work will be done later on the sur
face of the road in front of Encina
which was torn up this summer to
install new plumbing for the frosh
hall.
