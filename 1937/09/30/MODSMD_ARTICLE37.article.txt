# Tryouts for Quad Scheduled Tonight
## 
### 
Quad tryouts will be held tonight
when both the editorial and business
staffs meet at 7 o'clock in the Quad
office. Sevei'al positions still are
open, principally for typing work,
and there are also vacancies on the
photography staff.
Any student, new or old, inter
ested in trying out for the annual
should attend the meeting, accord
ing to George*McKcnna, Quad edi
tor. McKenna's plans for the 1937-
38 annual center around more and
bigger pictures, utilizing the Quad's
newly equipped dark room.

We are taller in the morning than
when we go to bed at night; the
night's rest eases the weight on our
joints.
