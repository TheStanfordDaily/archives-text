# Von Cramm Given Scare by Blethen
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Sept. 29 (U.R).â€”Baron
Gottfried von Cramm, No. 2 singles
player in the world of tennis, had a
close call in the Pacific Coast Tennis
Championships today when Howard
Blethen, formerly of Stanford, car
ried the European star three sets
before losing in a third-round match.
The baron won, 6-2, 7-9, 6-4, after
one of the tightest battles of the
tournament at the Berkeley Tennis
Club.
After breaking even in the first
two sets, Von Cramm was leading
5-1 in the final set when Blethen, a
San Franciscan, started a sensational
rally.
The American took three games
in a row and had a 40-0 advantage in
the tenth game before Von Cramm
regained control. Turning on the
heat, Von Cramm blasted three hard
services at the underdog. Blethen
got his racquet on each of them but
his returns smashed into the net each
time, and Von Cramm took the
match.
