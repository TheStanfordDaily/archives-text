### 
BEKELEY, Sept. 29 (U.R).â€”As a
matter of principle, Roy A. Cain, 51,
entered Berkeley jail today to spend
50 days. Given alternatives of a
$100 fine or a 50-day jail term on
reckless driving charges, Cain said:
"I have the money but I'm going to
jail on principle. I am an innocent
man."

A French stayed under water for
six minutes, 29.8 seconds in 1912.
