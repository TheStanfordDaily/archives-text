# Chaparral Editor Calls for Artists
## 
### 
With the approach of Chaparral's
copy deadline tomorrow, Editor Bob
Hartmann finds that he will be in
need of artists of all sorts, and hopes
that the campus favorite pencil
wielders will come soon to his of
fice and talk to him.
Although there will probably be
plenty of copy this month, writers
are urged to start working for the
next and biggest issue of the year,
which will come out the day before
the Big Game.
The business staff, too, will greet
any tryoutees with open arms.
Subscription campaigns in the va
rious living groups will start before
long, and there is office work to be
done. Students will also be needed
to sell Chappies on the Quad.
In buying subscriptions, the read
er saves himself about 35 cents. The
Chappie will be mailed out on the
same day it is sold on the Quad.
