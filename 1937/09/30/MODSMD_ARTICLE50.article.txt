With the first football week-end
behind us and the second grid dish
being steamed up for serving, let's
hop aboard the pigskin freight and
tour the coast for a fleeting glimpse
of the P.C.C. squads that will battle
it out for the title and a date with
Rosie Bowl.
Several weeks ago nine men, tried
and true, climbed out on the end of
the limb with a prediction on how
the conference outfits would prob
ably wind up the season. The list
of prognosticators included three
Card football coaches, the super-
Xjibq aAy pu√ü 'jaSeueui Ajpijqnd
sports authorities(?). It seems fit
ting and proper at this time to visit
the topnotch grid camps first and
work down to the bottom.
CALIFORNIA
Yes, our good friends from the
Berkeley foothills are the team to
beat this year. However, we're still
not convinced that the Bears are an
other "Wonder Team," even after
the St. Mary's slaughter. The Gaels
are the weakest outfit to come out
of Moraga for several years.
Nineteen lettermen returned this
year, and along with men up from
the Ramblers and the strong '36
frosh, the Bears present a powerful

front that few, if any teams are go
ing to crack this year.
Cal isn't a first-string team,
either. Allison's second and third
outfits carried out their errand of
mercy in the second half of the St.
Mary's game with neat dispatch, to
outplay the Gael topnotchers.
WASHINGTON
The Huskies were given a slight
edge for second place over the Tro
jans of Southern Cal by the proph
ets. Grid critics didn't see how the
northerners could put out another
strong squad this year after the
losses they suffered last June
