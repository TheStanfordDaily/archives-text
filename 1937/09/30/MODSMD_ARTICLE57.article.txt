## What If It Is A Horrid Word 
### 
STANFORD has always paled slightly around
the gills at the mention of the words "school
spirit." Local sophists recommend that such
nomenclature be omitted from the Stanford
vocabulary because it's "juvenile, high-school
ish, and awfully silly," but have neglected to
substitute either words or actions for what was
to them three years ago "big stuff."
True, the words "school spirit" are apt to
create an olfactory annoyance through exces
sive age and overuse; so cast them out if you
want. But don't throw the enthusiasm they rep
resent into the pile.
Anything worth doing is worth getting ex
cited over, even if it does mean a reversion to
the savage by allowing some slight adrenalin
flow.
This afternoon an ambitious football team
leaves Palo Alto for its first conference game of
the season with Oregon in Eugene on Saturday.

The sports men tell us it's a vastly improved
outfit from that of last Saturday. Further, they
say that Oregon against U.C.L.A. last week-end
failed to show much.
Stanford can win its first conference game.
And if Stanford does take this one, it may go a
great deal farther than an unenthusiastic cam
pus anticipates.
Stanford's only organized rooting for Satur
day's game—and it's the one that counts, as
has been shown—will be done at the Paly sta
tion today. This, and the Big Game rally, prob
ably will be more influential than any other one
factor in the insanely muddled process of de
veloping what a coach will call "correct mental
attitude."
Stanfordites who scoff the trite words for such
group enthusiasm can well fall off their horses
today and try doling it out, if without name.
They'll probably find that it's fun.
