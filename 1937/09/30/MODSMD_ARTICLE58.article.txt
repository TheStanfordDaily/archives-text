# Bank Nightmare: A Revelation
## 
### 
YOU can't get anything for nothing!
You can't have your cake and eat it too —or
so they say.
They also say that Palo Alto is always trying
to rob meek Stanford roughs. This last has be
come so much a platitude to Stanford students
that no innovation has a chance —conclusions
are instantaneous and always unfavorable.
Thus when Palo Alto banks recently an
nounced a new system of "per item service
charges," there were loud groans and knowing
smirks —and no one stopped to think that the
"smug little bankers" might have a legitimate
reason.
Strangely enough, when we checked with
the bank they showed an apparently good rea
son. They said they'd go broke if they didn't
make such charges.
When a branch bank, one of three in a town
of only 17,000 population, has a monthly turn
over of more than 71,000 checks, something is
screwy. Something is screwy in Palo Alto—
it is a college town and as such houses 4,000 of
the world's most troublesome depositors. (Ever
try to read a check scrawled by a city-bound
smoothie or a Beltramo-ed rough?)
At the beginning of each quarter students
trot down and deposit tens of thousands of dol
lars' worth of checks drawn on banks all over
the world. Almost before any of these checks
has been cleared, tuition, room rent, board and
books are paid for and the deposits are halved.
Net result: no profits and extra work for the
banks' busy employees.
Not content with this, bank-baiting students
write as many as five checks a day—some be
ing for less than a dollar.
Each of these checks must be handled by a
dozen people —must be canceled, filed, marked
on the bank's ledgers and on the depositor's

statement, and signatures must be compared.
Yet students are complaining because the num
ber of free checks is limited.
Further gripes are roused by the fifty-cent
basic charge on accounts less than one hun
dred dollars. Few realize that forty-seven per
cent of the bank's accounts are consistently be
low one hundred dollars, and that the sum of
these accounts equals less than five per cent of
the bank's total deposits.
We apparently can't get anything for nothing,
and now that Paly's bankers have opened their
books, we're even stymied for a good beef.

nounced a new system of "per item service
charges," there were loud groans and knowing
smirks —and no one stopped to think that the
"smug little bankers" might have a legitimate
reason.
Strangely enough, when we checked with
the bank they showed an apparently good rea
son. They said they'd go broke if they didn't
make such charges.
When a branch bank, one of three in a town
of only 17,000 population, has a monthly turn
over of more than 71,000 checks, something is
screwy. Something is screwy in Palo Alto—
it is a college town and as such houses 4,000 of
the world's most troublesome depositors. (Ever
try to read a check scrawled by a city-bound
smoothie or a Beltramo-ed rough?)
At the beginning of each quarter students
trot down and deposit tens of thousands of dol
lars' worth of checks drawn on banks all over
the world. Almost before any of these checks
has been cleared, tuition, room rent, board and
books are paid for and the deposits are halved.
Net result: no profits and extra work for the
banks' busy employees.
Not content with this, bank-baiting students
write as many as five checks a day—some be
ing for less than a dollar.
Each of these checks must be handled by a
dozen people —must be canceled, filed, marked
on the bank's ledgers and on the depositor's

statement, and signatures must be compared.
Yet students are complaining because the num
ber of free checks is limited.
Further gripes are roused by the fifty-cent
basic charge on accounts less than one hun
dred dollars. Few realize that forty-seven per
cent of the bank's accounts are consistently be
low one hundred dollars, and that the sum of
these accounts equals less than five per cent of
the bank's total deposits.
We apparently can't get anything for nothing,
and now that Paly's bankers have opened their
books, we're even stymied for a good beef.

YOU can't get anything for nothing!
You can't have your cake and eat it too —or
so they say.
They also say that Palo Alto is always trying
to rob meek Stanford roughs. This last has be
come so much a platitude to Stanford students
that no innovation has a chance —conclusions
are instantaneous and always unfavorable.
