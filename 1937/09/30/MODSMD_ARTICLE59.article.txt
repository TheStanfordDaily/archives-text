PHI PHUI PSHAW
1 REPRINTED in our Tuesday issue was a Daily Cali
fornian blast at Phi Beta Kappa that was accompa
nied by a vague aroma of sour grapes and moth balls.
Above it was a classic bit of reserved comment read
ing, "The Daily does not agree."
This dignified little rebuke keeps the Daily's edi
torial nose clean, but it does not give a particularly
extensive explanation of the subject. Nor does it
show due cause why Phi Beta Kappa should not be
termed "pompous, dignified, useless."
Probably the best reply to the Californian's edi
torialist would be to tell him that he has been missing
too much sleep, or that little liver pills might improve
his disposition. Coupled with a second consideration
of the gripe, this advice ought to take care of the
trouble nicely.

Phi Beta Kappa is probably the only college organ
ization that does not think it knows more about
running the university than the administration. It
is one of the few that does not try to give marching
orders to president and janitor.
In America, People Who Do Things are idolized,
and the people who mind their own business are con
sidered important only insofar as things can be done
to them. The grass looks greener in the neighbor's
bailiwick, and every man considers his neighbor
greener than himself. But it is hardly fair to torpedo
the Phi Betes because they don't try to reform the
world in ten easy lessons.

A ND to prod any easy-going organization into ofli
ciousness is as dangerous as explaining to an old
grad how Senator Stanford got the lines around his
eyes. Consider what would happen here if honorary
societies muscled into the executive free-for-all. As
it is, every plan must face half-a-dozen ravening com
mittees, like a Christian martyr thrown into the ring
with a bunch of well motivated lions. Imagine the mu
tilation that would result if any more organizations
attacked it.
Imagine a wild-eyed dean bursting into the print
shop while the announcement of courses was rolling
out, shouting: "Stop the press! Phi Beta Kappa wants
a bigger blurb."

And griping journalists to the contrary, Phi Beta
Kappa does serve a purpose in its own somnolent way.
It gives hard-working students a reward for doing
well the job they undertook. Athletes flaunt block
letters a foot high. Journalists, wo are told, get the
satisfaction (Oh, God!) of seeing their work in print.
Students are certainly entitled to a bit of jewelry to
break the monotony of their abdominal expanse.
Phi Beta Kappa brings light into the dark lives
of grade slaves, and carefully avoids trampling on
anyone's toes. Surely the Daily Californian can find
some other feature of the Berkeley set-up more worthy
of condemnation.
