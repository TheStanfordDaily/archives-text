# INSIDE CHINA

This is the first of a scries by Mel Jacoby, '38,
vvbo spent last year at Lingnan University in China
where he was one of six Stanford exchange schol
ars. During his stay Jacoby visited 12 of the 18
provinces, held many a conference with Chinese
governmental ofliicals, and through his Chinese
room-mate at the Universtiy developed a fine in
sight into the Oriental diplomatic crisis. — The

T IFE as an exchange student in South China was
anything but drab during the past year. Around
us was a turbulent, restless country growing in na
tionalism and unifying itself in the face of Japanese
aggression.
Chinese troops, held back as much as possible by
leader Chiang Kai-Shek, and trained (some under for
eign supervision) were straining to drive against the
Nipponese. They finally reached a breaking point last
July after we left Canton. The 29th Route Army stood
resolute, refusing to accede to a Japanese division com
mander's demands made during maneuvers near
Peiping.
Dictator Chiang had his reasons for trying to post
pone the war; for during our winter vacation, while
travelling through Kwangsi and Hunan provinces, we
glimpsed what the central government is attempting in
uniting the people.
Propaganda is disseminated through schools to hun
dreds and thousands of students, to an army of nearly
two million, and more important—imparted to the
masses by the widespread use of pictographs. Common
pictures are those showing a tiger facing a Chinese
soldier.
The brilliant leader saw that he must clean Hs
house, so from his policy grew the slogan we often
heard, "Watchful preparedness." Time and again dur
ing the year the Chinese suffered their "loss of face"
in upholding their motto.
Backed by the wealthy Soong family, called a
coward for not fighting, and criticized for crushing
liberal thought and minority representation, Dictator
Chiang Kai-Shek accomplished what no other man
has done. He brought Chink together after subduing
the dissenting southern provinces.
Wherever we traveled in Cihna we heard school
children and soldiers air their feelings by singing
"Down with Japanese imperialism." Still there remains
some opposition to the new leader whose astonishing
success has been watched by all foreign powers. Much
of this comes through the Chinese, bought with Japa
nese money.

December the Generalissimo stepped over one
more hurdle when he escaped from the rebellious
military faction which held him prisoner in Sianfu
for twelve days. Full accounts of this episode in mod
ern Chinese politics will probably never be published.
However, it is quite certain that the Communist Army
played an important part.
The Generalissimo's capture seemed at the time to
affect the entire country. Students predicted that his
freedom meant a turning point in Chinese politics and
history. News of his release was greeted by enthusiastic
street demonstrations which lasted far into the night.
Confidence in the Chinese fighting units was built
during the Shanghai war in 1932, fought between the
Japanese and in independent Cantonese army whose
stubborn resistance for 32 days against modem units
showed the Chinese what they could do by working
together.
