# 'Lost Horizon' Now Playing At Mayfield

### 
"LOST HORIZON," at the May
field Theater.
A philosophical picture seldom
goes over with the public, but a
philosophical picture with action
and scenic beauty has general ap
peal. The Frank Capra production of
James Hilton's "Lost Horizon" brings
to the screen a picture which basic
ally presents an ideal about the way
to live, and photographically gives
the observer one of the most hand
somely mounted films of the year.
The presumably accidental kid
naping of a varied group of persons
and their rescue by monks, from a
monastery high in the mountains of
Tibet, supplies the background for
the action. The swift reaction
against circumstance and the subse
quent peaceful acceptance of the
pleasant surroundings and moderate
life are brought to a climax when
one of the group tries to regain the
outer woi'ld.
Those who have read Hilton's
book will find that this picture re
alizes all the potentialities of the
novel and will come away feeling
that they have not been deprived of
anything by the film version.
Ronald Colman as Conway is most
adequate, and preserves the charac
ter portrayed in the book. He is the
same strong leader, seeking a mean
ing for life and finding that meaning
in the monastery, Shangri-La.
Sam Jaffe in the role of the High
Lama invests the entire plot with a
reason and continuity in two short
scenes. The supporting cast, includ
ing newcomer Jane Wyatt in the
feminine lead, helps to make "Lost
Horizon" complete in action, story,
and photography. —Seid
