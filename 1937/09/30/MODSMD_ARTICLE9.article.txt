# Chaplain To Start Discussion Group
## 
### 
A new feature of Stanford life will
be student discussion groups to be
held at the home of the university
chaplain, Dr. D. Elton Trueblood,
every Sunday evening at 8 o'clock.
The group, which takes the place
of last year's Sunday morning class,
is open to all students. Discussions
will deal with topics of the day of
the students' own choice.
Dr. Trueblood, who has conducted
similar meetings at Johns Hopkins
University and Haverford College,
stated, "My hope is that such a
group will aid students to clarify
their own minds on some of the
fundamental questions which all
thinking people must eventually
face."
