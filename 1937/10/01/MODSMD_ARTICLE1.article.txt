# League Sends Warning To Italian Chief
## Italians Must Evacuate Spain, or Arms May Be Sent to Loyalists 
### 
GENEVA, Sept 3G (U.R). ~ The
League of Nations peace
tonight demanded "immediate and
complete withdrawal" of all Italian
and other foreign troops from Spain
under threat of permitting unre
stricted arms shipments to the Loy
alist armies.
If Premier Benito Mussolini re
fuses to withdraw the 150,000 or
200,000 Italians alleged to be serving
in the insurgent ranks, the League is
prepared to recommend scuttling of
the non-intervention accord. Such
an action would release 27 Euro
pean nations from their pledges not
to send arms and munitions to either
Spanish faction.
Britain and France have prepared
a note to be tendered to Mussolini
tomorrow inviting him to join them
in tri-power talks on the volunteer
question. A temporary truce on all
Spanish battle fronts while the for
eign troops are withdrawn probably
will be proposed at the tri-power
meeting, providing II Duce agrees to
attend.
The note to Mussolini, although
couched in friendly tones, will be
accompanied by a verbal warning
that unless the Italian troops are
speedily withdrawn, the Franco-
Spanish frontier will be thrown open
to permit a flow of material aid to
the Loyalists. Mussolini also will
be told, according to London advices,
that unless he submits to the "hands
ofT Spain" demand, he may as well
abandon hope of obtaining Anglo-
French recognition of his Ethiopian
conquest.
