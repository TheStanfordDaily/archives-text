# Big Send-off Cheers Team On to Oregon
## Week's Heavy Practice Gives Gridders Hope Of Smashing Victory 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Several hundred Stanford men and
women made a lot of noise yester
day as a farewell gesture to the
Oregon-bound Indian gridmen, just
before they climbed aboard the 3
o'clock train, headed for the north.
Milling around the Southern Pa
cific station, the Farm's football
minded students gave Yell Leader
Jim Ransohoff and his assistants,
Lomax Turner and Bill Todd, all the
support they needed. The Stanford
band, out in full force, contributed
its share, with everything fi*om
"Come Join the Band" to "The Car
dinal Is Waving."

Gi'ant Stone, acting captain for last
Saturday's Santa Clara game, sized
up the situation when he said, "Last
week we climbed on the big red
toboggan, but we forgot it was at
the bottom of the hill with no one
pulling it. Give us some support, and
this week we'll bring home the bacon
or the tailfeathers or whatever it is
you get off those Ducks."
Pete Zagar x-evealed just as much
determination. He said, "It should
be a good game. Listen in on the
radio and you'll hear about 25 touch
downs."
Chances Are Good
Even the coaching staff is confident
of this game since Assistant Coach
Bobby Grayson told the crowd, "We
made all the mistakes we could make
last week, so the boys got them all
out of their systems. We're not
going to Oregon for the train ride.
All we hope is that the good God
will be with us just a little Saturday
afternoon."
Bill Paulman said, "Thanks for
coming out to see us off. We'll do
our best to win Saturday." Jack
Walton backed him up with "What
ever we can do will be done." Jim
Groves declared, "The boys are in
the right frame of mind now. When
we come back, Oregon will be on the
short end of the score."
Cheer Thornhill, Clark
There was a yell for Coach Tiny
Thornhill and one for Jack Clark,
first string end injured before the
season started. The popular "sky
rocket" ended the rally just before
the train pulled out.
The Stanford team arrives in Eu
gene this morning for their game
with the University of Oregon eleven
tomorrow afternoon and will return
here late Sunday.

Cheer Thornhill, Clark
There was a yell for Coach Tiny
Thornhill and one for Jack Clark,
first string end injured before the
season started. The popular "sky
rocket" ended the rally just before
the train pulled out.
The Stanford team arrives in Eu
gene this morning for their game
with the University of Oregon eleven
tomorrow afternoon and will return
here late Sunday.
Several hundred Stanford men and
women made a lot of noise yester
day as a farewell gesture to the
Oregon-bound Indian gridmen, just
before they climbed aboard the 3
o'clock train, headed for the north.
Milling around the Southern Pa
cific station, the Farm's football
minded students gave Yell Leader
Jim Ransohoff and his assistants,
Lomax Turner and Bill Todd, all the
support they needed. The Stanford
band, out in full force, contributed
its share, with everything fi*om
"Come Join the Band" to "The Car
dinal Is Waving."

Gi'ant Stone, acting captain for last
Saturday's Santa Clara game, sized
up the situation when he said, "Last
week we climbed on the big red
toboggan, but we forgot it was at
the bottom of the hill with no one
pulling it. Give us some support, and
this week we'll bring home the bacon
or the tailfeathers or whatever it is
you get off those Ducks."
Pete Zagar x-evealed just as much
determination. He said, "It should
be a good game. Listen in on the
radio and you'll hear about 25 touch
downs."
Chances Are Good
Even the coaching staff is confident
of this game since Assistant Coach
Bobby Grayson told the crowd, "We
made all the mistakes we could make
last week, so the boys got them all
out of their systems. We're not
going to Oregon for the train ride.
All we hope is that the good God
will be with us just a little Saturday
afternoon."
Bill Paulman said, "Thanks for
coming out to see us off. We'll do
our best to win Saturday." Jack
Walton backed him up with "What
ever we can do will be done." Jim
Groves declared, "The boys are in
the right frame of mind now. When
we come back, Oregon will be on the
short end of the score."
