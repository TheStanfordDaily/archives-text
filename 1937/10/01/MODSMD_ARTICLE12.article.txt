# RIVALRY ALIVE
## 
### 
The noted Stanford-Cal ri
valry still Ls very much alive.
Farm students made that clear
at yesterday's train rally when
they refused to respond to Yell
Leader Jim RansohofY's request
for the famous Axe Yell. They
objected on two grounds: the
Yell is a traditional part of the
Big Game, and Stanford hasn't
the Axe this year.
