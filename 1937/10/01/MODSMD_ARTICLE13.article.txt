# Encina To Serve Self Saturdays
## 
### 
Lunch at Encina Commons to
morrow will be served cafeteria
style, since only 7 out of the 27
hashers are not on the frosh football
squad.
The frosh game with Modesto jun
ior college starts at 12, so none of
the players are able to hash Satur
day noons. 1
Last Saturday—the first day that
the cafeteria service was necessary—
the seven remaining hashers served
3"1 diners in 12 minutes, keeping
the "assembly line" moving contin
uously.
This is the first year that such an
arrangement has been necessary,
since no meals have been served on
Saturdays previously.
One consolation, says Mrs. Doro
thy Bell, director of Encina dining
halls, is that some of the non-hash
ing frosh attend the games. Number
to be fed therefore usually drops
from a regular 560 at other lunches
to approximately 340 on Saturday
noons.
Self-service meals are scheduled
to continue through November 6.
