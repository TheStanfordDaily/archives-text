# China's Women Take Up Arms
## 
### 

TWO MEMBERS OF China's "Women of Valor" battalion are shown
as they light side by side with General Chiang Kai-Shek's crack troops
on the Nanking front. The women —none of them more than 18 years
old—are reported to be expert riflemen and well-trained troops who
have volunteered to serve their country in its hour of need.
