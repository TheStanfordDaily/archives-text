# Black To Answer Ku Klux Charges
## Proposed Conference with President Denied by Secretary 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (UP).—Justice Hugo L. Black is ready to pre
sent to the country by radio his answer to chargcs that he was and is a
member of the Ku Klux Klan. Such unprecedented action will be made
tomorrow at 6:30 p.m. Justice Black yesterday told the 60 newspapermen
when he had any statement he'd "make it in a way that cannot be inis-

♦quoted and so the public can hear
lit." He added, "Some parts of the
press might fail to publish what I
said," when asked if he meant he
would reply by radio.
President Roosevelt's only state
| ment on the charge was that any
comment would be deferred until
Justice Black's return from Europe.
Marvin H. Mclntyre, secretary of
the President, at Seattle today, de
nied reports that Justice Black had
conferred with Mr. Roosevelt by
telephone.
On the docket for immediate con
sideration of the court is a petition
filed by Albert Levitt, former spe
cial assistant attorney general, ask
ing the court to direct Justice Black
to show cause why he is not in
eligible.
Reliable quarters were certain Jus
tice Black would enter the Supreme
Court chamber with the other jus
tices Monday and take his seat at
the far end of the bench.
Secretary of Interior Harold L.
Ickes meantime charged that former
President Hoover is "the greatest
expei't on the subject of the Ku Klux
Klan."
He also accused New Deal enemies
of attempting to "drag a red her
ring" across the appointment of
Justice Black to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Ickes queried: "Why don't you
interview former President Hoover?
He knows more about it than I do."
He said the Klan supported Mr.
Hoover and "nobody seemed to
worry about it, either."
