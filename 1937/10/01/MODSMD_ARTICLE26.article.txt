# Drama Leaders Propose Merger of Four Societies Into "Stanford Players"
## Approval of Plan Would Revolutionize Farm Theatrical Set-up 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Stanford's dramatic set-up will undergo the most complete and far
reaching reorganization in its history if a proposal that Ram's Head,
Sword and Sandals, Masquers, and Barnstormers amalgamate into one
society. The Stanford Players, passes a joint meeting of the organizations
at 4 o'clock today in the Little Theater.
The new organization, if approved, will produce the Big Game Gaieties,
the Spring Musical Show, and in addition a dramatic production every

►winter quarter. It is planned that
this winter play will go on tour dur
ing the spring of each year, visiting
other universities and the play
houses of a number of California
towns.-
This scheme would not only pro
vide valuable publicity for the Uni
versity, but would give the Stanford
Players professional experience.
Ending the careers of the four
campus dramatic societies is deemed
necessary by the presidents of each.
They have agreed that the separate
groups are extremely unwieldy, the
majority of them have overlapping
memberships, and it is difficult to
co-ordinate the efforts of separate
units in one production.
This is the logical time for the in
evitable shakeup, according to Bud
Cady, president of Barnstormers;
Hal Kahn, president of Ram's Head;
Jane Clary, president of Masquers;
and Prestridge Ellington, president
of Sword and Sandals. The opening
of Memorial Hall and the start of
the Department of Speech and
Drama mark a new era in Farm dra
matic history; a new organization is
necessary to match the new physical
structure.
Stanford Players would combine
all the directorial, dramatic, and
technical talent on the campus into
one drama society which will strive
to gain a national reputation for
producing plays sponsored, pro
moted, directed, and managed by
students.
Objection liaised
The only objection to the new plan,
which may be raised at today's
meeting, is that four traditional
Stanford organizations would be
completely dissolved. Whether the
members are willing to sacrifice in
dividual interests to a more closely
knit and workable set-up will be
decided at the conference.
According to the resolution drafted
by the society presidents last night,
the Dramatic Manager, Clay Mc-
Daniel, will be made a member of
the Stanford Players and will handle
all business and publicity connected
with their productions.
Board to Be Formed
The first official act of the new
group, if the resolution is adopted,
will be to form an executive board
composed of the presidents of each
of the present societies and the Dra
matic Manager. The function of this
committee will be to draft a consti
tution to be accepted, rejected, or
modified by the Players.
Drafters of the resolution also
propose that the Stanford Players
should form a body within its ranks,
which, which the addition of faculty
advisers and the Student Manager,
would supplant Dramatic Council.
Presidents of Ram's Head, Sword
and Sandals, Masquers, and Barn
stormers, representatives of the
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral, the Stu
dent Manager, and a faculty adviser
comprise the present Council.
Student-Run
The proposed organization will be
entirely student run; its three annual
productions, the play on tour, and
readings, original play contests, and
any other activities which it may
sponsor will be entirely separate
from the work of the Department of
Speech and Drama.

knit and workable set-up will be
decided at the conference.
According to the resolution drafted
by the society presidents last night,
the Dramatic Manager, Clay Mc-
Daniel, will be made a member of
the Stanford Players and will handle
all business and publicity connected
with their productions.
Board to Be Formed
The first official act of the new
group, if the resolution is adopted,
will be to form an executive board
composed of the presidents of each
of the present societies and the Dra
matic Manager. The function of this
committee will be to draft a consti
tution to be accepted, rejected, or
modified by the Players.
Drafters of the resolution also
propose that the Stanford Players
should form a body within its ranks,
which, which the addition of faculty
advisers and the Student Manager,
would supplant Dramatic Council.
Presidents of Ram's Head, Sword
and Sandals, Masquers, and Barn
stormers, representatives of the
Daily, Quad, and Chaparral, the Stu
dent Manager, and a faculty adviser
comprise the present Council.
Student-Run
The proposed organization will be
entirely student run; its three annual
productions, the play on tour, and
readings, original play contests, and
any other activities which it may
sponsor will be entirely separate
from the work of the Department of
Speech and Drama.
Stanford's dramatic set-up will undergo the most complete and far
reaching reorganization in its history if a proposal that Ram's Head,
Sword and Sandals, Masquers, and Barnstormers amalgamate into one
society. The Stanford Players, passes a joint meeting of the organizations
at 4 o'clock today in the Little Theater.
The new organization, if approved, will produce the Big Game Gaieties,
the Spring Musical Show, and in addition a dramatic production every

►winter quarter. It is planned that
this winter play will go on tour dur
ing the spring of each year, visiting
other universities and the play
houses of a number of California
towns.-
This scheme would not only pro
vide valuable publicity for the Uni
versity, but would give the Stanford
Players professional experience.
Ending the careers of the four
campus dramatic societies is deemed
necessary by the presidents of each.
They have agreed that the separate
groups are extremely unwieldy, the
majority of them have overlapping
memberships, and it is difficult to
co-ordinate the efforts of separate
units in one production.
This is the logical time for the in
evitable shakeup, according to Bud
Cady, president of Barnstormers;
Hal Kahn, president of Ram's Head;
Jane Clary, president of Masquers;
and Prestridge Ellington, president
of Sword and Sandals. The opening
of Memorial Hall and the start of
the Department of Speech and
Drama mark a new era in Farm dra
matic history; a new organization is
necessary to match the new physical
structure.
Stanford Players would combine
all the directorial, dramatic, and
technical talent on the campus into
one drama society which will strive
to gain a national reputation for
producing plays sponsored, pro
moted, directed, and managed by
students.
Objection liaised
The only objection to the new plan,
which may be raised at today's
meeting, is that four traditional
Stanford organizations would be
completely dissolved. Whether the
members are willing to sacrifice in
dividual interests to a more closely
knit and workable set-up will be
decided at the conference.
