# S.F. Maritime Truce Renewed
## Year of Peace Awaits Shipping Employers 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 (U.R).â€”
The Pacific Coast maritime industry
was assured another year of peace
in its capital-labor relations today
through renewal of working agree
ments between various employer
groups and the eight maritime and
dock unions.
A year ago today the operators-find
the unions were deadlocked on the
terms of new agreements. Their
negotiations broke down, and a long
strike followed, the second in two
years on the Western waterfronts.
A truce broke the tie-up in Febru
ary of this year and the new con
tracts which were negotiated paved
the way for a period of exceptional
peace in contractual relations be
tween the ship-owners and their
35,000 employees. The "quickie"
strikes of the 1935-36 period were
abolished, and disagreements were
settled by arbitration and discussion.
Unions operated the hiring halls and
working conditions aboard the ships
were improved.
It was these agreements which au
tomatically i"enewed themselves to
day to September 30, 1938. Modifi
cations were made in several con
tracts but none was of major nature.
