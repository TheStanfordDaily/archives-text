# Coast Guard Plane Periled in Rescue
## 
### 
SAN DIEGO. Sept. 30 (UP).â€”A
"mercy flight" 200 miles over the
ocean to rescue a stricken seaman
aboard the freighter Golden Cross
brought a Coast Guard plane close
to disaster today.
Lieut. A. J. Hesford piloted the
seaplane to the side of the freighter
in response ot a wireless plea. Heavy
seas made a landing dangerous, the
takeoff more so. The freighter
pumped hundreds of gallons of oil
onto the sea to provide a smooth
runway for the plane. Once in the
air, Lieut Hesford radioed he was
heading for San Pedro with Nicolas
Geromie, the sick man, aboard.
