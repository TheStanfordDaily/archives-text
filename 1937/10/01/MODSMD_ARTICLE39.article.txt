# Inter-club Council Starts Activities

The Inter-club Council began its
year officially Wednesday night with
a meeting at which Harry Craigin,
chairman, presided.
The Council is composed of two
delegates from each of the Hall
groups. They are: Los Arcos, Bran
ner Independents, El Campo, Break
ers, El Capitan, Toyon Independents,
El Cuadro, El Toro, Sequoia Eating

The Council was organized last
year with the object of bringing the
residents of the Halls together in a
closer understanding and co-opera

which were of mutual interest to
the various groups.
