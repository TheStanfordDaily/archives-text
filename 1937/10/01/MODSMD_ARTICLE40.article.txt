# Recorded Recitals To Start Monday
## 
### 
Record recitals will start next
Monday at 4:15 o'clock under the
auspices of the University's Music
Division, in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall. This first program
will be devoted to the works of
the famed contemporary composer
Jan Sibelius. New sound equipment
is to be used under acoustically ideal
conditions.
The program will open with the
Sixth Symphony in D Minor and
will also feature the finale from the
Violin Concerto in D Minor, played
by Jascha Heifetz, with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra. Record re
citals will be held on Mondays this
season instead of Wednesdays, as in
past years.
