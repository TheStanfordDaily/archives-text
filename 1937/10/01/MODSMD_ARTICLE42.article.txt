# Dramatic Production Reflects Author's Life
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
"Murder in the Cathedral," the
fall dramatic production which will
be on a double bill with "Trial by
Jury" in Memorial Hall, October 29
and 30, presents action closely anal
ogous with the life of T. S. Eliot, its
author.
The martyrdom of Thomas Beck-
Beckett, which is described in the
ett, which is described in the
search for serenity of mind, accord
ing to Gordon C. Lange, director.
During the performance four tempt
ers appear to Thomas; they are sup
posed to represent the temptations
that have come to the writer during

the course of his career, and usually
come to any successful man who has
the power to do good.
Mr. Elliot's resistance to these
temptations is illustrated by the es
says, poetry, and dramas he has
written. His early work is sardonic,
bitter, unbelieving poetry, but his
writings in late years exhibit a well
worked out philosophy and great
faith in the Church.
An unusual feature of "Murder in
the Cathedral" is that the four mur
derers of Thomas Beckett appear
after the deed is done and explain
to the audience what their motives
were.
Like every great visionary, Thom
as was misunderstood by the people
of his age, according to Director
Lange. But, he had such a com
plete belief in himself as an instru
ment for greater good that he sacri
ficed himself willingly for his cause.
Recalls Socrates
So significant are the underlying
motives of "Murder in the Cathed
ral" that they have been compared to
the events leading to the Crucifixion
and to Socrates' drinking of the fatal
hemlock. Mr. Waldemar Johansen is
designing an appropriate medieval
cathedral setting for the production.
"Trial by Jury," the other feature
of the first dramatic program which
regular session students will see in
the new theater, is a musical farce
by the famous team of Gilbert and
Sullivan. It was the first work of
the combination that produced great
est comic operas in the English
language.
They lampoon the dignity of Brit
ish courts and give evidence that
Ihey suspect that corruption under
lies this sedate exterior. The mock
trial concerns a breach of promise
suit; sparkling lyrics and lively
tunes in the Gilbert and Sullivan
tradition have been added to this
humorous background.
Music Significant
The presentation . of "Trial by
Jury" will show the significance of
music in connection with the new
activities in Memorial Hall. Profes
sor Warren D. Allen of the music
department selected the 45-minute
vehicle as appropriate for the first
effort in this direction.
Members of the cast are in the
choir and the Men's and Women's
Glee Clubs. Anyone interested in
trying out for a part should see Pro
fessor Allen in the choir room.

hemlock. Mr. Waldemar Johansen is
designing an appropriate medieval
cathedral setting for the production.
"Trial by Jury," the other feature
of the first dramatic program which
regular session students will see in
the new theater, is a musical farce
by the famous team of Gilbert and
Sullivan. It was the first work of
the combination that produced great
est comic operas in the English
language.
They lampoon the dignity of Brit
ish courts and give evidence that
Ihey suspect that corruption under
lies this sedate exterior. The mock
trial concerns a breach of promise
suit; sparkling lyrics and lively
tunes in the Gilbert and Sullivan
tradition have been added to this
humorous background.
Music Significant
The presentation . of "Trial by
Jury" will show the significance of
music in connection with the new
activities in Memorial Hall. Profes
sor Warren D. Allen of the music
department selected the 45-minute
vehicle as appropriate for the first
effort in this direction.
Members of the cast are in the
choir and the Men's and Women's
Glee Clubs. Anyone interested in
trying out for a part should see Pro
fessor Allen in the choir room.
"Murder in the Cathedral," the
fall dramatic production which will
be on a double bill with "Trial by
Jury" in Memorial Hall, October 29
and 30, presents action closely anal
ogous with the life of T. S. Eliot, its
author.
The martyrdom of Thomas Beck-
Beckett, which is described in the
ett, which is described in the
search for serenity of mind, accord
ing to Gordon C. Lange, director.
During the performance four tempt
ers appear to Thomas; they are sup
posed to represent the temptations
that have come to the writer during

the course of his career, and usually
come to any successful man who has
the power to do good.
Mr. Elliot's resistance to these
temptations is illustrated by the es
says, poetry, and dramas he has
written. His early work is sardonic,
bitter, unbelieving poetry, but his
writings in late years exhibit a well
worked out philosophy and great
faith in the Church.
An unusual feature of "Murder in
the Cathedral" is that the four mur
derers of Thomas Beckett appear
after the deed is done and explain
to the audience what their motives
were.
Like every great visionary, Thom
as was misunderstood by the people
of his age, according to Director
Lange. But, he had such a com
plete belief in himself as an instru
ment for greater good that he sacri
ficed himself willingly for his cause.
Recalls Socrates
So significant are the underlying
motives of "Murder in the Cathed
ral" that they have been compared to
the events leading to the Crucifixion
and to Socrates' drinking of the fatal
hemlock. Mr. Waldemar Johansen is
