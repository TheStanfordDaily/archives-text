# Steamer on Rocks Near Vancouver

VANCOUVER, 8.C., Sept. 30 (UP).
â€”Rough sea swells tonight pounded
the Norwegian freighter M.S. Soloy,
caught on rocks off Thormanby
Island, while three tugs stood by.
The 3,600-net ton vessel went
aground early this morning during a
gale. Twenty-seven crew members,
commanded by Captain K. Jensen,
were aboard.
Captain Jensen radioed the Soloy
wsa in no immediate danger, al
though leaking badly. The No. 2 hold
was punctured, but pumps were
keeping the incoming water low.
In 1870, flax was grown on 24,000
acres in England. Today, probably
the only flax grown in that country
is on the king's Sandringham estate.
