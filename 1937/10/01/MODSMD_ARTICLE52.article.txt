# "Gordy" Slaps Parking Tags On Staff Cars
## 
### 
At least twice a year ever since
cars were allowed on the campus,
patient painters paint pretty red or
yellow (or both) lines in front of the
Daily shack, indicating that parking
there is in distinctly bad taste.
And for that same length of time,
Daily staff members, from editor to
j reporters, have merrily guided their
j mounts into the forbidden territory
and parked. And nothing has hap
pened but a reappearance of the
patient painters.
That is, nothing until yesterday.
Before the shocked eyes of Daily
I moguls, gathering in edit meeting in
the editor's ofhce, Master Gordon
| Davis, strong right arm of the Law,
I proceeded to sldp a ticket on every
! illegally parked car, beginning with
i Editor Gordy Frost's and methodi
j cally working the entire lot. With
j the sounding of the alarm, the en
tire crew vithin the shack poured
out, expostulated in vain, left their
cars where they were.
