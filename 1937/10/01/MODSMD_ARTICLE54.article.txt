# S.C.-Husky Battle Takes Top Place In Grid Contests
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Coast football, easing into its sec
ond week of action, centers its big
gest headlines in Los Angeles' Coli
seum, where the second spot in con
ference standing will in all proba
bility be decided when Washing
ton's Huskies will try to bite their
way once again to heaven and the
Hose Bowl against the up-'n'-com
ing Trojans of Southern Cal.
It looks as though an aerial battle
is on deck, since both elevens won
their last week's games with accu
. ate passing. However, Troy is once
more potent on the ground, mainly
because of Amby Schindler, and fans
fTuiy have a chance to see the Trojan
Horse of old plow down to score by
power alone.
Huskies Have Edge
The coast champions boast the
same backfield —a sophomore quar
tette—that led them to Miss Rosie
Bowl last year, and this plus an in
experienced but strong line seems to
give the Huskies a little edge over
the boys from U.S.C. Look for a
one-touchdown win.
It seems that hardly a year goes by
without news of a new Oregonian
grid threat permeating the southern
section, but it's been many a year
since anything has come of such
predictions. This time it concerns
Oregon State, and rightly perhaps,
since a gentleman yclept Joe "Ghost"
Gray packs a very tidy pigskin for
that school.
One-Man Ball Game
Mr. Gray is very good—the best
half on the coast last year—but he
hasn't a good enough line to back
him up. So when O.S.C. bumps into
that O-so-awful-big Bear team this
Saturday, there seems to be nothing
to do but to start writing a courteous
obituary for the northern lads. One
man isn't enough to win a ball game.
Just out of a sickbed, and still
very, very weak, come the Gaels,
who gallop no more, on accounta
becuz they took a horrible mauling
last week from the claws of the
above-mentioned Bear. Mr. Slip
Madigan, who was once known as
the Mad Magician of Moraga, is also
Very sick.
Gaels May Be Sicker
And there is an even chance that
these gentlemen will be sicker still
after this weekend, because some
plenty tough Bulldogs from Gon
zaga are heading this way to do their

darnedest to pull a big upset. Last
week the Gonzagans .slipped over a
tie on W.S.C., and you never can
tell what will happen. However, the
Gaels seem -to have enough vitality
left to win this one. They hope.
W.S.C. is going to have a hard time
winning their next. They meet a
fighting bunch from Idaho, who
'without a doubt are all set to
knock every team they meet lor a big
loop. All because they pulled a ter
rific win last week in the final three
minutes against Oregon State. Watch
'em go.
Eastern Tussle
An eastern game of interest to
coast grid fans is the tussle between
Ohio State and Purdue, because next
week the Buckeyes head west for an
intersectional battle with U.S.C.
It oughta be a good weekend,
doncha think?

tie on W.S.C., and you never can
tell what will happen. However, the
Gaels seem -to have enough vitality
left to win this one. They hope.
W.S.C. is going to have a hard time
winning their next. They meet a
fighting bunch from Idaho, who
'without a doubt are all set to
knock every team they meet lor a big
loop. All because they pulled a ter
rific win last week in the final three
minutes against Oregon State. Watch
'em go.
Eastern Tussle
An eastern game of interest to
coast grid fans is the tussle between
Ohio State and Purdue, because next
week the Buckeyes head west for an
intersectional battle with U.S.C.
It oughta be a good weekend,
doncha think?
Coast football, easing into its sec
ond week of action, centers its big
gest headlines in Los Angeles' Coli
seum, where the second spot in con
ference standing will in all proba
bility be decided when Washing
ton's Huskies will try to bite their
way once again to heaven and the
Hose Bowl against the up-'n'-com
ing Trojans of Southern Cal.
It looks as though an aerial battle
is on deck, since both elevens won
their last week's games with accu
. ate passing. However, Troy is once
more potent on the ground, mainly
because of Amby Schindler, and fans
fTuiy have a chance to see the Trojan
Horse of old plow down to score by
power alone.
Huskies Have Edge
The coast champions boast the
same backfield —a sophomore quar
tette—that led them to Miss Rosie
Bowl last year, and this plus an in
experienced but strong line seems to
give the Huskies a little edge over
the boys from U.S.C. Look for a
one-touchdown win.
It seems that hardly a year goes by
without news of a new Oregonian
grid threat permeating the southern
section, but it's been many a year
since anything has come of such
predictions. This time it concerns
Oregon State, and rightly perhaps,
since a gentleman yclept Joe "Ghost"
Gray packs a very tidy pigskin for
that school.
One-Man Ball Game
Mr. Gray is very good—the best
half on the coast last year—but he
hasn't a good enough line to back
him up. So when O.S.C. bumps into
that O-so-awful-big Bear team this
Saturday, there seems to be nothing
to do but to start writing a courteous
obituary for the northern lads. One
man isn't enough to win a ball game.
Just out of a sickbed, and still
very, very weak, come the Gaels,
who gallop no more, on accounta
becuz they took a horrible mauling
last week from the claws of the
above-mentioned Bear. Mr. Slip
Madigan, who was once known as
the Mad Magician of Moraga, is also
Very sick.
Gaels May Be Sicker
And there is an even chance that
these gentlemen will be sicker still
after this weekend, because some
plenty tough Bulldogs from Gon
zaga are heading this way to do their

darnedest to pull a big upset. Last
week the Gonzagans .slipped over a
tie on W.S.C., and you never can
tell what will happen. However, the
