### 
With a .572 batting average for the
first week-end, the peerless pigskin
pickers of the Dippy staff climb out
into their reserved box on the end
of the limb tor a few more predic
tions.
Sports Writers Walt Peterson,
Phil Klauber, Harry Press, and
Sports Editor Gene Gear after a hur
ried huddle came out of their trance
with the following startling infor
mation:
Stanford, 14; Oregon, 7.
California, 27; Oregon State, G.
Washington, 14; U.S.C., 13.
Washington State, 13; Idaho, 6.
St. Marys, 13; Gonzaga, fi.
U.S.F., 19; Daniel Baker, 0.
The Dippy prognosticates claim
they were only warming up last
week, and that today's selections are
absolutely fool-proof. They hasten
to explain to the public that they're
not betting men so they can't back
up their sure-fire scoring dope.
