## 
### 
DENVER, Colo., Sept. 30 (U.R).—|
High councils of the American Fed- j
eration of Labor were authorita- i
tively reported tonight to have
agreed to duck the issue of expelling
the C.I.Q. when the Federation con
venes here next week.
Instead, reliable sources said, the
question will be put in the hands of :
A. F. of L. executive council by j
empowering it to oust the rebel
faction at its own discretion.
The compromise agreement was J
purportedly reached at a series of j
backroom and hotel lobby confer- j
ences aftev Charles P. Howard, C.1.0. |
secretary and president of the In
ternational Typographical Union, 1
brought a three-point peace program
to the Federation pre - convention
meetings.
It was generally believed the un- ,
derstanding would solve effectively I
the C.1.0. question because of the j
large bloc of votes controlled by the i
compromise group. However, ob-,
servers pointed to the possibility of i
a rank-and-file revolt on the con- j
vention floor similar to that which j
broke out in the metal trades de- i
partment convention and swamped'
a resolution opposing ouster pro-1
ceedings.
The stand taken by union leaders
would allow the issue to be side
stepped without injuring the feel
ings of either the rabid enemies of
John L. Lewis, who control the
council, or of the peacemakers, who -
wish to avoid severing the final
cord between the rival organiza-:
tions.
