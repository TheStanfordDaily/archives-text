# IDAHO SHIFTS CENTER
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Idaho, Sept. 30 (UP).
—Dick Trzuskowski, 215 pounds,
today was named starting center for
the University of Idaho eleven when
it meets Washington State College.
Trzuskowski ordinarily fills the
guard post, but will change his po
sition because of a dearth of regular
centers —all of whom are out with
injuries.
