# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### 
My dear readers (all tlu'ee of you),
you're probably still wondering what
Slants was all about yesterday.
We were aboard a sports ti*ain
making a tour of the conference
grid camps when suddenly the train
halted at Washington—and right in
the middle of a sentence, too.
It seems that despite all the
screaming by the night editor, Slants
just couldn't put up an argumnt
against the overabundance of ads on
the sports page.
So here goes today—we'll start with
Washington again, having covered
the favored California Bears yester
day.
WASHINGTON
The Huskies were given a slight
edge for second place over the Tro
jans of Southern Cal by the proph
ets. Grid critics didn't see how the
northerners could put out another
strong squad this year after the
losses they suffered last June via
the diploma route. But Jimmy Phe
lan has pulled another powerful
team out of the chaos brought on
by graduation.
The Huskies first string can stand
up against any football machine on
the Coast, but when it comes to re
serves, Phelan is rather hard
pressed. With the lowa hurdle pass
ed, the Huskies point toward that
all-important clash with U.S.C. The
loser will probably be eliminated
from the conference race.

club in the Beavers than that 7-6

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
The Trojans are rated so close be
hind Washington in pre-season dope
that there's little to choose from.
Last year Head Man Howard Jones
started his reclamation of Troy and
fans looked for another bone-crush
ing Trojan outfit as of the days of
old. They were probably disappoint
ed when the southerners proved to
be just another team.
This year, with 21 lettermen re
turning and with the additions made
possible by the famous Troy frosh
of 1936, the Trojans should come
through the season with a better than
average record.
STANFORD
Yes, the boys right here on the
Farm were picked for fourth place.
There's going to be a little doubt
about it now in the minds of some
after the Bronco debacle, but after
tomorrow's little fracas with the
Webfeet up north things may look
a lot different.
Everything was in that
Santa Clara game—if the boys just
correct half of the difficulties, they'll
really conduct themselves like a ball
team to be feared.
With Jack Clark through for the
season, the Cards still have three
candidates for the All-Coast team —
Bill Paulman at quarter; Pete Zagar,
tackle; and Little Jimmy Coffis, the
coast's supreme safety scurrier.
OREGON STATE
Alonzo Stiner has a better ball
club in the Beavers than that 7-6
reversal by Idaho would indicate.
The Oregon State team will be made
up almost entirely of veterans, many
of them playing their last year for
the Beavers. Tiny Thornhill rates
the Beavers just about tops in coast
grid circles. It is the concensus of
opinion that the Oregon Staters will
give the Bears more to think about
than Slip Madigan's men had to
offer.
Incidentally, Joe Gray, known
more affectionately as Ghost Gray,
does a little cavorting in the Beaver
back field. Bobby Grayson thinks
Gray is just about the best back
field man in moleskins in the coun
try this year.
U.C.L.A.
Here indeed is the dark horse
team of the conference chase. The
Bruins are picked for sixth place in
this concensus, but this may turn
out to be the biggest mistake of the
prognosticators. The Bruins from
Westwood don't appear to be too
strong on defense, but Bill Spauld
ing's stress on offense in early prac
tice sessions may have something
to do with this. »
The Bruins smashed Oregon 26-13
last week. Fans are going to hear
plenty from those two colored
flashes, Woodrow Wilson Strode, an
end, and Kenny Washington, triple
threat backfleld ace.
WASHINGTON STATE
The team that finished second
place in 'he race last year appears
to be pretty much out of the run
n'ng this season. Little Gonzaga
held the Cougars to a scoreless tie
last Saturday.

Coach Babe Hollingbery never
turns out a doormat squad, but the
Cougars lost too many good regu
lars from last year; All-American
Ed Goddard among the losses.
The Cougars may finish better
than the seventh place spot we've
pocketed them in, but they haven't
much chance of finishing among the
top four.
OREGON
Prink Callison's Webfeet gridders
lost to U.C.L.A. in their first game
by a convincing 26-13 margin. The
fact that they pushed across two
touchdowns on the Bruins shows
the Webfeet can at least get out of
their own way.
The Oregonians meet the Stan
ford Reds Saturday on their home
camping grounds and a win over the
Cards may make this last place pre
diction for Callison's men look rather
feeble.
The Webfeet have no world beat
ing team this year, but their veteran
studded squad (with no standouts)
should make things interesting for
several of the P.C.C. teams.
