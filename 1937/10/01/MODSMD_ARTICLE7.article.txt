# Book Rebates Go to Aid Fund
## Needy Students Given Bookstore Profits 
### 
No bookstore rebates will be giv
en this year, according to a ruling
passed spring quarter by Ex Com
mittee.
Green receipts are still given, but
they no longer make the holder eli
gible for a partial refund, surplus
profits now being given to the stu
dent aid fund.
Student Manager Chuck Fontius,
commenting on the situation yester
day, pointed out that the $6000 com
prising last year's profits would
amount to an average of only 58
cents per student in rebates.
When used as student aid allot
ments, Fontius said, this sum can be
of much assistance to a few stu
dents, aiding chiefly those ineligible
for regular scholarships often be
cause of their money-earning jobs.
Another objection to the rebate
system has been that a few students
upped their income by hanging
around the bookstore, retrieving re
ceipts as they were thrown away.
