# Stanford Gridders Gunning for Oregon Ducks
## Indian Team Confident Of Decisive Win Stone, Paulman Picked To Be Signal-Callers In Game Tomorrow 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
They weren't worried—those 31
Indian gridders who hopped the
train for Eugene yesterday.
Laughing and joking throughout
their last home practice before Sat
urday's game against the University
of Oregon indicated that they were
confident of a smashing victory. Yes
terday's practice session began at
noon as a final warm-up before an
overnight train trip to Eugene.
Grant Stone and Bill Paulman
called signals and probably will be
Saturday's barkers. It is likely that
Stone will do all the brain work
thereafter. Ed Gamier warmed up
for the first time since he injured
his ankle last weekend and is making
the northern trip.
Weak in Kicking
But why all the confidence? Ore
gon is no punk ball club. They com
pare in many ways with Santa Clara,
and have an even better passing at
tack. Yet the Indian ball-tossers
have much better finesse than the
Webfeet, particularly in choosing
receivers.
Oregon's great weakness is in
kicking, according to Coach Ben
Winkleman, who saw the northern
aggregation bow to U.C.L.A. last
Friday, 26-13. Of course, that was
a Stanford weakness in the Santa
Clara game, but this week's practice
sessions have ironed that out along
with several other rough spots that
appeared Saturday.
Pass-receiving of the Cards and
Webfeet is a point of contrast be
tween the two teams. Oregon's ends
and backs are fast enough to plan
their pass-receiving to outrun their
opponents, while Coach Tiny Thorn
hill's system depends upon clever
placing of receivers.
The Last Year
The Stanford team is much better
balanced than the Webfoot combina
tion. While the Indians have good
men playing behind all regulars,
Coach Prink Callison of Oregon has
few good line reserves.
Coach Callison's boys play a driv
ing game with few end plays, prob
ably because they have no good
ends. They haven't a tackle that
can come close to Zagar, and their
ends cannot match any of four In
dian flankmen.
Oregon has never defeated Stan
ford, and last year's game was a
tie, 7-7. The Webfoot men are light
er than the Indians, about five
pounds per man.
Dale Lasselle should be the In
dians' greatest worry. He did not
play much in the U.C.L.A. game, but
he is a fast, cagey left halfback. It
was Lasselle who last year made a
37-yard run, which led to a touch
down tying up a game that would
otherwise have been Stanford's.

They weren't worried—those 31
Indian gridders who hopped the
train for Eugene yesterday.
Laughing and joking throughout
their last home practice before Sat
urday's game against the University
of Oregon indicated that they were
confident of a smashing victory. Yes
terday's practice session began at
noon as a final warm-up before an
overnight train trip to Eugene.
Grant Stone and Bill Paulman
called signals and probably will be
Saturday's barkers. It is likely that
Stone will do all the brain work
thereafter. Ed Gamier warmed up
for the first time since he injured
his ankle last weekend and is making
the northern trip.
Weak in Kicking
But why all the confidence? Ore
gon is no punk ball club. They com
pare in many ways with Santa Clara,
and have an even better passing at
tack. Yet the Indian ball-tossers
have much better finesse than the
Webfeet, particularly in choosing
receivers.
Oregon's great weakness is in
kicking, according to Coach Ben
Winkleman, who saw the northern
aggregation bow to U.C.L.A. last
Friday, 26-13. Of course, that was
a Stanford weakness in the Santa
Clara game, but this week's practice
sessions have ironed that out along
with several other rough spots that
appeared Saturday.
Pass-receiving of the Cards and
Webfeet is a point of contrast be
tween the two teams. Oregon's ends
and backs are fast enough to plan
their pass-receiving to outrun their
opponents, while Coach Tiny Thorn
hill's system depends upon clever
placing of receivers.
The Last Year
The Stanford team is much better
balanced than the Webfoot combina
tion. While the Indians have good
men playing behind all regulars,
Coach Prink Callison of Oregon has
few good line reserves.
Coach Callison's boys play a driv
ing game with few end plays, prob
ably because they have no good
ends. They haven't a tackle that
can come close to Zagar, and their
ends cannot match any of four In
dian flankmen.
Oregon has never defeated Stan
ford, and last year's game was a
tie, 7-7. The Webfoot men are light
er than the Indians, about five
pounds per man.
Dale Lasselle should be the In
dians' greatest worry. He did not
play much in the U.C.L.A. game, but
he is a fast, cagey left halfback. It
was Lasselle who last year made a
37-yard run, which led to a touch
down tying up a game that would
otherwise have been Stanford's.
