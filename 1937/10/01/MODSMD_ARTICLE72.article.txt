a low pitch, and Patchett fouled out
before Williams singled to score
Ward.

with two men out. Myatt flied to
Tresh, and Thompson dropped one
into the hands of Coscarart. Patchett

to third on catcher Cronin's wild
throw to second. Williams laid out
a long one to center field, and Patch
ett raced across the bag for the final
San Diego run.

nearly upset the day for Ward. Be
