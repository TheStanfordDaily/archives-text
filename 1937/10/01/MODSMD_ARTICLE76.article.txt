They have all their team off the in
jured list. They're out lor'a victory.
Team Rates High
Coach Harry Shipkey knows
nothing specific about the Modesto
team. But he does know that they're
rated about as high as Santa Ana
J. C., "which is high enough for my
league," said Shipkey. "But it won't
be high enough for the Papoose to
morrow."
Assistant Coach Woody Adams
stated, "I predict a Stanford victory
by two touchdowns. *The boys are
looking better than they've looked
since they've been on the Farm.
None of our first-string is crippled
up this week, and I feel sure we'll
win."
