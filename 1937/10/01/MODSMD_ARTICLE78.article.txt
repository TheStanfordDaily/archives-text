## Streamlining The "One Horse Shay" 
### 
WITH the streamlining of Stanford's dra
matic plant, comes now a proposal to
sweep the "one-horse shay" out of the student
organization which will man that plant.
This afternoon presidents of the four exist
ing bodies which wield and unwield student
dramatics will seek sanction of their various
organizations to a proposal which would amal
gamate all four into one—The Stanford Play
ers—a streamlined student group to handle with
efficiency what the four previously managed
with piddling discontent.
It's a big move in Stanford dramatics, and a
good one.
Too long the intricate network woven by
Ram's Head, Masquers, Sword and Sandals,
and Barnstormers, one with the other, has
proven too intangible a web for the average
Stanfordite to untangle. Posters say annual
Barnstormers' production, and so forth, but
who does what, when, where and why, is gen
erally considered too complicated for the cas
ual playgoer to know.

The new streamlined outfit will be only
slightly larger than the largest of the old four,
since each body contained almost the same
personnel as the others. Its membership will
not be confined to players —there will be set
designers, directors, some musicians, stage
hands, and managers—students interested in
every field essential to the production of drama.
And with its all-inclusive membership the Stan
ford Players would produce three student shows
• each year: Gaieties, Spring Show and a Winter
Show.
With combined talents, student dramatics at
Stanford in the new physical plant might well
gain national recognition, but only if well
enough organized. The new proposal aims at
that.
If Stanford's drama whips can forget about
"artistic temperaments" long enough this after
noon to kiss each other's cheeks and if senti
mentalists can see four old drama societies
junked, there may arise a new student organi
zation to carry its part in what is being called
"a new era in Stanford dramatics."
