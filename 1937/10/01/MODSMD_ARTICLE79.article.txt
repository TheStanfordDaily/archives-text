# When White Robe Turns Black

TONIGHT Mr. Justice Black of the Supreme
Court will attempt in a radio speech to ex
plain why membership in the Ku Klux Klan
does not affect his fitness for the Supreme Court.
Mr. Black's reason for joining the Ku Klux
Klan is not so significant as the reason for most
of the opposition to his appointment. He has
little defense except that he is a good politician,
and it was good politics to join the Klan in Ala
bama in 1926. He prepared a resignation which
he may or may not have submitted. He may
say that proof of his membership could be ob
tained only from the Klan and only because his
views, since 1926, have been far from identical
with those of the Klan.
Mr. Black's attackers have not been really
concerned with his lack of experience as a
judge. Mediocre jurists have been associate
justices in the past.
Hypocrisy, rather, has been the keynote of the
editorial field day. It has been a spectacle of
conservative "American" newspapers and pub
lic figures condemning a man for joining the
pioneer exponent of "Americanism." In spite
of Mr. Black's Klan affiliation, his attackers are
not sure of his "Americanism." Even more they
have welcomed the case as a grindstone for
political axes.
Tonight Mr. Black will give his useless ex
planation, not to the Jews, Catholics, and Ne
groes that the Klan has persecuted, because
they have asked for no explanation, but to
opposing politicians who knew a good thing
when they saw one.—L. L.
