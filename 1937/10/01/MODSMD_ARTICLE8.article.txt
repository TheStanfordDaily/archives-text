# England Plans Japan Boycott
## Labor Party To Demand Special Session 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 30 (UP).â€”Rapidly
increasing anger over the Japanese
war in China may bring an emer
gency session of Parliament to con
sider the Far Eastern crisis, it was
understood today.
Moreover, it was certain that if a
special session were called, one of
its principal concerns would be a
demand for a blanket boycott on all
Japanese goods, regardless of con
sequences.
Labor Party leaders were expected
to take the lead in demanding a
special session. In making any such
demand, however, it was indicated
that they would have important
backing from liberals and even from
some conservative elements.
