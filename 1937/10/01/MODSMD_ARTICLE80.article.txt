# BULL SESSION
## NO STRIKES, NO ERRORS 
### 
IT IS about this time every year that our more rela
tive comrades begin to lament the fact that Amer
ican students refuse to participate in the economic and
political brawls of our day. The scavenger hunt for
crip courses has closed, and the amount of assigned
work can still be estimated without resorting to log
tables. To apprentice rabble nousers it appears an
ideal time for a bit of rioting or parading. And when
they find the average college student more interested
in making trips down the highway than in arranging
a demonstration against the heart-rending treatment
of the natives of lower Iraq, they call him conceited,
self-centered, and blind.
It is true, of course, that the ordinary student s
participation in national politics is limited to clapping
or booing the news reels. It is also true that he can
dig up very little sympathy for some battered minority
of little brown brethren. Perhaps this heartlessness
depletes his account in the Bank of Heaven, but it
saves considerable depreciation of the nervous system,
and it allows time for a little studying.

Our tryoutee soapboxers point reproachfully to
the political activities of the European student. They
tell us that he parades, demonstrates, riots and peti
tions the authorities into squelching evil and advanc
ing the Kingdom of Heaven, Marx. Hitler (multiple
choice; pick one).
They neglect to point out that students who riot
spend quite a bit of time guiding broken noses back
into place and acclimating synthetic teeth to their
new home. Nor do Our amateur spreaders of light
explain how foreign undergraduated find time to learn
anything more complicated than the best way of dodg
ing a descending nightstick.

A MERICAN universities are not intended to turn
out apostles and liberators. They are not designed
to train militant leaders of the masses. Most students
go to college to learn something about the world. The
very fact that they go indicates that they are not posi
tive that any one doctrine is absolutely correct.
When students junk the detached viewpoint and
join a picket line, they take on a load of prejudice and
narrowness that will color everything they see. They
become opinionated zealots.
And when undergraduates parade, shout, and sign
useless petitions they are wasting time and making
unnecessary trouble. It is all very well to feel sym
pathetic toward our "poor, oppressed brothers," the
ditch diggers. But until we have studied the situation
thoroughly it is foolish to fight for them. Incidentally,
it is foolish to fight; plastic surgery is so expensive
Anyone who thinks that a couple of elementary
ccon courses have given him a sound basis for smash
ing faces, has gotten a little more out of the work
than the announcement of courses promised. Of
course, our brilliant agitators may be able to see
through the economic problems. But the rest of us
poor clods would prefer to learn a bit more about
the world before we get our teeth kicked out for
jin.ybody's C'.iuse. John Cobbs

It is true, of course, that the ordinary student s

of little brown brethren. Perhaps this heartlessness

A MERICAN universities are not intended to turn
out apostles and liberators. They are not designed
to train militant leaders of the masses. Most students
go to college to learn something about the world. The
very fact that they go indicates that they are not posi
tive that any one doctrine is absolutely correct.
When students junk the detached viewpoint and
join a picket line, they take on a load of prejudice and
narrowness that will color everything they see. They
become opinionated zealots.
And when undergraduates parade, shout, and sign
useless petitions they are wasting time and making
unnecessary trouble. It is all very well to feel sym
pathetic toward our "poor, oppressed brothers," the
ditch diggers. But until we have studied the situation
thoroughly it is foolish to fight for them. Incidentally,
it is foolish to fight; plastic surgery is so expensive
Anyone who thinks that a couple of elementary
ccon courses have given him a sound basis for smash
ing faces, has gotten a little more out of the work
than the announcement of courses promised. Of
course, our brilliant agitators may be able to see
through the economic problems. But the rest of us
poor clods would prefer to learn a bit more about
the world before we get our teeth kicked out for

IT IS about this time every year that our more rela

political brawls of our day. The scavenger hunt for
crip courses has closed, and the amount of assigned
work can still be estimated without resorting to log
tables. To apprentice rabble nousers it appears an
ideal time for a bit of rioting or parading. And when
