# INSIDE CHINA

rpHE constant threat of Japanese imperialism ham
mering for years not only at the north but also at
the south has done anything but put China to sleep,
for leader and Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek has
been planning, collecting war materials, and educating
the masses all at the same time.
Realizing that the Nipponese possess an impressive
navy whose guns could easily destroy coast cities, he
formulated one plan whereby Chinese soldiers and
civilians alike would literally retreat from the sea
coast destroying every trace of civilization as they
went. Then when the Japanese moved in and started
rebuilding they would constantly be threatened from
the rear, prolonging the war for an indefinite period
and gradually wearing down the invaders. The Chi
nese have not been forced to adopt this plan as yet,
but no one can say when they will.
Japan's chances of subduing four hundred million
people seem awfully slim. Her record in Manchuria
gives concrete evidence for this statement. Ever since
she took over the puppet state she has had to keep
over a hundrd thousand troops on active duty sup
posedly surpressing "bandits." Anyway, that is what
she called rebelling Chinese. Recently her hold on
Manchuria was loosened when Japanese-trained Chi
nese soldiers mutinied, killing the Nipponese officers.
To date the two hundred thousand crack troops of
the Central Chinese Government have not been used
against the Japanese. Dictator Chiang and henchmen
seem to have a very substantial reason for this—namely,
that these troops have been kept in a central position
ready to fill in any place where the front line may
weaken. Known as the best fighting outfit in the Orient
they are mechanized enough to take advantage of a
new network of roads constructed recently between
strategic points.
Second job for these crack units is to form a
subtle background to the front lines mex"ely to make
sure they won't march in the wrong direction.
* * * *
/ 'I-lINA has, or did have, about twelve hundred
planes; the pilots are good, reputedly better than
the Japanese. If this is true, then why don't they
bomb Tokio? To this two significant answers may be
given.
First, if they spread the theater of war to Japan,
America would necessarily have to clamp down with
the Neutrality Act, which in turn would stop ship
ments of arms from this country. True, the United
States still exports great quantities of scrap iron to
Japan, but China still gains in the long run as she
needs oil, steel, and all sorts of munitions.
Second reason that may be restraining her from
bombing Japan may be the fact that the Japanese
people do not give their full support to the present
policies of the militaristic government. Although there
can not be any out and out anti-war propaganda, v/ar
enthusiasm does not seem to be voluntary.
The Chinese soldiers seem at this time to bear an
inherent hatred toward Japan. They feel that they
are defending their homes, wives, and children, and
that they have suffered enough humiliation from the
Japanese. During our stay in Peiping in the first few
days of fighting many stories concerning their fierce
ness floated about.
One we heard concerned the steel broad swords
they carry and manipulate so well. According to this
story were wearing steel collars as the
Chinese had relieved a number of them of their
heads, and without a head a Japanese gentlman or
soldier couldn't go wherever Japanese gentlemen or
soldiers go when they die. The point of the story is
that the Chinese seem to be more triumphant in hand
to hand encounters with broadswords than they would
be with bayonets.

that the Chinese seem to be more triumphant in hand
to hand encounters with broadswords than they would
be with bayonets.

rpHE constant threat of Japanese imperialism ham
mering for years not only at the north but also at
the south has done anything but put China to sleep,
for leader and Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek has
been planning, collecting war materials, and educating
the masses all at the same time.
Realizing that the Nipponese possess an impressive
navy whose guns could easily destroy coast cities, he
formulated one plan whereby Chinese soldiers and
civilians alike would literally retreat from the sea
coast destroying every trace of civilization as they
went. Then when the Japanese moved in and started
rebuilding they would constantly be threatened from
the rear, prolonging the war for an indefinite period
and gradually wearing down the invaders. The Chi
nese have not been forced to adopt this plan as yet,
but no one can say when they will.
Japan's chances of subduing four hundred million
people seem awfully slim. Her record in Manchuria
gives concrete evidence for this statement. Ever since
she took over the puppet state she has had to keep
over a hundrd thousand troops on active duty sup
posedly surpressing "bandits." Anyway, that is what
she called rebelling Chinese. Recently her hold on
Manchuria was loosened when Japanese-trained Chi
nese soldiers mutinied, killing the Nipponese officers.
To date the two hundred thousand crack troops of
the Central Chinese Government have not been used
against the Japanese. Dictator Chiang and henchmen
seem to have a very substantial reason for this—namely,
that these troops have been kept in a central position
ready to fill in any place where the front line may
weaken. Known as the best fighting outfit in the Orient
they are mechanized enough to take advantage of a
new network of roads constructed recently between
strategic points.
Second job for these crack units is to form a
subtle background to the front lines mex"ely to make
sure they won't march in the wrong direction.

/ 'I-lINA has, or did have, about twelve hundred
planes; the pilots are good, reputedly better than
the Japanese. If this is true, then why don't they
bomb Tokio? To this two significant answers may be
given.
First, if they spread the theater of war to Japan,
America would necessarily have to clamp down with
the Neutrality Act, which in turn would stop ship
ments of arms from this country. True, the United
States still exports great quantities of scrap iron to
Japan, but China still gains in the long run as she
needs oil, steel, and all sorts of munitions.
Second reason that may be restraining her from
bombing Japan may be the fact that the Japanese
people do not give their full support to the present
policies of the militaristic government. Although there
can not be any out and out anti-war propaganda, v/ar
enthusiasm does not seem to be voluntary.
The Chinese soldiers seem at this time to bear an
inherent hatred toward Japan. They feel that they
are defending their homes, wives, and children, and
that they have suffered enough humiliation from the
Japanese. During our stay in Peiping in the first few
days of fighting many stories concerning their fierce
ness floated about.
One we heard concerned the steel broad swords
they carry and manipulate so well. According to this
story were wearing steel collars as the
Chinese had relieved a number of them of their
heads, and without a head a Japanese gentlman or
soldier couldn't go wherever Japanese gentlemen or
soldiers go when they die. The point of the story is
that the Chinese seem to be more triumphant in hand
to hand encounters with broadswords than they would
be with bayonets.
