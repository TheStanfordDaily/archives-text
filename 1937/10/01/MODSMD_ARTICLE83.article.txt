# Van Der Veer Tale Captures Quiet Charm
## 
### 
There is no very adequate way to
review a book of such quiet charm
as Judy Van Der Veer's "The River
Pasture" (Longmans, Green & Co.).
To dutiful collegians still groggy
from their summer's tilt with Scar
lett and Rhett and the South that
went with the wind, it will doubtless
seem lacking in animation and in
terest. Nothing very much happens;
it happens in less than two hundred
pages; the main personages are ani
mals; and yet under the persuasive
pen of it's author it becomes one of
the most satisfying books in many
a long day.
Oversees Ranch
Judy Van Der Veer is described in
the blurb as "a young woman, a
very young woman, who lives on a
ranch in Southern California."
Where the ranch is she does not say,
except to intimate that it is one of
those sprawling places which lie
back along the foothills, probably
near enough to be included in Los
Angeles in fact, but a thousand miles
away in spirit.
On her ranch Miss Van Der Veer,
evidently an efficient person, over
sees the handling of the cattle
throughout the year, the breaking
and raising of the horses, the shifting
of the stock in times of flood and
drouth. Her book is made up of
anecdotes concerning the various
personalities, human and animal,
which inhabit the river pasture. But
what her book is, and what it suc
ceeds in being far more than any
broadside from the Chamber of
Commerce, is a description of the
temperamental, often unlovable, but
ever-intriguing Golden State.
Writes of California
In this little book Miss Van Dei-
Veer has captured the California of
sudden seasons and unpredictable
weather; of bare brown hills and
long hot days yielding abruptly to
winter rain and as abruptly to the
green grasses and transitory fresh
ness of spring. Very quietly, very
unobtrusively, she writes a, book
whose principal charm lies in the
fact that its author never strives for
an effect, never over-writes. Her
life is unadorned; her book is simi
larly unadorned.
Some day Alexander Wollcott will
probably discover this, and in a phil
anthropic mood boost it into the
prominence he gave "Lost Horizon."
When that day comes it will be a
duty book, and everyone will read
it. But for the present, one recom
mends it with trepidation to a col
lege audience. Probably you'd bet
ter stick with Scarlett.

green grasses and transitory fresh
ness of spring. Very quietly, very
unobtrusively, she writes a, book
whose principal charm lies in the
fact that its author never strives for
an effect, never over-writes. Her
life is unadorned; her book is simi
larly unadorned.
Some day Alexander Wollcott will
probably discover this, and in a phil
anthropic mood boost it into the
prominence he gave "Lost Horizon."
When that day comes it will be a
duty book, and everyone will read
it. But for the present, one recom
mends it with trepidation to a col
lege audience. Probably you'd bet
ter stick with Scarlett.

There is no very adequate way to
review a book of such quiet charm
as Judy Van Der Veer's "The River
Pasture" (Longmans, Green & Co.).
To dutiful collegians still groggy
from their summer's tilt with Scar
lett and Rhett and the South that
went with the wind, it will doubtless
seem lacking in animation and in
terest. Nothing very much happens;
it happens in less than two hundred
pages; the main personages are ani
mals; and yet under the persuasive
pen of it's author it becomes one of
the most satisfying books in many
a long day.
Oversees Ranch
Judy Van Der Veer is described in
the blurb as "a young woman, a
very young woman, who lives on a
ranch in Southern California."
Where the ranch is she does not say,
except to intimate that it is one of
those sprawling places which lie
back along the foothills, probably
near enough to be included in Los
Angeles in fact, but a thousand miles
away in spirit.
On her ranch Miss Van Der Veer,
evidently an efficient person, over
sees the handling of the cattle
throughout the year, the breaking
and raising of the horses, the shifting
of the stock in times of flood and
drouth. Her book is made up of
anecdotes concerning the various
personalities, human and animal,
which inhabit the river pasture. But
what her book is, and what it suc
ceeds in being far more than any
broadside from the Chamber of
Commerce, is a description of the
temperamental, often unlovable, but
ever-intriguing Golden State.
Writes of California
In this little book Miss Van Dei-
Veer has captured the California of
sudden seasons and unpredictable
weather; of bare brown hills and
long hot days yielding abruptly to
winter rain and as abruptly to the
green grasses and transitory fresh
ness of spring. Very quietly, very
unobtrusively, she writes a, book
whose principal charm lies in the
fact that its author never strives for
an effect, never over-writes. Her
life is unadorned; her book is simi
larly unadorned.
