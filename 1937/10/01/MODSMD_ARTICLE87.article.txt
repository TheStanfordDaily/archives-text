# Candy Delivery Proves False Alarm on Lasuen
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
There was a row 011 the How last night. Sorority women in each of
their nine houses were interrupted at dinner by the delivery of generous
sized boxes of chocolate candies.
Custom dictates that whenever an active sorority member becomes
engaged, her fiance sends the house a live-pound box of chocolates. These

are opened at dinner, and the an-<
nouncement is made. Following a
period of congratulations and gen
eral excitement, the sweets are
generally disposed of with unbe
lievable and altogether undignified
rapidity.
Excitement Usual
Always the arrival of a package of
candy during dinner is greeted by
much cackling comment from the
assembled sisters. When dozens oi
dithered damsels all along Lasuen
last night hurriedly opened prom
ising looking boxes to find that they
had been sent with the compliments
of a Palo Alto confectionery, the
let-down was terrific, my dear!
At the A. O. Pi house an unusual
set of circumstances added to the
commotion. Helene Wilkens, who
was to have been a senior this year,
had not returned to college, and as
yet no word had been received in the
house. Suspecting that an engage
ment might be the reason for the
absence of their sister-under-the
pin, the girls were more than ordi
narily nonplussed at the discovery
of the real identity of the donor of
the confections.
Proves Prophetic
Less than a half hour later, how
ever, A. O. Pi's received a phone
call from the missing member to the
effect that she had eloped just a
few days before, on her return from
Europe.
It is to be noted that in spite of its
false origin, the candy was compe
tently consumed in every case.
