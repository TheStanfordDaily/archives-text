# Yankee Funnyman May Pay for Gag

### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 30 (UP). â€”
Tony Lazzeri, New York Yankee
second baseman, faced a $500 fine
today because of a prank.
In the eighth inning of a game with
the Philadelphia Athletics, Kemp
Wicker was in the box for the Yank
3es, and Bob Johnson of the A's was
at bat. Johnson swung, and a dirty,
almost lop-sided ball bounced off his
bat. The umpire investigated, dis
covered it was a ball the Yanks had
used in infield practice.
The players took it as a joke.
Lazzeri had given the ball to Wicker
and had pocketed the new one Um
pire Johnny Quinn had thrown to
he field. The umpires said Lazzeri
violated the rule prohibiting tam
pering with the ball. The incident
will be reported to League President
Will Harridge and Lazzeri is wait
ing to learn whether he'll receive a
reprimand or a fine.
