# Stanford Machine Improves Despite Defeat by Oregon
## Cardinals Gain Yards Downfield but Falter At Goal; Paulman Out 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Where and when?
Will the Indian gridders take out
the blocking, charging, and kicking
skill they have shown in practice
and use it to win a game?
Students at the University of Ore
gon today are boasting their first
victory over Stanford. Last year
brought the first tie score between
the two universities, and Saturday
the tables turned for the first time
against Stanford, 7-6.
If rusty bearings in the Big Red
Machine continue to iron out as well
this week as they did last and if the
improvement appears in games as

well as in practice sessions, the
hardest and most important games
yet to be played should be a series
of Redskin victories.
The Stanford boys did show im
provement — a lot more than the
score would indicate. In fact, the
figures show that they won that
game decisively in every other re
spect.
Big Yardage Total
Although they crossed a goal line
only once, the Indians moved the
ball a total of 376 yards, nearly four
times the length of the field. And
the Webfeet gained only 200 yards.
The Cardinal machine chalked up
If) first downs against Oregon's 8.
The Ducks completed only 3 out of
9 attempted forward passes, while
the Redskins completed 12 out of 23.
Although Bill Paulman's kicking
and passing would have come in
handy after he left the game with a
torn shoulder ligament in the first
quarter, A1 Alustiza turned in a good
performance as substitute. He did
some excellent blocking and made a
scries of fine tackles.
Hamilton Flips 'Em
And when Jim Groves was
yanked in the same quarter with an
injured hand, Glenn Hamilton took
the opportunity to put on a passing
exhibition. He showed plenty of
brainwork in choosing receivers and
remarkable finesse in placing the
ball in their hands.
It should be noted here that all
these passes were not received by
Grant Stone, who can yank them
down from any angle, but Hamilton
was successful in placing the ball in
the hands of nearly every eligible
receiver on the team.
Groves Stands Out
Groves, hollow-cheeked curly
headed fullback, who spent the sec
ond quarter on the bench with a
cleat-wound on his left hand, stood
out as master of the field in ground
play. Groves' record of 118 yards
advanced was seconded by that of
Oregon's star halfback, Dale Las
selle, who covered 46 yards.
Groves also chalked up several
successful passes, ably received by
Gene Coldiron, red-headed sopho
more, and Jimmy Coffis.
Kirsch Is Good
Bill Kirsch, Stanford halfback,
continued to draw attention as a
tackier. As a ball-carrier, he aver
aged better yardage than any other
member of the team. Tony Calvelli
stood out as an expert roving cen-
ter, and also did some fine tackling.
Technically, Bill Fosketf, Oregon
tackle who blocked Groves' conver
sion kick, and Joe Huston, guard
who scored the extra point for the
Ducks, won the game for the Uni
versity of Oregon.

But it was Jay Graybeal, sopho
more sensation of the Webfoot ag
gregation, who became Stanford's
Nemesis. Not only did he score the
winning tduchdown, but he also
made several long runs and one long
kickoff return, and intercepted two
Card passes at strategic points, al
most making a touchdown when he
caught a toss from Hamilton in the
last three minutes of the game.
Although U.C.L.A. swamped Ore
gon, 26-13, and Oregon defeated
Stanford, it is easily possible that a
week of continued improvement
will bring about a Card victory over
the Bruins Saturday.

quarter, A1 Alustiza turned in a good
performance as substitute. He did
some excellent blocking and made a
scries of fine tackles.
Hamilton Flips 'Em
And when Jim Groves was
yanked in the same quarter with an
injured hand, Glenn Hamilton took
the opportunity to put on a passing
exhibition. He showed plenty of
brainwork in choosing receivers and
remarkable finesse in placing the
ball in their hands.
It should be noted here that all
these passes were not received by
Grant Stone, who can yank them
down from any angle, but Hamilton
was successful in placing the ball in
the hands of nearly every eligible
receiver on the team.
Groves Stands Out
Groves, hollow-cheeked curly
headed fullback, who spent the sec
ond quarter on the bench with a
cleat-wound on his left hand, stood
out as master of the field in ground
play. Groves' record of 118 yards
advanced was seconded by that of
Oregon's star halfback, Dale Las
selle, who covered 46 yards.
Groves also chalked up several
successful passes, ably received by
Gene Coldiron, red-headed sopho
more, and Jimmy Coffis.
Kirsch Is Good
Bill Kirsch, Stanford halfback,
continued to draw attention as a
tackier. As a ball-carrier, he aver
aged better yardage than any other
member of the team. Tony Calvelli
stood out as an expert roving cen-
ter, and also did some fine tackling.
Technically, Bill Fosketf, Oregon
tackle who blocked Groves' conver
sion kick, and Joe Huston, guard
who scored the extra point for the
Ducks, won the game for the Uni
versity of Oregon.

But it was Jay Graybeal, sopho
more sensation of the Webfoot ag
gregation, who became Stanford's
Nemesis. Not only did he score the
winning tduchdown, but he also
made several long runs and one long
kickoff return, and intercepted two
Card passes at strategic points, al
most making a touchdown when he
caught a toss from Hamilton in the
last three minutes of the game.
Although U.C.L.A. swamped Ore
gon, 26-13, and Oregon defeated
Stanford, it is easily possible that a
week of continued improvement
will bring about a Card victory over
the Bruins Saturday.
Where and when?
Will the Indian gridders take out
the blocking, charging, and kicking
skill they have shown in practice
and use it to win a game?
Students at the University of Ore
gon today are boasting their first
victory over Stanford. Last year
brought the first tie score between
the two universities, and Saturday
the tables turned for the first time
against Stanford, 7-6.
If rusty bearings in the Big Red
Machine continue to iron out as well
this week as they did last and if the
improvement appears in games as

well as in practice sessions, the
hardest and most important games
yet to be played should be a series
of Redskin victories.
The Stanford boys did show im
provement — a lot more than the
score would indicate. In fact, the
figures show that they won that
game decisively in every other re
spect.
Big Yardage Total
Although they crossed a goal line
only once, the Indians moved the
ball a total of 376 yards, nearly four
times the length of the field. And
the Webfeet gained only 200 yards.
The Cardinal machine chalked up
If) first downs against Oregon's 8.
The Ducks completed only 3 out of
9 attempted forward passes, while
the Redskins completed 12 out of 23.

torn shoulder ligament in the first
