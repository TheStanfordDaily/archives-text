## 
### 
The Klahoya Club for off-campus
women announces that it will have
its first luncheon for this year
Tuesday noon in the Women's Club
house. All off-campus women are in
vited to attend, and become ac
quainted with the organization,
which is the only contact they are
afforded of keeping posted on new
rulings by Women's Council.
Dorothy Brown, president of the
club, and Louise Fish, vice-presi
dent, are working on plans of the
club's activities for the year, which
will probably include a dance and
several informal parties.
