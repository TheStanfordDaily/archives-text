# Wilbur Greets Freshmen at Matriculation
## 
### 
A colorful picture of Stanford's
academic life was presented in Me
morial Church yesterday morning
when the University's administra
tive officers, in picturesque scholas
tic robes, greeted the freshman
class at the annual Matriculation
Service.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
pointed out Stanford's non-sectarian
religious policy. He said that going
to chapel was not compulsory, but
the opportunity was here for all
those who wanted to take advantage
of it.
The University chaplain, Dr. D.
Elton Trueblood, told of Stanford's
inspiring qualities by citing the ex
ample of one particular man who
gained from his student life here.
Other speakers to greet the new
students included Dean Mary Yost
and Dean George B. Culver.
This year's freshman choir, a new
Stanford tradition inaugurated last
year by Warren D. Allen, made its
second appearance.
Other event on the freshman social
calendar this week-end was the re
ception at the home of Dr. and Mrs.
Ray Lyman Wilbur. Dancing in the
ballroom and on the terrace was
the main diversion of the evening.
