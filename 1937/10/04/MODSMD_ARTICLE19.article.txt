# F.R. Will Allow Black To Take Seat on Court
## Former Ku Kluxer Will Become Justice In Today's Ceremonies 
### 
ABOARD PRESIDENT ROOSE
VELT'S SPECIAL TRAIN through
Montana, Oct. 3 (U.R). — President
Roosevelt will allow Associate Jus
tice Hugo L. Black to take his seat
on the U.S. Supreme Court bench
at noon tomorrow without break
ing his silence on the Alabaman's
one-time membership in the Ku
Klux Klan, an aide close to the
president revealed tonight.
The president, the.source said, will
issue no formal statement, and will
make no comment despite nation
wide interest in the situation. Black
admitted his former Klan affiliation
in his nationally broadcast speech
last Friday night.
No Course Open
Mr. Roosevelt, the aide explained,
decided some time ago that there
was no course of action open to him
in the Black case. Black took the
two necessary oaths and formally
became a Supreme Court member
almost immediately after he was
nominated and confirmed by the
Senate.
Even if Mr. Roosevelt should ask
for Black's resignation, the deed
would be nothing more than a re
quest. Only a charge of impeach
ment from the House of Representa
tives and conviction by the Senate
could remove him.
Visits St. Paul
When Black dons his heavy black
silk justice robe for the first time at
noon tomorrow, Mr. Roosevelt will
be in Grand Forks, N.D., headed for
St. Paul. The president will speak
at St. Paul at 8:30 o'clock C.S.T. to
morrow night on administration
farm policies.
Today the president inspected the
government's $108,6000,000 Fort
Peck, Mont., dam across the Missouri
l'iver near Glasgow. It will be the
world's largest earthen dam when
completed, controlling the stream's
flow for move than 1,100 miles and
creating a lake 180 miles long.
