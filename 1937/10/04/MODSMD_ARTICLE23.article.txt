# N.S.F.A. Plans Youth Drive
## Campaign Will Restore Cut of 45 Per Cent 
### 
Plans to organize a nation-wide
student campaign for the restoration
of the recent 45 per cent cut in the
National Youth Administration
budget were outlined in a letter re
ceived here over the week-end
from Arthur Northwood, Jr., of
Princeton, who is president of the
National Student Federation of
America.
It is probable that the proposals
contained in Northwood's letter will
be considered by Ex Committee at
its meeting tomorrow night, Student
Body President Tom Killefer said
yesterday atfernoon. The'A.S.S.U.
is affiliated with the N.S.F.A., which
is an organization of student body
councils.
Means Less Work
Pointing to the fact that Congress
at its last session passed a maximum
grant of $75,000,000 for NYA for the
coming year, Northwood's letter said
that by execuitve action this allot
ment has been cut to less than
$45,000,000.
This will provide work for only
220,000 students, instead of 310,000.
as was the case last year, Northwood
claimed. "This means," he predicted,
"that a great many students who
need NYA, who came back to col
lege anticipating NYA, are going to
find that there is nothing for them."
Drive Planned
A national campaign "to secure
an executive restoration of the full
amount of the NYA appropriation"
is being planned, to climax with
meetings at all schools on October
14.
Northwood's letter urged the
A.S.S.U. to participate in the cam
paign, which will include letters,
meetings, and delegations visiting
NYA administrators, governors, and
congressmen.
