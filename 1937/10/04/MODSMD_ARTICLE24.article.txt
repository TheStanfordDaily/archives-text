### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 3 (U.R\â€”Ed
ward C. Moran, Jr., U.S. maritime
commissioner in charge of opera
tions, said tonight that the com
mission hopes to complete its study
of essential trade routes by the end
of October and proceed with a re
arrangement of the entire U.S. mer
chant marine.
The shuffle will include rehabili
tation of maritime traffic facilities
to South America and the East Coast.
Among the many ideas considered,
Moran said, was a reshuffling of the
West Coast and the East Coast traf-
I fic in order to put the most modern
| vessels on the East Coast - South
i American lines.
