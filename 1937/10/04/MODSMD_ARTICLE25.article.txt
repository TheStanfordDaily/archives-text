# Unanimous Vote Dissolves Honorary Theater Groups; Four Societies Amalgamate
## New Players' Unit Asks Control Of Reorganized Council 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Sword and Sandals, 1893, Masquers, 1908, Ranis Head, 1911, Barn
stormers, 1936—-Stanford's traditional dramatic honorary societies are
no more.
Unanimously, the active members of these groups accepted a proposal
that they should amalgamate into one student dramatic unit at their joint

►meeting Friday in the Little Theater.
Bud Cady, president of Barnstorm
ers, presided, quoted President Bay
Lyman Wilbur's statement on the
proposed change: "It will provide a
solid basis for growth and improve
ment of student produced shows."
Up Tomorrow
A proposal asking for official rec
ognition and sanction of the new or
ganization along with the proposed
charter and constitution will be sub
mitted to Ex Committee tomorrow
night.
The fusion of societies was neces
sitated by Ex Committee's proposal
to consider complete reorganization
of Di'amatic Council at its meeting
tomorrow night, according to Cady.
It would eliminate representatives of
The Daily, Quad, and Chappie and
delegates from Sword and Sandals,
Masquers, Rams Head, and Barn
stormers.
Former Plan
The latter four members would
have been excluded under the old
system, Cady stated, because the in
dividual productions of their groups
were a basis for contention rather
than co-operation in Dramtic Coun
cil affairs. According to this plan
only the dramatic manager, the stu
dent manager, and a faculty adviser
would remain on the Council.
The new society must control Dra
matic Council if they are to select
and run student shows, decided the
presidents of the four old groups.
They base their claim on the fact
that their membership represents 90
per cent of the technical, acting, and
directorial talent on the campus.
New Council Set-up
The resolution that passed Friday's
meeting included the new organiza
tion's proposal for the reorganiza
tion of Dramatic Council. It will
suggest to Ex Committee that the
members be the present dramatic
manager, the student manager, a
faculty adviser, the president of the
new group, elected annually, the di
rector and technical director of the
show to be given by the group that
quarter.
Since the dramatic manager will
be vice-president and treasurer of
the new organization, it has a four
to three voting control of Dramatic
Council, according to the plan.
To Choose Name
The new society was to have been
called The Stanford Players, but
there was disagreement over the
name and it will be decided on at
the next meeting, to be held Wed
nesday at 4 o'clock in the Little
Theater.
Provision has been made, in case
Ex Committee refuses to recognize
the fusion group, that it will be au
tomatically dissolved and Sword
and Sandals, Masquers, Rams Head,
and Barnstormers will be active
again. However, A.S.S.U. President
Tom Killefer has intimated that the
move has his approval and support.
Only note of discord was struck
when a telegram was read from
three charter members of Barn
stormers, Frank O'Neill, Jean Al
bertson, and Waldo Salt, voting
against the proposal.
Productions Planned
Activities scheduled for the dra
matic society include the production
of Big Game Gaieties, formerly pre
sented by Rams Head, the Spring
Musical, formerly presented by
Bamstonners, one-act plays, read
ings, and a major winter production.
No mention was made at the meet
ing of touring the winter show to
other universities and California
towns, a suggestion made in the
original resolution.
An executive board, consisting of
Cady, Hal Kahn, president of Rams
Head, Jane Clary, president of
Masquers, Prestridge Ellington, pres
ident of Sword and Sandals, and
Clay McDaniel, dramatic manager,
will draw up a constitution for the
organization. Basis for future mem
bership in the society will be deter
mined by the board with the ap
proval of the members.
<I No Interference"
Cady stressed the point that the
fusion group will in no way try to
compete with Director Gordon C.
Lange of the Speech and Drama De
partment. It plans to produce stu
dent-written shows whenever good
ones are available, but may do
plays by outside authors if it is
found advisable.
"The Players" ask control of Dra
matic Council so that they may gov
ern the selection, casting, direction,
technical direction, budget, censor
ship, and house managership of
student "dramatic productions.
