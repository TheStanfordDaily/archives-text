professor of the Graduate School of
Business, will be featured speaker
on the Stanford University Radio
Hour at 9 o'clock tonight over sta
tion KGG.
In discussing the business outlook
for the next few months, Professor

hostilities in Spain and China, with
the threat of a world war, the possi
bility of serious labor troubles, and
the fear of confiscatory taxes and
other hostile legislative measures.
The succession of price declines
in the stock markets of the country,
marking the greatest shrinkage in
values since 1931, will form a portion
of the talk, but will be considered in
the light of general business condi
tions, which Professor Dowrie con
siders favorable.
Legislative policies in relation to
business progress will be discussed
by Professor Dowrie, who will de
scribe the two major objectives of
the present administration when it
took office in 1933, the restoration
of prosperity and the inauguration of
a program of socia Ireform.

length and retract nearly to its orig
inal length.
