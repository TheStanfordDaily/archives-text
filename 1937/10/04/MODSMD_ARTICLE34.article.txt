"ELEVATING READING"
FROM PUBLICITY MEN
Whether you are an ardent sports
fan or not, you'll probably find very
elevating reading in the mimeo
graphed masterpieces hatched in the
fertile minds of the country's various
collegiate publicity directors.
When football season rolls around
these demon publicity sharks are in
their finest fettle. After nine months
practice in other sports, they really
go at this gridiron publicity for the
dear old Alma Mammy in a big way.
The shining example in super
colorful writing (if you want to call
it that) comes from the Cal campus.
Wally Frederick, director of pub
licity for the Bears, really turned out
a piece of work that should go down
in the annals of great gridiron
writings.
WALLY FREDERICK'S
SHINING EXAMPLE
Wally wrote his little piece during
the Bear's spring practice last year.
The first two paragraphs should
bring smiles to the hps of even the
most hardened of publicity moguls.
They follow—
"Down in the corner of huge Ed
wards Field, 58 athletes in worn,
faded uniforms that bore some re
semblance to the common football
suit, charged like wild simian mon
sters against life-like canvas bags,
more readily identified in the jargon
of the trade as blocking dummies.
As an observer who had braved a
spring drizzle whispered to a com
panion, 4 so that is spring practice.'
"Yes, that is spring practice, and
although you and I don't read much
about it in the newspapers, it is the
basis for sweet dreams or continu
ous headaches through the long sum
mer months for almost every coach
of a major football team depending
obviously, of course, on how badly
scarred and viciously assaulted were
those same 48-pound, horse-hair
stuffed bags."
I think you'll probably agree with
me.
SHEETS OF SHEETS
FROM WASHINGTON STATE
A sheaf of mimeographed sheets
just arrived from Washington State.
Tne publicity shark up there must
have gotten his wires crossed —
here's what the first paragraph
started out to say:
"Prospects for Washington on Sep
tember 1 were for a potato crop of
8,750,000 bushels or & per cent larger
than a year ago ..." Sometimes
I wonder.
Ben Person, the Uclan, publicity
director, hands us some interesting
information. He discovered that
three of the seven most experienced
football coaches in the business are
at the helms of schools on the Pa
cific Coast.
Leading the list is Amos Alonzo
Stagg, member of the National Rules
Committee and coach at the College
of the Pacific. William (Bill) Spaul
ding of U.C.L.A.. and Howard Jones
of U.S.C. are also among the first
seven.
