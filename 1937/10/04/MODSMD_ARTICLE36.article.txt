# Week-end Battles Feature Powerhouse Plays
## Pigskin Tops Brought Low On Saturday Trojans Topple Before Huskies' Onslaught; Minnesota Humbled 
### HARRY PRESS 
Everything—almost, that is—turn
ed out just as the weisenheimers
predicted in this week-end's grid
titanics, and everybody—almost, that
is—filed out of the stadia and flip
ped off their radio in a very satisfied
manner.
A brainy and powerful team from
Washington managed to swipe all
the thunder that this year's edition
of the thundering herd was supposed
to have, leaving U.S.C. on the non
paying end of a 7-0 count.
With just a few more minutes in
the ball game, the story might be
different, but ball games never seem
to have those few more minutes.
That's why El Trojan is riding a very
dejected horse today.
Started Early
They started right in the first
quarter, did these Huskies. Turning
on the steam full blast, they took the
kick-off, plowed 65 yards in eight
plays. Troy got the ball, could do
nothing with it but fumble, and
quick like a flash the northern gen
tlemen were on it. What's more, they
were only 24 yards away from pay
off land.
Then the coast's most accurate
pass-flinger, Captain Fritz Wasko
witz, let fly one good for eight and
another for nine, which sorta set
Mr. Jones' boys back on their heels.
Into action boomed Messrs. Cruver
and Johnston, who had very little
trouble at all in smashing through
Ti-oy's forward wall to touchdown
land.
S.C. Comes Close
And that was the ball game, ex
cept for a very-near disaster to the
Huskies' machine in the closing
minutes of the game, when the Tro
jans began heaving passes all over
the place, with very good results.
That is. they were nearly very good,
'cause S.C. ended up on Washing
ton's eight with two downs to score.
But the play that landed Troy on
the eight took the last 30 seconds of
the game, and 70.000 people good and
true started breathing again.
It's beginning to look" as thbugh
Washington has a very steady, al
though none too potent, scoring
punch. And it's also looking as
though a certain southern team of
which one of the Jones boys is
head coach is decidedly over-rated.
Beaver Slaughter
Late news reports give indication
of a massacre over Berkeley way,
with the oh-so-highly touted Ore
gon Staters on the receiving end,
24-6. Said massacre was perpetrat
ed by a horde of Bears who let
nothing stop them except conver- !
sions—they made nary a one.
In every department of the game
the Cal gridders gave the Beavers a
heavy beating. It was just too bad
all around. Perhaps Stub Allison
has something there.
In Pullman, a powerful running
attack helped Washington State
slap a 13-0 decision on Idaho. Tight
defense gave Idaho little chance to
pull a last-minute win as it did
week before over Oregon State.
Champs Defeated
The mighty must fall, and Min- |
tiesota, heading for its fourth sUc- j
:essive mythical national grid cham- j
pionship, was rudely set back a few
lotches by Nebraska, 14-9. Fumbles
—two of them—spelled the defeat of
he strong Gophers, and the Corn
luskers quickly converted both of
hem into touchdown maneuvers. i
Minnesota scored first in nine fast !
}lays, and it looked as though the
rack meet was on. But a bobbled j
aunt in the second period led to Ne- |
Draska's score and conversion for a j
>ne-point lead. In the fourth period, !
he Gopher team moved out in front '
(gain with a field goal, only to see I
mother fumbled punt lead to two j
jasses, a touchdown, and a win for i
Nebraska.
