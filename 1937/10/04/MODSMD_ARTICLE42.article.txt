# Frosh Eleven Downs Bucks By 20-0 Score
## Modesto J. C. Gridders Dazzled by Passing Attack of Papooses 
### 
When Stanford's frosh gridders
swamped Modesto J.C. 20-0 here
Saturday, they showed questioning
spectators that they have the mak
ings of a real football team.
Particularly spectacular was the
passing attack developed last week
by Coach Harry Shipkey and dem
onstrated Saturday by his Papooses.
One of their three touchdowns came
directly as a result of a pass from
Thor Peterson to Jim Cudihy, and
another touchdown was indirectly
responsible to a series of passes
which advanced the ball down the
field within scoring distance.
Modesto kicked off, and in a very
short time Stanford was down on the
Modesto four-yard line. Modesto
gained the ball there, but they were
just postponing the inevitable. Be
cause shortly after that Stanford got
the ball again and marched down
the field from their own territory to
score. Fullback Norm Standlee
started things off by tossing several
short passes to his backs and ends,
putting the ball on Modesto's 45-
yard marker. Then Peterson got
loose for a nice run to the twelve.
From there Stanford edged the ball
down to the one-yard line, and
Standlee dived over for a touch
down. Standlee, who is the frosh
captain, converted.
Late in the second quarter, after
the frosh had again worked their
way deep into enemy territory, Pe
terson threw a long pass to Cudihy
for their second touchdown. Stand
lee again converted.
Stanford's last score came when
guard Bill Ruth caught a Modesto
fumble before it reached the ground
and raced 20 yards down the side
lines for a touchdown, making the
score 20-0 in Stanford's favor. The
attempted conversion failed.
