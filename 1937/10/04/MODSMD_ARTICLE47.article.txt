## "Room Service" for Memorial Hall 
### 
IT may resolve into the proverbial flash in the
pan and it may be nothing but the embryo
of a potential fizzle, but from this somewhat
crowded (the tryoutees are thick tonight) van
tage point in the green shack behind the Press
building has emerged an idea.
It goes thusly.
Operatives in and about the Stanford campus
having made their reports, it now seems quite
possible that the non-existent neon over Stan
ford's new Memorial Hall could flash the ap
pearance of such current road shows as Walter
Huston's "The Miles of Heaven" and the cur
rently popular "Room Service."
Such productions will enter Stanford as a
date on their books with exactly the same finan
cial arrangement used in their connection with
City showhouses, and under such an agree
ment the A.S.S.U. could bring legitimate shows
to the campus with a guarantee of the "take"
as the only lure.
Though this might be regarded as more of
a boot than a boost to Stanford drama, there is
the inevitable "other side." It is this.

Stanford now has a fine new theater filled
with reportedly soft seats. But such beautiful
red plush creations will probably be used only
one-tenth of the time, will grow ancient in ap
pearance long before their potential seating
powers are exhausted. Now Garver and Han
sen will tell you that to get "value received"
Stanford should use its fine, beautiful red plush
seats at every possible opportunity. Bringing
such shows to Stanford is that opportunity.
But further than that, our well-informed op
erative reports that the "take" on such shows
should be sufficient to take care of expenses
plus. Which would mean that it might be pos
sible for Stanford to fill its sock for the new
led plush that the seats will need when the
senior plates on the Quad turn the corner.
Not as full of holes as it may sound at first,
this idea, like the sponge, may hold water. Big
name entertainment, like big name orchestras,
might prove a very effective means for keeping
Stanford at home, and, incidentally, for getting
the greatest utility out of the finest college the
ater in the Westâ€”while it is still the finest.
