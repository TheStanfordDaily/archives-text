# The 						Play's the Thing

### 
IT would be a fine thing if Bobby Grayson
could play in the backfield of this year s var
sity. He would have been very useful in last
Saturday's game.
But that's not the way the game is played;
Grayson is an assistant coach now, a member of
the faculty.
They play a different game in the Department
of Speech and Drama. Though the general pur
pose is the same as it is in football, to train
players in a certain technical art, the * same
general rules do not hold.
Sometime near the end of this month, the
department will produce T. S. Eliot's "Murder
in the Cathedral," based on the events leading
up to the murder of Thomas a Becket, twelfth
century Archbishop of Canterbury. Dr. True
blood, University chaplain, will play a Becket,
the central and most important member of the
cast.
In effect Dr. Trueblood will call signals for
approximately ten other male players, secon
dary in importance to him. Women will speak
only in chorus in this drama of contrasting
rhythms.
Because Dr. Trueblood knows his ecclesiasti
cal history, knows the works of T. S. Eliot, and
has the background of a few thousand public
appearances, he will make a far finer Thomas
a Becket than could any student. He was
picked for these reasons, because Director
Lange believes no student could play the part.

In the Department of Speech and Drama, it
seems, faculty membership is no bar to partici
pation in a student production.
In football a play is sometimes built around
one man. If no man of similar talents turns up
on the next year's squad, the play is discarded.
In dramatics, it seems, they keep the play,
even if they have to use the coach. —L. L.
