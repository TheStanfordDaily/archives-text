EXIT THE SPIRITâ€”SHAKESPEARE
IF YOU should tap any college yell leader on the
shoulder and ask him for an explanation of the
lines in his forehead and the hollows in his cheeks, in
variably you would be told that "lack of school spirit"
is the reason. And if you could interrupt an old grad's
story of what he told the dean in '08 long enough to
ask him,what is wrong with universities today, you
would again hear the sad complaint, "no school
spirit."
To those who remember the glorious rows of yes
teryear when extroversion was in flower, and good
vocal cords were more to be valued than many fine
grade points, the present scene offers a depressing
picture. Rooting sections sit stoically while a football
shuttles up and down the field; torchlight parades be
gin half-heartedly and dissolve abruptly like a child
quieted by the silent disapproval of its elders. There
are about as many evidences of school spirit on the
average campus as there are evidences of chicken in
drugstore chicken salad.

And amid these deserts of apparent apathy,
Stanford oilers no green oasis of enthusiasm. Last Fri
day's rally was judged one of the better, but yell leader
Ransohoff found that the rooters still had difficulty
counting up to six rahs. Many cheers got under way as
slowly as Ex Committee legislation, and faded out into
a ragged splatter of feeble clapping.
At the dedication of Memorial Hall we were ex
horted to sing the anthem lustily, "louder than ever
before." And we mumbled softly into our collective
beard, each man trying to follow his neighbor and
wondering whether "Alma Mater" or "Hail" came
first.

1 F we assume that willingness to tear out a lung for
dear alma mater is the only valid evidence of
"school spirit," we must conclude that the spirit is
going to join the vanished bustle and stand-up collar.
This trend has been deplored for several college gen
erations by journalists and commentators; and the bales
of pleading editorials for a monument to the futility
of trying to create synthetic enthusiasm.
But the fact that students no longer enjoy making
noises like a lioness whose cubs are getting a rough
deal does not mean that the universities are unloved
and unhonored. Doleful commentators to the contrary,
a ragged cheering section is not prima facie evidence
of approaching dissolution and damnation.

It is possible to love dear alma mater without bleat
ing about it. It is possible to revere our university
and our institutions without shouting the cough drop
companies into an extra dividend. I
The average student today feels the same way about
his college that his forebears did. He is simply less
ostentatious about it. The very exuberance of the pre
ceding generation has made this one more reserved and
quiet.
And so when the rooting section bogs down in the
midst of a cheer or falters in the anthem, we need not
feel like calloused brutes and unfaithful sons. It is
about time we reconciled ourselves to the fact that
students today prefer to worship the goddess of wis
dom in quieter ways.
