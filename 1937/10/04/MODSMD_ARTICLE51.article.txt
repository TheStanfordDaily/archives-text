TV"OW THAT the students are singing the Battle Hymn
of the University on the way to classes, the Dee
Gees report the first fire trouble of the year.
Early one evening recently, the semi-settled Dee
Gees were alarmed by the odor of smoke which per
meated their domicile. After elaborate investigation,
it was decided by council that it came from ,the base
ment, where the dust was hot. On seeing no evidences
of flame, however, nothing startling was done. They
went to bed.
When the China Boy came in the morning, firmly
believing in the axiom: where there's smoke, there's
fire, he called the fire department.
Rudely awakened in the morning slumber, Dee Gees
came down in curl papers, listening to sii'ens and gongs
and remarking to themselves: "The Sigma Chis are
back, I guess."
Then their driveway was cluttered with fire equip
ment, and they realized they, themselves, were the fire.
CINCE school has started, minor excitements and in
juries have been cluttering up the Men's Health
Service. Most remarkable incident of all was the time
a snake crawled (rolled, wiggled) out of one A.K.L.'s
golf bag and bit another (A.K.L.).
Suspecting the bite was poisonous, the young gen
tleman was rushed to the 8.A.C., there to receive treat
ment for the wounds inflicted. On arriving, the said
gentlemen were gently rebuked for not bringing the
snake with them, so they decided it wasn't poisonous,
went back and caught it, and it's on the clothesline at
the A.K.L. house now, 25 cents a peek.
Another man, Toyon by naturalization, meeting the
President of our University on the campus, and re
cieving a courteous "Good afternoon" by way of greet
ing, replied in the customary campus manner: "Hi!"
The Hello-on-the-Quad's greatest day.
pRESHMEN, cautioned about trying to remember
names, are apt to exaggerate the importance of the
warning. One young chappie was so serious about the
situation that, meeting girls at the jolly-up Saturday,
he tried every possible means of remembering the
names of the dear ladies. Stymied at every attempt,
he finally succeeded in learning the name of a girl
called Smith, who, it seems, was very attractive. But
to his grief, he found later that, concentrating on
names, he had forgotten to remember what the girl
looked like.
