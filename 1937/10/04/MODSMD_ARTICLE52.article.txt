# CAMPUS OPINION
## DR. WILBUR'S ADDRESS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Throughout Dr. Wilbur's address
last Thursday there ran one rather
disturbing refrain. "We have just
begun," he said; and again, "Stan
ford has just begun to grow." And
he cited the three hundred and fifty
years of Harvard as a goal at which
to aim.
At first I thought that he meant
growth in the sense of mental rather
than physical growth; but presently
as he went on it became clear that
he too is chasing the will-o'-the
wisp which has lately, under the
suavely inefficient tutelage of the
legendary Mr. Roth, begun to in
trigue the Board of Trustees. And
the comparison with Harvard began
to seem rather pointless.
As he talked, visions of the pro
posed Stanford began to assume
chimerical proportions in my mind.
A subsidiary Quad between Encina
and the Libe. Another between the
Quad and Sequoia. An ever-increas
ing burden of growth which the
University is not wholly equipped to
meet, and which the original spirit
of the University does not want.
The building budget steadily rising
as the caliber of the faculty steadily
declines. The Harvard of the West
losing even that faintly contemptu
ous title as it becomes more and
more a collection of pretty buildings
and inferior educators. The Stanford
Family trying to bring the big city
to the Farm.
I have been only two years at
Stanford, yet even in that short
time there has been a perceptible
loss of what one calls, for want of
a better term, "Stanford atmos
phere." A certain spaciousness,
due to the comparatively small
number of students and the com
paratively secluded situation of
the University, a certain friendly
and leisurely attitude, is already
beginning to vanish. And it will
vanish more and more rapidly as
the University grows.
The comparison with Harvard, I
think, was unfortunate. Certainly
Harvard has not devoted its energies
to plastering both sides of the
Charles wtih sandstone white ele
phants. Harvard has never forgot
ten that the purpose of a university
is learning. To that end it has called
to its halls such men as Elliott,
Kittredge, Santayana, Bliss Perry,
George Pierce Baker. By adhering
to that ideal it has risen to top rank
ing among the universities of the
world. On that basis it has achieved
true greatness. In that way it has
become Harvard.
Stanford today ranks far below its
contemporaries in America. I do
not know its exact status, the last
time I saw the figures I believe it
was twelfth in national standing.
That was over two years ago, and
today it may be lower. You may ar
gue that twelfth is scarcely low
enough to worry about; but to those
who like their university and want
to see it first, twelfth seems low in
deed; and to those who have seen
more than a few fine educators
leave for more lucrative posts,
twelfth seems a melancholy indica
tion of what the next few years may
bring.
I do not criticize the building of
the Memorial Theater. It is only fit
ting that the University should have
a public gathering place worthy of
it. I think the Memorial Theater is,
and I am glad it has finally been
built. Nor do I criticize the Cub
berley Education Building, except
that its site might have been chosen
with more regard to the symmetry of
Quad and Library.
What I do criticize, and what I
feel is endangering this Univer
sity as a place of learning more
than anything else, is the impa
tient and improvident attitude
which refuses to build within the
framework of what we already
have, and turns instead to putting
up more buildings and more
buildings, without thought for the
University's original spirit and its
preservation.
With all respect to Mr. Roth as a
charming gentleman—which he must
be, since the names of skeptical
Daily reporters who have gone to
sneer and come away to write what
seem to me unjustified tributes, is
legion—l do not think his influence
on the University has been a good
one, and I am glad it has been re
moved. No doubt he is a genius at
extracting donations from wealthy
alumni and amphitheaters from be- I
reaved parents; but the incident of
the faulty pavement in front of the !

theater which had to be torn up
and replaced seems just a little too
typical to make me believe in the
Great Legend. Nor, as I am trying
to indicate, do I believe in what the
Great Legend stood for.
We have at Stanford classrooms
throughout the Quad which re
semble some of the more luxurious
monastery cells of the Middle Ages.
Narrow windows, set in walls
whose thickness would have done
credit to a Renaissance castle, cast
a dingy and inadequate light into
rooms which are uniformly un
conducive to interest and concen
tration. Heating systems are
faulty, in many cases of no use
whatsoever. Nothing is done for
the comfort of students and fac
ulty.
We have streets that lie much
farther back in horse-and-buggy
days than the minds and philosophies
of certain of our administrative
officers.
We have many departments so
cramped and crowded that they are
unable to carry on adequately their
work and duties. I am fully aware
that this last is one of the main rea
sons for undertaking additions to the
physical structure of the University.
But before I started on a haphazard
and ill-advised building campaign, I
would see what could be done with
the Quad as it stands.
I would modernize as much as
possible what now exists. I would
tear out the walls and floors and
windows which have been here for
50 years and replace them with
woodwork of a shade light enough
to take the increased illumination
it would receive from new and
larger windows set flush with the
stone.
I would pave and widen streets
which are much too narrow and un
even for safe and comfortable travel.

I would modernize and enlarge many
of the departments, eliminating
needless hall space and needless
rooms. I would limit my registra
tion to four thousand and hold it
at four thousand, come hell and high
water, or Mr. Roth, or any other
catastrophe.
Lastly and above all, I would
concentrate on the task of adding
to my faculty men and women
standing at the top of their re
spective fields of learning. 1 would
concentrate on making this the
truly great University it poten
tially is.
Then, and only then, would I be
gin to think of new Quads here and
new Quads there, and a physical
plant equalling the University of
Chicago. What extra buildings are
absolutely essential I would build,
but I would not do what the present
administration is doing.
I would not start the seventy
sixth floor before I had finished the
foundation. I would not lament the
passing of the unique spirit of Stan
ford out of one side of my mouth
and give orders to hasten that pass
ing out of the other side.
Justice Brandeis once wrote a
book which he called "The Curse of
Bigness." Monopolies, that was
about. But monopolies are not the
only things which can destroy
themselves with that curse. A uni
veisity can, too. And when it does,
it may perhaps be a superb plant,
but it will no longer be a univer
sity.
More important to those who love
it, it will no longer be the Stanford
F arm.

That was over two years ago, and
today it may be lower. You may ar
gue that twelfth is scarcely low
enough to worry about; but to those
who like their university and want
to see it first, twelfth seems low in
deed; and to those who have seen
more than a few fine educators
leave for more lucrative posts,
twelfth seems a melancholy indica
tion of what the next few years may
bring.
I do not criticize the building of
the Memorial Theater. It is only fit
ting that the University should have
a public gathering place worthy of
it. I think the Memorial Theater is,
and I am glad it has finally been
built. Nor do I criticize the Cub
berley Education Building, except
that its site might have been chosen
with more regard to the symmetry of
Quad and Library.
What I do criticize, and what I
feel is endangering this Univer
sity as a place of learning more
than anything else, is the impa
tient and improvident attitude
which refuses to build within the
framework of what we already
have, and turns instead to putting
up more buildings and more
buildings, without thought for the
University's original spirit and its
preservation.
With all respect to Mr. Roth as a
charming gentleman—which he must
be, since the names of skeptical
Daily reporters who have gone to
sneer and come away to write what
seem to me unjustified tributes, is
legion—l do not think his influence
on the University has been a good
one, and I am glad it has been re
moved. No doubt he is a genius at
extracting donations from wealthy
alumni and amphitheaters from be- I
reaved parents; but the incident of
the faulty pavement in front of the !

theater which had to be torn up
and replaced seems just a little too
typical to make me believe in the
Great Legend. Nor, as I am trying
to indicate, do I believe in what the
Great Legend stood for.
We have at Stanford classrooms
throughout the Quad which re
semble some of the more luxurious
monastery cells of the Middle Ages.
Narrow windows, set in walls
whose thickness would have done
credit to a Renaissance castle, cast
a dingy and inadequate light into
rooms which are uniformly un
conducive to interest and concen
tration. Heating systems are
faulty, in many cases of no use
whatsoever. Nothing is done for
the comfort of students and fac
ulty.
We have streets that lie much
farther back in horse-and-buggy
days than the minds and philosophies
of certain of our administrative
officers.
We have many departments so
cramped and crowded that they are
unable to carry on adequately their
work and duties. I am fully aware
that this last is one of the main rea
sons for undertaking additions to the
physical structure of the University.
But before I started on a haphazard
and ill-advised building campaign, I
would see what could be done with
the Quad as it stands.
I would modernize as much as
possible what now exists. I would
tear out the walls and floors and
windows which have been here for
50 years and replace them with
woodwork of a shade light enough
to take the increased illumination
it would receive from new and
larger windows set flush with the
stone.
I would pave and widen streets
which are much too narrow and un
even for safe and comfortable travel.

I would modernize and enlarge many
of the departments, eliminating
needless hall space and needless
rooms. I would limit my registra
tion to four thousand and hold it
at four thousand, come hell and high
water, or Mr. Roth, or any other
catastrophe.
Lastly and above all, I would
concentrate on the task of adding
to my faculty men and women
standing at the top of their re
spective fields of learning. 1 would
concentrate on making this the
truly great University it poten
tially is.
Then, and only then, would I be
gin to think of new Quads here and
new Quads there, and a physical
plant equalling the University of
Chicago. What extra buildings are
absolutely essential I would build,
but I would not do what the present
administration is doing.
I would not start the seventy
sixth floor before I had finished the
foundation. I would not lament the
passing of the unique spirit of Stan
ford out of one side of my mouth
and give orders to hasten that pass
ing out of the other side.
Justice Brandeis once wrote a
book which he called "The Curse of
Bigness." Monopolies, that was
about. But monopolies are not the
only things which can destroy
themselves with that curse. A uni
veisity can, too. And when it does,
it may perhaps be a superb plant,
but it will no longer be a univer
sity.
More important to those who love
it, it will no longer be the Stanford
F arm.

The Editor, Sir:
Throughout Dr. Wilbur's address
last Thursday there ran one rather
disturbing refrain. "We have just
begun," he said; and again, "Stan
ford has just begun to grow." And
he cited the three hundred and fifty
years of Harvard as a goal at which
to aim.
At first I thought that he meant
growth in the sense of mental rather
than physical growth; but presently
as he went on it became clear that
he too is chasing the will-o'-the
wisp which has lately, under the
suavely inefficient tutelage of the
legendary Mr. Roth, begun to in
trigue the Board of Trustees. And
the comparison with Harvard began
to seem rather pointless.
As he talked, visions of the pro
posed Stanford began to assume
chimerical proportions in my mind.
A subsidiary Quad between Encina
and the Libe. Another between the
Quad and Sequoia. An ever-increas
ing burden of growth which the
University is not wholly equipped to
meet, and which the original spirit
of the University does not want.
The building budget steadily rising
as the caliber of the faculty steadily
declines. The Harvard of the West
losing even that faintly contemptu
ous title as it becomes more and
more a collection of pretty buildings
and inferior educators. The Stanford
Family trying to bring the big city
to the Farm.
I have been only two years at
Stanford, yet even in that short
time there has been a perceptible
loss of what one calls, for want of
a better term, "Stanford atmos
phere." A certain spaciousness,
due to the comparatively small
number of students and the com
paratively secluded situation of
the University, a certain friendly
and leisurely attitude, is already
beginning to vanish. And it will
vanish more and more rapidly as
the University grows.
The comparison with Harvard, I
think, was unfortunate. Certainly
Harvard has not devoted its energies
to plastering both sides of the
Charles wtih sandstone white ele
phants. Harvard has never forgot
ten that the purpose of a university
is learning. To that end it has called
to its halls such men as Elliott,
Kittredge, Santayana, Bliss Perry,
George Pierce Baker. By adhering
to that ideal it has risen to top rank
ing among the universities of the
world. On that basis it has achieved
true greatness. In that way it has
become Harvard.
Stanford today ranks far below its
contemporaries in America. I do
not know its exact status, the last
time I saw the figures I believe it
was twelfth in national standing.
That was over two years ago, and
today it may be lower. You may ar

cramped and crowded that they are
unable to carry on adequately their
work and duties. I am fully aware
that this last is one of the main rea
sons for undertaking additions to the
physical structure of the University.
But before I started on a haphazard
and ill-advised building campaign, I
would see what could be done with
the Quad as it stands.
I would modernize as much as
possible what now exists. I would
tear out the walls and floors and
windows which have been here for
50 years and replace them with
woodwork of a shade light enough
to take the increased illumination
it would receive from new and
larger windows set flush with the
stone.
I would pave and widen streets
which are much too narrow and un
even for safe and comfortable travel.

I would modernize and enlarge many
of the departments, eliminating
needless hall space and needless
rooms. I would limit my registra
tion to four thousand and hold it
at four thousand, come hell and high
water, or Mr. Roth, or any other
catastrophe.
Lastly and above all, I would
concentrate on the task of adding
to my faculty men and women
standing at the top of their re
spective fields of learning. 1 would
concentrate on making this the
truly great University it poten
tially is.
Then, and only then, would I be
gin to think of new Quads here and
new Quads there, and a physical
plant equalling the University of
Chicago. What extra buildings are
absolutely essential I would build,
but I would not do what the present
administration is doing.
I would not start the seventy
sixth floor before I had finished the
foundation. I would not lament the
passing of the unique spirit of Stan
ford out of one side of my mouth
and give orders to hasten that pass
ing out of the other side.
Justice Brandeis once wrote a
book which he called "The Curse of
Bigness." Monopolies, that was
about. But monopolies are not the
only things which can destroy
themselves with that curse. A uni
veisity can, too. And when it does,
it may perhaps be a superb plant,
but it will no longer be a univer
sity.
More important to those who love
it, it will no longer be the Stanford
F arm.
Cope
The Editor, Sir:
Throughout Dr. Wilbur's address
last Thursday there ran one rather
disturbing refrain. "We have just
begun," he said; and again, "Stan
ford has just begun to grow." And
he cited the three hundred and fifty
years of Harvard as a goal at which
to aim.
At first I thought that he meant
growth in the sense of mental rather
than physical growth; but presently
as he went on it became clear that
he too is chasing the will-o'-the
wisp which has lately, under the
suavely inefficient tutelage of the
legendary Mr. Roth, begun to in
trigue the Board of Trustees. And
the comparison with Harvard began
to seem rather pointless.
As he talked, visions of the pro
posed Stanford began to assume
chimerical proportions in my mind.
A subsidiary Quad between Encina
and the Libe. Another between the
Quad and Sequoia. An ever-increas
ing burden of growth which the
University is not wholly equipped to
meet, and which the original spirit
of the University does not want.
The building budget steadily rising
as the caliber of the faculty steadily
declines. The Harvard of the West
losing even that faintly contemptu
ous title as it becomes more and
more a collection of pretty buildings
and inferior educators. The Stanford
Family trying to bring the big city
to the Farm.
I have been only two years at
Stanford, yet even in that short
time there has been a perceptible
loss of what one calls, for want of
a better term, "Stanford atmos
phere." A certain spaciousness,
due to the comparatively small
number of students and the com
paratively secluded situation of
the University, a certain friendly
and leisurely attitude, is already
beginning to vanish. And it will
vanish more and more rapidly as
the University grows.
The comparison with Harvard, I
think, was unfortunate. Certainly
Harvard has not devoted its energies
to plastering both sides of the
Charles wtih sandstone white ele
phants. Harvard has never forgot
ten that the purpose of a university
is learning. To that end it has called
to its halls such men as Elliott,
Kittredge, Santayana, Bliss Perry,
George Pierce Baker. By adhering
to that ideal it has risen to top rank
ing among the universities of the
world. On that basis it has achieved
true greatness. In that way it has
become Harvard.
Stanford today ranks far below its
contemporaries in America. I do
not know its exact status, the last
time I saw the figures I believe it
was twelfth in national standing.
That was over two years ago, and
today it may be lower. You may ar
gue that twelfth is scarcely low
enough to worry about; but to those
who like their university and want
to see it first, twelfth seems low in
deed; and to those who have seen
more than a few fine educators
leave for more lucrative posts,
twelfth seems a melancholy indica
tion of what the next few years may
bring.
I do not criticize the building of
the Memorial Theater. It is only fit
ting that the University should have
a public gathering place worthy of
it. I think the Memorial Theater is,
and I am glad it has finally been
built. Nor do I criticize the Cub
berley Education Building, except
that its site might have been chosen
with more regard to the symmetry of
Quad and Library.
What I do criticize, and what I
feel is endangering this Univer
sity as a place of learning more
than anything else, is the impa
tient and improvident attitude
which refuses to build within the
framework of what we already
have, and turns instead to putting
up more buildings and more
buildings, without thought for the
University's original spirit and its
preservation.
With all respect to Mr. Roth as a
charming gentleman—which he must
be, since the names of skeptical
Daily reporters who have gone to
sneer and come away to write what
seem to me unjustified tributes, is
legion—l do not think his influence
on the University has been a good
one, and I am glad it has been re
moved. No doubt he is a genius at
extracting donations from wealthy
alumni and amphitheaters from be- I
reaved parents; but the incident of
the faulty pavement in front of the !

theater which had to be torn up
and replaced seems just a little too
typical to make me believe in the
Great Legend. Nor, as I am trying
to indicate, do I believe in what the
Great Legend stood for.
We have at Stanford classrooms
throughout the Quad which re
semble some of the more luxurious
monastery cells of the Middle Ages.
Narrow windows, set in walls
whose thickness would have done
credit to a Renaissance castle, cast
a dingy and inadequate light into
rooms which are uniformly un
conducive to interest and concen
tration. Heating systems are
faulty, in many cases of no use
whatsoever. Nothing is done for
the comfort of students and fac
ulty.
We have streets that lie much
farther back in horse-and-buggy
days than the minds and philosophies
of certain of our administrative
officers.

cramped and crowded that they are

to aim.
At first I thought that he meant
growth in the sense of mental rather
than physical growth; but presently
as he went on it became clear that
he too is chasing the will-o'-the
wisp which has lately, under the
suavely inefficient tutelage of the
legendary Mr. Roth, begun to in
trigue the Board of Trustees. And
the comparison with Harvard began
to seem rather pointless.
As he talked, visions of the pro
posed Stanford began to assume
chimerical proportions in my mind.
A subsidiary Quad between Encina
and the Libe. Another between the
Quad and Sequoia. An ever-increas
ing burden of growth which the
University is not wholly equipped to
meet, and which the original spirit
of the University does not want.
The building budget steadily rising
as the caliber of the faculty steadily
declines. The Harvard of the West
losing even that faintly contemptu
ous title as it becomes more and
more a collection of pretty buildings
and inferior educators. The Stanford
Family trying to bring the big city
to the Farm.
I have been only two years at
Stanford, yet even in that short
time there has been a perceptible
loss of what one calls, for want of
a better term, "Stanford atmos
phere." A certain spaciousness,
due to the comparatively small
number of students and the com
paratively secluded situation of
the University, a certain friendly
and leisurely attitude, is already
beginning to vanish. And it will
vanish more and more rapidly as
the University grows.
The comparison with Harvard, I
think, was unfortunate. Certainly
Harvard has not devoted its energies
to plastering both sides of the
Charles wtih sandstone white ele
phants. Harvard has never forgot
ten that the purpose of a university
is learning. To that end it has called
to its halls such men as Elliott,
Kittredge, Santayana, Bliss Perry,
George Pierce Baker. By adhering
to that ideal it has risen to top rank
ing among the universities of the
world. On that basis it has achieved
true greatness. In that way it has
become Harvard.
Stanford today ranks far below its
contemporaries in America. I do
not know its exact status, the last
time I saw the figures I believe it
was twelfth in national standing.
That was over two years ago, and
today it may be lower. You may ar
gue that twelfth is scarcely low
enough to worry about; but to those
who like their university and want
to see it first, twelfth seems low in
deed; and to those who have seen
more than a few fine educators
leave for more lucrative posts,
twelfth seems a melancholy indica
tion of what the next few years may
bring.
I do not criticize the building of
the Memorial Theater. It is only fit
ting that the University should have
a public gathering place worthy of
it. I think the Memorial Theater is,
and I am glad it has finally been
built. Nor do I criticize the Cub
berley Education Building, except
that its site might have been chosen
with more regard to the symmetry of
Quad and Library.
What I do criticize, and what I
feel is endangering this Univer
sity as a place of learning more
than anything else, is the impa
tient and improvident attitude
which refuses to build within the
framework of what we already
have, and turns instead to putting
up more buildings and more
buildings, without thought for the
University's original spirit and its
preservation.
With all respect to Mr. Roth as a
charming gentleman—which he must
be, since the names of skeptical
Daily reporters who have gone to
sneer and come away to write what
seem to me unjustified tributes, is
legion—l do not think his influence
on the University has been a good
one, and I am glad it has been re
moved. No doubt he is a genius at
extracting donations from wealthy
alumni and amphitheaters from be- I
reaved parents; but the incident of
the faulty pavement in front of the !

theater which had to be torn up
and replaced seems just a little too
typical to make me believe in the
Great Legend. Nor, as I am trying
to indicate, do I believe in what the
Great Legend stood for.
We have at Stanford classrooms
throughout the Quad which re
semble some of the more luxurious
monastery cells of the Middle Ages.
Narrow windows, set in walls
whose thickness would have done
credit to a Renaissance castle, cast
a dingy and inadequate light into
rooms which are uniformly un
conducive to interest and concen
tration. Heating systems are
faulty, in many cases of no use
whatsoever. Nothing is done for
the comfort of students and fac
ulty.
We have streets that lie much
farther back in horse-and-buggy
days than the minds and philosophies
of certain of our administrative
officers.
We have many departments so
cramped and crowded that they are
unable to carry on adequately their
work and duties. I am fully aware
that this last is one of the main rea
sons for undertaking additions to the
physical structure of the University.
But before I started on a haphazard
and ill-advised building campaign, I
would see what could be done with
the Quad as it stands.
I would modernize as much as
possible what now exists. I would
tear out the walls and floors and
windows which have been here for
50 years and replace them with
woodwork of a shade light enough
to take the increased illumination
it would receive from new and
larger windows set flush with the
stone.
I would pave and widen streets
which are much too narrow and un
even for safe and comfortable travel.

I would modernize and enlarge many
of the departments, eliminating
needless hall space and needless
rooms. I would limit my registra
tion to four thousand and hold it
at four thousand, come hell and high
water, or Mr. Roth, or any other
catastrophe.
Lastly and above all, I would
concentrate on the task of adding
to my faculty men and women
standing at the top of their re
spective fields of learning. 1 would
concentrate on making this the
truly great University it poten
tially is.
Then, and only then, would I be
gin to think of new Quads here and
new Quads there, and a physical
plant equalling the University of
Chicago. What extra buildings are
absolutely essential I would build,
but I would not do what the present
administration is doing.
I would not start the seventy
sixth floor before I had finished the
foundation. I would not lament the
passing of the unique spirit of Stan
ford out of one side of my mouth
and give orders to hasten that pass
ing out of the other side.
Justice Brandeis once wrote a
book which he called "The Curse of
Bigness." Monopolies, that was
about. But monopolies are not the
only things which can destroy
themselves with that curse. A uni
veisity can, too. And when it does,
it may perhaps be a superb plant,
but it will no longer be a univer
sity.
More important to those who love
it, it will no longer be the Stanford
F arm.

Throughout Dr. Wilbur's address
last Thursday there ran one rather
disturbing refrain. "We have just
begun," he said; and again, "Stan
ford has just begun to grow." And
he cited the three hundred and fifty
years of Harvard as a goal at which
to aim.
