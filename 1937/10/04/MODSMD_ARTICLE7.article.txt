# Expulsion Of C.I.O. Unions Is Predicted
## Executive Council May Revoke Charters Of Ten Member Unions 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 3 (U.R).â€”'The ex
ecutive council of the American
Federation of Labor tonight recom
mended to the annual federation
convention, opening tomorrow, that
it be granted authority to revoke
the charters of 10 suspended unions
affiliated with the Committee for In
dustrial Organization.
"The time has arrived," the council
said, "when the A. F. of L. must
meet the issue created ... in a clear
cut and positive way."
Revision Planned
In addition the report, which cus
tomarily sets the lines of federation
policy, endorsed a series of amend
ments to the organization's consti
tution which would, in effect,
streamline it for swift l'eprisals
against any further internal disaf
fections. These request broad new
powers for both the council and the
president.
It was generally believed the joint
proposals would be adopted. If ap
proval is granted, the council will be
in a position to oust one or all of the
"rebel" units at its meeting imme
diately following the yearly convo
cation.
"War Chest" Dues
In addition to suggesting a thor
ough upholstering of the federation's
governing machinery, the council
asked continuation of a special
monthly per capita assessment of one
cent in order to build up a "war
chest" to fight John L. Lewis.
It called for a sweeping unioniza
tion drive both among unorganized
workers and among those now
banded behind the Lewis move
ment. President William Green has
already indicated that new loyal
unions will be set up in each of the
fields where charters were aban
doned by the C.1.0. insurrection.
