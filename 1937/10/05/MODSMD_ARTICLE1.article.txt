# Objections Filed As Black Takes Seat on Tribunal
## Two Attorneys Initiate Action To Oust Associate Justice from Bench 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (UP).—Justice Hugo L. Black sat for the first
time on the Supreme Court bench today as Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes rebuked a lawyer who came as close to interrupting the solemnity
of Opening day as is possible in the austere tribunal.
In a 23-minute session devoted mostly to admission of new members of
the bar, the court placed under advisement two motions challenging Black's

right to his seat, and recessed unti
next Monday noon. The challenge:
were:
Judge Petitions
1. A petition by Albert Levitt
former U. S. District judge for th(
Virgin Islands and former assistan
attorney general, asking the court tc
entertain an original suit seekini
to oust Black on the ground that n<
vacancy exists for him to fill, anc
that even if there were, Black, as ;
former Senator, would not be' eli
gible.
2. A request by Patrick Henrj
Kelly, Boston attorney, for "a hear
ing on the title of Mr. Justice Blacl
to sit on this court."
Crowd Attracted
The controversy over Black's
former membership in the Ku Klu>
Klan, which he avowed in a radic
speech Friday night, attracted one
of the largest crowds in history. Only
500 could be jammed into the courl
room so hundreds stood outside.
When all were seated Hughes an
nounced:
"Hugo L. Black of Alabama, £
former member of the Senate of the
United States, has been nominated
by the president for the office oi
Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. He has been confirmed by
the Senate and has presented his
commission. He has heretofore tak
en the oath in the form provided by
law."
Without the slightest pause Hughes
went on:
Bar Applicants
"Are there any applications for
admission to the bar?"
Clerk Charles Elmore Cropley
read some names and a group of
lawyers gathered in front of the
bench. Their sponsor assured the
court of their qualifications and
Hughes said:
"You may pass to the clerk's desk
to take the oath."
Kelly, a small thin man, inter
rupted at this point to ask a ques
tion. Hughes ruled him out of or
der. After applicants had taken their
oaths, Kelly rose again and star-ted
to talk. Hughes told him to put it
in writing. After Kelly had done
this, and Levitt had submitted his
written petition, Hughes announced
a week's recess and the justices filed
out, ending Black's first day on the
nation's highest bench.
