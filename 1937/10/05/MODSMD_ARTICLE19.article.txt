# Frosh Eat on "Assembly Line" As Papoose Hashers Go South
## 
### 
"Assembly line" meals probably
will be served at Encina Commons
next Friday night and all day Sat
urday, because 20 of Encina's 27
hashers will be in Los Angeles for
the Papooses' game with U.S.C.
Cafeteria - style meals have been
the solution to the problem for the
past two Saturday lunches, when the
frosh were playing football. The
same plan is being considered for
the four meals next weekend, ac
cording to Christine Ricker, direc
tor of the Stanford Union.
This is the first quarter that this
problem has arisen, since no meals
were served on Saturday in past
years, Sunday meals being served
instead.
It takes only 12 minutes for the
depleted crew to serve the 350 to 400
frosh who attend the meal. This is
only slightly longer than it takes to
serve an ordinary meal up to the
dessert course.
Self-service Saturday lunches are
scheduled to continue through No
vember 6.
