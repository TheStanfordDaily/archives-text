# Dramatic Set Up Heads Business Of Ex Committee
## Group Will Pass Upon Proposal Tonight At First Session of Quarter 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Ex Committee will consider the fate of Stanford's new dramatic society
at its first meeting of the quarter at 7:15 o'clock tonight.
Up for approval before the Farm's governing body will be the resolu
tion dissolving Sword and Sandals, Masquers, Rams Head, and Barnstorm
ers and amalgamating their membership into one organization; the chartcr

â–ºand the constitution of the new so
ciety; the group's proposal to re
organize Dramatic Council; and the
Dramatic Council charter, revised to
fit the new set-up by Dramatic Man
ager Clay McDaniel.
Wilbur Approves
President Ray Lyman Wilbur ap
proved the latter two drafts in gen
eral terms yesterday with sugges
tions for changes and additions. Dr.
Wilbur expressed the opinion that
"the organization of the new group
should not be too solid and too firm
at first."
Ex Committee is expected to pass
the resolution creating the new so
ciety, according to Bud Cady, presi
dent of the now extinct Barnstorm
ers, who presided at last Friday's
meeting which dissolved the old
dramatic groups. A.S.S.U. President
Tom Killifer has intimated his ap
proval of the plan and his convic
tion that it wlil experience no diffi
culty in passing the executive body.
Committee to Investigate
Killifer will probably appoint a
committee at tonight's meeting to
investigate, discuss, and approve the
charter and constitution of the new
society, its proposed reorganization
of Dramatic Council, and the revised
Council charter. Voting on these
measures is expected to be post
poned until next week.
Special Election
Other business to go before Ex
Committee tonight includes provi
sion for a special election to fill the
position of graduate member. Joe
Weiner, elected to hold the position
through winter quarter, will not re
turn to school because he has gone
into business in San Francisco.
Exchange scholarships with Ox
ford, Cambridge, Heidelburg, the
Sorbonne, the University of Mun
ich, the University of Vienna
will be discussed. President Killifer
received the necessary approval of
the officials at each of these institu
tions during his European trip this
summer, and Dr. Wilbur has sanc
tioned the plan.
Exchanges Planned
Only detail remaining to be ironed
out is the matter of the financing
of the exchanges; they will cost
Stanford considerably more than
they will the European schools.
Plans for a jolly-up sponsored by
the sophomore class followed by a
rally for the U.C.L.A. game are ex
pected to be ratified. If Joe E.
Brown, movie comedian, can be a
guest at the rally, it will be held
Friday afternoon. Otehrwise it will
be scheduled for Thursday evening
at 7 o'clock.
