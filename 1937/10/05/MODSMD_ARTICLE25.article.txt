# Drastic Cut To Be Made In NYA Funds
## Ex Committee May Join Campaign To Pledge 50 Pet. Reduction 
### 
The recently announced 45 per
cent cut in the National Youth Act
appropriation has resulted in a
drastic decrease in NYA funds
available for use at Stanford, Uni
versity Registrar J. P. Mitchell said
yesterday.
Approximately $39,000 has been
granted for use here during this
school year, which represents a de
cline of slightly more than 50 per
cent from the 1936-37 allotment of
nearly $79,000, Mitchell declared.
National Funds Cut
Nationally, NYA funds were cut
by executive order from $75,000,000
to $45,000,000. Ex Committee at its
meeting tonight will consider pro
posals to join in a campaign for the
restoration of this cut in funds.
Chief supporter of the proposed cam
paign is the National-Student Fed
eration of America, student body
organization with which the A.S.S.U.
is affiliated.
While more than 475 students
worked on NYA projects here last
year, authorities believe that under
the reduced budget it will be pos
sible to employ less than 300.
Fewer Helped
Last year's appropriation was
planned for aiding 12 per cent of
all students enrolled, while this
year's grant will aid only 8 per cent
of the students under 25 years of
age.
Although he declined to comment
on any possible campaign to restore
the NYA appropriation, Registrar
Mitchell pointed out that the NYA
was established to take care of an
emergency, and that "it was not
planned as a permanent organiza
tion."
"This year there is more regular
work available in Palo Alto than in
the past," Mitchell stated. The work
of the Appointment Bureau and the
Student Employment Service "should
make it possible to take care of all
students who really need part-time
employment," he concluded.
