# F.D.R. Places Crop Control, Wages on List
## President May Call Next Special Session For 'Normal Granary' 
### 
ST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 4 (UP).—
President Roosevelt placed two
pieces of major legislation—control
of surplus crops for farmers and
minimum wages for workers—at the
top of his "must" list for the next
session of Congress as he paused
here tonight for a brief speech en
route home from the Pacific North
west.
Earlier today, the president broad
ly hinted that he would call the Sen
ate and House into special session
this fall to pass a law to provide
the country with "an ever-normal
granary" of wheat, cotton, and
other agricultural products.
Hint Disregarded
Mr. Roosevelt disregarded his hint
tonight, but emphasized in an ad
dress bristling with "musts" that his
administration would fight for a
crop control bill and a measure es
tablishing minimum wages and
maximum hours with anti-child
labor provisions.
"As a result of both of these," the
president said, "the actual cost of
relief for the unemployed should in
crease, and existing taxes — not
higher taxes —should make the finan
cial problem of local and state and
federal governments more easy."
Against Levy Raise
Mr. Roosevelt's statement against
an increase in federal levies came
after a series of promises across the
country and back that the national
budget would be balanced in the
fiscal year starting nexj July first.
He mentioned the Supreme Court
twice tonight. There was no word,
however, on the fact that Associate
Justice Hugo L. Black took his seat
on the high tribunal bench in
Washington this noon after admit
ting one-time membership in the
Ku Klux Klan.

The farm population on January 1
of this year was 31,729,000.
