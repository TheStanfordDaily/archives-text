One of the most startling and at
the same time one of the most de
mented little bits ever written about
college football came to our attention
in the October 9 issue of Liberty
Magazine.
The article, entitled, "Does Foot
ball Make Players Stupid?" was
written by Frank Scully, old-time
gridster at Columbia University.
Without mentioning names of
players or colleges, Mr. Scully
paints an obvious picture of two
former Stanford stars in his process
of relating how four years of col
lege football can turn a man from
a brilliant student into a dithering
idiot.
To the student now on the Farm
and to all the old grads it will be
shocking to learn that Ernie Nevers
and Bobby Grayson of Stanford, two
of the greatest ail-American full
backs of all time, are mentally de
crepit. That is, they are according
to Mr. Scully.
The ■ author of this pessimistic
masterpiece tells us the sad, sad
story of Our Hero (Nevers), who
was above average mentally when
he came to college, and was able to
make a split-second decision on the
football turf. But, alas, by the time
Our Hero was a senior his brains
had been so knocked about that it
was impossible to get him through
his final exams even with all the
king's ponies and all the king's men.
Mr. Scully continues his story,
telling us that the faculty and coach
ing ttalf decided to let Our Hero
stay on as an assistant coach. But
unfortunately he played some pro
fessional football between times,
which hurried "his rapid descent into
the maelstrom of stumble-backery."
Tsk, tsk, it seems such a shame
that the idol of thousands of kids
throughout the country is wending
his weary and unhappy way to the
insane asylum door.
Then Mr. Scully takes up Our
Hero's star pupil (Grayson). The
author chooses to call Bobby Joe
Boakes. Joe Doakes could run 100
yards in well under 10 seconds and
was a star football and baseball
player when he entered college. Yes,
poor Joe Doakes could run 100 yards
in less than 10 seconds, but "today
he couldn't make up what's left of
hit. mind in that time."
The author states that Joe Doakes
began as a fine student and debater,
and today he doesn't know one el
bow from the other.
It seems that Joe Doakes was
chosen All-American in his sopho
more year, but went downhill each
succeeding year. Football experts,
being reluctant to admit either that
they have made a mistake or that
young men can deteriorate phys- ,
ically and mentally so fast, kept on
picking Joe as an Ail-American.
Poor Bobby, to think that he does- j
n't know one elbow from the other,
and that he walks on his heels. It is
indeed a shame, Bobby. I know you
don't want pity in this dire hour,
but let me offer my sympathies.
Let's turn the spotlight back on
Frank Scully, the author of this fan
tastic tale. Mr. Scully is known as
the world's most famous shut-in. He
has graduated with honor, unfailing
courage, and unshakable good hu
mor from nearly 30 hospitals, sana
toria, and clinics.
lie traces his breakdown in health
to his athletic excesses as a student.
Mr. Scully injured his leg in high
school athletics, and finally the in
jured limb had to be amputated.
Maybe that brief glimpse into the
past of Fi'ank Scully will explain
his absurb descriptions of Mr. Nevers
and Mr. Grayson. If it is possible he
should make a trip to the Univer
sity of lowa and personally have a
chat with Ernie. Then he could
ramble on here to the Farm and in- i
terview Bobby. I'm sure he'd find
them both able to add two and two.

written by Frank Scully, old-time
gridster at Columbia University.
Without mentioning names of
players or colleges, Mr. Scully
paints an obvious picture of two
former Stanford stars in his process
of relating how four years of col
lege football can turn a man from
a brilliant student into a dithering
idiot.
To the student now on the Farm
and to all the old grads it will be
shocking to learn that Ernie Nevers
and Bobby Grayson of Stanford, two
of the greatest ail-American full
backs of all time, are mentally de
crepit. That is, they are according
to Mr. Scully.
The ■ author of this pessimistic
masterpiece tells us the sad, sad
story of Our Hero (Nevers), who
was above average mentally when
he came to college, and was able to
make a split-second decision on the
football turf. But, alas, by the time
Our Hero was a senior his brains
had been so knocked about that it
was impossible to get him through
his final exams even with all the
king's ponies and all the king's men.
Mr. Scully continues his story,
telling us that the faculty and coach
ing ttalf decided to let Our Hero
stay on as an assistant coach. But
unfortunately he played some pro
fessional football between times,
which hurried "his rapid descent into
the maelstrom of stumble-backery."
Tsk, tsk, it seems such a shame
that the idol of thousands of kids
throughout the country is wending
his weary and unhappy way to the
insane asylum door.
Then Mr. Scully takes up Our
Hero's star pupil (Grayson). The
author chooses to call Bobby Joe
Boakes. Joe Doakes could run 100
yards in well under 10 seconds and
was a star football and baseball
player when he entered college. Yes,
poor Joe Doakes could run 100 yards
in less than 10 seconds, but "today
he couldn't make up what's left of
hit. mind in that time."
The author states that Joe Doakes
began as a fine student and debater,
and today he doesn't know one el
bow from the other.
It seems that Joe Doakes was
chosen All-American in his sopho
more year, but went downhill each
succeeding year. Football experts,
being reluctant to admit either that
they have made a mistake or that
young men can deteriorate phys- ,
ically and mentally so fast, kept on
picking Joe as an Ail-American.
Poor Bobby, to think that he does- j
n't know one elbow from the other,
and that he walks on his heels. It is
indeed a shame, Bobby. I know you
don't want pity in this dire hour,
but let me offer my sympathies.
Let's turn the spotlight back on
Frank Scully, the author of this fan
tastic tale. Mr. Scully is known as
the world's most famous shut-in. He
has graduated with honor, unfailing
courage, and unshakable good hu
mor from nearly 30 hospitals, sana
toria, and clinics.
lie traces his breakdown in health
to his athletic excesses as a student.
Mr. Scully injured his leg in high
school athletics, and finally the in
jured limb had to be amputated.
Maybe that brief glimpse into the
past of Fi'ank Scully will explain
his absurb descriptions of Mr. Nevers
and Mr. Grayson. If it is possible he
should make a trip to the Univer
sity of lowa and personally have a
chat with Ernie. Then he could
ramble on here to the Farm and in- i
terview Bobby. I'm sure he'd find
them both able to add two and two.
