# Tiny Shuffles Grid Beck; Deals in New Men
## Red Machine Repaired In Practice Drill Hamilton, Alustiza Set For Backfield Spots In Saturday's Game 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
It may be a new Red Machine
that takes to the field against U.C.
L.A. Saturday.
Coach Tiny Thornhill shuffled the
Stanford grid deck yesterday dur
ing practice session, and several new
men were seen trying out on the
regular line-up.
Glenn Hamilton, who made a fine
ball-tossing performance in Satur
day's game against Oregon, was be
ing tried in the quarter post to re
place Paulman, whose shoulder in
jury will keep him out of the Bruin
tilt.
End Subs Drilled
A1 Alustiza, who played a fine
tackling, blocking, and pass-receiv
ing game Saturday, will probably

have a chance at the right half post
to help relieve Bill Kirsch, the only
good replacement for Ed Garnier,
whose ankle is still in bad shape.
Bill Willard and Neil Rasmussen
are being oriented to both end spots,
in order that plenty of flank re
placements will be on hand for
either end of the line.
It was an old story with Rasmus
sen—a good man playing behind an
excellent one. For some time he has
been right end substitute for Grant
Stone, a 60 - minute player who
would be withdrawn only because of
an injury. And now he will be eli
gible to go in at left end too.
Bob Dakan, termed by his coaches
the outstanding Stanford guard
against the Webfeet, held a first
string post yesterday, and will prob
ably start next Saturday.
Several new plays, prepared es
pecially for the U.C.L.A. game, were
rehearsed yesterday afternoon. A
late scrimmage was held for those
who did not take part in the Oregon
tilt.
Stone Still Out
Stone, acting captain for two
weeks, was still in the hospital with
a cold. Jimmy Coffis was being re
cruited as signal - caller to take
Stone's place in practice.
Jack Walton, who twisted his back
Saturday, watched yesterday's scrim
on Saturday, watched yesterday's
scrimmage from the sidelines. A
brace will be prepared for his back
so that he can be used against the
Bruins next Saturday.
Dick Sutton, a substitute center,
sustained a bad cut above the eye
during dummy scrimmage, but it
will not prevent his playing.
