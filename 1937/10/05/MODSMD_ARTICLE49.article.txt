## Waxing Wroth With Cope 
### 
THE now-illustrious Cope, whose industrious
masterpiece of inaccuracy and truth, of faulty
logic and sound reasoning, was so beautifully
wrapped in masterful literary style that we took
pleasure in winding it around the most of yes
terday's editorial page, went so completely
afoul on one point that there is no resisting the
opportunity of straightening the befuddled gen
tleman out.
Having had his dream of The Great Legend
shattered by the repaving of a campus street,
the illustrious Cope has decided that ex-Comp
troller Roth has been a bad influence on the
University and is glad that it has been removed.
He is of the opinion that Mr. Roth has gone
into some strange mental state in which he
builds more and more buildings "without
thought for the University's original spirit, and
its preservation," though he does grant that the
recent Comptroller is a very charming gentle
man "since the names of skeptical Daily report
ers who have gone to sneer and come away
to write what seemed to be unjustified tributes,
is legion."
That Cope recognized this writer as the "skep
tical Daily reporter," and was so kind as to
subtly slap out his backhanded compliment, is
gratifying, - the writer is pleased that his words
are considered "legion. But, that Cope failed to
see more than a building-mad Comptroller in

Roth is unfortunate.
Not because the ex-Comptroller is a charm
ing gentleman who has hypnotized his asso
ciates, but because he is a business man, and
admittedly such, has he mapped Stanford's am
bitious building program.
Roth is not an educator, not an academician,
and never has been. He is not responsible for
more than Stanford's physical plant. His job
has nothing to do with the advancement of
Stanford's academic set-up which Bullsessioner
Cobbs today aptly touches upon. Ex-Comp
troller Roth is a business executive.
When the chemist for a reliable building ma
terials outfit furnished a faulty pavement mix
ture that turned several California state high
ways into the same kind of mess Stanford had
in front of the Memorial Hall last winter, the re
placement of materials and road was automati
cally handled by the concernâ€”hardly offering
Cope open season on Roth-baiting.
Despite its obvious errors and its injustice to
the ex-Comptroller whose guiding hand and
keen personality have been recognized assets,
yesterday's campus opinion came as a some
what welcome answer to those who had begun
to wonder whether any Stanford minds had
pierced the surface shell of everyday Univer
sity life to question where we're going and what
it's all about.
