# Tuesday Possibility
## 
### 
THERE'S a young woman down in the Ad
building who has a large, full folder on her
desk marked "Tuesday Possibilities." Not a
personal datebook, the folder contains details
of tentative engagements of speakers for the
Tuesday Lecture Series, kept by Miss Worswick,
secretary to the Public Exercises Committee.
The possibilities look good this year, perhaps
because the series was planned with more opu
lence in keeping with its new setting in the
Memorial Theater. Graham Stuart leads off to
night with a survey of the European war scare
in 1914 and now, and Robin Lampson and John
Teal, San Francisco baritone, are also on the
month's program.
It's one of the things I hoped to find at col
lege —culture without a capital C. A commen
tator on national or international affairs, some
person connected with the arts, a popular scien
tific lecturer, and a musician per month is the
way the committee plans it. Headline attrac
tions aren't in the plan; other organizations such
as Concert Series take care of them.
You might drop in tonight; it s easy to take,
and it's free. —L. L.

What sculpture is to a block of marble, edu
cation is to the soul—Addison, The Spectator
