d i HASING itself up and down the columns of yester
* day's Daily was a letter which said in effect that
Stanford is tending toward physical giantism and in
tellectual stagnation. It is improbable that ths campus
opinion will be held up to posterity as a shining ex
ample of logical reasoning or of penetrating insight.
But that does not mean it should be pigeonholed
along-side the president's report and forgotten.
For some time, observers of the Stanford scene have
been playing tag with the conclusion that we have
reached the optimum size in physical equipment, and
must begin to concentrate on the more subtle features
of the University. This idea, delicately expressed,
cautiously worded, and clad in apology, has cropped
up in various reports and petitions, from various de
partments and committees.
i> * * *
With the completion of the new education building,
Stanford will arrive at one of those turning points that
gladden the sad hearts of historians and observers. It
is becoming apparent that we must slacken up on
building for a while and do a little pushing on the
academic side. Students who have groped their way
through Eeon 1 can explain to admiring frosh that we
have reached the point of diminishing returns on
physical equipment, and must do our expanding
along another line.
And when we begin to concentrate on such in
tangibles as academic work and research, Stanford is
going to have to pass the hat for something new and
different in the way of contributions. Most of our
physical improvements have been made possible by
gifts from generous patrons of the University. Improve
ments in our intellectual features must be financed in
the same way.
* * * *
|>UT contributions for research and scholarship are
rare as smiles from the registrar's office in com
parison with gifts for physical construction. Donors get
a thrill out of seeing a red-tiled roof which bears
their name. They find it little consolation to have a
memorial amoeba; and they consider it almost an in
sult to have a new species of tape worm named after
them. But such are the results of research, and the
results of academic improvement are even less notice
able.
As it is now, our faculty ranks with almost any in
the country; but faculties change and the well known
march of time makes no exceptions for professors.
Stanford needs money to get new men, and to keep
the men we have. No rival with larger funds can lure
the Quad away from us, but more opulent universities
can induce our teachers to pack their suitcases.
* * * *
And so as we approach the end of one cycle in our
building program, the need for unearmarked money
stands out like the chapel front. We must have money
that, can be used for this and that, and/or any other
damn thing that comes up. We need contributions
from men who have enough faith in our future to sink
their gifts where they will never show.
