quartered in Peiping are 1200 first-class
American marines. Every so often they journey out
to the rifle range and knock out the bull's eye at 500
yards. Witnessing this spectacle are usually a group
of Japanese whose vision, on the average, is limited to
about 200 yards. So when they see an American
marine do his stuff at 500 yards they look around the
side of the range to see who was doing the shooting,
ing started we followed the route by which the Japa
nese troops were being sent into China. While trav
eling on a train through Manchuria and dovm the
length of Korea the Japanese intelligence officers on
board promptly took us in hand, locked up in a com
partment with the blinds drawn, and posted guards
outside. Object, mainly to keep us from taking pic
tures of the inpouring troops and to give them time to
wire ahead to find if we were spies. Although the
blinds were drawn one particular day we managed to
glimpse 17 heavily loaded troop trains.
Landing in Japan we were blessed with numerous
visits to police headquarters and favored with a
shadow who politely but firmly stuck through the two
weeks of our stay. So goes the Japanese policy of
keeping possible spies in hand and holders of "dan
gerous thoughts" in check.

'T'HE islands of Japan we found to be in a bustle of
war fever which we thought at first to be spon
taneous. However, when we learned that the tre
mendous crowds following each soldier from his home
to the station en route to the China front were not
voluntarily enthusiastic. For aside from the flag waving
children, these groups were government sponsored,
comprising some sort of "send-off and cheer-you-up
league."
Propaganda is scattered the length of Japan. Strict
censorship of the press keeps the people under the
illusion that they are fighting a defensive war and that
the sympathy of the world is with them. War en
thusiasts are the militarists and youth.
The few business men with whom we talked, al
though afraid to openly condemn their own govern
ment's policy, hinted that they thought they were em
barking on a program which might mean ruin for
their country. They realize the perilous condition of
finances at this time. People have been taxed and
over-taxed, their bond issue supposedly surpasses the
saturation point, and the national income scarcely
meets the interest on their indebtedness.
Chinese officials and government men realize the
above facts, and believing that they can hold out for
at least several months at this pace, hope against hope
that internal strife will defeat Japan.
One fact seems to be clearly written, namely, that
neither one can possibly give in now. Japanese psy
chology is such that their national honor is at stake and
their patriotism is so intense that many of them would
commit harikari if their troops failed.
The fact also remains that the Russians are mobiliz
ing along the Manchurian border, presenting a greater
threat perhaps than ever before, making it absolutely
vital to secure a good porton of North China to fortify
against the Soviet Republic. By arming mountain sec
tors north of Peiping they would have a greater chance
of repelling advances of the powerful East Siberian
army.

{JHINA, on the other hand, has an even more serious
A purpose since she is defending her land, trying to
force herself forever from tenacious Nipponese im
perialists. Even if she has to resort to a type of
guerilla warfare she hopes to wear down the Japanese,
even assimilating them.
As long as the present three routes of importing
foreign arms and munitions remain open for China
she has a fighting chance—as long as her various
armies remain united under their single leader, Chiang
Kai Shek, and work for their common welfare—as
long as there is a chance of Japan collapsing internally
—and finally, as long as occidental countries give the
slightest assurance of their sympathies toward China
backed by occasional shipments of arms and possibly
in the future an economic embargo of Japanese goods
the newly unified nation of the Chinese will continue
to threaten the success of modern fighting units sent
from Japan.
