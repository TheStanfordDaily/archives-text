# CAMPUS OPINION
## DOPE ON "COPE" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The reflections on Dr. Wilbur's
address appearing in Monday's Daily
must have come from a brain con
taining a carnival's "magic mirror"
—you know what I mean, one of
those that is more or less warped?
Marvelous, such distortions, and
still what resemblance to the orig
inal! Take Mr. Roth, now—doesn't
he look just like the original fiend
incarnate, and isn't it cunning the
way that Dr. Wilbur appears to be
sticking a knife into the middle of
his very own back?
Just picture some of the inci
dental changes that Mr. Cope, this
Reformer of Universities, would
make. Among other things (of equal
intelligence) he would "modernize"
the buildings on the Quad —in his
own words, "Tear out the walls,
floors, and windows which have
been here for 50 years" (just have
the ceilings, I suppose?) and make
the corresponding improvements to
"modernize as much as possible what
now exists."
But enough copy has been already
wasted in Mr. Cope's behalf — the
point I want to make is this: I'm
not surprised, Mr. Frost, that in a
university of 4000 there is at least
one such dim brain; but I am sur
prised that you, sir, the editor, could
print nearly two columns of the
balmy stuff. Wasn't there anything
there that you might have edited?
If it is true that there was nothing
else with which to fill up the back
page, then you have my greatest

sympathy; but please, under similar
circumstances in the future, won't
you find someone who can draw
funny pictures or something we can
take in at a glance without wasting
so much time and causing us so
much grief, in the behalf of our
paper?
Yours,
Lin Polin, '38
The Editor, Sir:
May I request that, in the future,
the writer who signed the article
which appeared in the column yes
terday as "Cope," attach his first
name or initials? This will avoid the
creation of incorrect associations in
the minds of Daily readers.

not surprised, Mr. Frost, that in a
university of 4000 there is at least
one such dim brain; but I am sur
prised that you, sir, the editor, could
print nearly two columns of the
balmy stuff. Wasn't there anything
there that you might have edited?
If it is true that there was nothing
else with which to fill up the back
page, then you have my greatest

sympathy; but please, under similar
circumstances in the future, won't
you find someone who can draw
funny pictures or something we can
take in at a glance without wasting
so much time and causing us so
much grief, in the behalf of our
paper?

The Editor, Sir:
May I request that, in the future,
the writer who signed the article
which appeared in the column yes
terday as "Cope," attach his first
name or initials? This will avoid the
creation of incorrect associations in
the minds of Daily readers.
O. B. Cope
The Editor, Sir:
The reflections on Dr. Wilbur's
address appearing in Monday's Daily
must have come from a brain con
taining a carnival's "magic mirror"
—you know what I mean, one of
those that is more or less warped?
Marvelous, such distortions, and
still what resemblance to the orig
inal! Take Mr. Roth, now—doesn't
he look just like the original fiend
incarnate, and isn't it cunning the
way that Dr. Wilbur appears to be
sticking a knife into the middle of
his very own back?
Just picture some of the inci
dental changes that Mr. Cope, this
Reformer of Universities, would
make. Among other things (of equal
intelligence) he would "modernize"
the buildings on the Quad —in his
own words, "Tear out the walls,
floors, and windows which have
been here for 50 years" (just have
the ceilings, I suppose?) and make
the corresponding improvements to
"modernize as much as possible what
now exists."
But enough copy has been already
wasted in Mr. Cope's behalf — the
point I want to make is this: I'm
not surprised, Mr. Frost, that in a
university of 4000 there is at least
one such dim brain; but I am sur
prised that you, sir, the editor, could
print nearly two columns of the
balmy stuff. Wasn't there anything
