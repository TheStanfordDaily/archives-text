# F.D.R. Blasts War-Crazed Governments
## President Presents Plan To Quarantine States Which Menace World 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 5 (U.R).—Presi
i dent Roosevelt tonight charted the
United States on a vigorous new
foreign policy pledged to stand
tirmly for international peace against
those powers which he indirectly
charged had "jeopardized" world se
curity.
The president did not call any
countries by name. But observers
read Japan, Italy, and Germany into
his nationally broadcast address
when he said:
"Without a declaration of war and
without warning or justification of
any kind, civilians, including vast
numbers of women and children,
are being ruthlessly murdered with
bombs from the air.
"In times of so-called peace, ships
are being attacked and sunk by sub
marines without cause or notice. Na
tions are fomenting and taking sides
in civil warfare in nations that have
never done them any harm.
•Quarantine' Urged
"Nations claiming freedom for
themselves deny it to others."
America's policy, Mr. Roosevelt
said, should be to join in a "con
certed" effort by peace-loving na
tions to "quarantine" warlike na
tions.
"When an epidemic of physical
disease starts to spread," he de
clared, "the community approves
and joins in a quarantine of the
patients in order to protect the
health of the community against the
spread of disease.
"It is my detei'mination to pur
sue a policy of peace and to adopt
every practicable measure to avoid
involvement in war.
Aggressors Flayed
"It ought to be inconceivable that
in this modern era, and in the face
of experience, any nation could be
so foolish and ruthless as to run the
risk of plunging the whole world
into war by invading and violating
in contravention of solemn treaties,
the territory of other nations that
have done no real harm and which
are too weak to protect themselves
adequately.
"Yet thei peace of the world and
the welfare and socurity of every
nation is today being threatened by
that very thing."
Mr. Roosevelt spoke at the dedi
cation of Chicago's new Outer Drive
Bridge, a Public Works Administra
tion project giving the city 30 miles
of parkway drives along Lake Mich
igan.
