# Braly, Underwood Top Net Ladder
## 
### 
Bob Braly, Bob Underwood, Jim
Seaver, Myron Folsom, Jack Laney,
and Art Stoefen led the varsity ten
nis ladder posted yesterday in the
men's gym.
The doubles team of Braly and
Stoefen has shown power in prac
tice and looms as a possible suc
cessor to last year's combination of
Ben Dey and Bill Seward, promi
nent National Intercollegiate Doub
les champs.
Competition will be stiff for posi
tions on this year's varsity, and
such competent racquet wielders as
Brock, Gates, Biorkman, and Ralphs
will force the first six to fight hard
to retain their places.
