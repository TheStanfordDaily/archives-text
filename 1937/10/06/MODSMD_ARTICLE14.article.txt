# Firm Cited For Absorbing Tax
## Advertising Ruled Illegal By Sales-Tax Board 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 5 (U.R).â€”A
Los Angeles grocery was cited to
day to show cause why its license
should not be revoked in the Board
of Equalization's first move to en
force its recent ruling requiring re
tailers to list the sales tax collected
from customers.
The firm cited was Ralph's Gro
cery. The company was accused of
advertising that it absorbs the three
per cent tax and does not pass it on
to consumers.
There is no specific provision in
the sales tax act prohibiting mer
chants from absorbing the tax, but
they are forbidden to advertise ab
sorption, directly or indirectly.
T. H. Mugford, chief of the board's
sales tax division, told a group of
retailers the board's Rule 73 does
not require collection of the tax
from consumers.
"But it does require that those
who collect the tax from consumers
must state the amount so collected,"
he explained.
