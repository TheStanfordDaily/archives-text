# Faculty Salary Raised By Official Measure
## 
### 
Faculty salary reductions for 1937-38 will be officially reduced one
half from the 10 per cent cut which has been effective since 1933. Presi
dent Wilbur announced yesterday.
The Board of Trustees regards the University's financial position as
being capable of guaranteeing the 5 per cent return, and is therefore in-

eluding the additional sum in the"
budget of anticipated expenditures
for the present academic year.
In actual practice, the University
has always found itself able to re
fund half of the 10 per cent cut, with
the exception of the lats five months
of the year 1932-33. However, this
return has been dependent upon
the size of the balance left after
other expenses were met.
The extra allocations are contained
in the regular salary checks being
mailed to the staff.
