# Stevens Now Directs Stanford Drama
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
The man who brought streamlined
Shakespeare to an audience of two
million Americans is teaching at
Stanford this quarter.
Thomas Wood Stevens, director of
the famed Globe Theater Players at
the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 and
1934 and at the San Diego Exposition
in 1935 and 1936, has been appointed
acting director in the Department of
Speech and Drama.
Mr. Stevens became interested in
the Department of Speech and
Drama and the facilities of Memorial
Hall when he met Professor Lee Em
erson Bassett, head of the depart
ment, at a Speech Conference held
here during the summer. His ap
pointment follows the new policy of
emphasis on the dramatic arts.
Liked Work
Small, gray-haired, agile, sharp of
feature and wit, Mr. Stevens has had
a wealth of experience producing,
directing, and teaching the drama.
He terms his work with the Globe
Players "a great adventure for a
director."
He had the unique opportunity of
presenting 18 of the plays in the
same type building Shakespeare
used, and he had to meet the same
conditions that Shakespeare met.
The streamlining of the plays was
merely in accordance with the

commercial policy of the Fair, and
not in any way an artistic experi
ment, according to Mr. Stevens.
Seven productions a day were
given at Chicago and six at San
Diego. At first the plays most easily
reduced were selected, but the rep
ertoire was constantly expanded. "At

a matter of fact," says the director,
it was not necessary to cut a great
deal because omitting all intermis
sions and changes of scenery saved
valuable time."
The plan that brought the Bard
of Avon's works to two million peo
ple in four summers starred as part
of a proposed English village at the
Chicago Fair. Representatives were
sent to the University of London,
only to find that the man who had
originated the idea of popular
Shakespearean performances at the
Exposition and the man who Eng
lish dramatic authorities recom
mended to produce them was Thomas
Wood Stevens of Chicago.
Praises Facilities
Turning to a consideration of
Stanford's new dramatic plant, Mr.
Stevens especially praised the flexi
bility of the available equipment
and the tremendous possibilities of
fered for all types of productions.
"While the main auditorium is ap
propriate for elaborate presenta
tions, I am particularly attracted to
the Little Theater as an ideal setting
for intimate modern plays and ex
perimental productions," he stated.
Mr. Stevens finds the new Frost
Amphitheater especially well suited
J for pageant work. He has had wide
experience in this field, having writ
