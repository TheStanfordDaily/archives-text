## 
### 
In the first two days of their sale,
500 of the ne wstyle pompons were
sold. There are only 500 more avail
able at present. Today is the last
day they will be on sale in front of
the Post Office, from 10 to 12 o'clock
in the morning and 1 to 2 o'clock
in the afternoon.
After today the pompons will be
sold only at the games and the
A.S.S.U. office. Only those girls who
have the pompons will be admitted
to games.
The correct spelling of the ,word
pompon was designated by the Ex

of the former "pompom."
