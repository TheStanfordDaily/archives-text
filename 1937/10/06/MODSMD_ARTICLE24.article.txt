### 
SHANGHAI, Oct. 5 (UP). â€”Chi-
nese troops stopped the Japanese
general offensive short today and
countered with a rain of big gun
shells on Japanese key points.
The Chinese lines cracked yester
day. But when the Japanese went
over the top again at dawn today
they met with a stone-wall defense.
Expert Chinese artillerymen scored
direct hits on the Japanese navy
headquarters area of Honkew, Jap
anese controlled section of the In
ternational Settlement.
Japs Stopped
A Japanese spokesman, somewhat
less jubilant than were Japanese
spokesmen yesterday, admitted that
his men have been stopped along
the Lotien-Kiating Highway. It was
the same in the Shanghai sector.
American authorities announced
today that the navy transport Chau
mont would sail for Kobe, Japan,
and that then navy evacuation of
American citizens would end, as the
Chaumont would proceed to regular
duties.
