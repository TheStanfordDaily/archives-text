# Change in Drama Set-Up Approved By Ex Committee
## Weiner, Williams Posts To Be Filled At Special Election October 18 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Stanford dramatic lights left Ex Committee's initial meeting of the year
last night satisfied that "Stanford Players"—or whatever their newly
amalgamated drama society will be called—will he allowed to take over
the Farm's student theater activities.
Because a technical rule forbids Ex Committee's recognizing a new
campus organization without I)r. Wilbur's previous approval of its con-

►stitution, "Stanford Players" must
' wait until next week for formal
granting of its charter. The legisla
tive body last night "went on rec
ord" approving the new society.
Bud Cady', president of now-de
funct Barnstormers, asked Ex Com
mittee to accept his suggestions for
revamping Dramatic Council, but
the legislators preferred to wait till
next Tuesday, act officially on all
dramatic business then.
Cady's revision of the Council
would cut it from nine to five mem
bers, abolish Daily, Chappie, and
Quad seats. Press members, even
Daily Editor Gordy Frost admitted,
have usually been uninterested,
merely prolonged and confused
Council action.
"We're looking for a unification
of interest in student dramatics,"
Cady told the Committee. "Stanford
Players will eliminate the cross pur
poses which have before stalled prog
ress in campus drama." Both he and
Hal Kahn felt Dramatic Council re
vision was necessary to complete
the whole theater reform.
SPECIAL ELECTION —To fill
Committee vacancies left by Joe
Weiner and Fred Williams, graduate
members no longer in school, the
campus will vote at a special elec
tion two weeks from yesterday.
Nominations will start next Tues
day.
STANFORD SPECIAL—This year
Farm rooters will again careen to
Los Angeles aboard Southern Pa
cific's "Stanford Special" the night
of November 5 for the next day's
football game against U.S.C.
When someone whimpered that
U.C.L.A.'s special was cheaper. Stu
dent Manager Chuck Fontius ex
plained that southern collegians will
ride tourist class, Stanfordites first
class.
"And, anyway," broke in Presi
dent Tom Kiliefer, peering through
his official horn-rimmed spectacles,
"I read in the Daily Bruin just this
morning that their berth-rate's the
same."
APPOINTMENTS — Though her
work's already done, Lenore Albert
son was confirmed as chairman of
the Junior Transfers' Pre-Reg Com
mittee. Margaret Spencer was ap
pointed to Student Aid Committee.
SPAIN, ETC.—Ex Committee gave
these answers to these uncomfortable
little questions, the likes of which
invariably crop up in Ex Committee
meetings:
1. Asked by the N.A.C.A.S.D.
(North American Committee to Aid
Spanish Democracy): "Dear Friends:
How's work for Spain progressing
on your campus?" Answer: Not
very well. Committeemen gulped a
little self-consciously and Fontius
mumbled something about Com
munism.
WHO'S WIIO — Roy Winkleman
and Art Stoefen were appointed to
decide who are the 19 most promi
nent Stanfordites, so they can each
pay $3 to get their names in a na
tional collegiate "Who's Who."
