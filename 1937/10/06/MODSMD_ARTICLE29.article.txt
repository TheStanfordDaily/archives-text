# Conflicts Over Ouster Moves Stymie A.F.L.
## Demands for Expulsion Of Rebel CIO Unions Dominate Convention 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 5 (U.R).—The Amer
ican Federation of Labor's 57th an
nual convention today bumped
head-on into a series of bitter con
flicts arising from demands for ex
pulsion of the rebeL Committee for
Industrial Organizanon unions and
for ouster of the National Labor Re
lations Board.
Controversy over both issues dom
inated one of the most momentous
conventions of organized labor and
temporarily slowed up the cam
paign of President William Green
for a drive to crush unions headed
by John L. Lewis.
Union Uprising
Developments included:
An uprising by the big Typo
graphical Union—including a threat
to walk out—because of an attempt
to bar Charles P. Howard, president
of the typographers and secretary of
the C.1.0., from his seat at the con
vention.
Introduction of a resolution call
ing upon President Roosevelt, Secre
tary of Labor Frances Perkins, and
Congress to disband the Labor Board
because it "prejudged cases in favor
of the C.1.0." and to form a new
hoard that will "honestly carry out
the intent" of the Wagner Act.
Charges Prejudice
Chairman J. Warren Madden of
the National Labor Relations Board
struck back at A.F.L. charges of
"prejudice" toward C.1.0. unions.
Addressing many hostile labor
leaders at the federation's 57th an
nual convention, he declared that the
rivalry between the A.F.L and C.1.0.
would not be permitted to sway the
board from its efforts to administer
the labor act impartially.
