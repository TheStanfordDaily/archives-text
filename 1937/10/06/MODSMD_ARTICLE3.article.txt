# German Students Plan Nativity Play
## 
### 
To familiarize students with spok
en German, a German drama class,
to be opened under Professor Kurt F.
Rcinhardt, will produce a Nativity
play, "The Night of the Shepherds,"
early in December. Tryouts begin
today at 4:15 o'clock, Room 118, in
the German department, where the
class will be held.
An old German folk play in mod
ern dialogue, "The Night of Shep
herds" deals with the Advent, and
offers eight speaking parts. Pro
fessor Reinhardt yesterday sent out
a call for students to aid in technical
production.
