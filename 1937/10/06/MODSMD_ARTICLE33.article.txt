### GEORGE VENESS 
The Interfraternity Council has satisfied a long felt need with the es
tablishment of a council olTice this year in Room 1 of the Old Union.
For the first time Greeks, freshmen, and the curious have a centrally
located, permanent office where they may go to inquire about fraternities,
rushing, and anything else concerning the Row.

' Office hours will be Monday
through Thursday from 1 until 3
o'clock. For appointments the office
phone number is P.A. 6022. '
First rushing period will be Octo
ber 15 and 16. Rushing cards will be
available to fraternities in the A.S.
S.U. office Monday, Ocotber 11.
Any freshmen who are confused as
to their positions in relation to the
Row are especially invited to make
use of the new Council office. The
Council is anxious that frosh avail
themselves of this office rather than
make mistakes through ignorance
which cause rushing complications.
The Interfraternity Council will
meet tonight in Room I, Old Union,
to nominate a new member.
Tomorrow night the Interfraternity
Council will meet at 6 o'clock at
the Delt house to make final arrange
ments for this year's rushing and to
discuss rules. All house presidents
are asked to be present.
