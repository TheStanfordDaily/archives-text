Are the Cards doomed for an
other defeat Saturday?
Nearly everything points to a
Bruin victory when Tiny's Indians
dig in their cleats in the stadium
in an attempt to offset the on
coming charge of the Bruins from
U.C.L.A.
Didn't the Bruins swamp the Ore
gon Webfeet, 26-13, and didn't the
Indians take a 7-6 licking from the
same Duck outfit?
Yes, on comparative scores it
looks like an overwhelming victory
for the Westwood gridders. But
football score-boards aren't regu
lated by comparative scores of past
games and Saturday's struggle here
on the Farm should be a thriller.
WESTWOOD GRIDDERS
SHOULD SCORE VICTORY
The Westwood team should win.
They may win by two touch-downs.
But you loyal Stanford fans don't
count Tiny's Little Red Kiddie Kar
out of the running yet.
The improvement shown by the
Cardinal gridders in the past week
and a half is, I'm sure, quite evi
dent. The Indians didn't seem to
click in any department of the
game against the Santa Clarans in
the season's opener. The score
hoard read 13-7 — it might have
read 30-7.
A rejuvenated bunch of Stanford
footballers boarded the train for
Oregon and outplayed the Ducks
everyplace but on the scoreboard.
The Stanfords piled up 37G yards
from scrimmage, while the Oregon
ians were collecting 200. The Indians
chalked up a nice, sizeable total of
19 first downs and left the Web
feet 8.
RED KIDDIE KAR
STARTED TO PERCOLATE
The Little Red Kiddie Kar looked
like the Big Red Machine of the
vowing sophomore days—in the mid
dle of the field. The Indian ground
attack, interspersed with a few
passes, had carried them goalward
four times during the game, but they
only scored once.
The first drive carried Stanford to
the four-yard line. It is still hard i
to tell why Grant Stone called that
pass play on the five-yard line with
two downs to make 3 yards and a
first down. It was just one of those
things. If it had worked, it would
have been called a brilliant bit of
engineering.
The second drive ended with the
gun denoting the end of the first
half and the ball on the Oregon
12-yard line. The third drive car- [
ried the Redskins to the 20, and
the fourth drive was good for the
score.
TOUCHDOWN POWER
NEEDED BY INDIANS
Tiny's problem for the Uclan !
game is to transform his midfield j
power into touchdown power. If the I
Indians can accomplish this, they J
can pull a mild upset by whipping ■
the favored Bruins.
The offensive power of the Spaul- !
ding charges was amply .showed in j
their first and only game of the sea
son when they piled up 26 points j
against Oregon. But —what kind of j
a defense has the Bruin machine? i
The Webfeet pushed across 13 points
in that first game.
We look for p high scoring con
test Saturday with both teams get- ,j
ting a taste of pay dirt. Right now
it looks like the Bruins might
make it three touchdowns to two.
Incidentally. Bill Spaulding, coach
of the Uclans, has been a head coach i
longer than anyone in the confer- j
ence. This is his 31st season of tu- j
toring cleated warriors. Howard
Jones of Southern Cal is second I
with 26 to his credit, and James j
Phelan of Washington comes in third
with 18.

first down. It was just one of those
things. If it had worked, it would
have been called a brilliant bit of
engineering.
The second drive ended with the
gun denoting the end of the first
half and the ball on the Oregon
12-yard line. The third drive car- [
ried the Redskins to the 20, and
the fourth drive was good for the
score.
TOUCHDOWN POWER
NEEDED BY INDIANS
Tiny's problem for the Uclan !
game is to transform his midfield j
power into touchdown power. If the I
Indians can accomplish this, they J
can pull a mild upset by whipping ■
the favored Bruins.
The offensive power of the Spaul- !
ding charges was amply .showed in j
their first and only game of the sea
son when they piled up 26 points j
against Oregon. But —what kind of j
a defense has the Bruin machine? i
The Webfeet pushed across 13 points
in that first game.
We look for p high scoring con
test Saturday with both teams get- ,j
ting a taste of pay dirt. Right now
it looks like the Bruins might
make it three touchdowns to two.
Incidentally. Bill Spaulding, coach
of the Uclans, has been a head coach i
longer than anyone in the confer- j
ence. This is his 31st season of tu- j
toring cleated warriors. Howard
Jones of Southern Cal is second I
with 26 to his credit, and James j
Phelan of Washington comes in third
with 18.
Are the Cards doomed for an
other defeat Saturday?
Nearly everything points to a
Bruin victory when Tiny's Indians
dig in their cleats in the stadium
in an attempt to offset the on
coming charge of the Bruins from
U.C.L.A.
Didn't the Bruins swamp the Ore
gon Webfeet, 26-13, and didn't the
Indians take a 7-6 licking from the
same Duck outfit?
Yes, on comparative scores it
looks like an overwhelming victory
for the Westwood gridders. But
football score-boards aren't regu
lated by comparative scores of past
games and Saturday's struggle here
on the Farm should be a thriller.
WESTWOOD GRIDDERS
SHOULD SCORE VICTORY
The Westwood team should win.
They may win by two touch-downs.
But you loyal Stanford fans don't
count Tiny's Little Red Kiddie Kar
out of the running yet.
The improvement shown by the
Cardinal gridders in the past week
and a half is, I'm sure, quite evi
dent. The Indians didn't seem to
click in any department of the
game against the Santa Clarans in
the season's opener. The score
hoard read 13-7 — it might have
read 30-7.
A rejuvenated bunch of Stanford
footballers boarded the train for
Oregon and outplayed the Ducks
everyplace but on the scoreboard.
The Stanfords piled up 37G yards
from scrimmage, while the Oregon
ians were collecting 200. The Indians
chalked up a nice, sizeable total of
19 first downs and left the Web
feet 8.
RED KIDDIE KAR
STARTED TO PERCOLATE
The Little Red Kiddie Kar looked
like the Big Red Machine of the
vowing sophomore days—in the mid
dle of the field. The Indian ground
attack, interspersed with a few
passes, had carried them goalward
four times during the game, but they
only scored once.
The first drive carried Stanford to
the four-yard line. It is still hard i
to tell why Grant Stone called that
pass play on the five-yard line with
two downs to make 3 yards and a
first down. It was just one of those
things. If it had worked, it would
have been called a brilliant bit of
engineering.
The second drive ended with the
