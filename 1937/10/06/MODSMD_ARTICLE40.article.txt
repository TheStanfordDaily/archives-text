hill is taking advantage of the favor
able weather for long practice ses
sions.
Regulars Defeated
An aggregation of second- and
third-stringers defeated the reg
ulars, with several exceptions, 6-0
in scrimmage.
Demonstrating to his superiors
the art of the near-goal push, Jake
Brigham carried the ball into the
end zone from a first-down position
on the 6-yard line. No conversion
was attempted.
Grant Stone was out and warm
ing up after a weekend in the hos
pital with a cold. The sturdy flank
man and signal-caller did not take
part in scrimmage.
Part of the afternoon was spent in
dummy scrimmage, with the first
string playing on the defensive
against U.C.L.A. plays in prepara
tion for the Bruin tilt Saturday.
Alustiza Shifted
A1 Alustiza's proposed shift to the
right half spot to help relieve Bill
Kirsch, who will replace Ed Gar
nier Saturday if the brunet "slaugh
terhouse" has not recovered from an
injured ankle, was postponed until
next week. Fred Ledeboer, trans
fer from San Mateo, was tried in the
spot, where he showed considerable
promise.
Pete Zagar and Tony Calvelli,
stars of the Oregon conflict, both re
frained from scrimmage.
Glenn Hamilton remained in the
quarter post, where he was placed
