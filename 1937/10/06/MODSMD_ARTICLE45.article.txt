## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 5 (UP). —The "biggest" World Series in history will
start tomorrow at Yankee Stadium, with Carl Hubbell of the Giants op
posing Lefty Gomez of the Yankees in a southpaw pitching duel.
This mound battle was assured today for the curtain-raiser when Man
ager Joe McCarthy of the Yanks announced that Gomez, fast-ball king

of the American League, would face
Hubbell, the National circuit's screw
ball ace.
Crowds Expected
Despite threats of cloudy weather
and possible showers, more than
70,000 fans are expected to jam the
enlarged stadium for the inaugural
of a classic that seems virtually cer
tain to shatter all previous records
for series attendance and diamond
drama.
The contrasting styles of tomor
row's moundsmen — the Yanks'
"power" flinger vs. the Giants'
"smart" pitcher—symbolize the dis
similar strengths of the rival clubs.
Murderers' Row
What will happen when "murder
ers' row," the Yanks' great run
making machine, clashes with the
tightest defensive club built in years
by the Giants? That question and a
rising feud between the two teams
captivated an entire nation tonight,
on the eve of the fifth "nickel"
World Series. Each club won two
previous all-New York series.
McCarthy's selection of Gomez
had been expected. Hence there
was no change in betting odds. To
morrow's game will be the first in
which there is a southpaw inaugural
duel since 1926 when Herb Pennock
of the Yanks beat Wee Willie Sher
del of the Cardinals.
