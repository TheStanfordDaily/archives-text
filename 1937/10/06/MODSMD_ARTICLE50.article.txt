# Frosh Primed For S.C. Tilt Next Saturday
## Shipkey Busy Building Attack and Defense Against Trojan Power 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey is going to
have to put his frosh football team
through plenty of hard work this
week if he expects them to beat
U.S.C. when they travel south Sat
urday.
According to Shipkey, U.S.C. has
probably the strongest frosh team on
the coast. "We're going to have to
put in plenty of work polishing up
our running attack and building up
a defense against their power plays.
But if we can hold them on defense,
we have a good chance to beat
them," the Papoose mentor said
yesterday.
Yesterday the team concentrated
on kicking, with the team practicing
getting off kicks with speed and ac
curacy. and getting down under
them. Today tjie squad scrimmages,
tomorrow they wll hold a dummy
scrimmage against Southern Cal
plays, and Friday they will practice
defense against these plays.
Big gun on the Trobabe team,
ironically enough, will be Bob
Peoples, who plays fullback for
them like a varsity player. Some
idea of their strength is shown by
the fact that Bob Berryman, "Little"
brother of Trojan varsity fullback
Dick Berryman, plays second-string
quarter.
Berryman went to the rival high
school of Stanford's frosh captain,
Norm Standlee, and always bettered
Standlee in their yearly private
duels. And Standlee is no slouch, as
can well be testified by Stanford
grid fans.
