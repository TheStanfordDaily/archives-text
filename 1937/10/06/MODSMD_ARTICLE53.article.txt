# Polo Scrimmage Set for Friday
## Captain Grubbs Delays First Practice Game 
### 
First polo scrimmage of the sea
son, scheduled for today, has been
postponed until this Friday at 3
o'clock on the highway polo field.
In the meantime horsemen who be
gan practicing Monday will continue
to work on the fundamentals of rid
ing, hitting, and team play.
While it is hard to judge this early
in the season, according to Captain
Grubbs, Card polo mentor, prospects
for the Indians look very good this
season. The varsity will probably see
Bert Hyde at number one; Don Mc-
Ausland, number two; Bob Wallace,
number three; and Bert McClintock,
number four, together with Captain
Jim Fullerton on the field.
Most likely new member of the
squad is E. W. Downey, a junior
transfer from New Mexico Militavy
Institute with much experience.
Fifteen frosh have turned out so far
and the three polo squads now have
a total of about 60 members.
Sunbeams passing across a dusty
circus ring are hazardous to acro
batic riders since horses frequently
try to hurdle them.
