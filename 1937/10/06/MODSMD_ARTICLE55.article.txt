## Before the Merry-go-Round Breaks Down 
### 
THAT Stanford University has been chasing
its own tail around a somewhat vicious
circle seems to be apparent from the conglom
eration of opinions that have flooded these
columns as to whither and where the' good
University is headed.
One general opinion seems to come out of
the whirl and that is that Stanford is headed
toward bigness, meaning physical size. How
ever, just why a student editor should be
troubling his typewriter, a typesetter, and a lot
of other people who have gotten this far, is
subject for another editorial.
But even the less seriously inclined, the less
interested, plus the serious Mr. Cope, et al., may
see that herein lies the germ for most of their
worries, that here is Stanford's problem.
In 1929 there was some slight trouble on Wall
Street, we are told, and during the succeeding
years a commodity known as money became
exceedingly scarce, so much so that the "make
checks payable" window of Stanford University
began to use measures recommended for the
obviously unsocial. In this case it amounted to
the lowering of entrance requirements, so the
happy ones, who still remembered what money
was, could spend it. Such action is not to be
condemned —it was unavoidable.
But now in the year 1937 there is said to be
money again, and for the first time since those
days when the earning curves ran off the bot
tom of the chart, Stanford has a chance to turn
away prospective entrants.
However, rather than let too many 115-dollar
chunks of gold go sailing away, the enrollment
is being allowed to increase.
Now here is where the vicious circle takes its

bite. With increasing dollars taken in tuition,
there is increasing enrollment, increasing need
for housing, increasing size of classes, increas
ing overhead for everything students use. Stan
ford is on the increase. And before it even gets
started the increased tuition looks like pin
money against the increased cost.
Twenty years ago when it was socially cor
rect for a university to grow as big physically
as it could be, we would have been one of the
mob. At that time, however, we were reveling
in extreme youth, and diminutive size — and
were prospering in both.
Now, when the others have found their folly
in huge buildings, enormous classes handled
with loudspeaker address systems, Stanford be
latedly follows the others, lets its enrollment
increase, and its classes grow.
Now is the time to stop just that. The gates
that were raised when the depression hit must
now drop. Limit on entrance numbers must be
set. Requirements must be made ironclad.
This is not to imply that buildings should not
be constructed to more adequately house and
efficiently train those who today are here, that
no additional steps be taken to make Stanford
comfortable in physical structure.
But under no circumstances should the
classes which only this year have begun to
bulge like those of U. of C„ be increased, nor
should the labs designed to accommodate 15
and now serving 25 be further taxed.
If Stanford is to cling to the wishes of its
founders, to its traditional rural atmosphere, to
its democratic idealisms, to its academic posi
tion, there must be a limit on enrollment.
The gates must be lowered not later —but
now!

ever, just why a student editor should be
troubling his typewriter, a typesetter, and a lot
of other people who have gotten this far, is
subject for another editorial.
But even the less seriously inclined, the less
interested, plus the serious Mr. Cope, et al., may
see that herein lies the germ for most of their
worries, that here is Stanford's problem.
In 1929 there was some slight trouble on Wall
Street, we are told, and during the succeeding
years a commodity known as money became
exceedingly scarce, so much so that the "make
checks payable" window of Stanford University
began to use measures recommended for the
obviously unsocial. In this case it amounted to
the lowering of entrance requirements, so the
happy ones, who still remembered what money
was, could spend it. Such action is not to be
condemned —it was unavoidable.
But now in the year 1937 there is said to be
money again, and for the first time since those
days when the earning curves ran off the bot
tom of the chart, Stanford has a chance to turn
away prospective entrants.
However, rather than let too many 115-dollar
chunks of gold go sailing away, the enrollment
is being allowed to increase.
Now here is where the vicious circle takes its

bite. With increasing dollars taken in tuition,
there is increasing enrollment, increasing need
for housing, increasing size of classes, increas
ing overhead for everything students use. Stan
ford is on the increase. And before it even gets
started the increased tuition looks like pin
money against the increased cost.
Twenty years ago when it was socially cor
rect for a university to grow as big physically
as it could be, we would have been one of the
mob. At that time, however, we were reveling
in extreme youth, and diminutive size — and
were prospering in both.
Now, when the others have found their folly
in huge buildings, enormous classes handled
with loudspeaker address systems, Stanford be
latedly follows the others, lets its enrollment
increase, and its classes grow.
Now is the time to stop just that. The gates
that were raised when the depression hit must
now drop. Limit on entrance numbers must be
set. Requirements must be made ironclad.
This is not to imply that buildings should not
be constructed to more adequately house and
efficiently train those who today are here, that
no additional steps be taken to make Stanford
comfortable in physical structure.
But under no circumstances should the
classes which only this year have begun to
bulge like those of U. of C„ be increased, nor
should the labs designed to accommodate 15
and now serving 25 be further taxed.
If Stanford is to cling to the wishes of its
founders, to its traditional rural atmosphere, to
its democratic idealisms, to its academic posi
tion, there must be a limit on enrollment.
The gates must be lowered not later —but
now!
THAT Stanford University has been chasing
its own tail around a somewhat vicious
circle seems to be apparent from the conglom
eration of opinions that have flooded these
columns as to whither and where the' good
University is headed.
One general opinion seems to come out of
the whirl and that is that Stanford is headed
toward bigness, meaning physical size. How
ever, just why a student editor should be
troubling his typewriter, a typesetter, and a lot
of other people who have gotten this far, is
subject for another editorial.
