A MINUTE saved is a minute earned, but a
life saved is $115 for Stanford.
Both lives and minutes would be saved by
the projected underpass passing under the S.P.
tracks and either under or over El Camino Real,
and the increasing toll of traffic accidents would
be cut short at the same time that traffic was
facilitated.
A prospect like this is enough to make effi
ciency experts declare extra dividends —yet
after two months of dilly-dallying no definite
plan has been formulated and no okay has been
given.
Backed to the tune of $300,000 by the federal
government, the section of the project which
includes moving the railroad tracks and con
structing a pass below them will probably soon
be approved.
But the "clover leaf" at the intersection of
University Avenue and the highway is still in
an embryonic stage —is still in fact without back
ing. Wanting is an adequate plan as well as

the approval of Stanford's Board of Trustees.
Chiefly interested in the looks of the Palm
Drive entrance, trustees have seemingly made
no effort to find an adequate plan for converting
the intersection into a safe, convenient crossing.
Definitely out is any chance of a subway
under the highway as this would leave an un
sightly hole near the entrance. Obviously, then,
the alternative is to let University Avenue go
under the tracks and then over the highway.
This would eliminate canker sores on Stan
ford's beloved entrance; would at the same time
allow both local and highway traffic to pro
ceed without danger of accident or inconven
ience of long-interval stop signs.
If the train underpass alone is constructed —
it will be a convenience, but no solution to Palo
Alto traffic problems. —J. R.
