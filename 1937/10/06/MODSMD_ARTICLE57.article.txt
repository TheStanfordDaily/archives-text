■ JACK in the days when tailor and blacksmith were
the same man, it was customary for enterprising
knights to go out and start trouble with any ogres re
ported to be distressing ladies. But after a while the
ogres got a new coach, and the knight alumni started
meddling with the team. And in the fullness of time,
knight errantry became definitely out of fashion.
It is with considerable trepidation that I revive the
knightly spirit and sally forth to lend some distressed
maidens a hand. But a number of fair damsels on the
campus report that the oppression of the famous Ogre
Lockout has become intolerable, and their plight stirs
the knight in me.
* # * *
One of the many cries of women's leaders is that
more women must take part in campus activities. This
theme crops up in Conference and Council meetings
almost as often as the words "Alma Mater." And al
ways it is accompanied by the sad plaint that women
just won't get out and participate in campus affairs.
Most of the campus agrees that our activities would
benefit from the refining feminine touch. In these
days of co-education and woman suffrage, of woman
athletes and politicians, an entirely masculine organi
zation feels out of step with the times. The campus
waits impatiently for fluffy heads and trim ankles to
brighten dark committee rooms and benighted publica
tions' offices .

|>UT here, the Ogre Lockout gets down to some se
rious distressing. According to present ruling, an
activity gives a girl at best only one 1:30 leave a
week. If she ventures from the triple bolted sanctuary
of her dormitory at any other time, she exhausts her
small store of lockouts. Exceptions are rarely made,
and with an expenditure of red-tape that would shame
a relief administrator.
Unfortunately, our campus organizations were not
designed to make a 10:30 deadline. Committees have a
way of wrangling contentedly into the dawn's early
light. Despite valiant effort, the Daily has never man
aged to get a paper together in 20 minutes so that its
female helpers could scurry home on time. Dire
tales from the Chappie office relate the agonies of work
at 4 o'clock in the morning of the deadline day.
* * *
And so, as soon as a girl rises above the stooge
rank in campus activities, she finds that negligence on
somebody's part has resulted in a day of only 24 in
adequate hours. It does not require the exercise of
any startling logic to discover why more women do not
participate in activities.
If we admit women to the University at all, we
ought to give them the same chances the men get.
Not to do so is un-American, unconstitutional, and a
damn nuisance. Of course, there are probably plenty
of girls content to retreat to Lagunita at 10:30. But
if women want to tnke part in campus activities, they
will have to arrange for a later bedtime. After all,
they nro big girls now.

If we admit women to the University at all, we
ought to give them the same chances the men get.
Not to do so is un-American, unconstitutional, and a
damn nuisance. Of course, there are probably plenty
of girls content to retreat to Lagunita at 10:30. But

■ JACK in the days when tailor and blacksmith were
the same man, it was customary for enterprising
knights to go out and start trouble with any ogres re
ported to be distressing ladies. But after a while the
ogres got a new coach, and the knight alumni started
meddling with the team. And in the fullness of time,
knight errantry became definitely out of fashion.
It is with considerable trepidation that I revive the
knightly spirit and sally forth to lend some distressed
maidens a hand. But a number of fair damsels on the
campus report that the oppression of the famous Ogre
Lockout has become intolerable, and their plight stirs
the knight in me.

One of the many cries of women's leaders is that
more women must take part in campus activities. This
theme crops up in Conference and Council meetings
almost as often as the words "Alma Mater." And al
ways it is accompanied by the sad plaint that women
just won't get out and participate in campus affairs.
Most of the campus agrees that our activities would
benefit from the refining feminine touch. In these
days of co-education and woman suffrage, of woman
athletes and politicians, an entirely masculine organi
zation feels out of step with the times. The campus
waits impatiently for fluffy heads and trim ankles to
brighten dark committee rooms and benighted publica
tions' offices .

|>UT here, the Ogre Lockout gets down to some se
rious distressing. According to present ruling, an
activity gives a girl at best only one 1:30 leave a
week. If she ventures from the triple bolted sanctuary
of her dormitory at any other time, she exhausts her
small store of lockouts. Exceptions are rarely made,
and with an expenditure of red-tape that would shame
a relief administrator.
Unfortunately, our campus organizations were not
designed to make a 10:30 deadline. Committees have a
way of wrangling contentedly into the dawn's early
light. Despite valiant effort, the Daily has never man
aged to get a paper together in 20 minutes so that its
female helpers could scurry home on time. Dire
tales from the Chappie office relate the agonies of work
at 4 o'clock in the morning of the deadline day.
* * *
And so, as soon as a girl rises above the stooge
rank in campus activities, she finds that negligence on
somebody's part has resulted in a day of only 24 in
adequate hours. It does not require the exercise of
any startling logic to discover why more women do not
participate in activities.
If we admit women to the University at all, we
ought to give them the same chances the men get.
Not to do so is un-American, unconstitutional, and a
