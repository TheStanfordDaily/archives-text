¥N CONNECTION with trying out for the Daily, most
of the living groups on the campus were informed
of the fact that there was to be such a trying out. On
the phone the afternoon before, an executive of the
Daily asked for the president of one of the Row or
ganizations. The reply was prompt:
"What's his name?"
At the same tryoutee meeting, when it came to a
close, the Woman's Editor walked down the stairs of
the Journalism Building with one of the young gentle
men trying out. Before he left her, he said: "Are all
Woman's Editors as beautiful as you?"
Although the gentleman's name is not known by
all these presents, the Daily hopes it will have such a
soul with it for a long time.
One member of the Daily's sense-of-humorist busi
ness stall is given to writing little notes and hanging
them on nails outside the office door. These are for the
distributors of the paper to read in the wee hours of
the morning.
The gentleman must like the women, for he says:
"Deliver thirty (30) every day to the Sororities and to
Madrono. We won't worry about the fraternities yet."
Or perhaps its another evidence of the Hall-Row
Split.
TVIUMEROUS things occur at the Union, but one day
a hasher came up to the counter where a friend
of mine was sitting and asked: "Are you the guys that
ordered a blue-plate-special and asked me to put
something on it?"
Then there was the bloke that called the Kappa
house on the phone, saying he was Bill Shakespeare,
and inquiring as to the possibility for him to get a
blind date, come Friday.
The Kappa who answered said she was afraid she
couldn't make it, but there might be someone —well,
she'd ask. Yes, Gertie could make it.
"Well," said Bill, easing back in his chair, "that's
fine. Does she smoke?"
"I guess so."
"Does she drink?"
"It sounds like it."
"Well, what's her name?"
"Gertrude Stein."
Bill hung up.

all these presents, the Daily hopes it will have such a
soul with it for a long time.
One member of the Daily's sense-of-humorist busi
ness stall is given to writing little notes and hanging
them on nails outside the office door. These are for the
distributors of the paper to read in the wee hours of
the morning.
The gentleman must like the women, for he says:
"Deliver thirty (30) every day to the Sororities and to
Madrono. We won't worry about the fraternities yet."
Or perhaps its another evidence of the Hall-Row
Split.
TVIUMEROUS things occur at the Union, but one day
a hasher came up to the counter where a friend
of mine was sitting and asked: "Are you the guys that
ordered a blue-plate-special and asked me to put
something on it?"
Then there was the bloke that called the Kappa
house on the phone, saying he was Bill Shakespeare,
and inquiring as to the possibility for him to get a
blind date, come Friday.
The Kappa who answered said she was afraid she
couldn't make it, but there might be someone —well,
she'd ask. Yes, Gertie could make it.
"Well," said Bill, easing back in his chair, "that's
fine. Does she smoke?"
"I guess so."
"Does she drink?"
"It sounds like it."
"Well, what's her name?"
"Gertrude Stein."
Bill hung up.
