# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'GOSH! FELLERS!' 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Whoever the .agitated Mr. Polin
may be, he presents no arguments
to make me change the opinions I
put forth in this column on Monday.
Moreover, his letter degenerates
into a childish broadside of the "Yah.
yah, nuts to you!" school, and while
calling names is of course much
easier than thinking, I fail to see
why it should be given the same
consideration.
"Take Mr. Roth, now," he says,
"doesn't he look just like the orig
inal fiend incarnate, and isn't it cun
ning the way that Dr. Wilbur ap
pears to be sticking a knife into
the middle of his very own back?"
After such a masterly analysis of
the problem, all I can say is, "Gosh,
feller?!"
My letter at least attempted to be
constructive; and after all, I do like
the place. I wasn't writing just to
see myself in Campus Opinion. I do
sincerely feel that the present policy
of the administration is a mistaken
one, and I think that student opinion
on that subject is a good deal more
important than many of the things
which ordinarily engage the Farm's
attention in this column.
To A Certain Reporter, my apol
ogies for perhaps being a little too
vitriolic in my comments on Mr.
Roth. To Mr. Roth himself, apolo
gies for laying the blame for the
pavement incident at the wrong
door. My opinion concerning his fit
ness for the position of comptroller
of a place of learning, however, to
which that was only a minor con
tributary cause, remains unchanged.
The Daily itself at last admits that
Mr. Roth s "not an educator, not an
academician, and never has been."
1 think that sums up my own argu
ment very well. If you want a schol
astic machine-shop, take Mr. Roth;
if you want a university, take some
one else.
To O. B. Cope, apologies for using
his name, and condolences on the
"incorrect associations in the minds
of Daily readers." Since I am evi
dently destined for immortality un
der that name, however, I am afraid
you must put up with it as best you
can. "Cope" is not O. B. Cope, read
ers. That's the best I can do.
If Mr. Polin cares to return to bat
tle with a little less sizzle and a little
more sense, I shall be glad to argue
with him.
Cope
