# GIVE 'EM THE AXE

### 
In this day and age of rapid
shelving of traditions, it is with a
tear in my eye, that I notice the
passing of another of the age-old
customs; that of the Daily attempt
ing to arouse spirit at the games.
Bull-Sessioner's article Monday
morning was quite a blow. Perhaps
we are getting to be modern and
cosmopolitan and just a bit above
any visible display of enthusiasm.
I'm sui'e there would be enough
shouting if the B.A.C. were to abol
ish the rooting section, and again
by the end of the week plenty of
alumnae will have added their pro
tests to this one of mine. When we
sneer at "rah-rah" stuff, it might be
well to remember that the members
of the team don't exactly live the life
of Riley, but they work hard enough
to deserve all the support the stu
dents can give them. 'And our fine
athletic plants, as well as Toyon and
Branner Halls didn't grow by them
selves, but are the results of plenty
of shouting by former Stanfordites.
It is all well enough to laugh at
"bleating" but it mustn't be forgot
ten that after graduation we will all
come to the football games as our
only available contact with the "old
school," and we too will leave the
office on Saturday afternoon to see
the game, and we too will say that
the trouble with college nowadays
is "lack of spirit."
"Come Join the Band" isn't the
yell-leader's song, or the band's, but
Stanford's, and Ransohoff doesn't
lead yells for his own amusement,
but for students. They are your
songs, your yells, and your team,
just as much a part of Stanford as
you are, and it should be your pleas
ure as well as your duty to support
them, and rooting sections are a
darn good way of supporting.

Bull-Sessioner's article was very
well written, a fine literary effort,
but a helluva article to find in the
Stanford Daily.

P.S.: While I'm at it, since when
has the Axe Yell been restricted to
the Cal game?
