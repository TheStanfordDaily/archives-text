The Editor, Sir:
In view of your say-nothing edi
torial this morning, and in view of
Mr. Cobbs* wandering Bull Session
concerning Mr. Cope (?) and his
little epistle, I feel it my part to
enter objections. It seems to me
that no consideration was given to
the fact that the man was serious.
Maybe he's wrong, I agree with
him to a certain extent. Cobbs may
be right when he says this is the end
of the era of building, but how does
he know? What makes him think
so? Certainly the plans of building
haven't dropped from the subject of
conversation. And what about im
proving the lighting, etc., in the
classrooms. I haven't yet been in a
classroom where there was enough
light to read by. Well, have you?
Certainly his criticism is just. Why
not find out about it.
