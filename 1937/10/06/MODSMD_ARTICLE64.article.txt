# Music Thrills, Story Weak In Durbin Film
## 
### 
'10(1 MEN AND A GIRL," at the
Orpheum, starring Deanna Durbin
and Leopold Slokowski, combines
sublime music of the great masters
with a poor plot, slightly pepped up
wtih a few humorous lines.
Deanna herself is at her best as
she sings "Allelluja in F Major" by
Mozart. Later, to a cab driver who
is nonplussed by the title, she ex
plains that "it's just plain Hallelu
jah."
Stokowski plays the piano him
self, and directs two symphony or
chestras in a variety of compositions
from "Lohengrin" to Liszt's "Hun
garian Rhapsody" and the photogra
pher takes full advantage of the
famous hands throughout.
The director thought one se
quence, involving Stokowski's sur
prise at the quality of Durbin's voice,
and his return to directing his or
chestra, while watching her, was so
good that he repeated the idea when
Stokowski first heard the "100 Men"
symphony.
Comedy, and big eyes, are supplied
by Mischa Auer, formerly known as
the Ape Man, now a flute player.
The comedy is not the best, but the
big eyes are tremendous.
Adolph Menjou is the fond father,
and organizer of the unemployed
symphony. He also plays the trom
bone, and hits a prospective sponsor
on the nose.
Audiences leave, thrilled by the
music, and not at all disappointed
by the absence of plot in the picture.
In fact, it isn't even noticeable, for
watchers and listeners burst into
conversation about the music in the
dull spots, which, incidentally, seem
to be spaced just right for that pur
pose.
