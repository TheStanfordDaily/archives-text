# Club Spends $5000 Yearly On Students
## Stanford Mothers Aid Needy Students By Raising Annual Sums 
### BARBARA ROSENBLATT 
An expenditure of over $5000 a
year for students since its inception
in 1924, and a present membership
of 1,680, is the record of the Stanford
Mothers Club, which is sponsoring
"Murder in the Cathedral" and "Trial
by Jury" as part of this year's ac
tivities.
Purpose of the club is "to bring to
gether its members in social and in
tellectual intercourse; to keep in
close touch with the University life;
and in all practicable ways to aid the
University authorities in promoting
the welfai'e of the student body."
Three Purposes
To these ends, the club is devoted
to raising funds for three main uses
— scholarship, welfare, and Rest
Homes. Dollar a year dues are as
sessed each member, many of
whom send additional money as
gifts.
Other income sources are two
yearly benefits, one in the fall and
one in the spring. The fall festival
usually takes the form of Chrysan
themum Fete, but this year is being
replaced by sponsorship of the two
plays to be presented October 29
and 30. Garden parties are usually
held in the spring, climaxed last
May with a party and an historic
pageant at the Ogden L. Miils es
tate in Millbrae.
$1000 Budget
Yearly scholarship budget is $1000,
with which the Club aids needy stu
dents in paying tuition and com
munity fees and buying books. The
Welfare committee is also allotted
$1000, which is spent in caring for
more personal needs of students —
dentist and doctor bills, room rent,
and clothing. The latter is distrib
uted to needy students through the
office of the Dean of Men and all
matters pertaining to the distribu
tion are held strictly confidential.
To the students in general, prob
ably the most outstanding service
performed by the Mothers' Club is
the maintenance of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes. Both homes*
are under the direct supervision of
the Student Health Service and
provide opportunity for rest and per
sonal care for convalescing or
fatigued students. Last year the
club spent over $2,800 on the Rest
Homes, and took care of nearly
eight hundred students.
Thus the Stanford Mothers' Club,
with members all over the United
States and in five foreign countries,
does its part in caring for the
Stanford student.

tellectual intercourse; to keep in
close touch with the University life;
and in all practicable ways to aid the
University authorities in promoting
the welfai'e of the student body."
Three Purposes
To these ends, the club is devoted
to raising funds for three main uses
— scholarship, welfare, and Rest
Homes. Dollar a year dues are as
sessed each member, many of
whom send additional money as
gifts.
Other income sources are two
yearly benefits, one in the fall and
one in the spring. The fall festival
usually takes the form of Chrysan
themum Fete, but this year is being
replaced by sponsorship of the two
plays to be presented October 29
and 30. Garden parties are usually
held in the spring, climaxed last
May with a party and an historic
pageant at the Ogden L. Miils es
tate in Millbrae.
$1000 Budget
Yearly scholarship budget is $1000,
with which the Club aids needy stu
dents in paying tuition and com
munity fees and buying books. The
Welfare committee is also allotted
$1000, which is spent in caring for
more personal needs of students —
dentist and doctor bills, room rent,
and clothing. The latter is distrib
uted to needy students through the
office of the Dean of Men and all
matters pertaining to the distribu
tion are held strictly confidential.
To the students in general, prob
ably the most outstanding service
performed by the Mothers' Club is
the maintenance of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes. Both homes*
are under the direct supervision of
the Student Health Service and
provide opportunity for rest and per
sonal care for convalescing or
fatigued students. Last year the
club spent over $2,800 on the Rest
Homes, and took care of nearly
eight hundred students.
Thus the Stanford Mothers' Club,
with members all over the United
States and in five foreign countries,
does its part in caring for the
Stanford student.
An expenditure of over $5000 a
year for students since its inception
in 1924, and a present membership
of 1,680, is the record of the Stanford
Mothers Club, which is sponsoring
"Murder in the Cathedral" and "Trial
by Jury" as part of this year's ac
tivities.
Purpose of the club is "to bring to
gether its members in social and in
tellectual intercourse; to keep in
close touch with the University life;
and in all practicable ways to aid the
University authorities in promoting
the welfai'e of the student body."
