# Mountaineers Ruled Guilty
## Brite Brothers Will Die For Triple Murder 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6 (UP).â€”
Overruling technical objections, the
State Supreme Court of California
today ruled that John and Coke
Brite, mountaineer brothers, must
die for the triple slaying in their
impromptu camp at Horse Creek in
Siskiyou County last year.
The brothers, convicted of first
degree murder at Yreka, are in
Folsom Prison awaiting setting of
the date for their execution.
As the slayings occurred/ before a
new lethal gas execution law be
came effective, they will be hanged
unless they obtain executive clem
ency.
They killed Martin Lang and Joe
Clark, Yreka deputy sheriffs and
Fred Seaborn, Vallejo hunter, who
sought to arrest the pair on charges
of battery involved in a fight with
a neighbor. The Brites fled into the
mountains after the shooting and
one of the state's greatest man hunts
failed to capture them. After the
search had been abandoned, they
surrendered.
