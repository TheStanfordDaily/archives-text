# Whittler Whittles Away Spare Time
## 
### 
DULUTH, Minn. (UP). â€” Time
hung heavily on Harris V. Johnson's
hands during the depression, so like
many another young man he took
to whittling.
His whittling, however, was not
the stove-side variety.
He sharpened his jacknife, picked
up some pieces of wood, and started
to carve models of fishermen he
knew, miniature axes and two-man
saws, and plaques.
Johnsort says he learned some
thing during those "idle" moments.
