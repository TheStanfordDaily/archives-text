# Chaplain Quits Play; Cahn To Take Lead
## 
### 
"It is not true that I will play the leading role in 'Murder in the
Cathedral.'
"I fully agree with the Stanford Daily editorial that student plays
should be played by students."
With these words Dr. I). Elton Truehlood retired yesterday from the
cast of the first regular play to he staged in the Memorial Theater under

*the direction of the new Department
! of Speech and Drama. The reorgan
ized cast headed by J. P. Cahn was
announced last night by Gordon C.
Lange.
The chaplain's selection for the
lead in T. S. Eliot's drama of the
twelfth century was announced last
Friday. An editorial questioning his
! selection appeared in Monday's
Daily.
Assured of Precedent
Dr. Trueblood emphasized that he
had been hesitant about accepting
j the part but that he had been as
sured that there was precedent for
faculty participation in plays at
Stanford. Dr. Margery Bailey was
in the cast of "Reunion in Vienna,"
I which was produced as a reading
; here last summer, and other faculty
! members have appeared at intervals
in student plays.
But because he believed that stu
j dent opinion opposed faculty partici
pation, Dr. Trueblood said, he made
i his.decision to retire from the play.
Wanted Star Cast
| Since the proceeds of one show
, ing of "Murder in the Cathedral"
i will go to the Stanford Mothers'
Club, Director Lange said, he had
hoped to give the play its best pos
sible production.
Although Cahn, who will replace
j Dr. Trueblood in the role of Thom
as a Beckett in the play, has spe
cialized, for the most part, in tech
nical work in Stanford dramatics,
he was cast in a role in "Lady
Px-ecious Stream," produced last
spring.
He was assistant stage manager of
the summer production of "Twelfth
| Night" and has been an active mem
j ber of Rams Head and Barnstorm
ers.
Musical Holes Cast
Principal parts in "Trial by Jury,"
Gilbert and Sullivan musical that
will be the second half of the double
bill to be given this month, were
also assigned last night. H. Miles
Hebrer, who has directed similar
I productions at the University of
Illinois and at Kansas State, will be
in charge.
"Trial by Jury" players include:
Angelena — plaintiff, Audis Davis;
Edwin — defendant, George Knoles;
Judge, James K. Barnum; Usher,
