"It is not true that I will play the leading role in 'Murder in the
Cathedral.'

should be played by students."
With these words Dr. I). Elton Truehlood retired yesterday from the
cast of the first regular play to he staged in the Memorial Theater under

*the direction of the new Department
! of Speech and Drama. The reorgan
ized cast headed by J. P. Cahn was

I which was produced as a reading
; here last summer, and other faculty

i his.decision to retire from the play.

"It is not true that I will play the leading role in 'Murder in the
Cathedral.'
"I fully agree with the Stanford Daily editorial that student plays
should be played by students."
With these words Dr. I). Elton Truehlood retired yesterday from the
cast of the first regular play to he staged in the Memorial Theater under

*the direction of the new Department
! of Speech and Drama. The reorgan
ized cast headed by J. P. Cahn was
announced last night by Gordon C.
Lange.
The chaplain's selection for the
lead in T. S. Eliot's drama of the
twelfth century was announced last
Friday. An editorial questioning his
! selection appeared in Monday's
Daily.
Assured of Precedent
Dr. Trueblood emphasized that he
had been hesitant about accepting
j the part but that he had been as
sured that there was precedent for
faculty participation in plays at
Stanford. Dr. Margery Bailey was
in the cast of "Reunion in Vienna,"
I which was produced as a reading
; here last summer, and other faculty
! members have appeared at intervals
in student plays.
But because he believed that stu
j dent opinion opposed faculty partici
pation, Dr. Trueblood said, he made
i his.decision to retire from the play.
Wanted Star Cast
| Since the proceeds of one show
, ing of "Murder in the Cathedral"

sible production.

j Dr. Trueblood in the role of Thom
as a Beckett in the play, has spe
cialized, for the most part, in tech
nical work in Stanford dramatics,
he was cast in a role in "Lady

spring.

ers.
