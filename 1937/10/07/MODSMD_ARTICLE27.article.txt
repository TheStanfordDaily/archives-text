# U.S. Places War Blame On Japanese
## State Department Labels Nippon as Aggressor In War with Chinese 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. (i (U.R).—The
United States government tonight
threw its support behind efforts of
the League of Nations to end Chi
nese-Japanese hostilities when it
formally branded Japan as the ag
gressor in the conflict and accused
her of violating the nine-power
treaty and the Kellogg-Briand anti
war pact.
In a statement striking out at what
President Roosevelt had described
as "world lawlessness," the State
Department publicly accused an
other nation of treaty violation for
the first time since post-war peace
machinery has been in effect.
The issuance of the statement was
not interpreted as indicating pos
sible invocation of the Neutrality
Act, which would place automatic
embargoes on exports of arms, am
munition and implements of war to
both Japan and China. This, in the
opinion of diplomats, would injure
China more than Japan since the
latter has a naval advantage in get
ting war matexials to its shores.
The president's speech aroused
mixed reaction in this country, with
some newspapers uttering the fear
that the nation was risking involve
ment in war and could not co-oper
ate with the League without going
to war. In general, however, the
president's attitude was approved to
a far greater extent than any domes
tic policy.
