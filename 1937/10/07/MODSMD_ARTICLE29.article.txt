# JAPAN TO RESIST FOREIGN OPPOSITION
## 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, Oct. 7 (U.R).â€”
Japan is prepared to resist, with
arms if necessary, any effort by the
United States or other powers or
groups of powers to force her to
halt her war with China, a survey
of opinion here indicated today.
The Japanese attitude is that the
Chinese undeclared war must be
carried through to a smashing vic
tory, as quickly as possible, "come
what may."
