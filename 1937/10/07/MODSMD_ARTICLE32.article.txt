# Roosevelt May Call Congress For November
## Special Session Called To Fix Crop Control, Supreme Court Bill 
### 
HYDE PARK, N.Y., Oct. 6 (U.R).—
President Roosevelt said today he is
considering calling a special session
of Congress, starting between No
vember 8 and 16, to consider crop
control, wages and hours, govern
ment reorganization, regional plan
ning—and possibly a new court bill.
The president made his thoughts
known at a special press conference
on the front porch of his country
home here immediately after he re
turned from a 6,000-mile train and
automobile trip to the Pacific North
west and back.
Mr. Roosevelt said his definite de
cision on the special session question
would be made between the time
he arrives in Washington aboard his
special train Friday morning and
when he comes back to his Hyde

Park home the night of October 12.
Mr. Roosevelt was less specific on
his court plans. He said his trip
convinced him the country wanted
quicker and cheaper justice. He
pointed to recommendations that
from 12 to 24 judges be added to
federal court lists as a possibility for
congressional consideration.
