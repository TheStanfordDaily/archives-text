## Craft Unions Injured, Not Protected, By Government Rulings 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 6 (UP). — The
American Federation of Labor con
vention today indicated its resolve
to seek amendment <jf the Wagner
Act insuring the right of craft un
ions to obtain collective bargaining
representation.
The temper of the federation was
evinced when 700 convention dele
gates enthusiastically applauded a
critique of (he law by Judge Joseph
Padway, Milwaukee attorney who
has represented the A. F. of L. in
several cases before the National
Labor Relations Board.
"I think we are now finding our
selves in a sort of governmental
straight jacket," Padway said, re
ferring to board decisions which have
tended to bolster the bargaining fit
ness of the C.1.0. industrial union
scheme.
"You are better off to see the Wag
ner Act repealed than turned into a
paternalistic straight jacket."
The delegates cheered Padway's
address loudly in contrast to the fal
tering applause afforded a defense of
the N.L.R.B. yesterday by Chairman
J. Warren Madden. Immediately af
ter the labor counsel had finished
speaking, Chauncey A. Weaver of
Des Moines, la., representing the
American Federation of Musicians,
took the floor.
"I would like to ask," he shouted,
"whether there was ever any case
in which the C.1.0. was pitted against
the A. F. of L. in which the A. F.
of L. won at the hands of the Labor
Board?"
When President William Green
assured him he was not qualified to
answer, Weaver continued:
"Is not organized labor justified in
believing that the National Labor
Relations Board was established for
the purpose of promoting the C.1.0.?
Are we not justified in repeating the
phrase of Madame Roland: 'Ah Lib
erty, what crimes are committed in
thy name'?"
"I think that is very appropriate,"
Green replied.
