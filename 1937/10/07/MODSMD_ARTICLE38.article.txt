# 'Last Breakfast' Strayed or Stolen
## 
### 
Among the historical relics and j
world-wide souvenirs found in the !
Leland Stanford Junior Museum I
there is a tale equally as unique as
the relics themselves.
History has it that many years
ago, Leland Stanford's last break
fast, the proverbial ham and eggs,
reposed among his personal belong
ings in the museum. In reality it i
was a painted alabaster imitation i
from Italy, so dubbed "the last
breakfast" by the students.
Stanford students, the underdogs |
at a Cal game, were asked if they I
had forgotten to eat their last '
breakfast. Soon after this insult the
plate disappeared, never to be seen
again these 25 years.

Freshmen entering U.C.L.A. are
required to take an "athletic ability
test" to determine what sport they
may go out for.
