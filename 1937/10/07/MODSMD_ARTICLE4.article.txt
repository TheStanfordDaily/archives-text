# Niggli to Talk On Mexican Theater Art
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Josephina Niggli, a charming Mex
ican senorita with the accent of a
North Carolinan, will present a lec
ture-recital on the theaters of Mex
ico in the Little Theater of Memorial
Hall at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
Miss Niggli worked as production
assistant to the director of the Uni
versity of Mexico's drama depart
ment during the summer. Tonight
she will informally present her im
pressions of the three types of Mex
ican playhouses: the city theaters,
the little theaters that are begin
ning to come into existence through
out Mexico, and the village folk
theaters.
A native of Monterey, Mexico,
Miss Niggli is at Stanford on a
Rockefeller scholarship to write
plays based on Mexican folklore.
What attracted her to the Farm? â€”
the facilities of the new theater, the
increasing interest in drama here,
and the south-of-the-Rio Grande
climate.
Her last two years have been spent
touring the East with the Carolina
Playmakers, a professional incorpo
rated troupe from the University of
North Carolina, under Sam Selden,
famed director of the Department of
Drama of the University and the
author of the standard texts on act
ing and play production.
One of her plays was on the rep
ertory of the group; another was
published in the July issue of the
"One-act Play Magazine." A vol
ume of Miss Niggli's works, called
"Mexican Folk Plays," will roll off
the University of Carolina Press in
November.
This unique playwright is on the
board of directors of the San An
tonio Little Theater and has done
little theater work in Mexico City
and Monterey. She attended the
University of North Carolina and
received her M.A. in drama there.
All students and the public will
be welcomed at tonight's lecture
recital.
