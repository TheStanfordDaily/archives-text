# Deutschland Dubious Over F.R.'s Speech
## Nazi Spokesman Says U.S. Ignorant Of Feuhrers Intentions 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 6 (U.R).—The Ger
man government, through a spokes
man for the propaganda ministry,
expressed skepticism today over the
practical value to peace of President
Roosevelt's Chicago speech.
"There probably will be some re
action in the press," the spokesman
said, "but we have suffered so many
disappointments thus far in the
world's failure to grasp the construc
tive suggestions made by the Fueh
rer in at least five big speeches that
we now are somewhat skeptical of
peace speeches in general."
The German press virtually ig
nored the Roosevelt speech.
One morning newspaper, in one
edition, published the news that
President Roosevelt had made a
speech on international problems
that had caused a world sensation.
In its first edition the Berliner
Tageblatt published a dispatch on
the speech and this comment:
"Specific reference to the Kellogg
Pact and the Nine-Power Pact indi
cates that the moral reproaches
voiced by the President this time
are less theoretical than on earlier
occasions.
"It would be welcomed if the
United States would henceforth take
a more active interest, not based on
one-sided information which pre
sents things in distorted perspective.
Apart from this it is welcomed in
this country that the United States
throws its full weight into the bal
ance against trouble mongers in the
world."
Speech and comment were omit
ted in later editions and other news
papers ignored the speech.
