ODDS AND ENDS . . .
Harlan Dykes, first Stanford grad
uate ever to take over mentoring
duties at St. Mary's, is the new bas
ketball coach in Moraga.
Dykes is the old Santa Clara ca
saba coach and, with his switch to
the Gaels, you can see what will be
built around that. The Bronco-Gael
rivalry is to independent circles
what the Indian-Bear feuding is to
us.
He owes no particular allegiance
to Santa Clara. He started his coach
ing in San Francisco prep schools
after graduating from Stanford,
where he was a high jumper.
Dykes is a great coach and prob
ably knows as much about basket
ball as anybody in the world. His
Bronco teams were no push-overs.
TWO STANFORD
STATE GOLF CHAMPS
College golfers have a monopoly
on the California amateur golf
championship. Since 1932 students
have won the title and generally
their opponents in the finals have
been collegians. Two of these champs
were Stanford divot diggers.
Charley Seaver won the title in
1933 and Stuart Hawley came
through in 1934. In 1932, Neil White
of U.S.C. captured the crown. Jack
Gaines of Glendale - Junior College
was the winner in 1935, and in 1936
Matt Palacio of the University of
San Francisco annexed the title.
BRUINS HAND OUT
LETTERS GALORE
If football teams' strength were
determined by lettermen lost and
returning each year, the Oregon
State Beavers would really have a
championship outfit. Through grad
uation the Beaver squad only lost
four men and had 20 lettermne com
ing back for this season. Another
interesting note in the statistics
comes from the Bruin lair down in
West wood. The Bruins handed out
no less than 39 letters to gridders
last year. Twenty four were given
to Tiny's footballers here on the
Farm.
The Uclans lost 13 lettermen
through graduation and had 26 re
turning. Stanford lost 8 and had 16
returning.

PAGING GARNIER,
HICKINGBOTHAM, PAULMAN
A San Francisco newspaper some
time ago printed a column on the
sports page that gave the ladies'
viewpoint on the most handsome of
Tiny's 1937 crew of footballers. The
verdict favoi-ed Ed Gamier and
Howard Hickingbotham as the ex
ponents of the dark and handsome
types, and Bill Paulman upholding
the blond section.
