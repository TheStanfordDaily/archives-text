# Hoop Coach Ready To Choose Team
## 
### 
From the 40 candidates, mostly
veterans, who turned out for varsity
basketball practice in the Pavilion
for the first time Tuesday, Coach
John Bunn is ready to mold his
third consecutive championship
team.
All of last year's' varsity but the
four men who graduated, Roberts,
Moore, Quade, and Turner, came
out to practice as did all of last
year's frosh squad. Coach Bunn will
hold what he calls "fundamental
drill practice" most of this quarter
in sessions coming three times a
week.
