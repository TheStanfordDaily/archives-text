# Yanks Triumph, 8-1
## AND BACK ON THE FARM.... Yanks' 7-Run Rally in 6th Fells Giants 8-1 Slaughter Batters Carl Hubbell Down 
### 
YANKEE STADIUM, New York,
Oct. 6 (U.R).—Shackled for five in
nings by Carl Hubbell's mound wiz
ardry, the New York Yankees staged
a thundering seven-run rally in the
sixth frame, blasted Hubbell from
the mound and beat the New York
Giants, 8-1, before 60,573 fans today
in the opening game of the fifth
all-New York World Series.
Until that inning, the Giants'
screwball king had allowed "mur
derers' row" only one hit and the
crowd had witnessed a grand south
paw pitching duel between Hub
bell and the Yanks' fireball fiinger,
Lefty Gomez. When the 34-year-old
Oklahoman weakened in the sixth,
the entire Yankee line-up batted
around in a rally typical of the
Bronx Bombers — interspersed with
five hits, three walks and two er
rors, When they were done with
Hubbell and two pitchers who suc
ceeded him, Harry Gumbert and
Dick Coffman, they had sewed up
the game.
The Yanks made their final tally
off the fourth Giant pitcher, A1
Smith, in the eighth inning when
Tony Lazzeri, the veteran second
baseman, produced the only home
run of the game.
Senor Vernon Gomez, the "goofy
Castilian" from Rodeo, California,
pitched the grandest game of his
career. He allowed six scattered
hits and one walk to the National
League champions in winning his
fourth series contest.

University of California statisti
tians have fixed the high school age
as being the "dangerous age" for ac
cidents.
