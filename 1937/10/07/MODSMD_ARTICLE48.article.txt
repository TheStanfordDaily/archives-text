# Farm Athlete "Enjoys" Rainy Japanese Meets
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Playing in dirty weather has been the fate at some time or other of
all athletes whose specialties are outdoor games. But very few indeed are
those short-trousered running and jumping gentlemen who can emit
any squawks because they had to do their duty in a roaring gale or on a
track flooded with water.
One who is justly entitled to several loud screams is Stanford's Jack
Weiershauser, who spent four weeks this summer track-meeting in Japan

He went in company with 14 other
track stars, all winners in this
spring's A.A.U. classic at Milwaukee.
The squad participated in four
meets —two in Tokyo, one in Osaka,
and one in Nagoya. Opponents in
three of the four meets were track
men in the Japanese equivalent of
the A.A.U. In the fourth encounter,
the Americans did their stuff against
the stars of one of Japan's big col
leges.
'Just a Drizzle'
Ample reason for the Red Racer's
screams was a typhoon, the tail-end
of which whipped a 40-mile zephyr
across the track at the Nagoya meet.
But that wasn't all. At Osaka, every
thing went fine for about one-half
of the meet. Then it started to rain.
Not for long, mind you, but when
the H2O finished drenching the at
mosphere, there remained a mere
four inches of water on the track.
Just a drizzle.
Little time was left between
meets, each of which lasted two
days, for the Yanks to ferret through
the Nippon cities. Dinners and sight
seeing tours were given in their
honor wherever they went. How
ever, snooping around evidently was
definitely not the correct thing to do,
if the number of secret police and
soldiers seen meant anything, ac

cording to the Farm speedstei - 's re
port.
'Swell Trip'
Each track meet included 17
events. Having only 15 men, the
American squad had to double up.
Consequently, Stanford's Weier
shauser found himself running in
five events each meet—loo meters,
200 meters, 400 meter hurdles, sprint
relay, and 400 meter relay.
"It was a swell trip and we had a
wonderful time," enthused the sprint
ace as he ducked for cover from the
heavy, heavy fog, "but when it
comes to typhoons and cloudbursts,
I much prefer California's weather
with its warm sunshine. Yeah mani"

five events each meet—loo meters,
200 meters, 400 meter hurdles, sprint
relay, and 400 meter relay.
"It was a swell trip and we had a
wonderful time," enthused the sprint
ace as he ducked for cover from the
heavy, heavy fog, "but when it
comes to typhoons and cloudbursts,
I much prefer California's weather
with its warm sunshine. Yeah mani"
Playing in dirty weather has been the fate at some time or other of
all athletes whose specialties are outdoor games. But very few indeed are
those short-trousered running and jumping gentlemen who can emit
any squawks because they had to do their duty in a roaring gale or on a
track flooded with water.
One who is justly entitled to several loud screams is Stanford's Jack
Weiershauser, who spent four weeks this summer track-meeting in Japan

He went in company with 14 other
track stars, all winners in this
spring's A.A.U. classic at Milwaukee.
The squad participated in four
meets —two in Tokyo, one in Osaka,
and one in Nagoya. Opponents in
three of the four meets were track
men in the Japanese equivalent of
the A.A.U. In the fourth encounter,
the Americans did their stuff against
the stars of one of Japan's big col
leges.
'Just a Drizzle'
Ample reason for the Red Racer's
screams was a typhoon, the tail-end
of which whipped a 40-mile zephyr
across the track at the Nagoya meet.
But that wasn't all. At Osaka, every
thing went fine for about one-half
of the meet. Then it started to rain.
Not for long, mind you, but when
the H2O finished drenching the at
mosphere, there remained a mere
four inches of water on the track.
Just a drizzle.
Little time was left between
meets, each of which lasted two
days, for the Yanks to ferret through
the Nippon cities. Dinners and sight
seeing tours were given in their
honor wherever they went. How
ever, snooping around evidently was
definitely not the correct thing to do,
if the number of secret police and
soldiers seen meant anything, ac

cording to the Farm speedstei - 's re
port.
'Swell Trip'
Each track meet included 17
events. Having only 15 men, the
American squad had to double up.
Consequently, Stanford's Weier
shauser found himself running in
five events each meet—loo meters,
200 meters, 400 meter hurdles, sprint
relay, and 400 meter relay.
