# Strong Squad Raises Farm Soccer Hopes
## Chance Seen to Regain Championship Honor With Veteran Team 
### 
With one week of practice already
under its belt, Stanford's varsity
soccer team is beginning to whip
into shape for the opening of Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Conference
competition October 16.
Only Captain Bqb Hall and Wayne
Richardson are lost from last year's
team, which wound up the season
with three victories and the same
number of ties and defeats, giving
Coach Harry Maloney a well expe
rienced squad with which to work.
The return of nine out of eleven
first-stringers causes Maloney to be
optimistic about the team's chances
of regaining soccer kiurels which
Stanford held for three consecutive
years, 1931 to 1933.
Heading the list of returning vet
erans is Captain Dave Sloane, half
back and two-year letterman. Back
ing him up are Goalie Lo.uis Faulb,
Halfback George Hatch, and Full
back Karl Schaupp, all-conference
men last year, and Bill Edwards, a
transfer from Oxford. Bill Hamilton
from last year's frosh team is the
only sophomore on the first eleven.
