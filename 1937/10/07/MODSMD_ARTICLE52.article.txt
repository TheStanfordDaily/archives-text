## Mock Bruins Stage Scrum With Varsity Benny McGuire Mimics Uclan Star; Alustiza, Ledeboer To Start 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
You'd have thought Kenny Wash
ington himself, negro star of the
U.C.L.A. backfield, had come north
yesterday to help the Indians in
their rehearsal against Bruin plays.
But no, it was only the squad
comedian, Benny McGuire, with his
face thoroughly blackened with
burnt cork, aping the U.C.L.A.
"Kingfish" at left half on a mock
Bruin team.
A1 Alustiza was back in the first
' string quarter post, indicating that
' he will start there Saturday.
Fred Ledeboer, who this week has
j risen to prominence at right half,
will start against the Bruins in place
I of Ed Gamier, whose ankle is still
| holding him back with a distinct
j limp.
I Grant Stone, mainstay of the Card
line and brains of the team, is still
1 bothered with a cold, but will be
;in his usual right flank post Satur
day.
Irv Cummings and Neil Rasmus
sen, former right end playing be
hind Stone, are still vying for the
privilege of holding the right end
spot on the starting line-up.
