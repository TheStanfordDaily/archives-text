## But Don't Try To Park It 
### 
THE wiseacre who first broadsided a 'ven
omous "drive it or park it" at the obtrusive
roadhog wasn't a Stanford man. He couldn't
have been. He'd have known better than to
urge anything so drastic as parking, because
you can't do that at Stanford. There isn't room.
Ten o'clock near the English corner is a park
ing maze surpassing anything the psych whips
could offer their vermin masters of the maze.
This is too bad. Stanford has only 9000 acres
to play in.
With the building of the Memorial Hall and
Cubberley Education Building two valuable

parking lots disappeared, and in their place
was constructed one rather inaccessible plot
last spring. Now there is need for at least one
other.
Behind the Art Gallery adjoining the present
lot north of the Libe is one possibility, which,
in conjunction with the plan used last spring
when a director of parking supervised the plac
ing of cars, would clean up some of the maze.
I hate to write this edit. The subject is
threadbare and I'm tired of griping. But for
tunately it's short. What Stanford needs, before
far-reaching cultural reform, is a good honest
to-God place to park its cars.
