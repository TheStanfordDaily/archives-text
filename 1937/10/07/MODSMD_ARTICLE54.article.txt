# Whatever "It" Is
## 
### 
NOT the traditional Daily editorial, this has
no bone to pick with campus politicos, no
talk about bumpy roads or the eternal "pay to
the order of"—just a little idea that came the
other day after reading "You Can't Take It With
You" in the current Reader's Digest.
Of course you can't take it with you—every
body at Stanford knows that, just as nobody
knows exactly what "it" is. Interpretations
range from moral success to tangible property,
but none of them are adequate.
The Digest refers to "it" as a knowledge of
how to live—most important feature of which is
an appreciation of the present, a desire to live
now rather than in the future.
This may be as true on the Farm as it is in the
rest of the world. City-bred slickers and campus
cut-ups spend most of their time "having fun"
but it is seldom that a student will admit that his
real life has begun.
Few of Stanford's four thousand students\
seem to think seriously of Today except as a
pathway to Tomorrow. There is a tendency to
minimize the importance of college life;.to think
of college as a sort of limbo, a jumping-off place
to the future.
Perhaps it is because of this that the poten
tialities of the University are not fully utilized.
The realization that life is not a series of stages
but a sort of continuum does not occur. Stuck
fast in an endless rut, the average student at
Stanford is not learning how to live; rather he
is learning how to postpone death.
One can only guess why so few students live
in the present. Though it may be well to ideal
ize the future, it is certainly more desirable to
learn how to live.
This knowledge is the most important ingre
dient of a successful life. Knowing this, Stan
fordites may make an effort to live, and by
living, learn how to live better.—J. R.

The craving for political, economic and spir
itual security is universal. One may doubt
whether a philosophy of continuing change so
challenging to the adventurous-minded will
ever prove satisfying to the non-adventurous
majority.—Marvin L. Darsie

range from moral success to tangible property,
but none of them are adequate.
The Digest refers to "it" as a knowledge of
how to live—most important feature of which is
an appreciation of the present, a desire to live
now rather than in the future.
This may be as true on the Farm as it is in the
rest of the world. City-bred slickers and campus
cut-ups spend most of their time "having fun"
but it is seldom that a student will admit that his
real life has begun.
Few of Stanford's four thousand students\
seem to think seriously of Today except as a
pathway to Tomorrow. There is a tendency to
minimize the importance of college life;.to think
of college as a sort of limbo, a jumping-off place
to the future.
Perhaps it is because of this that the poten
tialities of the University are not fully utilized.
The realization that life is not a series of stages
but a sort of continuum does not occur. Stuck
fast in an endless rut, the average student at
Stanford is not learning how to live; rather he
is learning how to postpone death.
One can only guess why so few students live
in the present. Though it may be well to ideal
ize the future, it is certainly more desirable to
learn how to live.
This knowledge is the most important ingre
dient of a successful life. Knowing this, Stan
fordites may make an effort to live, and by
living, learn how to live better.—J. R.

The craving for political, economic and spir
itual security is universal. One may doubt
whether a philosophy of continuing change so
challenging to the adventurous-minded will
ever prove satisfying to the non-adventurous
majority.—Marvin L. Darsie
