|>ROBLEM children for any paternalistic college ad
ministration are the young liberals whose pink
tinged activities stand out sharply against the uniform
conservatism of their classmates. Short-sighted deans
frequently regard such restive charges as grease on
the nose of dear Alma Mater, and the question of how
to eradicate them painlessly has accelerated more than
one retreating hair line.
The Daily recently received a letter from the Daily
Californian which indicates that Stanford administra
tors are building themselves a substantial balance in
the Judgment Day Book, wherein wise and good
works are recorded. It seems that in handling the em
barrassing problem of what to do with burgeoning
left-wingers, we are considerably ahead of many other
universities.

At Cal, for instance, a mildly radical organization
like the American Student Union, is anathema. The
A.S.U. may not meet on the Berkeley campus. It is
not recognized as a student organization. The univer
sity simply shuts its eyes and says, "There ain't no such
animal here."
At Stanford, the battered A.S.U. gets the same offi
cial treatment as any other student organization. It
can meet when it pleases, and do what it likes with no
restrictions other than those that all clubs bear. We
recognize the fact that all liberals do not carry bombs
in their coat pockets. We are not petinfied by the fear
that we are being looked over for good firing squad
material. We do not anticipate that the Ad Building
will be blown up during trustees' meeting.

''■TIE funds of the A.S.U. are handled through the
Associated Students; and although this may be
considered a doubtful favor, it does keep our young
liberals from meeting in damp cellars and getting
pneumonia.
In treating the neo-radicals as legitimate if slightly
eccentric children, Stanford may annoy a few stand
patters, but it lives up to its reputation for being a
university, not a reformatory.

No college today pretends to have a monopoly on
that much abused phenomenon, truth. Professors fill
their lectures with so many qualifications that some
times it takes careful search to find an opinion. In the
midst of so much uncertainty, the universities' one
salvation is that they are still seeking for more accurate
information.
If college flatly bars all liberalism and unorthodox
thought, it can give its students nothing but frayed
strereotypes. Giving the A.S.U. official .status may
disturb the grazing of our sacred cows, but it shows
that we have not sealed up our minds and put them
away l<> <lr\.
