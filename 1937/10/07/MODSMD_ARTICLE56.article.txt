# Don't Sit on the Flowers

### 
EX COMMITTEE would like an editorial about
people who sit on flowers at fall reg dances.
This is it. Don't sit on the flowers at fall reg
dances.
The task of a University in respect of research
is twofold. It has to give the student access to
knowledge in the widest variety. It has also to
ensure close and continuous contact between
the various fields of learning and thus to pro
tect its students against the narrowness of vision
and lack of balance which specialization can
so easily induce. â€”The American Oxonian
