'JTHIS evening of October 7 will see us attired in our
smoothest (which is avocado-like, if we do say
so ourselves), commandeering our Stanley Steamer
through the streets of San Francisco to the St. Francis.
Tonight's opening of Red Norvo and Margaret Bailey
in the Mural Room has caused some slight stir among
those who have exhausted the possibility of the
"sway" music purveyed by most city orchestras.
* * * *
But it would seem that the hotel were taking an
awful chance with their nice Mural Room; those walls
don't look as if they could stand much blasting inside
them. And after Norvo's engagement at Los Angeles'
raucous Palomar, he and his won't be imitating Wayne
King. If our own estimation that the band's music
is more Red than hot is justified, we will probably
spend the evening with cotton in our ears playing
piquet with some of the waiters.
* # * *
Speaking of the Palomar reminds us that the own
ers of that colossus have been around S.F. these last
few days looking for a place to light. Sources intimate
that they have tentatively chosen a waterfront loca
tion, with the supposed plan of purchasing a ware
house to be converted to their nightmare-ish pur
poses. What an atmosphere that will be! Through the
murky fog, ferryboat whistles will play echo to some
trumpeter's high C, with Bay waves confusing the
rhythm of the drummer's licks.
* * * *
with cleaning up this and cleaning up that,
music is now about to be violated by an insidious
new "Committee for the Establishment of Censorship
of Sexy Music." Head apostle of this new movement
is one Professor Arthur Cremin, of Newark, New
Jersey, who will attempt to have all composers label
their music as "sexy" or "non-sexy." Says the good
doctor, "If such a song as 'The Big Apple" were to
become the American national anthem, the birth rate
would increase 30 per cent." This is amazing. Musso
lini should be definitely interested.
* * * *
"When people hear "The Big Apple," he continues,
"they get the wiggles." (That's no lie—witness south
ern California dancers on any stomp number.) After
conducting tests, Professor Cremin drew up a pro
gram which he considers particularly "menacing."
(1) "In My Cabin of Dreams"—a nice song to get
acquainted.
(2) A waltz to stir protective instincts in the male.
(3) "Minnie the Moochei'"—to stir some other in
stincts.
(4) "The Big Apple"—the clincher.
What about "It's the Natural Thing To Do," Pro
fessor Cremin? Or as an antidote, "You Can't Have
Everything."

"they get the wiggles." (That's no lie—witness south
ern California dancers on any stomp number.) After
conducting tests, Professor Cremin drew up a pro
gram which he considers particularly "menacing."
(1) "In My Cabin of Dreams"—a nice song to get
acquainted.
(2) A waltz to stir protective instincts in the male.
(3) "Minnie the Moochei'"—to stir some other in
stincts.
(4) "The Big Apple"—the clincher.
What about "It's the Natural Thing To Do," Pro
fessor Cremin? Or as an antidote, "You Can't Have
Everything."

'JTHIS evening of October 7 will see us attired in our
smoothest (which is avocado-like, if we do say
so ourselves), commandeering our Stanley Steamer
through the streets of San Francisco to the St. Francis.
Tonight's opening of Red Norvo and Margaret Bailey
in the Mural Room has caused some slight stir among
those who have exhausted the possibility of the
"sway" music purveyed by most city orchestras.
* * * *
But it would seem that the hotel were taking an
awful chance with their nice Mural Room; those walls
don't look as if they could stand much blasting inside
them. And after Norvo's engagement at Los Angeles'
raucous Palomar, he and his won't be imitating Wayne
King. If our own estimation that the band's music
is more Red than hot is justified, we will probably
spend the evening with cotton in our ears playing
piquet with some of the waiters.
* # * *
Speaking of the Palomar reminds us that the own
ers of that colossus have been around S.F. these last
few days looking for a place to light. Sources intimate
that they have tentatively chosen a waterfront loca
tion, with the supposed plan of purchasing a ware
house to be converted to their nightmare-ish pur
poses. What an atmosphere that will be! Through the
murky fog, ferryboat whistles will play echo to some
trumpeter's high C, with Bay waves confusing the
rhythm of the drummer's licks.
* * * *
with cleaning up this and cleaning up that,
music is now about to be violated by an insidious
new "Committee for the Establishment of Censorship
of Sexy Music." Head apostle of this new movement
is one Professor Arthur Cremin, of Newark, New
Jersey, who will attempt to have all composers label
their music as "sexy" or "non-sexy." Says the good
doctor, "If such a song as 'The Big Apple" were to
become the American national anthem, the birth rate
would increase 30 per cent." This is amazing. Musso
lini should be definitely interested.
