WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
The Editor, Sir:
We are apparently burdened with
Jie presence on Stanford campus of
a member of one of the lowest forms
of humanity — the "hit-and-run"
driver. In this instance, the victim is
not an individual but an automobile;
however, the classification still ap
plies.
While parked in the lot adjoining
the library, some time between the
hours of 10:30 and 12 noon on Sep
tember 30, this negligent person bat
tered, bruised, and bent the rear
left fender of my Pontiac coupe, of
the tender age of two months, and
consequently still my pride and joy.
The damage was to such an ex
tent that it would have been impos
sible for anyone to have done it un
knowingly. At 10:30 o'clock there
was parked on that side of my car a
cream colored convertible coupe or
roadster of more or less ancient
vintage, occupied at that time by one
innocent airedale dog. If the right
fender of this "jalope" is in a dam
aged state, it is likely that the owner
is the offender.
Anyway, I protest that this is not
sporting of a Stanford student. The
least he (or she) could ethically do
in such a situation is to leave a card
offering to make redress.

Yours, for better driving and more
honesty,

The Editor, Sir:
Please ask your dear "Mr. Cope"
to sort his own nuggets of logic from
his pile of rubbish. Perhaps you can
feet some of the other members of
the Daily staff or their stooges—for
instance, "The Forgotten Man,"
"Senior," or even "Junior"—to play
with him.
