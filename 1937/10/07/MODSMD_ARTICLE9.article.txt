# Stuart Lauds F.D.R.'S Condemnation of War
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
"It is about time that the American people realize that a policy of iso
lation is utterly impossible for a world power," Professor Graham Stuart
of the Stanford political science department declared yesterday afternoon
in praising President Roosevelt's Chicago speech Tuesday. The nation's
chief executive suggested that the "peace-loving nations" of the world

should "quarantine war-like na
tions" which he charged had "jeop
ardized" world security.
Describing himself as "enthusias
tic" about the speech, Stuart said
that "the only way for the United
States to keep out of war is to pre
vent war taking place in the world."
Effects Told
Immediate effect of the President's
speech, which implied the abandon
ing of the traditional American for
eign policy of "neutrality," Stuart
believes, will be to "make Japan and
Italy pause a bit in their policies of
international brigandage and high
way robbery."
Moreover, the speech will
"strengthen the hands of the League
of Nations in dealing with the Far
Eastern crisis," the Stanford profes
sor declared.
Opposes Neutrality
Breaking sharply with Congres
sional advocates of neutrality, the
President, Stuart said, has made
clear that he has no faith in neu
trality as a means of avoiding war.
Agreeing with such a belief, Stuart
emphasized that measures against
war have to go much deeper, along
lines of world co-operation.
Origins of the President's newly
enunciated foreign policy can be
traced to the offers of Henry L.
Stimson, secretary of state under the
Hoover administration, to co-oper
ate with other nations during the
Manchuria and Shanghai affairs in
1932, Stuart said. He described it as
a continuation of the "Good Neigh
bor" policy which Roosevelt advo
cated at his first inauguration.
Aid League
The fact that the President chose
to deliver his speech in Chicago, in
the Middle Western area commonly
regarded as bitterly "isolationist,"
means that his advocacy of world
co-operation received more atten
tion in that part of the country than
it otherwise would have had, Stuart
explained.
In concluding. Professor Stuart
predicted that the United States
"will probably co-operate with any
reasonable stand that the League of
Nations or a Nine Power Confer
ence would take in regard to the
present Sino-Japanese affair."

cated at his first inauguration.
Aid League
The fact that the President chose
to deliver his speech in Chicago, in
the Middle Western area commonly
regarded as bitterly "isolationist,"
means that his advocacy of world
co-operation received more atten
tion in that part of the country than
it otherwise would have had, Stuart
explained.
In concluding. Professor Stuart
predicted that the United States
"will probably co-operate with any
reasonable stand that the League of
Nations or a Nine Power Confer
ence would take in regard to the
present Sino-Japanese affair."
"It is about time that the American people realize that a policy of iso
lation is utterly impossible for a world power," Professor Graham Stuart
of the Stanford political science department declared yesterday afternoon
in praising President Roosevelt's Chicago speech Tuesday. The nation's
chief executive suggested that the "peace-loving nations" of the world

should "quarantine war-like na
tions" which he charged had "jeop
ardized" world security.
Describing himself as "enthusias
tic" about the speech, Stuart said
that "the only way for the United
States to keep out of war is to pre
vent war taking place in the world."
Effects Told
Immediate effect of the President's
speech, which implied the abandon
ing of the traditional American for
eign policy of "neutrality," Stuart
believes, will be to "make Japan and
Italy pause a bit in their policies of
international brigandage and high
way robbery."
Moreover, the speech will
"strengthen the hands of the League
of Nations in dealing with the Far
Eastern crisis," the Stanford profes
sor declared.
Opposes Neutrality
Breaking sharply with Congres
sional advocates of neutrality, the
President, Stuart said, has made
clear that he has no faith in neu
trality as a means of avoiding war.
Agreeing with such a belief, Stuart
emphasized that measures against
war have to go much deeper, along
lines of world co-operation.
Origins of the President's newly
enunciated foreign policy can be
traced to the offers of Henry L.
Stimson, secretary of state under the
Hoover administration, to co-oper
ate with other nations during the
Manchuria and Shanghai affairs in
1932, Stuart said. He described it as
a continuation of the "Good Neigh
bor" policy which Roosevelt advo
cated at his first inauguration.
