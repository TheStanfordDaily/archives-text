MOLYNEUX' BELTLESS
SILHOUETTE
Ranleigh dresses that copy faithfully the slender lines of the Molyneux successes,
employing black crepes of novel texture and significanl details. There's the pencil
slim, zipped-up tunic dress, for example, with demure white satin touches —the
trim-clinging line of the dress belted across the back, and set ofl with bright linked
buttons —perfect daytime fashions. Sizes 10 to 20.
