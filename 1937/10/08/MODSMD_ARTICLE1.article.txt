# U.S. to Join Nine-Power Conference
## Secretary Hull Assures League of American Aid in Curbing Japan 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (U.R). —
Secretary of State Cordell Hull to
day virtually assured the League of
Nations of United States participa
tion in the proposed nine-power
conference to consider methods of
curbing Japan in her undeclared
war against China.
Hull said at his press conference
that this nation presumably would
take part if and when invited. The
consultation of signatories of the
Nine-Power Treaty, which guaran
tees territorial integrity of China, is
expected as the second step toward
setting in motion the world's peace
machinery to halt what the League
and the United States both have de
scribed as Japan's violation of that
treaty and the Kellogg-Briand anti
war pact.
Ambassador Sees Hull
Late in the day Japanese Ambas
sador Hirosi Saito called on Hull to
obtain additional information con
cerning the government's statement
condemning Japan as a treaty vio
lator. He said he acted on his own
initiative and had not received any
communication from Tokyo re
garding the statement, adding that
he had no authority to protest
against it.
Another Hull visitor was Norman
H. Davis, ambassador at large to
Europe.
Hull emphasized that it is not up
to the United States, a non-member
of the League, to initiate the nine
power conference.
No Definite Plans
He added that he had not received
suggestions from Europe, as out
lined in press dispatches, that the
conference be held in Washington.
Other officials said the United States
would seek to avoid having the
conference here lest it give the im
pression that this nation was taking
the lead in the proposed "quaran
tine" of Japan.
From the time when President
Roosevelt gave Great Britain and
France his pledge of co-operation in
any definite campaign against "in
ternational lawlessness" through his
speech at Chicago, this government
has sought carefully to avoid as
suming leadership, preferring rather
to throw its influence behind a plan
originated elsewhere.
Hull said he had received no offi
cial comment from Tokyo on yes
terday's statement, nor from any
other governments.
TREATY CONFERENCE

LONDON, Oct. 7 (U.R). — Great
Britain and France are anxious to
make Washington the setting for the

The British and French foreign of

sounding out Secretary of State Cor

rial sovereignty—was signed on Feb
ruary 6, 1922. Signatories of this

Ambassador Sees Hull
Late in the day Japanese Ambas
sador Hirosi Saito called on Hull to
obtain additional information con
cerning the government's statement
condemning Japan as a treaty vio
lator. He said he acted on his own
initiative and had not received any
communication from Tokyo re
garding the statement, adding that
he had no authority to protest
against it.
Another Hull visitor was Norman
H. Davis, ambassador at large to
Europe.
Hull emphasized that it is not up
to the United States, a non-member
of the League, to initiate the nine
power conference.
No Definite Plans
He added that he had not received
suggestions from Europe, as out
lined in press dispatches, that the
conference be held in Washington.
Other officials said the United States
would seek to avoid having the
conference here lest it give the im
pression that this nation was taking
the lead in the proposed "quaran
tine" of Japan.
From the time when President
Roosevelt gave Great Britain and
France his pledge of co-operation in
any definite campaign against "in
ternational lawlessness" through his
speech at Chicago, this government
has sought carefully to avoid as
suming leadership, preferring rather
to throw its influence behind a plan
originated elsewhere.
Hull said he had received no offi
cial comment from Tokyo on yes
terday's statement, nor from any
other governments.
TREATY CONFERENCE
MAY MEET IN U.S.
LONDON, Oct. 7 (U.R). — Great
Britain and France are anxious to
make Washington the setting for the
proposed conference of leading
powers on the Chinese - Japanese
war.
The British and French foreign of
fices, it was disclosed tonight, are
sounding out Secretary of State Cor
dell Hull to learn whether he and
President Roosevelt would not be
willing to have the conference in
Washington, where the nine-power
pact—guaranteeing China's territo
rial sovereignty—was signed on Feb
ruary 6, 1922. Signatories of this
treaty will be the foremost partici
pants in the conference.
MUSOLINI REFUSES
TO ATTEND MEET
ROME, Oct. 7 (U.R).—The Italian
government intimated strongly to
night that it would refuse to attend
the projected nine-power conference
on the Chinese-Japanese war even
though it is one of the original sig
natories of the treaty signed in
Washington in 1922.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 (U.R). —
Secretary of State Cordell Hull to
day virtually assured the League of
Nations of United States participa
tion in the proposed nine-power
conference to consider methods of
curbing Japan in her undeclared
war against China.
Hull said at his press conference
that this nation presumably would
take part if and when invited. The
consultation of signatories of the
Nine-Power Treaty, which guaran
tees territorial integrity of China, is
expected as the second step toward
setting in motion the world's peace
machinery to halt what the League
and the United States both have de
scribed as Japan's violation of that
treaty and the Kellogg-Briand anti
war pact.
