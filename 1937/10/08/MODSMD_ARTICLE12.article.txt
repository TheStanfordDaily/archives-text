# Silent Reading Eases Students' Hardest Task
## 
### AL ZELVER 
Since eighty per cent of the col
lege student's work is reading, any
thing which will ease this labor is of
interest. Unique at Stanford is a
course, '"Techniques of Silent Read
ing," under the direction of W. M.
Danner, Jr., in the School of Edu
cation.
This course is designed to increase
the speed and comprehension of
silent reading. "Techniques of Si
lent Reading" has benefited people
ranging from Phi Betes to freshmen.
Methods Simple
The methods by which this course
is so successful are neither a secret
nor a result of magic; one simple |
idea underlies its woik. Generally
speaking, slow reading is not neces
sarily thorough reading, and most
people read too slowly for clear un
derstanding. This means that by the
time the end of a sentence or para
graph has been reached, the begin
ning thought has been forgotten, and
the mind wanders to other things. !
In "Techniques of Writing" stu
dents arc taught to catch a whole
thought-group of words at a time
and to keep the printed material
moving along at a rapid enough rate
to make the alternation of ideas in- '
te resting.
Besides this fundamental of the j
course there are many other fac- i

tors in reading which are analyzed
for correction, such as lip moving,
and thinking of words individually
in terms of .sounds instead of

' thought groups, or scatter-brained
| ness.
| The use of an ophthalmograph—
I eye movement camera—is one of

j the means of diagnosing faulty read-
I ing habits. By recording the eyes'
travel simultaneously, as they read,
o nmovie camera film, just how the
eyes see the printing is determined.
Some students have been found who
unknowingly read the last part of
the sentence first.
Speed Increase Shown
Records kept for the last three
years show that the average person
taking "Techniques of Silent Head
ing" increases his speed 50 to 84 per
cent and his comprehension 15 to 20
I percentiles.
The course is not given for credit,
j and there are two lower division
i sections meeting three times weekly,
i At the present time no vacancies
; exist in either section. However, a
j few openings remain in the upper
j division and graduate section, meet
| ing in the afternoon. This reading
• course, which is the only one of its
! kind in the country, was conceived
I by Mr. Danner while he was work-
I ing on eye movement data in the
I psychology department.
