## 
### 
The red Austin roadster that has
been terrifying and amusing campus
pedestrians — and motorists — this
quarter cracked up with a slight
thud yesterday noon on the Delta
Chi driveway.
Ray Fremlin, the owner and driv
er, was pinned beneath the mass of
wreckage while Vaughn Goodwin,
sole passenger (there isn't any
more room), was thrown clear, land
ing wrong side up on the fraternity
lawn.
The catastrophe occurred when
Fremlin tried to turn into the drive
at high speed. Witnesses placed the
speed of the car at from 5 to 10 miles
an hour.
The strain proved too much for
the overburdened body, and it ca
reened on its side with the result
ant smattering of the auto and its
passengers.
Biggest property damage was to
the fraternity's new driveway and
lawn, which is now blackened with
western oil and third-grade gas.
Fremlin and Woodwin, well
enough to be about, were last seen
picking up the battered mass and
carrying it away with audible sighs
of sadness and regret.
