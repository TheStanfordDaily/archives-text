# A. F. of L. Seeks To Boycott All Nippon Goods
## 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 7 (U.R).—The Amer
ican Federation of Labor convention
appeared certain tonight to order a
union boycott on all imports from
Japan in protest against aggression
in China.
A. F. of L. leaders said they were
confident the boycott would be voted
unanimously by the 470 delegates
as soon as a resolution to this effect
is brought to a test. Two such pro
posals were introduced at today's
session.
Asks Co-operation
The proposals followed a blistering
extemporaneous speech by William
Green in which he raked the spread
of dictator governments and harsh
ly castigated the "barbarous and in
human way" in which Japanese
troops have harried China "upon
some flimsy excuse."
Green's address was occasioned by
a plea from John C. Little, fraternal
delegate to the convention from
Great Britain, that the federation
join the British Trades Union Con
grss in "a determined stand against
the aggressive dictatorships." Little
praised the policy of President Roo
sevelt toward the China war.
The A. F. of L. president, his face
an angry red, repeated to the dele
gates a cabled request from Sir
Walter Citrine, secretary of the
British Labor party, inviting the
United States to "express detestation
of Japanese barbarism by refusing
to buy Japanese goods."
Green Castigates
Then, pounding the speaker's
table. Green raised his voice to
shout:
"This is an appeal for us to join
the labor movement in Great Britain
in declaring a boycott against goods
manufactured in Japan, until that
country ceases its aggressive tactics.
"If I can have my way, I will pre
vail upon this historic convention to
join with our fellow workers in de
claring such a boycott against this
aggressive nation. ... I know our
answer to this appeal will be fa
vorable."
