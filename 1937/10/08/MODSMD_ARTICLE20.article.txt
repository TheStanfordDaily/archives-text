# Fighting Cards Set For Bruin Gridders
## Thornhill May Name Four New Men To Tomorrow's Starling Line-up 
### GENE GEAR 
An injured Land of Indians will go on the war path tomorrow in the
Stanford Stadium in a desperate attempt to defend their pigskin grazing
lands against the oncoming charges of the Bruin Bombers from the south
land.
The Bruin griddcrs, victorious in their first encounter of the season,
will enter the fray against Tiny ThornhiU's Stanford football machine on

the long end of the odds.
Westwood Bill Spaulding boasts of
his first Ucla outfit witli a powerful
offensive threat, and the 26 points
piled up against Oregon seems to
bear out this contention.
Four new faces will probably be
in the starting line-up for the In
dians tomorrow. Neil R'asmussen
and Irv Cummings have been run
ning a close race in practice all week
for the starting crack at the Bruins
from the left end position. As latest
returns were coming in last night, it
appeared as though Rassy would
take over the assignment.
Dakan in Line
Bob Dakan's steady climb from the
ranks of obscurity will be crowned
tomorrow afternoon when the beefy
lineman moves in to take starting
duties at right guard. Dakan is the

fastest lineman on the squad. His
exceptional play against the Web
feet last week is what started his
skyrocket onto the first team. Dakan
replaces Jack Walton, who. is suf
fering from a slight back injury.
A1 Alustiza, brother of the famed
Frankie, will in all probability get
the starting call at quarterback in
Bi'tl Paulman's place. Paulman's
dislocated shoulder will keep him
out of tomorrow's fracas, but Dr.
Roth seems hopeful that Bill will be
able to see action against Wash
ington two weeks hence.
A1 Outshining
Alphonse has been outshining the
boys in tackling and blocking all
through the season and he will get
his chance back of the line on the
left, where Kenny Washington is
slated to do a little crashing.
The fourth new face is that of
Freddie Ledeboer, transfer from
San Mateo J. C., who moves in to
take over the vacancy left by the
injured Ed Gamier. Fred is a fleet
runner and a good blocker.
Stone Plays End
The remainder of the Card squad
will remain intact for the opening
whistle tomorrow afternoon. Grant
Stone will be at right end for the
Indians. The two giant tackles, Pete
Zagar and Stan Andersen, will be
in there. Pete at his usual left tackle
spot and Stan on the right side of
the line. Veteran Leo Ferko will get
the starting call at left guard.
Little Jimmy Coffis will be in
there cavorting at safety for the
Cards, and doing a little left half
backing on the side.
At fullback will be Jim Groves,
the plunging dynamo from San
Mateo J. C., who piled almost as
much yardage last week as the en
lire Oregon backfield put together.
Bruin Line-up
Biil Spaulding has announced his
starting liiie-up and places Bob
Nash at left end and Woodrow Wil
son Strode at right end. Strode was
rated a sensational pass snagger in
the Oregon game. The ebony flash
will bear watching in tomorrow's
little get-together.
At left tackle will be Slats Wyrick
and in the other tackle spot will be
Larry Murdock. The guard posts
will be filled by Jack Cohen on the
left side of the line and George
PfifTer on the right.
Spaulding's center, Johnny Ry
land, will be in there trying to live
up to the reputation heaped on him
by southern fans. They rate him one
of the best on the coast.
Backfield Heavy
The Bruin backfield, averaging 192
pounds per man, will produce John
ny Baida at quarter; Kenny Wash
ington at left half; Hal Hirshon at
right half; and Walt Schell, full
back.
Kenny Washington, the sensation
al dusky passi;r, mry cause the In
dians plenty of trouble during the
afternoon. If Washington starts
flipping the swineskin around, and
Stanford's Glenn Hamilton goes in
for a few tosses, the fans are going
to be treated to one of the greatest
aerial shows of the season.
Two Questions
Walt Schell is a 230-pounder who
hits a line like a ton of bricks,
catches passes, and is a sensational
kicker.
When the smoke of battle clears
away two questions will be an
swered . . . Have the Bruins got
a ball club that will threaten Cal,
Washington, and U.S.C. for top
honors? And has the Little Red
Kiddie Kar a chance of turning into
ihe Big Red Machine of old?
