# Row Council May Abolish Initiation Plan
## Board Seeks To Change Set-up; Data Shows 'Hell-Week' Disliked 
### GEORGE VENESS 
At (he first Inter!raternity Council
meeting o! the year, held last night
at the Delt house, another step in
the complete abolishment of "hell
week" from Stanford fraternity life
was taken.
The report of a special committee
headed by Tracy Durlam which has
been investigating the rushing sit
uation in many other American
universities found that other schools
| such as Minnesota have abolished
| "hell-week" with no unfavorable
| result to the houses and increasing
the worth of the initiate both schol
astically and to the fraternity.
Start Last Year
Last year Stanford adopted a "pre-
I initiation" plan which provided for
the abolishment of the term "hell
week" and the adoption of several
i regulations such as conducting all
the pre-initiation period in the
j house.
Chiefly these regulations were
; adopted to help maintain a scholas
tic standard which the university
felt was seriously lowered by the
i pre-initiation period.
Use Honor Code
| The enforcement of these regula
: tions was left to the Honor System,
â–  each house president signing a
1 pledge that he would see that the
| rules were followed.
As a result of last night's report
! it is probable that the pre-initiation
period as it exists today will be
j completely abolished at Stanford
I next year. This year it cannot be
' done because several houses have
rlready become so involved that it
' is impractical.
