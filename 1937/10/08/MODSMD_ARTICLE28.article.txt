# Easy Victories Predicted For Grid Favorites
## Copers Have Pushover In Picking Winners Of Week-end Gaines 
### HARRY PRESS 
Grid prognosticators and favored
teams alike will have little trouble
this week-end in having their own
way about things in general. All
signs point to wins—with top-heavy
scores—for the teams which are do
ing the leading in their conference
standings, with few toss-ups listed
to cloud the picker's horizon.
Ohio State travels west in an at
tempt to administer a severe thwack
ing to those over-publiciz.ed foot
ballers from U.S.C. Howard Jones
may have a lot of talent running
loose at Bovard Field, but it has yet
to show itself in a kind of co-ordi
nated football. It looks like the
Buckeyes won't have much trouble
annexing a win by 12 points in this
game.
Cal Has 'Practice'
Over 800-erkeley way, it seems
that Stub Allison has scheduled a
practice session for Saturday after
noon, open to the public, with some
gentlemen from Washington State
College playing the part of the
stooges. There seems no other pos
sible solution to the weighty prob
lem of picking the winner of this
little ditty than to hand the verdict
on a rusty tin platter to the Bears
by about 25 points. Tain't right.
Washington, in its slow, not too
powerful way, will bowl over an
other pin to further clear the path to
another championship when Oregon
State falls before the Huskies' pass

Htlack. Joe u C?host Gray and com
pany haven't been able 1o yet start- i
ed yet this year, and it doesn't seem >
very plausible that Washington is !
going to give them a chance'to do so.
Captain Waskowitz is going to
heave a couple of passes, Oregon
will score through the line, and the
Huskies will win by one touch
down.
