LONDON, Oct. 7 (UP).â€”A warn
ing to Premier Benito Mussolini
that a "very serious situation" will
develop if he refuses to recall Ital
ian troops from Spain aroused spec
ulation tonight whether the British
and French navies might be used to
protect the Spanish loyalists against
Fascist intervention.
The warning was delivered in
Rome tonight when Anglo-French
envoys called at the foreign min
istry and asked an immediate ans
wer as to whether Italy will discuss
the volunteers question in a tri
power meeting.
Mussolini's foreign minister, Count
Galeazzo Ciano, was understood to
have been informed that "other
measures" would be taken if II
Duce refuses to collaborate.
