# Campus Thief Charged With Farm Crimes
## Possession of Loot From Stanford Dormitory Asserted in Inquiry 
### 
Arrest in Berkeley of a "campus
burglar," who "works" in dormito
ries during football games, today
had solved three Stanford robberies
of recent years.
Officer George Burns, v/ho inves
tigated in Berkeley yesterday, said
â™¦he alleged thief, Robert Francis
Bums, 25, of San Francisco, had in
his possession loot from two Bran
ner Hall rooms.
Connection with the Stanford
robberies was traced through the
.serial number of a watch stolen from
the room of Edwin Ridgway during
the Big Game, November 23, 1935.
Officer Burns also identified articles
taken from the room of Ernest Ey
ting, Jr., and Richard McCarthy dur
ing the Santa Clara game this year.
Officer Burns said Ridgway's room
was entered through a window left
open during th egame and the Ey
ting-McCarthy room through an un
locked door. He urged that all Row
and Hall residents securely lock
their rooms during games this year
to prevent recurrences of such
crimes.
The alleged burglar will appear
in superior court in Berkeley Octo
ber 14. Meanwhile a hold warrant
will be issued here in the Eyting
robbery, and Burns probably will
be returned for trial following dis
posal of the Berkeley case.
