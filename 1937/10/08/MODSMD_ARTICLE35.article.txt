## Convicts Refute Guilt In Death of Warden 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 7 (U.R).â€”Ed
Davis, Midwestern outlaw, and Rob
ert Lee Cannon, Los Angeles con
vict, were arraigned in Sacramento
superior court today on charges of
murder arising from the death of
two Folsom prison officials in an
attempted escape.
The convicts pleaded not guilty
and trial was set for November 15.
Extreme precautions were taken
in removing Davis, said to have been
ringleader of the break, and Can
non from Folsom to the courtroom
and returning them there. Ten offi
cers, heavily armed, accompanied
the prisoners. An autoload of depu
ties preceded the car in which the
convicts rode and another machine,
loaded with guards, followed.
Three other defendants, Fred
Barnes, Wesley Eudy, and Albert
Kessel, will be arraigned October 27.
They still were under treatment for
the injuries they suffered in the at
tempted break in which convicts
Clyde Stevens and Benny Kucharski
and guard Harry Martin were killed
and Warden Clarence Martin was
injured fatally.
District Attorney Otis Babcock
said he would seek the death penalty
for the five survivors. Under state
law, if convicted they would be put
to death in the lethal gas chamber
soon to be constructed.
