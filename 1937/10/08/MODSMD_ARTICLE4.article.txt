# Pay Phone Ruling May Last for Row
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
A fraternity or a sorority may not be a semi-public place in the dic
tionary or in (he by-laws, but it Ls in the Pacific Telephone Company's
tariff book.
Returning house managers learned this to their sorrow this fall as
phone company service men descended on the campus with nickel phones

â–ºunder their arms and pliers in their
hands.
Rate with Hotels
Fraternities, the service men said,
quoting their boss, Mr. Dillinger,
who quoted the tariff rules approved
by the California Railroad Commis
sion, rated along with hotels and
clubs. Phones in their lobbies must
be pay phones.
House managers protested, called
Mr. Dillinger, but the nickel grab
bers went in at all but five or six
houses. By this time officials found
themselves in a spot. Outgoing calls
did not nearly equal incoming calls,
which seemed bad for the machinery
in the Palo Alto headquarters. In
the words of Mr. Dillinger:
Incoming Calls Go Up
"After a number of these services
were installed it was noticed that a
high incoming calling rate was de
veloping, and in order to avoid the
possibility of delayed calls or any
form of unsatisfactory service, the
telephone company felt that it might
be desirable to avoid further coin
box installations and bring the call
ing rate more in line with that of
last year until additional equipment
could be installed."
Then, according to Mr. Dillinger,
the company informed the houses
that they could have the flat rate
service again with the understand
ing that the pay phone is mandatory
next year. At the present time at
least one house is having the nickel
phone torn out and the flat rate serv
ice resumed.
Some Houses Lucky
Other houses have merely had a
flat rate phone installed in a private
room and leave the door unlocked.
The telephone company (through
Mr. Dillinger) declares it knows of
the practice, but will make no state
ment of policy.
The campus, however, may well
await with interest the final word of
Mr. Dillinger.
