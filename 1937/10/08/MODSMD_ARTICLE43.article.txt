# Uclans Boast Punch On Offense
## Bruin Scribe Sees Triumph For Visitors Bill Spanieling Gridmen Appear Powerful On Attack; Negro Stars 
### VINCENT RICK 
(Daily Bruin Sports Editor)
Bill Spaulding and what the south
land scribes modestly term his
Streamlined Bruin Grid Special in
vade Palo Alto tomorrow to do
battle with Tiny ThornhiU's 1937
version of the Big Red Stanford
Machine—and from a strictly per
sonal point of view I rather think
our Westwood gang will cop the
duke,
I'll tell you why.
The Bruins boast a feature en
tirely lacking in U.C.L.A. squads of
the past—a potent, well-balanced
offensive punch that will score
touchdowns against the best the
Coast has to offer.
"Ah," you come back at me, "but
how about the defense?"
Defense Unknown
Well, I'll admit frankly that our
defensive strength is a huge glaring
question-mark, but it's improved
tremendously in the past fortnight.
That forward wall of Spaulding's is
as green as a ten-acre field of four
leafed clover, but it has excellent
possibilities that require but a bit
more work under fire to bring them
out.
However, let's get back to the of
fense. We'll start with Kenny Wash
ington—the one-man riot, the Se
pia Speedster who can do more
things with the bloated porkhide
than you or I ever thought possible.
He's got a pair of ham-like hands
that wrap around a ball and whip
it 70 yards down the field with
ridiculous ease. He throws like a
shortstop, and is easily as accurate.
Washington's Running
Kenny has several other cute
tricks. For instance, he runs—and
with the most peculiar knock-kneed
loping motion I ever saw. And when
the boy breaks past that scrimmage
line and into the clear it's like toss
ing a streak of black lightning into
the game. Add to this the fact that
Washington is the best blocker on
the squad and you have quite a foot
ball player.
And Kenny has plenty of aid in
that first-string backfield. At full
back you'll see big Walt Schell, 240
pounds of lumbering humanity, and
Billy Bob Williams. Both of them
smack a line with pile-driver force.
Schell catches passes and punts,
while Williams rates as one of the
best placement kickers in the na
tion.
Handsome Right Half
The right half will be Handsome
Hal Hirshon. He's an innovation at
the position — a fast, shifty ball
carrier and accurate passer. This
is the first year Spaulding has used
a strong running player in the spot,
and the move gives El Bruin the
ideal offense—one that can break
plays to right or left with equal
facility.
The ends—Bob Nash and Wood
row Strode—are an important cog
in this offensive machine. Both are
chosen primarily for their pass
snagging ability, to complement
Washington's amazing throwing arm,
and they excel at the task. Strode in
particular should give the Indians 1
trouble. He's a six-foot three-inch

Negro speedster who I figure will
play havoc with the comparatively
stubby Stanford secondaries.
Offense Featured
Those are the individual stars, and
Spaulding has molded them into an
aggregation that tears up and down
the field in a most bewildering man
ner. He's dispensed with his de
fensive brand of football and will
open up with a spectacular array of
scoring plays entirely unknown to
Bruin teams of the past.
Squad in Condition
The entire squad will arrive to
morrow morning in tip-top condi
tion, and this—combined with the
fact that Stanford is badly riddled
with injuries—leads me to tab "my"
gang by two touchdowns.

the squad and you have quite a foot
ball player.
And Kenny has plenty of aid in
that first-string backfield. At full
back you'll see big Walt Schell, 240
pounds of lumbering humanity, and
Billy Bob Williams. Both of them
smack a line with pile-driver force.
Schell catches passes and punts,
while Williams rates as one of the
best placement kickers in the na
tion.
Handsome Right Half
The right half will be Handsome
Hal Hirshon. He's an innovation at
the position — a fast, shifty ball
carrier and accurate passer. This
is the first year Spaulding has used
a strong running player in the spot,
and the move gives El Bruin the
ideal offense—one that can break
plays to right or left with equal
facility.
The ends—Bob Nash and Wood
row Strode—are an important cog
in this offensive machine. Both are
chosen primarily for their pass
snagging ability, to complement
Washington's amazing throwing arm,
and they excel at the task. Strode in
particular should give the Indians 1
trouble. He's a six-foot three-inch

Negro speedster who I figure will
play havoc with the comparatively
stubby Stanford secondaries.
Offense Featured
Those are the individual stars, and
Spaulding has molded them into an
aggregation that tears up and down
the field in a most bewildering man
ner. He's dispensed with his de
fensive brand of football and will
open up with a spectacular array of
scoring plays entirely unknown to
Bruin teams of the past.
Squad in Condition
The entire squad will arrive to
morrow morning in tip-top condi
tion, and this—combined with the
fact that Stanford is badly riddled
with injuries—leads me to tab "my"
gang by two touchdowns.

Bill Spaulding and what the south
land scribes modestly term his
Streamlined Bruin Grid Special in
vade Palo Alto tomorrow to do
battle with Tiny ThornhiU's 1937
version of the Big Red Stanford
Machine—and from a strictly per
sonal point of view I rather think
our Westwood gang will cop the
duke,
I'll tell you why.
The Bruins boast a feature en
tirely lacking in U.C.L.A. squads of
the past—a potent, well-balanced
offensive punch that will score
touchdowns against the best the
Coast has to offer.
"Ah," you come back at me, "but
how about the defense?"
Defense Unknown
Well, I'll admit frankly that our
defensive strength is a huge glaring
question-mark, but it's improved
tremendously in the past fortnight.
That forward wall of Spaulding's is
as green as a ten-acre field of four
leafed clover, but it has excellent
possibilities that require but a bit
more work under fire to bring them
out.
However, let's get back to the of
fense. We'll start with Kenny Wash
ington—the one-man riot, the Se
pia Speedster who can do more
things with the bloated porkhide
than you or I ever thought possible.
He's got a pair of ham-like hands
that wrap around a ball and whip
it 70 yards down the field with
ridiculous ease. He throws like a
shortstop, and is easily as accurate.
Washington's Running
Kenny has several other cute
tricks. For instance, he runs—and
with the most peculiar knock-kneed
loping motion I ever saw. And when
the boy breaks past that scrimmage
line and into the clear it's like toss
ing a streak of black lightning into
the game. Add to this the fact that
Washington is the best blocker on
the squad and you have quite a foot
ball player.
And Kenny has plenty of aid in
