PETE ZAGAR


JIM GROVES

WHEN THE STARTING gun pops tomorrow afternoon for Stanford's game with U.C.L.A., Jim Groves
probably wlil be on the field at fullback and Pete /agar will be ready at left tackle to repeat his 1936 dose
of grief for the Bruins. And Bill Kirsch will be on hand to do some work at right half whenever needed.
