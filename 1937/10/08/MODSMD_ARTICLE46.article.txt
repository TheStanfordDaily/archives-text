# Doering Leads In Golf Tourney
## Squad to Play Qualifying Hounds without Lows Of Seeded Standing 
### 
Coach Eddie Twiggs tacked up the
year's first qualifying rounds for his
golf teams yesterday, and the re
sults saw Art Doering take a nine
stroke lead in the 26-hole contest.
Doering, a sophomore ineligible
last year, stroked around with ma
chine-like precision and consistency,
especially on approach iron shots,
for two rounds of 71 each. Par for
the course is 72.
In a tie for second place were
Brown Cannon, two-year veteran,
and Bob Breyer, a soph, with 76-75 —
151 and 84-67—151, respectively,
Breyer's 67 comes within two
strokes of the course record, set two
years ago by Spec Stewart.
Coach Twiggs said that no compe
titive standing was at stake with
these qualifying rounds, but that the
squad would have to qualify regu
larly during winter quarter, with
only one or two tournaments to be
entered.
Other leading scorers were, for the
varsity:
Jim Rea, 76-80—15G
Chuck Russell 76-80—156
Dick Wright—77-80—157
Jack Showalter, 74-84—158
Alan Hyman—7B-80—158
