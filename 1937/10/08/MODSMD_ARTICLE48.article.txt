It's do or die for the old Injuns to
morrow in the local football park
when Bill Spaulding's herd of grid
ders hit town.
A win for the Cards tomorrow
will be the start of a new cycle for
this year's Stanford football ma
chine. The Little Red Kiddie Kar
will indeed be transformed into
the Big Red Machine for the re
mainder of the year if Tiny's boys
can pull an upset by whipping the
favored Bruins.
Yes, the Westwood footballers are
the favorites after their convincing
win over Oregon two weeks ago, but
you loyal Stanfordites, don't climb
off the red wagon just yet — the
Bruins are in for a real battle all
the way. I see where the Dippy
Sports Mystics went into one of
their 75-cent trances and came out
with a 20-13 score favoring the
southerners. That may be right at
that—if Tiny's bunch of pigskin
artists can find themselves that
score is going to look a lot different.
The boys are going to click and
really go to town in one of these
games—that'll start the fireworks for
the rest of the season. Look out,
Bruins, if tomorrow's the transfor
mation day for the Little Red Kiddie
Kar.
WASHINGTON HERE
TO TOSS 'EM
They say this colored flash,
Kenny Washington, is quite a ball
player. He ran wild against the
Oregon Webfeet. He throws
passes with deadly accuracy and
appears to be headed for all -
coast honors.
When the Bruins want sheer pow
er through the line Spaulding can
call on the veteran, Billy Bob Wil
liams. This Williams is heralded as
quite a place-kicker down south,
according to Assistant Card Coach
Ben Winkelman. Farm fans may see
some field goal attempts tomorrow.
The Bruins from the wilds of
Westwood have a slashing center by
the name of Johnny Ryland. The
Uclan fans rate him all-coast this
season. It should be interesting to
see if Stanford's fighting pivot man,
Tony Calvelli, can outshine Ryland.

LIKES U.C.L.A.'s CHANCES
Vincent Rice, the sports editor of
the California Daily Bruin, is up for
the game. He came storming in the
Dippy shack with plenty to say in
favor of this year's U.C.L.A. outfit.
Right now the Bruin sports writers
rate their team third place in the
conference. Vince even goes over
board with a prediction that this
year's Westwood team can beat
Washington for second place with a
good break, and even trip over the
Berkeley Bear with a slightly bet
ter break.
This Walt Schcll mtist be quite
a formidable sight in football togs.
The Bruin fullback tips the scales
at 2.'JO, and that is plenty of bcel
for any one man to carry through
any given line of football players.
He's rated as an exceptional kick
er, passer, plunger, and pass re
ceiver.
Vince is lavish in his praise of the
ebony streak with the fancy mon
icker, Woodrow Wilson Strode, who
dees his cavorting at right end for
the Bruins. The Indian secondary
better keep their eyes on this boy
tomorrow.
HERSHEY, JIMMY TO
PUT ON DUEL
Hal Hirshon is at safety for the
Bruins and will be trying to match
punt returns with our own little
Jimmy CofTis. Hershey will have to
do plenty of rambling to equal
Jimmy Tom.
The Bruin line will average 298
and the Stanfords are not far be
hind with a 196 average. The U. C.
L. A. baekfield average, helped
along by the beefy Mr. Schell, out
weighs Stanford's starting foursome
192 to 182.
While the Bear is toying with the
poor little Cougar up Strawberry
Canyon way, the Bear's little brother
i:s going to be pitt/id in a real life
and death battle down here on the
Farm.

the way. I see where the Dippy
Sports Mystics went into one of
their 75-cent trances and came out
with a 20-13 score favoring the
southerners. That may be right at
that—if Tiny's bunch of pigskin
artists can find themselves that
score is going to look a lot different.
The boys are going to click and
really go to town in one of these
games—that'll start the fireworks for
the rest of the season. Look out,
Bruins, if tomorrow's the transfor
mation day for the Little Red Kiddie
Kar.
WASHINGTON HERE
TO TOSS 'EM
They say this colored flash,
Kenny Washington, is quite a ball
player. He ran wild against the
Oregon Webfeet. He throws
passes with deadly accuracy and
appears to be headed for all -
coast honors.
When the Bruins want sheer pow
er through the line Spaulding can
call on the veteran, Billy Bob Wil
liams. This Williams is heralded as
quite a place-kicker down south,
according to Assistant Card Coach
Ben Winkelman. Farm fans may see
some field goal attempts tomorrow.
The Bruins from the wilds of
Westwood have a slashing center by
the name of Johnny Ryland. The
Uclan fans rate him all-coast this
season. It should be interesting to
see if Stanford's fighting pivot man,
Tony Calvelli, can outshine Ryland.
BRUIN SCRIBE
LIKES U.C.L.A.'s CHANCES
Vincent Rice, the sports editor of
the California Daily Bruin, is up for
the game. He came storming in the
Dippy shack with plenty to say in
favor of this year's U.C.L.A. outfit.
Right now the Bruin sports writers
rate their team third place in the
conference. Vince even goes over
board with a prediction that this
year's Westwood team can beat
Washington for second place with a
good break, and even trip over the
Berkeley Bear with a slightly bet
ter break.
This Walt Schcll mtist be quite
a formidable sight in football togs.
The Bruin fullback tips the scales
at 2.'JO, and that is plenty of bcel
for any one man to carry through
any given line of football players.
He's rated as an exceptional kick
er, passer, plunger, and pass re
ceiver.
Vince is lavish in his praise of the
ebony streak with the fancy mon
icker, Woodrow Wilson Strode, who
dees his cavorting at right end for
the Bruins. The Indian secondary
better keep their eyes on this boy
tomorrow.
HERSHEY, JIMMY TO
PUT ON DUEL
Hal Hirshon is at safety for the
Bruins and will be trying to match
punt returns with our own little
Jimmy CofTis. Hershey will have to
do plenty of rambling to equal
Jimmy Tom.
The Bruin line will average 298
and the Stanfords are not far be
hind with a 196 average. The U. C.
L. A. baekfield average, helped
along by the beefy Mr. Schell, out
weighs Stanford's starting foursome
192 to 182.
While the Bear is toying with the
poor little Cougar up Strawberry
Canyon way, the Bear's little brother
i:s going to be pitt/id in a real life
and death battle down here on the
Farm.
