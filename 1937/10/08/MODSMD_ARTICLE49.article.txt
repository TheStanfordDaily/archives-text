# Giants Battered As Yanks Win Second
## Red Ruffing Limits Foes To Lone Run Three of Terry's Hurlers Falter as Americans Hang Up 8-1 Victory 
### 
YANKEE STADIUM, New York,
Oct. 7 (U.R). —Yankee dynamite ex
ploded again in today's second game
of the "nickel" World Series and
blasted the Giants to defeat under
a barrage of 12 hits by the same 8-1
score that won yesterday's opening
contest.
While big Charlie '"Red" Ruffing,
the eight-tied right-hander from
Nokomis, 111., handcuffed the Giants
with seven scattered hits, his mates
bombarded three Giant pitchers and
apparently put a headlock on their
second straight world champion
ship.
Yanks Open in Fifth
Clifford Melton, a gangling south
paw rookie from the North Caro
lina hills, spiked the Yankee guns
with only two hits until the fifth in
ning — a performance quite similar
to that of his mate, Carl Hubbell,
yesterday. Melton was pitching so
magnificently that the 57,675 fans
figured the freshman fire-ball flinger
might succeed where the veteran
screwball king failed.
But the Yanks broke loose in the
fifth, smashed Melton from the
mound, and continued their barrage
in the sixth and seventh against two
right-handers, Harry Gumbert and
Dick Coffman. Eight runs and ten
hits, including four doubles, were
rolled up in those three frames.
Red's Fast Ball Good
Ruffing, veteran of two previous
series, blazed away from the Yan
kee mound with his old-time fast
ball and the new explosive curve
that was taught him this season by
Monte Pearson, who will handle the
Yankee pitching assignment tomor
row against Hal Schumacher—as
the series shifts to the Polo Grounds.
"Bit Red," a former Illinois coal
miner who lost two toes on his right
foot in an underground explosion,
helped win his own game today by
driving in three runs with a single
and a double. And he registered
eight strikeouts—four more than the
three Giants' hurlers.
The crowd — unexpectedly small
despite warm, clear weather—be
came somewhat bored with the mo

notony of Yankee hits in the three
scoring frames. Many of those who
had contributed to the $229,552 gate
yelled derisively "They're off at
Rockingham." Others shouted, "It's
too bad the Giants can't throw in the
towel—like in fights." Everyone was
impressed with the apparent hope
lessness of the Giants' cause—now
that their two ace pitchers have
failed to go the route.
Giants' Lose Crowd
After Wednesday's opening Giants'
defeat, the fans had little confidence
left in Manager Bill Terry and his
gray-clad performers. That's why
the Yanks were 9-5 favorites to win
today, and that's why today's crowd
was almost 3,000 less than yester
day's although the weather was
much better.

of the "nickel" World Series and
blasted the Giants to defeat under
a barrage of 12 hits by the same 8-1
score that won yesterday's opening
contest.
While big Charlie '"Red" Ruffing,
the eight-tied right-hander from
Nokomis, 111., handcuffed the Giants
with seven scattered hits, his mates
bombarded three Giant pitchers and
apparently put a headlock on their
second straight world champion
ship.
Yanks Open in Fifth
Clifford Melton, a gangling south
paw rookie from the North Caro
lina hills, spiked the Yankee guns
with only two hits until the fifth in
ning — a performance quite similar
to that of his mate, Carl Hubbell,
yesterday. Melton was pitching so
magnificently that the 57,675 fans
figured the freshman fire-ball flinger
might succeed where the veteran
screwball king failed.
But the Yanks broke loose in the
fifth, smashed Melton from the
mound, and continued their barrage
in the sixth and seventh against two
right-handers, Harry Gumbert and
Dick Coffman. Eight runs and ten
hits, including four doubles, were
rolled up in those three frames.
Red's Fast Ball Good
Ruffing, veteran of two previous
series, blazed away from the Yan
kee mound with his old-time fast
ball and the new explosive curve
that was taught him this season by
Monte Pearson, who will handle the
Yankee pitching assignment tomor
row against Hal Schumacher—as
the series shifts to the Polo Grounds.
"Bit Red," a former Illinois coal
miner who lost two toes on his right
foot in an underground explosion,
helped win his own game today by
driving in three runs with a single
and a double. And he registered
eight strikeouts—four more than the
three Giants' hurlers.
The crowd — unexpectedly small
despite warm, clear weather—be
came somewhat bored with the mo

notony of Yankee hits in the three
scoring frames. Many of those who
had contributed to the $229,552 gate
yelled derisively "They're off at
Rockingham." Others shouted, "It's
too bad the Giants can't throw in the
towel—like in fights." Everyone was
impressed with the apparent hope
lessness of the Giants' cause—now
that their two ace pitchers have
failed to go the route.
Giants' Lose Crowd
After Wednesday's opening Giants'
defeat, the fans had little confidence
left in Manager Bill Terry and his
gray-clad performers. That's why
the Yanks were 9-5 favorites to win
today, and that's why today's crowd
was almost 3,000 less than yester
day's although the weather was
much better.
