## Card Papoose Team Primed For Trobabes Frosh Hope for Second Victory as Modesto Win Raises Morale 
### 
Entering enemy territory for the
first time, Stanford's Papoose war
riors will hop on the Southern Pa
cific pony with loins girded and
tomahawks unsheathed tonight, for
their invasion of the Trobabes in
the Coliseum tomorrow.
Rated as underdogs for the second
time this season, the young Cards
hope to upset both the wise money
and U.S.C. On paper Southern Cal
is the strongest team, but poten
tially Saturday will be Stanford's
day, because the frosh are keyed up
for this contest after their first taste
of victory last week, and yet they
are not overconfident. They haven't
forgotten Santa Ana J.C.
Probable starting line-up for the
game will be: ends, Jim Farquhar
son and Jack Cudahy; tackles,
'"Swede" Johansen and Ed Braheny;
guards, John Kerman and Charles
Orme; center, Jack Thompson;
halves, Quentin Thompson and Thor
Peterson; quarterback, Stan Graff;
fullback. Captain Norm Standlee.
