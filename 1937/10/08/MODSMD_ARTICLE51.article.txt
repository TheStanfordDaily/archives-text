# Water Polo Jayvee Set For First Tilt Tonight
## Daily Pickers' Seance Sees Indian Loss 
### 
The Dippy's peerless pigskin pick
ers are loose again. Pulled up by
their .666 batting average last week,
they're raring to go.
Six of the Daily's demon sports
scriveners went into a prolonged
trance and came out with the fol
lowing momentous predictions for
this week-end's football games:
U.C.L.A., 20; Stanford, 12
California, 26; Washington State, 0
St. Mary's, 14: Nevada, 0
Santa Clara, 13; U.S.F., 7
Ohio State, 13; U.S.C., 7
Washington, 21; Oregon State, 7
Oregon, 13; Gonzaga, 7
The six pigskin mystics trying to
uphold the .615 grand batting aver
age for the season are Walt Peter
son, Harry Press, Doug Jaques, Bob
Glikbarg, Arch Jenkins, and Sports
Editor Gene Gear.

With a few last minute changes in
his first-string jayvee line-up, Coach
Nort Thornton of the Cardinal water
polo team announced his team ready
for the San Francisco Jewish Com
munity Center name scheduled at £
o'clock tonight in Encina pools.
Since the game is free, a large turn
out is expected.
Meanwhile, the varsity continues
scrimmage for their opener with
Compton J. C. next Friday, Octo
ber 15, and the Olympic Club Sat
urday, October 16. With the excep
tions of Captain Hanna and Johnny
j Lamb, all-Coast forwards, nothing
remains of last year's coast cham
! pionship aggregation. Most of the
contenders for other positions are
completely inexperienced, but
Thornton is relying heavily on sev
eral sophomores and juniors who
have the inside path on first-string
jobs.
The revised line-up for tonight's
game lists: Jack Read, sprint; Jack
Parker and Jack Wilson, forwards;
John Shallenberger and Dick Pal
mer or Bob Savage, guards; Bill
Hatch, centerback; and Harik Ald
-1 rich, goal-guard.

-1 rich, goal-guard.
The Dippy's peerless pigskin pick
ers are loose again. Pulled up by
their .666 batting average last week,
they're raring to go.
Six of the Daily's demon sports
scriveners went into a prolonged
trance and came out with the fol
lowing momentous predictions for
this week-end's football games:
U.C.L.A., 20; Stanford, 12
California, 26; Washington State, 0
St. Mary's, 14: Nevada, 0
Santa Clara, 13; U.S.F., 7
Ohio State, 13; U.S.C., 7
Washington, 21; Oregon State, 7
Oregon, 13; Gonzaga, 7
The six pigskin mystics trying to
uphold the .615 grand batting aver
age for the season are Walt Peter
son, Harry Press, Doug Jaques, Bob
Glikbarg, Arch Jenkins, and Sports
Editor Gene Gear.

With a few last minute changes in
his first-string jayvee line-up, Coach
Nort Thornton of the Cardinal water
polo team announced his team ready
for the San Francisco Jewish Com
munity Center name scheduled at £
o'clock tonight in Encina pools.
Since the game is free, a large turn
out is expected.
Meanwhile, the varsity continues
scrimmage for their opener with
Compton J. C. next Friday, Octo
ber 15, and the Olympic Club Sat
urday, October 16. With the excep
tions of Captain Hanna and Johnny
j Lamb, all-Coast forwards, nothing
remains of last year's coast cham
! pionship aggregation. Most of the
contenders for other positions are
completely inexperienced, but
Thornton is relying heavily on sev
eral sophomores and juniors who
have the inside path on first-string
jobs.
The revised line-up for tonight's
game lists: Jack Read, sprint; Jack
Parker and Jack Wilson, forwards;
John Shallenberger and Dick Pal
mer or Bob Savage, guards; Bill
Hatch, centerback; and Harik Ald
-1 rich, goal-guard.
