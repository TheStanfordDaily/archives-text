## Everything But The Juleps 
### 
INTO the Stanford community tomorrow will
pour a thousand enthusiastic rooters from
University of California at Los Angeles who
have trundled 400 miles in an S.P. tourist and
plunked their nine dollars plus on the line to
watch someone's football team wallop the tar
out of someone else's football team in Stanford s
stadium.
And tomorrow night sorority houses will ship
their pledges to the City to clear a bed for the
fifteen sisters from the south, and fraternity
men will pile the visiting brothers two high on
the floor, while the halls put them on the lobby
sofas. The order of the day is Stanford hospi
tality, for the Indian and Bruin have always
been good friends.
The spirit of goodwill between these two Uni
versities seems to date back to the days when
the infant Ucla was considered a pet victim for
the powerful Stanford, and the meek followers
of the Bruin pushover were befriended through
sympathy and admiration for their grit. Califor

nia and U.S.C. were strong; Stanford's tradi
tional enemies of north and south.
But since those days Ucla's diapers have gone
and what was California's southern branch now
becomes something more than a bawling child
with a weakling ball club.
But, simply because Ucla is a big girl now, no
change has taken place in the inter-University
spirit. When the Bruin tipped over Stanford's
football applecart two seasons ago and almost
ended a Rose Bowl tour by squeezing a 7-6 vic
tory from the famous "Vowing Sophs," the
tables turned but not the spirit.
And last season when the Farm migrated to
Westwood Village and made the adolescent kid
look like he should put his football team back in
short pants the hospitality was unaffected.
What happens on the football grid tomorrow
is important, but more so is the fulfillment of a
traditional obligation which excels the legend
ary "southern hospitality" and offers instead
an unequaled display of the northern brandâ€”
with everything but the juleps.
