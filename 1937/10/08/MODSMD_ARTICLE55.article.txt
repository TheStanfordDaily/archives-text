MOST popular entertainer on the Concert
Series, according to a prediction in The
Daily a few days ago, will be a Negress, Marian
Anderson.
Miss Anderson, according to the announce
ment, can and will sing types of music other
than Negro spirituals. She is a successful, edu
cated woman, and this despite the fact that she
had little chance of entering Stanford, or a
number of similar institutions, as a student.
It's not that Stanford regards Miss Anderson
as the Romans regarded the barbarian gladia
tors, someone not quite human whose antics
were amusing. Miss Anderson is competing
with pure Aryans. And Stanford says that no
person is refused because of race, color, or
creed, citing a few graduate students and one
or two undergraduates who have been admitted.
But there seem to be none registered now.
If precedent is to be relied upon, Stanford
seems to feel that Ngroes would create too
great a problem at a residence university, and
so passes over a national problem, the solution
of which lies primarily in the field of education.
When she appears in Stanford's Memorial
Theater on February 24, Miss Anderson could
delicately thumb her nose—but she won't.—

rooms. Students could then type papers while
having easy access to references, and could
avoid the waste effort of copying out notes in
longhand and then going elsewhere to pound
the keys or pay 15 cents a page to professional
secretaries.
Present library facilities include no adequate
place for typing —only a little cubbyhole behind
the Document Room which may be used at
special hours with special permission and with
self-owned typewriters.
Thus while most Stanford professors ask that
student themes be typed, double-spaced, and
neatly margined—Stanford's library offers no
panacea to a crying need.—J. R.
