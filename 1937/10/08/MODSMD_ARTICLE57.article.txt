AND WE SINCij TRA-LA
TO those of us who are slightly wearied by the cur
rent vogue for soul searing Drama That Makes You
Think, the prospect of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta
is decidedly welcome. For some time, the idea has
been growing upon us that the college student, like a
Martini, should be stirred gently, not shaken, and the
high pressure emotion of modern drama has left us
more muddled than moved.
It remains to be seen how well "Trial by Jury"
will fit in with "Murder in the Cathedral," which we
are assured is a penetrating exploration of the soul,
not a double bill detective story. Indeed, the titles
sound a bit too much like a crime-does-not-pay se
quence to raise any soaring hopes. But the very fact
that Gilbert and Sullivan is to be presented indicates a
decided lightening of the fog of dramatic emotion
ality.

Ever since they were written, Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas have suffered from the popular superstition
that anything good must be either hard to take or deep
and stirring. Sociologists could probably run this cul
ture trait back to our cave painting ancestors. Doubt
less their pictures of tigers and buffalo were cheap
stuff, and their indecipherable scrawls were "cultural."
This tradition, whatever its origin, has burdened
mankind with more misery making cultural efforts
than any of the other censoring customs that kibitz
over the shoulder of genius. It makes us suspicious of
works that entertain instead of giving a preview of
hell. It makes us waste talent and time on roller
coastcr plays that jolt us up and put us out just where
we started. And it makes us feel a trifle guilty when
we go to a light opera instead of a saga of the soul.

r fallacy of this antique principle is proved by an
analysis of any Gilbert and Sullivan work. Anyone
will concede that they are entertaining. In fact, when
they opened in New York a few years ago, both grand
opera and the current strip-tease favorite lost patron
age. And at the same time, it is obvious that the op
eretta tunes have outlived nine-tenths of the sym
phonies describing the battle of Peritonitis with the
griffin. Satire runs through all Gilbert and Sullivan
works, and satire is much harder to handle than any
emotional throttle-hold.

And yet, when we schedule "Trial by Jury" instead
of some turgid problem play, there is head shaking and
muttering into beards. Budding Booths and Bernhardts
say that it is not art, that it has no "message." We who
are expected to attend it are thankful that our bat
tered appreciation will not be assaulted again.
Students get quite enough problems in class. We
like Gilbert and Sullivan, and if we have to receive a
"message" we would prefer to get it via Western
Union.
