Mr. Bill Murrish
Editor, Daily California!!
13 OY SWANFELDT told me that you were interested
in the progress made down on this campus in
regard to Wasserman tests and syphilis education.
Well, at the risk of prolonging the reputation I got
last year, I'll try to give you an idea of what we've
done (which is very little).
First, to dispel any notions you may have that we
have made gigantic strides towards banishing the
demon from the University, I'd better mention that
Wasserman tests were always provided for those who
wanted them and were willing to pay for them. But
next year the price definitely will be reduced from
$1.90 to one dollar. And there's a possibility that we
might be able to haev them done free at the county
health office. Moreover, we are assured that more
students will make use of them since the volume of
business done by Mr. Wasserman increased ten-fold
last term after the series of "educational" articles ap
peared in the Bruin. A correspondingly greater in
crease in the number who will make use of this service
is forecast by our Dr. Donafd MacKinnon, head of
men's health service.
That is the sum total (a little redundant, yes?) of the
progress that we fighting journalists have made. But
we did accomplish something, since Doc MacKinnon
told me that he got about five patients a day who read
the articles in the Bruin, and then read their souls
and then rushed down to the eminent practitioner with
loud cries of anguish. Before our little series, so we
are informed, the number of real or imaginative un
fortunates was about one or two a month.
* * * *
THE WAY, I've been assuming that you are ac
quainted with these syphilis articles v/e ran last
term. But if you are not, I'll give forth with a brief
resume. We opened the whole affair with a story
practically lifted from your sheet about a petition you
Berkeleyites were circulating asking for Wassermans,
then followed a series of "news" stories telling how
men and women doctors and administration heads fa
vored Wasserman tests. In conjunction with these new
features, a column ran spasmodically on the feature
page. It was supposedly educational but since it was
written by a kid and not an authority, I don't think it
did much more than keep the topic alive. Here the
whole gory mess would have ended 'twere it not fox
some letters of horrified protest we received from some
of the worthy citizens of Los Angeles. One woman
coldly informed us that she would rather see her
daughter (poor girl) dead in her coffin than going to
such a cesspool of iniquity as U.C.L.A.
In conclusion, I think I had better mention that
McKinnon thinks that anti-syphilis campaigns aren't
as important in college as tuberculosis and mental
hygiene was. He points out that at Minnesota, where
compulsory Wassermans were instituted, only ten
positive reactions were obtained—less than one-fifth of
one per cent. Even though, he continued, California
students are probably more immoral than Minnesotans
(sic!), the percentage would still be very low. Fur
thermore, he thinks results would be practically nil
among freshman students. And this led to a very epi
grammatic statement from the doctor. We should, he
said, Educatc the Freshmen and Test the Seniors.
I trust the above information satisfies your needs.

Everett Carter

some letters of horrified protest we received from some
of the worthy citizens of Los Angeles. One woman
coldly informed us that she would rather see her
daughter (poor girl) dead in her coffin than going to
such a cesspool of iniquity as U.C.L.A.
In conclusion, I think I had better mention that
McKinnon thinks that anti-syphilis campaigns aren't
as important in college as tuberculosis and mental
hygiene was. He points out that at Minnesota, where
compulsory Wassermans were instituted, only ten
positive reactions were obtained—less than one-fifth of
one per cent. Even though, he continued, California
students are probably more immoral than Minnesotans
(sic!), the percentage would still be very low. Fur
thermore, he thinks results would be practically nil
among freshman students. And this led to a very epi
grammatic statement from the doctor. We should, he
said, Educatc the Freshmen and Test the Seniors.
I trust the above information satisfies your needs.

Mr. Bill Murrish
Editor, Daily California!!
13 OY SWANFELDT told me that you were interested
in the progress made down on this campus in
regard to Wasserman tests and syphilis education.
Well, at the risk of prolonging the reputation I got
last year, I'll try to give you an idea of what we've
done (which is very little).
First, to dispel any notions you may have that we
have made gigantic strides towards banishing the
demon from the University, I'd better mention that
Wasserman tests were always provided for those who
wanted them and were willing to pay for them. But
next year the price definitely will be reduced from
$1.90 to one dollar. And there's a possibility that we
might be able to haev them done free at the county
health office. Moreover, we are assured that more
students will make use of them since the volume of
business done by Mr. Wasserman increased ten-fold
last term after the series of "educational" articles ap
peared in the Bruin. A correspondingly greater in
crease in the number who will make use of this service
is forecast by our Dr. Donafd MacKinnon, head of
men's health service.
That is the sum total (a little redundant, yes?) of the
progress that we fighting journalists have made. But
we did accomplish something, since Doc MacKinnon
told me that he got about five patients a day who read
the articles in the Bruin, and then read their souls
and then rushed down to the eminent practitioner with
loud cries of anguish. Before our little series, so we
are informed, the number of real or imaginative un
fortunates was about one or two a month.
* * * *
THE WAY, I've been assuming that you are ac
quainted with these syphilis articles v/e ran last
term. But if you are not, I'll give forth with a brief
resume. We opened the whole affair with a story
practically lifted from your sheet about a petition you
Berkeleyites were circulating asking for Wassermans,
then followed a series of "news" stories telling how
men and women doctors and administration heads fa
vored Wasserman tests. In conjunction with these new
features, a column ran spasmodically on the feature
page. It was supposedly educational but since it was
written by a kid and not an authority, I don't think it
did much more than keep the topic alive. Here the
whole gory mess would have ended 'twere it not fox
some letters of horrified protest we received from some
of the worthy citizens of Los Angeles. One woman
coldly informed us that she would rather see her
daughter (poor girl) dead in her coffin than going to
