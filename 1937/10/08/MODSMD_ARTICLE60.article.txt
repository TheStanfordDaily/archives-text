# Quiet Spanish Town Scene Of War Tale
## 
### 
The town of Santa Euialia is, or
was, situated on the island of Ibiza,
one of the smaller Balearics in the
Mediterranean off the coast of
Spain. How the Civil War came to
Santa Euialia, and what it did to it,
is told by Elliott Paul in his just
published "Life and Death of a
Spanish Town."
The first half of Mr. Paul's book
is called "4000 8.C.—1936." Within
that six-thousand-year framework
the life of Santa Euialia has been
going on in much the same placid
and unvarying way in season and
out, the people interested in much
the same things they have always
been interested in: something to
drink, someone to love, a song to
sing and a place to sleep.
Politics Are Nil
Politics have not meant so much
to them, because they have been
much too easy-going and happy.
Politics have been something to talk
about in an idle hour, never some
thing for which to die.
The three or four great landown
ers who live around the town, the
little group of priests who hang on
with grim determination to their
prerogatives in the last temporal
stronghold of the Catholic Church,
plus the one or two avowed Fascists
—a more select group of let-alone
people could not be found anywhere.
Communists Ignored
The few Communists who meet to
plot revolution, the anarchists, and
the over-excited radicals — not so
much scorned as ignored, they form
only a very minor part of the basic
ally good-natured and v»vy human
population of Santa Euialia.
In the main the people are just
like people anywhere. People like
Don Ramon, who is spared by Loy
alist troops because they agree that
20 years of being married to his wife
is hell enough for any man. People
like the peasant, Pep Salvador, who
refuses to sneak behind doors to say
what he thinks of the Church and
the Civil Guard, but shouts it down
the main street in such ringing tones
that no one dares put him in jail.
Quiet people, good people, a little
cynical and a little amoral, but de
manding no more than a chance to
live in peace and a certain amount
of liberty.
War Hits Country
Into this quiet life which Mr. Paul
describes so well out of the memo
ries of five summers, comes the war.
First it comes as an airplane, drop
ping pamphlets from the Loyalist
Government. Then it comes as mili
tary rule, clamped down by the pan
ic-stricken Guardia Civil. Then it
comes as freedom, brought by the
Loyalist troops. And finally, when
the Loyalist command decides to
withdraw from the Balearics and
concentrate on the defense of Ma
drid, it comes for the last time as the
all-oppressive rule of Generalissimo
Franco, a man no one had ever

heard of a month before. And Santa
Eulalia is dead.
Mr. Paul's tale mounts in speed
and terror as he describes his last
. month on the island—his arrival in
July prepared for another leisurely
summer, his instant impression that
| something is wrong, his attempts to
help his friends when the war reach
ies out across the sea and encircles
their island, and finally his leave
taking aboard a German cruiser in
mid-August.
Ends in Optimism
Many of Mr. Paul's friends are
i dead 01* in hiding, Santa Eulalia is
in ruins; yet his story ends on a
high note of hope for Spain and
humanity.
As he stands at the rail looking
back at the remains of the town,
there suddenly passes close beside
the cruiser a ship which he recog
nizes. It is the old "Isabella Mata
tutes," long a stationary character
istic of Santa Eulalia harbox*. Some
how, she has been fitted up, and
aboard her, sailing for no one knows
what port, is a gayly-waving group
of his best and dearest friends.
Thus the story ends. It is not
pleasant to think of Santa Eulalia
lying dead in the Mediterranean,
after one has come to know it and
its people so well. But there is one
consolation: one can always remem
ber the old hulk "Isabella Matatutes"
slowly and majestically limping out
to sea with her jaunty sail and her
cargo of men of good will.
