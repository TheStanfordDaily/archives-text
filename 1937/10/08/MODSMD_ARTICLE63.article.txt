# CAMPUS OPINION
## MAYBE HE'S RIGHT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In view of the general alarm and
consternation occasioned by Mr.
Cope's letter lhst Monday, 1
should like to add a few words of
my own.
No intelligent, far-sighted person
who read Mr. Cope's letter could
possibly do so without a slight feel
ing of apprehension. One of my
main reasons for enrolling in Stan
ford was the fact of its comparative
ly small student body and its air o!
friendliness and informality. It is
with regret that I see this aspect of
college life passing away.
How many of the people who
squawk about leaving things just as
they have been for the past 50 year;;
would tolerate life on a farm with
out running water and electricity
just because "the old pump and lamp
have been there for 50 years"? The
mere fact that the equipment has
been there that long should indi
cate that a change is necessary.
We're living in a modern, fast
changing world, and we must keep
up with it. But keeping up with the
world can be a well balanced proc
essâ€” neither the de-bunking of all
that has been held sacred, nor the
carrying along of various "white
elephants" simply because of their
age. We who love Stanford hope
that this balance will be kept through
the many transitional periods which
are bound to follow.
Karen
