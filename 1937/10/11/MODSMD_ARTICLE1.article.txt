# Lewis Plans Dual Union Organization
## C.I.O. Official Attacks Unions' Suspension; Peace Hopes Blasted 
### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Oct. 10
(UP). —John L. Lewis, condemning
the suspension of the 10 C.1.0. un
ions from the American Fedex - ation
of Labor as "cowardly" and "con
temptible," disclosed plans tonight
for setting up a permanent dual or
ganization which blasted all hopes of
an immediate peace in the current
trade union war.
Lewis, here for the C.1.0.'s first
"war council," told newspapermen
that since the C.1.0. unions have
been suspended by the A. F. of L.
they already consider themselves
"out of the federation" and that their
attitude toward reports that the fed
eration convention in Denver will
vote to expel them is one of "com
plete indifference."
Green Denounced
"We have seen the forces of the
American Federation of Labor in
opposition to the principles of trade
unionism," Lewis said. "We have
seen the federation in co-operation
with corporate interests opposed to
the interests of the workers.
"The suspension of the C.1.0. un
ions was a cowardly and contempt
ible act characteristic of President
William Green of the federation and
some of his associates.
"We do not consider ourselves to
be a part or parcel of the federation
and we will give consideration at our
meeting here to protect C.1.0. mem
bers and to further establish the
C.1.0. as the principal labor move
ment in America."
Support F.D.R.
As C.1.0. leaders gathered for
their conference, it was indicated
the organization would support any
move by President Roosevelt to
place a "quarantine" on Japanese
business and trade.
The C.1.0. chieftains trod care
fully, however, on the Sino-Japanese
war question. Unlike delegates to
the American Federation of Labor
convention in Denver, who whooped
and yelled for an economic boycott
of Japan, the C.1.0. leaders are
holding their fire until Mx\ Roosevelt
acts. The A. F. of L. and the C. I. O.
together have more than 6,000,000
adherents.

Lewis, here for the C.1.0.'s first

that since the C.1.0. unions have
been suspended by the A. F. of L.
they already consider themselves
"out of the federation" and that their
attitude toward reports that the fed
eration convention in Denver will
vote to expel them is one of "com
plete indifference."
Green Denounced
"We have seen the forces of the
American Federation of Labor in
opposition to the principles of trade
unionism," Lewis said. "We have
seen the federation in co-operation
with corporate interests opposed to
the interests of the workers.
"The suspension of the C.1.0. un
ions was a cowardly and contempt
ible act characteristic of President
William Green of the federation and
some of his associates.
"We do not consider ourselves to
be a part or parcel of the federation
and we will give consideration at our
meeting here to protect C.1.0. mem
bers and to further establish the
C.1.0. as the principal labor move
ment in America."

As C.1.0. leaders gathered for

the organization would support any
move by President Roosevelt to
place a "quarantine" on Japanese
business and trade.
The C.1.0. chieftains trod care
fully, however, on the Sino-Japanese
war question. Unlike delegates to
the American Federation of Labor
convention in Denver, who whooped
and yelled for an economic boycott
of Japan, the C.1.0. leaders are
