## 
### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, Oct. 11 (U.R).—The Chinese government today
formally charged Japanese forces with using poison gas, "believed to be
mustard gas," in artillery operations around Shanghai.
The health ministry, which made the charge after the Chinese delega
tion at the League of Nations Assembly had made similar infernal charges

last week, said at least 1500 Chinese*
soldiers were affected over the
week-end.
The supposedly "gassed" Chinese
troops were sent to Nanking for
treatment, the health ministry said.
Nipponese "Admit"
Foreign embassies at Nanking
were notified of the Chinese accu
sations and warned that gas masks
would be useless against mustard
gas, if that is what the Japanese
were using.
The Japanese military spokesman
took cognizance of the charges to
the extent of insisting that the sup
posed "gas" about which the Chi
nese had complained was the effect
of a high-powered explosive which
the Japanese use and which he ad
mitted "has an effect something
like gas."
Effect Hold
He said the gas given off by the
explosions "burned" victims, and in
some instances would prove fatal
since there was a considerable con
tent of carbon monoxide.
The Chinese military spokesman
supplemented the health ministry's
report with a statement that 24 Chi
nese deaths in the Lotien front Sun
day were caused by poison gas.
