WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (U.R).—
The Supreme Court is expected to
begin the real work of its new term
tomorrow by announcing decision
on two actions designed to oust its
newest member, Justice Hugo L.
Black, on technical grounds.
After a week of secret confer
ences on a docket containing more
than 300 cases, the court was i*eady
tonight to hand down a series of
orders accepting some and rejecting
others. Among them, it is expected,
will be two petitions affecting Black.
Even if both actions are thrown
out, Black might be challenged again
by a litigant before the court who
was able to contend that Black's
former oath as a Klansman indi
cated prejudice that would unfit him
for sitting in the particular case.
The court also may announce
whether it will accept tests of two
New Deal laws regulating the secu
rities exchanges and commodities
markets. Already it has agreed to
review validity of the Public Works
Administration's policy of making
loans and grants to municipalities
for construction of power plants.
