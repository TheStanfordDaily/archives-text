# Kahn Urges Frosh To Try for Gaieties
## 
### 
It's easy to hop on Stanford's dra
matic wagon. Hal Kahn, director of
this year's Big Game Gaieties, en
courages freshmen and others who
have had no experience, but who are
interested in acting, singing, dancing,
writing, or composing music, to try
out for the Gaieties.
Most of the Farm's stage stars
started as lower division students i
with little or no experience. Shirley j
Jones, favorite swing vocalist, went
out for a singing part when she was
a sophomore without any previous
musical training because urged by
her friends to try. And now she's at
the top.
Bud Cady, president of the new

dramatic society and a prominent
player in the last two Gaieties, got
his start by turning in a short skit
when he first came to Stanford. Gene

[ Callnon and J. P. Cahn were stage
hands a couple of years ago, and to
day they are the top student techni-
I cal directors.
Kay Campbell and Frances Far
-1 mer, stars of last year's "Lady Pre
cious Stream," went out for dra
i matics when they were sophomores
and rapidly worked their way up.
Gerry Schrieber took part in read
ings when she was a freshman, and
her work was rewarded with lead
ing parts in "Roadside" and "Lady
, Precious Stream."
Grad Successes
Many Gaieties stars of recent years
I are meeting success in the outside
I world, according to Kahn. Doodles

Weaver, longtime chief Farm funny
man, is now under contract to RKO,

Gaieties skit, is writing for Scrib
ner's Magazine.

duction should be turned in at the
