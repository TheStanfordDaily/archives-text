# Rebuilt Red Machine Smashes Bruins, 12-7
## Victory Boosts Indians' Grid Hopes; Fay, Ledeboer, Groves Star 
### GENE GEAR 
The transformation took place before the eyes of a befuddled Bruin and
15,000 spectators.
Tiny Thornhill slipped a new pair of spark plugs into the Little Red
Kiddie Kar Saturday afternoon and in a few minutes Stanford nutters
were again cheering for the Big Red Machine of old. The Indians toyed

with the invading fcsruins irom<
U.C.L.A. for 59V2 minutes of thrill
ing football and sent them home
with a sound 12-7 spanking.
New Spark Piugs
The two new spark plugs were a
pair of fleet halfbacks, Pete Fay and
Freddie Ledeboer, who ran wild
against the Westwood gridders. Fay
averaged 5 yards per carry, and
Ledeboer ripped off an average of
5.8 yards. And the Cards have
found a kicker in this boy Fay. Near
the end of the first quarter Pete
sent out a beautiful spiral punt
which landed 59 yards from the
scrimmage line.
The blue and gold rooters left
for home yesterday with just one
slim consolation—they were lucky
the score wasn't 18-0. With less
than a minute to play the Cards
had the ball on the Bruin 6-yard
line with one down to make one
yard and a first down. The Indians
took too much time in the huddle
and were set back five yards. Then
the Indians had to pass and the in
experienced Chet Patton threw one
into the waiting arms of U.C.L.A.'s
Mr. Hal Hirshon, who scooted 95
yards down the sideline for a touch
down.
Big Lead at Half
The Indians scored once in the first
quarter and again in the second to
go out at half time with a comfort
able 12-point lead. Midway in the
first period Hirshon fumbled an at
tempted punt and was forced out of
bounds on the Bruin 25. Ledeboer
picked up six yards on a spinner at |
th£ left side of the Uclan line. Jim \
Groves hit right tackle for 2, but a i
five-yard penalty put the Cards back ;
on the 22-yard line.
This didn't dismay the Indians.
Groves slipped back and sent, a pass
into the clutching fingers of Acting
Captain Grant Stone for a first
down on the Bruin 13. Groves hit
the line, picking up three yards, and
on the next play sped around right
end for ten yards and a touchdown.
Groves' attempted conversion was
wide.
64-yard Drive
In the closing minutes of the sec
ond quarter the Stanford football
machine started a 64-yard drive for
the second Cardinal score of the day.
Ledeboer, aided by devastating
blocking, circled right end for 20
yards.
Fay tried left end and picked up
3 yards. Then Groves faded back
and passed to Ledeboer for a 23-
yard gain to the Bruin 20. A re
verse netted Fay only one yard, but
on the next play Fay sped around
the Bruin left end for 19 yards and
6 more points for the Indians.
2 to 1 on Ground
On the ground, Tiny's Stanfordites j
outgained the highly touted Bruin
ground machine 2 to 1, and in the j
air, where the Uclans were rated as
being extremely dangerous, the In
dians made more yardage on seven
passes than the Bruins did on 16.
Stanford piled up 180 yards from
scrimmage while U.C.L.A. was get
ting 92 on the ground. The Uclans
had as many passes intercepted as
they completed. They threw 16 aerial
bombshells, 7 clicking, 7 exploding
in their faces as interceptions, and
falling to the ground harmlessly. The
Indians threw 7 passes, completing
4, and had 2 intercepted.
*Of All Sad Words . .
Stanford played a brand of ball
that would have swept the Broncos
out of the stadium and annihilated
the Webfeet on their own grass up
north.
In exploding the Bruin "dark j
horse" team, the Indians have sent
the conference chase into a turmoil |
—that is for every team but Cali- ,
fornia. California is the only unde- j
