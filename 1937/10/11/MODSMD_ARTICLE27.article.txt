## 
### 
Dr. Elton Trueblood, University
chaplain, spoke in Memorial Church
yesterday morning on the rewards
of unselfishness. He said people
could overcome their own personal
difficulties by doing things for oth
ers even less fortunate than them
selves.
He spoke of Robert Louis Steven
son's life as an example of one who
was poor and sick but, through his
writing, gave unlimited happiness to
the world.
