# Twelve Stanfordites Summer In Mexico
## Summer School 'Excuse" for Extensive Visits to Latin-American Capital 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
At Stanford (his fall are 12 students who from now on will believe
most anything Professor Percy Martin of the history department has to
say. They are the twelve who last spring heard him suggest a summer
at the University of Mexico, traveled 2500 miles south to try it out.
By automobile and steamship they left Stanford for Mexico City late
last June. Two and a half months later they returned to report that I>r.
Martin had been right—very right. •
Wally Bassctt, Bill Bendel, and Jack Ellis were attracted by the new
Pan-American suncr-hiirhwav from Laredo. Texas, to the Mexican caoital.

drove their own cars down that way.
The other nine—Jean Ayres, Jean
Blaekman, Barbara Bradley, Ellen
Davis, Kathleen Mills, Jay Thorp,
Dave Botsford, Bill Phoenix, and
Herb Schoenlen—headed south by
sea, reached Acapulco live days after
the Panama-Pacific's S.S. California
left the Golden Gate, then took cars
285 miles to Mexico City.
Fun Spikkin' de Spcnich
Because the University summer
school operates no dormitories, the
American students at once found
hospitable Mexican homes, moved in
for one American dollar a day, room
and board. Some of these families
spoke English, some didn't. Much of
the summer's fun was learning
Spanish and actually speaking it.
The University of Mexico summer
school shouldn't be judged by
American standards. While all
American colleges accept its cred
its, the summer school was more the
"excuse" than, the "reason for 520
Americans spending a summer in
Mexico. A third of the courses —
such as Mexican history, art, busi
ness, sociology, and elementary
Spanish—were taught in English for
Americans not understanding Span
ish. More advanced courses, for
Spanish majors, were taught in
Spanish. All the professors were
native Mexicans, consequently as
curious about the students as the
students were about them.
Farm Girls Dance
Every Thursday afternoon the
school entertained its students in
the sun-lit patio with Mexican or
chestras, singers, and dancers wear
ing their elaborate native costumes.
When the time came for the Ameri
cans to perform, Stanfordites Ellen
Davis and Barbara Bradley showed
the Mexicans they had actually
learned something by performing
native dances in spangled "china
poblana" costumes.
Some people claim the "real Mex
ico" is outside Mexico City, Ameri
canized and Europeanized as it has
become. Thus on week-ends Stan
lord's representatives hired cars
(taxis are a little more than 50
American cents an hour for all you
can cram in) to take them east to
Puebla, south to sub-tropical Cuer
navaca and picturesque Taxco. After
school had finished, some railroaded
north to Guadalajara and Lake Cha
pala before returning to Acapulco.
Being nearly all Catholics, Mexi
cans invite their friends and rela
tives to a perpetual round of "fies
tas" to honor their saints' days. It
wasn't hard for the American stu
dents to get in on them. At these
genial parties -such hospitality is
almost unknown in the States —
guests danced, sang, drank tequila
cocktails, had tremendous times. Get
invited to one and you're set —some-
one there will invite you to another,
and so on all through the summer.
Alternoon "siestas" (stores and of-

I fiees all over Mexico close from 1 to
I 4 o'clock in the afternoon so em
ployees and shoppers can, go home
j for u big dinner and a nap)—were
j interrupted only when other Farm
j sters dropped into the capital for
; short visits, had to see all they
j could in a week or so. Bernie Mc-
Kay and Alice Banker visited Jay
j Thorp for a week, enjoyed the
j Thursday summer - school dance
along with the countless cathedrals,
j pyramids, palaces, and murals that
| every American tourist puts him
i self out to see.
Margaret Loud, Larry Livingston,
Bud and Mike Milligan were other
j short-stayers. Though they enjoyed
j themselves while they could, they
; found that a week or two in Mexico
] was little more than seeing it in a
Southern Pacific travelougue.
The Easy Life
j Mexico City, 7(500 feet above the
- sea, was high enough to be temper
! ate and cool, with a climate com
' parable to summer San Francisco,
j But in Acapulco it was hot and
I sticky, life slow and easy. While
' waiting four or five days for the S.S.
' California, eight of the Stanford
! students led an ideal South-Sea-ish
' existence.
j Breakfast about 10, unless they
i had been up early to go deep-sea
j fishing—then sun and swimming on
| the white sandy beaches till 2—a
big Mexican meal and "siesta" till
j s:3o—the water again till almost 8—
j supper about 9—the rest of the eve
j ning drinking foamy Mexican beer
I or powerful Mexican tequila in the
j quiet fairly-coolness of the Seven
j Seas Tavern—a guitar and songs
from somewhere in the night—bed
j again.
But after almost ten weeks in
Mexico, they rehopped the steamer
| and came home. Today their bawl
| out record shows nine additional
! units, their bank-account shows an
1 expenditure somewhat less than a
! quarter at Stanford, and their mem
! ories—well, ask any of them.
