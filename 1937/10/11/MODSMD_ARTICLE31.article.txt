# Here's What Stanford Students Do In Mexico

### 
SUMMER SCHOOL in Mexico City didn't mean the ordinary class
room-and-study routine to Farm students who earned nine Stanford
units at the University of Mexico last July and August. Bill Phoenix
and Jay Thcrp (upper left) climbed into this mine-shaft elevator, shot
1000 feet underground (o view (he insides of the world's largest
mercury-and-antimony mine, loeated cast of Taxco. Bernie McKay
and Alice Banker (upper right) were entertained by exhibitions of
Mcxicna songs and dances in the University's sun-lit patio. Dressed in
a typical Mexican "charro" costume, Larry Livingston (lower left)
rode horseback at Mexico City's Rancho del Charro. As most of the
Stanford students traveled to Mexico by sea, Jay Thorp (lower right)
enjoyed deck games aboard Panama-Pacific's S. S. California between
San Francisco and Acapulco. Though none did, Mexico City's visitors
were invited to "get rich" by national lottery winnings (center).
