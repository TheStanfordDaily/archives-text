The Sun shone brightly, not a
cloud dotted the blue sky, but water
assuming flood proportions swept
through Ihe Cellar Saturday morn
ing, giving customers a slight idea of
how inhabitants of Johnstown felt on
j a famous wet day in 1888.
But it wasn't the dam that broke
I Saturday, merely the main sewer on
Lasuen, causing water to backwash
into the Cellar about 10 o'clock. It
started its rise behind the counter
but soon made its way out to the
feet of cash customers. At its peak,
(he water was about a foot high
throughout the lower part of the
I Cellar.
Mops and buckets were employed
for bailing out, and repairs by the
plumbers about noon succeeded in
lowering the water level. Only evi
dences of the disaster to be seen
late yesterday were highly polished
floors and a certain dampness
.which slightly effected the "foom
idity."
If a man fails to pay his debts in
some parts of China, his creditors
carry away one of his doors.
