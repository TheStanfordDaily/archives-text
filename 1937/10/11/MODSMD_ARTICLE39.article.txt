THE "WORM" WAS
BOUND TO TURN

Well, the worm was bound to turn
one of these Saturday afternoons and
much to the consternation of El
Bruin, the Stanford revival took
place while the Westwood beast
was on the same stadium floor.
Tiny found a back field foursome
out of his wealthy mine of hall
packing artists that really clicks in
a big way. Al AI ust i/.a was at
quarter, and should still see plenty
of action even when Bill Paulman
returns. Alusti/.a did a nice job in
blocking and tackling. He only
carried the ball on one occasion
and picked up four yards for his
elTort.
Freddie Ledeboer was in there at
right half and Pete Fay at left half
for the Indians. These two aver
aged 5.8 yards and 5 yards respec
tively every time they carried the
hall. Old "Piston Legs" Ledeboer
runs like a frightened antelope and
was a whiz at snagging passes.
Blond Pete Fay is the fastest man
on the Indian squad and he sure
proved it against the Bruins. And
what a kicker! Tiny's really got a
punter in there now who can send
any team on the coast back on its
heels. Fay's first kick in the first
quarter traveled nearly 75 yards in
the air. It was good for 59 yards
from scrimmage.

BOBBY GRAYSON CAN
PICK WINNERS

The Stanford punting average was
only 32.9, which was due to some
short but weli placed out-of-bounds
kicks.
It looks like Bobby Grayson sure
hit the nail on the head in the broad
cast Friday night. Bobby said the
Indians were going to win that ball
game—that he was willing to bet
anything on it. He said the boys
were fired up for this one—l'll say
they were fired up. The Bruins
were lucky to escape back to West
wood wtih just a 5-point shellack
ing.
The Stanford footballers made
my 20-13 win prediction for Ucla
look pretty silly. But then, I was
only trying to change our luck.
Win forecasts for Stanford over
Santa Clara and Oregon proved to
be fateful. Sports writers up and
down the coast will be thinking
up various excuses on why they
picked the Bruins, but I'll stand by
my alibi.
The U.C.L.A. bench re
ported for duty over across the field
with nice, neat white eyeshades.
That's quite an idea. It's no fun
facing that sun all during the game
as the Stanford rooting section will
find out during the Big Game.

KENNY WASHINGTON
STOPPED BY CARDS

Kenny Washington, the ebony
threat from the southland, proved
he was all that has been said about
him, but he still didn't make much
headway against the Indians. Wash
ington carried the ball 13 times for
an average of 2.8 yards per carry.
Two other Uclan backs beat this
average—Walt Schell, the fullback,
and Billy Bob Williams, the second
string fullback.
Washington's passing wasn't
very effective against the Cards'
impressive aerial defense. They
had as many intercepted as they
completed—seven and seven.
The Bruin kickers were barely
getting their punts off all afternoon,
as a rejuvenated Stanford line
charged through on them. One kick
was blocked when Irv Cummings
crashed through near the start of
the second quarter to' block Wil
liams' punt in the middle of the
field.

J. Edgar Hoover, director of the
federal bureau of investigation, says
that G-men have killed only nine
criminals of the 21,000 taken into
custody in the last three years.
