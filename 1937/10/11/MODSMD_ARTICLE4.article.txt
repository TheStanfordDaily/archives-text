# Union to Picket S.F. Hospital
## University Institution Quits Negotiations 
### 
Picketing of the Stanford Hospi
tal, Webster and Sacramento Streets,
San Francisco, is scheduled to begin
this morning, according to an an
nouncement issued by M. J. Rowan,
business representative of the Hos
pital and Institutional Workers' Un
ion, affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor.
Cause of the picketing, Rowan de
clared, is that the hospital withdrew
from negotiations between the union
and the Hospital Conference. Nego
tiations closed late last week when
13 other San Francisco hospitals in
the conference signed conti-acts with
the union. ,
Of 18-month duration, the agree
ment provides for $90 minimum
wage, eight-hour day, six-day week,
preferential employment and recog
nition of the union as bargaining
agent.
Employees planning to picket the
Stanford Hospital today include jani
toi's, porters, laundry workers,
painters, elevator operators, and
miscellaneous employees.
PALO ALTO GARAGEMEN
TO WALK OUT TODAY
A strike of automobile lubrication,
washing, and service men will be
gin at 8 o'clock this morning in Palo
Alto garages, if demands for union
wage and hour contracts are not
met by that time, declared Business
Agent Harry Starling of the Garage
Employees Local No. 556, a sub
sidiary of the A. F. of L. Internation
al Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Union demands are for a 48-hour
week, with minimum daily wages
varying from $4.50 to $5. These de
mands parallel agreements now in
effect in San Mateo County, Starling
said.
Local garage owners state that ne
gotiations with the union fell
through because they regard the
proposed contract as discriminatory,
since it would apply only to motor
car dealers and garages and would
not include filling station operators
which offer similar services.
