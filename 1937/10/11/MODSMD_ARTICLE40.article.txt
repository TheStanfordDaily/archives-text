### 
POLO GROUNDS, New York, Oct.
10 (U.R).—The New York Yankees
today shattered all previous records
in winning the world championship
for the sixth time.
Lefty Gomez' brilliant pitching
and unexpected hitting tenabled the
Yanks to beat the New York Giants,
4-2, in today's fifth and final game
of the 1937 series. In beating Bill
Terry's National Leaguers, four
games to one, the Yanks displayed
not only impressive power but also
the most flawless fielding in the
classic history. They finished the
series without an error, a leat never
accomplished by any other club.
Gomez Stars
Gomez, a skinny, black - haired
southpaw from Rodeo, Calif., became
the third pitcher in series history to
win five games without a d«. feat,
equaling the record held by two
previous flingers, Jack Coombs and
Herb Pennock.
Although Gomez yielded 10 hits
to the Giants, he kept them scattered
and extricated himself from sev
eral bad spots when everybody in
the stadium except Gomez thought
that he was about to be blasted from
the hill.
Hits Winning Run
Lefty, who is known to his pals
as "Goofy," also won his own game
by driving in what proved to be the
winning run in the fifth with his
lone hit of the series. Lefty won the
opening game of this series, Wed
nesday. He won two in '36 against
the Giants, and one in the '32 series
against the Cubs.
The Giants touched Lefty for their
two runs in the third when Mel Ott,
third baseman, connected with a fast
one and sent it into the upper right
field stands, scoring Dick Bartell
ahead of him and tying the score.
It was the Giants' lone four-bagger
of the series.
Gomez' mates banged three Giant
pitchers for 10 hits, including home
runs by Myril Hoag and Joe DiMag
gio.
Iluag Score
Hoag opened the scoring in the
second when he blasted one of Cliff
Melton's southpaw deliveries into
the upper right field stands. DiMag
gio, the Yanks' center fielder,
slammed the second homer off.Mel
ton in the third inning, lifting it
clear over the top of the upper left
stand. It hit a flagpole on the roof
and bounced back into the field.
After Ott's four ■» bagger had
evened the count in the third, the
Yanks forged two runs ahead in the
fifth. Gomez, the "hitless wonder,"
singled off second baseman Burgess
Whitehead's glove, scoring veteran
Tony Lazzeri, who had tripled to the
right center wall. This proved to be
the winning run. Incidentally Laz
zeri, who was considered "washed
up" by many at the end of the sea
son, was the batting hero of the
classic, hitting around .400.
