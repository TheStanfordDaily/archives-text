# Trojan Frosh Triumph Over Papoose, 14-0
## 
### 
Southern California's frosh foot
ball team had too many guns for
Stanford's Papooses when they met
and beat them 14-0 in the Coliseum
as a prologue to the U.S.C.-Ohio
State game Saturday.
Captain Norm Standlee and his
tomahawk-carrying warriors were
not only unable tq get any Trobabe
scalp, they weren't able keep their
own tufts of hair against the on
slaughts of the young Trojans', two
edged blades.
Peoples Scores
Southern Cal's Fullback Bob Peo
ples, better known as a basketball
player, led his band of warriors
twice into Papoose territory in ex
cursions which brought home the
bacon.
Peoples himself scox-ed the first
touchdown in the first half with • a
four-yard line plunge after the Tro
babes had driven 70 yards down
the field in 11 plays.
Loss No Surprise
In spite of the improvement the
Card Frosh have shown since their
opening game with Santa Ana J. C.,
their loss to U.S.C. did not come
completely as a surprise, because
this year the Trojans are conceded
to have the strongest frosh football
team on the coast.
The Stanford frosh have now faced
the worst. From now on they can
point for the Cal game, the climax
of their season, knowing that the
Cubs can show them nothing that
they haven't seen before.
COLUMBUS, 0., Oct. 10 (UP).—
An unidentified man walked into
M. E. Boden's filling station, drop
ped a nickel in the pay telephone—
and out popped a snake. Boden said
the man hurried away, muttering
to himself.
