# Grid Leaders Topple In Week-end Upsets
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
So it was going to be a pipe week-end for the big-shot teams and grid
score pickers. Maybe we got our dates mixed up. or something, but
nuthing (\vith one exception—those boring Boars and their touchdown
quota again) came out as the wise boys guaranteed.
In the first place, there is a little matter of a last-minute pass to be
I discussed. It seems that a couple of guys named Joe who play for the

! Oregon Staters decided to blast a
1 deep hole in the road leading to
Washington's second - in - a - row
championship.
The Huskies; did fairly well for a
! while, holding on to a three-point
; lead until late into the final period.
! Then came the upset that knocked
the conference race into a tight knot.
| Captain Fritz Waskowitz of the
j Washingtons, after making a sweet
punt return, fumbled, and Oregon
State recovered on the Huskies' 37.
The straw that broke the champs'
I collective back was a short pass play
.between the two Joes — Gray and
' Wendlick—for a touchdown and a
win, ti-3. The score was first six
-1 pointer made against Washington
! this year.
Conversion Trouble
Power plays, chauffeured by Amby
Sehindler, gave the first score, minus
conversion, to U.S.C. in the second
quarter. The count was tied up in
the third, mainly because of the
| running ability of the Buckeyes'
j fullback, Johnny Rubb. It came easy
j for the visitors, with very little
j tricky stuff enlivening the game.
The third score of the game moved
Ohio State into the lead when a 28-
yard pass into the flat chalked up
six points. The conversion was miss
ed, and that was another straw to
break some more backs.
Ho—Hum
Taking the kick-off, Troy needed
| five plays to move to Ohio State's
127, one pass with a fast receiver,
| and a conversion by a sub end to
j win the ball game. Things like that
oughta be outlawed.
The regular Saturday afternoon
practice session—with plenty of sub
stitutes to give those hard-working
first-string gentlemen their regular
rest—was held without incident at
the Berkeley Memorial Stadium.
Scoring their assigned four touch
downs with ease, the Cal Bears, Inc.,

W
are napping lightly after burying
Washington State as scheduled,
27-0.
Fumble-itis
The Galloping Gaels had an easy
time running away from the Wolf
pack from Nevada. 42-0. What's
more, the football had an easier time
getting away from both of them. A
total of 15 fumbles helped win the
game for the powerful St. Mary's
team, and gave Nevada plenty of
chance to score, but the punch was
lacking.
The Santa Clara Broncs uncere
moniously dumped the Dons from
U.S.F. very flat in the dust by a
count of 13-0. Leading all ihe way
by a one-touchdown margin, the
Broncs turned up the steam in the
last few minutes to push over an
other score.
It might be a good idea for all of
us to throw away our form charts
if this keeps up much longer.

In the first place, there is a little matter of a last-minute pass to be

Conversion Trouble
Power plays, chauffeured by Amby
Sehindler, gave the first score, minus
conversion, to U.S.C. in the second
quarter. The count was tied up in
the third, mainly because of the
| running ability of the Buckeyes'
j fullback, Johnny Rubb. It came easy
j for the visitors, with very little
j tricky stuff enlivening the game.
The third score of the game moved
Ohio State into the lead when a 28-
yard pass into the flat chalked up
six points. The conversion was miss
ed, and that was another straw to
break some more backs.
