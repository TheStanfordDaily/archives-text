## Sunday Nite Libe: Open and Shut Case 
### 
THE Stanford library is not run for the con
venience of Stanford undergraduates.
It is with no mild surprise and disillusionment
that this verbal bombardment from University
Library Director Nathan Van Patten crashes
home and sweeps away the horribly naive sen
timent that the Stanford library is for Stanford
students.
Now that the unexpected bombshell has burst
in our entrails to tell us in Van Patten's words
that "library hours are set for the convenience
of graduate students and faculty members," we
are to awaken, I suppose, to the awful realiza
tion that majority rule is considered too heavily
coated with the cobwebs of democracy to be
useful.
Last night Van Patten was interviewed on the
possibility of holding the libe open on Sun
day evening instead of Friday—a student re
quest which has lately become popular for
the after-dinner gripe conference, but by no
means a new one—when we were informed by
the director that the library staff would rather
not work Sunday evenings, and that library
hours are really not set for the convenience of
undergrads anyway.

As proof of the wisdom of the Friday night
opening over Sunday night, Director Van Pat
ten recalls statistics which show Friday to be
a more popular study day than the Sabbath—
he seems not to remember an unposed Daily
picture last fall which depicted a crowd of two
industrious students in the reference room on
Friday night.
Director Van Patten's explanation that the
budget has been already cut to the quick and
that the library cannot stay open an extra night
each week can be readily seen, but if there
must be a choice between two nights small
evidence is shown to support the present set-up.
There is no doubt whatsoever that under
grad library users, who outnumber all others
3 to 1, favor Sunday evening.
The Daily as a soundingboard for sparks of
student opinion has never intercepted one
which favors Friday.
So there would seem to be only one possible
explanation for the long-misunderstood mystery
behind the Stanford library's baffling week-end
hours. Finally the cat pops out of the bag.
The Stanford library is not being run for the
convenience of Stanford undergraduates.
