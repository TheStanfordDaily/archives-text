LARGE corporations are more efficient, econ
professors tell us; efficiency is the reason
they become large.
The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany is a large corporation, a subsidiary of one
of the largest monopolies in the world, but the
suspicion is beginning to seep through the
campus that it is neither efficient nor articulate
in its explanations.
Last month the official edict came from the
Bryant street office that smaller residences on
the campus must have pay phones. It wasn't
a new ruling, officials explained to The Daily;
the company merely had been lax in the past.
Last week The Daily learned that several
houses still had the old-type phone. The com
pany had changed its mind, officials explained
again; the deadline was to be next fall. In
coming calls at pay phones were far outnum
bering outgoing calls, which caused trouble in
some vague way. Pay installation had been
stopped and all houses had been informed that
they could have the old type back.
Even a cursory investigation or survey, it
seems, would have shown the probable ratio
of incoming calls to outgoing ones. It would
also have shown that in making an intra-campus
call, the caller had an even chance of not get
ting his party and losing his nickel after the
station called had responded.
And, a rather intensive Daily investigation
failed to explain why the company expected a
different call ratio next year, or what the com

pany could do if private phones were installed
in unlocked, upstairs rooms. Nor did it explain
why, if the company had not been forced to
change the phones in the past, it will be forced
to do so next year.
It was this changing of horses in midstream,
the seeming lack of forethought, that was sur
prising. Inconvenience and expense of the
change would have been bad enough; uncer
tainty as to what the final setup will be merely
makes it worse.â€”L. L.
