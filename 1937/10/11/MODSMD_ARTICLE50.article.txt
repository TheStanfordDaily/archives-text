# BULL SESSION
## DINOSAURS PEEP OVER THE HILL 
### 
I BROWSING over Sunday morning coffee, I leafed
through a couple of newspaper supplements, won
dering how many college professors had given that
glamorous damsel, Truth, some more sensational pub
licity. If I remember correctly, about three gentlemen
with assorted initials after their names had contrib
uted various bits of scientific material. Tailored to the
proletarian taste, these items were spread across the
magazine sections, ready for those who like something
gaudy and naughty and not at all neat.
Even so shortly afterward, I forget the subjects of
lhesc smoking revelations. One, I believe, predicted
the coming of an ice age in the next geologic epoch.
The somnolent reader was given the impression that
he might as well junk his refrigerator immediately;
and if any fur-bearing animals read it, they wei'e
justified in wondering how they would look as coats.

Professors all over the country squirm and feel
vaguely that their noble calling has stopped a nasty
one below the belt'. The well known general public
squints out of its door, sees no onrushing glacier, feels
no icy draft on its neck, and concludes that all pro
fessors are crazy. It becomes apparent that relations
between professors and press are about as muddled as a
home-made cocktail; frequently thejP have the same
explosive qualities.
A number of years ago some bright young feature
writer discovered that this stuff they called Science
had possibilities if it was handled right. Since that
time, no Sunday has passed that glaring headlines did
not tell the man-in-the-undershirt that the ptero
dactyls would get him if he didn't watch out. Crushed
with the blame for such absurdities, most professors
slunk off to their offices and refused to look at a
paper. The hardy few left in circulation Monday morn
ing continued to give out spicy bits about the goings
cn of Truth.

A S it stands now most professors curse the newspa
pers with all the vocabulary that goes with a
Ph.D., and a few renegades hit the glaring headlines
with monotonous regularity.
It is unfortunate, however, that teachers refuse to
meet reporters half-way. Newspapers are growing
away from sensational exposes of Science. The better
magazines are asking for accurate presentations of
fact; the public is no longer alarmed when they are
told that insects may take over a billion years from
now. But still many professors-with-principles sulk in
their offices like latter day Achilles. The loud-mouthed
inherit the supplements.
* ♦ * *
Those of us who credit professors with intelligence
and at least average discrimination are relieved to see
one or two emerging from obscurity. Perhaps if they
are accurately quoted and presented without high
school histrionics, their colleagues may follow them.
Until they do we will have to put up with loose talk
about express train ice ages; but very few of us will
bother to r*et fur coats.
