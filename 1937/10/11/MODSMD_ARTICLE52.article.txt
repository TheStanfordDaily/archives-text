TTEADLINER for the week-end, getting first call over
rally, jolly-up, game and dance, occurred when
one of Stanford's big guards kissed one of Stanford's
little left-half-backs. The occasion was a touchdown;
the place, the end zone of the Stanford Stadium; the
time, the twelfth minute of the second quarter in the
Stanford-U.C.L.A. football game played here Saturday.
That Austins are small cars is evidenced by several
evidences revealed lately about a Stanford Austin
which did tricks. Saturday after the game, the Row
was well crowded with cars and dissuasive to fast
traffic as well as any fonn of traffic. Pedestrians were
scattering for their lives as cars overburdened with
Indians and Bruins careened a few feet each minute
or so. Non-plussed and exasperated by the delay, the
owner of the little red limousine turned up the Phi
Delt driveway, then left onto the sidewalk, and clax
oning its way along made good headway up the row
despite the numerous pedestrians.
This all happened despite the rumor that our little
red roadster was demolished very completely when its
top ran into the Delta Chi lawn Thursday. The rumor
printed in the Daily as fact about its ability to carry
only the driver and one passenger was also confounded
Saturday as it sped up the row with a driver and two
passengers, albeit the third member of the party was
on the outside looking over.
It wasn't so long ago that our heroic little Austin
was lost while the owner parked in front of the Union
to take a girl in for a coke or two. After arduous
search it was found. So the girl and the guy climbed
in and drove out from among the bushes in front of
the Union. I

'J'HE poor little car is always losing its master and
vice-versa. Over in Berkeley the other day, it was
left on a street in the campus, and was spirited away
by some evil-doer or evil-doers so that it was missing
when the Stanford owner tried to get into it again and
come home. Searching the full hour between the dark
and the daylight, the wandering car was found in a
third floor back-room of a nearby Fraternity House.
DIRTY RUSHING—YAH!
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," said Juliet, and the
same thought must have drifted through the mind of
some Toyon visitor before he left last week-end. It
was so hard for him to leave one of his friends there
that the only evidence we have of his departure is a
laconic, "So long, Toby," scrawled on the Toyon Bulle
tin Board. This smells of tragedy, rough hew them
how we will.

This all happened despite the rumor that our little
red roadster was demolished very completely when its
top ran into the Delta Chi lawn Thursday. The rumor
printed in the Daily as fact about its ability to carry
only the driver and one passenger was also confounded
Saturday as it sped up the row with a driver and two
passengers, albeit the third member of the party was
on the outside looking over.
It wasn't so long ago that our heroic little Austin
was lost while the owner parked in front of the Union
to take a girl in for a coke or two. After arduous
search it was found. So the girl and the guy climbed
in and drove out from among the bushes in front of
the Union. I

'J'HE poor little car is always losing its master and
vice-versa. Over in Berkeley the other day, it was
left on a street in the campus, and was spirited away
by some evil-doer or evil-doers so that it was missing
when the Stanford owner tried to get into it again and
come home. Searching the full hour between the dark
and the daylight, the wandering car was found in a
third floor back-room of a nearby Fraternity House.
DIRTY RUSHING—YAH!
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," said Juliet, and the
same thought must have drifted through the mind of
some Toyon visitor before he left last week-end. It
was so hard for him to leave one of his friends there
that the only evidence we have of his departure is a
laconic, "So long, Toby," scrawled on the Toyon Bulle
tin Board. This smells of tragedy, rough hew them
how we will.
TTEADLINER for the week-end, getting first call over
rally, jolly-up, game and dance, occurred when
one of Stanford's big guards kissed one of Stanford's
little left-half-backs. The occasion was a touchdown;
the place, the end zone of the Stanford Stadium; the
time, the twelfth minute of the second quarter in the
Stanford-U.C.L.A. football game played here Saturday.
That Austins are small cars is evidenced by several
evidences revealed lately about a Stanford Austin
which did tricks. Saturday after the game, the Row
was well crowded with cars and dissuasive to fast
traffic as well as any fonn of traffic. Pedestrians were
scattering for their lives as cars overburdened with
Indians and Bruins careened a few feet each minute
or so. Non-plussed and exasperated by the delay, the
owner of the little red limousine turned up the Phi
Delt driveway, then left onto the sidewalk, and clax
oning its way along made good headway up the row
despite the numerous pedestrians.
