# Film Injects Whimsy Into Triangle Plot
## 
### 
"Wife, Doctor, and Nurse," cur
rent at the Fox-Stanford, is really
much better than by all rights it
should be. Since Theda Bara first
put a third side on the Hollywood
triangle a quarter-century ago, the

cinema has been
doing pieces about
husbands and
wives and the
women that come
between them, all
? the time wearing
the Groove a lit
tle deeper.
"Wife, Doctor,
and Nurse," de
spite its definitely

stereotyped title, somehow misses
the Groove, presents the same old
story with a touch of whimsy and
common-sense which is remarkably
refreshing. ,
Warner Baxter, for instance, ex
hibits a side quite different fi - om
the knife-in-mouthers which have
brought him his fame. As a fash
ionable women's surgeon who, when
his own domestic affairs alienate
both his wife and his nurse, Mr.
Baxter at last creates a role which
suits his natural charm and person
ality.
Though Loretta Young and Vir
ginia Bruce bring forth no new
sides, those they have displayed in
previous films are quite adequate to
carry "Wife, Doctor, and Nurse"
through its foamy difficulties to the
triangle's sensible end.

''Beyond the Horizon": Federal
Theater Project at the Alcazar: "Be
yond the Horizon," O'Neill's first
full-length play, represents his drama
in the awkward age, with dialogue
too small to cover its big, gangling
frame of the warps and woofs of
human life.
Clearly inferior to his other work,
"Beyond the Horizon" has neither

the sultry power
of "Desire Under
the Elms," nor the
robustness of his
earlier sea one
acts; is mainly
characteristic for
morbi d i ty and
long - windedness. 1
Its current pro- |
duction, moreover,
is strictly medi
ocre.
In this story of
a New England
farm, the farmer,

Rob, takes a wife. Only the wife is
the girl his brother had in mind for
the same position. The brother goes
out to sea a heart-broken hay-seed,
becomes a successful, traveled man
of the world. Meanwhile the farm
goes from bad to worse or from
mortgage to the hands of the re
ceiver, under Rob who is a dreamer
and not cut out to be a farmer any
way. During the third act every
body ends up by cursing God, each
other, Fate, and the cold. All of
which winds up with Rob's death
rattle to the accompaniment of
clanging by the O'Farrell Street
street-car.
The whole point of this dreary
fiasco, is, apparently, that the re
alization of man's dreams lie just
beyond the horizon, and that death
is the shoi'test route in that direc
tion.

and not cut out to be a farmer any
way. During the third act every
body ends up by cursing God, each
other, Fate, and the cold. All of
which winds up with Rob's death
rattle to the accompaniment of
clanging by the O'Farrell Street
street-car.
The whole point of this dreary

beyond the horizon, and that death
is the shoi'test route in that direc

"Wife, Doctor, and Nurse," cur
rent at the Fox-Stanford, is really
much better than by all rights it
should be. Since Theda Bara first
put a third side on the Hollywood
triangle a quarter-century ago, the

cinema has been
doing pieces about
husbands and
wives and the
women that come
between them, all
? the time wearing
the Groove a lit
tle deeper.
"Wife, Doctor,
and Nurse," de
spite its definitely

stereotyped title, somehow misses
the Groove, presents the same old
story with a touch of whimsy and
common-sense which is remarkably
refreshing. ,
Warner Baxter, for instance, ex
hibits a side quite different fi - om
the knife-in-mouthers which have
brought him his fame. As a fash
ionable women's surgeon who, when
his own domestic affairs alienate
both his wife and his nurse, Mr.
Baxter at last creates a role which
suits his natural charm and person
ality.
Though Loretta Young and Vir
ginia Bruce bring forth no new
sides, those they have displayed in
previous films are quite adequate to
carry "Wife, Doctor, and Nurse"
through its foamy difficulties to the
triangle's sensible end.

''Beyond the Horizon": Federal
Theater Project at the Alcazar: "Be
yond the Horizon," O'Neill's first
full-length play, represents his drama
in the awkward age, with dialogue
too small to cover its big, gangling
frame of the warps and woofs of
human life.
Clearly inferior to his other work,
"Beyond the Horizon" has neither

the sultry power
of "Desire Under
the Elms," nor the
robustness of his
earlier sea one
acts; is mainly
characteristic for
morbi d i ty and
long - windedness. 1
Its current pro- |
duction, moreover,
is strictly medi
ocre.
In this story of
a New England
farm, the farmer,

Rob, takes a wife. Only the wife is
the girl his brother had in mind for
the same position. The brother goes
out to sea a heart-broken hay-seed,
becomes a successful, traveled man
of the world. Meanwhile the farm
goes from bad to worse or from
mortgage to the hands of the re
ceiver, under Rob who is a dreamer
and not cut out to be a farmer any
way. During the third act every
body ends up by cursing God, each
other, Fate, and the cold. All of
