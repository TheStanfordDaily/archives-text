### 
MEADVILLE, Pa., Oct. 10 (UP).—
Charles Probst of Pittsburgh had to
have his hat removed by a physi
cian. It was a somewhat painful
process because, while fishing in
Conneaut Lake, a fellow angler's
barbed fly penetrated Probst's hat,
imbedding itself in his scalp. After
a brief operation, mostly on the hat,
Probst returned to his fishing.
