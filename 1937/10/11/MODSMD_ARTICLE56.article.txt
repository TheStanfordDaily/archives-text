# CAMPUS OPINION
## RACE PREJUDICE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In last Friday's edition of the
Daily you published an editorial on
the admission of negroes to the.Uni
versity.
Personally, I am violently opposed
to racial prejudice and discrimina
tion of all kinds. I believe that the
Administration should admit any
person who qualifies scholastically
and whose character is such that he
would be a credit to Stanford. But
my opinions and undoubtedly biased
views are of no importance whatso
ever.
From the point of the student
body, the faculty, the alumni, and
the Administration, the editorial
was detrimental to Stanford and
in extremely bad taste.
It brought up a question with
which the University is not imme
diately faced and made the student
body conscious of what is at best a
somewhat embarrassing problem.
The editorial was a trouble-maker.
It resorted, rather self-consciously,
to mentioning the scheduled appear
ance of a colored artiste, Miss Mar
ian Anderson. When she does grace
the campus with her presence and
treats us to her magnificent voice,
will some members of the audience
remember that she has a right to
thumb her nose at them? Will stu
dents resent it? Will they deprecate
Miss Anderson's art on moral
grounds? I sincerely hope not.
Friday's editorial brought up the
negro question on THE DAY BE

visitors that appeared a few inches
above the one in question.
Undoubtedly, the editorial was
written in a spirit of complete in
nocence. Daily editorial writers
sometimes seem to have difficulty in
finding a subject. This one probably
presented itself in a pinch, and its
appearance may merely have been
the result of unfortunate circum
stance.
However, let me suggest that The
Daily watch circumstances of this
type and the printing of any matter
that would reflect badly on Stan

Anderson will never hear of it, may
be the public, the alumni, other
colleges will never get word of it.
Then all that has to be done to rem
