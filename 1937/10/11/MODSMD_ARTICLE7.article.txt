# Nominations To Open For Two Offices
## Candidates Must File Blanks at Law Steps By 6 p.m. Wednesday 
### 
With Tuesday, October 19, set for
the special student body election to
fill gaps in Men's Council and Ex
Committee, nominations will open
tomori'ow for the vacant positions.
The failure of Joe Weiner, gradu
ate member, to take his place on Ex
Committee, and of Ben Dey to re
turn to Men's Council, creates need
for the election, called by Ex Com
mittee in last week's meeting.
Blanks at Law Steps
Nominations are to be open from
8 o'clock tomorrow morning to 6
o'clock Wednesday evening. Nomi
nation blanks will be placed at the
Law Steps; after being signed by at
least 15 students, they will be
dropped in the box at the same
location.
The position vacated by Weiner
was that of graduate member for the
short term. All nominations for this
position must therefore come from
graduate students enrolled this
quarter.
120 Units Necessary
Positions on Men's Council must
be filled by students having 120 units
of university credit. Nominations
to this office must be signed by men
alone.
The election will be handled by
an election board appointed by Ex
Committee, and headed by Dick
Riddell. Appointments to the board
and official naming of Riddell as
election chairman probably will be
made tomorrow night at regular Ex
Committee meeting.
