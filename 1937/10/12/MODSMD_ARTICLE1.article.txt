# F.D.R. Urges Peace: War Scare Grows
## President Lauds Use Of Freedom, Not Force For World's Affairs 
### 
President Roosevelt for the second
time within a week yesterday ex
pressed American determination to
oppose efforts to substitute force for
freedom in international relations,
the United Press reported from
Washington — and meanwhile war
flames mounted in Spain, the Medi
terranean, and China, and a military
plot was uncovered in Yugoslavia.
In a speech commemorating Pu
laski Day, the President praised the
Polish struggle for freedom and their
hero of the American Revolutionary
War, General Casimir Pulaski.
Praises Liberty
Reaffirming the sentiments he ex
pressed last week against "war
making nations," the President said:
''Wo, as a nation, seek spiritual
union with all who love freedom. Of
many bloods and of diverse national
origins, we stand before the world

today as one people united in a
common determination. That deter
mination is to uphold the ideal of
human society which makes con
science superior to brute strength—
the ideal which would substitute
freedom for force in the govern
ments of the world."
Geneva Survey
From Geneva United Press Corre
spondent Wallace Carroll reported
that a majority of the diplomats
from the 52 states in the League of
Nations believe that a general world
war will be avoided.
Admitting the seriousness of the
present situation, the League states
men told Carroll that the three pos
sibilities which might provoke a
world war are further intervention
on the part of Mussolini to aid
Franco's Rebel forces in Spain; a
possible attack by Hitler upon
Czechoslovakia; and, finally, that
Japan might strike at the Soviet
Union, Britain, or the United States.
While the League remained opti
mistic, here is yesterday's "unde
clared" war news:
THE NINE-POWER CONFERENCE
will meet within two weeks in Brus
sels, Belgium, to consider the Far
Eastern crisis, reports in London
said. Brussels was chosen as the
meeting place because Belgium has
no spccial interests in China.
IN CHINA Japanese troops began a
"big push" on Shanghai's North
Station, but the Chinese Central
Government issued an announce
ment claiming "numerous victories."
An army of 3,000 men is being
mobilized in South China to come
to the aid of the Nanking Govern
ment, it was reported by Chinese,
who charged that Japan is using
"dum-dum" bullets.
AS FOR SPAIN. Anglo-French dis
cussions for a "peaceful naval occu
pation" of Loyalist-held Minorca in
the Balearic Islands were reported
from Paris. London officials refused
to comment on rumors of the plan,
which was seen as a "reprisal"
against II Duce's I'efusal to discuss
withdrawal of all "volunteers" from
Spain. The Rebels hold the other
Balearic Islands.
IN YUGOSLAVIA, a military revolt
plot headed by generals and Serbian
nationalists has been uncovered by
the government.
