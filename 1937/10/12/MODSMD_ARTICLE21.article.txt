# S.F. Hospital Strike Off
## Stanford Institution In New Negotiations 
### 
Fears that members of the Hos
pital and Institutional Workers'
Union would picket the Stanford
Hospital, at Webster and Sacramento
Streets in San Francisco, receded
yesterday, accoi-ding to a United
Press dispatch received by The
Daily.
An afternoon conference yester
day staved off the threatened walk
out, and hospital officials reported
ly have renewed negotiations with
the union. Approval of the Uni
versity Board of Trustees was said
to be required for dealing with the
union's wages, hours, and prefer
ential employment demands.
M. J. Brown, union business
agent, said that "hospital engineers,
are entering the discussions with
Stanford Hospital officials, and we
hope a settlement may be reached
without a walkout."
STRIKE CLOSES SEVEN
PALO ALTO GARAGES
Picket lines were established yes
terday morning in front of seven of
Palo Alto's 24 garages by the Ga
rage Employees' Union Local No.
556, subsidiary of the A. F. of L. In
ternational Brotherhood of Team
sters.
Mechanics refused to pass union
members on the picket lines, so shop
work in the seven affected garages
was completely stopped. No local
service stations have been affected
by the walkout.
The strike was called after ne
gotiations for wage and hour pro
posals ended in a deadlock. Garage
owners suggested that the picketing
be postponed for a two-week
"truce," but a union committee re
jected the proposal.
