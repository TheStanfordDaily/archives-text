Itiddell in Charge
The election will be conducted by
an election board to be appointed by
Ex Committee. The appointment of
| Dick Riddell as election chairman
i will probably be confined by Ex
! Committee in this evening's meet
ing.
The two vacancies were caused by
the failure of Joe Weiner to take
| his place on Ex Committee and of
| Ben Dey to return to Men's Council.
The election was called by Ex Com
j mittee in last week's meeting for
| next week, allowing one week after
i nominations for publicity in accord
! ance with constitutional by-laws.
The second Ex Committee post
! was declared vacant late last night,
after Election Chairman Dick Riddell
j rechecked, found that Fred Williams
â€¢ ihad gone to wefrk yesterday in
Salinas.
The position was thought to be
open at the beginning of the quar
ter, Riddell explained, then Williams
| reappeared on the campus. Positive
I information that he would not reg
| ister was received last night.
