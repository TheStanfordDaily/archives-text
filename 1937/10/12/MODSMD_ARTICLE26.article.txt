# Court Balks Two Attempts To Oust Black
## Hughes Given Decision Landing Court Fracas Under Present Cases 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (UP). —
The Supreme Court today dismissed
two challenges to the right of Asso
ciate Justice Hugo L. Black to sit
upon the high bench.
The action, announced as the tri
bunal sat for its first business ses
sion of the year, put an end for the
present to any court action to bar
Black from his place upon the bench.
New Action Possible
Although it was possible that at
some later date a new challenge to
Justice Black might be advanced,
the court's action today appeared to
close the immediately legal phase
of the controversy which has raged
about him — a controversy which
started with revelation in newspaper
dispatches that the former Alabama
senator once was a member of the
Ku Klux Klan.
Cases Impersonal
Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes, with Justice Black on the
bench, announced the decisions.
He first rejected the motion pre
sented by Albert Levitt, resigned
Justice Department employe. Levitt,
he declared, had failed to establish
—as required by law —a personal in
terest in the case. Then, without
further explanation, the chief jus
tice announced that the motion of
Patrick Henry Kelly, Boston attor
ney, seeking a hearing on Black's
eligibility had been denied on the
same grounds.
