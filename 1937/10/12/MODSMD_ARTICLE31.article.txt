# Farm Woman Sees War Over Shanghai
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
Thyt Luigi Schmid, Stanford sen- I
ior, was born under a lucky star is I
not to be doubted, judging from
her uncanny ability to leave places
just before accidents are about to
happen.
Last year she crossed the Atlantic
on the Hindenberg—on May 6 the
Hindenberg crashed at Lakehurst,
New Jersey.
So she sperjt this summer at her
home in Shanghai, was on top of
the Cathay hotel during the bomb
ing of the Japanese consulate, missed
a mass slaughter in the street by
one hour, escaped a stampede of
Chinese refugees, and was
drowned during the American evac
uation.
Bombs Dropped in River
On August 14 while the Japanese
boat Idzuma was docked at the Jap
anese consulate in Shanghai, Luigi
happened to be on the roof of the
Cathay hotel taking pictures. Up
to this point nothing had been se
rious. Residents of Shanghai ex
pected the war to be as mild in the
city as it had been in 1932.
In the distance, according to Luigi,
one could see the fire from the war,
when suddenly three Chinese planes
appeared. As soon as they ap
proached, the Idzuma started firing
her anti-aircraft guns.
"The racket was terrific as the
three bombs landed in the river,"
she said, "and everyone on the roof
rushed for cover. The Chinese in
the streets went crazy as they were
sure that the whole Japanese army
was landing on the dock."
Crowd Stampedes
Later in the afternoon with one
of her friends she went downtown
to take pictures of the refugees who
had no place to stay and were just
wandering the streets. Both were
miraculously saved from being
crushed to death by a policeman who
pushed them up against a wall
when the crowd of Chinese stam
peded.
"When we i-eturned home, we
found out that the place we had
been in just a little while before
had all been blown up and hun
dreds had been killed," she said.
But the worst experience of all,
according to Luigi, was the way she
was treated during the American
evacuation of the city. On August
17, a truce was arranged between
8 and 11. While the opposing forces
were drawn up on either side of
the river, 400 American women and
children were loaded on a small tug
to be taken out to the Dollar liner
President Jefferson.

"Outside of a Chinese bombing
plane which arrived and at which
the Japanese shot a few shells, the
voyage down the river was com
paratively quiet," she continued.
"But where the Whangpoo and
Yangtze rivers converge, a terrific
wind came up."
The captain of the tug wanted to
go back but one of the men on
board who headed the American
evacuation committee insisted that
it was more dangerous to go back to
Shanghai.
"We all thought it was the end
this time for sure," she went on.

"Later we learned that the people
on the Jefferson could see the bot
tom of the tug every time it rolled.
Worst of all were the screams of
the children."

"After reaching the Jefferson we
went down to Manila where our
greeting was splendid. The young
married women working for the
Red Cross had organized to help us
and we were presented with slips
before we landed inviting us to stay
with certain people indefinitely.
They even provided jobs for many
of the people and the radio ama
teurs were especially helpful in
sending messages to friends and
relatives."
She returned to the States last
week on the President Coolidge.
When asked about the outcome
of the war, Luigi replied: "No one
can tell how long it will last. China
has man power but Japan has the
patriotism and the unity and may
win."

Later in the afternoon with one
of her friends she went downtown
to take pictures of the refugees who
had no place to stay and were just
wandering the streets. Both were
miraculously saved from being
crushed to death by a policeman who
pushed them up against a wall
when the crowd of Chinese stam
peded.
"When we i-eturned home, we
found out that the place we had
been in just a little while before
had all been blown up and hun
dreds had been killed," she said.
But the worst experience of all,
according to Luigi, was the way she
was treated during the American
evacuation of the city. On August
17, a truce was arranged between
8 and 11. While the opposing forces
were drawn up on either side of
the river, 400 American women and
children were loaded on a small tug
to be taken out to the Dollar liner
President Jefferson.

"Outside of a Chinese bombing
plane which arrived and at which
the Japanese shot a few shells, the
voyage down the river was com
paratively quiet," she continued.
"But where the Whangpoo and
Yangtze rivers converge, a terrific
wind came up."
The captain of the tug wanted to
go back but one of the men on
board who headed the American
evacuation committee insisted that
it was more dangerous to go back to
Shanghai.
"We all thought it was the end
this time for sure," she went on.

"Later we learned that the people
on the Jefferson could see the bot
tom of the tug every time it rolled.
Worst of all were the screams of
the children."

"After reaching the Jefferson we
went down to Manila where our

They even provided jobs for many
of the people and the radio ama
teurs were especially helpful in
sending messages to friends and
relatives."
She returned to the States last
week on the President Coolidge.
When asked about the outcome
of the war, Luigi replied: "No one
can tell how long it will last. China
has man power but Japan has the
patriotism and the unity and may
win."

On August 14 while the Japanese
boat Idzuma was docked at the Jap

Cathay hotel taking pictures. Up
to this point nothing had been se
rious. Residents of Shanghai ex
pected the war to be as mild in the
city as it had been in 1932.
In the distance, according to Luigi,
one could see the fire from the war,
when suddenly three Chinese planes
appeared. As soon as they ap
proached, the Idzuma started firing
her anti-aircraft guns.
