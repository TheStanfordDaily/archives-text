# Today Is Deadline For Study Change
## 
### 
Today is the last day students may
change their study lists for this
quarter, without fine. After Tues
day all program revisions must be
made by petition to the Registration
Committee, subject to the following
fines: *$2 for each course added or
dropped, or $3 where one course is
substituted for another.
All program changes made since
registration should be filed at the
Registrar's office on the regular re
vised study-list cards. Students are
held responsible for courses and
units as they appear on their official
study lists filed at the time of regis
tration and no credit is given for
courses which do not appear there
on. This applies to Physical Educa
tion as well as academic subjects.
