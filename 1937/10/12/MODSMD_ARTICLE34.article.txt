# Trial by Jury On Double Bill October 29,30
## Administration Sponsors First Musical Show Since Junior Operas 
### 
First musical production sponsored
by the University in many years will
be "Trial by Jury," to be presented
in Memorial Hall Friday afternoon,
October 29, and Saturday night, Oc
tober 30, on a double bill with "Mur
der in the Cathedral."
It was selected by Director Gor
don C. Lange and Warren D. Allen,
head of the Pepartment of Music, as
an experiment in co-ordinating mu
sic and drama in the new theater.
The production will give men and
women with singing talent an op
portunity to develop their voices
and to gain stage experience.
The last musical shows presented
under the auspices of the adminis
tration were the Junior Operas,
which were discontinued a number
; of years ago because of a scarcity of
talent.
Satire on Courts
"Trial by Jury" was the first prod
uct of the great comic opera combi
nation of Gilbert and Sullivan. The
| plot and the music provide lots of
| fun for both the audience and the
j actors, according to Professor Allen.
The story is a satire on the dig
nity and integrity of British courts
and trials. The music is a take-off
on the romantic Italian style of
opera.
Gilbert and Sullivan attempted to
kid the composers of serious dra
matic music when they wrote "Trial
by Jury." They even included a
sextette in the score which takes off
the famed Sextette from "Lucia." In
it each of the six singers tries to
outdo the rest.
