# Hilgard Blasts Superstitions
## Professor Is Critical Of Five Popular Reliefs 
### 
'Tain't necessarily so.
This was the verdict of Fr. Ernest
Hilgard, associate professor of psy
chology, given during his radio talk
last night over KGO, regarding five
maxims about human nature that
are generally accepted as truths.
Dr. Hilgard pointed out that, con
trary to popular beliefs, psycholog
ical findings show that beautiful
girls are not dumb; that those who
learn quickly remember as long as
those who learn slowly; that very
bright children are as healthy as
those of lesser intellect; that the
mouth is just as expressive of emo
tion as the eyes; and that opposites
are not necessarily attracted to each
other.

The authority attacked the popu
lar conceptions in a general objec
tion against the practice of relying
on so-called common sense observa
tions to judge human nature.
"That many errors persist in com
mon beliefs," he remarked, "is evi
dent enough from the prevalence of
superstitions, even in this suppos
edly scientific age," and he cited in
proof the case of a modern hospital
that had no numbers ending in 1!5,
i lest such a room be unlucky to the
patient.
