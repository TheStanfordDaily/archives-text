There are two near-perfect set
ups for a pair of brand new college
athletic conferences here on the
coast.
The first and most important
one I have in mind could be called
the Pacific Coast Independent
League or any other suitable mon
icker. It would be a six-team
conference or could be stretched
into a regular eight-team affair.
When the now historical Pacific
Coast Conference "freeze-out" plan
was enacted two years ago the in
dependent colleges suffered. A lot
ol swell football games were taken
off their schedule.
Three crackerjack bay region
1 earns would be in this new Pacific
Coast league, namely St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, and San Francisco Uni
versity. A strong representative of
Southern California would be Loy
ola, and the strongest representative
from the northern section of the
coast would be the Bulldogs from
Gonzaga.
STAGG'S PACIFIC IN
THERE, TOO
Those five teams would form the
nucleus of a league that could really
grow into something pretty big in
the nation's sports set-up. A sixth
representative to round out a six
team conference could be Amos
Alonzo Stagg's College of the Pa
cific.
If the sports moguls wanted to
make the league an eight-team af
fair they could add Willamette
and the University of Portland.
The league need not just be for
football, but could be run similarly
to the Pacific Coast Conference and
include various sports.
The second conference I have in
mind would be a state athletic
league. We could call it the Cali
fornia College Conference. The only
trouble there being that the inevi
table reducing of the name to ini
tials might confuse it in the news
paper headlines with one of Presi
dent Roosevelt's brainstorms.
CONFERENCE OF
STATE COLLEGES
This conference would be a league
composed entirely of state colleges
in California. Oh, yes, you could dig
up a very formidable six team ar
ray, or even an eight team league
just from the little nephews of the
great Berkeley institution.
Heading the list would probably
be the always powerful San Jose
State. The bay region team would
be San Francisco State. From down
south would come San Diego State
and Santa Barbara State, and mov
ing up the coast a little from there
we could tag Fresno State. The
sixth team could be Chico State.
There's your six-team confer
ence. But an eight-team league
could be formed by adding a couple
of other state colleges, Cal Tech from
down south and Cal Aggies in
Northern California.
I don't know, it's just an idea but
it sounds pretty good to me.
800-ERKELEY HAS
RIGHT IDEA
No longer will that last minute
of play seem like an hour in
California Memorial Stadium. It
can't because the evidence will be
right in full view of ail the specta
tors.
The University of California has
rebuilt the stadium clocks so that
both seconds and minutes are indi
cated. The clocks at either end of
the stadium are connected elec
trically with the timer's timepiece.
When the ball is put in play a
red second hand starts. When the
ball is declared dead the arm stops.
Ken Priestly, U. C. graduate man
ager, claims no other team in the
conference has this arrangement.
Attention, Stanford B.A.C. It's
quite an idea. Maybe the con
traptions will eventually grace the
top extremities of the Farm foot
ball park.
