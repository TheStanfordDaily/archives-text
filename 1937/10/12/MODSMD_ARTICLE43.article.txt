# Champion Water Polo Squad Will Play Here
## Los Angeles Club To Meet Cards Friday Thornton also Schedules S.F. Olympians For Contest on Saturday 
### ARCH JENKINS 
The greatest squad of water polo
players ever assembled under one
banner will perform at Stanford
Friday afternoon in Encina pools,
when the Los Angeles Athletic Club
squad meets the Cardinal varsity.
The classic of the day will begin
immediately after a Stanford jayvee-
Compton Junior College game, which
starts at 3:30. Admission will be
free to all students with student
body cards.
Undefeated at the hands of an
American opponent for nine years,
the Los Angeles squad promises to
considerably liven up what would
otherwise be a comparatively mild
sports week-end.
National Champions
Not content with staging this con
test, Coach Nort Thornton of the
Cards simultaneously announced
that the Olympic Club varsity and
reserves would meet the two Stan
ford teams here at 2 o'clock Satur
day.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club is
the present National A.A.U. cham
pion and represented the United
States in both the 1932 and 1936
Olympics. With defeats only by
Hungary in the finals of the 1932
Olympiad and by Holland in the
1936 Games, the club finds little op
position to its "greatest squad" tag.
Six of the seven men on the first
team —they're dubbed the Mercuries
— were selected on the last A.A.U.
AU-American aquatic team.
Veterans on Team
Led by Phil Daubenspeck and
Wally O'Connor, forwards, the Mer
curies have an amazing lot of men
who are supposed to have been too
old for active sports years ago.
Daubenspeck is a veteran of the 1932
and 1936 Olympics. He has for eight
years paced the American scoring
field. O'Connor, a Stanford man of
the Class of '26, has played in the
1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936 Olympics.
Kenny Beck, forward, is a new
comer with the recent Olympics to
his credit. Charlie Finn has been in
two of them and Dixon Fiske, former
U.C.L.A. ace, has competed in the
last; Herb Williams, goalie, com
peted in the '32 and '36 games.
Stanford has been unusually bril
liant against the Mercury team. In
1933 the Cardinals lost, 7-4 and 5-4,
the latter an overtime game. The
two teams played three more in
1934 with the club winning 5-2, 8-4,
and 7-5.
Stanford is the only squad ever to
tie the Mercuries in regular playing
time. It took four extra periods for
them to trounce the Red in that
5-4 struggle in 1933.
Winkleman To Perform
As if the water week-end weren't
already well lined up, Thornton also
assures fans that Roy Winkleman,
the Farm's crack diver and poten
tial Olympic material himself, will
perform between the preliminary and
main games on both days.
The Olympic Club games Satur
day should be more the Red ad
vantage since the OJympians have
n't won from Stanford in six years.
Thornton has compiled 13 wins with
out a defeat since his rise to head of
Stanford's water sports.
