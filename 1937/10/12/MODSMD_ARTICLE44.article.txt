And Tiny shuffled the deck again.
Not yet satisfied with his backfield
arrangement, Coach Thornhill yes
terday decided to try Ed Gamier,
former first string halfback who has
been out for several weeks with an
injured ankle, in the quarterback
spot.
Bill Paulman, who dislocated his
collar-bone in the first quarter of
the Oregon game and has not donned
pads since then, is slowly recov
ering. According to team physicians,
he will definitely play a week from
Saturday against Washington at Se
attle.
Ledeboer, Kirsch Star
Tiny is still trying out new right
halfbacks, despite the remarkable
performances Fred Ledeboer and
Bill Kirsch turned in Saturday in
the U.C.L.A. tilt.
Yesterday Rod Parker, who played
quarterback on last year's freshman
aggregation, was shifted to right
half. The position was held regu
larly by Gamier before his injury.
Ncrl Rasmussen, who sprained his
ankle in the Bruin tilt Saturday, is
the only remaining gridder in the
hospital. He will probably be out
today and will take part in practice
later in the week.

them to take things easy after Sat

With no game this week-end to
require long tedious dummy prac
tice, Indian gridders will have a
full week of scrimmages, starting
this afternoon at 3:30 on the prac
tice field.
