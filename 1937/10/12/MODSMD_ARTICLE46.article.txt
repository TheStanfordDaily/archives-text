# ORCHESIS TRYOUTS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Orchesis, women's honorary dance
society, is holding tryouts tonight at
7:30 o'clock in the dance studio at
the women's gym. All girls who have
had one quarter of dancing may try
out. No original composition is re
quired.

The smallest parcel of real estate
in the world is a two-foot-long tri
angle on a New York sidewalk.
