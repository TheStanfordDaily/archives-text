# Ogden L. Mills Passes in East
## Wilbur Praises Former Associate in Cabinet 
### 
Ogden L. Mills, statesman, philan
thropist, and prominent leader in the
Republican party, died shortly after
noon yesterday at his home in New
York, according to a United Press
report.
Secretary of the Treasury for a
year under the Hoover Administra
tion, Mills was mentioned frequently
in G.O.P. circles as presidential ma
terial.
Wilbur Comments
To President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
who was Secretary of the Interior
when Mills served in the cabinet,
the death of Mills came as a shock.
"Ogden Mills could have been just
another rich man," Wilbur said,
"but instead he became a great na
tional character through devoted
and continuous service to the pub
lic in the field of legislation and na
tional administration. He was one
of our most thoughtful and unself
ish citizens. We will greatly miss
his clear, impassive mind with his
understanding of great national
financial problems."
Death Sudden
Mills' death was sudden. He had
been at his New York office all last
week and apparently was in the best
of health.
Member of the third generation
of a family that became financially
important in California in 1849 and
after, Mills resided until a few years
ago at his estate at Millbrae. He
was born in 1884 at Newport, R.1.,
and was educated at Harvard.
F.R. Critic
He held directorships in several
large corporations, including the
Chase National Bank and the South
ern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads,
and held interests in numerous bus
iness enterprises.
A passionate critic of President
Roosevelt and the New Peal, in re
cent months Mills had advocated the
rehabilitation and reorganization of
the Republican party.
