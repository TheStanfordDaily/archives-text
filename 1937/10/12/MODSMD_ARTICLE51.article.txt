## Tuesday View of the Saturday Game 
### 
NOW that the shouting and tumult is gone
and the cool light of sober second thought
plays upon the U.C.L.A. week-end, we are
writing the piece that ordinarily would appear
on Monday.
We were anxious to discover if the hang
over of game enthusiasm would tarnish under
midweek scrutiny, but it didn't and Saturday
night's jubilance, sans women and song, is
Tuesday's edit.
Impressions that battled their way through
the emotional mob-scene of week-end enthu
siasm:
That Stanford surprised even itself with a
display of football play that Bruin Coach Bill
Spaulding somewhat too - enthusiastically de
clared was going to develop into the best team
in the country. Stanford is sure now that it won't
be the worst.

That the Stanford rooting section also sur
prised itself, and Bullsessioner Cobbs, with a
display of spirit which Ed R. Hughes, who was
writing Stanford games when the axe was new,
reported as unusual.
That that same rooting section surprised
everyone with a display of restraint which indi
cated that a penalty against the red is no longer
considered cause for complete abandonment
of tact.
That the Stanford band played fairly well for
early season, which is cause for rejoicing in
any man's edit.
And that the genial followers of the defeated
Bruin turned back to Westwood loaded with all
the hospitality, southern or otherwise, that Stan
ford could muster with the exception, perhaps,
of the mint juleps and the game.
Or maybe it was just the game.
