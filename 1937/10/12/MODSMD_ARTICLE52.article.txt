PRESIDENTS Wilbur and Killefer probably
wouldn't call it that, but Stanford University
and Ex Committee are in the theater business.
They have a theater on their hands, wired
for sound, and with it the problem of any ex
hibitor —to get the maximum utility from the
property.
On Ex Committee's docket tonight should be
three proposals to fill the uneconomically empty
seats of the theater.
Number one is a weekly news reel show, a
tried and proved success over a period of five
years at the University of Minnesota. A com
mittee appointed last year investigated the
possibility of having full length, first run pic
tures. Block booking, which means contracting
for the entire output of a studio, good and bad,
for a certain period, stymied that. It doesn't
stymie the Minnesota idea because news reels
vary little in quality from week to week. Even
without a Mickey Mouse or a Popeye for a draw
ing card, Minnesota is able to give the show for
five cents per person.
Revival of pictures no longer in circulation,
the second proposal, also gets around the block
booking bugaboo. "The Informer" and "It Hap
pened One Night" are samples of successes that
might be brought back, and the critics' favorite,
"Winterset," soon will be in the same class.
Number three is to bring legitimate road
shows that play San Francisco down to the
campus for one-night stands. Such shows would
play here for a percentage of the take, without
a guarantee.

Ex Committee tonight can appoint its usual
semi-efficient sub-committee to investigate the
proposals, that will make its usual semi-effi
cient report every two weeks, or it can appoint
the exceptional committee that will prove the
rule with an immediate, complete investigation.

That human life must be a kind of mistake is
clear from the fact that man is a compound of
needs, which are difficult to satisfy; and if they
are satisfied, all that he attains is a state of
painlessness, in which he can only give himself
up to boredom. —Schopenhauer
The most disagreeable two-legged animal I
know is a little great man; and the next, a little
great man's factotum and friend.—C. C. Colton
