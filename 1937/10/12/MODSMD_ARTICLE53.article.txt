CELL'S BELLS
1 )EAR Jose Rodriguez:
Last Sunday you wrote a letter to the editor
that sounded enough like Edgar Wallace to be plagiar
ism. In fact, it was so much like a quotation from a
pulp novel that I wouldn't be surprised to find that
you are really a couple of good economic royalists
who were hard up for amusement Sunday. But your
letter conforms perfectly to the popular idea of good
Communist etiquette and I think I'll give you a little
fatherly advice, trusting that the Palo Alto cell will
neglect the Daily Worker long enough to read it.
Your letter ran something like this: "With your
Executive Committee's flippant dismissal of the Fascist
insurrection in Spain we are disgusted. Such actions
can result for yourselves only in trouble.
"Our movement is gaining strength. The Palo Alto
cell is rapidly becoming strong enough to cope ade
quately with persons who persist to reducing efforts
of the Spanish Loyalists ..."
* * * *
If the Palo Alto cell really wants to boom com
munism and doesn't consider showing off more im
portant, I believe they could use a few pointers on
applied revolution. First, I suggest that you do a little
collateral reading in Dale Carnegie. There you will
find several ways of "influencing people," all of them
decidedly better than dramatic disgust and obscure
threats.
Again, I think you ought to put that sensitive skin
of yours under wraps. No communist, of course, can
amount to much unless he gets high blood pressure
whenever somebody mentions the Cause without tak
ing off his hat; but your sensitiveness to flippancy is
almost an allergy. Nobody wants to be flippant about
a war that is killing thousands of people, including
civilians and children. The threat of another world
war is not exactly the best gag of the year.
* *« * *
you are a little irritated and disap
pointed because Stanford didn't dig in its col
lective pocket and hand over a nice contribution that
would be used to kill people. But if you know Amer
ican history you will remember that we had a very
fine civil war of our own once—and we don't care to
take part in another.
One more bit of advice—Americans don't like the
idea of "coping" or "dealing" with those who don't
agree with the majority. Ask the Poly Sci department,
and they will tell you that our political code insists on
fair play for all minorities. We don't consider it ex
actly sporting to "deal with" those that oppose us, if
we get the upper hand. We don't like to back any
party that plans to kick its opponents when it gets
them down.
* * ♦ *
And so, Jose Rodriguez, if you'll pardon me for
telling you so, the communist cell pulled a grade A
butch when it let you write those letters. America is
distinctly favorable to the Loyalist cause; it prefers to
uphold a government with some legal basis, and it has
never considered Fascist sword-rattling particularly
sweet music.
But we don't enjoy threats of "coping" with people;
and we reserve the right to ridicule whatever we w.VI
to. I suggest that you hang on to your disgust while
the Palo Alto cell waxes and grows strong. As a letter
writer, you are distinctly inferior to Chesterfield.
Yours,
John Cobbs

CELL'S BELLS
1 )EAR Jose Rodriguez:
Last Sunday you wrote a letter to the editor
that sounded enough like Edgar Wallace to be plagiar
ism. In fact, it was so much like a quotation from a
pulp novel that I wouldn't be surprised to find that
you are really a couple of good economic royalists
who were hard up for amusement Sunday. But your
letter conforms perfectly to the popular idea of good
Communist etiquette and I think I'll give you a little
fatherly advice, trusting that the Palo Alto cell will
neglect the Daily Worker long enough to read it.
Your letter ran something like this: "With your
Executive Committee's flippant dismissal of the Fascist
insurrection in Spain we are disgusted. Such actions
can result for yourselves only in trouble.
"Our movement is gaining strength. The Palo Alto
cell is rapidly becoming strong enough to cope ade
quately with persons who persist to reducing efforts
of the Spanish Loyalists ..."
* * * *
If the Palo Alto cell really wants to boom com
munism and doesn't consider showing off more im
portant, I believe they could use a few pointers on
applied revolution. First, I suggest that you do a little
collateral reading in Dale Carnegie. There you will
find several ways of "influencing people," all of them
decidedly better than dramatic disgust and obscure
threats.
Again, I think you ought to put that sensitive skin
of yours under wraps. No communist, of course, can
amount to much unless he gets high blood pressure
whenever somebody mentions the Cause without tak
ing off his hat; but your sensitiveness to flippancy is
almost an allergy. Nobody wants to be flippant about
a war that is killing thousands of people, including
civilians and children. The threat of another world
war is not exactly the best gag of the year.
* *« * *
you are a little irritated and disap
pointed because Stanford didn't dig in its col
lective pocket and hand over a nice contribution that
would be used to kill people. But if you know Amer
ican history you will remember that we had a very
fine civil war of our own once—and we don't care to
take part in another.
One more bit of advice—Americans don't like the
idea of "coping" or "dealing" with those who don't
agree with the majority. Ask the Poly Sci department,
and they will tell you that our political code insists on
fair play for all minorities. We don't consider it ex
actly sporting to "deal with" those that oppose us, if
we get the upper hand. We don't like to back any
party that plans to kick its opponents when it gets
them down.
* * ♦ *
And so, Jose Rodriguez, if you'll pardon me for
telling you so, the communist cell pulled a grade A
butch when it let you write those letters. America is
distinctly favorable to the Loyalist cause; it prefers to
uphold a government with some legal basis, and it has
never considered Fascist sword-rattling particularly
sweet music.
But we don't enjoy threats of "coping" with people;
and we reserve the right to ridicule whatever we w.VI
