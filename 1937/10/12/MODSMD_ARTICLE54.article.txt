| UNCHING at Sequoia this noon was more than In
formative in recalling the old days, together with
the now movie-acting Doodles Weaver. It seems
Doodles had a logic course while at Stanford. And
during the course he prepared a long syllogism: he
reasoned that genius was 95 per cent perspiration; that
perspiration contains a certain percentage of water;
that watermelon is the same percentage water. There
fore Genius is Watermelon, and vice-versa.
The logic course has been in the limelight recently
by virtue of certain booings that go on during class
times. A certain grad student with sideburns was
booed the other day when he came to class late, with
his sideburns, through the professor's door. The pro
fessor entered by means of his private little door, and
few boos, which died out rapidly.
But this is not all: on the next day of class the pro
fessor entered by means of his priavte little door, and
received an ovation of boos, much as in the case of
the grad student. When they quieted, the prof, who
is from the outside world but recently started his
lecture:
"I presume this is a Stanford custom?"
HASHER reports from the seclusion of his
• graduate work that there is a genuine Capital-
Labor strife here, and that it extends as far as the
Stanford Annex in the Mark Hopkins Lobby.
It appears that the Nation and the New Republic
are kept on file in the Stanford Libe periodical sec
tion (long may it stay open), while the Fortune (1937)
and New Masses can be found only in the Business
School, and in the Business School's Division of Indus
trial Relations.
i The Nation is also sold at the Mark Hopkins maga
zine stand where it is firmly regarded as capifalistic
literature, and read by all.
In view of policemen and parking laws, it might be
a good idea to investigate the somewhat worn parking
ticket which is now lying under the returned book
toboggan in the Main Libe. Perhaps the Library will
'pay the fine.

fore Genius is Watermelon, and vice-versa.
The logic course has been in the limelight recently
by virtue of certain booings that go on during class
times. A certain grad student with sideburns was
booed the other day when he came to class late, with
his sideburns, through the professor's door. The pro
fessor entered by means of his private little door, and
few boos, which died out rapidly.
But this is not all: on the next day of class the pro
fessor entered by means of his priavte little door, and
received an ovation of boos, much as in the case of
the grad student. When they quieted, the prof, who
is from the outside world but recently started his
lecture:
"I presume this is a Stanford custom?"
HASHER reports from the seclusion of his
• graduate work that there is a genuine Capital-
Labor strife here, and that it extends as far as the
Stanford Annex in the Mark Hopkins Lobby.
It appears that the Nation and the New Republic
are kept on file in the Stanford Libe periodical sec
tion (long may it stay open), while the Fortune (1937)
and New Masses can be found only in the Business
School, and in the Business School's Division of Indus
trial Relations.
i The Nation is also sold at the Mark Hopkins maga
zine stand where it is firmly regarded as capifalistic
literature, and read by all.
In view of policemen and parking laws, it might be
a good idea to investigate the somewhat worn parking
ticket which is now lying under the returned book
toboggan in the Main Libe. Perhaps the Library will
'pay the fine.
