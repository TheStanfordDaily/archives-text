# Storm's Last Novel Proves Disappointing
## 
### 
Hans Otto Storm's "Pity the Ty
rant" (Longmans), is nowhere near
as good as it should have been, and
is consequently much worse than it
should be. Even the added glamor
which always attaches to anything
with a South American locale fails
to raise it into a first-ranking novel.
Storm's hero, an American engi
neer, goes south to Peru to super
vise the construction of some tele-

phone lines into
the interior. In
Lima he makes
his headquarters
at the boarding
house run by Se
norita R os i t a
Brett.
The people he
meets there — the
stringy American
lady who is an
archaeologist, the
girl Francesca, the

manufacturer of bottles (nicknamed
"PufTguts")—form a background for
his experiences.
Tyrant Unimportant
He falls in love with Francesca,
and then falls out again. He meets
j a lady Communist, Catalina Garay,
' and bandies shallow sophistries
about the class struggle over the
back fence with her. He is sym-
I pathetic toward the people in their
| struggle against their tyrants, but
his sympathy never assumes any
! very practical form, and he is soon
j sailing back to New York, sadder
and presumably wiser.
Despite the publisher's blurb, the
presence of the Tyrant, languishing
i in jail somewhere in the city while
! his opponents proceed to set up a
j dictatorship twice as ruthless as his
1 own, does not dominate the story to
! any very great extent. When he dies,
| it's too bad, but scarcely vital to any
| of the main characters of the book.
