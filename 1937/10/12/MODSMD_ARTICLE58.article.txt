## SCORN ON THE COBBS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If Mr. Cobbs is allowed a vaca
tion or is stymied for an idea let
me suggest that Bull Session be
written by availing yourself of the
following Cobbs form:
"To those of us who have long
wearied of de da de da de da de da
de da de da it comes with relief
that we hear of de da de da de da.
"De da de da de da de da bleated
de da, etc."
Fill in the de da's and let Mr.
Cobbs rest, poor guy, before you
burn out one of the best men on
your staff. Cobbs is good, but there

that space every day.
That Gilbert & Sullivan blurb of
last week exemplifies my point.
While Gilbert & Sullivan is very de
lightful and pleasing it is no justi
fication for condemning many note
worthy serious dramas unless it's to
pad out a column to proper length.
Run that cut on Mexico again if
nothing else turns up, but please
don't turn Cobbs into a space filler.
Somebody other than Cope
