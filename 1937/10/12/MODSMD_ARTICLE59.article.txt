# POEM FOR COPE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Here lies beleaguered anonymous
Cope,

Considered by some an ignominious
dope,
Whose notorious epistle, expounding
his views,
Caused such a furor it became cam
pus news.
But the Campus Opinion were
worthy of more
Than the rancid remarks of this
garrulous bore.
On his theme we pray the last word
has been said,
And henceforth be pleased to con
sider Cope dead.
Victor Ray Lewis
