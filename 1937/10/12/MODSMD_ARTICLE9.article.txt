# Lecture Series Plan Advanced
## Ex Committee To Hear Plea for Speakers 
### 
Possibility of a Stanford Lecturc
Series, on the order of Concert Se
ries, will come up for discussion to
night at the meeting of Ex Commit
tee.
Beth Allen, who plans to introduce
the subject, hopes the Farm could
get such celebrated speakers as
Stuart Chase, Thomas Mann, and
Carl Sandburg to appear. Principle
drawback to date: $1600-per-year.
Ratification of the new dramatic
society's constitution, scheduled for
tonight's meeting, will not come up
for discussion. Postponement is due
to several changes that were made
last week. President Wilbur has had
no chance to approve the constitu
tion in its revised form.
A contest to determine the so
ciety's name was felt necessary be
cause members could not decide on a
name worthy of permanency. The
contest ends Friday, and final rec
ognition of the organization by Ex
Committee is scheduled for next
Tuesday night.
When the Fedei'al Government
sliced the national NYA budget by
one-third for this school year, the
National Student Federation of
America began its drive to oppose
the cut. Tonight Ex Committee will
look over Stanford's reduced budget,
decide whether it will join the
N.S.F.A.'s drive.
