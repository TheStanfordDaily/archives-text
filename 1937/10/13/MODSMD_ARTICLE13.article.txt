# John Feel Presents Concert
## Selections Show Variety 
### 
A pleasant-looking young man
strode out on the stage of Memorial
Hall promptly at 7:30 last night,
bowed with a flourish, and grinned
at his audience of some 700 persons.
He was John Teel, baritone soloist
for the second of the Public Exer
cises Committee's Tuesday Evening
Series. His program ran the gamut
of concert numbers, from a group of
17 th and 18th century classics
through folk songs of several nations
to the semi-popular music of Noel
Coward.
Songs Contrast
Opening with the classicism of
Handel's "Where'er You Walk,"
Teel continued with a short air
from Milton's "Comus" and "Bois
Epais" by Lully, closed his first
group with "The Pretty Creature"
(Storace), a nonsensical but charm
ing little tune.
But not until he reached his last
group did Teel seem to forget he
was a soloist on quite a large stage
and really enjoy himself. His inter
pretation then of the robust Scotch
song, "The Pipes of Gordon's Men"
(Hammond), topped the rest of the
program, gave full vent to dramatic
use of contrast, both in tone and
volume.
Proof that Teel is an actor as well
as a vocalist came when he sang

"The Ringers" (Lohr) with a cock
ney accent, facial expressions, and a
few gestures thrown in for good
measure.
Acts and Sings Well
His folk selections ranged from
the whimsical English tune, "Oh,
No, John," to an exuberant Portu
guese air, "Pescador," climaxed by
"Home on the Range," "our own
folk song," as he described it.
Gladys Steele was a capable ac
companist for the soloist.
