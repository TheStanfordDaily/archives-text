# STUDENT BALLOT FLAYS LIBE
## Vote Upholds Sunday Study Plan 
### ART STOKES 
Eight out of nine Stanford stu
dents would prefer to have the li
brary open on Sunday night rather
than Friday, a Daily poll yesterday
indicated.
Undergraduates are most strongly
in favor of Sunday night openings,
but both graduates and the few fac
ulty members who voted would pre
fer Sunday, indicating the library
hours are not "set for the conveni
ence of graduate students and fac
ulty members" as Director Nathan
Van Patten indicated this week.
Graduates Sclcct Sunday
A total of 456 ballots were count
ed. Of this number, 404 favored
Sunday night and 52 favored Friday
night.
Of 55 graduates voting, 45 selected
Sunday as the best night for the
library to be open and 10 wanted
Friday.
Friday Not Preferred
Five faculty members cast ballots.
Three favored Sunday, one Friday,
and the fifth said it would make no
difference.
A majority of persons who indi
cated by vote that, they never use the
library on Friday nights said they
would use it "often" on Sunday
nights.
Rare were the students who often
use the library on Friday nights and

even more rare are those who would
never use it on Sundays.
The vote on the question, "Do you
use the library on Friday nights?'
was: Often, 30; sometimes, 119;
never, 274.
And on the alternate question,
"Do you use the library on Sunday
nights?" the vote was: Often, 270;
sometimes, 147; and never, 19.
Different Majors Vote
According to the voters' answers
to the questions, "What is your ma
jor?" and "What class are you in?"
every department and division in the

University was represented in the
poll. The four classes also were rep
resented and the graduates covered
a wide range of years.
The ballot box was placed in the
Cellar and was in charge of Daily
tryoutees. In order to insure as
much accuracy as possible, tabula
tors threw out ballots favoring Sun
day but saying the student never
uses the library.
In addition, seven ballots appar
ently cast by the same person, who
never uses the library, were thrown
out.

ulty members" as Director Nathan
Van Patten indicated this week.
Graduates Sclcct Sunday
A total of 456 ballots were count
ed. Of this number, 404 favored
Sunday night and 52 favored Friday
night.
Of 55 graduates voting, 45 selected
Sunday as the best night for the
library to be open and 10 wanted
Friday.
Friday Not Preferred
Five faculty members cast ballots.
Three favored Sunday, one Friday,
and the fifth said it would make no
difference.
A majority of persons who indi
cated by vote that, they never use the
library on Friday nights said they
would use it "often" on Sunday
nights.
Rare were the students who often
use the library on Friday nights and

even more rare are those who would
never use it on Sundays.
The vote on the question, "Do you
use the library on Friday nights?'
was: Often, 30; sometimes, 119;
never, 274.
And on the alternate question,
"Do you use the library on Sunday
nights?" the vote was: Often, 270;
sometimes, 147; and never, 19.
Different Majors Vote
According to the voters' answers
to the questions, "What is your ma
jor?" and "What class are you in?"
every department and division in the

University was represented in the
poll. The four classes also were rep
resented and the graduates covered
a wide range of years.
The ballot box was placed in the
Cellar and was in charge of Daily
tryoutees. In order to insure as
much accuracy as possible, tabula
tors threw out ballots favoring Sun
day but saying the student never
uses the library.
In addition, seven ballots appar
ently cast by the same person, who
never uses the library, were thrown
out.
Eight out of nine Stanford stu
dents would prefer to have the li
brary open on Sunday night rather
than Friday, a Daily poll yesterday
indicated.
Undergraduates are most strongly
in favor of Sunday night openings,
but both graduates and the few fac
ulty members who voted would pre
fer Sunday, indicating the library
hours are not "set for the conveni
ence of graduate students and fac
ulty members" as Director Nathan
Van Patten indicated this week.
