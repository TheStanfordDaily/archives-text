# Rush Period to Start; Rules Listed for Frosh
## 
### GEORGE VENESS 
With the initial rushing period of the 1937-38 season only two days
away, Don Moulton, president of the Interfraternity Council, asks that
all frosh and row men pay particular attention to the rushing rules and
the penalties for their infraction.
For the first time copies of the rules have been distributed to all Encina
rooms in the hope that freshmen will acquaint themselves with them

sufficiently to avoid any possible*
violation. Any questions regarding
rushing may be asked of sponsors
or in the Interfraternity Office, Room
1 of the Old Union.
Rules
The official rushing plan is as fol
lows:
1. There shall be no off-campus
rushing, except during vacations.
2. No fraternity man shall enter
Encina except with the permission
of a sponsor, not of his own house.
Freshmen must keep out of fra
ternity houses except during regu
lar rushing periods.
3. Contact of an informal nature
between new lower division men and
fraternity men shall be permitted.
4. No house may pledge more than
14 freshmen.
5. The above rules shall be in ef
fect during the period of fall foot
ball practice prior to autumn quar
ter registration.
6. No pledge is binding until
formal pledge day.
Rushing Periods
v raternity houses shall be open to
entertain new lower division men
each week-end, continuing until the
week-end before final examinations
of autumn quarter. The week-end
shall be interpreted to consist of the
following periods: Friday, 8 a.m.-12
p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m.-6 p.m. (There
will be no rushing the week-ends of
the U.S.C. game, the Big Game,
and over Thanksgiving.)
In January houses will entertain
men on the first week-end after
registration. The final rushing pe
riods will be the following Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, January
11, 12, and 13, on which days the
houses will be open from 11:30 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Formal pledging will be Friday,
January 14, and shall be conducted
by the lawyer system.
Penalties
The penalty for any infraction of
the above rules is at the discretion
of the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol. However, by means of the
Honor Code, signed by each house
president wherein he agrees to be
responsible for the actions of his
house during rushing, it is hoped
that no infractions will occur. Both
rushces and fraternities are subject
to penalty.
Any infraction of the rules must
be reported to a member of the In
terfraternity Board within 15 days
after its occurrence.
