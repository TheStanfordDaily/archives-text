# Guidance Group Makes New Plans
## 
### 
General plans for the coming year
were mapped out yesterday after
noon by the Vocational Guidance
Committee, a student group with the
purpose of closing the gap between
women's living units and Dean
Yost's office.
It was decided that a tea will be
given for new transfer students soon,
but a definite date has not been set.
The committee brings in outside
speakers to discuss informally with
interested students the require
ments of their particular kind of
work. They hope to have successful
graduates speak at various winter
quarter meetings.
Chairman of the committee is
Georgia Pettibone; other members
include Patricia McMurtry, Eliza
beth Verheyen, Margaret Loud, Lee
Lewis, Marjorie Segerstrom. Sally
Harwood, and Janet Mclntyre.
