# Committee Okays Cut In NYA Funds
## Refuses To Be Alarmed Over Farm's Halved Relief Appropriation 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
Stanford's NYA appropriation,
chopped to almost half last year's,
will be sufficient to take care of the
campus' government-subsidized stu
dents, an unalarmed Ex Committee
decided last night.
The committee felt that with
"times better anyway," outside em
ployers would furnish jobs enough
for all worthy students.
Because NYA budgets have been
sliced all over the country, the Na
tional Student Federation of Amer
ica asked the A.S.S.U. to co-operate
in a national drive to restore the
original appropriation.
Dr. J. Pearce Mitchell, University
registrar and head of Stanford's
NYA committee, said the cut was
"'not as bad as it appeared," that
stricter check-up of need eliminated
many students anyway, Bob Garret
son, Ex Committee senior man, told
the legislators.
Other student body business:
THE CINEMA: Bill Hovey will try
his best to line up enough good and
old motion pictures to warrant
opening the Memorial Hall for Sun
day night "flicking."
LECTURES: With Ex Committee's
word to go ahead, Beth Allen will
next week provide a list of noted
lecturers — Carl Sandburg, Stuart
Chase, William Rose Benet, and
others —from which to select a
speaker for a trial lecture winter
quarter. If patronized sufficiently, a
Lecture Series patterned after Con
cert Series will be permanently es
tablished.
DRAMA: "Stanford Players," the
new Stanford theatrical society's
tentative name, asked that Ex Com
mittee forget about the constitution
they submitted last week until
they've had time to "fix it up a bit."
Seems Dr. Wilbur found it wordy
and ambiguous.
ELECTION BOARDERS: Eleven
new vote-counters will help Election
Chairman Dick Riddell count votes
next week. They are—Gertrude
Ahlswede, Lucy Bell, Shirley Hana- I
wait, Ward Beecher, Bill Rosenfeld,!
Temple Wanamaker, Dave Stephen- \
son, Ruth Ide, Betty Brown, Betty
Mioses, and Barbara Bauer.
HASHER S BALL: Fred Giari and j
Vein Leahy asked Ex Committee i
how to put on a dance. They and ]
other campus hashers want to raise \
money for a Hasher's Scholarship j
wtih a Hasher's Ball. They were ad- :
vised to hash it over with A.S.S.U. {
godesses, secretaries Stevie and Aten. |
LETTERS: When all Ex Commit- ]
tee members received threatening
letters from one Jose Rodriguez last |
Saturday, they ran and hid their j
heads. Last night President Tom :
Killefer said Dr. Wilbur said not to j
worry, even though Student Man- j
ager Chuck Fontius notified every- ;
one that he was staying in the hospi
tal "till the whole thing blows over." j
