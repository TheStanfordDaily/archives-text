# Stevens Will Speak On Penitente Cult
## 
### 
Thomas Wood Stevens, new di
rector of the Department of Speech
and Drama, and former head of the
Clobe Theater Players, will present
a dramatic interpretation of the
Penitente Cult of New Mexico at
7:30 o'clock tomorrow evening in
the Little Theater.
Mr. Stevens will read "The Pro
cession of Three Stations," which he
wrote after witnessing the only rit
ual that this religious group allows
the public to see. This work will be
published shortly in Theater Arts
Magazine.
It expresses the thoughts running
through the minds of the participants
in the religious ceremony as imag
ined by the author. The Penitentcs
march for two hours during the
proceedings while two of their
members drag gigantic crosses.
