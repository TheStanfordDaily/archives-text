### 
DENVER, Oct. 12 (U.R).—William
Green tonight rejected C.1.0. sug
gestions for a joint peace conference
between the warring groups and
.shattered brief hopes that organized
labor's civil war might be settled in
the near future.
"This is just another C.1.0. docu
ment issued for C.1.0. consump
tion," Green told reporters at a
press conference following conclu
sion of today's session of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor conven
tion.
He referred to the lengthy tele
gram sent to him from Atlantic City
by John L. Lewis' "war council" of
•rebel union leaders.
"It is obvious that it smacks of
insincerity and lacks good faith."
