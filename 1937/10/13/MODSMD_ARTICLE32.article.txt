# Nitery, A.S.S.U. Office Ransacked By Thieves
## 
### 
Sneak thieves disrupted the routine yesterday at the A.S.S.U. office.
liold-ups are bad enough, but it is much worse when people just take
things without saying anything about it, think Miss Aten and Miss Stevens,
secretaries at the office.
First it was the A.S.S.U.'s date book, in which are recorded dates ap
proved by Ex Committee. It just wasn't there when they started to pick

it up yesterday. Now no one can
remember what dates have been
granted far this quarter. They hope
someone just borrowed it and will
bring it right back.
Furniture at the Nitery is also in
the process of disappeai'ing, only
more gradually. Several cigarette
stands, a floor lamp, and an over
stuffed chair are missing to date,
according to the latest inventory
made yesterday.
The chair, says Miss Stevens, was
too large to be taken easily out of
the door. The window was the only
alternative, and it was in broad
daylight too. Consensus is that it
was "a very smooth job."
