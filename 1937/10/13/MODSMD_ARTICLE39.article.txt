RIVAL COACHES SHOULD
STAGE GRID BATTLE
A clever idea for the Big Game
floated in from Strawberry Canyon
the other day from the fluent pen
of Daily Californian Sports Editor
Dick Toner.
Dick suggests a preliminary foot
ball game betweeu the coaching
stall's of Stanford and California.
The teams would play two and
one-half minute quarters with a
half hour's rest between halves
and 15-minute quarter intermis
sions.
The two line-ups would be stud
ded with former All-Americans and
if the old-timers could last through
ten minutes of gridiron warfare the
fans might see plenty of action.
The whole idea is pretty fantastic
but it sounds good and fills up
space.
The Bear coaches can produce
three former All-Americans in their
line-up: Irv Phillips, end; and
Frank Wickhorst and Larry Lutz,
tackles. The Indians could put forth
five who were chosen the best in
the nation in their respective years:
Harry Shipkey and Tiny Thornhill,
tackles; Walt Heinecke, center; and
Bobby Grayson, fullback.
The Cal team would be rounded
out by Jim McCormick, end; Walt
Gordon and Stub Allison, guards;
Hutch Medanich, center; Irv
Uteritz, quarter; Clint Evans and
Chuck Brochious, halfbacks; and
Joe Smith, full.
The others on the Card t eleven, ac
cording to Toner, would be Larry
Rouble and Woody Adams, guards;
Ben Winkelman, tackle; Bones Ham
ilton, quarter; and Husky Hunt and
John Bunn, halves.
I don't know anything about the
Cal coaching set-up but there would
be two hitches in Toner's selection
of a Stanford team. Walt Heinecke
is not connected wtih the Farm
coaching staff any more and Larry
Rouble is coaching an Arizona high
school team.
LARRY AND FRANKIE
ARE DOING ALL RIGHT
Incidentally, Larry's high school
team in Phoenix, Arizona, won their
first two games of the season. He's
been sending urgent letters to Tiny
Thornhill and Grant Stone for more
plays. Larry's given the high school
gridders all the plays he knows and
still they are clamoring for moi - e.
This leads into another member of
Stanford's famous vowing sophs,
who is coaching prep pigskin artists.
Frankie Alustiza was down for the
U.C.LA. game last Saturday and was
all smiles after little brother's great
showing against the Bruins. Frankie
coaches a high school in Sacramento
and has done all right by himself.
His boys have won their first three
games.
DAILY CARTOONIST
IS TOPNOTCHER
It's pretty evident that the Stan
ford Daily has one of the best col
lege newspaper cartoonists in the
entire country. Tom Thompson's
colorful cartoons depicting the Stan
ford steam-roller have come in for
plenty of favorable comment.
If you want to compare Thomp
son's work with that found in other
college papers, you might start with
Cal's paper. The work done by the
Daily Cal's cartoonist, Karl Kasten,
looks decidedly amateurish beside I
Tom's bi-weekly efforts.
