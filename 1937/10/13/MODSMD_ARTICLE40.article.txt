# Thornhill Puts Team Through Hard Practice
## Injury Shifts Garnier; Paulman Works Out With Arm in Sling 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Tiny really poured it to them yes
terday.
Pointing out that "we can't let
'em think this is lay-off week," the
husky varsity grid mentor followed
I yesterday's kicking contest with one
of the hardest charging and tack
ling practices this season.
Corrects Weakness
Backfield men and ends worked
out on the tackle dummy to over
come weakness in tackling that ap
peared in rear and flank positions
Saturday in the Stanford-Bruin
tilt.
Although Saturday's game seemed
to bring out hidden charging talent
in the Big Red Machine, Coach
Thornhill decided to waive scrim
mage and put linemen through a
tough push behind the seven-man
sled.
Paulman Kicks
Bill Paulman, whose shoulder lig
ament was torn in the Oregon game,
was back on the field in a sweat suit.
His arm was still bound up in a
sling, but it did not keep him from
warming up his passing arm and
place-kicking in his traditional
fashion.
He even tried a little one-handed
punting, but showed he still needed
a left mit to help hold the ball.
Garnier Out
Ed "Slaughterhouse" Garnier will
probably not play right half again
this season. His ankle is still in bad
shape, so that he will not be able
to use the cutting tactics necessary
in a halfback position.
Garnier has been switched to quar
terback for the remainder of the
1937 season. To fill the vacancy on
the right halfback reserve list, Coach
Thornhill is orienting Rod Parker,
quartei-back on last year's frosh
combination, to the half spot.
Rasmussen Watches
Neil Rasmussen, who was released
from the hospital with a sprained
ankle from Saturday's game, leaned
on crutches to watch yesterday's
session. Bobby Matthews, still both
ered by a cleat-wound on the leg,
warmed up in a sweat suit.
Although Tiny will put the boys
through fundamentals again today a
scrimmage is promised for tomorrow
afternoon and another Friday.
