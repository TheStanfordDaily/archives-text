# Shipkey Praises Troy; Frosh To Meet Greys
## 
### 
Sitting in the medical room of the Encina locker with his right foot
in a hot bath, Harry Shipkey spoke pretty philosophically of the 14-0
defeat his frosh football team suffered at the hands of the Trobabes
Saturday.
"We were just up against a better team Saturday. They looked pretty
good, and I guess we looked pretty bad. But then a winning team always

►looks good,
"And then they couldn't play well
with me being crippled; I couldn't
storm up and down in front of the
bench," Shipkey laughed, pulling
his right leg out of the bath and
looking at his swollen foot. (He
pulled a muscle in his leg last week
in practice.)
McCloud Good at Quarter
"Norm Standlee played excep
tionally well for us on offense, but
his passing was a little off because
he had a bad wrist. Johansen and
Braheny looked very good at the
tackle positions and Farquharson
was good on defense at end."
"McCloud showed good possibili
ties at quarter. He's small, but he's
got plenty of fight. I'm going to give
him a chance to show what he's got
next week."
The frosh have no game scheduled
for Saturday, but they play their
annual game against the Grays Fri
day. "If we want to win that game
and the rest of our games this sea
son, we'll have to develop a kick
ing attack," Shipkey said. "One
reason U.S.C. beat us was that they
had exceptional kickers. Of course,"
he added, "they do have a good line
and backfield."
This week the team will concen
trate on power plays along with then
passing attack. They will scrimmage
today, with work on power plays.
