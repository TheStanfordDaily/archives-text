# Platinum Dye Plays Havoc On SAE Dog
## 
### SUE HYMAN 
Napoleon returned to the Stanford
campus yesterday, in robes of im
perial purple, when the S.A.E. dog
was seen roaming up the row, a
purple hue replacing his usual
brown and white.
His slightly confused and bewil
dered fraternity brothers followed,
unable to fathom the great problem
of platinum hair dye bringing pur
ple results.
Napoleon met his Waterloo when
S.A.E. sophomores decided that the
beauty of platinum hair would create
a different atmosphere in the house.
With thoughts of an exotic blonde,
they turned the house into a beauty
parlor and dumped Nap into a tub
of platinum dye. But when he
emerged the platinum had gone ber
serk and he stood royally clad be
fore them.
Awed by his regal splendor, they
rushed him into the street, probably
with hopes of the sun bleaching him
back to normal. With the appear
ance of Napoleon in full dress word
drifted about that an oddity with
four legs and unnatural coloring was
threatening the S.A.E.'s, and two
reporters were sent off to determine
the species of the monster.
Driving up and down back streets
they inquired of passers-by about a
purple dog. Abnormal psychology
profs cast longing eyes at them,
certain that here was excellent ma
terial for coming lectures.
