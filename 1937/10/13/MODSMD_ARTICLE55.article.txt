Mr. Nathan Van Patten
Director of Stanford Libraries
Dear Sir:
Unlike the currently unpopular Jose Rodrigez,
who spells his name as no Spaniard would spell
it and writes letters no thoughtful Loyalist would
write, this letter is to neither threat nor misspell.
You are undoubtedly aware that there has
been some discussion concerning the hours
which you set for the Stanford Library. Daily
editorials have viewed with alarm, students
have occasionally fumed, and counts have been
made of the "draw" of Friday night's libe.
These, you have no doubt considered in
sufficient proof of the general student wish,
which you as director of libraries most certainly
wish to meet, to warrant a change from the
existing system of Friday openings and Sunday
closings.
But yesterday The Daily went into your field

so far as to furnish you with unmistakable evi
dence that your week-end hours are not as
students would have them, and this morning
you may be surprised to know that eight out of
every nine students disagree with your policy.
I'll grant you, Mr. Van Patten, that often these
editorial letters are nothing more than fumes
from the journalistic hot collar. This one isn't.
Its purpose is to point out to you quietly what
was unmistakably proved yesterday—that Stan
ford students want the Stanford library open on
Sunday rather than Friday.
And so, unless you completely disregard the
majority wish, which, may I say, is difficult for
one in your position to do, the library will an
nounce an immediate change in week-end
hours.
It is your move now, Sir.
Sincerely,
Gordy Frost
