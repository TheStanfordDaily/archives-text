LAST June, the greatest number of women
ever to graduate from Stanford filed out of
the amphitheater with leather-cased diplomas
under their left arms and four years of stiff com
petition for A.B. degrees behind them.
This October, a correspondingly great num
ber of these women graduates are attending
business school with shorthand pads under
their arms and a year's competition with high
school misses ahead of them.
Miss Stanford of 1937 doesn't necessarily re
sent going to business school, but she feels as
if she's taken a four-year setback. Perhaps she
didn't earn from college a "cum laude" on her
diploma or a Phi Bete key for her neck; but she
probably had a strong B average, plus several
extra-curricular activities.
A number of Miss Stanfords of 1937 left the
Farm last June to find themselves with nothing
to do. Most of them knew that, while they were
waiting to get married, they'd like to keep busy
at something more inspiring than going home
to plan Father's dinner menus and play bridge
with Mother. The point was that they didn't
know what they could do.
When last year's seniors first entered Stan
ford, some of the women had vague dreams of
entering the business world after graduation;
they'd expected college to help them crash it.
After being in Stanford four years, they saw
that almost the only route by which a woman
can enter business, even as a private secretary,
is via the typewriter, Gregg's shorthand manual,
and the rest of "secretarial training." That is
why the paths of so many led straight from the
top of the Frost amphitheater to business school.
Stanford hadn't helped these women prepare
for any job after college. They'd formed a lot
of valuable friendships and received some -in
teresting knowledge in classes. But after four
university years they thought it queer to get
business training in a school which could be
attended by high school seniors. Why, some
wondered, couldn't a few business school es
sentials be included in a university curriculum?
It wasn't that Stanford had been entirely dis

regarding her co-ed population. Miss Stanfords
of 1937 had applauded the practice courses in
the education department and new courses like
"Women in the Home." But all Stanford women
couldn't turn out to be teachers or housewives —
at least not for a while.
At any rate, Miss Stanfords of 1937 are going
to business school.
And Stanford still has the problem of Miss
Stanfords of 1938 and after.—M. L.
