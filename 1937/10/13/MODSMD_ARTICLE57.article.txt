KNOCK, KNOCK
/ CRITICS of American universities have a four-star
complaint with which they assault our patience at
least once in every argument. They say that students
do not take an interest in world affairs, that they con
sider a jolly-up more important than an international
"incident." And in these days, when people are spend
ing half their time talking peace, and the other half
wondering how they will look in uniform, the students'
calmness comes in for as much abuse as a fi'osh on
the law steps.
"Patriotic" organizations trying to raise money to
lever the iron heel off the neck of Spain (China, Yugo
slavia, Italy) collect barely enough to pay for their
cough syrup. They call students self-centered. Cam
paigners who want to restore liberty and the ideals of
our forefathers find that an audience of half a dozen
is cause for rejoicing. They call students apathetic.
j** * *
But the acid of this criticism burns no holes in the
student hide; which indicates that our universities
have one or two saving graces even if they weren't
founded during the Abclard-Heloise flirtation.
Presumably, students come to college to learn some
thing. Under the present set-up anybody who wants
to reform the world can join the Young Communist
League and get down to business immediately. Those
who come to college are expected to adopt a reason
ably objective attitude, and spend their time amass
ing grade points instead of cursing dictators.
* * * *
MERICAN colleges are not designed to act as spon
sors for removers of iron heels. They are not in
tended to mother riot and revolution. Our educational
philosophy does not insist that a college provide a
shoulder where every frustrated radical can weep.
And despite the comments of some professors, col
lege students are human, and are therefore entitled to
a little relaxation. It may be great sport to mope about
the coming of the (what's your favorite color?) peril.
But after a brisk workout with the law of diminishing
returns the student can't be censured if he prefers a
trip to Roble.
â™¦ * * *
And so anyone who has been troubled by a guilty
conscience when he slept through an eight-o'clock
instead of rising early to grab the paper, may set his
restless soul at case. Students come to college to learn,
not to dictate how the world should work. If we can
believe the life insurance companies, we will stick
around long enough to see plenty of international
incidents, but the number of jolly-lips is definitely
limited.
