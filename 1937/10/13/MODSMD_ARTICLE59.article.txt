# WHEN MINNESOTA LOSES

### 
V|T/HAT may the University expect after the 5-point
disaster at Nebraska last Saturday?
Perhaps we do not give football its due importance,
but a rapid and steadily accelerating decline in regis
tration is the least we may expect. All agitation for a
greater University has already ceased. The Continua
tion center will be abandoned and the new business
building will ever remain a pit by the mall with a
rusting steam shovel in it. Folwell hall will crumble
amid wreaths of ivy and stacks of musty old themes.
A reliable press service reports that, as Minnesota
failed to score in the last period, all seniors in the con
solidated high school at Rutabaga Center made a blan
ket switch from Minnesota as a college choice to—
well, to Nebraska.
Scholarship, too, will slip. It stands abuse so poorly.
Minnesota can hardly hope to keep its high rank as
an educational institution for more than two years
now, possibly three.
There are those disloyal cynics who mutter, "Well,
hell, it's just a game ..." They obviously ignore the
extreme melancholia displayed on the campus—the
undergraduates leaping from smokestacks, the faculty
members (above the rank of professorial lecturer),
committing hari kari, the transfer students crooning
dirges in dark corners of Northrop auditorium.
These same cynics may go so far as to say that the
world will continue to revolve on its customary axis,
the sun to rise and set as outlined in the combined
class schedule. Although we grant them that the in
fluence of the pigskin may not be interplanetary—
did you notice the sun didn't come up yesterday
morning?
