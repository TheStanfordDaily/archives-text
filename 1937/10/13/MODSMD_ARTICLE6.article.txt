# Subway Plans Fought in Paly
## Property Owners Call Underpass 'Damaging' 
### 
Counsel for several unidentified
Palo Alto property owners and mer
chants last night petitioned the city
council for a change in location of
the proposed University Avenue un
derpass.
They argued that damage will re
sult to business on the Circle if
present plans are followed. The pe
tition requested that the eastern ap
proach be moved "a sufficient dis
tance westward to allow the city to
relieve itself of these damages which
might otherwise directly occur."
City Engineer J. F. Bixbee ex
plained that the state division of
highways will probably begin work
on preliminary plans for the pi'o
posed underpass in about six weeks.
He said that the city would have the
opportunity of examining all details
of the plan before it is adopted.
The property owners feel it is
apparent that while the underpass
will serve the general public wel
fare the present plans will neverthe
less cause serious detriment and ma
terial damage to surrounding real
estate.
These property owners and lease
holders feel that it would be to the
mutual benefit of the city of Palo
Alto, the public interest, and the
property owners' interest, if the
eastern approach were moved a suf
ficient distance westward to allow
the city to relieve itself of unnec
essary damage.
