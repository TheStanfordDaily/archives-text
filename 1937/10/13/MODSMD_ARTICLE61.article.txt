# TONIGHT AT 8:30' SLIPS Acting Suves Second Series
## 
### 
When the accomplished Mr. Cow
ard composed the plays in the sec
ond series of "Tonight at 8:30,*' now
running at the Curran, he was cer
tainly not pointing a moral. Before
the evening is over, one wonders
whether he was even trying to adorn
a tale.
Not that "Ways and Means,"
"Fumed Oak," and "Shadow Play"
are poorly written. The usual epi-

grammatic glitter
which overlies all
Coward plays is
present here, al
most to satiety in
some cases. The
characters manage
to be funny
enough or un
pleasant enough
or peculiar
enough to hold
attention, even
when the situa
tions begin to
.show lack of ap-

plication on the part of their crea
tor.
Play Unfinished
"Ways and Means" opens in bed
and stays there. Stella and Toby
Cartwright are two charming and
impoverished social parasites. Their
hostess has done everything but ac
tually demand that they leave, and
the outlook seems decidedly black.
After two scenes devoted almost
exclusively to being witty, witty,
they think they have found the way
out. His name is Stevens, he is a
chauffeur-turned-burglar, and when
he extracts 150,000 francs and a
diamond necklace from the neigh
boring room all seems well. Unfor
tunately, however, the Cartwrights
permit themselves to be bound and
gagged to add to the realism of the
thing, and Stevens departs with the
swag. The curtain comes down,
leaving a curiously unfinished play.
"Fumed Oak" relates the sad tale
of Henry Gow, a mild man beset by
a hellish family. The first scene is
excellent. The second scene is fun
ny up to a point.
Acting Excellent
After that point is reached, it be
gins to seem much too one-sided.
Nobody could be quite as bad as
Henry's wife and daughter and
mother-in-law. Nobody could be
quite as good as Henry inferentially

is. The whole thing, in other words,
is written too much from one point
of view to be satisfying.
In "Shadow Play" Mr. Coward has
attempted to write the story of a
dream, complete with all the charac
teristics of a dream. To a certain
extent he has succeeded; but the
play is over almost before one
realizes what it is all about.
Bramwell Fletcher, Helen Chand
ler, and the highly accomplished
Estelle Winwood extract the most
from their various parts, pushed for
honors by Clare Verdera and Claud
Allister, whose auto-ride pantomime
in "Shadow Play" is delightful.
Acting is excellent; but as far as
the writing is concerned, one feels
that perhaps Mr. Coward has relied
on his reputation just a little too
heavily in the creation of these
brightly inconsequential fragments.
