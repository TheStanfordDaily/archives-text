# F.D.R. Chats On Program For Future
## Neutrality, Child Labor, Crop Control, Wages Discussed on Radio 
### BILL MILLIS 
A four-point "program for the im
mediate future" along lines of new
crop control legislation; the regu
lation of wages, hours, and child
labor; the stricter control of busi
ness monopolies; and the prevention
of a new world war was outlined
by President Roosevelt in his na
tionally broadcast "fireside chat"
last night.
The President's address came
shortly after he summoned a spe
cal session of Congress to convene
on November 15 to consider these
problems, the United Press reported.
The President believes that his pro
gram has a fair chance of being com
pleted before Christmas.
"U.S. Seeks Peace"
"Aloofness from war is not pro
moted by unawareness of war," the
nation's chief executive declared in
his address. "Peace cannot just be
wished for and just waited for."
Declaring that "peace means the
acceptance by all nations of certain
fundamental decencies in their re
lations with each other," he con
cluded his address by saying:
"America hates war. America hopes
for peace. Therefore, America ac
tively engages in the search for
peace."
Following out his belief that war
may be prevented by "the co-opera
tive search for peace of all the na
tions that want it," the President
declared that the United States will
attend the coming Brussels Nine-
Power Confex-ence which will at
tempt to seek a solution of the pres
ent Far Eastern crisis.
Earlier in his address the Presi
dent said that "business, agriculture,
and labor must provide a balanced
economy without waste." Roosevelt
warned against being deceived by
"temporary prosperity" and said
that "the time to repair the roof is
when the sun is shining." He will
present a program to Congress call
ing for:
1. Crop-control legislation to pro
tect price levels.
2. Regional planning programs
for the reclamation of worn-out
land.
3. Legislation setting up mini
mum wages and maximum hours,
and restricting the employment of
women and children.
4. Governmental reorganization to
"make the democratic process work
more efficiently," and
5. The strengthening of the anti
trust laws.
