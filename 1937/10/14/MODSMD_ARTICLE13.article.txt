# London, Paris Delay Action Against Italy

### 
LONDON, .Oct. 13 (U.R). — Great
Britain and France, fearful of em
barking upon reprisals that might
lead to war, today capitulated to
Premier Benito Mussolini and
turned the Spanish "volunteers"
problem over to the London non
intervention committee.
They said, however, that if noth
ing satisfactory can be worked out
by the committee in two weeks,
France and Britain will be prepared
to take independent action.
Sources close to the British cabi
net said it was decided that if Mus
solini refuses to co-operate in giv
ing the Spanish war "back to the
Spaniards" by withdrawing his
thousands of blackshirts from the
Spanish mainland and the Balearic
Islands swift Anglo-French retali
ation will follow.
The non-intervention body, torn
by dissension since its organization,
was expected to meet Saturday and
the "deadline" for some solution of
the crisis was expected to be fixed
for two weeks hence.
The French cabinet will meet to
morrow at the call of Premier Ca
mille Chautemps to approve the last
resort decision to bring Italy to the
conference table.
FRENCH CABINET REJECTS
GESTURE AGAINST ITALY
PARIS, Oct. 13 <U.R).—French left
ists demanding an armed "gesture"
toward Italy were voted down to
day when an emergency conference
of cabinet ministers decided to stand
at Britain's side in a policy of tem
porary moderation regarding the
Spanish "volunteers" crisis.
The leftists, for the most part So
cialists of the Popular Front gov
ernment who are supported by the
Communists and powerful trade un
ions, are anxious for France to re
nounce her neutrality restrictions
and provide open support to the
Spanish Loyalists.
The majority of the key cabinet
figures who met with Premier Ca
mille Chautemps insisted, however,
upon a course of conciliation and
moderation to give Premier Musso
lini a "last chance" to quit his Span
ish venture.
