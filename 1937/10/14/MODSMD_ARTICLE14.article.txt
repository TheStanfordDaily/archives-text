# Austin Appears In Encinasylum
## 
### 
Another obstreperous Austin â€”
green this time, and apparently un
related to the much-publicized pride
of the Delta Chis, ran berserk in
the lobby of Encina shortly after
10:30 last night.
Encinamates reported a large
trunk had been thrown down the
stairs of the hall just previous to
the appearance of the abbreviated
vehicle, evidently in an effort to dis
tract the attention of sponsors while
the minicar was being carried in.
The driver of the Austin was not
known, however, and the unortho
dox equipage shortly vanished as
mysteriously as it had appeared.
