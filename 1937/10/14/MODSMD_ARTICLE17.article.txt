# Labor Troubles Discussion Held
## Walrus Club Condemns Dissension in Ranks 
### 
Labor must cease the struggle
within its own ranks before public
opinion forces drastic legislative
control of labor activities, was the
conclusion of the panel discussion
of the Walrus Club on "Legislation
for the Employer and the Employee"
last night.
In hopes of initiating a more force
ful campus program, the organiza
tion met for the first time last night
in the lounge of the Women's Club
house, at 7:30, with Discussion Lead
ers Paul Eliel, of the Stanford bus
iness department, and Hilden R.
Gibson, of the political science de
partment.
Outlines Topics
Mr. Gibson in outlining topics for
discussion drew on experiences he
had at the California State Federa
tion of Labor Convention in Long
Beach, and described activities of
the "goon" squad, which, he as
serted, conducts its coercive activi
ties under full recognizance of the
labor organization's leaders.
"There is no semblance of demo
cratic control of the labor group,"
he said. "Aggression against peace
ful settlement of the labor break, as
shown at this convention, is 95 per
cent in the hands of the leaders
rather than in group desire."
N.L.R.B. Ineffective
As briefed by Mr. Eliel, the Na
tional Labor Relations Board is in
effective because of labor itself, and
legislation for control of labor ac
tivity will be the result unless labor
seals the break between the A. F.
of L. and the C.1.0.
Walrus Club has been formed,
under the auspices of the Y.W.C.A.,
for the discussion of current events,
and, according to announcements,
future meetings will be held on Oc
tober 25, November 10, and Decem
ber 1, in the lounge.
