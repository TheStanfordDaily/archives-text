# MAN THINKS SELF DEAD

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13 (U.R).â€”
An unidentified man refused to give
his name to an ambulance steward
today after his rescue from San
Francisco Bay. Pressed for a reason
for his reticence, the rescued man
replied: "I can't tell you my name,
because I'm dead." Then he pulled
the blanket over his head to empha
size his declaration.
