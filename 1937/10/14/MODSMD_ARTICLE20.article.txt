# Buck Sees No Drastic U.S. War Policy Change
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
''England may expect every American to do his duty," as several
critics of Great Britain in this country have complained, but Professor
Philip W. Buck of Stanford's political science department believes that
both English optimists and American cynics will be disappointed if they
think that the New Deal is now going to embark on a crusade of pulling

other people's chestnuts out of the<
fires of war.
Commenting on President Roose- I
velt's newly - enunciated foreign
policy —as proposed in his recent
Chicago speech and in his "fireside
chat" on Tuesday, Buck said that "it
doesn't mean a drastic change in our
foreign policy. We won't commit
ourselves any further than in the
past."
Policy Told
Pointing out that in the past the
United States committed itself in
the Manchuria affair by adopting a
policy of non-recognition, Buck said
that Roosevelt in his "search for
peace" will follow "a policy of more
than passive co-operation" with the
Far Eastern advisory committee of
the League of Nations and with the
Nine-Power Conference.
Beyond a coincidence of purposes
between England and the United
States, Buck said there is not much
evidence of behind-the-scenes col
laboration between the two nations.
England Hesitant
This was shown at the time of
the President's Chicago address on
October 5, when at a League of Na
tions meeting held back from any
strong policy in regards to the Far
East, he declared. It was not until
after Roosevelt's speech that Great
SVitain changed her mind and
agreed to demands of other League
delegates for action in the Sino-
Japanese affair, he stated.
As for the future, Buck was em
phatic that "we won't assume lead
ership in the Nine Power Confer
ence, and we won't propose a line of
policy for the Far East." It is for
this reason that the conference will
be held in Brussels, and not in
Washington.
"Short of any extreme policy such 1
as military sanctions," the United
States will probably support any i
policy that the Nine Power Confer
ence adopts, he said.
However, Buck concluded that "as j
a group, the signatory nations to the j
Nine Power treaty are not willing to j
go far in dealing wilh (he present j
conflict in the Far East."

be held in Brussels, and not in
Washington.
"Short of any extreme policy such 1
as military sanctions," the United
States will probably support any i
policy that the Nine Power Confer
ence adopts, he said.
However, Buck concluded that "as j
a group, the signatory nations to the j
Nine Power treaty are not willing to j
go far in dealing wilh (he present j
conflict in the Far East."
''England may expect every American to do his duty," as several
critics of Great Britain in this country have complained, but Professor
Philip W. Buck of Stanford's political science department believes that
both English optimists and American cynics will be disappointed if they
think that the New Deal is now going to embark on a crusade of pulling

other people's chestnuts out of the<
fires of war.
Commenting on President Roose- I
velt's newly - enunciated foreign
policy —as proposed in his recent
Chicago speech and in his "fireside
chat" on Tuesday, Buck said that "it
doesn't mean a drastic change in our
foreign policy. We won't commit
ourselves any further than in the
past."
Policy Told
Pointing out that in the past the
United States committed itself in
the Manchuria affair by adopting a
policy of non-recognition, Buck said
that Roosevelt in his "search for
peace" will follow "a policy of more
than passive co-operation" with the
Far Eastern advisory committee of
the League of Nations and with the
Nine-Power Conference.
Beyond a coincidence of purposes
between England and the United
States, Buck said there is not much
evidence of behind-the-scenes col
laboration between the two nations.
England Hesitant
This was shown at the time of
the President's Chicago address on
October 5, when at a League of Na
tions meeting held back from any
strong policy in regards to the Far
East, he declared. It was not until
after Roosevelt's speech that Great
SVitain changed her mind and
agreed to demands of other League
delegates for action in the Sino-
Japanese affair, he stated.
As for the future, Buck was em
phatic that "we won't assume lead
ership in the Nine Power Confer
ence, and we won't propose a line of
policy for the Far East." It is for
this reason that the conference will
be held in Brussels, and not in
Washington.
