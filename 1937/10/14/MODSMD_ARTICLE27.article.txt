# Libe Official Calls Daily Poll Invalid
## Director Asks Further Proof of Students' Preference on Hours 
### 
"I wouldn't be convinced even if
petitions signed by every member
of the faculty and by every member
of the student body were presented
to me saying that the library would
be used on Sunday nights. I know
by experience that that doesn't mean
they would use it."
That is Nathan Van Patten's rea
son, given yesterday afternoon to
Gordy Frost, editor of The Daily, for
keeping "the libe" open on Friday
nights and closed on Sunday nights.
Frost's conference with Van Pat
ten, director of Stanford Libraries,
followed editorial criticism of pres
ent library hours in Monday's issue
of The Daily, and publication in yes
terday's issue of an "open letter" to

the library director and an an
nouncement of results in a straw
poll in which 404 votes were cast for
Sunday night# as compared to 52
for Friday nights.
Questions Poll
Van Patten particularly doubted
the validity of The Daily's straw
poll as a representative cross-sce
tion of campus opinion, saying that
only one-fifth of the students voted.
He suggested that other measures
should be undertaken to find out the
preference of a majority of students
and faculty befoi'e any action is
taken.
Such a poll should be taken
through Ex Committee and the A. S.
S. U., he suggested, and should ques
tion at least 50 per cent of the stu
dents and faculty before he would
regard it as "representative."
Discuss Vote
Also considered were proposals
that a vote on opening the library
Sunday night be carried out by giv
ing ballots to all who use the library,
with the ballots to be deposited at
one of the loan desks.
This plan, which is entirely tenta
tive, will be investigated further by
Van Patten and Frost, and then may
be presented to Ex Committee.
Factors that for the present make
Van Patten extremely dubious
about opening of the library on Sun
day night are:
1. Severe limitations on the li
brary's financial budget, preventing
the hiring of additional librarians.
2. The small number of the pres
ent staff, which would have to give
up Sunday nights for work during
nine months of the year.
3. The extensive use of the library
on Friday nights by faculty, grad
uates, and even undergraduates.
4. The alleged lack of satisfactory
attendance when the library has been
opened on the two Sunday nights
preceding finals, as has been the
practice for the past two years.
Cost of operating the library on
Sunday nights throughout the year
would be in the neighborhood of
$1000, Van Patten estimated, and he
doesn't know where he could find
that amount in the library's budget.
A decision to open the library dur
ing those hours would not rest with
him, he emphasized, but with the
University Administration.
Attendance 415
While maximum attendance on
Sunday nights before finals has been
only 60 students, Van Patten said
that last Friday night 385 people
used the reserve book room alone,
with more than 415 in the whole
library. He stated that "enough
students and faculty use the library
Friday night that I can't lock them
out.'*
Opening of the library on Sunday
nights before finals "was an ex
tremely expensive experiment," the
director declared. Judging from
that test, he said, "there is no rea
son to believe that attendance would
increase if the library were open on
regular Sundays."
