# Killefer Talks On England At Luncheon Club
## Youths of Poorer Class Accept Fate, Asserts A.S.S.U. President 
### 
The poorer classes of English
youth are resigned to their fate, said
Tom Killefer, student body presi
dent, in discussing his summer
abroad at Luncheon Club yesterday.
"Whatever was their father's due is
their due, many of the young British
/eel," said Killefer.
It was further stated that most of
the young people of college age in
England are shopkeepers, clerks, ap
prentices, or, at any rate, not at
tending schools. Class consciousness
is emphasized in England, asserted
Killefer, and the members of a serv
ing class, for instance, make no pre
tentions or allusions about belong
ing to any group other than their
own. "Such things as prominent
hashers or a student who works in
his professor's garden in the morn
ing and then borrows a car and
tux for the evening are unheard of."
Killefer, who had a first-hand op
portunity to observe the youth of
various nations by spending the
summer in youth hostels, said the
English poorer classes were more in
teresting than the upper classes,
who, though they feel sorry about
their less fortunate countrymen,
really regard them v/ith apathy.
Sumner Gill, Stanford student, is
scheduled to speak next week at
Luncheon Club on the labor problem
in the San Joaquin Valley.
