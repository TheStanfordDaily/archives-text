HURLS TOMATO
Another tomato was hurled at the
long-buried Pacific Coast Confer
ence "freeze-out" plan this week by
a San Francisco sports writer.
The occasion of the blast this time
is the impending dullest of dull
week-ends in bay region football.
This Saturday Stanford plays no one,
and the bone-crushing California
Bears play a ridiculous double
header against College of Pacific and
Cul Aggies. Then on Saturday the
unbeaten Santa Clara Broncos tangle
with the trampled P. U. outfit. P. U.
stands for Portland University.
The writer blames the freeze-out
for this deplorable situation and
states that the coast's only remain
ing "natural" could be played Sat
urday between California and Santa
Clara if it were not for this confer
ence concoction cooked up just to
make the smaller schools suffer.
Freeze-out or no freeze-out, this
coming week-end would probably
still be set aside as breathers for
the Indians and the Bears. Why the
Bears stage their farcical double
header is beyond me. It's far better
to take a complete day of rest and
save the fans' sense of good compe
tition in football than to put on a
comic gridiron show. *
FREEZE-OUT HIGHLY
MISUNDERSTOOD
The freeze-out, though it did hit
the independent schools pretty hard,
was NOT directed toward them. The
plan was put into effect so the Pa
cific Coast would have a conference
in fact as well as in name.
In previous years, conference
teams were not playing all other
schools in the conference. Of the
seven other conference teams, Stan
ford was playihg anywhere from
three to six of these teams a year,
but never all seven. And it was the
same with the other teams.
You can readily see that the con
ference wasn't a real football league
and the winner wasn't the truq
champion. Why have a conference if
all the teams aren't going to play
each other?
This next week-end is going to be
tough on the dyed-in-the-wool grid
Jans, but despite the ravings of the
San Francisco press, this coming
breather is inevitable and cannot be
laid at the door of the freeze-out
plan.
PRIESTLY "PULLING
A BILL TERRY"
It was stated in this column that
Ken Priestly, Cal graduate manager,
claimed that the California Memo
rial Stadium was the only confer
ence stadium to have electrical tim
ing clocks with second hands as well
as minute hands.
Maybe Mr. Priestly doesn't do
much traveling, but according to
Harry Press, our southern repre
sentative, the Los Angeles Coliseum
has em too. The Coliseum, you
know, is the home of both the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. and the Trojans of
U.S.C. Maybe Mr. Priestly is "pull
ing a Bill Terry" and honestly does
n't know the Bruins and the Trojans
are still in the conference.

plan was put into effect so the Pa
cific Coast would have a conference
in fact as well as in name.
In previous years, conference
teams were not playing all other
schools in the conference. Of the
seven other conference teams, Stan
ford was playihg anywhere from
three to six of these teams a year,
but never all seven. And it was the
same with the other teams.
You can readily see that the con
ference wasn't a real football league
and the winner wasn't the truq
champion. Why have a conference if
all the teams aren't going to play
each other?
This next week-end is going to be
tough on the dyed-in-the-wool grid
Jans, but despite the ravings of the
San Francisco press, this coming
breather is inevitable and cannot be
laid at the door of the freeze-out
plan.
PRIESTLY "PULLING
A BILL TERRY"
It was stated in this column that
Ken Priestly, Cal graduate manager,
claimed that the California Memo
rial Stadium was the only confer
ence stadium to have electrical tim
ing clocks with second hands as well
as minute hands.
Maybe Mr. Priestly doesn't do
much traveling, but according to
Harry Press, our southern repre
sentative, the Los Angeles Coliseum
has em too. The Coliseum, you
know, is the home of both the Bruins
of U.C.L.A. and the Trojans of
U.S.C. Maybe Mr. Priestly is "pull
ing a Bill Terry" and honestly does
n't know the Bruins and the Trojans
are still in the conference.

HURLS TOMATO
Another tomato was hurled at the
long-buried Pacific Coast Confer
ence "freeze-out" plan this week by
a San Francisco sports writer.
The occasion of the blast this time
is the impending dullest of dull
week-ends in bay region football.
This Saturday Stanford plays no one,
and the bone-crushing California
Bears play a ridiculous double
header against College of Pacific and
Cul Aggies. Then on Saturday the
unbeaten Santa Clara Broncos tangle
with the trampled P. U. outfit. P. U.
stands for Portland University.
The writer blames the freeze-out
for this deplorable situation and
states that the coast's only remain
ing "natural" could be played Sat
urday between California and Santa
Clara if it were not for this confer
ence concoction cooked up just to
make the smaller schools suffer.
Freeze-out or no freeze-out, this
coming week-end would probably
still be set aside as breathers for
the Indians and the Bears. Why the
Bears stage their farcical double
header is beyond me. It's far better
to take a complete day of rest and
save the fans' sense of good compe
tition in football than to put on a
comic gridiron show. *
FREEZE-OUT HIGHLY
MISUNDERSTOOD
The freeze-out, though it did hit
the independent schools pretty hard,
was NOT directed toward them. The
plan was put into effect so the Pa
cific Coast would have a conference
in fact as well as in name.
In previous years, conference
teams were not playing all other
