## SPORTS EDITORâ€”GENE GEAR Card Gridders To Scrimmage On Wet Field Tiny Will Drill Varsity In Rainy Day Tactics For Washington Tilt 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
"Live bait" is on the program at
the varsity practice grid this after
noon. A scrimmage between picked
teams of football candidates will be
gin at 3:30 o'clock.
It had been hoped that intermit
tent rains all day would soak the
ground enough for a wet-field prac
tice yesterday afternoon, but there
just wasn't enough water, and the
field was only soft.
Drill for Bad Weather
If bad weather continues, Tiny
may still have a chance to show the
boys wet-weather tactics, which will
come in handy if it rains at Seattle
a week from Saturday when the
Big Red Machine will confront the
University of Washington Huskies.
And the Columbia game is not too
far away to begin considering a
little slush rehearsal. They could
certainly have used it last year.
Paulman's Arm O.K.
Bill Paulman took his arm out of
a sling yesterday. He attended yes
terday's session in a sweat suit
again, and spent most of the after
noon running laps.
Neil Rasmussen was still leaning
on crutches on the sidelines, but he
expects to be able to run by next
Tuesday and to play the following
Saturday.
It is likely that there will be an
other scrimmage tomorrow.
