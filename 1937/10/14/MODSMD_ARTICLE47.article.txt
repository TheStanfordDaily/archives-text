# Indian Water Poloists To Meet Olympic Club
## 
### 
I)Â»n Peterson, ex-Card water polo star now playing with the Olympic
Club, donned a junior varsity cap last night and made four gouls in five
minutes against the Stanford varsity.
If the rest of the Olympic Club are as hot Saturday afternoon as was
Peterson last night. Coach Nort Thornton will likely be in for a goodly

share of woe before the week-end
is ovei\ The Los Angeles A. C., due
in for the Friday afternoon game,
already has established itself as the
most dangerous American opponent
that Thornton could have possibly
selected.
Slow in Starting
Thornton declared that his men
wore unusually slow in starting but
that they gained momentum as they
progressed. If the "ocast's greatest
scoring combination" of Johnny
Lamb and Captain Bill Hanna, Stan
ford's two all-Coast forwards, can
play the games without any let
down, The Farm squad should score
at least one upset before Sunday.
While the National Champions
from Los Angeles are favored to win,
an upset by the young Indians is not
entirely impossible. All the squad ex
cept Hanna and Lamb will be play
ing their first varsity game. How
ever, Stanford has looked good, at
times very good, in scrimmage.
Stars of Mercuries
Friday, it will be Daubenspeck
and O'Connor of the Los Angeles
Mercuries versus Hanna and Lamb.
Daubenspeck is the nation's leading
scorer; Lamb is the Coast's reigning
shot maker.
Thornton had a first-string work
ing last night which he declared
would start the Friday tilt. He had
Bill Hanna at sprint, Sophomore Bob
Plate and Lamb at forwards, Johnny
Vibert at center back, Transfer Har
vey Rothschild and Bob Allen at
guards.
