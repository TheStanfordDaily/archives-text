### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 13 (U.R). —
The policy committee of the Central
Labor Council threatened today to
call out on strike between 35,000 and
40,000 American Federation of Labor
employees Monday unless police can
prevent violence on the labor front
here.
The committee said that all A.F.L.
members in the city would be asked
to join the "holiday," paralyzing
practically all business here, "if the
constituted public authorities are
unable to restrain C.1.0. forces and
prevent a continuance of the law
lessness which has continued since
an official of the C.1.0. Lumber
Workers' Union announced that civil
rights will be denied A.F.L. mem
bers."
Police had difficulty in controlling
a crowd of between 300 and 400
C.1.0. pickets when the Plvlock Cor
poration opened Monday. The plant
was closed again and is scheduled to
reopen with police protection Thurs
day.
Although the policy committee can
recommend such a ''holiday," or
general strike, final action would
have to be taken by each union. If
the unions did, mass transportation
and trucking would halt, many of
the food store workers and practi
cally all meat cutters would go out.
Many milk truck drivers and dairy
employees would also be affected.
