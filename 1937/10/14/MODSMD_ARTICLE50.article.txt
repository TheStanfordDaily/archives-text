Once upon a time <he traek season used to bloom in the spring, tra la.
Now the darned thing keeps going all summer, and even keeps going, just
a wee hit into fall. The traek boys spend their summers traveling all
over the world, competing with the crack runners and jumpers from
other countries.

In Scandinavia this.summer was St

AJV.U. Squad Tours
The squad, accompanied by a
trainer-coach, spent two months
touring Sweden, Norway, and Fin
land. They got as fur a 9 the Russian
border, too, but their passports were
inadequate for travel in that country.
The Farm speedster did a full
time job, running 28 times in 23
meets, all of which were held under
the floodlights, and several in a
heavy rain. Most of the tracks, ac
cording to Mallott, could be com
pared to some of America's finest.
Several of them, however, were laid
out like a square, with four sharp
turns.
Traveled, by Plane
Nothing but the best was satisfac
tory for the team, which traveled in
style—flying from meet to meet.
What's more, they were treated to

55 miles per hour.
They never stop moving — and
moving fust—do these track men.
Why, track season is almost here
again—or is this still the last one?
