## Thru Stanford Libe, With Rod and Gun 
### 
LIBRARY Director Nathan Van Patten's mind
is closed as his library doors on Sunday
evening.
But he's willing to reason—if somebody can
open his mind, he'll try to open the doors.
That the majordomo of Stanford's study and
book rooms is as hard to convince as Gordy
Davis on a parking alibi, is not news to the bat
tered few who in the past have broached this
subject, which is rapidly gaining foothold as
one of the traditional Stanford gripes.
We talked to him yesterday and were sur
prised to hear him admit: "I wouldn't be con
vinced even if petitions signed by every mem
ber of the faculty and by every member of the
student body were presented to me saying that
the library should be used on Sunday nights. I
know by experience that that doesn't mean they
would use it."
It's hard to deal with a man like Mr. Van Pat
ten. He won't be convinced. He's sure that
The Daily's poll is haywire. He's positive that
The Daily's picture of an empty Friday libe was
posed. And above all, he's sure that no matter
what people say, they don't mean it. Those

mental doors are closed, tight.
Only one key will unlock the Van Patten mind
to the possibility of opening the library on Sun
day night. This would be an actual poll, man
for man, of a preference of week-end hours,
and then, only then, could the majority rule.
Thus he shifts the burden of proof from The
Daily, whose poll is both accurate and indica
tive of opinion but which he counts out because
it is a cross-section and not official, to the
A.S.S.U. Through this mouthpiece undergrad
uates may act to secure library hours which
meet their collective approval.
For three years there has been a continuous
grumble on the open Friday and closed Sunday
library. For three years students have asked
Daily support in requesting this change.
Today the A.S.S.U. has in its hands the key—
in the form of an official poll—which will open
both Mr. Van Patten's mind and the library
doors, and close an old problem.
Turn that key now, and quiet this omnipresent
bleating by frustrated Sunday night library
users, with a man-for-man proof that the uncon
vinced Mr. Van Patten quite incredibly is wrong
—this time.
