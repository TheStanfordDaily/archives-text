# . . . Camera, Action
## 
### 
CANDID campus cameraddicts—probably the
most rapidly increasing group on the Farm
—have been asking recently and continually
for intelligent instruction in the various phases
of photography.
But, as in the case of the popularly requested
typing course, the University takes no action,
and continues to offer most inadequate photog
raphy instruction. Only course on the campus
is a one-unit "very independent study" plan
open only to journalism majors.
While Northwestern, Oklahoma, Minnesota,
and other universities 6ffer training in photog
raphy, all plans for such a course on the Farm
are denied. Perhaps this is another indication
of the disapproving frown directed by the Uni
versity toward courses which might be con
strued by the students and the outside world
as "fun."
Gripes were numerous when the recently in
stituted "history of the motion picture" ap
peared in the curriculum. Profs grumbled that
it was silly to give credit for going to the mov
ies—and the course was made as tough as any
at Stanford; in fact, tougher than most.
Unlike state universities where a course may
always be instituted by popular demand—Stan
ford lets logic rule and logic does not seem to
adapt itself to "hobbies."
It's not that available physical resources
are lacking. If the budget of no one depart
ment is large enough to handle a photography
course, substantial syllabus fees could be

charged, or two or three departments might
co-operate.
The chemistry department could handle the
technical side while the art department super
vised the camera work. If necessary, special
sections on news and scientific photography
could be handled by the journalism and physics
departments.
Photography is a hobby as well as a profitable
business for many thousands; but of the great
est importance is its increasing significance as
one of the fine arts. Art is not ignored at Stan
ford—why photography?—J. R.
