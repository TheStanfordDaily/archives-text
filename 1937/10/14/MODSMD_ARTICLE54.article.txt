pERHAPS once or twice a quarter, an almost-bril
liant idea manages to penetrate the fog of student
government, and makes liars out of pessimistic observ
ers. Tuesday night an idea emerged from the mists
of Ex Committee debate that should find a path
through the sad hearts of those who expected nothing
more original than an appropriation for an adding
machine to total the number of sub-committees.
The plan, stated with un-legislative briefness, is to
organize a lecture series patterned after the success
ful concert series. Thus stripped for examination, the
idea does not sound particularly earth-shaking; but
as the Dutch boys said of Manhattan, it has possi
bilities.
* * * *
According to the plan worked out by Beth Allen,
a season program of lectures by genuinely "noted"
speakers coul be arranged. Bookkeeping could be
combined with that of the concert series, season tickets
being sold in the same way.
Such lecturers as Carl Sandburg, Thomas Mann,
and Stuart Chase have offered to speak here.
Ex Committee has decided to arrange one lecture,
and has commissioned Beth Allen to furnish a list of
speakers available. From these one will be chosen,
and if the test proves successful, a scries will be con
sidered for next year.
* * * *
Adoption of the new lecture plan would save Stan
ford considerable fussing and fuming, and would keep
brains already probed to the bottom from being ran
sacked for more ideas. Our present lecture set-up is
hardly a thing for which to fight and die. We have
some talks that are remarkably good; we also endure
some that make Hamlet's "To sleep, perchance to
dream" sound very attractive. But the great trouble
is that our resources are wasted in dozens of small
investments. We have as many assorted lecturers as a
Phi Bete has grade points, but we have pitifully few
"big names" that will draw students.
And unless lectures draw students, any attempt to
charge admission will be ridiculous. Similarly, unless
we have the money that admissions would bring, we
cannot engage "big names." This set-up shows all the
ear-marks of a vicious circle, even to those whose
minds are not mathematical.
* * * *
AS it is now, students find that the powers of dark
ness, represented by a trip down the highway,
flatten the powers of light in the first round. The
movie theaters are always luring us away from the
lecturers, even if the pirates do charge 40 cents.
The plan for a lecture series offers a way out of
the mess. Instead of 50 mnior lectures a year, we
could have half a dozen major ones. These would
draw enough students to raise most of the ante; the
rest could come from funds formerly used on small
lectures.
And so, unless the scheme gets lost in the technical
underbrush, student govcrnmeift can point to it as
the idea of the quarter, and can go back to appointing
' übrominillces.

machine to total the number of sub-committees.
The plan, stated with un-legislative briefness, is to
organize a lecture series patterned after the success
ful concert series. Thus stripped for examination, the
idea does not sound particularly earth-shaking; but
as the Dutch boys said of Manhattan, it has possi
bilities.

According to the plan worked out by Beth Allen,
a season program of lectures by genuinely "noted"
speakers coul be arranged. Bookkeeping could be
combined with that of the concert series, season tickets
being sold in the same way.
Such lecturers as Carl Sandburg, Thomas Mann,
and Stuart Chase have offered to speak here.
Ex Committee has decided to arrange one lecture,
and has commissioned Beth Allen to furnish a list of
speakers available. From these one will be chosen,
and if the test proves successful, a scries will be con
sidered for next year.

Adoption of the new lecture plan would save Stan
ford considerable fussing and fuming, and would keep
brains already probed to the bottom from being ran
sacked for more ideas. Our present lecture set-up is
hardly a thing for which to fight and die. We have
some talks that are remarkably good; we also endure
some that make Hamlet's "To sleep, perchance to
dream" sound very attractive. But the great trouble
is that our resources are wasted in dozens of small
investments. We have as many assorted lecturers as a
Phi Bete has grade points, but we have pitifully few
"big names" that will draw students.
And unless lectures draw students, any attempt to
charge admission will be ridiculous. Similarly, unless
we have the money that admissions would bring, we
cannot engage "big names." This set-up shows all the
ear-marks of a vicious circle, even to those whose
minds are not mathematical.
* * * *
AS it is now, students find that the powers of dark
ness, represented by a trip down the highway,
flatten the powers of light in the first round. The
movie theaters are always luring us away from the
lecturers, even if the pirates do charge 40 cents.
The plan for a lecture series offers a way out of
the mess. Instead of 50 mnior lectures a year, we
could have half a dozen major ones. These would
draw enough students to raise most of the ante; the
rest could come from funds formerly used on small
lectures.
And so, unless the scheme gets lost in the technical
underbrush, student govcrnmeift can point to it as
the idea of the quarter, and can go back to appointing
' übrominillces.
