tJICH MAN, poor man, beggar man, United States
senator will all be bib-and-tuckered Friday night
for the opening of the San Francisco opera season. The
first night's opera is Verdi's "Aida," and will bring
Metropolitan head-liner Gina Cigna to the coast for
the first time. The old guard hobbles along with Kir
sten Flagstad, Lauritz Melchior, Ezio Pinza, Emanuel
List, Richard Bonelli, Lily Pons (both returning after
several years' absence), Kathryn Meisle, and a good
many others who manage quite nicely, thank you.

This season brings two operas never before per
formed in San Francisco: Beethoven's "Fidelio," and
Bellini's "Norma." And it is high time that this coast
debut took place, for "Fidelio," vocally killing as it is,
remains a magnificent reflection of the great genius
behind it. And "Norma," though obvious and clumsy
as to plot and action, contains a store of undeniably
beautiful melody.
Since we ride with the mass on the current wave
of Wagner worship, we regret that only "Tristan"
and "Lohengrin" will be performed. But nevertheless,
we figure to get along pretty well on the season's
schedule.

The current series of one-acts at the Curran, "To
night at 8:30," demonstrates admirably what has almost
become a Noel Cowardian axiom. Whatever he does,
he does so that people like it. Even more, so that
usually a whole slough of people with plenty of box
office to go with them, like it. Witness the sheer
pageantry of his "Cavalcade." Now whether you think
the play is great, or only a set of slick stage tricks,
you'll have to admit that the swing of the thing
couldn't help appealing to all God's children who love
a waving flag. There are lots of them.

And Lord, how the sophisticates went for such stuff
as "Design for Living" for instance; and the senti
mental, for "Bittersweet." Coward gives 'em what they
want, and is most successful when he does that and
nothing more—witness "Point Valaine," which smelled
when he tried his hand at deep psychology.
* # * *
And this series of one-acts. No two persons have yet
agreed on which play or set of plays was the best, but
you'll have trouble in finding anyone who didn't like
it at all. The formula was simple—just write one of
each type of show which woi'ked before, and you
draw applause from practically everyone somewhere
along the line.

Many people will say that Mr. Cad has no right to
to his popularity because he doesn't carry a message.
They call him a typical product of the lost genera
tion" with all his flippancy, his superficial gloss, and
his undeniable eye to the box-office. But we'd call
him a boy most likely to succeed come hell or
Communism.
