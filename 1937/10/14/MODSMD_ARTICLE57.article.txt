## ON SOPHOMORISH SOPHISM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since the admirable Cope has in
troduced "sweetness and light" into
the columns of Campus Opinion, it
is well that someone should grasp
the torch before it sputters out.
The particular sophism which I
have chosen to bathe in revealing
flame is the current and hackneyed
ballyhoo in behalf of "school spirit."
Commercial Football
Even the Daily has prostituted edi
torial space and time to furthering
this monstrous hoax: "Local soph
ists recommend that such nomencla
ture be omitted from the Stanford
vocabulary because it's juvenile,
high-schoolish, and awfully silly,
but have neglected to substitute oth
er words or actions for what to them
three years ago was 'big stuff'."
There has certainly been sufficient
dissemination of the facts concern
ing it to make even the most cred
ulous freshman aware that college
football has ceased to be anything
but a gigantic commercial enter
prise. . . .
If, conscious of these obvious facts,
our students continue to derive some
low form of sensual pleasure from
bleating their hearts out in the stands
or at the railroad station each week
end, they are the more to be wept
over. . . .
Wantedâ€”a Substitute
The Daily asks for a substitute.
All right, "... substitute a sense of
personal and inner worth for the
misery and emptiness that flung the
individual into blind group-action to
satisfy his primitive will to superi
ority and power." (For a fuller un
derstanding of the terms, "personal
and inner worth," I should suggest a
reading of Ludwig Lewisohn's "Up
stream," in which that sentence apr
peared.)
And finally, "... Loyalty to the
humblest truth a man has found for
himself is better than to cheer whole
acres of bunting or to wear a gaudy
ribbon in his coat (or to wave a
pom-pom or wear a rooter's cap)!"
