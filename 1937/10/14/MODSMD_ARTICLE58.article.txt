# IS AMERICANISM GOING?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is certainly a sign that Amer
icanism is flagging when the editor
of a paper in an American college
prints such a scurrilous letter as
that which appeared in the Stanford
Daily of October 11th.
No red-blooded American would
ever give the least bit of publicity to
such out-and-out trash. I read the
Daily quite regularly, and in recent
years I have noticed with alarm the
ever-increasing radicalism that has
been evidenced by student reporters
and columnists. It is hard for one to
tell whether this is an indication of
a general degredation of youth, or
whether new beliefs are slyly being
taught to the immature students by
a group of radical professors.
As for this Rodriguez, the writer of
the letter I mention above, he is a
dangerous alien who should be fer
retted out from his "cell" and de
ported. It is not generally realized
how menacing such agitators are to
law and order. Subtly boring from
within and working constantly to
subvert our American institutions,
which from the time immemorial
have stood as solid bulwarks against
Red radicalism, these "human ter
mites" have taken to indoctrinating
college boys and girls.
Although Mr. Cobbs discusses
these radicals with some saneness in
his column this morning, he shows
himself to be a mere tool in the hands
of radical professors when he makes
the indefensible statement that
"America is distinctly favorable to
the Loyalist cause." Apparently Mr.
Cobbs has not yet learned that the
so-called Loyalist government is
singing the "Internationale" right
along with Red Russia. Mr. Cobbs
should learn that what he calls
"Fascist sword-rattling" is at long
last bringing law and order to a
country which has been floundering
under visionary socialists.
We American taxpayers are not
going to stand for this growing
spirit of radicalism. Thank God we
still have such sane-thinking groups
as the American Legion and the

Daughters of the American Revolu
tion.
Very truly yours,
An American
