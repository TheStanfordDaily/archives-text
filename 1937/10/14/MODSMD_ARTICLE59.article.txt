# LIKES COWARD SERIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
To you of The Daily, this isn't just
another gripe, but just the expres
sion of a different opinion than that
held by Mr. Allen Dru,ry in regard
to Noel Coward's "Tonight at 8:30."
Mr. Drury probably was not in the
mood to enjoy these plays and think
highly of them when he saw them.
I attended the second series of these
plays last evening and enjoyed them
thoroughly.
Anyone who can see them will
certainly enjoy them and Mr. Drury
should be encouraging people to
attend rather than writing of them
in the discouraging manner of yes
terday's Daily. 1 thought the plays
well written, to the point, quite hu
morous, and the acting excellent. I
would say that anyone who wants a
highly enjoyable evening should at
tempt to see these plays.
Sincerely,
An Opinionated Student
