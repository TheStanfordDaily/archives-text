# 'Wee Willie' Brings Shirley Back to Paly
## 
### 
'Wee Willie Winkie," or "How
Shirley Saved the British Empire,"
has returned to Paly via the Varsity,
and may there be viewed by all who
have not already seen it, or who
wish to see it again (?).
Miss Temple, as her harassed em
ployers are constantly reminding
us, is getting on in years, inevi
tably reaching the point where life
is going to be a sad and serious
business. In line with thi.;, Mr.
Zanuck is trying to ease his No. 1
Box-Officer into parts more suited
to her advanced age; and "Wee
Willie Winkie" is the first step in
this direction.
Star Is Well Supported
That it is a fairly satisfying step
is due partly to its star, partly to
the production, and mainly to the
supporting cast, which includes such
reliables as C. Aubrey Smith, Victor
McLaglen, and Caesar Romero. June
Lang and Michael Whalen furnish
the love interest, capably on the part
of Mr. Whalen and with a perpetual
pout on the part of Miss Lang.
The sex of Mr. Kipling's hero has
been changed to correspond with
Miss Temple's own, and various lib
erties have also been taken with the
story. When Shirley's grandfather,
commander of a border station on
the edge of Kyber Pass, captures a
nasty native chieftain, Shirley finds
the chief's talisman in the dust and
returns it to him. Later this good
deed bears remarkable fruit, for the
chieftain agrees to talk things over
with Grandfather, the Empire is
saved one of those unpleasant messes
that look so bad in the headlines,
and everything turns out as cute as
pie.
Temple Scores
Miss Temple is her usual charm
ing self, to paraphrase Mary Living
ston, and she is firmly restrained
from cutting capers and singing
songs. Only once does melody get
the best of her, the occasion being
the death of Victor McLaglen, who
also does an excellent job as the
bluff Sergeant McDuff. A fairly
pleasing picture, not worth the
ballyhoo, but a capable time
passer. â€”A. S. D.
