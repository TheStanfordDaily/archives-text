# Olive Branch Extended By A.F.L. Group
## Green Re-named Leader; Conflab with C. I. O. Cheered by Meeting 
### 
DENVER, Oct. 14 (U.R). — The
American Federation of Labor
agreed tonight to meet the C.1.0. in
a "just and reasonable" conference
to make peace in a trades union
movement and then re-elected Pres
ident William Green to lead the
quest for amity.
Climaxing a tumultuous session,
the Federation convention in effect
offered to reverse its newly-adopted
fighting program and embark upon
an effort to "heal and adjust the
unfortunate breach caused in the
ranks of organized labor."
Officers Given Powers
Earlier in the day the delegates
had voted their officers vastly in
creased powers in order to allow
swift action in punishing any future
secessions similar to that of the John
L. Lewis group.
"I have faith and confidence that
calm reason around a conference
table will prevail," Green said as
the 57th annual convention touched
a swift climax.
"But if it does not, I will lead the
battle. I will be in front. We will
emerge united!"
Federation to Fight
"And if there is one who must
fall in the heat of battle, then let it
be me who goes down. But let the
ranks of labor remain intact!"
Thus Green, in one breath, tossed
to the rival John L. Lewis move
ment an offer of peace but called
upon the Federation to fight as it
never fought before if that offer is
refused.
Although Green had denounced
vehemently a "conditional" invita
tion from the Atlantic City C.1.0.
conference to negotiate through a
committee of 100 from each side, he
asked the convention today to ap
prove a reply agreeing to negotiate
through the A. F. of L. standing
committee of three or to enlarge that
committee to a "reasonable" extent.
