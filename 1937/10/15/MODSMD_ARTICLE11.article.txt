# Here's What Big-Wigs Say About Libe
## 
### 
Interviewed last night on the
question of whether or not having
the libe open Sunday nights would
be preferable to Friday nights, the
consensus of opinion among student
leaders almost unanimously favored
Sunday. They said:
Barbara Paine:
I think more people would go to
the Libe on Sunday night. Two to
five Sunday afternoon is decidedly
inadequate. If you're going to do
your studying for Monday, why npt
Sunday night.
Don Moulton:
I'd much rather have it open on
Sunday. I've tried it Friday and
after a hard week want to relax on
Friday. I'd be a lot more liable to
use it on Sunday than Friday.
Jackie Brown:
I think the results of the poll in
dicate the general feeling on the
campus. I would go occasionally on
Sunday, never on Fridays.
Sis Coon ley:
Who goes to the Libe Friday
night? That's what I want to know.
If I do on week-ends, I'll definitely
go Sunday in preference to Friday.
Art Stoefen:
Friday night is just as good as
Sunday.
Jean Reynolds:
I never would go on Friday night,
but I would go on Sunday.
Bob Mc√üosky:
I'd rather go on Sunday. I would
go twice as many times as on Friday.
