# Stick Until Christmas
## 
### 

FORTY-THREE anthracite miners sent up defiant word, from 1200 feet below in the Lehigh Navigation
Mine at Coaldale, Pa., that they would stay down until Christmas, if necessary, to obtain their wage demands.
Relatives and fellow-miners supply them with food, as above. This cable carries food, playing cardsâ€”and a
pair of white shoes!
