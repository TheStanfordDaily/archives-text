ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Oct 14
(U.R).â€”The offer of the American
Federation of Labor to confer with
a C. I. O. peace committee surprised
leaders of the Committee for In
dustrial Organization in conference
here tonight and they refused to
forecast the CJ.O. verdict.
The Federation's action, taken in
convention at Denver, came 48 hours
after the C.1.0. conference had
passed a resolution proposing a
conference of 200 A. F. of L. and
C.1.0. representatives.
