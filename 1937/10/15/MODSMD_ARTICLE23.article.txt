# Row Smiles As Rushing Begins Today
## New Rules Go in Effect As Frosh, Transfers Head for Fraternities 
### GEORGE VENESS 
Over 500 new men will head up the
Row this morning for their first ex
perience in the whys and where
fores of Greek life.
Sharp at 11:30 o'clock cars will
start carrying freshly burnished
frosh and anxious transfers from
various points of vantage around
Encina, and "the Big Oak in front of
the Libe."
Three Dates Today
Three dates are possible today,
including until 2 p.m., af
| ternoon of football or "bull" from 2
until 5 o'clock, and dinner from 6
o'clock until midnight. Tomorrow
two dates are available from 11:30
till 2 and 2 until 5. Frosh may ac
cept no more than two dates with
any one house during this period.
In response to several requests
concerning the manner of dress con
sidered proper for a rushee to wear,
the following consensus of opinion
has been garnered from various
Row authorities.
Customs
For lunch ordinary quad clothes
are the custom. Coats and ties are
commonly worn for all evening
functions. Regarding the afternoon
rushing period, it is advisable to
wear rather hardy garments to
withstand the possible depreciation
caused by football or volleyball
games.
Question has come from both Row
and frosh concerning the meaning
of the rushing rule which states that
"contact of an informal nature be
tween new lower-division men and
fraternity men is permissible."
Rules Told
Don Moulton, president of the
Interfraternity Council and Board,
interprets the rule by listing the
following salient points:
1. No more than three fraternity
men may contact a freshman outside
Encina.
2. They may not go to the resi
dence of any fraternity man (active
or alumnus) anywhere on the
campus.
3. Going to the Union or elsewhere
for refreshment is not permissible.
4. The time allowed for such con
tact is not stated but is left to the
discretion of the fraternity—with the
full understanding that any abuse of
privilege will be dealt with by the
Interfraternity Board.
5. All rushing rules must be fol
lowed explicitly: viz., "no off-campus
rushing."

rushing period, it is advisable to
wear rather hardy garments to
withstand the possible depreciation
caused by football or volleyball
games.
Question has come from both Row
and frosh concerning the meaning
of the rushing rule which states that
"contact of an informal nature be
tween new lower-division men and
fraternity men is permissible."
Rules Told
Don Moulton, president of the
Interfraternity Council and Board,
interprets the rule by listing the
following salient points:
1. No more than three fraternity
men may contact a freshman outside
Encina.
2. They may not go to the resi
dence of any fraternity man (active
or alumnus) anywhere on the
campus.
3. Going to the Union or elsewhere
for refreshment is not permissible.
4. The time allowed for such con
tact is not stated but is left to the
discretion of the fraternity—with the
full understanding that any abuse of
privilege will be dealt with by the
Interfraternity Board.
5. All rushing rules must be fol
lowed explicitly: viz., "no off-campus
rushing."
Over 500 new men will head up the
Row this morning for their first ex
perience in the whys and where
fores of Greek life.

start carrying freshly burnished

various points of vantage around

the Libe."
