The Editor, Sirrah! i
NOW THAT first issue of CHA
PARRAL has gone to pres6, and an- i
other moon will have waxed and j
waned before the next one will ap- !
pear to lend its cheery light to homes j
now darkened by the Stanford Daily.
That being the situation, the Old 1
Boy feels that, now or never, he must
state firmly and unequivocally his ;
opinion on the present controversy
over the policy of the Stanford Li- j
brary. Hence he is compelled to de-
scend to these dx - ab columns for ex- ;
pression.
Cause for Alarm
NOW THAT insufferable, con- J
ceited. blatant, entrenched attitude ;
of Mr. Nathan Van Patten is a cause
for considerable alarm. Whether or !
not the Library is open on Friday J
or Sunday nights will not seriously j
affect the great channels of world I
thought, or even disturb irreparably ,
the easy currents of Farm life.
It would be a convenience, nothing j
more. It would be a service which j
any business would render to its j
best and most numerous class of
customers, especially those who
consistently purchase $115 articles.
- Old Boy Worried
But it is not the immediate con- |
troversy that worries the Ancient ;
One almost to distraction. It is the |
fact that a high administrator of a i
great liberal institution of learning !
should make, and be allowed to per
sist in, the statement that "This Li- 1
brary is not run for the convenience
of undergraduates" and to blithely j
retort, when caught red-handed in !
with the pompous boast that
"I wouldn't be convinced even if !
petitions signed by every member of j
the faculty and every member of the \
student body were presented to me
saying that the Library would be
used on Sunday nights."
Such an exasperating stand serves
only to confirm the suspicion that
many hold that not only the Library,
but the entire University plant, "is
not being run for the convenience of
undergraduates."
Loves University
The Old Boy earnestly hopes that
such a suspicion is unfounded. Lov
ing his fine University as he does,
he has always contended that such
suspicions were poppycock, the
moans of professional complainers.
But this latest incident, coming from
such a high source, gives him pause.
The one way to smother the growth
of such a suspicion is to smother it
at birth.
The Ancient One hopes that those
who stand above Mr. Van Patten
will take cognizance of the problem
and, at the very least, take intelli
gent action in the interests of equity

and justice, as befits an enlightened
University.

The Editor, Sir:
In a school where science is sup
posed to take the place of guess
work, why don't we solve the Van
Patten vs. Stanford Daily contro
versy by cold statistics. Not with
Daily polls which may or may not
be padded, nor in the Van Patten
method of hard-headed stubborn
ness.
I suggest that the Libe be kept
open both Friday nights and Sun
day nights for a month or the rest of
the quarter with an NYA employee
stationed at the door both nights of
the week to tabulate the number of
persons who go in and out of the
Libe each night. This would settle
the old question for once and for
ever.

The Editor, Sir:
It is certainly a sign that Ameri
canism is flagging when the editor
of a paper in an American college
prints such a reactionary letter as
that which appeared in the Stanford
Daily of October 14. I refer to the
letter signed "An American." From
this I gathered that the writer was a
taxpayer, was red-blooded, and
views with alarm "the ever increas
ing radicalism." About the last, well
brother you just ain't seen nothing
yet it things don't get better.
Now I like taxpayers; I am not
like some who are fanatics and
object to taxpayers on the grounds
that they are gipping the rest of the
fwoLetariat. But I don't think that
just because they are taxpayers they
should butt in on others' opinions,
especially on no other grounds than
that they have been corrupted by
something foreign to our Heaven
sent institutions. Anyone who does
not like the way reform is going in
this country can go back to Adolf
and Benito where people seem to
relish the kind of law and order he
refers to.
At first I thought the letter was
a joke, and perhaps it would be
kinder if it could be treated that
way, but some people may take it
seriously, and as such it is a dan
gerous document. The kind of pa
triotism back of it is the uniformed
sort which encourages violence, war,
vigilantism, protection of special in
terests, everything contrary to the
original spirit of our institutions. I
am sorry that anyone can pay taxes
and hold such opinions.
Yours sincerely,
Willie
