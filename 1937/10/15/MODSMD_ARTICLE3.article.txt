WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (U.R). â€”
The National Labor Relations Board,
replying to labor criticism, said to
night it had "never entertained the
hope" it could satisfy warring labor
factions.
The Board's statement, a direct
answer to American Federation of
Labor charges that the Board favors
the Committee for Industrial Or
ganization, was released while the
C.1.0. in convention at Atlantic City
had under consideration a resolution
accusing the Board of leaning to
ward the Federation of Labor.
