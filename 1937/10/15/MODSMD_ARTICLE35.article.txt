# Fred Waring Rates Praise In Filmusical
## 
### 
'"Varsity Show" (at the Fox-
Stanford) will bore you to death
when Fred Waring and his Penn
sylvanians aren't performing their
specialties. It's an hour-and-a-half
film which, minus Dick Powell,
would have made a bang-up short
subject.
Waring's boys and girls—Rosemary
and Priscilla Lane, who are quite as
lovely to look at as they are to hear
—are collegians trying to put on a

colossal show
which, for rea
sons known only
to the gods at
Warner Brothers,
can't get along
without old grad
5 Dick.
J All the rigama
role necessary be
fore the plot lets
the show go on is
relieved only by
the passably-fun
ny antics of Ted
Healy. Mr. Powell

is quite the same Mr. Powell who's
so many musicals in the
past.
Johnny Davis alternates trumpet
wangling with scat-singing, and
Poley McClintick exercises his frog
voice enough to make the band's
appearances highly entertaining.
And there's another point, if
you've got the old RansohofT spirit
—the Waring bunch plays "Come
Join the Band" but forgets all about
the brothers across the Bay.
"Sophie Lang Goes West," I think
they call the second feature, smells
even without Dick Powell.
