AQUATIC FANS
IN FOR TREAT
Aquatic fans, or just sports fans
in general, will be treated to a
.super-special week-end dish in
water polo right here on the Farm.
There's no football game to offer
competition so a good-sized crowd
should jam the Encina Pools this
afternoon and tomorrow afternoon
to see Nort Thornton's 1937 Redskin
water polo machine tackle two of
the best club teams in the nation.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club,
national champs and Olympic
Games representatives, will be the
heavy favorites to win today but
Farm fans can look for the youth
ful Indian amphibians to put up a
real battle.
Several interesting angles present
themselves when Stanford lines up
against the southerners. O'Conner
and Daubenspeck are rated as Amer
ica's greatest forward combination
and are stars of four Olympic Games.
Coach Thornton bubbles over with
praise for his forwards, Johnny
Lamb and Captain Bill Hanna, who
he calls the coast's greatest collegiate
scoring combination. Whether they
are or not will be determined today
and tomorrow. At any rate, it should
be quite a scoring duel.
TEAMMATES GET
TOGETHER AGAIN
O'Conner, Daubenspeck, and Coach
Thornton all played on the same
high school team together. Dauben
speck was a veteran forward on the
Venice High outfit and O'Conner
and Thornton were newcomers to
the team as forward and goalie, re
spectively.
Later O'Conner and Thornton
played on the championship
teams here at Stanford.
Another interesting note will be
Thornton's style of play in the game
this afternoon. The Card coach
learned his system from the man who
Will be opposing his forces, Phil
Daubenspeck. Thornton's style of
play is to have his heaviest aces in
the hole in front of the enemy net.
This is where Lamb and Hanna will
be playing for the Indians. Accord
ing to Thornton, Stanford is the only
College team on the coast that uses
this system.
C AL USES DIFFERENT
SCORING SYSTEM
Thornton points out that the Cal
squads have always used compara
tively small forwards with plenty of
speed and a good shooting eye
jralher than size and sheer power
which has characterized Dauben-
Fpeck-inspired Stanford teams.
Incidentally, fans will be able to
see just how strong the conference
favored California Bears are in com
parison to Stanford's underdog team.
The southerners leave for Berkeley
immediately after the game to take
on the Bears tonight. The compara
tive scores here on the Farm and at
Berkeley will be interesting. It's a
cinch, however, that the L.A.A.C.
bunch will be stronger against the
Cards when they are fresh. Two
games within the space of five hours
is a big job to tackle, even for a
team that has gone to four Olym
piads.
ALAS, NO WILDMAN— '
SAVAGE DUEL
Herb Wildman, the nation's
greatest goalie, will be in the net
lor the club. Too bad Bob Sav
age of the Cards isn't on the first
team. A good angle could be
worked out of that—a savage hurl
ing shots at a wildman. I just had
to get that one in, somehow.
Oh, yes, and tomorrow afternoon
the Cards run up against the San
Francisco Olympic Club. The Club
will be cast in the role of slight
favorite but this one should be just
r.bout a toss-up. The Olympians
lost to California last week, 7-5.
It's this year or never for A1
Dowden's California Bears. If they
don't cop the conference title this

year I'm afraid they'll have to wait
for quite a spell. Six of Dowden's
starting team are seniors, as are
threa of the reserves. That means
that of the 14 men on the first two
teams at Berkeley this year, nine
will be lost by graduation.

AQUATIC FANS
IN FOR TREAT
Aquatic fans, or just sports fans
in general, will be treated to a
.super-special week-end dish in
water polo right here on the Farm.
There's no football game to offer
competition so a good-sized crowd
should jam the Encina Pools this
afternoon and tomorrow afternoon
to see Nort Thornton's 1937 Redskin
water polo machine tackle two of
the best club teams in the nation.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club,
national champs and Olympic
Games representatives, will be the
heavy favorites to win today but
Farm fans can look for the youth
ful Indian amphibians to put up a
real battle.
Several interesting angles present
themselves when Stanford lines up
against the southerners. O'Conner
and Daubenspeck are rated as Amer
ica's greatest forward combination
and are stars of four Olympic Games.
Coach Thornton bubbles over with
praise for his forwards, Johnny
Lamb and Captain Bill Hanna, who
he calls the coast's greatest collegiate
scoring combination. Whether they
are or not will be determined today
and tomorrow. At any rate, it should
be quite a scoring duel.
TEAMMATES GET
TOGETHER AGAIN
O'Conner, Daubenspeck, and Coach
Thornton all played on the same
high school team together. Dauben
speck was a veteran forward on the
Venice High outfit and O'Conner
and Thornton were newcomers to
the team as forward and goalie, re
spectively.
Later O'Conner and Thornton
played on the championship
teams here at Stanford.
Another interesting note will be
Thornton's style of play in the game
this afternoon. The Card coach
learned his system from the man who
Will be opposing his forces, Phil
Daubenspeck. Thornton's style of
play is to have his heaviest aces in
the hole in front of the enemy net.
This is where Lamb and Hanna will
be playing for the Indians. Accord
ing to Thornton, Stanford is the only
College team on the coast that uses
this system.
C AL USES DIFFERENT
SCORING SYSTEM
Thornton points out that the Cal
squads have always used compara
tively small forwards with plenty of
speed and a good shooting eye
jralher than size and sheer power
which has characterized Dauben-
Fpeck-inspired Stanford teams.
Incidentally, fans will be able to
see just how strong the conference
favored California Bears are in com
parison to Stanford's underdog team.
The southerners leave for Berkeley
immediately after the game to take
on the Bears tonight. The compara
tive scores here on the Farm and at
Berkeley will be interesting. It's a
cinch, however, that the L.A.A.C.
bunch will be stronger against the
Cards when they are fresh. Two
games within the space of five hours
is a big job to tackle, even for a
team that has gone to four Olym
piads.
ALAS, NO WILDMAN— '
SAVAGE DUEL
Herb Wildman, the nation's
greatest goalie, will be in the net
lor the club. Too bad Bob Sav
age of the Cards isn't on the first
team. A good angle could be
worked out of that—a savage hurl
ing shots at a wildman. I just had
to get that one in, somehow.
Oh, yes, and tomorrow afternoon
the Cards run up against the San
Francisco Olympic Club. The Club
will be cast in the role of slight
favorite but this one should be just
r.bout a toss-up. The Olympians
lost to California last week, 7-5.
It's this year or never for A1
Dowden's California Bears. If they
don't cop the conference title this

year I'm afraid they'll have to wait
for quite a spell. Six of Dowden's
starting team are seniors, as are
threa of the reserves. That means
that of the 14 men on the first two
teams at Berkeley this year, nine
will be lost by graduation.

AQUATIC FANS
IN FOR TREAT
Aquatic fans, or just sports fans
in general, will be treated to a
.super-special week-end dish in
water polo right here on the Farm.
There's no football game to offer
competition so a good-sized crowd
should jam the Encina Pools this
afternoon and tomorrow afternoon
to see Nort Thornton's 1937 Redskin
water polo machine tackle two of
the best club teams in the nation.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club,
national champs and Olympic
Games representatives, will be the
heavy favorites to win today but
Farm fans can look for the youth
ful Indian amphibians to put up a
real battle.
Several interesting angles present
themselves when Stanford lines up
against the southerners. O'Conner
and Daubenspeck are rated as Amer
ica's greatest forward combination
and are stars of four Olympic Games.
Coach Thornton bubbles over with
praise for his forwards, Johnny
Lamb and Captain Bill Hanna, who
he calls the coast's greatest collegiate
scoring combination. Whether they
are or not will be determined today
and tomorrow. At any rate, it should
be quite a scoring duel.
TEAMMATES GET
TOGETHER AGAIN
O'Conner, Daubenspeck, and Coach
Thornton all played on the same
high school team together. Dauben
speck was a veteran forward on the
Venice High outfit and O'Conner
and Thornton were newcomers to
the team as forward and goalie, re
spectively.
Later O'Conner and Thornton
played on the championship
teams here at Stanford.
Another interesting note will be
Thornton's style of play in the game
this afternoon. The Card coach
learned his system from the man who
Will be opposing his forces, Phil
Daubenspeck. Thornton's style of
play is to have his heaviest aces in
the hole in front of the enemy net.
This is where Lamb and Hanna will
be playing for the Indians. Accord
ing to Thornton, Stanford is the only
College team on the coast that uses
this system.
C AL USES DIFFERENT
SCORING SYSTEM
Thornton points out that the Cal
squads have always used compara
tively small forwards with plenty of
speed and a good shooting eye
jralher than size and sheer power
which has characterized Dauben-
Fpeck-inspired Stanford teams.
Incidentally, fans will be able to
see just how strong the conference
favored California Bears are in com
parison to Stanford's underdog team.
The southerners leave for Berkeley
immediately after the game to take
on the Bears tonight. The compara
tive scores here on the Farm and at
Berkeley will be interesting. It's a
cinch, however, that the L.A.A.C.
bunch will be stronger against the
Cards when they are fresh. Two
games within the space of five hours
is a big job to tackle, even for a
team that has gone to four Olym
piads.
ALAS, NO WILDMAN— '
SAVAGE DUEL
Herb Wildman, the nation's
greatest goalie, will be in the net
lor the club. Too bad Bob Sav
age of the Cards isn't on the first
team. A good angle could be
worked out of that—a savage hurl
ing shots at a wildman. I just had
to get that one in, somehow.
Oh, yes, and tomorrow afternoon
the Cards run up against the San
Francisco Olympic Club. The Club
will be cast in the role of slight
favorite but this one should be just
r.bout a toss-up. The Olympians
lost to California last week, 7-5.
It's this year or never for A1
Dowden's California Bears. If they
don't cop the conference title this

year I'm afraid they'll have to wait
for quite a spell. Six of Dowden's
starting team are seniors, as are
threa of the reserves. That means
that of the 14 men on the first two
teams at Berkeley this year, nine
will be lost by graduation.
