# Daily's Seers Replace Necks On Guillotine
## Prophets Guess Scores Of Saturday Games; Cal, U.S.C. Favored 
### 
Seein' as how tomorrow is Sat
tidy, which means that lots of foo
ball games are going to be played,
which means that lots of people are
going to want to know how these
games are going to come out so that
they can pay off the mortgage on ye
olde homestead by picking the win
ners, it's high time that the We-
Never-Miss Society gets to work.
So here we go again. Boy, are we
terrific! Why, we're getting so
much publicity that even the Ad
ministration, in the form of the
psych department, has noticed us.
Yeah man. We, readers, are going
to be the subject of Tuesday's
Abnormal Psych lecture. With col
ored moovees, too. Foo.
But our duty is our duty—even
though it does seem foo-tile at times
—and we gotta inform our public
where to lay their bets. So once
every week the sports staff gets to
gether—all at one time and in one
place—to dope 'em out. What's more,
we hit 'em every once in a while—
our average is still .GOO.
For the benefit of our dear Moth
ers, here are our names. Please
notify before you drop the guillo
time on our collective neck:
