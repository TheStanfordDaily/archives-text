The Stanford Indian's wettest ]
week-end in many a moon gets :
under way at 3:30 this afternoon in j
Encina pools.
Coach Nort Thornton of the Stan- j
ford squads announced both his var- |
sity and junior varsity teams ready j
for the invasion of the I-os Angeles j
and San Francisco clubs. The Comp- I
ton J.C. outfit itself will probably j
prove nt least a match for the Indian i
Jayvee. Originally scheduled to
play the varsity, the Compton team
had to be dropped to the semi-final
spot when the Los Angeles A.C.
game was made available to Thorn
ton's water-dogs.
Considerable interest is being
shown concerning the promised ap
pearance of Roy Winkleman, Stan
ford's diving ace, who will go

through all the motions during both
days' festivities. Winkleman, de
fending Coast champ and Card hope
in the next Olympic tryouts, is re
ported to look even better than
when he copped the title last spring.
Thornton gained hopes of victory
when his varsity finally overcame a
4-1 lead his Jayvee team, plus Don
Peterson of last year's team, rolled
up in scrimmage Wednesday after
noon.
Once it was dark, Harma, Lamb,
and their five proteges woke up and
started working with a coolness and
precision that should stand therh in
well if they don't bog down. Be
fore the scrimmage ended, the var
sity had chalked up eleven goals.
But the veteran All-Americans
from Los Angeles are expected to
prove much harder to stop than an
inexperienced junior varsity was.
The Olympic Club is reportedly
stronger than it has been for sev
eral years. Little is known about
Compton players except that they
are a first string outfit playing, a
second team.
The six All - Americans on the
squad that hasn't lost to an American
opponent in nine years will all be
back for the Mercuries. The Olym
pic Club has several men, including
Stanford's Don Peterson and a
couple from Cal, who will make
them potentially stronger than they
were last year.
The Olympic Club has yet to
defeat Thornton - coached Stanford
teams; Nort has thirteen consecutive
wins over the Winged "O." The best
that he can claim over the Los An
geles A.C. is a tie in regular time
in 1934; and no other American
club has ever done the same.
Thornton stood pat with the same
starting line-up which he named
yesterday. It included: Bill Hanna,
sprint; Bob Plate and Johnny Lamb,
forwards; Jack Vibert, center back;
Harvey Rothschild and Bob Allen,
guards.
All the games are free to students
with A.S.S.U. cards.

ported to look even better than
when he copped the title last spring.
Thornton gained hopes of victory
when his varsity finally overcame a
4-1 lead his Jayvee team, plus Don
Peterson of last year's team, rolled
up in scrimmage Wednesday after
noon.
Once it was dark, Harma, Lamb,
and their five proteges woke up and
started working with a coolness and
precision that should stand therh in
well if they don't bog down. Be
fore the scrimmage ended, the var
sity had chalked up eleven goals.
But the veteran All-Americans
from Los Angeles are expected to
prove much harder to stop than an
inexperienced junior varsity was.
The Olympic Club is reportedly
stronger than it has been for sev
eral years. Little is known about
Compton players except that they
are a first string outfit playing, a
second team.
The six All - Americans on the
squad that hasn't lost to an American
opponent in nine years will all be
back for the Mercuries. The Olym
pic Club has several men, including
Stanford's Don Peterson and a
couple from Cal, who will make
them potentially stronger than they
were last year.
The Olympic Club has yet to
defeat Thornton - coached Stanford
teams; Nort has thirteen consecutive
wins over the Winged "O." The best
that he can claim over the Los An
geles A.C. is a tie in regular time
in 1934; and no other American
club has ever done the same.
Thornton stood pat with the same
starting line-up which he named
yesterday. It included: Bill Hanna,
sprint; Bob Plate and Johnny Lamb,
forwards; Jack Vibert, center back;
Harvey Rothschild and Bob Allen,
guards.
All the games are free to students
with A.S.S.U. cards.

Coach Nort Thornton of the Stan- j

sity and junior varsity teams ready j
for the invasion of the I-os Angeles j

play the varsity, the Compton team
had to be dropped to the semi-final

Considerable interest is being
