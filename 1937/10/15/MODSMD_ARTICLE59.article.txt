# They'll Be Together Soon

SOMETIME next week these
three Indian gridders may be
practicing again together for the
Washington game. Ed Garnier,
upper left, is just returning to work
after a lay-off because of injury.
Irv Cummings, upper right, end,
has been out this week because of
illness, while Jimmy Coffis, fiery
left half, has escaped both injury
and illness.
