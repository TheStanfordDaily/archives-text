# Grid Teams To Take Week-end Breathers
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
And so comes the week when all good little footballers must rest their
little tootsies, throwing arms, and sundry equipment for the long runway to
the season's wind-up. Why? Oh, there's gotta be a chance for the lioys
to ease ofT sometime. Of course, Cal's first string has been doing it every
week-end, but maybe they need it.

Speaking of Califoo-nia, it mighty
as well be put down right here and
now—for posterity, if you like—that |
those big, brave Bears are going to
play a double-header this week-end.
The victims being dragged up for the
slaughter are the Cal Aggies and
College of the Pacific. Take it easy,
Mr. Allison.
U.S.C. Trek North
Since we've started with a couple
of pushovers, we might as well go
ahead in that order, and save the one
tough game for last—at least they all
seem to be pushovers.
U.S.C. takes on Oregon, and, after
last week's terrific upset win over
Ohio State, the Trojans ought to be
able to.' do anything. Even beat
Oregon, maybe — three touchdowns,
according to the crystal casaba.
And then there's Washington,
who, like Ohio State, took a beating
last week via the all-of-a-sudden
we-lose route. Oregon State did the
slapping down by a 6-3 count. The
Huskies this week oughta be mad
enough to take any team for a five
touchdown wrn. Seem' as how
they're playing Washington State
they shouldn't have to get very mad
to take a three-touchdown decision,
which is just about all they will be
able to score.
Gaels Go South
The Galloping Gentlemen from St.
Mary's, who have finally gotten up
steam, trek south for what might
turn into a real game. Tom Lieb's
Loyola Lions, who have taken on
one of the toughest schedules on the
coast, will play host to the Moragans.
Incidentally, they hope to act as no
host should act, in that they plan to
send the visitors right back home
without the proverbial bacon.
Although chances are very good
for a two-touchdown St. Mai-y's
win, ya never can tell what's going
to happen when the Lions start to
roar.
Santa Clara will hang on to its un
beaten status and once more prove
its potency, this time against Port
land University. A four-touchdown
win is a safe bet. The Dons from
U.S.F. will spend their week-end in
Butte having a good time, a rest,
and a win over Montana by two
scores.
Week's toughest game will be the

U.C.L.A.-Oregon State- battle. The
Bruins, tabbed by many prognosti
cators to be right in there when the
gravy is handed out at the end of
Ihe season, were doing all right until
they ran into a combination cyclone,
typhoon, and hurricane on the Farm
last week.
Oregon State, with its ace, Joe
Gray, seems to have the capacity to
lose when least expected, and win
likewise. Witness their loss to Idaho
1 and win over Washington. With this
| uncalculable ingredient constantly
driving opposing teams a wee bit
wacky, there's no telling what might
happen. It'll be one touchdown,
either way, with the arrow pointing
ever-so-slightly toward El Bx*uin.
Though those first games might
| put you to sleep, flip on the radio for
the Bruin-Webfoot tussle—it'll be
| worth it.

Ohio State, the Trojans ought to be
able to.' do anything. Even beat
Oregon, maybe — three touchdowns,
according to the crystal casaba.
And then there's Washington,
who, like Ohio State, took a beating
last week via the all-of-a-sudden
we-lose route. Oregon State did the
slapping down by a 6-3 count. The
Huskies this week oughta be mad
enough to take any team for a five
touchdown wrn. Seem' as how
they're playing Washington State
they shouldn't have to get very mad
to take a three-touchdown decision,
which is just about all they will be
able to score.
Gaels Go South
The Galloping Gentlemen from St.
Mary's, who have finally gotten up
steam, trek south for what might
turn into a real game. Tom Lieb's
Loyola Lions, who have taken on
one of the toughest schedules on the
coast, will play host to the Moragans.
Incidentally, they hope to act as no
host should act, in that they plan to
send the visitors right back home
without the proverbial bacon.
Although chances are very good
for a two-touchdown St. Mai-y's
win, ya never can tell what's going
to happen when the Lions start to
roar.
Santa Clara will hang on to its un
beaten status and once more prove
its potency, this time against Port
land University. A four-touchdown
win is a safe bet. The Dons from
U.S.F. will spend their week-end in
Butte having a good time, a rest,
and a win over Montana by two
scores.
Week's toughest game will be the

U.C.L.A.-Oregon State- battle. The
Bruins, tabbed by many prognosti
cators to be right in there when the
gravy is handed out at the end of
Ihe season, were doing all right until
they ran into a combination cyclone,
typhoon, and hurricane on the Farm
last week.
Oregon State, with its ace, Joe
Gray, seems to have the capacity to
lose when least expected, and win
likewise. Witness their loss to Idaho
1 and win over Washington. With this
| uncalculable ingredient constantly
driving opposing teams a wee bit
wacky, there's no telling what might
happen. It'll be one touchdown,
either way, with the arrow pointing
ever-so-slightly toward El Bx*uin.
Though those first games might
| put you to sleep, flip on the radio for
the Bruin-Webfoot tussle—it'll be
| worth it.

And so comes the week when all good little footballers must rest their
little tootsies, throwing arms, and sundry equipment for the long runway to
the season's wind-up. Why? Oh, there's gotta be a chance for the lioys
to ease ofT sometime. Of course, Cal's first string has been doing it every

Although chances are very good
for a two-touchdown St. Mai-y's
win, ya never can tell what's going
to happen when the Lions start to
roar.
Santa Clara will hang on to its un
beaten status and once more prove
its potency, this time against Port
land University. A four-touchdown
win is a safe bet. The Dons from
U.S.F. will spend their week-end in
Butte having a good time, a rest,
and a win over Montana by two
scores.
Week's toughest game will be the

U.C.L.A.-Oregon State- battle. The
Bruins, tabbed by many prognosti
cators to be right in there when the
gravy is handed out at the end of
Ihe season, were doing all right until
they ran into a combination cyclone,
typhoon, and hurricane on the Farm
last week.
Oregon State, with its ace, Joe
Gray, seems to have the capacity to
lose when least expected, and win
likewise. Witness their loss to Idaho
1 and win over Washington. With this
| uncalculable ingredient constantly
driving opposing teams a wee bit
wacky, there's no telling what might
happen. It'll be one touchdown,
either way, with the arrow pointing
ever-so-slightly toward El Bx*uin.
Though those first games might
| put you to sleep, flip on the radio for
the Bruin-Webfoot tussle—it'll be
| worth it.
SANTA MARIA, Oct. 14 (U.R).—
| Albert H. Clark, of Fresno, today
was elected Grand Junior Warden
of the Gland Encampment of the
! Independent Order of Oddfellows.
