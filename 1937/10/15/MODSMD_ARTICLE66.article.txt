## Into the Stretch with the Libe Lament 
### 
OUT of the haze of opinions, cross-opinions,
alibis, gripes, requests, denials, accusa
tions, and all the rest that has gone to make up a
very nice ripe library dispute, finally emerges
something tjiat looks as though it will fan away
the mist and leave Stanford's library doors ajar
on some Sunday evening soon.
The breeze which may freshen the air around
the whole problem will be churned up by the
somewhat complicated machinery that the As
sociated Students set up for action in cases of
this sort—the A.S.S.U. Ex Committee.
President of that body, Tom Killefer, last
night expressed his desire to back The Daily
in its move to rid the campus not only of a pet
editorial peeve, but to settle once and for all a
problem which has caused recurring thunder
among undergraduate library users.
Finally this traditional beef will get the official

action for which it has long been starved, and
when Ex Committee sanctions Killefer to bite
into the situation, official negotiations may be
carried on with Director Nathan Van Patten in
the carrying out of a definite and final poll of
student opinion on the matter.
So far Mr. Van Patten has stolidly refused to
believe that his week-end hours are anything
but what the campus wants; despite Daily polls,
pictorial proof, and studert request spread over
a period of nearly three
But the student body machinery, for which
this publication is official organ, should be able
to turn enough wheels to actually close the
issue one way or another, and that in itself,
regardless of the decision, would be a welcome
relief for Dr. Wilbur, Mr. Nathan Van Patten,
The Daily, and a lot of other people—to whom
three years of fussing is too much.
