# After This the Deluge
## 
### 
STUDENT ticket sale for the U.S.C. game starts
today and closes Tuesday. Student griping
over the student ticket sale will start Wednes
day and continue indefinitely.
Big game for the gripers and snipers is the
B.A.C. Annually Don Liebendorfer has to de
fend himself with a statement that goes some
thing like this: Student seats are in the center
of the field. They must be allotted first, or the
preferred cash customers will find themselves
just south of a fine expanse of empty seats.
To save Mr. Liebendorfer the trouble of mak
ing the statement, and to try to hit the problem
before it becomes a problem, The Daily will
experiment this year with certain, certified, and
recurrent notices of the sale, while it lasts.
The notice of the sale will appear in a box
in the football story of the day. The story may
appear on the sports page or on the front page,
but the sale box will be in it as long as the sale
lasts.
Ticket sale for the U.S.C. game starts Satur
day; The Daily will be happy if the B.A.C. is out
of the trenches before Christmas. â€”L. L.
