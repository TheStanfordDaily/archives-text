# Before the Horse Is Stolen

TRADITIONALLY at Stanford a book left on a
window ledge on the Quad at the start of the
guarter will still be there when the guarter ends.
Fraternities match this with a tradition of their

own—that they can throw the key away when
they build the house and nothing v/ill be stolen.
Call the first honesty, but not the second.
Fraternities prefer the word hospitality for their
custom. Some houses pride themselves that
every room door is unlocked; a locked door
invites a battering ram. Others merely boast
that the front doorbell has been out of order
for the last 20 years.
But leave the book on the Quad often enough
and it will be missing eventually, and some
times fraternity hospitality is misused.
Robbed Row men appeal to campus police
sometimes, but police have gotten to the shoul
der-shrugging stage. House presidents grouse
at Interfraternity Council meetings, but have
decided on no collective action until this year.
The new regulation leaves out mention of
locked doors, requires that strangers found in
houses be challenged and reported. But the
technological progress of crime is still one jump
ahead; the latest robberies at Stanford were
done during a football game when there would
be no one around to do the challenging.
This is not to advocate locking fraternity
doors. But it is to warn against what will un
doubtedly occur, and to suggest that scream
ing not done now should also be stifled after
the horse is stolen.
