OUIt FERRET GODFATHER
Dear "American":
r pHE other day you wrote a letter to the editor; and
it appears that like Jose Rodriguez, you curl up
with a dime novel whenever affairs of state aren t
keeping you busy. You began by damning Rodriguez
for his "scurrilous" letter (I thought we lost that word
in France during the war). And you wound up by
thanking God for the American Legion and the DA.R.
The whole thing sounds like a good joke without
any last line. But you didn't label it "gag" or "frame
up" and so we have no way of telling what it is. At
that, I won't contest your blessing on the American
Legion; and if Comrade Rodriguez will write letters
he'll have to get used to a good damning now and
then. But you made one remark that tags you out
at first base.
* * * *
CANDWICHED in between your pious gratitude for
the Legion, and your plans for "ferreting" out
communists, were two searing references to our "rad
ical" professors. 1 have no doubt but that the poor
communists are now cringing in their cellars, or pric
ing tickets to Moscow; but I don't imagine that any
Stanford professors will slink off to their offices and
brood upon the perils that beset a radical.
In fact, dear American, I would like to make you a
sporting proposition. Some day when the ferreting
is not so good in your own bailiwick, drop down here
and throw out the drag net for radical professors. For
every one you bring in, I'll give you a day on this
column. You can print the minutes of the American
Legion, or the resolutions of the DA.R.
* * >i« *
r J I HINKING it over, though, I realize that I'm not
offering you a very sporting bet, after all. There
isn't even one radical professor here; the only red
things at Stanford are the tile roofs and the fire en
gines. If you don't believe it, take a look at the list of
graduates. There's not one commissar in the bunch;
and if all our rabble-rousing alumni were laid end to
end, they would still fit, in a single bed.
If a "group of radical professors" are out to dis
tort, the minds of our "immature youth" they are cer
tainly chiseling the Soviet out of a lot of roubles.
Naturally, our courses discuss communism, and
fascism, and anarchism. This Is a university, not a
kindergarten. All political and social doctrines, radical,
reactionary, and fence-straddling, are presented to us
for consideration. And the professors point out, the
good and bad points of each. But you could question
.students until you lost your voice, and you could
sit in classes until your beard grew out into the
aisle; you still wouldn't find any professor presenting
"radical" doctrines in any spirit but impartial criticism.
♦ * * *
come to Stanford to learn. We want to
K find out about communism, and all of the other
can't-say-the-naughty-words that were shush-shushed
in high school. Wo don't want to be indoctrinated with
a sweet "All is for the best in this best of all possible
worlds," any more than we want to be indoctrinated
with any radical creed.
The character and opinions of professors is reflected
in their students. How many radical students can you
find at Stanford?
* * ♦ *
I in any day, dear American, and see for your
self. But I warn you it will be discouraging. You
could put in your time much more profitably blessing
the Americati Legion.
Sorry I have to close now. but must run up to the
Post Oflice and get my check from Moscow.

Dear "American":
r pHE other day you wrote a letter to the editor; and
it appears that like Jose Rodriguez, you curl up
with a dime novel whenever affairs of state aren t
keeping you busy. You began by damning Rodriguez
for his "scurrilous" letter (I thought we lost that word
in France during the war). And you wound up by
thanking God for the American Legion and the DA.R.
The whole thing sounds like a good joke without
any last line. But you didn't label it "gag" or "frame
up" and so we have no way of telling what it is. At
that, I won't contest your blessing on the American
Legion; and if Comrade Rodriguez will write letters
he'll have to get used to a good damning now and
then. But you made one remark that tags you out
at first base.
* * * *
CANDWICHED in between your pious gratitude for
the Legion, and your plans for "ferreting" out
communists, were two searing references to our "rad
ical" professors. 1 have no doubt but that the poor
communists are now cringing in their cellars, or pric
ing tickets to Moscow; but I don't imagine that any
Stanford professors will slink off to their offices and
brood upon the perils that beset a radical.
In fact, dear American, I would like to make you a
sporting proposition. Some day when the ferreting
is not so good in your own bailiwick, drop down here
and throw out the drag net for radical professors. For
every one you bring in, I'll give you a day on this
column. You can print the minutes of the American
Legion, or the resolutions of the DA.R.
* * >i« *

offering you a very sporting bet, after all. There
isn't even one radical professor here; the only red
things at Stanford are the tile roofs and the fire en
gines. If you don't believe it, take a look at the list of
