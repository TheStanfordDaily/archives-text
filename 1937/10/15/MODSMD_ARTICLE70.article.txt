Whether or not modern intellectuals are suffer
ing from anemia as was challenged by a Minne
sota Daily editorial writer, is debatable, but that
sex is no longer considered "SEX" by today's col
legiate thinker is a truism. Thus a simple typo
graphical change seems to mark a complex revi

SEX! ON THE DECLINE.
BECOMES INARTICULATE
Perhaps intellectuals nowadays are an anemic lot,
but there was a time not so very long ago when the
word "sex," spelled "SEX!" meant not only a pretty
girl in a bathing suit but also a serious absent minded
gentleman with horn-rimmed glasses and a book under
his arm.
And what a book! Need we remind you of such
magic names as "Jurgen," "Janet March," "Three
Weeks"? And of "Ulysses," when that name meant se
cretly enjoyed licentiousness instead of ihree cents a
day at the rental bookstore?
But we seem to have traveled from the Age of
Sophistication back to the Age of Innocence, verbally
at least. Whether it, is our writers or our censors who
are at fault, we have no more forbidden masterpieces.
Havelock Ellis' morals no longer demoralize us; his
only utterances are reiterations. Sigmund Freud has
become respectable; his autobiography reveals not the
seductive sexuality of our own unconscious lives but
the quiet decency of Mr. Freud's own existence.
And now "Life" discovers that what college students
used variously to call "spooning," "necking" and "pet
ting" no longer has any distinctive title. The practice
remains, but not the label.
Sex has become once again unverbalized behavior.
There is no dearth of sex—apparently it is here to stay
■ —but sex, spelled 'SEX!" is on the wane.
