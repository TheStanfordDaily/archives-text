# Ex Committee Plans Probe of Libe Hours
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
"We're going to get to the root of this library matter and iron it out for
once and for all."
With this statement yesterday Tom Killefer, A.S.S.U. president, ex
pressed his decision to bring The Daily's proposals for opening the Stanford

library on Sunday nights to the at-<
tention of Ex Committee at its meet- |
ing next Tuesday night.
Killefer and Barbara Murphy,
student body vice-president, stated
at a conference last night with Gordy
Frost, editor of The Daily, that it is
the business of the A.S.S.U. to see
what can be done in the matter.
Action Told
Nathan Van Patten, director of the
library, on Sunday criticized The
Daily's recent poll on library hours
as "not representative," and sug
gested that Ex Committee should
determine actual student opinion on
the question.
Probable action which Ex Com
mittee will adopt at its meeting
early next week, Killefer indicated
yesterday, will be to appoint a com
mittee to confer with Van Patten
on possibilities to hold a general
student poll on proposals to have
the library open regularly on Sun
day nights.
Officer Comments
Miss Murphy expressed the opin
ion yesterday that "the great ma
jority of undergraduate students
would prefer that the library be
open on Sunday nights."
By determining the actual num
ber of students who would use the
library Sunday nights, Ex Commit
tee, Killefer said, will be able to
have concrete information for bas
ing a future policy.
