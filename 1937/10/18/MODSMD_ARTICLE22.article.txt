### BERT ALWARD 
For the usual 15 cents plus one
cent tax, Chaparral, campus humor
publication, will go on sale at the
English, Biology, and Engineering
corners day after tomorrow morning
in the hands of numerous beautiful
salesgirls.
It is the pleasure of Bob Hart
mann, editor, and Foster Markolf,
business manager, to announce that
this, their first issue, is also the
largest Chappie ever published.
'Better-than-Ever'
According to early reports, it will
be filled with 48 pages of better
than-ever gags, cartoons, and ar
ticles, done by both old and new
members of the staff.
Old Boy Hartmann will take the
lead himself in a series of humorous !
and important "Now Thats" on all
manner of campus questions in the |
customary sage manner of all former |
and future Now Thaters, or editors, |
as Stanford familiarly calls them.
Supplementing such former fa

vorites as "Little Pop Off" and
"Fables of the Farm" will be Art
Levinson's clever "Modern Mother
Goose," a new feature.
Freshman Thinks!
New to the staff are Freshmen A1
Zelver and Sherman Mellinkoff, the
former lambasting Hollywood in his
column, "Smouldering in the Bal
cony," and the latter writing a apra
doxical poem entitled "Thoughts of
a Freshman."
Now renowned on the campus,
Sister McGonigle will continue to
unravel the tangled yarns of sorority
life and give advice to rushing-wom
Robleites.
Staff, Size Bigger
For 39 years. Chaparral has been
one of the foremost college maga
zines in the country,, This year will
be no exception, with new typog
raphy, increased size, new enthus
iasm, and an increased staff, accord
ing to Old Boy Hartmann.
Subscriptions are still available
at the business office, at the bargain
counter price of $1.03.
