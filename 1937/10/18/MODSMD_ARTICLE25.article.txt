# Labor Diplomats To Discuss Truce
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 (UP). â€”
Warring factions of organized labor
ceased hostilities temporarily to
night while chosen "diplomats' from
each side prepared to open negotia
tions October 25 aimed at producing
peace or an armed tx-uce between the
American Federation of Labor and
the Committee for Industrial Organ
ization.
When their representatives meet
around a council table in the nation's
capital a week from tomorrow they
will make a final attempt to find a
common set of principles on which
those who favor organization by
crafts can reunite with proponents
of the "one big union" idea so that
nearly 8.000,000 working men and
women may put their combined eco
nomic and political pressure behind
the drive for better laboring condi
tions.
Labor observers believed that if
the negotiators fail to achieve either
lasting peace or an armed truce the
conference will result in an attempt
by each side to place the blame on
its rival for the great schism in the
labor movement.
