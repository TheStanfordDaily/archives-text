# Paris Demand Complicates Spanish Crisis
## Request by France May Block Demobilization Of Spain's Volunteers 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 17 (UP). —France
sent the Spanish "volunteers" crisis
toward a dangerous deadlock tonight
by insisting that Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco demobilize at least four
of his mercenary insurgent soldiers
for every man withdrawn from the
Loyalist ranks.
The French ambassador to Lon
don, Andre Charles Corbin, received
curt orders from Paris to "stand by
his guns" against the Nazi-Fascist
bloc when the London non-inter
vention committee meets again
Tuesday.
Bargain Sought
The neutrality body of 27 nations
is attempting, through its chairman's
sub-committee of nine powers, to
lind the basis of a bargain whereby
Italy will call home her thousands
of black-shirt legionnaires serving
with Franco's insurgents.
At yesterday's meeting of the sub
committee the Italian ambassador,
Dino Grandi, announced that Italy
agreed to a "symbolic" withdrawal
of her blackshirts, providing Franco
is granted belligerent rights and an
equal withdrawal is made from the
Loyalist forces.
Five-Point Program
Grandi demanded "equal with
drawals" while Corbin, placing be
fore the nine-power consultations a
live-point Franco-British program,
said the withdrawals must be "pro
portionate."
France wants the "token" with
drawal of Italian legionnaires to be
one of at least 5000; Britain indi
cated she might consider a recall of
500 to be sufficient evidence of Pre
mier Benito Mussolini's good faith.
