# China Claims Isolation Of Japanese Rear Line
## 'Red Army' Cracks Down Oil Northwest Front 
### 
SHANGHAI, Mon., Oct. 18 (UP).
—The Japanese today appeared to
have suffered their severest reverses
of the Chinese war in the northwest
campaign where "flying columns" of
Chu Teh, China's famed "Red Napo
leon," reportedly had cut through
their rear guard and isolated three
divisions.
Japanese deprecated the report,
pointing out that even if it were true,
Japanese advances in Hopei, where
they have penetrated to within 60
miles of the Honan border, would
counteract reverses in Shansi to the
west, making it impossible for Chi
nese to hold out any length of time.
Nevertheless, reports from both
sides indicated the veteran Eighth
Route Army, composed of campaign
ers of the old "red army" and crack
Nanking troops, had put a crimp in
the general northwest campaign and
made it necessary for the Japanese
to rush reinforcements.
Chinese sources said Chu Teh had
not only endangered the badly
stretched Japanese line of communi
cations into Shansi from the north,
striking at" the vital Ycnmen Pass
which controls the north - south
movement of troops in that area, but
also had smashed the Japanese back
at the Great Wall pass at Ningatze,
where a column from Hopei was
driving westward toward Taiyuan-
Fu, the Shansi capital. ,
