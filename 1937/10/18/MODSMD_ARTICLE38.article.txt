# Swent by Car, Came Home Via The Milky Way
## 
### 
Lang Swent came home in a milk
wagon the other morning.
Up the highway for an evening's
extra-curricular activity, the Daily
business manager returned to his
car to find that someone had taken
the keys.
Swent fiddled with wires, raised
and lowered the hood, but no spark.
It was three o'clock when a benevo
lent milk man picked him up and
brought him back to the campus.

Sugar cane, now rivaled by sugar
beets, was for centuries the only
source of commercial sugar.
