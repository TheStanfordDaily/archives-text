# Franco Batters on Defenders
## 
### 
MADRID, Oct. 17 (UP). â€” The
Loyalist war office said tonight that
the Asturian defenders of Gijon were
retreating in "orderly manner" in
the face of a furious mountain as
sault that carried Generalissimo
Franco's rebels almost to the gates
of Villaviciosa.
The rebels under General Jose
Fidel Davila were within 12 miles '
of Villaviciosa and only 25 miles
(from Gijon itself after battering
down a Loyalist stand in Soevo Pass ,
of the Cantabrian mountains.
If Villaviciosa falls to Franco he
will have virtually a clean sweep
along the broad Ribadesella highway
into Gijon.
An artillery and aerial bombard
ment extending far behind the bat- !
tie line, preceded the mass attack of
Davila's monarchist Requetes and
foreign legionnaires. Tanks flanked 1
the assault, in which both sides suf
fered heavy losses.
