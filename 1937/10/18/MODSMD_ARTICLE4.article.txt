# LIBE WAS OPEN-BUT VERY BARE
## 
### 
Stanford's library was open Fri
day night, but if figures tell truths
—it was not too popular.
Inquisitive reporters checked on
Friday night library users, found
them few and well spaced. Between
6 and 10 o'clock 25 to 30 students
filed in, signed out books, and went
home. Others straggled in to use
less than a hundred books from the
reserved book room during the
course of the evening.
Week-day figures show an aver
age of 100 books taken out, 350
used.
Meanwhile Wednofcday's Daily
poll quizzed only 10 per cent of the
student body, of which 270 asserted
that they would use the library
often on Sunday nights.
