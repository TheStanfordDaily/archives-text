CARD WATER DOG
HOPES DIMMED
Stanford's varsity water poloists
dropped a couple of encounters to
topnotch club teams over the week
end and just about dropped them
selves from consideration in the
coming Pacific Coast Conference
title chase.
Card aquatic fans were treated to
the sight of a national championship
septet Friday afternoon when the
Los Angeles Athletic Club trounced
the Indians, 9-4. Saturday afternoon
the Olympic Club came down from
San Francisco to give the Farm water
dogs a little lesson in the gentle art
of legalized murder, tripping the
Cards, 6-5.
Cal already has its wonder team
of football this year, but now the
denizens of the Berkeley hills can
rave about a wonder team of the
water. The Bears took on the
L.A.A.C. Friday night and whip
ped the team, 5-4.
Card Coach Nort Thornton,
hack from witnessing the stun
ning upset, claimed Cal has the
best team in America today, col
lege or otherwise.
LET'S TAKE A
CLOSER LOOK
It's the first time in nine years of
continual playing that the southern
club has been beaten by an Amer
ican team. On the face of it, it
looks as if the Bears are going to
shellack the Indians in the annual
two-game series this year, but let's
look at the situation a little closer.
The L.A.A.C. had just been given
a tough run by Stanford fivt? hours
before they took the water against
Cal. That means something. No
matter how good a team is, there's
going to be a weakening somewhere
when it plays its second game a few
hours after the first one.
That doesn't make the Indian am
phibians look quite so bad. And
here's another angle—Tom Whitaker
refereed the Berkeley game and
Jim Eva was calling them here on
the Farm. So what, you'll say.
Here's what—Cal plays an extremely
close guarding game that amounts to
illegal holding and Whitaker is a
liberal ref who allows a lot of that
sort of stuff. On the other hand,
Eva is on the other side of the fence
and calls everything.
CAL'S STILL TIIE
TEAM TO BEAT
The Bears simply clung right onto
Phil Daubenspeck and Wally O'Con
ner, Club aces, and the Olympic
Games veterans didn't get their
noses above water half the time.
These facts do take something
away from Cal's upset victory, but
still the Bears have the wonder
team this year and it's going to
take a highly improved Stanford
team to beat them.
Incidentally, Whitaker is refing
both games of the Stanford-Cal aqua
feuding this year, so maybe the In
dians will have to change their tac
tics and make their fouls a little less
obvious. The Farm natators were
having fouls called right and left in
the two week-end games.
BRUINS FIGURED
FOR SECOND
Right now it looks like the strong
U.C.L.A. squad is figured for second
place behind Cal. The Bruins held
the L.A.A.C. to a 5-2 score down
south. Another Card-Cal compari
son is the Bears' 7-5 win over the
Olympic Club.
The Frisco water dogs ran up a
5-2 half-time score on the Cards
Saturday hut Nort's team really
played hall in the second half,
outscoring the Clubmen 3-1.
As far as scoring power is con
cerned, I believe Stanford has it all
over U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., and is just
below the Cal squad. But the Cardi
nal defense is the weak spot that
may relegate a Stanford water polo
team to the hitherto unheard of
spot of third place in conference
play.

LET'S TAKE A
CLOSER LOOK
It's the first time in nine years of
continual playing that the southern
club has been beaten by an Amer
ican team. On the face of it, it
looks as if the Bears are going to
shellack the Indians in the annual
two-game series this year, but let's
look at the situation a little closer.
The L.A.A.C. had just been given
a tough run by Stanford fivt? hours
before they took the water against
Cal. That means something. No
matter how good a team is, there's
going to be a weakening somewhere
when it plays its second game a few
hours after the first one.
That doesn't make the Indian am
phibians look quite so bad. And
here's another angle—Tom Whitaker
refereed the Berkeley game and
Jim Eva was calling them here on
the Farm. So what, you'll say.
Here's what—Cal plays an extremely
close guarding game that amounts to
illegal holding and Whitaker is a
liberal ref who allows a lot of that
sort of stuff. On the other hand,
Eva is on the other side of the fence
and calls everything.
CAL'S STILL TIIE
TEAM TO BEAT
The Bears simply clung right onto
Phil Daubenspeck and Wally O'Con
ner, Club aces, and the Olympic
Games veterans didn't get their
noses above water half the time.
These facts do take something
away from Cal's upset victory, but
still the Bears have the wonder
team this year and it's going to
take a highly improved Stanford
team to beat them.
Incidentally, Whitaker is refing
both games of the Stanford-Cal aqua
feuding this year, so maybe the In
dians will have to change their tac
tics and make their fouls a little less
obvious. The Farm natators were
having fouls called right and left in
the two week-end games.
BRUINS FIGURED
FOR SECOND
Right now it looks like the strong
U.C.L.A. squad is figured for second
place behind Cal. The Bruins held
the L.A.A.C. to a 5-2 score down
south. Another Card-Cal compari
son is the Bears' 7-5 win over the
Olympic Club.
The Frisco water dogs ran up a
5-2 half-time score on the Cards
Saturday hut Nort's team really
played hall in the second half,
outscoring the Clubmen 3-1.
As far as scoring power is con
cerned, I believe Stanford has it all
over U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., and is just
below the Cal squad. But the Cardi
nal defense is the weak spot that
may relegate a Stanford water polo
team to the hitherto unheard of
spot of third place in conference
play.

refereed the Berkeley game and
Jim Eva was calling them here on
the Farm. So what, you'll say.
Here's what—Cal plays an extremely
close guarding game that amounts to
illegal holding and Whitaker is a
liberal ref who allows a lot of that
sort of stuff. On the other hand,
Eva is on the other side of the fence
and calls everything.
CAL'S STILL TIIE
TEAM TO BEAT
The Bears simply clung right onto
Phil Daubenspeck and Wally O'Con
ner, Club aces, and the Olympic
Games veterans didn't get their
noses above water half the time.
These facts do take something
away from Cal's upset victory, but
still the Bears have the wonder
team this year and it's going to
take a highly improved Stanford
team to beat them.
Incidentally, Whitaker is refing
both games of the Stanford-Cal aqua
feuding this year, so maybe the In
dians will have to change their tac
tics and make their fouls a little less
obvious. The Farm natators were
having fouls called right and left in
the two week-end games.
BRUINS FIGURED
FOR SECOND
Right now it looks like the strong
U.C.L.A. squad is figured for second
place behind Cal. The Bruins held
the L.A.A.C. to a 5-2 score down
south. Another Card-Cal compari
son is the Bears' 7-5 win over the
Olympic Club.
The Frisco water dogs ran up a
5-2 half-time score on the Cards
Saturday hut Nort's team really
played hall in the second half,
outscoring the Clubmen 3-1.
As far as scoring power is con
cerned, I believe Stanford has it all
over U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., and is just
below the Cal squad. But the Cardi
nal defense is the weak spot that
may relegate a Stanford water polo
team to the hitherto unheard of
spot of third place in conference
play.
