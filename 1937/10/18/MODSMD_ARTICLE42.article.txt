# Hahn Net Deadline Set for Wednesday
## 
### 
Entrants in the Hahn Novice Ten
nis Tournament who have not played
at least one match by Wednesday
will be defaulted, according to Ed
Barnett, varsity tennis manager in
charge of the event.
Because of the rainy weather last
week, many matches were unavoid
ably postponed and the Friday dead
line was advanced to give these
players an opportunity to play off
their matches. Contestants who
drew first-round byes must also
play their matches before Wednes
day.
