# Card Water Dogs Divide Week-End Program
## Tank Stars Drop Pair Of Varsity Tilts Olympic Club Noses Out Indian Squad To End Long Losing Streak 
### ARCH JENKINS 
An even break in four games was
all that Stanford water polo teams
could claim after a week-end of
heavy competition here.
The vdrsity team lost to the
American champion Los Angeles
Athletic Club Friday, 9 to 4, and
again Saturday to the strong San
Francisco Olympic Club. 6 to 5. The
Olympic Club victory cracked up a
13-game winning streak that Coach
Thornton had compiled over the
Olympians.
With the aid of several first
string men, the junior varsity finally
defeated Compton J. C. in the Fri
day preliminary, 6 to 3. The score
was tied at 3-all before Johnny
Lamb, Bill Hanna, Bob Plate, and
Dick Hoover went to work for the
jayvee in the overtime. Lamb
scored two goals in the extra period
to cinch the victory.
A 7 to 5 victory over the Olym
pic Club reserves by the Indian sec
ond-string was the other Stanford
win.
Phil Daubenspeck, the L.A.A.C.
perpetual All-American ace, played
a superb offensive game, scoring six
of his team's nine goals. Captain
Hanna and Lamb each made two
points. Hoover, a sophomore, put
into the game in the second half,
did a fine job of guarding Dauben
speck.
Compton J. C. proved to be so
strong that Thornton had to use his
first string to avoid another defeat.
No complaints were voiced, however,
inasmuch as the Compton game was
originally scheduled for the varsity.
Closest competition of the entire
series proved to be the Olympic
Club game. The clubmen led at the
half, 5 to 1, but the Stanfords came
back with more confidence and
eased up to within one point as
the game ended. Hanna narrowly
missed a long shot from the pool
center on the last play. It was in
this rather hotly contested second
half that Plate, another soph,
through some tricky swimming,
scored two goals almost unassisted.
The audiences on both days got
a lot of consolation from watching
Roy Winkleman execute a set of
difficult dives with apparent ease.
Winkleman is the defending Coast
diving champion.
