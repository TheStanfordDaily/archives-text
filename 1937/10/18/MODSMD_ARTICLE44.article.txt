## 
### 
i The Dippy's peerless pigskin pick
ers didn't do so badly this week
! end. They called five out of eight
grid battles correctly to boost their
seasonal average to .607.
The two Sunday games really
brought out the Daily sports writers'
ability. The scriveners missed both
games by a single point. The Bron

26-0. The final score was predicted
25-0. The Galloping Gaels whipped
Loyola 13-7, the game being called
14-7 for St. Mary's by the Daily
stalwarts.
The denizens of the shack pulled
their average up with the aid of
California, which set down Cal Ag
gies 14-0, and C.O.P. 20-0. The
Bears were over-estimated by the
Daily scribes, who called it 40-0 and
30-0. U.S.C. furnished the remain
ing correct forecast by trouncing
Oregon, 34-14. The game score was
called 20-0.
The three misses were the results
of two ties and one reversal. Wash
ington and W.S.C. tied 7-7, a 20-0
score for the Huskies being pre
dicted. Oregon State held U.C.L.A.
to a 7-7 tie, the edge being given to
the Bruins, 13-6. Little Montana
with the beefy gridders turned back
U.S.F. 13-7. That one was called
I 13-6 in favor of the Dons.
