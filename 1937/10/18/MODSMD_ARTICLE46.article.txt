# U. S. C., "Wonder Team" Win "Dead End" Games
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Thus ends coast grid's DEAD-week-END.
Everybody did his duty, as expected, but that all-powerful wonder
team was shown to be not too potent -and a certain southern eleven showed
itself to be THE squad that might beat the pseudo-wonder boys.
That statement about the southern team should be amended a wee bit,
if it weren't for one Park Ambrose Schindler, the Trojans

wouldn't have a ball club. Because*
of Amblin' Amby, U.S.C. slapped Mr. j
Donald Duck from Oregon all over I
the field, 34-14.
Trojans Don't Flash
Other than Schindler's tremendous
playing, Headman Howard Jones j
had little to show. In fact, Stub
Allison has no reason whatsoever to
fear this coming Saturday's battle. I
Troy could do absolutely nothing
when their flash wasn't in there
flashing.
There was no happiness on the
California campus this week-end. It
was simply a calamity, that's all.
The Bears played College of Pacific.
They played the Cal Aggies, too, and
the second string won, 14-0.
Record Broken
But the first string played C.O.P.
And for the first time they scored
less than four touchdowns. And
that's not all. C.O.P. gained distinc
tion in two other ways. They be
came the first team against which
the Cal first stringers had to play
more than two periods; they were
needed—badly, too, for three quar
ters.
What's more, they became the first
team to hold the Bears to less than
20 points in the first half. It took
the regulars three periods to mark
up 14 points. It must be tough to
win a ball game by only 20 points.
Bruins Tie
And then there is the sad, sad
case of U.C.L.A. vs. Oregon State,
which ended in a knotted verdict,
7-7.
It seems that the Bruins, once
rated to be a top team in the con
ference this year, are merely an
other one-man bunch. And that one
guy is Kenny Washington. Without
him, U.C.L.A. is just another ball
club, minus any kind of a defense
at that. Washington heaved a pass
for the Bruins' only score and that's
all that team did. O.S.C. pushed over
its touchdown by power alone and
that was the ball game. Very
simple.
Another Tie
Washington, LAST year's coast
champion, just barely pulled its
game with Washington State out of
the fire at the last minute. A spec
tacular last-period aerial play eked
out a 7-7 tie for the Huskies when

Captain Fritz Waskowitz fired a 23-
yard pass at Merle Miller.
The halfback pulled the ball down
in midfield and raced 50 yards to a
score. A1 Cruver place-kicked the
tying point. W.S.C. scored in the
first nine minutes of play after a
combination running and passing
attack which netted 38 yards in two
plays.
An air raid chalked up a 13-7 win
for Montana over U.S.F. The Griz
zlies completely outplayed the Dons
the first half but had the tables
turned on them in the third and
fourth periods, when the visitors
poured on enough steam to score
their only touchdown.

was simply a calamity, that's all.
The Bears played College of Pacific.
They played the Cal Aggies, too, and
the second string won, 14-0.
Record Broken
But the first string played C.O.P.
And for the first time they scored
less than four touchdowns. And
that's not all. C.O.P. gained distinc
tion in two other ways. They be
came the first team against which
the Cal first stringers had to play
more than two periods; they were
needed—badly, too, for three quar
ters.
What's more, they became the first
team to hold the Bears to less than
20 points in the first half. It took
the regulars three periods to mark
up 14 points. It must be tough to
win a ball game by only 20 points.
Bruins Tie
And then there is the sad, sad
case of U.C.L.A. vs. Oregon State,
which ended in a knotted verdict,
7-7.
It seems that the Bruins, once
rated to be a top team in the con
ference this year, are merely an
other one-man bunch. And that one
guy is Kenny Washington. Without
him, U.C.L.A. is just another ball
club, minus any kind of a defense
at that. Washington heaved a pass
for the Bruins' only score and that's
all that team did. O.S.C. pushed over
its touchdown by power alone and
that was the ball game. Very
simple.
Another Tie
Washington, LAST year's coast
champion, just barely pulled its
game with Washington State out of
the fire at the last minute. A spec
tacular last-period aerial play eked
out a 7-7 tie for the Huskies when

Captain Fritz Waskowitz fired a 23-
yard pass at Merle Miller.
The halfback pulled the ball down
in midfield and raced 50 yards to a
score. A1 Cruver place-kicked the
tying point. W.S.C. scored in the
first nine minutes of play after a
combination running and passing
attack which netted 38 yards in two
plays.
An air raid chalked up a 13-7 win
for Montana over U.S.F. The Griz
zlies completely outplayed the Dons
the first half but had the tables
turned on them in the third and
fourth periods, when the visitors
poured on enough steam to score
their only touchdown.
Thus ends coast grid's DEAD-week-END.
Everybody did his duty, as expected, but that all-powerful wonder
team was shown to be not too potent -and a certain southern eleven showed
itself to be THE squad that might beat the pseudo-wonder boys.
That statement about the southern team should be amended a wee bit,
if it weren't for one Park Ambrose Schindler, the Trojans

wouldn't have a ball club. Because*
of Amblin' Amby, U.S.C. slapped Mr. j
Donald Duck from Oregon all over I
the field, 34-14.
Trojans Don't Flash
Other than Schindler's tremendous
playing, Headman Howard Jones j
had little to show. In fact, Stub
Allison has no reason whatsoever to
fear this coming Saturday's battle. I
Troy could do absolutely nothing
when their flash wasn't in there
flashing.
There was no happiness on the
California campus this week-end. It
was simply a calamity, that's all.
