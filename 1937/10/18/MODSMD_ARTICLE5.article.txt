# Excom Plans Library Probe
## A.S.S.U. To Investigate Sunday Night Hours 
### 
Proposals for opening the Library
regularly on Sunday nights will be
considered by Ex Committee at its
meeting tomorrow night, A.S.S.U.
President Tom Killefer said yester
day.
Ex Committee's probable action,
Killefer indicated, will be to appoint
a committee to confer with Library
Director Nathan Van Patten on ad
visability of holding a general stu
dent and faculty poll on The Daily's
plan to have "the libe" open Sun
day nights.
Actual decision to open the library
for those hours would have to come
from the University Administration,
after student opinion on the matter
had been determined.
Other matters to be considered
by Ex Committee tomorrow night,
Killefer said, include the constitu
tion for the new theatrical society,
tentatively named "Stanford Play
ers," and plans for presenting mo
tion pictures in the Memorial Hall
on Sunday nights. Bill Hovey will
report on the latter suggestion.
Ex Committee also will mull over
arrangements for exchange students
with European universities, and plans
to inaugurate a lecture series win
ter quarter.
