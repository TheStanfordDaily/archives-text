## The 						Lady Looks at Knees 
### 
Each year The Daily has a women's editor
whose sole job it is to train tryoutees, typewrite
editorial board notices, and edit one women's
edition some drab day in spring.
With the increasing number of women at the
University, it will be policy this volume to give
the women's editor the opportunity to banter
her view in these columns.
Below is the way she looks at what men see
too much of.—The Editor
IT is unfortunate that short skirts are the vogue
for women this year.
It is unfortunate because a perennial com
plaint will grow hardier as skirts grow shorter.
Since October days are too cold for spring
bobby socks and too warm for the long silk
hosiery of winter, the time is ripe for the sea
sonal masculine protest against that boon to
womanhood called the rolled stocking.
That the rolled stocking is both a time-saver
and a comfort compared to full-length hose are
matters that every woman knows. The girl who
winds a stocking below her knee or wears a
three-quarter-length substitute feels a great deal
more comfortable and can conceivably make 8
o'clocks more easily than her sister who per
sists in putting on a complete leg-covering.

What every woman doesn't know is that a
number of male observers never fail to object
to seeing two inches of bare leg between a girl's
skirt and her stocking as she walks down the
Quad or crosses her knees on a red Lagunita
sofa. The sight is disillusioning—not to say
delusional.
The first written protest against the rolled
stocking on the Farm was sounded last year in
Campus Opinion. From there the topic crept
into a feature column. Now it has invaded the
editorial pages.
Now that this year's short skirts will increase
the two objectionable bare inches to four, mas
culine opposition probably will likewise double.
Skirts may go up, but knees remain the same.
Stocking-rolling devotees who want a come
back to masculine sneers can always point to
the dirty cords and sloppy socks usually worn
by the most vigorous objectors. But really,
women have a choice of demanding the equality
of sloppiness with men or of personifying the
ideal.
At any rate, women will do as they please on
the hose-rolling question.
Whether they will please what pleases the
men is still another question.—M. L.

IT is unfortunate that short skirts are the vogue
for women this year.
It is unfortunate because a perennial com
plaint will grow hardier as skirts grow shorter.
Since October days are too cold for spring
bobby socks and too warm for the long silk
hosiery of winter, the time is ripe for the sea
sonal masculine protest against that boon to
womanhood called the rolled stocking.
That the rolled stocking is both a time-saver
and a comfort compared to full-length hose are
matters that every woman knows. The girl who
winds a stocking below her knee or wears a
three-quarter-length substitute feels a great deal
more comfortable and can conceivably make 8
o'clocks more easily than her sister who per
sists in putting on a complete leg-covering.

What every woman doesn't know is that a
number of male observers never fail to object
to seeing two inches of bare leg between a girl's
skirt and her stocking as she walks down the
Quad or crosses her knees on a red Lagunita
sofa. The sight is disillusioning—not to say
delusional.
The first written protest against the rolled
stocking on the Farm was sounded last year in
Campus Opinion. From there the topic crept
into a feature column. Now it has invaded the
editorial pages.
Now that this year's short skirts will increase
the two objectionable bare inches to four, mas
culine opposition probably will likewise double.
Skirts may go up, but knees remain the same.
Stocking-rolling devotees who want a come
back to masculine sneers can always point to
the dirty cords and sloppy socks usually worn
by the most vigorous objectors. But really,
women have a choice of demanding the equality
of sloppiness with men or of personifying the
ideal.
At any rate, women will do as they please on
the hose-rolling question.
Whether they will please what pleases the
men is still another question.—M. L.
