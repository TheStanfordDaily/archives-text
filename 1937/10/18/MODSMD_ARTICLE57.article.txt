ONE of the signs of autumn at state univer
sities all over the country is the appear
ance of editorials in the student dailies denounc
ing compulsory military training.
Particularly vehement are those of the Daily
Californian, and its Bruin brother at U.C.L.A.
There the campaign has been worked into a
formula. First, bait the administration with a
student poll. Second, the administration replies.
Third, the editor picks the reply to pieces. This
can go on for quite a time, especially when
mixed in with quotations from professors at
Columbia or Minnesota or some other college
that has dropped military.
But at Stanford there is no formula for de
nouncing compulsory R.O.T.C. because it isn't
compulsory here. There is no formula for de
nouncing optional R.O.T.C. because editors
have never thought of the subject.
At Stanford The Daily does not have to take a
stand. Compulsory khaki-wearing passed out
with the S.A.T.C. at the end of the war. Faced,
perhaps, with a more wily administration, edi
tors do not have to search out professors who
are willing to say in print that military training
makes narrow nationalists or incipient militar
ists of the students.
Nor do editors have to complain of the dele
terious effect of woolen cloth on knee and shin,

and of the color complexes that brown shirts
are prone to form. The military is heard from
once a year, when it wants publicity for its
annual ball.
But there is one stand that The Daily can take,
and it takes it bravely. It favors optional train
ing over none at all.
