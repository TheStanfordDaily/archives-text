IF YOU GOTTA GOAT . . .
A CCORDING to various college newspapers, cxtra
curricular activities throughout the country are
undergoing one of their periodic maulings by admin
istrations and campus brass hats. A look through uni
versity records shows that these bursts of criticism
have the character of epidemics, beginning at one
college and spreading to others. Probably they could
be graphed as cycles, and this year could be shown
stranded on a peak that indicates restless nights and
chewed finger nails for activity men.
As yet, the epidemic has not reached Stanford, but
several western colleges have been infected and are
running berserk among their activities. Assorted deans
are remarking caustically that better "balance" is
needed between activities and class work; echoing cam
pus leaders are commenting with stunning originality
that you can't get through school without studying.
* * * *
After being badly singed by such thunder bolts
from on high, activities have no choice but to crawl
into their hoies and watch promising freshmen go off
to the movies.
In practically every instance this blasting of activi
ties is used to quiet savage alumni and militant par
ents who bellow about declining scholarship. When
such complaints arise, it is much easier to shift the
blame than to dig out figures to prove that scholar
ship remains unsullied. A mildly ironic proof of the
insincerity of this version of the ancient buck-passing
game is that football and other advertising athletics are
never smitten.
* * * *
JjT is unfortunate that Olympians at other colleges
cannot exercise more originality when, with true
Christian spirit, they set out to pass along the blame.
Extra-curricular activities are one of the few features
of college life that is in step with the spirit of edu
cation so beautifully expressed and glorified in uni
versity charters. They provide the only training
ground where theory-soaked students can see their
classroom principles put into practice. Without activi
ties, colleges would be no more than a fog of words,
very pretty perhaps, but completely unrelated to
action.
And, although goat-hunting administrations may
forget it, activities are one of the most important in
fluences that keep students on campus and interested
in the university.
* * + *
Haggard deans will plead with their charges to stay
at home, to love dear alma mater, to scorn the temp
tations of the bright lights; and then they will return
to their offices and issue another blast at activiies.
They do not realize that with the activities cowed, stu
dents on campus can choose for entertainment between
mumblety peg and guessing games. Having had quite
enough of guessing games during examinations, they
naturally shove off from the ivied walls and start
looking for the trunk highway to hell.
It is fairly easy to follow this line of reasoning
and deduce that really brilliant administrations with
a buck to pass will bestow it on something besides
activities. Extra-curricular organizations make excel
lent scape-goats, but they pay off better if left alone.

As yet, the epidemic has not reached Stanford, but
several western colleges have been infected and are
running berserk among their activities. Assorted deans
are remarking caustically that better "balance" is
needed between activities and class work; echoing cam
pus leaders are commenting with stunning originality
that you can't get through school without studying.

After being badly singed by such thunder bolts
from on high, activities have no choice but to crawl
into their hoies and watch promising freshmen go off
to the movies.
In practically every instance this blasting of activi
ties is used to quiet savage alumni and militant par
ents who bellow about declining scholarship. When
such complaints arise, it is much easier to shift the
blame than to dig out figures to prove that scholar
ship remains unsullied. A mildly ironic proof of the
insincerity of this version of the ancient buck-passing
game is that football and other advertising athletics are
never smitten.

JjT is unfortunate that Olympians at other colleges
cannot exercise more originality when, with true
Christian spirit, they set out to pass along the blame.
Extra-curricular activities are one of the few features
of college life that is in step with the spirit of edu
cation so beautifully expressed and glorified in uni
versity charters. They provide the only training
ground where theory-soaked students can see their
classroom principles put into practice. Without activi
ties, colleges would be no more than a fog of words,
very pretty perhaps, but completely unrelated to
action.
And, although goat-hunting administrations may
forget it, activities are one of the most important in
fluences that keep students on campus and interested
in the university.

Haggard deans will plead with their charges to stay
at home, to love dear alma mater, to scorn the temp
tations of the bright lights; and then they will return
to their offices and issue another blast at activiies.
They do not realize that with the activities cowed, stu
dents on campus can choose for entertainment between
mumblety peg and guessing games. Having had quite
enough of guessing games during examinations, they
naturally shove off from the ivied walls and start
looking for the trunk highway to hell.
It is fairly easy to follow this line of reasoning
and deduce that really brilliant administrations with
a buck to pass will bestow it on something besides
activities. Extra-curricular organizations make excel
lent scape-goats, but they pay off better if left alone.
