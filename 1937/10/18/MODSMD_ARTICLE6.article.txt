# Chaplain Speaks On True Religion
## 
### 
"Many of those who feel them
selves to be irreligious are actually
religious in the broader sense of the
word," said Dr. D. Elton Trueblood,
University chaplain, striking the
keynote of yesterday's sermon in
Memorial Church.
Dr. Trueblood stated that many
people who attend church have a
greater intellectual unity with those
outside the church than with other
church-goers.
Thus, he concluded, the church is
not a real division, for both within
and without the church there are
those who believe greatly and light
ly. The people who actually have
something in common are whose
who believe greatly.
