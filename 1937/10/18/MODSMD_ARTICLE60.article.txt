HPHAT rushing and eating out is not confined to
houses on the Row is self-evident from the evi
dence received from El Toro last week while so
journing in the rest home and gargling eight quarts
of salt-soda-and-water each day. It matters not how
charged with invitations the mail-boxes, some people
are eating at the eating clubs.
One gentleman was invited to cat there by a member
of the Bulls, and they agreed to meet there in front of
the door, but failed to do so because they couldn't
see each other for Toros.
So the invitee went in and sat down, and the in
vitor went in and sat down, and pretty soon the man
next to the latter said: "Who's that guy sitting up there
in the president's chair? No one in Toro knows who
he is. Pass the word along." With that a dread realiza
tion came upon the Toro, for there was his guest, in
the President's chair, and no one know him from
Adams, but he wasn't Adam.
The man in the president's chair, when interviewed,
s>aid: "The fellows on both sides of me weren't very
talkative. I like to talk when I eat."
boaiding is a favoirte pastime among the Sigma
Chis and DeGees, and so they have been sign
boarding between themselves in the upper story win
dows. First to appear was the question by the Sigs:
"Do you Foo?" this was answered by: "Noo."
This proved enough for the Sigma Chis for the
present, but not for the Dee Gees. They put another
sign in the window saying, "Foo plus Goo equals
Sigma Choo.' And later: "Life begins at footy-foo."
A young man who lives somewhere near here
called up the Sigma Choos one day and a girl's voice
answered. He said. "Is this the Sigma Chi house?"
The girl said: "No, but it's a liquor store, but gasoline
and alcohol don't mix."
STANFORD girl won the Philip Morris score con
test, and hastened to tell her friends in a shrill
voice. She was thereupon congratulated, and everyone
talked for a while, but there ensued an embarrassing
silence, from which the girl shrilled, "This is awfully
funny, but has anyone got a cigarette?"

Political Sciencc I requires a paper each week, and
for the first one, and for purposes of impression, one
gentleman handed in a paper saying lots in five type
written pages. It came back with a "B" on it and
the following comment: Unnecces (crossed out) Un
eccesa (crossed out) Too Long (underlined).
