# "Reunion In Vienna" Wins Critic's Ho-hum
## 
### 
"Reunion in Vienna" (last per
formance tonight at the Palo Alto
Community Theater). That this lat
est production of "Reunion in Vi
enna" failed to carry with its usual
high comedy frequency, was due in
part to a Thursday night audience,
which for general enthusiastic re
sponse would make George Jean
Nathan look like a kid at his first
Western.
However, in spite of the rigor
mortis of the house, Jim Clancy, as

the gay recalci
trant ex - Prince
Rudolf; Virginia
Rogers, as his ex
mistress Elena;
and Dr. Margery
Bailey, as the cig
,ar - smoking old
a harridan, Fr a u
* Lucher, helped to
make Sherwood's
satire the suave
stuff it is.
Through an in
teresting, if not
altogether usual

twist of direction," the relationship
between Elena and her enlightened
psychiatrist husband, who sends her
back to Rudolf to cure an old in
fatuation, was dramatized to the
pi'oportions of a real struggle. Ordi
narily done as pure, flippant comedy,
the play might well have been put
under the ether by such an inter
pretation, except that Miss Rogers
while not essentially a comedienne, is
a skilled dramatic actress.
In one of the most expert sets of
the season, Carroll Alexander cre
ated a modernistic drawing room,
which escaped looking like it was
fitted with odd pieces from an up-to
date beauty parlor, or the intimate
corners of a bar.
If this revival was, in parts, as
tarnished as Sherwood's decayed
nobility characters, the fault may
be laid to a not very happy minor
cast.
