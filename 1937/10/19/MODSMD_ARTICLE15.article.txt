# Taxi Driver Is Unwitting Cause Of Roble Flood
## 
### 
Last night at 7:45 o'clock an un
witting taxi driver drove through the
opening between Roble and one of
the new Lagunita wings. At 7:46
women in Roble Club meeting were
disturbed by the gentle sound of
rain as a torn main water line
spouted. Minutes later Paly police
short wave station announced a
flood.
As a crowd gathered and water
flowed down the street, by chance a
student mentioned the fact to the
lady at the Roble desk. At 7:55 it
was evident that no one had been
told to shut off the line. A now much
excited Roble lady phoned Build
ing Maintenance Corp., water com
pany, and emergency plumbers, it
appearing that the lake was to be
filled early this year. Minutes later
the same student wandered out, dis
covered the flood stopped and the
crowd dispersed.
