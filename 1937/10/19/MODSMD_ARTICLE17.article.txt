# U. S. Girls Beautiful, Says German
## 
### BOB LOW 
"All American girls are beautiful,"
according to Wolfgang Dieck, Ger
man exchange student. "But," he
adds, "I think perhaps young Euro
pean women are more attractive on
the whole."
Dieck has come to Stanford as a
fraternity exchange student after
having spent last year at DePauw
University, Indiana, where he was
also an exchange student. Wolf, as
he is better known to the campus,
was initiated Phi Delt at DePauw
last year and is living in the same
fraternity at Stanford.
Crashes Gate
To illustrate the fact that "one
can even pull fast ones on Ameri
cans" Dieck told how he had gained
admittance to the National Tennis
Championships at Forest Hills with
out purchasing a ticket.
After being turned away at the
entrance, Dieck again presented
himself, this time with a letter
typewritten in German. Telling the
gateman that this was his press
pass, he was finally admitted to the
grounds and saw the matches from
the press box.
However, "Wolf" said that he
thought easterners could be more
easily fooled than westerners, be
cause he failed to gain a pass as a
pressman at the Santa Clara game
here this fall.
Tall Tale
Dieck was impressed by the in
formality of American girls.
"One feels quite swell when a
girl puts her cheek to yours while
dancing, but soon you find that she
is flirting with someone else over
your shoulder. However," he con
tinued, "I admire your girls' inde
pendence and, among other things,
their ability to drive their own
au t os."
Comparing American colleges with

European universities, Dieck said
that the German student invariably
follows a definite course of study
from the start while the American
student often is undecided as to his ;
course up to his second or third
year of college.
Because of the more thorough;

general education provided by the
German high school it is easier for
him to make a choice at college and
later life.
With a smile Dieck pointed to the
milkshake he had been swizzling
and said, "You Americans have got
something there."
