# Moulton Advises Frosh on Rushing
## 
### 
With most cards for the second
week of rushing already in the mail,
Don Moulton, Interfraternity Coun
cil President, wishes to inform fresh
men that they need not hesitate to
leave fraternity houses in the eve
ning to attend any social function
they desire.
Some question has been raised by
the Frosh owing to various fresh
man functions falling on the week
ends. There is no demand made of
frosh to remain at a house for any
specified length of time; the definite
time stated on the cards merely gives
hours.
Cards for the third rushing pe
riod, coming October 29 and 30, will
be on sale this Friday. Due to the
added time it is hoped there will be
no delay in returning them.
