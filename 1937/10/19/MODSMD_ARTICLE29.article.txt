# Stocks Crash To Reach Year Bottom
## Exchange Feels Effect Of Day's Frenzied Security Dumping 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (U.R).—Five
billion dollars of stock and bond
values evaporated today as securities
of all types were dumped in frenzied
.selling reminiscent of the 1929 crash.
Stocks and bonds begged for buy
ers as account after account was
thrown overboard. On the New York
Stock Exchange losses up to $11 a
share were recorded in trading fa
vorites with similar losses on the
New York Curb Exchange. On the
listed bond market losses ranging
to $100 per $1,000 bond were re
corded.
The Dow Jones average for sec
onary rails went to a low since De
cember 9, 1933, while stock averages
all were at lows since 1935 —the in
dustrial average breaking more than
10 points in the greatest decline
since June 16, 1930. A total of 712
new lows for the year was estab
lished. |
Trade Scramble
Trading was enormous, the vol
ume for the day reaching 3,230,000
shares, largest since March and the
ninth three-million-share day of the
year. In the last hour as selling
gained its greatest headway, 1,390,-
000 shares were traded and at times
ticker quotations were as many as
six minutes behind floor operations.
The final quotations appeared on the
tape 19 minutes after close of the
market. The final hour was the
heaviest single hour since February
17, 1936.
There was no explanation in Wall
Street. No one would forecast when
the decline would be arrested. The
forecasts were for additional heavy
margin selling.
S.E.C. DENIES INTENT
TO CLOSE EXCHANGE
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (U.R).—
Securities and Exchange Commis
sion officials said today, in response
to inquiries, that rumors that the
Commission intended to close the
New York stock market were "ut
terly unfounded."
Officials said the S.E.C. will in
vestigate the source of the rumors
on the possibility they may have
been deliberately circulated.
