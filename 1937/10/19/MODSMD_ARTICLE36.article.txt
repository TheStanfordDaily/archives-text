# It's Nice Workâ€” If You Can Get It

Samuel R. Beekley, Beta, has
been receiving congratulations
since publication of the Bawl
out on his new position as Tri-
Delt house-mother.
The Tri-Delts deny that he
is house-mother, feeling sure
that it must be his mother who
is Mrs. Samuel R. Beekley.
Mrs. Beekley, unlike her son,
is not even given a mention in
the Bawiout, or credit for
mothering the Tri-Delts.
