# Toyon Calm Disturbed When Three Girls Hula
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Toyon is usually a quiet place,
especially on Sunday nights. Of
course, every few days some of the
boys on the managerial board of the
hall decide that there is entirely too
much studying going on, at which
time they calmly explode a few very
large bombs — both of the explosive
and water variety—with gratifying
results.
But at a late hour Sunday night
something occurred which definitely
stopped even the most arid dryballs
in Toyon, and even some in Bran
ner. What's more, the boys-who
run-the-joint had nothing to do
with it.

"It" was a very noisy (but also
very orderly) exhibition of hula
dancing. Wimmen and all.
Toyon was rudely awakened from
its lethargy by a phonograph's
raucous blatting of smooth Ha
waiian rhythms. Inmates, tearing
down to one of the large study
rooms, found there a hot Hawaiian
swing session.
It soon developed that a "Reunion
in Toyon" was under way. Seems
that some Stanfordites who visited
the islan'ds this summer met some
other Stanfordites who live there. So

Sunday night they held a little
clambake.

Aided by recordings and 4 gentle
men whanging guitars and ukeleles,
three girls present executed some
right pert hulas, thank you. The
group plans—so they say—to work
up an Hawaiian skit for the Gaieties.
And, of course, to complete the
picture, there were photographers.
Several minicameramen, tipped off
to the little gathering, flipped shut
ters lackadaisically, disappointed by
the absence of grass skirts.
