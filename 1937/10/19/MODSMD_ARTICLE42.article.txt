HAS CAL A
WONDER TEAM?
Is Cal the "Wonder Team" it was
cracked up to be by City scribes, or
is the 1937 Bear football machine
just a better than average team?
This is the question floating
around Bay region spqrts circles as
the Bears undergo rigid workouts in
preparation for the coming invasion
by the Trojans of U.S.C.
After Trojans recuperate from
these past two weeks and the se
rious relapse suffered by the
Washington Huskies, this Satur
day's battle at Berkeley should he
one of the hest on the Coast this
year.
The Trojans came to life to nose
out a powerful Ohio State eleven
two weeks ago and last Saturday
annihilated the grid forces from
Oregon. From the reports of ob
servers, the Bears didn't look much
like a wonder team against Amos
Alonzo Stagg's College of Pacific.
Allison's first string played three
quarters against the Bengals — the
first time this season that they have
played more than two quarters in
any game. And in three periods of
trying pretty darn hard they were
only able to push across two touch
downs on the Staggmen. The second
string scored once in the final period.
A lot of fans will say, "Well, the
Bears were only fooling around
Saturday—they were taking il
easy. Maybe. My opinion is that
when football players get in the
old hall game, their biggest objec
tive is to cross that thin white
stripe in the shadows of the goal
posts, no matter whether the op
posing team is little Pacific or
Stanford.
I still think the Bears have one of
the best teams in the nation. I still
think they are heading for the con
ference championship and the Rose
Bowl . . . BUT I don't believe the
Berkeleyites have any wonder team.
The boys just had a natural let
down that was coming sooner or
later, and I'll bet Stub • Allison is
thanking his lucky stars the letdown
occurred last week-end and not
this coming Saturday.
The Trojans are coming up
north to win that hall game. If
the Bears hit their stride again
they'll whip the invaders by a
convincing score, if not — well,
look for a stunning upset.
Incidentally, Stub has announced
that no longer do second and third
teams exist on his California foot
ball squad. Stub will grant that he
has a first string but reserve elev
ens at Berkeley will henceforth be
listed as Team X and Team Y.
SECOND STRING
OUTPLAYS FIRST
The connection between the new
policy and the mathematical figures
is that Allison has a difficult time
determining the relative strength of
his teams. Against Washington
State the so-called Bear third team
turned in a far better performance
than the second string.
Oh, yes, another good ball game
is going to be that tussle up north
when Tiny's rejuvenated steam
roller starts rolling toward the
wild country of Washington where
the Huskies hang out.
Washington's slump and the In
dians' sudden recovery should give
the Farm gridders a chance to wipe
out last year's 14-14 tie. That tie
looked pretty good last year, but a
tie won't do this time.
