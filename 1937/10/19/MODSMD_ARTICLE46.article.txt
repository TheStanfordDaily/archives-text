## Crippled Indians Back; Paulman May Play Against Washington 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Satisfied that they could take on
the Huskies any time now, varsity
gridders will concentrate on funda
mentals this week and waive scrim
mage.
Coach Tiny Thornhill held scrim
make twice last week, and started
out yesterday with dummy scrim
mage against University of Wash
ington running and pass plays.
Pauiman in Play
Bill Pauiman donned pads for the
first time since he dislocated his col
lar bone in the Oregon game two
weeks ago. Although he can use his
arm freely now, his shoulder still
pains, and it is doubtful whether
he will be able to play very long at
Seattle next Saturday.
Irv Cummings, varsity flankman,
was on the field again yesterday
after a recent case of bronchitis. A
sweat-shirt scarving his head and
throat indicated that his cold is not
completely cured.
Neil Rasmussen, who has been
out with a sprained ankle, has
thrown aside crutches, and may at
tend practice this afternoon.
Zagar Back
Pete Zagar had to leave yester
day's session to have a boil treated
at the hospital, but will be on the
field again today.
A1 Alustiza, quarterback, injured a
finger in yesterday's practice. It
was not discovered whether the fin
ger, which had been injured in the
U.C.L.A. game, was sprained or
broken. But he played three quar
ters against the Bruins with his
fingers taped, and can do it again.
With no scrimmage this week to
build up an injured list, varsity
coaches can be reasonably sure that
except for Bill Paulman's possible
shouider trouble, a full squad of ball
players will be in good shape when
they hop the northbound train
Thursday night.
Thursday's session will be
the last becore the Washington
game.
