## Lockwood Grooms New Varsity Prospects 
### 
With Bob Underwood and Bob
Braly the only lettermen returning
from last year's tennis team, Coach
Sherman Lockwood is daily groom
ing a large number of prospects to
fill the remaining positions before
the season opens during the winter
term.
Both varsity and frosh ladders
have been organized to give Coaches
Lockwood and Elwyn Bugge an idea
of the relative potentialities of their
material. Underwood, team captain,
theoretically heads the varsity
grouping with No. 1 man Braly in
active with an injured hand. Bob
Caldwell, who saw some action last
year but failed to win his letter, is
on hand and is likely to fill a high
notch soon. Lloyd Gates, Myron
Folsom, and Dave Brock, members
of last year's frosh, are fighting for
places in the first six.
Others given a good chance of
capturing first team berths are Jack
Laney and Sherwood Armstrong,
winners of numerals as freshmen
two years ago, and Jim Seaver and
Bud Biorkman.
Among the frosh, Bob Low ap
pears to be the best prospect on the
ladder of 39 players. He has had
considerable experience and at pres
ent tops the yearling group. Ray
Stahl and two Olahomans, Jim
Lundy and Sid Terry, probably will
climb up to fill the following posi
tions before long.
