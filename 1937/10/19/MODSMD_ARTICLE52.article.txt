# Splashers Meet U.S.C. Friday
## 
### 
Trying hard to forget the double
defeat of last week-end, Coach Nort
Thornton of the Stanford water polo
team scrimmaged his teams hard last
night in preparation for the U.S.C.
game here this Friday, October 22.
The Trojans have been the Coast
Conference door mats ever since
they won the championship in 1932.
Since that time, they have failed to
gain one league victory.
Reports from Los Angeles, how
ever, indicate that a combination of
veterans and transfers will greatly
bolster their lineup. At any rate,
the inexperienced Cardinal varsity
should be rated as the under-dog.
Thornton reported himself well
pleased with the work of Dick Hoo
ver and Bob Plate, his sophomore
first-stringers, but declared that he
would work intensively on passing
and offense in preparation for the
Friday game.
The Stanford offense has bogged
down considerably in the early
minutes of all the pre-season games.
