# Indian Frosh Face Tough Bruin Tubs
## U.C.L.A. Babes Boast 200-Pound Line For Game Here Saturday 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Saturday Stanford's frosh football
1 team comes up against one of the
toughest teams on the coast when it
; plays the U.C.L.A. freshmen here.
The Westwood Cubs — they held
Cal to an 0-0 tie Saturday—have
; the biggest frosh team ever to play
| for U.C.L.A., with a line that aver
ages 200 pounds.
\ But in spite of the size of their
' players and the record they have
made so far this season, Shipkey
thinks Steinford has at least a 50-50
' chance to win. "The morale of the
team right now is very good, they've
got a lot of pep," Shipkey said yes
i terday. "We should go places from
now on this season. The boys are
confident that we will beat U.C.L.A.
! Saturday, and for that matter, so
am I."
Haslan Dangerous
Big threat on the Uclan team will
be Jim Haslan, triple-threat full
back who was all-Southern Califor
nia halfback with his high school
I team last year.
But to stop Haslan and run over
the Cub 200-pound line, Shipkey
will have Fullback Norm Standlee,
who was voted team captain last
Saturday; Jim Farquharson at end,
Ed Johansen and Bill Braheny at
tackles, Chick Orme, elected line
captain, at guard, Thor Peterson at
half, and Jim McCloud and Stan
Graff at the quarterback position.
The whole frosh team, with the
possible exception of John Kertnan,
who dislocated his shoulder in the
U.S.C. game, will be suited up ready
to play Saturday. However, all of
! them won't be in tip-top condition.
Halves Hurt
All season the team has suffered
from halfback trouble. It's not that
the team has a dearth of good half
backs. It has plenty of them. It's
just that none of them have been
in top shape all season.
The only shift in line-up for this
game will be made when Dean Bur
ford is shifted from- tackle to guard
to take the place of Kerman. Bill
Adams and Howard Ruth will also
see action at that post Saturday.
This week the team will work on
all departments of the game, not
specializing in anything in particu
lar, in order to be completely ready
for the Uclans.

for the Uclans.
Saturday Stanford's frosh football
1 team comes up against one of the
toughest teams on the coast when it
; plays the U.C.L.A. freshmen here.
The Westwood Cubs — they held
Cal to an 0-0 tie Saturday—have
; the biggest frosh team ever to play
| for U.C.L.A., with a line that aver
ages 200 pounds.
\ But in spite of the size of their
' players and the record they have
made so far this season, Shipkey
thinks Steinford has at least a 50-50
' chance to win. "The morale of the
team right now is very good, they've
got a lot of pep," Shipkey said yes
i terday. "We should go places from
now on this season. The boys are
confident that we will beat U.C.L.A.
! Saturday, and for that matter, so
am I."
Haslan Dangerous
Big threat on the Uclan team will
be Jim Haslan, triple-threat full
back who was all-Southern Califor
nia halfback with his high school
I team last year.
But to stop Haslan and run over
the Cub 200-pound line, Shipkey
will have Fullback Norm Standlee,
who was voted team captain last
Saturday; Jim Farquharson at end,
Ed Johansen and Bill Braheny at
tackles, Chick Orme, elected line
captain, at guard, Thor Peterson at
half, and Jim McCloud and Stan
Graff at the quarterback position.
The whole frosh team, with the
possible exception of John Kertnan,
who dislocated his shoulder in the
U.S.C. game, will be suited up ready
to play Saturday. However, all of
! them won't be in tip-top condition.
Halves Hurt
All season the team has suffered
from halfback trouble. It's not that
the team has a dearth of good half
backs. It has plenty of them. It's
just that none of them have been
in top shape all season.
The only shift in line-up for this
game will be made when Dean Bur
ford is shifted from- tackle to guard
to take the place of Kerman. Bill
Adams and Howard Ruth will also
see action at that post Saturday.
This week the team will work on
all departments of the game, not
specializing in anything in particu
lar, in order to be completely ready
for the Uclans.
