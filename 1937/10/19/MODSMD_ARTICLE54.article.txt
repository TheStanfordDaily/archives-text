## Eating Clubs on a Changed Diet 
### 
EATING club men, tomorrow night, will make
their first gesture toward competition with
the Row for good freshman material. The first
step is a hesitant one, it seems, the clubs are
taking the men by lot, the response was so large
that only one man is being taken from each
Encina room.
But it is a definite step, and, within limits, it
seems to be a good one. The clubs have some
thing over there, and they are moving ahead
in trying to show it to the freshmen. Some of
them have Stanford histories that are as long,
colorful, and successful as those of the top fra
ternities on the campus. They have been strong
politically and strong athletically. At the U.C.
L.A. game there were four members of one club
on the field at the same time.
In comfort and convenience, most clubs will
concede little edge to the fraternities. In the
quality of their food, they boast superiority. And
they have an informality that appeals to a type
of man who doesn't like the close bonds of the
fraternity.
Because eating clubs are unique at Stanford,
the average freshman doesn't become conscious
of them until after a quarter or so of acclimation.
Club rushing will cure that, and may catfch some
of the men who join houses simply because
they feel they have to join a fraternity to make

college the real thing.
But the clubs should take a long look at the
reasons for their success before they go in too
deeply.
Specialization in upperclassmen and junior
transfers has been one of the secrets of club
success, solidarity has been another. Though
houses like to say that clubs take the leavings
after the Row has finished, ask any Row man
for the list of campus greats his fraternity has
blacked. You will realize that the leavings are
pretty good, especially after they have had a
year or two of development.
A waterfight at Toro is likely to be joined by
Breakers and Campos, and the Toros will wel
come the recruits. This feeling of kinship was
shown in the joint invitations that were issued
to the dinner and smoker.
But if clubs are becoming conscious of the
competition of the Row's rushing program, and
are trying to combat it, they will probably be
come conscious of competition among them
selves.
Clubmen are going ambitiously into a new
field, and they are going to meet new situations.
The main problem will be to maintain their
typical flavor in spite of rushing, and to profit
by the example of the Row. Informality and
solidarity are their greatest attractions. Formal
ized rushing could destroy them.â€”L. L.
