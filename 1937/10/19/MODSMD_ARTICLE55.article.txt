STANFORD'S Nitery is not a success. It has
not fulfilled the need for which it was in
tended nor any other need. It is of no more use
to the students for whom it was built than any
of the dormitory lobbies or even the Union
Cellar.
When it was conceived, the Nitery had every
chance of a long-lived popularity. It was backed
by a campus population bored by a three
month-long hotel strike and swept away by a
Utopian back-to-the-Farm movement.
Big shots and other students supported the
idea—hoped for an informal, cheap place of
amusement. At the official opening last May
students jam-packed the whole room and yelled
hearty applause.
Last night and on other nights like it there
were two couples in the Nitery—far more popu
lar are the Paly movies, Menlo dispensaries, or

even the Stanford library (if it were open).
Obviously it is impossible to have gala open
ing ceremonies every night or even every
week, but it is not impossible to think of other
ways of making the Nitery a popular night spot.
During summer school two students with
some imagination and more than a little drive
gave the Nitery the reputation of being a fun
place to go. Simply and easily they organized a
weekly radio jolly-up which lasted—officially—
only an hour, but which gave to all more than
an hour's worth of fun.
Students enjoyed themselves, began to like
the Nitery, and soon began spending some of
their spare time there.—For the first and only
time it was fulfilling the need for which it was
built.
Unfortunately Nitery jolly-ups came to a pre
mature death with the end of summer quarter.
The Nitery is now resting in the shadow of offi
cial oblivion and no effort is being made to re
suscitate it.
This quintessentially Stanford practice will
not die a natural death. With active and vigor
ous support by campus leaders of some well
formulated plan, the Nitery may come out of its
coma. At least it's worth the try.—J. R.
