HOW SWEET IS SYMPATHY
\7"ESTERDAY I wrenched a columnistic arm heav
ing a dainty bouquet to Stanford for sparing
extra-curricular activities in that popular indoor ver
sion of football, kicking and passing the buck. But
even as every corsage has a fiendish pin concealed in
its midst, so every hurtling editorial bouquet has a
few "qualifications." Today, in case any brass hats
prove too small for intended heads, I cite the qualifi
cations.
In refraining from blasting activities, Stanford has
displayed a magnificent self control that makes the
Spartan boy with his gnawing fox look like a sissy.
But in its regular policy toward extra-curricular or
ganizations we have adopted a system that hardly war
rants dancing in the streets or regular prayers of
thanksgiving.
* -ft * *
Any activity which vaguely resembles a going con
cern comes under the shadow of marked, though pas
sive, disapproval. The only exception is football, which
by a remarkable coincidence provides money to build
dormitories. Also escaping the enveloping shroud of
censure are those milk-toast discussion clubs that
meet once a month and settle problems of the uni
verse in amiable parliamentary manner, with cookies
and punch afterward.
Any vital organization is regarded as a nuisance,
as regrettable wild oats the sowing of which must be
discouraged. It is almost cause for an extra edition of
The Daily when a professor permits a paper on the
reproductive processes of the glow worm to come in
a day late because of work on activities. This in spite
of the fact that the glow worms will persist in their
misdemeanors, giving a continuous performance for
some centuries after the scheduled day.
* * * *
CTANFORD men in activities find that staying up
1 most of the night to make a Chappie or Daily
deadline is a cause for damnation rather than forgive
ness. Melancholy Hamlets who catch class with grease
paint behind the ears are told frostily that they "are
wasting too much time on unimportant things."
But though the men find the academic world a
cold unchristian place, it is the women who really pay
and pay and ditto. The iron-clad lockout system
makes it almost impossible for them to attain any dis
tinction greater than secretary of the thus-and-such
discussion club. Although many publications editors
have fought the Stanford Press, Chappie and The
Daily frequently don't get page proofs until the dawn
is playing tag with the foothills. Long before then the
girls have to sprint for home.
The gracious heroines and sinister vampires of
dramatics rehearse on their own leaves; and many a
hutched line can be chalked up to the University's
stern refusal to permit more leaves for practice.
The neatly stereotyped answer to any protest at
this subtle smothering of activities is that they inter
fere with studies. Nobody seems to realize that activ
ities can be as useful as studies. Every department in
the university talks inspiringly of the value of leader
ship, of the necessity of knowing how to work with
people. None will be convinced that putting out The
Daily or acting in a play involves just those qualities.
All seem to think that a journalist or an actor crawls
off into a vacuum and spins quietly in a fog of
introspection.
* * * *
Stanford deserves a bouquet because it does not
blame activities for everything from the bad roads to
rushing system. But before any chests swell enough
1o imperil vest buttons we might remember that the
present system punishes a student for trying to de
velop and practice those same qualities thnt dear
alma mater urges upon us so fervently,

The Daily when a professor permits a paper on the
reproductive processes of the glow worm to come in

CTANFORD men in activities find that staying up
1 most of the night to make a Chappie or Daily
deadline is a cause for damnation rather than forgive
ness. Melancholy Hamlets who catch class with grease
paint behind the ears are told frostily that they "are
wasting too much time on unimportant things."
But though the men find the academic world a
cold unchristian place, it is the women who really pay
and pay and ditto. The iron-clad lockout system
makes it almost impossible for them to attain any dis
tinction greater than secretary of the thus-and-such
discussion club. Although many publications editors
have fought the Stanford Press, Chappie and The
Daily frequently don't get page proofs until the dawn
is playing tag with the foothills. Long before then the
girls have to sprint for home.
The gracious heroines and sinister vampires of
dramatics rehearse on their own leaves; and many a
hutched line can be chalked up to the University's
stern refusal to permit more leaves for practice.
The neatly stereotyped answer to any protest at
this subtle smothering of activities is that they inter
fere with studies. Nobody seems to realize that activ
ities can be as useful as studies. Every department in
the university talks inspiringly of the value of leader
ship, of the necessity of knowing how to work with
people. None will be convinced that putting out The
Daily or acting in a play involves just those qualities.
All seem to think that a journalist or an actor crawls
off into a vacuum and spins quietly in a fog of
introspection.

Stanford deserves a bouquet because it does not
blame activities for everything from the bad roads to
rushing system. But before any chests swell enough
1o imperil vest buttons we might remember that the
present system punishes a student for trying to de
velop and practice those same qualities thnt dear
alma mater urges upon us so fervently,
HOW SWEET IS SYMPATHY
\7"ESTERDAY I wrenched a columnistic arm heav
ing a dainty bouquet to Stanford for sparing
extra-curricular activities in that popular indoor ver
sion of football, kicking and passing the buck. But
even as every corsage has a fiendish pin concealed in
its midst, so every hurtling editorial bouquet has a
few "qualifications." Today, in case any brass hats
prove too small for intended heads, I cite the qualifi
cations.
In refraining from blasting activities, Stanford has
displayed a magnificent self control that makes the
Spartan boy with his gnawing fox look like a sissy.
But in its regular policy toward extra-curricular or
ganizations we have adopted a system that hardly war
rants dancing in the streets or regular prayers of
thanksgiving.
* -ft * *
Any activity which vaguely resembles a going con
cern comes under the shadow of marked, though pas
sive, disapproval. The only exception is football, which
by a remarkable coincidence provides money to build
dormitories. Also escaping the enveloping shroud of
censure are those milk-toast discussion clubs that
meet once a month and settle problems of the uni
verse in amiable parliamentary manner, with cookies
and punch afterward.
Any vital organization is regarded as a nuisance,
as regrettable wild oats the sowing of which must be
discouraged. It is almost cause for an extra edition of
The Daily when a professor permits a paper on the
reproductive processes of the glow worm to come in
a day late because of work on activities. This in spite
of the fact that the glow worms will persist in their
misdemeanors, giving a continuous performance for
