rpHE day before the last jolly-up, there was a girl
who knew some time in advance that she had
a lot of studying to do. In anticipation, therefore, she
stayed up the night before, studying and writing let
ters home to complete her work for the next day. She
had four morning classes which she attended, sleepily
but loyally.
After lunch, of which she partook but little, she
climbed wearily to her room, there to lie down for an
hour or so's beauty rest on her Simmons, before going
to the jolly-up.
When she awakened, no one would go to dinner
with her in Paly, because 9 o'clock is really too late.
But, the story goes, she didn't want to go to the
nasty old thing, anyway.
Our has a great deal of trouble with
his books but it can't make much difference, and it
only goes to show that Stanford students can't or
don't read anyway. The other day he brought a book
back from the library which the University had pur
chased in 1930, and he was the first one to take it out.
This particularly surprised us when we saw the
three-foot by four-foot chart of a psychological test
given a man to see if he were a bootlegger member of
A1 Capone's (God rest him in Alcatraz) gang. He,
our roomy, didn't read far enough to see if the man
bootlegged, and if so, why and with whom.
Another interesting book from the library was
taken out the last time in 1914. But our room-mate
explains it as part of the pre-war armament volcano.
[|ESTING in the Rest Home, where we were put in
the six-foot-six bed which has a board down the
middle is all right despite the inhalation machine al
ways falling off the table and pulling its cord out, and
despite the boredom.
One solution was discovered by a varsity Phi Delt
end who was wandering around upstairs between
orange-juices and thermometers. Presently, he dashed
into the room saying: "Muffle your feet in your wool
lies and come see if you see what I see." We went,
waving our thermometers to bring them down again,
and discovered a man knitting in bed and chewing a
contemplative thermom.
After questioning, he revealed that his father had
taught him to knit, and that they could do fine sweat
ers but were best at sox. He then told us where he
lived and asked us to come see him there and he would
show us some of his best stuff.

rpHE day before the last jolly-up, there was a girl
who knew some time in advance that she had
a lot of studying to do. In anticipation, therefore, she
stayed up the night before, studying and writing let
ters home to complete her work for the next day. She
had four morning classes which she attended, sleepily
but loyally.
After lunch, of which she partook but little, she
climbed wearily to her room, there to lie down for an
hour or so's beauty rest on her Simmons, before going
to the jolly-up.
When she awakened, no one would go to dinner

three-foot by four-foot chart of a psychological test
given a man to see if he were a bootlegger member of

Another interesting book from the library was
taken out the last time in 1914. But our room-mate
explains it as part of the pre-war armament volcano.

One solution was discovered by a varsity Phi Delt
end who was wandering around upstairs between
orange-juices and thermometers. Presently, he dashed
into the room saying: "Muffle your feet in your wool
lies and come see if you see what I see." We went,
waving our thermometers to bring them down again,
and discovered a man knitting in bed and chewing a
contemplative thermom.
