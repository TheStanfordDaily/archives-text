# Ex-Stanford Student Pens Worthy Novel
## 
### 
"The Past Must Alter," by Al
bert Guerard, Jr. (Longmans-
Green). An ex-Farm man, author
Guerard not only survived English
11-A, but wrote a novel. To praise
"The Past Must Alter," however,
for admiration of a man who con
quered his environment would be
simply a case of gilding the lily.

In his character
analyses, Mr.
Guerard dissects
with a nice, clin
ical perception —
but a perception
not untempered
by sympathy.
Nodding a
slight acquaint
ance in the direc
tion of William

Sarroyan for his theme of adoles
cent nostalgia, he refuses to grand
stand with Saroyan in his state
ment of that theme.
During the course of the novel,
the hero, Jim Simmons, a child of
acute moral sensibilities, is raked
painfully over life. And hypersensi
tive, he is deeply seared by that ex
perience. But the novel does not be
long alone to Jim. There is Diane,
his mother, a brilliant picture of a
woman — all-absorbing in her love,
and possessive in her need for se
curity. There is Fritz, his father—
vital, reckless —who is stifled in the
vacuum, Diane strives to make of
their marriage. And later, when
Fritz is shot through the head in a
gambling row, thex-e is Howard to
fulfill Diane's life, and her woman's
need to protect and shelter.
Throughout the whole book, in
tangible as a mood, is the maturing
child's powerful realization of sor
didness seeping into life.
"The Past Must Alter" has its
faults. Some of the plot events are
too neatly mechanical; some of the
dialogue is stilted. But whatever its
flaws, they are completely over
shadowed by the sterling worth of
the novel as a whole.

vital, reckless —who is stifled in the
vacuum, Diane strives to make of
their marriage. And later, when
Fritz is shot through the head in a
gambling row, thex-e is Howard to
fulfill Diane's life, and her woman's
need to protect and shelter.
Throughout the whole book, in
tangible as a mood, is the maturing
child's powerful realization of sor
didness seeping into life.
"The Past Must Alter" has its
faults. Some of the plot events are
too neatly mechanical; some of the
dialogue is stilted. But whatever its
flaws, they are completely over
shadowed by the sterling worth of
the novel as a whole.
