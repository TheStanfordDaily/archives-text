### 
Whether or not the library should
be open Sunday night will be dis
cussed from the students' standpoint
tonight when Ex Committee mulls
over plans for a general student
faculty poll to augment that taken
by The Daily last week.
A.S.S.U. President Tom Killefer
said yesterday that a committee will
confer with Nathan Van Patten,
University librarian, on the advisa
bility of holding the poll.
Pajaniarino Discussed
Because the Varsity Theater has
offered its use for the annual Pa
janiarino, Ex Committee will tonight
plan some method of administering
the affair without the broken noses
and tomato-stained Paly police that
resulted last year.
Campus entertainment on the
Committee's docket includes the
Nitery, the new dramatic society,
and Memorial Hall movies. The
Nitery needs its patronage bolstered,
drama leaders need offiical recogni
tion, and the Memorial Hall needs
some old motion pictures to show on
Sunday nights.
Peace Committee Named
Killefer will also appoint an A. S.
S. U. peace committee to handle all
campus peace activity through the
year. Biggest Stanford peace move
ment comes spring quarter with an
all-University Peace Day.
As Ex Committee will a week
from tonight grant the winter quar
ter Reg Dance, Killefer urges in
terested organizations to bid for the
date this week.
