# Eating Clubs Hold Dinner For Freshmen
## 
### 
Several noted coaches and ath
letic stars will be the speakers at
tomori'ow night's smoker in Toyon
lobby, following the dinner being
given by Stanford's seven eating
clubs for first-year men.
Basketball Coach John Bunn and
Minor Sports Coach Harry Malone
will give short talks, as will Jack
Calderwood of basketball fame.
The spirit of the dinner and smok
er is to be strictly informal. Chair
man Harry Horton does not want
freshmen to wear coats and ties
unless they feel more comfortable
in them.
Between the dinner in the eating
clubs and the smoker in Toyon
lobby, open house will be held in
the Hall, giving frosh a chance to
see the rooms and facilities of
Toyon.
