# Eliel Predicts Peace In C. I. 0.-A. F. of L. Fight

### BILL MILLIS 
Peace ending the conflict between the American Federation of Labor
and the Committee for Industrial Organization that has divided the
American labor movement for the past two years will probably be
patched together during the coming winter months.
This prediction was made yesterday by Director Paul Eliel of the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations of the Stanford Graduate School of Business,

in commenting upon the recently
concluded A .F. of L. convention in
Denver and the C.1.0. conference
in Atlantic City.
Pcace Necessary
"No matter how far the conflict
goes, some time there has to be a
reconciliation between the C.1.0.
and the A. F. of L.," he said. "La
bor cannot get far if its factions are
at each other's throats all of the
time. It is impossible to have a per
manent division of the American
labor movement."
First step toward reconciling the
"irreconcilable" A. F. of L. and
C.1.0. forces will come this Sunday
in Washington, D.C., Eliel said, when
peace delegates from the executive
committees of the two national la
bor organizations meet to negotiate
a possible truce, if not a peace, in
the interunion squabble.
Neutrals to Front
"It is more likely that the nego
tiations will drag along for several
months before completed," he
commented. A. F. of L. leaders who
have taken a more or less neutral
position in the conflict with the
C.1.0., such as Jack Shelley, secre
tary of the San Francisco Labor
Conference, will play a leading role
in bringing peace to labor's divided
forces, Eliel predicted.
Discounting the importance of
craft versus industrial unionism as
the basic cause of the C. I. 0.-A. F.
of L. dispute, Eliel declared that "a
struggle for power" involving bit
ter personal clashes between such
men as William Green and John
L. Lewis, and between Harry
Bridges and Dave Beck has been
the most fundamental factor pro
ducing internecine labor warfare.
Political Factor
"The political ambitions of the
C.1.0. unions are a second important
factor in the conflict," the industrial
relations director commented. Such
ambitions are not primai'ily personal
