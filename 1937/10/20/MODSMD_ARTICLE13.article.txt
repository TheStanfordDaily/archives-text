# Eliel Predicts Peace In C. I. 0.-A. F. of L. Fight
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
Peace ending the conflict between the American Federation of Labor
and the Committee for Industrial Organization that has divided the
American labor movement for the past two years will probably be
patched together during the coming winter months.
This prediction was made yesterday by Director Paul Eliel of the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations of the Stanford Graduate School of Business,

in commenting upon the recently
concluded A .F. of L. convention in
Denver and the C.1.0. conference
in Atlantic City.
Pcace Necessary
"No matter how far the conflict
goes, some time there has to be a
reconciliation between the C.1.0.
and the A. F. of L.," he said. "La
bor cannot get far if its factions are
at each other's throats all of the
time. It is impossible to have a per
manent division of the American
labor movement."
First step toward reconciling the
"irreconcilable" A. F. of L. and
C.1.0. forces will come this Sunday
in Washington, D.C., Eliel said, when
peace delegates from the executive
committees of the two national la
bor organizations meet to negotiate
a possible truce, if not a peace, in
the interunion squabble.
Neutrals to Front
"It is more likely that the nego
tiations will drag along for several
months before completed," he
commented. A. F. of L. leaders who
have taken a more or less neutral
position in the conflict with the
C.1.0., such as Jack Shelley, secre
tary of the San Francisco Labor
Conference, will play a leading role
in bringing peace to labor's divided
forces, Eliel predicted.
Discounting the importance of
craft versus industrial unionism as
the basic cause of the C. I. 0.-A. F.
of L. dispute, Eliel declared that "a
struggle for power" involving bit
ter personal clashes between such
men as William Green and John
L. Lewis, and between Harry
Bridges and Dave Beck has been
the most fundamental factor pro
ducing internecine labor warfare.
Political Factor
"The political ambitions of the
C.1.0. unions are a second important
factor in the conflict," the industrial
relations director commented. Such
ambitions are not primai'ily personal
for office-holding, Eliel said, but are
dii'ected along lines of seeking
governmental sanction for the labor
movement, through wages hours
legislation and through arbitration
by such agencies as the National
Labor Relations Board.
This C.1.0. aim has conflicted
with the traditional A. F. of L.
principle that "labor should stand
on its own feet," Eliel commented.
After a good deal of "back stage"
and "hotel room negotiations," Eliel
declared that the A. F. of L. and the
C.1.0. will reach an agreement
which will recognize the importance
of industrial organization in mass
industries, but will at the same time
safeguard the rights of the craft
union groups.
'On Own Terms'
"Under such an arrangement a
united labor movement could single
agreement with a manufacturer in
which several unions would be rep
resented in negotiations," he stated.
The Anaconda mine in Butte,
Montana, and the General Steel
Casting corporation in the East have
already signed such agreements,
Eliel said.
"Public opinion is not yet acute
enough to force peace in the labor
movement," Eliel concluded, "but
labor leaders a;e smart enough to
get together on their own terms be
fore peace would be forced upon
them by outside agencies or the
government."

and the Committee for Industrial Organization that has divided the
American labor movement for the past two years will probably be
patched together during the coming winter months.
This prediction was made yesterday by Director Paul Eliel of the Divi
sion of Industrial Relations of the Stanford Graduate School of Business,

in commenting upon the recently
concluded A .F. of L. convention in
Denver and the C.1.0. conference
in Atlantic City.
Pcace Necessary
"No matter how far the conflict
goes, some time there has to be a
reconciliation between the C.1.0.
and the A. F. of L.," he said. "La
bor cannot get far if its factions are
at each other's throats all of the
time. It is impossible to have a per
manent division of the American
labor movement."
First step toward reconciling the
"irreconcilable" A. F. of L. and
C.1.0. forces will come this Sunday
in Washington, D.C., Eliel said, when
peace delegates from the executive
committees of the two national la
bor organizations meet to negotiate
a possible truce, if not a peace, in
the interunion squabble.
Neutrals to Front
"It is more likely that the nego
tiations will drag along for several
months before completed," he
commented. A. F. of L. leaders who
have taken a more or less neutral
position in the conflict with the
C.1.0., such as Jack Shelley, secre
tary of the San Francisco Labor
Conference, will play a leading role
in bringing peace to labor's divided
forces, Eliel predicted.
Discounting the importance of
craft versus industrial unionism as
the basic cause of the C. I. 0.-A. F.
of L. dispute, Eliel declared that "a
struggle for power" involving bit
ter personal clashes between such
men as William Green and John
L. Lewis, and between Harry
Bridges and Dave Beck has been
the most fundamental factor pro
ducing internecine labor warfare.
Political Factor
"The political ambitions of the
C.1.0. unions are a second important
factor in the conflict," the industrial
relations director commented. Such
ambitions are not primai'ily personal
for office-holding, Eliel said, but are
dii'ected along lines of seeking
governmental sanction for the labor
movement, through wages hours
legislation and through arbitration
by such agencies as the National
Labor Relations Board.
This C.1.0. aim has conflicted
with the traditional A. F. of L.
principle that "labor should stand
on its own feet," Eliel commented.
After a good deal of "back stage"
and "hotel room negotiations," Eliel
declared that the A. F. of L. and the
C.1.0. will reach an agreement
which will recognize the importance
of industrial organization in mass
industries, but will at the same time
safeguard the rights of the craft
union groups.
'On Own Terms'
"Under such an arrangement a
united labor movement could single
agreement with a manufacturer in
which several unions would be rep
resented in negotiations," he stated.
The Anaconda mine in Butte,
Montana, and the General Steel
Casting corporation in the East have
already signed such agreements,
Eliel said.
"Public opinion is not yet acute
enough to force peace in the labor
movement," Eliel concluded, "but
labor leaders a;e smart enough to
get together on their own terms be
fore peace would be forced upon
them by outside agencies or the
government."

and the Committee for Industrial Organization that has divided the
