"Genial Jim" Farley shook many
Stanford hands yesterday after
noon.
The Postmaster - General visited
Stanford at 2 o'clock, just after he
had addressed 300 enthusiastic Palo
Altans, mostly Democrats, attending
a banquet in his honor at the Com
munity Center.
Crowding an admiring inspection
of the Memorial Church and innu
merable handshakes into his half
hour on the campus, Farley chatted
with political science majors in
West Memorial Library, advising
them to get interested in politics.
"Don't worry yet about party af
filiation, though," smiled the chair
man of the Democratic National
Committee. "We'll see about that
later."
Think for Selves
American young people are think
ing out their politics for themselves
more than formerly, "Big Jim" told
the crowd of students. "A boy used
to follow the same party that his
father supported. That's the way I
started."
Bob Gros, former student man
ager, conducted Farley through the
Quad, showing him the Memorial
Church and introducing University
Chaplain D. Elton Trueblood. In
side, the number-one Democrat ex

claimed, "Isn't it. beautiful, Ed

publicity director of the Democratic.

Looking exactly like his pictures
—heavy-set, tall, his partly-bald
head sitting squarely on his sub
stantial neck—Jim Farley exhibited
his party-building personality by
making dozens of friends among the
students with whom he took time
to chat. Shaking hands with the po
litical science students, he looked
down at smiling Joan Flor, political
science grad, and said, "I think I'll
start here."
Only one autograph-seeker was
reported. When Farley emerged
from the church he was met by
Louis Stoltz, chapel sexton, holding
pencil and signature book.
"Out of the Red"

Thomas S. Barclay, associate pro
lessor of political science, acted as
toastmaster. Representative John J.
McGrath. hand on Farley's shoulder,
introduced him as "the first Post
master-General to take the depart
ment out of the red."
Being a party dynamo besides
head postman, Farley told diners:
"I travel around the country a lot,
laying cornerstones and dedicating
post offices. And now and then I
find time to do something of a
political nature."

crease in use of air mail in the past
four years. "I trust no particular
significance will be attached," he
quipped, "if I say that one of the
states with the poorest air mail
service is Vermont."
First indication that the Post
master-General would visit the cam
pus during his present "tour of in
spection of post offices" was a
telegram that Gros received Satur
day, reminding him that he had
agreed to show Farley the Stanford
chapel. President Wilbur was un
able to meet him, already having an
appointment away from the campus.
Continuing his whirlwind tour, the
executive planned to attend two
banquets last night—6:3o o'clock at
Monterey and 7:30 o'clock at Salinas.
For two weeks, he has been shak
ing an estimated 3000 hands per
day.
