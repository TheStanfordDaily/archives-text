# 'Carnival Tea' Set For Frosh Women
## 
### 
Freshman women will be enter
tained at a "carnival tea" at La
gunita on Wednesday, October 27,
from 4 to 6 o'clock. Instead of the
regulation tea, popcorn and candied
apples will be served by a vendor
with wagon and all. The musical
side of the entertainment will be
provided by an organ-grinder, and
his monkey's antics will amuse the
guests.
Lagunita sophomores are in
charge of the afternoon. Casa
Chairmen Lorraine Williams, Nancy
Hurst, Janet Brookover, Helen Her
man, Jean Powell, and Claire Pflue
ger, are on the committee headed
by Esther Berry. Ruth Harris is
designing the invitations.
