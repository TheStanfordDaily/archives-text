# Excom Approves 'Safe, Sane' Plan For Pajamarino
## Traditional Freshman Theater Party Slated for November 4 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
The annual freshman Pajamarino will return to its old-time "safe and
sane" status when the pajama-clad of '41 caravan down Palm Drive to a
free show at the Varsity Theater after the S.C. game rally November 1,
Ex Committee decided last night.
Though Dean George Culver had previously dinged the theater's use
bccause the University would be responsible for potential damage, Ex Com-

mittee felt that adequate organiza
tion before the affair would elimi
nate any "rough-stuff."
One of Stanford's oldest football
traditions, originating in 1892, the
Pajamarino fell into disrepute last
fall when the Class of '40 turned
from man to beast for the evening.
When they found Palo Alto thea
ters closed to them, the 500 night
gowns full of freshmen tossed to
matoes at Paly police, tore down
neon signs, generally turned the
townspeople against Stanford exu
berance.
No More Rough-Stuff
"We'll get several 210-poundcrs
who bulge in the right places," said
President Killefer. Committeemen
agreed that student police on the
scene would curb a l'epetition of last
year's unpleasantness.
"Why not let the women in on it
this time?" asked Senior Man Bob
Garretson.
"In their pajamas?" countered
Vice - President Barbara Murphy.
Legislative decision: women will
lean out Roble windows with water
bags for their serenaders, let the
men go to the show alone.
Fox-West Coast offered the Var
sity Theater's exclusive use for the
evening. Rally Committee will plan
a stage show; the theater will screen
a current motion picture.
Other A.S.S.U. business:
THE LIBRARY: Though both Kil
lefer and Murphy admitted they'd
use the Library neither Friday nor
Sunday night, the president ap
pointed Senior Woman Jan North
and Men's Council Chairman John
Dern to confer with Nathan Van
Patten, University librarian.
Ex Committee members heard
Daily Editor Gordy Frost's appeal
for action, decided that The Daily's
poll warranted "looking further into
the matter."
LECTURE SERIES: Carl Sand
burg, noted poet and biographer of
Abraham Lincoln, will lecture here
in February. Upon the popularity
of Mr. Sandburg's appearance de
pends the establishment of a regu
lar Lecture Series. Beih Allen heads
the committee.
NITERY: To Jack Calderwood's
statement that the Nitery proved its
worth as a campus social spot sum
mer quarter, Killefer commented:
"But Jack, can we afford to let the
place set through the winter with
the furniture disappearing chunk
by chunk?" (Missing chairs, lamps,
etc., are still missing.)
Definitely not, replied Committee
men. Suggestions to bolster stu
dent interest, upon which the Nitery
committee will act this week, were
these—football pictures once a week;
hashers on duty from 9:30 till 10:30
to serve cokes from the Cellar to
Niterites; installation of a special
"wheel - aroundable" bar to mix
cokes on the spot.
MOVIES: Although Bill Hovey
and his movie committee failed to
get co-operation from San Francisco
showmen, motion pictures will soon
be shown in Memorial Hall on Sun
day nights. Dr. Harry Reynolds, of
Stanford Associates, is intervening
to get old films for campus con
sumption.
DATES GRANTED: Though the
A.S.S.U. date book is still stolen,
Beta was granted November 13;
Theta Xi, December 3; and Kappa
Alpha, October 29.

the furniture disappearing chunk

Definitely not, replied Committee
men. Suggestions to bolster stu
dent interest, upon which the Nitery
committee will act this week, were
these—football pictures once a week;
hashers on duty from 9:30 till 10:30
to serve cokes from the Cellar to
Niterites; installation of a special
"wheel - aroundable" bar to mix
cokes on the spot.
MOVIES: Although Bill Hovey
and his movie committee failed to
get co-operation from San Francisco
showmen, motion pictures will soon
be shown in Memorial Hall on Sun
day nights. Dr. Harry Reynolds, of
Stanford Associates, is intervening
to get old films for campus con
sumption.
DATES GRANTED: Though the
A.S.S.U. date book is still stolen,
Beta was granted November 13;

The annual freshman Pajamarino will return to its old-time "safe and
sane" status when the pajama-clad of '41 caravan down Palm Drive to a
free show at the Varsity Theater after the S.C. game rally November 1,
Ex Committee decided last night.
Though Dean George Culver had previously dinged the theater's use
bccause the University would be responsible for potential damage, Ex Com-

mittee felt that adequate organiza
tion before the affair would elimi
nate any "rough-stuff."
One of Stanford's oldest football
traditions, originating in 1892, the
Pajamarino fell into disrepute last
fall when the Class of '40 turned
from man to beast for the evening.
When they found Palo Alto thea
ters closed to them, the 500 night
gowns full of freshmen tossed to
matoes at Paly police, tore down
neon signs, generally turned the
townspeople against Stanford exu
berance.
No More Rough-Stuff
"We'll get several 210-poundcrs
who bulge in the right places," said
President Killefer. Committeemen
agreed that student police on the
scene would curb a l'epetition of last
year's unpleasantness.
"Why not let the women in on it
this time?" asked Senior Man Bob
Garretson.
"In their pajamas?" countered
Vice - President Barbara Murphy.
Legislative decision: women will
lean out Roble windows with water
bags for their serenaders, let the
men go to the show alone.
Fox-West Coast offered the Var
sity Theater's exclusive use for the
evening. Rally Committee will plan
a stage show; the theater will screen
a current motion picture.
Other A.S.S.U. business:
THE LIBRARY: Though both Kil
lefer and Murphy admitted they'd
use the Library neither Friday nor
Sunday night, the president ap
pointed Senior Woman Jan North
and Men's Council Chairman John
Dern to confer with Nathan Van
Patten, University librarian.
Ex Committee members heard
Daily Editor Gordy Frost's appeal
for action, decided that The Daily's
poll warranted "looking further into
the matter."
LECTURE SERIES: Carl Sand
