# Weather To Rule Card-Husky Game
## Red Machine Even Choice On Dry Field Washington Is Heavier; Indian Backs, Ends Declared Superior 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
We may win Saturday—if it does
n't rain.
A wet field is the only thing that
can hamper the Big Red Machine.
The Indian linemen would really be
good muckers, but the Huskies are
heavier and have hud more wet field
experience.
The two teams are even in many
respects. Fritz Wascowitz, left half
back for University of Washington,
and his negro substitute, Charley
Russel, are an even match with
Stanford passers. And neither team
can be called superior in charging,
blocking, or tackling.
Kicking Is Factor
Kicking may be an important fac
tor in Saturday's tilt. In the last
three Stanford - Washington games
played at Seattle there have been
no touchdowns. Four years ago, the
Huskies won 6-0 by two field goals,
and two years ago Stanford own in
the same way.
Al Cruver, fullback who should
cause the Redskins their greatest
worry, is an excellent place-kicker.
The teams are about even in punt
ing.
Paulman Still Out
Bill Paulman is still bothered by
his shoulder, which was dislocated
two weeks ago, and will be used
against Washington only if he is
needed to do some kicking. But Pete
Fay showed i - emarkable perform
ance booting the ball against U.C.
L.A.
The Huskies will depend to a great
extent on a tricky short-side attack
they used to deceive Washington
State linemen last Saturday. The
Farm gridders are practicing daily
against Washington plays and should
be able to handle the northerners'
attack.
Indian Ends Are Better
Grant Stone, Irv Cummings, and
Bill Willard should each make a
better performance on the flanks
than any Washington ends.
Indian tackles are superior, but
Pete Zagar may not be able to live
up to his good reputation. He was
out of practice most of last week, and
will get very little in the next several
days.
Huskies Are Big
Washington has a distinct lead
Aver Stanford in size and speed, and
although Coffis and Fay are better
tafety men than Wascowitz and
Johnson, the Huskies have shown
better protection for ball-carriers in
punt returns.
Neil Rasmussen, who sprained his
ankle a week ago, was still unable
to take part in practice, and it is
doubtful whether he will be used at
Seattle.
The Big Red Machine will go
through its last practice session
Thursday afternoon and then hop the
north-bound train.
Telegraph Hill, famous San Fran
cisco landmark, is so called because
in early days news of a ship's arrival
was flashed from its summit by he
liograph.

can hamper the Big Red Machine.
The Indian linemen would really be
good muckers, but the Huskies are
heavier and have hud more wet field
experience.
The two teams are even in many
respects. Fritz Wascowitz, left half
back for University of Washington,
and his negro substitute, Charley
Russel, are an even match with
Stanford passers. And neither team
can be called superior in charging,
blocking, or tackling.
Kicking Is Factor
Kicking may be an important fac
tor in Saturday's tilt. In the last
three Stanford - Washington games
played at Seattle there have been
no touchdowns. Four years ago, the
Huskies won 6-0 by two field goals,
and two years ago Stanford own in
the same way.
Al Cruver, fullback who should
cause the Redskins their greatest
worry, is an excellent place-kicker.
The teams are about even in punt
ing.
Paulman Still Out
Bill Paulman is still bothered by
his shoulder, which was dislocated
two weeks ago, and will be used
against Washington only if he is
needed to do some kicking. But Pete
Fay showed i - emarkable perform
ance booting the ball against U.C.
L.A.
The Huskies will depend to a great
extent on a tricky short-side attack
they used to deceive Washington
State linemen last Saturday. The
Farm gridders are practicing daily
against Washington plays and should
be able to handle the northerners'
attack.
Indian Ends Are Better
Grant Stone, Irv Cummings, and
Bill Willard should each make a
better performance on the flanks
than any Washington ends.
Indian tackles are superior, but
Pete Zagar may not be able to live
up to his good reputation. He was
out of practice most of last week, and
will get very little in the next several
days.
Huskies Are Big
Washington has a distinct lead
Aver Stanford in size and speed, and
although Coffis and Fay are better
tafety men than Wascowitz and
Johnson, the Huskies have shown
better protection for ball-carriers in
punt returns.
Neil Rasmussen, who sprained his
ankle a week ago, was still unable
to take part in practice, and it is
doubtful whether he will be used at
Seattle.
The Big Red Machine will go
through its last practice session
Thursday afternoon and then hop the
north-bound train.
Telegraph Hill, famous San Fran
cisco landmark, is so called because
in early days news of a ship's arrival
was flashed from its summit by he
liograph.
We may win Saturday—if it does
n't rain.
