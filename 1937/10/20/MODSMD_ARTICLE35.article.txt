### 
FAY'S KICKING
SUCCESS REVEALED
Dr. Jack Tufts, Stanford graduate
and former rugby star, came across
with an excellent suggestion that
should at least be tried. It sounds
swell and the chances are it would
really work.
Dr. Tufts believes that if Dink
Templeton would teach Stanford
backfield men the intricate art of
kicking between seasons, the Big
Red Machine would be in posses
sion of the best punting on the
Coast at all times.
I think he has something there.
Dr. Tufts is behind Pete Fay's sen
sational overnight transformation
into a kicker. Fay didn't do any
punting on the frosh team and had
n't done any on the varsity up to
the time of the U.C.L.A. game,
when you remember he stepped up
and booted 'em out 70 yards with
great consistency. It so happens that
Dr. Tufts and Pete are good friends,
and the doctor gave Fay pointers
on kicking between .seasons.
TUFTS DID A
LITTLE POLE VAULTING
Dr. Tufts entered Stanford some
where around 1912 as the best rugby
prospect ever to come to the Farm.
He proved it in his freshman year,
but never did go out for the varsity.
He went out for the varsity track
team and did 12 feet 1 inch in the
pole vault, which was as good as
14 feet in those days.
Templeton was one of the great
est punters the country has ever
seen. What worked for Fay might
prove true of other Stanford kick
ers—if a man like Dink were to
teach them.
Reports are drifting in from the
northland that this boy Al Cruver,
fullback for the Huskies, is prac
tically the whole Washington foot
ball team. If he can play the whole
game against Stanford Saturday,
the Indians wlil be in for plenty of
trouble. If Cruver plays little or no
ball Saturday, Tiny's chances of
whipping the defending conference
champs will be considerably bright
ened.
WINK SAYS CRUVER
15 THE BIG SHOT
Winkelman, back from scouting
the Huskies' tie with Washington
State, says Jimmy Phelan's outfit is
an entirely different ball club with
Cruver in the line-up. He played
only a few minutes against the
Cougars, which may account for
that tie.
The Husky line is considerably
weaker than it was last year
through the season to the Rose
; when the Huskies marched
Bowl.
There used to be a time when a
football trip north by a Stanford
team meant intensive praying on
the part of coaches and players that
I the elements would be kind. That
! was in the days of the straight
Warner system when the Cards de
pended upon double pass plays,
tricky reverses, and the like.
Today the threat of rain doesn't
bother Tiny in the least. The In
dians can play just about the same
kind of ball whether it's on a rain
soaked field or a sun-baked turf.

ers—if a man like Dink were to
teach them.
Reports are drifting in from the
northland that this boy Al Cruver,
fullback for the Huskies, is prac
tically the whole Washington foot
ball team. If he can play the whole
game against Stanford Saturday,
the Indians wlil be in for plenty of
trouble. If Cruver plays little or no
ball Saturday, Tiny's chances of
whipping the defending conference
champs will be considerably bright
ened.
WINK SAYS CRUVER
15 THE BIG SHOT
Winkelman, back from scouting
the Huskies' tie with Washington
State, says Jimmy Phelan's outfit is
an entirely different ball club with
Cruver in the line-up. He played
only a few minutes against the
Cougars, which may account for
that tie.
The Husky line is considerably
weaker than it was last year
through the season to the Rose
; when the Huskies marched
Bowl.
There used to be a time when a
football trip north by a Stanford
team meant intensive praying on
the part of coaches and players that
I the elements would be kind. That
! was in the days of the straight
Warner system when the Cards de
pended upon double pass plays,
tricky reverses, and the like.
Today the threat of rain doesn't
bother Tiny in the least. The In
dians can play just about the same
kind of ball whether it's on a rain
soaked field or a sun-baked turf.

FAY'S KICKING
SUCCESS REVEALED
Dr. Jack Tufts, Stanford graduate
and former rugby star, came across
with an excellent suggestion that
should at least be tried. It sounds
swell and the chances are it would
really work.
Dr. Tufts believes that if Dink
Templeton would teach Stanford
backfield men the intricate art of
kicking between seasons, the Big
Red Machine would be in posses
sion of the best punting on the
Coast at all times.
I think he has something there.
Dr. Tufts is behind Pete Fay's sen
sational overnight transformation
into a kicker. Fay didn't do any
punting on the frosh team and had
n't done any on the varsity up to
the time of the U.C.L.A. game,
when you remember he stepped up
and booted 'em out 70 yards with
great consistency. It so happens that
Dr. Tufts and Pete are good friends,
and the doctor gave Fay pointers
on kicking between .seasons.
TUFTS DID A
LITTLE POLE VAULTING
Dr. Tufts entered Stanford some
where around 1912 as the best rugby
prospect ever to come to the Farm.
He proved it in his freshman year,
but never did go out for the varsity.
He went out for the varsity track
team and did 12 feet 1 inch in the
pole vault, which was as good as
14 feet in those days.
Templeton was one of the great
est punters the country has ever
seen. What worked for Fay might
prove true of other Stanford kick
ers—if a man like Dink were to
teach them.
Reports are drifting in from the
northland that this boy Al Cruver,
fullback for the Huskies, is prac
