# Eating Clubs To Entertain Encina Men
## 
### 
Stanford eating clubs will be
swamped tonight by 137 freshmen,
when the former play host to the
Class of '41 at a joint dinner and
smoker.
Frosh will be met at Encina and
escorted to the clubs for dinner, after
which they will visit rooms in Toyon
Hall and attend a smoker in their
honor. They are advised by Harry
Horton, in charge of the dinner, to
make sure of their meeting places
and to be there on time.
Freshmen are urged by Dick
Clarke, in charge of the smoker,
to take advantage of the interval
between the dinner and the smoker
to look around Toyon Hall and see
its rooms and facilities.
