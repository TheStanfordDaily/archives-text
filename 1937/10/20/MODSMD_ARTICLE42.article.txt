## Ex Committee Begins the Epitaph 
### 
LAST night the mills of student government
began to grind on a little matter which has
chafed Stanford undergraduates for some time,
has fumed through these columns enough, and
has popped in Library Director Nathan Van Pat
ten's face often, but not often enough to con
vince.
Last night Ex Committee signed the death
warrant for what was beginning to be an un
wanted Stanford tradition —the library gripe.
With the appointment of a committee headed
by Tom Killefer the machinery which is student
government, often criticized and sometimes in
adequate, began to turn toward the specific type
of problem for which it is designed—the ascer
taining of student wishes, and the enactment or
presentation of same to the University admin
istration. The Administration has created it for
that purpose. It is a soundingboard.
This afternoon that committee of Killefer, John
Dern, and Jan North will march into the offices
of Director Van Patten and the gears will click

and turn while a down-to-earth discussion of
week-end library hours goes on.
During the next week there will be more
conferences, perhaps a poll, more discussion,
editorials in minimum, argument, news stories —
all of which will be bearable if the outcome is
definite and final.
This must be the idealistic case in which the
gears keep turning despite the wrenches that
slip in, and in which they finally pulverize and
examine the problem so thoroughly that the end
product will be the right one.
We believe the right one is a library open on
Sunday nights.
If we are wrong, make the evidence so defi
nite that we, and those v/ho are wrong with us,
will bury the hope of Sunday night libe for
good.
Future Daily editors may curse the loss of the
libe lament. We hope they do.
And may Mr. Van Patten dwell in peace for
ever.
