JTx. least they may if courses which have
been organized in several New York State uni
versities fulfill the purpose for which they were
designed — that of making war repugnant to
American students.
Presented as a prerequisite for graduation, the
courses offer comprehensive coverage of cultu
ral, sociological, economic, and political effects
of war on modern civilization and are planned
to give the student an understanding of the un
derlying significance of contemporary militaris
tic trends.
Education against war is nothing new, but the
technique employed in New York's courses is
a refreshing deviation from the usual run of
anti-war argument.
For years the popular form of anti-war propa
ganda has been gore. Blood and thunder sadism
has lost its initial sting as a pacifist weapon.
After several years of Hearst's sensationalized
war pictures, and news reels of mangled Chi
nese soldiers floating in a ditch, the American
public is somewhat steeled for the next bomb
shattered corpse.
Realizing this, other universities might fol
low the lead of the New York institutions and
revolutionize pacifist propaganda methods. By
offering logical criticism of the absurd waste
and long-lasting aftermath of military cam
paigns, the apathy of some smug "Americans"
might be overthrown.
Intelligent instruction, not individualized
boondoggling, might easily put an end to the
sporadic militarism which haunts some Eastern
universities, and which is the eternal bugaboo
of sincere pacifists.
The intelligent study of cause and effect of
war, of social, political, and economic factors
involved in the present crises in Spain and
China, of what would happen socially, eco
nomically and politically if America were

drawn into a war—all of these matters might
be touched in a single course and discussed
with an eye to their interrelation.
Such a course would give the American uni
versity student other and more adequate rea
sons for hating war than the mere revulsion to
gore. Instead of the present emotionalism rep
resented by peace movements, pacifism could
be put on an intelligent, critical basis—might
even be a science.
It is because of this ultimate goal that Stan
ford—where almost no militaristic sentiment ex
ists —might find a course in "Anti War" both
popular and edifying.—J. R.

tic trends.
Education against war is nothing new, but the
technique employed in New York's courses is
a refreshing deviation from the usual run of
anti-war argument.
For years the popular form of anti-war propa
ganda has been gore. Blood and thunder sadism
has lost its initial sting as a pacifist weapon.
After several years of Hearst's sensationalized
war pictures, and news reels of mangled Chi
nese soldiers floating in a ditch, the American
public is somewhat steeled for the next bomb
shattered corpse.
Realizing this, other universities might fol
low the lead of the New York institutions and
revolutionize pacifist propaganda methods. By
offering logical criticism of the absurd waste
and long-lasting aftermath of military cam
paigns, the apathy of some smug "Americans"
might be overthrown.
Intelligent instruction, not individualized
boondoggling, might easily put an end to the
sporadic militarism which haunts some Eastern
universities, and which is the eternal bugaboo
of sincere pacifists.
The intelligent study of cause and effect of
war, of social, political, and economic factors
involved in the present crises in Spain and
China, of what would happen socially, eco
nomically and politically if America were

drawn into a war—all of these matters might
be touched in a single course and discussed
with an eye to their interrelation.
Such a course would give the American uni
versity student other and more adequate rea
sons for hating war than the mere revulsion to
gore. Instead of the present emotionalism rep
resented by peace movements, pacifism could
be put on an intelligent, critical basis—might
even be a science.
It is because of this ultimate goal that Stan

popular and edifying.—J. R.
