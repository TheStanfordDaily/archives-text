d I ONNOISSEURS of vague murmurings and dark
* comments report that campus right-wingers have
been turning out some very fine specimens ever since
last week-end, when a student committee was formed
to assist in giving medical aid to Spanish Loyalists.
Two local doctors, it seems, are about to leave for
Spain, backed by a national bureau; and the Stanford
committee intends to help finance a local ward in the
doctor's unit. This provides a charming storm center
for the windy comments of our pro-rebels.
But the real grounds on which the project is open
to criticism are not mentioned in the savage remarks
about "communism" that catapult out between clenched
teeth. There is a difference between sending medical
aid to Loyalists and bombing the Chapel; and even
the most caustic comparisons are worthless as argu
ment. The important question is whether or not Amer
icans can stand to see their doctors in Spain kicked
around, possibly killed.
* # * #
It is a very fine and commendable thing to send
doctors and medicine to Spain; barring the fact that
there are undoubtedly- axes of various sizes and
models being ground, the project is a humane and
philanthropic one. And if Americans are willing to
send over willing doctors and let them take their
chances, the plan deserves all the support we can
give it.
The question is, will Americans do this, or will an
"accident" to one of the doctors set us shouting for
vengeance on the bloody Fascists, Italians, Germans
(take your pick). It is very fine indeed for altruistic
doctors to risk their lives to help the suffering Span
iards; but it is definitely their war, not ours. If our
aid, no matter how humane, is likely to haul us into
the scrap, we had better collect a fund to keep
doctors at home.
* * * *
IF press association reports can be credited, the
Spanish have declared an open season on non
combatants. And in that case there is a very good
chance that some near-sighted aviator will spill a
load of bombs in our little local ward. Presumably
the doctors know what they are risking. But if the
doctors should lose on their gamble, there is a possi
bility that our sensitive "national honor" would rise
up in sacred wrath, and demand that we smite the
evil-doers.
And so, if we want to send physicians to Spain
without risking a compulsory trip there ourselves, we
will have to make it plain that they go at their own
risk. If we can't do this, the best thing is to keep
them home. It may be heartless, but it is considerably
better to let the Spaniards manage their own war
than it is to broad-jump into the middle of it.

committee intends to help finance a local ward in the
doctor's unit. This provides a charming storm center
for the windy comments of our pro-rebels.
But the real grounds on which the project is open
to criticism are not mentioned in the savage remarks
about "communism" that catapult out between clenched
teeth. There is a difference between sending medical
aid to Loyalists and bombing the Chapel; and even
the most caustic comparisons are worthless as argu
ment. The important question is whether or not Amer
icans can stand to see their doctors in Spain kicked
around, possibly killed.

It is a very fine and commendable thing to send
doctors and medicine to Spain; barring the fact that
there are undoubtedly- axes of various sizes and
models being ground, the project is a humane and
philanthropic one. And if Americans are willing to
send over willing doctors and let them take their
chances, the plan deserves all the support we can
give it.
The question is, will Americans do this, or will an
"accident" to one of the doctors set us shouting for
vengeance on the bloody Fascists, Italians, Germans
(take your pick). It is very fine indeed for altruistic
doctors to risk their lives to help the suffering Span
iards; but it is definitely their war, not ours. If our
aid, no matter how humane, is likely to haul us into
the scrap, we had better collect a fund to keep
doctors at home.
* * * *
IF press association reports can be credited, the
Spanish have declared an open season on non
combatants. And in that case there is a very good
chance that some near-sighted aviator will spill a
load of bombs in our little local ward. Presumably
the doctors know what they are risking. But if the
doctors should lose on their gamble, there is a possi
bility that our sensitive "national honor" would rise
up in sacred wrath, and demand that we smite the
evil-doers.
And so, if we want to send physicians to Spain
without risking a compulsory trip there ourselves, we
will have to make it plain that they go at their own
risk. If we can't do this, the best thing is to keep
them home. It may be heartless, but it is considerably
better to let the Spaniards manage their own war
than it is to broad-jump into the middle of it.
