# GOIN' MY WAY

### 
JT'S getting so that you can't wave a stick at a radio
these days without some variety show band swing
ing into a Victor Herbert medley. It appears that every
company who wants to promote Bilkin's Hair Re
storer gathers together a ldt of musicians, a latter-day
comedian, and any assorted Hollywood stars in need
of a little stray publicity, and presto, you have a show.
Not that some of them aren't tops in entertainment.
But on the other hand, it allows would-be Louella
Parsonses (and the original) to play havoc with the
air-lanes. This season is'no exception, though they do
say that Hollywood Hotel, grand-daddy of them all,
may finally be handed a first-class ticket on the
skids.
* * * *
Practically all of last winter's radiosyncracies are
back. Leading newcomer is that "enfant terrible"
Charley McCarthy, whose star reached the ascension
this summer. Chief old boy whose absence for the
last few years may have caused you grief is Phil
Baker, and his stooges, Beetle and Bottle. But the
old guard, Benny, Allen, and all the rest are hitting
on all six tubes.
Second current trend seems to be in the realm of
music, with more and more programs featuring popu
lar name bands, on the one hand, and fine symphony
orchestras on the other.
* * * *
'J'HE cigarette companies are indeed coming into
their own, with each year bringing more of their
programs to the studios. Take Chesterfield for in
stance. For the football fans they give a sportcast
Thursday and Saturday, with Paul Douglas and Eddie
Dooley reckoning up betting odds and final scores.
Then for the young bloods, they offer Hal Kemp and
Alice Faye's excellent musical co-operation on Friday
night. And for the more elegant tastes, Wednesday
night brings Andre Kostelanetz and a host of fine
guest stars (such as Flagstad, Iturbi, Spaulding, and
others of their acknowledged class), with Deems
Taylor as commentator. With this layout they should
be able to make smokers (pardon me, Chesterfield
smokers—adv.) of everyone from Joe the Janitor
(who can tell you in a few brief volumes just why
Alleghenny Seminary will wipe up the walk with
Hemmings-Chafingdish Tech) to Colonel Pottersby-
Pottersby and the Duchess (who can tell you what
the bassoons are saying in that delightful Chopin
suite for bass-drum and full zither ensemble).
And, lest we be accused of partisanship, the other
ciggie efforts are almost as extensive. Camels have
instituted what they call a "double bill" with Jack
Oakie and his College, and Benny Goodman's Swing
School, Tuesday nights.
♦ * * *
This double bill idea shows the perversion of the
movies, but might turn out to be just what the adver
tisers are looking for. For example, suppose they had
the first feature aimed at a popular audience—with
swing bands, funnymen, and all such trappings. And
the second feature offering fine music by a fine orches
tra. But God help us, if the kiddie programs get the
idea. When the combination of Orphan Annie, and
Chandu, the Magician, becomes a reality, we check
out. We like Orphan Annie.

of a little stray publicity, and presto, you have a show.
Not that some of them aren't tops in entertainment.
But on the other hand, it allows would-be Louella
Parsonses (and the original) to play havoc with the
air-lanes. This season is'no exception, though they do
say that Hollywood Hotel, grand-daddy of them all,
may finally be handed a first-class ticket on the

Practically all of last winter's radiosyncracies are
back. Leading newcomer is that "enfant terrible"
Charley McCarthy, whose star reached the ascension
this summer. Chief old boy whose absence for the
last few years may have caused you grief is Phil
Baker, and his stooges, Beetle and Bottle. But the
old guard, Benny, Allen, and all the rest are hitting
on all six tubes.
Second current trend seems to be in the realm of
music, with more and more programs featuring popu
lar name bands, on the one hand, and fine symphony
orchestras on the other.

'J'HE cigarette companies are indeed coming into
their own, with each year bringing more of their
programs to the studios. Take Chesterfield for in
stance. For the football fans they give a sportcast
Thursday and Saturday, with Paul Douglas and Eddie
Dooley reckoning up betting odds and final scores.
Then for the young bloods, they offer Hal Kemp and
Alice Faye's excellent musical co-operation on Friday
night. And for the more elegant tastes, Wednesday
night brings Andre Kostelanetz and a host of fine
guest stars (such as Flagstad, Iturbi, Spaulding, and
others of their acknowledged class), with Deems
Taylor as commentator. With this layout they should
be able to make smokers (pardon me, Chesterfield
smokers—adv.) of everyone from Joe the Janitor
(who can tell you in a few brief volumes just why
Alleghenny Seminary will wipe up the walk with
Hemmings-Chafingdish Tech) to Colonel Pottersby-
Pottersby and the Duchess (who can tell you what
the bassoons are saying in that delightful Chopin
suite for bass-drum and full zither ensemble).
And, lest we be accused of partisanship, the other
ciggie efforts are almost as extensive. Camels have
instituted what they call a "double bill" with Jack
Oakie and his College, and Benny Goodman's Swing
School, Tuesday nights.

This double bill idea shows the perversion of the
movies, but might turn out to be just what the adver
tisers are looking for. For example, suppose they had
the first feature aimed at a popular audience—with
swing bands, funnymen, and all such trappings. And
the second feature offering fine music by a fine orches
tra. But God help us, if the kiddie programs get the
idea. When the combination of Orphan Annie, and
Chandu, the Magician, becomes a reality, we check
out. We like Orphan Annie.
JT'S getting so that you can't wave a stick at a radio
these days without some variety show band swing
ing into a Victor Herbert medley. It appears that every
company who wants to promote Bilkin's Hair Re

of a little stray publicity, and presto, you have a show.
