# Third Series Of '8:30' Plays Proves Best
## 
### 
With the most brilliantly con
ceived and written of the whole
nine-play cycle, "Tonight at 8:30"
enter its third week at the Curran,
restoring one's slightly - shaken
faith in Mr. Coward's general abil
ity to entertain and affording the
audience one of those rare but per
sistent indications that he may have

something up his
sleeve besides
epigrams.
Midway between
"We Were Danc
ing," a fragmen
tary comment on
the effects of time
on love at first
sight, and "Red
Peppers," a brief
and satirical study
of minor vaude-

villians, comes "The Astonished
Heart," Mr. Coward's tersely poig
nant survey of the dangers which
lurk in dark corners waiting for re
pressed psychiatrists.
Psychiatrist Dying
When the curtain rises the psy
chiatrist's wife and his two co
workers are on stage, waiting. Grad
ually it becomes clear what they are
waiting for, and why the dominant
mood is one of such nervous intens
ity. In the next room the psy
chiatrist lies dying; and in a few
moments the woman he is calling
for in his delirium is going to enter.
As the butler announces her, the
wife turns to the secretaries and
uttex's the most effective curtain-line
in many a long day.
Affair Retraced
"Do you remember?" she says,
struck suddenly by the similarity of
this situation to one in the past.
"We were standing just like this
a year ago, the first time she came
into this room."
The four scenes which follow trace
the course of the psychiatrist's first
meeting with his wife's school friend,
Lenore, unfolding of his love for
her, which passes gradually into
near-madness as her deliberate in
fatuation for him begins to evapo
rate. His wife's futile attempt to
restore his balance only seems to
aggravate his terror of the pre
dicament in which he finds himself,
and after keeping the audience on
edge for three endless minutes he
throws himself from a window to
the pavement below.
Acting Effective
The sixth and last scene opens
where the first ended, with the
butler gravely announcing, "Mrs.
Vail!" Lenore enters, goes into the
sick-room, and in a moment comes
out with the tragically ironic in
formation that the dying man
thought she was his wife, and had
died with his wife's name on his
lips.
Bramwell Fletcher does his best
job to date as the harassed Chris
tian. The fascinating Estelle Win
wood is superb as his understand
ing wife, and Helen Chandler re
veals unexpected dramatic feeling
as Lenore.
"Wc Were Dancing" is so slight
as to be practically negligible, al
though Miss Winwood makes the
most of what honors there are.
"Red Peppers," with Jessie Royce
Landis as guest star, is light and
bright, ending inconclusively as do
most of these playlets. But the eve
ning includes "The Astonished
Heart"; and that justifies a great
deal.

workers are on stage, waiting. Grad
ually it becomes clear what they are
waiting for, and why the dominant
mood is one of such nervous intens
ity. In the next room the psy
chiatrist lies dying; and in a few
moments the woman he is calling
for in his delirium is going to enter.
As the butler announces her, the
wife turns to the secretaries and
uttex's the most effective curtain-line
in many a long day.
Affair Retraced
"Do you remember?" she says,
struck suddenly by the similarity of
this situation to one in the past.
"We were standing just like this
a year ago, the first time she came
into this room."
The four scenes which follow trace
the course of the psychiatrist's first
meeting with his wife's school friend,
Lenore, unfolding of his love for
her, which passes gradually into
near-madness as her deliberate in
fatuation for him begins to evapo
rate. His wife's futile attempt to
restore his balance only seems to
aggravate his terror of the pre
dicament in which he finds himself,
and after keeping the audience on
edge for three endless minutes he
throws himself from a window to
the pavement below.
Acting Effective
The sixth and last scene opens
where the first ended, with the
butler gravely announcing, "Mrs.
Vail!" Lenore enters, goes into the
sick-room, and in a moment comes
out with the tragically ironic in
formation that the dying man
thought she was his wife, and had
died with his wife's name on his
lips.
Bramwell Fletcher does his best
job to date as the harassed Chris
tian. The fascinating Estelle Win
wood is superb as his understand
ing wife, and Helen Chandler re
veals unexpected dramatic feeling
as Lenore.
"Wc Were Dancing" is so slight
as to be practically negligible, al
though Miss Winwood makes the
most of what honors there are.
"Red Peppers," with Jessie Royce
Landis as guest star, is light and
bright, ending inconclusively as do
most of these playlets. But the eve
ning includes "The Astonished
Heart"; and that justifies a great
deal.
