# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE ART, PLEASE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For a change here is a compliment
for a member of your staff—for the
secret Mr. Thompson who works up
those swell cax*toons on the football
position. His stuff is excellent and
he deserves lots of credit for the
good work.
Also, how about more pictures in
the paper? Remember last year's
Tabloid; it was real fun for some of
us less intellectuals—l don't mean
a change of policy—just more pic
tures.
