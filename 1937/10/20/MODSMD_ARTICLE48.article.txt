The Editor, Sir:
As Mr. Rodriguez puts it, with
"An American" I am disgusted, with
Mr. Rodriguez I am amazed, and
with Mr. Cobbs I am amused.
"An American" seems to know a
lot about professors, students, bor
ing within, and the truth about
Spain. He also knows a lot about
Mr. Rodriguez. But in reading his
Letter of the fourteenth I found no
attempt at proving his many dam
aging assertions.
There are two ways to be dog
matic and offensive. One is to say
something louder than anyone else
can shout, and the other is to say
your say anonymously. I need not
comment on his method beyond
saying it is the better way of avoid
ing trouble.
He couldn't, if lie had to, prove
his generalities concerning "degre
dation of youth" at the univer
sity, or "new beliefs slyly being
taught" to the students of the
university. Since he doesn't speci
fy Stanford, I won't either. Fur
ther, I doubt that he could prove
the law and order being brought
to Spain by "Fascist sword-rat
tling" to he a law with any legal
foundation, or that such a law and
order is thej ust dessert of the
Spanish people. Also, I'd far rath
er be a "tool in the hands of pro
fessors" than a fool at the hands
of the American Legion.
* "An American" thanks God that
we have the American Legion and
fhe D. A. R., but neither he, the
American Legion, nor the D.A.R. is
going to sit by and thank God, if
"this growing spirit of radicalism"
continues. I'm afraid they will be
rather inclined toward damning
Him and taking matters out of His
hands into their own. After that
they will thank God that they did,

and our American institutions will
stand for another "time immemo
rial" (about 150 years).
With the nerve and foolishness
of Mr. Rodriguez I am amazed.
To broadcast the strength of one's
cell to the American Legion is
indeed foolhardy, for the good old
American Legion likes to eat lit
tle Communist cells with all their
busy little termites asleep inside
them.
With Mr. Cobbs I am amused. If,
as Mr. Cobbs says, Mr. Rodriguez is
distinctly inferior to Chesterfield as
a letter writer, then I don't know
where to put Mr. Cobbs. He should
be told that the cardinal sin of let
ter writing is that of misquoting.
I think he will find that Mr. Rodri
guez says nothing about "reducing,"
but does use the word "ridiculing."

fhe D. A. R., but neither he, the
American Legion, nor the D.A.R. is
going to sit by and thank God, if
"this growing spirit of radicalism"
continues. I'm afraid they will be
rather inclined toward damning
Him and taking matters out of His
hands into their own. After that
they will thank God that they did,

and our American institutions will
stand for another "time immemo
rial" (about 150 years).
With the nerve and foolishness
of Mr. Rodriguez I am amazed.
To broadcast the strength of one's
cell to the American Legion is
indeed foolhardy, for the good old
American Legion likes to eat lit
tle Communist cells with all their
busy little termites asleep inside
them.
With Mr. Cobbs I am amused. If,
as Mr. Cobbs says, Mr. Rodriguez is
distinctly inferior to Chesterfield as
a letter writer, then I don't know
where to put Mr. Cobbs. He should
be told that the cardinal sin of let
ter writing is that of misquoting.
I think he will find that Mr. Rodri
guez says nothing about "reducing,"
but does use the word "ridiculing."

The Editor, Sir:
As Mr. Rodriguez puts it, with
"An American" I am disgusted, with
Mr. Rodriguez I am amazed, and
with Mr. Cobbs I am amused.
"An American" seems to know a
lot about professors, students, bor
ing within, and the truth about
Spain. He also knows a lot about
Mr. Rodriguez. But in reading his
Letter of the fourteenth I found no
attempt at proving his many dam
aging assertions.
There are two ways to be dog
matic and offensive. One is to say
something louder than anyone else
can shout, and the other is to say
your say anonymously. I need not
comment on his method beyond
saying it is the better way of avoid
ing trouble.
He couldn't, if lie had to, prove
his generalities concerning "degre
dation of youth" at the univer
sity, or "new beliefs slyly being
taught" to the students of the
university. Since he doesn't speci
fy Stanford, I won't either. Fur
ther, I doubt that he could prove
the law and order being brought
to Spain by "Fascist sword-rat
tling" to he a law with any legal
foundation, or that such a law and
order is thej ust dessert of the
Spanish people. Also, I'd far rath
er be a "tool in the hands of pro
fessors" than a fool at the hands
of the American Legion.
* "An American" thanks God that
we have the American Legion and
fhe D. A. R., but neither he, the
