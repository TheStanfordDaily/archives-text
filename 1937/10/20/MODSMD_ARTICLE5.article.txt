# Wilbur Praises Mothers' Club
## Mrs. Branner Granted Life Membership 
### 
A life membership in the Moth
ers' Club was presented to Mrs. J. C.
Branner by Mrs. E. K. Strong, state
vice-president of the P.T.A., at a
meeting of the club yesterday. This
is an honorary gesture, which ac
tually means that the club will con
tribute $25 in Mrs. Bi'anner's name
to a state scholarship fund.
Thanks were given to the club by
Px-esident Ray Lyman Wilbur for
its help in solving the human prob
lems of students which, he said, are
often mox-e important than class
room problems and more significant
in determining the future worth of
students.
The business meeting was fol
lowed by a program conducted by
Px-ofessor Lee Emerson Bassett,
guest speaker, who introduced War
ren D. Allen of the music depart
ment and members of the speech
and drama depax*tments, who dis
cussed the work and pux*poses of
their classes.
Thomas Wood Stevens, new addi
tion to the staff, stressed the differ
ence between the purposes of the
Community Playhouse and the Uni
versity Theater groups. "The Palo
Alto theater provides Bi*oadway
plays, current drama," he said, "but
it is up to the university to use the
important plays of the past."
