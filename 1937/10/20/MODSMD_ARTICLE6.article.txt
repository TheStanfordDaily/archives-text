# G-Man Speaks At Tuesday Lecture

### 
"We're not gunmen, but we do
know how to shoot and so long as we
do we're going to have less shoot
ing."
So said N. J. L. Pieper, admin
istrative assistant to J. Edgar Hoover,
chief of the G-Men, last night in Me
morial Hall during the regular Tues
day night lecture sponsored by the
Committee on Public Exercises.
Pieper cited the case of one crim
inal who refused to shoot it out with
the federal men because, as he said,
"You know how to shoot better than
we do." He stated that so long as
this fear of the law exists, there will
be less crime.
Pieper emphasized the scientific
approach to criminal hunting, and
explained in detail the working of
the crime laboratory. He said, "There
isn't any such thing as a perfect
crime. We miss some evidence, but
when we do get it, there is virtually
nothing that the laboratory could not
deduce."
