# Crew Moves Dead From Plane Wreck
## Crash Scatters Debris Over 100 Feet, Kills Nineteen Immediately 
### 
EVANSTON, Wyo., Oct. 19 (UP).
—The tedious work of bringing 19
bodies over 37 miles of rough and
frozen mountain trdil from the
wreck of a giant United Air Lines
transport plane in the Uinta Moun
tains began late today.
The victims, four women — one
who was to have given birth to a
child in a few days—and 15 men,
were being brought to an under
taker's establishment here.
Trip To Take Hours
Ground cx - ews said it would take
hours to make the trip. High in
the timbered, wild range where the
immense air liner smashed into a
mountain side, 14 miles off its
course, it was bitterly cold.
Some of the way down from the
heights to the little town of Knight,
Wyo., was over trailless slopes. The
snow was deep in places. Rescuers
were obliged to make dangerous
descents, again to climb rock-strewn
ridges.
The first x-escue crew reached the
wrecked plane late last night. Hours
later they returned to Knight to re
port that all passengers and crew
were dead. Eighteen bodies had been
hurled through a gaping hole in
the pilot's cockpit. They were scat
tered about the wreck for a hun
dred feet. In the cockpit was one
crushed body. Identification was
expected to be difficult in some
cases.
Motors Tossed 100 Yards
The big ship, officials reported,
had smashed head-on into the
rocky slope. Its motors were rip
ped loose by the terrific impact and
hurled one hundred yards. The
fuselage was torn open, twisted and
smashed.
Ground crews gathered parts of
the ship in the hope that an exami
nation may determine the cause of
the disaster. Five representatives of
the Department of Air Commerce
were on hand to take charge of the
gathering of evidence for the official
investigation.
The last word from Pilot Earle
Woodgerd of the ill-fated ship was
that he was flying "by intermittent
instruments." This came Sunday
night to Salt Lake City airport, less
than half an hour before the plane
was to have landed there.

nation may determine the cause of
the disaster. Five representatives of
the Department of Air Commerce
were on hand to take charge of the
gathering of evidence for the official
investigation.
The last word from Pilot Earle
Woodgerd of the ill-fated ship was
that he was flying "by intermittent
instruments." This came Sunday
night to Salt Lake City airport, less
than half an hour before the plane
was to have landed there.
EVANSTON, Wyo., Oct. 19 (UP).
—The tedious work of bringing 19
bodies over 37 miles of rough and
frozen mountain trdil from the
wreck of a giant United Air Lines
transport plane in the Uinta Moun
tains began late today.
The victims, four women — one
who was to have given birth to a
child in a few days—and 15 men,
were being brought to an under
taker's establishment here.
Trip To Take Hours
Ground cx - ews said it would take
hours to make the trip. High in
the timbered, wild range where the
immense air liner smashed into a
mountain side, 14 miles off its
course, it was bitterly cold.
Some of the way down from the
heights to the little town of Knight,
Wyo., was over trailless slopes. The
snow was deep in places. Rescuers
were obliged to make dangerous
descents, again to climb rock-strewn
ridges.
The first x-escue crew reached the
wrecked plane late last night. Hours
later they returned to Knight to re
port that all passengers and crew
were dead. Eighteen bodies had been
hurled through a gaping hole in
the pilot's cockpit. They were scat
tered about the wreck for a hun
dred feet. In the cockpit was one
crushed body. Identification was
expected to be difficult in some
cases.
Motors Tossed 100 Yards
The big ship, officials reported,
had smashed head-on into the
rocky slope. Its motors were rip
ped loose by the terrific impact and
hurled one hundred yards. The
fuselage was torn open, twisted and
smashed.
Ground crews gathered parts of
the ship in the hope that an exami
nation may determine the cause of
the disaster. Five representatives of
the Department of Air Commerce
were on hand to take charge of the
gathering of evidence for the official
investigation.
