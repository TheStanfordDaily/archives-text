# Library Poll Authorized By A.S.S.U.
## Special Vote To He Held Next Week To Keep Libe Open Sundays 
### BILL MILLIS 
A student vote on the question of
opening the Stanford library regu
larly on Sunday nights will be held
in the library next Thursday and
Friday, October 28 and 29.
This decision was announced last
night by A.S.S.U. President Tom
Killefer, following a conference yes
terday afternoon in which Killefer,
Jan North, and John Dern, repre
senting the student body, threshed
out the problem of library hours
with Library Director Nathan Van
Patten.
Short Ballot
Reason for the delay of several
days in holding the vote. Killefer
explained, is to allow time for print
ing the ballots and for arranging
technical details of the election.
Present plans are to have only
two or three questions on the bal
lots, relating to student preference
on opening the library on Sunday
nights and on the actual use that it
would have at that time.
Vote in Li be
Voting for the special election will
be held in the library, with library
officials in charge, and not on the
Quad, so that the wishes of actual
library users can be determined.
Names of voters will be checked off
on bawlouts, as in regular elections.
"In no case will the library close
on Friday nights," Director Van Pat
ten stated following the conference
yesterday. The reason for this, he
indicated recently, is that the library
is now used widely on Friday nights
by faculty members and graduate
students.
History Told
If the outcome of next week's
special election proves favorable to
opening the library Sunday nights,
the question must then be given
final consideration by the university
administration and the Board of
Trustees.
Of sporadic interest over a period
of several years, plans for opening
the library for those hours were re
vived following an editorial in The
Daily and a straw poll in which 404
votes were cast for Sunday night
library hours and compared to 52
for Friday night.
A.S.S.U. Poll Urged
Director Van Patten suggested
that the A.S.S.U. was the proper
body to determine accurate student
opinion on the question.
Ex Committee considered the
matter at length at its meeting this
week, and authorized Killefer, Dern,
and Miss North to present plans for
a special poll to Van Patten.

the library for those hours were re
vived following an editorial in The
Daily and a straw poll in which 404
votes were cast for Sunday night
library hours and compared to 52
for Friday night.
A.S.S.U. Poll Urged
Director Van Patten suggested
that the A.S.S.U. was the proper
body to determine accurate student
opinion on the question.
Ex Committee considered the
matter at length at its meeting this
week, and authorized Killefer, Dern,
and Miss North to present plans for
a special poll to Van Patten.
A student vote on the question of
opening the Stanford library regu
larly on Sunday nights will be held
in the library next Thursday and
Friday, October 28 and 29.
This decision was announced last
night by A.S.S.U. President Tom
Killefer, following a conference yes
terday afternoon in which Killefer,
Jan North, and John Dern, repre
senting the student body, threshed
out the problem of library hours
with Library Director Nathan Van
Patten.
Short Ballot
Reason for the delay of several
days in holding the vote. Killefer
explained, is to allow time for print
ing the ballots and for arranging
technical details of the election.
Present plans are to have only
two or three questions on the bal
lots, relating to student preference
on opening the library on Sunday
nights and on the actual use that it
would have at that time.
Vote in Li be
Voting for the special election will
be held in the library, with library
officials in charge, and not on the
Quad, so that the wishes of actual
library users can be determined.
Names of voters will be checked off
on bawlouts, as in regular elections.
"In no case will the library close
on Friday nights," Director Van Pat
ten stated following the conference
yesterday. The reason for this, he
indicated recently, is that the library
is now used widely on Friday nights
by faculty members and graduate
students.
History Told
If the outcome of next week's
special election proves favorable to
opening the library Sunday nights,
the question must then be given
final consideration by the university
administration and the Board of
Trustees.
Of sporadic interest over a period
of several years, plans for opening
the library for those hours were re
vived following an editorial in The
Daily and a straw poll in which 404
votes were cast for Sunday night
library hours and compared to 52
for Friday night.
