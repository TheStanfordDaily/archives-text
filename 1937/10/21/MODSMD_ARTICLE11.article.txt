# Labor Conditions Criticized by Gill
## 
### 
Deplorable labor conditions on
San Joaquin Valley ranches were
cited by Sumner Gill yesterday at
Luncheon Club meeting. Gill, who
has spent four summers in the grain
harvest, first presented a picture of
a typical day in the fields. Work, he
said, was routine and monotonous,
lasting 15 hours for the day. The
heat, augmented by dust and noise
from the machine, often climbs to
121 degrees in the shade.
Moral and spiritual conditions
were just as bad as the physical op
pression, Gill declared. According
to Gill the solution for this problem
is the same as that being used for
the slums. "They should be drag
ged into the air and light."
