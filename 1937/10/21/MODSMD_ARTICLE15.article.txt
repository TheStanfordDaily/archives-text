# Killefer Describes Summer Tour
## 
### LYNNE ASHTON 
A 10-horsepower Rover with a
wooden frame, papier-mache body,
and bicycle wheels started out to
take Stanfordites Tom Killefer,
George Cannon, Ralph Kingsbury,
and the minimum of luggage on a
tour of Europe last summer.
Cannon developed pneumonia at
Oxford, not from sitting in Oxford's
draughty library, but from falling
in the Thames while watching the
Regatta. It was impossible to get a
complete statement as to what caus
ed the fall, though an attack of ver
tigo or sleeping sickness was sug
gested.
Rover Wrecks
Leaving the sick member of the
trio in an Oxford hosptial, Killefer
and Kingsbury turned the paper
nose of their Rover toward the up
per reaches of Scotland. They were
proceeding nobly when they met
something—very hard. The Rover
crumpled and collapsed in the road.
When the boys called for a tow
car, they were told the towing fee
would be greatly in excess of the
value represented by the splinters
and crumpled paper; there wasn't
anything to sell for scrap-iron.
Ride (lie Rods
"We left it there beside the road,"
Killefer remarked sadly, "without
benefit of a decent burial."
i The destruction of their paper

buggy meant, further trouble for the
already distressed pair. They had
paid for the car with the idea that
two of their fellow Stanfordites, Bill
Hanna and Bob Sherman, were to
join them in London and share in
the car's cost. The accident had de
stroyed both their transportation
and their investment. So the two
rode the rods of a London-Scottish-
Midlands train back to London.
Hanna and Sherman had mean
while arrived in England and, not
finding the others, had gone on to
Paris, bought a car, and gone to
Munich.
Take Cattle Boat
Killefer and Kingsbury took a cat
tle boat to Ostend, where they
bought second-hand bicycles and
also set out for Munich. They
"slept in haystacks and German
youth hostels for seven cents a
night, going barefoot and eating
berries by the wayside." Fortunately
the weather was warm and the ber
ries. were plentiful.
The barefoot pair joined their
friends in Munich, where they en
joyed the products of local indus
tries with Guy Nunn, Occidental
graduate who was at the University
of Munich, while they waited for
Cannon to arrive from Oxford.
Speaking of Nunn. Killefer re
marked, "He set himself the task of
drinking all the beer in Munich be

fore October, and I must say he was
succeeding beautifully when I saw
him."
Saying that Nunn had commented
upon the exhaustible supply of at
tractive girls in Munich, Killefer
said he and his friends had not en
countered any such conditions. "We
found nothing of that sort to trouble
us," he added.
Cover Map
From Munich they covered the
map so thoroughly it would be
easier to tell where they didn't go.
Killefer's tones grew reminiscent as
he named the places they had seen
— "Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg,
Rome, Naples, Capri, Pisa, the Riv
ieras, Nice, Cannes, Geneva—" and
a dozen more.
When asked what they saw be
sides scenery and haystacks, Kille
fer said, "Well, we saw all the art
centers and the Salzburg festival.
We were short of money so we did
n't get any stickers for our luggage.
War? Well, we talked to some Ital
ians who had been in Spain as vol
unteers. They said Spain was a
wreck, that there wasn't much hope
for it.
"Cannon left us early because he
had to get back for a left-handed
golf tournament. Sherman flew to
sail with him, and the rest of us
stayed in Paris a while before com
ing homp. We had a swell time."

Take Cattle Boat
Killefer and Kingsbury took a cat

"slept in haystacks and German
youth hostels for seven cents a

fore October, and I must say he was
succeeding beautifully when I saw
him."
Saying that Nunn had commented

countered any such conditions. "We
found nothing of that sort to trouble
us," he added.

tle boat to Ostend, where they
bought second-hand bicycles and
also set out for Munich. They
"slept in haystacks and German
youth hostels for seven cents a
night, going barefoot and eating
berries by the wayside." Fortunately
the weather was warm and the ber
ries. were plentiful.
The barefoot pair joined their
friends in Munich, where they en
joyed the products of local indus
tries with Guy Nunn, Occidental
graduate who was at the University
of Munich, while they waited for
Cannon to arrive from Oxford.
Speaking of Nunn. Killefer re
marked, "He set himself the task of
drinking all the beer in Munich be

fore October, and I must say he was
succeeding beautifully when I saw
him."
Saying that Nunn had commented
upon the exhaustible supply of at
tractive girls in Munich, Killefer
said he and his friends had not en
countered any such conditions. "We
found nothing of that sort to trouble
us," he added.

From Munich they covered the
map so thoroughly it would be
easier to tell where they didn't go.
Killefer's tones grew reminiscent as
he named the places they had seen
— "Budapest, Vienna, Salzburg,
Rome, Naples, Capri, Pisa, the Riv
ieras, Nice, Cannes, Geneva—" and
a dozen more.
When asked what they saw be
sides scenery and haystacks, Kille
fer said, "Well, we saw all the art
centers and the Salzburg festival.
We were short of money so we did
n't get any stickers for our luggage.
War? Well, we talked to some Ital
ians who had been in Spain as vol
unteers. They said Spain was a
wreck, that there wasn't much hope
for it.
"Cannon left us early because he
had to get back for a left-handed
golf tournament. Sherman flew to
sail with him, and the rest of us
stayed in Paris a while before com
ing homp. We had a swell time."
