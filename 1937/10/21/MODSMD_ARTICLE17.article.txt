## 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 20 (UP).â€”Bela
Kun, arch-plotter of Bolshevism,
has fallen victim of the Soviet Rus
sian "purge" that today reached
more merciless proportions than the
trail of terror which he blazed
through post-war Hungary.
The arrest of the 51-year-old
Hungarian on charges that almost
unfailingly result in death before a
Red firing squad was revealed by
the official Communist Internationale
magazine.
His arrest, based on condemna
tion of his "133 days of terror" in
Hungary 18 years ago when he had
more than 1000 persons executed,
was revealed as the killings in Dic
tator Josef V. Stalin's Russian
purge passed the 1000 mark.
