## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 20 (UP). â€”
Movie gossips preserved a prece
dent of long standing tonight by
handing Greta Garbo a suitor a few
weeks before her name is hung up
in marquee lights of the nation's
movie palaces which will show her
latest picture.
This time it was Leopold Stokow
ski, famous orchestra conductor,
who, according to the sideline ro
manticists, has wooed, won and will
wed the taciturn Swede as soon as
his present wife divorces him.
