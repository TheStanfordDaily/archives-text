### 
Agreeing on the need for some
change in the present set-up foren
sic artists from the University of
Melbourne, California, and Stanford
debated the Supreme Court ques
tion before some 200 people last
night at 7:30 o'clock in the Memorial
Theater.
Differing on the place of change,
B. W. W. Wilmot, 8.A., LL.B., globe
circling Australian, and Benjamin
Shapiro, California, and Cardinals
Gerald Marcus and Robert Hart
mann argued on the question, "Re
solved: That the power of the Fed
eral Supreme Court to declare
statutes unconstitutional should be
restricted."
Wilbur Chairman
The non-decision debate was
chairmanned by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur with Cyril Cnae, M.8.E.,
British consul in San Francisco, as
guest of honor. The double quartet
of the Men's Glee Club opened the
program.
Chester Wilmot in laying the
basis for the negative case pointed
out, "What you have to do is to get
in the habit of changing the consti
tution to meet changing needs. For
150 years you have upheld certain
principles, and it is ridiculous to
expect even young men not to up
hold these principles."
Ilartmaim Replies
Hartmann in answering stated:
"The matter of amendment is faced
with the inertia of the American
public. The finality of the Supreme
Court is still an evil, and that final
ity is what we propose to remove."
In concluding the inaugurating
debate in the Memorial Theater,
President Wilbur referred to the
Wilson election, "If majority rules,
why shouldn't five rule when sev
eral hundred held the balance on a
vote of millions."
