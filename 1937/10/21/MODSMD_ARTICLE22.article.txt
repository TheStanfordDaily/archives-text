# S.C. Tilt Gets 1156 Rooters
## 
### 
Stanford will go down south 1156
strong on November ,5 to watch the
Indian gridders battle the Southern
Cal Trojans on the 6th, judging by
the number of rooters' tickets sold
here.
This total, which is over one
fourth of the entire student body,
is nearly 400 smaller than the total
two years ago when the Vowing
Sophs went south to play their last
game against S.C. for Stanford.
