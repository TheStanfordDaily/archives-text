# Club To Discuss 'Campus Opinion'
## 
### 
Controversy stimulated by the
article appearing in The Daily two
weeks ago under Campus Opinion
and signed by "An American" will
be the basis for discussion at the
next meeting of the Walrus Club on
Wednesday, November 10.
The club, which met yesterday in
the Women's Clubhouse, agreed
that they would use that topic and
try to find at least two speakers to
address the group on both sides of
the question. As is the custom, fol
lowing this the problem will be
given over to the listeners for open
discussion.
The Walrus organization has been
on the campus for a number of
years but was defunct last year due
to lack of interest on the part of
the students. It is sponsored by the
Y.W.C.A. for both men and women
students as well as interested mem
bers of the faculty.
