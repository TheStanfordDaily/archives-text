# Airline Heads Make Crash Investigation
## Instruments May Give Important Evidence In Federal Inquiry 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 20 (UP).
—Instruments dug from the wreck
age of a giant United Airlines trans
port plane were studied carefully
tonight by federal aid airline offi
cials who hoped to learn from them
what caused the ship to crash in
the Uinta Mountains Sunday, kill
ing 19 persons.
The most important evidence to be
presented to a federal inquiry, date
for which will be set Saturday, was
expected to be provided by a deli
cate instrument, the recording baro
graph, only recently installed in
commercial airplanes.
Barograph Tells Sotry
This bit of mechanism, which
permanently records up and down
movement of aircraft, was removed
from the wreckage and brought here
for examination.
The airline refused to reveal im
mediately what information was
contained in the barograph, but if
the instrument was working prop
erly it will show ho wlong the
transport had been flying at the low
altitude of 10.000 feet before it
struck an isolated mountain ridge
in remote northwestern Utah.
It may show that the plane hit a
sudden down-draft which pulled it
into the mountain. Or, if it re
corded a sustained low flight it
would indicate that other of the air
liner's instruments were defective,
because Pilot Earl D. Woodgerd
made a practice of flying extraordi
narily high over the dangerous
western mountains.

Margery Buttell and Carol Wood
hams were named assistant libx*arian
and freshman manager, respective
ly, at elections of the Women's Glee
Club, yesterday, according to Alice
Adams, business manager.
