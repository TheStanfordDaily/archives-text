Water colors by a group of young
San Francisco artists will be the
next exhibit to be displayed in the
Art Gallery, according to Pedro J.
de Lemos, director of the gallery.
Calling themselves the "13 Water
colorists," this group of artists have
specialized in pastoral scenes. Their
paintings will be on display until
the middle of next month, when
they will be replaced by a photo
graphic exhibit.
The photographs to be on display
were taken by Tai-Min Ching, a
member of the Stanford Chinese
Club, and are representative Chi
nese scenes comprising landscapes,
temples, costumes.
