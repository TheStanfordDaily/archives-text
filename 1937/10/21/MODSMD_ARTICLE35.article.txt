# Italian Troops Ordered From Spain by Duce
## Franco – British Threat Causes Removal Of Fascist Black Shirts 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 20 (U.R).—Premier
Benito Mussolini, running up against
a dangerous Franco-British threat,
dropped his defiant attitude tonight
and agreed to collaborate in a plan
to withdraw his fascist blackshirts
and other foreign "volunteers" from
Spain.
II Duce's conciliatory gesture,
which came as a surprise even to
Italian diplomats in Rome, held out
hopes of solving a three-way dead
lock within the non-intei*vent.ion
committee and averting a crisis
crammed with possibilities of war.
Objection Withdrawn
The non - intervention delegates,
quick to seize upon Italy's consent
to sending a neutral "volunteers"
commission to Spain at once, agreed
that it constituted "a substantial
degree of progress" and asked that
immediate steps be taken to put
the proposals into operation.
Italy and Germany announced that
they had withdrawn their objections
to Franco-British proposals where
by belligerent rights will be with
held from Spanish factions until
"token" withdrawals of volunteers
have been carried out. Until today
the Rome-Berlin axis demanded si
multaneous recognition of belliger
ency.
Statesmen believed that Musso
lini, unable to budge Britain and
France from their demands that he
clear out of Spain, had come to the
conclusion that he could count on no
further capitulations to his policy.
