Temple, and other college teams.

Sports Review
The highlight of the smoker was
the review of sports at Stanford
given by Harry Malone, minor sports
coach. He spoke of "the 28-year rec
ord of athletic achievement" which
Stanford can boast, and urged par
ticipation in sports. "If any stu
dent is not physically able to go out
for sports, he is mentally able to go
into student activities," Malone said.
Before the smoker, the 137 frosh
selected for the occasion had dinner
at the seven eating clubs, then were
shown the accommodations and
rooms at Toyon Hall. The dinner
and smoker last night were not for
purposes of rushing, but were held
in an attempt to show the members
of '41 what the Halls are like, ac
cording to Harry Horton and Dick
Clarke, co-chairmen.

In Minneapolis Frank Allen has
18 racers of which he is justly proud.
They are turtles which can all cover
ten feet in less than one minute.
