800-ERKELEY RATED
TOPS BY PRESS BOYS
I see where the 800-erkeley Bears
have been rated the top grid team
in the nation so far this season by
the Associated Press. (Apologies are
offered to Harry Press for using his
pet characterization of our Califor
nia friends.)
The Golden Bears were given a
surprisingly strong endorsement
for the number one spot in the
country after four weeks of grid
iron campaigning.
California polled a total of 432
points out of a possible 540, receiv
ing the endorsement of 24 of the 54
sports experts for the top spot. .Ala
bama was rated second place with
355 points, and the Pittsburgh Pan
thers follow in third place with 347.
Cal is the only coast, team given
recognition in the first ten.
The Trojans of Southern Cal are
rated in eleventh place with a mere
84 points, and the Broncos of Santa
Clara, rated by many last year as
the national champs, were placed in
fourteenth place with 45.
The Indians, of course, weren't
mentioned, but the Associated Press
boys may sit through at least one
upset in their little program. . . .
Tiny's rejuvenated bunch of foot
ballers may topple U.S.C. this year.
This Trojan-Bear struggle Saturday
is going to tell us a lot about the
coast situation, or will it?
X.C.C.A. TRYING TO
TAKE OVER OLYMPICS
Wandering away from the foot
ball turf for a few minutes, I see
where the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association has petitioned for
adoption of an amendment giving
colleges control of American Olym
pic teams in four sports—track, crew,
swimming, and wrestling.
After the way the Amateur Ath
letic Union carried on the last Olym
pics, I'm not sure this isn't one swell
idea.
Chief of the arguments present
ed by the N.C.C.A. for adoption
of the amendment is its conten
tion that 9!) per cent of the ath
letes, points won, and champion
ships gained, have been from
colleges.
BUSTER FAILS IN
GATE RECORD TRY
Wandering from national affairs
to the aquatic game, I see where
Buster Olds, diminutive former
Stanford swimming and water polo
star, failed in his attempt to crack
the 23-year-old record foic paddling
across the Golden Gate.
With more than three minutes
to go on Walter Pomeroy's water
soaked record. Buster was only 200
yards from the white colored
cliffs of Lime Point. At this point
a swirling edd.v caught him and
the plucky little "Hard Luck"
swimmer was held in the same
spot for almost a minute, oblit
erating any chances he had to
smash the record.
LARRY'S COACHING
RECORD UNBLEMISHED
Now we come back to the football
turf for a closing shot. Larry Rou
ble's Phoenix High football team is
really doing all right by Larry. The
Coyotes, as they are called, trimmed
Bakersfield High last week, G-0, for
their fourth straight victory.
lorry's coaching record is un
blemished. In his entire mentor
ing career (four games) he hasn't
lost one yet.
