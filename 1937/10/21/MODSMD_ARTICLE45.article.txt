# Water Polo Squad Set to Torpedo Trojans
## Team Shows More Speed; Passing Good Shifts in First String Line-up Move Hanna, Lamb to Guard Posts 
### 
In an effort to strengthen an ap
parently weak lineup, Coach Nort
Thornton of the Cardinal water polo
team last night completely revised
his first string for the U.S.C. game
this Friday.
Thornton switphed Captain Bill
Hanna and Johnny Lamb from for
wards to guards, injecting Harv
Rothschild and Bill Bleeker into the
forward spots.
Goalies Still Vie
Jack Vibert remains at sprint, but
four goalies are still angling for the
starting call. Wilson, Hall, Dowling,
and Burns all alternated in Wed
nesday's scrimmage. Bob Plate is
set at center back.
With better passing and a faster
breaking offense, the new Indian
team should be a standoff against a
Trojan squad which is being her
alded as the league "dark horse."
New Trojan Coach
The Trojans are broadcasting es
pecially about their new coach, Ed
Bittke, who is well grounded in polo
Moreover, S.C. has a crew of jun
ior college transfers who used to
shine before they changed their af
filiations. Dick Glasband from Los
Angeles J.C. and Van Dyke from
Long Beach are two of the gentle
men who will try to raise a Trojan
team which was submerged after it
won the league title in 1932.
Frosh-I'aly Meet
Thornton is arranging another
carnival with the frosh due to begin
the festivities in a game with Paly
high at 3 o'clock. Roy Winkleman
will encore his performance of last
week-end at 4 o'clock. The varsity
tilt is tentatively set for 4:15 o'clock.
Play will be in Encina Pools with
free admission to all holders of A.S.
S.U. cards.
