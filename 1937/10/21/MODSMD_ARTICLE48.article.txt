## Captain Stone New Recruit On Sick List Grid Leader in Hospital With Flu, Expected To Play Saturday 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Captain Grant Stone dealt a blow
to the varsity gird team yesterday
when he developed a fever and was
sent to the hospital with intestinal
flu.
Although he will not be able to
practice again this week, it is likely
that he will be in shape in time for
Saturday's game against the Univer
sity of Washington at Seattle.
If loss of weight prevents his
playing full time, Stone will be re
placed at right end by Bill Willard,
and Fred Ledeboer will call signals
in the captain's place.
Zagar May Be Out
Pete Zagar is Coach Tiny Thorn
hill's next worry. A boil on his
cheek might easily develop into
something worse; so Byron We6t
will probably get the call at right
tackle.
Bill Paulman is still having shoul
der troubles since he dislocated his
collar-bone in the Oregon tilt and
will be used Saturday only if he is
needed to kick. Al Alustiza, with
Gene Coldiron and Ed Gamier as
relief, will begin at quarterback.
Groves at Fullback
Jimmy Coffis and Fred Ledeboer
will be starting halfbacks against
the Huskies, with Jim Groves at
full.
Irv Cummings, completely cured
after a recent seige of bronchitis,
will begin on the left flank. Leo
Ferko and Bob Dakan will again
hold down guard spots, and Tony
Calvelli will start in the pivot post.
Kickers Drilled
Indicating that they may find use
for field goals Saturday, Doc Luck
ett, Paulman, and Glenn Hamilton
went through a short goal-kicking
practice yesterday. Luckett is Stan
ford's best bet in this department
and is still good out to about 40
yards.
Gridders will hold their last prac
tice session before Saturday's game
at noon today and will take the train
for Seattle at 3 o'clock.
