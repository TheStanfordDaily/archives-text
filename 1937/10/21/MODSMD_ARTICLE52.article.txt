# Baby Indians Set for Aerial Siege on Cubs
## Game Promises Thrills To Spectators; Teams Seem Well Matched 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey had his star
backs, Norm Standlee and Thor
Peterson, throwing pebble-grained
footballs all over Grey's Field to the
Papoose backs and ends yesterday
afternoon.
He intends to show the Westwood
Cubs that there are ways to get by
their 200-pound-per-man line be
sides running over it, when they
come up here Saturday.
Tough Game
In spite of the fact that the frosh
think they can wi' l this game, it will
be a tough one, and, from a specta
tor's viewpoint, probably their best
of the season.
Because, for the first time this
year, spark-plug Standlee will have
spark-plug Peterson in first-rate
shape to help him run, pass, and
kick the Cubs clear back to West
wood.
Cubs' Line Heavy
And tfie Cubs will have, besides
the biggest and best line they've
had since the Dark Ages, a spark
plug of their own, Jim Haslan, to
do some first-rate kicking around
on his own.
Theoretically the Papooses come
up against the Cubs refreshed after
a two weeks rest. Actually the only
rest they have had in these last two
weeks of non-competition have been
last Saturday and Sunday. They
will be strengthened, not refreshed.
To Farm football fans facing a
second consecutive week-end with
out a home varsity game to watch,
the frosh game Saturday should
prove a boon. It will give them their
first chance, possibly, to see the '39
and '40 varsity team in action.
