## This Is Not About The Libe 
### 
THOUGH most people don't seem to realize it,
Stanford's football status for the season 1937
will be quite definitely determined when the
little blank revolvers crack at Seattle and Ber
keley late Saturday afternoon.
And if the right things happen at the right
time in the right place, the Indian steamroller
which performed like a broken toy against Santa
Clara and dropped an unfortunate one to Ore
gon, may surprise its early season critics by
rolling right up to the top of the Conference pile.
Quite conceivably the dismal Stanford varsity
of four weeks ago may be a Rose Bowl candi
date by Saturday night—although such a state
ment does sound terribly like the stuff we used
to reel off in Sideline Slants before the job of
serious editorializing with Libe comment, and
all that sort of thing, came our way.
But today we rejoicingly revert to type —lingo
and all—to point out that the Red Steamroller
needs only to flatten Washington in the north

while the powerful California "wonder team"
drops its first one of the season to "Amby"
Schindler and the Trojan lads at Berkeley, to put
Stanford very much in the picture this year.
To expect these things is not anticipating
miracles. California, somewhat overconfident,
could lose to U.S.C. who showed great power
last week-end, though the odds stand 2-1 the
other way.
Stanford, gathering headway, and backed by
a good send-off today, can defeat the Huskies
who haven't shown much this season.
And if these things happen, it will be some
thing more than all California when the Big
Game rolls around. And then again, if they
don't, it will still be something more than all
California when the Big Game rolls around.
But by next week the Conference football
lineup for 1937 will be quite definitely settled,
and if things go well . . .
Anyway, it's great to write sports again.
