ise the Stanford group of the World Foun
dation meets tonight.
Stanford's is the second unit of the Founda
tion in America and Dr. Wilbur is the only
American member of the organizing committee.
Aside from connection there, it is particularly
fitting that the movement should start in these
ivory towers.
A philosophical concept as a formula for
peace is the sort of thing that would start at an
American university.
Beginning with the admission that there are
major differences between nations, and then
throwing them out, the Foundation declares
that there is a kind of world unity at the present
time. Technological and commercial progress
has made the nations interdependent. But be
cause of cultural lag the commercial and eco
nomic unity of the world has not become part
of the world consciousness.
Other organizations have started with the po
litical differences of countries and tried to solve
them. Their results have often merely intensi
fied the differences.
The foundation is going to start with common
ties of the world, stressing such things as Pan
American unity and the International Postal
Union, and impress the concept of world unity

on the world mind. War, by inference, will be
outlawed.
No campaign has yet been outlined and when
one is, it will not be of the high-pressure type.
Long-run effect seems to be what the Founda
tion is seeking.
Give the people the information and their
conclusions will be wise is an idealistic con
cept, and Stanford may not be very conscious
of its part in a peace movement based on that
concept —this year or next. But it may be proud
of it in ten or fifteen years. —L. L.
