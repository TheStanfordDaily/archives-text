# BULL SESSION
## JOHNNY, THIS IS TEACHER 
### 
COME time ago, one of our 'department heads got a
letter from a Stanford graduate and M.A. who
wanted a recommendation for a job. The letter started
something like this: "I hate to trouble you this way,
but you are the only professor at Stanford whom I
know well enough to ask for a recommendation."
A very neat introduction, say professional job
moochers. It reflects credit on the tact and ingenuity
of the writer. But unfortunately it does not bathe the
University in the same rosy light. Rather, it shows
Stanford as the villain of the piece and indicates that
something is decidedly wrong with our student
faculty relations.

When a man can spend five years at a university
and leave it knowing only one professor, observers
iire going to have difficulty in distinguishing between
a college and a correspondence school. Some of the
boys who stay home and do their studying via Mr.
Farley's great system like to tell us that we are wast
ing money attending school. They say that they learn
Ihe facts just as well by mail. Our only comeback is
I hat we have contact with experts, that we associate
with and copy men who have spent their lives seek
ing knowledge and culture.
But our retort will not be so frightfully crushing
if we can point to only one faculty member as our
friend.

Under the present system the professional desk
forms a barrier between students and faculty that stops
even the most vaulting personality. About the best
thing we can work out is a sort of Pyi'amus and
Thisbe contact through informal chinks in the wall of
formalized relations.
If a student drops in for a bull session with a pro
fessor, he is accused of polishing the well known
apple. In fact, there is one such renegade in the phi
losophy department who is consistently booed when
ever he appears in class.

IT is not surprising, then, that undergraduates stam
pede for the open air whenever the bell rings, leav
ing the professor to his tabulation of birth rates among
the polyps. And there is no tradition or precedent
which prompts teachers to encourage contacts with
students. A professor usually has two or three sets
of papers to grade, a magazine article to write, and a
text to revise. Since there is no custom of informal
contact with students, he is content to meet them
only when there is a kick about a grade, or a question
about assignments.
Only the few professors who go out of their way
to see students ever get to know any of them. Most
of the others sec the undergraduate as a machine
that stands across the desk and says, "Yes, sir,
but . .

Professors meet "outstanding" students, the ones
who come around to discuss extracurricular matters.
But I hey see practically nothing of the average under
graduate except in class.
The solution of the difficulty does not lie in formal
committees; friendship cannot be regimented into
lecture groups and luncheons. Professors and students
will get to know each other only when they both
make an effort to meet informally. They will benefit
from contact with each other only when the student
can drop in without embarrassment for a bull session.
Until we can do that, we are going ot have a hard
time explaining to the correspondence school boys
why we come to college.
