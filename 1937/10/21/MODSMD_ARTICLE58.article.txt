# WAR ON SYPHILIS
## 
### 
This is the first of a series of articles dealing
with syphilis, and the feasibility of compulsory
Wassermann tests as a means of stamping out the
disease. Compiled from information received from
the Stanford Health Service, it is published here
with the belief that Stanford people will take no
offense at the intelligent dispensation of educa
tional material on the subject.—The Editor
ttINCE the "hush-hush" attitude has been banished
from considerations of social diseases in the United
States Public Health Service, has said one adult in
bility of compulsory tests and treatment of syphilis
and gonorrhea.
Most emphasized—and most prominently mentioned
in connection with colleges—is the need of Wasser
mann tests for syphilis. In any discussion, thei'efore,
it is advisable to consider the prevalence and danger
of syphilis.
Dr. Thomas Parran, surgeon general of the United
Statse Public Health Service, has said one adult in
every ten in the United States at one time or another
is infected. The disease is more widespread among
Negroes than among whites; more among the poorer
classes than among the better situated and more in
cities than in rural districts.
Many prominent medical authorities have listed
syphilis with cancer, tuberculosis and pneumonia as
one of the four greatest killing diseases in the United
States. But case findings and treatment are scattered,
sporadic and inadequate in this country—while in
countries whjpre tests and treatments are compulsory,
the disease is virtually eliminated.
passes through three stages. In the first
stage the Wassermann test, which is a blood test,
is negative. In the second stage, skin eruptions appear
and the third stage, most dangerous—when disable
ment and death occur — has no visible symptoms.
In the second stage a positive Wassermann will verify
what may be feared when the eruptions appear. In
the third, only the Wassermann can show that there is
syphilis present.
What then, is the value of Wassermanns, of which
compulsory use is advocated? During the first stage,
when 86 per cent cures can be effected if the disease
is discovered, the Wassermann shows nothing.
In the second, where the Wassermann is the only
test found dependable and generally accurate, 64 per
cent cures can be effected and in the third stage, some
cures can be effected and many dangerous conditions
—sores, insanity, physical collapse—can be alleviated.
When a person feels he has been exposed to the
disease—and most persons would know—an immediate
visit to a physician and the test should save much later
suffering.
And today state governments are furnishing drugs,
free of cost, to physicians to provide inexpensive treat
ment of those who react positively to the tests, thereby
bringing a once prohibitively costly cure within reach
of all.
Advocates of compulsory test and treatment assert
this alone is the one method of wiping out this great
soical disease.

What then, is the value of Wassermanns, of which
compulsory use is advocated? During the first stage,
when 86 per cent cures can be effected if the disease
is discovered, the Wassermann shows nothing.
In the second, where the Wassermann is the only
test found dependable and generally accurate, 64 per
cent cures can be effected and in the third stage, some
cures can be effected and many dangerous conditions
—sores, insanity, physical collapse—can be alleviated.
When a person feels he has been exposed to the
disease—and most persons would know—an immediate
visit to a physician and the test should save much later
suffering.
And today state governments are furnishing drugs,
free of cost, to physicians to provide inexpensive treat
ment of those who react positively to the tests, thereby
bringing a once prohibitively costly cure within reach
of all.
Advocates of compulsory test and treatment assert
this alone is the one method of wiping out this great
soical disease.
