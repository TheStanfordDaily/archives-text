# CAMPUS OPINION
## JORGENSEN PROTESTS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the first issue of The Daily
this quarter Bullsessioner John
Cobbs prologued his fall season with
this message:
"... during this volume, 'Bull
Session' will play the part of the
detached observer . . . 'Bull Ses
sion' will comment on those aspects
of college life which appear worthy
of comment. And if anyone feels
that he is unjustly criticized let him
remember 'Purity is its own se
curity.'
Phi Beta Kappa
In the fourth issue Mr. Cobbs de
fended an honor society on the
grounds that it gave no one offense,
saying: "Phi Beta Kappa brings
light into the dark lives of grade
slaves, and carefully avoids tramp
ling on anyone's toes."
The fifth issue brought this:
"It is true, of course, that the
ordinary student's participation in
national politics is limited to clap
ping or booing the news reels. It is
also true that he can dig up very
little sympathy for some battered
minority or little brown brethren.
Perhaps this heartlessness depletes
his account in the Bank of Heaven,
but it saves considerable deprecia
tion of the nervous system, and it
allows time for a little studying."
After laying the basis for this as
pirin philosophy in his early col
umns, the Daily's mint julep philos
opher has sunk gradually deeper into
his sofa pillows.
Applauds Sweetness, Light
Sweetness and light have been
applauded, provided they didn't
glare in the retina, while the su
preme end in life has come to be the
ability to breathe regularly but not
deeply.
In Wednesday's Daily Mr. Cobbs'
crowned his previous efforts by
agreeing: "It is a very fine and com
mendable thing to send doctors and
medicine to Spain ..." and then
went on to prove why he did not
believe in deserting the pillows.
Forges Pillow Pattern
No doubt this school of thought
strikes a responsive chord in many
a local organ loft. Stanford's abil
ity to be in sympathy with many
things without doing anything about
their sympathy is legendary, and
the Bull Sessioner undoubtedly is
forging a new pillow pattern for the
collective Stanfoi'd subconscious.
This ability to be a "stringed lute
on which all winds may play," as
Oscar Wilde would recommend, is
subject, however, to the qualifica
tions in the cardinal point of the
Cardinal philosophy, that philoso
phy which accepts on faith that
campus is not part of the world.
Purity, Security
"Purity is its own security," the
avoidance of nervous strain, and the
elimination of toe trampling, is
somewhat inadequate in a world
where civilian populations are being
bombed by Japanese bombers, con
stitutional democracies are thrown
over as soon as they become con
stitutional democracies, and the war

psychosis is used to maintain sofa
pillows in power.
As far as Mr. Cobbs' current rea
son for inaction (that the killing of
an American doctor in Spain would
start Americans beating the drums),
I would ask him to examine with a
realistic viewpoint President Roose
velt's Chicago Day address, the nu
merous declarations on the part of
the State Department in regard to
Americans in China, and the fact
that Dr. Eloesser and his "radical"
friends are going to Spain under a
permit from the United States gov
ernment.

"It is true, of course, that the
ordinary student's participation in
national politics is limited to clap
ping or booing the news reels. It is
also true that he can dig up very
little sympathy for some battered
minority or little brown brethren.
Perhaps this heartlessness depletes
his account in the Bank of Heaven,
but it saves considerable deprecia
tion of the nervous system, and it
allows time for a little studying."
After laying the basis for this as
pirin philosophy in his early col
umns, the Daily's mint julep philos
opher has sunk gradually deeper into
his sofa pillows.
Applauds Sweetness, Light
Sweetness and light have been
applauded, provided they didn't
glare in the retina, while the su
preme end in life has come to be the
ability to breathe regularly but not
deeply.
In Wednesday's Daily Mr. Cobbs'
crowned his previous efforts by
agreeing: "It is a very fine and com
mendable thing to send doctors and
medicine to Spain ..." and then
went on to prove why he did not
believe in deserting the pillows.
Forges Pillow Pattern
No doubt this school of thought
strikes a responsive chord in many
a local organ loft. Stanford's abil
ity to be in sympathy with many
things without doing anything about
their sympathy is legendary, and
the Bull Sessioner undoubtedly is
forging a new pillow pattern for the
collective Stanfoi'd subconscious.
This ability to be a "stringed lute
on which all winds may play," as
Oscar Wilde would recommend, is
subject, however, to the qualifica
tions in the cardinal point of the
Cardinal philosophy, that philoso
phy which accepts on faith that
campus is not part of the world.
Purity, Security
"Purity is its own security," the
avoidance of nervous strain, and the
elimination of toe trampling, is
somewhat inadequate in a world
where civilian populations are being
bombed by Japanese bombers, con
stitutional democracies are thrown
over as soon as they become con
stitutional democracies, and the war

psychosis is used to maintain sofa
pillows in power.
As far as Mr. Cobbs' current rea
son for inaction (that the killing of
an American doctor in Spain would
start Americans beating the drums),
I would ask him to examine with a
realistic viewpoint President Roose
velt's Chicago Day address, the nu
merous declarations on the part of
the State Department in regard to
Americans in China, and the fact
that Dr. Eloesser and his "radical"
friends are going to Spain under a
permit from the United States gov
ernment.

The Editor, Sir:
In the first issue of The Daily
this quarter Bullsessioner John
Cobbs prologued his fall season with
this message:
"... during this volume, 'Bull
Session' will play the part of the
detached observer . . . 'Bull Ses
sion' will comment on those aspects
of college life which appear worthy
of comment. And if anyone feels
that he is unjustly criticized let him
remember 'Purity is its own se
curity.'
Phi Beta Kappa
In the fourth issue Mr. Cobbs de
fended an honor society on the
grounds that it gave no one offense,
saying: "Phi Beta Kappa brings
light into the dark lives of grade
slaves, and carefully avoids tramp
ling on anyone's toes."
The fifth issue brought this:
"It is true, of course, that the
ordinary student's participation in
national politics is limited to clap
