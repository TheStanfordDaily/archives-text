# Dr. Gardner To Dedicate New Theater
## Speakers Will Review Farm War Days In Ceremony on Sunday 
### CORENA CRASE 
Stanford's new theater, erected
in commemoration of the Stanford
men and women who served in the
World War, will be dedicated to
their memory this Sunday afternoon
at 3 o'clock.
Speeches by Dr. Augustus T.
Murray, representing the Memorial
Committee, and Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur on the war days at Stanford; a
prayer by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood;
and the dedication itself by Dr.
D. Charles Gardner, Stanford
chaplain during the war, will con
stitute the program.
Music Transmitted
An unusual feature of the cere
mony will be the transmission of the
organ and choir music from the Me
morial Chapel to the Memorial Hall
by remote control for the first time.
The Memorial Hall, finished last
June and costing $585,000, is the re
sult of a movement launched by
a memorial committee made up of
alumni, faculty, and students right
after the war to erect a suitable
memorial for those who served in
the war.
In the lobby of the theater a
tablet has been placed containing
the names of the 77 who lost their
lives.
