# Stevens Announces Two Classics For November
## 
### 
Moliere's "Don Juan" and Euripides' "The Trojan Women" will be
produced in the Little Theater during November by members of the re
hearsal and performance class under the direction of Thomas Wood
Stevens.
Each play will run for several nights, a new idea in Farm dramatic
circles. The Little Theater was selected as the setting for the productions
so that drama students may gain^

"professional" experience by play
ing before audiences on successive
evenings.
"Don Juan," a brilliant tragi
comedy by the seventeenth century
master of French drama, will start
its run November 11. An original
English version of the rarely-seen
play by Director Stevens will be
presented.
Women's Cast
This translation, which has been
called the only one suitable for pro
duction in English, was introduced
at Carnegie Tech's famous School of
Drama which Mr. Stevens headed
for 10 years.
The classic tragedy, "The Trojan
Women/' is scheduled for produc
tion late in November. The cast is
composed chiefly of women; the
vehicle will give female drama stu
dents an opportunity they have long
been waiting for .according to Di
rector Stevens.
'Powerful Drama'
Euripedes' play will be presented
as a powerful human drama, rather
than in the stylized manner of the
ancient Greek theater.
Elaborate costuming and settings
are being planned for "Don Juan"
and "The Trojan Women." Tickets
will be sold for all performances.
Stimulated professional acting con
ditions will be the main object of
the presentation of these two dra
matic masterpieces,' according to
Mr. Stevens.
