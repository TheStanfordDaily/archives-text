ivneed our team wants to win and
if they want to win they're pretty
tough to handle. We'll come back
with the Husky hide."

Grayson Speaks
Backfield Coach Bobby Grayson,
one of the "Vowing Sophs," said the
team has reached the turning point
with the U.C.L.A. game. "We don't
claim to be five or six deep, the
way the northern branch of
U.C.L.A., across the creek and mud
fiats is," he stated, "but I'm con
ivneed our team wants to win and
if they want to win they're pretty
tough to handle. We'll come back
with the Husky hide."
Jack Walton, termed by Yell
Leader Jim Ransohoff a "bashful
little fellow," said, "We stood up
here three weeks ago and said what
we were going to do to the Ducks.
We're not going to say it this time
but we're going up there and do it."
