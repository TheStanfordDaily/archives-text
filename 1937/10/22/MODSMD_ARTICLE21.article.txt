## East Bay Stanford Club Presents New Program 
### 
Plans for educating prospective
college students in the advantages
of Stanford by means of co-opera
tion between the Interfraternity
Council and Interclub Council were
presented to the Row group last
night at a dinner meeting at the
Phi Psi house by L. R. Weinmann,
chairman of the East Bay Stanford
Club's high school relations com
mittee.
Interested only in presenting
Stanford to high school students as
a possible alma mater, a Stanford
committee, headed by Wayne Rich
ardson, and acting in conjunction
with the Axe Society, will co-operate
with the East Bay Stanford Club.
Tours Planned
Tours of the campus, staying in
fraternities and halls alternately, and
presentation to various campus ac
tivities are included in the program.
Dr. Charles E. Shepard, director
of the men's health service, spoke to
the council about the physical as
pect of a pre-initiation period in
fraternities, saying:
"The medical aspect is less im
portant than any other, but Hell
week should not interfere with
studies or the ability to study." Dr.
Shepard went on to say that in his
college career the pre-initiation pe
riod he underwent was one of the
best things that ever happened to
him.
A new Interfraternity Board mem
ber, Harold M. Bacon, of the mathe
matics department who has just
been appointed to that position by
Dr. Wilbur, was presented to the
council by President Don Moult on.
