# Card Eleven Heads For Washington Tilt
## Stone, Zagar Released from Hospital For Trip; Paulman Better 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
The Big Red Machine is reunited—and it has a good chance to bring
home the bacon.
Grant Stone and Pete /agar were released from the hospital yesterday
with doctor's permission to start against the University of Washington at
Seattle tomorrow.
Stone will continue his milk and toast diet until after the game, so
pass-receiving on the right flank will be hampered only by an empty

■stomach. And the captain will be
in there to call signals. Zagar's
cheek is still in bad shape, but a
little tape and gauze will put .him
on the starting lineup at left tackle.
Paulman May Kick
Bill Paulman is the only regular
still on the injury list and will be
used only if he is needed to kick.
A1 Alustiza, with plenty of good re
serves, will take his place.
They have been having a little

j rain in Seattle and expect more
j this week-end. And the Huskies,
I heavier and faster than the Indians,
! will have the upper hand on a wet
j field.
Last Workout
i Yesterday's noon practice session
j in sweat suits was the last workout
I lor the Cards before Saturday's
! game, and they will be on a train
j until tonight. But they have had
| two weeks to concentrate oil Wash
' ington plays and to get into condi
j lion, so the rest will probably do
j them good.
Jim Groves will start for Stan
ford at fullback, with Jimmy Coffis
and Fred Ledeboer at halves, and
Alustiza at quarter.
Calvelli Starts
Starting at center will be banana
fingered Tony Calvelli, with Bob
| Dakan and Leo Ferko at guards.
I Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen will
be in their regular tackle posts with
I Stone at right end.
Whom to put at left end is Coach
Tiny Thornhill's greatest worry.
Bill YVillard, the only end in good
physical condition, will probably
start, but Neil Rasmussen, recover
ing from a sprained ankle, and Irv
Cummings, with a bronchitis hang
over, will give Willard a run for the
starting call.
Cruver Big Worry
Cards' greatest worry on the Hus
ky side of the scrimmage will be A1
Cruver, fullback who caused Stan
ford considerable trouble here last
year. Cruver's longest suit is his
place-kicking, but he can also run
and throw passes in fine style.
Outstanding passer for Washing
ton is Fritz Wascowitz, halfback, and
Charley Russel, his negro substitute,
is also plenty good.
Place-kicks Important
| The outcome of the game may de
pend on who kicks a better field
goal, Cruver or Doc Luckett. For
three consecutive Husky-Indian
tilts at Seattle the only scoring has
been chalked up by field goals, and
each team this year has a good
chance with a kicker accurate out to
40 yards.
The teams have equal talent in
passing and kicking, and the final
score will depend upon which team
is hot.
