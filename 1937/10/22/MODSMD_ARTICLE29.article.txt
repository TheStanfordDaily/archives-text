A scrawly, student - fashioned
sign was hung on the front of the
nickolodian in the Nitery yesterday.
It read—"Don't put your nickels in
this damn machine or you will be
taken to the cleaners like we were."
The sign makers were traced
down and it was learned the boys
had contributed two nickels and a
dime into the little round slots to
hear Benny Goodman's quartet
swing "Avalon," and to learn the
lyrics to "Vieni Vieni." All they got
was the tinkle of their money as
it dropped into the coin box. With
grieving hearts they stuck the mes
sage up to keep any other music
lovers from putting their small
change into a musicless music box.
Suffice to say, the' machine is
once again pouring out "Vieni
Vieni."
