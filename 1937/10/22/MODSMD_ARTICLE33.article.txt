# Gridders Hit Mid-year Peak
## Cal, U.S.C. Fight For League Leadership 
### 
Nice guys, these conference sched
ule maker-outers. They don't even
give us time to wake up from the
week of the Big Sleep before a bunch
of tough battles hit U6*all at once.
The game which will knock the
league ratings into a heavy stupor
if the right team doesn't win is, of
course, the Cal-U.S.C. tussle. A 2-1
favorite to end on top, the 800-erke
ley boys should come through in
good fashion, because all Troy has is
Amby Schindler, and one man is
NEVER enough to take a ball game.
Cal by one touchdown.
Bruins Meet W.S.C.
Kenny Washington plays W.S.C.
this weekend. The rest of the U.C.
L.A. team will help him, and be
tween the whole gang of 'em, they
have a fair chance of ekeing out a
one-score win.
A potent intrastate fight looms
when Oregon takes on neighbor
Oregon State. The two elevens are
even in strength, but the nod goes
to O.S.C. because of a slightly bet
ter scoring punch.
Independent Tilts
St. Mary's takes on Idaho for what
we hope is an easy two-score win.
But then, we picked Montana over
U.S.F. Speaking of the Dons, 'twould
be well to mention right here and
now that they are playing Gonzaga
this week-end. The Bulldogs aren't
as strong as they, were cracked up
to be, and a one-touchdown vic
tory shouldn't be hard to mark up
for U.S.F.
Best independent tilt of the week
will be the Santa Clara - Loyola
game.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21 (U.R).—
San Francisco's "heat

Pirates were so numerous and !
darin« in ancient and medieval times
in the Mediterranean that whole
navies gave them battle, and em- j

them out.
