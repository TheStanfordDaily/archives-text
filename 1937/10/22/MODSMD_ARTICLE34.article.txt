CLIMBING OUT ON
THE LIMB AGAIN
It seems to be the thing to do for
sports scriveners to climb out on
the end of a shaky limb at least
once a week and venture a few
feeble predictions on what will hap
pen in the sports world.
Being the conventional type of
human being I might just as well
string along with (he rest of the
fourth estate. At least I won't be
all alone when I crash to the
ground Saturday night.
First we'll start with the sports
affairs of special interest to Farm
fans.
No longer is it the Little Red Kid
die Kar —the Big Red Machine of
old will ramble into the Washington
wilds in search of the pack of Hus
kies that caused so much consterna
tion among the good California citi
zens last year. This year's Husky
model isn't the sleek number it was
last year; in fact, the animal is just
a bit on the mangy side. Tiny's In
dians should take this one, rain or
no rain.
BKUIN CUBS SHOULD
WHIP SHIPKEY'S MEN
While their big brothers are fight
ing the Huskies in the northland,
the Stanford frosh \vill tackle the
strongest frosh team ever to come
out of Westwood. The U.C.L.A.
Bruin Cubs are rated plenty high
down south, even though they were
held to a scoreless tie by the Cal
yearlings last week. I look for the
Cubs to whip the Papooses but it
will be a real fight and no walk
away. I was all wet on the Card-
Bruin varsity game so maybe I'll
be off on the wrong track in this
frosh battle—l hope so.
Over in Encina pools this after
noon the Trojans will wheel their
sea-going wooden horse from U.S.C.
into the water in an attempt to end
a losing streak in water polo which
started after they won the confer
ence championship in 1932. Last
year the Trojahs were the confer
ence doormat, failing to take a
league while Nort Thornton's
Indian amphibians went on to take
the title, dropping only one game,
a 1-0 affair at Berkeley.
CARDS SHOULD SINK
TKOJAN HOBBY HORSE
This afternoon's game should be
a thriller. The Trojans are reported
as being vastly improved this sea
son, and it is a well known fact that
the Cards are decidedly inferior to
last year's team. I look for a Red
skin victory here, but it'll be pretty
close. •
The Stanford frosh water polo
team tackles Palo Alto High in
the preliminary. The inexperi
enced frosh are fast improving and
should beat the Paly Vikings by a
convincing margin.
Up in San Francisco Maloney's
Stanford soccermen take up a little
shin-kicking business with the
U.S.F. Stanford has never
had strong soccer teams, and Wed
nesday's 1-0 defeat at the hands of
Menlo Junior College shows this
year's squad isn't too strong. The
Dons have almost always had ace
teams, usually fighting it out with
Cal for the league championships.
The Dons should win this by a pretty
big score.
CAL EXPECTED TO
STOP THUNDERING HERD
Now we'll wander off the Farm
and take a shot at some of the lead
ing coast grid games.
Up at Berkeley the bone-crushing
California varsity should trim the
pants off the rejuvenated U.S.C.
Trojans. It won't be any four touch
down margin, but it'll be convinc
ing. The Cal frosh should take their
first licking in 20-odd starts when
the Trojan Babes go to work on
'em.
S(. Mary's will trim Idaho to
day in San Francisco, but a
stronger - than - average Vandal
outfit should make the game in
teresting. Santa Clara should keep
their undefeated record clean
after they tangle with the Loy
ola Lions down in L.A., and I'm
going to call the U.S.F.-Gonzaga
game up north a tie.

nesday's 1-0 defeat at the hands of
Menlo Junior College shows this
year's squad isn't too strong. The

teams, usually fighting it out with
Cal for the league championships.
The Dons should win this by a pretty
big score.
CAL EXPECTED TO
STOP THUNDERING HERD
Now we'll wander off the Farm
and take a shot at some of the lead
ing coast grid games.
Up at Berkeley the bone-crushing
California varsity should trim the
pants off the rejuvenated U.S.C.
Trojans. It won't be any four touch
down margin, but it'll be convinc
ing. The Cal frosh should take their
first licking in 20-odd starts when
the Trojan Babes go to work on
'em.
S(. Mary's will trim Idaho to
day in San Francisco, but a
stronger - than - average Vandal
outfit should make the game in
teresting. Santa Clara should keep
their undefeated record clean
after they tangle with the Loy
ola Lions down in L.A., and I'm
going to call the U.S.F.-Gonzaga
game up north a tie.

CLIMBING OUT ON
THE LIMB AGAIN
It seems to be the thing to do for
sports scriveners to climb out on
the end of a shaky limb at least
once a week and venture a few
feeble predictions on what will hap
pen in the sports world.
Being the conventional type of
human being I might just as well
string along with (he rest of the
fourth estate. At least I won't be
all alone when I crash to the
ground Saturday night.
First we'll start with the sports
affairs of special interest to Farm
fans.
No longer is it the Little Red Kid
die Kar —the Big Red Machine of
old will ramble into the Washington
wilds in search of the pack of Hus
kies that caused so much consterna
tion among the good California citi
zens last year. This year's Husky
model isn't the sleek number it was
last year; in fact, the animal is just
a bit on the mangy side. Tiny's In
dians should take this one, rain or
no rain.
BKUIN CUBS SHOULD
WHIP SHIPKEY'S MEN
While their big brothers are fight
ing the Huskies in the northland,
the Stanford frosh \vill tackle the
strongest frosh team ever to come
out of Westwood. The U.C.L.A.
Bruin Cubs are rated plenty high
down south, even though they were
held to a scoreless tie by the Cal
yearlings last week. I look for the
Cubs to whip the Papooses but it
will be a real fight and no walk
away. I was all wet on the Card-
Bruin varsity game so maybe I'll
be off on the wrong track in this
frosh battle—l hope so.
Over in Encina pools this after
noon the Trojans will wheel their
sea-going wooden horse from U.S.C.
into the water in an attempt to end
a losing streak in water polo which
started after they won the confer
ence championship in 1932. Last
year the Trojahs were the confer
ence doormat, failing to take a
league while Nort Thornton's
Indian amphibians went on to take
the title, dropping only one game,
a 1-0 affair at Berkeley.
CARDS SHOULD SINK
TKOJAN HOBBY HORSE
This afternoon's game should be
a thriller. The Trojans are reported
as being vastly improved this sea
son, and it is a well known fact that
the Cards are decidedly inferior to
last year's team. I look for a Red
skin victory here, but it'll be pretty
close. •
The Stanford frosh water polo
team tackles Palo Alto High in
the preliminary. The inexperi

Over in Encina pools this after
noon the Trojans will wheel their
sea-going wooden horse from U.S.C.
into the water in an attempt to end
a losing streak in water polo which
started after they won the confer
ence championship in 1932. Last
year the Trojahs were the confer
ence doormat, failing to take a
league while Nort Thornton's
Indian amphibians went on to take
the title, dropping only one game,
a 1-0 affair at Berkeley.
CARDS SHOULD SINK
TKOJAN HOBBY HORSE
This afternoon's game should be
a thriller. The Trojans are reported
as being vastly improved this sea
son, and it is a well known fact that
the Cards are decidedly inferior to
last year's team. I look for a Red
skin victory here, but it'll be pretty
close. •
The Stanford frosh water polo
team tackles Palo Alto High in
the preliminary. The inexperi
enced frosh are fast improving and
should beat the Paly Vikings by a
convincing margin.
Up in San Francisco Maloney's
Stanford soccermen take up a little
shin-kicking business with the
U.S.F. Stanford has never
had strong soccer teams, and Wed
nesday's 1-0 defeat at the hands of
Menlo Junior College shows this
year's squad isn't too strong. The
Dons have almost always had ace
teams, usually fighting it out with
Cal for the league championships.
The Dons should win this by a pretty
big score.
CAL EXPECTED TO
STOP THUNDERING HERD
Now we'll wander off the Farm
and take a shot at some of the lead
ing coast grid games.
Up at Berkeley the bone-crushing
California varsity should trim the
pants off the rejuvenated U.S.C.
Trojans. It won't be any four touch
down margin, but it'll be convinc
ing. The Cal frosh should take their
first licking in 20-odd starts when
the Trojan Babes go to work on
'em.
S(. Mary's will trim Idaho to
day in San Francisco, but a
stronger - than - average Vandal
outfit should make the game in
teresting. Santa Clara should keep
their undefeated record clean
after they tangle with the Loy
ola Lions down in L.A., and I'm
going to call the U.S.F.-Gonzaga
game up north a tie.

CLIMBING OUT ON
THE LIMB AGAIN
It seems to be the thing to do for
sports scriveners to climb out on
the end of a shaky limb at least
once a week and venture a few
feeble predictions on what will hap
pen in the sports world.
Being the conventional type of
human being I might just as well
string along with (he rest of the
fourth estate. At least I won't be
all alone when I crash to the
ground Saturday night.
First we'll start with the sports
affairs of special interest to Farm
fans.
No longer is it the Little Red Kid
die Kar —the Big Red Machine of
old will ramble into the Washington
wilds in search of the pack of Hus
kies that caused so much consterna
tion among the good California citi
zens last year. This year's Husky
model isn't the sleek number it was
last year; in fact, the animal is just
a bit on the mangy side. Tiny's In
dians should take this one, rain or
no rain.
BKUIN CUBS SHOULD
WHIP SHIPKEY'S MEN
While their big brothers are fight
ing the Huskies in the northland,
the Stanford frosh \vill tackle the
strongest frosh team ever to come
out of Westwood. The U.C.L.A.
Bruin Cubs are rated plenty high
down south, even though they were
held to a scoreless tie by the Cal
yearlings last week. I look for the
Cubs to whip the Papooses but it
will be a real fight and no walk
away. I was all wet on the Card-
Bruin varsity game so maybe I'll
be off on the wrong track in this
frosh battle—l hope so.
