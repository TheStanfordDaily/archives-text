# Papoose to Meet Uclan Cubs Here Tomorrow
## Frosh Ready For Struggle With Uclans Bruin's 200-pound Line May Prove Decisive; Standlel Chief Hope 
### 
Coach Norm Duncan is bringing a
cocky bunch of Cubs gridders up
here from Westwood tomorrow, and
Stanford's Papoose pigskinners feel
that the time is ripe to knock them
over.
With an impressive victory rec
ord, marred only by an 0-0 tie
against the Cal yearlings, the Uclans
are favored on paper to make bear
fodder out,of the Cards when they
meet them in the stadium at 2:30
Saturday.
Uclan's Heavy Line
But the frosh, while not over
looking the potentialities of the
Bruin 200-pound-per-man line and
their triple-threat fullback, Warren
Haslan, expect to win this game—
which is their first conference game
of the season.
Captain Norm Standlee will again
be counted on to carry the heavy
burden of the Papoose attack from
his fullback position.
Peterson May Be Out
Earlier this week Coach Harry
Shipkey thought that Standlee would
be backed up by stellar Halfback
Thor Peterson, but the triple threat
back missed practice yesterday with
a cold that may keep him out of the
game Saturday.
Peterson's passing assignments
will be taken over by first-string
Halfback Quentin Thompson. And
judging by the way he was passing
in practice yesterday he should be
heaving the inflated pigskin for
touchdowns Saturday — which isn't
such a bad way to get that mam
moth Cub line.
Stanford's starting line-up for the
game will be: ends, Jim Farquhar
son and Stan Charlston; tackles, Ed
Johansen and Bill Braheny; guards,
Bill Burford and Chic Orme; cen
ter, Jake Thompson; halves, Monty
Pfyl and Quentin Thompson; quar
ter, Stan Graff or Jim McCloud;
full, Norm Standlee.
