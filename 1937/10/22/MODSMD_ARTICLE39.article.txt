# Seers Pick Cards Over Huskies
## 
### 
With a seasonal batting average of
.607 for the 28 grid games predicted
to date, the Dippy's peerless pig
skin pickers venture forth boldly
to put down in black and white their
scientific findings.
Stanford has played three foot
ball games and the Dippy's average
is nil in predicting the fortunes of
Tiny's warriors. The sports- scriv
eners called it Stanford in those first
two debacles and changed at the
wrong time, picking U.C.L.A. to win
two weeks ago. This time the peer
less boys claim their luck is going
to change . . . the score—Stanford
13, Washington 7.
The game over at Berkeley is
given to our friend the Golden Bear.
The score . . . California 20, U.S.C. 7.
U.C.L.A. is rated a good chance to
pull out of the slump that the In
dians pushed them into . . . The score
—U.C.L.A. 14, Washington State 6.
The other conference struggle is
between the two Oregon outfits, and
after a long debate the denizens of
the Daily shack came forth with . . .
The score—Oregon 14, Oregon State

All three of the local independent
teams are favored by the Daily seers.
The scores ... St. Mary's 20, Idaho
0; Santa Clara 13, Loyola 7; and
U.S.F. 7, Gonzaga 6.
