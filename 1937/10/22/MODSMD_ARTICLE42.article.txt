### 
ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 21
(U.R).—A truck driver from. Cleve
land came to the witness sta»d in
Ejssex county court today and swore
that John Montague, who became
famous on the gold links of Holly
wood, was his companion in crime
seven years ago.
The witness was Roger Norton,
who pleaded guilty to participating
in the robbery of a roadhouse in
1930 and who served two years in
prison for the crime which Monta
gue is standing trial for here in the
heart of the Adirondack Mountains.
Norton's story was that he, La
verne Moore, William Carleton and
John Sherry plotted the holdup.
Cai'leton and Norton served prison
terms. Sherry was killed when his
car went off the road while he was
fleeing from the scene of the crime.
Moore disappeared and was not
brought back for trial until stories
trickled out of California about a
super-golfer called Montague.
