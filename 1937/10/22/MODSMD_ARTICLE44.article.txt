# Farm Soccer Squad Battles U.S.F. Here
## Cards Hope for Second Conference Win In Tomorrow's Contest 
### 
Having auspiciously opened the
California Intercollegiate Soccer
season with a 2-0 victory over San
Mateo last week, Stanford's varsity
soccerites will seek their second
conference win tomorrow at 10
o'clock, when they meet the San
Francisco Dons here instead of at
San Francisco, as originally sched
uled.
The Dons, in losing to the cham
pion California Bears, 7-5, displayed
a strong offensive eleven, but were
weak on defense. They will be after
their first conference victory of the
season.
Lost to Menlo
In a practice game Wednesday
against Menlo Jaysee, Stanford was
caught off balance and nosed out,
1-0, on a long goal from midfield by
Menlo's Don Berry. The Indians
had the bail in enemy territory dur
ing most of the game â€¢ and kept
storming the Menlo goal, but were
unable to penetrate it.
Despite the unexpected setback,
Coach Harry Maloney still has faith
in his first string, and by making a
few minor changes in positions
hopes to acquire a better passing
attack and scoring punch.
New Line-up
The new line-up reads as fol
lows: Louis Faulb, goalie; Ken
Cuthbertson, left forward; Bill
Hamilton, right forward; Burnett
Walker, left halfback; George
Hatch, center halfback; Dick Han
na, right forward; Tevfick Sadullah,
outside left; Ed Gudewill, inside
left; Captain Dave Sloane, center
forward; Karl Schaupp, inside right;
John de Benedetti, outside right.
Stanford's frosh eleven will at
tempt to enter the win column for
the first time at this after
noon when they tangle here with
Polytechnic High School.
