GUNS blazed in Europe ... a band played
a march . . . there was a plea for Democ
racy ... a call for men . . .
Some of them went from Stanford.
Seventy-seven of those didn't come back.
Nearly twenty years ago, that was, but this
Sunday, Stanford erases those years with the
dedication of a great new Memorial Hall, a
building constructed from contributions from
the students of the University, and devoted to
the memory of the Stanford men and women
who gave their lives in the Great War.
The Memorial Hall will stand as a tribute to
them.
But it can stand for more than that.

It will cut a line in the Stanford horizon as a
Memorial Hall, memorial of the guns that still
roar, the bands that will play, the call that will
come, the men that will go, and the men that
won't come back.
It is a memorial that there is still war, that men
are still dying, that more Stanford names may
be added to the bronze tablet in its vaulted
lobby.
War is not over. The world is convulsed with
it today.
The Memorial Hall is a memorial to those who
died last time.
It should stand as the omnipresent WARN
ING to those who WILL DIE NEXT TIME.
