# Cal Goes Practical
## 
### 
WHILE Stanford's course in labor problems
has doubled its popularity, U.C. student
workers have taken a different lead and decided
to get some practical experience by organizing
a union.
Purpose of the union is to be a "federation in
which students who are dependent upon part
time work for income during their college years
can associate to discuss problems arising be
tween employers and students, and to work
out some solution to these problems."
In spite of some faculty skepticism, the fun
damental premise and purpose of the union ap
pears to be good. It is not intended as a copy of
militant trade unions, but is designed purely and
simply as student safety valve.
As long as the union governing body adheres
to this type of program and avoids aggressive
demonstrations of the usual type, the union will
probably be successful.
However, in an institution such as the Uni
versity of California, where the administration
has a reputation for conservatism, authorities
will not long tolerate labor demonstrations or
strong arm methods. As long as the union can
be kept in accord with recognized principles of
unionism, much may be acomplished.
Time will tell if Cal's experiment will work
out. It sounds good, but its leaders must avoid
two obvious pitfalls. If they take themselves
too seriously and follow in the steps of con
temporary labor leaders they are due for trouble
from University authorities. If, on the other
hand, they seem insincere, the students will
lose interest.
Cognizant of these dangers, union leaders
start next week to show the stuff of which they
are made. It's a great idea—if it works.—J. R.

of his birth, is like a turnip. There is nothing
