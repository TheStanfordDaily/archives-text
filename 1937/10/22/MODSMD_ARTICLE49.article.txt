# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
WITH A BANG BANG
"V"ESTERDAY Irvin Jorgensen, Our Hasher of yes
teryear, and champion of the distressed in any
old year, stampeded through 15 inches of The Daily
leaving behind a chaos of militant brotherly love and
scorching remarks. After half a dozen futile attempts
to follow the course of Jorgi's verbal dervish dancing,
I fell back on the psychic technique that got me
through Econ 1, and I can summarize his remarks as
follows: (1) he doesn't like the way I part my col
umnistic hair; (2) he believes that Bull Session has
catered to the "sofa-pillow" philosophy of sympathiz
ing but doing nothing; (3) he believes that sending
mcdical aid to the Spanish Loyalists is a noble and
glorious undertaking.
There are also a couple of references to Roosevelt,
Ihe State Department and the United States govern
ment, which I assume to be flattering. In the rest of
the letter, various ones of my brain children are
dragged forth screaming and mutilated before my
eyes.

If I can ever find Jorgi when he is not having a
coke with a beautiful girl or just slamming down the
highway for a committee meeting, I shall tell him
gently that he has been worrying too much about
the sad plight of constitutional democracy, and that
he really should get more sleep and go to a movie
once in a while. What I said in my comment on
his student committee was that if we could stand
seeing our doctors killed, the project was a grand one.
What I meant was that giving medical aid to the
Spanish was a very fine thing but it wasn't worth
risking a war of our own.
President Roosevelt, the State Department, and the
Unitde States government look very imposing in type.
But they won't be able to stop a war if the American
people (God bless them) get mad when their doctors
are shot. The question I raised was: can the American
people keep their temper or can't they?

A, ND after I have thus turned the other cheek and
gently set his feet on the way to Truth, I shall
fix Jorgi with a piercing eye and let drive with both
barrels of sofa-pillow philosophy.
Stanford is not a rotary club, and it is not an insti
ll! tionalized uplift movement. It is (brace yourself,
Jorgi) a university, and its purpose is to teach stu
dents, not to aid strickcn minorities. As a university
it plays the part of an observer, not a campaign
nanager for "constitutional democracy."

If this is a sofa-pillow culture pattern, then I cheer
fully plead guilty of upholding it. It is a grand thing
to help the oppressed Chinese, or Spaniards, or what
have you, but. we have quito enough trouble at home
without mixing in anybody else's war. If we can give
help without getting involved, fine. But if we can't
let's be apathetic and stay home.
I may be a spineless worm; I may have the back
bone of a milkshake. But for some obscure reason
I prefer sofa-pillow.-. In bullets.
