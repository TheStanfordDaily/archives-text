# WAR ON SYPHILIS

decision as to whether Stanford or any other
university should institute the Wassermann test
as a means of combatting syphilis would necessarily
depend upon what value has been found in testing
college students for the disease.
Dr. C. E. Shepard, director of the men's health
service here, considers compulsory Wassermanns in
Stanford unnecessary.
He points out University of Minnesota instituted
the compulsory test, partly as an experiment, and es
tablished that this social disease is apparently rare
among university-age youth.
At Minnesota in one year the compulsory test was
administered to 7000 students. Of this total, six posi
tive cases of syphilis were found. But only one victim
was an undergraduate and three of the six already
were undergoing treatment. A previous study at
Berea College had given approximately the same
result.
On this basis, then, it would appAr that Stanford,
among its 4000-odd students, would have perhaps two
syphilitics. To find these two, Dr. Shepard estimates,
would cost $1000. And with $1000, he believes, much
more effective preventive work could and should be
carried on in fighting tuberculosis and in giving other
medical aid to students.
"However, I am perfectly willing to have a com
pulsory test ruling if the students want it," he says.
"It's simply that I feel discovery of tuberculosis is
more important to us and that other preventive pro
cedures would bring benefit to a larger number of
students."

JJR. SHEPARD, here eight years, says the health
service has not found a case of syphilis in that
time.
Probably unknown to the majority of students is
the fact that free Wassermanns are given by the
health service to those for whom the test seems in
dicated.
In connection with this indication of infection, Dr.
Shepard points out that about 10 days after exposure
to the disease a lesion will appear at the point of
contact. Microscopic examination of matter from the
lesion will reveal the spirochete of syphilis. From
four to six weeks after exposure, still in the first stage
of the disease, the spirochetes enter the blood stream
and the Wassermann test will give a positive result.
It is during the time the lesion is visible that the
health service would prefer to locate the disease; for
then probability of a cure is greatest. By the time the
Wassermann becomes valuable, the percentage of
cures is being reduced.
Therefore, Dr. Shepard believes more value is
gained from the free service, carried on without the
unfavorable, widespread publicity which the univer
sity might receive if tests were compulsory, or if
social diseases were widespread in college students.

"However, I am perfectly willing to have a com
pulsory test ruling if the students want it," he says.
"It's simply that I feel discovery of tuberculosis is
more important to us and that other preventive pro
cedures would bring benefit to a larger number of
students."

JJR. SHEPARD, here eight years, says the health
service has not found a case of syphilis in that
time.
Probably unknown to the majority of students is
the fact that free Wassermanns are given by the
health service to those for whom the test seems in
dicated.
In connection with this indication of infection, Dr.
Shepard points out that about 10 days after exposure
to the disease a lesion will appear at the point of
contact. Microscopic examination of matter from the
lesion will reveal the spirochete of syphilis. From
four to six weeks after exposure, still in the first stage
of the disease, the spirochetes enter the blood stream
and the Wassermann test will give a positive result.
It is during the time the lesion is visible that the
health service would prefer to locate the disease; for
then probability of a cure is greatest. By the time the
Wassermann becomes valuable, the percentage of
cures is being reduced.
Therefore, Dr. Shepard believes more value is
gained from the free service, carried on without the
unfavorable, widespread publicity which the univer
sity might receive if tests were compulsory, or if
social diseases were widespread in college students.
decision as to whether Stanford or any other
university should institute the Wassermann test
as a means of combatting syphilis would necessarily
depend upon what value has been found in testing
college students for the disease.
Dr. C. E. Shepard, director of the men's health
service here, considers compulsory Wassermanns in
Stanford unnecessary.
He points out University of Minnesota instituted
the compulsory test, partly as an experiment, and es
tablished that this social disease is apparently rare
among university-age youth.
At Minnesota in one year the compulsory test was
administered to 7000 students. Of this total, six posi
tive cases of syphilis were found. But only one victim
was an undergraduate and three of the six already
were undergoing treatment. A previous study at
Berea College had given approximately the same
result.
On this basis, then, it would appAr that Stanford,
among its 4000-odd students, would have perhaps two
syphilitics. To find these two, Dr. Shepard estimates,
would cost $1000. And with $1000, he believes, much
more effective preventive work could and should be
carried on in fighting tuberculosis and in giving other
medical aid to students.
