## "WOMAN'S PLACE" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
From rather a safe position be
hind the firing lines it is with a
huge sigh of relief that I noted
Barbara Murphy's comment upon
the advisability of the women join
ing in on the Pajamarino.
Miss Murphy—the cute Irish lass
—feels that women would not look
suitable wearing pajamas during
the Pajamarino. And indeed it is a
comforting thought that modesty
once again is among us. She re
alizes that women's place is in the
home; of course I suppose it doesn't
matter whose home, as that is only
a minor detail nowadays.
Still it is a bit of a contrast to
have the women's editor tell us one
day that if we don't like the way
women dress or wear their stock
ings we can politely go to hell, and
then the next day hear the hearten
ing words that, perhaps after all,
there are some limits to what the
women think will be approved.
"In their pajamas?" queries Miss
Murphy in a tone that suggests pa
jamas were strictly tabu in public,
but a visit to any beach would stifle
that angle. Pajamas everywhere,
and not bad, either. The truth is
and always will be that the only
thing the women fear is unfavor
able comment upon something or
the other, and surely, from what
we've seen from a long way off,
Miss Murphy's attitude can't pos
sibly be a defense mechanism.
And so what I want to know is
"why not?" and let 'em stutter
around answering that. Is this or is
this not a liberal university?
What Miss Murphy's question
sounds like is an expression of a
representative female attitude that
all men are unalterably . evil
minded.
Well, the women needn't be so
conceited.
