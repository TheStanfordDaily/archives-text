# Ritz Brothers Go Beserk In College Film
## 
### 
"LIFE BEGINS AT COLLEGE," at
Stanford Theater.
The first starring vehicle of the
Ritz Brothers, "Life Begins at Col
lege," is the sort of picture to be
expected from the three kings of
slap-stick. Not subtly humorous;
rather, uproariously funny. The an
tics of the Ritz Brothers are ably
supported by that ungraceful
dancer, Joan Davis. *
What plot there is concerns the
football destinies of Lombardy Col-

lege. The alumni
board is not satis
fied with the
team's coach,
O'H a r a (Fred
Stone) has been
i producing;' so
they hire the
services of a
younger coach. An
Indian (Nat Pen
dleton), who has
made millions in

oil, arrives on the scene and is taken
into the Rho Delta Rho fraternity,
the only other members of which
are the Ritz Brothers. With the In- '
dian's money, the dean of the school
is bribed into keeping Coach O'Hara. i
The Indian proves to be a phe
nomenal player and carries Lom
bardy to victory after victory until
in the big game with Midwestern j
he is found to be ineligible for hav
ing played professional.
The Ritz Brothers are sent in by
mistake and after a number of pen
alties for insulting the referee, one 1
of them throws a high pass, runs
down and catches it, runs for the
winning score.
One of the funniest sequences I
shows the three Ritz Brothers
knocked flat on a muddy field, leav- ;
ing a perfect imprint of their bodies
on the turf.
