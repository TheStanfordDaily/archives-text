# Half-Million Troops Fight For Shanghai
## Sino – Japanese Battle In Furious Struggle Along 20-mile Front 
### 
SHANGHAI, Friday, Oct. 22 (U.R).
—More than a half million men were
locked in furious combat along a 20-
mile front today in what both Japa
nese and Chinese military leaders
predicted would be a "showdown
battle for Shanghai."
The Japanese high command, in
formed by diplomatic leaders that it
must win a major victory before the
meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty
nations in Brussels next week, of
fered every resource thrown into
the battle to drive the Chinese off
the Yangtse delta.
General Iwane Matsui, supreme
commander of Japanese military
forces on the Shanghai front, took
personal charge of the new offensive,
in which nearly 200,000 Japanese
were engaged.
Counter-Attack
The Chinese, with nearly twice as
many men, replied with a general
counter-offensive along the entire
Shanghai front.
As dawn broke over a fire-red
dened city, after a night of some of
the fiercest fighting of the war, the
Chinese appeared to be holding their
own. Military experts estimated
7,000 casualties on both sides, about
equally divided.
Japs Repulsed
The fiercest struggle was at the
battered North Station, within a few
blocks of the International Settle
ment, where the Japanese batteries
opened an artillery duel that rever
berated over the city.
In the wake of the artillery bar
rage, Japanese detachments plunged
through a flaming inferno, set by
their own shells, in a desperate ef
fort to take the station. The Chinese,
entrenched in shell craters and the
wreckage of buildings that have
been pounded incessantly since the
war started, drove them back.
Batteries Fire
Furious fighting broke out along
Szechuan road where Japanese bat
teries in Hongkew Park, to the east,
and Chinese batteries near Mark
ham road, to the west, began to
pound each other.
The Japanese, in the meantime,
had begun the key operation in their
new offensive northwest of the city,
smashing at the Chinese rear lines
at Tazang, which has been under
constant attack for three days. The
reinforced assault was with tanks,
machine guns, and mobile artillery.

berated over the city.
In the wake of the artillery bar
rage, Japanese detachments plunged
through a flaming inferno, set by
their own shells, in a desperate ef
fort to take the station. The Chinese,
entrenched in shell craters and the
wreckage of buildings that have
been pounded incessantly since the
war started, drove them back.
Batteries Fire
Furious fighting broke out along
Szechuan road where Japanese bat
teries in Hongkew Park, to the east,
and Chinese batteries near Mark
ham road, to the west, began to
pound each other.
The Japanese, in the meantime,
had begun the key operation in their
new offensive northwest of the city,
smashing at the Chinese rear lines
at Tazang, which has been under
constant attack for three days. The
reinforced assault was with tanks,
machine guns, and mobile artillery.
SHANGHAI, Friday, Oct. 22 (U.R).
—More than a half million men were
locked in furious combat along a 20-
mile front today in what both Japa
nese and Chinese military leaders
predicted would be a "showdown
battle for Shanghai."
The Japanese high command, in
formed by diplomatic leaders that it
must win a major victory before the
meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty
nations in Brussels next week, of
fered every resource thrown into
the battle to drive the Chinese off
the Yangtse delta.
General Iwane Matsui, supreme
commander of Japanese military
forces on the Shanghai front, took
personal charge of the new offensive,
in which nearly 200,000 Japanese
were engaged.
Counter-Attack
The Chinese, with nearly twice as
many men, replied with a general
counter-offensive along the entire
Shanghai front.
As dawn broke over a fire-red
dened city, after a night of some of
the fiercest fighting of the war, the
Chinese appeared to be holding their
own. Military experts estimated
7,000 casualties on both sides, about
equally divided.
Japs Repulsed
The fiercest struggle was at the
battered North Station, within a few
blocks of the International Settle
ment, where the Japanese batteries
opened an artillery duel that rever
berated over the city.
