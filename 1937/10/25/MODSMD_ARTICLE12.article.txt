# Mammoth Stage Sets Feature of Two Plays
## 
### 
Massive settings and special stage effects that were impossible in the
days of the old Assembly Hall plays will be featured in "Murder in the
Cathedral" and "Trial by Jury." This double bill, which will be presented
next Friday afternoon and Saturday evening, is the first regular student
production in new Memorial Hall.
The set for T. S. Eliot's "Murder in the Cathedral," designed by Phil
Brown, occupies all the space on the huge' stage as well as part of the

orchestra pit, the side aprons, and<
the balconies that flank the pro
scenium arch.
Chorus on Steps
A mammoth hexagonal ramp
stretches from the footlights to the
cathedral altar at the rear wall of
the stage. Arches rise 32 feet into
the air. A flight of steps descends
into the orchestra pit from which a
chorus of peasant women will rise.
Special lighting effects have been
arranged by Brown to silhouette the
chorus against the changing illumi
nation of the background.
Waldemar Johansen, technical di
rector of dramatics, has designed a
setting for "Trial by Jury" which can
be wheeled onto the stage for the
second half of the double bill. A
judge's bench, witness stand, and
old-fashioned court room properties
in gay nineties style are used in the
Gilbert and Sullivan musical satire.
Scenery Unique
The chorus, which is the audience
at the mock trial, is seated on a
large balcony 14 feet in the air, over
looking the colorful scene. Comic
cupids at the top of the stage height
en the cffect of the production.
Scenery of this kind has never
been seen on the Farm befoi'e, ex
cept in the summer quarter presen
tation of "Twelfth Night" which
opened Memorial Hall.
The plays are being presented
under the auspices of the Stanford
Mothers' Club, and the proceeds will
go to the support of the Men's and
Women's Rest Homes, scholarships,
and student aid.
