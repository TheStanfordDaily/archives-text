# Farm Fireman Waters Bear
## 
### 
California and Stanford are at
it again! It's not the football or
the basketball or the track
teams that are at war this time
—it's the fire departments.
With fire extinguishers full
of water, Stanford's Tom Col
lins and Cal's former basket
ball captain, Ray Olson, "went
at it" yesterday afternoon in
front of the fire station. When
the war clouds had passed over
Olson looked like a drowned
bear — well, he was anyway —
while Collins resembled your
shower curtain.
Unbiased Stanford fireladdies
gave the decision to Collins.
California authorities could
not be x-eached for comment.
