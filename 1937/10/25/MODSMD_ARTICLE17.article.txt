# Farm Cars Run Ford-Cord Gamut
## 
### DORR HALLENBECK 
Time, tide, and the machine age
march on, but they are not leaving
Henry Ford and Stanford's students
behind. More cars, mostly Fords,
seems to be the trend.
Since the first jalopi chugged
around the Farm 25 years ago, much
gasoline has flowed under the
bridge. By last year 1425 cars were
milling about the campus. Now, the
grand total has reached 1625, giving
poor Gordy and George just 200
more problem children to mind.
Anyone who wants to walk
through the parking lot by the li
brary can see a fair cross-section of
this mighty fleet. At the super
swanky end of the scale, he may see
a green Cord, or a large gray one.
Or he may run into an historic
Star, or trip over the red and green
Austins of which Hav Fremlin and

Jim Sherman, respectively, are the
hunch-backed owners.
Coupes and roadsters of fairly re
cent vintage dominate the scene, but
there are enough battered, name
less wrecks to drive the would-be
statistician nearly crazy. Observa
tion of 680 cars indicates that Fords,
of which there were 286, comprise
41.5 per cent of the Farm's mounts.
Then come Chevies, 14.8 per cent,
Plymouths, 8.5 per cent, and Pon
tiacs, 6.5 per cent. Oldsmobiles,
Buicks, Dodges, and Chryslers fol
low along, barely in the money.
Of course, there is a little of ev
erything—an occasional Star, Essex,
or Durant, and even, in the medical
section, an Hispano Suiza. Looking
elsewhere than the library, one
might find the Delta Chi squad car.
This year, as last, the frosh have
the fewest cars, the graduate stu
dents the most, with an unbroken in

crease all the way up. Encina and
Roble boast 119 cars; sophs, 238;
juniors, 304; seniors, 457; and grad
uates, 493.
In color combinations there is
little that Stanford has not tried.
Tony Calvelli's red-brown mixture
is ever ready to startle the eye in
front of Encina. Patriotic red and
white jobs are no longer rarities.
A few pure white or suave, cream
colored aristocrats slither around
the campus.
Most drivers are familiar with the
very classy black and white Ford
coupe that intercedes occasionally.
And ready to shame them all, a stark
orange model stands gasless and in
need of repairs behind Encina.
The Hall-Row balance in car
ownership is maintained this year,
as has been in the past. Of course,
men still out-own women by a
great margin.

Star, or trip over the red and green
Austins of which Hav Fremlin and

Jim Sherman, respectively, are the
hunch-backed owners.
Coupes and roadsters of fairly re
cent vintage dominate the scene, but
there are enough battered, name
less wrecks to drive the would-be
statistician nearly crazy. Observa
tion of 680 cars indicates that Fords,
of which there were 286, comprise
41.5 per cent of the Farm's mounts.
Then come Chevies, 14.8 per cent,
Plymouths, 8.5 per cent, and Pon
tiacs, 6.5 per cent. Oldsmobiles,
Buicks, Dodges, and Chryslers fol
low along, barely in the money.
Of course, there is a little of ev
erything—an occasional Star, Essex,
or Durant, and even, in the medical
section, an Hispano Suiza. Looking
elsewhere than the library, one
might find the Delta Chi squad car.
This year, as last, the frosh have
the fewest cars, the graduate stu
dents the most, with an unbroken in

crease all the way up. Encina and
Roble boast 119 cars; sophs, 238;
juniors, 304; seniors, 457; and grad
uates, 493.
In color combinations there is
little that Stanford has not tried.
Tony Calvelli's red-brown mixture
is ever ready to startle the eye in
front of Encina. Patriotic red and
white jobs are no longer rarities.
A few pure white or suave, cream
colored aristocrats slither around
the campus.
Most drivers are familiar with the
very classy black and white Ford
coupe that intercedes occasionally.
And ready to shame them all, a stark
orange model stands gasless and in
need of repairs behind Encina.
The Hall-Row balance in car
ownership is maintained this year,
as has been in the past. Of course,
men still out-own women by a
great margin.
Time, tide, and the machine age
march on, but they are not leaving
Henry Ford and Stanford's students
behind. More cars, mostly Fords,
seems to be the trend.
Since the first jalopi chugged
around the Farm 25 years ago, much
gasoline has flowed under the
bridge. By last year 1425 cars were
milling about the campus. Now, the
grand total has reached 1625, giving
poor Gordy and George just 200
more problem children to mind.
Anyone who wants to walk
through the parking lot by the li
brary can see a fair cross-section of
this mighty fleet. At the super
swanky end of the scale, he may see
a green Cord, or a large gray one.
Or he may run into an historic
Star, or trip over the red and green
Austins of which Hav Fremlin and

Jim Sherman, respectively, are the
