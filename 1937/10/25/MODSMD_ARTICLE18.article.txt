### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, Oct. 25
(UP). â€”A British soldier was kliled
and the lives of at least 14 other
foreigners, including nine Ameri
cans, gravely endangered when
Japanese naval fliers machine-gun
ned a border area of the Shanghai
international settlement on Sunday
afternoon, it was revealed today.
The raid occurred along the edge
of the Anglo-Arr.erican section of
the settlement.
Japanese Explain
The Japanese immediately ex
pressed regrets for the incident and
explained they mistook the Occi
dentals for fleeing Chinese soldiers.
They were frankly worried at the
possibility of foreign complications
as the incident followed repeated
British and American protests
against attacks by Japanese on
foreign-defended areas.
The British soldier, a sentry, was
shot down just outside the British
defense zone barricades, by a Japa
nese naval flier who was power div
ing along the edge of the settlement
and raking highways with machine
gun bullets.
Protest Prepared
British authorities immediately
prepared to deliver a vigorous pro
test, and it was expected London
would demand compensation.
None of the sightseers was hit.
The dead sentry was Rifleman W.
McGowan of the First Battalion of
the Royal Ulster Rifles. He was
killed outside his post in front of a
barricade across Kewsick Road
leading into the British defense sec
tor of the international settlement
from Chinese territory outside.
The same Japanese plane, one of
a squadron power-diving over re
treating Chinese soldiers, fired on a
grou pof British and American
horseback riders near the edge of
the war zone outside the American
Columbia Country Club.
Sightseers Escape
The sightseers escaped, btu at least
two horses were wounded and had
to be killed.
The same flier who killed Mc-
Gowan later machine - gunned an
other sentry post of the Ulster Rifles
on Great Western Road, but there
were no casualties.
Representatives of Read Admiral
Kiyoshi Hasegawa and the Japanese
Consulate General called on the
British Commander-in-Chief, Vice
Admiral Sir Charles Little, and
Consul General Herbert Phillips,
and expressed "deep regrets."
McGowan was the first foreign
soldier to be killed since the fight
ing started around Shanghai. One
American sailor, Seaman Fred
erick J. Falgout of Raceland, La.,
was killed by shrapnel when a shell
fell on the U.S.S. Augusta, flagship
of the American Asiatic fleet.
The British ambassador to China,
Sir Hughe Knatchbull - Hugessen,
was machine-gunner by a Japanese
plane while motoring from Nanking
to Shanghai, and was wounded dan
gerously.
