# Former Stanford Man To Talk Here
## 
### 
"Bringing the Forty-niners to
Life" is the topic to be discussed by
Robin Lampson, former Stanford
student and well known author,
when he returns to the Farm to lec
ture at the Tuesday Evening Series
at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow night in
Memorial Hall, under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exer
cises.
Lampson has written several
books of both poetry and prose,
most famous of which is "Laughter
Out of the Ground," a novel on the
California gold rush period. He has
also contributed to numerous Eng
lish and American periodicals, in
cluding The Literary Digest. Scrib
ner's Magazine, and Esquire.
Lampson's interest in the gold
rush is attributed to his early back
ground and pioneer grandfathers.
Lampson was born in 1900 in Moke
lumne Hill, Calaveras County.
After three years at Stanford be
was sent to Russia by the Quakers
as a famine relief worker in 1922.
In 1932 Lampson graduated from the
University of California with hon
ors and a membership in Phi beta
Kappa.
