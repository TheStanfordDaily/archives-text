# Indians "Cash In" On Breaks; Trim Washington 13-7
## Huskies Outgain Stanford but Cards Score as Ends Shine 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Stanford's victorious football team will arrive in I'alo Alto at 10:30
o'clock this morning aboard a Southern Pacific train, according to a
telegram received by The Daily late last night from Yell Leader Jim
RansohofT, who accompanied the team north.

Breaks, were they? Well, whatever you call them, they were hard
earned, and the Stanford boys knew what to do with them.
They can't call it a break when Bill Willard charges fast into the
Washington backlield and blocks a punt which finally lands in the hands
of Grant Stone for the first tally in a 13-7 score.

When the Indians got the ball
after a Washington fumble on the
Husky 17-yard line, they had a
chance to prove to doubtful fans
that they had at last overcome their
jinx on the goal-line drive, and
Jim Groves carried the ball through
left tackle for the second touch
down,
Paulman Kicks Point
And they can't say we reached
scoring territory on breaks. It was
Tony Calvelli, speed personified,
who ran to the 3-yard line to stop
the ball, kicked by Peter Fay, be
fore it could cross the goal-line.
The second drive resulted from a
fumbled ball after an excellent 39-
yard boot by Bill Paulman dead to
the 6-yard line.
Coaches had insisted that Paul
man, still bothered after a dislocated

collar-bone, would be good for not
more than three minutes, but the
silent blond quarterback went in
and garnered an extra point after
the Cards' first touchdown and
stayed through the third quarter.
Tackles Effective
Defensively the Big Red Machine
was hot. Willard, the tall sophomore
from Oklahoma, put on a perform
ance that will practically cinch him
a regular spot on the left flank. He
made plenty of nice tackles, showed
considerable speed in covering
punts, and caught two passes for
sizeable gains. *
Stone, playing on an empty stom
ach after a recent illness, played his
usual excellent game. He made a
series of beautiful and decisive tack
les, beginning with one early in the
first quarter after chasing Fritz Was
kowitz for a 15-yard loss. And he
ran down with his old speed to cover
Indian punts.
While Stone and Willard protect
ed the flanks, Pete Zagar starred
again at left tackle. The Calvelli-
Matthews combination kept the cen
ter of the line a stone wall.
Veterans on Toes
Backing up the line in fine style
was Gene Coldiron, who kept his
territory well-covered and made
some real tackles. A1 Alustiza, who
started at quarter, also turned in a
fine performance.
Groves did a lot of really out
standing passing, kicking, block
ing, and tackling. And Stanford's
spinner plays with Groves taking
the ball were smoother than ever.
It appears that Groves will join
Stone in the running for all-Coast
honors.
Peter Fay, at left half for the In
dians, presented the second act of
an excellent kicking performance
begun two weeks ago against
U.C.L.A.
Stanford, now in second place, is
still able to tic for first, but the
boys will have to win some tough
games first.

the ball were smoother than ever.
It appears that Groves will join
Stone in the running for all-Coast
honors.
Peter Fay, at left half for the In
dians, presented the second act of
an excellent kicking performance
begun two weeks ago against
U.C.L.A.
Stanford, now in second place, is
still able to tic for first, but the
boys will have to win some tough
games first.
Stanford's victorious football team will arrive in I'alo Alto at 10:30
o'clock this morning aboard a Southern Pacific train, according to a
telegram received by The Daily late last night from Yell Leader Jim
RansohofT, who accompanied the team north.

Breaks, were they? Well, whatever you call them, they were hard
earned, and the Stanford boys knew what to do with them.
They can't call it a break when Bill Willard charges fast into the
Washington backlield and blocks a punt which finally lands in the hands
of Grant Stone for the first tally in a 13-7 score.

When the Indians got the ball
after a Washington fumble on the
Husky 17-yard line, they had a
chance to prove to doubtful fans
that they had at last overcome their
jinx on the goal-line drive, and
Jim Groves carried the ball through
left tackle for the second touch
down,
Paulman Kicks Point
And they can't say we reached
scoring territory on breaks. It was
Tony Calvelli, speed personified,
who ran to the 3-yard line to stop
the ball, kicked by Peter Fay, be
fore it could cross the goal-line.
The second drive resulted from a
fumbled ball after an excellent 39-
yard boot by Bill Paulman dead to
the 6-yard line.
Coaches had insisted that Paul
man, still bothered after a dislocated

collar-bone, would be good for not
more than three minutes, but the
silent blond quarterback went in
and garnered an extra point after
the Cards' first touchdown and
stayed through the third quarter.
Tackles Effective
Defensively the Big Red Machine
was hot. Willard, the tall sophomore
from Oklahoma, put on a perform
ance that will practically cinch him
a regular spot on the left flank. He
made plenty of nice tackles, showed
considerable speed in covering
punts, and caught two passes for
sizeable gains. *
Stone, playing on an empty stom
ach after a recent illness, played his
usual excellent game. He made a
series of beautiful and decisive tack
les, beginning with one early in the
first quarter after chasing Fritz Was
kowitz for a 15-yard loss. And he
ran down with his old speed to cover
Indian punts.
While Stone and Willard protect
ed the flanks, Pete Zagar starred
again at left tackle. The Calvelli-
Matthews combination kept the cen
ter of the line a stone wall.
Veterans on Toes
Backing up the line in fine style
was Gene Coldiron, who kept his
territory well-covered and made
some real tackles. A1 Alustiza, who
started at quarter, also turned in a
fine performance.
Groves did a lot of really out
standing passing, kicking, block
ing, and tackling. And Stanford's
spinner plays with Groves taking
the ball were smoother than ever.

Stone in the running for all-Coast
