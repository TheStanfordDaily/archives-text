# German Instructor Heads Trips Abroad
## 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Every year Stanley L. Sharp,
German instructor, declares that he
has taken a group of Stanford stu
dents to Europe for the last time —
not because he doesn't enjoy the trip,
but because he and Mrs. Sharp have
been abroad a good deal by now.
Every year, however, student de
mand is so great that he weakens.
"Besides," Mr. Sharp compromises,
"we can always find some place we
haven't been before; next summer
jt will be Scandinavia."
Last summer 28 Stanford men
and women had their first taste
of Europe under the Sharps' able
guidance. One of the things that
makes these trips most pleasant, is
that the number of men and
women is kept as even as possible.
Professor Sharp has a secret that
enables him to do this. If the party
travels third class, which they find
just as comfortable and enjoyable
as any other, men come along. It
seems fathers will fork out for their
daughters where they won't for their
sons.
Every year the Sharps vary the
trip, though it always includes Eng
land, France, Germany, and Swit
zerland. Last summer they added
Holland, Belgium, and Czechoslo
vakia. »
Because of the size of the party,
and the fact that all members were
American students, unusual op
portunities were open to them.
They received complimentary
tickets to the House of Parliament,
where they heard Anthony Eden,
British Foreign Secretary. When
they went to London they had a
chance to see the King and Queen
at close range, coming out of
Buckingham Palace.
In Friedrichshafen—Lakehurst of
Germany—the tourists were taken
through the new Zeppelin under
construction there — the first one
built to use helium gas. They also
went through the tunnels under the
Rheinfels, largest of the Rhein cas
tles, visited a toy factory in Nurem
berg, and inspected one of the largest
wineries in Germany, at Bacharach
in the Rheinland.
The trip also packed a few first
class thrills, especially when a lake
steamer with all the party on
board nearly capsized on Lake
Constanz, and when Fred Kimball
picked up a German soldier's shoe,
complete with foot, on the battle
field at Amiens. Also found at
Amiens was a German toothbrush
labeled "durability guaranteed."
Over 4000 pictures of the trip were
taken—almost everyone had a cam

era. Professor Sharp and Eddie
Gudewill had motion picture cam
eras, and the latter took over 1200
feet of color film.
Among the highlights of the tour
was a visit to Prague, where a spe
cial reception was given for the stu
dents by the American Institute.
There they visited the famous homes
for the socially incompetent, estab
lished by Czechoslovakia's late
President Masaryk, and the famous
Prague broadcasting station.
There was plenty «» fun too, ac
cording to Dick Stepp, and the
height of it was reached when a
group of the students entertained
in Munich's Hofbrau House with
"Come Join the Band" and the
Axe Yell, led by Fred Baker.
Among the students who were
along arc Bob Haslachcr, Carol Run
dall, Dorothy Baker, Betsy MacEl
roy, Louise Howell, Jenny Hill, Mu
riel Pallia, Kay Cripe, Marge Se
gerstrom, Mary Kuechler, Henry
Schlage, Ernie Wuthmann, Bill Hen
derson, and Alberta Cardin.
Marge Dooling, Selby Mohr, Norm
Hager, Bill Edwards, Harry Minor,
Elizabeth Myers, Tom Newell, Bill
Bloomer, Jean Hai'ris, Ed Mumford,
and Helene Kohl also made the trip.
Students interested in taking a
similar trip next year, going to
Scandinavia instead of Belgium,
Holland, and Czechoslovakia, should
see Professor Sharp in the German
department.

They received complimentary
tickets to the House of Parliament,
where they heard Anthony Eden,
British Foreign Secretary. When
they went to London they had a
chance to see the King and Queen
at close range, coming out of
Buckingham Palace.
In Friedrichshafen—Lakehurst of
Germany—the tourists were taken
through the new Zeppelin under
construction there — the first one
built to use helium gas. They also
went through the tunnels under the
Rheinfels, largest of the Rhein cas
tles, visited a toy factory in Nurem
berg, and inspected one of the largest
wineries in Germany, at Bacharach
in the Rheinland.
The trip also packed a few first
class thrills, especially when a lake
steamer with all the party on
board nearly capsized on Lake
Constanz, and when Fred Kimball
picked up a German soldier's shoe,
complete with foot, on the battle
field at Amiens. Also found at
Amiens was a German toothbrush
labeled "durability guaranteed."
Over 4000 pictures of the trip were
taken—almost everyone had a cam

era. Professor Sharp and Eddie
Gudewill had motion picture cam
eras, and the latter took over 1200
feet of color film.
Among the highlights of the tour
was a visit to Prague, where a spe
cial reception was given for the stu
dents by the American Institute.
There they visited the famous homes
for the socially incompetent, estab
lished by Czechoslovakia's late
President Masaryk, and the famous
Prague broadcasting station.
There was plenty «» fun too, ac
cording to Dick Stepp, and the
height of it was reached when a
group of the students entertained
in Munich's Hofbrau House with
"Come Join the Band" and the
Axe Yell, led by Fred Baker.
Among the students who were
along arc Bob Haslachcr, Carol Run
dall, Dorothy Baker, Betsy MacEl
roy, Louise Howell, Jenny Hill, Mu
riel Pallia, Kay Cripe, Marge Se
gerstrom, Mary Kuechler, Henry
Schlage, Ernie Wuthmann, Bill Hen
derson, and Alberta Cardin.
Marge Dooling, Selby Mohr, Norm
Hager, Bill Edwards, Harry Minor,
Elizabeth Myers, Tom Newell, Bill
Bloomer, Jean Hai'ris, Ed Mumford,
and Helene Kohl also made the trip.
Students interested in taking a
similar trip next year, going to
Scandinavia instead of Belgium,
Holland, and Czechoslovakia, should
see Professor Sharp in the German
department.
Every year Stanley L. Sharp,
German instructor, declares that he
has taken a group of Stanford stu
dents to Europe for the last time —
not because he doesn't enjoy the trip,
but because he and Mrs. Sharp have
been abroad a good deal by now.
Every year, however, student de
mand is so great that he weakens.
"Besides," Mr. Sharp compromises,
"we can always find some place we
haven't been before; next summer
jt will be Scandinavia."
Last summer 28 Stanford men
and women had their first taste
of Europe under the Sharps' able
guidance. One of the things that
makes these trips most pleasant, is
that the number of men and
women is kept as even as possible.
Professor Sharp has a secret that
enables him to do this. If the party
travels third class, which they find
just as comfortable and enjoyable
as any other, men come along. It
seems fathers will fork out for their
daughters where they won't for their
sons.

trip, though it always includes Eng
land, France, Germany, and Swit
zerland. Last summer they added
Holland, Belgium, and Czechoslo
