Coach Elwyn Bugge's fencers ap
peared to be well on their way
toward retaining the Heron Fencing
Trophy after a 14 to 11 win Friday
over the Funke Academy of San
Francisco.
Edwin Woods and Herbert Wool
ley of Stanford each won four of
their five matches. In the two com

ley each have defeated nine of their
ten opponents.
Davey added three more wins for
the Indians while Holman took two
matches and Moscovics one.
The Heron Trophy, emblematic of
foils supremacy for seven northern
