# Daily Pigskin Pickers Boost Seering Score
## 
### 
Needless to say, the Dippy's peer
less pigskin pickers went on a toot '
Saturday night in celebration of
their first correct score of the sea
son. It happened at Seattle when
Stanford's Indians brought honor j
to the Daily seers with a 13-7 win
over Washington.
The sports scriveners made it the
sixth game of the year that they
have missed by a matter of a con
version or two when they called the
game at Berkeley, Cal 20, U.S.C. 7.
The score was 20-6 in favor of the
Bears.
A new week-end record was hung
up by the peerless seers who clicked
on five out of seven games for an
average of .714, bringing their sea
sonal batting average for 35 predic
tions up to .628.
The two miscues occurred when
Washington State nosed out U.C.L.A. |
3-0 and Oregon State turned on
Oregon to win, 14-0. The Daily boys I
called those games, U.C.L.A. 14,
W.S.C. 6, and Oregon 14, Oregon
State 7.
The three local independent teams '
all came through to save the fair j
name of {he typewriter pounders. St. I
Mary's won from Idaho, 6-0, the j
score being called S.M. 20, Idaho 0. |
Santa Clara turned back Loyola, 7-0, ;
the prediction reading S.C. 13, Loy- j
ola 7. U.S.F. came through to whip
Gonzaga 7-0, with the peerless boys ;
calling it 7-6 in favor of the Frisco
Dons.
