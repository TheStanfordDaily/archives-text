AT LAST—THE
AVALANCHE
I've been holding my breath —
waiting for something like this to
happen all quarter. At last the ava
lanche came down on my head. It
all happened in Friday's Slants
when I said something pretty derog
atory about Harry Maloney's soccer
squads.
In the process of predicting the
week-end victors in the various
sports of interest to Farm fans, I
made the rash statement, "Stan
ford never had strong soccer
teams . . . and the Dons should
win this game by a pretty big
score."
Harry was quick to make me
realize how wrong it was to jump
at conclusions and pound out state
ments without facts to back them
up. With bowed head I hereby wish
to make retribution.
BOY, WHAT TEAMS—
CARDS DID ALL RIGHT
A look at Stanford's impressive
soccer record makes me wince a
little. When I wrote what I did I
was thinking only of the last few
years when Stanford hasn't won a
championship crown in the shin
kicking game. But let's ramble back
over the years and peek into the
glorious, past of Cardinal soccer
teams.
From 1910 to 1920 the Indians
won six championships—no less.
These same cardinal and white
teams hung up a record by wal
loping Cal seven years in a row.
..In 1920 Stanford started one of
the greatest win streaks in na
tional soccer history. For five
years Maloney-coached elevens
trampled coast teams to score 42
straight victories. And who was
playing goalie? None other than
our own A1 Masters, one of the
coast's greatest goal guards. A1
never lost a game in his three
varsity years.
CARDS DOMINATED
FIRST FOUR YEARS
In 1926 the Intercollegiate Con
ference was started. It's the same
one the Indians compete in today.
The league includes Stanford, Cali
fornia, U.S.F., San Jose State, and
San Mateo J. C.
The first three years Stanford
ran rough-shod over conference
opponents, winning the crown all
three seasons. The fourth year the
Indian hooters tied with U.S.F. for
the title.
Last year Maloney's men slip
ped to the third spot in the con
ference but managed to place no
less than four men on the all
conference team.
There has been only one inter
ruption in Stanford's colorful soc- i
cer history, and that was during the '
World War when the Farm's be
loved Harry Maloney was doing
something far more important than
coaching soccer teams.
This year's team did lose to U.S.F.
Saturday b£ a 2-0 score, but the
Farm booters have not yet reached
their peak and should be an even
money bet to take the Dons into'
camp in their next meeting.
The California Bears, defending
champs, were held to a 1-1 tie last
week by San Jose State, so it. looks
as if it's going to be a wide open
race for the title this season.
WATER POLO TEAMS
CROSS UP PREDICTIONS
To get back to the predictions I
made Friday. They were all correct
with the exception of frosh and var
sity water polo. Wins were predict
ed for both Card aqua teams. U.S.C.
nosed out the varsity in a rough
game, 2-1, and the frosh lost to
Paly Hi, 5-2.
Stanford's frosh grid squad
came plenty close to upsetting the
strong Bruin C'ubs. My prediction
was right, but I wish it hadn't
been in this instance.

one the Indians compete in today.
The league includes Stanford, Cali
fornia, U.S.F., San Jose State, and
San Mateo J. C.
The first three years Stanford
ran rough-shod over conference
opponents, winning the crown all
three seasons. The fourth year the
Indian hooters tied with U.S.F. for
the title.
Last year Maloney's men slip
ped to the third spot in the con
ference but managed to place no
less than four men on the all
conference team.
There has been only one inter
ruption in Stanford's colorful soc- i
cer history, and that was during the '
World War when the Farm's be
loved Harry Maloney was doing
something far more important than
coaching soccer teams.
This year's team did lose to U.S.F.
Saturday b£ a 2-0 score, but the
Farm booters have not yet reached
their peak and should be an even
money bet to take the Dons into'
camp in their next meeting.
The California Bears, defending
champs, were held to a 1-1 tie last
week by San Jose State, so it. looks
as if it's going to be a wide open
race for the title this season.
WATER POLO TEAMS
CROSS UP PREDICTIONS
To get back to the predictions I
made Friday. They were all correct
with the exception of frosh and var
sity water polo. Wins were predict
ed for both Card aqua teams. U.S.C.
nosed out the varsity in a rough
game, 2-1, and the frosh lost to
Paly Hi, 5-2.
Stanford's frosh grid squad
came plenty close to upsetting the
strong Bruin C'ubs. My prediction
was right, but I wish it hadn't
been in this instance.

AT LAST—THE
AVALANCHE
I've been holding my breath —
waiting for something like this to
happen all quarter. At last the ava
lanche came down on my head. It
all happened in Friday's Slants
when I said something pretty derog
atory about Harry Maloney's soccer
squads.
In the process of predicting the
week-end victors in the various
sports of interest to Farm fans, I
made the rash statement, "Stan
ford never had strong soccer
teams . . . and the Dons should
win this game by a pretty big
score."
Harry was quick to make me
realize how wrong it was to jump
at conclusions and pound out state
ments without facts to back them
up. With bowed head I hereby wish
to make retribution.

A look at Stanford's impressive
soccer record makes me wince a
little. When I wrote what I did I
was thinking only of the last few
years when Stanford hasn't won a
championship crown in the shin
kicking game. But let's ramble back
over the years and peek into the
glorious, past of Cardinal soccer
teams.
From 1910 to 1920 the Indians
won six championships—no less.
These same cardinal and white
teams hung up a record by wal
loping Cal seven years in a row.
..In 1920 Stanford started one of
the greatest win streaks in na
tional soccer history. For five
years Maloney-coached elevens
trampled coast teams to score 42
straight victories. And who was
playing goalie? None other than
our own A1 Masters, one of the
coast's greatest goal guards. A1
never lost a game in his three
varsity years.
