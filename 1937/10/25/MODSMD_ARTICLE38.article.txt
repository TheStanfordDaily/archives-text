# Stanford Frosh Bow to U.C.L.A.
## Cubs Prove Stronger In Close Battle Papooses Show Spirit As Conversion Turns Victory into Defeat 
### 
Stanford's frosh football team lost
its second consecutive conference
football game, 14-13, to U.C.L.A. Sat
urday in a game that was as close
and full of thrills as the score in
dicates.
But the Papooses showed the
handful of rooters sitting in the very
empty Stadium that they have the
qualities that a crowd likes to see
in a football team: plenty of spirit
and the ability to transform this
spirit into touchdowns.
The Cubs' gigantic line was just
able to open up too many holes for
hard-hitting Warren Haslan and
fast Rex Frazier to plunge through
and to wear Stanford's first and
second-string lines completely out.
That was the whole story.
Uclans Score First
The Westwood lads scored first,
early in the second quarter with
Haslan and Mallet driving from the
midfield marker off tackle and
around ends, Mallet sooring and Mc-
Donald converting.
But before that quarter was over
Stanford had chalked up two touch
downs and a conversion of her own
on the score board. Both came as a
result of Standlee throwing long
ones to Peterson. After passing the
ball 30 yards to the five-yard mark
er, Standlee ran the ball over the
goal line standing up for the first
score, and then kicked the conver
sion from Thompson's fingers.
Peterson caught Standlee's pass in
a corner of the end zone without a
man near him for their second and
last touchdown.
Break Aids Cubs
U.C.L.A.'s second score came as a
result of a break. Early in the
third quarter Fennebach kicked a
long one from his 30, which went
over the frosh safety's head and
rolled to the Stanford two-yard
marker.
Peterson's kick from the end zone
was returned to the Card 20 and,
with victory in their grasp, an in
spired Westwood ball club opened
up successive holes for Frazier, who
scored standing up from his 15 on a
faked lateral play. Overland's con
version w<jn the game.
