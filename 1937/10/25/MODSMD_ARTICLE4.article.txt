the sole occupant. Both vehicles
were badly damaged.
After investigating the crash, Of
ficer Gordon Davis said that both
Armstrong and Schurman avoided
more serious injury by bracing
themselves prior to the collision.
The motor hood of the car in which
Schurman was riding was ripped
from the frame and thrown through
the windshield, barely missing him.
A trip to the post office yesterday

which was treated at the hospital,
where she remained last night for

have been brought against Hol
