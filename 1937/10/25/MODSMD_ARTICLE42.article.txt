## Card Water Dogs Lose To Strong Trojans, 2-1 
### 
Despite the fact that Stanford's water polo team played better than
they had all season. Southern California defeated them 2 to 1 Friday
in Encina Pools.
Stanford led at the half by virtue of a set-up shot by Bill Bleeker but
Frary, center back, and Case, forward, set the Trojans up for their first

conference victory in four long 4
years with second period goals.
The new Indian line-up with Lamb
and Hanna at guard showed a tight
defense but the scoring power of
the coast's best scoring threats was
cut to almost nothing. The absence
of Dick Hoover in the Card line-up
created a gap that proved hard to
fill.
Two bright spots in Stanford's
play were the performance of Soph
omore Bob Plate at forward and
Johnny Lamb, with Burns at goal
making some nice stops of goalward
shots.
The game was the roughest seen at
Stanford in some time, both teams
were playing with five men at one
time.
Paly High turned the tables on
the frosh, trouncing them 5 to 2,
for their second loss in three days.
They forfeited to Sequioa High
School of Redwood City Wednesday
because of willful fouling.
The Cardinal varsity starting line
up was: Harv Rothschild and Bill
Bleeker at forwards; Jack Vibert at
sprint; Captain Bill Hanna and
Johnny Lamb at guard; Bob Plate
at center back; and Bill Burns,
goalie.
Santa Clara's fullback Bill Gun*-
ther saved a hard-fought game from
being a scoreless tie when in the
fourth quarter he intercepted a
Loyola pass into the left flat and
scored after a 54-yard run.
