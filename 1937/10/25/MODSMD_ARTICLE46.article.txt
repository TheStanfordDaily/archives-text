## "Sorry, But the Hospital's Full" 
### 
NO crystal ball is needed to discover an un
mistakably grave situation soon to face
Stanford University.
This morning's front page records that Palo
Alto Hospital is 13 per cent nearer capacity this
year than last, according to a University an
nouncement.
While, almost simultaneously, comes word
from University Health Officer, Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, that Stanford students may soon expect
the usual winter flu epidemic which last year
flooded the hospital and spilled over into rest
homes and a temporary hospital.
Without appearing to cross bridges to make
trouble, it can readily be seen that the hospital
ization problem is soon to become extremely
acute.
The Palo Alto Hospital is owned by the city
of Palo Alto and operated by the University.
Both students and citizens are treated at the
same institution, and in the past it has been a
case of "first come first served."
Long before the respiratory infections had

reached their peak last year, the hospital was
overflowing. A number of what Dr. Storey
called "hospital cases" were taken to the rest
homes and to a makeshift hospital, colloquially
the "pest house."
This ye.ar 13 per cent more "hospital cases"
will be quartered at rest homes and pest house,
where equipment and physical plant is inade
quate for serious illnesses, though facilities at
the temporary hospital have been improved
somewhat in anticipation of the impending hos
pitalization crisis.
That makes at least 13 per cent more cases
without proper care than there were last year,
when Dr. Storey considered the condition se
rious. At least 13 per cent because increased
registration could shove the epidemic over last
year's peak.
This isn't a gripe on the theoretical aspects of
student self-government, or what have you. It
concerns sickness and health, perhaps life and
death.
It cannot be dismissed lightly.
