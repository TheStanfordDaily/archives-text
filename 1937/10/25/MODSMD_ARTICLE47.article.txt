CONSCIENTIOUS Club Men in the Campus
Opinion columns today take the oppor
tunity of a Daily edit to discuss the eating clubs
to the doubtful advantage of the eating clubs.
Evidently feeling that the cynics on The
Daily must have been criticizing the eaters,
Club Men base their defense on these points.
Clubs are: 1. Unique. 2. Important. 3. Not
rushing formally. 4. Satisfactory in their ac
commodations. 5. Dietetically equal with fra
ternities. 6. More appealing to older men. 7.
Not so fraternal as fraternities. 8. Informal. 9.
Solid.
Editorially The Daily said the clubs are: 1.
Unique. 2. Important. 3. Not rushing formally
(yet). 4. Satisfactory in their accommodations.
5. Dietetically better than the fraternities. 6. Not
so fraternal as fraternities. 7. Informal. 8. Solid.
Let Conscientious Club Men learn not to kick
a gift horse in the teeth. â€”L. L.
