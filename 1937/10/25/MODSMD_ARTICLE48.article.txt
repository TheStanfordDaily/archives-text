# The Gods Smile
## 
### 
EVERY so often Stanford loses a football game
it should have won. Amid general lowering
of hair, studying of statistics, damning dame
luck, and claiming of moral victory, there is no
joy in mudville, Paly, Stanford and way points.

In other words, we moan.
Last Saturday, the sports writers report, Stan
ford had won a ball game it easily could have
lost. So rejoice now, my friends, and remember
this day when the gods frown. Then moan but
softly.
