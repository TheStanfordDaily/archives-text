COURTESY JUMPS THE TRACK
YV/HEN President Roosevelt opened fire on Supreme
Court justices over 70 years of age, Stanford gave
a very fine demonstration of disgust and antagonism.
The majority of students and faculty said, with an un
usual number of blistering epithets, that the whole
scheme was a blind, that judges over 70 were just as
capable as anybody else in the judiciary.
It is ironically interesting to note that in spite of
our enthusiasm for the nine old gentlemen ("the only
sensible men Ln Washington, by God") practically all
of us ignored the fact that Stanford demands the re
tirement of all faculty members at the age of 65, no
exceptions permitted. To date only one letter to the
editor has treated that subject. And although this was
well written and logically organized, it was far too
long for The Daily, and is now buried in a sub-stratum
on the editor's desk.

Apparently few students besides the writer of this
letter have neglected the bright lights of the city long
enough to bother about the problem. But we can
be certain that professors bother about it consid
erably.
According to the present set-up every professor
automatically retires at 65. Evidently it is assumed
that at such an advanced age a man's mental powers
are tobogganing down like stocks in a panic. No ex
ception is made for men whose books and lectures
demonstrate that they can still split a neater infini
tive than any newly minted Ph.D.

But any casual observation of society will show
that this short-sighted generalization is a fallacy. The
majority of our greatest financiers and industrialists
are at least 65, and most of them are still considered
somewhat above the moron level.
Every year the retirement system gives Stanford
a series of nasty wallops under the belt. Each spring
we lose two or three of our best men, simply because
of the figures on their birth certificates. Last year
Professor Hulme, world recognized authority on his
tory, was forced to stop teaching. Some time before
that, Dr. Bailey Willis, head of the geology depart
ment, was retired, and promptly gave the lie to the
system by organizing an expedition into Borneo.

4 ND when we have lost our men, we cannot replace
them. Professors are reluctant to come here when
they know they will have to quit so early. It is an
exceptional man who rcaches the top of his field be
fore he is 50. How many professors at the peak of
their powers would contract to slide into exile in
15 years?
The one argument that can be advanced for the
system is that it eliminates professors who really arc
slipping. But there is no reason why we have to wait
until a given age to do this. If we are to have an
efficient organization, we must junk dead weight when
ever we discover it.

Our retirement system would be admirably adapt
ed to a factory, or to a section gang. For a university
it is tragic. A professor can be unsurpassed, even if
he can't swing a pick all day.
Instead of having a brutally rigid system that
shelves every professor regardless of his talents, we
could have a provision for individual consideration of
;ill cases. It would probably hurt somebody's feelings,
but a diplomatic president could smooth that over.
As it is, we are sacrificing some of our best men to
avoid offending a few second-raters. That is carrying
courtesy entirely too far,
