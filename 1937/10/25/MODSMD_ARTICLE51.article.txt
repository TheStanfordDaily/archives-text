In a column called Once Over Lightly, Jack
Kelly of the University of Minnesota recently took
a crack at women's rushing. Daily editors have
been taking cracks at women's, rushing for years,
but none from Mr. Kelly's viewpoint. His angle is:
jyfAMA would have died if her child had decided to
enter a burlesque show. Mama would have been
horrified at the thought of having all those men staring
at her daughter—that way!
But Mama was quite enthused when she pledged a
sorority. Perhaps, Mama didn't know about that par
ticular institution known,—because the Greeks had
no better words for it—as Open House.
For a week the little freshman was catapulted
into a chaotic whirl of lunches, teas, flattery, hypocrisy
and carefully-calculated friendship. She ate dinners
and sang songs and learned about "prestige" and
"social position."
She learned you could tell a Tri Delt by her activ
ities, an Alpha Gam by her manner and a Theta by
her lack of them, an Alpha Phi by her walk and a
Chi O by her conversation. And she learned that
sororities were rated by the kinds of cars that parked
in front of them nights.
She heard the advantages accruing to her entrance
to Greek-dom expounded in a well-rehearsed talk.
And the "sacred bonds of friendship" were pushed at
her like cigarets.
At first it was all so gay and light-hearted! But
toward the end of the week the pressure went on and
she learned about "hotboxes" and the harsher reali
ties. All of a sudden, it. seemed, the sisters ceased
making pretty comments about her clothes—which
were really not quite so pretty as the comments.
Prefacing their remarks with cordial, "See here,
darling, you know we girls all like you and we think
you like us, so—" they began to talk about dues and
things. With three or more actives centering on the
little rushee, the sessions went on indefinitely.
At length, she accepted the "sacred bonds" at
whichever house she happened to be in when her re
sistance gave out.
So the actives all stopped admiring her clothes
(which they thought were pretty darn awful, anyway)
and invited all the fraternity boys to come over and
see what they caught.
And maybe the college boys didn't stare at her—
that way!
