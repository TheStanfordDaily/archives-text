# CAMPUS OPINION
## HALL vs. ROW 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The editorial in Tuesday morn
ing's Daily took the opportunity to
discuss the eating clubs to the bene
fit of the Row. We feel that this
article failed to do us justice and at
this time would like to present our
side of the picture. The purpose of
the dinner for the frosh was to fa
miliarize them with the halls other
than Encina, which cannot be taken
as an example of hall life. The
better halls provide rooms that
would interest frosh who are look
ing for "comfort and convenience"
for the next three years. The clubs
took the liberty to give the frosh an
opportunity to see these rooms.
Clubs are unique at Stanford.
They play a very important part
in campus life and activities, and
the frosh should be acquainted
with them. By the dinner, the
clubs sought to show the freshmen
what they have to offer. The clubs
arc not resorting to formal rush
ing. Most freshmen in the past
never had a chance to see our
set-up. We are not trying to coin
pete with the Row, but merely
acquainting the frosh with the
clubs.
Now we will take up the defense
of the clubs with respect to several
remarks made in the editorial. Com
fort and convenience are matters of
personal opinion; however, we
should like verification of the state
ment that "most clubs will concede
little edge to the row." Our club
rooms and accommodations are sat
isfactory, and the rooms in the halls
are the best the campus has to offer.
The question of food is a toss-up.
Many members of .the clubs arc
upperclassnien and transfers. As
for specialization in them, there
are as many, if not more, in the
clubs who enter as frosh or at the
beginning of their soph year.
Clubs do appeal to the older men
because they are interested in the
informality we have to offer them.
They have realized that a Greek
letter is not all that matters at
Stanford. Club men as a rule do
not desire the close bonds of living
together that the row offers; how
ever, our bonds of friendship and
interest in our organization is as
strong as among fraternity men.
Houses on the row may like to
think that the clubs get the leavings
after they get through picking over
the frosh; however, there is such a
thing as false impression. Don't
think that the club men never got
any bids or that they could not get
into a so-called "good house." Four
years ago a club man received 22
pledge pins and, much to the sur
prise of the houses, he was a mem
ber of a club all along.
Few frosh club men don't re
ceive several bids, and many of
them keep on receiving invitations
after they have joined a club. Club
material does not consist of any
one that comes along who wants
to join. Just because a man lives
in a hall does not automatically
make him a member of a club.
There are many men on the row
who were black-balled by the
clubs.
Membership in the clubs is not as
vital as it is on the row, and we are
not financially dependent upon new
members. Men are accepted by us
for their congeniality, personality,
and desire for informality. We want
men who like the idea behind the
clubs and want that which we have
to offer. Informality and solidarity
are our main features.

never had a chance to see our
set-up. We are not trying to coin
pete with the Row, but merely
acquainting the frosh with the
clubs.
Now we will take up the defense
of the clubs with respect to several
remarks made in the editorial. Com
fort and convenience are matters of
personal opinion; however, we
should like verification of the state
ment that "most clubs will concede
little edge to the row." Our club
rooms and accommodations are sat
isfactory, and the rooms in the halls
are the best the campus has to offer.
The question of food is a toss-up.
Many members of .the clubs arc
upperclassnien and transfers. As
for specialization in them, there
are as many, if not more, in the
clubs who enter as frosh or at the
beginning of their soph year.
Clubs do appeal to the older men
because they are interested in the
informality we have to offer them.
They have realized that a Greek
letter is not all that matters at
Stanford. Club men as a rule do
not desire the close bonds of living
together that the row offers; how
ever, our bonds of friendship and
interest in our organization is as
strong as among fraternity men.
Houses on the row may like to
think that the clubs get the leavings
after they get through picking over
the frosh; however, there is such a
thing as false impression. Don't
think that the club men never got
any bids or that they could not get
into a so-called "good house." Four
years ago a club man received 22
pledge pins and, much to the sur
prise of the houses, he was a mem
ber of a club all along.
Few frosh club men don't re
ceive several bids, and many of
them keep on receiving invitations
after they have joined a club. Club
material does not consist of any
one that comes along who wants
to join. Just because a man lives
in a hall does not automatically
make him a member of a club.
There are many men on the row
who were black-balled by the
clubs.
Membership in the clubs is not as
vital as it is on the row, and we are
not financially dependent upon new
members. Men are accepted by us
for their congeniality, personality,
and desire for informality. We want
men who like the idea behind the
clubs and want that which we have
to offer. Informality and solidarity
are our main features.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial in Tuesday morn
ing's Daily took the opportunity to
discuss the eating clubs to the bene
fit of the Row. We feel that this
article failed to do us justice and at
this time would like to present our
side of the picture. The purpose of
the dinner for the frosh was to fa
miliarize them with the halls other
than Encina, which cannot be taken
as an example of hall life. The
better halls provide rooms that
would interest frosh who are look
ing for "comfort and convenience"
for the next three years. The clubs
took the liberty to give the frosh an
opportunity to see these rooms.
Clubs are unique at Stanford.
They play a very important part
in campus life and activities, and
the frosh should be acquainted
with them. By the dinner, the
clubs sought to show the freshmen
what they have to offer. The clubs
arc not resorting to formal rush
ing. Most freshmen in the past
never had a chance to see our
set-up. We are not trying to coin
