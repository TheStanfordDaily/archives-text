# JORGI AGAIN

The Editor, Sir:
Viewing with no particular alarm
Mr. Cobbs' 18-em slugs of last Fri
day I am able to deduct these de
ductions:
1. The university is a university
is a university.
2. A Stanford doctor is sticking
liis neck out.
3. The United States Govern
ment is sticking its neck out.
4. Constitutional democracies arc
out with their neck stuck.
5. Life is just one long series of
sticking it out and getting it slam
med hack, and of drinking cokes

with beautiful women.
I must frankly confess that I am
overawed by the major and minor,
sharp and flat, premises of the Bull
Sessioner's ratiocination. The impli
cations of his philosophy are limit
less: We should not have anything to
do with foreign affairs because we
have too much trouble at home.
Next time any issues arise at
home, we may expect to hear the
tantalizing philosophy that we
should not have anything to do with
them because we have too much
trouble abroad.
This appealing call to inaction
takes me back nostalgically to those
pleasant days of 192G-27 when I used
to read the editorial page of the
Chronicle.
Mr. Cobbs irrefutably refutes my
thesis that the sending af a doctor to
a base hospital in Spain will not
involve the United States in a war.
He cleverly proves his point on three
main grounds:
1. My campus opinion letters are
too long.
2. My private life would lead
him to believe that I think that
maybe I am the champion of the
oppressed masses, the widows and
orphans, U. S. Steel, and all those
of poor but honest parentage.
3. The sending of a doctor to
Spain will involve the United
States in a world conflagration.
To this I can make but one an
swer:
Chester Rowell's in his heaven
and all is right with the world.
