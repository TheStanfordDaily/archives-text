# Shirley Wins 'Four Bells' From Critic
## 
### 
"HEIDI" (Fox Stanford)
A long time ago—long before it
became the first part of the refrain
of "Minnie the Moocher"—Heidi was
a little mountain girl. Her wicked
aunt took her into the mountains
to live with her grandfather, who
was an old hermit. Heidi softened
this old man's heart, and made him
go to church on Sunday with the
good people of the village.
But then her wicked aunt came
again and took Heidi away from her

grandfather, and
brought her to the
big city. There
Heidi went to live
with some rich
people and their
little lame daugh
ter. Heidi cured
the little lame girl
and made her
walk again. But
in this house there

lived the little lame girl's wicked
governess, who did not want the
little girl to walk again because then
she would lose her job.
The wicked governess tried to sell
Heidi to the cruel gypsies. But
Heidi's grandfather came down from
the mountains and saved her, and
evex-ybody lived happily ever after.
To deal with this picture and
Shirley Temple in terms of any
fancy critical adjectives would be
a case of ramming a tadpole with a
battleship. Suffice it to say that by
the four-bell system, "Heidi," for
general charm and grace, gets all
four of them.

dogs that cannot bark are now be
