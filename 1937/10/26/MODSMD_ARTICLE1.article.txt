# Ballot Board Will Conduct Library Poll
## Election Committee to Be In Charge of Special Poll Thursday, Friday 
### BILL MILLIS 
A.S.S.U. Election Committee mem
bers directed by Chairman Dick
Riddell will be in charge of the
special vote to be held this Thurs
day and Friday on proposals for
opening the Library regularly on
Sunday nights, John Dern, member
of the special student body commit
tee investigating the library hours
situation, said yesterday afternoon.
Original plans for the library poll,
as drafted last week after a con
ference of Dern, Jan North, and
Tom Killefer with Library Director
Nathan Van Patten, were that mem
bers of the library staff would be
in charge of balloting in the special
election.
Ask Two Questions
The ballots, Dern stated, will ask
two questions: "Do you need the
library open on Sunday nights?"
and "What department of the library
would you use at that time?"â€”and
will also provide space for any re
marks or comments by students on
the situation.
Voting will take place in the li
brary, and polls will be open
throughout Thursday and Friday
after 9 o'clock in the morning, Dern
said.
Plan Analysis
After the votes have been tabu
lated, Dern said that his A.S.S.U.
committee will confer with Van
Patten and other library officials in
order to analyze the student verdict
on proposals to open the library on
Sunday nights.
Particular efforts will be made to
find out the actual pei'centage of
students who would use the various
departments of the library on Sun
day nights, he declared.
'New Possibility'
Estimating that total cost for the
year for keeping the library open
Sunday nights would be in the
neighborhood of $2000, Dern said
that "a new possibility" would be to
open only the department of the
library which would have the most
use, such as the reserve book room.
This would depend entirely on the
results of the coming special elec
tion.
If the results of the poll Thurs
day and Friday prove favorable to
opening the library on Sunday
nights, Dern said that the matter
would then be turned over to Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur, who,
along with the University Board of
Trustees, will have to reach a final
decision on the question.
