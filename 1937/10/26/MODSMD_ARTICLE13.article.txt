# Oxford Indignant At Sex Charges
## 
### 
LONDON. Oct. 25 (U.R).—Students
of Oxford University, both men and
co-eds, rose up in a chorus of wrath
tonight against the published charges
of one of their fellow students that
the place is a hot-bed of "drunken
orgies and sex indulgences."
Keith Briant, editor last year of
the undergraduate newspaper "Isis,"
made the allegations in his new book
"Oxford Limited," the reviews of
which shocked parents today.
Briant asserted, among other
things, that one girl student out of
five "experiments with sex" during
her four years at one of the four
women's colleges of Oxford. The
ratio for men students, he said, is
considerably higher—about one out
of three.
Most of the students were irate in
their replies to Briant, others
"laughed off" his charges.
"He's just a squealer and an op
portunist," said one.
The girls seemed more angry than
the men.
"It's nonsense to suggest that our
lives are just one long alcoholic
orgy," a co-ed said. "We got here by
hard work and can stay only by
continuing to work."
