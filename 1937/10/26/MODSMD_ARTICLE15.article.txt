# Wilbur Rejects Plan For News Broadcast
## 
### 
Possibility that Stanford students might prepare and broadcast a daily
radio news program, commercially sponsored, was blasted yesterday when
President Ray Lyman Wilbur banned the plan as likely to involve the
name of the University in advertising.
Gordy Frost, editor, and Langan Swent, business manager of The Daily,
who presented the proposal, were informed by President Wilbur it is

the policy of the Univer
sity to enter into anything of this
nature which might involve the use
! of the University's name for adver
! tising purposes."
A national advertising agency,
acting for the American Tobacco
Company, broached the idea to
Frost and Swent.
Five-minute Broadcast
It would have provided that mem
bers of The Daily staff compile and
edit campus news for a five-minute
broadcast five days a week. The
program was to be presented by a
student commentator, chosen in an
elimination contest. Tryouts of am
| bitious commentators were to be
held and a group of 15 was to be
I selected. Each of this 15 was to
| conduct one broadcast, of which a
j phonograph record would be made.
| The record then was to be sent
i east to headquarters of the company,
i where Boake Carter, Edwin C. Hill
and other commentators would se
lect the best two, to be designated
as official commentators.
Wire to Campus
The tobacco company planned to
run a leased wire to the campus
from either a San Francisco or a San
Jose radio station — probably the
latter—so the broadcasts could be
made directly from the campus.
Chief advantage of the program to
the University, according to repre
sentatives of the advertising agency,
was that students would be given
actual experience in radio program
preparation and presentation, and
the campus would be given local
news by air.
Idea Defeated
President Wilbur's refusal to ap
prove the broadcast because its
! commercial announcements would
be against University policy, marks
' defeat of the idea locally.
j Three other Pacific Coast colleges,
j Washington State, Oregon, and Cali
j fornia are to be approached by the
! agency as prospective participants
in the broadcast. Similar broadcasts
have been conducted at Yale for the
past year and one has recently been
I instituted at Cornell.
