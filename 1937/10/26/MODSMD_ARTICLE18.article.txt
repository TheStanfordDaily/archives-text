# Farm Health Facilities Inadequate

### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Stanford's health situation is more
serious this year than in past years.
It may be even more serious next
year.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, medical ad
viser of men, drew these conclu
sions to bear out a stand taken by
The Daily in an editorial yesterday,
and predicted eventual solution of
the problem.
Increase in Sickncss
Nearness of the usual peak of res
piratory infections among students
and increased average use of the
Palo Alto hospital were factors from
which Dr. Storey made his predic
tion.
No immediate solution is possible.
An annex to the hospital may be
built within two years, but a sepa
rate hospital unit for students is the
only real and lasting answer to the
problem, Dr. Storey believes.
New Measures Taken
Measures have already been taken
to care for this year's respiratory
cases, which annually reach a peak
in November and again in January
and February, but Dr. Storey em
phasized that they were alleviative
only. They include preparation of
the isolation home and tentative ar
rangements to obtain further accom
modations should they be needed.

Dr. Storey declared yesterday he
would insist that the isolation home
be opened when the first overflow
case from the hospital appears. Ap
paratus and service at the rest
homes are insuffiicent to care ade
quately for serious illnesses.
Sitaution Serious
"My primary concern is that no
sick student shall be without proper
care," he said.
Most serious is the situation on
the women's side of the campus. No
extra accommodations were avail
able for women last year and the
rest home was filled with cold cases.
Women with colds who lived near
the campus were advised to go home.
High Average Occupancy
Figures showing higher percent
age of average occupancy at the
hospital which precipitated yester
day's editorial, Dr. Storey declared,
weren ot so significant as the actual
number of beds available to stu
dents.
Illustrative of his point was a re
port that from the hospital showing
that on Friday of last week,- 76 of
a total of 80 beds were occupied,
and (hat the unoccupied beds were
in the children's section.
Three in Rest Home
On the previous day there were
three students in the men's rest
| home with colds, and 18 called at

the health service office for treat
ment of colds.
Because the city of Palo Alto built
a hospital for general use, Dr. Storey
believes that it will never be en
tirely satisfactory for the Univer
sity. Maternity and other sections
may be vacant and useless when
student need is the greatest.
Infirmary Annex
Next best thing to a separate hos
pital for students, he says, would be
an infirmary annex to the hospital
from which borderline cases could
be immediately transferred to hospi
tal rooms. With this arrangement all
the apparatus of the hospital would
be immediately available.
But Dr. Storey estimates that it
would be at least two years before
such an addition could be built.
Paly Gets Report
Last May a committee was ap
pointed by the Palo Alto city coun
cil to draw up a technical report on
the hospital, its use and possible
deficiencies.
The committee is expected to re
port in two weeks but even if its
findings indicate that a hospital
addition is necessary, council action,
letting of contracts, and construc
tion would take approximately two
year, and there are expected to be
four seasonal peaks of respiratory
infections before that time.
Stanford's health situation is more
serious this year than in past years.
It may be even more serious next
year.

built within two years, but a sepa
rate hospital unit for students is the
only real and lasting answer to the
problem, Dr. Storey believes.
New Measures Taken
Measures have already been taken
to care for this year's respiratory
cases, which annually reach a peak
in November and again in January
and February, but Dr. Storey em
phasized that they were alleviative
only. They include preparation of
the isolation home and tentative ar
rangements to obtain further accom
modations should they be needed.

Dr. Storey declared yesterday he
would insist that the isolation home
be opened when the first overflow
case from the hospital appears. Ap
paratus and service at the rest
homes are insuffiicent to care ade
quately for serious illnesses.
Sitaution Serious
"My primary concern is that no
sick student shall be without proper
care," he said.
Most serious is the situation on
the women's side of the campus. No
extra accommodations were avail
able for women last year and the
rest home was filled with cold cases.
Women with colds who lived near
the campus were advised to go home.
High Average Occupancy
Figures showing higher percent
age of average occupancy at the
hospital which precipitated yester
day's editorial, Dr. Storey declared,
weren ot so significant as the actual
number of beds available to stu
dents.
Illustrative of his point was a re
port that from the hospital showing
that on Friday of last week,- 76 of
a total of 80 beds were occupied,
and (hat the unoccupied beds were
in the children's section.
Three in Rest Home
On the previous day there were
three students in the men's rest
| home with colds, and 18 called at

the health service office for treat
ment of colds.
Because the city of Palo Alto built
a hospital for general use, Dr. Storey
believes that it will never be en
tirely satisfactory for the Univer
sity. Maternity and other sections
may be vacant and useless when
student need is the greatest.
Infirmary Annex
Next best thing to a separate hos
pital for students, he says, would be
an infirmary annex to the hospital
from which borderline cases could
be immediately transferred to hospi
tal rooms. With this arrangement all
the apparatus of the hospital would
be immediately available.
But Dr. Storey estimates that it
would be at least two years before
such an addition could be built.
Paly Gets Report
Last May a committee was ap
pointed by the Palo Alto city coun
cil to draw up a technical report on
the hospital, its use and possible
deficiencies.
The committee is expected to re
port in two weeks but even if its
findings indicate that a hospital
addition is necessary, council action,
letting of contracts, and construc
tion would take approximately two
year, and there are expected to be
four seasonal peaks of respiratory
infections before that time.
Stanford's health situation is more
serious this year than in past years.
It may be even more serious next
year.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, medical ad
viser of men, drew these conclu
sions to bear out a stand taken by
The Daily in an editorial yesterday,
and predicted eventual solution of
the problem.
Increase in Sickncss
Nearness of the usual peak of res
piratory infections among students
and increased average use of the
Palo Alto hospital were factors from
which Dr. Storey made his predic
tion.
No immediate solution is possible.

built within two years, but a sepa
