## Soph Semi-format Dance Set for November 12 
### 
Sophomore Cotillion, Friday eve
ning, November 12, in the Pavilion,
will feature the only big name or
chestra of the quarter plus especially
low priced bids, according to Don
Berger, president of the Class of '40.
The sophomore class has been
granted the sponsorship of the one
"name" band that is allowed each
quarter by an Ex Committee ruling.
Final arrangements are now being
made through Student Manager
Chuck Fontius to engage one of the
country's leading swing outfits.*
The Cotillion will be semi-formal
this year, and the dance committee
is working on an unusual theme for
the affair. Committee members in
clude Sally Holt and Dick Daley,
co-chairmen; Ken Cuthbertson,
ticket sales; Larry Livingston, pub
licity; and Audis Davis, Frank Bur
beck, and Jack Rice.
"The Class of '40 promises the
Farm the best dance of the quarter,"
said President Berger last night
looking at the name of the orchestra
that will be announced as soon as
final business negotiations are com
pleted.
