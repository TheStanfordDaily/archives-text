# Limburger Foo Goos Roadster
## 
### 
"Foo, what a smell!" said the
frosh as he leaped into his road
ster to go get his date for a
night at the Mark. The pungent
smell of something long dead
assailed his widening nostrils.
A closer examination of his
Ford showed that the essence
of Limburger had been spread
on the steering wheel, door
handle, gear shift, ball, and va
rious other spots.
The indignant Encina lad at
tempted to wipe off the smell
wtih a rag. A fellow classmate
saw the cheese plight and tax
ied the couple to Frisco.
All attempts to erase the
putrid odor have failed and
the car has been dubbed the
"Limburger Limited."
