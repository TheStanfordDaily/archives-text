# Variety to Be Keynote For Two Dramas
## Double Bill Will Offer Contrast; Tragedy To Vie with Comedy 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Contrast will be the keynote of
next Friday's and Saturday's pro
duction of "Murder in the Cathed
ral" and "Trial by Jury" in Memo
rial Hall.
The first half of the double bill is
a heavy tragedy by the noted poet,
T. S. Eliot. The entire play is sur
rounded by a tragic atmosphere; it
starts with a chorus of moaning
hags rising from the orchestra pit
and ends with a gruesome murder.
Difficult Parts
"Murder in the Cathedral" makes
greater demands on the members of
its cast than any play that has been
presented at Stanford in recent
years. J. P. Cahn, who plays the
role of Thomas a Beckett, comes
from every rehearsal in a state of
physical exhaustion, so difficult is
the part.
In direct contrast is the light sat
ire and comedy of Gilbert and Sul
livan's "Trial by Jury." This nine
teenth century musical farce has
been compared to the modern "Of
Thee I Sing," by George S. Kaufman,
Moss Hart, and George Gershwin,
which kidded national politics from
coast to coast a few years ago.
Satirical Production
The action, sets, and costumes in
this week's production are being
carried to extremes by H. Miles
j Heberer, its director. It satirizes
not only the English court system,
but also classical grand opera.
1 Six characters try to out-sing each
i other in the burlesque sextette that
brings "Trial by Jury" to its climax.
Choruses of brides-maids and danc
| ing girls and a girl-crazy judge add
to the hilarity of the show. War
ren D. Allen, professor of music,
and Gordon C. Lange, director of
; dramatics, are supervising directors
I of the production.
