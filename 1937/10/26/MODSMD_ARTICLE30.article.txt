# Australian Praises Stanford Lethargy
## 
### AL ZELVER 
"Stanford, though a very young institution, resembles the older uni
versities of the east coast and of England," said YV. L. L. Wilmot, oflicial
representative from the University of Melbourne, in praise of the spirit
he found on the Farm during hi:i recent visit here.
There are two types of universities, Wilmot further stated; one is
like the University of California, the other is like Stanford. At Cal,

where the Australian conducted a 4
two weeks' investigation before
coming here, all is hustle-bustle
with a very metropolitan atmos
phere.
Discuss Politics
It is almost impossible to talk with
anyone, he continued, without soon
becoming engaged in a vital polit
ical discussion.
In direct contrast, said Wilmot, is
the Stanford spirit of detached leth
argy. While the rest of the world
may be important we give the im
pression of not being too concerned.
Two Types Important
Both types of university Wilmot
considers important, but he per
sonally likes a place where the stu
dents can relax and do some serious
thinking in their leisure time rather
than engaging in life's trivial little
processes.
One of the things Wilmot particu
larly lauded about Stanford was its
lack of silly little convictions and
traditions which so burden many of
the old schools. He cited the wear
ing of academic gowns at dinner
merely because it was done during
the middle ages.
Toured Japan
Wilmot, who has just come over
from a tour of Japan, has a very
high regard for the universities
there. Like Stanford, he said, they
realize the importance of beer,
beauty, and bull session's place in
acquiring a well rounded education.
Music, classical and modern, oc
cupies a high place in the Japanese
student's life. Besides having ac
cess to extensive recorded libraries
of the classics the students attend
cafes which specialize in certain
types of music.
Some Use Records
Some places use nothing but Bing
Crosby records, others only Benny
Goodman's. One spot in particular
advertised, "If You Like It Sweet
and Hot."
Wilmot, who is commencing an in
vestigation of American universities
for the Australian state and the
University of Melbourne, concluded
by saying he didn't expect to find
another campus with as beautiful
and complete a plant as Stanford's.

Some Use Records
Some places use nothing but Bing
Crosby records, others only Benny
Goodman's. One spot in particular
advertised, "If You Like It Sweet
and Hot."
Wilmot, who is commencing an in
vestigation of American universities
for the Australian state and the
University of Melbourne, concluded
by saying he didn't expect to find
another campus with as beautiful
and complete a plant as Stanford's.
"Stanford, though a very young institution, resembles the older uni
versities of the east coast and of England," said YV. L. L. Wilmot, oflicial
representative from the University of Melbourne, in praise of the spirit
he found on the Farm during hi:i recent visit here.
There are two types of universities, Wilmot further stated; one is
like the University of California, the other is like Stanford. At Cal,

where the Australian conducted a 4
two weeks' investigation before
coming here, all is hustle-bustle
with a very metropolitan atmos
phere.
Discuss Politics
It is almost impossible to talk with
anyone, he continued, without soon
becoming engaged in a vital polit
ical discussion.
In direct contrast, said Wilmot, is
the Stanford spirit of detached leth
argy. While the rest of the world
may be important we give the im
pression of not being too concerned.
Two Types Important
Both types of university Wilmot
considers important, but he per
sonally likes a place where the stu
dents can relax and do some serious
thinking in their leisure time rather
than engaging in life's trivial little
processes.
One of the things Wilmot particu
larly lauded about Stanford was its
lack of silly little convictions and
traditions which so burden many of
the old schools. He cited the wear
ing of academic gowns at dinner
merely because it was done during
the middle ages.
Toured Japan
Wilmot, who has just come over
from a tour of Japan, has a very
high regard for the universities
there. Like Stanford, he said, they
realize the importance of beer,
beauty, and bull session's place in
acquiring a well rounded education.
Music, classical and modern, oc
cupies a high place in the Japanese
student's life. Besides having ac
cess to extensive recorded libraries
of the classics the students attend
cafes which specialize in certain
types of music.
