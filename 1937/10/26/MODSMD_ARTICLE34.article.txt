### 
MILWAUKEE, Oct. 23 (UP). —
There are thx-ee married men on the
Marquette University eleven — Herb
Anderson, left end; Howard Hansen,
right tackle, and Johnny Haltsch,
quarterback.

An Alabama coed actually spurned
an appointment to Annapolis and
then was featured by Ripley in his
weekly broadcast.
