# 'Moral Uplifted' Fails At Oklahoma University
## 
### 
Sex tried to raise its traditionally
"ugly head" last week at the Uni
versity of Oklahoma, Norman, Okla
homa—where the curfew rings at 9
o'clock each night—but the members
of the Baptist student center and of
Pi Zeta Kappa, women's religious
fraternity, refused to follow a Bap
tist minister's advice to inaugurate
a "moral uplift" campaign on the
Oklahoma campus.
Rev. Bob Lindsey, a Norman evan
gelical minister and a prime sup
porter of the student "morality
drive," charged that many students
left Norman on week-ends to do
their "evil."

Seeking "divine guidance," Rev.
Lindsey declared that "it has been
my experience that when people ex
perience 'a rebirth,' then their moral
conduct improves itself."
Rev. Lindsey doubted that a re
turn of prohibition would do any
good, and explained that "what is
needed is for those students who
are defying all Bible teaching to be
come reborn. The change must
come from above and not below."
Rev. Lindsey's hopes for a gi'eat
moral crusade came to a sudden
halt, a later issue of "The Oklahoma
Daily" reports, when—in their words
—"the evangelist failed to persuade
the Baptist student center that the
crusade was 'divinely sanctioned'."
Members of Pi Zeta Kappa also
discussed the projected campaign,
but failed to take any action.
Although the "moral drive" just
didn't "pan out," the Norman chief
of police "very soon" plans to en
force the town's 9 o'clock curfew
law.
