# Cabinet Pilfered By Lovelorn Male
## 
### 
A hand in the dark, a jimmied
lock, a stolen picture, and Dorothy
Brookman goes down in history as
probably the first Stanford woman
whose charms have driven man to
steal.
Sunday saw a picture of Miss
Brookman resting beside a portrait
of a handsome Stanford man in the
glass bulletin cabinet at the English
corner. Yesterday morning the mas
culine portrait was there alone â€”
mute witness to a crime that no man
can be blamed for committing.
Splinters of wood around the lock
were the only clues G-men could
find.
