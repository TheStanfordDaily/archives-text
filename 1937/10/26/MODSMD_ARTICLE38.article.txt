Frontier, Oct. 25 (U.R).â€”A French
destroyer squadron was reported to
have sailed from Toulon naval base

from the Mediterranean trade routes.
Two Boats Sunk
A French dispatch boat was set
on fire and destroyed by machine
gun "strafing" in one "piracy" inci
dent and a French freighter was
bombed and sunk.

communique that a warship also had
been sent to Minorca and that meas
ures would be taken to "meet such
acts."

"Following attacks, in which two
French boats have been the object,
the government has urgently taken
steps to assure identity of the ag
gressors and will determine the
measures to meet such acts. A war
ship already has been sent to the
scene of the attack. The French gov
ernment will take the steps neces
sary to assure protection of the Mar
seille-Algiers air line."
