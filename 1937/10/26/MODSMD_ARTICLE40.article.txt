# Mrs. Hopkins Gives Trees For Theater
## 
### 
Twenty-eight olive trees, present
ed by Mrs. Timothy Hopkinss, are
being planted around Memorial
Hall this week.
Fifty years ago the late Mr. Hop
kins had these trees, which he im
ported from southern Europe, Asia
and Africa, planted on his Menlo
estate and tagged for identification.
By mistake a gardener removed the
tags, and even botanical authorities
called in at the time were unable to
clear up the mystery of the differ
ent varieties.
Eight of the olive trees are al
ready in place in front of the new
theater and the rest will be in this
week. Plane ti'ees will be planted on
the side terraces of the building;
their tops will be kept cut off flat
so that the broad horizontal branch
es will form arbors.
An imitation sandstone bench is
being built around the base of the
oak opposite English Corner where
students wait for the bus or "rides
to Paly." Since it was necessary to
erect a brick wall to protect the
tree, it was decided to provide a
resting place for the commuting
legion.
