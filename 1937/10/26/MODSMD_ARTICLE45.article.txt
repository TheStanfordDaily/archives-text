LOOKED HOT SATTIDY
Well, the 800-erkeley Bears con
tinued their mad rampage by tramp
ing all over the Trojans Saturday.
We're becoming convinced by this
time that they've really got some
thing over there in Strawberry Can
yon.
The Hears piled up yardage and
first downs all over the place and
even Headman Howard Jones of
the Southerners had to admit that
Cal was indeed a wonder team.
Howard said afterwards that
usually after a game the coach feels
that if his team would meet the
same team next week they would
have a good chance to beat their
conquerors . . . but not in this case.
BEARS 1IAI) EVERYTHING
AGAINST TROJANS
The Blue and Gold team has ev
erything . . . their blocking was
superb. But still Stub Allison likes
to make the front pages of the city
sports sections each week by claim
ing that the Bears have not yet
nearly reached their peak. Whether
they reach their peak or not, let's
hope they have an off day on the
afternoon of November 20.
Don't get me wrong . . . I'm
not giving the liig Game to Cal on
a silver platter yet. A Big Game
is always what the name implies,
no matter what the respective
teams have left behind them dur
ing the season's grid warfare.
It isn't like me to pass out the
posies to our friends across the mud
flats, but I just have to this time.
The Bears can whip any aggrega
tion in the country this year if they
play like they did Saturday in
Berkeley.
CAE'S LUCKY
NUMBER IS 188
I personally believe that, despite
Allison's ravings, the Bears reached
their peak for the season against the
Trojans.
An interesting note was sounded
when the Cal team lined up against
the Trojans. The number 188 seems
to fit them to a T. The starting line
averaged 188 pounds per man. The
backfield averaged 188, and the en
tire starting eleven averaged 188.
Oh, yes, the line from tackle to
tackle averaged — you guessed it —
188.
Up north it would appear to the
layman that Stanford was really
outclassed all the way through
and was darn lucky to pull through
with a victory over the Washing
ton Bow-Wows.
I'll admit that the figures were
against the Cards. The Bow-Wows
piled up 224 yards to 32 and added
up 15 first downs to Stanford's 3.
Still the Big Red Machine won. The
sensational (no less) kicking, fine
end play, line charge, and swell de
fense at the right time gave Tiny's
boys a hard earned victory.
STANFORD GRIDDERS
REALLY BOOTED EM
Take a look at the punting aver
age hung up by Indian kickers Jim
Groves, Pete Fay, and Bill Paul
man—4l.6 yards from scrimmage.
That is real kicking in any man's
league.
To show how that line was
charging, one has only to recall
that blocked kick for the first
score, and the two feeble kicks
turned in by Husky punters later
on.
Those Stanford punts downed on
the Washington 3 and 6 yard lines
were nothing to sneeze at either. In
fact, both of the Indian scores came
indirectly from these two works of
art.

conquerors . . . but not in this case.
BEARS 1IAI) EVERYTHING
AGAINST TROJANS
The Blue and Gold team has ev
erything . . . their blocking was
superb. But still Stub Allison likes
to make the front pages of the city
sports sections each week by claim
ing that the Bears have not yet
nearly reached their peak. Whether
they reach their peak or not, let's
hope they have an off day on the
afternoon of November 20.
Don't get me wrong . . . I'm
not giving the liig Game to Cal on
a silver platter yet. A Big Game
is always what the name implies,
no matter what the respective
teams have left behind them dur
ing the season's grid warfare.
It isn't like me to pass out the
posies to our friends across the mud
flats, but I just have to this time.
The Bears can whip any aggrega
tion in the country this year if they
play like they did Saturday in
Berkeley.
CAE'S LUCKY
NUMBER IS 188
I personally believe that, despite
Allison's ravings, the Bears reached
their peak for the season against the
Trojans.
An interesting note was sounded
when the Cal team lined up against
the Trojans. The number 188 seems
to fit them to a T. The starting line
averaged 188 pounds per man. The
backfield averaged 188, and the en
tire starting eleven averaged 188.
Oh, yes, the line from tackle to
tackle averaged — you guessed it —
188.
Up north it would appear to the
layman that Stanford was really
outclassed all the way through
and was darn lucky to pull through
with a victory over the Washing
ton Bow-Wows.
I'll admit that the figures were
against the Cards. The Bow-Wows
piled up 224 yards to 32 and added
up 15 first downs to Stanford's 3.
Still the Big Red Machine won. The
sensational (no less) kicking, fine
end play, line charge, and swell de
fense at the right time gave Tiny's
boys a hard earned victory.
STANFORD GRIDDERS
REALLY BOOTED EM
Take a look at the punting aver
age hung up by Indian kickers Jim
Groves, Pete Fay, and Bill Paul
man—4l.6 yards from scrimmage.
That is real kicking in any man's
league.
To show how that line was
charging, one has only to recall
that blocked kick for the first
score, and the two feeble kicks
turned in by Husky punters later
on.
Those Stanford punts downed on
the Washington 3 and 6 yard lines
were nothing to sneeze at either. In
fact, both of the Indian scores came
indirectly from these two works of
art.

LOOKED HOT SATTIDY
Well, the 800-erkeley Bears con
tinued their mad rampage by tramp
ing all over the Trojans Saturday.
We're becoming convinced by this
time that they've really got some
thing over there in Strawberry Can
yon.
The Hears piled up yardage and
first downs all over the place and
even Headman Howard Jones of
the Southerners had to admit that
Cal was indeed a wonder team.
Howard said afterwards that
usually after a game the coach feels
that if his team would meet the
same team next week they would
have a good chance to beat their
conquerors . . . but not in this case.
