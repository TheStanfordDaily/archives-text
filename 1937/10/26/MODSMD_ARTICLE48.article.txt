# Cards Admit Washington Line Too Big
## Weak Blocking Against Huskies Responsible For Small Yardage 
### 
"Their defensive line was too
heavy," seemed to be the consensus
of opinion of the 35 Stanford grid
ders who returned from Seattle yes
terday.
Explaining the small yardage they
chalked up Saturday, the Indians ad
mitted that their own offensive
blocking was pretty weak. But
Washington's line averaged 215

pounds from tackle to tackle, a tough
wall to break into.
Bill Paulman will be back in shape
this week, and Coach Tiny Thorn
hill intends to let him make up for
lost time by attempting field goals
instead of punting on fourth downs
in enemy territory.
"It's better than punting, better
than kicking, and will give the boys
another chance to score," explained
the husky varsity mentor.
Paulman tried seven boots from
the 30-yard line yesterday, and all
of them went through the posts. He
also had a good percentage on the
40- and even 50-yard lines.
