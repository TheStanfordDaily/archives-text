# Author To Tell Pioneer Story
## Lampson to Revive Days Of Forty-nine 
### 
In his lecture tonight at 7:30
o'clock in Memorial Hall under the
auspices of the Committee on Public
Exercises, Robin Lampson, noted
author and radio lecturer, will at
tempt what the title of his lecture
implies, "To Bring the Forty-niners
to Life."
Said Author Lampson about to
night's talk, "My personal ambition
as an author is to help preserve the
living, dramatic, human pictures of
early California, and other historical
events.
"In my novel, 'Laughter Out of
the Ground,' in certain of my pres
ent x-adio series talks, and ki to
night's lecture, I am attempting to
'bring the Forty-niners to life' by
drawing upon both fact and imagina
tion to recreate what they have done
and said and felt."
Lampson feels that "many an im
portant event in the epic story of
the American nation from the At
lantic to the shores of the Pacific
has been weathered down to a life
less name and verb and date." It is
his purpose, through fact and fic
tion, to once again make history
live.
Lampson's background afforded
him opportunity to observe early
California. Born in Calaveras Coun
ty, both his grandfathers were pio
neers of the gold rush period. Later
Lampson came to Stanford, where
he studied for three years pri<fr to
his graduation from University of
California.
