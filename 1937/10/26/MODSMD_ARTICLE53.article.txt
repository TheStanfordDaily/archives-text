# Veterans Return For '38 Baseball
## 
### 
With seven lettermen returning,
Baseball Coach Harry Wolter is ex
pecting an improved Stanford horse
hide team when the 1938 season rolls
around. Official practice does not
start until the first of the year, al
though candidates are working out
now.
Much of Coach Wolter's optimism
is because two of the letter-winners
are pitchers Fred Furman and Neil
Rasmussen. If he can uncover a
catcher, the team will be all set.
The other veterans are Captain
George Farrell and Dick Tam at
short and second base, respectively,
and outfielders Glenn Hamilton,
Wally DeWitt and Jimmy Coffisy
Rasmussen, Hamilton, DeWitt ana
Coffis are all on the football team.

Ordinary ropes 14 inches in diam
eter were strong enough to haul the
fire-wrecked Morro Castle from the
beach at Asbury Park, N.J.
