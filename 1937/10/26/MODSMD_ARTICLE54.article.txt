# Papoose Team Faces Tough Grid Contest
## Frosh Football Defeat By Uclans Charged To Lack of Stamina 
### 
This week is going to be a tough
one, filled with plenty of hard work
for the Papoose pigskinners as they
prepare for a game with San Mateo
J.C. next Saturday.
Last Saturday's 14-13 battle with
U.C.L.A. showed up the freshmen's
chief weakness—lack of stamina.
"If they'd held up all the game
like they did in their drives," Coach
Harry Shipkey said yesterday, "they
would have won easily. The boys
showed plenty of improvement, but
they're neither smooth nor condi
tioned enough yet. They need more
hard practice."
Big gun for the frosh Saturday
was, as usual, Captain Norm Stand
lee. He played the full (50 minutes
and before the game was over he
was a very corked Captain Stand
lee. This week Shipkey is shifting
hard-hitting, long-passing Quentin
Thompson from half to full to have
someone who can come in and give
Standlee a bit of rest now and then.
Shipkey has discovered a first
rate end in Arnold Miners, who was
playing in John Cudihy's old spot
against U.C.L.A.
Chick Orme, line captain, Swede
Johansen, and Bill Braheny were
outstanding on the line Saturday, as
was John Kerman, who hasn't quite
recovered from the complications of
a dislocated shoulder. Along with
Standlee, Thor Peterson played a
nice game at half. He kicks just as
far as people have been saying he
could.

strike against the paper's publisher.
