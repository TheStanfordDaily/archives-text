# Hiserman Victor In Squad Sprints
## 
### 
Stan Hiserman stole the show in
Dink Templeton's first intrasquad
meet yesterday afternoon at Angell
Field when he took both sprints; the
100-yard dash in the good early sea
son time of 10.1 seconds, and the
220 in 22.5.
Carl Mahurin's 51-second quarter
mile and Rusty March's 4:39.4 mile
sent them to the tape in front in
their races.
On the field Hugh Gribben spun
the discus out about 145 feetâ€”far
enough to win most meets, while
Jack Lippman put the shot 47 feet
5 inches.
