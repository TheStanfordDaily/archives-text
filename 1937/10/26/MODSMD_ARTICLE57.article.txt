# Championship In Sight For Card Poloists
## Team Shows Ability By Conquering Strong Presidio Squad, 7-2 
### 
With three consecutive wins this
season and no defeats, Captain Hay
don Grubbs' Card polo team seems
well on its way to an undefeated
championship year. Last year the
Cards were runners-up for the Pa
cific Coast intercollegiate cham
pionship, losing the title match to
the University of Arizona.
The Indian horsemen took pos
sibly their toughest opponent right
in their stride last Friday by de
feating the strong Monterey Pre
sidio squad 7-2.
Captain Jim Fullerton and Don
McAusland were high-score men
for the Cards with three goals each.
Bob Wallace brought in the other
point for the Indians and Bert Mc-
Clintock and Steve Downey also saw
action.
Captain Judge and Lt. Vars of the
Monterey Presidio divided on bring
ing in their teams' score. Other
members of the Presidio team were
Lt. Bob Fullerton, captain of last
year's Stanford team and brother of
Jim, and Lt. Brooke, also a member
of last year's Farm squad.
The Monterey Presidio group is
one of the strongest the Indians meet
up with so Farm horsemen have
high hopes and a good chance of
taking the championship this year.
