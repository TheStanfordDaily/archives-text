GREEK women from the Row have been self
consciously prying about for nuggets
from Roble under the foremanship of Panhel
lenic ever since registration day.
• Freshman women have been doing a little
furtive glancing at what look like Row women
ever since the day after registration day.
The first chance for both freshman women
and Greek women to do some out-and-open
mutual scanning of each other came last week
end at the Panhellenic fall quarter teas, when
Row formally met Roble, Redwood, and Deo
dars over punch and cookies.
Last year when Panhellenic first sponsored
the general three-day tea program to supple
ment the usual "informal contact" of autumn
quarter, sorority women gloated over the
chance to get a social glimpse of freshmen be

This year, when Panhellenic continued the
identical tea party plan used last autumn, soro
rity women in general and Panhellenic Council
in particular got too big a swallow of their own
pre-rush teas.
Under the system now used for two years,
the teas are given on Friday, Saturday, and Sun
day in the Women's Clubhouse. Each day one
third of the women from each sorority rush one
third of the freshman women for two hours and

then run up the Row to tell their respective
houses about freshly-discovered nuggets and
not-so-hots.
If sorority women are tiring of the teas, it is
not because they are opposed to an extra op
portunity to meet freshman women, but because
they dislike to drag out to a three-day period
a function that could easily be consolidated into
a one-day affair.
By taking over two floors of the Women's
Clubhouse for three hours on a single afternoon,
assigning half the Row and half the freshmen
alphabetically to each floor, and designating
freshmen to come at various hours so that the
groups would not be bunched together, Pan
hellenic could entertain the already over-teaed
freshman women in one afternoon instead of
spreading social agonies out to three days—
and the Greeks would have just as good a
chance to meet new women.
Such a tea, corresponding, somewhat, to simi
lar large teas for freshmen in other colleges,
would be less like a rushing affair, more like a
really big event. It would eliminate the present
doubtful advantages of splitting freshmen and
Row into thirds for the sake of having smaller,
chummier groups.
Like Boston, Stanford might do well to stage
one major tea party and dump its three super
fluous ones overboard.—M. L.

Such a tea, corresponding, somewhat, to simi

would be less like a rushing affair, more like a
really big event. It would eliminate the present
doubtful advantages of splitting freshmen and
Row into thirds for the sake of having smaller,
chummier groups.

This year, when Panhellenic continued the

in particular got too big a swallow of their own
pre-rush teas.
Under the system now used for two years,
the teas are given on Friday, Saturday, and Sun
day in the Women's Clubhouse. Each day one
third of the women from each sorority rush one
third of the freshman women for two hours and

then run up the Row to tell their respective
houses about freshly-discovered nuggets and
not-so-hots.
If sorority women are tiring of the teas, it is
not because they are opposed to an extra op
portunity to meet freshman women, but because
they dislike to drag out to a three-day period
a function that could easily be consolidated into
a one-day affair.
By taking over two floors of the Women's
Clubhouse for three hours on a single afternoon,
assigning half the Row and half the freshmen
alphabetically to each floor, and designating
freshmen to come at various hours so that the
groups would not be bunched together, Pan
