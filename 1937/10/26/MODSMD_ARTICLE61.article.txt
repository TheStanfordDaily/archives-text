# Meaning for the Digits

### 
FRESHMEN are bewildered, sophomores are
self-centered, seniors are superannuated, or
so the legend goes, which leaves only the jun
iors to carry on any sort of constructive social
program or to build up patterns of co-operative
action.
And this year the juniors, headed by Dave
Ryus, have taken up the challenge of past fail
ures or half-successes and are setting their com
mittee heads together to build up a program of
class functions and class consciousness.
Backbone of this project will be a Junior
Executive Committee made up of representa
tives from all living groups, and intended as
both a governing body and an advisory group.
This group intends to meet bi-weekly; will
during the course of each meeting discuss
plans for the integration and amusement of
Thirty-Niners and will attempt to outline a pro
gram which may be followed by future junior
class presidents.
Fundamental goal of this year's activities will
be a closely knit class with a maximum of class
consciousness and a minimum of ingroup ego-

tism. Too long have chauvinistic students been
satisfied to choose their friends solely from their
own living groups—to actually dodge friend
ships in other organizations.
Knowing this, and knowing that widely varied
contacts constitute the most valuable raw ma
terials of a just-graduated student, juniors may
well support their rejuvenated class program—
a program which will probably be more com
prehensive than any before attempted.
Besides the Prom and Water Carnival there
will probably be a dinner dance and perhaps a
junior weekend, and there is the possibility that
a joint activity will be planned with the junior
class at Cal.
It is upon this varied and ambitious program
that '39 will attempt to mold itself into some
thing more than a couple of digits.—J. R.
