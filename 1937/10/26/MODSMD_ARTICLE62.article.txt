# BULL SESSION
## TELL ME PRETTY MAIDEN 
### 
EVIDENTLY unsatisfied with the publicity his Loy
alist sympathizers have been getting, Irvin Jor
gensen oiled up his ancestral Underwood yesterday and
ran amok through the back page. Before you could say
"Stanford Student Committee for Spanish Loyalist
Medical Aid," The Daily was thick with flying bold
faces, and the flow of sarcasm was assuming flood pro
portions.
The force of Jorgi's onslaught reverberated
through the page, so that other campus opinions ran
screaming back to the editor's desk. The Reviewer
closed up abruptly, muttering gibberish to itself, and
editorials huddled together in their corner. Many an
innocent bystander, ranging from Chester Rowell to the
inventor of the linotype, felt the violence of Jorgi's
assault, but at no time did the warrior attack the point
which I brought up a week ago when our warfare
began.
* * * *
Obviously, Jorgi wants more publicity, and the
least I can do for constitutional democracy, President
Roosevelt and the State Department, is to give their
champion another chance to shout. And so at the
risk of running the subject into the ground, I'll go
over the question once more, hoping that Jorgi will
read it this time before he writes his reply.
Stated briefly the problem which I want Jorgi's
committee to answer is this: If the American nation
als which we send to Spain on humanitarian errands
are killed, will the American people be able to keep
their temper and stay out of the war? At the moment
I am not concerned with 18-em slugs, constitutional
democracies, or Chester Rowell; and I am only indi
rectly interested in Heaven, U.S. Steel, and oppressed
masses, all of which figured obscurely in Jorgi's
iitampedc.
* * * *
4 MERICA has been involved in two wars since the
close of the last century. In both cases our en
trance was precipitated by "accidents" which killed
American citizens; also in both cases there was a back
ground of sympathy, built up by horror stories and
relief campaigns.
The doctors who are being sent to Spain know
what chances they take. It is a magnificent indica
tion of their courage and unselfishness that they are
willing to take those chances. But the doctors would
be the last to wish that America become involved in
a war on their account.
* * * #
Of course, President Roosevelt says that we will
not be drawn into war; of course the State Department
follows a "firmly pacifistic" course. But Roosevelt
will not go down in history for sticking to every thing
he says. The State Department has been known to do
an about-face on its policies.
If the well known American public can keep its
temper when its doctors are abused, the project is
worth all the support we can possibly scrape together.
But if the death of a physician will be the "incident"
that puts us in uniform, our kindly effort will be one
of the four-star mistakes of history. Uniforms are
unbecoming to so many of us.
And so please, Jorgi, when you let drive again, an
swer my question. You've had plenty of publicity,
and you've done right by your little sell. It's your
turn to do some proving now. Answer the question and
rl<i|» the barrage of misplaced modifiers.

EVIDENTLY unsatisfied with the publicity his Loy
alist sympathizers have been getting, Irvin Jor
gensen oiled up his ancestral Underwood yesterday and
ran amok through the back page. Before you could say
"Stanford Student Committee for Spanish Loyalist
Medical Aid," The Daily was thick with flying bold
faces, and the flow of sarcasm was assuming flood pro
portions.
The force of Jorgi's onslaught reverberated
through the page, so that other campus opinions ran
screaming back to the editor's desk. The Reviewer
closed up abruptly, muttering gibberish to itself, and
editorials huddled together in their corner. Many an
innocent bystander, ranging from Chester Rowell to the
inventor of the linotype, felt the violence of Jorgi's
assault, but at no time did the warrior attack the point
which I brought up a week ago when our warfare
began.
* * * *
Obviously, Jorgi wants more publicity, and the
least I can do for constitutional democracy, President
Roosevelt and the State Department, is to give their
champion another chance to shout. And so at the
risk of running the subject into the ground, I'll go
over the question once more, hoping that Jorgi will
read it this time before he writes his reply.
Stated briefly the problem which I want Jorgi's
committee to answer is this: If the American nation
als which we send to Spain on humanitarian errands
are killed, will the American people be able to keep
their temper and stay out of the war? At the moment
I am not concerned with 18-em slugs, constitutional
democracies, or Chester Rowell; and I am only indi
rectly interested in Heaven, U.S. Steel, and oppressed
masses, all of which figured obscurely in Jorgi's
iitampedc.
* * * *
4 MERICA has been involved in two wars since the
close of the last century. In both cases our en
trance was precipitated by "accidents" which killed
American citizens; also in both cases there was a back
ground of sympathy, built up by horror stories and
relief campaigns.
The doctors who are being sent to Spain know
what chances they take. It is a magnificent indica
tion of their courage and unselfishness that they are
willing to take those chances. But the doctors would
be the last to wish that America become involved in
a war on their account.
* * * #
Of course, President Roosevelt says that we will
not be drawn into war; of course the State Department
follows a "firmly pacifistic" course. But Roosevelt
will not go down in history for sticking to every thing
he says. The State Department has been known to do
an about-face on its policies.
If the well known American public can keep its
temper when its doctors are abused, the project is
worth all the support we can possibly scrape together.
But if the death of a physician will be the "incident"
that puts us in uniform, our kindly effort will be one
of the four-star mistakes of history. Uniforms are
unbecoming to so many of us.

swer my question. You've had plenty of publicity,
and you've done right by your little sell. It's your
