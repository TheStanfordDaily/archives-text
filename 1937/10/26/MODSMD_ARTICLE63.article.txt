# REHASHER SEZ:
## 
### 
CHORTLY before last week-end's game which was to
end so favorably for Stanford, Stanford cars were
sartorially enveloped in numerous stickers saying
things like: "WAX WASHINGTON," and "TAME THE
HUSKIES." One car reached the acme of sticker dis
play with: "DAMN THE RALLY COMMITTEE."
Last week, we wrote a very fine REHASHER that
was rejected by the Editor for reasons best known to
himself (no comment), and in it there was comment
concerning a little silver cup that had been on its
side in the Cellar for five or six weeks. Now, if this
column runs, there is no little tipped over silver cup
in the cellar.
Psychology data was considerably increased last
week when several psych students' first reactions to
the word "whiskey," which was given them in a free
word association test, were "sour." This is not in
tended to imply any cynicism.
W/E know a girl at Roble who went to the Roble
Formal last week, and not long before hand, she
needed a date. She did not call a sponsor in Encina,
as some have done in the past. Instead, she phoned
home to Utah and invited a young gentleman. He
accepted, and according to reports enjoyed himself
here on the Farm. This, we feel, is a good system; it
brings new blood to the campus.
A certain Stanford head yell-leader goes to all
the jolly-ups on the campus and there meets various
women, predominantly freshmen. After the ball is
over, he dashes home to write down names, with per
sonal comments on each.
The following list is the end-product of one of his
more recent ventures. Names have been omitted for
obvious reasons. —Swell, smart; —young, cute, but
dumb ; —O.K.; —mean; —very good! —toots; —jane;
—dark, mouth; and this continues, jolly-up after
jolly-up.
Despite all this he was nonplussed the other night
when it came to asking someone for a date.
Climacks.
Anti-climacks.
