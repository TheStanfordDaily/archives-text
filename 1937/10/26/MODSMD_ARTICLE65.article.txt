with Loy's young sister and her
fiance.

Carries Bride OfT
Meanwhile, Powell has been try
ing to coach enough nerve into the
fiance so that he will knock his rival,
Powell, down. He makes several at
tempts, but isn't successful till the
last scene. Then he carries his in
tended off to a taxi, literally.
Powell's background receives a
good deal of play, when it comes out
that the divorced a former wife be
cause she had too much money. He
had also been a guide in Paris.
There he met Loy's employer, who
is backing the dress-shop to evade

a well-written and handled script,
excellent acting, as well as William
Powell and Myrna Loy.

become involved

with Loy's young sister and her
fiance.
Lives in Trailer
Powell lives in a trailer, paints,
tries to direct movies, but can't get
producers, writes his own scripts,
and has beer with eggs for break
fast.
The young fiance has a terrible
time with the young sister, who
thinks she may be infatuated with
Powell. She isn't sure till he
changes his mind and says he won't
marry her. Then, she isn't in love
with him.
Carries Bride OfT
Meanwhile, Powell has been try
ing to coach enough nerve into the
fiance so that he will knock his rival,
Powell, down. He makes several at
tempts, but isn't successful till the
last scene. Then he carries his in
tended off to a taxi, literally.
Powell's background receives a
good deal of play, when it comes out
that the divorced a former wife be
cause she had too much money. He
had also been a guide in Paris.
There he met Loy's employer, who
is backing the dress-shop to evade
income tax, "cheat the government,"
she called it. Miss Loy, it seems,
proved too efficient, and constantly
had her salary raised to cut down
profits.
The picture is a farce in every
sense. It has many humorous spots,
a well-written and handled script,
excellent acting, as well as William
Powell and Myrna Loy.
