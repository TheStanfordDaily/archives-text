# Spanish Aid Group Seeks Dance Okay
## Ex Committee Will Hear Request; To Discuss Nitery, Movie Plan 
### 
Growing localization of campus
interest in the civil conflict in Spain
will be brought to some sort of a
head tonight in Ex Committee meet
ing.
Special instigator of official dis
cussion of the subject will be the
request of the Stanford Student
Committee for Spanish Medical Aid
to hold a campus dance.
Sanction Needed
Since A.S.S.U. sanction of the
dance will carry obvious broad im
plications, hot discussion on the
question is to be expected. In grant
ing or refusing the date, some sort
of policy forming precedent may be
set by the group.
Second important topic of discus
sion will be the completion of plans
to show, movies in the Nitery on
Wednesday or Thursday night. This
move is in answer to last week's
agreement that the Nitery was not
filling the place that it held as cam
pus entertainment center during
summer quarter.
Present plans are to show pictures
of last Saturday's Washington-Stan
ford football game.
Discuss Rally
Also on schedule for tonight's
meeting is further formulation of
plans for the "safe, sane freshman
pajamarino rally" for the S.C. game.
Advantage will be taken of Fox-
West Coast's offer of the Varsity
Theater for a free evening's enter
tainment. Rally Committee may
complete the program with a stage
show.
Discussion will also center around
the Sunday night movies, the first
of which is scheduled for this Sun
day night, October 31.
