# C.I.O. Offers To Reunite With A.F.L.
## Self-government, Union By Industries Asked In Caucus Scene 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 (UP). â€”
The Committee for Industrial Or
ganization offered today to rejoin
the American Federation of Labor
provided it retains independent
self-government and gets the right
to organize workers in mass pro
duction and certain other industries.
The C.1.0. offer contained three
stipulations, drafted at a pre-confer
cnce caucus between the ten dele
gates and their leader, John L.
Lewis. Its terms made it appear that
their acceptance by the A. F. of L.
virtually would give the Lewis fac
tion control of the combined organ
ization.
New Department Defined
The C.1.0. proposals were:
"1. That the American Federation
of Labor shall declare as one of its
basic policies that the organization
of the workers in the mass produc
tion, marine, public utilities, service,
and basic fabricating industries be
effectuated only on an industrial
basis.
"2. That thei-e shall be created
within the American Federation of
Labor a department to be known as
the C.1.0. All of the national and
international unions and local in
dustrial unions now affiliated with
the C.1.0. shall be affiliated with
such new department. This depart
ment shall be completely autono
mous, operating under its own de
partmental constitution, and shall
be directed by its own properly des
ignated officers. This department
shall have the complete and sole
jurisdiction in regard to (a) the or
ganization of the workers in the in
dustries described in point 1 above;
and also (b) any matters affecting
its affiliated organizations and their
members.
National Conventions
"3. There shall be called at such
time and at such place as may be
agreed upon between the American
Federation of Labor and the Com
mittee for Industrial Organization,
a national convention which shall
be attended by all of the national
and international unions, and local
industrial unions affiliated with the
A. F. of L. and the C.1.0.
"This convention shall be called
for the purpose of approving the
foregoing agreement and for work
ing out the necessary rules and reg
ulations to effectuate the same and
to guarantee the fulfillment of the
program."
