the Palo Alto Medical Society went

created a serious health situation at
Stanford.
Passed unanimously the resolu
tion read: "Whereas, it is apparent
that the capacity of the Palo Alto
Hospital is continuously overtaxed,
it is respectfully requested that the
building of the new wing be ex
pedited."
