# Nitery to Show Game Pictures
## Card-Husky Tilt Movies To Initiate Series 
### 
In answer to Ex Committee's
agreement last week that the Nitery
needed some sort of revitalization,
plans have gone through to show
moving pictures of the Washington-
Stanford football game tonight. The
show will be at 8:15, admission free.
Plans for the film showing have
been handled by Dave Ryus, junior
class president, who reported to Ex
Committee last night that the pic
tures had arrived, and arrangements
with the Corporation Yard made for
projection machinery. If the Nitery
proves inadequate to accommodate
the crowd tonight, a repeat perform
ance may be given tomorrow night.
It was suggested to Ex Committee
by Gordy Frost, Daily editor, that a
portable bar be rigged up to mix
cokes on the spot. The plan of Sig
ma Delta Chi, honorary journalistic
society, to hold a photography con
test will further bolster student in
terest in the Nitery, as they will dis
play contest entries in the campus
night spot.
