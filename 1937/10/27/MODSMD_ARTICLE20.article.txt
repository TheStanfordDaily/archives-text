# Art Gallery Shows California Views
## 
### 
A William Keith view of Mount
Shasta, which was donated to the
University recently by Mrs. William
Babcock, is currently on exhibit at
the Stanford Art Gallery.
The gallery earlier had acquired
two other pictures by Keith, who
was a California landscape painter.
One of these, "In the Sierras," is
also now on exhibit. Thirty works
of members of the Carmel Art As
sociation are also included in the
present display at the gallery.
