# Excom Withholds Sanction of Spain Aid Group Dance
## Jorgensen Appeal Denied as Involving Question of Farm Policy 
### JIM STONE 
With Jack Calderwood's opinion that "we don't want Stanford's name
used for the cause" as general theme, Ex Committee last night unani
mously refused to grant the Stanford Student Committee for Spanish
Medical Aid a date for a campus dance.
Tom Killefer summed up Ex Committee objections to granting the
date in saying, "It would he a had precedent to set." He further pointed

that, after discussing the ques
tion with President Wilbur, he had
come to the conclusion that such an
action would probably be consid
ered as evidence of partisan action
by Stanford.
Mark Hopkins argued that in pre
viously granting sanction to func
tions of such groups as the Young
Democrats, an applicable precedent
had already been set since such
groups, like the Committee for
Spanish Aid, likewise were not defi
nitely concerned with Stanford
problems.
In granting the date, both Irvin
Jorgensen, head of the aid commit
tee, and Mark Hopkins felt A.S.S.U.
sanction of the broader cause was
not necessarily implied because the
committee's chief concern was in
proceeding under legal A.S.S.U. ma
chinery.
While Ex Committee agreed that
it might be technically correct to
grant the date, Calderwood pointed
out that the problem was more than
that of just granting a date. Not
only would outside opinion suggest
that Stanford was taking a partisan
viewpoint on the whole Spanish
civil war question, but a precedent
would be set whereby other groups
with similar, but perhaps less worth
while purposes, would be able to use
Stanford's name.
"It is meddling in foreign affairs,"
said Cynthia Coonley. That the is
sue reached farther than mere stu
dent concern with campus affairs,
and would definitely involve univer
sity as well as student policy, was
pointed out by Killefer. General
opinion was that it would be impos
sible to grant the date and still
maintain the impression of impartial
A.S.S.U. concern with the larger
issue.
It was suggested after the re
fusals of the date that Jorgensen
make plans to hold the dance off
campus, and dissociate from official
student concern.
LIBRARY COMMITTEE: John
Dern, head of the committee to in
vestigate the question of keeping the
library open Sunday nights, rc
ported that after meeting with Na
than Van Patten, director of the
library, it was decided to hold a
student poll of the question. The
polls will be open Thursday and
Friday in the library, students will |
vote on the two questions: "Do you j
need the library open on Sunday j
nights?" and "What department of
the library would you use at that i
time?" Place will be left for in
dividual remarks. All ballots will \
be signed and checked with the 1
Bawlout to insure legality. Mr. Van
Patten, Dern said, will abide by the j
result of the poll, and the question j
will be settled once and for all.
