# Hoover Warns Republicans To Get New Men
## Landon, Hamilton Fight Ex-President's Plan For Extra Conclave 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. 26 (U.R).â€”Herbert
Hoover tonight said he did not want
public office and called upon the
Republican party to arm itself with
"new faces and new blood" to fight
the New Deal's "creeping collectiv
ism."
The former President, in an ad
dress before the Massachusetts State
Republican Club, called for a re
nascence of the party with an affir
mative program, "responsive to the
needs and crises of the people."
Denies Candidacy
He responded to reports that he
desired once more to be a candidate
for President in 1940 with the asser
tion:
"Before I go further (not that it is
of any importance but just to keep
the air clean) let me repeat once
again that I do not want any public
office."
As the former President spoke,
Alfred M. Landon, Republican stand
ard-bearer in the last presidential
campaign, was in conference at To
peka, Kans., with John D. M. Ham
ilton, Republican National Chair
man. Landon, considered Hoover's
rival for party leadership, has op
posed the Hoover proposal for a
mid-term Republican convention.
Plans Re-born Party
Hoover reiterated this proposal as
part of his plan for a re-born party
which "must make possible humani
tarian objectives which are other
wise wrecked by wrongful and inef
fective methods."
The proposal will be considered
next week in Chicago at a meeting
of the Republican National Commit
tee.
