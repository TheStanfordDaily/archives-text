# Palo Alto Players Will Stage Satire
## 
### 
Palo Alto Community Players'
Workshop will burlesque college
football of the "Gay Nineties" in
their presentation of "The Viper of
the Varsity" next Friday and Sat
urday nights at 8:15 o'clock. The
football gear to be used will be
loaned by the Stanford B.A.C. and
will lend an air of authenticity to the
piece.
Included in the program are a
men's Floradora dance and a com
munity sing. Arthur Post, former
Stanford student, and Ad Dewey,
one-time Paly High coach, have the
comedy leads. B. Russell Brinley,
also of Stanford, is assistant director
and a member of the Floradora trio.
Twenty per cent of all the timber
cut in the world is wasted in the
sawdust.
