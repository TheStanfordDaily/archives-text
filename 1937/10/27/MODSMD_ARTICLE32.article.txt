# Great Pyramid Origin In Doubt, Says Senior
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
From Egyptian pyramids to the Stanford campus is a long jump,
but Senior John Haffner bridged it in a talk in a speech class last
quarter. His speech on the Great Pyramid proved so interesting to the
class and instructor that it was put on the Speakers' Bureau reper
toire. The subject matter of the talk, with additional facts, is relayed
to Daily readers in this and a succeeding article.—The Editor

It may be of more interest than
importance and it may be no re
flection on the Stanford way of
teaching, but most Farm students go
through their entire freshman year
studying the history of Western
Civilization without realizing that
the Great Pyramid possibly was not
built by the Egyptians.
While all historians and laymen

will concede that the other pyramids
were constructed by the Egyptian
Pharaohs, many authorities today
hold that the Great Pyramid was
built before the time of the Egyp
tians by the lost people of Atlantis.
Senior Advances Theory
This theory, which has been
brought to the surface at Stanford
by John Haffner, Farm senior, in a
speech he gave before the Speakers
Bureau last quarter and which he
will repeat winter quarter, has been
known for nearly a hundred years.
Those who hold this theory point
to the obvious superiority of this
pyramid to all others and. its con
nection with the very mysterious
and unexplainable Sphinx. They
say it took a much superior race
than the Egyptians to construct it.
Atlantians Given Credit
Credit for building it, therefore,
has been given to the mythical At
lantians. And granting there was
a race of people living in Atlantis,
according to Haffner, these people
could very conceivably have left the
Great Pyramid as a deposit of their
weights and measures marking the
height their civilization reached.
The reason why people think it is
a weights and measures deposit is
that so many of its measurements
have significant meanings. Every
thing in the pyramid was built in
terms of 10 and 9. For instance, its
height taken 10 to the ninth power
gives the exact distance to the sun.
And the diagonal of the base divided
by the height gives 180 pi exactly.

It may be of more interest than
importance and it may be no re
flection on the Stanford way of
teaching, but most Farm students go
through their entire freshman year
studying the history of Western
Civilization without realizing that
the Great Pyramid possibly was not
built by the Egyptians.
While all historians and laymen

will concede that the other pyramids
were constructed by the Egyptian
Pharaohs, many authorities today
hold that the Great Pyramid was
built before the time of the Egyp
tians by the lost people of Atlantis.
Senior Advances Theory
This theory, which has been
brought to the surface at Stanford
by John Haffner, Farm senior, in a
speech he gave before the Speakers
Bureau last quarter and which he
will repeat winter quarter, has been
known for nearly a hundred years.
Those who hold this theory point
to the obvious superiority of this
pyramid to all others and. its con
nection with the very mysterious
and unexplainable Sphinx. They
say it took a much superior race
than the Egyptians to construct it.
Atlantians Given Credit
Credit for building it, therefore,
has been given to the mythical At
lantians. And granting there was
a race of people living in Atlantis,
according to Haffner, these people
could very conceivably have left the
Great Pyramid as a deposit of their
weights and measures marking the
height their civilization reached.
The reason why people think it is
a weights and measures deposit is
that so many of its measurements
have significant meanings. Every
thing in the pyramid was built in
terms of 10 and 9. For instance, its
height taken 10 to the ninth power
gives the exact distance to the sun.
And the diagonal of the base divided
by the height gives 180 pi exactly.
From Egyptian pyramids to the Stanford campus is a long jump,
but Senior John Haffner bridged it in a talk in a speech class last
quarter. His speech on the Great Pyramid proved so interesting to the
class and instructor that it was put on the Speakers' Bureau reper
toire. The subject matter of the talk, with additional facts, is relayed
to Daily readers in this and a succeeding article.—The Editor
