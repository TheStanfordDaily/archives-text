# British Ruler Offers Peace Rearmament
## King George Discusses War Policy in First Parliament Speech 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 26 (U.R). â€” King |
George VI, faltering and struggling
to overcome an old impediment of
speech, told his Parliament today in
an address from the throne that
Great Britain strives for peace in
Spain and the Far East, but is pre
paring hourly for war.
The 41-year-old monarch, coming
before Parliament for the first time
since his brother Edward's abdica
tion, appeared' in the House of Lords
in a mantle of red and black after a !
ceremonial ride from Buckingham
Palace.
Spain Conflict
"My Ministers," he said, reading
haltingly from a gold-edged manu
script, "have followed with growing
concern the continuance of the con
flict in Spain. It is their aim to do
everything that lies within their
power to assist toward restoration of
peace among the Spanish people.
"They believe that strict -applica
tion of the international policy of |
non-intervention in Spain will ma
terially contribute to this end.
Considers Far East
"The position in the Far East will
continue to engage the earnest at- !
tention of my government, who will
persist in their policy of attempting
in co-operation with other govern
ments, whether members of the
League of Nations or not, to miti
gate the suffering caused by the con
flict and bring it to a conclusion." I
The King's speech came jerkily.
He bunched words, then took long,
nervous pauses.
The peers of the House of Lords,
gorgeous in their robes of state, |
coughed in embarrassment.
Although he did not stammer, the
monarch encountered the most diffi
culty during his remarks on the Far
East. Sometimes he paused for as i
long as 10 seconds, then his lips 1
moved but no sound came.
