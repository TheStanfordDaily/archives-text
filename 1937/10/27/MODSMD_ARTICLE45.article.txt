All. THE MYSTERY
IS CLEARED
At last the mystery of Pete the
Halfback has been cleared away and
A1 Masters can once again rest in
peace.
Al, Don Liebendorfer, and Tiny
Thornhill were all wondering yes
terday morning what they were
going to do with the 425-lb. half
back that Tiny had won in a
national contest.
This strange little tale started
a while ago when the Athletic
Round Table Club of Spokane,
Wash., started their nation-wide
groan contest. The object of the con
test was to find the biggest moaner
among the football coaches of the
country.
All the grid mentors sent in let
ters, and Tiny's letter was among
the pile of missives heaped up on
the Round Table in Spokane. Sev
eral days ago Tiny was notified that
his letter had won second place in
this nation-wide groan contest. It
seems that the coach of a jerk-water
joint in Kansas won the first prize
of $500 worth of athletic equipment.
IS PETE AN APE
OR TRAINED BEAR?
The second prize was withheld as
a secret until both Tiny and Al
received telegrams from Spokane
telling them to meet the train car
rying a 425-pound halfback which
the Indian mentor had won as sec
ond prize.
Verbal bets were being waged
as to whether this brobdinegian
was a hear or an ape . . . certain
ly it couldn't be a real honest-to
goodness human football player.
Well, Pete the Halfback arrived
on the Farm yesterday afternoon
... all 6 feet 8 of him, and all 425
pounds. Pete, alias Tiny Christen
son, turned out to be a human be
ing. Pete is a retired auctioneer on
his first trip to California. When he
got off the train in Oakland and
boarded a ferry for San Francisco
this morning, Pete glanced up and
noticed the name of the bay pad- 1
dler, "Santa Clara."
He jumped up, reached for his !
luggage (a single grip containing a i
helmet and a football) and dashed
for the side of the boat, exclaiming,
"I'm on the wrong boat ... I want
the one going to Stanford."
PETE WILL BE
AROUND SATURDAY
Pete's trainer spent a whole hour j
in San Francisco throwing ham and j
eggs at him, and Al is worried about
the feeding problem between now
and game time Saturday.
Pete disappeared from the Farm
yesterday hut assured Tiny he
would be around for the Oregon
State battle Saturday afternoon.
The northern club, intended to i
revive football interest in the na- I
tion in general and the Northwest j
in particular, figured that Tiny 1
didn't have much of a football
game this coming week-end so he
would have plenty of time to show
his newly acquired man-mountain
gridster around the campus.
Maybe they haven't heard, but I
right there in their own Northwest
they have a team called Oregon
State which whipped Washington
(5-3 and knocked over Oregon 14-0.
It'll be a real ball game Saturday,
and don't let anybody tell you dif
ferent.

All. THE MYSTERY
IS CLEARED
At last the mystery of Pete the
Halfback has been cleared away and
A1 Masters can once again rest in
peace.
Al, Don Liebendorfer, and Tiny
Thornhill were all wondering yes
terday morning what they were
going to do with the 425-lb. half
back that Tiny had won in a
national contest.
This strange little tale started
a while ago when the Athletic
Round Table Club of Spokane,
Wash., started their nation-wide
groan contest. The object of the con
test was to find the biggest moaner
among the football coaches of the
country.
All the grid mentors sent in let
ters, and Tiny's letter was among
the pile of missives heaped up on
the Round Table in Spokane. Sev
eral days ago Tiny was notified that
his letter had won second place in
this nation-wide groan contest. It
seems that the coach of a jerk-water
joint in Kansas won the first prize
of $500 worth of athletic equipment.
IS PETE AN APE
OR TRAINED BEAR?
The second prize was withheld as
a secret until both Tiny and Al
received telegrams from Spokane
telling them to meet the train car
rying a 425-pound halfback which
the Indian mentor had won as sec
ond prize.
Verbal bets were being waged
as to whether this brobdinegian
was a hear or an ape . . . certain
ly it couldn't be a real honest-to
goodness human football player.
Well, Pete the Halfback arrived
on the Farm yesterday afternoon
... all 6 feet 8 of him, and all 425
pounds. Pete, alias Tiny Christen
son, turned out to be a human be
ing. Pete is a retired auctioneer on
his first trip to California. When he
got off the train in Oakland and
boarded a ferry for San Francisco
this morning, Pete glanced up and
noticed the name of the bay pad- 1
dler, "Santa Clara."
He jumped up, reached for his !
luggage (a single grip containing a i
helmet and a football) and dashed
for the side of the boat, exclaiming,
"I'm on the wrong boat ... I want
the one going to Stanford."
PETE WILL BE
AROUND SATURDAY
Pete's trainer spent a whole hour j
in San Francisco throwing ham and j
eggs at him, and Al is worried about
the feeding problem between now
and game time Saturday.
Pete disappeared from the Farm
yesterday hut assured Tiny he
would be around for the Oregon
State battle Saturday afternoon.
The northern club, intended to i
revive football interest in the na- I
tion in general and the Northwest j
in particular, figured that Tiny 1
didn't have much of a football
game this coming week-end so he
would have plenty of time to show
his newly acquired man-mountain
gridster around the campus.
Maybe they haven't heard, but I
right there in their own Northwest
they have a team called Oregon
State which whipped Washington
(5-3 and knocked over Oregon 14-0.
It'll be a real ball game Saturday,
and don't let anybody tell you dif
ferent.
