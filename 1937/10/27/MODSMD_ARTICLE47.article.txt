# Boxers Sought By Ring Coach
## Frye Wants Light Men For Novice Meet 
### DOUG JAQUES 
With the novice tournament near
ly four weeks off, the biggest box
ing news on the Farm remains that
this year a new coach, Clayton Frye,
is in charge of the square-ring
sports, boxing and wrestling.
Sitting at his desk in the Encina
Gym, looking far more comfortable
than anyone should on a warm day,
Coach Frye had two very definite
ideas.
He likes working at Stanford very
much, and he wishes a few light
weight men would turn out for
boxing.
The novice tournament, on No
vember 11, should attract some
lower weight men, he feels. Any
one who enters and wins, or even
shows promise, will be pretty well
assured of a job on the team.
Many inexperienced boxers don't
enter the tournament because they
fear that they will come up against
men who are in the veteran class
and who will easily beat them. That
idea, Frye pointed out, is far from
the truth because men who have
won a novice or University tourna
ment title, or who have made their
letter in boxing are not eligible to
compete.
As for the regular boxing season
against other schools, starting next
quarter, Frye feels that Stanford
will fare better than it has in other
seasons. But he can't have any ac
curate idea this early how his team
will shape up.
