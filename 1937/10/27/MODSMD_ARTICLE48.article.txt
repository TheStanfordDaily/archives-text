## Six Points Dropping on Stone 
### SPORTS EDITOR—GENE GEAR 

GRANT STONE, No. 40, is shown as he waited with other Stan
ford players and a group of University of Washington Huskies for
Jimmy Johnston's kick, blocked by Bill Willard to come to earth.
The ball dropped into Stone's arms to give the Indians their first
touchdown. •
