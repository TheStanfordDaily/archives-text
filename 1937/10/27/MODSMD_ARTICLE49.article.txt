# Hank Leaves Hospital; Hoopsters Work Out
## 
### 
In the hospital only a week after an appendectomy, Angela "Hank"
Luisetti, Stanford's basketball marvel, was released from Palo Alto Hos
pital yesterday morning, and will he back in suit after three weeks, ac
cording to Coach John Bunn.
The black-haired national hoop-scoring record holder was operated
on a week ago yesterday by Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician, after being

stricken the previous Sunday. Lui
setti has been bothered by the at
tacks at different times during his
varsity career, but none was serious
enough to warrant x - emoval of his
appendix.
Team Works Out
Apart from Hank, main cog in the
outfit with which Bunn will seek a
third consecutive P.C.C. champion
ship this season, the varsity has
been getting along with few mis
haps in its three workouts a week.
H. B. Lee, diminutive candidate
for a first-string guard spot, banged
up a knee last week and is limping
along unable to get itito practice.
His injury is estimated to be not
very serious, and a short absence
should not materially hamper his
chances, according to Bunn.
Defense Drill
The team started on defense drill
yesterday after having worked so
far this season on fundamentals of
offense. How-to-stop-'em practice
will continue today and tomorrow
and throughout next week, Bunn
said yesterday, after which the
Kansas-born nestor will start pick
ing his teams.
One of the jokers in his player
juggling, according to Bunn, will be
Bob Burnett, recruit from last year's
baseball team who has been zoom
ing through early practices at a
terrific gait. Where Ihe hard-hitting,
dynamic Burnett will fit in is both
ering Bunn, but on the kid's record
so far it looks as if he were going
to nose into the top flight with the
maestros.

Napoleon's handwriting was so il
legible that several of his letters
were taken for maps of battlefields.
