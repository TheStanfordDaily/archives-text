Cal in Lead
California, defending champion,
has won one game and was tied by
San Jose State to top the standings
at present. Closely behind the Bears
come the Dons and Indians, who
are tied for second with one victory
and one defeat.
Apparently satisfied with the de
fensive work of his fullbacks, Bill
Hamilton and Ken Cuthbertson,
and Goalie Louis Faulb, Coach Har
ry Maloney will stress offensive tac
tics this week in order to find a
scoring combination.
Offense Weak
In three games the defense has
limited the opposition to three goals,
an average of one per contest. The
forward line, on the other hand, has
shown strong scoring possibilities
by having possession of the ball in
enemy territory during most of the
games, but has been unable to find
a final scoring punch.
By way of improving his offense,
Malone yhas scheduled a game with
Menlo Jaysee, who upset the Cards,
1-0, last week in a practice meet,
and will try out several new combi
nations until a winning forward line
is found.
