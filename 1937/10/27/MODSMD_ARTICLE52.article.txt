# Papoose Team Prepares For San Mateans
## 
### 
What Stanford's frosh football
team needs right now is about two
tough weeks of practice and a hard
game Saturday to get in shape for
the Little Big Game against the Cal
Cubs November 6. â€¢
And that's exactly what they're
getting.
The Papooses meet San Mateo J.C.
as a prologue to the Oregon State
game next week, and San Mateo is
tough enough to put practically any
team in shape.
After the exceptional showings in
the U.C.L.A. game Arnold Miners
will work out in the first string right
end spot this week, and Quentin
Thompson will get a good, steady,
hold on the ropes of his new full
back job.
