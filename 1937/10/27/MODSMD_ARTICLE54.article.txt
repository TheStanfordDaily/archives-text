# Waterpoloists To Meet O.C.
## Hoover Back at Guard; Prospects Brighter 
### 
Prospects for Stanford water- |
polo victories in games scheduled
with the Olympic Club Friday in
San Francisco became much brighter
with the return of Dick Hoover, •
sophomore guard, yesterday.
Hoover was out-of the Southern
California tussle with a bad gash |
under his eye. With him out of the
line-up, Coach Nort Thornton was |
compelled to move Johnny Lamb,
the team's best potential scorer,
from forward to guard. Consequent
ly the offense bogged down com
pletely against the Trojans.
Now Thornton has Lamb back in
his best position where he will
probably team with Harvey Roths- |
child, another ex-guard.
As if the loss of Hoover last week j
weren't enough, the squad is now '
minus Bill Bleeker and Jack Vibert, !
who are cooped up in the rest home.
Both, however, may be able to play !
in San Francisco.
Michigan is blocking and tackling j
so viciously this year thai Coach j
Harry Kipke smilingly admits that ■
they had to repay- the blocking and j
tackling dummies four times since i
practice started.

A new low was recorded at En
cina dining hall when only 8G
freshmen arrived for Friday's eve
ning meal. Ruhh dates claimed the
missing diners.

The Tau Sigma sorority of the
University of Kansas gives lessons
in ballroom dancing to all comers
each Tuesday and Thursday night,
for 10 cents.
