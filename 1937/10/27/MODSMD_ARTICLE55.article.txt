## They All Forgot To Laugh 
### 
LAST night Irvin Jorgensen, for three year's
Stanford's ace humorist, took himself too
seriously.
Last night Ex Committee, which for three
years has laughed at, and with, Jorgi, also took
itself too seriously.
Everyone forgot to laugh this time, and this
was the time when everyone should have.
The inimitable Jorgensen, who has poked fun
at everyone since Our Hasher made The Daily
three years ago, asked Ex Committee for an
official date on which to hold a dance to raise
funds for the medical aid of Spanish loyalists,
the committee for which, he heads.
He wanted official sanction.
Ex Committee, awfully afraid that the good
name of Stanford would be involved in an in
ternational conflagration, decided it could not
enter officially into anything which might be
construed as a display of feeling toward one
Cause or the other.
It told Stanford's funnyman, no.
It looked down its collective nose and said,
"Go ahead and have your dance if you want to
but don't rope us in." And the boy who has
laughed at everyone looked at the floor and

tramped away mumbling oaths at the reaction
ary nationalists.
Both ruined the gag by forgetting to laugh.
When Jorgensen started his little committee
a few days ago he expressed the desire to keep
it light, airy, and fun. Meetings would be held
in a popular cellar down the highway, activities
would be along highly entertaining lines, no
ugly hand-to-hand collecting would be done.
The idea was refreshingly different.
But when the Cause goes serious, seeks offi
cial sanction from a body which similarly has
gone serious, the whole thing takes on the mor
bid tone of the underdog at bay, the Commun
nist-in-the-corner light.
Whether collecting money for the medical
aid of Spanish loyalists is a good thing or not,
has not entered vitally into the argument, and
it's probably just as well, because we don't
think that anyone actually knows or can prove
that it is either good or bad.
But it is true that the inimitable Jorgi, who has
dished up piles of "Garbage" for these col
umns, called by himself "the end product of
nosing around Wong's kitch," forgot to laugh
and so did Ex Committee, while another good
Cause went wrong.
