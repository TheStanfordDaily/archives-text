# Who Is the College?

### 
WTA7HO is the college?" may sound like
VV a simple question but it is one which
demands penetrating analysis and thoughtful
reasoning before it can be answered ade
quately.
And it is answered adequately, even bril
liantly, by Thomas N. Barrows in an article in
a current issue of School and Society.
Essence of Barrows' answer is that college
"is not a person; is not a thing; it cannot be
weighed, measured, counted or otherwise ob
jectively invoiced. For all its equipment and
personnel, its curriculum and system have been
set going in the hope that something imponder
able but stupendously real will happen.
"Just as seeds are planted each spring with
faith in nature, so college looks to the vitaliz
ing spirit which moves in the universe to bring
about in the well-cultivated academic plot some
germination of ideas, some evolution of human
experience, some flowering of mind and spirit."
Obviously this is all true. The college is not
the board of trustees, nor the alumni, nor the
faculty, nor the students. It is not a group of
buildings, a campus, a housing plant—it is no
one of these things but their totality.
However, to be really effective, there must
be still another ingredient. Intangible and yet
potent; nameless but essential—this last we
call, in our particular case, for lack of any
better terminology, "Stanford spirit."

By this we do not mean the traditional rah rah
rahs nor "collegiate" sophistry; simply that
spiritual force which unifies and co-ordinates the
numerous and varied components of a college
and makes from them a living, pulsating whole
which cannot be mistaken for the representation
of any one or any group of influences.
This force has revealed itself at Stanford by
such divergent manifestations as the Cope let
ter, the anti-Cope letters, the vital concern of
many students with University problems, and
even the almost sacred college memories of
life-hardened alumni.
The vigor of the whole institution depends
upon the influence of this force. Through its
machinations a college may become an effec
tive, integrated organization or it may slump
into a morass of stupid inefficiency and dis
organization.
Therefore the college is this spirit which mo
tivates the university, unifies it, and endows it
with organic vitality.—J. R.

Essence of Barrows' answer is that college
"is not a person; is not a thing; it cannot be
weighed, measured, counted or otherwise ob
jectively invoiced. For all its equipment and
personnel, its curriculum and system have been
set going in the hope that something imponder
able but stupendously real will happen.
"Just as seeds are planted each spring with
faith in nature, so college looks to the vitaliz
ing spirit which moves in the universe to bring
about in the well-cultivated academic plot some
germination of ideas, some evolution of human
experience, some flowering of mind and spirit."
Obviously this is all true. The college is not
the board of trustees, nor the alumni, nor the
faculty, nor the students. It is not a group of
buildings, a campus, a housing plant—it is no
one of these things but their totality.
However, to be really effective, there must
be still another ingredient. Intangible and yet
potent; nameless but essential—this last we
call, in our particular case, for lack of any
better terminology, "Stanford spirit."

By this we do not mean the traditional rah rah
rahs nor "collegiate" sophistry; simply that
spiritual force which unifies and co-ordinates the
numerous and varied components of a college
and makes from them a living, pulsating whole
which cannot be mistaken for the representation
of any one or any group of influences.
This force has revealed itself at Stanford by
such divergent manifestations as the Cope let
ter, the anti-Cope letters, the vital concern of
many students with University problems, and
even the almost sacred college memories of
life-hardened alumni.
The vigor of the whole institution depends
upon the influence of this force. Through its
machinations a college may become an effec
tive, integrated organization or it may slump
into a morass of stupid inefficiency and dis
organization.
Therefore the college is this spirit which mo
tivates the university, unifies it, and endows it
with organic vitality.—J. R.
WTA7HO is the college?" may sound like
VV a simple question but it is one which
demands penetrating analysis and thoughtful
reasoning before it can be answered ade
quately.
And it is answered adequately, even bril
liantly, by Thomas N. Barrows in an article in
a current issue of School and Society.
