MAN TIIE LIFEBOATS
A CCORDING to reports from various colleges, this
is going to be one of those years when moralists
move in on the universities and try to establish a com
pulsory R.O.T.C. for the army of righteousness. In
Oklahoma, a pastor is launching a major offensive
against the powers of darkness, seeking a "moral re
birth." Over at Oxford, the students are planning to
demonstrate something new in assault and battery on
the next man who mentions "sex" or "orgy."
At Stanford, militant supporters of sanctimonious
ness have already given evidence of throwing their
weight about. Early in the year, the health service
had to give a hasty explanation of the nude (oh,
nasty word) photographs which are used to correct
posture defects in women students.
♦ * * *
There are also indications that opposition to the
iron-clad moralists is surging about in the Stanford
breast. The University rulings on liquor have under
gone bitter assaults almost from the first day the
school opened. It is not hard to discover bitter enemies
of (he lockout system and its pessimistic philosophy.
The other day a letter came in to the editor protest
ing fiercely against the double riveted dancing con
ventions that make the "big apple" definitely out of
bounds at Stanford.
I tlooks as though there is going to be quite a
battle between the moralists and the "moralless" not
only at Stanford but all over the country. But
prophets and history students report that the moralists
will win on the first putsch. The reason is that the
majority of our colleges are co-educational. And no
co-educational university dares stick out its tongue
at the prudes.
* * * » »
r I"'HE parents of masculine students are not particu
larly upset when some reformer begins to shout of
corruption, sex, and the wages of sin. They credit
their boys wtih enough intelligence to behave them
selves. But at the first bluenose assault on a co-educa
tional college, girls' parents spring into action like
a horse-opera hero. There is frantic talk of "reputa
tion." Protesting telegrams pour in on deans and
trustees. From a hundred homes there rises the
chorus, "My God. My daughter!" The moralists win
on a freeze-out, and nobody benefits but Western
Union.
No university that depends on women students to
keep it afloat can afford to ignore the blasts of the
sanctimonious. Rigid convention and continual ex
planation are the price we pay for co-education.
* * * *
Those liberal souls who arc determined to tell the
moralists where to head in have a noble purpose.
But if they expect a crushing victory, they are due
for a disappointment. The best we can do is carry
on guerilla warfare, and try to convince parents
that their daughter can look out for herself. In the
meantime we will have to think up a convincing rea
son why trying a new tango does not give the devil a
first mortgage on our souls,

first mortgage on our souls,
—John Cobbs
MAN TIIE LIFEBOATS
A CCORDING to reports from various colleges, this
is going to be one of those years when moralists
move in on the universities and try to establish a com
pulsory R.O.T.C. for the army of righteousness. In
Oklahoma, a pastor is launching a major offensive
against the powers of darkness, seeking a "moral re
birth." Over at Oxford, the students are planning to
demonstrate something new in assault and battery on
the next man who mentions "sex" or "orgy."
At Stanford, militant supporters of sanctimonious
ness have already given evidence of throwing their
weight about. Early in the year, the health service
had to give a hasty explanation of the nude (oh,
nasty word) photographs which are used to correct
posture defects in women students.
♦ * * *
There are also indications that opposition to the
iron-clad moralists is surging about in the Stanford
breast. The University rulings on liquor have under
gone bitter assaults almost from the first day the
school opened. It is not hard to discover bitter enemies
of (he lockout system and its pessimistic philosophy.
The other day a letter came in to the editor protest
ing fiercely against the double riveted dancing con
ventions that make the "big apple" definitely out of
bounds at Stanford.
I tlooks as though there is going to be quite a
battle between the moralists and the "moralless" not
only at Stanford but all over the country. But
prophets and history students report that the moralists
will win on the first putsch. The reason is that the
majority of our colleges are co-educational. And no
co-educational university dares stick out its tongue
at the prudes.
* * * » »
r I"'HE parents of masculine students are not particu
larly upset when some reformer begins to shout of
corruption, sex, and the wages of sin. They credit
their boys wtih enough intelligence to behave them
selves. But at the first bluenose assault on a co-educa
tional college, girls' parents spring into action like
a horse-opera hero. There is frantic talk of "reputa
tion." Protesting telegrams pour in on deans and
trustees. From a hundred homes there rises the
chorus, "My God. My daughter!" The moralists win
on a freeze-out, and nobody benefits but Western
Union.
No university that depends on women students to
keep it afloat can afford to ignore the blasts of the
sanctimonious. Rigid convention and continual ex
planation are the price we pay for co-education.
* * * *
Those liberal souls who arc determined to tell the
moralists where to head in have a noble purpose.
But if they expect a crushing victory, they are due
for a disappointment. The best we can do is carry
on guerilla warfare, and try to convince parents
that their daughter can look out for herself. In the
meantime we will have to think up a convincing rea
son why trying a new tango does not give the devil a
first mortgage on our souls,
