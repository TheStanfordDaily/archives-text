In a news story in tlie Idaho Bengal a few days
ago, the Reverend Paul De F. Mortimore expresses
some rather enlightening views concerning danc-
Lng.
His conclusions would seem to imply that it
will soon be Emily Post to ask, "May I have the
next debate with you?"â€” The Editor.

\ RGUING that the modern ball room dance has been
a strong contributing factor in the lowering of
moral standards, and that students have lost their ini
tiative to provide other entertainment, the Reverend
Paul De F. Mortimore of the First Christian Church
advocates the abolition of student dances and the sub
stitution of some other kind of entertainment. Mr.
Mortimore's views on the subject were first brought
to light at the discussion held at the L.D.S. Institute
last Sunday evening.
Among his chief arguments against dancing is the
fact that the position of the couple while dancing is
suggestive and that it stimulates the sexual instincts
to such an extent that the danger of moral looseness
is considerably increased. Mortimore maintains that
dancing has also been a decided factor in the death of
intelligent conversation and that the development of
something similar to debating would be very superior
to the present excess of dancing.
He further maintains that dancing is a direct re
version to the primitive dances and is based solely on
rhythm. "According to history," stated Mr. Mortimore,
"whenever a civilization has become lax in its moral
regulations and indulges in an excess of such prac
tices as dancing, it has been in the last period of the
civilization." For this reason he actually believes that
the modern dance is a strong contributing factor in the
tearing down of modern civilization.
Mr. Mortimore continued his discussion with the
argument that the softness of modern life has led to
a flabbiness in character that leaves the way open for
moral looseness. Certain standards that have been
set for moral conduct are rapidly being torn down,
and while ball room dancing is not the only factor,
since it is the chief recreation of people it must be one
of '".e major reasons. While the majority of the people
are not led from the paths of righteousness by danc
ing, the majority should conform to the minority in
this case and protect those that have not the strength
to withstand the possible suggestiveness of dancing.
The Reverend Mortimore concluded his arguments
by stating that dancing tends to promote excess drink
ing. When a crowd of young people are congregated
under such abnormal ocnditions, the will to refuse a
drink is considerably broken down. "Modern young
people are afraid to say no," stated Mr. Mortimore,
"when they are offered a drink, and the combination
of drinking and dancing have lowered the level of
thinking among the younger generation."
