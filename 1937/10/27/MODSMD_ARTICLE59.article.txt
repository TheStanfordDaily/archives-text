# Hemingway's Novel Shows Violent Lives
## 
### 
"TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT," by
Ernest Hemingway.
Hemingway is chiefly interested
in people and the things that poor
mortals will do to try to justify their
existence on this globe.
This is a story with two classes of
men in it. The "conch," the na
tive indigents of Key West, and the

nouveau rich of
New York and
Hollywood, too
sensitive for met
ropolitan life,
who drift down to
the manana-land
to loaf, drink, and
have a good time.
They're fast liv
ers — with alter
nate periods of

happiness and remorse.
Although one-half of the charac
ter's of the book are wealthy and
the other half are poor, they are all
the same deep down in their hearts.
Hemingway paints them all as with
out souls—without an ideal or faith
to make them live for the higher
things of life. Instead they tend to
be tough, dissolute, and highly in
dividualistic. Their main interests in
life are deep-sea fishing, brawling,
drink and women. Their course of
life is aimless and all are possessed
with a great interest in women.
The hero, if he may be called that,
is one Harry Morgan, a headstrong
conch who runs a boat for a living,
supporting his wife and kids with
the profits. He is a good man, prob
ably the cleanest and most Christian
character in the book, but he too
dies a violent death, voicing as his
last words the Gertrude Steinistic:
"A man ain't got no hasn't got any
can't really isn't any way out." In
other words, figure it out for your
self.
Hemingway, in his usual literary
style, has a violent set of characters
leading a lusty and sinful life, none
caring about the others and all
shuffling along on their course of
life. When there's nothing more ex
citing to do, some even go deep-sea
fishing.
