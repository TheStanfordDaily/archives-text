## JORGI: TO THE FRONT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the inevitable reply to John
Cobbs' interesting monograph of
yesterday, I must confess I have
misplaced my syllabus on the cause
of war. If Stanford's Pierian Spring
of eternal wisdom and detached ob
servation would care to go deeply
into the subject, I'm afraid he'd bet
ter take the course. I've offered two
extensive dissertations already, and
have not succeeded in giving him
any of that education he is so pas
sionately devoted to.
The Bull Sessioner has gone home
and asked his Muzzey, only to find
out that the Spanish-American War
and the World War were both
caused by "incidents."
He doubtless considers that the
killing of Japanese citizens started
the Manchurian penetration of '31
and the present friendship seminar
in China. Similarly, the killing of
Italian citizens must have started
Mussolini's civilization of Ethiopia.
Mr. Cobbs thinks that "incidents"
cause wars and that he can stop
wars by stopping "incidents."
This is undoubtedly a beautiful
philosophy, and will undoubtedly
cause him much peace of mind in
the future.
