The Editor, Sir:
Isn't it about time something was
done about the style of dancing at
Stanford? At Stanford dances any
step faster or trickier than the one

two-three of Mrs. Pettybone's danc
ing school is taboo, regardless of the
tempo of the music.
Swing music is written for swing
or collegiate dancing. During a
swing number look out on the floor
and you will see as many different
rhythms as there are couples. It
gets pretty monotonous to dance the
same way all the time; you might
as well get out and walk.
I'm not advocating abolishment of
the tradition of smooth dancing—but
there is a solution that fits in beau
tifully with the present nitery cam
paign. There are plenty of students
at Stanford who would like to "truck
on down" if it wouldn't be too con
spicuous, so why not inaugurate one,
or a series of jolly-ups at the nitery
where swing's the thing?
It would provide a positive at
traction for the lads who want to
get back in shape and also might
infuse a little new life into the very
worthy jolly-up system.
