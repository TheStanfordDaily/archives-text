### 
SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Oct. 27 (UP). —Japan's mighty Asiatic war
machine, moving fast over crumbling Chinese lines, smashed through to
the heart of Shanghai's defense early today and was reported to have
occupied the beleaguered and strategic North Station.
Shortly after 7:30 a.m. a huge Japanese flag was hoisted over the
Shanghai-Nanking administration building adjoining the station.

Foreign military observers said the
shell-torn station, target of almost
continuous bombardment during the
70 days of fighting in Shanghai, had
definitely fallen into the hands of the
Japanese.
Occupation of the station would
mean that the Japanese, picking up
momentum on their terrific thrust
through Tazang to the Shanghai-
Nanking Railway, which cut the
Chinese defense lines yesterday,
have driven through to the core of
Chinese defense lines in Chapei.
Escape Cut Off
The area, within a few blocks of
the northwestern barricades protect
ing the International Settlement, ad
joins the American defense zone.
Foreign observei's feared that if
pressure becomes too intense and
the 70,000 entrapped Chinese troops
find escape cut off west of Soochow
Creek, bordering the settlement,
they may fiee through the foreign
zone.
They would have to smash through
lines of American Marines, charged
with defending that section of the
foreign zone against any attack,
either by Chinese or Japanese.
