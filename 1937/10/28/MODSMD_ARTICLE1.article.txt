Historical Tragedy
"Murder in the Cathedral," a his
torical tragedy by T. S. Eliot, por
trays the return of Thomas a Backet,
Archbishop of Canterbury during
the reign of Henry 11, to England
after being exiled for seven years.
Four symbolic tempters appear be
fore him and present four courses
of action from which he must choose.
He can return to his former posi
tion and the king will make him
chancellor; he can return to the fold
of the church, attending only to his
ecclesiastical duties; he can work as
an active supporter of the king; he
can assume the power and influ
ence of his former position, fight the
king and public opinion.
Only One Course
Feeling that he conscientiously
can follow no course but the last,
Becket feels a sense of impending
death. He is willing to be a martyr
for the sake of his principles. Op
position to his policies grows until
Henry II orders his death.
Four of the king's henchmen at
tack Becket in the cathedral at the
climax of the drama and kill him
after a violent struggle. The play
closes with the murderers explain
ing the motives to the audience.
Musical Contrast
In direct contrast, "Trial by Jury"
is a fun-packed farce with lively
music by Gilbert and Sullivan. An
gelena, the plaintiff, is suing for
breach of promise; the defendant fell
in love with someone else the day
before the scheduled wedding. The
unfortunate young man has no
chance of success because Angelena
has won over both judge and jury
with her beauty.
To settle the case the defendant
agrees to marry both girls. The law
yer declares that bigamy cannot be
tolerated, and the judge suggests that
they get the defendant drunk and
find out whom he really loves.
Jury Objects
The jury raises objections to this
plan, so the judge settles the whole
matter by marrying Angelena him
self.

trays the return of Thomas a Backet,
Archbishop of Canterbury during
the reign of Henry 11, to England
after being exiled for seven years.
Four symbolic tempters appear be
fore him and present four courses
of action from which he must choose.
He can return to his former posi
tion and the king will make him
chancellor; he can return to the fold
of the church, attending only to his
ecclesiastical duties; he can work as
an active supporter of the king; he
can assume the power and influ
ence of his former position, fight the
king and public opinion.
Only One Course
Feeling that he conscientiously
can follow no course but the last,
Becket feels a sense of impending
death. He is willing to be a martyr
for the sake of his principles. Op
position to his policies grows until
Henry II orders his death.
Four of the king's henchmen at
tack Becket in the cathedral at the
climax of the drama and kill him
after a violent struggle. The play
closes with the murderers explain
ing the motives to the audience.
Musical Contrast
In direct contrast, "Trial by Jury"
is a fun-packed farce with lively
music by Gilbert and Sullivan. An
gelena, the plaintiff, is suing for
breach of promise; the defendant fell
in love with someone else the day
before the scheduled wedding. The
unfortunate young man has no
chance of success because Angelena
has won over both judge and jury
with her beauty.
To settle the case the defendant
agrees to marry both girls. The law
yer declares that bigamy cannot be
tolerated, and the judge suggests that
they get the defendant drunk and
find out whom he really loves.
Jury Objects
The jury raises objections to this
plan, so the judge settles the whole
matter by marrying Angelena him
self.
