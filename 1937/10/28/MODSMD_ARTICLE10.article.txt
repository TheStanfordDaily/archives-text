# â€˜Aviators' Meet Encina Sponsor
## 
### 
Six frosh were playing avia
tor in their third floor Encina
room. Setting large paper air
planes on fire and sailing them
down into the bull pen, they
bombed them with waterbags.
A friendly stranger entered
the room. They showed him
their new game.
Said the stranger as he left:
"It was a pleasure to meet you
fellows. I'll see you tomorrow
night at sponsors' meeting. By
the way, I'm your third floor
sponsor."
