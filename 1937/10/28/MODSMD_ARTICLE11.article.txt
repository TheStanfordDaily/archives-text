# War Movie To Be Shown Sunday Night
## 
### 
It's off again, on again with the
Memorial Hall movies, but barring
acts of God, Sunday night will see
"All Quiet on the Western Front"
in the new theater.
Difficutlies which caused last
night's cancellation of the program
have been smoothed over by Bill
Hovey and his movie committee, and
plans will go through as originally
formulated. The performance will
be at 7 o'clock, the admission price
20 cents.
The program will be completed by
the showing of Walt Disney's
"Steamboat Willie," old-time classic
of animated cartoons, scenes from
A1 Jolson's "Jazz Singer," and a
news brief, with George Bernard
Shaw as film commentator.
It is expected that movies will be
shown every other Sunday night
throughout the quarter. The com
mittee which is working with Hovey
includes Howard Pine, Des Mac
tavish, Harold Craigin, and Irv
Cummings. They were granted run
ning expenses by Ex Committee
last night.
