# Deadlock Halts Labor Meeting
## Week Recess Called In C.I.O.-A.F.L. Parley 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP). â€”
Peace delegates of 7,300,000 organ
ized American workers reached
deadlock today in efforts to reunite
the American Federation of Labor
and the Committee for Industrial
Organization.
They recessed their historic peace
conference for one week.
Alternate peace proposals, reject
ed by both factions, will be consid
ered during the interim and new ef
forts to end labor's two-year civil
war will be begun at resumption of
the conference November 4.
Three-Day Parley
Three days of conference in a hotel
suite almost within sight of the
White House brought to a stalemate
the two groups of negotiators with
whom rested organized labor's hope
for a united front.
The collapse came in the face of
unofficial Administration efforts to
keep both sides at a conference table
until their differences were concil
iated.
Two Proposals
James F. Dewey, federal concilia
tor from the Department of Labor,
arrived at the conference room a
few minutes before the recess, ap
parently seeking to prevent the
deadlock.
The divergent proposals, under
which the two warring factions out
lined conditions under which they
would be willing to reunite, proved
mutually unacceptable during the
tense conference.
