### 
SHANGHAI (Thursday), Oct. 28 (UP). —United States marines, all
but engulfed in the roaring battle between Chinese and Japanese around
the Anglo-American area of Shanghai's International Settlement, today
were prepared to slfoot to kill the hostile forces of either side if their
positions are menaced.
Admiral Harry Yarnell, commander of the United States Asiatic fleet,

issued an order saying: i
"In case of an attack with bombs
or machine guns or by airplanes of
any nationality on defense forces or
noncombatants in the second marine
brigade sector, the commander in
chief authorizes these forces to open
fire in self-defense."
Foreigners in Danger
Fear for the lives of foreigners
mounted as Japanese troops poured
through the streets of Shanghai,
spreading frenzy among thousands
of refugees and Chinese soldiers as
they cleaned up the Chinese rear
guard with machine guns, bayonets
and dynamite, and burned out snip
ing nests.
Trapped in the flaming ruins of
the Chapei section, caught in the
most fearful holocaust the Far East
has known, panic-stricken mobs
were seeking to enter the compara
tive safety of the International Set
tlement. They were pressed on
three sides by the Japanese. On
the other side was the settlement,
guarded by the marines and by
British and other foreign troops.
Chinese Air Raid
Chinese planes raided the Yang
tzepoo sector of the city, dropping
incendiary bombs and starting new
fires.
These added to the long wall of
flame which extended from the
west in Chapei to a point east
along the Yangtze river.
Along tho Yangtze Japanese war
ships added to the terrific din by
vigorously replying to shelling of
Japanese positions at Pootung.
Bayonet Encounters
Across Soochow Creek from the
United States marine sector of the
International Settlement defense
line Japanese shock troops coldly
bayoneted the stolid Chinese rear
guards who had elected to remain
and die so that their main army could
retreat in orderly manner to the
new Chiang Kai-shek defense west
of the city.
At the marine and British in
fantry barricades frenzied men,
women, and children civilians, and
pain-maddened Chinese soldiers,
blood oozing through fingers they
clutched over gaping wounds, fought
for admission to the comparative
safety of the International Settle
ment.

safety of the International Settle
ment.
SHANGHAI (Thursday), Oct. 28 (UP). —United States marines, all
but engulfed in the roaring battle between Chinese and Japanese around
the Anglo-American area of Shanghai's International Settlement, today
were prepared to slfoot to kill the hostile forces of either side if their
positions are menaced.
Admiral Harry Yarnell, commander of the United States Asiatic fleet,

issued an order saying: i
"In case of an attack with bombs
or machine guns or by airplanes of
any nationality on defense forces or
noncombatants in the second marine
brigade sector, the commander in
chief authorizes these forces to open
fire in self-defense."
Foreigners in Danger
Fear for the lives of foreigners
mounted as Japanese troops poured
through the streets of Shanghai,
spreading frenzy among thousands
of refugees and Chinese soldiers as
they cleaned up the Chinese rear
guard with machine guns, bayonets
and dynamite, and burned out snip
ing nests.
Trapped in the flaming ruins of
the Chapei section, caught in the
most fearful holocaust the Far East
has known, panic-stricken mobs
were seeking to enter the compara
tive safety of the International Set
tlement. They were pressed on
three sides by the Japanese. On
the other side was the settlement,
guarded by the marines and by
British and other foreign troops.
Chinese Air Raid
Chinese planes raided the Yang
tzepoo sector of the city, dropping
incendiary bombs and starting new
fires.
These added to the long wall of
flame which extended from the
west in Chapei to a point east
along the Yangtze river.
Along tho Yangtze Japanese war
ships added to the terrific din by
vigorously replying to shelling of
Japanese positions at Pootung.
Bayonet Encounters
Across Soochow Creek from the
United States marine sector of the
International Settlement defense
line Japanese shock troops coldly
bayoneted the stolid Chinese rear
guards who had elected to remain
and die so that their main army could
retreat in orderly manner to the
new Chiang Kai-shek defense west
of the city.
At the marine and British in
fantry barricades frenzied men,
women, and children civilians, and
pain-maddened Chinese soldiers,
blood oozing through fingers they
clutched over gaping wounds, fought
for admission to the comparative
safety of the International Settle
ment.
