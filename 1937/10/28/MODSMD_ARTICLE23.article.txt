BERKELEY, Oct. 27 (U.R).â€”-A trail
of thread led police to the Univer
sity of California campus today in
their search for the person or per
sons responsible for periodic thefts
of an "apartment for rent" sign from
a Berkeley building for several
months.
The apartment house manager tied
the thread to the sign and hitched
the other end to a spool at his bed.
The rattling spool awakened him in
time to get the license number of an
automobile fleeing from the front of
the apartment. The number was that
of a California student.
