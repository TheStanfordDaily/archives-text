# Wilbur Speaks On Foundation At Lunch Club
## Aim of Group Cited As Intellectual Approach To Universal Peace 
### 
In stating the purpose and method
of the World Foundation, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, at Luncheon
Club yesterday, pointed out two ap
proaches to a universal understand
ing, one is emotional and the other
is intellectual.
Using the latter technique, the
World Foundation is attempting to
unite the world through such serv
ices as the postal and health. When
the postal service was first con
ceived, President Wilbur stated, it
was believed an idealistic plan be
cause each nation was too interested
in its own affairs to aid others. Now,
however, by overstepping petty po
litical and territorial limitations, a
letter can transverse the globe and
go directly to its destination.
Will Take Years
In just such a safe, sane way the
World Foundation Group hopes to
reach its objective. Wilbur believes
the ultimate plan will take years,
but unless something of this nature
is attempted or "If all the university
of the world cannot catch some vi
sion of a broad understanding, we
will always have chaos and vio
lence."
As a part of the peace picture,
President Wilbur said, "The League
of Nations failed when the United
States failed to enter and when no
enforcements by force, if necessary,
of the League's rulings was made
possible." But such enforcement by
violence could only have been tem
porary, Wilbur believes, and a
broader, more permanent view, such
as the World Foundation's, is the
only final solution.
Three Groups
At present, there are three World
Foundation groups. One is in Lon
don, one in New York, and one is
here at Stanford. President Wilbur
was one of the two Americans to
originate this unique peace move
ment.
