# REPLACING RUINED SCHOOL
## 
### 

REMEMBER THAT disaster at New London, Texas, last March when a gas explosion blew up the con
solidated school and more than *>00 children lost their lives? New London folks are trying to erase memo
ries of the tragedy and here they are rebuilding the school. Classes are held temporarily in frame buildings
nearby.
