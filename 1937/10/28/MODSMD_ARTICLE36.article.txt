When John Haffner made a speech before Speakers Bureau last quar
ter stating that the Great Pyramid was not necessarily huilt by the
Egyptians, he didn't quite disturb the bureau's whole way of thinking,
but he gave them an interesting idea with which to juggle.
Early archeologists, exploring the pyramids, noticed that one line of
the Great Pyramid pointed very definitely to the heavens. They theorized

that it had originally pointed to the«
North Star. Noticing the position
that star held in the heavens at the
time of the explorations, they calcu
lated how long it had takeh to move
the distance it had. The time they
fixed was 4000 years. Therefore
they said that the Great Pyramid had
been built by the Pharaoh Chaeops
to hold his body when he died.
Perhaps Older
But later explorers pointed out
that the North Star could easily
have made a complete revolution of
the heavens from the time of the
construction to modern times.
Therefore, it might have been built
27,000 years ago instead of 4000.
If the Great Pyramid is 27,000
years old, it quite obviously could
n't have been erected by the Egyp
tians and had to be built by an
earlier race. Another thing that
marks it off from the other Egyptian
pyramids is that it has none of those
mummies, chests of gold and jew
elry, etc., that are so characteristic
of them.
Only Oriented Pyramid
And it is the only pyramid which
is very definitely oriented to the
four points of the compaSs, which

points to the fact that it very pos
sibly has some significance other
than being a final resting place of
a god-like Pharaoh.
There is a chest inside the pyramid
which has some very significant
measurements, too. At first it was
believed to have been the coffin for
the mummified Pharaoh, but later
authorities held that it wasn't the
right shape for a coffin.
Mathematically Planned
And they noticed that its length
divided by its height had the same
ratio as the length of the pyramid
divided by the diagonal of the base
—180 pi. Also, the inside volume of
the chest is exactly equal to the
volume of the. material it is made
of.
It has other more pertinent ra
tios, too. For instance, a certain defi
nite volume of water in the chest
measured at 16 degrees gives the
specific gravity of the earth.

man beings" in comparison to those
of 20 years ago, says Dr. J. M. Gwinn
of San Jose State.

that the North Star could easily
have made a complete revolution of
the heavens from the time of the
construction to modern times.
Therefore, it might have been built
27,000 years ago instead of 4000.
If the Great Pyramid is 27,000
years old, it quite obviously could
n't have been erected by the Egyp
tians and had to be built by an
earlier race. Another thing that
marks it off from the other Egyptian
pyramids is that it has none of those
mummies, chests of gold and jew
elry, etc., that are so characteristic
of them.
Only Oriented Pyramid
And it is the only pyramid which
is very definitely oriented to the
four points of the compaSs, which

points to the fact that it very pos
sibly has some significance other
than being a final resting place of
a god-like Pharaoh.
There is a chest inside the pyramid
which has some very significant
measurements, too. At first it was
believed to have been the coffin for
the mummified Pharaoh, but later
authorities held that it wasn't the
right shape for a coffin.
Mathematically Planned
And they noticed that its length
divided by its height had the same
ratio as the length of the pyramid
divided by the diagonal of the base
—180 pi. Also, the inside volume of
the chest is exactly equal to the
volume of the. material it is made
of.
It has other more pertinent ra
tios, too. For instance, a certain defi
nite volume of water in the chest
measured at 16 degrees gives the
specific gravity of the earth.

When John Haffner made a speech before Speakers Bureau last quar
ter stating that the Great Pyramid was not necessarily huilt by the
Egyptians, he didn't quite disturb the bureau's whole way of thinking,
but he gave them an interesting idea with which to juggle.
Early archeologists, exploring the pyramids, noticed that one line of
the Great Pyramid pointed very definitely to the heavens. They theorized

that it had originally pointed to the«
North Star. Noticing the position
that star held in the heavens at the
time of the explorations, they calcu
lated how long it had takeh to move
the distance it had. The time they
fixed was 4000 years. Therefore
they said that the Great Pyramid had
been built by the Pharaoh Chaeops
to hold his body when he died.
