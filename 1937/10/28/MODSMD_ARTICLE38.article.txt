POOR DON—AN AIR
TRIP COMING UP
Don Liebendorfer, director o
publicity for Farm athletic teams, i:
going to have to take a plane t<
New York before the Columbia
game to do a little Cardinal pub
licizing.
I)on has never been up in a
plane before and he doesn't ex
actly relish the idea of his first
trip through the atmosphere. Don
doesn't like traveling any too well
anyway, and Hying through the
air, well . . . that's just a little
too much.
But the Farm publicity demon wil
have plenty to do here right up tc
and including the day of the Bij
Game, and in order to be in New
York several days before the Stan
ford team arrives for its icy struggle
with Lou Little's Columbia Lions,
Don is going to have to board an
airliner for the trip east.
RUMOR STARTS
DON THINKING
An idle rumor has been floating
around the country after the recent
air crash epidemic, and said rumor
drifted into Don's office over in the
B.A.C.
The rumor has it that the va
rious airline companies in order
to cut clown expenses have or
dered their pilots to skini the tops
of the mountain ranges rather than
use the extra fuel to climb to a
higher altitude.
This little tale started the wheels
in Mr. Liebendorfer's head to work
ing overtime. After several hours of
deliberation Don came out of the
trance with a brilliant idea.
The night that the plane takes off
Don is going to the airport a few
minutes ahead of time with a 10-
gallon can of gas under each arm
and shove them into the pilots' com
partment. His line will go some
thing like this: "Listen, boys, I want
to get to New York in one piece, so
here's something to help you over
those darn mountains."
If that isn't enough, Don is going
to have them stop at a gas station
and fill up on him.
DINK NEARLY FALLS
OFF TRACK PERCH
Out at the track yesterday Jimmy
Kneubuhl donned a suit and stepped
to his starting mark in the 100-yard
dash. Dink Templeton and Bill El
lington were waiting at the finish
line with stop watches.
The bark of the gun, and dark
skinned Jimmy was off down the
track. The groans and grunts emit
ting from the Samoan flash as he
came down the straightaway could
be heard over in Encina Gym. He
ran in anything but a straight line,
and he finished like a plow horse
going up a steep hill. But when
Dink looked at his timepiece he al
most toppled off his air-cushion seat
on top of the judge's stand ... it
read 9.8 seconds. Bill's watch stop
ped at 9.9.
The two Indian track mentors
arc considering two proposals.
Number one—throw both watches
away. Number two—wrap Jimmy
up in cellophane and keep him un
til spring.
