# Indian Gridders To Face Mid-Season Crisis
## Farm, O.S.C. Squads Tied In 2nd Spot Heavy, Speedy Beavers Ley by Passer Gray, Line-plunger Kolberg 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Saturday's game will tell the tale.
The minor crisis of the 1937 Coast
Conference will be met when the
Stanford Indians and the Oregon
State Beavers clash here this week
end. Tied for second place, the two
teams will fight it out to decide
which will have a chance for a first
place tie with the Golden Bears,
who can be expected to continue
their winning streak.
Defensively, the Beavers will of
fer the Cards the same trouble that
held them to 32 yards against the
Huskies at Seattle last week—a uni
formly heavy line.
O.S.C. Passing Good
On the offense, the Oregon State
boys will show the Indians one of
the finest passing performances they
have confronted this year. Joe Gray,
at left half for the Beavers, is one
of the coolest and best passers on
the Coast, while Bill Duncan, quar
terback, and Joef Wendlick, at right
end, are two of the West's best re
ceivers.
When the Beavers are not making
an aerial attack, Elmer Kolberg will

be their biggest threat. He is an
excellent plunger and a very power
ful runner. On defense he will not
only be outstanding line-backer for
the Northerners, but he will cause
Indian pass - receivers considerable
trouble.
Kicking Contest
As in nearly all this season's con
tests, kicking will probably play an
important part Saturday. Stanford
has a distinct edge over Oregon State
in this respect, and if Bill Paulman
can withstand as much playing as
he did against Washington, the Reds
will undoubtedly take advantage of
their superior booting ability.
Paulman is still not ready to take
part in the major part of a game. His
shoulder received a hard blow last
Saturday that may keep him on the
bench again except when a field goal
or conversion is to be attempted.
The quiet blond quarterback has
been practicing field goals all week
and has chalked up a good record.
Rasmussen Out
Neil Rasmussen's ankle is still
bothering him; so he will not be used
Saturday. Coach Tiny Thornhill
would rather give him another week
to recover for the University of
Southern California tilt a week later.
A1 Alustiza will again start at
quarterback for Paulman, and Bill
Willard will get the call at left end.
Louie Tsoutsouvas will start at cen
ter if Stanford receives the kick-off,
while Tony Calvelli will be pivot
man if the Cards begin on the de
fense. The rest of the regular line
up will remain intact.
Stanford gridders have had their
hardest workouts of the season this
week and will continue to practice
fundamentals today and tomorrow.
They had their only scrimmage yes
terday.

would rather give him another week
to recover for the University of
Southern California tilt a week later.
A1 Alustiza will again start at
quarterback for Paulman, and Bill
Willard will get the call at left end.
Louie Tsoutsouvas will start at cen
ter if Stanford receives the kick-off,
while Tony Calvelli will be pivot
man if the Cards begin on the de
fense. The rest of the regular line
up will remain intact.
Stanford gridders have had their
hardest workouts of the season this
week and will continue to practice
fundamentals today and tomorrow.
They had their only scrimmage yes

Saturday's game will tell the tale.
The minor crisis of the 1937 Coast
Conference will be met when the
Stanford Indians and the Oregon
State Beavers clash here this week
end. Tied for second place, the two
teams will fight it out to decide
which will have a chance for a first
place tie with the Golden Bears,
who can be expected to continue
their winning streak.
Defensively, the Beavers will of
fer the Cards the same trouble that
held them to 32 yards against the
Huskies at Seattle last week—a uni
formly heavy line.
O.S.C. Passing Good
On the offense, the Oregon State
boys will show the Indians one of
the finest passing performances they
have confronted this year. Joe Gray,
at left half for the Beavers, is one
of the coolest and best passers on
the Coast, while Bill Duncan, quar
terback, and Joef Wendlick, at right
end, are two of the West's best re
ceivers.
When the Beavers are not making
an aerial attack, Elmer Kolberg will

be their biggest threat. He is an
excellent plunger and a very power
ful runner. On defense he will not
only be outstanding line-backer for
the Northerners, but he will cause
Indian pass - receivers considerable
trouble.
Kicking Contest
As in nearly all this season's con
tests, kicking will probably play an
important part Saturday. Stanford
has a distinct edge over Oregon State
in this respect, and if Bill Paulman
can withstand as much playing as
he did against Washington, the Reds
will undoubtedly take advantage of
their superior booting ability.
Paulman is still not ready to take
part in the major part of a game. His
shoulder received a hard blow last
Saturday that may keep him on the
bench again except when a field goal
or conversion is to be attempted.
The quiet blond quarterback has
been practicing field goals all week
and has chalked up a good record.
Rasmussen Out
Neil Rasmussen's ankle is still
bothering him; so he will not be used
Saturday. Coach Tiny Thornhill
would rather give him another week
to recover for the University of
Southern California tilt a week later.
