# GRAYSON TURNS GRAY

Bobby Grayson, All-Aineri
can captain from Stanford's
"Vowing Sophs,'' recalled old
times yesterday when he played
the role of "Galloping Ghost"
Gray on a mock team that went
through Oregon State pass
plays against the Card regu
lars. His skillful passing was
reminiscent of those that sent
his team to the Rose Bowl three
years in succession.
