# Coach Seeking Strong Lineup
## Water Poloists Unable To Make Team Click 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton still is
switching his water polo men
around in an effort to hit upon a
combination that can offer both a
good defense and a tight offense.
Thornton found his best offensive
team against the Olympic Club in
their first meeting here. Bill Hanna
and Johnny Lamb at forward were
all that any coach could ask. They
set up five goals in that game. But
the defense was sloppy and the
Olympians made six.
Defense Good
Against U.S.C. Thornton found a
beautiful defensive bunch with
Lamb and Hanna at guard holding
the Trojans to two goals. As a re
sult of the switch, however, S.C.
held the Cards' inexperienced for
wards to one good shot.
Now Thornton declares he has at
last found the x'ight seven men who
will start a comeback against the
Olympic Club when they meet in
the city Friday at 8 o'clock.
Scoring Twins Split
He has split his scoring twins,
putting Lamb at forward and Hanna
at guard. Bob Plate technically
plays the sprint position but Hanna
will do the ball chasing from his
guard spot. Art Allen breaks into
the first-string line-up at forward,
where he teams with Rothschild,
who looked good against U.S.C. Dick
Hoover, sore eye and all, will be
back at guard, and Wilson will
probably start at goal.
The Stanford jayvee, who have
been somewhat more successful
from a victory standpoint than the
varsity, will take the long trip
seeking a second win from the
Olympic Reserves.
