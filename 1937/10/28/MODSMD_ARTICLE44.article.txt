# Papooses Set To Win Tough San Mateo Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh gridders come up against their fifth consecutive tough
team Saturday—and they're out to win.
San Mateo J. C.is bringing one of the biggest football teams in the
north region to the stadium Saturday to play the Papoose at 11:45 as
prologue to the Oregon State game.
They have a line as big and tough as the U.C.L.A. line and a halfback,
John Peters, who is rated as one of the best junior college triple threat

men playing this season.
But the frosh will be ready for
them. Coach Harry Shipkey is put
ting them through some pretty in
tensive practice this wfeek, working
on all departments connected with
kicking and polishing up their of
fense.
Team in Good Condition
The team is in probably the best
condition it has been all year. Bob
Olden, first-string half who has
been out since the Modesto game
with a pulled muscle, is in first rate
shape now and will be ready to add
substantial scoring punch to the
Papoose squad.
John Kerman is completely off of
the hospital list, too. While he
played part of the game against
U.C.L.A., he wasn't quite recovered
from the dislocated shoulder he suf
fered in the U.S.C. game. And Thor
Peterson, who played one of his
first games of the season last week,
is pretty well over his cold and
should be in top form to move in on
the San Mateo boys from his half
back spot Saturday.
One Cold in Squad
The nearest thing that Stanford
has to a crippled man this week, in

fact, is Swede Johansen, winner of
this week's Dentyne Gum Award, as
the outstanding frosh player against
U.C.L.A., who has a slight cold.
But the thing that the frosh play
ers have that makes it seem that
they will quite possibly knock the
San Mateo boys over is not their
good physical condition.
It is their spirit. They have the
same spirit they had last week
against U.C.L.A. They're out to beat
San Mateo this week, and Cal next
week. They may do it.

should be in top form to move in on
the San Mateo boys from his half
back spot Saturday.
One Cold in Squad
The nearest thing that Stanford
has to a crippled man this week, in

fact, is Swede Johansen, winner of
this week's Dentyne Gum Award, as
the outstanding frosh player against
U.C.L.A., who has a slight cold.
But the thing that the frosh play
ers have that makes it seem that
they will quite possibly knock the
San Mateo boys over is not their
good physical condition.
It is their spirit. They have the
same spirit they had last week
against U.C.L.A. They're out to beat
San Mateo this week, and Cal next
week. They may do it.
Stanford's frosh gridders come up against their fifth consecutive tough
team Saturday—and they're out to win.
San Mateo J. C.is bringing one of the biggest football teams in the
north region to the stadium Saturday to play the Papoose at 11:45 as
prologue to the Oregon State game.
They have a line as big and tough as the U.C.L.A. line and a halfback,
John Peters, who is rated as one of the best junior college triple threat

men playing this season.
But the frosh will be ready for
them. Coach Harry Shipkey is put
ting them through some pretty in
tensive practice this wfeek, working
on all departments connected with
kicking and polishing up their of
fense.
Team in Good Condition
The team is in probably the best
condition it has been all year. Bob
Olden, first-string half who has
been out since the Modesto game
with a pulled muscle, is in first rate
shape now and will be ready to add
substantial scoring punch to the
Papoose squad.
John Kerman is completely off of
the hospital list, too. While he
played part of the game against
U.C.L.A., he wasn't quite recovered
from the dislocated shoulder he suf
fered in the U.S.C. game. And Thor
Peterson, who played one of his
first games of the season last week,
is pretty well over his cold and
should be in top form to move in on
the San Mateo boys from his half
back spot Saturday.
