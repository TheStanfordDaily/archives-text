## One More for the Libe

OVER in another corner of this page, the
inimitable Jorgensen jabs his way through
twenty-three slugs of satire, in which he de
duces that we who yesterday chaffed him for
turning the sour note on what looked like a
beautiful "light, airy" campaign, are busy
laughing ourselves sick over the Sunday night
in the library proposal.
Jorgi almost hit the point of this edit.
No. we aren't laughing ourselves sick, Jorg,
because we didn't set out to make things "light
and airy" and it wasn't part of the approach.
We never intended to laugh our way up to
the libe doors and open them.
But we aren't sobbing ourselves to death,
either.
However, we are interested in the results
of the official library poll which is being con
ducted under the auspices of the A.S.S.U. and
the Stanford library today and tomorrow, be
cause the final settlement of this issue is going
to give us a lot more space to run Campus
Opinions.
The Daily is sincerely anxious to see this
matter settled. Since the first flurry when
Library Director Nathan Van Patten made a
rash statement, we have been accused of stop

ping at no ends to prove our point that the
library should be open on Sunday nights.
The following is a statement of fact.
The Daily's interest in the question is the
carrying out of the majority student wish. In
numerable and repetitive gripes have, in the
past, even stirred up "serious thinker" Jorgi,
and The Daily, in response to student request,
has attacked the problem.
It is not with a desire to open the libe on Sun
day nights at any costs, that The Daily has
backed the movement.
Rather it hopes to see ironed out a problem
which has become a problem because of its
frequent appearance on the Stanford scene.
The Daily does not mount its soap box today
and scream "Go to the polls and do your part
to win the cause."
It does stress that all Stanford individuals
who sincerely want the library open on Sunday
or who definitely don't want the library open
on Sunday, should write the epitaph to the
libe lament today and tomorrow.
If the outcome is representative and final,*
whether it be for or against Sunday opening,
even Jorg will rejoice.
And either way, The Daily won't run away
mad.

who sincerely want the library open on Sunday
or who definitely don't want the library open
on Sunday, should write the epitaph to the
libe lament today and tomorrow.
If the outcome is representative and final,*
whether it be for or against Sunday opening,
even Jorg will rejoice.
And either way, The Daily won't run away
mad.
OVER in another corner of this page, the
inimitable Jorgensen jabs his way through
twenty-three slugs of satire, in which he de
duces that we who yesterday chaffed him for
turning the sour note on what looked like a
beautiful "light, airy" campaign, are busy
laughing ourselves sick over the Sunday night
in the library proposal.
Jorgi almost hit the point of this edit.
No. we aren't laughing ourselves sick, Jorg,
because we didn't set out to make things "light
and airy" and it wasn't part of the approach.
We never intended to laugh our way up to
the libe doors and open them.
But we aren't sobbing ourselves to death,
either.
However, we are interested in the results
of the official library poll which is being con
ducted under the auspices of the A.S.S.U. and
the Stanford library today and tomorrow, be
cause the final settlement of this issue is going
to give us a lot more space to run Campus
Opinions.
The Daily is sincerely anxious to see this
matter settled. Since the first flurry when
Library Director Nathan Van Patten made a
rash statement, we have been accused of stop

ping at no ends to prove our point that the
library should be open on Sunday nights.
The following is a statement of fact.
The Daily's interest in the question is the
carrying out of the majority student wish. In
numerable and repetitive gripes have, in the
past, even stirred up "serious thinker" Jorgi,
and The Daily, in response to student request,
has attacked the problem.
It is not with a desire to open the libe on Sun
day nights at any costs, that The Daily has
backed the movement.
Rather it hopes to see ironed out a problem
which has become a problem because of its
frequent appearance on the Stanford scene.
The Daily does not mount its soap box today
and scream "Go to the polls and do your part
to win the cause."
It does stress that all Stanford individuals
who sincerely want the library open on Sunday
or who definitely don't want the library open
on Sunday, should write the epitaph to the
libe lament today and tomorrow.
If the outcome is representative and final,*
whether it be for or against Sunday opening,
even Jorg will rejoice.
