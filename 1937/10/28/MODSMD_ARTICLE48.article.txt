# Pitt's "Ordered House"
## 
### 
AN "ordered house" in its athletic depart
ment by 1940 is the aim of the University
of Pittsburgh, according to a recent announce
ment from the University's director of athletics.
Because Pitt is not calling its house-cleaning
"de-emphasizing," is admitting that it gave "spe
cial grants" to football players, the announce
ment made a good story on the sports pages
over the country.
Pitt had been caught in a vicious circle of
competition for players that started when foot
ball began to boom again in the early '20's.
Stanford has been among colleges to feel the
same competitive pinch but has paid for all
athletic scholarships from private gifts. Pitt
seemingly was paying almost directly from
gate receipts.
Carnegie Foundation's report of a few years
ago exposed the condition to public gaze, and
a few institutions washed their dirty linen in
private, merely called it de-emphasizing.
But last spring Pitt was involved in an intra
mural warfare between coach and administra
tion and found its washing hung on a party line.
Wisely, the university decided that the best
way to haul it in was to admit that the laundress
had been there.
Pitt's was the courage of necessity, but at
least it may set a precedent for other college
officials with the same problem who don't know
where to start.â€”L. L.
