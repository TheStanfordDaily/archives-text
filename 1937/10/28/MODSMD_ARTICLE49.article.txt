HELL lIATII NO FURY
AS I pointed out yesterday, it looks as though sanc
timonious bluenoses are going to have a field day
with the univei'sities this year. All over the country
moralists are yammering about "licentiousness" and
"excess" in the colleges; and in these days when a
co-ed's good name is worth many fine telegrams to
the dean, there is nothing much we can do about it.
But an Idaho news story, reprinted in yesterday's
Daily, gives grounds for the bright hope that the re
formers may torpedo themselves.
It seems that a crusading clergyman has reached
Ihc conclusion that dancing is the cause of all the
evils which are dragging our generation down into the
pit. He says that the dance is the instrument of the
devil that keeps the papers full of birth announce
ments. He blames the dance for the booming sales of
bottled beverages, and curses it as the murderer of
conversation. And then after blaming dancing for the
fall of Rome, the decline of civilization, and probably
for the C.1.0. and Gertrude Stein, he offers, as a sub
stitute, debating.

This proclamation takes quite a few lines out of
the foreheads of students who have been wondering
when the righteous reformers would smite their col
lege. When bluenoses speak darkly of terrible things
down the highway, jittery parents are always ready to
lush to the telegraph office and make outraged noises
in 10 words. But when our censors come out from the
cloud of dark hints and admit that dancing is the worst
evil they can find, we may push off to the prom with
light heart. Parents danced too when they were in
college, and they haven't got the guest room ready for
the devil.
When reformers stick to veiled remarks and dire
prophesies, they can always get a response. One whis
per about "sex'' will put Western Union in a position
to declare an extra dividend. It will also put the deans
in a position to declare martial law.

£T is not specific charges that hurt a university. We
know that there will always be the "stinking one
per cent" that has only one aim in life, to defy all the
law and the prophets at once. We know how to handle
that one per cent; representatives of it pack their
bags and vanish every quarter. Moralists can find
nothing alarming in them.
It is the obscure, muddled charges of "sex" or
drunkenness" that force universities to treat their
students like feeble-minded delinquents.
* # * *
And so when the reformers leave their protective
fog of sanctimoniousness, we can uncross our fingers
and relax our set jaws. If dancing is the worst thing
bluenoses can find to attack, we can leave for the
prom without worrying. The good clergyman says
we 11 go to hell for it, but then the good clergyman's
idea of a perfect society sounds amazingly like the
college man's idea of hell.
