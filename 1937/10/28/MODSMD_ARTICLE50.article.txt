# Oil for Troubled McDonnell
## 
### 
MR. McDONNELL is the saddest man on the
Stanford campus. For weeks, the story
goes, he has been trying to get equipment down
from San Francisco to repair the spot on Palm
Drive which was mentioned in last Friday's edit.
He figured the edit was coming.
By the middle of the week Mr. McDonnell
received assurance that the equipment would
be available.
But, ironically, early Friday morning the edit,
which had kicked around the office for better
than a week, finally got into print. Monday
morning the equipment, on Palm Drive on time,
was ready to go.
The Daily will take credit for the fastest edi
torial service yet delivered.
And Mr. McDonnell is the saddest man on the
Stanford campus.
