CINGING at the top of his voice, "I'd rather be Rose
than President," that mighty end product in the
"Variety" tradition, Billy Rose, will advance buckety
buckety on San Francisco with his "Show of Shows."
The opening date has been set for November 21, at
the Curran, and will probably go down in history as a
second earthquake, if Mr. Rose's advance notices can
be trusted.
The "Show of Shows" is a combination of brother
Billy's most opulent and recent entertainment catas
trophes, bringing features from his "Casa Manana"
and "Pioneer Palace" whirligigs of the Fort Worth
Centennial. Also in the melee will be something from
his Cleveland Aquacade. Just how this "goliath of
entertainment," as he modestly describes it, will be
fitted into the Curran will be as interesting as the
production itself. We are particularly worried about
that Aquacade number. Perhaps we had better plan
to wear our overshoes that night.
But anyhow, it will tide us over to springtime
and Barnum and Bailey's hurdy-gurdy goulash.

In looking over the San Francisco dramatic schedule
for this winter, and doing some heavy mathematical
calculations on our fingers, we have come to the de
lightful conclusion that the road is back.
As you all have heard, "You Can't Take It With
You," Kaufman's Pulitzer Prize play, will show in the
city soon, as well as Claire Boothe's "The Women."
And the traveling company of "Yes My Darling
Daughter" ought to arrive about the first of next
year.
Maurice Evans will be out next spring, with Shake
speare on the bill of fare. This probably isn't all, but
at the present moment we can't remember all the rest
of the program that got us excited. Anyhow, we won't
be spending all this winter keeping up with the
dramatic Joneses through the medium of "Stage" and
"Variety."

This last week of repertory of Noel Coward's "To
night at 8:30" has been extended to run to Novem
ber 6. As was done this week, the plays will be
scrambled in various combinations.
An audience poll taken a couple of weeks ago
showed that "The Astonished Heart" was considered
to be the best of the nine. "Fumed Oak" and "Hands
Across the Sea" were about tied for second place if
I remember correctly.
Chief surprise was the fact that "Shadow Play"
rated very high. The audience reaction to this play
was probably the most varied, ranging from a firm be
lief that Coward was just trying to make fools of
the public by meaningless hocus-pocus to the opinion
that it was as subtle a bit of sophistication as you
can find anywhere. Well, take your pick. We frankly
felt that his stage tricks, which didn't come off too
well, muddled his ideas more than was worth. But
we did like the girl who did the dancing the night
we were there.

felt that his stage tricks, which didn't come off too
well, muddled his ideas more than was worth. But
we did like the girl who did the dancing the night
we were there.
CINGING at the top of his voice, "I'd rather be Rose
than President," that mighty end product in the
"Variety" tradition, Billy Rose, will advance buckety
buckety on San Francisco with his "Show of Shows."
The opening date has been set for November 21, at
the Curran, and will probably go down in history as a
second earthquake, if Mr. Rose's advance notices can
be trusted.
The "Show of Shows" is a combination of brother
Billy's most opulent and recent entertainment catas
trophes, bringing features from his "Casa Manana"
and "Pioneer Palace" whirligigs of the Fort Worth
Centennial. Also in the melee will be something from
his Cleveland Aquacade. Just how this "goliath of
entertainment," as he modestly describes it, will be
fitted into the Curran will be as interesting as the
production itself. We are particularly worried about
that Aquacade number. Perhaps we had better plan
to wear our overshoes that night.
But anyhow, it will tide us over to springtime
and Barnum and Bailey's hurdy-gurdy goulash.

In looking over the San Francisco dramatic schedule
for this winter, and doing some heavy mathematical
calculations on our fingers, we have come to the de
lightful conclusion that the road is back.
As you all have heard, "You Can't Take It With
You," Kaufman's Pulitzer Prize play, will show in the
city soon, as well as Claire Boothe's "The Women."
And the traveling company of "Yes My Darling
Daughter" ought to arrive about the first of next
year.
Maurice Evans will be out next spring, with Shake
speare on the bill of fare. This probably isn't all, but
at the present moment we can't remember all the rest
of the program that got us excited. Anyhow, we won't
be spending all this winter keeping up with the
dramatic Joneses through the medium of "Stage" and
"Variety."

This last week of repertory of Noel Coward's "To
night at 8:30" has been extended to run to Novem
ber 6. As was done this week, the plays will be
scrambled in various combinations.
An audience poll taken a couple of weeks ago
showed that "The Astonished Heart" was considered
to be the best of the nine. "Fumed Oak" and "Hands
Across the Sea" were about tied for second place if
I remember correctly.
Chief surprise was the fact that "Shadow Play"
rated very high. The audience reaction to this play
was probably the most varied, ranging from a firm be
lief that Coward was just trying to make fools of
the public by meaningless hocus-pocus to the opinion
that it was as subtle a bit of sophistication as you
can find anywhere. Well, take your pick. We frankly
