## DEATH TO ROMANCE 
### 
Dear Gordy:
I'm happy to see that we serious
thinkers are handing you "laughing
boys" of the edit staff so many
chuckles. I realize that you are now
busy laughing yourself sick over
such things as school spirit and the
Sunday night in the library cam
paign.
Since you seem to base the suc
cess or failure of "good causes" on
the ability to snort and gurgle, how
ever, I wish to make our position
clear.
Hopkins and I left Ex Committee
with a serious look on our faces.
We realized that what we had seen
was obviously a comedy and farce
on student government. The only
reason we didn't reel from the â€¢room
laughing and slapping our thighs
was due to the fact that it wouldn't
have been polite.
Jorgi
