# AN AMERICAN REPLIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
My congratulations, Mr. Editor,
for your fine stand on this Spanish
Communist committee that has been
formed at the University. You are
absolutely right when you say that
such a movement must be laughed
at. Be ever watchful, however. All
red-blooded Americans should ridi
cule such "movements" as this Irvin
Jorgensen's committee and Jose
Rodriguez's cell. It is up to you,
however, as an American college
editor, to point out the danger in
such subversive groups. And I can
see that you do recognize this
danger.
In my previous judgment of Mr.
John Cobbs, I can see now I was
mistaken. Ingeniously he has de
feated the efforts of a small group
of radical students and professors to
link the name of Stanford Univer
sity with that of the Communists in
Spain who say they are fighting for
democracy.
Lauds Franco
He sees now that I was l-ight when
I said that General Franco is at last
bringing order into a country that
has been through the chaos of vi
sionary socialist control for the last
few years.
The "Ex Committee" should also
be complimented. We hard-headed
business men can see the wisdom of
turning down requests for student
support of a cause that is utterly
foreign to democratic principles, al
though it has slyly embodied the
word "democracy" in its title.
Probe Jorgi
Your work does not end here, Mr.
Editor. You must investigate such
persons as this Jorgensen. I know
it is hard for a fair-minded Amer
ican boy to work against a school
fellow, but you must keep up this
fine thing you have begun. Is Jor
gensen an American citizen? Per
sonally, I wouldn't be surprised to
find him in the same class with
people like Harry Bridges.
I am glad to see that college stu
dents are beginning to take the lead
in suppressing the Red Radicalism
that has been growing recently in
many universities. As a business
man, I am glad to see that it isn't
yet necessary for the more mature
citizens to take the drastic steps
that the Spanish people have taken
to keep their government from ruin

at the hands of impractical Com
munists. Sincerely,
An American

Jorgensen's committee and Jose
Rodriguez's cell. It is up to you,
however, as an American college
editor, to point out the danger in
such subversive groups. And I can
see that you do recognize this
danger.
In my previous judgment of Mr.
John Cobbs, I can see now I was
mistaken. Ingeniously he has de
feated the efforts of a small group
of radical students and professors to
link the name of Stanford Univer
sity with that of the Communists in
Spain who say they are fighting for
democracy.
Lauds Franco
He sees now that I was l-ight when
I said that General Franco is at last
bringing order into a country that
has been through the chaos of vi
sionary socialist control for the last
few years.
The "Ex Committee" should also
be complimented. We hard-headed
business men can see the wisdom of
turning down requests for student
support of a cause that is utterly
foreign to democratic principles, al
though it has slyly embodied the
word "democracy" in its title.
Probe Jorgi
Your work does not end here, Mr.
Editor. You must investigate such
persons as this Jorgensen. I know
it is hard for a fair-minded Amer
ican boy to work against a school
fellow, but you must keep up this
fine thing you have begun. Is Jor
gensen an American citizen? Per
sonally, I wouldn't be surprised to
find him in the same class with
people like Harry Bridges.
I am glad to see that college stu
dents are beginning to take the lead
in suppressing the Red Radicalism
that has been growing recently in
many universities. As a business
man, I am glad to see that it isn't
yet necessary for the more mature
citizens to take the drastic steps
that the Spanish people have taken
to keep their government from ruin

at the hands of impractical Com
munists. Sincerely,
An American
The Editor, Sir:
My congratulations, Mr. Editor,
for your fine stand on this Spanish
Communist committee that has been
formed at the University. You are
absolutely right when you say that
such a movement must be laughed
at. Be ever watchful, however. All
red-blooded Americans should ridi
cule such "movements" as this Irvin
Jorgensen's committee and Jose
Rodriguez's cell. It is up to you,
however, as an American college
editor, to point out the danger in
such subversive groups. And I can
see that you do recognize this
