The Editor, Sir:
Since the article about the Class
of '41 not ringing the fire alarm, it
has been going incessantly, causing
much annoyance in the hall for the
many who do not indulge in this
pastime.
Hoping that in the future you will
not corrupt the morals of our class,
I remain,
Yours truly,
A. F., '41
