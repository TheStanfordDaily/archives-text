# LITTLE WHITE LINES
## 
### 
An Open Letter to Mr. Trowbridge:
Dear Mr. Trowbridge:
What would you think of the idea
of having white lines painted across
the roads here and there at a few
vital points around the Quad, mak
ing crossings for pedestrians except
for an open season of perhaps 30
days or soâ€”say, between Thanks
giving and Christmas?
Yours,
V-8 Sportsman
