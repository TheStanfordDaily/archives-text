# Dunne Film Toss-Up In Plot, Singing
## 
### 
"lIIGII, WIDE, AND HANDSOME"
(at the Fox Stanford)
For lovers of the old-time West
ern melodrama in its highest form,
"High, Wide, and Handsome" will
provide excellent entertainment.
There is little plot, but what there
is is fast and furious. The acting and
singing are not what should be ex-

pected from two
such top-notchers
as Irene Dunne
and Randolph
Scott. In disre
gard of the fact
that Miss Dunne
is given top bill
ing, one receives
the impression
that Mr. Scott is
the whole show.
The plot (so
called) concerns
the oil rush in
western Pennsyl-

vania. The usual crook (this time
the railroad owners) and the honest
farmers battle it out throughout the
picture for the rights on their oil
land. The whole show is filled with
exciting battles between the two
factions.
Irene Dunne's warbling is certain
ly not up to par in this perform
ance. One felt that Dorothy Lamour
far outsang the featured songbird.
The music, on the other hand, was
quite pleasing. Whether or not the
reader would like the show would
be up to individual taste.
