Commenting on the sale of 3300
rooters tickets for the Big Game, A1
Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, issued a
warning to students today.
Masters said, "We are glad to
know that we shall have the larg
est rooting section in Big Game his
tory. However, because of the large
sale, I believe that students should
be reminded that rooters tickets are
not transferable and cannot be used
by anyone other than the original
purchaser. We .plan on checking
rooters tickets on the day of the
game to be sure that they are used
legitimately."
