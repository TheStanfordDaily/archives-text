# Undergrads Vote 438-47 Favoring New Libe Hours
## Graduate Ballot Is Split; Only Seven Faculty Go to Polls 
### BILL MILLIS 
Four hundred and thirty-eight undergraduate students voted yesterday
in favor of opening the Stanford Library regularly on Sunday nights, and
<17 cast "no" ballots on the proposed revision of libe hours.
This result was announced late last night by A.S.S.U. Election Board
Chairman Dick Riddcll, after election officials had completed tabulating

the results of the first day of
special student body election.
The polls will be open at 10 o'clock
this morning in the main foyer of the
library for the second and final day
of the election, and will continue
open until 12 o'clock. This after
noon voting will take place from 1
to 6 o'clock and the final hours of
voting are from 7 to 9 o'clock to
night.
On the basis of yesterday's re
sults, undergraduate students favor
the change in library hours by a
proportion of more than 9 to 1.
Seventy-one undergraduates were
"uncertain" as to whether they
would require the use of the library
on Sunday evenings.
Grads Divided
Graduate students appear to be
almost evenly divided on the main
question on the ballot, which reads:
"Does your university work require
access to the University Library on
Sunday evening?" The vote was
"Yes," 33; "No," 26; "Uncertain," 0.
However, faculty interest in the
library hours appears to be slight,
since on ylseven faculty ballots were
cast yesterday, with the result:
"Yes," 1; "No," 5; "Uncertain," 1.
'Who Cares'
One facully member commented
on the bai'lot: 'Who cares? The li
brary is open 33 hours a week any
way."
The ballots also asked which li
brary department the student would
use on Sunday nights, with the fol
lowing "yes" results: reserve book
room, 464; main reading room, 362;
and loan desk, 275.
"No" ballots cast on the depart
mental preference question were:
reserve book room, 74; main read
ing room, 68; loan desk, 127.
Report to Wilbur
Complete results of the election
will be used as basis for an A.S.S.U.
report, probably to be drafted by
John Dern, which will be presented
to President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
the near future.
Final decision on the question of
the proposed revision of library
hours will then be determined by
Dr. Wilbur and the University
Board of Trustees.
