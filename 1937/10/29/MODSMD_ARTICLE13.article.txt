# Clyde McCoy Set To Play For Cotillion
## 
### 
"The Real McCoy" will play at
the Sophomore Cotillion Friday, No
| vember 12, in the dance studio of the
| Women's Gym.
Clyde McCoy and his orchestra
' will be the only big name band to
appear on the campus this quartei'.
This explains the big ''Real McCoy"
sign hanging over the Row that has
been mystifying the campus this
week.
First Name Band
The Cotillion' has been reformed
this year, according to Don Berger,
president of the class of '40. This is
the first time that a "name" band
has been presented at the sophomore
dance, and the price of the bids has
been drastically reduced from for
mer years, and it will be semi
formal.
Price for the affair is $2.50 a
couple; bids are on sale at the A.S.
S.U. office and will be sold in all
living groups shortly.
I Only one big name orchestra is
j allowed at campus dances each
! quarter by a ruling passed last
! spring, and Ex Committee has
| granted the sponsorship of it to the
sophomore class. Student Manager
j Chuck Fontius okayed contracts for
I the Cotillion in the Palo Alto Hos
j pital just before he was operated on
I for appendicitis.
Women Vocalists
McCoy has just finished a highly
successful engagement at the famous
Palomar in Los Angeles. Three
women vocalists are included in his
line-up of variety entertainment,
j The number of bids is limited, ac-
to the dance committee, and
students are urged to buy them
early.
Members of the Sophomore Co
tillion committee include Dick Daley
j and Sally Holt, co-chairmen; Ken
Cuthbertson, ticket sales; Larry Liv
i ingston .publicity; Frank Burbeck,
j decorations; and Audis Davis and
j Jack Rice.
The red and white "McCoy" sign
I is the work of Glen Munkelt.
