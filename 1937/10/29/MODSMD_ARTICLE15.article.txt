# Varsity Gridmen To Battle Oregon State Tomorrow
## Paulman on Starting Line-up Despite Injuries to Shoulder 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
| Stanford's varsity gridders are ready for Oregon State College, a
1 tougher team than any they have met so far. KitkolT will be at 2:U<>
j o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Bill Paulman has partially recovered from a dislocated shoulder, sus
tained in the U.C.L.A. game three weeks ago, and reinju red last Saturday
in the Washington tilt. Coach Tiny Thornhill announced yesterday that

fcPaulman will probably be on the
starting lineup for the Cards, but will
be relieved a great part of the game
by A1 Alustiza and Gene Coldiron.
Zagar Recovers
Pete Zagar ha.s finally regained his
full weight after several weeks' ill
ness, and will reach his old peak by
Saturday. The burly tackle had not
worn a suit for ten days before last
week's game, but he has worked out
daily this week and scrimmaged
once.
Neil Rasmussen is the only regu
lar who will not play against the
Beavexs. His sprained ankle is in
I good shape again, but Rasty will be
saved for the U.S.C. game the fol
lowing week. Bill Willard will again
start on the left flank.
Beavers Arrive Touay
The Beavers will arrive today in
San Francisco, where they will stay
tonight and tomorrow night. It is
likely that they will practice this
afternoon in the Stanford Stadium.
Tied for second place in the Pa
cific Coast Conference, both teams
will be out to bring home the bacon,
and the final outcome could very
easily be the result of Bill Paulman's
kicking against Joe Gray's passing.
