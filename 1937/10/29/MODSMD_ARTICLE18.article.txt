# Franco To Blockade Spanish Eastern Coast
## 
### 
GIBRALTAR, Oct. 28 (UP). —
Generalissimo Francisco Franco an
nounced today, coincident with as
surances to Great Britain and France
that there are no Italians or Ger
mans in his insurgent navy, that he
will blockade the entire Spanish
east coast with warships and air
planes.
Vice-admiral Francesco Moreno,
chief of the insurgent war fleet, ar
rived at Palma de Majorca in the
Spanish Balearic Islands and or
ganized the "starvation blockade"
that will be strung along 650 miles
of coast from the Franco-Spanish
frontier to Almeria.
The blockade was ordered almost
at the same moment that the Span
ish Loyalists announced that their
capital would be moved Saturday
from Valencia to Barcelona.
Vice-admiral Moreno took over
command of both the land, sea and
air forces on the island of Majorca
—base of all insurgent naval and air
operations in the Mediterranean.
It was indicated that the entire
insurgent fleet would be massed off
the Qalearics to enforce the naval

blockade.
The Loyalists' only important war
vessel lies half-submerged at Car
tagena following a mysterious ex
plosion last June.
Britain's mightiest warship has
been dispatched from Gibraltar to
Palma—supposedly in a gesture to
check Italy's supposed domination of
the island.
LONE CHINESE FLAG
SYMBOL OF HEROISM
SHANGHAI, Friday, Oct. 29 (TJP).
A lone Chinese flag fluttered at
dawn today high over shell-torn
Chapei, the heart of China's ruined
metropolis, as proof that a '"doomed
battalion" of Chinese soldiers was
still there in the roaring hell of
bombs, bullets and shrapnel.
China, figuratively, watched
that flag. It has become a symbol
of China's heroic resolution to ac
cept annihilation rather than Japa
nese conquest.
High above the earth the air be
comes so thin that sound waves can
not travel.
