# New Evidence Suggests Atlantis Built Pyramid
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
From the time that archaeologists
came out with the theory that the
Great Pyramid was quite possibly
built by the people of Atlantis, and
not by the Egyptians, they have been
the objects of a storm of criticism.
People said that the fact that many
very significant relations between
parts of the pyramid hud been dis
covered proved nothing. They were
just coincidences, such as can be
found in anything so symmetrically
constructed.
They didn't say why they hadn't
found any of these "coincidences" in
the other pyramids.
But the authorities who hold with
the Atlantis theory say that these
ratios are far too frequent and ac
curate in relation to the things
around us to be accidental. They
think that the Atlantans, feeling
that their civilization was possibly
degenerating or fearing something
like the cataclysm that wiped them
out, built the Great Pyramid in order
that future civilizations would have
some evidence of the cultural height
ihey reached.
It has been constructed on the
safest part of the earth. As far as
geologists can tell, there never has
been an earthquake in that spot. Be
fore the Turks tunneled into it, it

was covered with a bright porcelain
which shone for miles.
It is quite possible, those who hold
the Atlantis theory say, that the
civilization that built it was far su
perior to ours, that we haven't yet
reached a point where we can com
pletely understand the significance
of the Great Pyramid.
But the scoffers have another ar
gument besides their criticism that
any .significant observations are just
the result of remarkable coinci
dences. They say that the idea of
there being an Atlantean civilization
is preposterous.
But there is a reply to that argu
ment, too. The chest in the pyra
mid, which certain explorers have
found so useful in measuring vari
ous weights on volumes of things in
our universe, is made of a material
that has been found in but one spot
on earth.
Several years ago, when the At
lantic cable was being put in, a
piece of it was broken off. In ti'ying
to retrieve it, a piece of rock was
brought up from the ocean at the
place where Atlantis was supposed
to be. This rock was exactly like
that which was used in constructing
the chest in the Great Pyramid.
Right now the subject of the Great

Pyramid is taking an rather wide
spread interest. The Los Angeles
library, for instance, has three books
in circulation on the subject, all of
which are reserved eight months in
advance. John HafTner, who is usinij

this us a subject for a specch before
the Speakers' Bureau next quarter,
got most of his information from
the very rare book "The Great Pyr
amid Gizeh," published by the Ma
sons.
