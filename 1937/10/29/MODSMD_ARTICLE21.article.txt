# Mussolini Gives World Warning

ROME, Oct. 28 (UP). — Premier
Benito Mussolini's warning to the
world at a gigantic Fascist celebra
tion, that there can be no durable
peace in Europe until Germany's
war - lost colonies are restored,
aroused fresh speculation tonight
over the next thrust of the Rome-
Berlin axis.
Diplomats professed to see be
hind II Duce's words the signal for
a new Italo-German campaign
aimed at Britain and France. II

Duce looked out on 700,000 black
shirts assembled from all Italy for
Fascism's 15th birthday as he gave
his warning.
Return of Germany's colonies in
north-central Africa — at a time
when Mussolini and Fuehrer Adolf
Hitler have forced an almost uncon
ditional surrender of the other pow
ers in the Spanish crisis — would
mean a Nazi-Fascist encirclement of
strategic British and French colonial
possessions, diplomats asserted.
