# CAMPUS OPINION
## THIS IS MY LAST AFFAIR 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I don't like this country anyhow.
It is shot full of holes. It is too full
of wide open spaces. One more year
and we'll have the Revolution.
Then I pan come back and be Com
missariat of Freedom Suppression.
We will prevent not only freedom
of thought, but thought itself. And
boy will we crack down on the
Soph Cotillion.
But until that time I can't stand
it over here. This country has too
many people eating regularly. Ev
erybody laughs too much and has
just the best time. These condi
tions upset me terribly, make rne
emotionally unstable, and set me to
writing Campus Opinions. I'm
leaving this country and going back
to Salinas, where I came from.
