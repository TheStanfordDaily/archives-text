# COMES THE REVOLUTION

The Editor, Sir:
Aside from the fact that sending
medical aid to to the "loyalists" is
a sentimental effort to bolster a
cause already wallowing in its own
gore â€” you weak-kneed, trembling
hypocrites certainly hand me a
laugh, too scared to form even an
opinion and have ideas about any
thing but football, and truckin' in
the Nitery.
It is precisely that old-maidish
cowardice that is going to crush you
and the "ideals" you stand for (if
you can be said to have the guts to
stand for anything).
By all means do nothing to ward
off that glorious day when your lack
of union and courage will see you
crushed by a new philosophy.
A Fascist (and what of it?)
