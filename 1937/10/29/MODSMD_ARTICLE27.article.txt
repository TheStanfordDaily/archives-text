# TO MAKE THE WORLD

The Editor, Sir:
Hail to the Great God Impartial
ity! Long let us sing her praises!
For once again Stanford's Ex Com
mittee has taken refuge behind the
barricades of its own backyard, and
is shouting that the barrier has not
the normal two sides. All that mat
ters is Stanford â€” and keeping her
skirts clean.
Can it be that there is, on the
other side of the barricades, the big,
bad world? God forbid! No! No!
"Let it fight its own wars. Let it
have its political battles. Let people
starve. Let labor organize. Let
"furriners" agitate. Let it all go to
hell for all we care," says Stanford's
Ex Committee. "For, if we inter
fere, we have lost our position on
the fence. We might even be roused
from our comfortable beds by the
shock."
Fight for a Cause
Are there no things for which
you will sacrifice your impartial
ity? Are not liberty, freedom, de
mocracy, human welfare bigger than
academic impartiality? Once Amer
ica fought for them. Today we re
vere "furriners" such as Lafayette
who joined us in that fight. In 1917
we all went forth with less cause
in their name. Today Spain is fight
ing for them, for her life. She asks
not warriors but doctors, nurses,
bandages, medicine. A few Stanford
people responding to this call of
common humanity were chastened
by Ex Committee, and refused even
the sanction to raise funds by a
dance to care for the wounded and
dying.
Has this segment of America
known as Stanford, which once re
sponded so well to her country's
call, become so insensitive that sanc
tion is now forbidden for efforts to
come to the aid of the suffering?
And yet Jorgi is chided by the
editor of this Daily for taking the

proposition too seriously. Nice game
it was he suggested, fun, something
new, no nasty money solicitation.
And now he gets serious. For shame,
Jorgi! Let the fool Spaniards die! Is
it any of your business? They're
probably Communists and Fascists,
anyway. Come back inside Stan
ford's ivory towex's and sing with
Stanford's Ex Committee. "Hail the
Great God Impartiality!"
One who is partial
and human
