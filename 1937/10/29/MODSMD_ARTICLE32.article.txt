WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (U.R).â€”
Administration officials, heartened
by the stock market's favorable re
action to federally revised mai'gin
regulations, tonight found the bus
iness outlook more encouraging also
because of bullish reports on farm
income and foreign trade.
The day's operations of the New
York Stock Exchange tended to buoy
hopes that the relaxation of re
si riction on margin purchases and
the new 50 per cent margin on
"short" sales would bring firmness
to a market which had caused wide
business concern.
