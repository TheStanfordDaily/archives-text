CARDS OUTPLAYED BY
HUSKIES ALL RIGHT
Those of us who saw the flickers
of the Washington-Stanford football
game in the Nitery last night came
away shaking our heads and won
dering how the old Indian came off
the turf with a victory.
The Huskies ripped through the
Stanford line time and again for
huge gains. The Indian attack was
getting nowhere. Stanford's tack
ling was way below par . .. the
boys were missing their shots all
over the field.
Once the Husky safety man
caught Jim Groves' punt aiid ac
tually brushed up against ten
Card would-be tacklers before the
lentil man brought him down.
Those Huskies looked good . . .
good enough to give Cal a little
trouble despite their loss to Tiny's
warriors. They're plenty fast for
such big brutes.
PAGING—ONE GOOD
BEAR TRAPPER
Can the Bears be stopped this
year? This is the question brewing
in Bay Region sports circles. Cal
has a great team this year but other
great teams have toppled ' before
them and this Bear outfit may fol
low suit before the season is over.
Even Cal's wonder team in the
days of the great Andy Smith
were held to a scoreless tie by
Washington and Jefferson. Pop
Warner's team of 1!)28 here at
Stanford was one of the best the
coast has ever seen but an in
ferior U.S.C. outfit trimmed it.
Boners down near the goal line
after repeated drives into enemy
territory cost the Redskins that
game. They should have won by
a tremendous score but lost 10-0.
Bill Leiser and Will Connolly of the
San Francisco Chronicle explained
their respective views on California's
weaknesses the other day. Said
Bill, "The Bears have so far shown
only one weakness. They quit bear
ing down after they cross the goal
line. They can be sotpped in the
end zone!"
THE BEARS CAN BE
STOPPED, BUT TOO LATE
Will comes through with, "The
Bears don't look so hot running out
of the tunnel. Maybe somebody can
stop them there. The only place the
Bears are strong is from goal line
to goal line."
Enuf said . . . but the Bears
may slip yet. I see where Stub
Allison is continuing to make the
front pages by his continual
moaning on how bad Cal really
is. He admitted the other day that
he would go to the Rose Bowl but
only as a spectator. "I wonder
who's going to play?" queried Mr.
Allison. Just his way of being fun
ny, I suppose.
Tiny Christianson, alias Pete the
Halfback, 425-pound gridder won
by Tiny Thornhill in the nation
wide coaches' moan contest, has
disappeared from the campus. He
showed up Tuesday and disappeared
soon afterwards with the comment
that he would be around in time for
the game with Oregon State Satur
day afternoon.
TINY'S LETTER IS
A MOANING GEM
Thornhill's second place letter in
the contest is really a gem, and in
the opinion of many is far 1 better
than the literary masterpiece that
won first place for Marty Peters,
coach of St. Benedict's in Kansas.
Here are snapshots from Tiny's let
ter:
"Left End — Soaking wet and
with a 16-pound shot in each hand
he weighs only 148. He has a very
bad case of hangnails which are
so unsightly he doesn't dare put
his hands up in the air to catch a
forward pass in front of all those
people.
"Center — Father a prominent
alumnus. The boy was only two
months old when he stood on his
head in bed and looked back be
tween his legs. His lather decided
then and there that the boy would
be a center. The son is quite cross
eyed, and last Saturday he passed to
the referee twice and the opposing
safety man once.
"Quarterback and captain — He
isn t much of a blocker and can't
run very fast. Neither can he kick,
pass, or tackle. Lisps badly and the
boys practically never come out of
the huddle with the same idea as
to the play to be called."
it goes on like that indefinitely.
