# Indian Soccer Squad Faces Major Clash
## San Jose Game Today May Decide Standing 
### 
Stanford's eventual standing in the
California intercollegiate soccer race
will hinge heavily on the showing
which the men make tomorrow when
they play San Jose State at 10 o'clock
on the Indian field.
Though the immediate outcome of
the championship is not at stake in
tomorrow's contest, the season still
being in its infancy, the game will
determine whether Coach Harry
Maloney has finally struck a scoring
combination in his forward line. If
the goal-producing part of the at
tack does not show improvement
over the two previous contests, Car
dinal hopes are slim. If the front line
can come through, Maloney looks
forward to a successful season, as his
defense has been turning in good
performances.
After working all week on of
fensive tactics, Maloney shifted his
men into new positions and expects
an improvement. The team was dealt
a stilf blow when Bill Hamilton was
taken to the hospital with appendi
citis symptoms, but he will be ca
pably replaced at fullback by Dick
Hanna.
Maloney announced the following
starting lineup: Faulb, goalie; Han
na, fullback; Cuthbertson, fullback;
Hutch, halfback; Sloane, halfback;
Knox, halfback; de Benedetti, out
side right; Schaupp, inside right;
Sadullah, forward; Gudewill, inside
left; Parker, outside left.
