# Easy Wins Predicted In Conference Games
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
'Tis indeed a pity iliut those seemingly unbeatable Bears from Boo
erkeley have to be in this conference. It'd sure be a swell race otherwise,
'cause everyone else is tied up tighter than Big Game celebrants —no team
more than half a percentage game away from the next.
We might as well start with Cal, and get them out of the way, so that
we can get to the conference teams. Stub's bruisers play the Bruins—a

very weak and meek Bruin squad—<
in what will be merely a repeat per
formance of every Bear game to
date.
U.C.L.A. vs. Cal—Massacre
U.C.L.A. still has Kenny Wash
ington. But Mr. Washington stands
alone —he has no help. And Cal has
an eleven-man team. Eleven vs. one
usually means massacre. It will in
this case, too.
Then there is the case of U.S.C.
and Washington State. Troy's team
used to have something that made
sportscribblers pick them to win.
And every once in a while W.S.C.
looks sorta good.
Amby Schindler seems to be the
deciding factor of this battle. If
he's hot, the Trojans will amble
through to an easy win. If he isn't,
well—flip a coin.
Washington vs. Idaho
Washington, last year's Coast
champions, should take Idaho right
in their stride. Then again, they
were supposed to win last week, if
statistics meant anything.
We're still looking for that sopho
more backfield to get hot and smash
opponents all over the lot, with
Waskowitz' heaving passes, and
Cruver and Johnston smashing the
line for big gains. Maybe they will
some day.
Santa Clara, in Chicago for the
Marquette game, looks for a fairly
easy game. Wisconsin and Michigan
State have both whipped Marquette
very severely, and the Broncs, un
beaten to date, will take a two
touchdown win.
St. Mary's, fully recovered from
their recent attack of' fumble-itis,
have formed definite plans to gal
lop all over College of Pacific. But
if they can't hang onto the pigskin,
the game will be much closer than
the Moragans expect. That's the de
ciding factor.

We were all set to pick Loyola
over XJ.S.F. Then it develops that
five Lions get themselves kicked
out of school for some reason or
other, completely disrupting the
football team. That's a fine thing
to do. Anyhoo, the game will go to
the Dons by one score.
Other games to watch closely are
the Yale-Dartmouth tussle, which
brings together two undefeated
teams; Columbia-Cornell, Chicago-
Ohio State, Colgate-N.Y.U., Har
vard-Princeton, and Minnesota-No
tre Dame.

formance of every Bear game to
date.
U.C.L.A. vs. Cal—Massacre
U.C.L.A. still has Kenny Wash
ington. But Mr. Washington stands
alone —he has no help. And Cal has
an eleven-man team. Eleven vs. one
usually means massacre. It will in
this case, too.
Then there is the case of U.S.C.
and Washington State. Troy's team
used to have something that made
sportscribblers pick them to win.
And every once in a while W.S.C.
looks sorta good.
Amby Schindler seems to be the
deciding factor of this battle. If
he's hot, the Trojans will amble
through to an easy win. If he isn't,
well—flip a coin.
Washington vs. Idaho
Washington, last year's Coast
champions, should take Idaho right
in their stride. Then again, they
were supposed to win last week, if
statistics meant anything.
We're still looking for that sopho
more backfield to get hot and smash
opponents all over the lot, with
Waskowitz' heaving passes, and
Cruver and Johnston smashing the
line for big gains. Maybe they will
some day.
Santa Clara, in Chicago for the
Marquette game, looks for a fairly
easy game. Wisconsin and Michigan
State have both whipped Marquette
very severely, and the Broncs, un
beaten to date, will take a two
touchdown win.
St. Mary's, fully recovered from
their recent attack of' fumble-itis,
have formed definite plans to gal
lop all over College of Pacific. But
if they can't hang onto the pigskin,
the game will be much closer than
the Moragans expect. That's the de
ciding factor.

We were all set to pick Loyola
over XJ.S.F. Then it develops that
five Lions get themselves kicked
out of school for some reason or
other, completely disrupting the
football team. That's a fine thing
to do. Anyhoo, the game will go to
the Dons by one score.
Other games to watch closely are
the Yale-Dartmouth tussle, which
brings together two undefeated
teams; Columbia-Cornell, Chicago-
Ohio State, Colgate-N.Y.U., Har
vard-Princeton, and Minnesota-No
tre Dame.
'Tis indeed a pity iliut those seemingly unbeatable Bears from Boo
erkeley have to be in this conference. It'd sure be a swell race otherwise,
'cause everyone else is tied up tighter than Big Game celebrants —no team
more than half a percentage game away from the next.
We might as well start with Cal, and get them out of the way, so that
we can get to the conference teams. Stub's bruisers play the Bruins—a

very weak and meek Bruin squad—<
in what will be merely a repeat per
formance of every Bear game to
date.
