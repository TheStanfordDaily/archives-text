# Hallowe'en Theme Of Lagunita Dance
## 
### 
In keeping with the Hallowe'en
theme, programs for Lagunita's
dance tonight are enclosed in a
black mask cover. Witches, broom
sticks, and pumpkins will decorate
the court and combine with shady
lighting to give a spooky atmos
phere.
Carvel Craig's orchestra will play
from 9 to 1 o'clock. Supper will be
served from 11 to 12 o'clock instead
of 11:30 to 12:30, as announced in
yesterday's Daily.
