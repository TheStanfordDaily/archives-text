# Farm Horsemen Meet San Mateo
## 
### 
Card horsemen will ride out on
the highway field here this after
noon at 3 o'clock to meet the power
ful San Mateo Polo Club team. While
the Cards defeated the Peninsula
club two weeks ago, 6-4, there is
no basis of comparison as they are
meeting a different squad tomorrow.
The team the Indians are meeting
today will probably be composed of
Captain George Pope (3), Peter Mc-
Bean (1), Bill Gilmore (2), and
jFrank Fuller (4). This is one of the
strongest groups of horsemen in this
region with an eight-goal rating.
The Farm line-up will be Captain
Jim Fullerton (1), Don MeAusland
(2), Bob Wallace (3), and Bert Mc
'Clintock (4).
