## SPORTS EDITOR—GENE GEAR Papoose Team Set for Grid Tilt Saturday 'Mystery Team' To Try Fast Aerial Attack 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Over Greys' Field yesterday after
noon the air was so filled with foot
balls that the .sun was entirely hid
den. The frosh pigskinners were
getting ready for San Mateo J.C.
Ignoring lessons learned from their
geometry teachers and taking a les
son from the birds, the Papooses
have decided that a straight line
may be the shortest distance between
two points, but it's not the quickest.
An arched line through the air is.
Frosh Are Enigmas
San Mateo is bringing a team as
big and tough as U.S.C. Trobabes to
the Stadium Saturday to do battle
with the frosh at 11:45, and the
young Cards are aiming to be well
prepared for the neighborhood boys.
Woodie Adams, frosh line-coach,
not inappropriately dubbed the frosh
the "mystery team" yesterday. No
one knows what they're going to do
when they trot out on the field each
week.
Spirit Will Win
They lose the ones they're sup
posed to win and win the games
they're picked to lose. Technically
they're moving in against a superior
team Saturday and on paper they
should lose. But if the "mystery
team" can go out on the Stadium
field this week with as much spirit
as they showed last week, they
should win.
The San Mateo boys have as big
a line as the much-talked-about
U.C.L.A. forward wall, and two ex
ceptional backs — triple - threater
John Peters and fast Ed Fitzpatrick.
All Answer Roll
With all their men off the injured
list for the first time this season, the
frosh will potentially be at their
strongest. Captain Norm Standlee
will start for the Papooses at full
with Thor Peterson and Bob Olden
probably opening at the half-back
spots, and Stan Graff at quarter.
Jim Farquharson and Arnold Mi
ners, who was "discovered" in the
U.C.L.A. game, will start at the ends.
Tackles will be Bill Braheny and
Swede Johansen; line-captain Chick
Orme and John Kerman, fully re
covered from his dislocated shoul
der, will be at the guard positions.
Tough little Jake Thompson will be
playing center.
Season Nears End
The game, which comes immedi
ately before the varsity - Oregon
State game, will be the next to last
chance Farm spectators will have to
see the '41 gridders in action. Next
week they wind up their season with
the Little Big Game against the
high-rated Cal Cubs.
