# Linesmen To Get Special Specs
## 
### 
Working on the theory that
you can't hit what you can't
see, Dr. Frederick E. Roth,
Stanford team physician, is or
dering a new pair of special
glasses for Pat Nowell, reserve
varsity guard.
Nowell has been wearing the
conventional football glasses
which have large leather cov
ers around them, this season.
But these new glasses will have
no covering over them and will
give him a much increased
range of vision.
They are built with a new
type of lense that comes di
rectly into contact with the
eye lens. Nowell will now wear
only a nose guard to cover his
face, and not a pair of horse
blinders.
