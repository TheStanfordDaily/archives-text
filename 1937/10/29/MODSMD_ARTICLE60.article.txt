## There Is a Football Game Tomorrow 
### 
STANFORD probably will lose a football
game to Oregon State tomorrow.
Apparently not a very pro-Stanford remark,
that statement is tendered more as a warning
than a crystal-ball prophecy after surveying a
string of circumstances that pile into a rather
sizeable reason why the ambitious Indian may
be negotiating for a steamroller repair job on
Monday.
Beaten only by Cal, the O.S.C. Beaver that
dropped Washington 6-3 is not coming to Palo
Alto to fiddle while the Indian rolls the clover
out of the Stadium turf. He's tied with Stanford
for the second-place spot and a win is more
important to him than Sunday night libe.
Meanwhile, the Contented Farm has slipped
into a football lethargy since the Washington
affair from which it probably won't be roused

until sometime Saturday night at the Biltmore
during U.S.C. party week-end at Los Angelesâ€”
unless O.S.C. snaps it back into consciousness
by elbowing the Indian out of the picture to
morrow.
The rally tommittee has lapsed into slumber
with the rest and has rationalized itself into a
quiet week of Pajamarino work and silent but
prayerful campaign for an O.S.C. victory. It has
decided against card stunts during the half.
Maybe Stanford will win anyway.
And with the odor of mid-quarters in,the air,
there are those who have decided that they had
better study Saturday, 'cause we'll beat this
easy team, won't we.
All of which seems to indicate that Stanford
doesn't seem to know it, but it will probably
lose to Oregon State tomorrow.
I hope this makes the ball club mad.
