# Goodwill Is a Debit

### 
BUSINESSMEN of Palo Alto, if the manage
ment of the Varsity Theater is typical, seem
to have come to a new realization of the old
maxim that "the customer (even if he is a Stan
ford student) is always right."
Many a business has been built up on that
thory, but it was forgotten last year in Paly
when frosh descended on the theater after the
Pajamarino rally. The management forgot dis
cretion and valorously barred the door. Stu
dents in pajamas couldn't even be customers.
This year, the olive branch comes to the cam
pus in the form of a blanket invitation to the
Class of '41 to make the Varsity theirs on the
night of the rally. The best first run show that
can be obtained is promised.
Next Thursday night the Frosh will parade
across the tracks and up the avenue to the the
ater. There they will find the welcome side of
the doormat up.
The Varsity probably will find its move re
sultant in many a black entry on the ledger.â€”
