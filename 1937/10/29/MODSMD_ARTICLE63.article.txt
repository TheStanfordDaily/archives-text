# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
YOU KEEP OUTA THIS
our dear pen pal, "An American," gave us a
return engagement yesterday, the campus reacted
with puzzled "What the hells" and irritated references
to sending for a straitjacket. The concensus of opin
ion seems to be that our "American" is all a gag, pos
sibly a lonely soph in Toyon, or a Row man who could
n't get a date and had to amuse himself some way.
But the letter shows such an amazing efficiency in
misinterpreting everything it mentions that somebody
has to plough in and try to clear up the situation.
In his masterpiece, American threw so many bou
quets that he must have a frightfully sore shoulder this
morning. And one of these catapulting corsages was
aimed at "Bull Session." I was told that I had "in
geniously . . - defeated the efforts of a small group of
radical students and professors to link the name of
Stanford University with that of the Communists in
Spain." First, I would like to return that bouquet with
all the outraged emphasis that the melodrama heroine
uses when she bounces the villain's diamonds. I don't
want it. And, thank God, I didn't earn it.
* # * *
Tlie point that "Bull Session" tried with discour
aging futility to pound home to Jorgi's committee had
nothing to do with communism, fascism, hell, or the
American Legion. I did not want to "defeat" any
thing; all I asked was that the committee consider for
a minute whether or not it was laying the basis for a
lot of future trouble.
That matter disposed of, I now point out to
"American" a fact he has ignored completely. There
is just as much chance that the awful communists are
right, as there is that he is on the inside track. In
deed, the very way in which American closes up his
mind like a box turtle to everything that doesn't bear
him out, indicates that he is quite probably oil the
track.
* * * *
OUT even if our Fascist pal is right, even if God Al
mighty had whispered the eternal Truth in his
ear, the communists would have just as much right as
he to say what they think. That is the philosophy of
American government. And if our correspondent does
n't like it, there's nothing he can do about it. Pos
sibly he could look up a good magician and get trans
migrated back to the divine right of kings era.
Any man who is not willing to let his opponents
say their piece is not an American. He is a holdover
from the days of the Inquisition.
* ♦ * *
The suggestion to deport Jorgi puts a beautiful cli
max on what would be a great comedy if it only had
a snappier line at the end. Jorgensen spent four years
at Stanford without poisoning the President's soup.
He has no Russian accent and he addresses people as
"Hey you," not as "Comrade."
Besides that, Jorgi writes a very entertaining let -
ter, and he does not insult his audience with decrepit
tags like "red radical," "red-blooded American," "hard
headed business men."
And so, with American's permission, I would like
to have Jorgi stick around a while longer. The Uni
versity is supposed to teach us, not cram us full of
platitudinous intolerance. There is a fair chance that
we can discuss the affairs of the world without bring
ing riot and revolution to the campus.

The suggestion to deport Jorgi puts a beautiful cli
max on what would be a great comedy if it only had
a snappier line at the end. Jorgensen spent four years
at Stanford without poisoning the President's soup.
He has no Russian accent and he addresses people as
"Hey you," not as "Comrade."
Besides that, Jorgi writes a very entertaining let -
ter, and he does not insult his audience with decrepit
tags like "red radical," "red-blooded American," "hard
headed business men."
And so, with American's permission, I would like
to have Jorgi stick around a while longer. The Uni
versity is supposed to teach us, not cram us full of
platitudinous intolerance. There is a fair chance that
we can discuss the affairs of the world without bring
ing riot and revolution to the campus.

YOU KEEP OUTA THIS
our dear pen pal, "An American," gave us a
return engagement yesterday, the campus reacted
with puzzled "What the hells" and irritated references
to sending for a straitjacket. The concensus of opin
ion seems to be that our "American" is all a gag, pos
sibly a lonely soph in Toyon, or a Row man who could
n't get a date and had to amuse himself some way.
But the letter shows such an amazing efficiency in
misinterpreting everything it mentions that somebody
has to plough in and try to clear up the situation.
In his masterpiece, American threw so many bou
quets that he must have a frightfully sore shoulder this
morning. And one of these catapulting corsages was
aimed at "Bull Session." I was told that I had "in
geniously . . - defeated the efforts of a small group of
radical students and professors to link the name of
Stanford University with that of the Communists in
Spain." First, I would like to return that bouquet with
all the outraged emphasis that the melodrama heroine
uses when she bounces the villain's diamonds. I don't
want it. And, thank God, I didn't earn it.
* # * *
Tlie point that "Bull Session" tried with discour
aging futility to pound home to Jorgi's committee had
nothing to do with communism, fascism, hell, or the
American Legion. I did not want to "defeat" any
thing; all I asked was that the committee consider for
a minute whether or not it was laying the basis for a
lot of future trouble.
That matter disposed of, I now point out to
"American" a fact he has ignored completely. There
is just as much chance that the awful communists are
right, as there is that he is on the inside track. In
deed, the very way in which American closes up his
mind like a box turtle to everything that doesn't bear
him out, indicates that he is quite probably oil the
track.
* * * *
OUT even if our Fascist pal is right, even if God Al
mighty had whispered the eternal Truth in his
ear, the communists would have just as much right as
he to say what they think. That is the philosophy of
American government. And if our correspondent does
n't like it, there's nothing he can do about it. Pos
