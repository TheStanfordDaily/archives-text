YV/E have a very fine friend from Sequoia who greets
** us heartily whenever he sees us. Sometimes, we
are apt to get in trouble about it, or so it seems, now
and again.
The other day, we left our Poli Sci class and walked
along the Inner Quad with the instructor. When it
came to a parting of the ways near the Education
Building, we stood for a minute to finish a dis
cussion.
At this point, enters our fi'iend.
Before I could say, "Hey!" he had slapped us both
on the back, and said, "Well, well! How's everything
with everyone." Then, "Say, Butch, who's this, a new
frosh?"
We are afraid to talk with our Poli Sci instructor
out of section any more.
It has been reported from the various casas that
Lagunita cleaning women all look like one another,
do, wear and even say the same things. But here is
an example of one who did something unexpected. It
seems that under the present system waste baskets are
removed from rooms sharply at 8:30 of a morning,
for purposes of emptying.
Unfortunately, this si disturbing to those girls who
would sleep through eight o'clocks and others, needing
rest as they do, and being accustomcd to the luxury
of sleeping for the beauty. Not long ago, there was a
co-ed who decided to sleep a wee-bit later than half
past eight. Unenthusiastic about the usual disturb
ances, she placed her wastebasket in front of her
door, thereby precluding, she thought, the possibility
of an early awakening.
At eight-thirty sharp, the chambermaid knocked,
came in, and said: "Is this your wastebasket?" In the
following space, fill in what you yourself might have
said to the chambermaid.
'"INHERE is another girl who lives at Lagunita, and
has experiences with wastebaskets. She awoke one
morning, her first in Lagunita, to find a little clean
ing-slavey running off, with a brand new waste basket
clutched desperately in her arms.
Bewildered, the girl didn't know whether to scream
or go back to sleep. She decided she needed sleep.
The young lady, after questioning, revealed that she
considered occurrences of this sort extremely shocking
to the nervous system, as well as disturbing to the
sleep.
We know of a little Chi O who wants to go to the
S.C. game, but doesn't care for the train ride. None
of her sisters can take her, so she asked around for a
ride the other day; an Alpha Sig she knew said five
fellows were going in his car. But they'd be "glad to
have her."
