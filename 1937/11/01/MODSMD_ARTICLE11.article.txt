# ‘Trial by Jury' Tops Double Campus Bill
## No ‘Audience Appeal’ In ‘Murder’ Drama; Comedy Scores Again 
### BERT ALWARD 
Two performances of T. S. Eliot's
"Murder in the Cathedral" and Gil
bert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury"
were given last week-end by the
University Division of Speech and
Drama and the Division of Music.
The presentations were sponsored by
the Stanford Mothers' Club. Stan
ford Glee Club, Women's Glee Club,
and the University Choir co-oper
ated in the production.
"Murder in the Cathedral," by
T. S. Eliot, was artistic, but a fail
ure as far as audiences are con
cerned at Stanford. Acting, produc
tion and scenery were marvelous.
J. P. Cahn as Thomas a Beckett
reached great heights throughout his
performance, and particularly in his
sermon.
Few Enjoy Show
Unfortunately, few people, if any
one, really enjoyed it. Most were
impressed. It wasn't boring. It was
over the head. It wasn't amateurish.
Opening with an effective chorus
of the women of Canterbury in the
orchestra pit, much was expressed
by balance of characters. Cahn,
himself, was the only individual on
the stage.
Calm Sermon High Point
Cahn's sermon, starting in the
usual matter-of-fact note that ser
mons have, finished with so much
real emotion that members of the
audience gripped their chairs and
wondered that he could finish.
The next best scene was played
with Kahn and the "Tempters." One
after another they came to the stage
and told the Archbishop what to do.
Gary Simpson stole the scene for
himself with his voice and gestures.
He had a laugh and manner that is
unforgettable. Bill Goetz and Doug
Bryan were admirable knights.
Direction Good
Credit is due Director Gordon
Lange for marvelous handling
throughout. That the play was un
suitable for Stanford was evidenced
by a consistent walking out after
the first few minutes.
"Trial by Jury," Gilbert and Sul
livan—need more be said? The all
musical production was dsme so well
that people wonder why there is no
more of it at Stanford. No college
audience could or did ask more.
Director Miles Heberer didn't miss a
chance throughout. Judge James
Barnum skillfully played his part
with able assistance by the whole
cast. All voices were clear, and the
cast felt the play.
Enjoyable Production
Plaintiff Audis Davis was appro
priately weeping on the attorney's
shoulder or sitting on the judge's
lap most of the time.
Here was a production in which
the whole cast deserves credit, as
well as Waldemar Johansen, who
designed the set. It was a highly
enjoyable production, well done,
and well received.

Drama and the Division of Music.
The presentations were sponsored by
the Stanford Mothers' Club. Stan
ford Glee Club, Women's Glee Club,
and the University Choir co-oper
ated in the production.
"Murder in the Cathedral," by
T. S. Eliot, was artistic, but a fail
ure as far as audiences are con
cerned at Stanford. Acting, produc
tion and scenery were marvelous.
J. P. Cahn as Thomas a Beckett
reached great heights throughout his
performance, and particularly in his
sermon.
Few Enjoy Show
Unfortunately, few people, if any
one, really enjoyed it. Most were
impressed. It wasn't boring. It was
over the head. It wasn't amateurish.
Opening with an effective chorus
of the women of Canterbury in the
orchestra pit, much was expressed
by balance of characters. Cahn,
himself, was the only individual on
the stage.
Calm Sermon High Point
Cahn's sermon, starting in the
usual matter-of-fact note that ser
mons have, finished with so much
real emotion that members of the
audience gripped their chairs and
wondered that he could finish.
The next best scene was played
with Kahn and the "Tempters." One
after another they came to the stage
and told the Archbishop what to do.
Gary Simpson stole the scene for
himself with his voice and gestures.
He had a laugh and manner that is
unforgettable. Bill Goetz and Doug
Bryan were admirable knights.
Direction Good
Credit is due Director Gordon
Lange for marvelous handling
throughout. That the play was un
suitable for Stanford was evidenced
by a consistent walking out after
the first few minutes.
"Trial by Jury," Gilbert and Sul
livan—need more be said? The all
musical production was dsme so well
that people wonder why there is no
more of it at Stanford. No college
audience could or did ask more.
Director Miles Heberer didn't miss a
chance throughout. Judge James
Barnum skillfully played his part
with able assistance by the whole
cast. All voices were clear, and the
cast felt the play.
Enjoyable Production
Plaintiff Audis Davis was appro
priately weeping on the attorney's
shoulder or sitting on the judge's
lap most of the time.
Here was a production in which
the whole cast deserves credit, as
well as Waldemar Johansen, who
designed the set. It was a highly
enjoyable production, well done,
and well received.
Two performances of T. S. Eliot's
"Murder in the Cathedral" and Gil
bert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury"
were given last week-end by the
University Division of Speech and
Drama and the Division of Music.
