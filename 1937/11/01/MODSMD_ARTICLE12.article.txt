# ONWARD ROMANCE!
## 
### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
"Jim had just asked me to
marry him, and I couldn't come
in then."
So romance marches on, and
Stanford women get lockouts.
Robleites are going through
their first experience with dat ol'
debbil Lock-out, and already
it's getting to be a nuisance.
One enthusiastic freshman
woman wrote on her lockout slip
as an excuse, "Excitement of go
ing to the city for the first time,"
and another, "First experience of
going out at Stanford."
Then there's the one who
wrote, "Standing outside watch
ing clock. Apparently can't see
straight."
Maybe the freshman women
are learning fast, though, for this
rather ambiguous excuse re
cently appeared, "Not enough
time allowed."

But don't worry, Women of
Roble. Your older sisters in Hall
and Row aren't doing much bet
ter. A comparison of the lock
out statistics on the Row and the
smaller halls for the past month
show that Pi Phi and Theta have
the most and Redwoods the least
number of lockouts. And the
majority of the inhabitants of
Redwoods are freshmen!
It's a little better when the
number of late leaves taken is
considered, and the proportions
are interesting. Tri-Delt took
the most late leaves oil the Row
and Madrona led for the halls.
And so it goes on and on. The
freshmen women worry and
hurry home. The older women
sometimes forget to hurry, and
as for worrying, one recently had
the temerity to wxite as her ex
cuse for a lockout, "Show lasted
too long. Sorry."
