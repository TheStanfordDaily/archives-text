# Sunday Night Movie Income Exceeds Cost
## 
### 
More than doubling expenses, the
showing last night of "All Quiet on
the Western Front," proved the suc
cess of Ex Committee's Sunday night
movie plan, according to Bill Hovey,
movie committee chairman. The
audience numbered 563.
Programs in the projected series
will be shown every few weeks,
Hovey said, with the next one
scheduled for either two or three
weeks from last night.
Responsive spectators saw, be
sides "All Quiet," scenes from A1
Jolson's "The Jazz Singer" and
"Steamboat Willie," first of t the
Mickey Mouse animateds.
A news brief showing George
Bernard Shaw was left off the bill,
judged "too long and boring" by
the committee.
Temporary cancellation of the se
ries last week was because straight
booking of an educational series
was then one requisite of the Mu
seum of Modern Art of the Univer
sity of California, which supplied
"All Quiet" and will probably sup
ply the next film program.
