### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 31 (UP). —Soviet
Russia tonight warned the United
States and other "bourgeois powers"
against permitting Italy to turn the
Far Eastern Peace Conference in
Brussels Wednesday into "a new
edition of the London Non-interven
tion Committee on Spain."
It was evident, from the tone of
editorials in the official government
and Communist party organs, that
the Russian delegation to the Brus
sels conference will demand stern
action against Japan because of the
latter's alleged aggression in China.
Litvinoff Named Head
It was announced at the Kremlin
tonight that Maxim Litvinoff, fiery
tempered Commissar of Foreign Af
fairs, who recently led the condem
nation of Italy and Japan before
the League of Nations, will head the
Soviet delegation.

they held scant hope of any "rea
sonable results" from the Brussels

Izvestia, government mouthpiece,
added that "up to the present there
is no reason to expect that the
Brussels edition will prove any bet
ter than the London one, which has
only served the aims of an aggres
sor."
Russia's stand at the Brussels con
ference probably will be stiffer still
as a result of a new outbreak of
troubles along the Russian-Manchu
kuoan frontier, where a detachment
of Japanese troops were alleged to
have fired on a Russian border
guard near Pakshekori last Thurs
day. A protest is being prepared for
submission to the Japanese govern
ment.
