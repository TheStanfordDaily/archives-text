# Trueblood Gives Talk on Humanity
## 
### 
Warning that man must not lose
sight of humanity as a whole, Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood, university
chaplain, spoke on All Saints' Day
in yesterday's sermon in the Me
morial Chapel.
"Often we are too individualistic
and superficial in this modern day,
because we lose sight of the world's
past and the breadth of humanity,"
he said.
Dr. Trueblood praised the produc
tion of "Murder in the Cathedral,"
last Friday and Saturday, as an ex
ample of an individual reaching into
the past and recognizing the quality
of mankind and showing, to the
modern world, the useful heritage
of the past.
In tracing his theme, Dr. True
blood first outlined the history of
All Saints Day, from its early cele
brations through the time of the
Roman Empire, and to the present,
when it has lost much of its signifi
cance.
"We should stretch the mean
ing of All Saints Day to include the
entire human race," said Dr. True
blood, "instead of limiting it to the
inclusion of only individuals."
