# Thief Ransacks Kappa Sig House
## 
### 
Three wrist watches of consider
able value were stolen during the
past week-end from rooms in the
Kappa Sig house during early morn
ing hours. Although an unknown
man was reported seen leaving the
house at 4 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, police as yet have received no
other information regarding the
suspect.
Caution in leaving valuables
around living quarters is urged by
members of the campus police force
to make it unprofitable for burg
lars to operate in Farm buildings.
Officer Gordy Davis suggests that
students contact the radio desk of
the Palo Alto police in any case
where an unknown person is seen
in a campus residence. Radio patrol
cars operate on the Farm 24 hours
a day, and they will be notified
through the sending set of the Paly
police.
