# Wet Weather Blamed For Gridiron Tie
## Field, Ball Unsuitable For Air or Ground Play in O.S.C. Tilt 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
When Stanford coaches discussed
the Stanford-O.S.C. crisis last week,
they predicted that if the Indians
won they would sail through two
victories to a tough battle against
University of California.
When Line-coach Ben Winkleman
said the Cards would "truck on
down," he did not consider a tic,
and neither did the others.
Wet Ball, Wet Field
Well, Saturday's game was a
scoreless tie, an even match in al
most- every respect. But the two
big zeros on the scoreboard can be
attributed directly to a wet ball and
a wet field.
Joe Gray, renowned passer for the
Beavers, remarked as he left the
game early with an injured knee,
"I've never had so much trouble
holding on to the ball—even up
north in hard rains."
No Aerial Attack
The situation was the same on
both sides; you just couldn't use an
aerial attack on a day like that.
And the field was in the worst
possible shape for ground play. It
was not muddy—it was slippery.
Rain caused kickers on both sides
considerable grief. Bill Duncan,
Oregon State quarterback, admit
ted after the game that the wet ball,
along with swift Stanford ends,
messed up his booting.
Rain Slows Shift
Slow shifting, which appeared to
be the Cards' greatest weakness, can
also be blamed on the rain. The
boys had to shift slowly and care
fully in ordei to hold on to the ball
when it was passed.
This gave their opponents a
chance to shift accordingly and
place their defensive weight where
it would do the most good against
the Indian offensive set-up.
Team Below Par
Indians were definitely below their
usual par, but the Beavers admitted
that their usual game was not a
great deal better.
The Northerners felt they would
have iost decisively if they had not
had the breaks, which came mostly
in the form of Stanford penalties in
crucial situations.
Coach Praises Willard
Coach Tiny Thornhill praised Bill
Willard for his speed, particularly
when he chased Oregon State's Har
old Higgins back into the hands of
Grant Stone and Pete Zagar for
three straight losses.
Bill Kirsch was included in his
mentor's list of heroes because of
an excellent blocking performance,
not to mention his usual perfect
tackling record and his single run,
on which he covered 17 yards.
Fay, Groves Slow
Peter Fay's long fast runs and
skillful cutting in made his total
yardage second only to that of Jim
Groves on the Card team, and his
average was better. Peter continued
a kicking performance that all Ire
land can be proud of.
Coach Thornhill will devote a
large part of this week to polishing
up the ofiense for U.S.C. Saturday
v/ith the belief that "it worked once
and will work again."

Joe Gray, renowned passer for the
Beavers, remarked as he left the
game early with an injured knee,
"I've never had so much trouble
holding on to the ball—even up
north in hard rains."
No Aerial Attack
The situation was the same on
both sides; you just couldn't use an
aerial attack on a day like that.
And the field was in the worst
possible shape for ground play. It
was not muddy—it was slippery.
Rain caused kickers on both sides
considerable grief. Bill Duncan,
Oregon State quarterback, admit
ted after the game that the wet ball,
along with swift Stanford ends,
messed up his booting.
Rain Slows Shift
Slow shifting, which appeared to
be the Cards' greatest weakness, can
also be blamed on the rain. The
boys had to shift slowly and care
fully in ordei to hold on to the ball
when it was passed.
This gave their opponents a
chance to shift accordingly and
place their defensive weight where
it would do the most good against
the Indian offensive set-up.
Team Below Par
Indians were definitely below their
usual par, but the Beavers admitted
that their usual game was not a
great deal better.
The Northerners felt they would
have iost decisively if they had not
had the breaks, which came mostly
in the form of Stanford penalties in
crucial situations.
Coach Praises Willard
Coach Tiny Thornhill praised Bill
Willard for his speed, particularly
when he chased Oregon State's Har
old Higgins back into the hands of
Grant Stone and Pete Zagar for
three straight losses.
Bill Kirsch was included in his
mentor's list of heroes because of
an excellent blocking performance,
not to mention his usual perfect
tackling record and his single run,
on which he covered 17 yards.
Fay, Groves Slow
Peter Fay's long fast runs and
skillful cutting in made his total
yardage second only to that of Jim
Groves on the Card team, and his
average was better. Peter continued
a kicking performance that all Ire
land can be proud of.
Coach Thornhill will devote a
large part of this week to polishing
up the ofiense for U.S.C. Saturday
v/ith the belief that "it worked once
and will work again."
When Stanford coaches discussed
the Stanford-O.S.C. crisis last week,
they predicted that if the Indians
won they would sail through two
victories to a tough battle against
University of California.
When Line-coach Ben Winkleman
said the Cards would "truck on
down," he did not consider a tic,
and neither did the others.
Wet Ball, Wet Field
Well, Saturday's game was a
scoreless tie, an even match in al
most- every respect. But the two
big zeros on the scoreboard can be
attributed directly to a wet ball and
a wet field.

Beavers, remarked as he left the
