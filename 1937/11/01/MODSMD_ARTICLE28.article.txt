# Flagman at Tracks Warns of Dangers
## 
### RUTH DYNES 
Stanford students mutter dark
things at the man who lowers the
railroad gates when they tear into
Paly, at various illegal speeds, de
pending on the make of their ve
hicle.
Charles G. Hayton, the man in the
white frame tower, doesn't mind
them; he likes them; in fact, he
worries over them.
Hilch-hike Danger
"The biggest danger here," he
said, "is from the students who stop
their cars at the news stand to give
lifts out to the campus. When they
are as many as three deep, they
stop up a line of cars behind them,
back across the tracks.
"There has never been an auto
mobile accident at the crossing, but
I'm always afraid, that when they
get stuck like that, I won't be able
to clear the tracks and lower the
gates in time." He suggested that
students give, and get, lifts at a
point nearer the highway.
Hayton Unperturbed
Hayton is unperturbed by the fact
that his present job will be elimi
nated if the city's plans for an un
derpass go through. He is ready to
rely on his construction and railroad
record to find him another position
without difficulty.
From his experience in watching
the corner since December, 1934,
Hayton feels that a better location
for the proposed underpass would
be at Homer or Channing avenues.
Suggests Plan
"My objection to the underpass
the way they're planning to build
it now," he said, "is that it will make
a 'bottle-neck' of the Circle. The
four-lane traffic from the campus at
Game time would be congested near
the tracks, as it was directed into
University Avenue." He pointed out
that University Avenue has only two
lanes.
At either of the streets he sug
gests, Hayton proposed that an ar
terial be constructed connecting it
with Hamilton Avenue, a four-lane
thoroughfare. There would be less
likelihood of expensive injunctions,

as are anticipated to arise over the
extension of University Avenue.
Favors Move
Hayton is in favor of leaving the
crossing as at present. Instead, he
thinks that if the station were moved
down to the location of the under
pass, the length of a long train away,
the crossing could be kept clear for
traffic turning in from the highway,
or out into it.
A last point that Hayton men
tioned in favor of his plan is that
Homer or Channing would afford a
more central location for railroad
service to the people of Palo Alto as
a whole.
