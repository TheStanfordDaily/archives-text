# Uclan Score Scares Bears; Trojans Tied
## Bad Bruins Cross Cal's Goal; Broncs Thwack Marquette Men, 38-0 
### HARRY PRESS 
It certainly wasn't what one could
call an exciting week-end for Coast
football fans. Three scoreless ties,
and the next-to-best team playing
2200 miles away didn't leave much
to see.
Speaking «of the next-to-best team
brings to mind the thought that the
best team furnished the only shock
of the week: they had a /ery bad
Hallowe'en scare from little brother.
But they won, 27-14.
Bears Use First String
Yes, Bill Spaulding's Bruins had
the audacity to compel Stub Allison
to send his first string Bears on to
the rescue. What's more, one of the
U.C.L.A. lads was nervy enough to
crash right through that great, big,
brave Cal line for 60 yards and a
touchdown.
The Bruins pulled everything they
ever knew, and then some, but Cal
—well, Cal is just sorta too good
for anything else that is pounding a
gridiron this season. And that little
extra element of potency was what
saved Mons. Stub from a bad case of
the jitters.
Huskies Win
The Huskies finally got mad
enough to win a ball game. The
boys from Washington took their
spite out on Idaho, very severely,
too. The chart read 21-7.
The Vandals climaxed a 68-yard
march with a touchdown to take a
7-2 lead in the first period. This was
soon nullified, though, when Husky
regulars came in to take charge and
push over a score in each succeed
ing period.
W.S.C. Scores
The only scoring threat of the
Troy-Cougar game, played in a cot
ton-thick fog, came the first time
W.S.C. put the ball into play, about
five minutes after the opening
whistle. A pass and lateral took the
ball from the U.S.C. 40 to the eight,
followed by a plunge to the three on
third down. A last down pass into
the end zone was incomplete, and
that was the nearest either team
came to winning the ball game.
Santa Clara Triumphs
Santa Clara, the next -to - best
team, showed hecklers far and wide
that last year's Sugar Bowl award
was no fluke when, at Chicago, they
had a practice scrimmage with Mar
quette as the stooge, 38-0.
Coach Buck Shaw insultingly used
every man on the squad. What's
more, these men insultingly played
very unorthodox football, not only
passing when in possession of a safe
lead, but passing on the first down.
They're not nice, these Broncs. But
what gridders!
Bengals Hold Gaels
Mr. A. A. Stagg's Bengals made
Mr. Slip Madigan's Gaels look very
sick Saturday, when the latter had a
tough time holding the former to
a scoreless tie. That's just the way
it was: St. Mary's barely did stop a
prospective Pacific score after the
Bengals had moved 63 yards in three
fast plays to end up with a first down
on the three-yard marker. But they
did, and the rest of the game was a
typical scoreless battle: blank as the
scoreboard.
Scoring in the second period on a
20-yard cutback through tackle by
Seeno, U.S.F. outlasted Loyola for a
6-0 win in Los Angeles. The rest
of the game was a hard-played
kicking and plunging duel, with
neither team doing enough damage
to count for an advantage.

Bengals had moved 63 yards in three
fast plays to end up with a first down
on the three-yard marker. But they
did, and the rest of the game was a
typical scoreless battle: blank as the
scoreboard.
Scoring in the second period on a
20-yard cutback through tackle by
Seeno, U.S.F. outlasted Loyola for a
6-0 win in Los Angeles. The rest
of the game was a hard-played
kicking and plunging duel, with
neither team doing enough damage
to count for an advantage.
It certainly wasn't what one could
call an exciting week-end for Coast
football fans. Three scoreless ties,
and the next-to-best team playing
2200 miles away didn't leave much
to see.
Speaking «of the next-to-best team
brings to mind the thought that the
best team furnished the only shock
of the week: they had a /ery bad
Hallowe'en scare from little brother.
But they won, 27-14.
Bears Use First String
Yes, Bill Spaulding's Bruins had
the audacity to compel Stub Allison
to send his first string Bears on to
the rescue. What's more, one of the
U.C.L.A. lads was nervy enough to
crash right through that great, big,
brave Cal line for 60 yards and a
touchdown.
The Bruins pulled everything they
ever knew, and then some, but Cal
—well, Cal is just sorta too good
for anything else that is pounding a
gridiron this season. And that little
extra element of potency was what
saved Mons. Stub from a bad case of
the jitters.
Huskies Win
The Huskies finally got mad
enough to win a ball game. The
boys from Washington took their
spite out on Idaho, very severely,
too. The chart read 21-7.
The Vandals climaxed a 68-yard
march with a touchdown to take a
7-2 lead in the first period. This was
soon nullified, though, when Husky
regulars came in to take charge and
push over a score in each succeed
ing period.
W.S.C. Scores
The only scoring threat of the
Troy-Cougar game, played in a cot
ton-thick fog, came the first time
W.S.C. put the ball into play, about
five minutes after the opening
whistle. A pass and lateral took the
ball from the U.S.C. 40 to the eight,
followed by a plunge to the three on
third down. A last down pass into
the end zone was incomplete, and
that was the nearest either team
came to winning the ball game.
Santa Clara Triumphs
Santa Clara, the next -to - best
team, showed hecklers far and wide
that last year's Sugar Bowl award
was no fluke when, at Chicago, they
had a practice scrimmage with Mar
quette as the stooge, 38-0.
Coach Buck Shaw insultingly used
every man on the squad. What's
more, these men insultingly played
very unorthodox football, not only
passing when in possession of a safe
lead, but passing on the first down.
They're not nice, these Broncs. But
what gridders!
Bengals Hold Gaels
Mr. A. A. Stagg's Bengals made
Mr. Slip Madigan's Gaels look very
sick Saturday, when the latter had a
tough time holding the former to
a scoreless tie. That's just the way
it was: St. Mary's barely did stop a
prospective Pacific score after the
Bengals had moved 63 yards in three
fast plays to end up with a first down
on the three-yard marker. But they
did, and the rest of the game was a
typical scoreless battle: blank as the
