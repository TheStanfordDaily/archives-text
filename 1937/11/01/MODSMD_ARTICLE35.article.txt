# B.A.C. To Get Plans for New Athletic Field
## Expenditure of $1250 Required in Proposal Comes up Wednesday 
### 
A proposal for a new athletic field
for intramural sports will be sub
mitted to the Board of Athletic Con
trol next Wednesday night. The
proposal calls for an expenditure of
$1250, which will be used in clear
ing and leveling land at the open
end of the stadium.
A crowded intramural program
prompted the proposal.
"At the present rate of intramural
growth, Stanford will soon need
more room," stated Harry Wolter,
intramural director, in an interview
last night. "We have enough room
this year for our activities, but our
program is pretty crowded, and we
keep adding new competitions. This
year we've added volleyball."
The new field would contain three
touch football fields. At present
games are being played on the
Sunken Diamond, the frosh baseball
field, and the Gray football field.
Wolter pointed out that centralizing
the intramural sports would prove
more economical, and that players
would be able to find their games
instead of rushing around to the
various diamonds looking for their
opponents.
"At present Stanford's intramural
program is one of the best in the
country," declared Wolter. "Its
continued expansion has made it
possible for a larger number of stu
dents to become active in athletics."
