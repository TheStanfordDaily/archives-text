IT WAS A
HEAL DEADLOCK
The Indians and Beavers were
battling on pretty even terms in the
stadium Saturday afternoon. The
score tells the true tale of how
evenly the teams were matched.
If anybody deserved to win it
was Tiny ThornhiH's boys. In the
closing minutes of the deadlock
struggle, Stanford was fighting
hard to win the old ball game and
the Staters were hanging on. quite
content with a scoreless tie.
Lon Stiner's gridders didn't at
tempt to cover up their obvious
stalling tactics in those closing min
utes. I'm still wondering why the
ref didn't call 'em on it.
AERIAL SHOW WAS
NIL SATURDAY
The loss of Joe "Ghost" Gray in
the first quarter may have made a
difference in the outcome of the
game but I don't believe so. When
he was in there he threw a couple
of beautiful bullet passes but neither
of them was at all accurate.
The aerial show some of us had
expected was certainly lacking.
Stanford threw six passes and
Oregon State tossed 8. The Indians
made exactly 10 yards on one
completed pass, and the Staters
did them one better by piling up
7 yards on two completed passes.
Some other interesting facts creep
out of the statistician's sheet on
Saturday's game. Stanford's Jimmy
Coflis and Pete Fay averaged 0 yards
for their punt returns. Then penal
ties were sure going against the
Cards. They were set back no less
than 64 yards on penalties. Both of
Bill Paulman's kickoffs went out of
bounds in the same spot 25 yards
from Stanford's 40-yard line.
BEAVER KICKS
RUSIIED ALL DAY
An unusual angle was worked in
to the game v/hon Stanford linemen
nailed three Beaver passers in rapid
succession before they could even
think of getting off their tosses. The
northerners lost 22 yards on those
three plays.
The Card tackles and ends
were rushing the Beaver kickers
:;li day. At least four State kicks
were either partially blocked or
were so hurried that they didn't
go for any distance.
The frosh showed a world of pow
er in walloping San Mateo Junior
College, 20-0. The Jaysees had lost
only one game up to Saturday and
that was to the Cal babes by a close
7-4 margin.
This boy Norm Standlee is one of
the best frosh backfield prospects I
have seen at Stanford since the
yearling days of the vowing sophs.
He's a 60-minute man and pours it
on from beginning to end.
I see where Cal had trouble dis
posing of the Bruins down south.
More power to the Bruins. In the
six games before the southern
game, the bone-crushing Bears piled
up 1,449 yards through the line and
397 yards via the air route. The
Bear opponents aggregated 368
yards by running and 230 yards by
passes.

7 yards on two completed passes.
Some other interesting facts creep
out of the statistician's sheet on
Saturday's game. Stanford's Jimmy
Coflis and Pete Fay averaged 0 yards
for their punt returns. Then penal
ties were sure going against the
Cards. They were set back no less
than 64 yards on penalties. Both of
Bill Paulman's kickoffs went out of
bounds in the same spot 25 yards
from Stanford's 40-yard line.
BEAVER KICKS
RUSIIED ALL DAY
An unusual angle was worked in
to the game v/hon Stanford linemen
nailed three Beaver passers in rapid
succession before they could even
think of getting off their tosses. The
northerners lost 22 yards on those
three plays.
The Card tackles and ends
were rushing the Beaver kickers
:;li day. At least four State kicks
were either partially blocked or
were so hurried that they didn't
go for any distance.
The frosh showed a world of pow
er in walloping San Mateo Junior
College, 20-0. The Jaysees had lost
only one game up to Saturday and
that was to the Cal babes by a close
7-4 margin.
This boy Norm Standlee is one of
the best frosh backfield prospects I
have seen at Stanford since the
yearling days of the vowing sophs.
He's a 60-minute man and pours it
on from beginning to end.
I see where Cal had trouble dis
posing of the Bruins down south.
More power to the Bruins. In the
six games before the southern
game, the bone-crushing Bears piled
up 1,449 yards through the line and
397 yards via the air route. The
Bear opponents aggregated 368
yards by running and 230 yards by
passes.

IT WAS A
HEAL DEADLOCK
The Indians and Beavers were
battling on pretty even terms in the
stadium Saturday afternoon. The
score tells the true tale of how
evenly the teams were matched.
If anybody deserved to win it
was Tiny ThornhiH's boys. In the
closing minutes of the deadlock
struggle, Stanford was fighting
hard to win the old ball game and
the Staters were hanging on. quite
content with a scoreless tie.
Lon Stiner's gridders didn't at
tempt to cover up their obvious
stalling tactics in those closing min
utes. I'm still wondering why the
ref didn't call 'em on it.
AERIAL SHOW WAS
NIL SATURDAY
The loss of Joe "Ghost" Gray in
the first quarter may have made a
difference in the outcome of the
game but I don't believe so. When
he was in there he threw a couple
of beautiful bullet passes but neither
of them was at all accurate.
The aerial show some of us had
expected was certainly lacking.
Stanford threw six passes and
Oregon State tossed 8. The Indians
made exactly 10 yards on one
completed pass, and the Staters
did them one better by piling up
7 yards on two completed passes.
