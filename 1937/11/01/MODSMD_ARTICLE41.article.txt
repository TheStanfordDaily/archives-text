# Papooses Upset San Mateo J. C.
## Frosh Show Improvement By 20-0 Win Farm Freshmen Chalk Up 12 First Downs To Bulldogs' Three 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Stanford's improved frosh football
team ran over a highly touted San
Mateo J.C. bunch 20-0 Saturday in
a pretty one-sided game.
The facts that Stanford made 20
points to San Mateo's none and
chalked up 12 first downs to their
three doesn't tell the whole story.
Most of their first downs were made
in the center of the field, and two
of their touchdowns came with
breaks.
Standlee Scores
When San Mateo tried a quick
kick on her own 25-yard line, the
whole Stanford line came in to
block it. Captain Norm Standlee re
covered it in the air and ran for a
touchdown without being touched,
then converted from Stan Graff's
fingers.
Snapped from their lethargy for
the first time that afternoon, San
Mateo started for a score of their
own. Vance Peters, their best man
and a good man on anyone's team,
made a pretty run from his 30 to
the 50. He was injured on the play,
and had to be taken out. What fire
San Mateo had went out of the
game with Peters. In repeated line
charges, Stanford forced them back
to their 45, where Stanford took the
ball.
Stanford was unable to make a
scoring drive here, but they put San
Mateo back on their 25 again. From
there the boys from up the Penin
sula tried a pass which Halfback
Glen South neatly intercepted.
South Scores
He ran for a touchdown to the
same part of the end zone that
Standlee had entered but a short
time before. Not a man was near
him. Standlee again converted,
making the score 14-0.
Stanford scored again midway in
the fourth quaxter after they had
continued to outplay the J.C. lads.
Their third touchdown came as a
climax to a drive from midfield.
After Stanford had made two con
secutive first downs, Quentin
Thompson threw a pass to Stan
Graff, who did some very pretty
open field running to the four-yard
marker. On the third down Stand
lee went around right end for three
yards and the third Papoose touch
down. His attempted conversion
kick was blocked, and the score was
20-0.

Mateo J.C. bunch 20-0 Saturday in
a pretty one-sided game.
The facts that Stanford made 20
points to San Mateo's none and
chalked up 12 first downs to their
three doesn't tell the whole story.
Most of their first downs were made
in the center of the field, and two
of their touchdowns came with
breaks.
Standlee Scores
When San Mateo tried a quick
kick on her own 25-yard line, the
whole Stanford line came in to
block it. Captain Norm Standlee re
covered it in the air and ran for a
touchdown without being touched,
then converted from Stan Graff's
fingers.
Snapped from their lethargy for
the first time that afternoon, San
Mateo started for a score of their
own. Vance Peters, their best man
and a good man on anyone's team,
made a pretty run from his 30 to
the 50. He was injured on the play,
and had to be taken out. What fire
San Mateo had went out of the
game with Peters. In repeated line
charges, Stanford forced them back
to their 45, where Stanford took the
ball.
Stanford was unable to make a
scoring drive here, but they put San
Mateo back on their 25 again. From
there the boys from up the Penin
sula tried a pass which Halfback
Glen South neatly intercepted.
South Scores
He ran for a touchdown to the
same part of the end zone that
Standlee had entered but a short
time before. Not a man was near
him. Standlee again converted,
making the score 14-0.
Stanford scored again midway in
the fourth quaxter after they had
continued to outplay the J.C. lads.
Their third touchdown came as a
climax to a drive from midfield.
After Stanford had made two con
secutive first downs, Quentin
Thompson threw a pass to Stan
Graff, who did some very pretty
open field running to the four-yard
marker. On the third down Stand
lee went around right end for three
yards and the third Papoose touch
down. His attempted conversion
kick was blocked, and the score was
20-0.
