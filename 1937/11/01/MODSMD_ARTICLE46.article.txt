# Soccermen Defeat San Jose State, 1-0
## 
### 
Stanford's soccermen returned to
winning form again Saturday morn
ing when they nipped the San Jose
State eleven by a 1-0 margin on
the Indian field. It was the Cardi
nals' second conference victory
against one defeat, putting them
back into the thick of the pennant
race with the defending champion
California Bears.
Midway in the second period Tev
fik Sadullah, Stanford's Turkish
center forward, took a cornerkick
from the toe of Karl Schaupp and
booted the ball past the San Jose
State goalie for the only score of
the game.
Only during that second quarter
did the Card forward line seriously
threaten San Jose's goal. Through
out the rest of the fray the Indians
lay back and fought off San Jose
threats, playing defensive ball all
through the second half and des
perately stemming their opponents'
attempts to overcome their slim
lead.
After leading for three quarters
in their game with Menlo Jaysee
Saturday at Menlo, Stanford's frosh
were scored upon in the final period,
and after 10 minutes of overtime
play, the game ended in a 1-1 draw.
