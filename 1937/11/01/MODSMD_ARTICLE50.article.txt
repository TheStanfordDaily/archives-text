NEW YORK, OOt. 31 OJ.R). â€”
"Slingin" Sum Baugh, former Texas
Christian University star making his
debut as a professional in New York,
today led the Washington Redskins
to a 21-0 victory over the Brooklyn
Dodgers before a crowd of 22,500 at
Ebbet's Field.
Baugh scored Washington's first
touchdown after the stage had been
set by a blocked Dodger punt that
Millner recovered and lugged to the
one-yard line. Baugh's 38-yard dash
in the third period paved the way
for Don Irwin to go over for the
second touchdown.
