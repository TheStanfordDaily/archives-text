## Elbow Room for Intramural 
### 
WHEN Intramural Director Harry Wolter
went back to Detroit to a meeting of physi
cal education men last September, he carried
with him a suspicion. In bull sessions with other
coaches at the meeting, he confirmed his hunch.
That Stanford has an outstanding intramural
program was his suspicion. That it actually does
stack up with that of any university of similar
size in the country was proved by direct com
parisons with other programs.
Steady growth over the last four years was
the best card that Wolter could boast in his
friendly showdown with other coaches. The
record shows approximately 450 men partici
pating in 1932-33, 1183 in 1936-37, and a cor
responding increase in competing organiza
tions.
But this growth is threatened now, because
the program is outgrowing the available physi
cal plant. Last spring football games overflowed
into the gravel and dirt south of the stadium.
Topheavy schedules this fall shoved touch foot
ball off the grass, onto a smooth dirt surface that
recently caused the year's worst injury.
To relieve the situation, Harry Wolter is ask

ing the Board of Athletic Control to grant $1250
for the construction of a field solely for intra
mural athletics. Such a field, with room for a
number of football and Softball layouts, has
been his dream for years; he sees it as a ne
cessity now.
The $1250 would be an investment in the
cheapest type of athletics at the University, the
one that is praised by rabid advocates of the
de-emphasis of major sports, the most popular
from the players' point of view.
Participants in the program outnumber those
in all intercollegiate sports. With expenses of
only $700 per year, mural sports produce com
petition for over one-third of the men students
at a minimum of cost.
Chief gripe against major sports emphasis is
that those sports have departed from their origi
nal purpose—participation in athletics by stu
dents. Wolter can cite organizations that have
never won a title, but who enter teams every
year. They play for the fun of it.
The granting of these funds by the B.A.C.
Wednesday night will be a move to bring the
greatest good for the greatest number.—L. L.

Topheavy schedules this fall shoved touch foot
ball off the grass, onto a smooth dirt surface that
recently caused the year's worst injury.
To relieve the situation, Harry Wolter is ask

ing the Board of Athletic Control to grant $1250
for the construction of a field solely for intra
mural athletics. Such a field, with room for a
number of football and Softball layouts, has
been his dream for years; he sees it as a ne
cessity now.
The $1250 would be an investment in the
cheapest type of athletics at the University, the
one that is praised by rabid advocates of the
de-emphasis of major sports, the most popular
from the players' point of view.
Participants in the program outnumber those
in all intercollegiate sports. With expenses of
only $700 per year, mural sports produce com
petition for over one-third of the men students
at a minimum of cost.
Chief gripe against major sports emphasis is
that those sports have departed from their origi
nal purpose—participation in athletics by stu
dents. Wolter can cite organizations that have
never won a title, but who enter teams every
year. They play for the fun of it.
The granting of these funds by the B.A.C.
Wednesday night will be a move to bring the
greatest good for the greatest number.—L. L.
WHEN Intramural Director Harry Wolter
went back to Detroit to a meeting of physi
cal education men last September, he carried
with him a suspicion. In bull sessions with other
coaches at the meeting, he confirmed his hunch.
That Stanford has an outstanding intramural
program was his suspicion. That it actually does
stack up with that of any university of similar
size in the country was proved by direct com
parisons with other programs.
Steady growth over the last four years was
the best card that Wolter could boast in his
friendly showdown with other coaches. The
record shows approximately 450 men partici
pating in 1932-33, 1183 in 1936-37, and a cor
responding increase in competing organiza
tions.
But this growth is threatened now, because
the program is outgrowing the available physi
cal plant. Last spring football games overflowed
into the gravel and dirt south of the stadium.
Topheavy schedules this fall shoved touch foot
ball off the grass, onto a smooth dirt surface that
