# From Rut to Groove

### 
IT'S not the best band in the land, but since
the advent of the Tiger Rag and Indian Spe
cial last week-end, it's the best band Stanford
has seen in a long time.
Traditionally, Daily editorials have panned
the Stanford band, and not without cause.
Today The Daily finds pleasure in hanging
the leather medal on the outfit which suddenly
shed its lethargic coat of familiar marches last
Saturday afternoon, and grooved a bit of hot
brass.
It was the redeeming feature of a rather mel
ancholy afternoon.
