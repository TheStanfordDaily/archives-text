# BULL SESSION
## HARTMANN'S FOLLY 
### 
yv/E of The Daily have in hand at the moment a bit
of evidence which indicates that the publishers
of Chaparral are energetic enough to pirate an old gag
even when they have to type it out instead of clipping
it. This evidence, which we might as well call ex
hibit A to make it sound impressive, is a letter from
the Hammer and Coffin Society challenging the staff
of The Daily to a football game at the half of the
Washington State game.
This billet mignon does not catch The Daily with
its editorial trousers about its ankles. Chaparral
never gets an idea without blowing a trumpet, shout
ing from the Press Building house top, and generally
putting on a floor show that would make a maternity
proud hen blush for the inadequacy of its advertis
ing. And so we have had ample warning of the egg
that Chappie is about to lay.
But today our editor is off doing loops in the plane
of higher thought. And the associates are telling
dear alma mater to wash behind her ears. Therefore,
the task of answering Chappie's pitiful bit of bravado
falls to me.
Ordinarily, I would hesitate to foul this column
with a mention of Chaparral. I was taught at an early
age that it is unkind to say things about people who
got short changed on natural endowment. But this
matter is one of campus interest. It will give all
Stanford the opportunity to see for itself that Hammer
and Coffin is only so much chewing gum on the heel
of progress. It will show the students who represent
Ihe powers of light in the ancient feud between
Chaparral and The Daily.
# * * *
years, now, the Chaparral staff has skulked in
its garret, clipping acid comment from other maga
zines, and rewriting it to apply to The Daily. And
for years we have gone our way, like knights of old,
redressing wrongs, and ignoring the muscle-bound
comments of Chappie's mental peasants.
But this year, a rabble rouser has risen to incite
this intellectual proletariat to riot and revolution.
Chappie staff has ceased to paste off-color jokes on
their wall, and has begun to distort them so that
they fit The Daily.
* * * *
Moreover, deciding that it is about time that some
body abolished war, Editor Hartmann has taken on
(his job in passing. Opening his humor (oh, God, have
mercy) magazine, we find an itemized account of how
much it will take to kill us. Following thsi, we find
various side-splitters about bullets in the tummy and
blood in the gutter. Personally, I considered it so
funny that I was almost sick.
The Daily welcomes the chance to demonstrate to
(he world how it surpasses Chaparral. Our boys are
strong, well muscled, and fit. They look like break
fast food ads. Chappie can bring forth only wan,
spongy creatures like those that scurry away when
you kick over a brick. The contrast between clean
thinking and grovelling in the mud is obvious.
♦ * * *
Of course, the game will not be a walkover. Chap
pie is noted for ability to reverse its field. And if its
boys can beat us up the way they mutilate the Eng
lish language, this game will be a blessing for the
bandage manufacturers.
But we are not worried. We know that the facts
will speak for themselves. Even if Hartmann goes
into training and loses 20 pounds, we will still be
sure of justice the minute he ripples off on an end
run. And so, in behalf of The Daily, in the half of
tho Washington State game, I accept the challenge.

that Chappie is about to lay.
But today our editor is off doing loops in the plane
of higher thought. And the associates are telling
dear alma mater to wash behind her ears. Therefore,
the task of answering Chappie's pitiful bit of bravado
falls to me.
Ordinarily, I would hesitate to foul this column
with a mention of Chaparral. I was taught at an early
age that it is unkind to say things about people who
got short changed on natural endowment. But this
matter is one of campus interest. It will give all
Stanford the opportunity to see for itself that Hammer
and Coffin is only so much chewing gum on the heel
of progress. It will show the students who represent
Ihe powers of light in the ancient feud between
Chaparral and The Daily.
# * * *
years, now, the Chaparral staff has skulked in
its garret, clipping acid comment from other maga
zines, and rewriting it to apply to The Daily. And
for years we have gone our way, like knights of old,
redressing wrongs, and ignoring the muscle-bound
comments of Chappie's mental peasants.
But this year, a rabble rouser has risen to incite
this intellectual proletariat to riot and revolution.
Chappie staff has ceased to paste off-color jokes on
their wall, and has begun to distort them so that
they fit The Daily.
* * * *
Moreover, deciding that it is about time that some
body abolished war, Editor Hartmann has taken on
(his job in passing. Opening his humor (oh, God, have
mercy) magazine, we find an itemized account of how
much it will take to kill us. Following thsi, we find
various side-splitters about bullets in the tummy and
blood in the gutter. Personally, I considered it so
funny that I was almost sick.
The Daily welcomes the chance to demonstrate to
(he world how it surpasses Chaparral. Our boys are
strong, well muscled, and fit. They look like break
fast food ads. Chappie can bring forth only wan,
spongy creatures like those that scurry away when
you kick over a brick. The contrast between clean
thinking and grovelling in the mud is obvious.
♦ * * *
Of course, the game will not be a walkover. Chap
pie is noted for ability to reverse its field. And if its
boys can beat us up the way they mutilate the Eng
lish language, this game will be a blessing for the
bandage manufacturers.
But we are not worried. We know that the facts
will speak for themselves. Even if Hartmann goes
into training and loses 20 pounds, we will still be
sure of justice the minute he ripples off on an end
run. And so, in behalf of The Daily, in the half of
tho Washington State game, I accept the challenge.

yv/E of The Daily have in hand at the moment a bit
of evidence which indicates that the publishers
of Chaparral are energetic enough to pirate an old gag
even when they have to type it out instead of clipping
it. This evidence, which we might as well call ex
hibit A to make it sound impressive, is a letter from
the Hammer and Coffin Society challenging the staff
of The Daily to a football game at the half of the
Washington State game.
This billet mignon does not catch The Daily with
its editorial trousers about its ankles. Chaparral
never gets an idea without blowing a trumpet, shout
ing from the Press Building house top, and generally
putting on a floor show that would make a maternity
proud hen blush for the inadequacy of its advertis
ing. And so we have had ample warning of the egg
that Chappie is about to lay.
