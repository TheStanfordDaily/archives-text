VS7HEN in the course of human events the Pi Phi
pay phone tinkles after a football game sisters
gather round. So, last Saturday, when a nice big
voice claiming origin from O.S.C. begged the attentions
of any obliging Pi Phi for city dinner-dancing, ha
ranguing ensued. Finally, one particular sister who
felt particularly obliging was selected to show the
guest the proper Stanford hospitality. Her name was
exchanged over the wire for the O.S.C. name and plans
were laid.
Shortly later a neatly primped and primed Pi Phi
answered the door to find a bewildered man who
gave a name which shockingly corresponded with her
date's. "I'm only a Stanford man," he panted, "some
of those people from Toyon said they were from
O.S.C. and gave my name. Wanna go?"
They went.
After hours of standing on the President's stair
steps at the Wilbur reception one of the frosh grid
ders was finally paired off with someone whom he
was awfully glad to meet but not glad to dance
with.
So the frosh saved his ankles, tired from a hard
afternoon on the gridiron, by probing beneath his
rough exterior for smooth talk.
"Where ya from? I'm from da Ozarks. Would ya
like to dance? It shore feels funny wearin' shoes."
While we were all settling ourselves in the rain at
Saturday's game after a tussle with "Star Spangled
Banner," some inspired body in the inevitable back
row screamed, "To hell with Roosevelt."
It was the tussle with "Hail Stanford, etc." that
brought forth this verse from the man on our right.
"From the da da to the da da.
Sandstone tra la.
Red tile roofs da de da.
Hail Stanford HAIL."
