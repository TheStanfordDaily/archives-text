# Campus Buildings Filmed for Grads
## 
### 
Color motion pictures were taken
this week of Stanford's new build
ings, at the order of former comp
troller Almon E. Roth.
The film, including a 16-mm. rec
ord of the Memorial Theater, the
outdoor amphitheater, and the skel
eton structure of the Cubberley
Education Buliding, will be sent to
New York, for an alumni meeting
to be held there soon.
Mr. Hunt, in charge of the filming
encountered difficulties during the
rush assignment, for which a ten
day deadline has been set. An
afternoon was spent in capturing
sunlight falling through the stained
glass windows of the chapel. Hunt
found the roof of the Memorial The
ater shaky as he photographed a
bird's-eye view of the amphithe
ater.
