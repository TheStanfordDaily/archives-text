Dear pandering Fourth Estaters:
We, the honored and upstanding
membership of that irreproachable
and upstanding society of HAMMER
AND COFFIN, perpetrators and
publishers of Stanford's only re
spectable and courageous journal,
.he STANFORD CHAPARRAL,
Do, HEREBY, and HEREWITH,
and without further ado, challenge
and defy the collection of puny
brains and scandal mongers and
milksop wits referred to in proper
society as the staff of the Stanford
Dilly-Dally, to a contest of brain
and brawn through the medium of
FOOTBALL, to be played between
halves of the Stanford-Washington
State game.
Your contemptible and cowardly
tactics in previous engagements
have prompted us to insist that this
be a battle to the death, or until the
first drop of perspiration appears on
a Daily tryoutee.
Those hybrids who insist on de
positing their rubbish in the col
umns of both our publications will
be kept on the sidelines to be used
in. case the football is misplaced.
It would be nice if you would
prevail upon your friend, Mr. Nathan
Van Patten, to act as referee. If he
is indisposed, perhaps Jose Rodri
guez will consent.
If you would care to concede the
contest at once, it will save us a
slight nuisance and spare you a most
ignominious licking.
