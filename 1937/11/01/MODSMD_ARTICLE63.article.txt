# 'Stage Door' Opens To Let Hepburn Back
## 
### 
"STAGE DOOR" (now playing at
the Stanford Theater) is a well
chosen vehicle with which to start
the slipping Katherine Hepburn on
the road back.
Hepburn is the independent soci
ety girl who turns actress in a fine

way, but she is
pushed closely
for acting honors
by Ginger Rog
ers, who proves
that she can do
' something other
than stooge for
Fred Astaire.
Adolphe Men
jou, as the big -
time producer

who decides the fate of many an
actress, is his usual suave self
as the villain of the piece.
Kaufman's fine touch can be seen
in the lines, which come so thick
and fast that many of them are
drowned out by laughs, but enough
remain audible to give a definite
sparkle.
Beautiful newcomer Andrea Leeds
gives a fine performance as the
heartbroken, unsuccessful actress,
and Gail Patrick slithers her slith
eriest, but top honors go to Hepburn
when she plays the "show must go
on even though your heart is
breaking" scene.
