# Cal Foos Leave Painted Trail
## 
### 
Members of the Class of '41
awoke yesterday morning to
find that California had sent an
advance notice of the antici
pated Big Game visit of its
football forces here.
Their Packards and flivvers
emerged from the effects of a
truly disastrous Hallowe'en . . .
their front windshields painted
with the letters C-A-L. Yellow
and green were most frequent
ly used.
When infuriated Encina and
Roble car owners had finished
making their plans for revenge,
Officer Gordy Davis protested
that perhaps after all the deco
rating job had been the work
of some Paly pranksters, car
ried away by the Hallowe'en
spirit.
