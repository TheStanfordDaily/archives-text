# Sophomores Hire McCoy for Dance
## 
### 
Clyde McCoy and his nationally
famous dance orchestra will play for
the Sophomore Cotillion Friday eve
ning, November 12, in the dance stu
dio of the Women's Gym. This big
name band has just completed its
first west coast engagement at the
Palomar in Los Angeles.
It was so successful that it has
been re-engaged to open there after
Christmas. McCoy won fame in New
York with his sensational trumpet
playing, and his recording of "Su
gar Blues" holds one of the all-time
records for sales.
Sophomore Cotillion will feature
the only big name orchestra at Stan
ford this quarter. For the first time
the dance will be semi-formal in
stead of formal. Bids have been re
duced in price this year to $2.50
and are on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice now.
