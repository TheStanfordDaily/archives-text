NEW YORK. Nov. 1 (UP).â€”Lack
of demand carried the stock market
lower today in a typical pre-holiday
trading session.
Again it was the steel shares which
distressed the market. The weekly
statistics of the American Iron &
Steel Institute showed the week's
operating schedule at 48.6 per cent
of capacity, the lowest operating
rate since the week beginning De
cember 30, 1935.
