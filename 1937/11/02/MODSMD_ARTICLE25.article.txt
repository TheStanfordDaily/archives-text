# Wilbur Approves Opening Of Library Reserve Room For Sunday Night "Trial"
## President's Decision Based on Reports Of Director, Student Committee 
### BILL MILLIS 
The reserve hook room of the Stanford Library will l>e open Sunday
night and for a "trial period" regularly on Sunday nights during the re
mainder of the quarter.
This announcement was made late yesterday afternoon by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, after he had considered two reports on last week's
special library election presented to him by Library Director Nathan Van

>Patten and by Jan North and John
Dern of the A.S.S.U. library com
mittee.
Although he pointed out that only
836 students from a registration of
over 4000 voted in the special elec
tion held last Thursday and Friday,
Dr. Wilbur said that the library re
serve book room will be open for
the rest of the present quarter, in
order to determine from actual ex
perience what use students would
make of the library at that time.
Extra Costs
Additional expenses arising from
the opening of the reserve room for
those hours will be met by the ad
ministration from funds within the
present University budget, Dr. Wil
bur indicated.
Director Van Patten said yester
day that for the remainder of the
quarter the reserve room, the main

reading room, and the loan desk will
all be open in the afternoon from
two to six o'clock, while the reserve
room only will continue to be open
from six to ten o'clock in the eve
ning.
Under the new hours, books taken
out Saturday 'afternoon will be due
back by closing time Sunday night.
Report Told
After presenting a tabulation of
the results of last week's election—
in which 614 stated that their Uni
versity work required access to the
library on Sunday evenings, while
130 said it did not, and 92 were un
certain—Van Patten made the fol
lowing recommendations to Dr.
Wilbur:
1. "That there be no increase in
library hours on Sunday except in
the case of the reserve book room.
2. "That the reserve book room be
kept open between six and ten Sun
day evening, when and if funds are
available and provided that it is
impossible to provide an adequate
study hall elsewhere.
3. "That the use of the library as a
study hall be discouraged as long
as our accommodations remain inad
equate for users of library re
sources."
Cost Set
Actual cost of opening the reserve
book room will be $324 a year for
salaries, lighting, heating, and jani
tor work. Van Patten's report de
clared. This compares to an esti
mated annual cost in excess of $2000
for opening all library departments
on Sunday, which the director de
scribes as "an expense not justified
by either the demand or the bene
fits to be obtained."
Future need of a large study hall
on the campus was foreseen by Van
Patten, who emphasized in his re
port that "the seating capacity of
the library is already inadequate. At
certain periods of the year students
are unable to find accommodation."
The use of the library by students
not making use of library facilities
and merely as a place of study was
criticized by the director as the
cause of crowded library conditions.
Student Report
Conclusions similar to Van Pat
ten's were reached in a separate re
port also presented to President Wil
bur yesterday by Jan North and
John Dern of the A.S.S.U. library
question committee.
Agreeing with the recommenda
tion that only the reserve book room
should be opened, this report said
that the special poll showed a de
mand for the use of the library Sun
day evenings as a place to study and
not for the use of library books.

In 1934 railroads carried 45 per
cent of the automobiles shipped
from factories, 48.8 per cent being
delivered overland.

library on Sunday evenings, while
130 said it did not, and 92 were un
certain—Van Patten made the fol
lowing recommendations to Dr.
Wilbur:
1. "That there be no increase in
library hours on Sunday except in
the case of the reserve book room.
2. "That the reserve book room be
kept open between six and ten Sun
day evening, when and if funds are
available and provided that it is
impossible to provide an adequate
study hall elsewhere.
3. "That the use of the library as a
study hall be discouraged as long
as our accommodations remain inad
equate for users of library re
sources."
Cost Set
Actual cost of opening the reserve
book room will be $324 a year for
salaries, lighting, heating, and jani
tor work. Van Patten's report de
clared. This compares to an esti
mated annual cost in excess of $2000
for opening all library departments
on Sunday, which the director de
scribes as "an expense not justified
by either the demand or the bene
fits to be obtained."
Future need of a large study hall
on the campus was foreseen by Van
Patten, who emphasized in his re
port that "the seating capacity of
the library is already inadequate. At
certain periods of the year students
are unable to find accommodation."
The use of the library by students
not making use of library facilities
and merely as a place of study was
criticized by the director as the
cause of crowded library conditions.
Student Report
Conclusions similar to Van Pat
ten's were reached in a separate re
port also presented to President Wil
bur yesterday by Jan North and
John Dern of the A.S.S.U. library
question committee.
Agreeing with the recommenda
tion that only the reserve book room
should be opened, this report said
that the special poll showed a de
mand for the use of the library Sun
day evenings as a place to study and
not for the use of library books.

In 1934 railroads carried 45 per
cent of the automobiles shipped
from factories, 48.8 per cent being
delivered overland.
The reserve hook room of the Stanford Library will l>e open Sunday
night and for a "trial period" regularly on Sunday nights during the re
mainder of the quarter.
This announcement was made late yesterday afternoon by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, after he had considered two reports on last week's
special library election presented to him by Library Director Nathan Van

>Patten and by Jan North and John
Dern of the A.S.S.U. library com
mittee.
Although he pointed out that only
836 students from a registration of
over 4000 voted in the special elec
tion held last Thursday and Friday,
Dr. Wilbur said that the library re
serve book room will be open for
the rest of the present quarter, in
order to determine from actual ex
perience what use students would
make of the library at that time.
Extra Costs
Additional expenses arising from
the opening of the reserve room for
those hours will be met by the ad
ministration from funds within the
present University budget, Dr. Wil
bur indicated.
Director Van Patten said yester
day that for the remainder of the
quarter the reserve room, the main

reading room, and the loan desk will
all be open in the afternoon from
two to six o'clock, while the reserve
room only will continue to be open
from six to ten o'clock in the eve
ning.
Under the new hours, books taken
out Saturday 'afternoon will be due
back by closing time Sunday night.
