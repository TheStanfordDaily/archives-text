# Tiny Taken By Rubber Check As 'Pal' Flees
## 
### 
Ball players gazed with guilty
faces yesterday as Officer Fletcher
of the Palo Alto police force went
into a mysterious huddle with
Coach Tiny Thornhill.
They were greatly relieved when
they discovered that none of them
was being searched for—the hunted
man was Tiny himself. And the
whole affair centered around Ivan B.
Sinclair of Philadelphia, Penn.
It seems that Mr. Sinclair knew
Don Harrison, a Stanford student,
who had been athletic director at
the University of Pennsylvania, and
had moved in on Mr. Harrison as a
house guest last week-end. And
through Harrison, Sinclair met
Thornhill.
Tiny did not hesitate to do a good
deed for the visitor when friend
Ivan asked the varsity grid mentor
to cash a $75 check for him. Well,
the check was no good; Ivan has
disappeared; and Tiny is stuck for
75 stones —perhaps.
Officer Fletcher arrested a man in
a Packard from Pennsylvania Sat
urday, collected a fine, and Mr.
Sinclair drove away with of
$75 spent. But Officer Fletcher has
the Philadelphian's address.
The check bounced yesterday, and
Fletcher rushed to the football field
to check with Thornhill. So while
he rebuilds his offense this week,
Coach Thornhill may have to put up
a good defense to save himself $75.
