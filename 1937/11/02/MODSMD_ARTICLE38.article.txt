EDIT-BIZ STAFF
FEUD STARTS Ad AIN
The old fueding comes up again
between the edit staff of the Dippy
and the Biz staff.
Every year Stanford goes south
for a little football encountering
with either the Bruins of U.C.L.A.
or the Trojans of U.S.C. With every
southern game the sports editor be
gins dreaming about a trip down to
L.A. to cover the doings for the
Farm sheet.
Ilut every year the head of the
business staff shakes his head
firmly in the negative and the poor
hard-working sports ed starts ex
ercising his thumb to prepare it
for the ordeal of hitch hiking to
the southern metropolis.
This year was no exception, as I
soon found out when I wandered
into Lang Swent's office in the shack
prepared to do a little pleading for
what I still maintain is a just cause.
DON'T ESTABLISH A
PRECEDENT—THAT'S BAD
The Daily is making money —
Swent is making money—and ev
erybody is happy—with the excep
tion of yours truly. It seems that
Mr. Swent, backed up by the ailing
Chuck Fontius, doesn't want to es
tablish a precedent of paying the
sports editor's way down south.
By sending me this tim«, it
would be starting a precedent—
and that would be bad. No mat
ter how much money the Daily is
making, never give the sports ed a
little jaunt to L.A. for all the work
he does during the volume —no,
never, thai would be unheard of.
The band members will be mak
ing the trip southward for the Tro
jan game this week-end with all
expenses paid, including five dol
lars expense money. Even the rally
committee will be going . . . but
yours truly will stagger down at his
own expense and probably pay for
the freight on the game story to be
sent up for Monday's paper.
Stanford should take a lesson from
some of the other coast college pa
pers . . . the Uclans sent up not
one man to the Stanford game—but
four, and they all wired stories down
to the Daily Bruin.
BURD EMITS A
BIRD FOR CHRONICLE
The Daily Cal's assistant editor,
John Burd, emits a lusty bird for
the S.F. Chronicle sports section. It
seems the Chronicle writers are al
ways picking on poor little Cal over
in the Berkeley bushes.
According to Burd, the S.F. pa
pers, the Chronicle in particular,
always panning everything in
connection with the Bear football
team. And when Buid says every
thing ... he means everything
from the water boy to the Daily
Cal.
Burd quotes a Cal alumnus'
twisted idea of the Chronicle set-up,
and I'm going to take the liberty of
requoting here .... it's really
funny.
"The campagin of superlative ad
jectives initiated by Mr. W. F.
Lioser, associate sports editor of the
S.F. Chonicle, was undoubtedly in
tended to react adversely on the
California squad.
"Mr. Brick Morse must realize that
his position on the Chronicle is
maintained merely as a sop to regu
lar readers who happen to be Cali
fornia alumni.
"William Lieser, Tom Irwin, and
Dick Friendlich are all Stanford
graduates. Harry B. Smith, the so
called sports editor, is a rabid Stan
ford partisan, and the feature writer,
Mr. Dink Templeton, is a hired
hand from Stanford University."
That reasoning is a little childish,
don't you think? Especially in view
of the fact that all the city papers,
including the Chronicle, have played
Cal to the skies. Farm fans have to
turn to sonic- inside page down near
the bottom somewhere to find out
what Stanford has been doing.

Swent is making money—and ev
erybody is happy—with the excep
tion of yours truly. It seems that
Mr. Swent, backed up by the ailing
Chuck Fontius, doesn't want to es
tablish a precedent of paying the
sports editor's way down south.
By sending me this tim«, it
would be starting a precedent—
and that would be bad. No mat
ter how much money the Daily is
making, never give the sports ed a
little jaunt to L.A. for all the work
he does during the volume —no,
never, thai would be unheard of.
The band members will be mak
ing the trip southward for the Tro

expenses paid, including five dol

yours truly will stagger down at his
own expense and probably pay for
the freight on the game story to be
sent up for Monday's paper.
Stanford should take a lesson from
some of the other coast college pa
pers . . . the Uclans sent up not
one man to the Stanford game—but
four, and they all wired stories down
to the Daily Bruin.
BURD EMITS A
BIRD FOR CHRONICLE
The Daily Cal's assistant editor,
John Burd, emits a lusty bird for
the S.F. Chronicle sports section. It
seems the Chronicle writers are al
ways picking on poor little Cal over
in the Berkeley bushes.
According to Burd, the S.F. pa
pers, the Chronicle in particular,
always panning everything in
connection with the Bear football
team. And when Buid says every
thing ... he means everything
from the water boy to the Daily
Cal.
Burd quotes a Cal alumnus'
twisted idea of the Chronicle set-up,
and I'm going to take the liberty of
requoting here .... it's really
funny.
"The campagin of superlative ad
jectives initiated by Mr. W. F.
Lioser, associate sports editor of the
S.F. Chonicle, was undoubtedly in
tended to react adversely on the
California squad.
"Mr. Brick Morse must realize that
his position on the Chronicle is
maintained merely as a sop to regu
lar readers who happen to be Cali
fornia alumni.
"William Lieser, Tom Irwin, and
Dick Friendlich are all Stanford
graduates. Harry B. Smith, the so
called sports editor, is a rabid Stan
ford partisan, and the feature writer,
Mr. Dink Templeton, is a hired
hand from Stanford University."
That reasoning is a little childish,
don't you think? Especially in view
of the fact that all the city papers,
including the Chronicle, have played
Cal to the skies. Farm fans have to
turn to sonic- inside page down near
the bottom somewhere to find out
what Stanford has been doing.

Ilut every year the head of the

hard-working sports ed starts ex
