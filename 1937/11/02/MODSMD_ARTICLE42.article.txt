# Water Polo Squad Chosen for Trip
## 
### 
Twelve water polo men were se
lected by Coach Nort Thornton to
travel to Los Angeles this week-end
for games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.
On these two crucial tilts rest what
chances Stanford has for a success
ful defense of its Coast Conference
championship.
A double win will put the Cards
back in for another shot at the title,
with California the chief obstacle in
their path. A loss in either meeting
will knock the Cards into the league
cellar basement.
Thornton's new offensive thrusts
seem to be in top form and with
hard work scheduled all week might
possibly accomplish the double
killing.
Tentative traveling squad in
cludes Captain Bill Hanna, Johnny
Lamb, Harv Rothschild, Bob Plate,
Bill Hatch, Dick Hoover, Bill Burns,
Jack Vibert, Lloyd Wilson, Bob Al
len, Senior Manager Jack Ellis, and
Junior Manager Perry Chisum.
