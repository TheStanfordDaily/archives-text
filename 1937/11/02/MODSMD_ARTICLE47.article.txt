# Papooses Set For Cal Game Here Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's Papoose pigskinners
knocked over San Mateo J. C. 20-0
Saturday while Cal was lucky to
beat them 7-4 a few weeks ago, but
that doesn't prove that the frosh will
beat the Cubs in the Little Big
Game here Saturday.
Although Stanford's backfield is
in perfect shape for the first time
this year and the whole team showed
great improvement Saturday, they're
going to have a tough game against
the Berkeley lads.
Frosh May Win
Clint Evans has a knack of put
ting out a first-rate eleven every
year. He has done it this year.
When his men played San Mateo,
San Mateo was at its top form.
Against Stanford three of their first
string men were out all or part of
the game, and the team was gen
erally demoralized.
But in the San Mateo game, the
frosh proved that if they can play a
whole game against Cal as they did
in spurts Saturday, they can and
should win.
Braheny, Meiners Ready
Of the three men injured Satur
day, Line Captain Chick Orme is the
only one who may not see action
against the Cubs. Bill Braheny and
Arnold Meiners both will be ready
to play.
Tonight the frosh will scrimmage
against Cal plays. Last night they
worked on their passing attack,
smoothing out the rough spots ob
vious in last week's game.
