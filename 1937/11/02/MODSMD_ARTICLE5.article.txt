# Sophs to Get Board Refund From Encina
## 
### 
Breakage and board refunds to
all students living in Encina last
year will be made tomorrow after
noon from 1 to 5:30 o'clock in the
Encina office.
Encina breakage deposit refunds
of $1.30 per person will be paid to
those who lived in the dormitories
three quarters.
Board refunds of $10 will go to
those who took their meals at En
cina Commons during spring quar
ter, and who paid the full amount
of $85. Holders of the $70 meal
books will receive $8.25.
Students who have already re
ceived spring quarter board refunds
because of illness or other absence
will get a pro rata deduction from
this refund.
Total refunds for the quarter
amount to about $4000, bringing the
individual refund for the academic
year 1936-37 to $35.
This amount is larger than usual,
because more men ate at Encina
Commons than during the previous
year.
All who are entitled to refunds
must appear in person, including
members of El Cuadro, Los Arcos,
El Capitan, and El Tigre. Receipts
are not necessary.
