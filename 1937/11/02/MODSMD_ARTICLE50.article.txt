# Card Team Loses Polo Tussle 12-6
## 
### 
Card horsemen lost for the first
time this season last Friday on the
highway polo field when they were
defeated 12-6 by the San Mateo Pole
Club. The Indians played a hard rid
ing game and probably owe their
defeat to inferior mounts.
High score man for the Cards was
Captain Jim Fullerton riding at
number 1 with three goals. Captain
Pope of the Peninsula team riding
at number three was high man for
his squad with five goals.
Other Farm men who saw action
were Don McAusland, number 2;
Bob Wallace, number 3; and Bert
McClintock, number 4. Steve Down
ey went in at the second chukker
for Wallace.
