WHEN the doors of the Stanford Library fail
to click shut next Sunday evening at six,
those who are benefited by the lengthened
hours may thank what we tritely call the ma
chinery of student government, which, in this
case, substantiates the theory that such a ma
chine, though sometimes unwieldy, is not a
farcical pile of junk.
It felt the pulse of campus opinion and
thought it found a beat of unrest concerning the
hours set for the library. It investigated, estab
lished its suspicion, and through the accepted
channels reported its findings to the powers
that be. There was nothing very sensational
about the whole thing, except that student gov
ernment worked.

It was unusual, however, and gratifying, that
student interest should be focused on a problem
so academic in nature. Building niteries and
granting dates for campus entertainment has
been generally considered "meat" for the mills
of campus government. When a problem so
intimately linked with the reason for having the
University —hours of study—tackled, such ac
tion is a healthy step in the right direction.
"Victory" is hardly the correct word to be
used in connection with the opening of the
Stanford Library on Sunday nights.
But because it met the co-operation of the
authorities, did its work efficiently and thor
oughly, and brought a quick decision, student
government may boast an "accomplishment."
