HE wasn't well known among the students,
his work at the University wasn't that sort.
Even athletes knew little of the man who
played such an important part in building up
the sports in which they were engaged, and
who was so sympathetic to their point of view.
But Dick Barrett was the sort of man that his
friends, from student B.A.C. members to busi
ness associates, described in superlatives. "Per
fectly balanced, perfectly unselfish . . ."
"He worked for Stanford in spite of an ex
tremely busy private life. I don't see how he
had time to do all that he did," said one friend.
Even a hurried San Francisco News reporter
would write no ordinary story of Dick Barrett's
death. Instead he fashioned one that may be
used as a model in journalism textbooks.
Dick Barrett's work for Stanford was behind
the scenes. He worked for that part of the Uni
versity which the student seldom sees. But the
"feel" of his work was unconsciously known by
all, and Dick Barrett will be missed in the Stan
ford scene.â€”L. L.
