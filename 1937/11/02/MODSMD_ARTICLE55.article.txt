NINE hundred Stanford students will drive
the equivalent of thirty-six times around the
world this week-end.
Thirty-six times around the world will mean
little more than a joyful jaunt to a Los Angeles
football game for the majority of the travelers,
but for a few it may become a doleful funeral
march.
Last year Stanford was lucky. The annual
trek south rolled by with two injuries, no
deaths. Perhaps this was not all luck, but an
unusual display of common sense on the part
of the Stanford drivers. Luck or skill, the law
of averages gives Stanford a slim chance oL
another accidentless pilgrimage.

Many of the students who tour south Friday
will be returning home for the week-end, but
others will be going solely for the party, party.
They will boom, possibly d and then
start back for Stanford with bleary eyes and
halved reaction-times. Quite possibly they will
arrive in one piece, but there may be some who
will not return.
This warning may be traditional and trite. But
think about it.
Next week someone might not be reading
warnings—traditional or trite.—J. R.
No wonder there is a lot of knowledge in the
colleges—the freshmen always bring a little in
and the seniors never take any away.—Abbott

Education makes people easy to lead but dif
