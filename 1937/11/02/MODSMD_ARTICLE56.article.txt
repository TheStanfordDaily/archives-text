WRONG NUMBER
I f EADING Ihc list of those annoyances that put
iron into tender souls and skim the milk of human
kindness is the University telephone system. This
nuisance has blighted so many budding romances and
has shattered so many friendships that mention of it
will make any student sound off like a Dos Passos
hero. Most undergraduates find that phoning a pal
in one of the dormitories is about as practical as a
chat with Napoleon via the ouija board.
Under the present system it takes something
comparable to a writ of habeas corpus to establish con
tact wtih a man in Toyon; and nothing but pony
express can get word into the Encina hinterland. Row
men who want to get an assignment from a Branner
.sidekick camp on the telephone and chew their finger
nails half the evening, while brothers stalk back and
forth past them, thinking unbrotherly thoughts.

And even when the connection has been estab
lished the ordeal continues. The switchboard operator
answers, says he'll buzz the party and retires from
the scene. The caller squirms, wondering if the oper
ator has been murdered and if he'll have to testify
to the last words.
Finally, after getting half of Encina, the dog pound,
and three janitors, caller makes connection with
callee, via a sort of central pool where all conversa
tion is mixed. Tender whispers meant for Roble
are routed to the man who wants his assignment; and
terse character sketches of professors make shell-like
cars burn in Lagunita.

4 LL this is beautifully communistic in spirit, and is
doubtless very educating. Knowing that somebody
loves somebody else gladdens a pessimistic heart, un
fortunately it is not the best substitute for a term
paper or a stat problem.
And, as mentioned above, true love has a rough
enough course without hurdling switchboards. When
somebody's darling is going to be an hour late, it
helps if he can let the somebody know. More than
one romance has sunk without a trace while the
hero's call was wandering about somewhere in the
casas.

What the solution should be, I cannot tell. The
telephone company employs talented men with lots
of degrees to solve just such problems. Possibly a
larger switchboard would help; a second board might
make things easier.
And so I would suggest that we ask the telephone
company to turn a couple of their brilliant boys loose
on the Stanford exchanges. At present the only calls
that go through without agony are those to the presi
dent and the dean of men. But after all it doesn't do
much good to chat with the president when you want
a date. And it isn't fair to expect the dean to know
what the psych assignment is.
Of course, it isn't exactly a vital problem. Our
sandstone walls won't crumble if it isn't settled imme
diately. But if we don't get action before long, some
of our more restive students are going to apply for
search warrants and hunt the men they want with
bloodhounds,
