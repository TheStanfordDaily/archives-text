My dear Sir Mr. Editor:
I am putting off writing you about
something long enough now. I can
no longer keep it down. It is both
ering me for several days, and I
would like that you should give me
good explanation, I wish will you?
Every time I try think for reason,
I became at a non compos mentis
standstill, which she make me very
sad you can understand?
Here is what as it happened. My
lovely Gertrude, I park her on the
street one night, and what do she
have on her windshield when I
come back, I can't understand. A
little sign with two words on it, and
that's what I would like that you
should tell me about please. The
sign she say WAX WASHINGTON.
Please Mr. Sir Editor, will you tell
me one thing who is this guy WAX
WASHINGTON? I have try think
hard who can it be, who can it be.
I say to myself I must no act dumb,
I must no act dumb. Many other
people have same thing on their
windshield, and so I just think I no
ask a nobody and figure it out by
myself. But I no seem can do that
I find it seems. Can you tell me
please?
A Politician
I figure one night late in bed that
maybe this guy is some politician
guy; but when I wonder if he is
why he no put when to vote for
him on little sign, and I say to my
self no he isn't politician.
One day I think I very smart and
I think maybe that WAX WASH
INGTON is some kind of wax for
Gertrude, and that the sign she mix
up and should say WASHINGTON
WAX. So I think I see, and I go
to hardware store and I say I want
some WASHINGTON WAX, and
what you think it happens? Every
one laugh and think I make big
joke, but alia same big joke on I,
cause I'm not know what everyone
laugh about. But I make laugh any
way, and walk back to my Ger
trude.
Too Much Bang
One night I take a little too much
bang water and I ask somebody who
is this guy WAX WASHINGTON,
and they all look very serious in
the face and tell me that he is big
strong husky dog, but no one fool
me bang water or no bang water,
and I no believe him cause I think
dogs don't have names like WAX
WASHINGTON. So I am still in
non compos mentis standstill, and
then I think how fine man you are,
and maybe you be good and tell me
who is this guy WAX WASHING
TON. Then I think too this good
idea cause nobody know how much
dumb I am if I write and not ask
with my mouth.
I would thank you a great many
if you would be so good that you
should be telling me who is this
person. If you no tell me I must
guess I drink heap more bang water
and try find out that way again.
Then people think maybe I not so
dumb—just too much bang water,
but that is hard way, and bang
water make me feel hurt next day
in head. Can you please tell me.
Thank you very much.

Some one possessed of an excru
ciatingly witty flare has seen fit to
make off with a badly needed bi
cycle as a manifestation of his abil
ity to rise to the occasion of Hal
lowe'en.
If he will replace it in front of
the Cellar as soon as he has done
laughing I should be much obliged.

INGTON is some kind of wax for
Gertrude, and that the sign she mix
up and should say WASHINGTON
WAX. So I think I see, and I go
to hardware store and I say I want
some WASHINGTON WAX, and
what you think it happens? Every
one laugh and think I make big
joke, but alia same big joke on I,
cause I'm not know what everyone
laugh about. But I make laugh any
way, and walk back to my Ger
trude.
Too Much Bang
One night I take a little too much
bang water and I ask somebody who
is this guy WAX WASHINGTON,
and they all look very serious in
the face and tell me that he is big
strong husky dog, but no one fool
me bang water or no bang water,
and I no believe him cause I think
dogs don't have names like WAX
WASHINGTON. So I am still in
non compos mentis standstill, and
then I think how fine man you are,
and maybe you be good and tell me
who is this guy WAX WASHING
TON. Then I think too this good
idea cause nobody know how much
dumb I am if I write and not ask
with my mouth.
I would thank you a great many
if you would be so good that you
should be telling me who is this
person. If you no tell me I must
guess I drink heap more bang water
and try find out that way again.
Then people think maybe I not so
dumb—just too much bang water,
but that is hard way, and bang
water make me feel hurt next day
in head. Can you please tell me.
Thank you very much.

My dear Sir Mr. Editor:
I am putting off writing you about
something long enough now. I can
no longer keep it down. It is both
ering me for several days, and I
would like that you should give me
good explanation, I wish will you?
Every time I try think for reason,
I became at a non compos mentis
standstill, which she make me very
sad you can understand?
Here is what as it happened. My
lovely Gertrude, I park her on the
street one night, and what do she
have on her windshield when I
come back, I can't understand. A
little sign with two words on it, and
that's what I would like that you
should tell me about please. The
sign she say WAX WASHINGTON.
Please Mr. Sir Editor, will you tell
me one thing who is this guy WAX
WASHINGTON? I have try think
hard who can it be, who can it be.
I say to myself I must no act dumb,
I must no act dumb. Many other
people have same thing on their
windshield, and so I just think I no
ask a nobody and figure it out by
myself. But I no seem can do that
I find it seems. Can you tell me
please?
A Politician
I figure one night late in bed that
maybe this guy is some politician
guy; but when I wonder if he is
why he no put when to vote for

One day I think I very smart and
I think maybe that WAX WASH
INGTON is some kind of wax for
Gertrude, and that the sign she mix
up and should say WASHINGTON
WAX. So I think I see, and I go
to hardware store and I say I want
