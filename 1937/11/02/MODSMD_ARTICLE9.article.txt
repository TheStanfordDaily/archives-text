# Slides To Show African Plants
## Lecturer Will Discuss Adventures Tonight 
### 
A raconteur of adventure and
travel, Lionel E. Taylor will discuss
"Plant Hunting in South Africa" at
the Tuesday Evening Series tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in Memorial Hall.
The travelogue will be illustrated
by natural color slides prepared by
Taylor. Traveling over 12,000 miles
by caravan during 1935 and 1936,
Taylor headed an expedition, during
which he took photographs to illus
trate the scenery, flora and fauna,
and native life of Africa.
Chief purpose of the expedition
was to collect information on the
flora which would be of interest to
horticulturists in California, where
many African plants are being
grown. Over 15,000 plants were col
lected and identified at the botan
ical centers of Kirstenbosch and
Pretoria. Taylor will talk with stu
dents and faculty after the lecture
in the Green Room.
Taylor will tell the audience of
his adventures as "plant hunter,"
describe the natural life and native
civilization in South Africa. The
lecturer is held under the auspices of
the Committee on Public Exercises.
