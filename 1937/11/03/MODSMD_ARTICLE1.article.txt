# Excom Limits Use of Gym Dance Studio
## Pryor Shows Necessity Of Resurfacing Floor Following All Dances 
### JIM STONE 
By JIM STONE

Only dances too large to be held
on the main floor of the Women's
Gym will be allowed the use of
the dance studio, Ex Committee
ruled last night.
Dr. Helen Pryor, director of
physical education and medical ad
viser of women, presented the prob
lem involved in the use of the
Women's Gym to Ex Committee,
saying that the gym was conceived
to fulfill a two-fold purpose: that
of a recreation and of an athletic
center.
Difficulty Shown
Chief difficulty with the use of the
d..nce studio for dances is that so
much damage is done to the spec
ially surfaced floor that it is neces
sary to refinish it after each affair.
Since the floor is specially con
structed with the soft finish re
quired for barefoot dancing ' cur
ricula, hard soled shoes do a great
deal of damage to the floor. She
offered several remedies to the
problem, such as surfacing the floor
with waxed canvas for dances, or
the possible use of the Memorial
Hall stage for dances.
It was pointed out, however, that
only one dance, the Interfraternity
Formal, is too large to be held on
the main floor, and requires the use
of the dance studio as well.
Reasons Given
Chief reasons for use of the latter
for dances is that it is smaller, more
attractive, easier and cheaper to
decorate. During the last year, sev
en dances were held in the dance
studio, requiring a x-efinish job each
time.
In discussion following Dr. Pry
or's statements, it was pointed out
that no immediate problem is faced,
since the Soph Cotillion will be held
in the main room. After further
rehash of Dr. Pryor's suggestions,
a motion was carried that no fur
ther dances be held in the dance
studio unless their size definitely
necessitated the move.
Hawaiian Club: Bill Ward, speak
ing for the Hawaiian Club, asked if
it would be possible to reserve the
Nitery exclusively for its meetings
every other Sunday night. Last Sun
day's meeting was held in the Nit
cry, and the club was bothered in
iis hulu-ing by interested spectators,
attracted by the strum of Hawaiian
guitars.
After considerable discussion the
request was refused. It was felt
that the Nitery could not fill its pri
mary purpose as all-campus recrea
tion center, if a certain group were
allowed to use it to the exclusion of
others.
In response to the statement that
il would kill the Nitery, Ward point
ed out that "the Nitery is already
dead." Ex Committee ruled that
campus groups were free to hold
meetings in the Nitery, but could
not exclude others from coming in.
University of Hawaii: Arthur
Chun, business graduate at Stan
ford nad student body president of
the University of Hawaii two years
ago, spoke to Ex Committee con
cerning the coming game with the
university during Christmas vaca
tion. He particularly urged stimu
lating student interest in the game.
"Hawaiian students are very in
tei*ested in the student response at
football games — the cheering,
bands, card stunts, and all of the oth
er local color." In order to give
Hawaiian students this part of the
game which is lacking, he suggested
making phonograph recordings of
the yells and songs, photographs of
the rooters' stands to send with
the team.
Chun also spoke of the possibil
ity of having the game broadcast,
and suggested that Ex Committee
exert whatever pressure it might
have on Associated Oil Company in
order to assure the broadcast of the
game. "It might be possible to run
records during the broadcast, and
thus add much to the whole affair,"
he said.
"The University of Hawaii is anx
ious to further friendly relations be
tween the two chools," Chun point
ed out," and such actions would do
much to further these relations."
But don't do anything that will start
a precedent," he warned.
By-laws change: By-laws of the
Constitution forbid dramatic func
tions on any nights except Friday
and Saturday. As this will conflict
with the already successful Sunday
night movies, a committee of Jean
Reynolds and Tom Killefer next
week is to suggest change of the
byvlaws to avoid conflict.
5.1. P.R.: The Student Institute of
Pacific Relations will meet at Napa
during Thanksgiving vacation.
Stanford always sends two or three
delegates, who pay their own way
to the conference. It also annually
contributes $25 to the Institute's
funds. Ex Committee granted this
amount to be sent to the conference.
Quad Photo Contest: The Quad
was granted the use of the Trophy
Case in the Union Cellar to display
entries in their photography con
test.
Dates granted: Toyon Club, after
noon of November 20; Encina Club,
December 3; Debate, November 18.

University of Hawaii: Arthur
Chun, business graduate at Stan
ford nad student body president of
the University of Hawaii two years
ago, spoke to Ex Committee con
cerning the coming game with the
university during Christmas vaca
tion. He particularly urged stimu
lating student interest in the game.
"Hawaiian students are very in
tei*ested in the student response at
football games — the cheering,
bands, card stunts, and all of the oth
er local color." In order to give
Hawaiian students this part of the
game which is lacking, he suggested
making phonograph recordings of
the yells and songs, photographs of
the rooters' stands to send with
the team.
Chun also spoke of the possibil
ity of having the game broadcast,
and suggested that Ex Committee
exert whatever pressure it might
have on Associated Oil Company in
order to assure the broadcast of the
game. "It might be possible to run
records during the broadcast, and
thus add much to the whole affair,"
he said.
"The University of Hawaii is anx
ious to further friendly relations be
tween the two chools," Chun point
ed out," and such actions would do
much to further these relations."
But don't do anything that will start
a precedent," he warned.
By-laws change: By-laws of the
Constitution forbid dramatic func

with the already successful Sunday
night movies, a committee of Jean
Reynolds and Tom Killefer next

byvlaws to avoid conflict.

Only dances too large to be held
on the main floor of the Women's
Gym will be allowed the use of
the dance studio, Ex Committee
ruled last night.
Dr. Helen Pryor, director of
physical education and medical ad
viser of women, presented the prob
lem involved in the use of the
Women's Gym to Ex Committee,
saying that the gym was conceived
to fulfill a two-fold purpose: that
of a recreation and of an athletic
center.
Difficulty Shown
Chief difficulty with the use of the
d..nce studio for dances is that so
much damage is done to the spec
ially surfaced floor that it is neces
sary to refinish it after each affair.
Since the floor is specially con
structed with the soft finish re
quired for barefoot dancing ' cur
ricula, hard soled shoes do a great
deal of damage to the floor. She
offered several remedies to the
problem, such as surfacing the floor
with waxed canvas for dances, or
the possible use of the Memorial
Hall stage for dances.
It was pointed out, however, that
only one dance, the Interfraternity
Formal, is too large to be held on
the main floor, and requires the use
of the dance studio as well.
Reasons Given
Chief reasons for use of the latter
for dances is that it is smaller, more
attractive, easier and cheaper to
decorate. During the last year, sev
en dances were held in the dance
studio, requiring a x-efinish job each
time.
In discussion following Dr. Pry
or's statements, it was pointed out
that no immediate problem is faced,
since the Soph Cotillion will be held
in the main room. After further
rehash of Dr. Pryor's suggestions,
a motion was carried that no fur
ther dances be held in the dance
studio unless their size definitely
necessitated the move.
Hawaiian Club: Bill Ward, speak
ing for the Hawaiian Club, asked if
it would be possible to reserve the
Nitery exclusively for its meetings
every other Sunday night. Last Sun
day's meeting was held in the Nit
cry, and the club was bothered in
iis hulu-ing by interested spectators,
attracted by the strum of Hawaiian
guitars.
After considerable discussion the
request was refused. It was felt
that the Nitery could not fill its pri
mary purpose as all-campus recrea
tion center, if a certain group were
allowed to use it to the exclusion of
others.
In response to the statement that
il would kill the Nitery, Ward point
ed out that "the Nitery is already
dead." Ex Committee ruled that
campus groups were free to hold
meetings in the Nitery, but could
not exclude others from coming in.

much damage is done to the spec
ially surfaced floor that it is neces
sary to refinish it after each affair.
Since the floor is specially con
structed with the soft finish re
quired for barefoot dancing ' cur
ricula, hard soled shoes do a great
deal of damage to the floor. She
offered several remedies to the
problem, such as surfacing the floor
with waxed canvas for dances, or
the possible use of the Memorial
Hall stage for dances.
It was pointed out, however, that
only one dance, the Interfraternity
Formal, is too large to be held on
the main floor, and requires the use
of the dance studio as well.
Reasons Given
Chief reasons for use of the latter
for dances is that it is smaller, more
attractive, easier and cheaper to
decorate. During the last year, sev
en dances were held in the dance
studio, requiring a x-efinish job each
time.
In discussion following Dr. Pry
or's statements, it was pointed out
that no immediate problem is faced,
since the Soph Cotillion will be held
in the main room. After further
rehash of Dr. Pryor's suggestions,
a motion was carried that no fur
ther dances be held in the dance
studio unless their size definitely
necessitated the move.
Hawaiian Club: Bill Ward, speak
ing for the Hawaiian Club, asked if
it would be possible to reserve the
Nitery exclusively for its meetings
every other Sunday night. Last Sun
day's meeting was held in the Nit
cry, and the club was bothered in
iis hulu-ing by interested spectators,
attracted by the strum of Hawaiian
guitars.
After considerable discussion the
request was refused. It was felt
that the Nitery could not fill its pri
mary purpose as all-campus recrea
tion center, if a certain group were
allowed to use it to the exclusion of
others.
In response to the statement that
il would kill the Nitery, Ward point
ed out that "the Nitery is already
dead." Ex Committee ruled that
campus groups were free to hold
meetings in the Nitery, but could
not exclude others from coming in.
University of Hawaii: Arthur
Chun, business graduate at Stan
ford nad student body president of
the University of Hawaii two years
ago, spoke to Ex Committee con
cerning the coming game with the
university during Christmas vaca
tion. He particularly urged stimu
lating student interest in the game.
"Hawaiian students are very in
tei*ested in the student response at
football games — the cheering,
bands, card stunts, and all of the oth
er local color." In order to give
Hawaiian students this part of the
game which is lacking, he suggested
making phonograph recordings of
the yells and songs, photographs of
the rooters' stands to send with
the team.
Chun also spoke of the possibil
ity of having the game broadcast,
and suggested that Ex Committee
exert whatever pressure it might
have on Associated Oil Company in
order to assure the broadcast of the
game. "It might be possible to run
records during the broadcast, and
thus add much to the whole affair,"
he said.
"The University of Hawaii is anx
ious to further friendly relations be
tween the two chools," Chun point
ed out," and such actions would do
much to further these relations."
But don't do anything that will start
a precedent," he warned.
By-laws change: By-laws of the
Constitution forbid dramatic func
tions on any nights except Friday
and Saturday. As this will conflict
with the already successful Sunday
night movies, a committee of Jean
Reynolds and Tom Killefer next
week is to suggest change of the
byvlaws to avoid conflict.

Only dances too large to be held
on the main floor of the Women's
Gym will be allowed the use of
the dance studio, Ex Committee
ruled last night.
Dr. Helen Pryor, director of
physical education and medical ad
viser of women, presented the prob
lem involved in the use of the
Women's Gym to Ex Committee,
saying that the gym was conceived
to fulfill a two-fold purpose: that
of a recreation and of an athletic
center.
