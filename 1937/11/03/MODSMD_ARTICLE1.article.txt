# Excom Limits Use of Gym Dance Studio
## Pryor Shows Necessity Of Resurfacing Floor Following All Dances 
### JIM STONE 
By JIM STONE

Only dances too large to be held
on the main floor of the Women's
Gym will be allowed the use of
the dance studio, Ex Committee
ruled last night.
Dr. Helen Pryor, director of
physical education and medical ad
viser of women, presented the prob
lem involved in the use of the
Women's Gym to Ex Committee,
saying that the gym was conceived
to fulfill a two-fold purpose: that
of a recreation and of an athletic
center.
Difficulty Shown
Chief difficulty with the use of the
d..nce studio for dances is that so
much damage is done to the spec
ially surfaced floor that it is neces
sary to refinish it after each affair.
Since the floor is specially con
structed with the soft finish re
quired for barefoot dancing ' cur
ricula, hard soled shoes do a great
deal of damage to the floor. She
offered several remedies to the
problem, such as surfacing the floor
with waxed canvas for dances, or
the possible use of the Memorial
Hall stage for dances.
It was pointed out, however, that
only one dance, the Interfraternity
Formal, is too large to be held on
the main floor, and requires the use
of the dance studio as well.
Reasons Given
Chief reasons for use of the latter
for dances is that it is smaller, more
attractive, easier and cheaper to
decorate. During the last year, sev
en dances were held in the dance
studio, requiring a x-efinish job each
time.
In discussion following Dr. Pry
or's statements, it was pointed out
that no immediate problem is faced,
since the Soph Cotillion will be held
in the main room. After further
rehash of Dr. Pryor's suggestions,
a motion was carried that no fur
ther dances be held in the dance
studio unless their size definitely
necessitated the move.
Hawaiian Club: Bill Ward, speak
ing for the Hawaiian Club, asked if
it would be possible to reserve the
Nitery exclusively for its meetings
every other Sunday night. Last Sun
day's meeting was held in the Nit
cry, and the club was bothered in
iis hulu-ing by interested spectators,
attracted by the strum of Hawaiian
guitars.
After considerable discussion the
request was refused. It was felt
that the Nitery could not fill its pri
mary purpose as all-campus recrea
tion center, if a certain group were
allowed to use it to the exclusion of
others.
In response to the statement that
il would kill the Nitery, Ward point
ed out that "the Nitery is already
dead." Ex Committee ruled that
campus groups were free to hold
meetings in the Nitery, but could
not exclude others from coming in.
