Servants Remembered
It told of a quiet, unspectacular
man who never sought to impress
upon others the importance of his
position, who never was too pre
occupied to neglect the needs of
those associated with him, who con
sidered a small circle of close friends
his greatest asset, and who felt re
sponsible to a vast number of ac
quaintances and lesser friends who
passed his way each day.
His employes, club servants, jani
tors, elevator boys, clerks, stewards,
chefs, maids, Chinese house and bus
boys, all were remembered in be
quests ranging from $500 to $10,000.
Carson was 60 years old. He died
of a heart ailment last Friday.
