LONDON, Nov. 2 (UP). — Italian
and German anger against Foi'eign
Secretary Anthony Eden as a x-esult
of his warning to Premier Benito
Mussolini to keep out of the German
colonial controversy, tonight led to
diplomatic px-edictions that Germany
was preparing—with Fascist suppoi-t
—to l'epudiate the last shx*eds of the
Versailles Treaty.
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler was under
stood to be considering repudiation
of the xnandate system under which
her vast war-lost colonies were dis
tributed among victorious allied
powers.
Many diplomats believed Hitler
would announce the repudiation be
fore a special session of the Reich
stag and that Italy would give offi
cial x'ecognition to Germany's de
fiance.
Dispatches from Berlin said Hitler
probably would base his repudiation
on a contention that present admin
istration of the former German
colonies under League of Nations
mandates is not legally valid.
