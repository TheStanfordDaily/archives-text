# OBSERVERS KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON ELECTIONS

WASHINGTON. Nov. 2 (U.R).â€”Re
election of Mayor Fiorello LaGuar
dia of New York by an indicated
400,000 majority rendered a body
blow to Tammany tonight that may
have significant repercussions in the
next presidential election.
Political observers also viewed
closely final results of mayoralty
elections in Detroit; Canton, Ohio;
and Akron, Ohio, where organized
labor factions tested their strength
as political units.
New Deal Still Strong
Various city elections, particularly
in the East, showed no indications
of waning Democratic party strength.
While administration leaders inter
preted local results as favorable to
the party nationally, in many in
stances they admitted Rosevelt's
policies played little or no part in the
contests.
'Trend' Is Slight
The "trend," if any, was slight in
scattered elections in 15 states. Some
12,500,000 citizens were estimated to
have participated in the ofT-year
elections.
General balloting was uneventful
except in "bloody Harlan" County,
Kentucky, where national guards
men were called out by Governor A.
B. Chandler to supervise the count
ing of returns.
Labor in Spotlight
Ranking second to New York
City was the mayoralty race in De
troit where, for the first time, or
ganized labor was making an inde
pendent political attempt to win con
trol of the government of a major
city.
The A.F.L. and C.1.0. widened
their current vendetta by sponsor
ing rival candidates for mayor on
the non-partisan ticket. First re
turns gave Richard W. Reading,
A.F.L. candidate, a lead over Patrick
H. O'Brian, C.1.0.-backed.
