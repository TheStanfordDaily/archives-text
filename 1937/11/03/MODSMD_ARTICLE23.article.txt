# Encina Office Will Pay Soph Rebates Today
## 
### 
Rebates for breakage and board
will be made today from 1 to 5:30
o'clock in the Encina ofiice to all
students who lived in Encina last
year.
Those who lived in the dormitory
for the full three quarters will re
ceive a refund of $1.30 each on their
breakage deposit.
Students who paid the full amount
of $85 for spring quarter board at
Encina will receive rebates of $10,
while those who held $70 meal books
will get $8.25.
A pro rata deduction from spring
quarter board refunds will be made
on all students who have already
received a rebate because of illness
or other absence.
Total refunds for the quarter,
which amount to about $4000, will
bring the refund per man for the
academic year 1936-37 to $35. This
amount is larger than usual, because
more men ate at Encina Commons
than during the previous year.
All who are entitled to refunds
must appear in person, including
members of El Capitan, Los Arcos,
El Tigre, and El Cuadro. Receipts
are not necessary.
