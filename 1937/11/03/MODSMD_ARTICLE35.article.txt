# Stanford Sharpshooter Heads Rifle, Pistol Club
## 
### ELEANOR MARQUAND 
Shots issuing from the Ad Build
ing Wednesday nights do not mean
another war or a campus murder.
The Stanford Rifle and Pistol Club
is merely having another meeting.
For the last three years the Stan
ford Club has taken on the Palo Alto
police in an annual meet and has
beaten them every time.
This year's president, Rita Sze
keres, of Alpha O, can outshoot both
the men and the women in the club.
Rita is the club's first woman presi
dent and under her management
the membership has risen to 35
active members, the largest number
ever enrolled in the organization.
Accidents are avoided by strict
observance of range rules and a high
degree of safety is maintained at all
times. Other officers of the club
are Cameron Hall, captain of the
pistol team, and Michael Macomber,
captain of the rifle team.
The main activity of the Rifle
Club is the annual participation in
intercollegiate matches with clubs
from other schools. The five highest
scores of one team determine the
winner. The matches are sponsored
by the National Rifle Association.
Last year, the women of the club

formed a separate rifle team for the
purpose of challenging women in
other schools to matches. This divi
sion of the club is steadily growing.
Most of the guns used are owned
by club members. However, the
club owns a few of its own rifles.
The guns range from small bore .22
rifles and revolvers to one .45 that
sounds very much like a small
cannon going off.
The club meets every Wednesday
evening at 7:30 o'clock for an hour
or so of target practice.
