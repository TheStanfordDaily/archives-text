# Speaker's Bureau Starts New Year
## 
### 
Speakers' Bureau opened its third
year of activity yesterday when it
mailed its new list of speakers and
speeches to some 200 service groups
and clubs on the peninsula.
The new pamphlet of the bureau
lists 14 members who are prepared
to talk on subjects from "Making
Earthquakes Useful" by Konrad
Krauskopf to "Saga of the Leaping
Leviathans"; from "Lords of Laugh
ter" by Frances Palmer to Henry
Tani's "Every 56th Californian."
In addition to its present list, the
bureau intends to print a new one
in January. Chuck Schafer asks
that all those who would like to
speak for the bureau should see him
in his office in the Old Union.
