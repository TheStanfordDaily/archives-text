### 
BRUSSELS, Nov. 2 (U.R).â€”Japan is
willing to discuss peace terms with
China but will reject any "inter
ference" by outside powers, Saburo
Kurusu, Japanese ambassador to
Belgium, announced tonight on the
eve of the Far Eastern Peace Con
ference.
Japan's terms for a direct truce
with China, Kurusu said, contain
two "unalterable" conditions:
1. China must halt her anti-Japa
nese propaganda.
2. China must stamp out commu
nism.
