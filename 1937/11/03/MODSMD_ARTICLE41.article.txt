ST. LOUIS (U.RK—Department of
Commerce engineers have begun
construction on the final link of a
chain of lights and a blind-landing
system that is expected to enable
pilots to land here at the Lambert-
St. Louis flying field in safety in the
thickest fog.
The lights will identify the ap
proach to the field's longest runway
and the runway itself. The landing
.system consists of a series of 15
seven-foot neon tubes, spaced at
intervals of 100 feet from the rim of
•the landing field.
