# Shoeshine Boy Likes Keeping Frosh In Trim

Smiling, dusky Encina bootblack
Gus Richards has seen them come
and go at Stanford for 18 years, and
he likes it more every year.
Each year a new crop of freshmen
comes to the Farm to have its col
lective shoes polished. And it has
them well done, for they all come
back. "Of course, every class has a
few that do their own," says Gus,
"but most of them come down in
the basement to sit on my throne.'
Likes His Job
Gus likes his job, and likes the;
kids. He hurries them off to eight
o'clocks, tells them stories about
former big games, old grads, and the
noisy times here when he lived down
the hall in Encina.
Business isn't as good as it was
back in the twenties, when he hired
a helper to keep up with the de
mand. But now that the fall dances
are coming around, business will be
picking up, and Gus will help them
all spruce up.
Big Game Friends
Reminiscent of other years, Gus
hopes to see a great many of his old
friends when the Big Game comes
| around. They all remember him,
and come in for a little shoe-shining,
i and a chat about old times.
And the job is easy. Vacations
! come around for Gus, just like the
students. Then he wanders around
i California, doing enough work to
make expenses, but not enough to
keep it from being a vacation.
When he comes back, there's a new
boot-black job waiting for him with
a new class, and new friends to
make.
