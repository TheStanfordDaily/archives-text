### 
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 2 (U.R). â€”
Police tonight sought a robber who,
dressed in a taxicab driver's uni
form, held up the Spokane Valley
State Bank at Millwood, a few miles
cast of here, and fled with $1500.
Officers believed the robber kid
naped the taxicab's driver, then stole
his vehicle. One taxicab company
reported a car stolen. National Guard
airplanes looked for the missing
taxicab for a time.
The robber entered the bank
shortly after noon. Only two em
ployees, Miss Mildred Davis and
Mrs. C. C. Lavender, were in the
bank at the time. He pointed a gun
at Miss Davis and told her to put
cash on the counter into a paper bag
he carried.
The man demanded more money,
but Miss Davis told him there was
no more except in the vault, con
trolled by a time lock. He forced
the women into the vault, told them
to lie down, and hurried out the
door, driving away in a taxicab.
