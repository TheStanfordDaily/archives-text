# CAMPUS OPINION
## STUDENTS AND FACULTY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Bull Session, "Johnny, This
Is Teacher," will recall to some
among the faculty at least that there
is certainly one "precedent which
prompts teachers to encourage con
tacts with students." It is the Sialic
ford Fellowship, which flourished
from 1926 until, I believe, 1931, for
the purpose of facilitating informal
contact between students and fac
ulty members.
The Fellowship consisted only of
a self-perpetuating student com
mittee of a dozen, perhaps, which
took the responsibility of asking
members of the faculty if and when
they would welcome visits from
students, how many students they
would like to have come, and what
degree of informality they expected.
With those details settled, the com
mittee saw to it that the word was
passed around and that approxi
mately the right number of stu
dents interested got there.
Recalls Visits
I remember well the success of
such visits to the homes of, for ex
ample, Dr. Wilbur, Graham Stuart,
H. H. Fisher, Percy Martin, Miss
Yost, Fredrick Anderson, and oth
ers. The nature of the "entertain
ment" varied from simple bull ses
sion to a sit-down supper (!). But
while the contacts were as varied
as the people themselves, they
served as the beginning of many
a real friendship across the "profes
sional desk."
Indeed, "professors and students J
will get to know each other only i
when they both make an effort to |
meet informally." I don't know !
whether or not Mr. Cobbs would feel
that the Stanford fellowship was
100 much one of the "formal com
mittees" which he rightly thinks
can't regiment friendships into "lec
ture groups and luncheons."
'One Method'
But I do know that for many a
student and many a faculty mem
ber the fellowship rediscovered the
"professional desk" as a link in
stead of a barrier.
The Stanford fellowship may not
recommend itself to the present
generation of Stanford students as
the best method for bridging the
gap between student and teacher—a
gap considerably wider at Stanford
than in many universities—but it is
one method that Stanford did try
For several years with great. suc
cess.
