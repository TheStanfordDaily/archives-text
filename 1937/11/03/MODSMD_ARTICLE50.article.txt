The Editor, Sir:
In connection with Doug Jaques'
recent enlightening and scholarly
articles on the Great Pyramid, I
should like to call to your attention
some discoveries recently made in
the southwestern portion of what
was the United States. An archeo
logical expedition digging in the
river bed of the ancient Colorado
River has come across a large ce
ment structure, obviously of the old
"Western" civilization.
Significant Ratio
The structure is thought to be a
large "dam," but its exact name is
unknown. Apparently the dam was
known variously as "Hoover" or
"Boulder," possibly after two men
of the time. The problem is not
made simpler by the fact that the
tangent line to the downstream face
of the dam at the horizontal cen
troidal axis does NOT point to the
North Star. This fact is considered
significant. In fact, it might denote
a trend.

But more significant are many of
the ratios found in the dam's meas
urements. For example, if we divide
the width at the base, 650 feet, by
the width at the top, 45.5 feet, we
get exactly one-tenth of the width
at the top times pi or 4.55 pi.
Now, obviously, if we eliminate
45.5 from the two above relations
which we may well do since it is not
an integer and hence rather awk
ward, we arrive at a definite rela
tion between the acceleration of
gravity and pi; i.e. 2.5 times the
width at the base over the square of
the height, times the square of the
acceleration of gravity equals pi!
You See, of Course
You see, of course, that this es
tablishes a definite relation between
the circumference of a circle and
i.he pull exerted on a body by grav
ity, a relation still new to us but
obviously well known to the highly
developed western civilization.
I could cite more equally reveal
ing facts, but time demands that I
refer you to my forthcoming mono
graph, which will undoubtedly be a
very rare book, and which will be
published soon by Rally Committee.
Definitely yours,
Walter Vincenti
