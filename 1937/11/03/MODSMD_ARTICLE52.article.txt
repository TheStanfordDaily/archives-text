Howard Jones says he will not
sc.'immage the Trojan ball club be
fore the Stanford - University of
Southern California tilt Saturday.
Tiay Thornhill has a different pol
icy.
"Live bait" will be the call this
afternoon, when Stanford varsity
gridders will go to it in the only
scrimmage this week. Teams will
be organized at 4 o'clock.
The varsity mentor indicated yes
terday that there may be a few
changes in the regular line-up when
the whistle blows in the Coliseum
d</wn in Los Angeles Saturday af
tc rnoon.
McMillan at Guard
Frank McMillan, who played an
admirable game as a second-string
guard against Oregon State Satur
day, will get the call next Saturday.
Tony Calvelli and Louie Tsout
s<-uvas, neck and neck, in the race
for pivot post, seem to take turns.
Saturday is Calvelli's turn, so he
will start at center.
Peter Fay, if he shows the coaches
he can block as well as he can run
and kick, will have a good chance of
smarting at left half.
Schindler-Kirsch
Although it is not yet decided who
will be the starting right halfback,
fans can be sure that Bill Kirsch
\\ ill be in long eungoh to BETE
will be in long enough to answer
the question so often asked, "What
will happen when U.S.C.'s Mr.
Schindler meets Stanford's Mr.
Kirsch?"
Schindler, a runner with hard
driving knees, is seldom tackled at
the first try; Kirsch, an excellent
tackier, has seldom been known to
let anybody carry the ball past him.
Indian invalids are again worry
ing their coach. Neil Rasmussen,
kept from the Oregon State tilt with
t le hope that he would be in shape
lor U.S.C., is still having running
trouble and may not be ready Sat
urday.
Bill Paulman is wearing a special
shoulder pad, but he is not able to
practice enough to get his timing
down to perfection so that he can
lack in his usual fashion.
