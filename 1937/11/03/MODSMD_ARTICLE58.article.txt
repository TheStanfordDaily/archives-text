# Fencers Defeated In Close Decision
## 
### 
In a match packed with close de
cisions, the varsity fencers were de
feated 13-12 last Saturday night by
the Young Italian Club in San Fran
cisco. Had it not been that Stanford
lost 8 out of 10 close decisions, the
outcome would have been in favor
of the Indians.
Far from discouraged by this first
defeat of the season, Coach Elwyn
Bugge believes that chances are
very good for a victory tomorrow
night when the varsity goes to Ber
keley to take on the Bears.
Latest available figures show 12G
American colleges to have endow
ments of $2,000,000 or over.
