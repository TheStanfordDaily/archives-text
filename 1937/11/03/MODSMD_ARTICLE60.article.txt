# Embassy Will Give Dinner For Windsors
## Roosevelt Will Invite Ex-King and Bride To House Luncheon 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (U.R).—The
Duke and Duchess of Windsor will
be entertained at the British Em
bassy at dinner on Friday evening,
November 12, by Sir Ronald and
Lady Lindsay, the Embassy's social
secretary announced today.
The announcement, coming a day
after it was revealed that President
Roosevelt plans to invite the former
king and his bride to a White House
luncheon, was the first definite word
pf their plans after arriving at New
York aboard the Bremen November
11. Px'esumably they will come here
almost immediately.
The Embassy gave out no details
of the plans for the dinner, but in
view of the duke's royal blood and
his position as elder brother of the
King of England, it is understood
the affair will be of an official nature.
Diplomatic and social experts said
an affair of this kind probably would
mean attendance of representatives
of other British diplomats, presum
ably those of Canada and South
Africa, and possibly—since Edward's
tour is to study labor and housing
conditions in the United States—
representatives of the Interior and
Labor departments.
Several prominent Washington
and New York society figures also
may be included, diplomats said.
