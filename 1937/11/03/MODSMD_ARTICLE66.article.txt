STANFORD STUDENTS
HAVE LOST A FRIEND
When Richard "Dick"' Barrett
passed away Monday we students
here on the Farm lost a real friend.
Everyone who knew Dick loved
him. He was truly the student's
friend. He, as a member of the
Board of Athletic Control, never
failed to endorse whole - heartedly
any student case that the students
could at all justify.
It was Dick Barrett who was
largely responsible for Stanford's
great rise from obscurity to top
consideration in the athletic world.
Those of us who knew him are
going to miss his familiar, "Well,
what do the students think should
be done?"
DIPPY CRITICS DON'T
LOOK HARD ENOUGH
Some of the denizens of the Farm
always have a howl in store when
the Dippy comes out each morning.
The Daily, almost without exception,
is infested with butches here and
there.
In defense I will ask these
howlers to pick up any San Fran
cisco newspaper and look for the
hutches. These papers are put
out by professional newspapermen,
so the hutches are fewer and
farther between, but they do have
their mistakes.
The Chronicle the other day had
a good Cal water polo shot. The
caption went on and on to tell all
about the Bear water polo team, but
neglected to mention the name of
the player whose picture appeared.
I could go on with example after
example . . . now maybe the Daily
critics will think twice between
their morning java before they
jump all over the Dippy.
FRENCHMEN GOING
ATHLETE HUNTING
Last week one of the strangest
stories ever heard of in this dizzy
sports world came to my attention.
France, which failed to score a
single point in track and field
at the Olympic Games last year, is
going to attempt to recruit a new
legion of athletes from darkest
Africa.
Next month the French Ath
letic Federation will send a safari
into the jungles of French West
Africa seeking new athletic tal
ent among the dusky natives.
The performances of the Amer
ican negroes in the last Olympics is
probably what motivated the
Frenchmen to pull this unparalleled
stunt. Everybody remembers the
performances of Jesse Owens, Archie
Williams, Corny Johnson, Ben John
son, and Johnny Woodruff.
Some strange tales come out of
nose dark jungles. Natives
been said to leap across 25-foot
streams with the greatest ease, and
think nothing of jumping over 7-foot
stockade walls in their bare feet, or
running for 10 miles without a let
up.
Maybe the French have some
thing there.
