frosh football team is
facing its toughest game of the sea
| son this Saturday when it meets the
Cal Cubs from across the bay.
It's going to be a tough one be
-1 cause this game — which is THE
game for the frosh—will see the
Papooses come out on the field fa
vored to win ;jnd that gives Cal
the psychological advantage of be
ing the underdogs.
Little Red Machine
Starting off this season with a me
diocre team, the Papooses have built
up a machine — the sports editor
1 would cal! it a Little Red Machine
| —strong enough to bowl over first
rate elevens, strong enough to send
the Baby Bear ferrying across the
bay, tail between his legs, screaming
for his papa.
They can, that is, if they can keep
from getting overconfident after
their close 14-13 game against
U.C.L.A. and their massacre of San
Mateo J. C.
Beaten Only by U.S.C.
Clint Evans is bringing a team
1 over here which has been beaten
, only by U.S.C., in a close 7-2 game,
and which he thinks will give the
i frosh a taste of the same kind of
medicine that sports writers in the
Big City have been saying, in big,
black headlines, that the Wonder
Team will give the Card varsity in
three weeks.
Coach Harry Shipkey fears they
j may do something of the sort, even
though they were lucky to beat San
Mateo 7-4 while the Cards swamped
them 20-0. He saw the Cal first
string pile up 12 points against Sac
| ramento J. C. Saturday, and then let
j the second string loaf through the
i rest of the game. It will be a very
under-rated little Cub that will play
i the Papoose this week.
New Plays
But Shipkey will send his boys
I out Saturday with a bunch of new
plays, set to win. After watching
; the he came home with sev
eral new plays built to fit Cal's de
j fense.
And for the first time this' year,
i Shipkey has a complete backfield in
1 top condition. There's not an in
jured back running through signals
out on Grey's Field these after
j noons.
An interesting duel of ex-high
! school fullbacks will be renewed in
! the Little Big Game. Stanford's
| Captain Norm Standlee and Cal's
| big Bill Elmore played for rival
! Long Beach prep schools for three
years.
