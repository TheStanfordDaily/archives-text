# Veterans Win Track Events
## Members of '37 Squad Lead in Trial Meets 
### 
If intrasquad track meets mean
anything, Stanford will have a track
team of veterans for 1938. In the two
Monday night track meets that, have
been held, few new faces have been
seen out in front.
Ray Malott, N.C.A.A. and National 1
A.A.U. quarter-mile champion, took
his first real workout of the yeitr
Monday and sailed home in front of
Carl Mahurin in a 51-second quar
ter. Stan Hiserman has done the
100 in 10.1 seconds and the 221 low
hurdles in the good early season I
time of 25.1.
Distance nien have -been spending i
their time running around the golf \
course, but March, Burrows, and |
Beman have all bettered 4:40 for
the mile.
Hugh Gribben is getting the jump
on Pete Zagar, N.C.A.A. discus
champ. While Zagar is out for foot
ball Hugh is spinning the disc out
close to 150 feet. Montgomery and
Lippman are leading the shot-put
ters with Lippman over 47 feet.
The high jump and javelin look to
be the only events that defy early
season optimism, with 5 feet 8 inches
being the best that eligible men were
able to do in the high jump at the
last intrasquad meet.
CHICAGO. Nov. 2 (U.R).â€”Sixty
one authenticated deaths from an
elixir of sulfanilamide were reported

sociation survey which also fixed the
diethylene glycol base of the elixir
as the lethal agent.
