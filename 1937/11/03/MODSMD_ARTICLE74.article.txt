# Waterpoloists Set To Battle This Week-end
## Indian Squad To Meet Bruins, Troy, Cal Still Tops Conference 
### 
With a chance to put themselves j
back in the conference race as an ]
incentive, Stanford's water polo
team if? priming itself for its eru- j
cial series with U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
this week-end.
A single loss will sink the Indians' i
chances of a comeback; a double win I
will put them near the top again, j
California leads the league at present j
with decisive wins over both the
southern teams. Stanford has al
ready lost to U.S.C. 2 to 1.
The Cards leave Thursday night, j
meeting the Uclans in the first game i
Friday and Southern California Sat
urday morning. The Bruins are a
comparative dark horse inasmuch as j
they have played neither Stanford
nor California. However, they boast
a veteran lineup plus the addition of
two junior college transfers.
Bill Slater, their potential All-
American guard, will probably tag j
Johnny Lamb. Lamb ran amuck
against the Olympic Club Friday, !
scoring six times.
The Saturday morning get-to- j
gether will be in the manner of a j
revenge duel. The Trojans whipped
Stanford in the last two minutes of :
play here two weeks ago. The game
was the roughest seen in Encina !
Pools all season.
Coach Nort Thornton has been
using the same first string that de
feated the Olympians and has been
alternating Wilson and Burns at
goal. Each played a half against the
Clubmen and both were close to a
standoff in ability.
