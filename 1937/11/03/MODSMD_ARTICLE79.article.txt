## Betting on '41 'To Show' 
### 
DEAR Frosh:
Whether you know it or not, the A.S.S.U.
is betting its pile on you tonight.
Three weeks ago a Paly theater manager, act
ing for goodwill, and seeking to erase a blot on
last year's calendar, sent the Dean of Men at
Stanford an offer. It was this —that the Varsity
Theater would be available to the Class of '41
for the annual Pajamarino. An effort would be
made to secure any current film desired. There
would be no charge. But the University would
be responsible for damage.
After deliberation, the Dean refused. His de
cision was founded on historical evidence: a
pair of policeman's trousers, torn in the seat;
a damaged theater foyer—results of last year's
widely publicized "riot" when freshmen be
came angry at the theater's refusal of entrance.
The University could not risk further unfavor
able publicity or be responsible for damage.
Dean Culver's stand is understandable.
But the A.S.S.U. committee saw no glamor in
an on-campus affair, and decided to shoulder

responsibility for frosh actions and accept the
theater's offer. It believed that last year's dem
onstration of mob hysteria would not be re
peated when the Class of '41 met with theater
co-operation in place of opposition. It promised
to make good all damages. It bet that '41 would
incur none.
Tonight, the A.S.S.U. is gambling on your
ability to make great quantities of noise, to sere
nade Roble's portals with much gusto (watch for
water bags), to race down to thfe theater without
smashing someone between cars, to raise par
ticular ned during the show without damage to
property.
" Colloquially, the wad has been placed on
you, gentlemen. The A.S.S.U., in the face of
administrative opposition, is betting that you
can have a good time and still leave the fixtures.
It asks that you bear out its belief that you can
play the game straight.
Hope you have as much fun as I did.
Yours,
Gordy

pair of policeman's trousers, torn in the seat;
a damaged theater foyer—results of last year's
widely publicized "riot" when freshmen be
came angry at the theater's refusal of entrance.
The University could not risk further unfavor
able publicity or be responsible for damage.
Dean Culver's stand is understandable.
But the A.S.S.U. committee saw no glamor in
an on-campus affair, and decided to shoulder

responsibility for frosh actions and accept the
theater's offer. It believed that last year's dem
onstration of mob hysteria would not be re
peated when the Class of '41 met with theater
co-operation in place of opposition. It promised
to make good all damages. It bet that '41 would
incur none.
Tonight, the A.S.S.U. is gambling on your
ability to make great quantities of noise, to sere
nade Roble's portals with much gusto (watch for
water bags), to race down to thfe theater without
smashing someone between cars, to raise par
ticular ned during the show without damage to
property.
" Colloquially, the wad has been placed on
you, gentlemen. The A.S.S.U., in the face of
administrative opposition, is betting that you
can have a good time and still leave the fixtures.
It asks that you bear out its belief that you can
play the game straight.
Hope you have as much fun as I did.
Yours,
Gordy
