# LaGuardia and Subways

IN New York, yesterday was the time for all
good men to come to the aid of the party, but
seemingly there weren't enough good party
men, and Fiorello LaGuardia won easily over
Tammany.
According to experts this is supposed to mean
the end of Tammany, prime example of prac
tical politics. Tammany's strength was made
up of the sum of debts of political appointees
and good Democrats who got a sack of coal
during a hard winter.
LaGuardia's first term was one of the two
things that caused Tammany's downfall; the
other was the New Deal. The Tammany Tiger
has survived reform administrations before; in
fact liked them because they built up the pos
sible loot. But it couldn't compete with whole
sale largess of the New Deal's PWA and WPA
v/hich was distributed through LaGuardia's ad
ministration. It found its regular following alien
ated by a more generous patron.
And strangely, if the Tiger is really dead, one
of the losers is the New Deal. Tammany after
all was Democratic, and could more efficiently
marshall the same voters for Roosevelt as in
the past it did for Jimmie Walker.
In San Francisco, yesterday was the time for
all good men to come to the aid of the city. The
battle cry was save the city from the bridges.
Civic-minded people saw their much-boasted

spans as Frankenstein monsters rising up to de
stroy San Francisco—as a residential city. In
terurban trains across the Bay Bridge will be
running in less than a year, and soon the busi
ness district will be nearer in time to Berkeley
than to the city's own Sunset District.
The peculiar plan of the city, and the poor
transportation it has caused, brought about a
migration to East Bay and Peninsula districts.
Fear of great acceleration of this migration was
one of the main talking points in the campaign
for rapid transit bonds.
But, from incomplete returns last night, San
Francisco seemed lost. Perhaps strap-hanging
arms of the good men were too tired to steer
the X to the correct spot on the ballot.—L. L.

of the losers is the New Deal. Tammany after
all was Democratic, and could more efficiently
marshall the same voters for Roosevelt as in
the past it did for Jimmie Walker.
In San Francisco, yesterday was the time for
all good men to come to the aid of the city. The
battle cry was save the city from the bridges.
Civic-minded people saw their much-boasted

spans as Frankenstein monsters rising up to de
stroy San Francisco—as a residential city. In
terurban trains across the Bay Bridge will be
running in less than a year, and soon the busi
ness district will be nearer in time to Berkeley
than to the city's own Sunset District.
The peculiar plan of the city, and the poor
transportation it has caused, brought about a
migration to East Bay and Peninsula districts.
Fear of great acceleration of this migration was
one of the main talking points in the campaign
for rapid transit bonds.
But, from incomplete returns last night, San
Francisco seemed lost. Perhaps strap-hanging
arms of the good men were too tired to steer
the X to the correct spot on the ballot.—L. L.
