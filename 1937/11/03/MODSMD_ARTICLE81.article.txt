THE TRIAL, ANI) THE VERDICT
YV/HEN Gilbert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury" was
contrasted with "Murder in the Cathedral" last
week-end, student reaction made it an easy winner.
Many of the roughs squirmed in their luxuriously
upholstered seats while Thomas a Becket went to
the mat with temptation. But there were no rustlings
or whispered wisecracks when justice was set to music.
Even the boys from Sequoia permitted the light of
appreciation to glow on their rugged features.
For those who manipulate the destinies of Stanford
dramatics, the reaction to the week-end's presenta
tion might prove the sign-post that has been the al
leged object of so many histrionic scavenger hunts.
The students like Gilbert and Sullivan. They don't
like art-encrusted dramas depicting the tortures of a
soul crushing under the iron heel of something or
other. Wherefore, the logic professor would say, if
you want to please the students, give them Gilbert
and Sullivan.

For some years the dramatics department and the
students have wrangled back and forth like diplomats
with a new mandate. The drama boys say that they
will not degrade, besmirch, and otherwise prostitute
their fair art by producing "popular" (and how they
spit that insult out between their teeth) plays. The
students retort that since they are expected to put
up the ante for the productions, they are entitled to
see something they like.
Plays on the Gilbert and Sullivan type may pro
vide a solution that will keep the dramatic leaders
from lying awake to think up acid comebacks to
criticism. Nearly a century of grade A immortality
should be proof that Gilbert and Sullivan works do
something more than pander to passing fancy. Surely
the high priests of drama cannot consider them sacri
legious. And as evidenced last week-end, the students
like operettas.

r JpHE quarrel so far has been nursed by misunder
standing. After a hard week of classes, students
demanded entertainment they could understand with
out a slide rule. It is not much relief to lay aside
Oarver and Hansen, and then go to a play where
unidentified chaps in odd robes flit about chanting at
each other.
A play is not entertainment if the audience needs
a book of instructions to understand it. It does not
take an effort to forgive a student for balking when
he found that "First Evil Thought" could not be
distinguished from "Assistant Secretary to the Arch
angel."

The reception given "Trial* by Jury" indicates that
both students and artists can be satisfied by more
productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan type. There
arc hundreds of such operettas; and, though the dra
matic boys will howl at the thought, there are also a
great many worth musical comedies.
In fact, the students do not even ask music to
make drama acceptable. Noel Coward is popular with
undergraduates. So are O'Neil and Shaw.
The presentation of "Trial by Jury" proves that
the dramatics department can produce plays that
students like. It also proves that such plays need not
soil the sacred skirts of their doggess. It doesn't take
a law graduate to decide what should be the course
of justice.
