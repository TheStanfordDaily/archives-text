The National Students Federation of America,
founded in 1925 as a peace organization and since
turned into a national organization of student gov
ernment. reprints the following edit from the New
Mexico Lobo in its weekly report labeled "one of
the best editorials of the year."â€”The Editor
J.JOW would you like to be a hero? How would you
like to be picked out of a muddy ditch and placed
in a flag-draped coffin? How would you like to lie
in state under the rotunda of the Capitol Building in
Washington with a military guard at your head and
feet, while presidents and generals and ambassadors
and common people passed by to do you homage?
How would you like to be laid in a beautiful white
marble mausoleum with a military salute and the
sad, sweet sound of taps for a lullaby? How would
you like to have a great general place a wreath on
your grave each Memorial Day, and foreign celebri
ties speak in hushed and trembling voices of the
supreme sacrifice that you made and the glory that
is yours?
The last Unknown Soldier was only a lad like
you. He worked at his job, and respected his elders;
and built his shining dreams of the future. And then
the Great Chance came, and he grabbed it. Now he is
one of the immortals. He is honored and respected;
everyone speaks highly of him.
The United States Marine Corps is now accepting
men for immediate enlistment. They will be trans
ferred, an announcement says, "to San Diego for an
eight-weeks' training period, after which they will be
eligible for duty aboard battleships or in the Orient."
Here, boys, is your chance! Give up your humdrum
jobs; put away your dull books. Here is opportunity
pounding on your door. Hurry while there is still
time. The band is already tuned up; the generals
have their eulogies well in mind; the wreath has
been prepared; the mausoleum awaits. You may be
the lucky one. You too can be an unknown soldier.
