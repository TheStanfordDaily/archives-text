# Weaknesses, Merit Shown By New Novel
## 
### 
Frederic Prokosch has written
two books and has already received
international acclaim and an award
from Harper Brothers. The award
novel, "The Seven Who Fled" (at
the Stanford Bookstore), illustrates
at once the merit and the weakness
of his writing and his philosophy.
The seven of the title are Euro
peans, caught up in the whirlpool of

China's unending
unrest. In an at
tempt to reach
Shanghai they
join a caravan
and start forth
into the vast and
forbidding coun
try.
At the village
of Aqsu four are
left behind as
hostages, one is
left because he is
ill with fever. The
other two press

on. Finally they too take different
roads, and the seven who fled are
scattered across China, their brief
community of interest lost, them
selves lost too in a spiritual chaos
which the author, although he illu
mines it fairly well, never justifies.
Layeville, the moody Englishman,
dies in the mountain snows. Sera
fimov, the childlike Russian giant,
murders Goupilliere, the bitter little
Belgian. Wildenbrush, a Hitler in
embryo, finally succeeds in reaching
Shanghai with his friend, Von
Wald, but neither of them reaches
any satisfactory answer to his spir
itual bewilderment. De la Scaze,
the unhappy Frenchman, dies of the
plague in Aqsu. Olivia, his wife,
comes to journey's end in a Shang
hai brothel, an event which seems
to please her inordinately, although
the author never quite makes clear
why it should.
Prose Poetic
Mr. Prokosch writes truly beauti
ful poetic prose in many places; but
his little company of aberrants
never quite comes alive.
He seems to indicate that these
people represent the spirit of pres
ent-day Europe; and the inference
is that Europe's end will be as
pointless as their own. If a civiliza
tion had ever perished without some
contribution to culture, however
small, or without making some last
gesture on which future civilizations
could base their growth, one might
grant his point.
Not the Case
But this has never, even in the
darkest times, been the case; and
to postulate that the death of Eu
rope will be of no more consequence
than Layeville's death in the snow
or Goupilliere's death at the hands
of Serafimov, would seem to postu
late a false theory.
For sighing prose and a beauti
fully worked out background, "The
Seven Who Fled" is far above the
ordinary run of fiction.—A. S. D.

unrest. In an at
tempt to reach
Shanghai they
join a caravan
and start forth
into the vast and
forbidding coun
try.
At the village
of Aqsu four are
left behind as
hostages, one is
left because he is
ill with fever. The
other two press

on. Finally they too take different
roads, and the seven who fled are
scattered across China, their brief
community of interest lost, them
selves lost too in a spiritual chaos
which the author, although he illu
mines it fairly well, never justifies.
Layeville, the moody Englishman,
dies in the mountain snows. Sera
fimov, the childlike Russian giant,
murders Goupilliere, the bitter little
Belgian. Wildenbrush, a Hitler in
embryo, finally succeeds in reaching
Shanghai with his friend, Von
Wald, but neither of them reaches
any satisfactory answer to his spir
itual bewilderment. De la Scaze,
the unhappy Frenchman, dies of the
plague in Aqsu. Olivia, his wife,
comes to journey's end in a Shang
hai brothel, an event which seems
to please her inordinately, although
the author never quite makes clear
why it should.
Prose Poetic
Mr. Prokosch writes truly beauti
ful poetic prose in many places; but
his little company of aberrants
never quite comes alive.
He seems to indicate that these
people represent the spirit of pres
ent-day Europe; and the inference
is that Europe's end will be as
pointless as their own. If a civiliza
tion had ever perished without some
contribution to culture, however
small, or without making some last
gesture on which future civilizations
could base their growth, one might
grant his point.
Not the Case
But this has never, even in the
darkest times, been the case; and
to postulate that the death of Eu
rope will be of no more consequence
than Layeville's death in the snow
or Goupilliere's death at the hands
of Serafimov, would seem to postu
late a false theory.
For sighing prose and a beauti
fully worked out background, "The
Seven Who Fled" is far above the
ordinary run of fiction.—A. S. D.


"Toss-up"
Frederic Prokosch has written
two books and has already received
international acclaim and an award
from Harper Brothers. The award
novel, "The Seven Who Fled" (at
the Stanford Bookstore), illustrates
at once the merit and the weakness
of his writing and his philosophy.
The seven of the title are Euro
peans, caught up in the whirlpool of

China's unending
unrest. In an at
tempt to reach
Shanghai they
join a caravan
and start forth
into the vast and
forbidding coun
try.
