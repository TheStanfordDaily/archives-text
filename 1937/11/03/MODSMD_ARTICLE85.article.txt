BURY THE ROUGH

The Editor, Sir:
When students attend the impor
tant concerts in the city it is an oc
casion! They dress smartly and make
the evening a 'gala one. Heretofore
our Concert Series artists have ap
peared in the pavilion, a building
devoid of any artistic beauty and
lacking adequate seating facilities.
Perhaps there was some excuse for
informal attire of thp students.
Now the new Memorial Theater
supplants the old pavilion and the
"ancient evils" have been remedied.
In the refined and luxurious atmos
phere of the theater we feel that the
students should not appear in Quad
clothes. They should try to dress
with due respect to the artist and
their surroundings. Why not make
each performance of the Series this
year a gala event, an evening to an
ticipate with eagerness?
