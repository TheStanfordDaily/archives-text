# TEAR IT DOWN

The Editor, Sir:
Poor Prendergast! He spent over
a year building up a reputation for
his column and then to have it all
go by the wayside as soon as he
left school.
This last attempt by one Collie
Small, if that is his name. (I would
n't have the nerve to sign my real
name to that last column of grut
that appeared in chappie)
Viva Prendergast
The standards that Prendergast set
for his column were musically un
impeachable. He not only knew
music, but he knew how to express
his ideas without x-esorting to a
trite method of inserting a couple
of swing terms to make a puerile
display of his knowledge.
And just what the hell is a "swing
technician" if I may be permitted
to ask? And to say that Hal Kemp
must rate over Benny Goodman! If
that isn't the height of lucridity! I
suggest that Mr. Small find out just
what he is talking about before he
spouts out with something like that

again. For the record, I would like j
to point out that Goodman was .se
lected as the best white swing band
in the country in a poll conducted
by Downbeat, and that Kemp was
selected as the best sweet band ir.
the business in the very same poll, i
A poll conducted by musicians for
musicians.
Slightly Deaf
In a business where pne has to
depend on one's ears for criticism,
Small seems to have become more
than slightly deaf. It was probably j
he who suggested to the sophomore
class that they should have Clyde j
McCoy for the Cotillion.
/\t any rate, Small doesn't deserve |
to have the title "Stompin' Around"
over his column. Stompin' Around
has come to mean a musician's criti
cism of music, not some fraternity's
symposium of what swing music
should be. If Small can't do a bet
ter job he had better stop taking j
the name of the column in vain.

When a Connecticut power com
pany needed a reservoir it dammed
up a valley, creating Candlewood
lake. The lake is only 17 miles
long but its shoreline measures 97
miles.
