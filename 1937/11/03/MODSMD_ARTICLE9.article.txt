# Arrangements Completed For Movie Booking
## Committee Studios Okay New Rental Program For Sunday Pictures 
### 
Announcing that "Mr. Deeds Goes
to Town" will be the second movie
shown in Memorial Hall, Bill Hovey,
chairman of the movie committee,
last night said that the main stum
bling block to booking of films has
been removed.
The committee has concluded ar
rangements with San Francisco
branches of major Hollywod studios,
and now will be able to obtain pic
tures from them for Farm showings.
Although reluctant to interfere with
Palo Alto cinema trade, the studios
have agreed to allow spot booking,
or booking of single pictures to be
shown in Memorial Hall.
' Choice Expanded
These arrangements will allow
much greater choice in scheduling
programs, Hovey said. Modern pic
tures, as well as old classics, will be
shown. The committee will attempt
to follow student desires in book
ing movies.
Because the first Memorial Hall
movie last Sunday night grossed
approximately $113, a profit over
$60, admission will be reduced to 15
cents. Since the programs are to be
run on a no-profit basis, fux - ther re
ductions may take place if patronage
warrants.
By-law Revision
Ex Committee last night pointed
out the fact that constitutional by
laws prevent dramatic productions
from being held on any but Fx-iday
or Satui-day nights. A special com
mittee to suggest changes to allow
the Sunday night movies to be held
was appointed, and will report next
week.
The committee working under
Hovey includes Howard Pine, Des
Mactavish, Howard Ci'aigin, and
Bob Moyle.
