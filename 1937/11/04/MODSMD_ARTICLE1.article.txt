# Cal, Stanford Juniors May Get Together
## Council Considers Joint Activities Plan For First Time in History 
### 
Stanford and University of Cali
fornia juniors will gather for the first
time in history in a joint junior ac
tivity if plans made last night by
the Junior Executive Council go
through as expected.
Dave Ryus, class president, told
the council he had discussed the pos
sibility of such an affair with Ray
Hanford, junior class president at
California.
Several types of activities were
suggested at last night's meeting.
The most favorable to the group was
the suggestion made by Deane John
son that the affair take the form of
a joint Class of '39 dinner preceding
the Cal-Stanford basketball game in
the winter quarter.
In Women's Gym
It was mentioned that the dinner
could be held in the Women's Gym
and that entertainment could be
provided by talented juniors from
both universities. Ryus will choose
a committee to make necessary ar
rangements.
Council members also discussed
the possibility of a fourth junior ac
tivity. The idea of a Junior Week
end at Yosemite or a similar resort
was discarded because it would be
too expensive and would probably
not be approved by University offi
cials.
Members suggested that the fourth
activity be a barbecue, hayride, or
informal dance during the spring
quarter. Possibility of a combina
tion of the two was discussed.

from last night's meeting, including
Jean Foxe and Anne Martineau,
members of the Gaieties Trio that
