Author Outstanding
Pirandello, who died last year, is
considered the leading modern

of the play concerns six actors who
come to rehearsal and demand that
the manager allow them to portray
their own characters instead of per
sons in a play.

Author" is being read with the
special permission of E. P. Dutton
Co., its publishers.
