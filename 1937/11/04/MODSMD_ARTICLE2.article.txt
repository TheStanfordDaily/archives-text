### 
WASHINGTON,' Nov. 3 (UP). —
John L. Lewis, head of the Com
mittee for Industrial Organization,
tonight ordered his forces to pre
pare for the 1938 congressional elec
tions as results from Tuesday's off
year balloting aroused new specu
lation about a possible third party
in the 1040 presidential contest.
In a statement issued as chairman
of labor's non-partisan league, Lewis
recognized that C.1.0. candidates in
Detroit and Ohio were badly de
feated but he insisted that the bal
loting as a whole reflected "distinct
progress for labor."
He blamed the defeat of Patrick J.
O'Brien, C.1.0. candidate for mayor
of Detroit, and of other candidates
for Detroit offices who were backed
by the C.1.0. on a "combination of
massed wealth and an entrenched
political machine." He said that "la
bor in Michigan is prepared to ex
pand the sphere of its influence in
the future."
