# Dance Major Now Offered to Women
## 
### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
A new development in the tradi
tional battle of the sexes at Stanford
came this quarter when the Phys
ical Education Department offered
women a new major—"The Dance."
Accustomed to taking the major
courses originally designed for men,
or going elsewhere, Stanford women
may now point with pride to this
exclusively feminine major.
Stanford is the first university or
college in the western United States
to offer such specialization in dance,
leading to a degree and credential,
and preparing its students to teach
dance or enter professional dance
groups.
According to Miss Margaret Jew

ell, the new dance instructor, the
facilities of the Women's Gymna
sium are ideal for such work. The
Dance Studio with its specially con
structed floor, large windows, and
small audience balcony, is the finest
studio in this part of the country.
The dance , department is also
qualified to assist in other depart
ments. There is a class now being
given to advanced drama students
in both men's and women's groups,
which deals with problems in move
ment.
Miss Jewell assisted with the pro
i duction of the play, "Murder in the
Cathedral," and particularly direct
i ed the rhythmic movements of the
Women of Canterbury.
Other new majors offered to wom
en this year arc in hygiene, physical

education, and physical therapy.
Graduates will be qualified to go
into the schools as special teachers
or into hospitals or doctor's offices
as physical therapy technicians.
Students majoring in this phase
of physical education will take
more yvork in anatomy, physiology,
physics, psychology, and hygiene
than the general physical education
major.
With the general set-up of the
present gymnasium plant, an expe
rienced, progressive and profession
ally well trained staff, and the co
operation of other departments, the
directors have expressed the belief
that the Department of Hygiene and
Physical Education for Women
should be one of the most outstand
ing in the West.
