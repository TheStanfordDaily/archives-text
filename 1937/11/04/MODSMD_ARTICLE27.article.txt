# Pajamas Go Wild, Freshmen Tame In '37 Pajamarino
## 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Ex Committee must lie liappy. Paly police must be happy. The Varsity
Theater must he happy.
Last night, Stanford's freshmen behaved themselves like little gen
tlemen, made their Pajamarino conform to the "safe and sane" ruling
laid down for them hy University authorities. They didn't rip Paly

►policemen's pants, they didn't rush
Roble, and they didn't tear down the
theater.
Frosh Parade
Clad in their wildest pajamas,
freshmen torchlight - paraded down
the Row to the Pavilion, followed by
a stream of ears with horns going
full blast. There they sat on the
floor, heard Bill Leiser, Chronicle
sports writer and former Daily edi
tor, say how foolish it was for him
to be talking—"You can learn any
thing I know for 5 cents any day in
the week.
"If the Cards play as well as
they can," he said, "they won't have
to worry about getting the breaks.
They'll take care of themselves."
Varsity Introduced
Coach Tiny Thornhill introduced
the varsity squad, bemoaned the fact
that football players now are look
ed upon as different from other stu
dents. "Our practice field is open
every day," he said. "I can remem
ber when we eon Id hardly get the
team on the field for the student
body. Now we have four or five
newshounds from the Dippy." As
for the U.S.C. game, he "didn't
know" how it will turn out.
Captain Grant Stone, represent
ing the team, said, "When we start
ed this season, there were two games
we particularly wanted to win—one
of them comes up this Saturday."
'Hold That Tiger'
The band broke into swing with
"Hold that Tiger" and "Dark Town
Strutters' Ball," Jim Ransohoff and
his assistants, Bill Todd and Lomax
Turner, led a series of yells, includ
ing the famous "Axe," and two
freshmen walked in with the sopho
more dance sign, "The Real McCoy."
Advised by Ransohoff, "If you bust
in Roble, you get busted out of
school," frosh serpentined out at
the Pavilion, headed for Roble,
where they stood in the driveway
and serenaded frosh women leaning
out of windows and balconies. Only
violence was a water bag from a
third-story window which hit—not
a freshman—but two Daily report
ers.
Special Showing
From Roble, the pajama-paraders
trailed down Palm Drive to the
Varsity and a special showing of
"Stage Door." Songs, yells, and
short features made up the rest of
the program.
While most of the pajamariners
hitch-hiked to Paly, two freshmen
drove up to the theater in a taxi,
got out in all the glory of red and
blue satin pajamas, and walked in.
Frosh attire ranged from con
servative pajamas to three long,
flannel nightshirts with the legend,
"Hell with '40. Foo," painted across
the back.
