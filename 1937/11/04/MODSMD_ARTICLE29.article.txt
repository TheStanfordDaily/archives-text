### 
BRUSSELS, Nov. 3 (UP). — The
United States, Great Britain, and
France clashed with Fascist Italy
today when Norman H. Davis,
America's "roving ambassador,"
opened the far eastern peace con
ference with a warning that war
threatens the whole world as long
as hostilities rage in China.
He cautioned Italy, Germany, and
Japan — without mentioning them
by name—that their policies of eco
nomic self-sufficiency are "condu
cive to the threat of peace."
Davis, speaking before the dele
gates of 19 nations gathered in Bel
gium's Academy of Arts and Sci
ences, urged an "equitable adjust
ment" of the Chinese-Japanese war.
Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden
of Britain and Foreign Minister
Yvon Delbos of France came
staunchly and eloquently to Davis'
side with glowing tributes to Presi
dent Roosevelt's peace pronounce
ments.
The Italian delegate, Count Luigi
Aldrovandi-Max'escotti who carried
the instructions of Premier Benito
Mussolini, served notice, however,
that he was there to defend Japan
and that the aims of the conference
—to seek an armistice in the orient
—were "useless."
SHANGHAI, Thursday, Nov. 4
(UP). —Efforts of the powers, led by
Britain, the United States and
France, to neutralize Shanghai as
soon as the long. Chinese-Japanese
battle around this city ends, have
failed completely, reliable Japanese
sources told the United Press today.
These Japanese believe that the
severe fighting which has raged in
and around the city since mid-Au
gust will be ended within a week.
They said the efforts of the powers
were designed, to make the entire
Shanghai area a neutral zone so
that rebuilding of the ruined parts
of the city, resumption of normal
commerce and restoration of trade,
could be achieved rapidly.
