### 
Captain Hayden Grubb's Card
horsemen meet the San Mateo Polo
Club for their third match this Fri
day at 3:30 here on the highway polo
field. In the first game the Indians
took a 6-4 win,but the Peninsula
team came back in the second to give
them a 12-6 beating.
Starting lineup for the Cards will
be Jim Fullerton (c) (1), Don Mc-
Ausland (2), Steve Downey (3), and
Bert McClintock (4). The San Ma
teo Polo Club puts a number of sep
arate squads on the lield, this being
one of the reasons for the Indian
defeat in their second match.
The lineup for the Peninsula club
this Friday will probably be com
posed of George Pope (c) (3), Bill
Gilmore (2), Peter Mc√üean (1), and
Frank Fuller (4). This is the same
group that the Cards defeated in
their first match.
