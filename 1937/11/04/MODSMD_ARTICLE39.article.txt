# SIDELINE SLANTS

### 
THREE ACE GRID
DISHES COMING UP
Three real football battles are
coming up Saturday. Those of us
who trek to the southern metropo
lis for the invasion of Troy are go
ing to see a close, hard fought strug
gle. Both the Indians and the Tro
jans are going to be hopping mad
after their respective scoreless ties
last week-end.
"Stop Schindler" is the cry that
lias been floating around the Card
ioolhai! park this week. Cat stop
ped Amby, and the great piston
legged star didn't do an awful lot
of dangerous work against the
W.S.C. Cougars last week, but
Stanford gridders still have their
work cut out for them in stop
ping Schindler's off-tackle thrusts.
Up in the Berkeley hills the Boo
erkeley Bears take up some more
undertaking business with the
Washington Huskies. The Bears
should bury the old Husky hound
but Phelan's bunch may pull a sur
prise by putting up a fight. Maybe
the Bruins took some of Cal's mur
derous power away from them.
Down at the end of the penin
sula we have the second annual
classic of the prunes when Buck
Shaw's undefeated. Santa Clara
Broncos tangle with Dud DeGroot's
undefeated San Jose State Spartans.
The Broncos won last year when
they were champs by a 20-0 score,
but this year's game should be a
whole lot closer than that.
STANFORD DUBBED
THE RIDDLE TEAM'
The S. F. Chronicle runs what they
call scout reports on local football
teams. The other day they ran one
on Stanford, and dubbed the Farm
«quad the "Riddle Team." Seems to
me there are quite a few teams on
the coast this year that could fit
quite amply under that monicker.
Stanford's strength is analyzed
and the weaknesses are scru
tinized. Tiny's Big Red Machine
lias strength in its very definite
attacking power with Pete Fay
cutting inside left tackle on re
verses behind Pete Zagar's of
fensive charge.
Then Dick Friendlich's report
drifts into Stanford's weaknesses. He
lays some of them at the feet of
the linemen and backs' inability to
get the sustained blocking necessary
for many of the Stanford plays which
went wide or required the ball car
rier to travel more than three or
four yards before reaching the hole.
HERE ARE THE BOYS
WHO GRIND OUT SPORTS
We've got a staff of sports writers
over here in the Daily shack, 12
strong, that doesn't get much rec
ognition. Either the stories are not
big enough to be bannered with
by-lines or the sport is out of sea
son, but still the boys are around
here most of the time turning out
their sports yarns.
Just let you Stanfordites know
who's behind the printer's ink on
the Daily's sports pages, here's
the complete sports staff.
John "Shallenbutch"' Shallen
berger, varsity football; Doug "Cyn
ic" Jaques, frosh football and box
ing; Harry "Pretzel" Press, grid
roundups and features; Walt
"Blondie" Peterson, features and

THREE ACE GRID
DISHES COMING UP
Three real football battles are
coming up Saturday. Those of us
who trek to the southern metropo
lis for the invasion of Troy are go
ing to see a close, hard fought strug
gle. Both the Indians and the Tro
jans are going to be hopping mad
after their respective scoreless ties
last week-end.
"Stop Schindler" is the cry that
lias been floating around the Card
ioolhai! park this week. Cat stop
ped Amby, and the great piston
legged star didn't do an awful lot
of dangerous work against the
W.S.C. Cougars last week, but
Stanford gridders still have their
work cut out for them in stop
ping Schindler's off-tackle thrusts.
Up in the Berkeley hills the Boo
erkeley Bears take up some more
undertaking business with the
Washington Huskies. The Bears
should bury the old Husky hound
but Phelan's bunch may pull a sur
prise by putting up a fight. Maybe
the Bruins took some of Cal's mur
derous power away from them.
Down at the end of the penin
sula we have the second annual
classic of the prunes when Buck
Shaw's undefeated. Santa Clara
Broncos tangle with Dud DeGroot's
undefeated San Jose State Spartans.
The Broncos won last year when
they were champs by a 20-0 score,
but this year's game should be a
whole lot closer than that.
STANFORD DUBBED
THE RIDDLE TEAM'
The S. F. Chronicle runs what they
call scout reports on local football
teams. The other day they ran one
on Stanford, and dubbed the Farm
«quad the "Riddle Team." Seems to
me there are quite a few teams on
the coast this year that could fit
quite amply under that monicker.
Stanford's strength is analyzed
and the weaknesses are scru
tinized. Tiny's Big Red Machine
lias strength in its very definite
attacking power with Pete Fay
cutting inside left tackle on re
verses behind Pete Zagar's of
fensive charge.
Then Dick Friendlich's report
drifts into Stanford's weaknesses. He
lays some of them at the feet of
the linemen and backs' inability to
get the sustained blocking necessary
for many of the Stanford plays which
went wide or required the ball car
rier to travel more than three or
four yards before reaching the hole.
HERE ARE THE BOYS
WHO GRIND OUT SPORTS
We've got a staff of sports writers
over here in the Daily shack, 12
strong, that doesn't get much rec
ognition. Either the stories are not
big enough to be bannered with
by-lines or the sport is out of sea
son, but still the boys are around
here most of the time turning out
their sports yarns.
Just let you Stanfordites know
who's behind the printer's ink on
the Daily's sports pages, here's
the complete sports staff.
John "Shallenbutch"' Shallen
berger, varsity football; Doug "Cyn
ic" Jaques, frosh football and box
ing; Harry "Pretzel" Press, grid
roundups and features; Walt
"Blondie" Peterson, features and
varsity basketball; Arch "Junget"
