# Tiny Mum On Saturday Starters
## S.C. To See New Plays, New Players Paulman Polishes Punt Form for Troy Tilt; McMillan at Guard 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Although Coach Tiny Thornhill
claims he will not know the starting
line-up until Saturday afternoon,
the fact that he chose a group of
top-notch ball-players to continue
this week's practices together indi
cates that he has a good idea who
will get the starting call against
University of Southern California.
Frank McMillan will start for the

first time this year. He played an
excellent game as second-string
guard against Oregon State last
week, and if he continues his fine
performance Saturday, he can be
sure of a first-string berth.
Paulman Kicking
Bill Paulman is practicing with
Tiny's chosen team this week and
will probably play a large part of
the U.S.C. game. Since he injured
his shoulder a month ago, the quiet
blond quarterback has had little
chance to practice kicking, which
has made him famous.
As a result, his timing was off last
week-end. But he will probably
practice booting today and tomor
row so that he can be in his old
shape in kickoffs, conversions, and
possibly field goals.
Calvelli at Center
Tony Calvelli will get the call at
center, with Stone and Willard on
the ends. Zagar and Andersen will
again start at tackles, while Dakan
will hold his usual guard post.
Fred Ledeboer and Jimmy Coffis
will begin in halfback posts, but
they expect to be relieved a great
part of the game by Bill Kirsch and
Pete Fay, respectively. Jim Groves
will again start at fullback.
This team has spent the greater
part of practice sessions this week
running through 16 new plays Tiny
has cooked up. Ten plays have
been discarded.
They scrimmaged the second
string yesterday after a long prac
tice session against Trojan offensive
maneuvers.
