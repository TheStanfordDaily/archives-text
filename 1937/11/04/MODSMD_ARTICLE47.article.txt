## Papoose Morale Is Rising Freshmen May Surprise Cal, Says Shipkey Frosh Gridders in Good Mental Condition For Saturday's Contest 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Cal is being tricky again.
The boys from Berkeley have,
from time to time, read the city pa
pers and found that the team rated
as underdogs has a psychological
advantage. So they are booming
Stanford as heavy favorites in the
Little Big Game.
Coach Harry Shipkey disagrees
with their publicity. no
cinch to win that game Saturday,"
he said. "We have a 50-50 chance
of winning. Nothing more."
"The boys are in good mental
condition, their morale is high, and
they'll be out to win that game. But
it will be far from a set-up."
Limits Attack
Shipkey has narrowed his attack
down to 10 running and 10 passing
plays—all designed to work against
Cal's defense. He is emphasizing
his ground attack. He plans to run
over Cal the way Cal has run over
the Papoose in past years.
He's also working on his kicking
game. Thor Peterson is kicking for
a half hour every afternoon in or
der to be ready to match Jerry
Lutz's long boots Saturday. Lutz,
besides his kicking, will be the man
to stop Friday. Reports floating
across the bay say that he is the
man responsible for bringing about
most of Cal's scores this year, in one
way or another.
Tricky Pass
Ever since Bobby Grayson was a
freshman, Cal has been working a
long, delayed pass against Stanford
—a pass that has won many Little
Big Games for them. The frosh are
working up a defense this week to
keep that play from wining this
Little Big Game.
This pass has an interesting point
aside from its potentiality for mak
ing touchdowns possible. A tackle
throws the ball. Grant Brians, 195-
pound lineman, comes back to the
backfield and starts what looks like
a sweeping run around left end.
Then, when he's way out on the left
side of the field, he throws a long
one to his right end. It looks like
a workout for Stanford's left half if
the Cubs try this play very often.
Cal Has Power
Cal has two other weapons be
sides long-kicking Lutz and a long
distance pass: a hard-charging line
and a flow of intimidating talk.
Every year Cal has a fast, hard
charging line. They have one this
year. It will be the frosh's job to
out-charge this line and open up
holes for Norm Standlee and Quen
tin Thompson to drive through.
Have Tough Talk
And this year, as every year, Cal
will come here Saturday to try to
talk the Papoose out of the game.
No matter what kind of a team they
have, they have a lot of tough talk.
Clint Evans not only teaches his
boys football, he teaches them elo
cution. The frosh will have to ig
nore a lot of brow-beating.
Cal has another thing in their fa
vor, too. Their teafn will be in bet
ter shape. The Papoose first-string
played the full game against San
Mateo Saturday, while Cal's first
strihg played only the first half
against Sacramento J. C. Conse
quenlty Stanford's frosh had twice
the chance to pick up bruises and
sore muscles.
