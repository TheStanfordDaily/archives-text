# Lange Answers Criticism Of 'Murder in Cathedral'
## 
### 
"There wasn't a person who saw
'Murder in the Cathedral' and did
n't get something out of it," de
clared Gordon C. Lange, director of
"Murder in the Cathedral," at
Luncheon Club yesterday.
Lange's statement was- prompted
by "a small campus group's" saying
"Murder in the Cathedral" wasn't
very enjoyable. "Because of this,"
Lange asked, "should I say we will
present just those productions peo
ple want?" He then pointed out that
the theater is not merely for enter
tainment, and at a University some
attempt should be made to raise the
plane of audience likes and dislikes.
Defense Experiment
"If this is not done here, where
will it be done?" said Lange. "The
professional stage is interested only
in lining its pockets through popu
lar hits. And why not?"
Lange further stated one's first
experience with opera, fine litera
ture, or fine plays is not always
pleasant, because they are not un
derstood.
Work for Culture
"But with all such cultural mate
rial," Lange said, "you must give in
order to receive. Acquiring culture
and appreciation is hard work."
Lange pointed out the difference
between drama and movie tech
niques of enjoyment. In the movies,
one merely sits back and is amused.
This is not always true of plays.
