# Vibert To Play In L.A. Water Polo Games
## Listless Scrubs Halted As Indians Prepare For U.S.C., U.C.L.A. 
### 
Nort Thornton announced one
! more change in his water polo team
last night and then stopped a scrim
mage because his men were playing
listlessly. The Stanford squad leaves
tonight for a series with U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles Friday and
j Saturday.
Jack Vibert is able to swim about
j again and will start in place of Bill
j Hatch, who did so well in his first
j game against the Olympic Club. Vi
| bert is more experienced than Hatch
and possesses more weight, a factor
I that might mean a lot in at least one
■ of the southern tilts.
First One Tough
The first U.S.C.-Stanford game in
Enema Pools was a roughhouse, al
though few fouls were called. The
| conference referees have shown a
i tendency to call only the most ob
vious fouls, letting players amuse
! themselves as they wish. Conse
quently the bulk of Hanna, Lamb,
j and Vibert should make a difference
; in the play of the Indians.
The Bruins are rated as being at
least as strong as the Trojans. They
I made twiA as many goals on Cali
fornia's "Wonder Water Team" as
; did U.S.C. And U.S.C. defeated the
| Cards 2 to 1.
Despite their sad showing last
night, the Indians seem to have
j gotten most of their poor play out
of their systems. Before the refor
mation. they once allowed the Olym
pians five goals in as many minutes
before they settled down.
Practice all week has been in the
short GO - foot tank, inasmuch as
' both the opponents' pools are of that
J size. The lone Stanford victory thus
far wag won in the short Olympic
' tank.
I A scrimmage against the frosh this
| afternoon will wind up the squad's
j homework for their week-end series.
