## Dial 3121 -- But Be Ready to Wait 
### 
SANDWICHED between recent barrages for
the medical aid of the Stanford Libe and
Sunday Nite for the Spanish Loyalists, has come
a continuous stream of written and oral com
ment to the little green shack which inevitably
takes the same monotonous vein. What is the
matter with the telephone setup? they drop in
to ask, bleary and fuming after a long wait with
out success. "I've found that the quickest way
is to hop in my car and drive over," one campus
opinionator wrote. But we were prone to toss
their talk into the rapidly filling sour-grapery
and skip it.
The other night it hit home. One of The
Daily's new reporters slipped into the phone
booth, skillfully dialed 3121, and began the wait.
Tired, she leaned against the wall.
Twenty minutes later, wrapped in the arms
of Morpheus and forgotten by the Toyon switch
men, she caused all production to cease while
a curious staff gathered round a sleeping re
porter. Awakened when the photographer's
flash gun caught her napping, she covered re
buke with the current complaintâ€”"they didn't
answer."
Whether Stanford's telephone problem is one

of personnel or of physical limitation is uncer
tain. The Toyon board has 12 outgoing trunks,
and 8 incoming, these lines to be handled by
one operator. Preference is given to outgoing
calls from the halls.
In addition, the Toyon board must handle the
business of the Union desk. A caller at the
Union will be announced to the callee by a
roundabout telephone message to Toyon, which
in turn will buzz the Union room, which will
answer the Toyon call, which will answer the
Union desk call.
Men on the Toyon board have expressed the
belief that handling the Union's calling system
is the margin of inefficiency. If such inter-hall
communication could be carried on independ
ent of the Toyon board, service would be
greatly improved.
This may be the answer to Stanford's delayed
buck telephone system. It may be only a par
tial remedy.
The Daily's policy this volume is to withhold
the gripe when possible. Now, not for the sake
of the complaint, but for the fuming multitudes,
it appears.
Stanford's inter-campus communication must
be investigated.
