\\PROSTITUTION can flourish only if public
1 opinion consents to it.
With this challenge, the Daily Illini has joined
forces with the University of Illinois administra
tion, prepared to wage a war to the finish against
"syndicated red light districts."
Mobilizing all resources into an integrated
fighting force, the university opened fire last
week with a public demand to twin-city police
forces to "get busy."
First step in the military-like campaign was to
issue a warning that all university students
found in the red light districts would be imme
diately expelled. It was announced that no ex
cuses would be heard and no exceptions made.
It is with this uncompromising attitude that
the university hopes to win its war on vice.
Allied with national clean-up movements and
backed to the hilt by both students and towns
people, the fight is being carried into the ene
mies' camp.
Traditionally inactive police are being agi
tated into a furor of raids and arrests, Chicago
health officers have been commandeered to
supervise the campaign, more than forty-five
campus and city organizations have volunteered
active support, "vital statistics" have been pub
lished—all with the result that the front lines of

prostitution are wavering, perhaps about to
break.
Meanwhile, the Daily Illini publisher a daily
expose—not flamboyant ballyhoo, but accurate
portrayals—of the inside workings of various
bawdy houses. Side by side with these articles
is an "Honor Roll," not of those who died fight
ing but of those who are willing to fight.
Daily Illini editors are planning their drive
sensibly and carefully in conjunction with uni
versity authorities. Special care is being taken
so that the drive will not take on the aspects of
a bunch of sensation-crazed college journalists
trying to break into Time's columns—which
they did without trying.
If they keep on as they have started, if they
continue to work closely with the university
administration, and maintain their ceaseless bar
rage, they can hope to succeed.
Their success will not be complete; it cannot
be. They may, however, disorganize organized
prostitution, the first step in pulling their dirty
linen off the line.—J. R.

Mobilizing all resources into an integrated
fighting force, the university opened fire last
week with a public demand to twin-city police
forces to "get busy."
First step in the military-like campaign was to
issue a warning that all university students
found in the red light districts would be imme
diately expelled. It was announced that no ex
cuses would be heard and no exceptions made.
It is with this uncompromising attitude that
the university hopes to win its war on vice.
Allied with national clean-up movements and
backed to the hilt by both students and towns
people, the fight is being carried into the ene
mies' camp.
Traditionally inactive police are being agi
tated into a furor of raids and arrests, Chicago
health officers have been commandeered to
supervise the campaign, more than forty-five
campus and city organizations have volunteered
active support, "vital statistics" have been pub
lished—all with the result that the front lines of

prostitution are wavering, perhaps about to
break.
Meanwhile, the Daily Illini publisher a daily
expose—not flamboyant ballyhoo, but accurate
portrayals—of the inside workings of various
bawdy houses. Side by side with these articles
is an "Honor Roll," not of those who died fight
ing but of those who are willing to fight.
Daily Illini editors are planning their drive
sensibly and carefully in conjunction with uni
versity authorities. Special care is being taken
so that the drive will not take on the aspects of
a bunch of sensation-crazed college journalists
trying to break into Time's columns—which
they did without trying.
If they keep on as they have started, if they
continue to work closely with the university
administration, and maintain their ceaseless bar
rage, they can hope to succeed.
Their success will not be complete; it cannot
be. They may, however, disorganize organized
prostitution, the first step in pulling their dirty
linen off the line.—J. R.
