LIFE, LIBERTY, PURSUIT OF STREETCARS
when I catch up on my work I am going
k to drop in on the psych department and ask some
body why the San Francisco voters ignored the soul
stirring efforts of their newspapers and dinged the
proposed subway. Probably the psychology professors
won't be able to answer. And I am not setting my
heart on enlightenment from sociologists or political
scientists. It will take a good deal of explaining to
reconcile the voters' decisions with our ancient faith
in the "power of the press."
San Francisco newspapers backed the subway proj
ect with an enthusiasm that was almost touching.
Editorials shouted its praises with a combination of
cold logic and stirring exhortation that would have
drawn an approving smile from Cicero. Practically
no one opposed the subway except the street car
companies, who might conceivably be biased. And yet
the voters said "No, no, 35,000 times no."

Alarmed observers who tremble at the way news
papers mould public opinion might find considerable
comfort in the voters' decision. It appears that ap
proval by the press does not make voting unneces
sary. There seem to be other forces inspiring the
good burgher when he reaches for the lever on the
balloting machine.
On (his the professors will undoubtedly agree. The
flat rejection of the subway plan is very much like
the Roosevelt "landslide" which brought blushes to
the cheeks of so many embattled editors. But I think it
.safe to predict that there will be quite a bit of
wrangling about the causes of the independence of
our electorate.

J POSSIBLY in this propaganda-minded age we have
gotten our reaction patterns scrambled. Our re
sistance to the lures of Utopia-overnight schemes may
carry over to any suggestion that is made.
Or perhaps the American public has developed to
that stage of half-educated cynicism where it reasons
that anybody with an opinion is expecting to get
cash dividends out of it. The suspicious pessimism of
a banker considering a loan looks very much like
Christian tenderness in comparison with the attitude
of a voter who thinks he is being rooked.

Obviously something influenced the voters. After
one ride on the San Francisco street cars, no one
could believe that the citizens cling to them because
of their efficiency and comfort. And sentimental ten
derness for the companies would hardly account for a
majority of 35,000.
It may be that I am doing the street car companies
an injustice. Perhaps they put the whole thing over
with those little advertisements that run around the
inside of the walls of the cars. But if those little
posters have such a hypnotic effect, we have over
looked a painless method of settling the whole transit
problem. With so potent an influence under their con
trol. the street car companies could raise advertis
ing rates and abolish fares entirely. Later they might
even take over the functions of the newspapers.
Perhaps in the future the "power of the trolley"
will be a storm center; and freedom of speech and
street car will be a right we militantly defend.
