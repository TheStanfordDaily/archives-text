Men's Rest Home
Nov. 3, 1937
Rest Home had hardly subsided from the Great
Hank's illustrious stray when we arrived. It
seems that when the basketball star left the hospital
and came here, the S. F. Chronicle ran a little squib
at the foot of one of its columns to the effect that he
had gone to the "Stanford Men's Rest Room."
We got to talking about fraternity initiations with
Mrs. Allen, official administrator of synapisms, and
she had an interesting bit to tell us.
It was late one night, long after she had gone to
bed, when the front door-bell rang. Hurriedly she
opened the door, and, with a sinking feeling, planned
where to put the three lads she saw before her. All
they wanted, however, was a baby-buggy, explain
ing: "You sec, it's Hell Week at our House." Mrs.
Allen didn't have one, and couldn't tell them where to
get one, so they went off, dismayed by their failure,
but in the direction of the Women's Rest Home.
Just before we got in here, we heard about the
Delt initiation, which took place during last week
end's Hallowe'en affair. Anyway, the Delts, in full
regalia, were somewhat disturbed by the children of
the neighborhood, also in full regalia of the season,
so the Delts came out of their house, and the children
said, "Oh! Are you having a Hallowe'en party too?"
So here I sit with an infra-red lamp in my face,
5x9 Cclluwipes (interfoldcd) on one side, and throat
irrigations in the next room. Well, time for 4 o'clock
orange juice.
jl/fRS. ALLEN has definitely decided on starting a
matrimonial bureau as a sideline for the Rest
Home business. She feels that here she sees Stanford
men at their worst, much as they would be married.
Now she would rate them individually, and whenever
a girl wanted to get the low-down on a fellow, she
could come over and pay so much down for the
rating and additional information. This way there
would be plenty of money for additional small com
forts for the Rest Home.
But then she says she likes all the boys too well,
and the girls would soon find they were duped. She
might start out with an occasional jolly-up. That
would liven things up, but it's out of the question now
when there are so few girls in Women's Rest Home.
So, women, answer the plea of a poor sick lad,
and get sick quick.

orange juice.
jl/fRS. ALLEN has definitely decided on starting a
matrimonial bureau as a sideline for the Rest
Home business. She feels that here she sees Stanford
men at their worst, much as they would be married.
Now she would rate them individually, and whenever
a girl wanted to get the low-down on a fellow, she
could come over and pay so much down for the
rating and additional information. This way there
would be plenty of money for additional small com
forts for the Rest Home.
But then she says she likes all the boys too well,
and the girls would soon find they were duped. She
might start out with an occasional jolly-up. That
would liven things up, but it's out of the question now
when there are so few girls in Women's Rest Home.
So, women, answer the plea of a poor sick lad,
and get sick quick.
Men's Rest Home
Nov. 3, 1937
Rest Home had hardly subsided from the Great
Hank's illustrious stray when we arrived. It
seems that when the basketball star left the hospital
and came here, the S. F. Chronicle ran a little squib
at the foot of one of its columns to the effect that he
had gone to the "Stanford Men's Rest Room."
We got to talking about fraternity initiations with
Mrs. Allen, official administrator of synapisms, and
she had an interesting bit to tell us.
It was late one night, long after she had gone to
bed, when the front door-bell rang. Hurriedly she
opened the door, and, with a sinking feeling, planned
where to put the three lads she saw before her. All
they wanted, however, was a baby-buggy, explain
ing: "You sec, it's Hell Week at our House." Mrs.
Allen didn't have one, and couldn't tell them where to
get one, so they went off, dismayed by their failure,
but in the direction of the Women's Rest Home.
Just before we got in here, we heard about the
Delt initiation, which took place during last week
end's Hallowe'en affair. Anyway, the Delts, in full
regalia, were somewhat disturbed by the children of
the neighborhood, also in full regalia of the season,
so the Delts came out of their house, and the children
said, "Oh! Are you having a Hallowe'en party too?"
