# Lamson Novel Indicts Wheels Of Injustice
## 
### 
Quietly written, with little of the
bitterness its author might be ex
pected to put into it, David Lam
son's "Whirlpool" is a terse indict
ment of all the paraphernalia which
yearly combine to send innocent
men to the gallows. Without pas-

sion he relates
the way in which
the maelstrom of
the law can drag
its victims down
to implacable de
struction.
Circumstantial
evidence is the
villain of this
tale, as it was of
Mr. Lamson's own

case. Circumstantial evidence and
a yellow press and small-town poli
tics and an ambitious district at
torney.
When mild Hannibal Norfolk
drives his younger brother Joel
from home because he thinks he is
making love to Hannibal's wife
Martha, it furnishes Millertown
with a brief bit of spicy gossip. But
when a skeleton is found on Hanni
bal's farm three years later, the
gossip becomes magnified until it
reaches the front pages of the na
tion, the quarrel becomes a mur
der, and the bones become those of
Joel Norfolk.
While Joel is bumming his way
back and forth across the country,
Hannibal is brought to trial in Mil
lertown; and finally, after the press
has had its Roman holiday and the
district attorney has built himself
his reputation, and Hannibal and
Martha have been broken on the
wheels of publicity and politics, he
is convicted and ' sentenced to die.
Before he can be legally killed,
however, he is killed while trying
to break prison, and the case of the
State vs. Norfolk comes to its ironic
end with Joel's reappearance.
The implications of Mr. Lamson's
story are only too clear; and he
writes with a sincerity born of bit
ter experience. That such perver
sion of justice can exist in Amer
ica is nothing to be proud of; but it
is a matter for pride that those who
see this perversion are writing
about it and pointing the way to
its correction.
