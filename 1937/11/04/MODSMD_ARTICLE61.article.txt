# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your rather belated raving reve
lations, P. M., cause my head to
droop with shame. And to think
that I have been writing "Stompin'
Around" while you, like all good
martyrs, have suffered nobly for
weeks suppressing your vastly su
perior knowledge in an effort to
avoid making me look silly. But
now, I take it, duty and the limits
of human endurance call you to
protect all music-lovers from the
stain of my so-called grut. My man,
carry on — nothing ventured, noth
ing gained, you know.
You say, among sputtering bub
bles of foam and froth, that you
wouldn't have had the nerve to sign
your name to my column — well,
P. M. (post mortem?), I had enough,
but where was your name at the
end of your charming little billet
doux?
I join heartily with you in your
praise of Prendergast — nobody
could touch Curt, 1 grant you. But
do you know why he was so suc
cessful, other than the fact that he
knew music from all angles? Sim
ply because he could toss the English
language about so deftly that 99 out
of 100 people didn't know what he
was talking about, even though he
was sufficiently clear to himself. In
that way, he cleverly avoided ham
mer-headed arguments, something I
apparenlty can't do.
You further say I'm trite with my
swing expressions — according to
your standards, Webster's ideas
about the word "trite" are very pe
culiar. More than that, on the as
sumption that you will answer this
letter, I'll venture that you can't
tell me, drawing from your own
store of musical knowledge, what
these "trite" terms mean: "gut
bucket," "New York tone," and "way
down room." Did your year of piano
with Mrs. McGlurk stop with 'di
minuendo" and "allegro"? So they're
trite? Pish-tash, lad.
"Just what the hell is a swing
technician," you ask. For shame, for
shame! One of Phil Harris' boys
happened to tell me that when a
band becomes stylized to the degree
that it loses a part of its natui'al

freedom and flexibility and begins to
WORK it plays only technically.
But maybe inexperienced hams like
him don't know anything about it.
And how did you so coyly guess
that I suggested McCoy for the Co
tillion, and who let it out that my
fraterntiy gives me all my ideas?
(At that, 98 per cent of 'em are as
musically smart as you appear to
be, and they don't read Downbeat,
either!) Hawkshaw, you are truly a
marvel!
When I said Kemp rated over
Goodman, I clearly implied that it
was Kemp's versatility that made j
the difference; your use of the
Downbeat poll treats bands as be- |
longing to a class, such as sweet or j
swing, and not as a single group, j
Still, you say they're both tops in j
their respective classes? All right, j
you tell me why Goodman is better 1
—if you're logically convincing, I'll
forever hold my peace.
I'd suggest that you personally
embellish my meager supply of in
formation. My phone number if j
8954, Collie Small IS my right name |
and I'll sign that same name at the j
bottom. When we meet, have a new
name for the column, will you, |
P.M.? Better yet, if you're not busy I
with criticisms, you might dash off i
my next article for me.

Collie Small
The Editor, Sir:
Your rather belated raving reve
lations, P. M., cause my head to
droop with shame. And to think
that I have been writing "Stompin'
Around" while you, like all good
martyrs, have suffered nobly for
weeks suppressing your vastly su
perior knowledge in an effort to
avoid making me look silly. But
now, I take it, duty and the limits
of human endurance call you to
protect all music-lovers from the
stain of my so-called grut. My man,
carry on — nothing ventured, noth
ing gained, you know.
You say, among sputtering bub
bles of foam and froth, that you
wouldn't have had the nerve to sign
your name to my column — well,
P. M. (post mortem?), I had enough,
but where was your name at the
end of your charming little billet
doux?
I join heartily with you in your
praise of Prendergast — nobody
could touch Curt, 1 grant you. But
do you know why he was so suc
cessful, other than the fact that he
knew music from all angles? Sim
ply because he could toss the English
language about so deftly that 99 out
of 100 people didn't know what he
was talking about, even though he
was sufficiently clear to himself. In
that way, he cleverly avoided ham
mer-headed arguments, something I
apparenlty can't do.
You further say I'm trite with my
swing expressions — according to
your standards, Webster's ideas
about the word "trite" are very pe
culiar. More than that, on the as
sumption that you will answer this
letter, I'll venture that you can't
tell me, drawing from your own
store of musical knowledge, what
these "trite" terms mean: "gut
bucket," "New York tone," and "way
down room." Did your year of piano
with Mrs. McGlurk stop with 'di
minuendo" and "allegro"? So they're
trite? Pish-tash, lad.
