# Debaters Argue Merits Of Labor Board Action

"What is friendly and peaceful about compulsory arbitration?"
"What is friendly about a strike?"
These were the questions asked yesterday afternoon as College of the
Pacific and Stanford debaters argued the relative merits of the National

►Labor Relations Board in two sepa- j
rate meets.
In the first scheduled debate, Jean
Halliburton and Carl Deisenroth of
the Cardinals met Erwin Farley and
Louis Sandine, C.O.P. student body
president, at 3 o'clock in Room 202.
At the same time in Room 201 John
Moscovics and Bob Carpenter en
gaged Martin Puligh and Gregg Phi
fer of the Bengals.
In both debates Stanford took the
negative side of the question, "Re
solved, that the National Labor Re
lations Board should be empowered
to enforce arbitration of all indus
trial disputes." The two matches
lines are adequate for speedy serv
were both non-decision.
Keynoting the negative cases, Jean
Halliburton stated that compulsory
arbitration "is a condition desired by
neither capital nor labor." The
Board is not the logical body to
handle enforced arbitration. Com
pulsory arbitration would be a dan
gerous centralization of power in the
hands of a political body.
Pointing out that the N.L.R.B. will
stimulate and legitimize collective
bargaining, Louis Sandine pressed
the affirmative point that nothing
can be done until people get to
gether. Because the board is politi
cal; labor, capital, and the consumer

will all have a check on the board,
he emphasized.
Frosh to Open Season
Frosh debaters Sherman Mellin
koff and Sidney Terry are invading
the Southland today to open their
debating season.
This morning the pail will meet
Los Angeles High School and to
night will engage U.S.C. Tomorrow
morning they have tentatively
scheduled a meet with U.C.L.A.
All three debates will be on the
Pi Kappa Delta question of the Na
tional Labor Relations Board. The
Cardinal representatives will take
the affirmative in all three non-de
cision debates.

cal; labor, capital, and the consumer

will all have a check on the board,
he emphasized.

koff and Sidney Terry are invading
