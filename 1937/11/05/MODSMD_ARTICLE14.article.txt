# "Peak Hours" Stall Phone Service
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
"It is this dating business that
causes all of the telephone trouble."
That is the explanation that Miss
Louise Price, director of the Union
Unit, offered last night for what is
wrong with the campus telephone
system and particularly for what is
wrong with exchange number 3121,
which serves Encina, Toyon, and
Branner halls, and the Union.
The most frequent cause of com
plaint, Miss Price said, is the length
of time necessary to place calls
through the switchboard in Toyon,
particularly at "peak hours" during
the evening.
'Peak Hours' Told
"Peak hours" each day, when it
often takes several minutes to com
plete incoming or outgoing calls to
the halls, are for about an bout be
fore dinner, and then from 7 to 8
o'clock in the evening, Miss Price
stated.
Toyon student telephone opera
tors confirmed this, and added that
from 8:30 to 9:30 o'clock and from
10:30 to 11 o'clock—when the ex
change closes—are also busy pe
riods.
Causes Lockouts
Several Union residents have re
ceived lockouts because of the

slowness of the telephone service,
Miss Price declared, and in some
cases it has taken as long as 20
minutes to make an incoming call.
When the Union was opened in
1922 as a hall for graduate men stu
dents, it had a P.B.X. (private
branch exchange) of its own, she

explained. Al the students' request,
this exchange was soon removed and
their telephones were connected
with the Toyon exchange.
The Union was turned into a
women's hall in but no change
was made in the telephone connec
tion. After several complaints were
made about the service, Miss Price
and Miss Anastasia Doyle conducted
an investigation, and found that the
cost of installing a Union P.B.X.
system would be around $400.
Exchange 'Outgrown'
"At the present time the Toyon
exchange has been outgrown," Miss
Price declared, but she isn't certain
what the answer is. The installation
of a campus-wide telephone ex
change might be the best permanent
solution to the problem, she believes.
Another side of the problem is
presented by the five student opera
tors on the Toyon exchange, who
have the problem of serving ap
proximately 1000 students on a 12-
t.runk line board.
The Toyon exchange has eight
lines that can be used for both in
coming and outgoing calls, while
four lines are reserved exclusively
for outgoing messages.
During most of the day these


Asleep at the switch
ice, the operators explain, but dur
ing the "peak hours" in the late
afternoon and evenings, service yets
in a sorry jam, mainly because
there aren't enough lines to handle
all of the calls. ,
Four nights a week an extra op
erator is employed in the exchange
from 7 to 9 o'clock, in order to aid
in handling the "peak hour" calls.
Long distance calls, and calls from
fraternity houses during rushing pe
riods, are the chief causes of delays
in service at the present time, it is
explained.
Fear Big Game
One-fourth of the operators' time
is taken at present in handling
Union calls. If Union were connect
ed with the Roble P.B.X. system, the
operators think they could give bet
ter service to the men's halls.
Another possible improvement in
the future would be to install a 24-
trunk line exchange in Toyon, but
at present the operators are dis
mally anticipating the flood of calls
on Big Game Day. One of them pre
dicted that "everything will just go
to pieces then."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (U.R).—
Committees from the American Fed
eration of Labor and the Committee

today to continue peace conferences
tomorrow to consider compromise
proposals for a truce.

ter service to the men's halls.
Another possible improvement in
the future would be to install a 24-
trunk line exchange in Toyon, but
at present the operators are dis
mally anticipating the flood of calls
on Big Game Day. One of them pre
dicted that "everything will just go
to pieces then."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (U.R).—
Committees from the American Fed
eration of Labor and the Committee
i for Industrial Organization agreed
today to continue peace conferences
tomorrow to consider compromise
proposals for a truce.
"It is this dating business that
causes all of the telephone trouble."
That is the explanation that Miss
Louise Price, director of the Union
Unit, offered last night for what is
wrong with the campus telephone
system and particularly for what is
wrong with exchange number 3121,
which serves Encina, Toyon, and
Branner halls, and the Union.
The most frequent cause of com
plaint, Miss Price said, is the length
of time necessary to place calls
through the switchboard in Toyon,
particularly at "peak hours" during
the evening.
'Peak Hours' Told
"Peak hours" each day, when it
often takes several minutes to com
plete incoming or outgoing calls to
the halls, are for about an bout be
fore dinner, and then from 7 to 8
o'clock in the evening, Miss Price
stated.
Toyon student telephone opera
tors confirmed this, and added that
from 8:30 to 9:30 o'clock and from
10:30 to 11 o'clock—when the ex
change closes—are also busy pe
riods.
Causes Lockouts
Several Union residents have re
ceived lockouts because of the

slowness of the telephone service,
Miss Price declared, and in some
cases it has taken as long as 20
minutes to make an incoming call.
When the Union was opened in
1922 as a hall for graduate men stu
dents, it had a P.B.X. (private
branch exchange) of its own, she

explained. Al the students' request,
this exchange was soon removed and
their telephones were connected
with the Toyon exchange.
The Union was turned into a
women's hall in but no change
was made in the telephone connec
tion. After several complaints were
made about the service, Miss Price
and Miss Anastasia Doyle conducted
an investigation, and found that the
cost of installing a Union P.B.X.
system would be around $400.
Exchange 'Outgrown'
"At the present time the Toyon
exchange has been outgrown," Miss
Price declared, but she isn't certain
what the answer is. The installation
of a campus-wide telephone ex
change might be the best permanent
solution to the problem, she believes.
Another side of the problem is
presented by the five student opera
tors on the Toyon exchange, who
have the problem of serving ap
proximately 1000 students on a 12-
t.runk line board.
The Toyon exchange has eight
lines that can be used for both in
coming and outgoing calls, while
four lines are reserved exclusively
for outgoing messages.
During most of the day these


Asleep at the switch
ice, the operators explain, but dur
ing the "peak hours" in the late
afternoon and evenings, service yets
in a sorry jam, mainly because
there aren't enough lines to handle
all of the calls. ,
Four nights a week an extra op
erator is employed in the exchange
from 7 to 9 o'clock, in order to aid
in handling the "peak hour" calls.
Long distance calls, and calls from
fraternity houses during rushing pe
riods, are the chief causes of delays
in service at the present time, it is
explained.
Fear Big Game
One-fourth of the operators' time
is taken at present in handling
Union calls. If Union were connect
ed with the Roble P.B.X. system, the
operators think they could give bet
ter service to the men's halls.
Another possible improvement in
the future would be to install a 24-
trunk line exchange in Toyon, but

the future would be to install a 24-
trunk line exchange in Toyon, but
at present the operators are dis
mally anticipating the flood of calls
on Big Game Day. One of them pre
dicted that "everything will just go
to pieces then."
