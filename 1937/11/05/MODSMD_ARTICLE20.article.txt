# Big Red Machine Enroute To Troy, Ready For Siege
## Last Week's Goose-egg Scores Whet Both Teams to Fighting Pitch 
### GENE GEAR 
EN ROUTE TO THE WALLS OF TROY. Nov. 4.—Stanford's Itß«>d
Machine is on the road rolling toward the land of the Tro.ians, with Tiny
Thornhill at the wheel.
It's going to he a real siege of Troy. Both the Indians and the Trojans
are fighting mad after their respective goose egg gathering last week-end.

Sports writers in the north are
rating the game a toss-up, but as we
progress southward, the sports crit
ics are all favoring the Trojans be
cause of Stanford's scoreless tie
with the Beavers. Maybe the
southern enthusiasts would like to
have us believe that the Trojans
looked much better in ending up a
scoreless tie with the Cougars dur
ing the same afternoon.
Paulman To Start
Card hopes were brightened con
siderably when Tiny announced
that blond Bill Paulman will prob
ably start at quarterback tomor
row. Bootin' Bill engaged in scrim
mage this week, and his injured
shoulder came through the ordeal
with no ill effects. Bill's presence
in there may add plenty to Stan
ford's passing and running attacks.
Leo Ferko's leg injury has healed
sufficiently so that he may start to
morrow at left guard for the In
j dians. It's still a toss-up there be
! tween dark-eyed Leo and Frank
! McMillan, who played such fine
ball against the Beavers.
Tony at Center
From all indications, Tony Cal-
I veili will probably be perched on
! the top end of the centering see
| saw. Last week it was Louis Tsout
: souvas, now it's Tony's turn. The
: kick-off choice may determine the
! starter here, however.
! Those giant standbys, Pete Zagar
! and Stan Andersen, are first choices
! again at the tackle spots, with Bob
j Dakan apparently headed for the
! starting post at right guard.
Backfield Indefinite
Captain Grant Stone will team
I with Big Bill Willard at the two
flank positions. The backfield
won't be definitely posted until
game time, although right now Tiny
has Freddie Ledeboer and Jimmy
Coffis starting at halves, Paulman at
quarter, and Jim Groves at full
back. Pete Fay, Tiny's new spark
plug, may get the starting call over
Coffis. At any rate, Bold Pete will
see plenty of action. Bill Kirsch,
one of the coast's greatest tacklers,
will press Ledeboer at right half.
Down in the Trojan camp, Head
man Howard Jones has revamped
his backfield in an attempt to meet
Stanford's speed. Mickey Anderson
at halfback and Bill Sangster at
full will see service in the new set
up. Ambrose Schindler, quarter,
and Wayne Hoffman, half, complete
Troy's probable starting backfield.
Stanford's biggest problem will be
to stop the antics of Mr. Schindler.
His off-tackle thrusts are devastat
ing, and his high leg action makes
him hard to down. Cal stopped him
and the Cougars and the fog put an
end to his cavorting up north, bul
the big question mark is: can Tiny's
boys do it in Troy's own backyard
tomorrow afternoon?
