# Ski Group Elects New Club Officers
## 
### 
Although no snow has fallen as
yet the Stanford Ski Club held its
first meeting for the year last night.
The 50 members present elected
E. W. Meyer, president, Lester Louis
and William James, vice-presidents,
and Jean Rankins, secretary-treas
urer.
A membership committee was
appointed to get in touch with the
living groups and halls in an effort
to have interested skiers join the
club and increase the membership
to nearer last year's 200 members.
Another committee was organized
to see about getting special rates at
Yosemite for Stanford skiers. There
were also steps taken to have a girl's
ski team which would compete with
Mills College.
Before the business meeting, mov
ing pictures on skiing were shown.
Films taken by Bob Starkweather at
the world championships in Ins
bruck, Austria, last year, were of
special interest to the skiers. This
is supposed to be one of the rough
est and most dangerous courses in
Europe as over 30 per cent of the
contestants were injured.
