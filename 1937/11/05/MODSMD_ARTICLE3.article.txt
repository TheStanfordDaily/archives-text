# Fliers Will Meet Trojan Aviators
## 
### 
.The Stanford Flying Club will
compete this Saturday in its second
intercollegiate meet when they clash
with U.S.C. at Mines Field, Santa
Monica. This will be a return of a
meet held here last year.
Stanford's club, headed this year
by Bob Townsend, is better than in
past years and hopes to defeat the
strong Trojan aggregation.
The meet is a preliminary which
is hoped to rouse enough interest for
the formation of a Pacific Coast Con
ference in flying.
Mines Field has been secured for
the contest by the U.S.C. club and
is well adapted for the meet. This
field was the scene of the National
Air Races held several years ago on
the Coast.
Each club contains eleven mem
bers which are divided into two
classes, constituted by the Taylor
Cub and Fleet planes.
