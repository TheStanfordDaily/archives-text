with the other contest entries for
final competition judging in Decem

competition must be accompanied
by an entry blank—available for 10

upstairs in the Press Building, or
free from David Keeble's, 323 Uni

graphic purchase. Complete rules
may be obtained from the Division
of Journalism or from Keeble's.
All .entries, including those used
by Frost in his Big Game Edition,
will be hung in the Nitery for cam
pus exhibition the first week in De
cember. Contest closes officially De
cember 1.
Thirty dollars in cash and mer
chandise prizes will be distributed
among the sweepstakes winner and
the winners of the three main di
visions of the competition—pictorial,
