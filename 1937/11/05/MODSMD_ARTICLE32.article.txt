# Destroy Ties? No! Let Us Wreck "Em

### 
OBERLIN, 0., Nov. 4 (UP). â€”
Oberlin College's Mummers' Club is
going to do something for men who
get none - too - carefully - chosen
Christmas and birthday ties.
The school's newspaper asked
that all such cravats be saved for
use in the club's "Mumblings of
1938," a presentation described as
"an extremely destructive one as
regards neckwear."
