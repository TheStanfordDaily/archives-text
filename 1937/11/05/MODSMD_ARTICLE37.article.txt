# Encina Victuals Praised By '98er in Philippines
## 
### 
Encina grub "in its most degener
ate times" would have tasted good
to John M. Switzer, Stanfordite who
was fighting in the Philippines in
1898.
In a letter to Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Mr. Switzer thanked the
University for a Christmas box of
food and books. He declared that
even Encina food would taste good
after eight months as one of Stan
ford's 30 "volunteers" in the Span
ish-American War.
Looking through old papers last
week, President Wilbur found an
old copy of the Daily Palo Alto stuck
into a yellowed volume for a book
mark. In the newspaper was printed
this letter from the Philippines,
signed John M. Switzerâ€”For the
Boys.
"Always a cherishing mother,"

said Mr. Switzer of Stanford Uni
versity. He showed his gratitude
when he died last spring, leaving
the University $50,000 for scholar
ships, fellowships, and loan funds.
Making Stanford also residuary leg
atee, Mr. Switzer increased his total
bequest to somewhere between
$300,000 and $500,000. The exacf
amount has not yet been determined.
While in the Philippines, the "vol
unteers" missed the Big Game on
Thanksgiving Day. Stanford lost
22-0, but the letter said that "owing
to a false cablegram" they "had en
joyed for three days the proud de
lights of victors."
