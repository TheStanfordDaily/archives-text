Stanford Glee Club will present a series of three programs in celebra

The double quartet, composed of
Emilio Jauregui, Henry Bent, Oli

and Herb Wolley, will make the
Coast broadcast with a group of
Stanford songs.
Sing Big Game Day
The entire group of 40 male voices
will entertain on the night of No
vember 20, the day of the Big Game,
nt the Palace Hotel and may also
bo scheduled for a radio program at
that time, he said, although definite
plans have not been made.
Also at an alumni rally, the quar
tet will sing in San Jose for Stanford
graduates in that city on the eve
ning of November IH.
Program Set
In commenting on the Coast
broadcast, Cope said, "The program
this year will probably take the same
form as last year's, in which Cal was
given a half hour on the air and
Stanford a half hour. Just what
Gil's part will be, we are not cer
tain, but we do know that the quar
tet will present Stanford songs.
"Any tenors who are interested in
singing with the club will be given
full try-outs," he said, "inasmuch
as we need them badly."
