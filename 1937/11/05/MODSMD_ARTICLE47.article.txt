### 
A phenomenon is taking place at
Encina. Several rooms have founded
an Anti-swearing League in which
every oath said costs the oather
anywhere from a penny to a nickel,
depending on the power of the word.
This "throw a nickel on the drum,
save a soul, save a soul" plan has
been started to make the hall safe
for women, and the boys safe for the
outside world. If the League con
tinues to grow in numbers, "oh,
fudge," "gosh-darn," and "gee-whiz"
will become the main safety-valves
for the frosh."
Maybe someday it will even be
safe to drive past Encina with a gix'l
and yell, "To Hell with '41."
