# San Mateo, Card Poloists To Clash
## 
### 
Indian horsemen open their third
match against the powerful San
Mateo Polo Club here this afternoon
at 3:30 on the highway polo field.
This will be the deciding game in
the series played this far, with the
Peninsula group winning last week
12-6 and the Cards the week before,
6-4.
Starting for the Farm will be Jim
Fullerton (c) (1), Don McAusland
(2), Steve Downey (3), and Bert Mc
clintock (4). The lineup for the San
Mateo Polo Club will probably con
sist of George Pope (c) (3), Lloyd
Dinkelspiel (1), Bill Gilmore (2),
and Frank Fuller (4).
The Peninsula club puts a number
of separate squads on the field. The
group to be met today is the one
the Indians defeated in their first
encounter. While the Cards are usu
ally slightly outmounted by this club,
they stand a good chance of coming
thx*ough with a win today if they
click the way they started out the
season.
Dick Merrill will soon attempt a
four-day round-the-world flight
from London, to be financed by Lord
Beaverbrook.
