# Radio Development Seen Key To Air Safety, Speaker Says
## 
### 
Capt. Sigurd Varian has encoun
tered in his Hying experience every
thing from steam-rollers on airport
runways to .Mexican politics.
As a result of his service with
Pan American Airways in Central
America and Mexico, Capt. Varian
believes that the final solution of
the air pilot's problems must come
from the field of radio. As a re
search associate at Stanford, he is
devoting his energies to solving those
problems. ■
He addressed the Journal Club
of the physics department yester
day afternoon on the subject of the
"Origination of Instrument Flying."
He declared that the 190 instruments
on some transport panels ai*e there
for the benefit of the company's pub
licity agent and the ground me
chanic. The four basic instruments

on which a pilot depends and by
which he flies arc the air speed indi
cator, the bank and turn, altimeter
indicators and compass. "With these
and a half dozen others, the chief
pilot directs his ship's course, and
lets the co-pilot read the rest if he
isn't busy," Varian explained,
i Russell H. Varian, brother of Capt.
Varian, will speak to the club at its
next meeting November 11. They
are working on the klystron, an ap
paratus which produces micro-short
waves which have the properties of
light, but can still be treated as radio
waves. The klystron is a potential
anti-aircraft weapon.
