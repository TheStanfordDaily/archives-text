# Pacific Peace To Be Theme Of Convention
## Mountain Lodge Chosen As Site of S.I.P.R. Vocation Meeting 
### 
In 1926, visionaries of Pacific Coast
colleges organized and conducted
the first conference of the S.I.P.R.
Since then, the Student Institute of
Pacific Relations has flourished, until
now the Twelfth Annual Conference
will have delegates from 14 different
colleges and universities of the West.
The institute was originally organ
ized for the purpose of promoting
belter understanding among the
peoples of the countries bordering
on the Pacific Ocean. Every year
since 1926, students of different races
and nationalities have met during
t)u> Thanksgiving holidays to enjoy
the opportunity for frank discussion
and individual viewpoints regarding
the social, racial, cultural, and po
litical problems of the Pacific area.
Purpose Outlined
It is the purpose of the group to
encourage world peace by gathering
together students representing vari
ous racial groups and points of view
to form a voluntary organization
such as the S.I.P.R. in order to dis
cuss their common problems.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
his foreword to the Institute's pro
ceedings at the Eighth Annual Con
ference, said: "Such an organization
as the Student Institute of Pacific
Relations can be of unusual help in
bringing before a group of young
and interested students those prob
lems of the Pacific which arc so hard
to solve.
"If the co-operation of a group
of students can be obtained during
the university period, we shall have
assurance that at least some of them
will keep their interest going
throughout life. Upon such inter
ested men and women in the various
countries rests much of the future
of the peoples of the Pacific."
