# Nippon Tanks Smash Toward Vital Railway
## Chiang Kai-Shek Fears Defeatism Attitude On Part of Chinese 
### 
SHANGHAI, Friday, Nov. 5 (U.R).
—Japanese tanks, followed by waves
of steel - helmeted infantrymen,
smashed through Chinese positions
today to occupy points within two
and one - half miles of the vital
Shanghai-Hangchow railway on the
southwestern outskirts of Shanghai.
The Japanese also claimed sweep
ing successes in North China. They
appeared to be completing their
conquest of Shansi province after
slaughtering thousands of provin
cial troops and shattering regiments
of General Chu Teh's Eighth Route
Army—the former Chinese commu
nist army.
Resistance Wearing
Increasing fear in Nanking was
indicated that the general will of the
Chinese people for bitter-end resist
ance may 'be wavering. It was
learned, for example, that Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek has placed
Jiis own trusted leaders in positions
of power in all doubtful provinces.
They were instructed to take over
complete control on the slightest
sign of "defeatism" by provincial
leaders.
In Hsinking, capital of the Japan
dominated state of Manchukuo cre
ated from China's old northeastern
provinces after the Chinese-Japa
nese undeclared war of 1931-33, Ja
pan renounced her extraterritorial
privileges and placed her citizens re
siding in the new empire solely
under Manchukuoan law.
Japan Ignores Confab
Japanese generally ignored the
proceedings of the Nine - Power
Conference in Brussels where Brit
ain, the United States, and France
are leading an effort to find a basis
for mediation in the Far East war.
China, on the other hand, publi
cized the conference widely in an
effort to convince the people that
international assistance which will
enable China to win the war is im
pending.
