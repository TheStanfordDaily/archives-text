# Eight Power Entente Joins Against Fascists
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Nov. 4 (UP). —The United States joined forces today with
Britain and France in an evident move to mobilize world opinion against
the "fascist menace" as the Far Eastern Peace Conference struggled to
overcome Italo-German-Japanesc resistance.
The If) nations of the conference, which ran up against fascist defiance
at the outset, agreed to an attempt#

to bring Japan into peace negotia
tions and contemplated another ap
proach to Nazi Germany.
There was scant hope, however,
that either Japan or Germany would
consent to join the negotiations
based on the Nine-Power Washing
ton Treaty of 1922 which sought to
guarantee the tentorial and political
sovereignty of China.
It was indicated that the big de
mocracies—the United States, Brit
ain, and France—were temporarily
abandoning their efforts toward
bringing about an armistice in the
Orient for a more far-reaching ob
jective.
They apparently were determined
to give Germany, Italy, and Japan
"plenty of rope" and another oppor
tunity to come out in an effort to
wreck the conference. In this way,
it was believed, public opinion would
be crystallized, bringing the three
democracies closer together in a
front against the Japanese-German-
Italian entente.
