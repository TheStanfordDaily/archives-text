WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP). â€”
Organized labor's criticism of the
scheduled tour of the United States
by the Duke and Duchess of Wind
sor may result in cancellation of the
trip, Charles E. Bedaux, personal
representative of the famous
couple, disclosed tonight as he en
trained for New York.
The Baltimore Federation of La
bor last night adopted a resolution
assailing Bedaux and the royal
couple, referring specifically to the
Baltimore-born Duchess as "one
who while resident here in no way
showed the slightest concern or
sympathy for the problems of labor.
