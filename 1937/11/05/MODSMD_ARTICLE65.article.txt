AQUA CALIENTE, Baja Cal.,
Nov. 4 (UP). —Frank Fuller, wealthy
young San Francisco sportsman -
flyer, set a new Canada-to-Mexico
speed record tonight when he shot
his speedy Scversky racer across
the finish line here at 5:31.30 p.m.
P. S. T.
His time for the approximately
1200-mile flight was 4 hours, 54
or 34 minutes faster than
the old record held by Earl Ortman,
Lofc Angeles pilot.
The Duquesne professor who
stated that Pitt pays grid players
resigned last week—by request.
