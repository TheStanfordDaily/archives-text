SPORTS EDITOR SPECIAL
AMBLES SOUTHWARD
Despite hell and high water and a
slight cargo of beer, the Daily Sports
Editor Special (consisting of a brok
en-down Ford, overloaded with six
Stanfordites) will arrive in Los An
gt ies this morning.
Having nothing better to do,
I'll keep track of my expenses
snd upon arrival back on the
1 arm will present a neatly totaled
i tptnse account to the esteemed
H.!r. Swent. Scrawled across the
t< p of the page will be "Sports
Elitor's contribution to Stanford
j< urnalism."
This afternoon Nort Thornton's
w;.ter polo forces move into the
Bi uin bathtub for the first game of
the annual two-game series. The
Bruins were whipped by the L. A.
A C., 5-2, and by the Cal "Wonder
T< am of the Water," 7-4, but will
si 11 go into today's contest the de
ei led favorites to spill Nort's de
ft nding conference champions.
MAYBE CARD WATER
LOGS CAN TAKE BRUINS
The Bruins have practically the
s; me team that gave the Indian
water machine some trouble last
yi ar. The Farm team is consider
ably weaker, but the Card water
dogs may have pulled out of their
slump. I didn't see the Olympic
Club game in San Francisco last
but Stanford must have been
an improved team to overpower the
st.'ong Olympians, 10-8.
If we survive Friday night's
[. re-game celebration we'll amble
over t» the Trojan campus and
watch Nort's company go to work
< n Southern Cal's water polo sep
tet tomorrow morning. The Tro
jans, with a new coach and new
flayers, set back the Cards, 2-1,
(wo weeks ago here on the Farm,
(ill, YES, THERE'S
A FOOTBALL GAME
To complete a well-rounded sports
week-end, we have the little matter
of an Indian-Trojan football clash
in the Coliseum tomorrow after
noon. From all sources of informa
tion available we can't call the
g;ime anything but a toss-up. In a
Daily sports staff consensus, it was
found that three of us favored the
Cards, two favored the Trojans, and
one called it a deadlock.
The Stanford gridiron expedi
tion will bunk in the Huntington
Hotel in Pasadena and work out
on the Rose Bowl turf this after
noon. It will be Stanford's last
look at the Rose Bowl this season,
but the Indian jjriddcrs aren't
worrying much . . . they have a
24110-mile ocean trip to the land
of the hula dancers in store for
them during Christmas vacation.
1 ROY PAYS TRIBUTE
TO DEAD GRIDDER
A fitting tribute was paid to Roy
Yuretich at Troy this week, when
(he dead youth was made honorary
captain of the U.S.C. frosh football
team. Roy was one of the greatest
football players ever to graduate
from San Francisco prep circles. He
was a sure-fire first-string fullback
<.n the Trojan frosh eleven. In June,
several weeks after his first year at
U.S.C. had ended, he was stricken
with typhoid fever and died nine
days later.
GRANT STONE MAKES
U.P. ALL-COAST TEAM
Captain Grant Stone was on the
first all-coast team issued by United
Press from New York this week.
An all-star team of coast players
was picked by U. P., and these names
will be considered in the press as
sociations' final decision on an all -
American team for 1937.
Six members of Cal's bone
crushing eleven were mentioned
on the team, and the heralded Vic
Bottari was forgotten, while backs
fnuu Colorado and Gon/aga moved
in to take the spotlight.
Here's the U. P. team:
Ends—Grant Stone, Stanford, and
Perry Schwartz, Cal.
Tackles—Bill Stoll, Cal, and Vic
Markov, Washington.
Guards—Vard Stockton, Cal, and
Claude Evans, Cal.
Centers—Bob Herwig, Cal, and
Phil Dougherty, Santa Clara.
Backs—Byron White, Colorado;
George Karamatic, Gonzaga; Joe
Gray, Oregon State; and Johnny
Meek, Cal.
