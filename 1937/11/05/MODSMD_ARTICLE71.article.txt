# Daily Dopesters Favor Indians Over Troy, 7-6
## 
### 
With a seasonal batting average of
!619 for 42 coast grid games, the
Dippy's Peerless Pigskin Pickers go
into their weekly trance and pull six
game scores out of the hat to put
before the public.
Last week the Dippy seers were
headed for a 1.000 average when a
flock of goose eggs hit them in the
face. Those three scoreless ties last
week-end are all that will occur
this season, according to the sports
scriveners who never miss . . .
much.
Stanford Gets Call
After a heated argument and an
extra long two-bit trance, the Dippy
ones came out with a bona fide
score on the game down south. It's
Stanford by a nose, 7-6, over the
mighty Trojans of U.S.C.
Over Strawberry Canyon way the
California Undertaking Society goes
to work digging up the moth-eaten
Bear turf in preparation for the
next burial . . . that of the Wash
ington Husky. The score is called
20-7 for the Bears. It's a good bet
week after week.
Broncs Over San Jose
, In the other local battle two of
the coast's undefeated teams meet
in the second annual classic of the
prunes in the Spartan Stadium in
San Jose. The Broncos of Santa
Clara are the consensus favorites to
take the aSn Jose State Spartans by
a 14-7 count.
St. Mary's is doped to whip the
U.S.F. Dons, 13-7; the Washington
State Cougars are rated a 13-7
choice over Oregon; and Oregon
State is expected to wallop Wil
lamette, 20-0.

week-end are all that will occur
this season, according to the sports
scriveners who never miss . . .
much.
Stanford Gets Call
After a heated argument and an
extra long two-bit trance, the Dippy
ones came out with a bona fide
score on the game down south. It's
Stanford by a nose, 7-6, over the
mighty Trojans of U.S.C.
Over Strawberry Canyon way the
California Undertaking Society goes
to work digging up the moth-eaten
Bear turf in preparation for the
next burial . . . that of the Wash
ington Husky. The score is called
20-7 for the Bears. It's a good bet
week after week.
Broncs Over San Jose
, In the other local battle two of
the coast's undefeated teams meet
in the second annual classic of the
prunes in the Spartan Stadium in
San Jose. The Broncos of Santa
Clara are the consensus favorites to
take the aSn Jose State Spartans by
a 14-7 count.
St. Mary's is doped to whip the
U.S.F. Dons, 13-7; the Washington
State Cougars are rated a 13-7
choice over Oregon; and Oregon
State is expected to wallop Wil
lamette, 20-0.
Here's the way the staff call the

Indian-Trojan clash:
Gene Gear: S. 7, U.S.C. 0.
Harry Press: S. 7, U.S.C. 7.
Walt Peterson: S. 13, U.S.C. 7.
Doug Jaques: S. 7, U.S.C. 13.
Arch Jenkins: S. 7, U.S.C. 13.
Jerry Hawley: S. 13, U.S.C. 12
With a seasonal batting average of
!619 for 42 coast grid games, the
Dippy's Peerless Pigskin Pickers go
into their weekly trance and pull six
game scores out of the hat to put
before the public.
Last week the Dippy seers were
headed for a 1.000 average when a
flock of goose eggs hit them in the
face. Those three scoreless ties last
week-end are all that will occur
this season, according to the sports
scriveners who never miss . . .
