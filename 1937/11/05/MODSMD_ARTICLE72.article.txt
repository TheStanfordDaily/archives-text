NEW YORK, Nov. 4 (U.R).—Jack
McAuliffe, 72, who never was de
feated after he became lightweight
champion of the world in the days
of bare-knuckle bouts, died today.
He had been ill nearly three years
of a throat ailment, and was in a
coma for the last 48 hours of his life.
McAuliffe retired from the ring in
1892, but four years later he came
back to fight a six-round, no-deci
sion bout with Kid Lavigne. Then
he left !he ring for good and behind
him was a record unblemished by
defeat—lo knockouts. 32 decision
victories, nine draws, three no-de
cision bouts, ancl one exhibition.
Critics said he was one of the
greatest fighters of his weight who
ever lived, and boxing in those days
was not the sort of business that
poured gold into a man's pockets and
made him a national hero.
Tobacco was discovered in San
Domingo in 1496, afterwards by the
Spaniards in Yucatan in 1520.
