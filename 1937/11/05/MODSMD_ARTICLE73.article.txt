# Stiff Workout Begins Indian Hoop Practice
## Bunn To Juggle Players In Test Combinations For Well-oiled Team 
### 
Starting with last night's scrim
mage, a good, stiff one, Coach John
Bunn's basketball squad is buck
ling down to the dead-in-earnest
work that will characterize practice
for the rest of what should be an
epochal season.
Conditioning scrimmages, in which
Bunn will work out various com
binations of players, will appear in
nearly every workout. And those
workouts will start coming daily,
instead of three limes weekly as has
been the case so far, beginning No
vember 15. That gives the hoopsten;
one week more of spaced practices.
Bunn To Place Players
The squad juggling figured on by
Bunn will test the workability of as
many combinations as time will al
low, or until the coach of the Pacific
Coast champions finds where his
lads fit in best.
The exact status of Hank Luisetti,
still barred from the court after his
appendectomy, is still a little vague.
He has been promised that it won't
be too long before he can get back
on the maple to sharpen up his free
throwing, but whether he will be
able to get into any of the Decem
ber practice games before the east
ern tour is still a moot question.
Luisetti Phenomenon
Given a couple of weeks of noth
ing but practice on foul shooting,
Luisetti should develop into some
thing of a phenomenon, if he isn't
already. Last season he had an av
erage of about 85 per cent .suc
cessful throws per game.
Another angle on the foul-throw
ing finds Bunn having his men try
ing to reach and maintain an aver
age of 90 per cent success in their
tosses —previously he has asked for
about 75 per cent and found the
players reaching that and not trying
for anything better. Beebs Lee took
the iron medal last night with 45
scored out of 48 tries.
Varsity To Demonstrate
Scheduled for Saturday, Decem
ber 4, in the Pavilion, is a demon
stration by the varsity, open to the
public but largely planned for high
school coaches and players in this
region. Bunn will lead his team
through their drills for the edifica
tion of basketball fans, and then the
squad will engage the giant fresh
man five in a scrimmage.

tion of basketball fans, and then the
squad will engage the giant fresh
man five in a scrimmage.
Starting with last night's scrim
mage, a good, stiff one, Coach John
Bunn's basketball squad is buck
ling down to the dead-in-earnest
work that will characterize practice
for the rest of what should be an
epochal season.
Conditioning scrimmages, in which
Bunn will work out various com
binations of players, will appear in
nearly every workout. And those
workouts will start coming daily,
instead of three limes weekly as has
been the case so far, beginning No
vember 15. That gives the hoopsten;
one week more of spaced practices.
Bunn To Place Players
The squad juggling figured on by
Bunn will test the workability of as
many combinations as time will al
low, or until the coach of the Pacific
Coast champions finds where his
lads fit in best.
The exact status of Hank Luisetti,
still barred from the court after his
appendectomy, is still a little vague.
He has been promised that it won't
be too long before he can get back
on the maple to sharpen up his free
throwing, but whether he will be
able to get into any of the Decem
ber practice games before the east
ern tour is still a moot question.
Luisetti Phenomenon
Given a couple of weeks of noth
ing but practice on foul shooting,
Luisetti should develop into some
thing of a phenomenon, if he isn't
already. Last season he had an av
erage of about 85 per cent .suc
cessful throws per game.
Another angle on the foul-throw
ing finds Bunn having his men try
ing to reach and maintain an aver
age of 90 per cent success in their
tosses —previously he has asked for
about 75 per cent and found the
players reaching that and not trying
for anything better. Beebs Lee took
the iron medal last night with 45
scored out of 48 tries.
Varsity To Demonstrate
Scheduled for Saturday, Decem
ber 4, in the Pavilion, is a demon
stration by the varsity, open to the
public but largely planned for high
school coaches and players in this
region. Bunn will lead his team
through their drills for the edifica
tion of basketball fans, and then the
squad will engage the giant fresh
man five in a scrimmage.
