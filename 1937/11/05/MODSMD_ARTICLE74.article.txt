## 
### 
The Stanford water polo team will
attempt to annex it.s first conference
j win this afternoon when they play
the U.C.L.A. Bruins in Lo.s An-
I geles.
Coach Nort Thornton tucked ten
i players and two managers into their
J berths on the southbound S.P. last
night and expressed hopes of a
' double victory over the week-end.
Bill Burns finally won the start

ing goalie guard over Lloyd Wilson.
Both played a half against the Olym
pic Club and probably will share the
job in the southern tilts.
Thornton is pinning his hopes for
victory on the success of his new
found offensive. With Jack Vibert
back at guard and Dick Hoover
again playing like a veteran, his de -
fensive problem should be well
taken care of. Hoover and Vibert

I both lost a lot of practice due to
injuries and illness but apparently
have returned to their early season
form.
Captain Bill Hanna seems to be
permanently situated in his new de
fensive job at center-back. As a
] forward last year, Hanna was an All-
Coast choice and his loss there has
i undoubtedly cut down the Card
I scoring. But Hanna runs the team

well from the center-back spot and
usually starts the scoring plays in
addition to being more active on
defense.
If Johnny Lamb and Harvey Roth
schild at forward do as well in Lo.s
Angeles as they did in the Olympic:
Club spree, they will have entitled
themselves to something or other.
Between them they made nine goaL
in that game.
