# Frosh Gridders Play Cal In Stadium Tomorrow
## Papooses In Final Contest Against Cubs Little Big Game To Be Acid Test for Team As Bears Come Here 
### 
Stanford's frosh football team will
trot out on the Stadium Field to
morrow ut 2:30 to face their acid
test.
Cal's Cub coach, Clint Evans, will
be bringing his boys over from across
the Bay to meet the Papooses in the
Little Big Game.
Ending Season
Winding up their 1937 season to
morrow, the frosh will go out against
Cal, tommyhawks unsheathed, hop
ing to wipe out last year's Little Big
Game defeat against the class of '40.
And they may do just that in spite
of the fact that Cal has its usual
strong frosh squad, having lost only
une game this season —a close 7-2
defeat at the hands of U.S.C.'s
strong, league-leading eleven.
The Papooses, who got off to a poor
start this year against Santa Ana
J.C., have been improving steadily
all season and should reach their top
form against the Cubs.
Backfield in Shape
Their whole backfield — Captain
Norm Standlee, Thor Peterson,
Quentin Thompson, and Stan Graff—
are all in top shape, ready to turn
in first-rate performances, as are
Glen "Cookie" South and Bob Olden,
reserve halves.
Last night they worked on their
kicking offense with Standlee and
Peterson kicking, the ends and
tackles running down under them,
and the halves catching and return
ing the punts. Then they worked out
a bit on their offense, both on the
ground and in the air.
Then the reserves, with one blue
and gold jersey to add realism to
their efforts, ran Cal plays against
the first and second strings.
Last Practice
Tonight, in their last practice of
the year, they will again work on
their running and passing plays.
Coach Harry Shipkey is putting
them through a special place-kick
formation drill, and is holding a
chalk-talk from 2 to 3 o'clock.
For the first time this year, there
v.'ill be .an admission charged to
watch the frosh play. The tax will
be 25 cents with a student body card
and 55 cents without one.
Left end Jim Farquharson is ex
pecting a heavy workout tomor
row. Cal specializes on runs around
right end, and it will be up to Jim
to stop the Cubs' Jerry Lutz and
company most of the afternoon. And
according to Shipkey he ought to
be able to do it. He played a much
improved game against San Mateo
and should reach his peak against
Cal.
Cal Player Hurt
In practice this week, three Cal
players have been bunged up and
may not play Saturday. They are
left tackle John Zentner, right end
Morely Mathewson, and center Milt
Whitebrook. Whitebrook has been
playing for first-strirtg center Dave
Queen since Queen was injured ear
ly in the season, so third-stringer
AI Long will quite likely play most
of the game.
It is a matter of speculation how
much harm the loss of these three
men will be to the team, because the
Cub stars Jerry Lutz, Bill Elmore,
and Grant Brians will still be in
carrying the ball tomorrow.
Only substitution for Stanford will
be Jack Warneke for Chick Orme,
guard. And in case injuries sus
tained in the San Mateo game bother
end AI Meiners and right
tackle Bill Braheny, Stan Charlston
and Joe Grant will be ready to go
in for Meiners, with Dean Burford
and Claude Purkett ready to replace
Braheny.

Cal Player Hurt
In practice this week, three Cal
players have been bunged up and
may not play Saturday. They are
left tackle John Zentner, right end
Morely Mathewson, and center Milt

playing for first-strirtg center Dave

It is a matter of speculation how
much harm the loss of these three

Cub stars Jerry Lutz, Bill Elmore,
and Grant Brians will still be in

Only substitution for Stanford will

HOUSTON, Tex., Nov. 4 (UP).—
About 4000 men returned to work
today after settlement of a three
day strike of stevedores on coast
wise vessels at all Texas ports and
at Lake Charles, La.
Stanford's frosh football team will
trot out on the Stadium Field to
morrow ut 2:30 to face their acid
test.
Cal's Cub coach, Clint Evans, will
be bringing his boys over from across
the Bay to meet the Papooses in the
Little Big Game.
Ending Season
Winding up their 1937 season to
morrow, the frosh will go out against
Cal, tommyhawks unsheathed, hop
ing to wipe out last year's Little Big
Game defeat against the class of '40.
And they may do just that in spite
of the fact that Cal has its usual
strong frosh squad, having lost only
une game this season —a close 7-2
defeat at the hands of U.S.C.'s
strong, league-leading eleven.
The Papooses, who got off to a poor
start this year against Santa Ana
J.C., have been improving steadily
all season and should reach their top
form against the Cubs.
Backfield in Shape
Their whole backfield — Captain
Norm Standlee, Thor Peterson,
Quentin Thompson, and Stan Graff—
are all in top shape, ready to turn
in first-rate performances, as are
Glen "Cookie" South and Bob Olden,
reserve halves.
Last night they worked on their
kicking offense with Standlee and
Peterson kicking, the ends and
tackles running down under them,
and the halves catching and return
ing the punts. Then they worked out
a bit on their offense, both on the
ground and in the air.
Then the reserves, with one blue
and gold jersey to add realism to
their efforts, ran Cal plays against
the first and second strings.
Last Practice
Tonight, in their last practice of
the year, they will again work on
their running and passing plays.
Coach Harry Shipkey is putting
them through a special place-kick
formation drill, and is holding a
chalk-talk from 2 to 3 o'clock.
For the first time this year, there
v.'ill be .an admission charged to
watch the frosh play. The tax will
be 25 cents with a student body card
and 55 cents without one.
Left end Jim Farquharson is ex
pecting a heavy workout tomor
row. Cal specializes on runs around
right end, and it will be up to Jim
to stop the Cubs' Jerry Lutz and
company most of the afternoon. And
according to Shipkey he ought to
be able to do it. He played a much
improved game against San Mateo
and should reach his peak against
Cal.
Cal Player Hurt
In practice this week, three Cal
players have been bunged up and
may not play Saturday. They are
left tackle John Zentner, right end
Morely Mathewson, and center Milt
Whitebrook. Whitebrook has been
playing for first-strirtg center Dave
Queen since Queen was injured ear
ly in the season, so third-stringer
AI Long will quite likely play most
of the game.
It is a matter of speculation how
much harm the loss of these three
men will be to the team, because the
Cub stars Jerry Lutz, Bill Elmore,
and Grant Brians will still be in
carrying the ball tomorrow.
Only substitution for Stanford will
be Jack Warneke for Chick Orme,
guard. And in case injuries sus
tained in the San Mateo game bother
end AI Meiners and right
tackle Bill Braheny, Stan Charlston
and Joe Grant will be ready to go
in for Meiners, with Dean Burford
and Claude Purkett ready to replace
Braheny.
