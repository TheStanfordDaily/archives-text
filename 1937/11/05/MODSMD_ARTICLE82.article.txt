# Golden Bears On Home Stretch To Rose Bowl
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
The time has come, as it docs every year when the home stretch is
hit, for all grid fans good and true to turn their thoughts toward the super
climax of every football season—that date wilh Rosie Bowl.
'Ihe Western half of the date seems to have a private phone direct
lo Rosie's boudoir—and the line is busy most of the time. The talkative

jerson is, of course, Mr. Stub Alli-<
on, aided by his 11 trained Bears
mustn't forget your 20 points to
lay, boys).
The Berkeley bouncers have so
ar outclassed all other western
earns that there isn't much doubt at
his date as to their whereabouts
>n January 1. The Cal team has
nassed a total of 162 points to their
ipponenl.s' mere 33. And they've
lever had to work very hard,
either.
Alabama Ahead
From the other side of the fence,
as a safe candidate on which to
place a good-sized bet, appears Ala
oama, the South's only undefeated
candidate for national honors.
The Crimson Tide's crushing de
feat of Kentucky, 41-0, left no doubt
it is concentrating on getting an
other Rose Bowl bid. Its power is
amply shown by its 200-point total
as compared to opponents' measly 7.
Duke in the Southern Confer
ence, Baylor in the Southwest,, and
Colorado in the Rockies likewise re
main very definitely identified as
sectional pace-setters.
One of the South's biggest sur
prises came with Georgia Tech's
amazing 14-0 win over the Vander
bilt Commodores, previously un
beaten and untied. Coupled to this
upset was Notre Dame's tremen
dous achievement in toppling mighty
Minnesota by that fateful one-point
margin, 7-6.
Yale in Tic
These two defeats were the only
ones to affect members of last
week's nationally ranked "first 10,"
but two others, Yale and Dartmouth,
battled to a thrilling 9-9 tie before
the day's biggest crowd, and the
ranks of previously unbeaten major
teams virtually were halved.

The races for honors in the East
and Middle West are in a very mud
dled position, and last week's re
turns didn't help much to ciarify
them.
The two leading teams in the East
seem to be Pitt and Fordham,
whose otherwise unblemished rec-t
ords are marred only by their own
scoreless tie.
Big Games
Big games this week all over the
nation include the Army - Harvard,
Cornell - Dartmouth, and Notre
Dame - Pitt tussles, with the latter a
cinch to draw the mobs.
On the Coast, the last chance to
let fly at the Bears is the exclusive
property of the Washington Huskies,
who might do some damage, maybe.
Big game, though, is an independ
ent classic with Santa Clara and San
Jose as the participants. Oregon
State takes a deep breather with
Willamette, Washington State holds
for a toss-up with Oregon, and St.
Mary's takes on U.S.F.

sea and dumped as a waste product
of kerosene.
