SAFETY propaganda is like other forms of
advertising; it may be read and absorbed but
it won't always get results. Recent researches
into consumer attitudes by a major oil company
have proven that its advertising ranked tops in
a consumer survey, but its gasoline and oil sales
failed to scamper up the curve.
Consumers thought the ad was nice, read, it
and agreed its arguments were good, but went
on buying the old brand. They didn't deny that
the new product might be better. But they were
getting along all right. The advertising mes
sage was shunted off as an advertising message.
It was meant for the next man.
During the past week, as in most weeks prior
to popular away - from - home football games,
Stanford has taken its dose of safety propa
ganda, little gems of love and devotion slanted
for the prospective S.C. traveler lest he reduce
the Ad Building's registration figures. But even
the man who wrote the advertising will prob
ably disregard his own caution when he gets
on the road. It was meant for the other fellow.
It was advertising that was nice, and the right
thing, but it didn't sell safety. It didn't pierce
the shell.

As in the administration of peace propaganda,
the preacher of road-caution turns safety-satirist.
In his search for a means of approach, for a
spear to crack the shell, he will ask you how it
would feel to lie on a morgue slab. Or per
haps he will say that there are too many safe
drivers around Stanford anyway, and it would
be fine if a few would kill themselves off. Reg
istiation is getting too high.
If he is an engineer he will probably dig up
the number of deaths and injuries last year and
prophesy how many won't be around Monday.
And then there's the traditional old one of issu
ing a challenge—a challenge to escape death.
But they all have the same idea, and their idea
may be read and absorbed but everyone will
still drive off happily resolved that it won't
happen to him, including the man who wrote it.
That's the inside story, not a very secret one
to the advertiser or sociologist. But to the intel
ligent reader it might mean more than witticism,
sarcasm, or satire to put over the simple impor
tant message—"drive carefully."
This is not a warning for the other man; if
you're heading south, it's for you.
Let it get inside.
