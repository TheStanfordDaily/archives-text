TO freshmen who have been wondering audi
bly why The Daily doesn't make up its mind,
and have been criticizing what they thought
was inconsistency between an editorial that
asked them to behave themselves and a news
story that called the Pajamarino tame, let this
be said:
The Daily congratulates them on their good
behavior, here, not in a news story, because it
tries to keep policy out of the news columns.
The reporter who wrote the story wrote straight
nev/s, played up tameness, because contrast
between this year's Pajamarino and that of last
year seemed the biggest feature of the event,
and the headline writer agreed. Certainly the
attendance, which was meager, was not news.
The Daily still prefers gentlemen frosh to
rowdies, tame Pajamarinos to wild ones, and
joins the A.S.S.U. in thanking '41 for an S.C.
rally, sans tomatoes, sans destruction.—L. L.
