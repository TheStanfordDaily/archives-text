Tuesday's election puts Fiorello LaGuardia into
the front line of speculation as possible Repub
lican nominee for President in 1940."
This is the opinion of Chester Rowell, San
Francisco's prime Republican editor, and if a
few difficulties could be hurdled it would be
a fine idea.
What the party needs is life, and LaGuardia
would be the life of any party. After the color
less Landon, a showman who photographs as
well in the cab of a steam shovel as behind a

desk would be an ideal choice. The party
might even get Billy Rose, promoter of the
Cleveland and Dallas expositions, to replace
John D. M. Hamilton.
But even if they disregarded the turnings in
the grave of the Coolidges, Mellons, and Millses,
party strategists would have to face the fact
that LaGuardia isn't a very good Republican. In
the New York election Labor, Socialists, and
Communists supported him. The strategists
would have to try to make the Germans of the
North Central states and of the large cities
forget about Fiorello's Hitler-baiting activities.
They would have to make the farmers believe
that a New York Republican is not necessarily
owned by Big Business.
Of course the South is lost anyway, so why
worry whether a man of Italian and Jewish ex
traction, even though he is Episcopalian, could
poll votes there.
Fiorello would pep up the party, but if Mr.
Rowell closed his eyes and took a random stab
at a telephone book he would find a more prob
able Republican nominee than LaGuardia. —L. L.
