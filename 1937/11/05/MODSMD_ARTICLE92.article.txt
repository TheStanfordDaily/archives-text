# BULL SESSION
## THIS REALLY DOESN'T MATTER MUCH 
### 
IN these days when advice columns yield only to
vice stories in popularity, college papers seem
strangely bare of offers to settle your worries for a
stamp. Undergraduates count this as one of their
major blessings, and point to it whenever critics de
clare a Roman holiday with college journalism as the
featured attraction. But recently a number of students
have suggested that it would be a noble and Christian
act if someone would mention a few ways which
professors can use to keep the love of their students.
And so without attempting to pirate the Dorothy
Dix trade I shall repeat some of the things which are
to student-faculty relations what "little tenderness"
is to married life.
* * * *
If undergraduates were to make up a list of the
features of college life they detest, probably the pop
quiz would lead, written in capital letters. Term
papers have their value, and finals seem unavoidable.
For the pop quiz there is no excuse.
According to our philosophy of education the requi
site for passing a course is learning the material by
the end of the quarter. But with the prospect, of an
unannounced quiz sneering at him, the student must
have every fact reduced to cowering subjection at all
times. And for safety he must attend every meeting
of the class. It doesn't take an efficiency expert to
figur out how this torpedoes the usual systems
of study.
* * * *
stunt that makes students as furious as
a young bride who finds ashes on the sofa is the
system of revising textbooks. We will concede that
knowledge marches irresistibly onward toward eternal
Truth. But it is hard to see how it can march so fast
that texts have to be changed every second year.
Cynics say that the only purpose is to boom the sales.
Whatever the purpose, it does not improve the disposi
tion to le;if through your tenth edition of "Arthropods
in the Mating Season" and discover that except for
page numbers it is identical with the other nine
issues.
Also, students find it very wearing on the self
control when professors tell them to expect one kind
of an ex and then give another. Dr. Furbrain, for
instance, will tell a class with chummy camaraderie
that the test will be discussion. It is hardly surprising
that the students sing no hosannas for Dr. Furbrain
when the ex turns out to be spot, or objective.

And so if a professor finds his class drifting away
from him, he need not change his toothbrush or his
gargle. And it might save him an expensive invest
ment in soap if first he "tried a little tenderness."

And so if a professor finds his class drifting away
from him, he need not change his toothbrush or his
gargle. And it might save him an expensive invest
ment in soap if first he "tried a little tenderness."

IN these days when advice columns yield only to
vice stories in popularity, college papers seem
strangely bare of offers to settle your worries for a
stamp. Undergraduates count this as one of their
major blessings, and point to it whenever critics de
clare a Roman holiday with college journalism as the
featured attraction. But recently a number of students
have suggested that it would be a noble and Christian
act if someone would mention a few ways which
professors can use to keep the love of their students.
And so without attempting to pirate the Dorothy
Dix trade I shall repeat some of the things which are
to student-faculty relations what "little tenderness"
is to married life.

If undergraduates were to make up a list of the
features of college life they detest, probably the pop
quiz would lead, written in capital letters. Term
papers have their value, and finals seem unavoidable.
For the pop quiz there is no excuse.
According to our philosophy of education the requi
site for passing a course is learning the material by
the end of the quarter. But with the prospect, of an
unannounced quiz sneering at him, the student must
have every fact reduced to cowering subjection at all
times. And for safety he must attend every meeting
of the class. It doesn't take an efficiency expert to
figur out how this torpedoes the usual systems
of study.
* * * *
stunt that makes students as furious as
a young bride who finds ashes on the sofa is the
system of revising textbooks. We will concede that
knowledge marches irresistibly onward toward eternal
Truth. But it is hard to see how it can march so fast
that texts have to be changed every second year.
Cynics say that the only purpose is to boom the sales.
Whatever the purpose, it does not improve the disposi
tion to le;if through your tenth edition of "Arthropods
in the Mating Season" and discover that except for
page numbers it is identical with the other nine
issues.
Also, students find it very wearing on the self
control when professors tell them to expect one kind
of an ex and then give another. Dr. Furbrain, for
instance, will tell a class with chummy camaraderie
that the test will be discussion. It is hardly surprising
that the students sing no hosannas for Dr. Furbrain
when the ex turns out to be spot, or objective.
