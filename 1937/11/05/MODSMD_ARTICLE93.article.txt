As long as anyone can remember Encinamatcs
have had to pay a substantial breakage deposit
before taking up residence in that haven. But
recently the Columbia Student Board busied it
self with a similar measure—and a Columbia Spec
tator editorial writer blasted it thusly:

IT'S a long while sincc any Student Board passed a
measure as absurd as the one passed at the last
meeting of the present board.
According to the plan advocated by five of the seven
board members, now pending before the dean, stu
dents in the dorms will be required to make a dam
age deposit before taking up residence on the campus.
The amount of money needed to cover riot damages
will be taken from the fund Ihus created, such amount
to be estimated by a student committee of five imme
diately after any riot. B'inally, all money remaining
in the fund at the end of the year will be returned to
the residents.
It's beside the issue to point out the patent impossi
bility of working out such a plan from a financial
standpoint; reluming funds at (he end of the year
would be a wasteful and inefficient process. It's un
necessary to call attention to the difficulty students
would meet in estimating property damage in a riot,
regardless of how accurately they could cover it. •
What is more important is the fact that five mem
bers of student board can imagine that the move pro
vides either deterrent or solution. Fortunately ap
proval of the dean must bo secured before this half
baked suggestion can go into effect. Fortunately, be
cause we're sure the dean has sense enough to perceive
the shortcomings of the plan.
Suppose that a riot occurs after the plan is in
effect and every resident has paid in advance for the
damages, regardless of who commits them. On that
basis, why shouldn't every fellow get his money's
worth of riot and hell-raising?
All-in-all, the plan offers nothing whatsoever in
the direction of stopping riots at Columbia. The pro
posal is so short-sighted that it actually promises to
accomplish the opposite of its purpose. And that's
just what it will do unless the dean throws the sug
gestion out the window.

It's beside the issue to point out the patent impossi
bility of working out such a plan from a financial
standpoint; reluming funds at (he end of the year
would be a wasteful and inefficient process. It's un
necessary to call attention to the difficulty students
would meet in estimating property damage in a riot,
regardless of how accurately they could cover it. •
What is more important is the fact that five mem
bers of student board can imagine that the move pro
vides either deterrent or solution. Fortunately ap
proval of the dean must bo secured before this half
baked suggestion can go into effect. Fortunately, be
cause we're sure the dean has sense enough to perceive
the shortcomings of the plan.
Suppose that a riot occurs after the plan is in
effect and every resident has paid in advance for the
damages, regardless of who commits them. On that
basis, why shouldn't every fellow get his money's
worth of riot and hell-raising?
All-in-all, the plan offers nothing whatsoever in
the direction of stopping riots at Columbia. The pro
posal is so short-sighted that it actually promises to
accomplish the opposite of its purpose. And that's
just what it will do unless the dean throws the sug
gestion out the window.
