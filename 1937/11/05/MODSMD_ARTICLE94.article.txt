# Molnar Play Falls Flat In Film Version
## 
### 
"The Bride Wore ;icd ' (currently
at the Fox-Stanford) shows the
Hollywood walrus at play in the
Continental lily pond. By this 1 do
not mean Joan Crawford alone. No
indeed. But the whole awkward
flapping of American fins in the
pretty shallows of Ferenc Molnar's
little European fancy.

Now even a
singer in a dive
in Trieste, like
Anni (Joan Craw
ford) loe she a
Molnar heroine,
has an elfin qual
ity. Joan Craw
ford is not ex
actly notable for
her elfin qualities.
Miss Crawford, in
fact, has afflicted
Anni with high
seriousness and
even intelligence

—both of which Molnar would
deplore in a heroine.
Moreover, if Franchot Tone, as the
little postman Pietro, occasionally
touched them hem of subtle lines, he
more often tripped on the whole
skirt.
In fact, the sly sweetness of the
play was as wasted on the actors
as an Esquire cartoon on the first
wise monkey.
