# High Court May Reopen Black Issue
## New Objection Demands F.R. Order Removal Of 'Problem Justice' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 (U.R).—Al
bert Levitt, former special assistant
attorney general, tonight accused
President Roosevelt of being directly
responsible for the "illegal presence"
of Justice Hugo L. Black on the Su
preme Court. He demanded that the
president order Attorney General
Homer S. Cummings to seek Black's
removal.
"It would be gracious and praise
worthy for you to exercise the power
which it is your duty to use under
the constitution and direct the attor
ney general to start legal proceed
ings to remove Mr. Black from the
position which he now assumes to
hold," Levitt wrote.
Recess Ends
Levitt's letter was made public as
the court prepared to reconvene
tomorrow after a two weeks' recess
with the possibility that it may rule
for the third and perhaps the last
time on Black's eligibility to sit on
the nation's highest tribunal.
Two previous challenges to Black's
eligibility were rejected by the
court. They were brought by Levitt
and by Patrick Henry Kelly, Boston,
Mass., attorney.
In his letter to the president to
night Levitt stressed the contention
that he and Kelly made before the
court —that:
Two Charges
(1) No vacancy existed when
Black was named to the bench be
cause his predecessor, Willis Vande
vanter, merely retired, and
(2) That Black became constitu
tionally ineligible to serve on the
bench when, as a U.S. Senator, he
increased the emoluments of the
office by voting retirement pay to
Justices past the age of 65.
An attack on Black's fitness and
eligibility came last week from a
group of Florida brokers in a plea
for a rehearing of the court's recent
adverse decision on a case in which
they questioned the constitutionality
of the Securites and Exchange Act.
