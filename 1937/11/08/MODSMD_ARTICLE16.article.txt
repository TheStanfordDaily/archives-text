# Journalists, Medicos Discuss Scientific News
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Calmly talking things over under
| the white flag of truce, "sensational"
i newsmen and "close-mouthed'' med
! ical men aimed Friday night at ac
j curate newspaper reporting of sci-
I entific news.
Several leading San Francisco
! doctors and journalists spiked their
j tradition of common hatred, when
I they spoke in a symposium on sci-
I ence reporting at the semi-annual
! joint meeting of the Stanford chap
| ter of Sigma Delta Chi, men's pro
i fessional journalistic fraternity, and
: the Northern California alumni
j chapter of the organization.
I Attended by 55 persons—many
I of them leading journalists of North-
I ern California—the dinner meeting
was held at Hotel Mark Hopkins.
Moral Duty Stressed
Heading the .doctors' side of the
I discussion was Dr. Karl F. Meyer,

director of the Hooper Institute for
Medical Research, and one of the
foremost authorities on botulism
(food poisoning).
Dr. Meyer stressed the moral
duty of the press to warn without
terrorizing. "News just isn't reach
ing the morons who cook their string
beans in washtubs."
Dr. Maurice Tainter, pharmacolo
gist at Stanford Medical School, pic
tured persons arriving in a town by
airplane, flivver, and horseback after
a newspaper story had announced a
cancer cure.
"An incomplete medical story is a
crime," declared Dean Langle.y' Por
ter of the University of California
Medical School, first Stanford foot
ball coach.
Stressing the necessity of telling
medical news in simple terms, John
C. Lee, medical reporter for the Ex
aminer, told the group, "The story
of creation is in simple words, and

it is a bigger job than anything
medicine did."
"It was inaccurate, though," com
mented Dean Porter.
"Let us humanize the profession,"
suggested Robert Elliott, science ed
itor of the San Francisco News,
questioning medical societies' objec
tions to use of individual doctors'!
names in news stories.
"Treat science tenderly," pleaded
Chauncey Leake, pharmacologist at
the University of California Medi
cal School.
Fusion speaker for the two sides
appeai'ed to be Dr. Jacob Geiger,
director of the San Francisco De
partment of Public Health. He said
that the medical profession will pro
gress farther when it learns that the
newspapers can be a great help and
how to explain scientific develop
ments in simple terms.
Other speakers included Alumni
Chapter President George Pet tit,

secretary to the president of the
University of California; Harold El
lis, public relations director for the
University of California; and Phil
lip Sinnott, Pacific Coast manager of
NEA Feature Service and Acme
Pictures. Sinnott was master of
ceremonies.
Presiding at the meeting was Dave
Botsford, president of the Stanford
chapter.
In a ceremony before the dinner,
the following pledges were initiated
into Sigma Delta Chi:
Richard Chase, city editor, San
Francisco News; Leo Levy, publish
er, Oakland Tribune; John C. Lee,
San Francisco Examiner reporter
who wrote a recent series on the
Stanford Medical School; Edward
Morgan, foreign editor of United
Press Pacific Division; John Thomp
