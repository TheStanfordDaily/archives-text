# Rooters Go Wild As Red Machine Rolls Over Troy
## Indians Turn on Heat in Second Half; Fay, Luckett Score Win 
### GENE GEAR 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. (i (Special to The Daily).—Elevated
from the depths of despair to the heights of enthusiasm, Stanford rooters
went wild during the second half here this afternoon while the Big Red
Machine got Monkey Wrench Schindlcr out of its engine and rambled
through Troy, 7-6.
In the lirsl half, Amhy Schindlcr & Co. ran through the Stanford line
for huge gains. The Troians ripped through for no less than nine first

'downs, while the Indians had to be
content with but two. Bill Paul
man's beautiful punts were all that
held the Trojans from running up a
large score in that first half.
With the start of the second half,
Tiny's boys really went to work.
They were making yardage where
there was no yardage before. They
were stopping Schindler cold, and
Trojan Backs Wayne Hoffman and
Bill Sangster were in the same boat.
The Indians piled up eight first
downs, while the Trojans were
squeezing out one oh a 30-yard
pass gain.
Troy Blocks Kick
The Trojans were held away from
the Cardinal goal line until the sec
ond quarter, when Pete Fay's kick
was blocked by Howard Stoeker,
Troys' left end. The ball rolled out
of bounds on the Stanford one-yard
line, where the Trojans took pos
session of the ball. Schindler made
it a touchdown in one crack.
The entire outcome of the game
depended on the conversion, al
though the fans didn't attach much
importance to the placement kick
that failed for Troy. The southern
ers were going to town at that point
and everybody was waiting for a
few more Crimson and Gold scores.
That all-important place-kick from
the toe of Ralph Stanley was block
ed by Tony Calvelli, Indian center,
who came crashing through to take
the ball on his chest.
Score in Third
Stanford's score came in the third
quarter, when the Indians took pos
session of the ball on the Card 45.
Fred Ledeboer hit right tackle for
four yards. Then Jim Groves faded
back and tossed a pass to Pete Fay,
who caught it on the Trojan 40-yard
line. Blond Pete, aided by nice
blocking, and using his side-step
ping to great advantage, went those
40 precious yards for a score.
Little Doc Luckett, Card reserve
quarter, came racing into the fray
for that important conversion. Luck
ett's kick must have traveled 40
yards and split the uprights in tho
dead center. Little Doc came run
ning off the field with a broad grin.
His work had been done for the day
—and how it had been done.
Walton Blocks Holes
Big Jack Walton went into the
game in the second half at right
guard and blocked up those holes
with such finesse that Trojan backs
were being dumped at the line of
scrimmage.
In the All-Cardinal second half,
Pete Fay and Jake Brigham sparked
every Stanford drive. Brigham's
off-tackle thrusts and Fay's end
runs and cut-ins spelled ruin for
the Trojans.

was blocked by Howard Stoeker,
Troys' left end. The ball rolled out
of bounds on the Stanford one-yard
line, where the Trojans took pos
session of the ball. Schindler made
it a touchdown in one crack.
The entire outcome of the game
depended on the conversion, al
though the fans didn't attach much
importance to the placement kick
that failed for Troy. The southern
ers were going to town at that point
and everybody was waiting for a
few more Crimson and Gold scores.
That all-important place-kick from
the toe of Ralph Stanley was block
ed by Tony Calvelli, Indian center,
who came crashing through to take
the ball on his chest.
Score in Third
Stanford's score came in the third
quarter, when the Indians took pos
session of the ball on the Card 45.
Fred Ledeboer hit right tackle for
four yards. Then Jim Groves faded
back and tossed a pass to Pete Fay,
who caught it on the Trojan 40-yard
line. Blond Pete, aided by nice
blocking, and using his side-step
ping to great advantage, went those
40 precious yards for a score.
Little Doc Luckett, Card reserve
quarter, came racing into the fray
for that important conversion. Luck
ett's kick must have traveled 40
yards and split the uprights in tho
dead center. Little Doc came run
ning off the field with a broad grin.
His work had been done for the day
—and how it had been done.
Walton Blocks Holes
Big Jack Walton went into the
game in the second half at right
guard and blocked up those holes
with such finesse that Trojan backs
were being dumped at the line of
scrimmage.
In the All-Cardinal second half,
Pete Fay and Jake Brigham sparked
every Stanford drive. Brigham's
off-tackle thrusts and Fay's end
runs and cut-ins spelled ruin for
the Trojans.
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Nov. (i (Special to The Daily).—Elevated
from the depths of despair to the heights of enthusiasm, Stanford rooters
went wild during the second half here this afternoon while the Big Red
Machine got Monkey Wrench Schindlcr out of its engine and rambled
through Troy, 7-6.
In the lirsl half, Amhy Schindlcr & Co. ran through the Stanford line
for huge gains. The Troians ripped through for no less than nine first

'downs, while the Indians had to be
content with but two. Bill Paul
man's beautiful punts were all that
held the Trojans from running up a
large score in that first half.
With the start of the second half,
Tiny's boys really went to work.
They were making yardage where
there was no yardage before. They
were stopping Schindler cold, and
Trojan Backs Wayne Hoffman and
Bill Sangster were in the same boat.
The Indians piled up eight first
downs, while the Trojans were
squeezing out one oh a 30-yard
pass gain.
