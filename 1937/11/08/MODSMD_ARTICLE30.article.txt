"I don't like this show," a young
Stanfordite told his date Friday
night. "Here are the keys to the
car. When the show's over, pick me
up at Toyon."
Trouble began when the show
was over, and she tried to find the
car. .For half an hour she walked
up and down the streets of Paly,
but —no car.
Desperately, she went to the po
lice station. For another half hour
she cruised around Paly in a po
lice car, while the police station
droned, "All cars be on the look
out for a green Packard 120 coupe
—reported stolen."
"There's an' alley we haven't
looked in," said the policeman at
last. "Oh, no," she said. "We'd nev
er park in an alley."
They drove to the alley, and
there —half a block from the the
ater —was the car. "Don't you
think," said the policeman, "I'd bet
ter drive you out to the campus, in
case you lose that, too?"
