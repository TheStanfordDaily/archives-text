St) STANFORD
lIAD "NO CHANCE?''
Ever since the 1937 season began,
it has been the general opinion that
Stanford hadn't a chance. Sports
writei's last September placed the
Indians away down the list in their
predictions of final conference rat
ings.
Nobody was fool enough to sug
gest that the Stanford learn could
ever reach second place. And now
the Cards have a shot at first—a
long shot, hut not an impossibil
ity-
If Stanford and Cal sail through
Washington State and Oregon, re
spectively, next Saturday, the score
a week later can yell, "game point,
conference point, and Rose Bowl de
cision point."
All these will be decided in the
Big Game. A University of Califor
nia victory will, of course, place the
Golden Bears on the conference
throne and in the Rose Bowl. A tie
score will do the same. A Stanford
victory will bring the Indians con
ference honors.
The Rose Bowl decision, in the
event of a Card victory, will loom
before the Rose Bowl Committee as
a difficult and complex problem, es
pecially if the victory is decisive.
The committeemen will feel that
the Wonder Team is still superior,
but they co'jld not overlook a two
or three-touchdown victory by the
Cards.
FUTURE DEPENDS ON
GAME WITH COUGARS
But a Big Game victory, a confer
ence win, and a Rose Bowl invita
tion for Stanford are only possibil
ities. They depend first upon a Stan
ford win over Washington State
next Saturday.
The Cougars, with a disorgan
ized offense and weak defense,
should he no match for the Big
Red Machine, hut Coach Babe
Hollingberry's hoys will have one
important point in their favor —
overconfidenee of the Indians. The
Stanford players need only to re
member, however, (hat it was not
Saturday's one-point victory alone
that put them where they are—it
was Washington's scoreless tie
against the Bears.
The Cards have shown fairly regu
lar improvement all season, and
they may continue. Every game has
brought out a better Indian combi
nation both on offense and on de
fense.
The varsity team's greatest weak
ness before last Saturday had been
in spirit, but that second-half flour
ish in the S.C. tilt showed that the
spirit is there if the players care to
take it out and use it.
WHAT HAPPENED
AT HALF-TIME?
It looked Saturday as though
somebody had lit the fuse during
half-time, but there was no pep talk
and no reason for a turning point.
The reason for the third-quarter
spurt came after the quarter had
started. Captain Stone called an off
tackle play from a single-wingback
formation, and it worked. He tried
it again, and it worked again. It
seemed to work almost every time
it was tried. Stanford was making
progress, and teamwork was in evi
dence.
The Big Red Machine has oiled
its only rusty bearing, and Stan
ford students have every reason to
believe that their team will "truck
on down." The players will gar
ner themselves a victory next
week and will make a perform
ance far from disgraceful in the
Big Game.
Beat Cal? Well, greater miracles
have happened — and the Stanford
boys will be in there with nothing
to lose and everything to gain.
