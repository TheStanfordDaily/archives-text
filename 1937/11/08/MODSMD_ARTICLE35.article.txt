# Papooses Take Cubs, End Nine-Year Famine
## Card Frosh On Long End Of 13-0 Score Standlee, Peterson Top Gridmen for Indians In Little Big Game 
### WALT PETERSON 
Nino years of famine came to an
lend in the stadium Saturday, as
Coach Harry Shipkey's freshman
J gridders ground out a solid 13-0
i victory over Jerry Lutes and the
i California freshman football team.
It was the first time in the last 10
| years that a Card frosh team was
j able to put one over on a Clint
Evans - coached eleven — even tire
famous Vowing Sophs as freshmen
were unable to snake out a victory.
And Jerry Lutes is given such
prominent mention because without
Jerry Lutes the Cubs would no more
be a football team than the Stanford
band. There shall be more of him,
later.
Standlee Tops
Leader of the Stanford attack was
no one man—although Norm Stand
lee, a speeding bruiser from 'way
back, made virtually five yards a
crack for the 14 times he carried the
ball. Thor Peterson, the Hoquiam
Norseman who hit his physical peak
for the game, was the kid who had
j the most fingers in the scoring pie.
It was he who threw a 12-yard
pass to Meiners for the first touch
| down, on the first play of the second
, quarter, and it was he who took
Norm Standlee's short fourth-quar
j ter toss and scrambled 16 vicious
I yards for the second score.
'Bad Break'
Quentin Thompson, but for one
j bad break when he fumbled a lat
j eral and wound up with a 27-yard
i loss on his record, was tough on of-
I fense and, as usual, tferrific on de
i fense.
Lest we forget, there was "Swede"
Johansen, tackle, who was head and
j shoulders above all other linemen on
j the field, particularly on defense.
Bill Grant, in and out at end all
day, staged some pretty nifty stuff
himself to gather a little glory.
I As for Lutes, heart and soul of the
Cal team, there was little he didn't
do to win the ball game, except
score. Otherwise he was terrific.
I He carried the ball 34 times out of
| his team's 53 scrimmage plays, and
I threw 16 of 20 passes, completing
I five.
Lutes Stars for Cal
If there was a backfield tackle
during the game that Lutes wasn't
| in on while he was playing, nobody
remembers it. The nine Cal punts
| were made by Lutes, every one out
1 of bounds and still averaging better
! than 30 yards.
He was at safety for four out of
I five punt returns and averaged more
i than 12 yards per run-back.
In short, Lutes, with the assist-
I ance of ten other players, was the
| California team Saturday.
Statistics for the game were even
steven. Stanford gained 131 yards
from scrum, Cal advanced 141. The
: Papooses lost 38, Cal lost 37. First
downs were six for Stanford, seven
j for California.
Cards Make Yards
Passing gave Stanford an edge on
l total yardage, for the Papooses made
79 yards on three completed tosses,
the Cubs totaled 48 yards on seven
completed throws.
The game closed a sporadic season
for Shipkey's charges, a season that
saw them giving flashes of promise.
There should be considerable likely
material from that squad for next
year's varsity.
