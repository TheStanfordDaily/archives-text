### GENE GEAR 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6 (Special 1
to The Daily. — Stanford's visiting
band of varsity water poloists em
erged from two nerve-tingling
aquatic encounters here this week
end with a fifty-fifty average.
Yesterday afternoon the U.C.L.A.
Bruins rose to great heights in the
last two minutes of play to nose out
the Card amphibians, 8-6, and today
the Indians turned the tables by
clicking in the last two minutes to (
edge past the U.S.C. Trojans, 7-5. I
Uclans Rally
Yesterday's game at Westwood j
was a see-saw battle from start to I
finish as the underdog Farm pad
dlers played superb ball to hold the
highly touted Bruins in check
throughout. Nort Thornton's men
had a 3-1 lead in the first half, but
the Uclans rallied to tie it at 3-all
at half time. With two minutes to |
play and the Indians out in front, J
6-5, Dick Norton, Bruin forward, |
went wild to chalk up three goals !
and a Westwood victory.
Devere Christensen, ace Bruin j
center forward, controlled the sprint j
throughout the game, which gave 1
the Uclans a heavy advantage, j
Johnny Lamb, Stanford's all - coast !
| forward, tied Norton for high scor- I
ing honors with four goals apiece. ,
Card Forwards "Bob Plate and Har- j
vey Rothschild each put in one to .
j complete Stanford's scoring.
Hanna Is Star
The work of Bill Burns in the I
| Stanford goal was outstanding in 1
both games. He played his position
far better than Walt Wood, U. C.
i L. A.'s second string all-coast goalie. 1
j Burns' play in the Trojan game to- :
day stamps him as a possible con-
I ference all-star this season.
Bruising Bill Hanna, Stanford's
! captain and guard, was the spark
plug throughout the game despite
I numerous fouls called on him.
In today's little fray with the Tro
jans, Stanford decided to do the last
j minute rallying and climbed out of
! the pool with a win. With a few
minutes to play in the game, the
Cards were trailing, 5-3. Thornton
I shifted Hanna from guard to for-
I ward at this point and the Farm
paddlers clicked for four goals with
! Lamb making two, Hanna one, and

Dick Hoover one. Lamb again tied
for second honors, this time with
Jim Hastings of Troy. They each
scored three times. Rothschild,
playing consistently good ball, scored
twice.
Cards in Tie
The work of Hoover on defense
and his handling of the ball ac
counted in part for Stanford's vic
tory today.
This week-end's games leave the
Cards in a tie with the Trojans for
third place in the conference.
