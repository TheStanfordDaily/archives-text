## But The Cougars Come First 
### 
OF course, Stanford hasn't the Rose Bowl
bid yet, but many a presuming after-the
game bull-sessioner on campus or in Los An
geies has it completely in the bag for Stanford's
Indians. And if you would listen, he could tell
you just how he figures it.
The team has lost one and tied one. Cal was
tied by Washington. A win for Stanford in the
Big Game would knot the conference race, and
since Stanford would have beaten Cal, whom
could the committee pick? The answer is ob
viously Stanford. And a two- or three-touch
down victory v/ould make it a cinch of the
lead pipe variety.
The game Saturday? What's Washington
State done? Cal beat 'em, didn't they?
Psychologists give this one of their simple
terms, wishful thinking. It's like a team behind
in the last few minutes thinking so much about
what it is going to do with the ball when it gets
it, that it fails to think about defense.
Suppose we build up a case for the other side
in the same manner.
True, Washington State has a poor record, but
every team on the Coast is spotty this season,
and that includes Cal tfter Saturday's game.
Washington proved it had one good game in
its system, W.S.C. may do the same thing this

week.
Winter is coming on, perhaps it will rain Sat
urday. That would rob the team of the weapon
it used to win in Los Angeles. The ground at
tack in the last two games, though functioning
well in midfield, has bogged down as it neared
the 20-yard line. Passes may be needed to win,
and passing is ineffective in the rain.
Then there are injuries. Paulman is supposed
to be rounding into shape, but he is particularly
vulnerable. Fay and other key men could be
hurt early in the game.
On recent comparative scores, Stanford might
be one point better than the Cougars, who have
tied U.S.C.
It all boils down to this. Stanford is little if
any better than an even choice to beat the Cou
gars, and that is the game that counts just now.
The Big Game, at this point, isn't even to be
considered.
After the Cougar game, if Stanford wins, the
campus can worry about the Big Game. After
the Big Game, if Stanford wins, it can worry
about a Rose Bowl bid. After the Rose Bowl bid,
A1 Masters can worry about some Honolulu
contracts.
Meanwhile, everyone can worry about Wash
ington State.—L. L.

Then there are injuries. Paulman is supposed
to be rounding into shape, but he is particularly
vulnerable. Fay and other key men could be
hurt early in the game.
On recent comparative scores, Stanford might
be one point better than the Cougars, who have
tied U.S.C.
It all boils down to this. Stanford is little if
any better than an even choice to beat the Cou
gars, and that is the game that counts just now.
The Big Game, at this point, isn't even to be
considered.
After the Cougar game, if Stanford wins, the
campus can worry about the Big Game. After
the Big Game, if Stanford wins, it can worry
about a Rose Bowl bid. After the Rose Bowl bid,
A1 Masters can worry about some Honolulu
contracts.
Meanwhile, everyone can worry about Wash
ington State.—L. L.
OF course, Stanford hasn't the Rose Bowl
bid yet, but many a presuming after-the
game bull-sessioner on campus or in Los An
geies has it completely in the bag for Stanford's
Indians. And if you would listen, he could tell
you just how he figures it.
The team has lost one and tied one. Cal was
tied by Washington. A win for Stanford in the
Big Game would knot the conference race, and
since Stanford would have beaten Cal, whom
could the committee pick? The answer is ob
viously Stanford. And a two- or three-touch
down victory v/ould make it a cinch of the
lead pipe variety.
The game Saturday? What's Washington
State done? Cal beat 'em, didn't they?
Psychologists give this one of their simple
terms, wishful thinking. It's like a team behind
in the last few minutes thinking so much about
what it is going to do with the ball when it gets
it, that it fails to think about defense.
Suppose we build up a case for the other side
in the same manner.
True, Washington State has a poor record, but
every team on the Coast is spotty this season,
and that includes Cal tfter Saturday's game.
Washington proved it had one good game in
its system, W.S.C. may do the same thing this

week.
Winter is coming on, perhaps it will rain Sat
urday. That would rob the team of the weapon
it used to win in Los Angeles. The ground at
tack in the last two games, though functioning
well in midfield, has bogged down as it neared
the 20-yard line. Passes may be needed to win,
and passing is ineffective in the rain.
