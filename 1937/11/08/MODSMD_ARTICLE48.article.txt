THAT Sunday night movies are another step
in secularizing Stanford's Sabbath is the
charge of a number of Palo Alto religious
groups, who fear that soon "Sunday will mean
no more than any other day to students."
Chief ecclesiastical wail is that the University
should not allow itself to become associated
with the commercialization of the Sabbath, and
that cheap convenient cinema might halve the
attendance at the churches' Sunday evening
young people's meetings, such as the Roger
Williams Club, the Stanford Club, the Y.W.C.A.,
and other groups which average 5 to 45 stu
dents apiece at their weekly meetings.
Leaders of these groups consider Stanford
a character-building institution and as such they
think it should co-operate with other character
building organizations instead of making their
goal more difficult of attainment.
On the other side of the fence are Stanford
student leaders who, with the approval of Dean
Mary Yost and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, worked
out the movie series which began last week with
"All Quiet on the Western Front."
Backing the students' opinions are a number
of more or less obvious arguments.
First and most important is that the student
body should be left the privilege of deciding
how and where it wants to spend its Sunday
evenings, that the University cannot and should
not attempt to limit the recreational facilities

available to students unless these facilities are
in some way harmful.
Stanfordites really interested in the weekly
religious activities will not be drawn from them
by movies—even if the admission fee is only
15 cents. Since recent releases are always
available in Paly for 40 cents, the chance to
save a quarter ought not to lead many away
from the church gatherings.
And local entertainment may do some real
good. It may stop the Sunday night exodus to
San Francisco and down the highway. It might
even be the prop to a punch-drunk back-to-the-
Farm movement.
Another point in favor of the Sunday nighters
is that some censorship is exerted on the choice
of films. Instead of any old thing the producers
want to send, the students can be provided with
the so-called classics of moviedom.
Stanford's movie series continues next Sun
day, with everyone but certain of the religious
groups still labeling it "8.0.K."—J. R.

"All Quiet on the Western Front."
Backing the students' opinions are a number
of more or less obvious arguments.
First and most important is that the student
body should be left the privilege of deciding
how and where it wants to spend its Sunday
evenings, that the University cannot and should
not attempt to limit the recreational facilities

available to students unless these facilities are
in some way harmful.
Stanfordites really interested in the weekly
religious activities will not be drawn from them
by movies—even if the admission fee is only
15 cents. Since recent releases are always
available in Paly for 40 cents, the chance to
save a quarter ought not to lead many away
from the church gatherings.
And local entertainment may do some real
good. It may stop the Sunday night exodus to
San Francisco and down the highway. It might
even be the prop to a punch-drunk back-to-the-
Farm movement.
Another point in favor of the Sunday nighters
is that some censorship is exerted on the choice
of films. Instead of any old thing the producers
want to send, the students can be provided with
the so-called classics of moviedom.
Stanford's movie series continues next Sun
day, with everyone but certain of the religious
groups still labeling it "8.0.K."—J. R.
THAT Sunday night movies are another step
in secularizing Stanford's Sabbath is the
charge of a number of Palo Alto religious
groups, who fear that soon "Sunday will mean
no more than any other day to students."
Chief ecclesiastical wail is that the University
should not allow itself to become associated
with the commercialization of the Sabbath, and
that cheap convenient cinema might halve the
attendance at the churches' Sunday evening
young people's meetings, such as the Roger
Williams Club, the Stanford Club, the Y.W.C.A.,
and other groups which average 5 to 45 stu
dents apiece at their weekly meetings.
Leaders of these groups consider Stanford
a character-building institution and as such they
think it should co-operate with other character
building organizations instead of making their
goal more difficult of attainment.
On the other side of the fence are Stanford
student leaders who, with the approval of Dean
Mary Yost and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, worked
out the movie series which began last week with
"All Quiet on the Western Front."
