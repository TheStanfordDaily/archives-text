# BULL SESSION

WORKERS OF THE WORLD
I)RESIDENT Charles Seymour of Yale sent a number
of eye-brows soaring toward mortar-boards re
cently when ho came out in favor of extra-curricular
activities. Academic viewing with alarm hurtled up
to a new peak as Seymour praised the "good citizen
ship and social responsibility" developed by the
"extra-curricular life of the campus."
The Seymour statement, may have set self-appoint
ed efficiency experts shouting for aspirin; but to most
students it was as welcome as the 12 o'clock bell.
Critics of American universities insist that more work
should be piled on the undergraduate. They
with smug sadness to the way we waste time on
activities, on dances, and on bull sessions. And the
undergraduate plodding on through a wilderness of
source readings can answer only that if there is any
more work he will flunk out of school and become
an efficiency expert.

Stanford is noted for its humane treatment of stu
dents. It regards the undergraduate as something
more than an intellectual draft horse. But even so, it
makes the farm student uneasy to think of taking on
any more work. Already the waters of international
trade are rising above his nose, and the elusive bill
of exchange is getting lost in a morass of francs, pounds
and dollars. Social psychology has made the prob
lems of the adolescent Samoan girl his problems. If
he should take on any more work, the Samoan girl
and the bill of exchange would be criminally neglected.
But the critics still demand that universities "ad
vance their scholarship." President Seymour's state
ment at last gives them an authoritative answer. "Edu
cation," he says, "is not confined within the classroom
walls where tangibles can be had for the asking. With
some men intangibles count for more . . .

A NOTHER point that critics overlook is the fact
that college students don't exactly vegetate as it
is. The public is very nasty these days when some
wicked economic royalist works his laborers more than
eight hours a day. There are strikes and telegrams
from Washington; and the newspapers run scorching
editorials.
But when a college announces that it expects nine
hours' work a day from students the public howls
about "declining scholarship." And nine hours a day
is a normal 15-unit course.

If a clerk has to work overtime, there is hair
tearing at home, and double pay at the office. But
when a college student settles down with a thermos
full of coffee and an econ book full of headaches,
nobody pays any attention.
Whenever the critics open a new campaign for
scholarship, the students see their limited recreation
time vanishing. And when Dr. Seymour champions
the cause of activities he becomes a true leader of
oppressed masses. Perhaps we ought to take up a col
lection and huv him a suit of shining armor.
