cently in The Daily Californian to prove that
Editor Bill Murrish still has a sense of humor.

IVIARK TWAIN'S "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"
has been snatched from the public libraries and
public schools of Rio de Janeiro. It is branded by the
Brazilians as subversive communist literature, calcu
lated to corrupt the youthful mind.
Alas, little did we realize, when we perused the en
thralling adventures of Tom and his comrade, Huck,
that they were but sugar-coating for communist
preachments cunningly devised to undermine our faith
in the established order, indoctrinate us with Marxian
ideology, and sow the seeds of proletarian revolt! Of
course, reading the adventures of Tom and Huck to
day, we, as mature men and women, can detect the
subtle propaganda and see the dastardly plot in its
entirety.
We realize now that the perpetual revolt of Tom
against the stern authority of Aunt Polly was an insid
ious Marxian allegory. Aunt Polly represented the
vested interests—the capitalistic oligarchy that seeks
to enchain the great middle class, embodied in Tom, and
the unwashed proletariat symbolized by Huck. Aunt
Polly, the Widow Douglas and Judge Thatcher strove
fiendishly, by every foul and under-handed device
known to a corrupt society, to enslave the souls of
Tom and Huck with catechisms, to imprison their
bodies in the stiff-starched shirts of social conformity,
and to confine their bare feet in leathern shoes.
Now that the plot has been shown up by the
Brazilians, it must be apparent that the famous epi
sode of the whitewashed fence was not merely a
humorous interlude, but a sinister attack on the insti
tution of private ownership in the tools of production.
In the fence episode, the entrepreneur tricks the prole
tariat into performing labors for which he collects the
reward.
If our good neighbors to the south are right in their
premise it seems obvious that even Samuel Clemens'
pseudonym was a phony. His real identity must have
been Marxian Agent Number Two, represented on the
secret rolls of Moscow by "Marx Twain."

bodies in the stiff-starched shirts of social conformity,
and to confine their bare feet in leathern shoes.
Now that the plot has been shown up by the
Brazilians, it must be apparent that the famous epi
sode of the whitewashed fence was not merely a
humorous interlude, but a sinister attack on the insti
tution of private ownership in the tools of production.
In the fence episode, the entrepreneur tricks the prole
tariat into performing labors for which he collects the
reward.
If our good neighbors to the south are right in their
premise it seems obvious that even Samuel Clemens'
pseudonym was a phony. His real identity must have
been Marxian Agent Number Two, represented on the
secret rolls of Moscow by "Marx Twain."
Sandwiched between edits entitled "Is Harry
Bridges a Communist" and "The Social Back
ground of the Department Store Strike" this clip
ping from the Chicago Daily News appeared re
cently in The Daily Californian to prove that
Editor Bill Murrish still has a sense of humor.

IVIARK TWAIN'S "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"
has been snatched from the public libraries and
public schools of Rio de Janeiro. It is branded by the
Brazilians as subversive communist literature, calcu
lated to corrupt the youthful mind.
Alas, little did we realize, when we perused the en
thralling adventures of Tom and his comrade, Huck,
that they were but sugar-coating for communist
preachments cunningly devised to undermine our faith
in the established order, indoctrinate us with Marxian
ideology, and sow the seeds of proletarian revolt! Of
course, reading the adventures of Tom and Huck to
day, we, as mature men and women, can detect the
subtle propaganda and see the dastardly plot in its
entirety.
We realize now that the perpetual revolt of Tom
against the stern authority of Aunt Polly was an insid
ious Marxian allegory. Aunt Polly represented the
vested interests—the capitalistic oligarchy that seeks
to enchain the great middle class, embodied in Tom, and
the unwashed proletariat symbolized by Huck. Aunt
Polly, the Widow Douglas and Judge Thatcher strove
fiendishly, by every foul and under-handed device
known to a corrupt society, to enslave the souls of
Tom and Huck with catechisms, to imprison their
bodies in the stiff-starched shirts of social conformity,
and to confine their bare feet in leathern shoes.
