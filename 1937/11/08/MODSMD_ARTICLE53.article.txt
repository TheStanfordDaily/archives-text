LOYALIST MEETING

The Editor, Sir:
Tuesday night it was my rather
dubious privilege to listen to
speeches sponsored by the so-called
Committee for Medical Aid to Span
ish Democracy and to see a movie
intended to support the "cause" at
the Palo Alto Community Play
house.
I went into the playhouse, having
spent my two-bits with an open
and innocent mind, hoping and ex
pecting to learn something of the
actual situation in Spain and to
learn what was to be done toward
medical aid with funds raised in
this country.
Instead, we were told how the
rebel "devils" had deliberately
plotted and killed ruthlessly women
and children of the "democratic"
faction; we were shown dead men
lying in grotesque positions; we
were shown arms amputated at the
elbows, while the voice from the
screen told us of the horrors the
"devils" had inflicted upon the
"patriots."
We were told that our President
was more of a leftist than the loyal
ist government itself and we were
then shown pictures of soldiers giv
ing the Communist salute, which
almost brought down the house with

applause.
Small wonder the Ex Committee
dinged such a meeting. Even Hearst
would have laughed at such a crude
effort at propaganda, thinly veneered
by such a worthy cause as medical
aid. If this were the best our high
salaried American propagandists
could have done in 1917, America
would have laughed the World War
out of existence.
If this committee were honestly
seeking to give medical aid to the
Spaniards in the present crisis, why
couldn't they go after funds in the
same way as the Red Cross has
done in the past? Why not raise
funds and distribute them equally
between the Loyalist and Rebel
factions if the object is to relieve
human suffering? It is quite prob
able that much more'money could
be raised for both sides if the issue
was truly and simply medical aid,
apart from any political partiality.
Why not give it a try?

The Editor, Sir:
Your purely academic attitude,
sir, is to be confounded, utterly con
founded. In connection with a little
whatsit appearing in your filler
space, I must say you are quite mis
informed. Any law student could

tell you that a will and a testament
are not one and the same thing

nor is one more essentially a Nor
man word than the other.
To make it short, will, a typically
Anglo-Saxon word, Germanic in
origin, is the proper name for a de
vise of land, and paradoxically this
was not generally used until Norman

times.
Testament, on the other hand, a
word of Latin and more typically
Norman use, is the proper term to
describe a devise of personal prop
erty, and quite contrary to the in
timations of your squib, was known
long before the Norman Conquest,
which event changed its use very
little.

Since this is not of a discursive
nature I pray you accept it without
signature.

faction; we were shown dead men
lying in grotesque positions; we
were shown arms amputated at the
elbows, while the voice from the
screen told us of the horrors the
"devils" had inflicted upon the
"patriots."
We were told that our President
was more of a leftist than the loyal
ist government itself and we were
then shown pictures of soldiers giv
ing the Communist salute, which
almost brought down the house with

applause.
Small wonder the Ex Committee
dinged such a meeting. Even Hearst
would have laughed at such a crude
effort at propaganda, thinly veneered
by such a worthy cause as medical
aid. If this were the best our high
salaried American propagandists
could have done in 1917, America
would have laughed the World War
out of existence.
If this committee were honestly
seeking to give medical aid to the
Spaniards in the present crisis, why
couldn't they go after funds in the
same way as the Red Cross has
done in the past? Why not raise
funds and distribute them equally
between the Loyalist and Rebel
factions if the object is to relieve
human suffering? It is quite prob
able that much more'money could
be raised for both sides if the issue
was truly and simply medical aid,
apart from any political partiality.
Why not give it a try?

The Editor, Sir:
Your purely academic attitude,
sir, is to be confounded, utterly con
founded. In connection with a little
whatsit appearing in your filler
space, I must say you are quite mis
informed. Any law student could

tell you that a will and a testament
are not one and the same thing

nor is one more essentially a Nor
man word than the other.
To make it short, will, a typically
Anglo-Saxon word, Germanic in
origin, is the proper name for a de
vise of land, and paradoxically this
was not generally used until Norman

times.
Testament, on the other hand, a
word of Latin and more typically
Norman use, is the proper term to
describe a devise of personal prop
erty, and quite contrary to the in
timations of your squib, was known
long before the Norman Conquest,
which event changed its use very
little.

LOYALIST MEETING

The Editor, Sir:
Tuesday night it was my rather
dubious privilege to listen to
speeches sponsored by the so-called
Committee for Medical Aid to Span
ish Democracy and to see a movie
intended to support the "cause" at
the Palo Alto Community Play
house.
I went into the playhouse, having
spent my two-bits with an open
and innocent mind, hoping and ex
pecting to learn something of the
actual situation in Spain and to
learn what was to be done toward
medical aid with funds raised in
this country.
Instead, we were told how the
rebel "devils" had deliberately
plotted and killed ruthlessly women
and children of the "democratic"
faction; we were shown dead men
lying in grotesque positions; we
were shown arms amputated at the
elbows, while the voice from the
screen told us of the horrors the
"devils" had inflicted upon the
"patriots."
