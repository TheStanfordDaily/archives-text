# Tri-Power Pact Called 'Unfriendly'
## Italy's Sympathy With Germany, Japan May Cause Official Break 
### 
ROME, Nov. 8 (U.R).—Strained re
lations between Italy and Russia
neared a diplomatic break tonight
when the Soviet ambassador to Rome
warned that Italy's adherence to the
German-Japanese pact against com
munism was "contrary to the friend
ship accord of 1933."
An official communique revealed
that the warning was delivered when
the Russian ambassador Boris E.
Stein visited Count Galeazzo Ciano,
Italian foreign minister, during the
day.
Stein told Ciano that the tri
power pact constituted "an un
friendly gesture toward the Soviet
government on the part of Italy,"
in view of the existing Russian-
Italian friendship treaty.
The critical state of Italo-Russian
relations brought Premier Benito
Mussolini back to Rome by air
plane from Forli, cutting short a
holiday, after an urgent telephone
call from Ciano, his son-in-law.
Severance May Follow
It was generally believed that if
Italy fails to give "satisfactory as
surances" to Russia regarding the
anti - communist accord signed in
Rome Saturday, a severance of dip
lomatic relations will follow.
Suspicion persisted, despite de
nials from Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo,
that there might be secret military
clauses attached to the agreement.
This suspicion was heightened when
five German warships joined the
Italian fleet in target maneuvers
yesterday off the Fascist fortified
base of Gaeta.
Relations Strained
Diplomatic relations between Mos
cow and Rome have been near the
breaking point for three months—
since Russia denounced the fiction
of non-intervention in Spain and ac
cused Italy, in two notes, of being
the "anonymous power" responsible
for "pirate" submarine attacks on
merchant shipping in the Mediter
ranean.
Russia also has denounced Italy
for allegedly attempting to block
efforts of the Far Eastern Peace Con
ference in Brussels to bring about
peace in the Orient.
Polish Adherence
It was speculated that Poland—
barrier between Germany and Rus
sia—might be contemplating adher
ing to the pact. It was asserted after
Italy's signing Saturday that imme
diate efforts probably would be made
to obtain the signatures of Poland
and Austria and draw an anti-Com
munist cordon around Russia.
A Foreign Office spokesman in
Warsaw, denying that Poland con
templated subscribing to the pact,
said. "'Anyone who knows the ABC
of Poland's foreign policy would
never believe that Poland would join
an ideological bloc; Poland, in prin
ciple, is opposed to such blocs and
will remain neutral toward them."

Relations Strained
Diplomatic relations between Mos
cow and Rome have been near the
breaking point for three months—
since Russia denounced the fiction
of non-intervention in Spain and ac
cused Italy, in two notes, of being
the "anonymous power" responsible
for "pirate" submarine attacks on
merchant shipping in the Mediter
ranean.
Russia also has denounced Italy
for allegedly attempting to block
efforts of the Far Eastern Peace Con
ference in Brussels to bring about
peace in the Orient.
Polish Adherence
It was speculated that Poland—
barrier between Germany and Rus
sia—might be contemplating adher
ing to the pact. It was asserted after
Italy's signing Saturday that imme
diate efforts probably would be made
to obtain the signatures of Poland
and Austria and draw an anti-Com
munist cordon around Russia.
A Foreign Office spokesman in
Warsaw, denying that Poland con
templated subscribing to the pact,
said. "'Anyone who knows the ABC
of Poland's foreign policy would
never believe that Poland would join
an ideological bloc; Poland, in prin
ciple, is opposed to such blocs and
will remain neutral toward them."
ROME, Nov. 8 (U.R).—Strained re
lations between Italy and Russia
neared a diplomatic break tonight
when the Soviet ambassador to Rome
warned that Italy's adherence to the
German-Japanese pact against com
munism was "contrary to the friend
ship accord of 1933."
An official communique revealed
that the warning was delivered when
the Russian ambassador Boris E.
Stein visited Count Galeazzo Ciano,
Italian foreign minister, during the
day.
Stein told Ciano that the tri
power pact constituted "an un
friendly gesture toward the Soviet
government on the part of Italy,"
in view of the existing Russian-
Italian friendship treaty.
The critical state of Italo-Russian
relations brought Premier Benito
Mussolini back to Rome by air
plane from Forli, cutting short a
holiday, after an urgent telephone
call from Ciano, his son-in-law.
Severance May Follow
It was generally believed that if
Italy fails to give "satisfactory as
surances" to Russia regarding the
anti - communist accord signed in
Rome Saturday, a severance of dip
lomatic relations will follow.
Suspicion persisted, despite de
nials from Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo,
that there might be secret military
clauses attached to the agreement.
This suspicion was heightened when
five German warships joined the
Italian fleet in target maneuvers
yesterday off the Fascist fortified
base of Gaeta.
