## Pinza Brought to Opera By Loss in Cycling Race 
### CORENA CRASE 
If E/.io Pinza, who will sing here tomorrow night, had not discovered
he possessed a remarkable talent for singing, he might still be a six-day
bicycel rider for that was his main ambition in life.
Failing to bring home a prize at cycling, he took up singing at Bologna
and has since become the leading basso of the Metropolitan Opera Company.

Although he comes of a Roman
[ family, none of whom were musical,
i his talent for singing was revealed
[ early, and it was a group of his team
t mates that urged him to cultivate his
voice.
The war prevented an early debut
| for he served as an officer of artil
lery posted in the Italian Alps, where
I he kept his voice in an "ice box"
I for four years.
Debut in Rome
After the war he made his first
| appearance in Rome, where he made
a tremendous hit paving the way
for his American debut in a revival
of Spontini's "La Vestale."
The great singer considers his
singing more of a hobby than a life
work.
He believes that a singer who can
act has a far better chance today
than the static variety of singers of
the old school. "The artist must do
more than sing beautifully; he must
convey the character that the com
poser had in mind," is his belief.

Pinza will open the concert series
programs for the 1937-38 season in
