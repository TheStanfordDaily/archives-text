# 'Oh Hum', Says SAE with Wanderlust
## 
### 
"Oh hum," scrawled Stanford Ex- I
change Student Dick Spencer in his
diary last September 10 when he
found himself in Hongkong with
"nothing left to do but go to Eu
rope."
Spencer left last July for China
where he planned to study as an
exchange student at the University
of Lingnan. Before school began,
however, the Chinese-Japanese war
was on and Spencer with the other
exchange students was not allowed
to start classes. Too late to make the
Stanford Reg Day deadline, Spen
cer set out for the Continent where
he will travel until time to return
to the Farm via the Queen Mary
for winter quarter.
Keeps Diary
Spencer kept his fraternity broth- i
ers at the S.A.E. house informed of ,
his adventures by means of "diary
letters." These letters have now I

been collected into one complete
diary work which tells of Spencer's
embarrassment bathing in Japan,
going through a typhoon in Hong
kong, being subjected to an air raid
in Canton, and numerous other ex
periences of bis wanderings. Say
excerpts from the diary:
Hide-and-Go-Seek
Saturday, July 24; aboard Heian
Maru: . . . played hide-and-go-seek
with five other fellows.
Monday, July 26; aboard Heian
Maru: . . . After dinner saw some
movies on A deck. The sound appa
ratus was too loud and a cockroach
parked himself on the screen during
the whole performance.
Wednesday, July 28; aboard Heian
Maru: After dinner we had movies
again, sound system too quiet this
time.
Thursday, July 29; aboard Heian
Maru; only 2500 miles from Yoko
hama.

Saturday, July 31; aboard Heian
Maru: No Saturday this time.
Sunday, August 1; aboard Heian
Maru: Fortunate for the missiona
ries aboard we didn't cross the 180 th
meridian on Sunday.
Friday, August fi; Yokohama: I
was struck with the strangest feeling
when I saw all the Oriental faces
and costumes standing on the dock.
It didn't seem at all real—more like
a movie setting. It was funny, ev
everyone stared at us and we stared
at them.
Becomes Bargainer
Wednesday, August 11; Japan:
Saw the original "Hear, Speak, and
See No Evil" monkeys. Getting to
be a pretty good bargainer. Pointers:
take your time; don't seem too anx
ious, and cut the price in half to
begin with.
Thursday, August 12; Lake Chu
zenji, Japan: The service at the Inn
