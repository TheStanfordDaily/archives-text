# Excom to Study Course Change
## Pre-Big Game Jolly-up To Be Considered 
### 
A proposal by the Student-Faculty
Relations Committee to institute a !
new course on "Personal Problems j
in Modern Society," will be consid- '
ered by Ex Committee tonight.
The purpose of the group, estab- ,
lished last year, is to further stu
dent-faculty relations, air student j
gripes on curricula.
They were active last year in pro- \
moting Sunday night suppers at the >
homes of faculty members, consid
ering complaints and suggestions as |
to courses of study. This is the first
time, however, that definite action
has been taken to add to the Stan
ford curriculum.
Second question to be discussed is ,
the possible hitch in plans to bring
a name band for the pre-Big Game
jolly-up. Though it was possible I
last year to have Eddie Fitzpatrick,
then playing at the St. Francis in j
San Francisco, at a low price, new
cJnion regulations may make it im
possible to bring a name band for
the afternoon at low cost.
Plans submitted two weeks ago by j
the Debate Council to change the
structure of that body will also be
discussed in Ex Committee meeting.
The planned changes were referred
to a committee, which will report
tonight.
