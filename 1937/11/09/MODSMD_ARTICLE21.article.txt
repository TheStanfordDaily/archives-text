# Firemen To The Rescue --'Stew Late
## 
### 
With the smell of smoke lresh in
her nostrils, a woman frantically
dialed the number of the Stanford
fire department yesterday morning.
The "hello" was almost immediate,
but to the lady it seemed an age
before she managed to gasp into the
phone, "Smell smoke—fire—hurry!"
Swiftly the crew of fire-fighters
sprang into action. Thoughts of a
home burning to the ground and
infants in danger filled their minds
as they sped to 743 Santa Inez, hop
ing they would get there before too
late.
But on skidding to an abrupt stop
in front of the supposedly razed
house, they found the sheepish mat
ron sadly surveying the remains of
a badly singed stew.
"Sorry, I forgot I put it in the
oven," was her excuse.
