NORT HAS GOT
SOMETHING THERE
Coach Nort Thornton, mentor of
the varsity water polo team, has got
something there.
The boys started their season
without much experience and little
hope of repeating a conference vic
tory or even coming close to it.
Nort's only hope lay in his ace for
wards, the only leftovers from his
1936 regulars, John Lamb and Cap
tain Bill Hanna, and in Harvey
Rothschild, a transfer.
Nort started the season with
I.amb and Hanna in their old for
ward posts. Bob Plate and Bill
Blocker competed for the roam
ing forward position, ably held the
previous year by Bob "'Ace" Hoo
ver. Plate won the regular post.
The three guard spots were to be
filled by a combination of Roths
child, Dick Hoover, Jack Vibert, and
Bob Allen.
Thornton's big problem was to find
a suitable replacement for Bob
Ilsalacher, all-Coast goal guard of
the 193G team.
The greatest change in the line
up was in the split-up of what
seemed to be the foundation of the
team, the Hanna-Lamb forward
combination. The new system was
a new way to score when a guard
got the ball and tossed it, into
scoring territory.
The next game told the tale. Ev
erything worked smoothly against
the Oylmpic Club in San Francisco,
and Stanford emerged with its first
victory, by a 10-8 tally.
The same system was used in Los
Angeles this week-end, when the
varsity held U.C.L.A. to an 8-6 vic
tory and defeated U.S.C., 7-5.
The new system and the new line
up have worked with relatively
little practice. There is no telling
what will happen when the Indians
meet the highly - touted University
of California aggregation in a couple
of weeks.
THE TEAM
Outstanding scorer of the team is
JOHN LAMB, a tall, slender junior.
Famous for his graceful "snow
flake" shots, Lamb is accurate with
either left or right hand. He swims
with his body halfway out of the
water. His smooth and easy playing
make him easy meat for good
guards, but he seldom finds them in
the way.
Opposite Lamb, "in the hole," is
HARVEY ROTHSCHILD. An ex
cellent ball-handler, Harv is ca
pable of sinking plenty of shots, and
there are few swimmers better qual
ified to "feed 'em to Lamb" when
High-scoring Husky is in scoring
territory.
At roaming forward is 808
PLATE. a sophomore. Bob is an
other who swims with his body half
dry, and he covers a lot of water in
a little time.
DICK HOOVER, another sopho
more sensation, is one of the hard
est fighting guards to break water
in Encina pools for years. He puts
up more than an even battle in his
fights for the ball, and few for
wards, covered by the brother of
the immortal "Ace," get a chance to
place the ball in the goal.
Moving to a guard spot has not
decreased greatly the scoring
chances of tall blond BILL HANNA.
Still the outstanding "powerhouse"
of the squad, Hanna can sink plenty
of goals from over half the length of
the pool.
Fastest swimmer on the squad is
JACK VIBERT. also a senior. Vi
bert keeps his man well covered and
can handle the ball with great ac
curacy.
BILL BURNS has become, over
the week-end, dark-horse goal guard
of the team. He has shown promise
for two years but had never before
cinched himself a first-string post.
