# Indian Waterdogs Hold Title Chance

### 
Stanford still has a mathematical
chance of winning the Pacific Coast
waterpolo championship.
Should the Indians lose to U. C.
L. A. in their second game to be
played in Encina pools this
Saturday, they might just as well
content themselves with a lower
rung on the conference ladder. The
U.C.L.A. game will be played at 11
o'clock so as not to interfere with
the football game in the afternoon.
Coach Nort Thornton has also
scheduled game for Friday with
San Jose State. A preliminary game
will pit the Stanford frosh against
the Spartan frosh. Unless the
Spartans prove especially strong,
Thornton declared that he would
probably use his junior varsity.
