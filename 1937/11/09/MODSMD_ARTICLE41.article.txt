# Fencers To Meet Winged-0 Foilmen
## 
### 
Stanford swordsmen will spend
this week preparing for their rrieet
Friday night in the Encina Gym
against the strong Olympic Club
fencers.
In spite of Stanford's loss to Cali
fornia last Thursday night, by a
score of 14 to 11, Coach Bugge had
reasons to be optimistic because two
of the Card fencers, Calvin Woods
and Myrton Davies, won four out of
five of their matches. However, the
club will be favored.
The Olympic Club has for its
number one man A1 Snyder, Pa
cific Coast champion, who learned
his fencing while at Stanford. Stan
ford's greatest foe seems to be lack
of experience, since its third, fourth,
and fifth men were able to win only
three matches out of 15 against
California.
