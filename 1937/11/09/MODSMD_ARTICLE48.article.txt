# Soccer Men Begin Workout For Spartans
## Resume Practice After Four-day Layoff; To Meet Bears Saturday 
### 
Following a layoff of four days,
Stanford's soccerrrien resumed prac
tice yesterday afternoon in prepa
ration for their most active week of
soccer competition this season.
Tomorrow they go to San Jose
State for their second encounter
with the Spartans, whom the Indians
defeated 1-0 in the initial meeting
of these two teams. Saturday they
meet the defending champions when
they take on the California Bears at
Berkeley for the first time this year.
Besides being the Cardinals' most
strenuous week of play, it is also
their most important as far as the
conference race is concerned. Cali
fornia last week retained its posi
tion at the top of the standings with
ofte tie and no defeats by winning
its fourth conference game. The
S.F.U. Dons, however, broke a sec
ond deadlock 'with Stanford by
winning their game while the In
dians were idle.
Both teams have lost one and tied
none, but the Dons, with one more
game played, have three victories in
the win column against Stanford's
two. This week S.F.U. has a bye in
the schedule, while the Cardinals
play twice. By winning once, the
Cards can move back into a second
place tie with the Dons, and by
winning both games, they can jump
into a tie for the leadership with
the Bears.
