# Frosh Close Season
## Shipkeymen To Bolster '38 Varsity Papoose Gridders Show Steady Improvement Throughout Schedule 
### DOUG JAQUES 
ItS? all over now. The frosh foot
ballers beat Cal 13-0, and now they
can open their books and try to
beat the Bawlout. Coach Harry
Shipkey can start worrying about
frosh baseball.
People got tired of hearing all sea
son that the Papooses were improv
ing every game and making it eas
ier week by week to forget their
uninspired opener against Santa Ana,
which they lost 13-7.
Lost Two Games
But that's just what happened.
After Santa Ana they lost but two
games, a tough 13-0 lose to U.S.C.,
and a heart-breaking 14-13 defeat
at the hands of the big U.C.L.A.
squad.
They cleaned up on Modesto J. C.
20-0, San Mateo J. C. 20-0, and Cal
13-0. And they developed a goodly
number of first-rate players.
Standlee Tops
Captain Norm Standlee heads the
list of top-notchers. A fullback, he
was the big gun in every game. He
is a triple-threat man. You'll see
him playing for Tiny Thornhill next
year.
Quentin Thompson and Thor
Peterson will be varsity big shots
next year, too, if their frosh work
is any indication. Thompson is big
and fast, and he can throw a football
far and fast. Peterson is also a
passer, and he is a kicker who can
match boots with Bill Paulman or
Pete Fay.
Tricky Runner
Glen South is another good man.
Stanford didn't see much of him this
year because he was out most of
the time with injuries, but he's a
tricky runner and a good safety
man.
It's hard to say what the men on
the line can do next year. They were
good but most of them are small.
Jim Farquharson should earn a
berth at left end. Chick Orme, guard,
Bill Braheny and Swede Johansen,
tackles, are tough and clever line
men, but their size is against them.
Coast Conference standings don't
mean much in the frosh circuit, but
they're interesting to note. U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. tied for first place with
two conference wins and one loss
apiece. Stanford and Cal were tied
for second and last place, with two
losses and one win.

ballers beat Cal 13-0, and now they
can open their books and try to
beat the Bawlout. Coach Harry
Shipkey can start worrying about
frosh baseball.
People got tired of hearing all sea
son that the Papooses were improv
ing every game and making it eas
ier week by week to forget their
uninspired opener against Santa Ana,
which they lost 13-7.
Lost Two Games
But that's just what happened.
After Santa Ana they lost but two
games, a tough 13-0 lose to U.S.C.,
and a heart-breaking 14-13 defeat
at the hands of the big U.C.L.A.
squad.
They cleaned up on Modesto J. C.
20-0, San Mateo J. C. 20-0, and Cal
13-0. And they developed a goodly
number of first-rate players.
Standlee Tops
Captain Norm Standlee heads the
list of top-notchers. A fullback, he
was the big gun in every game. He
is a triple-threat man. You'll see
him playing for Tiny Thornhill next
year.
Quentin Thompson and Thor
Peterson will be varsity big shots
next year, too, if their frosh work
is any indication. Thompson is big
and fast, and he can throw a football
far and fast. Peterson is also a
passer, and he is a kicker who can
match boots with Bill Paulman or
Pete Fay.
Tricky Runner
Glen South is another good man.
Stanford didn't see much of him this
year because he was out most of
the time with injuries, but he's a
tricky runner and a good safety
man.
It's hard to say what the men on
the line can do next year. They were
good but most of them are small.
Jim Farquharson should earn a
berth at left end. Chick Orme, guard,
Bill Braheny and Swede Johansen,
tackles, are tough and clever line
men, but their size is against them.
Coast Conference standings don't
mean much in the frosh circuit, but
they're interesting to note. U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. tied for first place with
two conference wins and one loss
apiece. Stanford and Cal were tied
for second and last place, with two
losses and one win.
ItS? all over now. The frosh foot
ballers beat Cal 13-0, and now they
can open their books and try to
beat the Bawlout. Coach Harry
