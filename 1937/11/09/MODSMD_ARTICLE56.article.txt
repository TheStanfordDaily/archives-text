## Outlawing the Bogeyman 
### 
THAT Stanford may soon be among the un
blushing institutions which are stripping the
bogey of ignorance from sex. and drawing
nationwide applause for unashamed action,
becomes possible with the appearance of a
proposal now pending student approval for a
new course — Personal Problems in Modern
Society.
Drawn up by the Faculty Committee on New
Courses, in conjunction with the Student-Fac
ulty Relations Committee, the anticipated addi
tion to winter quarter's time schedule aims to
treat the problem of marriage as a social prob
lem, which divorce figures indicate is as truly
a problem as many the University seeks to il
luminate.
All phases of marital life would be discussed
in a series of lectures prepared by various
faculty members, and "invited speakers," au
thorities on particular aspects of the problem.
Not designed as a course exclusively on sex
ual relations of the marital state, it proposes to
devote at least half time to home economic
questions, budgeting, parental responsibilities,
child-rearing, and the like. But even its advo
cates regard the physiological aspects as prime
in import.
This would seem to run true, in the light of
a reasoning commonly offered as an argument
for courses in sex education. Throughout the
years of formal and informal education on mar
riage and homemaking, most every element is
touched on in classroom study with the excep
tion of the one vital point —physiological rela

tions.
The economic phases of budgeting, consumer
research, saving, and social insurance are
touched upon in the economics department.
The woman's part in home economics, cooking,
sewing, and other homemaking tasks, is han
dled in high school courses—perhaps should
be more seriously considered at Stanford.
Through overlapping study many of the non
sexual marital problems are covered at some
point in the educational process. Now it be
comes necessary to remove the mask of victo
rianism and supplant the series of back-alley
uncertainties with an adequate explanation of
the sexual and emotional truths regarding mar
riage. It isn't that Stanford people don't know
about sex. Rather, it is a need for confirmation
of what they suspect.
And with this confirmation of the physiologi
cal, will go a reiteration of the economic and
social aspects.
Such a course may be popular at first because
of innate tendencies in the human species to
lean toward pornographia. But after the first
fluster, and realization that intelligent sex edu
cation and pornographia are two greatly dif
ferent things, there cannot help but be a healthy
response hardly akin to the search for sensa
tionalism.
Stanford may take the bald displayism off sex
education by calling its course "Personal Prob
lems in Modern Society," but beneath the name
it will do well to follow the lead of other major
universities in furthering successful livelihood
by facing the marital problem squarely.
