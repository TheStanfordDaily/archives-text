# Starting on the Off-Beat

IN case anybody should ask you, today is the
day that all good frosh will go to the polls
and vote for their roommates, their roommates'
cousins, or the guy who shot off those three
firecrackers the other night.
For, except for a few intimate friends of the
candidates, no one gives a hooting howl who
wins the election.
Row and Hall machines are interested only in
a lackadaisical sort of way. Obviously they
can't be absolutely sure whom to support, and
in addition the office of freshman class presi
dent is traditionally a dead-end. Few fraterni
ties care to risk their more promising legacies
in the frosh political whirlpool.
Chief reason the freshman presidency is not
a favorite political plum is that the office offers
little or nothing in the way of appointive powers
or administrative opportunity. The handsomest
candidate is elected and then in the spring he

passes out of power—having had a lot of fun
and a picture in The Daily, but nothing else.
There is no cloud of obscurity around the
apparent lack of interest in freshman politics;
frosh are ordinarily too busy finding out the
whys and wherefores of University life to tackle
more whys and wherefores.
But it is somewhat paradoxical that the under
standable lack of interest in freshman class ac
tivities is the initiation to three years of drum
ming on the old "take interest in class activi
ties" refrain.—J. R.
