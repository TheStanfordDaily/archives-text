# BULL SESSION
## RIOT AND REVOLUTION 
### 
YESTERDAY The Daily reprinted sarcastic comment
by the Chicago Daily News on the interdict which
Rio de Janeiro has placed on the ''Adventures of Tom
Sawyer." Following the line of reasoning established
in that article, we can see that even American institu
tions are being corroded by the acid of radical propa
ganda. Only forceful action can save us from chaos.
Brazil has banned Mark Twain novels. But what
do the isolated evils of Twain amount to in compari
son with the mass production boring-from-within that
American magazines are conducting. The most super
ficial observation reveals that magazines we believed
bulwarks of American culture, magazines that we were
given as children, are conducting a subtle campaign
to overthrow all that was dear to our pioneer ancestors.
* * * *
Take, for instance, the Saturday Evening Post, which
hides its Soviet subsidization under a mask of Re
publicanism. On the cover of the current issue is a
picture of a boy watching a colored man raking
leaves. "Innocent," say the short-sighted. But it is by
such subtle impregnation that our culture is poisoned.
The whole idea glorifies the proletariat, and casts scorn
on our tradition of raising children to be cultured and
ambitious. In a properly regulated society the picture
would have shown the boy admiringly watching a
banker.
O rconsider an even more outrageous offense by
the same magazine. A recent cover pictured a boy who
had taken over a doll house and was using it as "G
man" headquarters. Obviously this is an attempt to
ridicule all law and order. How can we expect to
have a peaceful, law-abiding populace if we permit
derision of our officers.?
♦ * * *
ANOTHER obvious case of badly concealed propa
ganda is found in Colliers. This magazine has re
cently shown an interest in Mickey Mouse and allied
communist creations that would make any accred
ited guardian of morals suspicious. We have known
for some time that the movie industry is working
furiously to establish a soviet so that it won't have to
pay any more expensive dividends. Knowing this, we
can arm ourselves against it. But the subtle influence
of magazines catches us unprepared.
Who can deny that the asocial activities of Donald
Duck pave the awy for lawlessness and tunnoil? And
only the barest pretense veils the subtle analogy of
mixing races. To the unresisting mind it follows nat
urally that if mice and dogs and horses associate on
equal footing, the different races of man should follow
their example. This, we all know, is contrary to the
fundamental principles of nationalism which insist on
purity of stock and freedom from alien taint.
It is obvious, then, tht if we are to make the world
siife for dividends, we must fight the subtle poison
which magazines are spreading through our country.
The best solution would be to forbid any form of
printing whatsoever, and thus prevent subtle propa
ganda from slipping past to pollute our ideals. But
until we put ourselves on guard and open war on this
danger to American institutions, stock-brokers will die
many times before their deaths, and bondholders will
not sleep «' nivhl 1 ..

of magazines catches us unprepared.
Who can deny that the asocial activities of Donald
Duck pave the awy for lawlessness and tunnoil? And
only the barest pretense veils the subtle analogy of
mixing races. To the unresisting mind it follows nat
urally that if mice and dogs and horses associate on
equal footing, the different races of man should follow
their example. This, we all know, is contrary to the
fundamental principles of nationalism which insist on
purity of stock and freedom from alien taint.
It is obvious, then, tht if we are to make the world
siife for dividends, we must fight the subtle poison
which magazines are spreading through our country.
The best solution would be to forbid any form of
printing whatsoever, and thus prevent subtle propa
ganda from slipping past to pollute our ideals. But
until we put ourselves on guard and open war on this
danger to American institutions, stock-brokers will die

YESTERDAY The Daily reprinted sarcastic comment
by the Chicago Daily News on the interdict which
Rio de Janeiro has placed on the ''Adventures of Tom
Sawyer." Following the line of reasoning established
in that article, we can see that even American institu
tions are being corroded by the acid of radical propa
ganda. Only forceful action can save us from chaos.
Brazil has banned Mark Twain novels. But what
do the isolated evils of Twain amount to in compari
son with the mass production boring-from-within that
American magazines are conducting. The most super
ficial observation reveals that magazines we believed
bulwarks of American culture, magazines that we were
given as children, are conducting a subtle campaign
to overthrow all that was dear to our pioneer ancestors.

Take, for instance, the Saturday Evening Post, which
hides its Soviet subsidization under a mask of Re
publicanism. On the cover of the current issue is a
picture of a boy watching a colored man raking
leaves. "Innocent," say the short-sighted. But it is by
such subtle impregnation that our culture is poisoned.
The whole idea glorifies the proletariat, and casts scorn
on our tradition of raising children to be cultured and
ambitious. In a properly regulated society the picture
would have shown the boy admiringly watching a
banker.
O rconsider an even more outrageous offense by
the same magazine. A recent cover pictured a boy who
had taken over a doll house and was using it as "G
man" headquarters. Obviously this is an attempt to
ridicule all law and order. How can we expect to
have a peaceful, law-abiding populace if we permit
derision of our officers.?
♦ * * *
ANOTHER obvious case of badly concealed propa
ganda is found in Colliers. This magazine has re
cently shown an interest in Mickey Mouse and allied
communist creations that would make any accred
ited guardian of morals suspicious. We have known
for some time that the movie industry is working
furiously to establish a soviet so that it won't have to
pay any more expensive dividends. Knowing this, we
can arm ourselves against it. But the subtle influence
