'T'HERE was a young Stanford man sojourning Satur
day evening at a place known as The Grove, with
some 60-odd assorted other sophomores. But he
looked very young, and his Los Angeles date was
also young. Therefore, when the waiter mentioned
something about ages, he said with rapidity:
"My God, man, we're married."
Coming back on the train Sunday, we came across
a freshman who went to the Delta Theta dance at
Del Mar Country Club. He had a fine time, borrowed
his father's car, and went out for a ride on the roller
coaster.
After the roller-coaster, the freshman and the
Delta Theta went back to the car and couldn't find
the keys. After a complete search, they called up
father, and the uncle drove out 35 miles to give them
some more keys.
And then there were four boys who went down
on the train. Three of them sent telegrams to their
folks and dates and friends. The fourth didn't have
anyone to send a telegram to, so he sent one home,
reading:
"Arriving Saturday, have blank check ready. Love
Johnnie." Unfortunately, it arrived at 2 o'clock of
the morning and the folks didn't think it was funny.
the last minute, three Stanford girls decided
they wanted to go South for the game, so they
started Friday. They went down the Camino and
stopped in at L'Omelette for dinner, or something.
The story goes that they came back to Stanford, later.
We were down in the Biltmore lobby for a while
Saturday evening and happened to look up on the
balcony when someone shouted, "Everyone for S.C.
rally round me. Kill Stanford."
The Stanford band and other assembled University
of Palo Altans and grads started hissing. Finally the
man went away.
A Stanford combination bandman and musician
was not on the water-wagon, and neither was Jimmy
Grier un-liquidated at the Biltmore Bowl. So they
traded places for an hour, and the Stanford man
directed the orchestra. Friends and brothers say he
did well, considering.
