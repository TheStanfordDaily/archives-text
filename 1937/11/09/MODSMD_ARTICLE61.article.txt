# CAMPUS OPINION
## WANTS COMMITTEE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A committee on student - faculty
relations similar to the one men
tioned by Mr. Watkin in a recent
Campus Opinion was organized by
the A.S.S.U. last spring quarter. It
conducted a series of Sunday visits
at professional homes and contem
plated another series of Thursday
afternoon sessions in the Nitery.
Both are plans which have worked
at other universities. But campus
wide co-operation and interest are
necessary to carry them out.
This quarter the committee is dor
mant. We need new blood! So will
the ardent enthusiasts who would
like to work on such a committee
please sign up at the A.S.S.U.
office?
J. B.
