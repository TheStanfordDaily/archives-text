The undex-signed keglers of great
repute, all students of the world's
greatest educational institution, the
University of California, do hereby
lower themselves to challenge to
mortal combat any team of five
bowlers, if any, who are passing
through their adolescence at the Palo
Alto kindergarten laughingly re
ferred to as Stanford University.
We suggest that said contest con
sist of a three-game match, to take
place at 11 a.m., November 20, 1937,

If any Stanford man be sufficiently
literate to write his name, he should
immediately communicate with the
undersigned:
