# WHAT, AGAIN?

The Editor, Sir:
In Monday's Daily R.T.T. criti
cized the "so-called" Committee for
Medical Aid to Spanish Democracy
for its program of last Tuesday in
the Paly Community Center. He
said, or she said, that it was poor
propaganda. The criticism is welL
pointed.
It was poor propaganda. The lady
who had just returned from Spain
was apparently a little too excited
about the arms and legs blown off
by the "devils" to make a stream
lined appeal to a sophisticated audi
ence.
In the future, the committee will
try to be more subtle.
In answer to the question of why
we are giving medical aid to one
side, we refer R.T.T. to an A.P. dis
patch on the front page of the San
Francisco Chronicle, October 31.
This article pointed out that of the

two groups formed for medical aid
to Spain, the Committee for the aid
to Spanish Democracy spent over
70 per cent of its money for actual
medical supplies, while the Fascist
group spent 100 per cent of its mon
ey for "administration and public
ity."
Reason why Franco's forces are
not needing medical supplies, and
concomitantly, the reason why this
committee is not collecting money
for them, is due to the fact that the
German and Italian troops bring
their own medical units with them
to Spain, providing adequate med
ical service to this side.
