certain that they preferred reds of the pinko-communist variety.
RED also predominated in the Pajamarino—a riot of color rather
than frosh this year. It was the first time Stanford men "dressed
for the theater.
" In the days of the 500, the ratio was 6 (men) to 1 (woman).
There's a new ratio now: 1 (lockout) to 3 (women). Evidently its
taking the present co-ed longer to get her man —or away from him!
Friday night it's the Soph Cotillion with the "real McCoy. ' If
the specification "semi-formal" has you stumped, we can help you
out. Whether it be shirt, tie, socks or suit, you will find just what
you want and be sure that it is RIGHT —if it bears the label —
