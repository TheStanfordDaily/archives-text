habits among students by Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, who explained
a number cf cases of rabies in Santa
Clara County had put all dogs un
der suspicion.
One woman student is under
treatment for a bite received off
campus and two cases in Los Altos
are being treated.
Due to the large number of dogs
on the campus and the "very gen
eral tendency among young people
to pet dogs," Dr. Storey feels the
condition here is equally danger
ous. Muzzles or leashes for all
campus dogs are recommended as a
precautionary measure by Dr. Stor
ey. When a person is bitten, imme
diate treatment of the wound and
isolation of the dog is the correct
procedure.
