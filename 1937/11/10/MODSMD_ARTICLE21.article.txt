## 
### 
A new era in the A.S.S.U.-spon
sored Concert Series programs will
be inaugurated at 8:15 o'clock to
night, for Ezio Pinza, noted basso
of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, will be the first concert art
ist to appear in the Memorial Hall.
Pinza's repertoire includes 30 op
eras, among which are "Samson and

Delilah," "Coq d'Or," "Carmen,"
"Mignon," "Faust," and "Aida."
His program for tonight shows
wide variation in which he offers se
lections from Mozart, Handel, Beet
hoven, Verdi, and others.
Mozart Opens Group
Pinza's first group will include
'Qui Sdegno Non S'Acenne" from
Mozart's "Magic Flute." A promi
nent part in the fantastic story of
"The Magic Flute" is taken by
Sarastro, High Priest of Isis. Tamino
and Pamina have sought initiation
into the temple rites. In this air,
Sarastro tells Pamina that "within
these sacred walls" and in their
brotherhood there are no thoughts
of enmity or vengefulness.
Also in this group are Handel's
"Alma Mia," "O soul of mine, thou
art alone my glory and delight"; "Tu
Lo Sai" by Torelli, "Well thou
knowest how much I love thee";
and Legrenzi's 'Che Fiero Costume,"
Arietta from "Etocli," the theme of
which is the devious ways of cupid
with the human heart.
Group Two
In group two are:
Beethoven's "In Questa Tomba
Oscura," in which the lover, de
serted, wishes that he might lie in
an unknown tomb. He cries out that
his lady who was false must leave
him in peace when he is dead. He
wishes to rest, and to be no more
remembered by her.
Other songs in this group are:
Monteverde's "Lasciatemi Morire,"
"Let death now come to claim me
from this torment"; and La Calun
nia" from Rossini's "Barber of
Seville."
Follow Intermission
After the intermission Pinza will
offer "Minnelied" by Walter Kra
mer, "The Cloths of Heaven" by
Dunhill, "Trouble" by Walter Mac-
Gimsey, and Oley Speaks' "Shep
herd, See Thy Horse's Foaming
Mane."
In his last group will be: "Fiocca
La Neve," by Cimara. An infant

lies in its cot, which is surrounded
by flowers, and the grandmother
sings a lullaby. Outside the snow
is falling softly.
Opera Selections
Also in this group are "Mephis
tophele's Serenade" from "Faust"
by Gounod; and Aria, "II Lacerato
Spirito," by Verdi from the opera,
"Simon Boccanegra," which comes
fairly late in the composer's long
list of stage works. Its date, 1857,
is some years after "Rigoletto," "II
Trovatore," and only two years be
fore "Aida."

her forgiveness and prayers from
beyond the grave.
