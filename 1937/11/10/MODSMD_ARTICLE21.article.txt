Mozart Opens Group
Pinza's first group will include
'Qui Sdegno Non S'Acenne" from
Mozart's "Magic Flute." A promi
nent part in the fantastic story of
"The Magic Flute" is taken by
Sarastro, High Priest of Isis. Tamino
and Pamina have sought initiation
into the temple rites. In this air,
Sarastro tells Pamina that "within
these sacred walls" and in their
brotherhood there are no thoughts
of enmity or vengefulness.
Also in this group are Handel's
"Alma Mia," "O soul of mine, thou
art alone my glory and delight"; "Tu
Lo Sai" by Torelli, "Well thou
knowest how much I love thee";
and Legrenzi's 'Che Fiero Costume,"
Arietta from "Etocli," the theme of
which is the devious ways of cupid
with the human heart.
Group Two
In group two are:
Beethoven's "In Questa Tomba
Oscura," in which the lover, de
serted, wishes that he might lie in
an unknown tomb. He cries out that
his lady who was false must leave
him in peace when he is dead. He
wishes to rest, and to be no more
remembered by her.
Other songs in this group are:
Monteverde's "Lasciatemi Morire,"
"Let death now come to claim me
from this torment"; and La Calun
nia" from Rossini's "Barber of
Seville."

offer "Minnelied" by Walter Kra
mer, "The Cloths of Heaven" by
Dunhill, "Trouble" by Walter Mac-
Gimsey, and Oley Speaks' "Shep
herd, See Thy Horse's Foaming
Mane."

La Neve," by Cimara. An infant
