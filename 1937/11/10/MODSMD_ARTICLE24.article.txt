# Black's Eligibility Challenged Again
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 9 (UP). â€”
Attorneys for a group of Florida se
curity brokers, whose attack on eli
gibility of Justice Hugo L. Black
was rejected yesterday by the Su
preme Court, today presented to the
tribunal a new challenge of Black.
The new petition said the court
apparently had overlooked a pre
vious charge that Justice Black's
presence on the bench made all the
court's actions illegal, since he par
ticipated in the court's rejection of
their first challenge.
