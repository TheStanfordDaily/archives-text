# Dr. Willis Speaks At Tuesday Series
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, in last evening's
lecture in Memorial Hall, described
his recent trip to the Dutch East
Indies, India, the Philippines, and
Japan and his experiences with these
"Friends across the Seas."
He contrasted India and little so
cialistic Bali with the remark that
"India is as typical of Hell as Bali is
of Paradise." India is a country of
superstition with such roads that
"motoring through it is an adven
ture no sane American would ever
attempt."
