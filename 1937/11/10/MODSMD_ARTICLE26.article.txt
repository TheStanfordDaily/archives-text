# Tired Excom Grants $125 For Jolly-up
## Debate Council Change Eliminates Women's Managerial Position 
### JIM STONE 
There were a lot of tired boys and
girls in Ex Committee meeting last
night. President Killefer huffed and
he puffed, but about all he could
get out of the sleepy-time gulls was
a few weak "ayes."
Only near-discussion attempt was
made in answer to the report of
Dave Ryus, junior class president,
that it would take $125 to put Griff
Williams in the Pavilion for the
pre-Big Game jolly-up.
New strictness of Musicians' Un
ion rates makes it impossible to
bring any other city "name" bands
down; only campus orchestras avail
able for lower prices will come with
out public address systems. Ex
Committee granted the necessary
$125 to bring Williams for the dance.
"PERSONAL PROBLEMS"
COURSE: Ex Committee discussed
the new course, tentatively set for
next quarter, on "Personal Prob
lems in Modern Society." Little was
added to the Student-Faculty Rela
tions Committee's Monday night dis
cussion on the plan as drawn up by
faculty members. It was generally
felt that the course might benefit if
sections were included as well as
lectures, that the schedule of lec
tures as planned would probably
answer student demand for such a
course.
DEBATE COUNCIL: The pro
posed change in the structure of the
Debate Council to eliminate the po
sition of Women's Manager was ap
proved by Ex Committee. Chief
reason for the change was that the
combination of the men's and wom
en's squads now brings all manage
rial duties under the jurisdiction of
the Debate Manager and assistants.
BY-LAWS CHANGE: Article 11,
Section 1, of the constitutional by
laws was changed to allow the show
ing of Sunday night movies in Me
morial Hall. Motion pictures spon
sored by the A.S.S.U. are now added
to the functions excepted from the
rule that only Friday and Saturday
nights are open for social or dra
matic functions.
APPOINTMENTS: Audis Davis,
Hap Dey, and Gordon Nicholl were
appointed to the Student-Faculty
Relations Committee. Appointments
to the Bulletin Board Committee
were: Audis Davis, Florence Alden,
Janet Scott, and Mildred Brown.
DATES GRANTED: Sigma Delta
Chi was awarded the winter quarter
REG DANCE over the Y.W.C.A. bid.
Due to the fact that the Debate
Council was granted the date of No
vember 18 for a debate, final grant
ing of Rally Committee's bid for the
Big Game rally and bonfire on that
night was shunted off to next meet
ing for final consideration.
