SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Nov. 10
(U.R).—Chinese "doomed battalions,"
estimated at from 5,000 to 20.000 men,
held strong positions near the French
Concession today and defied a Japa
nese army of 100,000.
The Japanese were completing an
encirclement of the Chinese troops.
There was the wildest confusion in
the districts southwest of the foreign
areas of Shanghai as the bulk of the
Chinese forces retreated. Scores of
fires burned—Set by Chinese who
were routed yesterday in the second
phase of the great battle which has
raged around this international city
for three months.

Foreign military attaches said the
Chinese left around the city were
doomed but might be in a position to
sell their lives dearly and set an ex
ample similar to that of the "dare
to-die battalions" which held two
Chapei warehouses for days against
overwhelming Japanese odds.
