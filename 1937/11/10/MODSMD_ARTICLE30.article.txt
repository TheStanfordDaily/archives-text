# Farm Players Will Present French Satire
## Moliere Comedy Set For Four Showings In Memorial Hall 
### 
The man who married more wom
en than he could remember, and
who paid for it by literally going to
hell, is the central figure of Mo
liere's "Don Juan," which will be
presented in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall tomorrow, Friday,
Saturday, and Monday evenings.
The great French comedy writer
changed the old moral legend into a
ribald farce full of brilliant satire
and lusty comedy. The five-act play
opens with Don Juan deserting
Donna Elvira, a girl that he has
lured out of a convent.
He and his crafty lackey, Sgana
rellee, are nearly shipwrecked, and
when they land the Don woos two
peasant girls at once. But he is
forced to leave them when he learns
that Elvira's brothers are planning
to kill him.
Don Juan Disguises
Don Juan disguises as a physi
cian and being a true gallant, saves
the life of one of Donna Elvira's
brothers. He banquets with the
ghost of the fair lady's father, whom
he has previously killed in a duel.
Dismayed by Don Juan's contin
ual bigamy, faithlessness, and irre
sponsibility, his friends, l'elatives,
and lovers beg him to reform. He
plays the hypocrite and agrees but
does not mend his ways. Finally the
Don's dissolute life ends, and he is
called to pay the price in hell.
Climax at End
The play ends with Sganarelle, his
lackey, peering into the flaming
abyss and beating with his fists at
the portals of hell as he shrieks
after his vanishing master, "My
wages, my wages, my wages!"

the portals of hell as he shrieks
after his vanishing master, "My
wages, my wages, my wages!"
