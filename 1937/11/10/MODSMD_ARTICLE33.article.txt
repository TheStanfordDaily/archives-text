# English Visitor Urges Exchange Scholarship
## 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Judging by the Honorable Mrs.
Christopher Fremantle, who was at
Stanford yesterday as a represen
tative of the English Speaking Un
ion, English women are a versatile
lot.
Mrs. Freeman tie has managed,
since her graduation from Oxford
in 1931, to squeeze into her busy life
a husband, two children, four books,
innumerable committees, and a par
liamentary campaign.
Mrs. Fremantle is trying to ar
range an exchange scholarship in
modern history between Stanford
and an English university — "the
Rusisan Revolution and all that."
She is a first class booster of Anglo-
American exchanges. "A year as an
exchange student," says Mrs. Fre
manlte, "is an education in itself."
"Here I Am"
"Would you like to know how I
happened to come to America?" the
attractive young Englishwoman
asked—Mrs. Fremantle is a refuta
tion of the idea that all English
women wear antediluvian tweeds
and are impossibly dowdy. "Well, I
bought a Cezanne for $45, only I
didn't know it was a Cezanne. One
day I picked up a catalogue and there
it was listed, number 230, so I
walked into a shop and sold it for
$1750, right over the counter, and
here I am.
"I was coming to the United
States when I graduated from Ox
ford," Mrs. Fremantle said, "but
then I got married. The steamship
company was awfully nice—they de
cided marriage was an Act of God
and gave me back my $50 deposit."
Labor Candidate
Mrs. Fremantle is the daughter of
Rt. Hon. Hugh Jackson, former
Privy Councillor and governor of

the Bank of England. In 1935 she
stood as Labor Candidate for Par
liament against Alfred Duff Cooper,
present First Lord of the Admiral
ty, and lost by a narrow margin.
At Stanford Mrs. Fremantle was
the guest of' Lagunita Court for
lunch. Yesterday afternoon, before
leaving for Denver, she spoke at the
meeting of the San Francisco branch
of the English Speaking Union.
Versatile Author
The 27-year-old Englishwoman
is the author of three books: a small
volume of poetry: "We always start
out with that in England," and two
biographies, one of George Eliot. At
present she is working on a biogra
phy of Marmaduke Pixell, the T. E.
Lawrence of Turkey during the
World War.
"It is perfectly ghastly," she said
about her last book. "Here I have it
already in proof, and now I've found
everything that should be in it in
your Hoover War Library. It will
have footnotes and footnotes."
Asked if she was anxious about
her two sons, aged three years and
16 months, Mrs. Fremantle said no,
she had left them with her mother
and husband, "and besides, I'm
having a perfectly marvelous time,
traveling around by myself."

"Here I Am"
"Would you like to know how I
happened to come to America?" the
attractive young Englishwoman
asked—Mrs. Fremantle is a refuta
tion of the idea that all English
women wear antediluvian tweeds
and are impossibly dowdy. "Well, I
bought a Cezanne for $45, only I
didn't know it was a Cezanne. One
day I picked up a catalogue and there
it was listed, number 230, so I
walked into a shop and sold it for
$1750, right over the counter, and
here I am.
"I was coming to the United
States when I graduated from Ox
ford," Mrs. Fremantle said, "but
then I got married. The steamship
company was awfully nice—they de
cided marriage was an Act of God
and gave me back my $50 deposit."
Labor Candidate
Mrs. Fremantle is the daughter of
Rt. Hon. Hugh Jackson, former
Privy Councillor and governor of

the Bank of England. In 1935 she
stood as Labor Candidate for Par
liament against Alfred Duff Cooper,
present First Lord of the Admiral
ty, and lost by a narrow margin.
At Stanford Mrs. Fremantle was
the guest of' Lagunita Court for
lunch. Yesterday afternoon, before
leaving for Denver, she spoke at the
meeting of the San Francisco branch
of the English Speaking Union.
Versatile Author
The 27-year-old Englishwoman
is the author of three books: a small
volume of poetry: "We always start
out with that in England," and two
biographies, one of George Eliot. At
present she is working on a biogra
phy of Marmaduke Pixell, the T. E.
Lawrence of Turkey during the
World War.
"It is perfectly ghastly," she said
about her last book. "Here I have it
already in proof, and now I've found
everything that should be in it in
your Hoover War Library. It will
have footnotes and footnotes."
Asked if she was anxious about
her two sons, aged three years and
16 months, Mrs. Fremantle said no,
she had left them with her mother
and husband, "and besides, I'm
having a perfectly marvelous time,
traveling around by myself."
The Abraham Lincoln national
monument, near Hodgenville, Ky.,
contains the log cabin and part of
the farm where Lincoln was born.
Judging by the Honorable Mrs.
Christopher Fremantle, who was at
Stanford yesterday as a represen
tative of the English Speaking Un
ion, English women are a versatile
lot.
Mrs. Freeman tie has managed,
since her graduation from Oxford
in 1931, to squeeze into her busy life
a husband, two children, four books,
innumerable committees, and a par
liamentary campaign.
Mrs. Fremantle is trying to ar
range an exchange scholarship in
modern history between Stanford
and an English university — "the
Rusisan Revolution and all that."
She is a first class booster of Anglo-
American exchanges. "A year as an
exchange student," says Mrs. Fre
manlte, "is an education in itself."
