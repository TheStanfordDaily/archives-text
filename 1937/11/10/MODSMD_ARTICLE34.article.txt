# Transformers To Distribute Farm's Power
## Campus Improvements, Lighting Standards Necessitate Change 
### RUTH DYNES 
Stanford's march of progress had j
the student body collectively leap
ing ditches last week. New power I
lines are making a subterranean j
network under campus buildings.
Because of increased demand on j
its Paly substation, the Pacific Gas !
and Electric Company has installed j
a transformer in the Corporation
Yard, designed to take care of cam- J
pus needs. Although the university
has its own substation, it buys pow
er from the P. G. & E. to cover peak
loads. i
Now Supply ing Paly
This load was taken care of by !
the Paly station until it began sup
plying the city of Palo Alto, which j
recently shut down its own plant,
finding it cheaper to buy from the
company.
A transformer will step down the
1100 volts carried by power lines
from Redwood, to 4000 volts. The j
electricity is needed not only to take
over the extra demand caused by
dark days, "but by increased univer
sity equipment.
Explains New Needs
Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller, explained that such
improvements as air-conditioning in 1
the new Graduate School of Busi
ness and Memorial Theater, and
higher lighting standards have add
ed to the electricity that must be |
supplied.
Transformers also are being in- 1
stalled in the power loop which.
serves the Inner Quad, behind the j
education buildings, which will be j
connected to the new station. Later, j
transformers will be built in behind
the Cubberly Building, which will !
be University property.
