FLYING SHOULD BE
A MINOR SPORT
Thirty air-minded Stanford stu
dents have spent over a year now
trying to interest students and Uni
versity officials in flying as a minor
sport.
At their own expense they have
traveled long distances to enter in
tercollegiate contests, and as repre
sentatives of Stanford, they have
won considerable acclaim as the
outstanding group of student flyers
in the United States.
Three local birdmen took to the
air in Detroit, summer before last,
and when they returned, they an
nounced to the folks back 011 the
Farm that Stanford University had
won the National Intercollegiate
Air Championship.
John Park was individual high
point man in that 1936 meet. He had
become intercollegiate air champ of
the country.
Representatives of the newly-or
ganized Flying Club went to New
York last summer to defend the
championship they had won the pre
vious year. Again they left the field
victorious, but lost the crown through
a reversed decision after the meet.
And the Flying Club, approved
as a club by the A.S.S.U. but not
recognized by the Board of Ath
letic Control, continues, at its own
expense and through its own de
termination to compete against
highly organized air teams of other
colleges, to defeat them decisively,
and to enhance the name of the
University that refuses them ath
letic recognition.
The flyers, led by President Bob
Townsend, spent lust week-end in
Los Angeles, and garnered a 60-36
victory over University of Southern
California airmen.
Next Sunday afternoon the Oak
land Airport will be the scene of the
first Big Meet in the air. The Stan
ford squad will fly competitively
against the "University of California.
Although the sport is only one
month old in Berkeley, 80 students
already have turned out for the Blue
and Gold air team.
Three interesting and fascinating
contests are included in an air meet.
In the Speed-and-Drift contest, flyers
drop paper bags full of flour at a
target on the field.
In the Spot-Landing match, flyers
try to land just beyond a line across
the field. Balloon-Popping is the
third contest, in which the airmen
release balloons from their planes
and then pop them by diving toward
the balloons as targets.
Purdue University has pro
gressed beyond all other colleges
in air activities. The University
owns its own field and planes, and
gives regular courses in flying.
Connected with this department,
Amelia Earhart was a member of
the Purdue Faculty before her
tragic around-the-world attempt
last summer.
Greatest hindrances to flying at
Stanford are lack of spectator inter
est and lack of paying fans. Also the
expense of renting planes is high, and
the problem of sky accidents, which
are so scarce that flyers consider
them a controllable danger, seems to
be the greatest worry to Dr. Storey,
director of physical education at
Stanford.
The hope of Stanford aviators is
to overcome the lack of spectator
interest by their fine record and
fascinating competitive maneuvers,
and to prove to the B.A.C. that the
questionable dangers of flying would
be the worry of the flyers and not
of the University.
