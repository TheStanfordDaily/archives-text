# Indians Still Show Spirit of U. S. C. Game
## Card Eleven Holds Punt, Block Drill Willard, Dakan, McMillan Out of Cougar Tilt; Fay Back Today 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Los Angeles sport reporters wrote
a lot of stuff last week about how
Stanford beat U.S.C. just because
the Indians had a surplus of spirit,
not because they had a godo football
team.
Tiny Thornhill's boys are showing
that same spirit these nights out on
the varsity field. They want to see
what the southern scribes -vill have
to say about spirit this week.
Hold Punt Drill
ThornhiU put them through the
closest thing they'll have to a scrim
mage this week when he gave them
an intensive kicking workout. Bill
Paulman and A1 Alustiza were boot
ing them, the first string was trying
to block and the second string was
rushing in.
Then a brisk two hours of running
through signals finished off yester
day's practice. They'll go through
something of the same sort today.
Three Are Out
Bill Willard, Bob Dakan, and
Frank McMillan are all definitely
out of the Washington tSate game
Saturday. The first two have chest
injuries and McMillan is out with a
knee injury which X-rays showed
to be severe.
Pete Fay missed practice again
yesterday because of his cold, but
he will pull on the shoulder pads
today, as will Chet Patton, who has
been in the hospital with a throat
infection.
Neil Rasmussen is taking Willard's
job at left end. He has recovered
from his ankle injury and is in the
best shape this season.
