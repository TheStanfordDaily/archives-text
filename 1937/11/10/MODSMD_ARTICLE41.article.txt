# Water Polo Men Out for Honors
## 
### 
At least three Stanford water polo |
men will be out gunning for All- :
Coast recognition in games with San
Jose State and U.C.LA. this week- I
end.
Johnny Lamb, Card forward, j
should be a repeater on the mythi- j
cal team. Lamb's work in the front j
line has been more brilliant than
any seen on the Coast so far this
year.
Bill Burns at goal proved the sur- j
prise of the southern invasion and
completely outplayed Walt Woods,
the Bruins' second team All-Coast
choice last year. Captain Bill Han
na. despite the fact that he has been '
shifted from forward to guard, seems j
at home wherever he plays and al
ways sparks the Indian offense.
