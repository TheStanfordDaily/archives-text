# Farm Poloists To Play Today
## Positions Re-Shuffled For San Jose Game 
### 
Card horsemen meet the San Jose
Polo Club in a return match this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on the
highway polo field.
The Indians took the first game,
11-2, but the Garden City bunch
still was in pre-season shape and
will be harder to beat today.
New Arrangement
Captain Haydon Grubb's Farm
team will feature a new arrange
ment of positions. Don Ansland will
start as No. 1, Steve Downey at No.
2, team Captain Jim Fullerton at
No. 3, and Bob Wallace at No. 4.
Grubbs hopes this shift in positions
will strengthen the Card team
enough to present the best possible
combination against the University
of Arizona during Thanksgiving va
cationâ€”the big game for polo.
San Jose Line-up
The San Jose Polo Club's starting
line-up probably will consist of
Cecil Langdon, No. 1; Dr. K. M.
Anderson, captain, No. 2; Pat Lin
foot. No. 3; and Rusty Rufus, No. 4.
Mr. Linfoot played last year on the
powerful Castro Valley team and
this will be his first game with the
Garden City squad.
This Friday here on the Highway
Field the Indians will meet the San
Mateo Polo Club in their fourth re
turn match. Tho Peninsula Club is
now one up on the Cards, having
beaten them two out of three.
No fossil remains of chimpanzees,
orang-outangs, or gorillas have ever
been found.
