# Soccer Team Set for S.J. Match Today
## Spartan Game Shifted To Stanford Field; Cal Battle Saturday 
### 
Stanford's conference soccer game
with San Jose State this afternoon,
originally scheduled to be played at
San Jose, has been shifted to the
Indian field, Coach Harry Maloney
said yesterday.
The contest will unveil Stanford's
most crucial week of soccer compe
tition this season. If the Cardinals
repeat their previous 1-0 victory
over the Spartans, they will move
back into a second place tie with
the U.S.F. Dons, and will be in a
position to challenge California for
first place.
Cal Game Saturday
The Bears and Indians clash Sat
urday for the first time this year,
and a victory for Maloney's boys
would put them in a tie for confer
ence leadership with the Gold and
Blue.
The squad was reported in full
strength at the beginning of the
week, and Maloney expects hitmen
to reach top form for the crucial
game with California.
Edwards, Hamilton Return
Bill Edwards and Bill Hamilton
returned to their regular fullback
berths, but Dick Hanna will get the
starting call over Hamilton. Ken
Cuthberson, who substituted for
Edwards, has been shifted to a half
back with the return of Edwards to
the lineup.
Otherwise the lineup remains in
tact and reads as follows: Faulb,
goafie; Hatch, halfback; Sloane, half
back; Arrasmith, outside right;
Schaupp, inside right; Sadullah, cen
ter forward; de Benedetti, inside left;
Parker, outside left.
