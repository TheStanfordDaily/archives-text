## Clothed for the Opening 
### 
FOR years both Stanford's fervent music lov
ers and Stanford's temperate culture enthu
siasts have deplored the fact that the world s
best musicians and singers who came to the
University were forced to perform in a Pavilion
that resembled a draped barn.
Tonight seventeen hundred former lamenters
will throng into the Memorial Hall, settle
back in its comfortable red plush seats, and
listen to a celebrated artist sing in appropriately
artistic surroundings for the first time in Concert
Series' history.
Since the inception of the Stanford Concert
Series, its performers have been uniformly ex
cellent; its provisional concert hall, niggardly.
Obviously a new era in University concerts
will begin tonight with the use of an adequate
concert hall in which Stanford will not be
ashamed to receive the tops of the musical pro
fession.
Along with the opening of a new building for
concerts has come the recommendation that
students "dress to fit the occasion" —out of cour
tesy to an artist like Pinza, out of respect for the
attractive Memorial Hall.
A number of University concert style reform
ers have advocated strictly formal dress for all
concerts. But Stanford's traditional informality
seems to urge against women's wearing formal
dresses and men's wearing tuxedos on the

campus on a week-night—fashionable concert
garb notwithstanding.
The man who wants to study in the library
until concert time does not relish the idea of
gracing the reserve book room with a tux. The
woman who does not own a car objects to wear
ing her new or old formal on the streets be
tween Roble and Memorial Hall at night, espe
cially in rainy winter quarter when three-fourths
of the concerts are given.
In the old dress-unconscious Pavilion a few
of the audience wore formal clothes—but an
equal number dressed in Quad-wear with sweat
ers and skirts, even occasional cords or mole
skins.
General opinion seems rightly to have de
cided that such extremely informal campus ap
parel is out of tone with the new theater; but
the objections to strictly formal wear are still
sustained.
Until formal-advocates win over more sup
porters, the Stanford fashion sheet which does
not exist will advocate silk street dresses and
hats as probably the most appropriate wear for
women at concerts, while dark suits are style
for men.
Which means that Stanford for the present
will still cling to its semi-formality. But styles
of dress can be expected to eventually change
as well as concert halls.—M. L., Women's Editor
