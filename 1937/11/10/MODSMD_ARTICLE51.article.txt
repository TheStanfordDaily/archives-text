# Cure for Mural Claustrophobia

IN the bottom of a desk drawer somewhere in
the Physical Education building, should lie
the blueprints for an intramural wing on the
men's gymnasium. At least the idea had gotten
to a rather definite stage a few years ago,
though plans may never have been drawn. But
that was back in the pre-depression days, be
fore the need arose to divert athletic money
for the construction of Branner Hall. The new
wing, and the handball and sguash courts it
was planned to house, remained merely a
dream.
In those days, intramural might conceivably
have needed the shot in the arm that a new
building would give. Now a different treatment
is indicated for a new sort of ailment —growing
pains.
In four years intramural has more than
doubled in number of participants, has out
grown the available playing fields.
A plan that Intramural Director Harry Wolter
submitted to the Board of Athletic Control last
week is just what the doctor would order in
such a situation. He asks that a separate play

ing field for intramural be constructed out by
the stadium. Cost for laying out and grading
such a field would be $1250.
Tomorrow when the Board meets, this plan
will come up for consideration. Considering
that $1250 is little more than one dollar for every
man concerned in the sport, the Board could go
a long way and fail to find a cheaper cure.—L. L.
