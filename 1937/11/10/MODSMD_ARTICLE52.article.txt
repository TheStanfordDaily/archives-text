REPORTS which catapult out from the University
of California indicate that the boys there are
working up a nasty case of high blood pressure over
the question of peace. From an assorted g °
charges and counter-charges, I gather that a militant
peace committee has tangled with a cautious Execu
tive Committee. It also appears that the resulting
street-fight has embroiled such innocent bystanders
as the labor question, compulsory R.0.T.C., and the
rights of minorities.
The official peace meeting scheduled for Armistice
Day was cancelled, supposedly because Harry Bridges
was to be the speaker. The peace committee is throw
ing its weight about and snarling into its beaid. The
A.S.U. has arranged for Bridges to speak off campus,
and if Executive Committee doesn't like it, it knows
what it can do. The A.S.U. has also done a bit of
striking while iron heels are hot under the collar and
has called for a strike against R.O.T.C.
* # * »
It is hard to draw any conclusions about the situa
tion. Flying initials fill the air, and the smoke of
scorching epithets obscures vision. But one fact stands
out very clearly. When a militant peace committee
tries to solve most of the world's problems in one cam
paign the time is not ripe for disbanding the riot
squad.
The whole affair illustrates nicely the troubles that
rise when soldiers of peace march forth with more
determination than tact. It also illustrates one of the
main reasons why pacifistic movements so often blow
up before they get out of their own backyard. Every
emotional campaign has wound up in a welter of
petty fights, with groups and sub-groups ignoring their
avowed objective in order to snipe at each other,
i* » * »
IF the problem of peace were one that could be
solved by a determined and passionate crusade,
it would have been settled long ago. Unfortunately
it is not. Every passionate crusader has overlooked
the obvious fact that people are not made peaceful
when they are made angry. Our campaigns have been
nobly inspired. But they have been handled with an
appalling lack of diplomacy. And they have tried to
cover so many problems that minor quarrels have
been enough to tear them to pieces.
If the California committee had been content to
make a small beginning, if it had not demanded a per
sonal appearance by the Angel of Peace, it might
have met with more success. If the committee had con
fined itself to the immediate problem and had not con
sidered itself capable of settling the labor problem at
the same time, it might have avoided a mutilating
fißht. If it had approached the situation with friendly
tact instead of ruthless righteousness, it might have
found more sympathy.
* * * *
As it is, the committee and the A.S.U. have done
nothing but add to our surplus of feuds and bitter
ness. Their heaven-inspired crusade has degenerated
into guerilla warfare.
Until our sponsors of peace realize that peace de
pends on a state of mind which is not obtained by
infuriating everybody in sight, they stand very little
chance of success. In the meantime, there is no hurry

rise when soldiers of peace march forth with more

IF the problem of peace were one that could be
solved by a determined and passionate crusade,
it would have been settled long ago. Unfortunately
it is not. Every passionate crusader has overlooked
the obvious fact that people are not made peaceful
when they are made angry. Our campaigns have been
nobly inspired. But they have been handled with an
appalling lack of diplomacy. And they have tried to
cover so many problems that minor quarrels have
been enough to tear them to pieces.
If the California committee had been content to
make a small beginning, if it had not demanded a per
sonal appearance by the Angel of Peace, it might
have met with more success. If the committee had con
fined itself to the immediate problem and had not con
sidered itself capable of settling the labor problem at
the same time, it might have avoided a mutilating
fißht. If it had approached the situation with friendly
tact instead of ruthless righteousness, it might have
found more sympathy.

As it is, the committee and the A.S.U. have done
nothing but add to our surplus of feuds and bitter
ness. Their heaven-inspired crusade has degenerated
into guerilla warfare.

pends on a state of mind which is not obtained by
infuriating everybody in sight, they stand very little

REPORTS which catapult out from the University
of California indicate that the boys there are
working up a nasty case of high blood pressure over
the question of peace. From an assorted g °
charges and counter-charges, I gather that a militant
peace committee has tangled with a cautious Execu
tive Committee. It also appears that the resulting
street-fight has embroiled such innocent bystanders
as the labor question, compulsory R.0.T.C., and the
rights of minorities.
The official peace meeting scheduled for Armistice
Day was cancelled, supposedly because Harry Bridges
was to be the speaker. The peace committee is throw
