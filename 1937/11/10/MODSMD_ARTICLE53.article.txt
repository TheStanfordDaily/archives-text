YOU didn't think that Sequoia Hall had a custodian
did you? Well, it has. Just why Sequoia should
have a custodian, or what there is left in Sequoia
to custode is not at present known to the world of
science. But surveys and investigations have proved
beyond doubt or dispute that Sequoia Hall has a
custodian.
The gentleman who occupies this untenable posi
tion maintains it is a tough job. He says it isn't
any custodian pie comedy. His duties, events have
proved, are mostly seismographic in nature. Since
the University has built a better fire trap than Encina
it is the custodian's duty to make note of all the times
that the boys beat a better rat-a-tat race on the
various doors.
You would think that this sort of thing might keep
a man rather busy, but this is not so at all. Because
under the cover of daylight, the custodian sneaks out
of the hall and becomes junior custodian in charge of
V. P.'s book house for young ladies and gentlemen.
Here his duties as custodian are principally seismo
grophic in nature. He records, at stated intervals, the
rate, density, immensity, and intensity of the activi
ties of Mr. V. P.'s guests in hitting the books.
This is all very fine up to a certain point. This
point was reached one Saturday afternoon not long
ago.
As the double-dyed custodian stood at the book
bar with his call slips showing, he noticed a little
brunette Lagunitan making out a pink one.
"What do you want to take out tonight?" he asked,
looking into her azure orbs. Then he blushed as he
glanced down at the pink one and saw the name of
the triple-dyed custodian.
"I want to take that out tonight," she said, and
she did.
Rehasher frankly admits that this doesn't prove
anything except that someone besides God takes
custodians into custody, although the age-old question
of "Who takes care of the care-taker's daughter when
the care-taker's daughter ceases to take care?" is
still unsolved.
