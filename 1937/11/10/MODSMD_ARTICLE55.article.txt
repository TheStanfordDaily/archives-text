# Bromfield Hits High Spot in Latest Novel
## 
### 
Sometimes Louis Bromfield tells a
story, as he did in "The Strange
Case of Miss Annie Spragg"; some
times he writes a good book, as he
did in "The Farm."
Most of the time he wastes his
energy and the reader's time in try
ing to find the philosopher's stone
whereby he can combine good story

and good book and
come out with
something really
worth while. It is
pleasing to an
nounce that with
the publication
of "The Rains
Came" (at the
Stanford Book
store), he has fi
nally succeeded.

Ranchipur, most modern and
best-governed of the semi-independ
ent states of India, fox-ms the back
ground for this story of physical and
spiritual adventure. Against a can
vas dominated by the slowly awak
ening spirit of the country, 'Mr.
Bromfield tells what happened to
the residents of Ranchipur when
the rains came and the floods de
scended and nine thousand people
were swept away to death on the
muddy tide of the Ranchipur River.
Each one of Mr. Bromfield's char
acters is a triumph of delineation.
From the magnificent old Maharani,
victorious at last over the British
imperialism she has hated all her
life, to the indomitable Miss Dirks,
representing the finest things in the
British spirit, each is as clear and
distinct as a portrait by Thomas
Benton.
Characters Well Played
Somehow Mr. Bromfield's disillu
sioned characters — the romantic
Hon. Thomas Ransome, and the un
happy Lady Edwina Esketh — are
not as annoying as disillusioned
characters usually are in present
day novels.
Somehow his nice characters —
Aunt Phoebe, the Smileys, Fern
Simon —are just a little nicer and
more human than is customary to
nice characters. Somehow his whole
book manages to be just a little more
exciting and heart-warming and
satisfying than most which have
come The Daily's way of late.
Reveals 'Stirring'
Moreover, what Mr. Bromfield
conveys, better than any scientific
work of investigation, is the vast
undercover stirring of the new day
in India—a stirring which in many
nonetheless the most promising
who are a part of it, but which is
nonetheless the msot promising
hope Asia holds out to the future.
Mr. Bromfield loves India, and he
knows how to create vivid charac
ters. "The Rains Came" is a four
star book, according to any stand
ards.
