"Don Juan" will establish a prece
dent in Stanford dramatics when
it opens a four-night run at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Little Theater. For
the first time a play will be given
an extended run on the campus.
Chief purpose of the repeat per
formances, according to Thomas
Wood Stevens, the director, is to give
dramatics students an opportunity
Ito get the experience of routine
stock performances rather than the
usual hectic one-night production.
Plan Several Plays
Present plans of the Department
of Speech and Drama provide for
presenting several plays each quar
ter in the Little Theater for a run
of from four nights to a week each.
Many students have found it im
possible to attend campus plays
heretofore because of conflicting ac
tivities. Under the new plan they
will have more opportunities to see
these productions. If student inter
est in dramatics is sufficiently in
creased by the extended run of "Don
Juan" and '"The Trojan Women"
later this month, the campus may
see a play every other week next
quarter.
Tickets Go on Sale
Tickets for tonight's performance
of the Moliere farce will be on sale
; at the door at 40 cents apiece and
| are available in advance in Room
j 202, Memorial Hall for tonight, to
morrow, Saturday, and Monday.
"Don Juan" will be given a com
plete production; advantage will be
j taken of the fine technical equip
ment of the Little Theater. Walde
j mar Johansen has designed five sets
j for the play and Mi*s. Helen Green
| has designed the costumes.
Not an Experiment
"Every effort has been made to
! make 'Don Juan' as polished a pro
j duction as the regular quarterly
; plays. It is not merely an experi
mental production," stated Director
Stevens yesterday.
The Little Theater was selected
for the scene of "Don Juan" not only
to provide for four separate audi
ences, but because the intimate com
edy of the farce is well suited to
presentation in a small auditorium.

The Little Theater was selected
for the scene of "Don Juan" not only
to provide for four separate audi
ences, but because the intimate com

presentation in a small auditorium.

"Don Juan" will establish a prece
dent in Stanford dramatics when
it opens a four-night run at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Little Theater. For
the first time a play will be given
an extended run on the campus.
Chief purpose of the repeat per
formances, according to Thomas
Wood Stevens, the director, is to give
dramatics students an opportunity
Ito get the experience of routine
stock performances rather than the
usual hectic one-night production.
Plan Several Plays
Present plans of the Department
of Speech and Drama provide for
presenting several plays each quar
ter in the Little Theater for a run
of from four nights to a week each.
Many students have found it im
possible to attend campus plays
heretofore because of conflicting ac
tivities. Under the new plan they
will have more opportunities to see
these productions. If student inter
est in dramatics is sufficiently in
creased by the extended run of "Don
Juan" and '"The Trojan Women"
later this month, the campus may
see a play every other week next
quarter.
