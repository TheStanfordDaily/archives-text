PARIS, Nov. 10 (UP). —A Chi
nese Embassy spokesman told the
United Press tonight that "we have
received reliable reports from un
official sources in Europe that Soviet
Russia probably will agree soon to
recognize Chinese sovereignty over
outer Mongolia."
The move, he believed, would have
important repercussions on the
Chinese - Japanese war in that it
might lead to use of the Soviet
trained and equipped outer Mongol
armies against the Japanese forces
holding North China.
