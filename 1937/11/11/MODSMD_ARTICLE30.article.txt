# "Be Careful Of This, It's Touchy"-Pow!

Hell or something popped in Dr.
Krauskopf's physical science class
yesterday as a piece of sodium in a
beaker of water exceeded all ex
pectations, rending the air with a
violent explosion, flying water, and
a lot of feminine shrieks from the
first row.
The Doctor, after having warned
the class of sodium's touchy nature,
sneaked up on it as it sizzled around
the beaker, and applied the fatal
match. The result which lent an
olf-season touch of Fourth of July,
and moistened well those who had
gathered close, broke one perfectly
good beaker all to pot, and caused
both masculine and feminine ele
ments to jump every time a match
was lighted during the rest of the
lecture.
Dr. Krauskopf made a strong bid
for f&me in "Famous Last Words,"
when he soberly remarked after the
disaster, "That's what happens when
you use too much sodium!"
