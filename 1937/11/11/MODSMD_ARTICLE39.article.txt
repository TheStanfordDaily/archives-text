# NOVICES WILL FILL VARSITY VACANCIES
## 
### 
Novice matches will be especially
.significant this year, because there
•.re plenty of vmsity spots to be
tilled, particu'ai ty in the heavy
weight class. The novices always
have plenty of willingness to
a hard battle even though they lack
skill.
Proceeds taken in by the Circlo
S Socicty will go toward a schol
arship for a minor sports man.
'J'heic are 13 aJi'.nni donations for
major sportsmen, but this will be
the first for a minor athlete.
The boys will be out there to give
us a real treat tonight. Let's re
member that each one is in there
on his own, and is worthy of all the
cc-operation we can give him.
