# Pinza Wins Acclamation From Capacity Audience
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
With a program exhibiting the maximum in virtuosity and the min
imum in length, opera's Ezio Pinza proved to a jampackcd Memorial
Ilall last night that he fully deserves his international reputation.
The first group of numbers, beginning with "Aui Sdegno non
S'Ecennde" from Mozart's "Magic Flute" received polite approval from

singer was getting under way and'
not yet in full voice. By the time
Mr. Pinza had concluded "Che Fiero
Costume" by Legrenzi, however,
politeness had turned to whole
hearted acceptance, and for the rest
of the evening Stanford enjoyed a
concert which augurs well for this
year's Concert Series.
Four English Songs
Following intermission, Mr. Pinza
sang a group of four songs in Eng
lish, most effective of which was
"Trouble" by Robert MacGimsey.
For encore he sang the ever-popular
"Deep River," a rendition which
was somehow not quite as pleasing
as it should have been.
Most popular number of the fourth
and concluding group was "Mephis
topheles' Serenade" from "Faust,"
which was delivered with all the
flawless technique and dramatic
personality opera-goers have come
to expect from the singer.
Program Short
Definitely an improvement over
former Concert Series artists who
have sometimes been embarrassingly
prodigal with their gifts, Mr. Pinza
kept his program short and to the
point. It didn't pall, and it left the
audience wanting more. The for
mula was infallible, the quality ex
cellent, and Mr. Pinza's appearance
definitely a success.
Notable was the absence from Me
morial Hall of the slacks-and
sweaters which the Farm once con
sidered fit wear for Concert Series.
The splendor of the Hall seemed to
have a perceptible effect on the dress
of the audience; and one suspects
that before very long, willy-nilly,
Concert Series is going to become
an Event.
