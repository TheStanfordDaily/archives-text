# Soccermen Climb Into Second Place
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY SPORTS Tiny Orders Tough Session For Gridders Paulman in First String Quarter Spot; Ends Hold Own Workout 
### 
It got pretty dark out on the var
sity field yesterday afternoon and it
tried to rain, but that didn't stop
Tiny Thornhill and his boys from
holding their toughest practice of
the week.
In spite of the fact that Thornhill
said he wouldn't be putting his team
through scrimmage this week, that's
just what he did. - '
Paulman First String
Bill Paulman, in condition to play
for his second consecutive week, was
in his first string quarter spot last
night. People have been saying this
before nearly every game this year,
but this should be his week to show!
What's more, judging from last
night's scrimmage, he'll be in there
carrying the ball against Washing
ton State Saturday.
The ends had a little private work
out of their own yesterday before
the BIG scrimmage started. Jim
Lawson had them sharpening up
their blocking on the tackle dum
mies. Because the boys from up
north will be running many of their
plays from kick formation Satur
day, it's going to be a tough after
noon for the men on the flanks.
Starting Backfield
Thornhill will have most of the
same men starting the game for
Stanford as he has had all season.
Jim (Hey! Hey!) Groves will be at
full, Bill Paulman at quarter, Fred
Ledeboer and Jimmy Coffis at
halves.
Captain Grant Stone will start at
right end, wtih Neil Rasmussen at
the other flank. Tackles will be
Pete Zagar and Stan Anderson. Jack
Walton and Bob Matthews will start
at guards, with Tony Calvelli at
center.
For the first time this week Pete
Fay was out in his football panties
carrying the ball for the boys. Chet
Patton, who, like F'ay, has been in
the hospital with throat infection,
was in suit, too. *
