Two teams are all that remain of
the original field of 52 intramural
grid aggregations that started out
the season in quest of the Univer
sity championship. The defending
champion Phi Delts and Delta Chi
won their semi-final round play-off
games yesterday to enter the finals,
which are to be contested Friday at
4:15 o'clock on the Sunken Diamond.
The thriller of the day was Delta
Chi's 13-7 victory over Kappa Sig
ma. Delta Chi scored first on a 35-
yard pass play from Captain Sulli
van to Laney but Kappa Sig came
back to take a 7-6 lead on a touch
down by Captain Herringer and a
successful conversion. Laney
scored the winning counter for the
Delta Chis after a series of short
passes had put the ball in scoring
position.
In the other game, the Phi Delts
trounced the D.U.'s 13-0. The first
touchdown came on a 20-yard inter
ception by Captain Kneubuhl and
the Phi Delts registered another
tally on the final play of the game
when Collins completed a nine-yard
touchdown to Greenlee.
A recruiting agency capable of
enlisting 500.000 volunteers in the
event of an outbreak of war is being
established by the United States
army.
