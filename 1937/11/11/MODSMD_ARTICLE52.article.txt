# Indians, UCLA To Battle In Tank Crucial
## 
### 
Either Stanford or U.C.L.A. will
be practically erased from the Pa
cific Coast Conference water polo
picture after their game to be play
ed this Saturday in Encina Pools.
The team that wins might pos
sibly go on to defeat California's
"Wonder Water Team" and grab
the league title. U.C.L.A. would
seem to have the edge because they
have already defeated the Indians
once, but the Cards are back in their
own 75-foot swimming hole and
may upset the Bruins.
Neither Stanford nor U.C.L.A. dis
played any semblance of a defense
in their first entanglement. The Red
offense is unorthodox, to say the
least, and has proved hard to stop
in the last three games. All Coach
Nort Thornton has to do now is to
find a defense that is just as tricky
and he might ease his squad back
into another champoinship. The
Bears have a decided edge on the
field, however, because they have
not yet been beaten or even ap
proached.
Games Friday with San Jose var
sity and frosh will begin at 3:15
o'clock, with the Indian frosh
meeting the Spartan frosh. Thorn
ton intends to start his jayvees in
the main event and will probably
let them play the whole game unless
the San Jose team proves too pow
erful.
