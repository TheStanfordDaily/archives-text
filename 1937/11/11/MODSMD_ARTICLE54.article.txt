## Cards Make Lone Point During Third Period To Defeat San Jose 
### 
Stanford's soccer team climbed !
back into second place in the Cali- j
fornia Intercollegiate Conference j
yesterday afternoon, when, for the
second time this season, it nosed out |
the San Jose Spartans by a 1-0
margin on the Indian field.
Yesterday's win, coupled with
S.F.U.'s defeat by California last
Saturday, put the Indians in the I
runner-up position behind the
Bears, and dropped the Dons into
third spot in the standings. Satur- J
day Stanford and California clash at
Berkeley for the first time this sea
son, and a victory for the Indians
will move them into the league
leadership.
Midway in the third period of yes
terday's game, Captain Dave Sloane ;
took a cornerkiek from Bill Arra
smith, Card outside right, and with |
his forehead bounced the ball into |
the San Jose net for the only score [
of the game.
From then on Stanford had to call
on every defensive tactic in the bag
to squelch scoring threats by a des
perate Spartan forward line. Play
ing the entire last quarter in dark
ness, and minus the services of their
all-conference goalie, Louis Faulb,
who pulled a muscle in the third pe- j
riod, the Indians tenaciously hung j
onto their slim margin of victory.
Once San Jose put the ball past
Reserve Goalie Rudy Munzer in the
final quarter, but it was called back
for offsides. The Spartans also blew
another scoring opportunity in the
waning minutes of play, when they
missed a free kick.
