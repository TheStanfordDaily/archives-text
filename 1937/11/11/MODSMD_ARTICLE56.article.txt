## Stanford Is Supposed To Observe It 
### 
FOR exactly twenty minutes this morning,
Stanford is supposed to observe Armistice
Day.
"Supposed to" is what we mean.
Each year someone arranges a program to
give busy Stanford a chance to observe the
Armistice, if it wants to, has classes dismissed
long enough to hold it, and happily retires the
side. The front is up. Stanford will observe
Armistice Day.

Each year Stanford does its part by cheerfully
accepting the dismissal of classes, and cele
brates. Reason for celebration is the chance
for a slow smoke near the English corner during
the service.
This year the program has been arranged,
classes will be dismissed between 10:40 and 11
o'clock, the side is retired and the front is up.
It's Armistice Day again. For twenty minutes
we hope Stanford observes it.
