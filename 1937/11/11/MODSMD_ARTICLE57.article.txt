# Why Force Equality?

### 
CHILDREN are supposed to be nice, but very
smart little children and very dull little chil
dren have long been the proverbial fly in the
ointment of American educators.
This week's issue of Time, the weekly news
magazine, cites what appears to be at least a
partial solution to this problem—the organiza
tion of the Speyer School for the mentally gifted,
by New York's progressive Board of Education
and Columbia's Teachers' College.
Fifty students with IQ's ranging from 130 to
200 were selected from more than 600 appli
cants from all walks of life and all sections of
New York. The group even included several
negroes from Jamaica and Haiti.
These children cover the regular grade school
curriculum —but they do it in about one-half the
normal time. Then, instead of having to wait for
less intelligent classmates, they are allowed to
go on with more advanced work—far beyond
the capacity of average members of their age
group.
Independent research in the sciences and
arts is fostered to set the youngsters far ahead
on the road to a complete education. They are
more self-sufficient and much better informed
than any similar group, and they seem to give
promise of exceptional ability in later life.
Patterned, as it is, on the advice of leading
educators and psychologists, the Speyer School
is an outstanding example of what can be done
to solve obvious deficiencies in our educational
system.
With little or no ballyhoo the school solved
a problem troublesome to teachers all over the
country—what to do with the superior student?
Present methods permit only of constant drill in
specific studies which is continued until all stu
dents have a more or less adequate grasp of the
information.
Incentive for superior work is lacking, and
possible geniuses dawdle along with less ca
pable classmates until the whole group is pre
pared to start on new information. While this
system continues, irreparable damage is being
done to the mentally gifted students, whose
talents are being wasted and whose exceptional
learning-capacity is not being utilized.

Until a genuine effort is made to streamline
modern education techniques by eliminating
obvious inefficiencies in the present system,
gifted students from the Empire State to the
Golden Gate will be forced to waste their time
in tedius routine.
These inefficiencies result from a system
which takes no stock in individual difference
and can only be eliminated when educators
make allowance for the fact that all men are
not created equal.—J. R.

Nations have recently been led to borrow
billions for war; no nation has ever borrowed
largely for education. Probably no nation is rich
enough to pay for both war and civilization. We
must make our choice; we cannot have both.—

billions for war; no nation has ever borrowed

CHILDREN are supposed to be nice, but very
smart little children and very dull little chil
dren have long been the proverbial fly in the
ointment of American educators.
This week's issue of Time, the weekly news
magazine, cites what appears to be at least a
partial solution to this problem—the organiza
tion of the Speyer School for the mentally gifted,
by New York's progressive Board of Education
and Columbia's Teachers' College.
Fifty students with IQ's ranging from 130 to
200 were selected from more than 600 appli
cants from all walks of life and all sections of
New York. The group even included several
negroes from Jamaica and Haiti.
These children cover the regular grade school
curriculum —but they do it in about one-half the
normal time. Then, instead of having to wait for
less intelligent classmates, they are allowed to
go on with more advanced work—far beyond
the capacity of average members of their age
group.
Independent research in the sciences and
arts is fostered to set the youngsters far ahead
on the road to a complete education. They are
more self-sufficient and much better informed
than any similar group, and they seem to give
promise of exceptional ability in later life.
Patterned, as it is, on the advice of leading
educators and psychologists, the Speyer School
is an outstanding example of what can be done
to solve obvious deficiencies in our educational
system.
With little or no ballyhoo the school solved
a problem troublesome to teachers all over the
country—what to do with the superior student?
Present methods permit only of constant drill in
specific studies which is continued until all stu
dents have a more or less adequate grasp of the
information.
Incentive for superior work is lacking, and
possible geniuses dawdle along with less ca
pable classmates until the whole group is pre
pared to start on new information. While this
system continues, irreparable damage is being
done to the mentally gifted students, whose
talents are being wasted and whose exceptional
learning-capacity is not being utilized.

Until a genuine effort is made to streamline
modern education techniques by eliminating
obvious inefficiencies in the present system,
gifted students from the Empire State to the
Golden Gate will be forced to waste their time
in tedius routine.

which takes no stock in individual difference
