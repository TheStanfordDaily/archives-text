# BULL SESSION
## TITLE CENSORED 
### 
IF ANYBODY knows of a market for surplus sor
row, I would appreciate it if he'd drop around to
the Daily shack and let us know about it. In the
shack sorrow lies an inch thick all over the floor;
gloom drips from the rafters. And this sadness is not
just romantic melancholy. It cannot be tagged with a
20-syllable German word meaning "it's a hell of a
world and my bank account is overdrawn." On the
contrary our sorrow has a firm foundation in human
sliminess. The Daily has been cheated. Its football
game with Chaparral has been called off.
In the half of the Washington State game, when
the crowd waits breathlessly for the Daily-Chappie
battle, a mob of grammar school boys will troop on
the field. Contrary to logical assumptions, this will
not be the Chappie squad warming up. I hope that
all observers will keep this point in mind throughout
the game. I have no unchristian wish to deprive
Chaparral of any glory that it may scavenge. But
common justice demands that the Hammer and Cof
fin boys stand on their own feet instead of pirating
credit that belongs to the grammar school laddies.

The Daily, of course, is heartbroken. A short
sighted lion who discovers that what he thought a
particularly tempting Christian martyr is only a
picce of statuary could not be more upset. But we
have controlled our righteous fury. I do not grouch
at the grammar school boys for wanting to prance
about on the field. I do not blame the Lions Club
for putting them up to it, although I do believe that
they would have been just as happy breaking each
other's necks in any back lot. Chaparral, however,
cannot be forgiven.
Now that the subtle maneuvers of Hammer and
Coffin have been exposed, I can understand why such
things as lynchings and mob violence can occur. It
is obvious that Chappie Editor Hartmann never in
tended to play a game. He knew that the school boys
would have an option on the right to kick each other
in the teeth Saturday. Skillfully Hammer and Coffin
arranged to get all the glory of a brave act without
risking their bridgework.

Yt/E of The Daily accepted the challenge in good
faith, and with very fair grade hope and charity.
We cut out cigarettes, went to bed early and generally
played hell with our constitutions by adopting regular
training rules. And now we find that if the Hammer
and Coffin boys wore shirts they would be laughing
in their sleeves. Ours is the sadness of the grey
hound that catches the tin rabbit.
We had hoped that the game would settle for all
lime the ancient feud between The Daily and Chap
arral. We knew that if our publics could only make
comparisons for themselves, The Daily would be both
ered no more by Chappie's shears and paste pot. Now
we are denied the trial. Personally, I think it violates
the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.
If I didn't have so mnay eight, o'elocks, I'd call
Hartin;inn out and pool him in (he grey dawn.
