IMPROVING ever since John Hammond picked him
out of a cafe in Kansas City, Count Basie is near
ing Teddy Wilson's peak. His stomp box is giving
out more and more of that stuff. For the improvement
hear "Listen, My Children" (Decca 1379). He gives
out neat little figures with a fine soft sax backing,
and on the same platter James Rushing (colored) does
some of his very best work on the vocal.
Basie's "One O'clock Jump" (Decca 1363) offers
some of the best tenor available when Hershal Evans
and Lester Young are featured in comparative pas
sages, with perhaps Evans getting the best of it in
this observer's opinion.
Just in case you didn't know, though you should
have, the greatest crew of Dixielanders in the game
are right here on the Pacific Coast, none other than
Bob Crosby at the Palomar in L.A. At present, he
is being KYAed at 8:15 and KFSOed at 10:45.
When the band isn't doing commercial tunes to
please the crowds, they really do some fine work.
Next time you tune in, listen for "Between the Devil
and the Deep Blue Sea," "Gin Mill Blues," and their
killer-diller, as Benny puts it, "Pagan Love Song."
"Gin Mill" is strictly in the Dixieland groove. It is
a perfect example of the slow, effortless style that
Crosby and his crew expound. The piano is Bob
Zurke, and if you're interested, a good idea of the
fundamental differences that exist between white and
colored piano styles at their best can be obtained by
comparing the Count Basie disk with Zurke's work.
"TJAGAN Love Song" has driven people crazy trying
to deiide whether Gene Krupa or Ray Baduc (with
Crosby) is the best drummer in the business. And
not to mention Dave Tough with Tommy Dorsey;
Johnny Williams, formerly with the Raymond Scott
Qunitette; Cozy Cole with Stuff Smith, and many more.
Try to hear how relaxed Baduc's drumming is in this
tune, and listen to the little things he does when one
of the other men in the band is taking eight bars.
Tommy Dorsey is slaying everybody again. This
time with his rendition of "Who." I'd like to know
who arranged it now that Mike Doty, his former lead
sax man, is gone. However, it is Dorsey's arrange
ment of "Dipsey Doodle" that has been running through
our mind. The tune seems like a conglomoration of
about six other tunes that we know, especially one
of the backgrounds that the Mills Brothers used. Any
way, it certainly hits the spot, and I'd be willing to bet
that it won't be long until everyone will be singing,
"And that's the way the Dipsey Doodle works"; even
with the words as silly as they are. Honest, it's simply
marvelous. Edythe Wright does the lyrics in her typ
ical smooth manner, helped with a clear background
by the Dorsey troupe.
The Casa Loma crew are back with a re-recording
of "For You." It's Kenny Sargent that does that super
job with the falsetto. The background is much fuller
this time than in the old arrangement, because of
added instrumentation; but, thank God, it's got that
good old Casa Loma touch. And in case you get around
to it, listen to Pee Wee Hunt's vocalizing of Larry Clin
ton's "Let 'er Go, Let 'er Go, Let 'er Go." Pee Wee
can still give tunes that little something. And we're
all for him.
