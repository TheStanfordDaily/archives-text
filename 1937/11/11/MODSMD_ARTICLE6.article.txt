# Know Music To Enjoy It, Avers Pinza
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
That students would enjoy class
ical music if they were only ex
posed to it more is the opinion of
the tall, dark, and handsome young
basso who granted an interview to
The Daily reporter last night at
"half time" of the concert.
"We like what we hear, and what
we don't hear we don't usually like.
Therefore, if classical music wei'e
played on the radio more than the
so-called popular music, people
would acquire a taste for it," Pinza
said.
Opposes English Operas
In contrast to Lawrence Tibbett,
who sang here last April, and who
believes that many operas should be
sung in English so that the Ameri
can people can better understand
them, Pinza feels that operas should
not be translated for in translation
they lose many of their meanings.
The campus, he feels, is beautiful;
he has no favorite role in opera; he
sees no difference between the re
sponse of student audiences and
regular audiences; and thinks that
west coast music is no different
from the music on the east coast
in level of attainment.
To Return to 'Met'
Pinza will return to the Metro
politan Opera Company, in which
he made his American debut in
1926.
To Pianist Paxton go honors for
noticing the large crowd and the
contrast between the Memorial Hall
and the old Pavilion, in which he
accompanied Nelson Eddy two years
ago.
