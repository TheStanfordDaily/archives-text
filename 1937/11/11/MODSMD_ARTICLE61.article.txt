# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In answer to Monday's editorial,
"Unfair Competition," the Roger
Williams Club wishes to make the
following statement:
The club is a Stanford student or
ganization and as such should not
be labeled one of "Palo Alto's re
ligious groups." The Roger Wil
liams Club not only takes its name
from a pioneer of religious liberty,
but what is more important, it
builds its program on that tradition.
Inasmuch as this is the policy of the
club, it has no intention of trying to
regulate campus recreation.
The fireside hour on Sunday eve
nings at 8:15 has grown out of the
desire for informal gatherings
where the discussions of vital ques
tions are natural, and where stu
dents may become acquainted with
their professors, campus leaders,
and authorities in many fields. Our
program is not presented to com
pete with any other group or activ
ity, but is presented for those who
take an interest in what it has to
offer. Of course most students in
terested in religion and in groups
organized because of that interest,
appreciate good motion pictures, and
it is too bad that the pictures can
not be available at a time when there
would not be such a conflict.
Yours sincerely,
Walter Jameson, President
Roger Williams Club
