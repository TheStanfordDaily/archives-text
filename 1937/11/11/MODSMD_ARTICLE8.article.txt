# Japanese Consul Lays Blame On China In War
## 
### 
China is the aggressor in the Far
East, Japanese Consul Hirota told
the International Club yesterday at
its meeting in West Memorial Li
brary.
Mr. Hirota emphasized the fact
that he spoke as a private citizen of
Japan, not as a representative of the
government.
, "China wanted this war and in
tended this kind of trouble," said
the San Francisco consul. "The
shooting around Shanghai was
started by Chinese troops, and Chi
nese warlords refused peaceful set
tlement."
Japan Not Aggressor
Speaking in place of Consul Mi
nore lino, who had arranged to ad
dress the club, Mr. Hirota denied
the truth of statements by Presi
dent Roosevelt and Secretary of
| State Cordell Hull that Japan is ag
, pressor.
Japan has treaty rights to keep
troops around Shanghai and hold
maneuvers there, said the speaker.
Although these zones were demili
tarized in 1932, he continued, Japan
found that the Chinese had fortified

the areas heavily.
The consul told club members that
it is not true that Japan is inten
tionally killing noncombatants.
Aim at Military Posts
"When we send our bombers to
destroy some cities or railroads," he
said, "we are just trying to destroy
military posts or communication
lines.
"In order to protect the 30,000
Japanese in Shanghai, we had to de
stroy cities where Chinese troops
were staying. In doing that, we
might have killed some non-combat
ants living nearby. We regret for
them very much."
Declaring that Japan was fighting
against Communism and for its own
economic existence, Mr. Hirota re
minded the group that the United
States sent gunboats in 1927 to bom
bard Nanking when Chinese nation
alism harmed this country.
Nippon's side of the Far Eastern
struggle is not generally heard in
this country, said the speaker, be
cause "American newspapers won't
publish any facts or information fa
vorable to Japan."
