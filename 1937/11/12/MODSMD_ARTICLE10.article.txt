## 
### 
GLENDALE, Nov. 10 (UP). —
Coroner Frank Nance today investi
gated what he charged was "a cover
up attempt" in the "love kiss" slay
ing of Evelyn Mcßride Wright, 30,
and John Kimmel, 35, for which the
woman's husband, Paul A. Wright,
40, is being held on murder charges.
Nance said Mrs. Wright's body was
removed from her home, where the
shooting occurred Tuesday when
Wright discovered his wife in the
embrace of Kimmel, before his dep
uties arrived. The body was taken
to a hospital, and from there re
moved to a mortuary, where it was
embalmed before the coroner could
perform an autopsy.
