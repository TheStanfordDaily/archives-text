# Moliere Farce Packs Comic Wallop
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Stanford Roughs scared away from
the first night of Director Stevens'
production of "Don Juan" by the
name "Moliere" may consider them
selves lucky that they have three
more nights in which to see it.
For "Don Juan" is not only good
theater in itself, but has been
blessed with a cast which extracts
the most from every line and every
situation.
The oft-applied, rarely justified
adjective "all-star" can be used here |
without fear of objection.
Chief standouts are Gary Simpson j
and Bud Cady, splitting honors with |
perhaps a slight edge going to Cady's
timorous and philosophical Sgana
relle. Simpson's Don Juan, a su
perbly bedecked and bejeweled por
trait of a thorough-going rascal, is [

excellently done, with all the cus
tomary flourishes and cynical pom
posity of the Renaissance dandy.
Hoke Roberts contributes his best
part to date as Pierrot, the amorous
yokel, and his scene with Kay Camp
bell in the second act forms one of
the comedy highlights of the eve
ning. Virginia Rogers also pleases
in a small part, and Phyllis Corson
shows unexpected depth and under
standing in her characterization of
Donna Elvire.
Sets are in the capable hands of
Waldemar Johansen, remembered
from last year's successful Shake
speare treatise, "This Side Idolatry."
The heralded capacities of the Little
Theater stage are not made full use
of —the play does not require them
but a sense of intimacy impossible on
the main stage is achieved with a

minimum of effort,
Mr. Stevens' translation preserves
all the original humor of the play
and presents it in English which
occasionally rises to a high plane of
eloquence and dramatic fluency. The
punch lines come thick and fast, and
are fortunately in the hands of a
cast which knows how to make the
most of them.
"Don Juan" is a good play any
time; but in Stanford's streamlined
production, modernized, beautifully
staged, and splendidly cast, it emer
ges as topical as a headline and
about ton times as funny.
If you don't it, you'll be miss
ing one of the best things done on
the Stanford stage in many a long
and sometimes boring day. Mr. Ste
vens and his actors ,be it known,
have got something there.

Donna Elvire.
Sets are in the capable hands of
Waldemar Johansen, remembered
from last year's successful Shake
speare treatise, "This Side Idolatry."
The heralded capacities of the Little
Theater stage are not made full use
of —the play does not require them
but a sense of intimacy impossible on
the main stage is achieved with a

minimum of effort,
Mr. Stevens' translation preserves
all the original humor of the play
and presents it in English which
occasionally rises to a high plane of
eloquence and dramatic fluency. The
punch lines come thick and fast, and
are fortunately in the hands of a
cast which knows how to make the
most of them.
"Don Juan" is a good play any
time; but in Stanford's streamlined
production, modernized, beautifully
staged, and splendidly cast, it emer
ges as topical as a headline and
about ton times as funny.
If you don't it, you'll be miss
ing one of the best things done on
the Stanford stage in many a long
and sometimes boring day. Mr. Ste
vens and his actors ,be it known,
have got something there.
Stanford Roughs scared away from
the first night of Director Stevens'
production of "Don Juan" by the
name "Moliere" may consider them
selves lucky that they have three
more nights in which to see it.
For "Don Juan" is not only good
theater in itself, but has been
blessed with a cast which extracts
the most from every line and every
situation.
The oft-applied, rarely justified
adjective "all-star" can be used here |
without fear of objection.
Chief standouts are Gary Simpson j
and Bud Cady, splitting honors with |
perhaps a slight edge going to Cady's
timorous and philosophical Sgana
relle. Simpson's Don Juan, a su
perbly bedecked and bejeweled por
trait of a thorough-going rascal, is [

excellently done, with all the cus
tomary flourishes and cynical pom
posity of the Renaissance dandy.
Hoke Roberts contributes his best
part to date as Pierrot, the amorous
yokel, and his scene with Kay Camp
bell in the second act forms one of
the comedy highlights of the eve
ning. Virginia Rogers also pleases
in a small part, and Phyllis Corson
shows unexpected depth and under
standing in her characterization of
Donna Elvire.
