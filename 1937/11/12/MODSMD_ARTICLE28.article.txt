# Cougars, Indians Meet Tomorrow In Crucial Clash
## Thornhill Plans Air Attack; Paulman Shifted to Fullback Spot 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Coach Babe Hollingbery is bringing a carload of football players down
from up north to try to knock a bunch of Stanford Indians and their
ambitions way back in the shade of the sidelines tomorrow.
The Cougar coach is counting on his two triple-threat men, Eddie
Bayre and Paul Callow, his team's exceptional passing attack, his rugged

• line to make Tiny Thornhill's boys
forget all about beating Cal and go
ing to the Rose Bowl when he in
vades the Stadium tomorrow at 2:30.
Stanford can certainly forget
about the Rose Bowl if Washington
State knocks the boys around to
morrow, and it may mean that
they'll have to give up all hope of
winning the Big Game.
So Thornhill will be sending them
out tomorrow to push the Cougars,
through mud and high water if nec
essary, clear back up to Pullman.
He has picked a first string for
the battle wihch he thinks will put
his team at the top of their effi
ciency, and he has shifted his backs
around enough to confuse the boys
from up north considerably.
Thornhill's new set-up gives Bill
Paulman his chance to show what
people around here have waited for
over a year for him to show. He will
get the job as Chief Ball-CaiTier
tomorrow.
Ever since he played with Bobby
Grayson and the Vowing Sophs, he
has been a quarterback. Tomorrow
he will be in at fullback, taking Jim
Groves' spot. Thornhill expects this
change to substantially strengthen
his team, because Paulman is not
only one of the best ball carriers on
the squad, he is easily the best
passer.
The skies are going to be filled
with more than clouds tomorrow
afternoon—they're going to be clut
tered up with spinning footballs. All
week Paulman and his mates have
been working on a passing attack.
And from the reports that drift
down from Washington, the Cougars
are not unwilling to take a well
taught lesson from the birds. They
throw the pigskin around with more
talent than any team on the coast.
With Paulman in at full, Jim
Groves has been shifted to quarter.
But this change isn't as drastic and
dogmatic as it sounds. Generally it
depends on the play who will be at
full. The positions are, in other
words, more or less interchangeable.
The big difference is* that Paulman
will be carrying the ball and not
blocking this week.
Bill Kirsch has moved up to the
first string over Fred Ledeboer at
right half, with Pete Fay at first
string left half. This backfield of
Paulman, Fay, Groves, and Kirsch
is the one Thornhill expects to click
against Washington State.
The first-string lino now is Cap
tain Grant Stone and Neil Rasmus
sen at ends, Pete Zagar and Stan
Anderson at tackles, Leo Ferko and
Jack Walton at guards, and Tony
Calvelli at center.
But that is not necessarily the
team that will start the game Satur
day. Thornhill said yesterday that
he doesn't know definitely just who
will start. He will decide sometime
before 2:30 tomorrow.
Bill Willard, Bob Dakan, and
Frank McMillan will definitely not
be in the game, in spite of the fact
that they were suited up and work
ing out yesterday. Thornhill is go
ing to be sure that they get in the
Big Game.
Ben Winkleman, who scouted the
Cougar team, says that the Indians
are going to be in for a heavy after
noon tomorrow. Hollingberry's team
has a very tricky shift which will no
doubt give the Cards considerable
trouble. And he says that they have
a defensive line as good as any Stan
ford has met this year. Their pass
ing attack has been better all season
than Stanford's, and their kicking is
exceptional.
And along with their triple-threat
men Bayne and Callow, they have a
187-pound fullback, Carl Littlefield,
who is equal to any line plunger on
the coast, and an end, Holmes Chub,
who is an outstanding pass receiver.
Besides being their best line bucker,
Littlefield is the fastest man on the
team.
It's Washington State this week
and Cal next if the boys in red
want to go to the Rose Bowl!
