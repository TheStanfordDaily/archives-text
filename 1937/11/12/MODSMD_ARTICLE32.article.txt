SANTA CRUZ. Nov. 11 (UP). â€”
Joseph McCaughney, Watsonville
fuel dealer, was not with his 11 fel
low jurors last night when they re
lumed a not guilty verdict in the
case of Carlos Serpa, accused on a
morals charge.
He was, instead, in jail, serving a
five-day sentence and under orders
to pay a $100 fine for contempt of
court for appearing in the jury box
in an intoxicated condition.
