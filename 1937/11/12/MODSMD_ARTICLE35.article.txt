### 
SANTA BARBARA, Nov. 10
(UP). â€”Judge A. Bowman Bigler to
day took under advisement the re
quest of Mrs. Edith Shearn Oland
that her husband, Warner Oland,
"Charlie Chan" of the films, pay
her $3500 a month for her support,
pending suit for divorce.
Attorneys for the wife of the Chi
nese impersonator claimed Oland's
income this year was $95,000, and
that $3,500 a month for his wife's
support was reasonable.
