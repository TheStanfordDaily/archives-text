# Japan Seeks Dominance Of Asiatic Nations
## Nippon Aims To Enforce Will in Foreign Areas Of Shanghai Sector 
### 
SHANGHAI, Friday, Nov. 12 (U.R).
—Japan completed her conquest of
Shanghai today in an appalling wel
ter of blood and flames and served
notice on Britain, the United States,
and other democratic powers that
she intends to crush all anti-Japa
nese elements in China and swing
the 400,000.000 people of this nation
into a Japanese-dominated group of
Asiatic nations.
The Chinese said that 80 new Jap
anese troop transports arrived today
off Woosung, north of Shanghai,
with 50,000 reinforcements for the
Japanese armies in this area.
Resistance Ended
A Chinese army spokesman ad
mitted that all Chinese troops have
been ordered to leave the Nantao
area of the native city and that Chi
nese resistance in the immediate
vicinity of Shanghai has ended.
More important than the Japanese
victory to the United States and
other powers represented here, was
a declaration by Japanese Com
mander Lieutenant General I wane
Matsui that Japan now is master of
the Shanghai area and intends to
enforce her will in the Anglo-Amer
ican and other areas of the city as
well as in the regions she has con
quered.
Recognition Expected
The general told newspapermen,
in effect, that Japan now expects the
powers to recognize her victory and
to grant her full co-operation in the
suppression of the anti - Japanese
movement among the Chinese.
Scores of known anti-Japanese
leaders still are in refuge in the for
eign areas and the powers faced the
possibility that the Japanese may in
vade their territory to seize these
Chinese.
Co-operation Needed
British and Americans thought
General Matsui's assertions were
more a warning than a threat, and
they agreed that a considerable
measure of co-operation' with the
Japanese would be both necessary
and advisable for the simple reason
that there no longer are any Chinese
in authority around Shanghai with
whom to deal.
The Nanking Military Affairs
Commission promised Chinese resi
dents of Shanghai the "early recov
ery" of the Shanghai area from the
Japanese. The message said China
will continue the war indefinitely.

Co-operation Needed
British and Americans thought
General Matsui's assertions were
more a warning than a threat, and
they agreed that a considerable
measure of co-operation' with the
Japanese would be both necessary
and advisable for the simple reason
that there no longer are any Chinese
in authority around Shanghai with
whom to deal.
The Nanking Military Affairs
Commission promised Chinese resi
dents of Shanghai the "early recov
ery" of the Shanghai area from the
Japanese. The message said China
will continue the war indefinitely.
SHANGHAI, Friday, Nov. 12 (U.R).
—Japan completed her conquest of
Shanghai today in an appalling wel
ter of blood and flames and served
notice on Britain, the United States,
and other democratic powers that
she intends to crush all anti-Japa
nese elements in China and swing
the 400,000.000 people of this nation
into a Japanese-dominated group of
Asiatic nations.
The Chinese said that 80 new Jap
anese troop transports arrived today
off Woosung, north of Shanghai,
with 50,000 reinforcements for the
Japanese armies in this area.
Resistance Ended
A Chinese army spokesman ad
mitted that all Chinese troops have
been ordered to leave the Nantao
area of the native city and that Chi
nese resistance in the immediate
vicinity of Shanghai has ended.
More important than the Japanese
victory to the United States and
other powers represented here, was
a declaration by Japanese Com
mander Lieutenant General I wane
Matsui that Japan now is master of
the Shanghai area and intends to
enforce her will in the Anglo-Amer
ican and other areas of the city as
well as in the regions she has con
quered.
Recognition Expected
The general told newspapermen,
in effect, that Japan now expects the
powers to recognize her victory and
to grant her full co-operation in the
suppression of the anti - Japanese
movement among the Chinese.
Scores of known anti-Japanese
leaders still are in refuge in the for
eign areas and the powers faced the
possibility that the Japanese may in
vade their territory to seize these
Chinese.
