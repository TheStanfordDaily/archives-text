# Color To Dress Up Inside Of Chappie
## 
### BERT ALWARD 
The Old Boy stuck his traditional head out of his hovel among the
upper reaches of the I'ress Building the other day, just in time Ui be
snagged by a Daily reporter.
Alter strenuous questioning, he revealed that the November issue of
Chaparral would be even more stupendous than last month and that

spring was not here as someone hadi
misinformed him a week or so ago.
In fact, it was raining, which makes
him dishappy.
After blurting the usual tremen
dous trifles concerning the issue to
be loosed on the campus next Fri
day, Bob liartmann melted to a
sizzling mass of jelly and started to
write a Campus Opinion.
After further nosing about the
Press Building, Foster Markolff re
vealed that this would be an even
more costly, even larger edition of
the campus humor magazine than
last month, replete with 60 pages,
and color on the inside.
More contributors have been cor
raled this month than ever before,
and all the jokes are either funny
or clean, according to those who
wrote or scissored them.
Printing of this issue will cost
about 50 cents per copy, so all are

urged to buy this dead give-away,
while it lasts, on Friday the nine
teenth before ihe Big Game.
Innovation of color on the inside
is the Pride of' the Old Boy's heart,
he said, as he leaned back in his
chair and dictated to his surround
ing minions.
He also asked all contributors to
get their December copy in before
Thursday, if it is to go in the next
issue.
