# Tuba-Playing Mr. Deeds Will Caper Sunday
## Skiing Short Completes Memorial Hall Bill 
### 
You just haven't lived unless you
have met that tuba-playing Cinder
ella-man, Mr. Deeds. And he "Goes
to Town" in the Memorial Hall this
Sunday night at 7 o'clock.
Gary Cooper's slow-speaking non
conformist, mighty commoner with
the soul of a poet, has become a sec
ond Paul Bunyan in American folk
lore. He's a man of the people, the
crazy fool who wanted to spend a
million dollars to keep people from
starving.
He's the lad who writes your
greeting-card verses—specialties on
Mothers' Day. The greatest Ameri
can character since Tom Sawyer—
Mr. Deeds.
And the delectable Jean Arthur,
who keeps the brew stirred up,
makes a sucker out of him, turns
True Blue in the end to make the
perfect match. A news-hawk with a
heart of gold instead of lead slugs,
with ink in her veins, but a quixotic
turn. Ah love, ah Jean.
Add Lionel Stander and the Pixi
lated Twins to the recipe, and you
have a latter-day classic, by Capra
out of Columbia.
As an appetizer for the bill-of
fare, try the sports short, "Ski-ing
Is Believing." The total price is 15
cents, box office open at 6:30.
Get on the bandwagon. Go Deeds.
