SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 11 (U.R).
In a four-hour strike today, 150
Postal Telegraph Company messen
gers won what virtually amounted to
a six-cent increase in their daily pay.
The management agreed to waive
the requirement that each boy pay
six cents a day for uniform rental
and maintenance.
The boys kept on working during
the strike period, but they worked
in their everyday clothes, refusing
to don the uniforms until a settle
ment. was reached.
The exemption affected messen
gers in San Francisco and Oakland.
