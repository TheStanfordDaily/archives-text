# Longshoremen Avert Tie-up
## Lumber Release Saves Waterfront Closure 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 11 (U.P.).—
The closure of Portland's waterfront
was temporarily averted today when
longshoremen loaded the steamship
Hegira with American Federation of
Labor "hot" lumber and the Water
front Employers' Association sus
pended their order.
The situation was not completely
settled, however, with Committee for
Industrial Organization sawmill
workers releasing only the lumber
in dispute. They had been given
until 8 a.m. today to load the ship;
otherwise the employers had prom
ised the tie-up.
Other vessels in the harbor were
not working cargo today because of
the Armistice Day holiday.
"We decided it was the best thing
to do at this time," said George
Brown, official of the C.1.0. sawmill
workers. "We didn't want to throw
our brother longshoremen out of
work. But we don't intend to release
any more. I don't think they'll at
tempt to send any more 'hot lumber'
here."
"Loading the Hegira does not au
tomatically remove the closing or
der," Edward S. Coates, manager of
the Employers' Association, said.
"We put it up to the longshoremen,
and they have taken this action.
We want assurance that similar in
cidents will not occur."
The decision was reached at a
meeting of the employers and the
Longshoremen's Labor Relations
Board held at employers' headquar
ters after midnight this morning as
the 8 a.m. deadline approached.
