# Brazil Begins Formation Of Fascist State
## Startling Coup D'Etat Invests Vargas With Sole Ruling Power 
### 
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Nov. 11
(U.R). — President Getulio Vargas,
invested with complete governing
powers by an unexpected coup d'e
tat, today began formation of Bra
zil's corporative state —the first Fas
cist-like government in the Western
Hemisphere.
The president started work after
his speech to the nation in which he
outlined his plans of government
and announced indefinite suspension
of foreign debt payments "until it is
possible to readjust them without
bleeding and impoverishing our eco
nomic organism."
New Cabinet Named
The first action of the president,
whose term of office was extended
indefinitely pending popular ap
proval of the newly promulgated
constitution, was to name a new
cabinet. The old one resigned col
lectively to "facilitate composition
of the government organization."
Among the resigned ministers
was Francisco Campos, Minister of
Justice, who announced promulga
tion of the new federal charter and
dissolution of the national Congress,
state legislatures, and municipal
councils. Observers believed Cam
pos, who appeared as one of the
president's strongest collaborators in
the move which concentrated su
preme power in the chief executive's
hands, would retain his post on the
new cabinet.
Campos, although not affiliated at
present with any political party, was
one of the leaders of the 1930 revo
lution which placed President Var
gas in power. He was the founder of
the first Fascist-like political or
ganization in Brazil, the Partido Na
cional Montanhez, which later was
disbanded by its leaders.
To Name Council
The council will be named and be
gin to function before parliamentary
elections which will follow the con
stitutional plebiscite. Pending elec
tions for Parliament and assembly
decree.
An 11-man Supreme Court may
declare acts of the Parliament un
constitutional but the president "if
nccessary for the people's welfare,"
may re-submit the invalidated laws
to Parliament and if re-passed, the
high tribunal would be overridden.
