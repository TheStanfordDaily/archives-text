# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE
						"BIG" GAME 
### 
The Editor, Sirrah!
This latest assault upon our honor
goes beyond the bounds of excusable
imbecility. That Great Journal of
Inconsequential Consequences, the
Stanford Daily, has declared us
fraudulent, cowardly, and unconsti
tutional. It is about time the truth
should be known about The Daily,
even though I blush to tell it.
Daily Derided
In regard to the football game—it
was never called off by CHAPAR
RAL. That insidious parlor-Fascist,
Cobbs, simply leaped at the chance
of calling quits when it was learned
that the game could not be played
Saturday. He says the Daily staff has
been inconvenienced to the extent
of living decently. We suspect they
will soon be able to gain their un
shaven, pencil - in - ear, romantic
young reporter appearances. The
CHAPPIES didn't bother to train for
such an insignificant workout. Mas
ter Cobbs also accuses me, person
ally, of having had a foreknowledge
of the impossibility of the contest.
Reflect, gentle readers, that Big
Chief Frost used to be a sports writ
er (see "From Rags to Riches," vol.
17). As such he is undoubtedly thick
with the BAC. So can't you just
imagine Gordy giving A1 Masters a
quiet call—"Please, Al, try and get
some little boys, otherwise we're lost,
Al, you know how it is, Al, sure I
won't write anything bad about you,
Al, 0.k., Al, thanks a lot, Al."
Castout's Haven
Before closing, I should like to
give some helpful advice to those
poor souls who have ambitions to
become Daily moguls. There are two
accepted ways of becoming a suc
cessful columnist. One is to write
in a beautiful musical meter, and
never, say anything—that, to give
the devil Cobbs his due, is the best
way. The other way is to write an
article for CHAPARRAL and have
it refused. Then write an anonymous
gripe about CHAPARRAL for Cam
pus Opinion. Then the Daily Shack
welcomes you warmly as one of the
boys, and gives you a nice little col
umn all your own to clutter up.
But, friends, 1 really can't bring
myself to hate The Daily. But it is
fortunate that I have a great capacity
to pity, for otherwise I would meet
Mr. Cobbs in the Inner Quad at high
noon and beat that mint-julep which
he uses for blood out of his sopho
moric body.
Scornfully,
