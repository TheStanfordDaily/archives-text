# TICKETS OR NO?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I wonder if I could persuade The
Daily organization to do me a favor.
I would like very much to get a look
a man who was able to buy a
ticket to the Gaieties today. So far
I have not been able to unearth one.
Unless I can discover at least one
person who got a ticket, I am going
to be faced with the conclusion that
the whole affair was just a myth,
that it was a subtle trick engineered
by the Communists to plant the
seeds of unrest on the campus. Men
waited hours in line to be told that
the tickets were all sold. Things like
that cause revolutions.
Could you tell me if there is any
evidence to prove that tickets actu
ally existed? The suspicion is grow
ing on me that somebody has been
playing fast and loose with my trust
ing faith in what I am told. And un
less I can find evidence to the con
trary, I am going to demand some
body's head on a charger.
Sincerely,
Frustrated
