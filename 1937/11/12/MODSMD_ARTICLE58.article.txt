# MORE GAIETIES

The Editor, Sir:
Along with the majority of the
student body, I'm griped. The rea
son is the same as it was after the
Big Game ticket sale, only this
time it concerns the Gaieties tickets.
There is something wrong with the
system here when the majority of
the tickets are sold before they even
go on sale, and then when they do
K<> on sale, certain "privileged Big
Shots" are allowed to buy up whole
blocks of sixty or more of what's left.
The Sabine women didn't get any
worse treatment than the majority
of the student body has in this last
"purge."
For remedy I offer two sugges
tions: First, allow each man to buy
only two tickets at one standing. If
'tie has to have more, let him go to
, lie end of the line and give the
others their chance. Secondly, at
least for the Gaieties, which is a
students' show for the students, let
the some five hundred odd faculty
members and other "special cases"
take their chance with the rest of
us for the good seats. They seem to
have gotten a corner on the Con
cert Series already. How's about
giving the rank and file a break for
a change?
