The Editor, Sir:
We actually know of one Stanford
student not a member of the hier
archy of the A.S.S.U. or of the S.A.E.
house who managed to acquire one
one-dollar ticket to the Gaieties at
the announced date of sale, Novem
ber 11. It is gratifying to know that
one of the nonentities, such as our
selves, will have an opportunity to
view this so-called Stanford show.
It also seems a shame to bother
with the formalities of a seat sale if
the "hierarchy" reserves the seats
weeks in advance. Might we sug
gest. Mr. McDaniel, that the seniors
have at least a fighting chance for
standing room at their Gaieties—
or is that being too presumptuous?
Lest our honorable Mr. McDaniel
and his cohorts forget, we suggest n

slight thought toward the probable
attitude of Councils on the "scalp
ing" of tickets. Perhaps, this will
dampen the delusions of grandeur
and dreams of gold of those who
magnanimously offer a fifty - cent
seat to the campus masses for five
dollars in hopes, dare we guess, of a
super week-end at Del Monte.
Two weeks ago, we understand, a
few good seats to the Gaieties were
available. May we state our cha
grin at being too slow, insignificant,
or perhaps upright to have missed
the so-called boat.
Here's a suggestion to your suc
cessor, Mr. McDaniel—to you for
having learned the secret of suc
cess.
