The Editor, Sir:
I just paid $5.00 for my Gaieties
ticket. Did you get sucked too, or
are you a "Big Shot" with a drag?
My "fence" was a prominent senior
who is laughingly working his way
through college. He was only able
to procure forty good tickets, and
half of them went to his "brothers"
at $2.75 per, so he may have to come
back next year for another Gaie
ties ticket sale, before he can afford
to get married and take his Hono
lulu honeymoon. Now isn't that a
shame?
Then of course there's the story of
the 500 professors — emeritus
et al. — instructors, graders, paper
readers, secretaries, coaches, and all
of their families and pals who are
going to have to be contented with
only ten tickets apiece in the orches
tra and first ten rows balcony be
cause the other two good seats are
being re-upholstered. What a pity!
I doubt if Lincoln Steffens would
even try to investigate the stinking
situation in regard to this last sale.
How's about a shakeup?
