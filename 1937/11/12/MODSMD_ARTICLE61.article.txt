# Duke Snubbed At Ceremonies
## English Pastor Objects To Wally's Divorce 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 11 (U.R).â€”The Duke
of Windsor, who faced shell fire with
British Tommies in the trenches,
spent Armistice Day in the seclu
sion of his hotel suite because a
Church of England pastor announced
(hat he was "not welcome" at me
morial services for his war-time
buddies.
A year ago today, as King Edward
VIII of the British Empire, he stood
before the Cenotaph in London and
led one-fourth of the world's people
in reverent homage.
Today the pastor of St. George's
English church, the Rev. J. L. C.
Dart, said he was "not particularly
keen" about Edward's planned at
tendance at the British Legion me
morial service, even though he had
been invited by the war veterans,
because of the Duchess of Windsor's
two divorces.
The Duke, thus driven further into
exile by a representative of the
church that was largely responsible
for his renouncement of the throne
a year ago, retired to hi" hotel suite.
Alone with his Duchess he ob
served the two minutes' silence for
1,000,000 of his countrymen who
died in the World War.
He also canceled plans to attend
the Armistice Day parade of the
French army, declining an invitation
from President Albert Lebrun to sit
in the presidential tribune on the
Champs Elysees because he feared
some embarrassing incident might
result.
