# Jorgenson, Cobbs Clash Over Peace Question
## 
### 
Opposing views on methods of
"Working for Peace" clashed last
night when John Cobbs, Daily "Bull
Sessioner," and Irvin Jorgensen, for
mer Daily editor, led a Walrus Club
open panel discussion.
Jorgensen opened the meeting
with a short talk following the line
of "Crusading for Peace" through
aggressive action, while Cobbs main
tained that an "Evolved Pcace," ar
rived at through intelligently
planned reasoning, is the superior
method.
"We can't have peace by running
rough-shod over men and force
fully telling them to 'Be Peaceful!'"
said the Bull Sessioner. "They will
resent it forcefully. We must plan
an advertising campaign carried out
on carefully laid lines of attack, and
appeal to intelligence."
In opposition, Jorgensen and his
supporters in the audience main
tained that the best way to learn
about peace is to join actively in the
tight for peace.
"The best plan," said the ex-editor,
"is to get excited about peace now,
rather than when the bayonet Ls
probing your viscera, when it's a
little too late to get excited."
Basic difference between the two

lines of achieving peace, as outlined
by the speakers, was on methods of
education.
Jorgensen averred that a philoso
phy of neutrality can only be at
tained when the student "goes out
and gets his nose flattened," and
thus prepares for a defense of peace
views in the eventuality of another
world war.
In refutation, Cobbs said, "Peace
is not a conquest, it's a persuasion,
and one can prepare one's self for
the fight for peace by learning,
through college education, the broad
background of causes producing war
and through impartial judgment of
the economic, psychological, and so
cial factors involved."
