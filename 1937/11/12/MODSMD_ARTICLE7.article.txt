# Alpha Delts Play Xmas Too Early
## 
### 
Forty-two days till Christ
mas.
That, however, didn't stop
the Alpha Delts from doing a
little Christmas tree decoration
on the lofty evergreen in their
front yard.
Students going up the Row
yesterday afternoon saw the
lofty evergreen trimmed in
toilet paper, giving a snowy
effect to all its branches. More
"snow" was scattered around
under the tree.
Cause â€”well, the Alpha Delts
have the grammar school kid
dies as next door neighbors,
and perhaps wanted to help
them by supplying Santa Claus
atmosphere to such a scholastic
place.
