# Montana Tramples Carroll Eleven 74-0
## 
### 
HELENA, Mont., Nov. 11 (U.R).â€”
A heavy Montana State College foot
ball team went on a scoring ram
page today and buried the light
Carroll College eleven under an
avalanche of touchdowns that ended
with the score 74 to 0.
Sparked by Don Cosner and
Frank Strong, halfbacks, the Bob
cats rolled to three touchdowns in
each of the two quarters. The
second and third Montana State
teams continued the scoring with 13
points in the third quarter and 19
in the final period. Carroll College
never threatened.

A well - preserved Roman road
2,000 years old has been uncovered
at Dorchester, England.
