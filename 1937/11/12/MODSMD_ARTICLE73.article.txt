### 
FULL WEEK-END

Stanford's Stadium, Highway
Field, and Encina Pools, plus Ber
keley's soccer field and airport
make up a scene of great athletic
activity this week-end, as Stanford
isthletes take part in five tell-tale
i ontests today, tomorrow, and Sun
c.'ay.
Topping today's list will be two
water polo games this afternoon
\ ith San Jose State. The Card jun
ior varsity is expected to gain a de
( sive victory over the Spartans, but
ii.' at half time the victory looks
questionable, Coach Nort Thornton
iilay throw his first string varsity
c mibination to save the name of the
ludinas. Stanford frosh will play a
I reliminary against San Jose neo-
I hytes. The game will be closer to
; toss-up, but a good showing of the
; oung Redskins in scrimmage against
the varsity this week gives them the
edge.
Bruin swimmers will be out to
repeat the X-G victory they gar
nered against the Cards at Los
Angeles last week-end. But this
lime they'll be playing in a large
pool, to which the Indians are ac
customed instead of tbe small
pool, in which U.C.L.A. won only
through a sudden defensive
weakness in Stanford's last two
minutes of play.
U.C.L.A. is the only team to de
' .»at the Cards since Nort shuffled
Jie line-up and introduced a new
(.flense that has worked with great
i fficiency. So the Cards should win
by a small margin.
On the Highway Field this after
; oon, the Indian horsemen will meet
!san Mateo for the fourth time. The
visitors have won three out of four
< ncounters with Stanford riders
this year. Although this afternoon's
.! ame looks like a toss-up, the score
is hard to predict because San Ma
i .'o uses a different team in almost
every game.

f OC'CER AND Alii
MEET AT BERKELEY

Tomorrow morning the Card soc
t er team will meet the University of
California aggregation at Berkeley
to decide the leading team of the
league. California has an excellent
Uam this year, but the Indians have
•;'one just as far. It looks like a
toss-up. Results will depend upon
which team is hot.
Sunday afternoon Stanford flyers
will hop into planes and go up to
ihe Oakland Airport to take part in
the first Big Meet in the air. Cal
.Myers have been organized for only
a month, and already 80 airmen
have turned out to compete against
Stanford's 30.
Card aviators have few worries,
however, because they are still the
leading group of student flyers in
the United States. It will be a
Stanford victory by a large margin.

TOMORROW'S GAME
WILL BE NO SNAP

Daily forecasters count on a 13-7
win over Washington tomorrow, but
remember that sports writers have
•jreatest confidence in the team they
!iope will win. Neither writers,
rooters, nor players have a right to
expect a smashing victory, because
the Cougars have a much finer
team than their scores or conference
landing would indicate.
Yes, they only tied U.S.C., the
team that bowed to the Cards 6-7
last week, but it was only a fluke
that prevented the Northerners from
making four yards in three downs
across the Trojan goal-line.
Washington State College will
bring to Stanford as fine a defen
sive line as the Cards have had
to penetrate this season. Although
the two teams are evenly matched
in line weight, conference teams
that have scored 27 points against
Stanford's defense have garnered
only 14 against the Cougars.
Coach Babe Hollingbery's left
tackle, Bob Grimstead, is probably
the best tackle and one of the best
linemen on the Coast. And the Cou
gar line is further strengthened by
any pair of three fine guards, A1
Hoptowit, Chuck Semancik, and
Bob Campbell.

COUGARS HAVE TWO
TKIPLE-TIIREAT MEN

At left half, Coach Hollingbery
has two equally talented triple
threat men in Ed Bayne and Paul
Callow. Their long suit is kicking.
Each has booted 72 yards in con
ference competition this season, and
all their kicks uphold a consistently
good average.
As passers, Bayne and Callow
might easily outdo Indian tossers as
they have performed this season.
But it is likely that Bill Paulman
will step back to do the passing for

the Cards more often than he has
before—which should give Stanford
the edge in passing.
Probably the equal of any line-
I plunger on the Coast is Carl Lit
tlefield. Cougar fullback. Al
though be tops tbe scales at a
cool 200 pounds, be is still tbe
fastest runner in tbe Washington
State backficld.
Opponents of the Cougars this sea
son have been known to play in
toward center to keep Littlefield in
harness. Then the boys from Pull
man pull an end run out of the bag,
and have the defense completely
foiled.
So you see Washington State Col
lege is sending no slipshod ball club
down here tomorrow. And if the
Stanford boys get the idea that this
will be only a stopover on their
way to a Big Game victory, they
will find themselves on the short
end of tomorrow's final score, and
out of the running for the confer
ence crown.

STANFORD GRIDDERS
WILL DON NEW PADS

The ball players are going smooth
on us. Instead of the familiar ma
roon jackets they receive annually
for some particular game, this year's
Columbia memoire will be a stylish
red sport coat with a herring-bone
weave. On the pocket will be an
appropriate Palo Alto tree, symbolic
of Stanford.
Tbe tailors measured the shoul
ders for padding where necessary, so
that ignorant laymen will not take
the manly gridders for the Stanford
Glee Club.

< ncounters with Stanford riders
this year. Although this afternoon's
.! ame looks like a toss-up, the score
is hard to predict because San Ma
i .'o uses a different team in almost
every game.

f OC'CER AND Alii
MEET AT BERKELEY

Tomorrow morning the Card soc
t er team will meet the University of
California aggregation at Berkeley
to decide the leading team of the
league. California has an excellent
Uam this year, but the Indians have
•;'one just as far. It looks like a
toss-up. Results will depend upon
which team is hot.
Sunday afternoon Stanford flyers
will hop into planes and go up to
ihe Oakland Airport to take part in
the first Big Meet in the air. Cal
.Myers have been organized for only
a month, and already 80 airmen
have turned out to compete against
Stanford's 30.
Card aviators have few worries,
however, because they are still the
leading group of student flyers in
the United States. It will be a
Stanford victory by a large margin.

TOMORROW'S GAME
WILL BE NO SNAP

Daily forecasters count on a 13-7
win over Washington tomorrow, but
remember that sports writers have
•jreatest confidence in the team they
!iope will win. Neither writers,
rooters, nor players have a right to
expect a smashing victory, because
the Cougars have a much finer
team than their scores or conference
landing would indicate.
Yes, they only tied U.S.C., the
team that bowed to the Cards 6-7
last week, but it was only a fluke
that prevented the Northerners from
making four yards in three downs
across the Trojan goal-line.
Washington State College will
bring to Stanford as fine a defen
sive line as the Cards have had
to penetrate this season. Although
the two teams are evenly matched
in line weight, conference teams
that have scored 27 points against
Stanford's defense have garnered
only 14 against the Cougars.
Coach Babe Hollingbery's left
tackle, Bob Grimstead, is probably
the best tackle and one of the best
linemen on the Coast. And the Cou
gar line is further strengthened by
any pair of three fine guards, A1
Hoptowit, Chuck Semancik, and
Bob Campbell.

COUGARS HAVE TWO
TKIPLE-TIIREAT MEN

At left half, Coach Hollingbery
has two equally talented triple
threat men in Ed Bayne and Paul
Callow. Their long suit is kicking.
Each has booted 72 yards in con
ference competition this season, and
all their kicks uphold a consistently
good average.
As passers, Bayne and Callow
might easily outdo Indian tossers as
they have performed this season.
But it is likely that Bill Paulman
will step back to do the passing for

the Cards more often than he has
before—which should give Stanford
the edge in passing.
Probably the equal of any line-
I plunger on the Coast is Carl Lit
tlefield. Cougar fullback. Al
though be tops tbe scales at a
cool 200 pounds, be is still tbe
fastest runner in tbe Washington
State backficld.
Opponents of the Cougars this sea
son have been known to play in
toward center to keep Littlefield in
harness. Then the boys from Pull
man pull an end run out of the bag,
and have the defense completely
foiled.
So you see Washington State Col
lege is sending no slipshod ball club
down here tomorrow. And if the
Stanford boys get the idea that this
will be only a stopover on their
way to a Big Game victory, they
will find themselves on the short
end of tomorrow's final score, and
out of the running for the confer
ence crown.

STANFORD GRIDDERS
WILL DON NEW PADS

The ball players are going smooth
on us. Instead of the familiar ma
roon jackets they receive annually
for some particular game, this year's
Columbia memoire will be a stylish
red sport coat with a herring-bone
weave. On the pocket will be an
appropriate Palo Alto tree, symbolic
of Stanford.
Tbe tailors measured the shoul
ders for padding where necessary, so
that ignorant laymen will not take
the manly gridders for the Stanford
Glee Club.

FULL WEEK-END

Stanford's Stadium, Highway
Field, and Encina Pools, plus Ber
keley's soccer field and airport
make up a scene of great athletic
activity this week-end, as Stanford
isthletes take part in five tell-tale
i ontests today, tomorrow, and Sun
c.'ay.
Topping today's list will be two
water polo games this afternoon
\ ith San Jose State. The Card jun
ior varsity is expected to gain a de
( sive victory over the Spartans, but
ii.' at half time the victory looks
questionable, Coach Nort Thornton
iilay throw his first string varsity
c mibination to save the name of the

I reliminary against San Jose neo-
I hytes. The game will be closer to
; toss-up, but a good showing of the
; oung Redskins in scrimmage against
the varsity this week gives them the
edge.
Bruin swimmers will be out to
repeat the X-G victory they gar
nered against the Cards at Los
Angeles last week-end. But this
lime they'll be playing in a large
pool, to which the Indians are ac
customed instead of tbe small
pool, in which U.C.L.A. won only
through a sudden defensive
weakness in Stanford's last two
minutes of play.
U.C.L.A. is the only team to de
' .»at the Cards since Nort shuffled

by a small margin.

Washington State College will
bring to Stanford as fine a defen
sive line as the Cards have had
to penetrate this season. Although
the two teams are evenly matched
in line weight, conference teams
that have scored 27 points against
Stanford's defense have garnered
only 14 against the Cougars.
Coach Babe Hollingbery's left
tackle, Bob Grimstead, is probably
the best tackle and one of the best
linemen on the Coast. And the Cou
gar line is further strengthened by
any pair of three fine guards, A1
Hoptowit, Chuck Semancik, and
Bob Campbell.

COUGARS HAVE TWO
TKIPLE-TIIREAT MEN

At left half, Coach Hollingbery
has two equally talented triple
threat men in Ed Bayne and Paul
Callow. Their long suit is kicking.
Each has booted 72 yards in con
ference competition this season, and
all their kicks uphold a consistently
good average.
As passers, Bayne and Callow
might easily outdo Indian tossers as
they have performed this season.
But it is likely that Bill Paulman
will step back to do the passing for

the Cards more often than he has
before—which should give Stanford
the edge in passing.
Probably the equal of any line-
I plunger on the Coast is Carl Lit
tlefield. Cougar fullback. Al
though be tops tbe scales at a
cool 200 pounds, be is still tbe
fastest runner in tbe Washington
State backficld.
Opponents of the Cougars this sea
son have been known to play in
toward center to keep Littlefield in
harness. Then the boys from Pull
man pull an end run out of the bag,
and have the defense completely
foiled.
So you see Washington State Col
lege is sending no slipshod ball club
down here tomorrow. And if the
Stanford boys get the idea that this
will be only a stopover on their
way to a Big Game victory, they
will find themselves on the short
end of tomorrow's final score, and
out of the running for the confer
ence crown.

STANFORD GRIDDERS
WILL DON NEW PADS

The ball players are going smooth
on us. Instead of the familiar ma
roon jackets they receive annually
for some particular game, this year's
Columbia memoire will be a stylish
red sport coat with a herring-bone
weave. On the pocket will be an
appropriate Palo Alto tree, symbolic
of Stanford.
Tbe tailors measured the shoul
ders for padding where necessary, so
that ignorant laymen will not take
the manly gridders for the Stanford
Glee Club.

FULL WEEK-END

Stanford's Stadium, Highway
Field, and Encina Pools, plus Ber
keley's soccer field and airport
make up a scene of great athletic
activity this week-end, as Stanford
isthletes take part in five tell-tale
i ontests today, tomorrow, and Sun
c.'ay.
Topping today's list will be two
water polo games this afternoon
\ ith San Jose State. The Card jun
ior varsity is expected to gain a de
( sive victory over the Spartans, but
ii.' at half time the victory looks
questionable, Coach Nort Thornton
iilay throw his first string varsity
c mibination to save the name of the
ludinas. Stanford frosh will play a
I reliminary against San Jose neo-
I hytes. The game will be closer to
; toss-up, but a good showing of the
; oung Redskins in scrimmage against
the varsity this week gives them the
edge.
Bruin swimmers will be out to
repeat the X-G victory they gar
nered against the Cards at Los
Angeles last week-end. But this
lime they'll be playing in a large
pool, to which the Indians are ac
customed instead of tbe small
pool, in which U.C.L.A. won only
through a sudden defensive
weakness in Stanford's last two
minutes of play.
U.C.L.A. is the only team to de
' .»at the Cards since Nort shuffled
Jie line-up and introduced a new
(.flense that has worked with great
i fficiency. So the Cards should win
by a small margin.
On the Highway Field this after
; oon, the Indian horsemen will meet
!san Mateo for the fourth time. The
visitors have won three out of four
< ncounters with Stanford riders
this year. Although this afternoon's
.! ame looks like a toss-up, the score
is hard to predict because San Ma
i .'o uses a different team in almost
every game.

f OC'CER AND Alii
MEET AT BERKELEY

Tomorrow morning the Card soc
t er team will meet the University of
California aggregation at Berkeley
to decide the leading team of the
league. California has an excellent
Uam this year, but the Indians have
•;'one just as far. It looks like a
toss-up. Results will depend upon
which team is hot.
Sunday afternoon Stanford flyers
will hop into planes and go up to
ihe Oakland Airport to take part in
the first Big Meet in the air. Cal
.Myers have been organized for only
a month, and already 80 airmen
have turned out to compete against
Stanford's 30.
Card aviators have few worries,
however, because they are still the
leading group of student flyers in
the United States. It will be a
Stanford victory by a large margin.

TOMORROW'S GAME
WILL BE NO SNAP

Daily forecasters count on a 13-7
win over Washington tomorrow, but
remember that sports writers have
•jreatest confidence in the team they
!iope will win. Neither writers,
rooters, nor players have a right to
expect a smashing victory, because
the Cougars have a much finer
team than their scores or conference
landing would indicate.
Yes, they only tied U.S.C., the
team that bowed to the Cards 6-7
last week, but it was only a fluke
that prevented the Northerners from
making four yards in three downs

So you see Washington State Col
lege is sending no slipshod ball club
down here tomorrow. And if the
Stanford boys get the idea that this
will be only a stopover on their
way to a Big Game victory, they
will find themselves on the short
end of tomorrow's final score, and
out of the running for the confer
ence crown.

STANFORD GRIDDERS
WILL DON NEW PADS

The ball players are going smooth
on us. Instead of the familiar ma
roon jackets they receive annually
for some particular game, this year's
Columbia memoire will be a stylish
red sport coat with a herring-bone
weave. On the pocket will be an
appropriate Palo Alto tree, symbolic
of Stanford.
Tbe tailors measured the shoul
ders for padding where necessary, so
that ignorant laymen will not take
the manly gridders for the Stanford
Glee Club.
—Shallenberger
