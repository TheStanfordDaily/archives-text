# Water Squad Set To Duck Bruins in Fray
## Big Splash Scheduled For Saturday; Cards Face Crucial Contest 
### 
All that the Stanford water polo
team has to do to retain the confer
ence championship is to beat U.C.
L.A. in a game at Encina Pools Sat
urday morning and then lick the
undefeated California squad in two
straight games next week.
What is worrying Coach Nort
Thornton is how he can inspire his
team to come back against an outfit
that has already beaten them once.
The Bruins displayed a fast break
ing game down south in which their
sensational sprint, Devere Christen
sen, didn't lose a single race for the
ball.
Stanford should have a definite
advantage in one forward spot
where Johnny Lamb will cavort, and
in either a guard or forward post
with Captain Bill Hanna defending
his All-Coast Jaurels. One other po
sition, that of goalie, will also be an
Indian sign if Bill Burns outplays
Bruin Walt Woods as he did in the
first meeting.
The other four positions are toss
ups with a posibility of Stanford's
new men getting inspired into sub
merging the Bruins. Bob Plate at
sprint and Dick Hoover at guard are
Thornton's sophomores who may
surprise. Jack Vibert and Harv
Rothschild at guard and forward
will complete the local lineup.
The Saturday game has been set
for 11 o'clock with no preliminary on
the program.
San Jose State brings up two
teams this afternoon at 3:15 o'clock
to do battle with the Card frosh and
a combination of jayvees and var
sity. Thornton doesn't plan to use his
varsity unless the Spartans prove too
good for the junior varsity.
Admission to games on both days
is free.
