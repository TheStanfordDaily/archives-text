# Daily Dopes-sters Pick Stanford Over Cougars
## 
### 
Now don't say you aren't the
luckiest ones! Because here comes
another one of the Daily's terrific
(meaning colossal, wise guy) grid
prediction yarns. Isn't our average
a simply super .656? Ya can't lose!
And to set you off to a good start,
so that you'll have lots of oughday
to play with, here's the good news
from right at home. The crystal
clears, and it's Stanford over Wash
ington State, 13-7.
Bury 'Em Deep
In the turfless Multnomah Sta
dium, the California Grave-Diggers
Association will take their shovels
(patched from last week's crack
up) and bury eleven Oregonians very
deep, 20-7.
U.S.C. infantry is going to be just
too much for the Oregon State avia
tors. Just one touchdown too much,
to be exact. Schindler and Co. will
bash out a 13-7 win over Joe "The
Ghost" Gray and Co.
Bruins Blasted
The heroes of last week's farce in
Strawberry Canyon — the Washing
ton Huskies — are on their way at
last. The victims this time are the
U.C.L.A. Bruins (in the person of
Kenny Washington), 14-7.

And we mustn't forget the Little
Big Game. We, the scribes, do
hereby guarantee — in fact, we're
betting our collective roll (23 cents
and one slug)—that the Broncs will
outbuck the Galloping Gaels by no
more and no less than two touch
downs. Santa Clara 14, St. Marys 0.

The other home-town team, U.S.F
will massacre Portland U., 20-0
Here's how the individual dopes
