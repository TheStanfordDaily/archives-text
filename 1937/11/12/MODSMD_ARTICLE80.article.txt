# Newcomers Take Spotlight In Card Boxing Tourney
## Fight Finals Include Two T.K.O. Wins Kimball, Ryan Victors; John West Gets Nod Over Hampton Poole 
### 
Jack Ryan and Park Kimball, a
couple- of newcomers to Stanford
boxing, stole the show in last night's
program of finals in the Novice
Boxing Tournament held in the Pa
vilion.
The heavyweight feature between
Hampton Poole and John West
failed to materialize into the fight
expected, West taking a close deci
sion with neither man connecting a
telling blow.
Zooks tiring Laughs
In an exhibition comedy wrest
ling match between the grappling
and boxing finals, the Zook twins,
former Card fighters, did everything
but kill each other in the ring, and
in addition mauled Referee Bill !
O'Neil plenty. Not content with the !
time allowed them, the Zooks chas
ed each other right out of the Pa
vilion. t
Both Kimball and Ryan showed i
all the fire that is essential in a |
good fighter, and with some more
experience these two should develop
a long way. In the 139-lb. class
Kimball scored a technical K.O.
over George Simonds, throwing bat
tering rights all over his opponent's
face and body.
Southpaw Beaten
Ryan also came through with a |
technical knockout when he pushed >
Southpaw Walter Ralphs all over the [
ring before landing several fatal j
rights to the jaw.
Prior to the main events, Stan- |
ford's Gym Club gave an exhibi- I
tion in tumbling and on the paral- |
lei bars. Bill Granice looked par- i
ticularly good in pulling off a ,
couple of standing front somer- |
saults.
