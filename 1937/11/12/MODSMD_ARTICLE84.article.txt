# Chi O's, Pi Phis Lead Mural Race
## 
### 
Winners of all their games in their
divisions of women's intramural bas
ketball, Chi Omega and Pi Phi have
come out on' top in Divisions One
and Three, respectively.
In the other three divisions, the
teams from various other women's
living groups are still battling fierce
ly to determine who will meet Chi O
and Pi Phi in the play-offs for the
intramural finals.
Kappa and Theta are tied in Di
vision Two, both teams having won
two games. Though in the same di
vision, these two rivals did not have
a chance to play each other, Theta
defaulting to Kappa because all the
Thetas were in the Rest Home the

day the game was scheduled.
In Division Four one of the four
Roble teams, led by June Murphy, is
ahead, having won two of its three
games, while Union Residence is
leading in Division Five, with two
games to its credit.
