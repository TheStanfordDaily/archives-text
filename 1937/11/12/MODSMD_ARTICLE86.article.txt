# Farm Poloists Play Peninsula Squad Today
## 
### 
Weather permitting, at 3 o'clock
this afternoon Captain Grubb's Card
polo team will ride out on the high
way field to meet the San Mateo
Polo Club in their fourth return
match. The Peninsula group is now
one up on the Indians, having won
two out of three games played.
The new Farm shift in positions
apparently is not clicking so well yet
as the Indians were defeated here
Wednesday 6-5 by the San Jose Polo
Club. High score man for the Gar
den City team was Pat Linfoot, a
new member, with three goals.
High score man for the Cards wils
Steve Downey.
The Farm roster in today's game
will probably consist of Jim Fuller
ton, Don McAusland, Steve Downey,
Bob Wallace, and Don McClintock,
alternate. Members of the Penin
sula club making the trip will prob
ably be George Pope, Bill Gilmore,
Lloyd Dinkelspiel, and Frank Ful
ler. The Indians are seeking the
best possible combination to meet
the University of Arizona at Tucson
luring Thanksgiving vacationâ€”the
big game for polo.
