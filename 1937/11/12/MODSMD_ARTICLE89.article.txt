# Intersectional Wars Top Grid Program
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Football guns all over the coun
try, booming a 21-gun salute to grid
fans and Armistice celebrations,
will this week-end let fly with a
killer-diller of a schedule, topped
by intersectional warfare on the
eastern front.
Pittsburgh, which replaced Cal in
first spot in national ratings by vir
tue of its powerhouse win over
Notre Dame last week, plays hot to
the Nebraska Cornhuskers. the Mid
west's top team. The Panthers, tri
umphant in last New Year's Day
Rose Bowl battle, seem to be aiming
for another trip West, and a loss
this Saturday would be a major set
back. But Pitt followers don't seem
to be worrying very much.
Irish Turn East
Notre Dame, the up-and-down
team of the season, likewise heads
East, where, in the other intersec
tional colossus, they take on the
Army Mules. This game promises to
be a battle, since both elevens are
on a par — above medium strength,
but neither terrific or lousy. And
it's already a sell-out.
On the home stamping grounds,
game-of-the-week - is without a
doubt the Little Big Game —Santa
Clara and St. Mary's. Here's a bat
tle that is always a humdinger in
every sense of the word.
The Broncs—seventh in national
ranks—are unbeaten and ufitied.

Winners of the last Sugar Bowl
' game, they're heading down South
j once again.
The Galloping Gaels haven't such
an imposing slate to yell about as
that of Santa Clara. BUT, St. Mary's
| can't be depended upon to go as
i predicted. AND. in a game with the
' Broncs. anything can happen, and
probably will.
Then there's the Cal-Oregon
; game, which will most likely be
p.ayed in a stadium full of gooey
, morass a la mode. It's scheduled
for Multnomah Stadium in Oregon,
I where rain is really rain—especially
j when it's coming down on a non
turf field.
Stub Allison is of the opinion that
j the Webfeet will score about once,
I and he's counting on Cal's superior
j punch to cross the goal line enough
j times to outpoint the Ducks.
Kenny Against Huskies
Kenny Washington plays the Hus
i kies. He will be helped out a little
I by the rest of the U.C.L.A. team,
j What a player that guy is! He's as
! good as Bottari any day. He is the
| spark of the U.C.L.A. machine, and
| one spark isn't enough — the ex
; champs of 'the Coast shouldn't have
I much trouble.
j Southern Cal meets Oregon State
jin a toss-up game. Each eleven has
j enough power—Troy on the ground
1 and the Beavers through the air—to
push over one touchdown. The out
come seems to depend on that all
important conversion.
