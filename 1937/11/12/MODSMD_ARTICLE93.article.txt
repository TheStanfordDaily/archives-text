## When Indian Scalps Indian 
### 
IN sports writers' jargon there has been many
a Stanford Indian scalping party, but never
one such as was held on the Post Office steps
yesterday morning.
The sleepy Stanford Farm turned out to be
adequately stocked with city slickers, and Dra
matic Manager Clay McDaniel is the scapegoat
of the deal.
By noon yesterday, the "righteous indigna
tion" of several hundred Stanford people who
faced a closed window for Big Game Gaieties
tickets after the house was sold out in two hours
and a half, was aimed at the wrong party. Mc-
Daniel was accused of axe-grinding—promis
ing seats to especial parties before the sale
opened. It was not McDaniel's axe-grinding that
promoted the early sell-out.
Condemnation goes to the dozen or so ticket
scalpers whose block purchases wiped up the
house.
Here are the facts concerning yesterday's
sale.
At 9 o'clock in the morning, all but 150 seats
in the 1732-seat house went on sale at the Post
Office. The 150 seats went to members of the
cast, faculty, complimentaries, S.A.E.'s, and
friends of McDaniel. The Dramatic Manager is
entitled to withhold that number. It is consider
ably less than that of previous years.
Nearly 1600 seats lasted until exactly 11:30
when the house was sold completely. It is esti
mated that only about 300 reached the window.
1600 seats to 300 students. Blocks of 50 or more
were sold.
The Dramatic Manager is not to be blamed for
such block sales. The practice has been custom
ary in recent years to allow various organiza
tions to make their purchases through one man.
It is the abuse of that block-purchase privilege
which must be stopped. Ticket scalping, which

reached its peak at Stanford yesterday, must
be checked.
First step in that check has been taken in the
scheduling of a second performance of the Gaie
ties for Friday afternoon at reduced prices. This
may cut the demand for Gaieties seats and dis
courage scalpers who last night were asking,
and getting, five dollars a pair. It should also
take care of the waiting list of nearly one hun
dred who signed as willing to pay "any price"
for seats.
Second check in the racket should come
through unified student refusal to pay more than
list price for seats to the evening performance.
Scalpers lose their nerve when performance
date nears and the cards still are unsold. To
expect complete co-operative effort here is ideal
istic and near-impossible as unsuccessful boy
cott campaigns at Stanford indicate, but the
scalping racket can be dealt a rap if would-be
Gaieties attenders refuse to "suck" on the ex
orbitant rates.
Third means of check must come in future
Gaieties sales when a limit on number of tickets
per purchaser is set, similar to the rooters' sale
of Big Games. But even here, as has been shov/n
by the recent scalping of Big Game seats, Stan
ford has its commercialists who will capitalize
on the situation, gather a handful of dues cards,
and clean up on the deal.
Scalping of seats admittedly goes on wher
ever seats are sold in quantities. Stanford in the
past has been mildly afflicted.
But this recent scourge, which might have
denied half of Stanford's potential Gaieties au
dience the right to admittance at regular prices,
is too much.
Ticket scalpers must be personally con
demned, and financially foiled. Stanford is
forced to clean up its ticket business.
Mass scalping must stop.

The sleepy Stanford Farm turned out to be
adequately stocked with city slickers, and Dra
matic Manager Clay McDaniel is the scapegoat
of the deal.
By noon yesterday, the "righteous indigna
tion" of several hundred Stanford people who
faced a closed window for Big Game Gaieties
tickets after the house was sold out in two hours
and a half, was aimed at the wrong party. Mc-
Daniel was accused of axe-grinding—promis
ing seats to especial parties before the sale
opened. It was not McDaniel's axe-grinding that
promoted the early sell-out.
Condemnation goes to the dozen or so ticket
scalpers whose block purchases wiped up the
house.
Here are the facts concerning yesterday's
sale.
At 9 o'clock in the morning, all but 150 seats
in the 1732-seat house went on sale at the Post
Office. The 150 seats went to members of the
cast, faculty, complimentaries, S.A.E.'s, and
friends of McDaniel. The Dramatic Manager is
entitled to withhold that number. It is consider
ably less than that of previous years.
Nearly 1600 seats lasted until exactly 11:30
when the house was sold completely. It is esti
mated that only about 300 reached the window.
1600 seats to 300 students. Blocks of 50 or more
were sold.
The Dramatic Manager is not to be blamed for
such block sales. The practice has been custom
ary in recent years to allow various organiza
tions to make their purchases through one man.
It is the abuse of that block-purchase privilege
which must be stopped. Ticket scalping, which

reached its peak at Stanford yesterday, must
be checked.
First step in that check has been taken in the
scheduling of a second performance of the Gaie
ties for Friday afternoon at reduced prices. This
may cut the demand for Gaieties seats and dis
courage scalpers who last night were asking,
and getting, five dollars a pair. It should also
take care of the waiting list of nearly one hun
dred who signed as willing to pay "any price"
for seats.
Second check in the racket should come
through unified student refusal to pay more than
list price for seats to the evening performance.
Scalpers lose their nerve when performance
date nears and the cards still are unsold. To
expect complete co-operative effort here is ideal
istic and near-impossible as unsuccessful boy
cott campaigns at Stanford indicate, but the
scalping racket can be dealt a rap if would-be
Gaieties attenders refuse to "suck" on the ex
orbitant rates.
Third means of check must come in future
Gaieties sales when a limit on number of tickets
per purchaser is set, similar to the rooters' sale
of Big Games. But even here, as has been shov/n
by the recent scalping of Big Game seats, Stan
ford has its commercialists who will capitalize
on the situation, gather a handful of dues cards,
and clean up on the deal.
Scalping of seats admittedly goes on wher
ever seats are sold in quantities. Stanford in the
past has been mildly afflicted.
But this recent scourge, which might have
denied half of Stanford's potential Gaieties au
dience the right to admittance at regular prices,
is too much.
Ticket scalpers must be personally con
demned, and financially foiled. Stanford is
forced to clean up its ticket business.
Mass scalping must stop.
IN sports writers' jargon there has been many
a Stanford Indian scalping party, but never
one such as was held on the Post Office steps
yesterday morning.
