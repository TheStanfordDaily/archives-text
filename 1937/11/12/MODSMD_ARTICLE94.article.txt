# In Two Lines
## 
### 
IN two short lines the management of the San
Francisco airport has explained all the ro
mance of flying, has graphically suggested all
the color and glamor of the newest of the trans
port industries.
You can read the story any time you drive
along Bayshore. It's on a roadside sign below
the words San Francisco Airport.
New York—ls Hours
Los Angeles—2 Hours
The story could be told more compactly, if
less graphically, in one word—Speed.
Speed builds its own romance. To the last
generation the locomotive was the symbol of
speed, and children played with toy engines,

sang of the exploits of Casey Jones. This gen
eration has changed symbols, uses model
planes instead, but the ideal is the same.
It's the thrill of getting from place to place in
a hurry, man's belief that change of scene is a
change of luck, that the grass is greener on the
other side of the hill.
And the airport sign challenges him with two
lines: New York—ls Hours; Los Angeles—2
Hours. —L. L.
