## THE 						RAIN IS RAINING 
### 
IT'S RAINING as I write this. And over in the
corner of the shack the Thank-God-It's-Friday Club
is rowing about where it should hold its weekly meet
ing. Obviously it is impossible to keep up my end of
the argument and pursue a noble idea through ten
inches of type at the same time. And so with the per
mission of those concerned, I'll skip the noble idea
today. If anybody wants a beautiful bit of philosophy
to brighten up his coffee and snail, I refer him to
Plato, Bergson, and "The Challenge to Liberty."
It is interesting to speculate upon the effects that
the start of the rainy season will have on life in gen
eral. In the grade schools, children are learning songs
about "The rain is raining all around. It falls on field
and tree." They are very proud of themselves when
they master this delightful line; and we can sym
pathize with the glowing joy that engulfs them when
they learn ihe conclusion, "It falls upon umbrellas
here and on the ships at sea." Truly education is a
wonderful thing. We can picture the little children
growing up and going on through life, strengthened
and cheered by the vital message they mastered in
grammar school: "The rain is raining all around."

Weather men have a new set of loops on their maps,
and are as pleased with them as a probationer with a
new grade point. They are drawing lines all over
everything, going into conferences, and coming forth
with the impressive words, "Continued low pressure
areas in the central portions, winds veering ..."
Philosophers if they happen to think of it could
have a beautiful time pointing out what a marvelous
allocation of function this is. If the school boys drew
lines on their maps or went into conferences, they
would have a tete-a-tete with teacher when every
body else went home to look out of the window. If the
weather men should recite, "The rain is raining . . ."
they would probably wind up looking out of barred
windows.

A ND at Stanford we, too, alter our ways of life to
fit the new environment. The rest homes brace
themselves for a capacity clientele. The Kleenex rep
resentativs gloat, and start figuring on a new car.
Fraternity brothers who have lived in concord use
language their mothers never taught them, when a
raincoat turns up missing.
On The Daily, cause and effect will follow through
obviously. Ideas will be scarcer than usual, and they
are already so scarce that there has been talk of of
fering a bounty for them. The reason for this is simple.
The wet weather will deter people from going to the
post office to pick up exchanges. Without exchanges
we will have less—shall we call it stimulation?

Yes, it is interesting to speculate on the part which
rain plays in that causal cone beloved of the philoso
phy department. There is something magnificent and
inexorable about it all, something that suggests a
Greek tragedy.
Personally, I don't find the loss of the "Fair and
continued warm" slug particularly upsetting. The gen
tle patter of Chappie Editor Hartmann's campus opin
ions falling on our editor's desk has kept me in
training.
