Vf/'ITH a void in our pockcts, and misgivings in our
heart, we reluctantly turn to the consideration of
Big Game night. If you follow our example, you'll
hide under the bed, and put Gramma at the door
with a Winchester to fight off the varmints. But then
our example went out with bustles and the Stanley
Steamer.

We have found that Del Monte Big Game night is
one of those Farm things, like the "hell-o" tradition,
or the Cactus Garden—nice, if you can get it. Special
couriers, traveling by pogo-stick and mule traiij, bring
up the distressing word, however, that the latest reser
vation tally shows that the hotel's entire 400 rooms
are filled for the event. Just to make things definite,
hotel authorities state that students must not drive
(or scull, or even hop-step-and-jump without possess
ing three letters from the pastor of their church) to
Del Monte expecting to get dinner-dance reservations
—absolutely none are available.
Don't get the inn-keepers wrong, though—they just
love Stanford, but after a certain point, even shoe
horns can't get you all onto the dance floor. So unless
you have tickets purchased from campus representa
tives—well, come prepared for an early fall.
* # q *
But it's open house in the city—wide open. The
hotels, as you already know, will be just stinking
with humanity. You can go proletariat, and share your
feet with a couple of tired business men and a hand
ful of jolly tars when you dance—if you want to.
Better get your reservations, though, or you'll end up
with just what you deserve.
You've got a sort of alternative, if you must prance,
in some of the clubs—Deauville, Bal Tabarin, and so
on. But on the other hand.
* * * *
| J INNER in the city can be had a dozen or so
places—pick your favorite. There's Pierre's, Cop
pa's, Julius' Castle, Sharows, La Favorite. Or if you
want to stop on the way up, try Villa Chartier in
San Mateo.
For Oriental atmosphere, go to Sukiyaki's, or Twin
Dragons. And for that before-the-drive-home, drop
in at New Joe's for hamburgers or what have you.
* *(« * *
You'll probably end up at one of these places, any
how, so we might as well come right out and recog
nize a few of the canteens. El Prado, La Fiesta, Riviera,
Seven Seas, and so on will give you that certain aroma.
But let someone else drive.
For an up-and-up, in-and-out, whip-dip of an
evening, though, we'll take the wide open spaces of
the Beach. You might start out at Topsy's and then
wheel out with the sky the limit. Wo always get
sick on that fool pendulum ride, but it's sure fun,
Gramps. And besides, it costs so much less.

with just what you deserve.
You've got a sort of alternative, if you must prance,
in some of the clubs—Deauville, Bal Tabarin, and so

places—pick your favorite. There's Pierre's, Cop
pa's, Julius' Castle, Sharows, La Favorite. Or if you
want to stop on the way up, try Villa Chartier in
San Mateo.
For Oriental atmosphere, go to Sukiyaki's, or Twin
Dragons. And for that before-the-drive-home, drop
in at New Joe's for hamburgers or what have you.

You'll probably end up at one of these places, any

Seven Seas, and so on will give you that certain aroma.
But let someone else drive.
For an up-and-up, in-and-out, whip-dip of an
evening, though, we'll take the wide open spaces of
the Beach. You might start out at Topsy's and then
wheel out with the sky the limit. Wo always get
sick on that fool pendulum ride, but it's sure fun,
Gramps. And besides, it costs so much less.

We have found that Del Monte Big Game night is
one of those Farm things, like the "hell-o" tradition,
or the Cactus Garden—nice, if you can get it. Special
couriers, traveling by pogo-stick and mule traiij, bring
up the distressing word, however, that the latest reser
vation tally shows that the hotel's entire 400 rooms
are filled for the event. Just to make things definite,
hotel authorities state that students must not drive
(or scull, or even hop-step-and-jump without possess
ing three letters from the pastor of their church) to
Del Monte expecting to get dinner-dance reservations
—absolutely none are available.
Don't get the inn-keepers wrong, though—they just
love Stanford, but after a certain point, even shoe
horns can't get you all onto the dance floor. So unless
you have tickets purchased from campus representa
tives—well, come prepared for an early fall.
