# Bonner Novel Suggested As Light Reading
## 
### 
Charles Bonner's "BULL BY THE
HORNS'' is a study of the professo
rial mind on the loose, and, as such,
has a certain amount of interest for

a student audience
—if one is willing
to believe in Mr.
Bonner's charac
ters and in the
circumstances in
which they find
themselves, that is
Bradbury Prit
chard is a mild,
mild soul, teach
ing English Lit in
a mild, mild col
lege, somewhere
in New England.
When he makes

the mistake of telling the graduating
class what is wrong with academic
life, he has no course but io leave,
which he does at once, finding haven
in New Hampshire.
In New Hampshire, Bradbury out
rages the Puritan community of Sus
sex by falling in love with a daugh
ter of Nature named Susannah, and
when they flee from the outraged
world, it pursues them across the
continent to California with head
lines a yard high.
The book ends in the snug harbor
of the ranch belonging to Bradbury's
grandfather; and Bradbury, having
grasped the bull—life —by the horns,
has found the happiness he had al
most lost in the secluded atmos
phere of South bury College.
On the whole Mr. Bonner's book
is as gentle and harmless as its hero.
Full of interesting and well-drawn
characters, it is not the sort of book
for heavy reading; but if you're in a
light-headed mood, or perhaps just
recovering from a midquarter, it
isn't bad.
