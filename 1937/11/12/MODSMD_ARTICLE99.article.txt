# Farm Players Make Hit In Austen Drama
## 
### 
The dramatization of Jane Aus
ten's novel "Pride and Prejudice,"
presented by the Palo Alto Commu
nity Players last night, delighted an
audience which saw many Stanford
students outstanding in the cast.
Starring in the role of charming,
intelligent Elizabeth Bennet was
Barbara Pearson, wife of Drama Di
rector Gordon C. Lange. Jack Gillus,
prominent in many Stanford pro
ductions, gave a beautifully re
strained performance as the proud
lover. Ray Hornby carried off his
first performance with case, as did
Mildred Green, the fluttering young
est daughter. Veteran Frances Far
mer made the most of a small part.
Staging of the play was excellent,
as were performances by many
other members of the cast. Slight
hutching of lines in the first two
scenes marred an otherwise fine per
formance. Credit should be given
the technical crew for remarkably
quick scene changing.
The play will again be presented
tonight and tomorrow night at the
Community Playhouse at 8:15.
