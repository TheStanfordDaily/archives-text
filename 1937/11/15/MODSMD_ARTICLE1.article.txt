# Novel Floats To Lead Big Game Parade
## Cal Funeral Will Start At Fiji House, Wind To Fire on Lake Bed 
### 
The Farm's best foot will be way
ahead of the other one Thursday
night in a pre-Big Game funeral
procession worthy of the touted Cal
wonder team. Floats sponsored by
living groups, Indians riding R.O.
T.C. horses will make up the bulk
of the parade.
Big Game Rally has been changed
from Lagunita to the Pavilion, ac
cording to a statement made late
last night by Rally Committee Chair
man Don Dewar. If the lake-bed
dries out by the end of the week,
the decision may be reversed, the
Rally held on Lagunita after all.
Starting from the Fiji house, the
procession will wind down the Row
to the Pavilion for the Rally, then
go to Lagunita for the Bonfire.
In charge of arrangements for the
parade is Isabel Goldthwaite, wom
en's chairman of Rally Committee,
who announced last night that all
campus organizations are urged to
enter floats. These may be built on
cars or trucks, need not be elabo
rate but should carry out the Big
Game idea. Organizations inter
ested should get in touch with Miss
Goldthwaite.
Buggy Is Feature
The Roble baby buggy will be a
feature of the parade. Other groups
already arranging floats are Lagu
nita Court, Alpha Delt, D.U., Kappa,
Dee Gee, Chi O, and Sigma Chi.
The Rally will begin as soon as
the parade reaches the Pavilion.
There will be songs, yells, and
speeches.
The Bonfire will be touched off
immediately after the Rally. Ed Bar
nett, Bonfire chairman, announced
yesterday that trucks will be avail
able today for collecting material.
Frosh volunteer collectors will be
picked up between 1 and 1:30 o'clock
today at Encina.
Lay Foundation
A foundation of telephone poles
will be laid on the lake-bed this
morning by the Redwood City crew
of the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany. The Horabin Lumber and
Fuel Company has donated oil for
the Bonfire.
Actual work will start Wednesday
when the construction committee
puts up the sides of the Bonfire,
ready for the finishing touches on
Thursday by more frosh volunteers.
Frosh women will serve lunch to the
workers Thursday.
