# Critics Snatch Encina Basso From Concert
## 
### ED LAWRENCE 
Ruthlessly snatched from Enicna |
and stopped in the middle of a lusty !
and not too profound concert, a !
young basso was kidnapped by un- j
appreciative critics, last Saturday, |
and taken for a ride that ended j
only when Paly police caught up
with the get-away car.
The amazed frosh victim has ,
probably always believed that music
soothes the savage beast, but failed
to recognize that it can also stir the j
placid heart to vicious reprisal, when j
the melody is just a little too rauc- i
ous and disturbing.
Practically Mobbed
Clad only in flimsy shorts but i
covered by a blanket, the virtuoso j
was bound to his bed and gagged j
with a towel. The bed was carried
from the third floor room, loaded
into a waiting phaeton, and whisked
toward town.
An exceptionally alert night
watchman saw the abduction and
telephoned the Paly cops.
Every night the aspiring vocalist
sings at least one song for the boys
in the Bull Pen, but when he start
ed on what promised to be a full
fledged concert, Saturday evening,
the very timber of his voice gave
room mates an idea that the high
way to fame had so far been too !
smooth for the aspirant.
Throw Boulders
They decided to throw a few j
boulders in the way, and, incidental- I
ly, postpone the debut until four or
five years hence.
Refusing to invoke the full pen
alties of the Lindbergh law, the
maestro deprecatingly remarked to
officers who rescued him, "Don't be
too hard on the boys, it was only a I
dirty trick. After all, all great sing- j
ers have to pioneer through many I
hardships on their road to fame."
