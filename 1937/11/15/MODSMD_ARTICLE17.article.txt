## Nippon Reinforcements March on Shanghai; Soochow Threatened 
### 
SHANGHAI Monday), Nov. 15
(U.R).â€”Japan threw a fourth army
into the three-months-old battle of
Shanghai today, smashed through
China's "Hindenburg Line" in four
more places, and simultaneously
launched a secret peace offensive de
signed to take advantage of the de
moralized Chinese defenses and
bring about an early armistice.
Tanks Advance
Soochow, key to the 65-miles-long
"Hindenburg Line" built under the
supervision of German army engi
neers to defend the Chinese capital
Nanking, was menaced by mechan
ized Japanese columns advancing
from the north, east and south.
"Organized Chinese military re
sistance," which Japanese have
sworn they will crush before talk
ing peace, appeared to be crumbling
rapidly everywhei - e.
Some Japanese say a possibility of
peace before Christmas.
Germans in Move
There were unconfirmed reports
that Germans, acting in secret, un
official capacities, already were
sounding out leading Chinese, in
cluding Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek, on possibility of an armistice.
It was not believed, however, that
these conversations would be under
taken in vigorous fashion until next
month. By that time the Japanese
army commanders hope to have in
flicted further crushing defeats on
the Chinese that will make even the
most rapid of the leaders of the so
called anti - Japanese movement
ready to lay down their arms.
Landed Sunday
The fourth Japanese army, thrown
into the battle today by Japanese
Commander Lieutenant General
Iwane Matsui, was landed Sunday
around Pai-Maokou, on the left
bank of the Yangtse river about 35
miles northwest of Shanghai.
These troops drove inland in the
rear of Chinese positions to the
southeast, around Liuho, disorganiz
ing the whole Chinese defense sys
tem in the area northwest of Shang
hai.
More than 10 airplanes led the
Japanese advance, bombing and ma
chine - gunning Chinese fleeing
madly from Kaiting and other posi
tions between Shanghai and Soo
chow.
