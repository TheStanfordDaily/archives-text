will be held. The convention will
take place upon the Stanford cam
pus and in San Francisco, where the
alumni chapter has its headquar
ters.
Chester Rowell, editor of the San
Francisco Chronicle, was named
honorary member of the fraternity
in a unanimous resolution passed by
delegates of 55 chapters. Rowell's
recognition was made for "out
standing contributions to journal
ism." The honor is extended every
convention year to one noteworthy
newspaper man who is not a mem

The award to Stanford is based on
the fact that more alumni gradu
ated in the last five years are now
engaged in successful newspaper
work than members of any of the
other 30 chapters in the United
States.
Chilton R. Bush, head of the De
partment of Journalism, in com
menting upon the award, said that
it is based upon the quality of work
being done as well as the number
of graduates participating.
Delegate Botsford, also president
of the local chapter, plans to re
turn to Stanford from Topeka to
morrow.
