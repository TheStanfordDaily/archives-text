# Little Red Roller Smashes Cougars In 23 Point Win
## Stanford Squad Hits First High Peak; Tiny Praises Paulman 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Fourteen thousand football fans saw red Saturday as Tiny Thornhill's
cardinal jerseyed bunch ran thoroughly and enthusiastically over Wash
ington State and boosted Big Game tickets another $5.
The red was not in their eyes. It was on and all over the Stadium
Field against an unmoving background of white.

* Thornhill's boys were hot. They
hit their peak for the first time this
year. They hit Washington State for
23 points, and didn't let Washing
ton State do any hitting at all.
When they got their first score in
the second quarter by sending fast
Pete Fay around left end from the
13-yard marker, where Neil Ras
mussen recovered a bad Cougar
pass from center, and Bill Paulman
converted, Stanford rooters said,
"Well, we've got seven points. But
I wish we'd really win one game
this year."
Talk Too Soon
They thought without imagination
and talked too soon. Even that
early in the game they didn't re
member that the second team had
been doing all the work in the first
quarter, and that most of the time
the first-stringers had been in they
were in the shade of their own goal
posts keeping the Cougars from
scoring after Groves had fumbled
and lost the ball on his own 14. They
forgot that the first string hadn't
had much of a chance yet to show
just what they had.
The ]4.000 began to see the light
early in the second half when Pete
Zagar rushed in to block Bayne's
kick on Stanford's 22, and when
Captain Grant Stone picked up the
blocked ball on the five-yard line
and walked across the goal, with
Paulman again converting.
Scores Field Goal
That 14-0 looked pretty good to
them up on the scoreboard, but in a
I few minutes 17-0 was up there look
ing much better. Because after
Stone made his score, Stanford ex-
( changed kicks with the boys from
up north for a few times and then
moved in to score again. A stub
born Washington Cougar wouldn't
let them go any farther than the 22,
so Bill Paulman stood back on their
31 and kicked a very beautiful field
goal for three points.
The rather skimpy crowd of fans
was beginning to see that this game
was all Stanford's. They knew it
was in a very few minutes when
Pete Fay started on the Cougar 40
and ran, dodged, and stumbled to
within eight yards of pay dirt. They
still knew it even when Hamilton
fumbled on the third try-for-goal
