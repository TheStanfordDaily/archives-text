# Little Red Roller Smashes Cougars In 23 Point Win
## Stanford Squad Hits First High Peak; Tiny Praises Paulman 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Fourteen thousand football fans saw red Saturday as Tiny Thornhill's
cardinal jerseyed bunch ran thoroughly and enthusiastically over Wash
ington State and boosted Big Game tickets another $5.
The red was not in their eyes. It was on and all over the Stadium
Field against an unmoving background of white.

* Thornhill's boys were hot. They
hit their peak for the first time this
year. They hit Washington State for
23 points, and didn't let Washing
ton State do any hitting at all.
When they got their first score in
the second quarter by sending fast
Pete Fay around left end from the
13-yard marker, where Neil Ras
mussen recovered a bad Cougar
pass from center, and Bill Paulman
converted, Stanford rooters said,
"Well, we've got seven points. But
I wish we'd really win one game
this year."
Talk Too Soon
They thought without imagination
and talked too soon. Even that
early in the game they didn't re
member that the second team had
been doing all the work in the first
quarter, and that most of the time
the first-stringers had been in they
were in the shade of their own goal
posts keeping the Cougars from
scoring after Groves had fumbled
and lost the ball on his own 14. They
forgot that the first string hadn't
had much of a chance yet to show
just what they had.
The ]4.000 began to see the light
early in the second half when Pete
Zagar rushed in to block Bayne's
kick on Stanford's 22, and when
Captain Grant Stone picked up the
blocked ball on the five-yard line
and walked across the goal, with
Paulman again converting.
Scores Field Goal
That 14-0 looked pretty good to
them up on the scoreboard, but in a
I few minutes 17-0 was up there look
ing much better. Because after
Stone made his score, Stanford ex-
( changed kicks with the boys from
up north for a few times and then
moved in to score again. A stub
born Washington Cougar wouldn't
let them go any farther than the 22,
so Bill Paulman stood back on their
31 and kicked a very beautiful field
goal for three points.
The rather skimpy crowd of fans
was beginning to see that this game
was all Stanford's. They knew it
was in a very few minutes when
Pete Fay started on the Cougar 40
and ran, dodged, and stumbled to
within eight yards of pay dirt. They
still knew it even when Hamilton
fumbled on the third try-for-goal
play and Washington State took the
ball on their throe-yard marker.
07-yard Run Scores
They knew it because, in about
three minutes, Stanford scored
again. Jimmy Coffis saw a hole at
right tackle when the Indians were
on their own 34, and tore through
out into the open with nothing but
(57 yards and Paul Callow between
him and a touchdown. Jimmy con
tinued to tear right on past Callow
and led him all 65 of those yards
for six more points. Paulman's
kick — his third attempt of the
.ifternoon—was blocked.
That was the end of the scoring
and just about the end of Washing
lon State.
So now Stanford has shown the
big boys from across the bay that
they will have something more than
just a stadium to offer them next
week. They'll be able to give them
their toughest afternoon of the year.
After the game, Tiny Thornhill
praised Bill Paulman and Gene
Coldiron. Paulman showed plenty
of speed and punch in cracking at
the line, and his kicking was very
nice. He didn't get much of a chance
to show how he can pass, because
for some reason neither team elected
to throw the ball around much.
