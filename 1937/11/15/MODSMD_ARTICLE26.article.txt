## 'Governor's Wife' Cast To Be Selected; Play Scheduled for Winter 
### 
First vacation in his Stanford
teaching career will be taken next
quarter by Gordon C. Lange, asso
ciate director of dramatics.
Mr. Lange plans to take a f-ull
quarter's leave, he announced yes
terday, although he is at present se
lecting a cast for a new Department
of Speech and Drama production to
be given during winter quarter. The
play is Benevente's "The Gover
nor's Wife."
According to present plans, the
play will be rehearsed under Mr.
Lunge's direction this quarter and
produced early in January with H.
Miles Heberer supervising. "Trial
by Jury," Gilbert and Sullivan op
eretta shown last month, was Mr.
Heberer's first Stanford production.
As to what sort of a vacation he
will take, or whether he will at
tempt to teach at another univer

"I may try to get a rest, or I may
try to make some money," he said
yesterday.
There will be no addition to the
department staff during Mr. Lange's
absence, according to Lee Emerson
Bassett, head of the department.
Thomas Wood Stevens will remain
at Stanford during Mr. Lange's ab

will be on' leave spring quarter
when Mr. Lange returns.
Both men will teach during next
summer quarter.
