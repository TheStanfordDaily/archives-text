# CAMPUS OPINION
## McDANIEL ON GRIPES 
### 
The Editor, Sir-
In this clearing house of Stanford
gripes I wish to clear the minds of
the "Stanford Masses/' the "Aver
age Stanford Student," "Frustrated,"
"Disgusted," and all other Annoy
eds" and "Gripeds" in regard to the
circumstances of last Thursday's
ticket sale.
First, I am awfully sorry that it is
impossible to put 4000 people into a
1739 seat-capacity theater.
And all the difficulties of the
Thursday's situation had their bases
on this one paradox.
3000 Frustrated
Consequently there are some 3000
people who, unlike in years past, are
rightfully frustrated about missing
the Gaieties.
Overlooking this point entirely
they set about to find one person
whom they think should be respon
sible for their missing the show. Be
ing ill informed, and blindly accus
ing on hunches they pick the dra
matic manager as the cause of their
frustration.
Nut 'Fast and Loose'
To "Frustrated" I say you are
childishly unreasonable. Of course
someone got Gaieties tickets — but
only 1739 out of 4000. I wish to as
sure you that no one has been play
ing fast and loose with your trust
ing faith . . .
To "The Stanford Masses" I say
that I actually know many of the
so-called A.S.S.U. hierarchy and
also in the S.A.E. house who won't
[see Friday night's performance be
i cause they missed the sale, and re-
Ifuse to pay scalpers' prices. Would
j you care for their names?
i No Reservations
I insist that the only fair way to
handle ticket sales is to accept no
advance reservations from the stu
dent public. The A.S.S.U. secretaries
who have to their credit several
years of ticket sale experience will
back me in that statement.
In the past few years the dramatic
managers have accepted advance
reservations and before the tickets
were put on sale, assigned seats to
all who had turned in reservations.
Under the no-advance-reservation
system, the public is given a fair
opportunity to select their own
seats, and the disappointment of not
getting the seats asked for is elim
inated. The public is given full
view of available seats. Rightfully,
enough performances should be
scheduled to supply the demand.
Refuse Scalpers
We shall continue this year in tak
ing no advance reservations. And to
"Disgusted" — you are the flaming
example of the case that encourages
ticket scalping ... If all "disgust
eds" would refuse to pay a scalp
price for tickets you would be help
ful in stamping out scalping. Your
personal condemnation is the
strongest force in stopping it. You
ask for a shake-up — well, Men's
Council is shaking the rotten thing

to the roots. We need only co-opera
tion.
"The Average Stanford . Student"
is the only recorded gripe that gets
to the bottom of the thing when he
recommends selling a limited num
ber of Gaieties tickets with student
body cards. Even that will not
completely eliminate scalping, but it
will cut it down.
No Privileges
But Mr. A. S. S. you accuse with
out proof that certain, "privileged"
Big Shots were allowed to buy
blocks of 60 or more.
No such blocks were reserved.
Such blocks were bought on pub
lic sale, which is very well as long
as the individual is buying them for
other people, and has always been
allowed heretofore. The difficujty
this time was that there was no way
to distinguish those who were rep
resenting a group, from those who
were buying blocks to scalp.
Time Ripe
The time is indeed ripe to crack
down on scalpers, and for the bene
fit of the student body, I ask that
any such cases be reported either
to this office or the Men's Council,
and action will be taken.
So, I shall recommend to the suc
ceeding dramatic manager that more
than one performance must be
scheduled to take care of the in
crease of interest in Stanford dra
matics . . .
And now, friends, you have seen
the circumstances of the case and
the problems confronting a dramatic
manager when the scalper throws
his knife into the tickets machinery,
and I hope you all run along and
enjoy the matinee and evening per
formances of the Big Game Gaieties
of 1937.
Sincerely,
Clay McDaniel
