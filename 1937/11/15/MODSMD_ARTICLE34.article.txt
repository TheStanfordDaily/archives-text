BACK ON THE
JOB AGAIN
Well, here I am back on the old
typewriter after a week's vacation.
That southern expedition was just
a little too much for me. The ordeal
of hitch-hiking down and back has
kept me in a state of dilemma for a
full seven days but I feel that my
thumb is sufficiently healed to en
able me to take over again withoyt
getting caught in the keys.
Oh, yes, I presented the illus
trious Mr. Swent wtih my expense
account for the southern journey
and titled it, ''Sports Editor's con
tribution to Stanford journalism."
TINY'S BOYS KEPT
PACE WITH CAL
Tiny's gridiron warriors kept in
scoring pace with the terrible Bears
Saturday. As the score from Oregon
kept booming forth from the loud
speaker in the local fool ball park,
iho Indians were fighting to keep up
with Cal's scoring power.
The Stanfords only missed it by
three points, and if Bill Paulman
had a few minutes more he might
have made another, field goal to
equal Cal's scoring feat.
..Tiny's boys really c&nie through
to make the Big Game Saturday a
cinch sell-out. The Bears still
have to he classified as the favor
ites, hut it's not going to be any
slaughter, and don't be surprised,
dear breathren of the sporting
world, if Tiny's fighting Indians
dump the high riding Bears off
their hobby horse.
KIRSCH SCORE
CALLED BACK
Stanford might have had another
touchdown in the second quarter
Saturday when Bill Kirseh inter
cepted a Cougar lateral and raced
across the goal line. A fast whistle
called the play off.
Something that's seldom seen in
a college football game paved the
way for Stanford's first score in
the second quarter. The Cougar
center snapped the ball when no
body was in position to receive it
and the pigskin rolled down to
the W.S.C. 13 where Cougar back
Carl Littlefleld fumbled the elu
sive pellet while attempting to fall
on it. Pete Fay scampered around
left end for 11 yards and six
points.
Old Pete Zagar came through with
his usual blocked kick for the sec
ond score. Paulman's place-kick
for those three points in the third
quarter was beautiful to watch. It
(raveled 41 yards in the air and
split the uprights in the dead center
10 feet above the crossbar.
JUMPIN' JIMMINY
MAKES COME-BACK
Little Jimmy Coffis thrilled his
many admirers with a swell come
back performance. Jimmy hasn't
been the Coffis of old this season,
but he sure came back with a ven
geance Saturday. Jumpin' Jimminy
broke through the Cougar left tackle
and raced 66 yards down the field
for a touchdown. He crossed the
goal line wtih that familiar ear-to
ear grin of his.
Fay gave an unbelievable ex
hibition of perfect equilibrium in
the final quarter when he broke
through the right side of the State
line and went 33 yards on all
fours. All along the way Pete
kept fighting to keep his halancc
as Cougar after Cougar hit him.
He was finally downed on the
W.S.C. 0-yard line.

body was in position to receive it
and the pigskin rolled down to
the W.S.C. 13 where Cougar back
Carl Littlefleld fumbled the elu
sive pellet while attempting to fall
on it. Pete Fay scampered around
left end for 11 yards and six
points.
Old Pete Zagar came through with
his usual blocked kick for the sec
ond score. Paulman's place-kick
for those three points in the third
quarter was beautiful to watch. It
(raveled 41 yards in the air and
split the uprights in the dead center
10 feet above the crossbar.
JUMPIN' JIMMINY
MAKES COME-BACK
Little Jimmy Coffis thrilled his
many admirers with a swell come
back performance. Jimmy hasn't
been the Coffis of old this season,
but he sure came back with a ven
geance Saturday. Jumpin' Jimminy
broke through the Cougar left tackle
and raced 66 yards down the field
for a touchdown. He crossed the
goal line wtih that familiar ear-to
ear grin of his.
Fay gave an unbelievable ex
hibition of perfect equilibrium in
the final quarter when he broke
through the right side of the State
line and went 33 yards on all
fours. All along the way Pete
kept fighting to keep his halancc
as Cougar after Cougar hit him.
He was finally downed on the
W.S.C. 0-yard line.

BACK ON THE
JOB AGAIN
Well, here I am back on the old
typewriter after a week's vacation.
That southern expedition was just
a little too much for me. The ordeal
of hitch-hiking down and back has
kept me in a state of dilemma for a
full seven days but I feel that my
thumb is sufficiently healed to en
able me to take over again withoyt
getting caught in the keys.
Oh, yes, I presented the illus
trious Mr. Swent wtih my expense
account for the southern journey
and titled it, ''Sports Editor's con
tribution to Stanford journalism."
TINY'S BOYS KEPT
PACE WITH CAL
Tiny's gridiron warriors kept in
scoring pace with the terrible Bears
Saturday. As the score from Oregon
kept booming forth from the loud
speaker in the local fool ball park,
iho Indians were fighting to keep up
with Cal's scoring power.
The Stanfords only missed it by
three points, and if Bill Paulman
had a few minutes more he might
have made another, field goal to
equal Cal's scoring feat.
..Tiny's boys really c&nie through
to make the Big Game Saturday a
cinch sell-out. The Bears still
have to he classified as the favor
ites, hut it's not going to be any
slaughter, and don't be surprised,
dear breathren of the sporting
world, if Tiny's fighting Indians
dump the high riding Bears off
their hobby horse.
KIRSCH SCORE
CALLED BACK
Stanford might have had another
touchdown in the second quarter
Saturday when Bill Kirseh inter
cepted a Cougar lateral and raced
across the goal line. A fast whistle
called the play off.
Something that's seldom seen in
a college football game paved the
way for Stanford's first score in
the second quarter. The Cougar
center snapped the ball when no
body was in position to receive it
and the pigskin rolled down to
the W.S.C. 13 where Cougar back
Carl Littlefleld fumbled the elu
