# 'Don Juan' Fills Little Theater
## Scenic, Lighting Effects Help Create Illusions 
### 
A half-filled house opening night,
four vacant seats the second night,
standing room only Saturdayâ€”that
is the record of Thomas Wood Ste
vens' production of "Don Juan,"
which takes the stage for the last
time tonight in the Little Theater
at 8 o'clock.
The Moiiere farce sent increas
ingly large audiences into prolonged
guffaws in the first three perform
ances of its extended run. Tickets
for tonight's performance are on
sale at 40 cents in Room 202, Memo
rial Hall, and at the door of the
Little Theater.
In addition to Moliere's bubbling
wit and the masterly direction of
Mr. Stevens, new acting director of
dramatics, much of the play's at
traction lies in the scenic and light
ing effects.
The illusion of a beautiful girl
changing into an old hag, of a stone
statue walking, of Don Juan sinking
into the flames of Hell all contribute
to the impressive staging of the play.
Gary Simpson and Bud Cady have
the leading roles, and they are sec
onded by an able cast including
Phyllis Corson, Kathleen Campbell,
Bill Goetze, Ralph Parr, Harry Mu
heim, Hoke Roberts, Virginia Rog
ers, John E. Cox, Dan Holtom, Jim
Morris, Bill Schultz, Louise Reed,
Barbara Thrasher, and Janet Dole.
