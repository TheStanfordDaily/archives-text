## Cal Ramblers End Tradition, Down Grays Unorganized Grays Bow To Cal Reserves 12-0; Penalty Stops Score 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Eleven fine ball players, making
up a disorganized combination of
Stanford Grays, broke a 10-year
winning streak by losing to the Cali
fornia Ramblers Saturday, 12-0.
Playing back seat to the varsity
all season, the Grays have had very
little, organized, practice, and scrim
mage together, and could not btt ex
pected to display great team ability,
particularly the second string,
against whom the Ramblers scored
twice.
The Ramblers started the game
with a fast drive to the Grays' one
yard line, where they were held for
downs by a sudden defensive spurt
of the Stanford reserves.
Pass for 80 Yards
It was ticklish business trying to
get out of that hole, but the Grays
faked a punt and completed a pass
from Sjostrom to Mullens, who took
the ball from the air along the end
zone, and ran 80 yards to the Cali
fornia 20-yard stripe, where he
was pinned from behind.
He had been followed closely all
the way, and covered the distance by
virtue of a fine down-field blocking
display of Coach Husky Hunt's
Cardinal subs.
Penalty Stops Score
Near the end of the quarter Spar
ling caught a punt from the Bears,
and ran 70 yards over the goal-line,
but a clipping penalty brought the
ball back with no score.
Coach Hunt tried most of his sec
ond string in the last part of the
first half, and the Ramblers made
two touchdowns.
Opening a large hole in the center
of the line, they sent Franklin, Bear
fullback, through for 55 yards and a
touchdown. The umpire's whistle
blew in the middle of the play, and
the Grays stopped dead, only to find
that the touchdown they had ne
glected to stop was good.
Then a 30-yard high wabbly pass
was completed from Perry to Horan,
Rambler halfback and end, over the
goal-line for a second tally.
Punch Fails
The first stringers went in again
after the half, and in the fourth
quarter the Grays drove down to the
Ramblers' one-yard line, where the
game had started with the teams re
versed.
Following suit of their opponents,
the Grays also bogged down and
failed to make the goal-line push.
Jerry Sparling, at left half for the
Grays, made several fine punt re
turns, while Tommy Walker, at right
half, made some good runs and put
on an excellent blocking perform
ance.
