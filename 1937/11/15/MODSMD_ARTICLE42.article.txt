## 
### 
It took the U.C.L.A. water polo
team two overtime periods to de
feat Stanford 5 to 3 Saturday morn
ing.
The victory pushed the Bruins into
a tie with California for the confer
ence lead and ruined any hope for a
Stanford, championship. The Indians
lost their chances of victory when
they failed to score after U.C.LA.
had lost a man for fouling near the
end of regular playing time.
Shooting Door
Every man on the Stanford team
except the goalie took at least one
shot at the crippled Uclans' net. But
poor shooting by the Indians and a
bit of fine goal guarding by Bruin
Wall Woods staved off the threats
until Stanford lost Bob Allen by the
foul route. Then the Bruins fired up
near the end of the second overtime
and added two more goals before the
period ended.
Johnny Lamb made all three
Stanford goals and barely missed on
two tries that would have created
an Indian victory. Brightest spots
in the local line-up were the guard
spots, where Dick Hoover and Bill
Hatch played beautifully.
Good Defense
It was the first game all season
in which Stanford displayed a good
defensive line. Yet the Indians
were n't able to move offensively as
they have been in their last few
starts.
The score was knotted at one
apiece at the half and Stanford held
a 3 to 2 margin a bare half min
ute before the regular period ended.
Bruin Dick Norton tanked a shot
then to put his mates back in the
ball game.

Bob Plate led a combined jayvee
varsity team to a 7 to 4 victory over
San Jose State in a game Friday
afternoon.
