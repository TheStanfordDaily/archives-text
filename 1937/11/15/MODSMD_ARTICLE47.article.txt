## Co-Educational Code-Education 
### 
WHEN a politician runs short of something to
speech-make about, he can always fall
back on the Bible, the flag, and the Constitution.
When a Daily editor runs short of something
to write about he can always rehash the Union
dollar, the bawlout, and the honor code.
Just as the politico can never do much more
than rant about the Bible and the flag, the Daily
editor can do little about the dollar, bawlout, or
code, except to remind the campus that they're
omnipresent. And the campus does little except
to be reminded, when it reads the edit columns.
Last spring Women's Council decided to con
duct a little more extensive campus-reminding
campaign on one of the three editorial stand
bys—the honor code.
To find out reactions to the honor code as a
success or failure, and to get suggestions for
making the code work more efficiently, Council
held a series of three informal discussions in
all women's living groups on successive Mon
day nights.
Discussion leaders visited different sorority
houses and hall corridors, explained to them
honor code history and aims, answered ques
tions, took back proposals for improvement in
the code's operation.
So popular and successful did this program
of small group discussions prove, that Council
repeated the series of talks for women this
quarter, last of which will be concluded tonight.
At the end of the present talks, Council hopes
to have accomplished two things: first, to have

given freshman and transfer women an ade
quate follow-up to the original honor code expla
nations given them'their first week at Stanford;
second, to have encouraged old Stanford women
students to help make the honor code operate
efficiently.
Whatever results the discussions do have,
Council has at least impressed Stanford women
with the fact that there is an honor code in the
University.
In former days, women students were given
several talks on the honor code in the first few
hectic weeks of their freshman year—after
which they had practically no code-education.
Transfer women, who missed the freshman
talks, knew of the honor code almost solely
through hearsay and the opening Assembly
speeches.
It is not implausible to assume that a good
portion of honor code violation has come from
ignorance of its aims, meaning, and import. And
Council has made a genuine effort to eliminate
such ignorance.
If the outcome of the second series of honor
code talks is as favorable as the first, Council
may well continue its plan from year to year,
perhaps persuade Men's Council to adopt a
similar plan of code-education.
It wouldn't hurt the campus to sit back for
about fifteen minutes two or three times a quar
ter and think about how the honor code is being
observed.
Perhaps the women have hit on something.
