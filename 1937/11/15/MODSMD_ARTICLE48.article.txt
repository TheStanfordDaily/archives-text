# Poor Tiny

\\T FEEL kinda sorry for Tiny," Coach Babe
1 Hollingbery of Washington State College
is reported to have said as he was interviewed
in the dressing-room following his 23-0 defeat
by Stanford. "I pick California to win by about
two touchdowns."
Hollingbery is traditionally a showman â€”one
of those nervous coaches that does more fidget
ing on the sidelines than half his team does on
the field. But Hollingbery was not playing
showman late Saturday afternoon. He meant
what he said.
One of the few individuals who has had an
opportunity to see both Stanford and California
in the close-up, Hollingbery's views deserve
notice.
Not that Stanford is going to become sud
denly swelled to plan on a Big Game victory.
But rather that Stanford lays too much empha
sis on its display of point-getting ability rather
than football power.
Hollingbery knows, as do other observers of

California and Stanford, that the Bear has shown
decidedly more offensive power than the Indian
all season. Its blocking and tackling still mean
it the "wonder team" tab. Its touchdowns have
been made on perfectly executed drives, with
plays funning perfectly, clean tackling, master
ful field generalship, definitely superior foot
ball.
Stanford has shown occasional spurts of those
qualities. But generally, Stanford has taken ad
vantage of the breaks. No, we're not saying
that the old Indian was lucky to win. In football,
breaks, such as the blocking of a punt, are usu
ally made. Stanford has made its breaks, and
then capitalized thereupon.
Stanford can beat California. Hollingbery,
however, says no. To capitalize on its underdog
position Stanford will do well to heed the admo
nition of the impartial observer.
