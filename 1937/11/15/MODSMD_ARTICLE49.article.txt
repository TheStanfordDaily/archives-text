THE BIGGER THEY ARE . . .
IF anybody around Stanford has lost his calendar
and is planning to catch up on work this week, he
will have to hunt a quiet cave somewhere back in the
hills. This is going to be a smash week on the Farm.
And even if some inhibited chem major could remain
studiously aloof from the storm of Big Game en
thusiasm, he wouldn't be able to work. The abnormal
psychology professors would snap him up imme
diately.
Ordinarily during football season the shades of
our iron-lunged ancestors have a bad time of it. The
modern student is usually too reserved to have a
convulsion for dear alma mater, which in some ways
is a very fine thing. But we can understand how the
calmness of our grandstands would depress the ghost
of an alumnus who cheerfully coughed out his vocal
chords at the turn of the century.

At Big Game time, though, our forebears cease
their restless wandering. They brush off a spectral
coonskin coats, chase ghostly moths out of their ban
ners, and lean over our shoulders feeling perfectly
at home.
This year particularly, we are rolling up a flood of
enthusiasm which will show our old grads that they
weren't the only ones who could sprain a neat larynx.
The Big Game comes at the end of a natural publicity
campaign, more effective than any that ever sold mit
tens to Fiji Islanders.

Our team has been improving steadily all season.
It has worked up from the Santa Clara petting party
to the assault and battery that flattened Washington
State Saturday. We go into the Big Game in the role
of the well known under-dog, bearing in mind what
the Bible says about the last being first. It all sounds
like a story from "Boys Life."
From Saturday to Thursday we have a breathing
space, with Big Game theme still dominating. Stu
dents will argue wtih local innkeepers, trying to
squeeze out space to bunk their parents. Newspapers
will turn out stuff like this, and sports writers will
run berserk among players, yardages, odds, and line
ups.

Thursday night we will go to the bonfire
rally, and cast the linings of our throats at Ranso
hoff's feet. Friday come the Gaieties; Saturday the
Game.
Lord and Thomas couldn't have arranged a better
build-up. And no publicity campaign for a sawdust
breakfast food ever whipped up the support that the
Big Game gets.

This generation doesn't often have time to let
off steam. The modern emphasis on study keeps our
noses close to the Bawlout grindstone. The Big Game
concentrates all the enthusiasm that we back up dur
ing long evenings in the Library while we pursue a
missing integer through a calculus book.
And so U there breathes a man with soul so dead
that he plans to study much this week, he will have
a very frustrating time on the campus. About all he
can do is slink off to ;i cave in lite hills.
