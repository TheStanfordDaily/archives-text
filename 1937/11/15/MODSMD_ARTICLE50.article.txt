HPHE last buxom soprano took her last bow, the
last beaming conductor dropped his baton, and the
curtain came down on the San Francisco opera season
last Saturday night. It was a season of rare musical
opportunities, and Stanford took advantage of all of
them. Week nights and week-ends found the rough
and his mate somewhere between the eaves and the
pit of the War Memorial Opera House. It wasn't a case
of soaking up culture—just stuff that was too darn
good to pass up.
Top spot of the season was Beethoven's only opera,
"Fidelio," which was heard for the first time in San
Francisco. Kirsten Flagstad sang it and . . . well,
wise guys have long since stopped trying to say how
good that voice is. Emanuel List was second in com
mand, and Rene Maison, new Metropolitan tenor who
had previously failed to live up to a gilt-edged rep,
proved himself a singer as well as a swell prospect
for U.C.'s line. "Lohengrin," with the infallible com
bination of Flagstad and Lauritz Melchior, sailed
through two tremendous performances. And only too
late we found out that Kirsten Flagstad, who just must
be Wotan's daughter, will never sing in San Francisco
opera again. Concerts can never bring the ecstasy of
her "Love Death" in "Tristan and Isolde," Ihe breath
taking thrill of "Brunhilde's Battle Cry" in "Die
Walkure."

The old guard was back again in better voice than
ever. Martinelli seemed fresh and eager, and he's no
high school kid. He turned in thrilling performances
all along the line. Pinza, who sang on the Farm last
week, made each of his roles an extraordinary mu
sical phenomenon, a piece of acting that lived. I hope
that someday I will hear him as the Tsar Boris in
Moussorgsky's "Boris GudunofT" and in Verdi's "Simon
Boccanegra." Richard Bonelli knocked 'em dead in
every part he sang. Charlotte Boerner handled con
tralto roles with youthful ability and charm.

Now, let's see, who haven't I insulted yet? Bruna
Castagna gave us dramatic and well sung interpreta
tions of several parts. But it seems that Mme Cas
tagna is destined to be typed as an old hag, a witch,
or some kind of "boogey-boogey-boogey," as Groucho
Marx so deftly put it. Ludwig Hoffman, Norman Cor
don, Julius Huehn, and Emanuel List took good care
of the lower end of the vocal scale during the season.
Settings and production were improved this year, and
the ballet under Serge Oukrainsky struck an all-time
high, even if it did smack a little of latter-day
Ziegfeld.
It's all over . . . thank you, Mr. Merola ... it sure
was good.
