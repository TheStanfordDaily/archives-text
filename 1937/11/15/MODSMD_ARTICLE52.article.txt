# Cantor Beery, But Mellowish In New Show
## 
### 
"Ali Baba Goes to Town" (Fox-
Stanford): When Aloysius Babson,
(Eddie Cantor) en route to Holly
wood, walks out of a box car back
wards, he pitches onto the Fox lot,
gets made the fortieth thief in a
filming of Ali Baba, takes an over
dose of headache pills, snoozes on
the lot.
At this point, the plot throws up
its hands in despair and rushes out
A nf tho r>ir-liiff»

while the cause
of Aloysius Bab
son is furthered
by several sepia
montage shots
whisking him, for
lack of someplace
better, to Bagdad,
century not spec
ified.
Meanwhile, the

plot spx-ings into rapid action, and
reeling drunkenly through several
specialty numbers, and three or four
love interests, lampoons the New
Deal, dragging the Raymond Scott
quintet somewhere across the trail.
The picture I am trying to convey is
one of extreme confusion not un
mixed with a great deal of good
willy-nilly entertainment.
As Aloysius Babson, Eddie Cantor
is chiefly memorable for his head
gear, which suggests nothing so
much as the Masonic Temple fez
with interpolations by the British
navy full dress uniform.
For whatever part of the picture
is a take-off on the New Deal, it
may be said that "Ali Baba Goes to
Town" proves a somewhat beery
satire, not primarily sparkling, quite
plebian, but distinctly mellowing
after the first few quarts.
"Annapolis," all about Annapolis,
makes a better than average, and a
shorter than most, second feature.
