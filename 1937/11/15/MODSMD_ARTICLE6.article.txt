# Open House Held At Lagunita, Roble
## 
### 
Lagunita and Roble opened their
doors from 3 to 5 o'clock yesterday
afternoon when they held "at
homes" for friends and families of
residents.
Women entertained their guests
at tea in their rooms, while, for two
hours, male voices echoed along the
sacred corridors.
