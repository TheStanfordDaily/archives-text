# Tri-Powers Blame Japan; Plan Action
## United States, France, Great Britain Allied In War Conference 
### 
BRUSSELS, Nov. 14 (U.R).â€”The
United States, Great Britain and
France, acting in concert, prepared
tonight to throw the blame of war
in China directly at Japan and then
take measures to deal with the situ
ation in their own way.
Whether the measures would in
clude military assistance to China
remained in doubt, but there was
little question that the new align
ment of the three democratic powers,
forged out of the virtual collapse of
the Nine-Power Conference, would
adopt a solid front in future deal
ings with Japan.
Japan, fearing this alignment ap
parently more than they did the
placing of "war guilt" on their shoul
ders, was believed to be taking "un
official diplomatic steps" in a last
minute effort to avert the outright
censure which the Nine-Power Con
ference will vote on tomorow.
One of these steps was reported in
certain quarters as a "feeler" to
ward Britain with a view to having
the British accept the role of media
tor in the Chinese-Japanese conflict.
A dispatch from London said the
diplomatic correspondent of the Sun-
Graphic "understood" that Japan
had approached Britain already with
a proposal guaranteeing the full
"open door" in China and non-inter
ference with foreign interests.
