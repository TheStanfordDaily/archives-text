# Howell Elected Head of B.A.C.
## Board Defers Decision On Intramural Field 
### 
J. Wesley Howell, Class of 1912,
was elected chairman of the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control at its
monthly meeting held last Friday.
Howell will replace Richard Bar
rett, who died two weeks ago.
The board deferred decision on
the proposed intramural field until
further inquiry into the matter is
made by the Committee on Finances
which is scheduled to meet before
the December meeting of the board.
At the finance meeting the possi
bility of building a turfed field
rather than sod, and the problem of
turf maintenance will be discussed.
Board sentiment, which favored the
new field, also indicated the inten
tion to "do it right when we do it."
Acting on the advice of Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, director of Men's
Health Service, a financial allotment
was granted for the purchase of a
diathermy machine for electric heat
cures to be used in the care of
athletic injuries.
