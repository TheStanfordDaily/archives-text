# 'Lawyers' To Hold Moot Court Trial
## 
### 
Embryonic lawyei's will be given
a chance to try out the theories dug
out of their legal tomes tonight in
the law department's moot court
trial.
Tonight's trial is one of a series
which began last night. Cases are
devised on questionable points of
law, briefs prepared and given to
students, who then argue and try
the case.
