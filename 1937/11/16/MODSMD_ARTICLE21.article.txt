WASHINGTON. Nov. 15 (UP).—
Congress convened in special session
at noon today and within 30 minutes
the house was torn by dissension
which raised the specter of revolt
against President Roosevelt's legis
lative program.
The explosion was touched off
when Rep. Ralph Church, R., 111.,
objected—after reading of the presi
dent's message—to a unanimous con
sent request to adjourn until Thurs
day.
