# Scalper Gets 75 Hours For Extortion Sale
## 
### 
Dealing a blow to ticket scalpers
profiteering on last week's sell-out
of 1700 tickets for the Gaieties this
Friday night, Men's Council yes
terday afternoon sentenced "a cer
tain student" found guilty of "ex
tortion" charges to 75 hours' work.
In addition to being ordered to
turn in all of his remaining tickets,
the student was required to turn in
receipts to the council proving that
he had refunded all of his ticket
scalp sales.
A movie-conscious freshman, who
reportedly saved a smoke bomb
used at a movie set on Catalina
Island last summer just so he could
use it at Stanford, exploded the
bomb in Encina recentlyâ€”and Men's
Council yesterday told him to com
plete 25 hours' work by Christmas
vacation. ,
Seven students charged with
parking and speeding traffic viola
tions were also dealt with at the
meeting.
