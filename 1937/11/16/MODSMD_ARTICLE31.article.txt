## MORE SCREAMING FROM THE BOO-ERKELEY BULL-RUSHES 
### 
One of the boobers up at Boo
erkeley is carrying high the torch of
typical Cal screeching. They always
have somebody over there across
the mud-flats who's ready to pounce
up and down on somebodyâ€”any
body.
This time it's Dick Toner, the
illustrious sports head of the
Daily Californian. In a recent
tfrut column, Toner mentioned the
various coast college sports edi
tors one by one and moaned about
this and that.
He finally got to me at the end
and stated that he really didn't have
anything against me but the fact
that I go to Stanford. I'll answer
this by saying that at least we have
a campus over here. I've often won
dered where Berkeley ends and the
Cal campus (if you can call it that)
begins. The poor deluded scrivener
is probably contented in the Ber
keley bull rushes so why go on?
