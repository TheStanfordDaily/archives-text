Mr. Toner also goes on to !say that
I'm probably misinformed enough
to think that the "Big Red Wheel
barrow" will win the Big Game.
From where I sit it looks like a Cal
victory by one or even two touch
downs, but those little U.C. boys
had better pull their down
out of the mist because there's a
very great chance that the members
of Allison's Undertaking Society may
be the recipients of a little burying
party come Saturday in the Stanford
Stadium.
Oh, yes, and speaking of stadiums,
Dickâ€”we've got grass on the floor
of ours here.
