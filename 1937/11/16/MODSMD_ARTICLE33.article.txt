# DAILY BRUIN PULLS PRIZE BUTCH
## 
### 
While we're on the subject of col
lege newspapers we might as well
drift southward to U.C.L.A., where
Sports Editor Vincent Rice pulled
the neatest butch of the current
season.
While I was down south for the
Trojan game f picked up a Daily
Bruin and glanced at a picture on
the sports page. It was captioned,
"John Montague, surrounded by a
bevy of beautiful girls securing his
autograph."
Everything would have been rosy
but the picture happened to be one
of Mayor La Guardia voting at the
reecnt New York elections, and he
was surrounded by a group of
matrons and election officials.
