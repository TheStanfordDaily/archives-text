# "BIG DOG" THRILLS FAIR SEX AT TROY
## 
### 
Big Bill Hanna, sometimes known
as "Big Dog," thrilled the feminine
portion of (he crowd at the Stan
ford-U.S.C. water polo game in
L .A. by playing practically the
whole game without even the bene
fit of those brief trunks he usually
wears. When Big Bill would be
evicted from the pool for fouling,
the manager would toss in a pair of
trunks so he could climb out.
I( seems that the big boy does
n't like rival players to pull him
under, and the removal of the
trunks was quite a blessing. He
didn't put on a show, however,
for the small-sized crowd Satur
day against U.C.L.A.
Incidentally, that U.C.L.A. game
was the toughest nerve-tingler I
have ever seen. The game ended
13-3, and the two teams battled it
out for two and two-thirds extra
periods before the Bruins finally
sewed up the bal] game with two
goals in one minute.
