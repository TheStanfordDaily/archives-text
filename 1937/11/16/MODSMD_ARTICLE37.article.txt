# Delta Chi Takes Mural Grid Title By 9-0 Win
## Crown Lost By Phi Delts In Final Tilt Richardson's 25 – yard Boot for Field Goal Highlight of Victory 
### JERRY MAYER 
Showing marked superiority in
every department of the game, a
smooth-working Delta Chi varsity
worked out a 9-0 win over Phi Delta
Theta yesterday afternoon in the
final intramural football game of the
season, and thereby became 1937
University champions.
A 25-yard field goal by Wayne
Richardson from the hands of Jack
Laney broke the scoring ice just be
fore the close of the first half, while
a 20-yard pass from Mervyn Sulli
van to Laney in the deep left fin
ished the afternoon's work. Rich
ardson's conversion was blocked.
Blocking Poor
Spotty blocking on running plays
and on pass defense spelled the Phi
Delt doom. Tom Collins made some
nice runs, principally without help,
while Jim Dillon's pass receiving
was the remaining solace for the
defending champs.
Guy Hagerty was at tailback most
of the time for the Phi Delts, but
seemed helpless against the brilliant
line play of Sullivan, Richardson, and
Tony Keese of the winners. This
combination at times seemed flaw
less.
Outstanding feature of the Delta
Chi game was its smoothness. The
boys knew their plays and knew
them well; Sullivan's selections, to
gether with the team's covering of
assignments deserve great praise.
Sullivan was a great passer yester
day, throwing fast strikes right over
center with amazing regularity, in
termixed with long loopers to the
deep left which lead their receivers
perfectly.
Take Over Trophy
The Delta Chis take over the ro
tating trophy from the Phi Delts,
who won it last year in the finals
against Sigma Nu. Before then Phi
Gamma Delta, and Sequoia, and
Sigma Nu were successive Univer
sity champs.

Richardson, Laney, Poole, Reimer,
Fremlin, Keese. Phi Delts—Wyeth,
Dillon, Collins, Kneubuhl, Carna
han, Maino, Seamans,. Heagerty,
