# Unruly Fans Ruin Montague's Match
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 15 (UP). —
Twelve thousand unruly fans upset
John Montague's introduction to his
future public on the fresh meadow
links yesterday. They forced him to
retire after playing nine holes of a
scheduled 18-hole exhibition match
with Babe Ruth, Babe Didrikson,
and Mrs. Sylva Annenberg.
It was probably the biggest crowd
in American golfing history and it
was the first time a sports event had
to be abandoned because of the size
of the gallery.
