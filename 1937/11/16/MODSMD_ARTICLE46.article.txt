# Red Machine Spirit Flames For Cal Game
## Paulman, Kirsch, Fay, Groves May Start In Backfield Positions 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
If Stub Allison has nothing better
to worry him this .week, he can sit
down and think about the battle his
team is going to have next Saturday
against the most highly spirited grid
combination Stanford has produced
this season.
Thirty Card ball players who
started the week's practice sessions
yesterday showed by theri spirit and

determination that they would rather
beat Cal than sleep and eat.
Camera Day
It was Big Game Camera Day on '
the field early in the afternoon, and
a possible starting line-up was indi
cated by the combinations Tiny
chose to look at the birdie.
Most likely combination, although
Tiny's mind changes like a thermom
eter, appeared to be a backfield of
Bill Paulman, at fullback; Bill
Kirsch and Pete Fay, halves; and
Jimmy Groves in the quarter post.
Leo Ferko and Bob Dakan were
at guards, Pete Zagar and Stan An
derson at tackles, and Grant Stone |
and Bill Willard on the flanks. Louie
Tsoutsouvas and Tony Calvelli
never seem to know until the toss
up which one will start in the pivot :
spot.
Alustiza on Sidelines
Fred Ledeboer watched yester
day's workout in street clothes with
a cold that may put him in the hos
pital for a day. A1 Alustiza was also
on the sidelines with a bad knee, j
but he will be ready to play again j
tomorrow.
Appearance of Willard and Dakan
on the field was good news to Coach ;
Thornhill. Both had cracked a
chest bone and neither could play !
against Washington State. But they
are wearing pads on their chests
and will not be hampered by their
injuries in the Big Game.
So it looks as though the Stanford
team that runs onto the field next
Saturday will be at. its peak phys
ically for the first time this season.
