## And Now-Scalping the Scalpers 
### 
MEN'S COUNCIL yesterday presented un
organized prospective Stanford ticket pur
chasers with a neat little parcel of bargaining
power, to be used in negotiating with the local
scalpers' union. Would-be ticket purchasers
now hold the thread of a Damoclean sword.
In ticket negotiations between scalpers and
purchasers, since Stanford went commercial
last week and set a time trial record for Gaieties
sellouts, all the power has been with the scalper.
He set his price, and the man who already had
his date for the Show, winced, and paid, and
felt pretty lucky to get hold of something. The
helpless student writhed under a merciless
scalper's thumb.
But those days are, for the most part, gone.
Men's Council handed one merciless scalper
75 hours yesterday.
It described that move as "lenient."
It doesn't intend to "fool around" with the
ones to come. But that is hardly the panacea,
the sword string, of which we talk.
It is this. Men's Council recommends through
the medium of this editorial that every student
use the threat of a "turn in" to Men's Council
as bargaining power to force ticket scalpers to
sell at cost. It further recommends that scalpers
who would not incur the Council's "leniency"
unload at list price now. It issues a warning to
scalpers; bargaining power to the scalped-to-be.
First glance may brand this sort of bargaining
power as objectionable; "squealing" is not ethi
cal even in combatting the unethical. But the
difference between the actual "squeal" and the
"threat to squeal" is the difference between
"selling" and threatening "not to sell." It evens
the score; gives both sides a chance, forces
ticket prices back into line.
Men who purchased tickets with the intent
to scalp may now unload at list price, safely.
Men's Council requests that they do, promises

protection. Scalpers who withhold, and are later
reported, will take the full penalty plus loss of
tickets, and receipts from tickets. That risk
makes future scalping economically, as well
as morally, unsound.
Now the victim of the racket has a leg to
stand on. Unless ticket sellers will agree to let
go at list price he can handle the deal through
Men's Council.
Chances are that threat alone will pull prices
down into line and end the era of outrageous
markups.
And then the Farm can return to its quiet
market, steady, with slight trading, and Gaieties
and Big Game shares up only a fraction.


This capitalistic advertiser on a Toyon bul
letin board, whose name was deleted from the
cut and who is now known as "a certain stu
dent" in the vernacular oi Men's Council,
went down for the count yesterday.
Count: 75 hours work—loss of tickets, loss
ol receipts. Moral: Scalping doesn't pay, ad
vertising doesn't pay, and neither will scalp
ees—not that much, anyway.
Will Mr. Savage, whose "Milk and Snail"
ad slipped into the photograph, kindly make
remittance to Daily Business Staff?

who would not incur the Council's "leniency"
unload at list price now. It issues a warning to
scalpers; bargaining power to the scalped-to-be.
First glance may brand this sort of bargaining
power as objectionable; "squealing" is not ethi
cal even in combatting the unethical. But the
difference between the actual "squeal" and the
"threat to squeal" is the difference between
"selling" and threatening "not to sell." It evens
the score; gives both sides a chance, forces
ticket prices back into line.
Men who purchased tickets with the intent
to scalp may now unload at list price, safely.
Men's Council requests that they do, promises

protection. Scalpers who withhold, and are later
reported, will take the full penalty plus loss of
tickets, and receipts from tickets. That risk
makes future scalping economically, as well
as morally, unsound.
Now the victim of the racket has a leg to
stand on. Unless ticket sellers will agree to let
go at list price he can handle the deal through
Men's Council.
Chances are that threat alone will pull prices
down into line and end the era of outrageous
markups.
And then the Farm can return to its quiet
market, steady, with slight trading, and Gaieties
and Big Game shares up only a fraction.


This capitalistic advertiser on a Toyon bul
letin board, whose name was deleted from the
cut and who is now known as "a certain stu
dent" in the vernacular oi Men's Council,
went down for the count yesterday.
Count: 75 hours work—loss of tickets, loss
ol receipts. Moral: Scalping doesn't pay, ad
vertising doesn't pay, and neither will scalp
ees—not that much, anyway.

MEN'S COUNCIL yesterday presented un
organized prospective Stanford ticket pur
chasers with a neat little parcel of bargaining
power, to be used in negotiating with the local
scalpers' union. Would-be ticket purchasers
now hold the thread of a Damoclean sword.
In ticket negotiations between scalpers and
purchasers, since Stanford went commercial
last week and set a time trial record for Gaieties
sellouts, all the power has been with the scalper.
He set his price, and the man who already had
his date for the Show, winced, and paid, and
felt pretty lucky to get hold of something. The
helpless student writhed under a merciless
scalper's thumb.
But those days are, for the most part, gone.
Men's Council handed one merciless scalper
75 hours yesterday.
It described that move as "lenient."
It doesn't intend to "fool around" with the
ones to come. But that is hardly the panacea,
the sword string, of which we talk.
It is this. Men's Council recommends through
the medium of this editorial that every student
use the threat of a "turn in" to Men's Council
as bargaining power to force ticket scalpers to
sell at cost. It further recommends that scalpers
who would not incur the Council's "leniency"
unload at list price now. It issues a warning to
scalpers; bargaining power to the scalped-to-be.
