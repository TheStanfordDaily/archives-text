RISE AND SHINE
AS THE week-end approaches and the Big Game
displaces war clouds that have monopolized the
horizon recently, the Stanford campus suddenly re
veals an amazing interest in mathematics. Roughs who
live for the sport page talk "odds'* and wander about
with washboard foreheads, leaving yardages, weights,
and plays strewn in their wake. Phi Letes venture
from their dark caves under the library to chase per
mutations and combinations through a log Stu
dents gladden the neglected hearts of math profes
sors with questions about the dynamics of pigskin.
All Stanford is wondering whether it should settle
for even money or hold out for seven to five. And like
Ihe rest, I have been looking around anxiously for
something neat but not gaudy in the way of Heaven
sent signs. Until today, I had a discouraging time of
it. The sky seemed to be fresh out of columns of fire
by night; and by day, the only pillar of smoke came
from an incinerator. There was plenty of handwriting
on walls, of course, but most of it said, "Sally—
4328" or "Mike's—6329." These may have been Heav
en-sent, but they were hardly worth risking money.

Today, however, the sign came. The Daily received
a lotter informing us that Orion is in the ascendant.
Our problems are solved. Stanford will win; Heaven
has decreed it.
OHon, I might point out for the benefit of those
who hold hands in astronomy class, is not an Irishman.
It is a constellation. Astrologers say, moreover, that it
is "the celestial bringer of good tidings." And Orion
is a special patron of Stanford. Like the x-ough, he ap
pears in the late evening; he is upright when first
visible, and remains so for most of the night. At this
time of the year he gets to bed just before dawn.
A more perfect correlation with the activities of a
Stanford man would be hard to find.

|£UT in case any of our little playmates across the
Bay point out that a Cal man also keeps-his feet
most of the evening, I can bring forth another crush
ing point. To all good Indians, Orion is a redskin
hunter, returning from the chase with the spoils drag
ging behind him. The Greeks pictured him as a warrior
with belt and sword. But the Greeks were too busy
standing on Persians' graves and not eening them
selves slaves to look into the matter closely.
Orion is the Indian conqueror. And out of cour
tesy to the grandeur that was Greece we will concede
him a belt. So much the better to keep from being
caught with his trousers down, my dear.
Our heavenly patron is in the ascendant. Our
mighty hunter is returning with the spoils dragging
behind. And the object of an Indian's hunt was always
the bear. The heavens could not speak plainer if
they used a public address system.
