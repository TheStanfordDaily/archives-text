dormitories have what is known as a
"telephone system."
Every time the term is used, the spirit of Noah
Webster cries out at the misuse of the English lan
guage. And the great bearded soul of Alexander Gra
ham Bell shudders as it reflects on the depths to
which "the telephone" has fallen.
The system is homesey-folksey all right. When
things are dull, you can always have a little chit-chat
with the operator. And the operator can tell you
whether or • not the little-ladie is two-timing you.
But if you are so depraved as to want to use the
"telephone system" for telephoning, you have missed
entirely the concept of a Stanford "telephone system."
The telephone system was installed when Stanford
was a man's school, when there were some women
her, but nobody was proud of the fact. It is too
much to say that in those days the telephone system
was effiicent, but at least it was fairly adequate.
Then came the deluge, and the Farm was flooded
with silks and satins, powder and perfume, and all
the rest. Stanford men rose to the occasion. Not so,
the telephone system. With but few changes, the
swicthboard, through which the "old rough" has
made his dates with the "old Stanford woman," was
expected to do the work for the new era in Stanford
dating. But the old switchboard couldn't take the
new women. They broke him. Today he stands, a
beaten switchboard.
pRESENT facilities simply do not take care of the
rush of calls, particularly from % to 9 o'clock in
the evening. Hall men have been known to fall
asleep standing in the phone booth, waiting for the
operator to answer. The rush-hour operators—abused
and harassed—try sometimes to speed things up. But
the old switchboard simply does not make the grade.
Men of Sequoia, of course, are used to terrible
service. You don't "call" a man at Sequoia, you
"holler" him. The rooms are devoid of anything re
motely relating to the newer inventions.
When the financial storm clouds lift, or when the
Union Dollar comes home to roost—Stanford men and
women expect the phone service to be improved. In
the meanwhile, write your senator.
