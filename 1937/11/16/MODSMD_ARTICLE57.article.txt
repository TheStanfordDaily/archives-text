CONSUL MISTAKEN?

The Editor, Sir:
I read with great interest the ar
ticle in this morning's Daily, with
reference to Consul Hirota's talk be
fore the International Club. "China
is the aggressor in the Far East,"
Hirota told the club members. "She
wanted this war and intended this
kind of trouble."
No one with less than Oriental
control of face could soberly make a
similar assertion and pretend to
keep a straight face. Consul Hirota
emphasized the fact that he spoke
as a private citizen of Japan; but
stripped of diplomatic subtlety, his
stand still represents the prevailing
opinion in Japanese governmental
circles.
This is not an attempt at journal
ism, but such dogmatic assertions
should not be allowed to pass with
out challenge. It is not my purpose
to present the other side of the case;
you know it as well as I.
Suffice it to call your attention
to the map of China for the last 30
years. Korea was taken from China
in 1910 to safeguard Japan, because
it was too near Japan to let any
other power control it; Manchui'ia
was taken from China in 1931 to
protect Korea. Jehol and the other
northern provinces were recently
taken to protect Manchuria—a slow
moving picture of a continuous per
formance. And China is still
branded the aggressor, the irony of
it all. If Consul Hirota's talk of a
better understanding between China
and Japan presupposes the continu
ance of such aims and acts, we had
better stop here.
Japan's plan to set up a friendly
and co-operating regime in China is
impossible as long as Japanese oc
cupy Chinese territory, because no
government of China could stop the
Chinese feelings of resentment and
hostility. If we are to judge from

Japan's deeds, her claims to respect
the independence and territorial in
tegrity of China, it would amount to
what one authority calls "a paraly
sis of reason and a distortion of
facts."
Let it not be mistaken that I have
any malice against the people of
Japan. On the contrary, some of my
best friends are Japanese. But I be
lieve that the militaristic powers of
Japan are overplaying their cards
to the detriment of the Chinese and
the Japanese people.
"All their cards might be on the
table, but they are face down."

ism, but such dogmatic assertions
should not be allowed to pass with
out challenge. It is not my purpose
to present the other side of the case;
you know it as well as I.
Suffice it to call your attention
to the map of China for the last 30
years. Korea was taken from China
in 1910 to safeguard Japan, because
it was too near Japan to let any
other power control it; Manchui'ia
was taken from China in 1931 to
protect Korea. Jehol and the other
northern provinces were recently
taken to protect Manchuria—a slow
moving picture of a continuous per
formance. And China is still
branded the aggressor, the irony of
it all. If Consul Hirota's talk of a
better understanding between China
and Japan presupposes the continu
ance of such aims and acts, we had
better stop here.
Japan's plan to set up a friendly
and co-operating regime in China is
impossible as long as Japanese oc
cupy Chinese territory, because no
government of China could stop the
Chinese feelings of resentment and
hostility. If we are to judge from

Japan's deeds, her claims to respect
the independence and territorial in
tegrity of China, it would amount to
what one authority calls "a paraly
sis of reason and a distortion of
facts."
Let it not be mistaken that I have
any malice against the people of
Japan. On the contrary, some of my
best friends are Japanese. But I be
lieve that the militaristic powers of
Japan are overplaying their cards
to the detriment of the Chinese and
the Japanese people.
"All their cards might be on the
table, but they are face down."

CONSUL MISTAKEN?

The Editor, Sir:
I read with great interest the ar
ticle in this morning's Daily, with
reference to Consul Hirota's talk be
fore the International Club. "China
is the aggressor in the Far East,"
Hirota told the club members. "She
wanted this war and intended this
kind of trouble."
No one with less than Oriental
control of face could soberly make a
similar assertion and pretend to
keep a straight face. Consul Hirota
emphasized the fact that he spoke
as a private citizen of Japan; but
stripped of diplomatic subtlety, his
stand still represents the prevailing
opinion in Japanese governmental
circles.
This is not an attempt at journal
ism, but such dogmatic assertions
should not be allowed to pass with
out challenge. It is not my purpose
to present the other side of the case;
you know it as well as I.
