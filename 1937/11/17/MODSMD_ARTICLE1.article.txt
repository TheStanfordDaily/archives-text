# Paly Pastor Hits Sunday Night Movie
## Ex Com Considers Plan To Install Fountain For Nitery Patrons 
### 
"Where will secularization of
Sunday end?" asked Reverend Os
car Green, pastor of the Episcopal
Church in Palo Alto, in discussing
the question of Sunday night cam
pus movies before Ex Committee
last night.
Reverend Green emphasized that
he was speaking only for himself,
that there had been no discussion of
the question by church groups, that
he was not voicing an "ecclesias
tical wail."
He felt that campus movies on
Sunday night might be censured for
two main reasons: that no entertain
ment in addition to regular campus
attractions was needed on Sunday
night; and that the publicity result
ing from holding such movies might
be more detrimental than the proj
ect was worth.
"If you innovate campus movies
on Sunday, why not, sooner or later,
dances, or football games. Where
will the line be drawn?"
He also pointed out the chance that
the holding of campus movies might
appear as lack of co-operation be
tween the churches and the univer
sity: "both character building insti
tutions."
Ex Committee felt that they had
been justified in their okay of the
movies, decided to issue a definite
statement putting forth their view
point on the situation. Gordy Frost
will be in charge of drawing up the
statement.
NITERY: A1 Hyman, head of the
Nitery committee, reported via Bar
bara Murphy that he is investigating
the possibility of installing a foun
tain in the Nitery. Cost will be ap
proximately $250, plus installment
expenses. Ex Committee suggested
that more definite investigation be
made of the question before official
action is taken.
BILLIARD EXHIBITION: Charles
Peterson, billiard expert, will be in
vited to give an exhibition of the
art on campus at some future date.
FONTIUS' RETURN: Chuck Fon
tius appeared at the meeting for the
first time since his operation for ap
pendicitis.
DATES GRANTED: Debate Coun
cil, November 17; Japanese Club,
November 20; Cardinals, November
19; Gaieties, November 19 (after
noon). The Pomona Men's Glee
Club's request for a campus engage
ment was refused because of conflict
with the Stanford Glee Club's con
cert, to be held at approximately the
same time.
