### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16.â€”Po
lice were searching today for a Phi
Beta Kappa key and other articles
stolen from Marshall Dill, Jr., Stan
ford graduate, by a thief who en
tered the home of his father, Mar
shall Dill, grand jury foreman here.
Most of the articles stolen from
Dill Jr., who recently returned from
Europe, were of sentimental value.
They included, besides the Phi Bete
key, a watch and chain and a Joffre
medal awarded him by the French
government in 1935 for a debate in
France.
