C.1.0. Debate
Last night Gerald Marcus and
Gene Glasmann met Phillip Ver
liger and Roger Wolenberg, debating
the negative of a non-decision de
bate on "Resolved, that the C.1.0.
merits our support."
Indian representatives in tonight's
debate will take the affirmative of
"Resolved, that colleges and univer
sities should subsidize their athletes.'"
This meet also will be non-deci
sional.
'Own Ideas'
"What we have to say is our own
idea on the subject," emphasized
Stone, "not necessarily that of the
University. It is a pretty light sub
ject and should have the possibili
ties of a good debate."
Yesterday afternoon in the first of
the quarterfinals in the intersquad
debate tournament, Bob Carpenter
and John Moskovics eliminated
Howard Hays and Richard Riddell.
The remaining matches will be con
cluded this Thursday.
