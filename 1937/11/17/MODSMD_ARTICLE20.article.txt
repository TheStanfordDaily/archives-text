# Farm Skiers, 300 Strong, Seek Recognition
## 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
A year ago there was no ski club
at Stanford.
Today skiing has become so im
portant on the Farm that the club,
still officially unrecognized, has 300
members and expects almost to
double this number during the
winter.
Tonight members will meet in
Room 320 to approve a constitution
which they plan to submit next
Tuesday for Ex Committee's ap
proval.
Meyer Starts Club
Dormant skiing enthusiasm at
Stanford awoke suddenly last year
when Willy Meyer arrived on the
Farm from Zurich, Switzerland.
Activated by Meyer's questioning
about the existence of a ski club at
Stanford, A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds investigated, discovered a
small, exclusive group called the
Alpine Club. Most of the members
had graduated, he found.
Response Immediate
Response was immediate when
Meyer began organizing a large scale
club. Nearly 100 students were at
tending meetings by winter quarter,
when Stanford took fourth place in
j the Const Intercollegiate Meet at
1 Ynsomitr*.

After this success, they asked Ex
Committee for recognition of ski
ing as a minor sport. Insufficient
8.A.C.. funds was the chief objec
tion; the request was denied.
Last spring. Farm skiers took sec

ond place in the intercollegiate meet
at Mt. Rainier, beaten only by Wash
ington, where skiing is a major
sport. And Stanford is the only
major college on the Coast where
skiing does not have at least minor

sport standing. Later, members of
the new club trounced Cal in a
private meet at Yosemite.
Energetic Willy Meyer, backed by
Les Lewis, last year's manager, got
on the job again, and this quarter a
dry ski class was announced, to be
given for credit and open to both
men and women. With Meyer
i coaching gratis, because the B.A.C.
| will allot no funds for skiing, stu
; dents have been practicing on hay
out by the polo field. Stanford is the
first university on the Coast to give
instruction in dry skiing; Cal fol
lowed suit by instituting a course a
few weeks later.
Before closing time on Reg Day
students were being turned away
from the class, which now numbers
20 men and 27 women. The course
has been so successful that it will be
given again next quarter, with
j credit being given students for
week-ends in the snow, doing active
practice.
Last winter quarter 56 students
turned out for a week-end trip to
I Yosemite, despite the competition of
Jimmy Dorsey on campus, and
claniorcd enthusiastically for a sim
ilar excursion the following week.
With a better organization and spe


Mnrjorie Meyer tries dry skiing
cial rates being given students at the
big resorts, the turnout should be
even better this year, says Meyer.
The Ski Club, when organized,
will charge a $1 membership fee,
for the year. In return for this
members will have the benefit of
special week-end prices at Yose
mite and other resorts, where ar
rangements have been made for
room and board from Friday through
Sunday for $6.50 to those presenting
Ski Club cards.
During Christmas vacation there
will be a camp for members of the
team at Mineral King where, ac
cording to Meyer, the snow condi
tions are the best in California, with
board and lodging for $1 a day.
Biggest part of the club's program
at present is the plan for intramural
organization. Stanford's prospects
for the coming intercollegiate season
are bright, says Meyer. George
Whitney, former captain at Williams
College, is at Stanford this year, and,
since graduates and freshmen are
allowed to participate, will be one
of the brightest additions to the
Card team. Bill Janss and John
Pease are two stars returning from
last year.
Women's Team
Stanford has potentially the best
women's team on the coast. Mary
Elizabeth Conley, Idaho's women's
champion, is at Roble this year.
Other outstanding women are Mar
jorie Meyer, Elise Green, and Con
nie Bohosky. Meets with Cal and
Mills during winter quarter are
planned.

cial rates being given students at the
big resorts, the turnout should be
even better this year, says Meyer.
The Ski Club, when organized,
will charge a $1 membership fee,
for the year. In return for this
members will have the benefit of
special week-end prices at Yose
mite and other resorts, where ar
rangements have been made for
room and board from Friday through
Sunday for $6.50 to those presenting
Ski Club cards.
During Christmas vacation there
will be a camp for members of the
team at Mineral King where, ac
cording to Meyer, the snow condi
tions are the best in California, with
board and lodging for $1 a day.
Biggest part of the club's program
at present is the plan for intramural
organization. Stanford's prospects
for the coming intercollegiate season
are bright, says Meyer. George
Whitney, former captain at Williams
College, is at Stanford this year, and,
since graduates and freshmen are
allowed to participate, will be one
of the brightest additions to the
Card team. Bill Janss and John
Pease are two stars returning from
last year.
Women's Team
Stanford has potentially the best
women's team on the coast. Mary
Elizabeth Conley, Idaho's women's
champion, is at Roble this year.
Other outstanding women are Mar
jorie Meyer, Elise Green, and Con
nie Bohosky. Meets with Cal and
Mills during winter quarter are
planned.
A year ago there was no ski club
at Stanford.
Today skiing has become so im
portant on the Farm that the club,
still officially unrecognized, has 300
members and expects almost to
double this number during the
winter.
Tonight members will meet in
Room 320 to approve a constitution
which they plan to submit next
Tuesday for Ex Committee's ap
proval.
Meyer Starts Club
Dormant skiing enthusiasm at
Stanford awoke suddenly last year
when Willy Meyer arrived on the
Farm from Zurich, Switzerland.
Activated by Meyer's questioning
about the existence of a ski club at
Stanford, A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds investigated, discovered a
small, exclusive group called the
Alpine Club. Most of the members
had graduated, he found.
Response Immediate
Response was immediate when
Meyer began organizing a large scale
club. Nearly 100 students were at
tending meetings by winter quarter,
when Stanford took fourth place in
j the Const Intercollegiate Meet at
1 Ynsomitr*.

After this success, they asked Ex
Committee for recognition of ski
ing as a minor sport. Insufficient
8.A.C.. funds was the chief objec
tion; the request was denied.
Last spring. Farm skiers took sec

ond place in the intercollegiate meet
at Mt. Rainier, beaten only by Wash
ington, where skiing is a major
sport. And Stanford is the only
major college on the Coast where
skiing does not have at least minor

sport standing. Later, members of
the new club trounced Cal in a
private meet at Yosemite.
Energetic Willy Meyer, backed by
Les Lewis, last year's manager, got
on the job again, and this quarter a
dry ski class was announced, to be
given for credit and open to both
men and women. With Meyer
i coaching gratis, because the B.A.C.
| will allot no funds for skiing, stu
; dents have been practicing on hay
out by the polo field. Stanford is the
first university on the Coast to give
instruction in dry skiing; Cal fol
lowed suit by instituting a course a
few weeks later.
Before closing time on Reg Day
students were being turned away
from the class, which now numbers
20 men and 27 women. The course
has been so successful that it will be
given again next quarter, with
j credit being given students for
week-ends in the snow, doing active
practice.
Last winter quarter 56 students
turned out for a week-end trip to
I Yosemite, despite the competition of
Jimmy Dorsey on campus, and
claniorcd enthusiastically for a sim
ilar excursion the following week.

ond place in the intercollegiate meet
at Mt. Rainier, beaten only by Wash
ington, where skiing is a major
sport. And Stanford is the only
major college on the Coast where
skiing does not have at least minor

sport standing. Later, members of
the new club trounced Cal in a
private meet at Yosemite.
Energetic Willy Meyer, backed by
Les Lewis, last year's manager, got
on the job again, and this quarter a
dry ski class was announced, to be
given for credit and open to both
men and women. With Meyer
i coaching gratis, because the B.A.C.
| will allot no funds for skiing, stu
; dents have been practicing on hay
out by the polo field. Stanford is the
first university on the Coast to give
instruction in dry skiing; Cal fol
lowed suit by instituting a course a
few weeks later.
Before closing time on Reg Day
students were being turned away
from the class, which now numbers
20 men and 27 women. The course
has been so successful that it will be
given again next quarter, with
j credit being given students for
week-ends in the snow, doing active
practice.
Last winter quarter 56 students
turned out for a week-end trip to
I Yosemite, despite the competition of
Jimmy Dorsey on campus, and
claniorcd enthusiastically for a sim
ilar excursion the following week.
With a better organization and spe


Mnrjorie Meyer tries dry skiing
cial rates being given students at the
big resorts, the turnout should be
even better this year, says Meyer.
The Ski Club, when organized,
will charge a $1 membership fee,
for the year. In return for this
members will have the benefit of
special week-end prices at Yose
mite and other resorts, where ar
rangements have been made for
room and board from Friday through
Sunday for $6.50 to those presenting
Ski Club cards.
During Christmas vacation there
will be a camp for members of the
team at Mineral King where, ac
cording to Meyer, the snow condi
tions are the best in California, with
board and lodging for $1 a day.
Biggest part of the club's program
at present is the plan for intramural
organization. Stanford's prospects
for the coming intercollegiate season
are bright, says Meyer. George
Whitney, former captain at Williams
College, is at Stanford this year, and,
since graduates and freshmen are
allowed to participate, will be one
of the brightest additions to the
Card team. Bill Janss and John
Pease are two stars returning from
last year.
Women's Team
Stanford has potentially the best
women's team on the coast. Mary
Elizabeth Conley, Idaho's women's
champion, is at Roble this year.
Other outstanding women are Mar
jorie Meyer, Elise Green, and Con
nie Bohosky. Meets with Cal and
Mills during winter quarter are
planned.
