# Tutten Addresses Klahoya Members
## 
### 
Ellen Tutten, women's vocational
adviser, quoted the record of Stan
ford graduates in a short talk to the
Klahoya Luncheon Club yesterday
noon. Representative percentages
in the careers women follow were
given in a survey gathered over a
three-year period.
A method to aid decision in
choosing a life work, she pointed
out, is to take (he University voca
tional guidance test, which can be
obtained at the Ad Building. Re
sults from these tests are taken into
consideration by the vocational ad
viser.
