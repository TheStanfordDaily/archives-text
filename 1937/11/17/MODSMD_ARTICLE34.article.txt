DEMENTED CAL SPOUTS ED
CONTINUES TO SCREECH
It seems that these molting Bears
over in the Berkeley hills never get
tired of spouting off steam in order
to keep up Cal's nation-wide repu
tation of bum sportsmanship.
Dick Toner, Cal's false alarm
sports editor, who's really quite
harmless, is still pounding out
statements that only make him
look sillier day by day.
In his latest literary gem, Toner
claims that he has found a team as
lucky as the 1937 Stanford Indians.
It was an Oregon team back in 1908.
So Tiny's boys are the luckiest
bunch of gridders since 1908, eh?
Something tells me that every Stan
lord football player who reads this
is going out Saturday and person
ally see to it that some of Cal's ego
is rammed right back down its
throat.
OH. NO, THE BEARS
WEREN'T LUCKY
Several weeks ago tales came
drifting in from Razzberry Canyon
(hat a certain Bear was panting
quite contentedly in his lair, and
thanking his lucky stars he wasn't
whipped by a stray Husky from the
northland.
I know, Dick, that was just an
off-day for the Golden Frank
furter. Well, you'd better tell
your boys to play their best ball
of the season or there's going to be
a goodly number of headaches
among the Berkeley booers Satur
day night.
Toner's childish wit was also ex
emplified in several paragraphs
later when he staled that Stanford
and Washington State would play
the preliminary down at Palo Alto
to the Gray-Rambler "classic." He
urged Bear fans to get down here by
11 o'clock so they would be sure to
see the main event.
Maybe Mr. Toner can pull his
several brain cells together long
enough to mull over the Indians'
23-0 shellacking of the W.S.C. Cou
gars. Cal has been sitting pretty
high this season but Allison's pets
Letter watch that seat of theirs . . .
there's liable to be a little grease on
it Saturday afternoon.
HERE IT IS—THE
CLASSIC OF THE YEAR
At last . . . what Farm aquatic
fans have been waiting these long
weeks to witness. A battle to the
last breath in Encina Pools between
the Dippy sports staff and the water
polo managers.
The date of this titanic struggle,
which might be called a water ptflo
game by a few uninformed souls,
has not as yet been set, but spe
cial plans are under way to make
room for the thousands of people
who will be attracted to the Indian
water hole.
The typewriter pounders are un
dergoing rigid training rules. The
beer has been limited to one quart
a day per person, and all would-be
amphibians must be tucked into
bed before 2:30 every morning.
In answer to many queries from
both camps, water wings may be
used ... in fact, players may use
rafts of various designs and shapes
provided that no raft is more than
six feet long by three feet wide.
