# Cloudy Skies Fail To Wet Grid Spirit
## Red Machine Predicts Game Win; Tiny Works Ground Plays

"We're going to beat Cal, and it
doesn't matter if it rains or shines."
Indians No Mudders
But the Big Red Machine has not
had many chances this season to
show whether it can work smoothly
in the mud, as Cal has—and Cal has
shown wet - weather talent. Last
week-end the Golden Bear swamped
the Oregon Webfeet 26-0 on a wet
field and it wasn't sheer luck that
kept a slippery ball in Bottari's mits.
Passing is often a problem in the
rain, but the Big Game may be a
ground game. For two afternoons
the Stanford gridders have concen
trated on running plays with prac
tically no aerial maneuvers.
New Plays Tried
Tiny has cooked up six or eight
new plays, all of them runs for the
exclusive benefit of Stub Allison
and his boys. The new plays require
a little time before the ball-carrier
can get under way, and the Cards
will need some expert blocking to
keep the fast California linemen out
of the backfield long enough for the
runner to get across the line for a
gain instead of a loss.
Tiny may be concentrating on
ground plays, but it would be fool
ish to predict that the Indians, with
three of the best passers on the
Coast, will not throw the ball Sat
urday afternooh. The Indians can
still complete passes and probably
will.
Team Optimistic
But who can explain the great op
timism of the boys in the red jer
seys? Every Stanford player pre
dicts a Stanford victory. All the
boys admit that they have reached
second place in the conference part
ly through breaks but they say
breaks will not be needed Saturday.
And they say it so often and so
sincerely that one is led to believe
they really mean it.

Indians No Mudders
But the Big Red Machine has not
had many chances this season to
show whether it can work smoothly
in the mud, as Cal has—and Cal has
shown wet - weather talent. Last
week-end the Golden Bear swamped
the Oregon Webfeet 26-0 on a wet
field and it wasn't sheer luck that
kept a slippery ball in Bottari's mits.
Passing is often a problem in the
rain, but the Big Game may be a
ground game. For two afternoons
the Stanford gridders have concen
trated on running plays with prac

New Plays Tried
Tiny has cooked up six or eight
new plays, all of them runs for the
exclusive benefit of Stub Allison
and his boys. The new plays require
a little time before the ball-carrier
can get under way, and the Cards
will need some expert blocking to
keep the fast California linemen out
of the backfield long enough for the
runner to get across the line for a
gain instead of a loss.
Tiny may be concentrating on
ground plays, but it would be fool
ish to predict that the Indians, with
three of the best passers on the
Coast, will not throw the ball Sat
urday afternooh. The Indians can
still complete passes and probably
will.
Team Optimistic
But who can explain the great op
timism of the boys in the red jer

dicts a Stanford victory. All the
boys admit that they have reached
second place in the conference part

breaks will not be needed Saturday.
And they say it so often and so
sincerely that one is led to believe
they really mean it.
