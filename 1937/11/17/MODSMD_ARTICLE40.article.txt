# Cardinal Soccermen Point For Cal In Rainy Practice
## 
### 
Wet fields and rainy weather may
cause postponement of some sports,
but Harry Maloney and his soccer
men didn't let such small matters in
terfere with their practice this week
—not when they are pointing for a
game with those California Bears.
An engagement with the Blue and
Gold is enough to make any Stan
ford team get out there and work.
Add to this the fact that the Indians
were beaten by their arch rivals
when the two teams met last Sat
urday at Berkeley, and it is easily
understood why the soccermen
overlooked the rain and slippery
practice field to brush up on their
tactics before meeting the Bears
again Saturday at Stanford, prior to
the big gridiron classic.
Past records show California to be
one of the weakest defensive teams
in the conference, but by means of
a powerful front line attack, it has
been able to outscore its opponents
and take over first place in the con
ference standings.
With the exception of a 1-1 tie
with San Jose State, scores of pre
vious Bear games have been com
paratively high. Tine California de
fense has been penetrated by every
team in the loop, but a strong goal
scoring combination has offset their
defensive weakness.
In view of this, Maloney has been

stressing defensive tactics in prac
tice sessions during the week, be
lieving that if the Indian defense
can check the Bear forward line, his
own forwards will score enough to
spell victory Saturday.
