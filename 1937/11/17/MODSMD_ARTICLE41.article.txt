# Farm Fencers Fall Before Winged-O
## 
### 
Following its 16-9 defeat at the
hands of the Olympic Club last Fri
day, Stanford's fencers are prepar
ing for their final Heron Trophy
match December 3 against the San
Francisco Y.M.C.A.
By defeating the Indians, the
Winged *'0" fencers annexed the
Heron Trophy for 1937. Heron
matches are merely preparation for
the Amateur Fencers' League of
America matches which commence
next quarter. A1 Snyder, former
Farm fencing captain and at present
Pacific Coast open foils champion,
led the Olympians to victory over
Stanford by winning all his matches.
