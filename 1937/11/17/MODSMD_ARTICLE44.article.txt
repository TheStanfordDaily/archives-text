# Polo Tilt Cancelled Due to Wet Field
## 
### 
Card horsemen's scheduled game
with the San Mateo Polo Club this
afternoon has been called off due to
a sloppy field. If possible the second
match scheduled with them for this
Friday will be played.
Despite the rainy weather the In
dians are working out whenever
possible in preparation for their
match during Thanksgiving vaca
tion with the University of Arizona.
The Cards leave next Tuesday for
the south, where they will also play
a series of matches with private
teams.
