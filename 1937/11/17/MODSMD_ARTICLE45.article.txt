# Card Harriers To Meet Cal Distance Men
## Burrows, March, Ganahl Carry Team's Hopes For Win Tomorrow 
### 
Rain or shine tomorrow afternoon !
at 3:30 o'clock on the Stanford golf
course Card and Bear cross-country
men will clash in their annual pre-
Big Game meet. Last year the Cali
fornians took the match by one point
for their first victory since the in- '
auguration of the series.
Heading the list of Farm hopes to
break back into a winning streak
will be Paul Ganahl, Rusty March,
and Captain Ed Burrows. Burrows
was out last year with an injured |
foot, but is in top shape this season.
March and Ganahl have been
steady winners in practice and are
the squad's mainstay. Jack Beman
placed in the Cal meet last year and j
has been turning in practices that |
rank him among the top again this
year.
Other Indian harriers at the head
of the roster are Dave Delameter,
who has been taking Captain Bur
rows occasionally during workouts;
John Emanuel, who has been show
ing especially well in practice lately;
Ed Hyde, Jerry McCall, George
Shaw, and Will Slater.
Coach Brutus Hamilton's Bears
will feature Ted Vollmer and Stan
Sadaj. Vollmer was the marvel of i
last year's frosh team and holds the I
Cal-Stanford two-mile record. Sa- !
daj is an old hand in the distances, I
having tried for the United States '
Olympic team in 1932. The Cal line- j
up will also probably see Bob Baker, j
Les Voorhees, and Clarence Hall j
vying for top honors:

Each year in this country 9000 col
lege students and approximately
56,000 high school students are in
jured seriously while playing foot
ball.
