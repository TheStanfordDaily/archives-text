## Getting The Most Out Of a Good Thing 
### 
THE Lawrence Frost Amphitheater, graciously
presented to the University by the John
Lawrence Frosts as a parental memorial to their
son, has great potentialities. It will in time
probably become the scene of many an inspir
ing open-air production, many a graduation
ceremony, many a symphony under the stars.
But the problem of sapping the potentialities
from the Frosts' distinctive gift remains with
the University, and that problem is opening up
with many ramifications. First hitch is the al
most prohibitive cost of using it.
Last June, when the Amphitheater was used
for the first and only time, it cost more than $700
to prepare it for Commencement crowds. To
take chairs out of storage, carry them by hand
into the bowl, set them up, dust and then take
them back to storage, costs about seven cents
each.
Because 10,000 chairs must be handled in this
way within 24 hours' time (only such speed will
save the grass), 60 to 100 men must be hired.
Salaries and equipment for these men cannot
be provided much more cheaply than they were
last spring. Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds James W. McDonnell estimates that,
by slashing costs to the minimum, the work
could be done for $500 or five cents a chair, but
these economies might result in costly damage
to the sod which lines the Amphitheater's floor.

Of course capacity seating arrangements
need not be made every time the bowl is used.
But even five cents a chair is almost prohibitive
for anything short of Commencement or the
San Francisco Symphony.
There are, however, side-steps to the cost
problem. Casting out permanent seating ar
rangements which would cost about five dollars
a seat and ruin the natural beauty of the bowl,
there is still the possibility of using the turfed
floor itself.
Next spring, when the rain is not raining all
around, there will be the return of balmy nights,
we hope, and Stanford may use its open air
bowl as an open air bowl should be used. As
suming that the Stanford posterior is granted
the gift of a cushion or blanket, there is no
apparent reason why the bowl's cost-problem
should not be solved by omitting the chairs en
tirely, spreading the audience out informally
over the natural grassy slope. If necessary, the
University could reasonably provide cushions
for the cause.
Whatever the solution be, Stanford should,
through deference to the donors, utilize the gift
to near-potentiality. No criticism is made for
not having done so yet —there hasn't been time.
But through the spring, despite the stymie of
seat-costs, the Lawrence Frost Amphitheater
should be definitely a part of the Stanford
scene.—J. R.
