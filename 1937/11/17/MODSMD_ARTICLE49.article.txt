# Anything Worth Doing
## 
### 
THE Boad of Athletic Control failed to grant
a request for a $1250 intramural playing
field at its meeting last Friday.
It has done something better.
The request was referred by the Board to its
committee on finances mainly because it was
felt that $1250 might not be enough to construct
an adequate field. The possibility of turfing the
field, not provided for in the original estimate,
will be investigated.
Some of the members had known of the
phenomenal growth of intramural in the last few
years, some had not. All agreed that the sport
deserved the push that a separate field would
give. But they wanted to do the job right.
The Board now seems to realize that Stanford
has one of the outstanding intramural programs
in the country, could have the finest if given
room to continue its growth.
The Daily hopes the Board has a good mem
ory when the proposal comes out of committee.
