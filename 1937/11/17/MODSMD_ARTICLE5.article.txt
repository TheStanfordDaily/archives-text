VISALIA. Nov. 16 (UP). â€” The
feeding and housing of more than
5000 children of Dust Bowl migrant
families in Tulare County, many of
them "visibly suffering from mal
nutrition," constitutes a pi-oblem of
national import, Roy Driggers, Tu
lare County superintendent of
schools, declared today. In a letter
to Mrs. B. C. Clark, president of
the California Congress of Parents
and Teachers, Mr. Driggers asked
state parent-tcachcr associations to
join in seeking Federal funds to
care for the migrants during the
coming winter.
