READING WRITING RIGHT
IN these days when the question of propaganda is
getting more publicity than a Hollywood divorce,
the American newspapers stand in a curious position.
A large part of their public has become so allergic to
propaganda that it stalks every printed word as though
the little thing were a savage beast. Contrasted to
these doubters is the placid majority of readers who
continue to gulp down whatever they are told, digest
ing without apparent injury tales of blood in the gut
ter, politicians in the trough, and dictators in the
soup.
The skeptical believe nothing; the trustful swallow
everything. But it would take a police dragnet to find
a man who reads the newspapers critically, digging
out the reliable stories from the mass of press agent
distortions.
* * * *
For some years, educators have kept in stock a
plan to promote better understanding of news. Briefly,
the idea is to teach a course in reading newspapers.
Students would be told what sources are usually
reliable, and which agencies can be expected to keep
up a fairly high batting average. They would be taught
where to look in a paper for certain kinds of news.
And they would be shown how to go through a story
and pick out the points that indicate whether it comes
from a good tip or from the correspondent's absinthe.
So far the universities have done practically noth
ing about the plan. They have taken it out from time
to time, dusted it off, shown it to visitors. And then
they have put it back on the shelf, saying, "It doesn't
.suit my complexion just at the moment." General
opinion is that the course would be too simple for a
university, and that students wouldn't take it.
* * * *
l$ u T there would be many advantages to teaching
the college student how to read the newspapers.
As it is, we have learned just enough about it to
doubt everything we see. When we are shown pic
tures of mangled Spaniards and/or Ethiopians, we
have no way of telling whether they were taken on
the bloody field or in a back room on Fifty-second
Street. We discount them vaguely, and turn to the
sports section.
Most students would be very glad to learn the
difference between "sources usuallv reliable" and
"sources close to the government." Nobody seems to
know which one to bank on when they contradict each
other. And when the Domei (Japanese news agency)
tells that they need another adding machine to total
Chinese casualties, we would all like to know what
number to divide by.
* * * *
A good course in reading the newspapers would do
a lot to correct the "apathy" that our critics score so
viciously. We would form opinions much more read
ily if we knew what to use for a basis.
The course might be simple; probably it wouldn't
rank with accounting or Econ I. But if college stu
dents don't know a subject, the fact that: it would be
easy to teach is no reason for ignoring it. And then
too, it isn't often that easy courses are left drooping
on the registration sidelines.
If the universities are looking for a new toy, I
would like to suggest a course in reading the news
papers.

As it is, we have learned just enough about it to
doubt everything we see. When we are shown pic

READING WRITING RIGHT
IN these days when the question of propaganda is
getting more publicity than a Hollywood divorce,
the American newspapers stand in a curious position.
A large part of their public has become so allergic to
propaganda that it stalks every printed word as though
the little thing were a savage beast. Contrasted to
these doubters is the placid majority of readers who
continue to gulp down whatever they are told, digest
ing without apparent injury tales of blood in the gut
ter, politicians in the trough, and dictators in the
soup.
The skeptical believe nothing; the trustful swallow
everything. But it would take a police dragnet to find
a man who reads the newspapers critically, digging
out the reliable stories from the mass of press agent
distortions.
* * * *
For some years, educators have kept in stock a
plan to promote better understanding of news. Briefly,
the idea is to teach a course in reading newspapers.
Students would be told what sources are usually
reliable, and which agencies can be expected to keep
up a fairly high batting average. They would be taught
where to look in a paper for certain kinds of news.
And they would be shown how to go through a story
and pick out the points that indicate whether it comes
from a good tip or from the correspondent's absinthe.
