'T'HE Peseta Sty for pigskin prominents set aside last
Friday night as THE night that they would put
all their power on THE rushees.
At 6:15 the cook looked at the hashers and the
hashers looked at the house manager—no steaks.
There came then a wholesale phone call to Stanford's
Wassail Commissary; subject—no steaks. The Com
missary said, oops it was sorry but it had sent them
over to the Tri-Delt house by mistake.
Call to Tri-Delt housemother, who thought the
Peseta Sty boys were just joking when they asked if
a steer had walked in the door, so she gave them a
bum one. Second call to Tri-Delt housemother at
6:30.
Comment of housemother: "These Peseta Sty boys
are such kidders." Third Call at 7 o'clock to Tri-Delt
housemother. Comment: "Oh, boys." By 8:30 50 steaks
were delivered by the Wassail Commissary at the Tri-
Delt house. But by that time the Peseta Sty rushers
and rushees had eaten scrambled eggs.
Comment by the Peseta Sty boys: "We may be
great kidders but we mean it when we say that we
are such a strong bunch of guys that we can give
our nugs ugs and make um lug ut."
* * * *
News Item: "Big Game stickers will be disti'ibuted
by Rally Committee this week, bearing the legend,
'Bring Back the Axe,' which has been made the official
slogan of the pre-Game celebration."
Comment: The official hat is red and white, the
officia lrally is Thursday night, the official Gaieties sale
brought a fight, the official night might set things
right, the game, however, will be Saturday at 2 p.m.
students are expected to show enthusiasm.

Headline: "Scalper Gets 75 hours for Extortion
Sale."
Comment: Cellar gets 35 cents for blue plate lunch
without lunch. Stanford gets Union Dollar for Union,
Theater Dollar for Theater, and charges rent for
lights of same. "Resolved that colleges and universi
ties should subsidize their athletes," at 8 o'clock in
Room 100. Naw, let's just give 'em six. Students are
expected to show enthusiasm.

'T'HE Peseta Sty for pigskin prominents set aside last
Friday night as THE night that they would put
all their power on THE rushees.
At 6:15 the cook looked at the hashers and the
hashers looked at the house manager—no steaks.
There came then a wholesale phone call to Stanford's
Wassail Commissary; subject—no steaks. The Com
missary said, oops it was sorry but it had sent them
over to the Tri-Delt house by mistake.
Call to Tri-Delt housemother, who thought the
Peseta Sty boys were just joking when they asked if
a steer had walked in the door, so she gave them a
bum one. Second call to Tri-Delt housemother at
6:30.
Comment of housemother: "These Peseta Sty boys
are such kidders." Third Call at 7 o'clock to Tri-Delt
housemother. Comment: "Oh, boys." By 8:30 50 steaks
were delivered by the Wassail Commissary at the Tri-
Delt house. But by that time the Peseta Sty rushers
and rushees had eaten scrambled eggs.
Comment by the Peseta Sty boys: "We may be
great kidders but we mean it when we say that we
are such a strong bunch of guys that we can give
our nugs ugs and make um lug ut."
