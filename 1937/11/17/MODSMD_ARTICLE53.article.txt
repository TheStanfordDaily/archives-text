A definite "must" for psych ma
jors and an interesting piece of
reading for the laity, John Coig
nard's novel, "The Spectacle of a
Man," offers an exhaustive picture of
the methods of psychoanalysis.

When Arnold
Harvesting first
came to the nar
rator of the story,
he was a middle
aged recluse, kept
aloof from the
world by a natur
al shyness aug
mented by a
painful stutter.
When he finished

a course of treatments six months
later he had been in and out of one
love-affair, and another was about
to culminate in marriage.
The gradual development of Har
vesting's personality under the skill
ed tutelage of the narrator forms
the main and only theme of the
book. Written from what the author
says are clinical records of an ac
tual case, it traces the patient
through his gradual realization of the
mental barriers which are standing
in his way, and makes clear the way
in which he is helped to overcome
them.
Perhaps not a book for light read
ing, but a very interesting study of
an interesting science, "The Spec
tacle of a Man" is the first attempt
to describe psychoanalysis in terms
of fiction.
Whether you agree with the con
clusions drawn or not, you will find
it good and worthwhile reading.
