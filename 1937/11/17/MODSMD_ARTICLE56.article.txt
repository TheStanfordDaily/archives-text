# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
Editor, Sir:
The Men's Council might do well
to reconsider its seventy-five-hour
penalty imposed on "a certain stu
dent" for scalping Gaieties tickets,
If we are to take the Daily story as
a complete review of the facts, it is
obvious to anyone that the Council
is acting ex post facto.
Nor does it seem possible to imag
ine any additional facts which could
be said to exaggerate the "crime"
giving rise to a seventy-five-hour
penalty. Was the "certain student"
rude to the Council? If so, he should
have been fined for contempt, and
not for scalping.
No Notice
Neither the "certain student" nor
any other member of the campus
community could be said to have
been on notice as to the criminal
nature of scalping Gaieties tickets.
To my knowledge, the practice has
been widespread for at least the last
seven years.
The innocent attitude of the scalp
er is illustrated by the certain stu
dent himself, who advertised his
tickets on a public bulletin board,
and signed his name for anyone to
see.
Big Game Different
Nor is the case comparable to
penalties imposed for scalping Big
Game ticketsâ€”for all the campus
has been openly informed of such
penalties.
The scalping of Gaieties tickets
may be against campus policy, and
I am inclined to think it is; but no
student can be expected to intuit
the existence of such a policy, much
less that the violation of the policy
would result in criminal penalties.
Beyond Justice
If the Men's Council wants to dis
courage the scalping of Gaieties
tickets, making an example of the
first person caught (after the crimi
nal nature of the act has be->n de
clared) is an excellent, though
slightly unjust, way to do it. But
it is beyond all justice to punish a
student for an act which was not
criminal when it was committed.
It is to be hoped that the Council
will have guts enough to acknowl
edge its mistake, withdrawing all
penalties; or that Dr. Wilbur will
decline to approve the Council's
minutes.
