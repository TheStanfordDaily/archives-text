# Dancer Will Lead Junior Orchesis
## 
### 
this week by Jo Poor, last week's
guest leader. She will present dance
technique featured at the recent
Mills College Dance Symposium.
All women students are urged to
attend Junior Orchesis meetings,
since it is the only dance group which
does not require tryouts. Valuable
technical experience may be gained
in this way by dancers wishing to
try out for Orchesis Society at a
later date.
Fifteen Stanford dancers, includ
ing two representatives from begin
ning classes, participated in the
Fifth Annual Dance Symposium held
at Mills College on November 14.
Representatives from California,
College of the Pacific, and San
Francisco, Fresno, and San Jose
State Colleges also attended.
