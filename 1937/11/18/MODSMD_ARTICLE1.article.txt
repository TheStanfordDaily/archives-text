# Big Game Bonfire Building Today Up To Freshmen
## Rain Puts Construction Behind Schedule; 10-hour Job Ahead for Frosh 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
Tonight's bonfire will be the worst in recent years if freshmen fail to
turn out en masse today to nullify the effects of several days' rain, ac
cording to a statement made yesterday by Head Yell Leader Jim Kansohoff.
Work will start at <S o'clock this morning, when freshmen arc expected
to report at Lagunita for service under Bonfire Chairman Ed Barnett.

"We have more material than<
we're had in years," Barnett said
last night. "The whole thing is up
to the freshmen now."
Behind Schedule
Set behind schedule, Ransohoff
indicated, because of unfavorable
weather, construction on the bonfire
has advanced only as far as the
framework. Main part of the pyre
must go in piace today. "It's a good
10-hour job for at least 700 people,"
he said.
Continued rains early this week
made the ground so slippery that
trucks carrying material for the
bonfire could advance only a short
way onto the lake bed, were forced
to deposit their loads some 50 feet
from the site selected for the con
flagration. All this material must be
moved near the framework before
actual construction can begin.
Lake Bed Drier
Barrett, however, reported the
lake bed to be much drier last
night, said he believed the bonfire
would be completed by 5 o'clock
today.
Central flue of the pyre is 45 feet
high, outside poles 25 feet. The
bonfire is being built in a triangle,
poles set 35 feet apart.
Freshmen stood an all-night guard
last night against possible Cal raid
ers. Spotlights from the boathouse
were trained on the framework of
the bonfire.
Men working on the bonfire today
will be served lunch by a group of
21 Roble women, under the direc
tion of Betty Davis.
Food Donations
Donations for the lunch include
150 sandwiches from each sorority
on campus, punch from Lagunita
Court, potato salad from Encina,
cookies and ice cream from Union
and Roble, Beechnut gum, Philip
Morris cigarettes, and chocolate
bars from the Ghirardelli Company.
Seven trucks will pick up the last
bonfire material today from Bur
lingame, San Mateo, and Woodside.
Two carloads of railroad ties arrived
yesterday from the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Wayne Leonard, representing the
Axe Society, is in charge of organ
izing frosh workers today.

Work will start at <S o'clock this morning, when freshmen arc expected
to report at Lagunita for service under Bonfire Chairman Ed Barnett.

"We have more material than<
we're had in years," Barnett said
last night. "The whole thing is up
to the freshmen now."
Behind Schedule
Set behind schedule, Ransohoff
indicated, because of unfavorable
weather, construction on the bonfire
has advanced only as far as the
framework. Main part of the pyre
must go in piace today. "It's a good
10-hour job for at least 700 people,"
he said.
Continued rains early this week
made the ground so slippery that
trucks carrying material for the
bonfire could advance only a short
way onto the lake bed, were forced
to deposit their loads some 50 feet
from the site selected for the con
flagration. All this material must be
moved near the framework before
actual construction can begin.
Lake Bed Drier
Barrett, however, reported the
lake bed to be much drier last
night, said he believed the bonfire
would be completed by 5 o'clock
today.
Central flue of the pyre is 45 feet
high, outside poles 25 feet. The
bonfire is being built in a triangle,
poles set 35 feet apart.
Freshmen stood an all-night guard
last night against possible Cal raid
ers. Spotlights from the boathouse
were trained on the framework of
the bonfire.
Men working on the bonfire today
will be served lunch by a group of
21 Roble women, under the direc
tion of Betty Davis.
Food Donations
Donations for the lunch include
150 sandwiches from each sorority
on campus, punch from Lagunita
Court, potato salad from Encina,
cookies and ice cream from Union
and Roble, Beechnut gum, Philip
Morris cigarettes, and chocolate
bars from the Ghirardelli Company.
Seven trucks will pick up the last
bonfire material today from Bur
lingame, San Mateo, and Woodside.
Two carloads of railroad ties arrived
yesterday from the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Wayne Leonard, representing the
Axe Society, is in charge of organ
izing frosh workers today.
Tonight's bonfire will be the worst in recent years if freshmen fail to
turn out en masse today to nullify the effects of several days' rain, ac
cording to a statement made yesterday by Head Yell Leader Jim Kansohoff.
