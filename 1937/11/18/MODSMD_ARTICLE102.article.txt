# Stuart Makes Camera, Wins Glory With Photos
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Mr. Burton Stuart has been working on the Stanford campus for about
20 years, and today for the first time people on (he Farm are seeing some
of his work. Even now they don't know who Mr. Stuart is.
lie is a technician in the physics department. Ilis work that people
have noticed today is four pictures running in this issue of The Daily. It

is evidence of his hobby.
He has been taking pictures on
and off for over 20 years. He got
his first camera when he was still
in grammar school.
Made Own Camera
"It was curiosity as much as any
thing else that started me, I guess,"
he says. "I got my first camera in
grafnmar school and I wanted to fig
ure out how it worked. I couldn't
for a long time."
But he found out how that cam
era worked, and that he was inter
ested in photography. So he kept
taking pictures and eventually made
a view camera of his own. It looks,
as he pointed out, surprisingly like
every other camera of the kind. He
has three different lenses he can put
in the camera. He didn't make the
lenses. With this camera he has
been taking pictures for several
years, mostly artistic shots, as you
can see from looking at his pictures
in the rotogravure section of this
paper.
'Not Much Glory'
He seemed surprised when we
asked him what prizes he had won
with his pictures. "None," he an
swered. "Oh, once I won $11 in a
contest in the city, and I've won a
few awards. But I never try to sell
any of my pictures. I just show
them for the glory. And there's not
much glory."
He has belonged to the Photo
graphic Society of San Francisco for
about four years, and he is secre

tary of the Palo Alto Camera Club.
But besides taking excellent pic
tures, Mr. Stuart develops all of his
own stuff, makes his enlargements,
and he made his own enlarger. And
while he didn't make the lenses for
! his camera, he does make lenses.
From making lenses, his hobby
strayed a littleâ€”he started making
mirrors for telescopes. He has made
; half a dozen or so mirrors, and one
; complete telescope.
But even in his work his hobby
comes in. Very often the physics
; department has some model or
piece of machinery of which there
is no time to have a drawing made
or where a drawing would fail to
show what is desix'ed. So Mr. Stuart
unlimbers his camera and takes a
picture. He takes all of the depart
i ment's lantern slides, etc.
