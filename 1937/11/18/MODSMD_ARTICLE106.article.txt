# State Division Delays Local Subway Plans
## Paly To Purchase Land; Government Grant To Finance Project 
### 
Plans for a subway at the inter
section of University Avenue and
Southern Pacific railway tracks are
still under consideration by the State
Highway Division, according to Al
fred L. Trowbridge, assistant comp
troller. The plan, proposed last sum
mar, has already secured the un
official approval of the University
Board of Trustees.
Most of the expense of the project
will be borne by the Federal govern
ment. Construction will be financed
by a grant of $300,000 made from a
Federal Bureau of Roads fund ad
ministered by the State of Califor
nia. The City of Palo Alto will pay
for required lights of way and for
liabilities.
Present Plan
The present plan involves moving
the railroad tracks from 70 to 80 feet
west of theii present position, elevat
ing them about five feet at the Uni
versity Avenue intersection. The
underpass would have four vehicu
lar lanes and a bridge over Alma
Street.
The ramp of the subway would
start at the edge of the Circle. As it
is planned now, the project would

not alter property rights on Alma
Street or on the Circle.
Right of Way
As the right of way involves land
owned by the University, plans must
be approved by the Trustees. The
Board has indicated that it will ac
cept the present plan.
The Highway Division is also con- ;
sideling the possibility of combin
ing the subway with an underpass
at the El Camino Real intersection
of University Avenue. It is under
stood, however, that the trustees
disapprove of any plan which would
change the University entrance.
