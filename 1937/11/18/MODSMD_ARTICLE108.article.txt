# Sandstone Goes On Cubberley Building
## Derricks Set To Swing First Blocks In New Structure Today 
### 
Sandstone blocks, the traditional material for Stanford buildings, will
start swinging into place today on the new Cubherley Education Building.
Derricks have been set in place to boist the heavy slabs onto the arcade
between the new structure and the Library. This is the first time that
sandstone has been used on a building on the I'arm since the Library
was built.
Pouring of concrete for the walls of the first and second story is prac
tically complete, according to John Levers, superintendent of construction.
Reinforcing beams on the third floor of the structure are ready for con
crete work to start there shortly.
The Education Building is really taking form, and work is progressing
on schedule. It is slated for completion at the end of spring quarter, j

Installation of steam pipes in the*
basement is well undei way. All
beams have been erected, but there i
are no partitions in the interior of
the .structure as yet.
The large sandstone blocks of the
exterior will be set one on the
.other with mortar between them
just as bricks are laid, explained
Mr. Levers yesterday. Stone frames
will be built to support the arches.
The completed building will har
monize with the Library and the
Quad. It follows the typical Stan
lord style of architecture, stressing
horizontal lines, arches, and tiled
roofs. An arcade will connect the
Education Building with the Library
to accommodate easy access between
them.

Although the facade and arcade
will be finished in sandstone, two
wings on either side will be covered
with stucco. The structure faces the
( Quad. There will be two stories in
front and three in the rear.
The Education Building is the j
gift of Dean Emeritus Elwood Cub- j
berly of the School of Education.
He presented the University with i
$500,000 to build it; the fund arose !
from profits on investments and I
textbooks which Dean Cubberly set
aside -for Stanford.
Auditorium Planned
The new building will contain an
auditorium, seating 720, complete
with a balcony and a projection
room; it will be used for lectures and
conferences.
This assembly room will be com
pletely air-conditioned. Classrooms,
oflices, and work rooms occupy much
of the building. Special rooms for
child research have been provided.
It is predicted that the new Cubberly i
Building will house one of the best- I
equipped schools of education in the j
country.

Installation of steam pipes in the*
basement is well undei way. All
beams have been erected, but there i
are no partitions in the interior of
the .structure as yet.
The large sandstone blocks of the
exterior will be set one on the
.other with mortar between them
just as bricks are laid, explained
Mr. Levers yesterday. Stone frames
will be built to support the arches.
The completed building will har
monize with the Library and the
Quad. It follows the typical Stan
lord style of architecture, stressing
horizontal lines, arches, and tiled
roofs. An arcade will connect the
Education Building with the Library
to accommodate easy access between
them.

Although the facade and arcade
will be finished in sandstone, two
wings on either side will be covered
with stucco. The structure faces the
( Quad. There will be two stories in
front and three in the rear.
The Education Building is the j
gift of Dean Emeritus Elwood Cub- j
berly of the School of Education.
He presented the University with i
$500,000 to build it; the fund arose !
from profits on investments and I
textbooks which Dean Cubberly set
aside -for Stanford.
Auditorium Planned
The new building will contain an
auditorium, seating 720, complete
with a balcony and a projection
room; it will be used for lectures and
conferences.
This assembly room will be com
pletely air-conditioned. Classrooms,
oflices, and work rooms occupy much
of the building. Special rooms for
child research have been provided.
It is predicted that the new Cubberly i
Building will house one of the best- I
equipped schools of education in the j
country.
Sandstone blocks, the traditional material for Stanford buildings, will
start swinging into place today on the new Cubherley Education Building.
Derricks have been set in place to boist the heavy slabs onto the arcade
between the new structure and the Library. This is the first time that
sandstone has been used on a building on the I'arm since the Library
was built.
Pouring of concrete for the walls of the first and second story is prac
tically complete, according to John Levers, superintendent of construction.
Reinforcing beams on the third floor of the structure are ready for con
crete work to start there shortly.
