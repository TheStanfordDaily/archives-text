# Cards Offer Subsidy Plan in Bear Debate
## 
### HARRY SHELDON 
Presenting a formal plan for the legal subsidization of college athletics.
Football Men Grant Stone and Jack Walton last night debated Martin
Rothenberg and Robert Stevenson, University of California debaters, in a
no-decision fray.
The Bear squad took the negative of the question "Resolved, that col
leges and universities should subsidize their athletes," with a plea for

►amateur athletics on grounds tnat
subsidization leads to over-emphasis
and consequent deterioration of the
educational system.
Stone and Walton's plea, however,
was presented with a view to dis
emphasizing college athletics.
Stone Offers Plan
"Our plan would call for a cen
tral committee, under the auspices
of the University, to have the sole
power to pass on athletes wanting
financial aid," Stone declared. "This
aid would be given, not in dollars
I and cents, but in the payment of
j tuition and necessary living ex-
I penses.
"Statistics show that approxi
' mately 50 per cent of the students
of the United States must work their
way through school, and the univer
sities aid with scholarships and fees
such students as can assist in scien
tific laboratories, in journalism, and
in managerial positions.
"Why not also aid athletes in the
work they are best fitted for?" he
queried.
•Dangerous'—Defense
In reply, the California men main
tained that the "results of this plan
for subsidization would shake the
foundations of our educational in
stitutions," and that "athletics would
be permitted to u.surp the functions
of education."
They also pointed out the imprac
ticalities of such a plan and asserted
that it would be difficult to know
where to draw the line betweer
major and minor sports.
"What we say on this subject is
our own idea," Stone emphasized.
I in introduction, "and not necessarily
I that of the University."
