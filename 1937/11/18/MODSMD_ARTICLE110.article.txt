# Seek Santas at Stanford Bring Your Own Reindeer
## 
### 
Solved is the problem of Christ
mas employment for the Stanford
rough! This holiday season he may
wander about in happily unshaven
state, clad in patriotic garb of red
and white, and what's more, he'll be
paid for it.
All this through the ingenuity of
Alice S. Gilman, who has recently
organized a San Francisco branch of
the Santa Claus Service, North Pole,
and now seeks from fifty to one
hundred appropriately plump col
lege men as active agents.
In a recent letter to The Daily,
Miss Gilman outlined her plans.

| "The service consists of supplying
Santa Clauses that have been well
trained, to visit children in person
on Christmas Eve. Santa Claus ar
rives, garbed in his usual red and
white and with his proverbial snow
white beard. He knows the child's
name, age, some personal habit (such
i as that he doesn't like to brush his
teeth), and some gift that he is to
receive for Christmas, and sits down
and has a ten-minute chat with the
child.
That a great responsibility is in
volved in the choice of the Santa
Clauses is further explained by Miss

] Gilman, who declares that her desire
j for a "higher type" of person leads
; her to limit the service to college
men exclusively.
| "We would prefer men with fairly
j large physiques," she goes on to say,
"because of the popular tradition of
1 Santa Claus' plumpness. However, ;
! with pillows, a costume, and make- j
up, I am quite sure that any man of
j average height and weight would
i fulfill the requirements." She also j
I adds that dramatic training of any |
| sort is unnecessary, "as all the men
! would be thoroughly coached."
Robust roughs who might fit the 1
rigid requirements of Santa Claus
j Service are urged to apply at Room
228, 116 New Montgomery Street,
I San Francisco, or phone Sutter 6266.
Evening appointments as well as ;
1 daytime ones can be arranged for j
prospective Saint Nicks.
j On the statute books of North Da- j
kota is an old statute making it un
lawful to swear into a telephone. |

Solved is the problem of Christ
mas employment for the Stanford
rough! This holiday season he may
wander about in happily unshaven
state, clad in patriotic garb of red
and white, and what's more, he'll be
paid for it.
All this through the ingenuity of
Alice S. Gilman, who has recently
organized a San Francisco branch of
the Santa Claus Service, North Pole,
and now seeks from fifty to one
hundred appropriately plump col
lege men as active agents.
In a recent letter to The Daily,
Miss Gilman outlined her plans.

| "The service consists of supplying
Santa Clauses that have been well
trained, to visit children in person
on Christmas Eve. Santa Claus ar
rives, garbed in his usual red and
white and with his proverbial snow
white beard. He knows the child's
name, age, some personal habit (such
i as that he doesn't like to brush his
teeth), and some gift that he is to
receive for Christmas, and sits down
and has a ten-minute chat with the
child.
That a great responsibility is in
volved in the choice of the Santa
Clauses is further explained by Miss
