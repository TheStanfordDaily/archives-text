# "Integrity" Is Keynote Of Life of Norris
## 
### 
Few men live to see themselves I
deified us George W. Norris has been
deified in his own lifetime.
Fewer yet have honest claim to j
that deification.
Among these few, eyes snapping ,
and white shock of hair tossing an- j
grily, stands the senior Senator from !
the state of Nebraska, whose career j
has finully been done justice in the j
recently published "Integrity: Ihe
Life of George W. Norris."
Senator Norris began political life j
as a small-town lawyer in a town of
10.000. He is ending it as one of the
group which has perhaps done more
than anything else to influence the
lives of future generations in Amer
ica: the Senate insurgents.
Overthrew Cannon
From the time he and a little ]
group of "radical" members of the
House of Representatives overthrew

the parliamentary
dictatorship of
"Uncle Joe" Can
non to the time
when he saw his
dream of govern
mentally produced
electricity come
true in the Ten
nessee Valley, his
career has been
built around one

principle—the principle which the
authors have chosen to call "integ
rity."
Integrity it has been. Integrity
when he and five colleagues voted
against the Declaration of War in
1917—an action which brought upon
them the full force of unrestrained
public hatred and vilification.
Integrity when he swept Nebraska
in 1934 in a campaign made notable

ballot by the" Republican campaign
committee, in the mistaken assump
tion that two George W. Norrises
would so confuse the voters that they 1
would elect the wrong one.
Integrity Rules
Integrity when he criticized the
Supreme Court long before Roose
velt did—and without the backstairs
tactics which characterized the Roo
sevelt message.
Integrity, in short, in everything
he has ever undertaken, in the
United States Senate or out of it,
integrity which has made him a
symbol of hope to all men ol good
will and a major statesman to rank
with any the twentieth century has
produced.
There is little one can add to the '
simple record of a life such as Nor
ris'; and the authors of "Integrity"
have wisely not tried to. Unadorned j
and inspiring, it stands as a fitting
tribute to a truly great American.

From the time he and a little ]
group of "radical" members of the
House of Representatives overthrew

the parliamentary
dictatorship of
"Uncle Joe" Can
non to the time
when he saw his
dream of govern
mentally produced
electricity come
true in the Ten
nessee Valley, his
career has been
built around one

principle—the principle which the
authors have chosen to call "integ
rity."
Integrity it has been. Integrity
when he and five colleagues voted
against the Declaration of War in
1917—an action which brought upon
them the full force of unrestrained
public hatred and vilification.
Integrity when he swept Nebraska
in 1934 in a campaign made notable

ballot by the" Republican campaign
committee, in the mistaken assump
tion that two George W. Norrises
would so confuse the voters that they 1
would elect the wrong one.
Integrity Rules
Integrity when he criticized the
Supreme Court long before Roose
velt did—and without the backstairs
tactics which characterized the Roo
sevelt message.
Integrity, in short, in everything
he has ever undertaken, in the
United States Senate or out of it,
integrity which has made him a
symbol of hope to all men ol good
will and a major statesman to rank
with any the twentieth century has
produced.
There is little one can add to the '
simple record of a life such as Nor
ris'; and the authors of "Integrity"
have wisely not tried to. Unadorned j
and inspiring, it stands as a fitting
tribute to a truly great American.

Few men live to see themselves I
deified us George W. Norris has been
deified in his own lifetime.
Fewer yet have honest claim to j
that deification.
Among these few, eyes snapping ,
and white shock of hair tossing an- j
grily, stands the senior Senator from !
the state of Nebraska, whose career j
has finully been done justice in the j
recently published "Integrity: Ihe
Life of George W. Norris."
Senator Norris began political life j
as a small-town lawyer in a town of
10.000. He is ending it as one of the
group which has perhaps done more
than anything else to influence the
lives of future generations in Amer
ica: the Senate insurgents.
