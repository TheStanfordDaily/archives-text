## And The Ball Game Is Only Part Of It 
### 
BOIL water in a closed vessel and it bursts.
Add a safety valve and it doesn't. Safety
valve for Stanford is the Big Game, and for the
last three days and the next two. the Farm will
blow off steam over a couple of hours of foot
ball game in the stadium, Saturday afternoon.
Look at it academically and it's a lot of foolish
ness. Look at it actually, and it's one of the most
colorful, interesting, vital experiences which
Stanford people will be able to include in a life
time. And the colorful, interesting, vital expe
riences are those which make the lifetime worth
the time.
So the Big Game tomorrow is not just a deci
sion of whose Bottari can outgain whose Fay, or
whose Zagar can outcharge whose Stoll. It s
more than whose football team is the best on
the Pacific Coast, or whose squad is worthy of
a Rose Bowl bid, or who has a wonder team. It s
more than just football.
The Big Game is now 43 years of accumulated

tradition, of colorful background, of successive
blasts from Stanford and California safety valves
upon which has been built up many a year of
accumulated pressure. Even the words Big
Game now mean more than two or three hours
of football.
The Big Game is a several-day blast of Gaie
ties, bonfire, rally, jolly-up, special Daily, and
more, the insane scramble to whip all this into
shape the last minute. It's always done the last
minute, and it's always a scramble.
But it's going to go down in many a memory
as one of the highlights of youthâ€”and that alone
justifies it as worth while.
And sometime early Sunday morning when
the last "Come Join the Band" drifts off toward
a rising sun, if we may wax a bit, another chap
ter of Big Game is over. It's all mad and foolish,
and juvenile indeed. But it's the safety valve we
need, and we like it.
It's the Big Game.
