ONE year ago there was a crash of splintered
beams and a spray of powdered plaster
that typified, in one act, the entire point of the
'36 Gaieties. It was the last Gaieties in the old
Assembly, so they tore the house down.
That act wasn't all in fun. there was a bit of
vindictiveness in it. Producing shows in a hall
outmoded 30 years ago had bred resentment.
Gaieties producers and song-writers thought
they had the stuff to merit national attention, but
old technical eguipment was holding them back.
Give the Gaieties two years, three years in
a new theater, they said, and Stanford-written
songs would be heard all over the country as
was Princeton's "Love on a Dime" a few years
ago.
In Memorial Hall the producers have what
they wanted, a showhouse that is the equal of
any. Talent and song scouts in the audience
will hear the show in a perfect technical set
ting.
This year's Gaieties has not been reported
as a standout, though those who saw dress re
hearsals are enthusiastic. But good or bad, it is
supposed to start the new era in student musi
cals.
And that era is expected to start tonight.—L. L.
