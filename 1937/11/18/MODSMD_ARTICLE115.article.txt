# BULL SESSION
## WHEN I GROW TOO OLD TO SCREAM 
### 
\Y/HEN the Red Revolution is finished, when the old
* est general has faded into Canada and the young
est economic royalist has been fired, the efficiency
experts will reign supreme. And the first thing they
will do is regiment the Big Game. The economic
waste connected with the game is enough to make
any good communist weep in his vodka. At the very
thought of such sinful waste of energy and resources,
a commissar would get mad enough to shoot six extra
generals before breakfast.
The amount of power wasted at the game itself
is large enough. Probably it would keep a peanut
roaster going for 20 years, thus diverting the power
now used in peanut roasting to munitions manufac
ture. It doesn't take a mathematician to realize how
much energy is going up with every line buck and
with every axe yell. RansohofTs activities alone, if
properly channelled, would propel a coaster wagon
half way to Oakland.
# * * *
But in comparison with the energy we blow off
before and after the game, the line buck waste is in
significant. For weeks before the brawl, rally com
mittee sits up nights drawing surrealist pictures on
graph paper. Freshmen raid woodpiles and struggle
home with the loot. Paly homesteaders curse and
storm, and sit up nights watching their wood.
In the home-stretch, frosh guard the bonfire all
night, and two or three times an evening the campus
turns out. rushes madly to the lake bed, and returns
to its own bed swearing. Enterprising roughs invade
the Cal campus, waste gas and tires trying to escape
the law. Co-eds glorying in equality of the sexes
paint a big "S" on the Cal cement and smile the
cops down to a "warning."
r PHE whole thing presents a picture of waste that
would make a psychopathic case of any sensitive
cfTiciency expert. Wood is wasted, paint is wasted,
man-power is wasted, and women's power is wasted
on cops.
Under the communistic state, activities would be so
cially channelled, and energy would be economized.
Picture the Big Game after the Revolution. Every
player wears a dynamo attachment with a leyden jar
to store up the power he expends. Every rooter has a
windmill in his megaphone with a wire leading ofT
the current generated.
The commissar in charge of rally committee wisely
uses all resources. The bonfire is held in a blast fur
nace which casts up statuettes of Karl Marx. All
raiding between schools is forbidden so that sleep
may be uninterrupted and so that girls may smile
on local talent rather than on foreign cops. Card
stunts are forbidden, and the paper is used for
propaganda.
* * « *
A beautiful picture, isn't it? And yet nobody seems
to look forward to it. We like the Big Game the way
il is, even if it does mean that we lose sleep and ruin
our reputations by drowsing in eight o'clocks.
Possibly if shipped to Turkestan, the wood for the
bonfire would be gratefully received by the tribes
men. Possibly if we slept through the night we would
be alert enough to garner one more fact the next day.
Possibly if there were no game, no gaieties, no special
edition of The Daily, we could have sweeter disposi
tions and smaller circles under the eyes. Conceivably,
we might even get to the library occasionally.
♦ * * *
All this is possible. But one thing is certain. If we
didn't have the Big Game with all its fuss and fury,
we would crawl quietly into some corner of the
library and die of disappointment.
The Big Game is like a sweetheart—an awful lot
of bother, but w<* love it.
