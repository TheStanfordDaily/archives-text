# GOIN' MY WAY

### 
WE view with alarm mixed with wonder the ap
parently inevitable trend in the radio field toward
these omnibuses of entertainment. Unless a program
includes a 45-picce orchestra, four latter-day come
dians, a dramatic interlude hacked out of some film
or stage piece, and assorted guestars of one nature or
another, backers feel that they aren't getting their
money's worth.
And now, after subtly boring from within through
these aforesaid variety shows, the movies have openly
showed their hand. M.G.M. leads the way with their
new "Good News" show, bringing to the fore any of
their retinue who seem to need publicity. We say
that no news is good news in this case.
And the hoary "Hit Parade" is going to be re
placed, we hear', by another similar program emanat
ing from the film capital. We suppose there's nothing
especially wrong with the idea—as long as the stuff
that goes on the air is good. But unless they get out
of the groove, it probably won't be. vfc see enough
of these people from Hollywood while sitting through
their "Big" second features. Why bring them on the
, air? Enough is enough.
* * * *
Incidentally, anent the "Hit Parade," we heard an
interesting—if true—story as to why every orchestra
sounds the same on the program. The president of the
sponsorial clan, it seems, doesn't have a knowledge
of music which is exactly subtle—he absolutely must
hear the tune, or it isn't music. Therefore, every
orchestra that plays for him must ride that old melody
until the cows come home, and no two ways about it.
While he was considering a change in orchestras,
one band leader arranged his audition numbers to fit
in with the president's ideas. And then on the first
program went back to his own style. He didn't last
i long.

J OCAL swing boys are moaning to hear that Red
Norvo, who they claim is the only real swing
outfit, to play in S.F. for some time, is making his last
appearance Big Game night. He will be followed by
Freddie Nagel.
Nagel's band is the best campus group to come
from the Farm in quite some time, we think. He hit
his peak here two or three years ago, has been play
ing down at Del Monte for over a year. He puts out
pretty fair swing— 01* at least what the general popu
lace considers swing. Not too extreme, in other words.
He's pleasing, and ought to go pretty well at Ihe
St. Francis, especially wtih the college crowd. He
opens Tuesday night.
* * * *
Add to Big Game night possibilities: Jan Garber,
whose consistent popularity is one of the major phe
nomena of today, is playing at t' Oakland Audito
rium. We are happy to report th. _ne threat to Mr.
Gargle's crown in the grut-music realm by Bubble
and-Squeak Shep Fields has turned out to be merely
a flash in the pan. To our Christmas list, we add two
one-way tickets to Baffin Land for both of them.
Please, Santa.

And while you're at it, Nicholas old boy, how
about a previous visit to the Cal campus with a hand
ful of Mickey Finn's for the Bear team's soup.

Nagel's band is the best campus group to come
from the Farm in quite some time, we think. He hit
his peak here two or three years ago, has been play
ing down at Del Monte for over a year. He puts out
pretty fair swing— 01* at least what the general popu
lace considers swing. Not too extreme, in other words.
He's pleasing, and ought to go pretty well at Ihe
St. Francis, especially wtih the college crowd. He
opens Tuesday night.

WE view with alarm mixed with wonder the ap
parently inevitable trend in the radio field toward
these omnibuses of entertainment. Unless a program
includes a 45-picce orchestra, four latter-day come
dians, a dramatic interlude hacked out of some film
or stage piece, and assorted guestars of one nature or
another, backers feel that they aren't getting their
money's worth.
And now, after subtly boring from within through
these aforesaid variety shows, the movies have openly
showed their hand. M.G.M. leads the way with their
new "Good News" show, bringing to the fore any of
their retinue who seem to need publicity. We say
that no news is good news in this case.
And the hoary "Hit Parade" is going to be re
placed, we hear', by another similar program emanat
ing from the film capital. We suppose there's nothing
especially wrong with the idea—as long as the stuff
that goes on the air is good. But unless they get out
of the groove, it probably won't be. vfc see enough
of these people from Hollywood while sitting through
their "Big" second features. Why bring them on the
, air? Enough is enough.
* * * *
Incidentally, anent the "Hit Parade," we heard an
interesting—if true—story as to why every orchestra
sounds the same on the program. The president of the
sponsorial clan, it seems, doesn't have a knowledge
of music which is exactly subtle—he absolutely must
hear the tune, or it isn't music. Therefore, every
orchestra that plays for him must ride that old melody
until the cows come home, and no two ways about it.
While he was considering a change in orchestras,
one band leader arranged his audition numbers to fit
in with the president's ideas. And then on the first
program went back to his own style. He didn't last
i long.
