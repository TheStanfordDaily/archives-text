# From Trolley to Ties, 1929 Path For Bonfire
## 
### 
Stanford students went to town in .
i 1929, fired with Big Game spirit. |
i They were in search of fuel to make j
j a bonfire bigger, higher, and brighter
j than any in Cardinal history.
Freshmen found a collection of ,
wood, all in one piece. The old Too- \
nerville trolley was, by a coinci
! dence, going to make its last run
' out to the campus one night before
the Big Game. The Peninsula Rail
, road Corporation, owners of the
j street car, announced that after mid
night, service to Stanford would be I
; discontinued. They had found the [
| nickels coming in didn't balance
$100,000 operating expenses.
Lining the street car tracks, 200
roughs waited to capture the relic.
■The potential danger to company
property spread the alarm to the
railroad superintendent. That wor

thy gave orders that the car should
not make the midnight trip. Stu- ]
dents, when apprised of his move,
went in search of the San Jose car,
stationed in Palo Alto for the night.
Some of them, armed with coal oil,
were for holding a premature rally.
Bankruptcy had become a nearer
reality to the transport company,
when Charles G. Hayton, crossing
watchman, had an idea. In his tower
above the turmoil, he could see a
pile of railroad ties, eight feet high
and more than 20 feet long, left be
hind by workmen who had iecently
torn up a branch of the Palo Alto
tracks.
Suggesting that these be given to

the students, he saved the day for
the Southern Pacific subsidiary; sat
-1 isfied the roughs.
The bonfire that year was effee
, tive. Stanford blazed through to u
i 21-6 win over Cal.
