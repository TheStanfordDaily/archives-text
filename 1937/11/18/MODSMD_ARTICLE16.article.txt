# Class of '41 Silently Visits Cal--'C' Turns Red
## 
### 
Through the rain and fog a si
lent column of 20 automobiles sped
northward between midnight and
daybreak yesterday morning.
Reaching Oakland, they stole
through deserted back roads to the
hills behind the University of Cali
fornia campus.
When they returned to Encina,
Cal's Big C was red again—victim
of Big Game rivalry in the form of
120 Farm frosh and 5 gallons of red
paint.
Disorganized groups of frosh had
been talking for a week about paint
ing the landmark. Tuesday night
sentiment materialized and a raid
was organized by two men on
horseback — Berkeleyites who said:
"We hate Cal."
At midnight, the raiders set out

through the dark wetness, heading
around the bay to avoid scrutiny at
bridges. The black column of cars
was a silent, determined machine.
No horns honked; no one swerved
out of line.
Past Oakland, drivers turned out
their lights, creeping at 10 miles
per hour along the secluded hill
road. All they could see through
the fog was the white center line
and the occasional stop-light of a
car ahead.
No Cal guards appeared as the
frosh left their machines and stole
through wet underbrush over the
hill toward the Big C. Slipping
about in the mud, the raiders crept
down the hill over three successive
slopes, each time expecting to see
the big cement initial and a keen

eyed defending garrison.
Seeing dim figures of separated
groups of the raiding party, the
Stanford frosh wondered if they
were Cal guards. "Foo," whispered
the frosh. "Foo," answered the
shadowy figures, now known to be
friends because they had replied
with the password.
Over another slight rise, and there
was the big yellow monument. It
took Stanfordites only 10 minutes to
smear on their $♦> worth of diluted
red paint. Nothing was available for
thinning their paint, hut. they solv
ed the problem by spreading on the
mixture with their hands.
Almost as calculating was the re
turn trip through the Cal campus.
Past the stadium, even past revered
Sather Gate wound the column of

cars, tooting taunting horns at a
sleeping enemy.
"Poor Cal!" was the wail at a San
Francisco restaurant a half hour
later, until a policeman said, "No."
The party returned to the campus
at fi o'clock, marking themselves
from tne hoi polloi by tales of nar
row escapes, red-stained hands, and
addled heads in 8 o'clocks.
They had completed an EFFI
CIENT Cal raid. No one was in
jured the event contrasting sharply
with last year's raid (two Cal
guards slugged to unconsciousness,
threats of lawsuits, general unpleas
antness).
There was only one thing wrong
—Cal went and bought some yaller
paint and immediately repainted the
symbol yesterday.
