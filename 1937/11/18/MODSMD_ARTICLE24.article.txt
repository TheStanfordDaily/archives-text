# 'Hooded Men' Secrete Arms From French
## Discovery of Explosive To Terrorize Paris Spurs Official Action 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 17 (UP).â€” Discovery
of enough high explosives to blow
up one-fourth of Paris and secret
"fortresses" crammed with machine
guns and hand grenades tonight
spurred a nation-wide roundup of
France's "Hooded Men" allegedly
organized for a Rightist revolution.
Authorities charged that the
hooded terrorists, known as "Les
Cagoulards," received support from
the Spanish insurgents and other
Rightist regimes.
Leader Suspected
Colonel Francois de la Roque,
leader of the outlawed Croix de Feu
(Cross of Fire), also was suspected
of having some connection with the
"Hooded Men." One of five persons
under arrest tonight was Rene
Aceaux, former president of the
Deippe division of the Croix de Feu.
Police announced that they had
uncovered a bomb-proof "post of
command" with an elaborate system
of sliding walls and secret cham
bers and that evidence seized there
would lead to more arrests within
48 hours.
Veil of Silence
The terrorists were said by police
to have been recruited from impa
tient partisans of several Rightist
organizations, but as the evidence
was studied at the Surete Nationale
tonight authorities suddenly or
dered a veil of silence thrown over
the entire affair.
Proof of the continued existence
and plottings of the "Hooded Men"
despite a roundup of their members
six weeks ago following the bomb
ings of two employers' syndicate
buildings fell unexpectedly into the
hands of police last night.
