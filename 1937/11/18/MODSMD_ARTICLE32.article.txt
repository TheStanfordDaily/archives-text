# Liebendorfer Goes East To Fix Plans
## 
### 
Don Liebendorfer, news service
director for the Board of Athletic
Control, will leave today for New
York City to assist in giving ad
vance publicity on the Stanford-
Columbia football game on Novem
ber 27.
Liebendorfer had planned to leave
by plane following the Big Game,
but because Columbia has had a
mediocre season, ticket sales have
been poor and he was asked by Co
lumbia officials to move his de
parture up.
