### JERRY MAYER 
Two teams are all that remain in
the battle for the all-University vol
leyball championship following last
night's semi-final round champion
ship tourney games.
The classy Alpha Delts, playing
with only five men, trounced Kap
pa Sigma, 15-3, 15-8, while in the
other game Phi Kappa Sigma nosed
out Sigma Chi, 14-16, 15-2, 16-14, in
a thriling encounter.
The Alpha Delts had no trouble
with the Kappa Sigs, even though
they were playing with one player
less than their foes. Art Stoefen,
Bob Braly and Jim Seaver were
the deadly killers for the Alpha
Delts last night, while Bill Janss
excelled as a set-up man.
After dropping the first game, the
Phi Kaps rallied to outclass their
opponents. In the final "hair-raiser"
the Phi Kaps finally won out. Star
ring for the Phi Kaps were Bill Rou
verol and Gordon Casamajor.
The finals for the school cham
pionship will be held Tuesday night,
with the Alpha Delts favored to take
the crown.
