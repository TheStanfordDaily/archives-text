# 'Legionnaires Red Baiters'â€”Kreps
## 
### 
"American Legionnaires are red
baiters in direct proportion to the
distance they were from the front,"
exclaimed Theodore Kreps, econom
ics professor and president of the
Palo Alto branch of the National
Peace Conference, at Luncheon Club
yesterday.
Kreps used the program of the
National Peace Conference, a joint
organization of peace movements, as
a springboard to discuss war, its
causes, horrors, and abolition.
Kreps declared that one of the
most important measures for the
defeat of war was provision for
peaceful chance. "Causes of revo
lutions," he said, "are invariably re
sistance to change." Kreps conclud
ed, "Peacetime preparedness was
not getting ready for war, but tak
ing an active part in working for
peace."
