SCORELESS WONDERS SHOULD
GO TO ROSE BOWL
Will it be Stanford or Cal in the
Rose Bowl on New Year's Day?
This really isn't important . . . Bill j
Leiser of the Chronicle comes j
through with a campaign for a pre
liminary to the Pasadena classic that |
will cause sporting fans the nation
over to sit up and take notice.
Bill has for several weeks advo
cated a preliminary game on New
Year's Day between Western
Maryland and Colorado State, the
scoreless wonders of the twentieth
century.
Both teams kept their record un
blemished in games last week-end.
Western Maryland barely squeezed
by, however, losing to Canisius by
a scant 0-0 margin. Besides this,
W.M. flirted with an unsuccessful
outcome to her season when she was
held to a scoreless tie earlier in the
year.
Colorado Slate is doing a little
better. There's no scoreless tie to
blemish its record, and th& Staters
came through with flying colors last
Saturday to lose by a convincing
0-45 score to Utah.
Bob Stevens, also of the Chron
icle, comes through with another
bright one. He suggests that Maine
and Vermont play in some sort of
a bowl to settle the Republican
championship.
DINK'S CROSS-COUNTRY
BOYS MEET CAL TODAY
This afternoon at 3:30 Dink Tem
pleton's distance runners will show
what they have when they match
strides with the cross country run
ners from Cal on the Stanford golf
course. If the sun comes out, the
spectators will flock to the first and
ninth holes.
Last year the Cards put eight
men on the field against the Bears'
28, and still the Indian runners
lost by only one point.
Paul Ganahl looks the best of the
Stanfordites. He's really been burn
ing up the turf in practice runs.
Captain Ed Burrows hasn't been up
to par in practice. Some people
claim that Ed just fools around in
practice and you can't tell what he
will do in a meet, but he denies this.
No matter how Ed looks in practice,
I look for him to be right up in the
money when they come pounding
down the fairway to the finish line.
Rusty March, the redhead who
looks and runs like Norman Bright,
but not quite so fast, should place.
Rusty has consistently looked good.
I hear that Jack Beman won't run.
Jack placed last year and if he does
happen to run today he should show
plenty of Bear runners a neat pair
of heels.
Dave Delameter, John Emanuel,
and Ed Hyde all are in the running.
One, two or all three may figure in
the field scoring.
Last year was the first year that a
Bear team ever conquered Stanford
in cjoss-country. Coach Brutus
Hamilton will be bringing a team
to the Farm today that is favored to
make it number two. The Cal head
liners are Ted Vollmer, last year's
sensational frosh, and Stan Sadaj,
who came close to making the Olym
pic Games team in 1932.

Year's Day between Western
Maryland and Colorado State, the
scoreless wonders of the twentieth
century.
Both teams kept their record un
blemished in games last week-end.
Western Maryland barely squeezed
by, however, losing to Canisius by
a scant 0-0 margin. Besides this,
W.M. flirted with an unsuccessful
outcome to her season when she was
held to a scoreless tie earlier in the
year.
Colorado Slate is doing a little
better. There's no scoreless tie to
blemish its record, and th& Staters
came through with flying colors last
Saturday to lose by a convincing
0-45 score to Utah.
Bob Stevens, also of the Chron
icle, comes through with another
bright one. He suggests that Maine
and Vermont play in some sort of
a bowl to settle the Republican
championship.
DINK'S CROSS-COUNTRY
BOYS MEET CAL TODAY
This afternoon at 3:30 Dink Tem
pleton's distance runners will show
what they have when they match
strides with the cross country run
ners from Cal on the Stanford golf
course. If the sun comes out, the
spectators will flock to the first and
ninth holes.
Last year the Cards put eight
men on the field against the Bears'
28, and still the Indian runners
lost by only one point.
Paul Ganahl looks the best of the
Stanfordites. He's really been burn
ing up the turf in practice runs.
Captain Ed Burrows hasn't been up
to par in practice. Some people
claim that Ed just fools around in
practice and you can't tell what he
will do in a meet, but he denies this.
No matter how Ed looks in practice,
I look for him to be right up in the
money when they come pounding
down the fairway to the finish line.
Rusty March, the redhead who
looks and runs like Norman Bright,
but not quite so fast, should place.
Rusty has consistently looked good.
I hear that Jack Beman won't run.
Jack placed last year and if he does
happen to run today he should show
plenty of Bear runners a neat pair
of heels.
Dave Delameter, John Emanuel,
and Ed Hyde all are in the running.
One, two or all three may figure in
the field scoring.
Last year was the first year that a
Bear team ever conquered Stanford
in cjoss-country. Coach Brutus
Hamilton will be bringing a team
to the Farm today that is favored to
make it number two. The Cal head
liners are Ted Vollmer, last year's
sensational frosh, and Stan Sadaj,
who came close to making the Olym
pic Games team in 1932.
