# Paulman Big Game Destiny Man
## Card Victory Hopes Hinge On Veteran Blocking to Be Essential Factor in Saturday's Battle, Says Thornhill 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
'Stanford's destiny in the Big Game
will lie to a great extent in the hands
of one man—Bill Paulman.
If the quiet blond is at his best and
the team reaches the peak it has
been working up to, grid forecasters
all over the Coast are going to be
fooled. At his best, Paulman is a
better kicker than the highly touted
Sam Chapman and the equal in
passing of Chapman or Vic Bottari.
As for running chances of the Big
Red Machine, there is no ball-carrier
on the Coast more dangerous in the
open field than Peter Fay or Jimmy
Coffis. With Tiny's eight new ground
plays and the intei'ference Card
blockers are capable of, the Indians
will cover plenty of ground against
the strong Bear defense.
Coach Tiny Thornhill realizes that
what he'll need most on Saturday
will be blockers; and he will build
his starting lineup with that thought
in mind. Paulman will hold the full
back spot, and Gene Coldiron will
start at quarter.
Bill Kirsch will be at right half,
and nobody knows whether Fay or
Coffis will begin on the left. Fay is
not a starting half; he is notoriously
game-conscious until the game is
well under way. But Coffis has the
jitters himself now, worrying about
whether he will start. It looks as
though Coffis will get the call, and
Fay will relieve him early in the
game.
Bill Willard and Grant Stone will
start on the flanks. Neil Rasmussen
is still slowed down after a sprained
ankle. Beginning tackles for the
Cards will be Pete Zagar and Stan
| Andersen, with Leo Ferko and prob
j ably Bob Dakan at guards. Tony
j Calvelli will start at center.
Despite the great confidence of all
on the Farm, football authorities still
give Cal the game by a large mar
gin. Stanford coaches yesterday at
tended the Ad Club banquet, which
is held annually before the Big
Game, and they were a bit embar
rassed by the predictions they heard.
Favorite score of coaches, officials,
and newspapermen who attended
was 20-6 for the Bears; they seem to
figure that the Indians are six points
better than last year, when they lost
20-0.
About half a million dollars is
ipent in Columbus, Ohio, each year
by members of 51 fraternities of
Ohio State Univeristy.

Bill Kirsch will be at right half,
and nobody knows whether Fay or
Coffis will begin on the left. Fay is
not a starting half; he is notoriously
game-conscious until the game is
well under way. But Coffis has the
jitters himself now, worrying about
whether he will start. It looks as
though Coffis will get the call, and
Fay will relieve him early in the
game.
Bill Willard and Grant Stone will
start on the flanks. Neil Rasmussen
is still slowed down after a sprained
ankle. Beginning tackles for the
Cards will be Pete Zagar and Stan
| Andersen, with Leo Ferko and prob
j ably Bob Dakan at guards. Tony
j Calvelli will start at center.
Despite the great confidence of all
on the Farm, football authorities still
give Cal the game by a large mar
gin. Stanford coaches yesterday at
tended the Ad Club banquet, which
is held annually before the Big
Game, and they were a bit embar
rassed by the predictions they heard.
Favorite score of coaches, officials,
and newspapermen who attended
was 20-6 for the Bears; they seem to
figure that the Indians are six points
better than last year, when they lost
20-0.
About half a million dollars is
ipent in Columbus, Ohio, each year
by members of 51 fraternities of
Ohio State Univeristy.
'Stanford's destiny in the Big Game
will lie to a great extent in the hands
of one man—Bill Paulman.
If the quiet blond is at his best and
the team reaches the peak it has
been working up to, grid forecasters
all over the Coast are going to be
fooled. At his best, Paulman is a
better kicker than the highly touted
Sam Chapman and the equal in
passing of Chapman or Vic Bottari.
As for running chances of the Big
Red Machine, there is no ball-carrier
on the Coast more dangerous in the
open field than Peter Fay or Jimmy
Coffis. With Tiny's eight new ground
plays and the intei'ference Card
blockers are capable of, the Indians
will cover plenty of ground against
the strong Bear defense.
Coach Tiny Thornhill realizes that
what he'll need most on Saturday
will be blockers; and he will build
his starting lineup with that thought
in mind. Paulman will hold the full
back spot, and Gene Coldiron will
start at quarter.
