## Cardinal, Bear Marathoners Race Today Annual Golf Course Run Set for 3:30; Indians Out to Avenge Defeat 
### 
Indian and Bear cross country
men meet this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock on the Stanford golf course
for their annual pre-Big Game race.
The start will be at the first fairway
and the run will follow the general
plan of the golf course, finishing
near the clubhouse. Best place for
spectators to view the race is at
the ninth green.
Last year the Cal men took the
match by one point for their first
victory since the inauguration of the
series, but this season Card hopes
are high for starting a new winning
streak.
Mainstays of the Farm team are
Pete Ganahl, John Emanuel, Cap
tain Ed Burrows, and Rusty March.
Ganahl has been turning in win
ning performances lately and March
heads the list. Burrows was out last
year with an injured foot, but is in
fine shape this season.
Coach Brutus Hamilton's Bears
will feature Ted Vollmer and Stan
Sadaj. Sadaj is an experienced man
in the distances, having tried for
the United States Olympic team : n
1932. Vollmer was the marvel of
last year's frosh team and holds the
Cal-Stanford freshman two - mile
record. The Bear line-up will also
probably include Bob Baker and
Clarence Hall, ace distance men.
