# Booters Meet Cal Saturday
## League Chances Depend On Game with Bears 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer squad,
still smarting from the setback which
it suffered Saturday at the hands of
those California Bears, began to put
the final touches on its kicking and
passing yesterday, anxiously point
ing to another crack at the Blue and
Gold, Saturday morning at Stanford
before the Big Game.
In the absence of Coach Harry
Maloney, who departed lor the East
at the beginning of the week to at
tend a convention, Captain Dave
Sloane has been helping whip the
soccermen into shape for their re
turn match with their rivals from
Berkeley. It will be the last meeting
of the two elevens this season,
which means that the Indians are
going to work to keep the Bears
from making a clean sweep of the
1937 series.
A victory for California will also
just about clinch the Intercollegiate
Conference title for them, adding to
the importance of Saturday's game
for the Indians, who by winning
would remain in the running for
the championship.
