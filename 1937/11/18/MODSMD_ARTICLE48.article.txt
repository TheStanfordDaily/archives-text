# Cards Tit Try Swamping Col Waterpoloists
## 
### 
Stanford will try to salvage some
of its water polo prestige in its two
game series with California's ex-
Wonder Water Team this week-end.
The first game will be played in
Encina Pools Friday at 3 o'clock and
the second is scheduled for Berke
ley next Tuesday.
Frosh Favored
The Indian Papooses will play the
Bear Cubs in a preliminary Friday.
By virtue of their showing in their
last three games, the Card yearlings
should defeat the Cal frosh. The
Stanford va'rsity, however, must be
rated as underdogs.
The Indians' loss of several over
time and closely contested games 1
rank them below a Bear team that
has bowed only to U.C.L.A., with
whom they are now tied for the
conference lead. Stanford's total of
only one conference victory this
year is probably the most disastrous
record the squad has had in 25 years
of competition. Previously Indian
water teams had won 22 out of 24
championships.
Cal Locked Out
California has never won a Coast
championship. They defeated Stan
ford last year in one game but the
Cards came back in their second
meeting to defeat the Bears and
cinch the championship.
At any rate, the Bears would have
to win two games a year for 33
j years from the Indians if they ever
expected to equal the Stanford vic
tory string. Stanford has won 70 to
! the Bears' 4. The Bears went hun
gry for 22 years before they finally
! won one in 1934.
