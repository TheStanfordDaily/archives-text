## California Gets the Medal 
### 
YESTERDAY morning the University of Cali
fornia awoke to find its traditional "C" em
blazoned as a crimson initial against the hillside
—flaming reminder that Stanford freshmen had
paid a visit during the night, daubed quickly
with red, and slipped back across the bay.
But despite several local false alarms, by the
time this slug dropped out of the linotype last
night California had made no retaliation, and
editor oi the Daily Californian Bill Murrish an
swered our phone call in that regard with a
prophesy that there would be none. California,
it seems, has its feet on the ground.
Big Game fever is all right if it doesn't turn
into a disease that takes life or injures property.
If California keeps its feet, it will be gratifying
to know that the boys at Berkeley, whether it
be due to lack of interest or to distinct common
sense, recognize this point.
It is to be hoped that between the hour at
which this is written and two o'clock Saturday
there is no move by California which would
change the aspect of the picture.
The action of Stanford's freshmen in painting
the Big "C"is not to be commended—but can
not, under the circumstances, be entirely con

demned. Let it not be interpreted, however, that
The Daily recommends such action.
The circumstances were these. No official
order was issued forbidding freshmen to make
the trip. They were, however, warned against
committing crimes of violence. The disgraceful
incident of last year—when a California guard
was seriously injured—should never be re
peated.
The Class of '41, working partially under the
assumption that there is basis for the statement
that a freshman class is no good unless it paints
the "C," set out to establish its mettle after the
rumor spread that Cal had invaded the bonfire.
They were not forbidden to go by any official
source. They were warned against damage to
life or property. And that warning was obeyed
to the letter.
It must be said again that this is not intended
as a justification of raiding California. But fresh
men cannot be condemned for following their
predecessors.
To California, however, goes the leather
medal.
So far the ancient rival from across the bay
deserves all credit for not making the Farm's
dilemmic situation more difficult.
