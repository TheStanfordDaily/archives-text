# Bonfire in the Rut

### 
THIS editorial may be as gooey as the bed
of Lagunita is this morning.
It's going to gripe about the asserted lack of
progress on the bonfire, and tell of the prediction
by Yell Leader Jim Ransohoff that this year's
fire is going to be the worst in years.
It's going to repeat the wail that rain has
held up bonfire work, though there is more
material this year than before, and the plea for
the entire frosh class to come to the lake bed
this morning and make up for lost time.
It's going to quote the Sideline Slants that
former sports editor Phil Klauber wrote a year
ago. Phil told of the thrill of getting close to
the ground, the chance, that comes but once a
year, to do a little profitable, sweaty, physical
labor, the satisfaction of watching the pyre
grow. It's going to repeat a quote in which
Tiny Thornhill said: .
"All the Pavilion rallies in a year don't stack
up to one good bonfire in unifying the players,
students, and alumni."
In this editorial will be a plea that this be
made one of the standout bonfires, that Ranso
hoff's prediction be refuted.
That's what it is going to say.—L. L.
