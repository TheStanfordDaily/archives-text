# BULL SESSION
## AUX ARMES 
### 
night freshman sentries patrolled the bon
fire sector and Stanford shock troops slept under
arms, prepared to wipe out any Cal invaders bent on
premature arson. The enemy, of course, did not attack.
The weather that night was hardly adapted to the
surreptitious setting off of bonfires. In fact, it was
hardly adapted to anything except the return of wan
dering boys and the eviction of erring daughters. And
whatever our estimate of Cal intelligence may be, we
will have to give the boys credit for enough sense to
stay between the blankets during a monsoon.
It would have taken a qualified pyromaniac and a
troop of boy scouts to set that fire off Tuesday night.
As it is, the committee is developing a haggard look
trying to figure out how they are going to get it lit
tonight. But we got a grand thrill out of protecting
the fire. We had two beautiful false alarms. And we
recaptured the sweet jittery feeling we used to get
when we thought somebody was following us on a
dark street.

It was all great fun, which explains why we did it.
Nobody was worried about the danger to the bonfire.
But everybody got a kick out of standing by to man
the guns. It was part of the Big Game enthusiasm.
When the first alarm went out at 9:30, freshmen
got the same thrill that we found in "Beau Geste"
when a surprise attack turned out the garrison. Spir
itedly the frosh double timed down the stairs. Like
guns from a rack, the railing pickets were snatched
out, and to hell with the sponsors. And then there
was the glorious charge across the campus in battle
formation, following the best "What Price Glory" tra
dition. Upperclassmen joined in gleefully, recapturing
the thrill of vanished youth.

|T'S not surprising that we got a kick out of it. The
stampede combined all the best features of a fox
hunt and a musical comedy.
The second alarm was just as much fun, though
not quite as convenient. When the fire whistle blew
boots and saddles at 12:30, we knew how our sturdy
ancestors felt when the redskins dropped in without
bothering to phone first.
In between the alarms we knew again that delec
table apprehension we used to feel when we got to
imagining there was a dragon under the dining room
table. We had a comfortable sort of adventure, know
ing that there really weren't any Cal invaders just as
we knew there wasn't any dragon.

In fact, if there had been a Cal detachment en
gaged in its employment, we would have been in a
lather unpleasant position. A long line of cases indi
cates that manhandling, mauling, or otherwise se
riously damaging a captive is definitely bad taste. For
one left jab you may spend six months sawing that
walnut stump at the convalescent home. Similarly,
the law frowns on lynching.
Of course, we can always shave our victims. But
that is a messy job, and you have to be careful not
to scalp them. And then too, shaving requires a
preparation and malice aforethought that takes half
the fun away. How many freshmen carried hot water,
soap, and razors when they sprang to arms last night?
If only the Cal boys will have the courtesy to stay
away today, we can look back on an unspoiled week of
make-believe warfare better than any cops and rob
