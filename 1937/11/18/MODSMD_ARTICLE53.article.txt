Card stunts to Charles Rosenthal of the Califor
nia column in the Daily Californian are a graphic
and effective form of advertising. But he finds
them economically unproductive and so suggests a
remedy.
r pHE office of the art staff of The Californian func
tioned at a sizzling speed every day last week, as
a corps of some four men outlined the cards stunts for
the Big Game.
The men were from the Torch society, and the art
staff of The Californian. They worked assiduously
with charts of the Stanford stadium, and colored pen
cils.
For hours and hours there were preliminary sketch
es passed from hand to hand. These sketches were
Bears, Allisons, Thornhills, Indians, axes, etc. As they
came, hot from the pencil of Art Editor. Karl' Kasten,
they were passed around and everybody gave his
opinion . Then they were thrown away, and new ones
substituted.
Finally, a set of pictures was deemed proper and
sufficient. After long consultations with various offi
icals, these drawings were transferred to large sheets,
which are exact charts of the rooting section at Stan
ford. As they took final shape, pictures developed into
Bears, Indians, Thornhills, Allisons, and axes.
While all this was going on, the thousands of people
who daily pass through the office, were passing
through.
But nobody took any cognizance of what was going
on.
* # # *
Yet any man or woman who looked, would have
noticed the significance of those meetings.
They meant that ten thousand students or so are
going to be stooges, as usual.
Ten thousand students are going to spend almost
15 minutes apiece, holding colored cards under their
noses.
The cards are uncomfortable to hold. They mean
nothing to the people holding them. They obstruct the
rooters' view of the opposite rooting section, which also
holds cards.
In fact, as far as the inmates of this great temple
of learning are concerned, they are nothing more nor
less than a terrific bother.
And they are abominably mismanaged.
If card stunts are tributes to Stub, or somebody,
why don't they save the stunts until Stub gets onto
the field, instead of when he is in the dressing room
giving aid and encouragement?
If the stunts are for the benefit of the students,
why don t they give the cards to the alumni, and let
the students see them?
If they are for the benefit of the A.S.U.C., why
don't we get some real advertising out of them?
What the Californian would like to see instead of an
Indian or an axe, is a great big stunt:
BUY US A
DORMITORY
or something like that. Maybe it could be a little plug:
WE ARE GOING
and then a quick change:
TO MOVE
and another change:
senior bench.
After which there could be a moment's silence, while
the crowd recovered from its surprise.

which are exact charts of the rooting section at Stan
ford. As they took final shape, pictures developed into
Bears, Indians, Thornhills, Allisons, and axes.
While all this was going on, the thousands of people
who daily pass through the office, were passing
through.
But nobody took any cognizance of what was going
on.

Yet any man or woman who looked, would have
noticed the significance of those meetings.
They meant that ten thousand students or so are
going to be stooges, as usual.
Ten thousand students are going to spend almost
15 minutes apiece, holding colored cards under their
noses.
The cards are uncomfortable to hold. They mean
nothing to the people holding them. They obstruct the
rooters' view of the opposite rooting section, which also
holds cards.
In fact, as far as the inmates of this great temple
of learning are concerned, they are nothing more nor
less than a terrific bother.
And they are abominably mismanaged.
If card stunts are tributes to Stub, or somebody,
why don't they save the stunts until Stub gets onto
the field, instead of when he is in the dressing room
giving aid and encouragement?
If the stunts are for the benefit of the students,
why don t they give the cards to the alumni, and let
the students see them?
If they are for the benefit of the A.S.U.C., why
don't we get some real advertising out of them?
What the Californian would like to see instead of an
Indian or an axe, is a great big stunt:
BUY US A
DORMITORY
or something like that. Maybe it could be a little plug:
WE ARE GOING
and then a quick change:
TO MOVE
and another change:
senior bench.
After which there could be a moment's silence, while
the crowd recovered from its surprise.
Card stunts to Charles Rosenthal of the Califor
nia column in the Daily Californian are a graphic
and effective form of advertising. But he finds
them economically unproductive and so suggests a
remedy.
r pHE office of the art staff of The Californian func
tioned at a sizzling speed every day last week, as
a corps of some four men outlined the cards stunts for
the Big Game.
The men were from the Torch society, and the art
staff of The Californian. They worked assiduously
with charts of the Stanford stadium, and colored pen
cils.
For hours and hours there were preliminary sketch
es passed from hand to hand. These sketches were
Bears, Allisons, Thornhills, Indians, axes, etc. As they
came, hot from the pencil of Art Editor. Karl' Kasten,
they were passed around and everybody gave his
opinion . Then they were thrown away, and new ones
substituted.
Finally, a set of pictures was deemed proper and
sufficient. After long consultations with various offi
icals, these drawings were transferred to large sheets,
which are exact charts of the rooting section at Stan
ford. As they took final shape, pictures developed into
Bears, Indians, Thornhills, Allisons, and axes.
While all this was going on, the thousands of people
