# Cagney Fails When Latest Flicker Flops
## 
### 
"Something to Sing About" (May
field Theater): A title, which for
overstatement, puts P. T. Barnum in
a class with Coolidge. In fact, it is
well nigh impossible to chase out
from the whole picture a single vir
tue worth wrapping around the
critical fork.
Terry Rooney (James Cagney)
bags a Hollywood contract, and his
first picture proves such a success
that Terry is promptly mobbed in
front of a lot of phoney prop the
aters, hastily shot up for purposes
of Terry's success by Republic Pic-

tures, producers
of "Something to
Sing About."
Mean while,
while Republic
Pictures is scrap
ing up enough
kale to finance an
other set, Terry's
name is linked in
romance with a
Hollywood act
ress. This is un-

fortunate because Terry is already
married to a girl named Rita, who,
I think, can best be described as a
very athletic soprano. Everything
ends up nicely, however, just in
time to see Republic Pictures filing
their monthly bankruptcy and add
ing up the deficits.
No matter how many critical pop
bottles are hurled from the gallery,
these folding picture corporation
umpires refuse to call "strike-out."
It does not seem worthwhile even
to try to rout this pest from the
Hollywood crop. But when James
Cagney shows an alarming tendency
to sing, as he does in this picture, it
is time to send him back to his
home studio and put him promptly
in some beefsteak melodrama, which,
if only medium well done, will car
ry him better than "Something to
Sing About."
