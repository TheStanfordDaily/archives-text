Dear Mr. Hansom:
Men's Council desires to requote
for you and others who are inter
ested in the explanation of Stan
ford's Fundamental Standard, as
reproduced in the Frosh Bible for
1936-37, page 42:
"All cases of conduct unbecoming
a Stanford student are subject to the
discipline of the proper council.
Students are expected to show both
within and without the University
such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens.
"A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities
in prohibition of . . . the formation
or growth of any organization, cus
tom, or social function, that tends to
the development of exclusive or un
democratic castes within the insti
tution and to exclude from the in
stitution anyone whose conduct is
inconsistent with the spirit expressed
by the founders."
It has been the poiicy of Men's
Council throughout its history to
view cases of ticket "scalping" —
which deprive other students of their
fundamental right of equality in se
curing admittance to student-attend
ed functions — as cases of dishon
orable and undemocratic conduct
upon the part of the depriver. In
keeping with explanation of the
Fundamental Standard as described
above, it has also been the policy of
Men's Council to exclude from the
University such students who lack
this true Stanford spirit.
It has been more than mere pol
icy, however. In the past there have
been actual cases and Councils
have expelled students for scalping.
Never having had a case under
its jurisdiction which concerned
other than rooters' ticket scalping
before, Men's Council did not ex
pel the certain student convicted of
ticket scalping this week because it
felt that an expulsion would thus

be unfair to the certain student.
Therefore it decreed a penalty con
sidered lenient as far as the certain
student is concerned, striking as far
as the student body is concerned.
Although it is its policy to refrain
from undue publicity to the disad
vantage of "certain students," Men's
Council went to the Daily in this
case with the following purposes in
mind:
1. To remind students, who may
have forgotten to what the Funda
mental Standard applies, what the
penalties for undemocratic conduct
at Stanford are.
2. To explain to them that in the
future Men's Council will recognize
no difference between scalping root
ers' tickets and scalping tickets tc
the Gaieties or other student-attend
ed affairs.
3. To offer an opportunity for
those students who are suffering
from the effects of the present case
to use the present decision and
warning through the columns of the
Daily as a weapon with which to
combat would-be scalpers.
We hope that this has cleared
matters in your mind, Mr. Ransom,
and appreciate your interest in the
case. Should you have further
questions, any member of the
Council would be glad to talk with
you personally.
Sincerely,
Men's Council for

To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities
in prohibition of . . . the formation
or growth of any organization, cus
tom, or social function, that tends to
the development of exclusive or un
democratic castes within the insti
tution and to exclude from the in
stitution anyone whose conduct is
inconsistent with the spirit expressed
by the founders."
It has been the poiicy of Men's
Council throughout its history to
view cases of ticket "scalping" —
which deprive other students of their
fundamental right of equality in se
curing admittance to student-attend
ed functions — as cases of dishon
orable and undemocratic conduct
upon the part of the depriver. In
keeping with explanation of the
Fundamental Standard as described
above, it has also been the policy of
Men's Council to exclude from the
University such students who lack
this true Stanford spirit.
It has been more than mere pol
icy, however. In the past there have
been actual cases and Councils
have expelled students for scalping.
Never having had a case under
its jurisdiction which concerned
other than rooters' ticket scalping
before, Men's Council did not ex
pel the certain student convicted of
ticket scalping this week because it
felt that an expulsion would thus

be unfair to the certain student.
Therefore it decreed a penalty con
sidered lenient as far as the certain
student is concerned, striking as far
as the student body is concerned.
Although it is its policy to refrain
from undue publicity to the disad
vantage of "certain students," Men's
Council went to the Daily in this
case with the following purposes in
mind:
1. To remind students, who may
have forgotten to what the Funda
mental Standard applies, what the
penalties for undemocratic conduct
at Stanford are.
2. To explain to them that in the
future Men's Council will recognize
no difference between scalping root
ers' tickets and scalping tickets tc
the Gaieties or other student-attend
ed affairs.
3. To offer an opportunity for
those students who are suffering
from the effects of the present case
to use the present decision and
warning through the columns of the
Daily as a weapon with which to
combat would-be scalpers.
We hope that this has cleared
matters in your mind, Mr. Ransom,
and appreciate your interest in the
case. Should you have further
questions, any member of the
Council would be glad to talk with
you personally.
Sincerely,
Men's Council for
Student Control
Dear Mr. Hansom:
Men's Council desires to requote
for you and others who are inter
ested in the explanation of Stan
ford's Fundamental Standard, as
reproduced in the Frosh Bible for
1936-37, page 42:
"All cases of conduct unbecoming
a Stanford student are subject to the
discipline of the proper council.
Students are expected to show both
within and without the University
such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citi
zens.
"A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University.
