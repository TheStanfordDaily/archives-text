# 'Certain Raiders' Visit Cal Campus
## Certain Co-eds Certainly Take Prize For Certain Sign-Painting 
### 
It certainly was a big night for raiding parties Wednesday.
Results included kidnaping, arresf.s, Big C's on the Stanford campus
and S's 011 the Cal campus.
"Two certain co-eds," who insist they were attending a show, are
credited with painting a nine-foot-high red S on a Cal walk between the

Campanile and old Bacon Hall. 4
"Five certain freshmen" were
chased through the Cal campus and
Berkeley by two patrol cars and
finally arrested.
A certain other group succeeded
in burning an S in the lawn near a
western gate at Berkeley campus.
Two certain Stanfordites, Fred
Phipers and Dick Halpern, were
kidnaped from in front of the Li
brary, hauled away to Berkeley,
painted blue and gold, and finally
allowed to hitch-hike back to the
Farm.
Ilalpcrn Nabbed
Halpern was asked to direct six
men to the A.T.O. house. When he
walked up to their car, he was
hustled in. According to Jane Gib
sun, writign in The Daily Califor
nian, the men were taken into the
Californian's printing shop about
midnight, Phipers was handcuffed
but enjoying the proceedings. Hal
pern, with an organic chemistry
book under his arm, was worried
about his job here.
Miss Gibson said the kidnapers
declared they were 'acting on direct 1
orders of the California Rally Com- j
inittee, which wanted the kidnap
ees, dressed in Indian costumes, to
parade at their Big Game rally.
Before they were released their
faces and hair were painted blue and I
gold.
Officer Searches
Meanwhile, Campus Officer Ralph
Hillery halted a car cruising slowly
around the Berkeley campus. He
searched the car, which, in addition
to the "certain co-eds," contained a
can of red paint and two suspi
ciously wet brushes. He backtrack
ed, found the S. lectured the girls, J
released them, then did his best to
erase the letter.
The five men halted by the police
said they fled, with the officers hot !
in pursuit, because they thought Cal
students were after them. The "cops
at Cal cheat," they claimed, because j
they had no identification lights on
their cars.
Plot Thickened
The men had balloons and paint
in the car. They had planned for a
week how they were going to fill
the balloons with paint and catapult j
them high on the Campanile where
the marks couldn't be erased. On j
Tuesday they had gone on a "scout
ing" expedition and had all but
fnarked X's where they planned to
stand.
They said they saw no Cal men
anywhere and despite the blowing
of a siren by the officers no one j
popped out into the 4 a.m. euld to
see them. The driver was cited for
speeding at (>0 miles an hour, fail
ure to stop at boulevards, driving on |
the wrong side of the street, no
driver's license (the quintet had
thoughtfully divested itself of iden
tification marks) and violation of
various Berkeley traffic ordinances.
Statue Swiped
Also meanwhile, the certain other
group moved in on the campus,
burned an S, with a "whoosh" of
oil, on the lawn; advanced into a
fraternity and captured a golden
bear statue, turned on lights to hunt
for curtains taken from Sequoia
eight years ago, and walked out
without ever seeing a Cal man.
California's efforts on the Farm
were limited to burning a C before
Encina Hall, one in front of the
Administration Building, and an
other in front of the library. A "C"
also was painted in front of the Ad
ministration Building.

California's efforts on the Farm
were limited to burning a C before

Californian's printing shop about
midnight, Phipers was handcuffed
