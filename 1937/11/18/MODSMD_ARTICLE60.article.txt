It certainly was a big night for raiding parties Wednesday.
Results included kidnaping, arresf.s, Big C's on the Stanford campus
and S's 011 the Cal campus.
"Two certain co-eds," who insist they were attending a show, are
credited with painting a nine-foot-high red S on a Cal walk between the

Campanile and old Bacon Hall. 4
"Five certain freshmen" were
chased through the Cal campus and
Berkeley by two patrol cars and
finally arrested.
A certain other group succeeded
in burning an S in the lawn near a
western gate at Berkeley campus.
Two certain Stanfordites, Fred
Phipers and Dick Halpern, were
kidnaped from in front of the Li
brary, hauled away to Berkeley,
painted blue and gold, and finally
allowed to hitch-hike back to the
Farm.

hustled in. According to Jane Gib

Californian's printing shop about
midnight, Phipers was handcuffed
