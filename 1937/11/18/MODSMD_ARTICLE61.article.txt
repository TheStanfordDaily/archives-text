## 
### 
Wire reports from Hollywood
that Dink Templeton's "ex
pensive automobile" had been
stolen were denied last night
by Mrs. Templeton when a
Daily reporter called up for
additional information.
"Dink hasn't been in Los
Angeles since last summer,"
she declared, thus spiking the
possibility that the Stanford
track coach might have to run
back to Palo Alto for the Big
Game.
The other Templeton with the
same name, plus the addition of
a fancy car, is an employe of a
movieland studio. The car was
used in the $20,000 loot of a
film executive's mansion. Cor
respondents who saw the name
of the car's owner were quick
to attribute its ownership to
Templeton. They even ran a
picture of the Boy Coach for
emphasis.
