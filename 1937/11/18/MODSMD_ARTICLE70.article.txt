# Rally Funeral Pyre Sets Stage for Bear Scalping
## Parading Floats and Torches Crowd Row in Parade 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
The House of Cards staged a little warm-up party
last night. It luirned Cal's coffin right down around
the Bear's cars, then patted the ailing Bruin on both
cheeks with a theoretical spade.
Down the Row went a parade of happy mourners—
Sigma Chi's and their original Axe handle—the Fiji
farm boys on a hay wagon, punning with a sign, "We
hear there's a feud a-Bruin"'—Toyon and DceGee
with their two steam rollers, the Big Red Machine and

the Little Red Kiddie Kar—bonneted'
Robleites in their Baby Buggy, cry
ing "We Want a Bearskin"—R.O.T.C.
Indians on horseback.
Understatement department: Chi
Psi's duplicating "Ti ip Troy" and
"Wax Washington" with "Harm
Honolulu."
Happier mourners jammed the Pa
vilion, made the floor tremble with
their stomping feet, sent the Axe
Yell echoing from the rafters as Yell
Leaders Jimmy Ransohoff, Bill Todd,
and Lomax Turner trucked to the
Band's "Tiger Rag."
Big Chief Tiny hooked one leg
over the railing, grinned as the
crowd cheered when he told them,
"The kids have made their own
breaks this year and cashed in on
them. 1 don't know who's going to
win this game but it'll have to be a
damned good team."
Clark Talks
Sentiment tempered enthusiasm
( with the introduction of Jack Clark,
the man who might have been a
Varsity star again this year but for a
pre-season injury. Clark pulled a
rabbit's foot from his pocket, passed
it to Thornhill and Assistant Coach
Bobby Grayson before they spoke.
Hollywood funny-man "Doodles"
Weaver, invited to lead the rally,
sent regrets via telegram, "Tell the
team I'll meet them in the Rose
Bowl." Former All-American Bill
Corbus delivered his message in
j person, said to the team, "You can
win."
The Stanford Indian (Herb Woo
ley) took the Cal Bear (Emerson
Hiler) into his tepee, pounded him
thoroughly, then rode off astride
his back. Sequoia roughs marched
in with their, coffin and the crowd
took up the dirge, "Poor Cal."
They kspt it up all the way to
Lagunita, installed the mythical Bear
in funereal state atop his 45-foot
pyre. Men»with flickering torches
ran out across the lake bed, small
flames caught at one side, grew
higher and higher until the bonfire
became a mass of fire.
Long fingers of flame leaped high
over the pyre, sent a funnel of
sparks trailing off into the sky, shed
a red glow over the faces of spec
tators massed on the lake bed.
Men and women ran close to the
fire, fell back from the heat of the
blaze, and followed the Band in a
serpentine march. Ransohoff climbed

on a vater-marking tower, led the
hundreds of students present in a
series of yells.
Flames died down, then licked up
the sides of telephone poles which
had formed the foundation of the
bonfire, standing like stark figures
against the sky. Spectators turned
away, started up the banks of the
lake bed.
And the ghost of the California
bear hovered over the dying bon
fire.
THREE STUDENTS
REPORTED INJURED
Only reported casualty of last
night's parade and rally occurred
when a fire hose turned upon Ann
Cornwell, Theta, caused her to shy
away and knocked a lighted torch
upon her head. She received only
minor burns, and Janet Nelson, hit
by the same torch, was uninjured.
Estelle Seid, and another unidenti
fied student, also received minor
injuries when firecrackers were
thrown toward them.

Weaver, invited to lead the rally,

Bowl." Former All-American Bill
Corbus delivered his message in

The Stanford Indian (Herb Woo
ley) took the Cal Bear (Emerson
Hiler) into his tepee, pounded him
thoroughly, then rode off astride
his back. Sequoia roughs marched
in with their, coffin and the crowd
took up the dirge, "Poor Cal."
They kspt it up all the way to
Lagunita, installed the mythical Bear
in funereal state atop his 45-foot
pyre. Men»with flickering torches
ran out across the lake bed, small
flames caught at one side, grew
higher and higher until the bonfire
became a mass of fire.
Long fingers of flame leaped high
over the pyre, sent a funnel of
sparks trailing off into the sky, shed
a red glow over the faces of spec
tators massed on the lake bed.
Men and women ran close to the
fire, fell back from the heat of the
blaze, and followed the Band in a
serpentine march. Ransohoff climbed

on a vater-marking tower, led the
hundreds of students present in a
series of yells.
Flames died down, then licked up
the sides of telephone poles which
had formed the foundation of the
bonfire, standing like stark figures
against the sky. Spectators turned
away, started up the banks of the
lake bed.
And the ghost of the California
bear hovered over the dying bon
fire.

Only reported casualty of last
night's parade and rally occurred
when a fire hose turned upon Ann
Cornwell, Theta, caused her to shy
away and knocked a lighted torch
upon her head. She received only
minor burns, and Janet Nelson, hit
by the same torch, was uninjured.
Estelle Seid, and another unidenti

injuries when firecrackers were
thrown toward them.
The House of Cards staged a little warm-up party
last night. It luirned Cal's coffin right down around
the Bear's cars, then patted the ailing Bruin on both
cheeks with a theoretical spade.
Down the Row went a parade of happy mourners—
Sigma Chi's and their original Axe handle—the Fiji
farm boys on a hay wagon, punning with a sign, "We
hear there's a feud a-Bruin"'—Toyon and DceGee
with their two steam rollers, the Big Red Machine and

the Little Red Kiddie Kar—bonneted'
Robleites in their Baby Buggy, cry
ing "We Want a Bearskin"—R.O.T.C.
Indians on horseback.
Understatement department: Chi
Psi's duplicating "Ti ip Troy" and
"Wax Washington" with "Harm

Happier mourners jammed the Pa
vilion, made the floor tremble with
their stomping feet, sent the Axe
Yell echoing from the rafters as Yell
Leaders Jimmy Ransohoff, Bill Todd,
and Lomax Turner trucked to the
Band's "Tiger Rag."
Big Chief Tiny hooked one leg
over the railing, grinned as the
crowd cheered when he told them,
"The kids have made their own
breaks this year and cashed in on
them. 1 don't know who's going to
win this game but it'll have to be a
damned good team."
