# Rally Funeral Pyre Sets Stage for Bear Scalping
## Parading Floats and Torches Crowd Row in Parade 
### JEAN TOFFEE 
The House of Cards staged a little warm-up party
last night. It luirned Cal's coffin right down around
the Bear's cars, then patted the ailing Bruin on both
cheeks with a theoretical spade.
Down the Row went a parade of happy mourners—
Sigma Chi's and their original Axe handle—the Fiji
farm boys on a hay wagon, punning with a sign, "We
hear there's a feud a-Bruin"'—Toyon and DceGee
with their two steam rollers, the Big Red Machine and

the Little Red Kiddie Kar—bonneted'
Robleites in their Baby Buggy, cry
ing "We Want a Bearskin"—R.O.T.C.
Indians on horseback.
Understatement department: Chi
Psi's duplicating "Ti ip Troy" and
"Wax Washington" with "Harm
Honolulu."
Happier mourners jammed the Pa
vilion, made the floor tremble with
their stomping feet, sent the Axe
Yell echoing from the rafters as Yell
Leaders Jimmy Ransohoff, Bill Todd,
and Lomax Turner trucked to the
Band's "Tiger Rag."
Big Chief Tiny hooked one leg
over the railing, grinned as the
crowd cheered when he told them,
"The kids have made their own
breaks this year and cashed in on
them. 1 don't know who's going to
win this game but it'll have to be a
damned good team."
Clark Talks
Sentiment tempered enthusiasm
( with the introduction of Jack Clark,
the man who might have been a
Varsity star again this year but for a
pre-season injury. Clark pulled a
rabbit's foot from his pocket, passed
it to Thornhill and Assistant Coach
Bobby Grayson before they spoke.
Hollywood funny-man "Doodles"
Weaver, invited to lead the rally,
sent regrets via telegram, "Tell the
team I'll meet them in the Rose
Bowl." Former All-American Bill
Corbus delivered his message in
j person, said to the team, "You can
win."
