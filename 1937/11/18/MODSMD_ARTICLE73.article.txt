# 1800 Employees Work at Stadium
## 
### 
All Jake Irwin, B.A.C. manager
of operations, has to dn tomorrow is
worry about keeping 1800 stadium
and parking employees busy and
pray to the gods that it won't rain
any more.
One more shower will bog down
campus parking areas so much that
it will be impossible to use space
that would hold 9000 cars more on
a dry day.
The squad of workers does every
thing from pushing wheel-chairs to
running the scoreboards in the end
zones. Greatest .â€¢-ingle number of
men are assigned to ushering jobs,
with 700 in that capacity. Three hun
dred more work on traffic. Program
sellers, concessions, and ticket takers
arc al&o on the roller.
