### GENE GEAR 
Can the Rilz Brothers of football pull enough cra/,\
antics to stop the leading' men and screen heroes ol
coast football in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon?
The answer to this question will be unfolded ;«( !
o'clock when the Stanford Indians, impersonating the
Ritz Brothers, put on a little skit with the leading men
played by the California Bears.
This touching little drama will be called "The Kir
Game," or "May 1 Have the Next Dance, Miss Rosii

•Bowl?"
Big Chief Tiny Thornhill, with ,
shrug and a hearty laugh at tl
2'_>-l odds against the Indians, got
right on rehearsing his cast for the
biggest drama of the current season.
Tiny's been working on a defense
and a new offense designed to stop
and baffle the Bears just as effec
tively as Washington did several
weeks ago.
Starting Line-up
It's a lot of fun these days to spec
ulate as to just what Stanford .
starting line-up against the Bear
will be. Even the headman himself
does not know. At fullback it's
either Bill Paulman 01* Jim Groves.
At left half it's Pete Fay viein.q
with little Jimmy Coflis for the
starting call. At right half it's close
between Freddie Ledeboer and Bill
Kirsch. At quarterback there's .1
real question mark. One of five mc
may get the call here: Gene Cold
iron, A1 Alustiza. Ed Gamier, Paul
man, or Groves.
As good a guess as the next one
would put the following Stanford
hack fie Id on the field to answer the
starting whistle: Paulman at full,
Coffis, left half; Kirsch, right half;
;ind Coldiron, quarter.
Cal's four horsemen will un
doubtedly be composed of the old
first string stand-bys, Johnny Meek,
Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman, and
Dave Anderson.
In the line, the prognosticating
job is a little easier. The starting
tackles and guards are pretty well
set. The old stand-bys, Pete Zagar
and Stan Anderson, will probably
start at tackles with Bob Dakan and
Leo Ferko getting the call at the
two guard positions for the Indians.
Stone To Start
Captain Grant Stone will start at
light end, but the left Cardinal
flankman is still unnamed. Neil Ras
mussen, Bill Willard, and Irv Cum
in ings are being juggled around at

this .spot.
It's that season-old question at
center . . . Tony Calvelli or Louis
Tsoutsouvar.
There's all the difference in the
world between the Cal first and sec
ond string lines. The Bear line that
will undoubtedly start the game, if
nothing unforeseen happens, will be
composed of Schwartz and Dolman
at ends, De Varena and Stall at
tackles, Stockton and Evans at
guards, and All-American Bob
Herwig at center.
Yesterday both teams ran through
light practice drills. The coaches
are taking no chances on injuries at
this late date. Tonight Tiny will take
his Indians to a retreat in the Los
Gatos hills, where they rest in peace
and quiet before coming back to the
Farm tomorrow before game time.
Bears Favored
Stub Allison's Golden Bears leave
this morning for their Old Home
stead to rest for the battle. The
Bears' secluded spot is in the hills
just 20 minutes' ride from the scene
of tomorrow's rlassic.
Despite Cal's amazing past record
and Stanford's up and down season
record, the Big Game tomorrow in
the Stanford Stadium is going to be
a battle from start to finish,
California has the best team and
is favored to win, but watch your
step, Bears; a fighting team with
lots on the ball and a couple of
good breaks can beat the best team
in the country.

•Bowl?"
Big Chief Tiny Thornhill, with ,
shrug and a hearty laugh at tl
2'_>-l odds against the Indians, got
right on rehearsing his cast for the
biggest drama of the current season.
Tiny's been working on a defense
and a new offense designed to stop
and baffle the Bears just as effec
tively as Washington did several
weeks ago.
Starting Line-up
It's a lot of fun these days to spec
ulate as to just what Stanford .
starting line-up against the Bear
will be. Even the headman himself
does not know. At fullback it's
either Bill Paulman 01* Jim Groves.
At left half it's Pete Fay viein.q
with little Jimmy Coflis for the
starting call. At right half it's close
between Freddie Ledeboer and Bill
Kirsch. At quarterback there's .1
real question mark. One of five mc
may get the call here: Gene Cold
iron, A1 Alustiza. Ed Gamier, Paul
man, or Groves.
As good a guess as the next one
would put the following Stanford
hack fie Id on the field to answer the
starting whistle: Paulman at full,
Coffis, left half; Kirsch, right half;
;ind Coldiron, quarter.
Cal's four horsemen will un
doubtedly be composed of the old
first string stand-bys, Johnny Meek,
Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman, and
Dave Anderson.
In the line, the prognosticating
job is a little easier. The starting
tackles and guards are pretty well
set. The old stand-bys, Pete Zagar
and Stan Anderson, will probably
start at tackles with Bob Dakan and
Leo Ferko getting the call at the
two guard positions for the Indians.
Stone To Start
Captain Grant Stone will start at
light end, but the left Cardinal
flankman is still unnamed. Neil Ras
mussen, Bill Willard, and Irv Cum
in ings are being juggled around at

this .spot.
It's that season-old question at
center . . . Tony Calvelli or Louis
Tsoutsouvar.
There's all the difference in the
world between the Cal first and sec
ond string lines. The Bear line that
will undoubtedly start the game, if
nothing unforeseen happens, will be
composed of Schwartz and Dolman
at ends, De Varena and Stall at
tackles, Stockton and Evans at
guards, and All-American Bob
Herwig at center.
Yesterday both teams ran through
light practice drills. The coaches
are taking no chances on injuries at
this late date. Tonight Tiny will take
his Indians to a retreat in the Los
Gatos hills, where they rest in peace
and quiet before coming back to the
Farm tomorrow before game time.
Bears Favored
Stub Allison's Golden Bears leave
this morning for their Old Home
stead to rest for the battle. The
Bears' secluded spot is in the hills
just 20 minutes' ride from the scene
of tomorrow's rlassic.
Despite Cal's amazing past record
and Stanford's up and down season
record, the Big Game tomorrow in
the Stanford Stadium is going to be
a battle from start to finish,
California has the best team and
is favored to win, but watch your
step, Bears; a fighting team with
lots on the ball and a couple of
good breaks can beat the best team
in the country.
