# 'Red' Ready for 12th Game Grad Returns to Lead Band
## 
### 
He's strutted over many hun
dreds of yard - stripes since he
twirled has first baton for the Stan
ford Band, has this immense guy
who tomorrow will lead the band
into his twelfth Big Game.
Leading a 100-piece marching unit
through intricate maneuvers with
precision is a tough job, but Bill

"Red" Okker has been doing it every
year since 1925, with one exception
â€”1931.
He's finished his work in med
school, but he still comes back.
Every fall, Stanford grid fans see
the familiar 6-foot 6^-inch figure
with the 24-inch hat step out in
front of the band.
This year the Tall One has worked
out plans for lots of spelling to be

done by the bund on the field. First
maneuver will bring the marchers
to the center of the field, where they
will form block letters "U.C." fac
ing the Cal rooting section. Then,
executing an about-face, the band
will shift into an "S.U." toward the
Stanford side.
Next will come an immense stunt,
which necessitates the use of nearly
the whole length of the field. March
ing along the Cal side, each row of
the band will halt until the whole
group is spread out between the ten
yard markers. Then the word
"Bears" will be formed. The same
maneuver will take place on the op
posite side, with the word "Indian"
being spelled out for the Stanford
rooters.
