# Wilbur Issues Warning On Celebrations
## Sobriety, Sane Conduct On Week-end Urged By University Head 
### 
Student post-Big Game celebrants
are warned that drunkenness or pos
session of liquor on campus is suffi
cient ground for expulsion in a
statement from Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur issued yesterday by the Presi
dent's office.
Entering a plea for sobriety and
sane conduct in all activities con
cerned with the Big Game, Dr. Wil
bur called the attention of new and
old students to the ruling: "The Uni
versity assumes that the act of reg
istering as a student implies lull
acceptance of the liquor policy of the
University."
Concern Told
In his letter of caution, the Uni
versity President, stated:
"The football game with the Uni
versity of California is a source of
concern to those of us who value
Stanford's reputation. Members of
the student body participate in pub
lic social gatherings in San Francisco
and elsewhere.
"Since it is a time of excitement
and enthusiasm which may easily
lead to serious accidents and to acts
careless or deliberate, on the part of
students which affect not only the
interests of the students but also the
good name of the University, a word
of caution is in order.
'Sad Experience'
"At the present time we are all
in a state of considerable difficulty
as to the public control of the use
of alcoholic liquors. Stanford's po
sition on this subject is based on
long sad experience and is in no
way affected by the present agita
tion or by the present changes.
"The regulations of the University
are meant to prevent the use of
alcoholic liquors of ail sorts on the
campus. At the same time students
who consume liquor elsewhere and
bring the good name of the Univer
sity, as well as their own, into dis
repute through resultant conduct
are liable to discipline.
Expulsion Grounds
"Drunkenness is considered suffi
cient grounds for expulsion from the
University. The principal regulations
of the University are that no student
may bring liquor onto the campus
or have it in his possession in his
living quarters."
Dr. Wilbur's statement also called

the attention of presidents of cam
pus living groups to clauses in leases
prohibiting the presence of liquor,
and said that "the organization will
be held responsible for the infringe-

I merit of this clause by any member
or guest even if the organization had
,no knowledge of the presence of
1 liquor before its discovery in the
I house."

careless or deliberate, on the part of
students which affect not only the
interests of the students but also the
good name of the University, a word
of caution is in order.
'Sad Experience'
"At the present time we are all
in a state of considerable difficulty
as to the public control of the use
of alcoholic liquors. Stanford's po
sition on this subject is based on
long sad experience and is in no
way affected by the present agita
tion or by the present changes.
"The regulations of the University
are meant to prevent the use of
alcoholic liquors of ail sorts on the
campus. At the same time students
who consume liquor elsewhere and
bring the good name of the Univer
sity, as well as their own, into dis
repute through resultant conduct
are liable to discipline.
Expulsion Grounds
"Drunkenness is considered suffi
cient grounds for expulsion from the
University. The principal regulations
of the University are that no student
may bring liquor onto the campus
or have it in his possession in his
living quarters."
Dr. Wilbur's statement also called

the attention of presidents of cam
pus living groups to clauses in leases
prohibiting the presence of liquor,
and said that "the organization will
be held responsible for the infringe-

I merit of this clause by any member
or guest even if the organization had
,no knowledge of the presence of
1 liquor before its discovery in the
I house."
Student post-Big Game celebrants
are warned that drunkenness or pos
session of liquor on campus is suffi
cient ground for expulsion in a
statement from Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur issued yesterday by the Presi
dent's office.
Entering a plea for sobriety and
sane conduct in all activities con
cerned with the Big Game, Dr. Wil
bur called the attention of new and
old students to the ruling: "The Uni
versity assumes that the act of reg
istering as a student implies lull
acceptance of the liquor policy of the
University."
Concern Told
In his letter of caution, the Uni
versity President, stated:
"The football game with the Uni
versity of California is a source of
concern to those of us who value
Stanford's reputation. Members of
the student body participate in pub
lic social gatherings in San Francisco
and elsewhere.
"Since it is a time of excitement
and enthusiasm which may easily
lead to serious accidents and to acts
careless or deliberate, on the part of
students which affect not only the
interests of the students but also the
good name of the University, a word
of caution is in order.
