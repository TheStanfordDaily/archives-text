# Stanford Announces Plans for New Dance Department
## College Set To Launch New Major Margaret Jewell Heads Division; Men Invited To Take Instruction 
### ESTELLE SEID 
' Because of an "A" that a junior
at a Midwestern university received
a few years ago, Stanford now offers
a course in The Dance as a major
leading to a degree and teaching
credential.
The "A" was the grade Miss Mar
garet Elaine Jewell, director of the
dance, got. in her first class of danc
ing. Since then she has taken her
Master's in dancing at the University
of Wisconsin, been at the Wigman
School uf the Dance in New York
and at the Workshop at Bennington
College in Vermont. Miss Jewell also
has taken part in small concerts and
dance groups.
Scientific Study
After this preparation, she has
taken over the reins at Stanford and
is the one who doles out the "A's" to
juniors who get stiff and sore over
in the women's gym.
The course of The Dan,ce is an
aesthetic and scientific study. The
student taking the course spends half
her time learning the techniques of
dancing and the other half studying
anatomy and physiology.
The technique is important be
cause it is sheer exercise to attain
flexibility and strength. The science
Is to give the student a knowledge
of the anatomical basis for move
ment and the properties of move
ment.
Cultural Background
The required courses within the
dance department are: Philosophy
and History of Dance; Trends in
Contemporary Dance; and Dance
choreography, which includes prin
ciples of dance composition of the
Solo, the small group, and the mass
group.
The reason for such a varied study
is to offer courses which will afford
q broad background of multural
knowledge. The main trend of the
study is to picture contemporary
life and problems through move
ment.
Men Included
Women are not the privileged so
far as dancing is concerned, because
men get their workout by Miss Jew
ell once a week, too. The speech and
drama lads are required to take one
hour a week of the regular dance
technique with special emphasis on
the type of movement suitable to
men. This is to make the men more
graceful when they step on the stage
to emote.
This is the first course of the type
to be offered in a university on the
Pacific Coast and one of the few in
the United States., Now when a
woman graduates with this degree
she can find a place in a newly im
portant and not yet overcrowded
field.
