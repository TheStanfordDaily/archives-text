Although Stanford lost the Big
Game in 1898 by a score of 22-0,
thirty Stanford "volunteers" for
the Spanish - American War "en
joyed for three days the proud de
lights of victors."
Someone had sent a false cable
saying that Stanford had won the
game, explained the late John ,M.
Switzer in a letter to Dr. David Starr
Jordan, written from Manila, De
cember 26, 1898.
Despite loss of the game, the vol
unteers saw cause for joy even in
victory for Cal.
"Let Berkeley rejoice," said the
letter. "It requires occasional de
feats to develop the determined man.
Our long line of victories has gradu
ally dimmed the annual rejoicing
over the success of our sturdy ath
letes, but next year we will once
more fully appreciate our victory."
Cal won the game in '99 by a score
of 30-0.
Royal Brougham, sports editor of
the Seattle P.1., has a novel way of
' picking candidates for the Ail-
American roll of honor. He just
i "gets around" to them, according to
j his column.
