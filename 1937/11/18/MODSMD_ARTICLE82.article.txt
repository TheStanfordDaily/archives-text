## Farm Audience To See Streamlined Version Of Ben Jonson Play 
### 
An extra performance of Ben
Jonson's "The Alchemist" will be
presented in the Little Theater at
4:15 o'clock Tuesday afternoon in
addition to the scheduled staging
Monday night at 8 o'clock.
Capacity houses during the four
night run of "Don Juan" were the
basis of the decision by Director
Richard Tate to present the Eliza
bethan satire twice. The hour on
Tuesday was selected to avoid con
flict with scheduled campus activi
ties and Thanksgiving vacation.

chemist" was announced yesterday.

Ed Clarke as Face, Janet Dole as Dol

Janet Goldstein will be two neigh
bors. Stage manager for the produc
tion is Theodor Dirks. Dorothy Po
sey is in charge of costumes, J. P.
Cahn is handling the lighting.
Streamlined Script
The version of the play to be pro
duced here is a streamlined one of
the original script. It eliminates the
long-winded passages that were in
style in Ben Jonson's day, but' are
not attuned to modern presentation.
The activity of a group of swin
dlers in London in 1610 forms the
basis of the plot of "The Alchemist."
The crafty combine fleeces dupes of
all types by practicing alchemy, divi
nation, astrology, and other pseudo
sciences.
Second in Series
This is the second in a series of
plays being presented in the new
Little Theater this year. Moliere's
"Don Juan," first production, was
an overwhelming success during its
| extended run.
"The Trojan Women" by Euripi
des is scheduled on the series early
next month. - * â–
