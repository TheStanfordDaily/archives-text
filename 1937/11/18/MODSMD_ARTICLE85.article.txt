# 'University Division' Opens Next Quarter
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
Pointing the way toward a new era in Stanford education, plans are
being completed for the actual operation next quarter of the University
Division, Dr. J. P. Mitchell, University registrar, declared yesterday.

Last July the Academic Council*
authorized the creation of the new
division, which will serve the pur
pose of meeting the needs of students
of marked ability who are planning
graduate work and who wish to or
ganize their upper division and grad
uate work into a single unit.
During the past quarter University
officials "have been getting the ma
chinery ready for the operation of
the new division," Dr. Mitchell ex
plained. Consequently, no students
are carrying on work under its prin
ciples at the present time.
40 to Enroll
Pointing out that it will take sev
eral quarters before the new division
is in complete operation, the Regis
trar predicted that the Division will
have an enrollment of between 30
and 40 students during winter quar
ter.
"The University Division," a bul
letin to be published in the near
future by the University explains,
"has been organized to permit stu
dents of distinctly superior ability
to proceed directly toward the de
gree of Master of Arts, or other ad
vanced degrees, without obtaining
(he degree of Bachelor of Arts, or
having necessarily conformed to the
requirements for this degree or for
lhe Lower Division."
The plan will involve individual
program of study; personal consulta
tion with members of the faculty in
charge of the field chosen; mainte
nance of a high standard of scholar

ship; and final approval of the stu
dent's program by the Graduate
Study Committee, as acceptable for
the advanced degree desired.
Three Classes
The following three classes of stu
dents may be candidates for admis
sion to the University Division:
1. Junior transfer students who
have a minimum scholastic record
equivalent to a B average at Stanford.
2. Lower Division students who
have maintained B averages or bet
ter for at least two quarters' work.
3 .Upper Division students who
have a B average.
In all eases, students desiring ad
mission to the division must have
the approval of the faculty of the
school or department within which
the work leading to the advanced
degree is to be taken, Dr. Mitchell
said.
All women's application creden
tials for work next quarter must be
filed by December 1, while the final
date for presentation of men's ap
plications is December 10. Admis
sion may still be granted after these
dates if quotas have not been filled.


DR. J. P. MITCHELL will head
Stanford's new University Divi
sion, which will be started next
quarter.
