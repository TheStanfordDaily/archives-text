### 
Burned in the lawn in front
of the Ad Building, an eight
foot "C" appeared yesterday
morning — first tangible evi
dence of Big Game enthusiasm
at Cal this year.
As soon as he heard of it,
J. W. McDonnell, superintend
ent of buildings and grounds,
had the spot spaded and re
seeded. then noticed the seeded
area was still in the shape of a
conspicuous "C."
Said Mr. McDonnell: "We'll
put in some sod tomorrow so
the place won't be noticed." He
agreed the species of grass will
have to be the same as the rest
of the lawn if the initial is to
be indistinguishable.
