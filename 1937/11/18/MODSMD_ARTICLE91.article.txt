# Cal Loses Axe Handle in Raid; Cards Hope to Take Axe Head
## Loot Alleged To Be 'Wrong' Article 
### BILL MOSES 
This is another "now it can be
told" story. The Stanford Axe han
dle is again in the possession of
Stanford although the Berkeley
boys still have the Axe â€” at least
until tomorrow.
A well-planned raid staged last
fall by three Sigma Chi's, Dick Rid
dell,' Howie Topping, and Bud Fc
der, resulted in the handle's return
to the Farm. A year ago, these men
took the handle from the Sigma Pi
fraternity, located near the Berke
ley stadium.
The recapturing of the Axe han
dle is in miniature comparable to
the way the immortal 21 Sequoia
roughs regained the Stanford Axe in
April of 1930. Some may remember
that the Stanfordite who took the
Axe from an armored car, heavily
guarded by Cal men, posed as a pho
tographer in order to get near the
Axe.
Raid Planned
Yelling, "Give us a shot at the
Stanford Axe," the pseudo - news
hawk and companions stopped the
armored car, set their cameras, and
exploded flash powder in the faces
of the guards. Howard Avery
snatched the Axe blade from Norm
Horner, Axe Custodian, passed it to
Bob Loofbourow who slipped it un
der his sweater and walked leisurely
to the camera car, while his col
leagues laid a tear gas smoke screen
to cover his getaway. All Cal had
when the fumes cleared was the Axe
handle and some angry guards.
The taking of the handle itself was
planned months ahead by Topping,
Riddell, and Feder. When they ar
rived at the Sigma Pi house shortly
before dawn, one sophomore was
guarding the Axe handle. He saw
the three men walking quietly up
the front lawn, and started running
up the stairs. By the time he neared
the top of the stairs, Topping was in
the front hall.
Guard Suspicious
The sophomore asked him what he
wanted, to which Topping replied,
"f have a message for Ray Jones.
Get him out of bed." At this the
guard evidently became suspicious, !
lied down the second floor hall.
Meanwhile, Riddell slipped in !
through the front door, ran to the !
den in the rear of the house, leaped i
upon a table near the fireplace and |
tore the Axe handle from its moor- j
ings above the mantlepiece. Run- \
ning through the house, Riddell j
passed Topping, who had stationed
himself at the foot of the stairs to
hold off the defenders.
Picking up Feder, the lookout, in
front of the house, Riddell ran with ]
the handle to their car, where Top
ping soon met them. The return
trip to Stanford was uneventful be
cause the Sigma Pi's did not galvan
ize into action until the trio had
escaped them.
Authenticity Doubted
According to Bill Murrish, editor
of the Daily Californian, the Axe
handle Riddell, Topping, and Feder
captured is not the one which was
on the Stanford Axe originally. The
first handle, Murrish asserts, was
thrown into the bay when Cal men
stole the Axe in 1899. Because of the
hot chase Stanford gave the ab
ductors of the Axe, the handle had
to be thrown overboard a ferry boat
so that the blade could be taken
across to Berkeley unnoticed by any
Stanford passengers.
However, no other handle has been
located, and unless another one can
be found, this handle cannot be
questioned. It has old faded blue
and gold silk ribbons tied to the I
stock, as the photograph shows, and i
markings on the head end which {
show the Axe's last resting place, j
Likewise, the handle tallies in every j
respect with pictures taken of the j
Axe before Stanford regained it in I
1930.
