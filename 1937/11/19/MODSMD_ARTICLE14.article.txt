The above drawing, made expressly for The Daily by Howard
Brodic of the San Francisco Chronicle, was rushed through the
Chronicle's engraving plant last night to make possible its appearance
today.
Throughout the entire production of this 18-page Rig Game issue
The Daily has enjoyed fullest co-operation from Chronicle's Co
sports Editor Bill Leiser, from the photographic staff and from How
ard Brodic, whose full-page color drawing of the Big Game will
appear in the Chronicle rotogravure Sunday.
