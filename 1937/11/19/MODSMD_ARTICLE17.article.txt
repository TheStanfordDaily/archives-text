## Bear Writer Sees Change In '37 Scene Records to Date Force Allison's Men to 2-1 Favorites in Betting

The scene changes!
Hah! We remember well a dreary
trip down into your region back in
the dark days of 1935. We found
ourselves surrounded, walled in and
hissed at vehemently, no less, by a
mob of students that could un
doubtedly and without argument
have been classed as the most con
fident and brazen on earth.
We were timid and afraid at every
turn lest a flock of sneering natives,
bloated with endless victory,
should burst our eardrums with
their ceaseless roaring.
Our football team, too, manned at
not a few key positions by inexperi
enced sophomores, was nervous. But
your grid squad, the cause of all
your cockiness, wasn't excited a bit.
It was all in the day's work for
them us they went out and slaugh
tered the Bears and gave you more
to gloat about.
Stanford Obnoxious
Like all good things, though, that
year had to come to an end. Came
the 193G season. With the back
ground of victory still on your side,
you were still slightly overbearing.
Then the cycle changed. You
j were squelched. You were driven
home with your tails between your
legs, so to speak.
And now. with the Golden Bears
riding the crest of a mighty string
of victories, it will be the blue and
gold hatted Californians who will be
carrying the cocky attitude when
they trek into old Palo Alto again
tomorrow. It will be the sons of
Stanfoi'd who are depending on in
experienced men ,at key positions.
And, it will be the Blue of Berkeley
that stalks onto the field of battle
calmly and kicks the opposition
fairly well toothless.
The scene changes! And do we
love it!
Stanford Doubtful?
Doubtless you westerners have a
few ideas of your own on that third
consideration. You probably believe
that the 1937 situation will not be
changed at all in that respect from
that of 1935.
Well, everyone is entitled to his
opinion and we realize that you
have some good arguments to back
up your stand. We have heard no
little about one Moses Fay, the lad
who has led you from the wilder
ness.
At the same time we remember
j well—too well, in fact —the feats of
I Veterans Bill Paulman and Jimmy
Coffis. They played hell with us in
1935. Hearing that the former will
be at his best for the first time in
two years Saturday has not been
encouraging news at all to loyal
Berkeleyans.
Respect for Stone, /agar
From last year we know that Grant
Stone and Pete Fay are tough. Our
j sophomores realize full well that
Anderson is a powerhouse. And we
' have digested carefully all the re
' ports on the prowess of old Wallace
Beery Walton.
Yet if verbal proof were all it
took to decide that battle out there
tomorrow, we have three arguments
that would put you over the barrel
• in less than a quarter.
California's record speaks for it
' self. It. is better than yours in ail
but one instance — the comparative
I Washington scores. We respect you
i deeply for that upset, because those
, Huskies are good. But look at the-
I comparative results against Oregon,
| Oregon State. U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
! Washington State. That's one item
j in our favor.
Argument number two rests on the 1
individual records of our team mem- 1
bers. There are six seniors and five j
juniors. That means no inexperi- J
ence. And Ail-Americans are to be '
found in the line-up at not infre
quent intervals. Herwig, Meek, !
Chapman, Schwartz, and a few !
others should gain national recog- '
nition.
Though the odds are all with us,
we know that it is going to be a
hell of a tough battle tomorrow on
that greensward (Gear sez you have
one). You usually hit your peak
against us, as we do for you. And '
often the underdog plays way over j
his head, especially when there is :
as much at stake as there will be ;
this time.
But the favorites will not do so
badly. Conservative Coach Stub
Allison says they'll play their best
game of the year.
That's the final reason we believe ;
the third pail of that horrible 1935
scene will be changed even as the ;
rest has.

rest has.
Sports Editor, Daily Californian
The scene changes!
Hah! We remember well a dreary
trip down into your region back in
the dark days of 1935. We found
ourselves surrounded, walled in and
hissed at vehemently, no less, by a
mob of students that could un
doubtedly and without argument
have been classed as the most con
fident and brazen on earth.
We were timid and afraid at every
turn lest a flock of sneering natives,
bloated with endless victory,
should burst our eardrums with
their ceaseless roaring.
Our football team, too, manned at
not a few key positions by inexperi
enced sophomores, was nervous. But
your grid squad, the cause of all
your cockiness, wasn't excited a bit.
It was all in the day's work for
them us they went out and slaugh
tered the Bears and gave you more
to gloat about.
Stanford Obnoxious
Like all good things, though, that
year had to come to an end. Came
the 193G season. With the back
ground of victory still on your side,
you were still slightly overbearing.
Then the cycle changed. You
j were squelched. You were driven
home with your tails between your
legs, so to speak.
And now. with the Golden Bears
riding the crest of a mighty string
of victories, it will be the blue and
gold hatted Californians who will be
carrying the cocky attitude when
they trek into old Palo Alto again
tomorrow. It will be the sons of
Stanfoi'd who are depending on in
experienced men ,at key positions.
And, it will be the Blue of Berkeley
that stalks onto the field of battle
calmly and kicks the opposition
fairly well toothless.
The scene changes! And do we
love it!
Stanford Doubtful?
Doubtless you westerners have a
few ideas of your own on that third
consideration. You probably believe
that the 1937 situation will not be
changed at all in that respect from
that of 1935.
Well, everyone is entitled to his
opinion and we realize that you
have some good arguments to back
up your stand. We have heard no
little about one Moses Fay, the lad
who has led you from the wilder
ness.
At the same time we remember
j well—too well, in fact —the feats of
I Veterans Bill Paulman and Jimmy
Coffis. They played hell with us in
1935. Hearing that the former will
be at his best for the first time in
two years Saturday has not been
encouraging news at all to loyal
Berkeleyans.
Respect for Stone, /agar
From last year we know that Grant
Stone and Pete Fay are tough. Our
j sophomores realize full well that
Anderson is a powerhouse. And we
' have digested carefully all the re
' ports on the prowess of old Wallace
Beery Walton.
Yet if verbal proof were all it
took to decide that battle out there
tomorrow, we have three arguments
that would put you over the barrel
• in less than a quarter.
California's record speaks for it
' self. It. is better than yours in ail
but one instance — the comparative
I Washington scores. We respect you
i deeply for that upset, because those
, Huskies are good. But look at the-
I comparative results against Oregon,
| Oregon State. U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
! Washington State. That's one item
j in our favor.
Argument number two rests on the 1
individual records of our team mem- 1
bers. There are six seniors and five j
juniors. That means no inexperi- J
ence. And Ail-Americans are to be '
found in the line-up at not infre
quent intervals. Herwig, Meek, !
Chapman, Schwartz, and a few !
others should gain national recog- '
nition.
Though the odds are all with us,
we know that it is going to be a
hell of a tough battle tomorrow on
that greensward (Gear sez you have
one). You usually hit your peak
against us, as we do for you. And '
often the underdog plays way over j
his head, especially when there is :
as much at stake as there will be ;
this time.
But the favorites will not do so
badly. Conservative Coach Stub
Allison says they'll play their best
game of the year.
That's the final reason we believe ;
the third pail of that horrible 1935
scene will be changed even as the ;
rest has.

Hah! We remember well a dreary
trip down into your region back in
the dark days of 1935. We found
ourselves surrounded, walled in and
hissed at vehemently, no less, by a
mob of students that could un
doubtedly and without argument
have been classed as the most con
fident and brazen on earth.
We were timid and afraid at every
turn lest a flock of sneering natives,
bloated with endless victory,
should burst our eardrums with
their ceaseless roaring.
Our football team, too, manned at
not a few key positions by inexperi
enced sophomores, was nervous. But
your grid squad, the cause of all
your cockiness, wasn't excited a bit.
It was all in the day's work for
them us they went out and slaugh
tered the Bears and gave you more
to gloat about.
Stanford Obnoxious
Like all good things, though, that
year had to come to an end. Came
the 193G season. With the back
ground of victory still on your side,
you were still slightly overbearing.
Then the cycle changed. You
j were squelched. You were driven
home with your tails between your
legs, so to speak.
And now. with the Golden Bears
riding the crest of a mighty string
of victories, it will be the blue and
gold hatted Californians who will be
carrying the cocky attitude when
they trek into old Palo Alto again
tomorrow. It will be the sons of
Stanfoi'd who are depending on in
experienced men ,at key positions.
And, it will be the Blue of Berkeley
that stalks onto the field of battle
calmly and kicks the opposition
fairly well toothless.
The scene changes! And do we
love it!
Stanford Doubtful?
Doubtless you westerners have a
few ideas of your own on that third
consideration. You probably believe
that the 1937 situation will not be
changed at all in that respect from
that of 1935.
Well, everyone is entitled to his
opinion and we realize that you
have some good arguments to back
up your stand. We have heard no
little about one Moses Fay, the lad
who has led you from the wilder
ness.
At the same time we remember
j well—too well, in fact —the feats of
I Veterans Bill Paulman and Jimmy
Coffis. They played hell with us in
1935. Hearing that the former will
be at his best for the first time in
two years Saturday has not been
encouraging news at all to loyal
Berkeleyans.
Respect for Stone, /agar
From last year we know that Grant
Stone and Pete Fay are tough. Our
j sophomores realize full well that
Anderson is a powerhouse. And we
' have digested carefully all the re
' ports on the prowess of old Wallace
Beery Walton.
Yet if verbal proof were all it
took to decide that battle out there
tomorrow, we have three arguments
that would put you over the barrel
• in less than a quarter.
California's record speaks for it
' self. It. is better than yours in ail
but one instance — the comparative
I Washington scores. We respect you
i deeply for that upset, because those
, Huskies are good. But look at the-
I comparative results against Oregon,
| Oregon State. U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
! Washington State. That's one item
j in our favor.
Argument number two rests on the 1
individual records of our team mem- 1
bers. There are six seniors and five j
juniors. That means no inexperi- J
ence. And Ail-Americans are to be '
found in the line-up at not infre
quent intervals. Herwig, Meek, !
Chapman, Schwartz, and a few !
others should gain national recog- '
nition.
Though the odds are all with us,
we know that it is going to be a
hell of a tough battle tomorrow on
that greensward (Gear sez you have
one). You usually hit your peak
against us, as we do for you. And '
often the underdog plays way over j
his head, especially when there is :
as much at stake as there will be ;
this time.
But the favorites will not do so
badly. Conservative Coach Stub
Allison says they'll play their best
game of the year.
That's the final reason we believe ;
the third pail of that horrible 1935
scene will be changed even as the ;
rest has.
