# Stone To Shoulder Signal Calling Job
## 
### 
As Big Game captain for Stanford,
Grant Stone, hard-hitting Indian
right end, and outstanding candidate
for all-Coast honors, will carry the
responsibility of signal calling and
other heavy duties which rest on the
shoulders of team captains.
Stub Aiiison will follow his usual
routine of not naming the California
captain until game time, but it is
expected that tho honor will go to
Johnny Meek, quarterback, or Bob
Herwig, center, both also leading
contenders for all-Coast nomination
in their respective positions.
