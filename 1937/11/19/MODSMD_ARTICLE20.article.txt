# Indian Hoop Team Set for Third Title Quest
## Another Lean Year Seen By Coast Coaches Weaker Opposition This Season Makes Card Five Team To Beat 
### WALT PETERSON 
Having trumped all over every
thing in its way for two years now,
including the cream of the East and
Mid-We.st as well as of the Pacific
Coast, the Stanford basketball var
.sity Is just about set to start on its
third season of marauding.
Two years ago P.C.C. coaches gave
lip hope for any season until 1938-
when the Three Basketeers, Lui
setti, Calderwood, and Stoefen will
he gone from the Cardinal battle
front.
Those coaches watched the Lui
setti-sparked five caper through a
glorious 1936 season to the Coast
title, and then settled on their heels
to admire Hank and the Indians as
they swept to the championship
again last spring. This season they
are once more on their heels, ready
to concede all honors to Luisetti,
Calderwood, Stoefen and the rest of
the gang.
U.S.C. Weaker
The opposition that was offered
the Cards last season by Southern
California will not be present this
year, from all indications, since it
will be very hard to replace two such
men as Oram and Gracin. Califor
nia's team lost its sharpshooter, Ray
Balsley, among several others, and
its sophomores will be no better than
Stanford's this winter.
U.C.L.A. without John Ball won't
be the same. With those three teams
weaker than last year, and Stanford
at least as strong as last season, the
conference looks to be all Cardinal.
Unfortunate though it is to be on
the pinnacle as a dandy target, Stan
ford can't help but be there this year.
And every coach who faces a Stan
ford game will be gunning for the
team that gained national acclaim by
trouncing Long Island University
just after Christmas, 1936. Yes, it
won't be just the Pacific Coast Con
ference teams that will be out for
Stanford—Claire Bee and his L.I.U.
Blackbirds want revenge, particu
larly.
Full Schedule
Probably the highest sport of the
season will be on the Eastern tour
tHat starts Dec. '20. Coach John
Burin's lads will run into four very
lough contests in six nights when
(hey get to New York, and »fatigue
will be one of their greatest oppon

The siege stars off with C.C.N.Y.
Dec. 27, and then comes L.1.U., Dec.
29. The Indians shouldn't be too
tired for the second tilt, but
third, Dec. 30, with Temple ft P'i i • -
