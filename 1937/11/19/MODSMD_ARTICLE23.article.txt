## Cal, Columbia Two Bit 'If's' 
### ARCH JENKINS 
If Stanford wins the Big Game and
If Stanford trounces Columbia in
New York, there is a possibility that
All-American mention might be be
stowed upon those Indians who hap
pen to look best in both these major
clashes.
Most All-American teams are
picked through hearsay or through
the possibility that an All-Star se
lector might drop in on an intersec
tional skirmish and jot down a few
notes on what's going on.
Big Pete Zagar, Stanford's best
tackle, is on a par with any lineman
on the Coast. Bill Paulman, Grant
Stone, and Pete Fay are style play
ers who could feel at home on any
All-American. But a mediocre team
without too much publicity never
seems to land many men on the
"Best" squads.
Watch Railbirds
So if Stanford cops the conference
title, watch the railbirds and Sunday
morning quarterbacks start bally
hooing Card Men Zagar, Fay, Stone,
or maybe some other luminary who
will flash in the next two games.
Maybe Bill Paulman will get back
in New York and boot a few 70-
yard kicks, drop in a field goal, and
perhaps one or two touchdown
passes. Then the New York writers
will want him and possibly others
on their team.
Maybe Pete Fay will scamper all
around these touted Cal ' : n'?men and

break away for a touchdown. Stone
might be a bear-cat on the defense
all day or he might catch one of
Paulman's fast strikes.
Ail-American men rely on pub
licity and a good supporting team to
put them on top. To date, Stanford
has had some bits of intermittent
flashy play but that would set
up any one player for recognition on
a nation-wide scale.
Lean Years
The Indians haven't had a bona
fide Ail-American since Grayson,
Moserip, and Hamilton put them
selves in football's Hall of Fame.
California has a dubious system of
playing up a certain player in their
game programs. They tell all about
the player in hand, what he did.
might do, whom he goes with, and
other jargon.
It might be well for Stanford to
follow suit and get a few of their
Zagars, Stones, and Fays those neat
little certificates which say across
them in big letters—All American.

put them on top. To date, Stanford
has had some bits of intermittent
flashy play but that would set
up any one player for recognition on
a nation-wide scale.
Lean Years
The Indians haven't had a bona
fide Ail-American since Grayson,
Moserip, and Hamilton put them
selves in football's Hall of Fame.
California has a dubious system of
playing up a certain player in their
game programs. They tell all about
the player in hand, what he did.
might do, whom he goes with, and
other jargon.
It might be well for Stanford to
follow suit and get a few of their
Zagars, Stones, and Fays those neat
little certificates which say across
them in big letters—All American.
If Stanford wins the Big Game and
If Stanford trounces Columbia in
New York, there is a possibility that
All-American mention might be be
stowed upon those Indians who hap
pen to look best in both these major
clashes.
Most All-American teams are
picked through hearsay or through
the possibility that an All-Star se
lector might drop in on an intersec
tional skirmish and jot down a few
notes on what's going on.
Big Pete Zagar, Stanford's best
tackle, is on a par with any lineman
on the Coast. Bill Paulman, Grant
Stone, and Pete Fay are style play
ers who could feel at home on any
All-American. But a mediocre team
without too much publicity never
seems to land many men on the
"Best" squads.
Watch Railbirds
So if Stanford cops the conference
title, watch the railbirds and Sunday
morning quarterbacks start bally
hooing Card Men Zagar, Fay, Stone,
or maybe some other luminary who
will flash in the next two games.
Maybe Bill Paulman will get back
in New York and boot a few 70-
yard kicks, drop in a field goal, and
perhaps one or two touchdown
passes. Then the New York writers
will want him and possibly others
on their team.
Maybe Pete Fay will scamper all
around these touted Cal ' : n'?men and

break away for a touchdown. Stone
might be a bear-cat on the defense
all day or he might catch one of
Paulman's fast strikes.
Ail-American men rely on pub
licity and a good supporting team to
put them on top. To date, Stanford
has had some bits of intermittent
flashy play but that would set
up any one player for recognition on
a nation-wide scale.
