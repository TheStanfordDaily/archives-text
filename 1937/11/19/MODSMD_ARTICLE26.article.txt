### 
Cal's eleven-man cross country team arrived at the Farm yesterday
afternoon, placed ten men in a race against Stanford, won all the points,
came within a minute of the course record, refused to let Dink Temple
ton's men do a thing.
Clarence Hall crossed the tape first, running in 22:21.1. Melilert was
second. Powe third, Holland fourth, Vollmer fifth, Orren sixth, li. Baker
seventh, G. Baker eighth, Mclntyre ninth, and Lawrence tenth. These

were the places which counted for
scores in the meet. Cal took them
jail.
Stanford's Captain Ed Burrows
' was beaten out of tenth place by
inches. He was the only Farm man
in the race. Stanford's seven other
men and the only Cal man who
didn't place trailed way back. Hall
was several hundred feet ahead of
| the nearest man when he finished,
: but the other ten men were com
paratively bunched.
It was only the very wet course
which kept Hall from making a bid
I for the course record. As the run
ners came down the last hill before
the tape, many of them slipped and
! nearly lost their balance. It didn't
I make for faster running.
