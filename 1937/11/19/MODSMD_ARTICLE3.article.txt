# ...Stanford Redskins Challenge

BRINGS to the yearly classic a team that has
been climbing upward since the start of the
season. Critics counted it out after a defeat in the
season opener with Santa Clara, but wins over
U.C.L.A., Washington, Southern California, and
Washington State again make the Big Game big.
Victory tomorrow would put the Cards in a tie
for the conference championship, and mean a
possible chance at the Rose Bowl. But more than
that, it would be a defeat to California in a football
rivalry that is the oldest in the West.
Tiny pins his hope for a win on a team that
capitalizes on the breaks, a team that has scored
for the most part on blocked kicks, passes, and
long runs.
Upper left in the photos is the kick that gave
Stanford the U.S.C. game, Dock Luckett's conver
sion of the point after touchdown. In the same
panel, on defense, the Cards present a stone wall
to Bill Sangster, Southern Cal back.
In the center left, Pete Fay starts on a 41-yard
jaunt to the touchdown that preceded Luckett's
kick.
Lower left, Jim Groves starts on a touchdown
dash around left end in the U.C.L.A. game.








Above is Bill Paulman, hard luck man of the Stanford squad.
Injured last year, he saw no action. Injured again this season, he
showed last week that he is ready to go against the Bears.
Below, Jimmy Coffis, stopped at the line of scrimmage, tosses
a perfect lateral to Jake Brigham in the U.C.L.A. game.
