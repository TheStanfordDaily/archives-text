# Fall Time Trials Favor Bear Cindermen
## Cal Trackmen Better Cards In Workouts Pre-season Comparison Shows Bear's Team Best in 8 of 14 Events 
### 
Now that Cal has won the Big
Game—San Francisco papers say
they're a cinch, so why bother to
play it who'll win the Big Meet
when California and Stanford track
men clash next spring? Cal will, of
course. The "dope" is in their favor.
A look at a few of the pre-season
marks of Bear trackmen put them
in the running as top heavy favorites
to win the Big Meet. In the 100-yard
dash Nutting of California would be
leading Stan Hiserman by at least
3 yards, having done 9.8 while Stan
. /.isn't bettered 10.1.
In the 220 Hiserman may have a
little more of a chance, because the
best that California has to offer is
the ineligible Archie Williams lead
ing the boys from across the bay in
22. t against Stan's 22.5. This is
probably better than any eligible
Bear sprinter could do.
Second Fiddle
Even Stanford's captain, Ray Ma
in! I, is playing second fiddle to Mil
ler of Cal in the quarter-mile. Ma
li'lt's best is 51 seconds, while Miller
has turned in a lap of 49.2. That
same Miller in the 880 is seven sec
onds better than the best that any of
the Card haif-milers has done yet
this fall.
Sadaj, up from Cal';; frosh squad of
last year, leads the parade in the two
distance races. His 4:28.5 in the mile
beats Ed Burrows' best time by 10
seconds—GO yards in any track meet,
and his two-mile in 9:51 is 18 sec
onds better than Johnny Emanuel
has turned in.
The hurdles end in a draw. Cal
has already shown a man who can
lop the tall timbers in 15.4—three
tenths of a second better than Dick
Simpson's best effort this Fall. Stan
ford should pick up a first with Hi
serman doing the lows in 25.4.
Field Looks Better
Qn the field Stanford comes just a
little closer to breaking even. Bill
Wohle, an ineligible, leads the list
i ji shot-putters with a heave of 48
feet B'j inches and two other In
dians are better than Cal's Jim Kitts,
who has done 47 feet 9 inches.
Hugh Gribbin is leading the discus
with spins anywhere between 140
and .150 feet. Pete Zagar, N.C.A.A.
discus champ, was last seen in the
Oregon backfield blocking a punt.
Ray Brown, from our last year's
frosh squad, is leading the broad
jumpers from across the bqy with a
leap of 22 feet. Stanford must split
the tuo vertical jumps, the pole
vault and the high jump. Vic Boore
has reached 13 feet with the aid of
the bamboo stick, and is inches
better than his Cal rival, Monroe.
A Bear by the name of Law has
cleared 6 feet 2 inches in the high
jump, at least 4 inches better than
Stanford has to offer. Lehman in the
javelin gives Berkeley another first
place, his 188-foot throw being about
10 feet better than John Steer has yet
been able to do.
Cal Ahead
I'.y these figures the Golden Bear
will claw the Stanford Indian to the
tune of about 8 events to (5. How
ever, don't call the meet off just yet.
Remember that the boys from across
the bridge have been training for a
month longer than Stanford because
their school started around the mid
dle of August.

i ji shot-putters with a heave of 48
feet B'j inches and two other In
dians are better than Cal's Jim Kitts,
who has done 47 feet 9 inches.
Hugh Gribbin is leading the discus
with spins anywhere between 140
and .150 feet. Pete Zagar, N.C.A.A.
discus champ, was last seen in the
Oregon backfield blocking a punt.
Ray Brown, from our last year's
frosh squad, is leading the broad
jumpers from across the bqy with a
leap of 22 feet. Stanford must split
the tuo vertical jumps, the pole
vault and the high jump. Vic Boore
has reached 13 feet with the aid of
the bamboo stick, and is inches
better than his Cal rival, Monroe.
A Bear by the name of Law has
cleared 6 feet 2 inches in the high
jump, at least 4 inches better than
Stanford has to offer. Lehman in the
javelin gives Berkeley another first
place, his 188-foot throw being about
10 feet better than John Steer has yet
been able to do.
Cal Ahead
I'.y these figures the Golden Bear
will claw the Stanford Indian to the
tune of about 8 events to (5. How
ever, don't call the meet off just yet.
Remember that the boys from across
the bridge have been training for a
month longer than Stanford because
their school started around the mid
dle of August.
Now that Cal has won the Big
Game—San Francisco papers say
they're a cinch, so why bother to
play it who'll win the Big Meet
when California and Stanford track
men clash next spring? Cal will, of
course. The "dope" is in their favor.
A look at a few of the pre-season
marks of Bear trackmen put them
in the running as top heavy favorites
to win the Big Meet. In the 100-yard
dash Nutting of California would be
leading Stan Hiserman by at least
3 yards, having done 9.8 while Stan
. /.isn't bettered 10.1.
In the 220 Hiserman may have a
little more of a chance, because the
best that California has to offer is
the ineligible Archie Williams lead
ing the boys from across the bay in
22. t against Stan's 22.5. This is
probably better than any eligible
Bear sprinter could do.
Second Fiddle
Even Stanford's captain, Ray Ma
in! I, is playing second fiddle to Mil
ler of Cal in the quarter-mile. Ma
li'lt's best is 51 seconds, while Miller
has turned in a lap of 49.2. That
same Miller in the 880 is seven sec
onds better than the best that any of
the Card haif-milers has done yet
this fall.
Sadaj, up from Cal';; frosh squad of
last year, leads the parade in the two
distance races. His 4:28.5 in the mile
beats Ed Burrows' best time by 10
seconds—GO yards in any track meet,
and his two-mile in 9:51 is 18 sec
onds better than Johnny Emanuel
has turned in.
The hurdles end in a draw. Cal
has already shown a man who can
lop the tall timbers in 15.4—three
tenths of a second better than Dick
Simpson's best effort this Fall. Stan
ford should pick up a first with Hi
serman doing the lows in 25.4.
