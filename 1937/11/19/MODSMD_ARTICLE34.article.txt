# SIDELINE SLANTS...

### 
The only prediction I'll make on tomorrow's little tussle is that it's going
to be Big Game in fact as well as in name.
Three years ago Millard Browne, custodian of this trying column,
climbed out on the limb with a prediction of the Big Game. He went into
gory details as to how Stanford was going to anihilate Cal. That game
ended 9-7 in favor of the Cards.
Last year the one and only Phil Klauber stuck his neck out of the Daily
Shack with a 13-10 victory prediction for the Indians. You all remember
the score of last year's fracas over in Razzberry Canyon.
I see where the Peerless Pigskin Pickers are taking Cal to win 14-7
tomorrow. If you look close enough you'll see my prediction for that
game favoring the Bears 20-10. I made that forecast in a weaker mo
ment. The Bears are really in for a fight tomorrow afternoon and don't
let anybody kid you.
The Bears have by far the best team. Their plays click beautifully, I heir '
blocking and tackling is superb .... but why go on? The Bears have got I
power and plenty of it, but still Tiny Thornhills boys can pull a major
upset by trimming these highly touted denizens of the Berkeley hills.
Stanford has got a crazy outfit this year, and there has been more than |
one crazy team that has beaten a so-called wonder team. Give Stanford a j
few breaks tomorrow afternoon (and Stanford can surely take advantage of I
the breaks), and the Indians will come out on top. There are hundreds of j
suckers that are giving anywhere from six to 20 points on Cal. Those same
dodos were probably the ones who lost some mazuma giving points on Cal j
against Washington.
Will little Pete Fay break away? In Fay, Stanford has its most po
tent scoring threat, but Cal's record in stopping ace backs on the Coast
this year may be something to take heed of.
The Bears have run up against Joe Gray of Oregon State, Jay Graybeal
of Oregon, Amby Schindler of U.S.C., and Fritz Waskowitz of Washington.
The combined yardage of these four gridiron threats totals exactly 74 yards
from scrimmage. Gray was good for 29; Waskowitz, 24; Schindler, 17; and
Graybeal, 4.
Boy, that's some record .... the great Schindler held to a mere 17
yards on the ground. I still feel that Fay or Coffis will have an even chance
to break away from Cal's wonder players for a score or so. Oregon State,
U.C.L.A., and U.S.C. all proved that Cal's goal line is not invulnerable.
It's all up in the air as to just who will start in tomorrow's classic.
At fullback it will be one of three men: Bill Paulman, Jim Groves, or
Jake Brigham, who has been showing exceptionally well lately.
At left half it'll be either Pete Fay or Jimmy CofTic. Jimmy's edge on
defense may give him the starting call here. At the other half spot will be
either Bill Kirseh or Freddie Ledeboer. Ledeboer is the best ball packer
of the two, but Kirsch has the edge in blocking and is reputed to be one
of the best tacklers on the Coast. ,
At quarterback will be any of five different men: A 1 Alustiza, Gene I
Coldiron, Ed Gamier, Paulman, or Groves.
There is less doubt in the line. At left end, however., there are three
stalwarts viewing for the opening call: Bill Willard, Neil Rosmussen, and
Irv Cuminings. At center it's a tossup between Tony Cavelli and Louis
Tsoutsouvas.
The rest of the positions are pretty secure with Bob Dakan and Leo
Ferko at guards and Stan Andersen and Pete Zagar at tackles.
This afternoon in Encina Pools, Stanford's water polo forces will attempt
to salvage what's left of a disappointing season when they plunge in against
the powerful Golden Bears.
The Bears were rated as the Wonder Team of The Water until
U.C.L.A. dropped them back into line last week with a 4-15 defeat. The
Bears and Bruins arc now tied for the conference leadership and the
Cal amphibians will have to win to stay in the money. The Bears and
Indians tangle again at Berkeley Tuesday afternoon.
After the Westwooders whipped the Bears they came down to the Farm
and were forced into three overtime periods in the closest and hardest
fought game ever witnessed in the local water hole. The Bruins finally
won 5-3.
Today's game should be a battle from start to finish, with the Bears rated
as favorites, but just slight enough favorites to make things interesting.
Harry Maloney's soccer team will kick shins with the Cal hooters
on the Farm soccer field tomorrow morning in a crucial conference
game. A win for the Indians will leave them very much in the run
ning for the title .... a loss will eliminate the Cards.
The Bears won the first one up at Berkeley and will be the favorites
to repeat tomorrow, although Maloney's men will have an almost even
chance to make up for that close one at Cal. â€”GENE GEAR
