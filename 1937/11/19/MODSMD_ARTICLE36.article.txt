# 'World's Most Famous Caddy' Hits Farm On World Trip
## 
### ED BURROWS 
You might not know who "Happy"
O'Brien is, but if you asked Lawson
Little, or Bobby Jones, or Harry
Cooper, or .any other famous golf
pro in the United States they'd tell
you that he's the "World's Most Fa
mous Caddy."
Right now "Happy" is out at the
Stanford Golf Course, but he won't
stay long because he's going South
for the winter —not to L.A. but clear
down to South America. Wait a sec
ond, we're getting ahead of our story.
You'd like to know why he's going
down where no one will be able to
understand a word he says? The
real reason is a little bet of $1,000
with three New York sportsmen that
"Happy" made last June.
Another good pitching prospect is
Hugh Smith, son of a former Pacific-
Coast leaguer. Four catchers, Paul
Fay, Herb Atkinson, Dean Burfcwd,
and Claude Purckitt have shown
ability in practice.
Among outstanding candidates for
infield posts Morty Pfyl, Elton Boone,
Glen South, Jim McCloud, Roy Kitts,
Ed Johansen, Jim Farquharson, and
Usher Tucker are expected to be in
the running for starting berths. Thor
Peterson and Howard Ruth look like
strong contenders for outfield jobs.

Caddy O'Brien left New York last
June 1, and if he wins the bet he
I will have to be in that same New
York June 1, 1939. But that isn't
all. "Happy" has to cover a lot of
I ground before he comes back.
Long Trip
Already he has come from New
| York west to Seattle and then down
to Stanford, but from here he has to
go South to San Diego, from there to
South America, then to England,
Ireland, Scotland, France, and then
back to New York before the dead
line.
Transportation ana money are
O'Brien's biggest worries, because it
is understood in the bet that he can
accept no money other than that
which he gets from caddying, speak
ing over the radio—he has spoken
over innumerable stations—or from
contributions to newspapers.
"Happy's" only means of travel
when on land is by hitch-hiking or,
its alternative, walking. Between
Fargo, North Dakota, and Spokane,
O'Brien had no end of tough luck.
Rides were scarce, he earned only
$1.25 and between the two he almost
starved to death.
Most Famous
The "World's Most Famous Caddy"
was born 39 years ago in Boston, and

has been caddying for 33 years—he
dragged his first bag around a course
when he was 6. During these years
he has caddied for every famous pro
and even a President of the United
States—Harding.
He caddied for two National Open
Champions when they won their
titles, one Professional Golf Associa
tion Champ, two Womens' National
Amateur Champions, two Mens' Na
tional Amateur Champions, and is
the only American born caddy who
ever caddied in the British Open.
"Happy" says that he has never
played on a better course than that
at Stanford, and he should know his
subject, having caddied on 228 since
he left New York. Speaking of West
Coast courses, O'Brien says they are
as good if not better than those in
the East.
"Lighthorse" Harry Cooper, ac
cording to "Happy," is the greatest
all-around golfer in the game. Denny
Shute is the best match player, and
Stanford's Lawson Little has one of
the soundest games.
When "Happy" O'Brien packs his
bag Monday morning to head south,
he will leave behind another handful
of friends that can join with golfing
greats and say, "Sure I've seen the
'World's Most Famous Caddy'!"

You'd like to know why he's going
down where no one will be able to
understand a word he says? The
real reason is a little bet of $1,000
with three New York sportsmen that
"Happy" made last June.
Another good pitching prospect is
Hugh Smith, son of a former Pacific-
Coast leaguer. Four catchers, Paul
Fay, Herb Atkinson, Dean Burfcwd,
and Claude Purckitt have shown
ability in practice.
Among outstanding candidates for
infield posts Morty Pfyl, Elton Boone,
Glen South, Jim McCloud, Roy Kitts,
Ed Johansen, Jim Farquharson, and
Usher Tucker are expected to be in
the running for starting berths. Thor
Peterson and Howard Ruth look like
strong contenders for outfield jobs.

Caddy O'Brien left New York last
June 1, and if he wins the bet he
I will have to be in that same New
York June 1, 1939. But that isn't
all. "Happy" has to cover a lot of
I ground before he comes back.
Long Trip
Already he has come from New
| York west to Seattle and then down
to Stanford, but from here he has to
go South to San Diego, from there to
South America, then to England,
Ireland, Scotland, France, and then
back to New York before the dead
line.
Transportation ana money are
O'Brien's biggest worries, because it
is understood in the bet that he can
accept no money other than that
which he gets from caddying, speak
ing over the radio—he has spoken
over innumerable stations—or from
contributions to newspapers.
"Happy's" only means of travel
when on land is by hitch-hiking or,
its alternative, walking. Between
Fargo, North Dakota, and Spokane,
O'Brien had no end of tough luck.
Rides were scarce, he earned only
$1.25 and between the two he almost
starved to death.
Most Famous
The "World's Most Famous Caddy"
was born 39 years ago in Boston, and

has been caddying for 33 years—he
dragged his first bag around a course
when he was 6. During these years
he has caddied for every famous pro
and even a President of the United
States—Harding.
He caddied for two National Open
Champions when they won their
titles, one Professional Golf Associa
tion Champ, two Womens' National
Amateur Champions, two Mens' Na
tional Amateur Champions, and is
the only American born caddy who
ever caddied in the British Open.
"Happy" says that he has never
played on a better course than that
at Stanford, and he should know his
subject, having caddied on 228 since
he left New York. Speaking of West
Coast courses, O'Brien says they are
as good if not better than those in
the East.
"Lighthorse" Harry Cooper, ac
cording to "Happy," is the greatest
all-around golfer in the game. Denny
Shute is the best match player, and
Stanford's Lawson Little has one of
the soundest games.
When "Happy" O'Brien packs his
bag Monday morning to head south,
he will leave behind another handful
of friends that can join with golfing
greats and say, "Sure I've seen the
'World's Most Famous Caddy'!"
You might not know who "Happy"
O'Brien is, but if you asked Lawson
Little, or Bobby Jones, or Harry
Cooper, or .any other famous golf
pro in the United States they'd tell
you that he's the "World's Most Fa
mous Caddy."
Right now "Happy" is out at the
Stanford Golf Course, but he won't
stay long because he's going South
for the winter —not to L.A. but clear
down to South America. Wait a sec
