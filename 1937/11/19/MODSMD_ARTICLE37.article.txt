# Indians Leave Soon after Tilt
## Cards To Head for Lion Win, 6:30 Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's football forces are al
lowed just one hour of celebration
tomorrow nightâ€”they leave the S.P.
station at 6:30 o'clock for New York
in quest of the pelt of the Colum
bia Lion.
Although Columbia can't claim an
important win this year, the game
should bring out the spirit that al
ways accompanies this intersectional
clash.
Stanford in two meetings has
never beaten the New York team.
Again this year, as in the Rose
Bowl game two years ago and in last
year's frozen encounter, Stanford is
the favorite and definitely should
come out on top.
Columbia is way down the scale
in eastern football circles; its biggest
achievement so far this season is no
more than a tie against Syracuse.
But Columbia was very much of an
underdog twice before, and each
time a long run proved enough for
victory.
Still grooming his squad for the
all-important game with California
tomorrow, Coach Tiny Thornhill says
of the Columbia expedition, "I have
not even had a chance to think of the
thing yet."
