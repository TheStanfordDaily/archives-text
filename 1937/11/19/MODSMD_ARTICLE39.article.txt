# Mural Play Preps Golfers for Season
## 
### 
Although golf competition doesn't
reach its peak until the spring quar
ter, Stanford's varsity and freshman
team candidates have been working j
out under Coach Eddie Twiggs for I
eight weeks now, getting ready for i
another big season of golf. In recent
years golf and Stanford are becom
ing synonymous, so greatly have
Indian teams dominated Intercolle
giate competition for the past few
seasons.
Intramural and interclass play hold
I he spotlight during the autumn and I
winter quarters, respectively, but in
the spring big-time tournaments get
under way. The Stanford individual i
championship and long - driving j
championship are of main interest, j
together with varsity and freshman i
intercollegiate competition, and the I
Big Match with California.
Doering Top Man
Leading the list of varsity candi- !
dates, and in a class by himself, is 1
Art Doering, who recently won the
San Jose City title from a field com
; posed of the cream of Northern Cali
| fornia golfers. In that tournament I
! seven of Stanford's nine entrants!
qualified for the championship flight, j
and the finals became an all-Stanford '
i affair between Doering and Brown
Cannon, proving the potency of the
I Farm squad.
After eight rounds in the Ladder i
! Tournament for the first ten places j
\ on the team, Doering had a total of i
1 573 strokes, an average of less than :
one stroke over par for each round, '
which is good golf on any man's i
course. Doering, now only a junior,
j may be another Little, Seaver, or
Hawley, according to the railbirds.
Four Champs Return
Returning from last year's cham
pionship squad along with Doering
: are Brown Cannon, Alan Hyman and
Cal Manning, plus Bill Boyd, Dick
; Wright, Jack Showaltcr, Dave Mac- i
| Harg, Harris Flannery, Ed Minium, |
I Ren Sutton, and Chuck Russell from I

last year's strong frosh team.
This season's freshman squad has
not shown much promise as yet, Don
Haslett, former State Junior Cham
pion, and Hal Stone turning in the
only outstanding scores, but many
of the candidates played football this
quarter. They are expected to turn
out for golf next term and fans can
look forward to Eddie Twiggs' usual
strong Papoose divot diggers.
