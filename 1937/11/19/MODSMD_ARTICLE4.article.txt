IT was through the co-operation of the San Francisco
Chronicle, ace sport writer Bill Leiser, genius of the
rough-board Howard Brodie, and the Oakland Tribune that
this photo -section was made possible. To those parties go
our sincere "Thanks!"
And to Tommy Thompson, our own master of the line
cartoon, whose series has livened many a Daily page,
goes most appreciation. Thompson will be back next
Tuesday morning with his Injun and Steamroller and
the Big Game outcome.
