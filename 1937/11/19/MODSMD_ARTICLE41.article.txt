# Nine Needs Catcher For Good Season
## Wolter Sizes Up Card Diamond Year, Sees Strong Hurling Staff 
### 
"If we can come up with a good
catcher before the start of the base
ball season in February, we should
have a successful year," said Coach
Harry Wolter when he sized up
Cardinal chances in diamond compe
tition for the 1938 schedule.
"My pitchers look good," he addi d
in going over his material. "A lad by
the name of Lazzarone made a fine
reputation hurling for the Sacra
mento Junior College last year and
indications are that he will be even
stronger this year." Three other vet -
eran pitchers are back in the persons
of Spike Furman, Neil Rasmussen,
and Tom Killefer.
Furman Improving
Both Rasmussen and Furman were
just finding themselves at the end of
the season last year and should be
more consistent and effective during
the coming campaign. Killefer is a
polished ball player in any spot and
Coach Wolter has shown intentions
of possibly shifting him to first base.
There should not be much trouble
finding replacements for the gaps left
in the infield by the graduation of
Linde and Holman, who covered
third and first respectively last year.
Captain Farrell looks good to repeal
at short and Dick Tam will be back
at second.
Livcrmore at First
Sophomore John Livermore will be
fighting for the initial sack berth and
the third base job will be a toss-up
between several fast infielders in
cluding Reimer, McArthur, and
Shortridge. With two such fine
shortstops on hand as Shortridge and
Farrell, it may be that Coach Wolter
will shove Farrell over to the hot
corner and let Shortridge take over
his old job.
In the outfield Cofifis, DeWitt, and
LaFranchi, all of whom saw action
last year, will have plenty of trouble
holding first team posts with Norm
Juney, a sophomore, and several
other fine prospects still decidedly in
the running.
