# Tennis Hopes Pinned On New Players
## Braly, Underwood Sole Veterans Returning To Card Net Squad 
### 
When Stanford tennis enthusiasts
looked around this fall at what was
left of the 1937 net team, Captain
Bob Underwood and Bob Braly were
the only players still on the courts.
Helpful as these two stars were in
winning the Conference third-place
last year, they can hardly be ex
pected—men in the net-know seem
to think—to slash their way to an
other top Conference spot all by
themselves.
S.C. Should Be Strongest
Last year's championship Califor
nia aggregation was hit hard by grad
uation in the loss of Newton and
Bennett, but Bob Harman has come
up from the frosh and seems to be
headed for the number 1 spot on
the varsity.
Potentially Southern California
should be the strongest collegiate
team in the country in the coming
season. Louis Wetherall, National
Public Parks champion, and Joe
Hunt, National Junior title-holder
and member of the 1937 Davis Cup
Squad, will probably head the Tro
jan outfit. Other players who have
had considerable tournament experi
ence are Mort Ballagh, Laurence
Nelson, and Verne Hughes.
Few Veterans Left
Stanford can count on only Under
wood and Braly for sure positions
on its 1938 team. Among the nine
or ten other prospects for first team
berths are three men from last year's
frosh, Myrom Folsom, Dave Brock,
and Lloyd Gates.
At present Jim Seaver is up there
fighting for the number three post
against Bud Biorkman, Jack Laney,
Bob Colwell, and Ed Clarke. Art
Stoefen may end up on the first six,
when he is through with basketball.
