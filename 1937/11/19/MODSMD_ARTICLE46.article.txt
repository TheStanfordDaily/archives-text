# Three Top Tilts Tomorrow
## 89,000 To See Big Game 
### 
Even though a goodly portion of the nation's top teams are vacationing
this week for their Thanksgiving meals of tough battles, three of the big
Big Games of the season are on tap for Saturday's customers.
The climax of the conference season will be seen by the largest crowd
of the season—B9,ooo. But you know all about that game—.
Other two classics of the week are the Wisconsin-Minnesota and Ohio
State-Michigan battles. On the outcome of these games depends the final
standing of the Big Ten. +

Topping the heap with four
straight conference wins, Minnesota
will try to gain undisputed title to
the conference leadership by beating
Wisconsin at Minneapolis.
Big Ten Games
In second Big Ten spot with four
conference wins and one defeat, Ohio
State will pay Michigan a visit at
Ann Arbor. Should the Buckeyes
win and Minnesota lose, then the
title apparently will go to Ohio State.
However, there is the little matter of
a third conference game—lndiana

'and Purdue. If both Minnesota and
Ohio State lose, Indiana could tie
• the Gophers for the crown—lF the ,
Hoosiers down the Boilermakers.
Very complicated, indeed.
On the Coast, most conference
| teams wind up their schedules with
J this week's play. Washington's Hus- '
kies, the heroes of Razzberry Gulch,
| meet Oregon, and will show once
| again that their magnificent showing
i against Cal was no fluke.
O.S.C. Passes
Oregon State's aerial attack, led
by Joe Gray, will blast Washington
State all over the stadium. Montana,
nation's top scorers meets Idaho.
Kenny Washington & Co., represent
ing U.C.L.A., takes on Southern
Methodist.
This week's traveling representa- j
tive of the West is St. Mary's, who
every year enjoy a tour of the coun
try while en route to their annual I
battle with Fordham. The Rams, I
with only one tie to mar their rec
ord, will probably butt the Gaels
from here to there, but it's always
a good game.
Yale will try to clinch the big three !
title in its annual classic with Har-
I vard. Other stadia-packing games '
include: Notre Dame-Northwestern, ;
Pitt-Penn State, Dartmouth-Colum- !
bia, Baylor-Loyola, and Colorado-
Denver.
Pitt Is First
And the sum result of all these
J set-tos will be, perhaps, another
J change in the national grid stand
| ings. After last week's scores had
I been chalked up, Pitt moved even
farther ahead of Cal after replacing
the Bears in first spot the week be
fore.
Stanford, incidentally, moved from
nowhere—the Indians hadn't been
ranked all year—to thirteenth place.
The first fifteen teams, in order, fol
low:
Pittsburgh, California, Alabama,
Fordham, Yale, Santa Clara, Minne
sota, Louisiana State, Dartmouth,
j Villanova, Nebraska, Notre Dame,
j Stanford, Ploly Cross, Rice.
