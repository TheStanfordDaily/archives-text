# Picker's Apple Cart Upset By Stanford
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
It wasn't so long ago that the Nine
1 Old Men—all experts—stuck their
I collective neck out the window and
j prognosticated very definitey as to
; the final standings of the Pacific
; Coast Conference grid machines.
This week, nearly every team
| winds up its 1937 schedule. How
| did the pixem boys do?
The consensus at the beginning
j of the year was almost unanimous
I in its choice of Cal's Golden Bears
for top spot. Stub Allison's boys
were given 14 points. (In the sys-
Item u&L'd, the lowest number of
j points denotes the highest team.)
Huskies Second Then
Fighting it out for second place,
1 decidedly far in the rear of the
leader, were Washington and South
ern Cal. The Huskies' 22 points
[ just barely nosed out Troy with 23.
Fourth position went to Stanford
with a score of 35. The Indians had
;no argument for this spot. Filth,
j with 4(j points, came Oregon State
| The Beavers' standing was based
j mainly on the ability of Joe Gray,
termed by most of the coaching staff
I "Lhe best half on the Coast last year."
The remaining three posts were
! given to U.C.L.A. (53), Washington
State (64), and Oregon (69), in that
; order.

Now — how close did the seers
j come to calling 'em right?

Big Game Decides
The thing which will upset the
apple cart of those standings is the
Big Game. Owner of the Conference
crown will be decided then and
there. If Cal wins, it's theirs. If
Stanford wins, a tie for top spot is
the result.
