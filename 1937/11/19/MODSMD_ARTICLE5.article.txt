# The 						Camera Shutter Sees More than the Gridiron

AS the photo craze, candid and otherwise, sweeps the Farm,
there come, from millions of exposures, shots of art and fea
ture angles which deserve reproduction in this supplement.
A Daily candid cameraman scouting Berkeley for subjects one
Saturday afternoon caught this beauty at right of a California
rooter at the U.S.C. game. Further to the right is a tribute to the
lads and lassies whose handiwork turns the stadium into a giant
picture book between the halves.
Center is a striking night photograph by Gerald Coffman of
Stanford's new Memorial Hall which required use of three pounds
of flash powder.
Below are several reproductions of "art" shots which, despite
their non-football nature, are worthy of a spot in any Big Game
supplement. They represent the big game of Cameraman Burton
Stuart, a technician in the physics department.
