# Stanford Superstitions Spell Victory
## 
### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
Of course training and practice
plus athletic ability probably had
something to do with it, but it's a
bet that most people didn't know
that the real reason Stanford came
through in tour games oi seven
and tied one this year was because
(1) Tiny wore his good luck suit
and necktie, (2) Bill Paulman wore
a certtin grey shirt the morning of
the gamo, (3) Coach Lawson wore
Grant Stone's signet ring, and (4)
other people put charms on the In
dians and hoodooed the opponents.
Yes, the football players are su
perstitious, and the word should be
capitalized in regards to the coach
ing staff.
Tiny Has a Dream
At the beginning of the season,
before the Santa Clara game, Tiny
called a scrimmage. That morning
he appeared and announced that the
practice game was off. It seems that
Tiny dreamed his three best play
ers were injured in the scrimmage,
so he fooled the little spirits of
darkness and called off the play.
It is a common belief that a suit
of clothes worn on the day of a
"win" must be worn in each suc
cessive game or the team will have
bad luck. Especially familiar has
been Tiny's brown suit, red necktie,
and felt hat of the past four years
or so. But this year Tiny has been
experimenting, because the brown

| suit failed to come through at the
' Santa Clara game. Now the lucky
: suit is a g'ay one and a new multi
colored tie inspires the wins.
Pop Warner used to have dif
ferent good-luck ties for different
games. He had, among others, spe
cial cravats for U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
One-Shirt i'auhnan
The morning of the Washington
i game, Bill Paulman wore a certain
: grey shirt. The Washington gar"
i was won 13-7. For every game day
since, the same grey shirt has adorn
ed the Tarzanish shoulders of Paul
man.
Then there is Grant Stone's pet
superstition: Last year at the U. C.
L. A. game, Stone started in with
; his fraternity crest ling. Realizing
! it would be illegal to wear it in
I the game, he gave it to End-coach
j Jim Lawson. That 19-8 win started
j the little quirk that now occasions
i the ring transfer for every game.
Even Jumpin' Jeemy
The day of the U.C.L.A. game this
year, Miss Duprau, office manager
i of the 8.A.C., gave Jimmy Coflis a
I rabbit's foot which he put in his
! grid pants. Needless to say, the rab-
I bit's foot has been there every game
; since. Jimmy also wears the same
shoe laces ail the time. When they
I break he "ties 'em in knots."
Paulman and Ferko also carry
rabbits' feet, and Brigham wears
i football stockings. He and Hold

! ridge aro the only two men on the
squad who do this, the rest holding
; to the short socks.
It is rumored that Pete Fay
moons around for a telegram from
New York the day of a game. It is
| hard to say whether this is super
i stition or inspiration.
.Mrs. T. Stays Home
Then, alas for the life of a coach's
wife! Mrs. Thornhill does not go to
the games, believing she is a Jonah.
But there is always the radio, and
she never fails to make use of it.
So, all you friends of Stanford
who want to win the Big Game,
don't puzzle over standings or try
to check over game statistics. In
stead, wear your luckiest clothes,
carry your rablr 's foot, trade rings
j with someone, wi - your old shoe-
I laces, and leave you. wife at home,
I and we can't lose.
