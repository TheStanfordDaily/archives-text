It's the Big Splash today.
The Stanford water nolo squad meets the California ex-Wonder
Water Team today in Enema Pools. The Indian frosh and the Bear Cuhs
play a preliminary at 15 p.m. with the varsity skirmish set for 4 o'clock.
Roy Winklcman, ace Card diver, will do exhibition dives at the inter-

mission.
Nort Thornton's underdog wutcr
dogs have only the chance of knock
ing the Bears out of the conference
championship as a consolation.
However, a bit of slide rule mathe
matics might possibly ease the Cards
into a tie for the title. A victory for
the Cards today and another win
Tuesday in their second game at
Berkeley would put Stanford into a
four-way tie for the bunting, pro
vided U.S.C. should beat U.C.L.A.
twice down south.
Ucla, Bears Tied
U.C.L.A. and the Bears are tied
for the league top with one loss
against three wins. Stanford and
the Trojans rest below them with a
single victory apiece.
The game today might well be a
battle for all-Coast spots. Johnny
Lamb at forward will be trying to
outshine Cal's scoring ace, Ken
Wheeler. Stanford's best guard,
Sophomore Dick Hoover, has been
named to tag Wheeler.
Bill Hanna will start at sprint in
stead of guard and Bob Allen breaks
in at guard in Hanna's old position.
Captain Hanna should be hot in his
attempt to regain his All-Coast
mention of last year.
The Bears have at least four po
tential all-stars. Frank Graham,
sprint, was an All-American cen
terback in 1936. Paul Collins and
Bob Chitrin are Bear Coach Al
Dowden's choices for All-Coast con
ference guards.
Papooses Favorites
Stanford's Bill Burns and Cal's
Captain Jack Kent are both seeking
the league's goalie spot.
The Indian Papooses are slight
favorites over the Cubs through their
showing in their last three games.
The frosh began the season with
only one man, Ted Moreno, who
had played in high school.
Admission price is 25 cents with
student body card.
Probable Stanford starting line
ups follow:
Hanna (C) S Weeden
Lamb F Maurer
Rothschild F Nottage
Hatch C Moreno
Hoover G Tietzen
Allen G Jessup
Burns Gl Vitousek
