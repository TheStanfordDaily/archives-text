# Who'll Win? Cards Say Cards Will
## 
### 
Everyone makes predictions on
football games about who's going to
win and what the score is going to
be—everyone but the football play
ers.
But once a year the Daily gives
the football players a chance to do
a little predicting of their own. To
the question, '"Who's going to win the
Big Game?" The following players
answered:
PETE FAY—We are.
STAN ANDERSEN — Everybody
says Stanford. We can't lose.
"CAPTAIN GRANT STONE—Sure,
we're gonna win. But we hope it
doesn't rain.
JIMMY COFFIS—If Cal underes
timates our ability, we'll come
through with a surprise win. I sup
pose it'll be a surprise win—for them.
BILL WILLARD—It's not going
to be as close a game as Cal figures.
LEO FERKO—I'm not going to say
who's going to win. I don't like the
odds 2-1.
LOUIS TSOUTSOUVAS—I think
we will—l hope.
JAKE BRlGHAM—Stanford seems
to have had the breaks all season,
and Saturday's no different than any
other Saturdav.
GENE COLDIRON—I can't say. I
don't know.
JIM GROVES —we're going to win,
but it'll be a tough one.
BILL PAULMAN—If we play good
ball, I think we can win.
