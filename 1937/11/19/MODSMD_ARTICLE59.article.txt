# Card Booters Meet Bears In 'Crucial'
## Win for Indians Means Chance to Take Lead; Frosh Play Cal Cubs 
### JERRY HAWLEY 
One down and one to go. That's
the way Stanford's soccer team
I stands in its annual two-game series
with California on the eve of the
' second "Big Game" between these
' rival elevens.
; One down by virtue of California's
3-2 victory over the Indians last
i Saturday at Edward's Field, Berke
' ley. One to go because Stanford will
' get its chance of the 1937 season to
avenge that defeat tomorrow morn
ing at ten o'clock when it clashes
with the Bears on the Farm field be
fore the gridiron classic of the after
noon.
Cal Long Winners
Records of past California-Stan
! ford soccer series reveal that the
' outcome of tomorrow's encounter
! means even more to the Cardinals.
If they win, it will bring California's
| string of five consecutive victories
: over the Cards to an end. If they
| lose, it will be their sixth straight
loss to those Bears, and will mean
I another year before they can break
! that record, which at this stage might
j be termed a jinx.
Not since way back in 1934 has a
Farm soccer team been able to de
j feat California. In 1935 the two
teams tied for the California Inter
collegiate Conference Championship,
but Stanford lost both of its games
to the Bears that year. Both games
last year were won by one goal mar
gins, but California was on the long
end of the scores. The Bears made
it five straight last week, and aim at
making it six in a row tomorrow.
Bears Undefeated
This year California, undefeated,
has won five games and tied one.
Stanford, with one less game played,
has won three and lost two. Victory
for the Bears will put the Indians
out of the running, and leave Cali
fornia and S.F.U. to fight it out for
the title. If Stanford wins tomorrow,
and downs San Mateo and S.F.U. in
its next two games, it can take the
leadership away from the Bears, who
have only one more game this year.
