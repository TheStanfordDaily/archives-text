"pHYSICIST BURTON STUART, who captured the picture oi
I the library through oaks, the wharf slice-of-life, and the twc
upper pictures of glasses and glasses is an expert artist-photog
rapher. His shot of the hauser is so sharp you can almost gel
splinters off the end of the dock. And judges acclaim his "depth"

The upper left picture which turns the entrance of Stanforc
Library into a cathedral scene is by A. J. Carah.
All of these pictures are standouts in the Sigma Delta Ch
photographic contest.
