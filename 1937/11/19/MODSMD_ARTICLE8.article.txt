# Coaches See Card Chance Over Bears
## Predictions Make Tiny Gloomy, But Mentor Says 'Team at Best' 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Mentors of the Stanford varsity
ball club agree that the Big Red
Machine can win—and some predict
a Cardinal victory.
Head Coach Tiny Thornhill was a
hit discouraged when he heard pre
dictions of coaches, officials, and
newspapermen at the annual pre-Big
Game luncheon of the San Francisco
Ad Club last Wednesday. But Tiny
still thinks the Indians have a
chance.
"We're very much the underdog,
but there would be no use playing
if we couldn't win," the husky men
tor pointed out.
Physically Set
The king-pin of Stanford football
smoothed the slowly receding hair
beneath the baseball cap he has
worn to the practice field for years,
and concluded after yestei'day's
practice, "We're at our best physi
cally, and spirit is always at its
peak for the Big Game. The kids
want to win that ball game—whether
or not they are capable of winning
remains to be seen."
Bobby Grayson said, "I think we'll
win." And he should know. It was
only two years ago that he was Ail-
American captain and star of the
Vowing Sophs.
The Berkeley boys had a better
record than they have this year; they
had won nine straight games, and
entered the Stanford Stadium favor
ites by a large margin. But Grayson
and the boys turned the tables with
a 13-0 victory, and they went to
the Rose Bowl for the third con
secutive year.
Kicking Important
Now coaching live Card backfield,
Grayson promises, "If we outkick
them, we'll win—and I think we'll
outkick them." Bobby admits that
another problem will be to shake
Pete Fay loose to the open field,
where he can make great head
way.
Concerning the Bears, Grayson
points out, "They rely on power with
no deception, and I think we'll be
able to stop power maneuvers."
Ben Winkleman, line coach and
head scouting coach, has seen very
little of the Big Red Machine under
actual competition, but he knows
what is coming down from Berkeley
Saturday.
In his best southern drawl, Ben
says, "Allison's boys are tough, and
they can run and block In fact,
there is nothing in football that they
do not do well."
Winkleman admits, "We'll be
stronger than they anticipate, but
we'll have to play our best ball to
be strong enough to beat them."
Cals Improve—limit
Husky Hunt, coach of the Greys,
has seen Cal play three times this
season. He feels that "California has
a proven team, and should win. But
the Cal team reached its peak in the
U.S.C. game, and has been on the
down-grade ever since. Stanford
has not yet reached its peak, and is
going up to meet Cal going up."
Jim Lawson, who coaches the
Stanford ends, says, "We haven't
played our best game yet, and if we
play it Saturday, we'll win."
Trainer John Reisner, formerly a
Vowing Soph, spends every after
noon on the field with the boys, and
is well qualified to give their view
point. According to Reisner, "They
know they can win, and if they play
the ball they're capable of. they will.
1 hey would rather beat Cal than
anyone else."
