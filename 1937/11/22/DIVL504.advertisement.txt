EXPLANATION
In a misleading headline last
• week, "Legionnaires Red Bait
• ers—Kreps," The Daily implied
" that Theodore Kreps, econom
• ics professor, in a talk said that
• all Legionnaires are "red bait- •
• ers." <
Mr. Kreps wishes to "repudi
v ate emphatically that the Le- 1
• gion as a whole has any red
• baiting tendencies." He believes
• that those who were farthest '
• from the line might have some
• red-baiting tendencies, but that
• those who fought closest to the
• front have a definite desire
• for peace.
