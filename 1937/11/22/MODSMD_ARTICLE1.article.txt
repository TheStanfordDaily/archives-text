Roble holds the biggest collection
record of $107, and Lagunita is a
close second with $97 donated. The
few remaining living group repre
sentatives who have not turned in
their total contribution amounts
should see Roy Thompson sometime
today if they are going to do so.
With over $850 received in the
final wind-up of the Cardinal-spon
sored Red Cross drive, the commit
tee, headed by Jan North, general
chairman, and Roy Thompson, treas
urer, reports that the goal of the
campaign has been more than
reached.
Miss North says, in behalf of the
committee, "I wish to thank the
chairman, the individual collectors
from the various living groups, and
the student body as a whole for their
splendid co-operation in this drive.
"The fine spirit shown by every
one has made the campaign one of
the most successful in recent years."
