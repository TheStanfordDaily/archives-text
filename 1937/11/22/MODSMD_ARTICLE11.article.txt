# 'Associates' Choose Ditz As President
## Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, First Head of Body, Finishes Long Term 
### JIM STONE 
Starting the fifth year of its ex- |
istence, Stanford Associates last
Wednesday night elected George A.
Ditz, '11, president of the organiza
tion. Retiring president of the alum
ni is Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, orig
inator and leader of the Associates
for the past four years.
Other officers on the board of gov
ernors of the alumni body remain
the same and include: Edward D.
Lyman and Judge Kenneth Mackin
tosh, vice-presidents; Charles J.
Crary, treasurer; and 16 other mem
bers completing the governing body.
The position of secretary, vacated by
Harlow P. Rothert recently, has yet
to be filled.
Maintain Fund
Stanford Associates was conceived
by Dr. Reynolds four years ago, pi
loted by him to its present position.
Through his work the organization
was established, which is made up
of 250 alumni members scattered
throughout the United States. Basic
purpose was to make these alumni
conscious of their position on the
"Stanford family," make them feel
their obligations to the university.
Chief activity of the organization
has been the establishment and
maintenance of the Stanford Fund,
officially recognized as the principal
machine for increasing and replen
ishing the Stanford endowment.
Second Purpose
During the four years of the as
sociation's existence, this work has
been turned over to two commit
tees, that on special gifts, trusts and
bequests, and that of the comni .ttee
on annual appeal to the alumni. Both
committees are under the direction
of Paul H. Davis.
With this basic work past, the as
sociation will turn to the second
purpose, conceived in the original
plan by Dr. Reynolds. Not intend
ing to act as any sort of pressure
group, the association will seek
possibilities for improvement in the
Stanford set-up. It will attempt to
further thought and discussion on
problems arising in administration
or student policy, suggest possible
actions for improvement.
Change in Presidency
"The future program of Stanford
associates will be that of offering
sane and well thnug" t out guidance,
and of attempting to stimulate
thought on university problems,"
said Dr. Reynolds.
Change in presidency «vas not
caused by any dimension, i;ut sug
gested by Dr. Reynolds, who felt
that the leadership of the group
should be shifted from the earlier
graduating classes to the later ones.
The change was also suggested par
tially in view of the Associates' shift
of emphasis from fund-raising, to
broader advisory capacities.

tion. Retiring president of the alum
ni is Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, orig
inator and leader of the Associates
for the past four years.
Other officers on the board of gov
ernors of the alumni body remain
the same and include: Edward D.
Lyman and Judge Kenneth Mackin
tosh, vice-presidents; Charles J.
Crary, treasurer; and 16 other mem

Maintain Fund
Stanford Associates was conceived
by Dr. Reynolds four years ago, pi
loted by him to its present position.
Through his work the organization
was established, which is made up
of 250 alumni members scattered
throughout the United States. Basic
purpose was to make these alumni
conscious of their position on the
"Stanford family," make them feel
their obligations to the university.
Chief activity of the organization
has been the establishment and
maintenance of the Stanford Fund,
officially recognized as the principal
machine for increasing and replen
ishing the Stanford endowment.
Second Purpose
During the four years of the as
sociation's existence, this work has
been turned over to two commit
tees, that on special gifts, trusts and
bequests, and that of the comni .ttee
on annual appeal to the alumni. Both
committees are under the direction
of Paul H. Davis.
With this basic work past, the as
sociation will turn to the second
purpose, conceived in the original
plan by Dr. Reynolds. Not intend
ing to act as any sort of pressure
group, the association will seek
possibilities for improvement in the
Stanford set-up. It will attempt to
further thought and discussion on
problems arising in administration
or student policy, suggest possible
actions for improvement.
Change in Presidency
"The future program of Stanford
associates will be that of offering
sane and well thnug" t out guidance,
and of attempting to stimulate
thought on university problems,"
said Dr. Reynolds.
Change in presidency «vas not
caused by any dimension, i;ut sug
gested by Dr. Reynolds, who felt
that the leadership of the group
should be shifted from the earlier
graduating classes to the later ones.
The change was also suggested par
tially in view of the Associates' shift
of emphasis from fund-raising, to
broader advisory capacities.
