PALOMAR MOUNTAIN, Nov. 21
(UP). —The world's largest astron
omical mirror, being installed in the
California Institute of Technology's
observatory on this mountain top
near San. Diego, should help discover
new chemical elements which may
revolutionize industrial manufac
turing processes, observatory offi
cials declare.
Scientists supervising preparations
for installation of the mirror—a huge
200-inch disc—based their hope on
the fact that helium was discovered
by astronomers who used equip
ment inferior to that which will be
available here.
