# Alumni To Give Guidance Talks
## Recent Grads Will Tell About Job Hunting 
### 
Stanford's Vocational Guidance
Committee, sponsored by the Wom
en's Conference, has announced its
Alumni Lecture Program for Wed
nesday, December 1, in the Eucalipto
social room of Lagunita Court. Re
cent graduates will tell students the
ins and outs of job hunting.
Purpose of the committee is to
inform students of after-graduation
problems. There will be five to ten
speakers, none of whom has been
chosen as yet.
The talks will cover training re
ceived for the job, value of the
courses taken at Stanford, how the
position was attained, what the fu
ture may hold, living conditions, and
then the speakers will be glad to
answer any questions asked by the
students.
The talks should prove even more
popular than formerly, as last year
the speakers were alumni well es
tablished in the business world,
while this year they will be ones
known to the senior class. They will
cover the px-ocedure of establishing
a career rather than subjects of
less immediate importance. About
fifty are expected to attend.
Miss Yost will introduce the
speakers, while Gretchen Reine
mund is chairman.
