# 'Alchemist' Cast To Give Two Shows
## Stevens, Tate Prepare Play for New Little Theater Production 
### 
"The Alchemist," Ben Jonson's \
masterpiece of bawdy comedy, will
be presented tonight at 8 o'clock and
tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
in the Little Theater.
Although this satire is seldom pro
duced, it is regarded as one of the
finest Elizabethan plays. It tops all
its contemporaries for sheer Rabe
laisian humor and biting wit.
The plot concerns the activities
of three clever crooks who set up
shop as conjurers and workers of
magic and proceed to fleece unwary
victims who fall into their clutches.
Imitate Barnum
Subtle, fake alchemist and butler
who supplies his absent master's
house for headquarters for the
racket, and Dol Common, their not
too-virtuous accomplice, work suc
cessfully on the theory that "there's
one born every minute."
> However, Ben Jonson proves that
crime does not pay by having the
play end happily for everyone but
the crooks. The action is full of
old fashioned knock - down - and -
drag-out fun which is as pleasing to
modern audiences as it was when
"The Alchemist" was written.
Tate Directs Play
Richard Tate, graduate student of
drama, is directing the play. He was
reecntly seen as the fourth tempter
in "Murder in the Cathedral."

[ tor of the Department of Speech
i and Drama, is consultant on the
production.
It will be played without inter

victims who fall into their clutches.
Imitate Barnum
Subtle, fake alchemist and butler
who supplies his absent master's
house for headquarters for the
racket, and Dol Common, their not
too-virtuous accomplice, work suc
cessfully on the theory that "there's
one born every minute."
> However, Ben Jonson proves that
crime does not pay by having the
play end happily for everyone but
the crooks. The action is full of
old fashioned knock - down - and -
drag-out fun which is as pleasing to
modern audiences as it was when
"The Alchemist" was written.
