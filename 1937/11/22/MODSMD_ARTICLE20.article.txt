# Farm Motto Taken From German
## 
### LYNN ASHTON 
On a reading desk in the Wom
en's Clubhouse, there is an ancient
bronze seal of the University, iden
tical with the seal still in use, but
including the German phrase, "Die
Luft der Freheit weht."
This phrase, translated, is the
source of Stanford's "Winds of
Freedom" slogan. Its history is
closely related to the beliefs and the
life of Dr. David Starr Jordan.
The original words expressing this
thought were found to be written
by Ulrich von Hutten, in Latin, and
have reference to freedom of con
science, liberty to worship God in
accordance with one's own convic
tions and not under the dominance
of religious dogma or ecclesiastical
commandment.
Dr. Jordan published, in 1910. a

work on Ulrich von Hutten, and in
working with available material
found a translation from the Latin
into German, made by David Fried
rich Strauss.
Von Hutten's Latin had been a
statement; Strauss made it into a
question; and Dr. Jordan translated
it from reference to religious free
dom alone to intellectual freedom
and liberty. In English the German
phrase means "The breath of lib
erty is stirring" and from it has
come into being the present slogan,
"The winds of freedom blow."
Dr. Jordan applied the words to
intellectual liberty in every field as
the ideal of a great institution of
higher learning. The German phrase
on the seal was used until the
World War, when mass hysteria
made distasteful if not actually trea
sonable anything remotely German.
Its use was discontinued at that.

time.
Prior to the war, seal stationery,
shields and jewelry, showed the
words, "Die Luft der Freehit, weht."
It was never used on Stanford diplo
mas or any official documents is
sued by the University. However,
Dr. J. P. Mitchell has in his private
collection a paper showing the im
print of the seal with the German
phrase.
This seal has never been used in
connection with The Stanford Daily,
even during the years it was known
as The Daily Palo Alto. The Daily
has for many years can-ied the his
toric redwood tree on its masthead.
Further historical information
concerning this seal may be found
in the November 1937, issue of the
Stanford Illustrated Review. The

Dr. Jordan published, in 1910. a

work on Ulrich von Hutten, and in
working with available material
found a translation from the Latin
into German, made by David Fried
rich Strauss.
Von Hutten's Latin had been a
statement; Strauss made it into a
question; and Dr. Jordan translated
it from reference to religious free
dom alone to intellectual freedom
and liberty. In English the German
phrase means "The breath of lib
erty is stirring" and from it has
come into being the present slogan,
"The winds of freedom blow."
Dr. Jordan applied the words to
intellectual liberty in every field as
the ideal of a great institution of
higher learning. The German phrase
on the seal was used until the
World War, when mass hysteria
made distasteful if not actually trea
sonable anything remotely German.
Its use was discontinued at that.

Prior to the war, seal stationery,
shields and jewelry, showed the
words, "Die Luft der Freehit, weht."
It was never used on Stanford diplo

sued by the University. However,
Dr. J. P. Mitchell has in his private
collection a paper showing the im
print of the seal with the German
phrase.
This seal has never been used in
connection with The Stanford Daily,
even during the years it was known
as The Daily Palo Alto. The Daily
has for many years can-ied the his
toric redwood tree on its masthead.
Further historical information
concerning this seal may be found
in the November 1937, issue of the
Stanford Illustrated Review. The
article was written by B. Q. Morgan,
professor in the German depart
ment.
On a reading desk in the Wom
en's Clubhouse, there is an ancient
bronze seal of the University, iden
tical with the seal still in use, but
including the German phrase, "Die
Luft der Freheit weht."
This phrase, translated, is the
source of Stanford's "Winds of
Freedom" slogan. Its history is
closely related to the beliefs and the
life of Dr. David Starr Jordan.
The original words expressing this
thought were found to be written
by Ulrich von Hutten, in Latin, and
have reference to freedom of con
science, liberty to worship God in
accordance with one's own convic
tions and not under the dominance
of religious dogma or ecclesiastical
commandment.
