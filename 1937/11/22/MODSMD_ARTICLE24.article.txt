# Red Roller Stalls For Eight Minutes; Bears Win 13 to 0
## Card Gridders Bound for Columbia; To Work Out in Chicago 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Stanford camc out of the Big Game with no injuries, according to a
dispatch from Norris James, traveling East with the team —a team wearing
new red blazers with the white Stanford Seal. Bill Paulnvtn isn't feeling
his best, but he took a walk with the squad at Montello, Nevada. By West
has a badly cut face. But they're all ready for Columbia. They will work
out at Stagg Field, Chicago, tomorrow morning.

Tiny Thornhill's boys fought their hearts out Saturday, but Cal scored
13 points in eight terrific minutes and beat them. That seems like a long
time ago.
It wasn't quite a Wonder Team that Stub Allison brought across the
bay, but it was a very good team. Ask anyone who played against it
A Saturday.

In the second quarter it looked
more like a machine than a team.
When, after a quarter and a half of
even playing, Vic Bottari and those
other ten Cal men Stub Allison is
so proud of took the ball on their
own 18 and cracked seven times
through the Stanford line for 82
yards and 6 points, it looked like a
movie team making a touchdown.
There were just no mistakes.

Every Cal man except the ball
carrier neatly blocked out a Stanford
man. For six times the unblocked
man was able to bring the ball car
rier down. The seventh time it was
too late.
Clever Bucks
Cal's backfield men were clever,
fast, and hard-driving. Cal's line was
powerful and opened up hole after
hole for eight consecutive minutes.
Cal won.
Stanford's whole team was valiant.
They were playing the hardest game
of their season. But they lost. It
was an even game except for those
eight minutes. Even a valiant team
couldn't beat a machine.
Paulman Stars
Bill Paulman was easily Stan
ford's outstanding player. Not only
did he drive by sheer power for
much-needed yards at crucial times,
but his blocking and kicking were
wonderful, and his passing, con
sidering the wetness of the ball and
the lack of protection he got, was
good.
But Tony Calvelli was close to
him for top honors. It's not pleasant
to think what might have hap
pened Saturday if he hadn't been
stopping up the holes that Cal made
in the Indian line all afternoon.
Gene Coldiron played very nicc
football, .too, as did, well, the whole
darn team. And then there was
Pete Fay. But it's like pointing out
the Chapel to a visitor from lowa
to say that Fay looks good every
week.
But why talk about it? It's over
now, and on the way to being for
gotten. It's history. The team is
thinking about Columbia now. They
boarded the train for New York a
little over two hours after the Cal
game. They can't think back on the
Big Game. They're thinking about
| Columbia this week, and Cal next
! year. «
