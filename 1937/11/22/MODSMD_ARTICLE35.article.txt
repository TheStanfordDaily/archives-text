## INDIANS FAST RECOVERING ON EASTERN TRIP 
### 
Tiny's boys are fast recovering
from that Big Game pasting as they
wend their way eastward for the
third clash with Lou Little's Co
lumbia Lions in New York.
The Indians really made a scrap
of it all the way Saturday. In my
humble opinion, the Big Red Ma
chine outplayed the Bears in that
first quarter. The Farm gridders
were stopping Cal's tackle and
guard thrusts with great finesse, and
Card backs were picking up yard
age.
That second quarter was ruin
ous to Card hopes when the Bears
unleashed two terrific scoring
drives one after the other to put
the game on ice. That quarter was
the only period when Tiny's hoys
were really outclassed, and tht>n
the score should have only been
(>-<> instead of 13-0.
The Slani'ords never should have
elected to kick off after that first
Bear touchdown. The Californians
were hot at this point and the Cards
were playing right into their hands
by kicking the ball right back to
them. That second touchdown was
a result of the Bears' momentum
carried over from their first touch
down.
If Stanford had received, the In
dians could have fooled with the ball
until (he Bears' lust for scoring had
subsided.
The third and fourth quarters
were px-actically even-steven. Stan
ford made more of a race of it than
most of the sports writers are ad
mitting.
