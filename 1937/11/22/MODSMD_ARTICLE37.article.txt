# WASHINGTON PICKS ALL COAST GRID TEAM
## 
### 
The University of Washington grid
team picked an all-Coast first and
second team, which included just
one Stanford player — Pete Zagar,
tackle on the first team.
The Huskies named Sam Chap
man of Cal as the outstanding play
cr on the coast this season. Four
Bears and three Huskies were
chosen on the first team, and four
Bears and three Huskies were pick
ed on the second team. The north
erners, who were dumped by Stan
ford condescended to give one
Stanford player a place on the hon
orable mention list—Captain Grant
Stone.
Stanford's football entourage ar
rives in Chicago tomorrow morn
ing and the Indians will work out
oil the University of Chicago field
in the afternoon.
The 29 Indian gridders and coach
ing staff will arrive in Westchester,
New York, Wednesday.
The Stanfords will be heavy fa
vorites to trounce the Lions Satur
day in New York. Stanford was the
top choice against Lou Little's team
in the Rose Bowl, and was again
installed the favorites last year. The
Cards lost both of those games . . .
iriaybe the third time as a favorite
will prove to be a charm.
