# Stanford Soccermen Nose Out California 1-0
## Karl Schaupp Scores Lone Indian Coal Victory Inspires Farm Team Toward Soccer League Championship 
### 
It remained for Stanford's soccer
pieven to keep the California Bears
from completely monopolizing the
week-end sports program, the In
dians winning, 1-0.
Of the four sports, cross-country,
water polo, football and soccer in
which Stanford and California teams
competed, the Bears took the first
three, but the Indian booters pre
vented a total loss for Farm teams
by nosing out California's soccer
eleven, in a fast, hard - fought tilt
Saturday morning on the winner's
field.
Indians Open Fire
Stanford started at the opening
whistle storming the California de
fense and keeping the ball in Bear
territory during the entire first half.
Despite the mud-soaked condition of
the field, the Indians set a terrific
ally fast pace and kept it up for the
whole game, forcing the Bears to
call on every defensive tactic in the
bag to keep them from scoring.
The Cardinal forward line failed
to capitalize on several scoring op
portunities, but kept the ball in
California territory so often that the
Bears had only seven shots at the
Card goal during the first half, re
sulting in a scoreless period.
Bears Control Second
Conditions were the reverse dur
ing the second stanza. California
was the aggressive team. In the third
period, while the entire Bear eleven
was playing forward trying to get a
score, John de Benedetti, Indian
outside left, broke away with the
ball and dribbling down the sideline
half the length of the field, passed
it to center forward Karl Schaupp,
who unmolestedly fired the ball in
to the net for the winning point.
Using a fresh ilne-up in the last
quarter, California kept hammering
the Stanford goal, but a tired, de
termined Cardinal eleven, which had
substituted only two men during
the game, hurled back every effort
by the Californians to knot the
count.
The game marked the Berkeley
ites' first defeat of the season against
five victories and one tie. It also
brought to an end California's five
game winning streak over Stanford,
it being the first Card soccer win
over the Bears since 1934.
By winning Saturday the Farm
team went back into the race for
the California Intercolegiate Soccer
Conference crown. The Indians are
now one game back of the first
place Bears, and need to win their
next two encounters to edge out
the league leaders, who have only
one more game left this year.
