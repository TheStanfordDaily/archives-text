# Gaieties Music, Songs Okayed by Reviewer
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Blessed with music consistently better than that of previous Gaieties
in the last few years, and with several very clever skits, the Big Game
Gaieties of 1937 came and went on the stage of Memorial Hall last Friday
in much the same manner Big Game Gaieties have always come and
gone. Everyone wanted to have a good time, and everyone did.

Of the songs, "Maybe Someday,
by Jim Stone and Barbara Rosen
blatt, and the two Hoke Roberts-
J. P. Cahn compositions, "The
Things You'll Do for Love" and
"Love's the Thing" stood out.
Slightly less good, but still pleas
ing, were "Endless Rhapsody" by
Bob Forbes and Joy Grubbs, and
the Roberts - Cahn "Wonderful
flight."
'Fluctuatin Fanny' Spoiled
Larry Randall's "Fluctuatin' Fan
ny" was spoiled by a mediocre tune,
and by the orchestra's persistence in
drowning out. the composer's voice.
His "Change of Heart," written (
with Chet Johnson, was typical i
Gaieties fare, good but not distin
guished.
The Bob Ireland - Art Spaulding I
"Subway Serenade" smacked strong
ly of some other tune whose name
this reviewer cannot remember, and
Kit Cartwright's "Swinging in the
Mountains" suffered from its ar
rangement and also from a general
lack of inspiration.
'Twerpsichore' Good
Best skits included the satirical
"Twerpsichore," played to the hilt
by Larry Randall; "Now That Date";
the Supreme Court take-off, "What
Constitution," a difficult piece of
timing well done; the Kahn-Farmer
'Why Deny?" a clever idea and a
good cast; the completely and joy
fully insane "Crown the Thatch,"
which had something to do with
murder, but never once even at
tempted to make sense; and the two
pantomime pieces.
Bud Cady's "Merry Xmas," which
struck an answering chord in all
who have had their troubles with
electric razors, and "Stanford Tra
ditions," in which Ed Kerr and
Marco Thorne took the Farm for a
buggy-ride which reached a dizzy
and hilarious climax in the too, too
typical Union hasher episode.
Individual specialties included
Travis Windsor's tap-dancing, al
ways good; the Zooks' "Gad Zooks";
and the excellent piano-playing of
Bob Forbes and Tony De Grassi.
Adequate Acts
For the rest, they were adequate.
Both acts were marred by weak and
puzzling finales, the "Dale Carnegie"
skit was spoiled by too obvious use
of asides, and Walt Wickett's de
scripiton of the chemical composi
tion of Woman was too reminiscent
of last year's "The Kiss" to be as
good as it might have been.
On the whole, however, a good
I and very enjoyable show—and what
more fan one say for a Big Gamb

scripiton of the chemical composi
tion of Woman was too reminiscent
of last year's "The Kiss" to be as
good as it might have been.
On the whole, however, a good
I and very enjoyable show—and what
more fan one say for a Big Gamb
Gaieties?
Blessed with music consistently better than that of previous Gaieties
in the last few years, and with several very clever skits, the Big Game
Gaieties of 1937 came and went on the stage of Memorial Hall last Friday
in much the same manner Big Game Gaieties have always come and
gone. Everyone wanted to have a good time, and everyone did.

Of the songs, "Maybe Someday,
by Jim Stone and Barbara Rosen
blatt, and the two Hoke Roberts-
J. P. Cahn compositions, "The
Things You'll Do for Love" and
"Love's the Thing" stood out.
Slightly less good, but still pleas
ing, were "Endless Rhapsody" by
Bob Forbes and Joy Grubbs, and
the Roberts - Cahn "Wonderful
flight."
'Fluctuatin Fanny' Spoiled
Larry Randall's "Fluctuatin' Fan
ny" was spoiled by a mediocre tune,
and by the orchestra's persistence in
drowning out. the composer's voice.
His "Change of Heart," written (
with Chet Johnson, was typical i
Gaieties fare, good but not distin
guished.
The Bob Ireland - Art Spaulding I
"Subway Serenade" smacked strong
ly of some other tune whose name
this reviewer cannot remember, and
Kit Cartwright's "Swinging in the
Mountains" suffered from its ar
rangement and also from a general
lack of inspiration.
'Twerpsichore' Good
Best skits included the satirical
"Twerpsichore," played to the hilt
by Larry Randall; "Now That Date";
the Supreme Court take-off, "What
Constitution," a difficult piece of
timing well done; the Kahn-Farmer
'Why Deny?" a clever idea and a
good cast; the completely and joy
fully insane "Crown the Thatch,"
which had something to do with
murder, but never once even at
tempted to make sense; and the two
pantomime pieces.
Bud Cady's "Merry Xmas," which
struck an answering chord in all
who have had their troubles with
electric razors, and "Stanford Tra
ditions," in which Ed Kerr and
Marco Thorne took the Farm for a
buggy-ride which reached a dizzy
and hilarious climax in the too, too
typical Union hasher episode.
Individual specialties included
Travis Windsor's tap-dancing, al
ways good; the Zooks' "Gad Zooks";
and the excellent piano-playing of
Bob Forbes and Tony De Grassi.
Adequate Acts
For the rest, they were adequate.
Both acts were marred by weak and
puzzling finales, the "Dale Carnegie"
skit was spoiled by too obvious use
of asides, and Walt Wickett's de
scripiton of the chemical composi
tion of Woman was too reminiscent
of last year's "The Kiss" to be as
good as it might have been.
