# Coast, Big Ten Cross Final Yard Markers
## 
### 
And thus the 1937 football season's final yard stripe was crossed
by the teVas of the nation's two most potent conferencesâ€”Pacific Coast
and Big Ten.
Actually, however, the Coast ratings aren't quite final, but the only
spots that may change are the last three. The reorganization, it there is

one, will be caused by the U.S.C.-4
U.C.L.A. game in Los Angeles De- j
cember 4.
Final standings of Coast confer
ence teams:
W. L. T.
California 6 0 1
Stanford 4 2 1
Washington 3 2 2;
Oregon State 2 2 3
W. S. C 2 3 2
U. S. C 1 3 2 1
Oregon 2 5 0
U.C.L.A 1 4 1
W.S.C. Wins Upset
Coast teams which finished their
schedules this week-end included j
Washington tSate, whose terrific 7-0
upset win over Oregon State knock
ed the Beavers out of second place.
Washington's Huskies smashed out
a 14-0 victory over Oregon to gain
a first-division berth in the final rat
ings. U.C.L.A.'s early 13-0 lead
over S.M.U. was soon cut down by
the Mustangs for a 26-13 win in the
second meeting of the two teams.
Tossed out of the unbeaten and un
tied class was Montana by Idaho's
6-0 upset.
Intersectional game of the week
was the St. Mary's-Fordham clash.
Tremendously outclassed, the Gaels
played a beautiful defensive game,
but the Rams had far and away too
much for the weak coast eleven.
Fordham's 6-0 win doesn't tell of its
great power, and the three other
times it scored, only to have the
referee call them back.
Gophers Get Crown
Minnesota's 13-6 defeat of Wis
consin gave the Gophers sole pos
session of the Big Ten crown for
1937. The teams finished in this
order: Minnesota, Ohio State, In
diana, Northwestern, Michigan, Wis
consin, Purdue, Illinois, Chicago,

Stunning upset-of-the-week was
provided by Harvard's 13-6 triumph
over previously unbeaten Yale.
