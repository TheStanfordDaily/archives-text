# Indians Lose Water Game To Bears, 3-1
## Burns Stars in Battle Against Cal Varsity As Frosh Beat Cubs 
### 
The powerful California water
polo team submerged Stanford 3 to
1 Friday, but they might have in
flicted a much worse defeat were it
not for the excellent performance of
Card Goalie Bill Burns.
The Bears' brilliant shot-makers,
Ken Wheeler and Sharky Graham,
went into action in the second half
and bombarded Burns with an as
sortment of net shots. The shots
that became scores were almost im
possible to stop.
Guards Praised
Another solace in the defeat was
in the work of Stanford's guards,
Dick Hoover and Bill Hatch. They,
along with Bums, held the Wonder
Water Team to as few goals as any
team all season. Shiflds scored
twice and Wheeler once for the
Bears. Johnny Lamb was checked
closely all through the game but
managed to wriggle free on a set-up
from Harvey Rothschild to register
the single Cardinal goal. The score
was tied at one-all at the half.
Chief obstacle to Stanford scoring
was the guarding of Bob Chitrin and
Kelliher. The Indian forwards had
difficulty maneuvering and had very
few shots at the Bear net. Most of
the shots they got away landed in
front of the net.
Papooses Triumph
The steadily improving Indian
Papooses trounced the Cal Cubs 2
to 1 in a preliminary. The Papooses
had control of play throughout the
tilt, although they failed to score
until the last two minutes. Captain
Rix Mauer then sank two shots in
quick succession to put the game
away. It was the fourth victory in a
row for the frosh.
The varsity and freshman teams of
Stanford and California meet again
tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley in
the finals of the 1937 season.
