## Even When There's No Joy in Mudville 
### 
JUST in case you haven't heard, the University
of California at Berkeley slipped into the mud
Saturday and pulled out the Big Game and a
Rose Bowl bid, and Stanford went to Del Monte
and the City and places and pulled out various
forms of indisposition.
Now that each of the City papers has run its
12 stories with sidebars and art, the last "Hail
to California" has drifted off into the sunrise,
and the rationalistic philosopher has decided
that Stanford couldn't be expected to win any
way, and shucks we didn't really want to win
the old thing, there comes that time when
enough said is still not enough. So before the
Big Game's last picture is smeared and the

oiled are dithered and dried, let this be said:
Despite the fact that California failed to look
like a "wonder team," California did look 13
points better Saturday. The difference in score
was just about the difference in strength.
Stub Allison has a great ball club this year,
certainly the best on the Coast, perhaps the
finest in the country. It deserved to win the
Big Game. It got what it deserved.
In this publication we derive no great joy
from patting our Berkeley friends on the back,
but justice where justice is due goes even when
there is no joy in Mudville.
So we hand it to Stub and his ball club and
University which they represent.
Congrats, Cal!
