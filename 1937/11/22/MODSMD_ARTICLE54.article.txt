# Setting Your Own Pace
## 
### 
COLLEGES for many years have become in
incrcasingly like treadmills, geared at a
constant rate of speed. Entering students
stepped on the treadmill and accustomed them
selves to the pace though their potential speeds
may be higher or lower. Subject requirements,
required attendance at classes, arbitrary deci
sions that a survey of comparative governments,
for instance, should take exactly ten weeks, all
have been parts of the mill.
For most students college will probably re
main a treadmill. To get them off would mean
junking and rebuilding a system in which bil
lions of dollars have been invested. But lately
universities have been finding that the excep
tional student could be allowed to go his own
pace without too much trouble or expense.
Stanford's latest attempt to break the rhythm
for at least a few students is called University
Division. In it the student who knows what he
wants to do can go more directly to his goal,
eliminate the lost motion of fulfilling Bachelor
of Arts requirements.
At Stanford concern over exceptional stu
dents seems to be long standing. The Inde
pendent Study Plan inaugurated a few years
ago hit the problem from another angle.
The University seems to realize that it can
do little for the majority of the students except
raise or lower the tempo. But it also seems to

find that it can at least chip at the edges of the
problem, and at the same time make the major
ity smaller, by devising means to take excep
tional groups out of the mill.
Formation of University Division is a cheering
sign, not only because it is a definite chip at the
problem, but also because it seems to be a part
of a program. â€”L. L.
