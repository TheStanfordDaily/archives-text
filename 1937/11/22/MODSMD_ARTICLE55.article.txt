UETURNING alumni felt a pleasant little glow last
week-end when, they lound that Stanford was
still about the same as it was when they were here.
There are changes of course; but in put pose and
spirit the University hasn't altered much since the
time of the earthquake. It is still a school with a
comparatively small student body. It is still intended
primarily for undergraduate work.
But today's students wonder if this will be true
when we come back ten years from now. We hope
that it will; but there are plenty of prophets who
tell us that the undergraduate university is going
down for the third time, that it is as outdated as the
mustache cup. These seers point out that the junioi
college makes the first two years of university courses
unnecessary. They say that the best thing to do is to
extend the junior college system, abolish the first two
years' courses in universities, and concentrate on
graduate work.
* * * *
To those who believe in the unlimited extension of
public education this step would seem like a passport
to Utopia. And it does present a very inspiring pic
ture—our nation raising itself ever higher and higher
through better education of the masses. But there are
a few of us— diehards, reactionaries, and economic
royalists no doubt —who won't care to see little junior
educated that. way.
Our public school system will take some extensive
remodelling, and a lot of working over before it will
be able to include the first two years of college. The
junior colleges may be out to capture the university
trade; and they may be able to undersell competition.
But any junior college supported by public funds
will have to teach what the school board tells it to
teach. And school boards are noted for their curious
ideas. Until the junior colleges become self-support
ing, they cannot offer the intellectual independence
that the universities give.
* * * *
I NTELLECTUAL independence, of course, is an over
worked and abused term. By itself it has little
meaning. But the fact remains that the public schools
have to give a picture of the world that needs a
good deal of twisting to fit the facts.
The high schools present their students with a de
scription of life which would make the most contented
angel burn with unchristian envy. Life, it is true, is
not so bad, and only the deliberately cynical would
condemn (lie schools for looking on the bright side.
But we have to expect a lot 6f rough going, and
when the schools cover this up they hurt the student.
* * * *
The average high school student graduates feeling
that the world is a perfect place ,and that ho knows
everything knowable from atom to nebula. He has
been told that our system of government is prac
tically flawless, that our politicians are latter-day
saints. He has been given the impression that God
himself designed the economic system, and that com
munism is a worse word than hell.
Public schools teach this because pressure groups
demand it. Parents and patriotic organizations unite
in forcing the teachers to ignore the dirty side of the
world.
* * * *
Public junior colleges are under the thumb of
those pressure groups just as the high schools arc.
They can be forced to graduate their students with
much the same rosy outlook. And a student thus
trained is terribly handicapped when he meets reality.
Unless the public education system can teach what
the teachers believe, it will never be able to take
over college work. Universities are restrained enough
as it is. Any more limitations and we would have
no real education at all.
And so there are a few of us diehards who hope
that when we come back ten years from now Stanford
will till In ,iu under university.

as it is. Any more limitations and we would have
no real education at all.

UETURNING alumni felt a pleasant little glow last
week-end when, they lound that Stanford was
still about the same as it was when they were here.
There are changes of course; but in put pose and
spirit the University hasn't altered much since the
time of the earthquake. It is still a school with a
comparatively small student body. It is still intended
primarily for undergraduate work.
But today's students wonder if this will be true
when we come back ten years from now. We hope
that it will; but there are plenty of prophets who
tell us that the undergraduate university is going
down for the third time, that it is as outdated as the
mustache cup. These seers point out that the junioi
college makes the first two years of university courses
unnecessary. They say that the best thing to do is to
extend the junior college system, abolish the first two
years' courses in universities, and concentrate on
graduate work.

To those who believe in the unlimited extension of
public education this step would seem like a passport
to Utopia. And it does present a very inspiring pic
ture—our nation raising itself ever higher and higher
through better education of the masses. But there are
a few of us— diehards, reactionaries, and economic
royalists no doubt —who won't care to see little junior
educated that. way.
Our public school system will take some extensive
remodelling, and a lot of working over before it will
be able to include the first two years of college. The
junior colleges may be out to capture the university
trade; and they may be able to undersell competition.
But any junior college supported by public funds
will have to teach what the school board tells it to
teach. And school boards are noted for their curious
ideas. Until the junior colleges become self-support
ing, they cannot offer the intellectual independence
that the universities give.
* * * *
I NTELLECTUAL independence, of course, is an over
worked and abused term. By itself it has little
meaning. But the fact remains that the public schools
have to give a picture of the world that needs a
good deal of twisting to fit the facts.
The high schools present their students with a de
scription of life which would make the most contented
angel burn with unchristian envy. Life, it is true, is
not so bad, and only the deliberately cynical would
condemn (lie schools for looking on the bright side.
But we have to expect a lot 6f rough going, and
when the schools cover this up they hurt the student.

The average high school student graduates feeling
that the world is a perfect place ,and that ho knows
everything knowable from atom to nebula. He has
been told that our system of government is prac
tically flawless, that our politicians are latter-day
saints. He has been given the impression that God
himself designed the economic system, and that com
munism is a worse word than hell.
Public schools teach this because pressure groups
demand it. Parents and patriotic organizations unite
in forcing the teachers to ignore the dirty side of the
world.
* * * *
Public junior colleges are under the thumb of
those pressure groups just as the high schools arc.
They can be forced to graduate their students with
much the same rosy outlook. And a student thus
trained is terribly handicapped when he meets reality.
Unless the public education system can teach what
the teachers believe, it will never be able to take
over college work. Universities are restrained enough
