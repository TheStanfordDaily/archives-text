44f IVE 'em a cold bullet. Give 'em a cold bullet.
They got cold sheets. Give 'em a cold bullet
right in the guts."
That didn't make much sense. Neither did the big
Negro, one eye out of place, good eye looking off in a
vacant stare as he mumbled to himself, voice rising
almost to a scream to "give 'em the cold bullet." Face
muscles twitching, hands clenching, then gripping hard
on the rail of the steps, the voice broke into another
roaring tirade. We could stand no more and went
into the Recreation Center.
A blue-eyed, neat appearing man came up as we
closed the door behind us. "Hello. We're going to
have a dance tonight. We had a dance last night and
the night before. We're going to have a dance to
morrow night too."
He glanced out the window. "Don't you pay any
attention to that damn nigger. He's crazy, but we
have some swell dances here. They don't let girls
under 17 in" ... a childish giggle . . . "but we're
going to have a dance tonight."
Two husky, white-uniformed young men came by.
One of them was supporting a man, half carrying,
half leading him as a child. His was a beautiful body,
small hips, wide shoulders, six feet of solid meat and
bone. But he couldn't use it. "Come, Jim," said the
orderly softly, and Big Jim, who used to be a football
player, shuffled off, moving his buckling knees six
inches at a time.
We were at the Perry Point, Maryland, Veterans'
Hospital.
These men were all heroes in the War. Many of
them don't recall the blowing of the first Armistice
Day bugle. Neither do many of their fellow heroes
who died in action. They rotted in the trenches and
the rats devoured their carcasses. But at Perry Point
they don't have that luck. They'll keep on rotting
inside for many years.
And if there's another war there will be others
to keep them company.
