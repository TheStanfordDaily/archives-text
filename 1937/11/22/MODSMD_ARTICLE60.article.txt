# Garbo Miscast As Story Fails To Use Talent
## 
### 
One unhappy characteristic seems
to dog the footsteps of the screen's
leading actress, and in "Conquest,"
now playing at the Stanford The
ater, it becomes embarrassingly ob
vious.
Miss Garbo does not have very
intelligent employers; and while she

may have the best
of support ing
casts — casts
which may in
clude, as in this
instance, the ex
cellent Mr. Boyer
— the stories she
is called upon to
enact rarely
seem to measure
up to her talents.
Occ a s i o nally a
"Camille" comes
along, and Miss
Garbo is magnifi-

cent; but unfortunately the '"Con
quests" come for oftener than the
"Camilles."
Gar bo Fascinating
Within the narrow bounds of her
part as Marie Walewska, Napo
leon's Polish mistress, Miss Garbo is,
as always, highly intelligent and
constantly fascinating. The fact that
she is called upon to do little but
make impassioned speeches and be
unhappy, however, throws the chief
interest of the picture to Mr. Boy
er's Napoleon, a characterization
which by its very nature would in
evitably dominate any film which
happened to include it.
As the old Countess, Maria Ous
pensaya heads a supporting cast
which includes such worthies as
Reginald Owen as Talleyrand and
Henry Stephenson as Count Walew
ska.
Scenes Stand Out
Her card game with Napoleon
rates with the scene in which Napo
leon tells Marie his plans for a
united Europe as one of the high
lights of an otherwise dull and over
lengthy film.
M-G-M, the papers all inform us,
spent three million dollars on "Con
quest." Whether they will get it
all back seems doubtful.
It is to be hoped that the next time
they come to consider a vehicle for
JVliss Garbo, they will concentrate on
something worthy of her, and will
not waste a superb cast on the sort
of mildly entertaining spectacle
"Conquest" has turned out to be.

of support ing
casts — casts
which may in
clude, as in this
instance, the ex
cellent Mr. Boyer
— the stories she
is called upon to
enact rarely
seem to measure
up to her talents.
Occ a s i o nally a
"Camille" comes
along, and Miss
Garbo is magnifi-

cent; but unfortunately the '"Con
quests" come for oftener than the
"Camilles."
Gar bo Fascinating
Within the narrow bounds of her
part as Marie Walewska, Napo
leon's Polish mistress, Miss Garbo is,
as always, highly intelligent and
constantly fascinating. The fact that
she is called upon to do little but
make impassioned speeches and be
unhappy, however, throws the chief
interest of the picture to Mr. Boy
er's Napoleon, a characterization
which by its very nature would in
evitably dominate any film which
happened to include it.
As the old Countess, Maria Ous
pensaya heads a supporting cast
which includes such worthies as
Reginald Owen as Talleyrand and
Henry Stephenson as Count Walew
ska.
Scenes Stand Out
Her card game with Napoleon
rates with the scene in which Napo
leon tells Marie his plans for a
united Europe as one of the high
lights of an otherwise dull and over
lengthy film.
M-G-M, the papers all inform us,
spent three million dollars on "Con
quest." Whether they will get it
all back seems doubtful.
It is to be hoped that the next time
they come to consider a vehicle for
JVliss Garbo, they will concentrate on
something worthy of her, and will
not waste a superb cast on the sort
of mildly entertaining spectacle
"Conquest" has turned out to be.
