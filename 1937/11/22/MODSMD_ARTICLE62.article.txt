# CAMPUS OPINION
## ON 'STOMPIN' AROUND' 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations to Hartmann on
his current edition of the Chappie
and the loudest bird that I am ca
pable of giving for the record col
umn.
Why doesn't Hartmann admit
publicly instead of privately that the
last "Stompin' Around" contained
technical errors, and then take steps
to stop such an incident being
repeated? As it is, this last one will
be in greater disfavor than the first
one.
"Sing, Sing, Sing"
Says the commentator (?) in ref
erence to Goodman's version of
"Sing, Sing, Sing": "Every two twists
of the disk the band runs out of
ideas so Krupa frantically whacks
the skins with a thumpety-thump
bolero beat until they can think of
something else to do, the result be
ing swing monotony."
Fie! Fie! on thee, Mr. Small. Bo
lero beat, eh? Just for fun I'd like
you or anyone else to show me the
bolero beat in that record. Just to
make certain I called up Shirley
Jones and Tom Siebert (both with
mighty fine record collections, I
might add), and had them tell me
that there wasn't any bolero in it.
"Then He Lied"
Such a fundamental mistake
ought to disbar anyone from read
ing further. Upon asking a Chappie
contributor what he thought of
someone writing untrue statements,
he unhesitatingly replied, "Well,
then he lied."
As for "Sing, Sing, Sing" being a
lemon, I find the idea so ludicrous
that I will be able to laugh about it
even if Stanford loses in the East.
The facts arc these: Goodman has
turned out one of the most
strikingly original compositions that
I have ever heard. For sheer ar
tistry in attack and improvisation,
the choruses of Vido Musso on tenor,
Harry James on trumpet, and Benny
on the clarinet (all of these are on
part two) should give them places in
the very top rank of their profession.
The arrangement is as carefully
worked out as any architect's plans.

Krupa knew exactly when to change
the type of rhythm and it is his
marvelous sense of time that en
ables the swing men to take off into
their choruses. Other commentators
have used the expression "out of the
world" to tell how they felt about
those choruses, and 1 feel the same
way about it.
PnyolT
And the payot is that he can't
even get the name of the Casa Loma
drummer spelled right.
To an unprejudiced observer, re
gardless of what Hartmann or any
one else thinks about sour gripes, it
is my opinion that the standard set
in "Stompin' Around" too closely
follows the name of its author to
have any value. And what a big
laugh it is going to give the eastern
cats, who really know what swing is,
when they read it.
P. M. et al.
