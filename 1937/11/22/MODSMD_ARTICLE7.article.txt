# Funny Frosh Faints; Fools Frantic 'Fems'

Stumbling through the corridors
of Roble Saturday night, a sobbing
figure, her velvet wrap trailing on
the floor, was a pathetic sight to the
little crowds of Robleites who gath
ered curiously and asked questions.
"Yes, isn't it a shame?" said her
companion, who supported her as
she leaned brokenly against the
wall. "She isn't a Roble girl. One of
the other guests is a friend of hers
but she can't remember the girl's
name or her own name. Her escort
got tight and she had to walk home.
I found her on the steps crying iust
as she is now."
At 11:30 a wild scream and shirts
of "she's fainted!" brought girls to
the corridor. There lay the mystery
woman draped on the steps.
Suddenly the girl sat up, normal
but laughing wildly. Seeing her face
for the first time, Rr bleites saw she
was not a visiting girl, no an amne
siac, not a deserted date, but merely
a freshman.
"We wanted to enliven Big Game
night," she and her companion ex
plained.
