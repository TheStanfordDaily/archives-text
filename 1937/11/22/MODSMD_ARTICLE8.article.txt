# Trueblood Speaks On False Views

### 
Preesnting the view of anthropo -
morphism as one of the most tenable
J conclusions of religion despite the
| present tendency toward its refuta
; tion, Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, uni
! versity chaplain, yesterday preached
! (he sermon for Sunday services in
! Memorial Chapel.
Dr. Trueblood reasoned that God
must be thought of as a personal
â–  ity, rather than as the manifesta
| tion of abstract law, since the qual
ities of personality are present in
[ most religious concepts and writings
: of the past concerning God. He also
pointed out that qualities of person
| ality beside human form, must be
i ascribed to God in any acceptable
conclusions.
"There is little difference between
the modern view of those who be
lieve in God as a mere abstract
1 form and the view of atheism," he
I charged, "and this modem conclu
i sion can only lead to the next log
! ical view that He is inferior to the
being of His creation."
