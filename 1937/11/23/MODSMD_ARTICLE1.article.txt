# Senate Crop Bill Falters On Finances
## Farmer Proposal Stops Filibuster as House Still Does Nothing 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (UP).â€”A
patch-work crop control bill minus
the financing provisions which
President Rosevelt insisted upon,
was introduced in the filibuster
torn Senate today while the House,
still with nothing to do, floundered
in a sea of oratory.
The bill, only major measure to
come before either house since the
special session convened eight days
ago, is designed to protect the
farmer's income and insure the
public against exorbitant prices. It
will be brought to the floor for de
bate tomorrow, replacing the Wag
ner-Van Nuys anti-lynching bill
which has kept the Senate deadlock
ed and menaced the President's
four-point legislative program.
Financing Problem
Chairman Marvin Jones, D., Tex.,
of the House agriculture committee,
said hsi group would have a bill
ready "probably this week." Thus
far this group also has failed to pro
vide means of financing the pro
gram despite Mr. Roosevelt's warn
ing to both houses that failure to
do so would upset his budget-bal
ancing plans.
The Senate bill, a hodge-podge of
ideas from congressional leaders and
farm organizations, contains soil
conservation, ever-normal granary,
parit ypayment and crop control
features. It will cost from $100,000,-
000 to 0275,000.000 more than the
present soil conservation pi'ogram
and it was this that caused Mr.
Roosevelt to insist on self-liquidating
features.
Rejects Processing Tax
The Senate agriculture committee
reported the measure unanimously.
Sharp disagreements arose over
costs. Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley believed the program would
not cost more than the soil-conser
vation measure but Department of
Agriculture experts said it might
run $275,000,000 higher.
The bill carries a "blank check'
authorization" for financing under
whihe the Secretary of Agriculture
would estimate the cost for the bud
get bureau, which would then ad
vise Congress. The latter would
have to find some means of raising
the necessary revenue. The House
already has tentatively rejected the
processing taxes method.
To Hasten Program
Vice-President John N. Garner,
Barkley, Speaker William B. Bank
head, D, Ala., and House Majority
Leader Sam Raybum, D., Texas,
held a bedroom conference with
President Roosevelt at the White
House and agreed to "hasten along"
the legislative program.
