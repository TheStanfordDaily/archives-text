# Quad Starts New Candid Pix Contest
## Yearbook Will Present Typical Pictures Of Farm Social Events 
### 
Another effort to make Stanford's
a "candid campus" was launched
last night when the Quad, the
Farm's yearbook, announced a four
months-long "Stories in Pictures"
contest.
Designed to help the Quad cover
a wide variety of social and athletic
events, the contest hopes "to make
every Stanford student with a cam
era a member of our photographic
staff," George McKenna, yearbook
editor, explained.
Series Wanted
What the Quad wants, he said, are
series of from 10 to 15 pictures
covering each important event "from
every angle." He seeks especially
series illustx-ating Stanford week
ends â€”"house parties, private get
togethers, dances, and games." Cam
pus shots and candids of faculty
members will also be accepted.
The Quad's contest, it was point
ed out, will not compete with the
already-announced Sigma Delta
Chi "Competition in Photography"
which ends a week from tomorrow.
Though in addition to pictorial
and news-and-action shots, Sigma
Delta Chi seeks "Life' Mike series,
its stories-in-pictures division is
open only to three-to-five-photo se
ries, does not look for "complete"
coverage of events.
Entries To Be Shown
All entries in the Sigma Delta Chi
contest will be hung in the Nitery
the first week in December. Thirty
dollars in cash and merchandise will
then be awarded to the best photo
graphs. Entry blanks are available
either from the journalism secretary
in the Press Building, or from David
Keeble's in Palo Alto.
Beginning this morning, the Quad
will fill the trophy case in the Cel
lar with illustrations of the type of
photographs it wants. First displays,
taken by the yearbook's present
cameramen, will be followed by out
standing series entered in the Quad
contest.
Published in Spring
The series judged best by Quad
editors will be published in the 1938
yearbook next spring. Entries,
which should be mailed to McKen
na at Box 100 as four-by-five-inch
prints, will become the Quad's
property, won't be returned.
Entrant's name, address, and
phone number must be written on
the back of each print, and nega
tives should be available for later
enlargements. Identification of per
sons, occasions, and scenes must also
be included.
