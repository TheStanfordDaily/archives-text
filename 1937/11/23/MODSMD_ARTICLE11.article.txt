# Thomas Attacks Highway Project
## 
### 
Explaining principles involved in
a highway construction plan being
proposed in several states, Earl C.
Thomas, Stanford professor of civil
engineering, weighed its merits in a
radio talk over KGO last night.
The project is designed to accom
modate safely fast-traveling ve
hicles and slow-driving heavy
trucks, by a multi-lane system,
Professor Thomas said. The engi
neer pointed out that the system is
embodied to some extent in the San
Francisco bay bridge.
Professor Thomas attacked the
plan, not as being ineffective for
safety purposes, but as too expensive
to be adopted on a wide enough
scale.
