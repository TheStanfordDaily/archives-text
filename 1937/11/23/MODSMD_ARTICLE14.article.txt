# Cast Hilarious In Burlesque Of 'Alchemist'
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
When Dan Holtom's wig accident
ally toppled off during the first
scene scuffle of Ben Jonson's "The
Alchemist," staged last night in the
Little Theater, Holtom ad-libbed
through what might have put the
whole show on its ear, and the au
dience set itself for a roaring bur
lesque.
That most of the laughs in the eve
ning were off the record and had
nothing to do with the play, only
upped its comic value. As it is, "The
Aclhemist" allows for a certain
amount of horse-play as a satire on
the seventeenth century quack sci
entist. But Ben Jonson did not
reckon with a Bob Ireland, who
should sneak a glance to count the
house between delivering his lines
with a Brooklyn accent. It was not
in the script for Adrian Sherman, as
the sour-faced Surly, to read his
lines like a rough stewing about not
being able to get a book in the re
serve room. Nor did Jonson angle
for laughs by having his main char
acter's wig drop off on the slightest
provocation.
But considering that the theme of
"The Alchemist" is not exactly vital,
and the fact that long-winded, sev
enteenth century dialogue can be so
soggy academic backwash in the
twentieth, Monday's colossal mal
interpretation was all for the best.
It was hilariously and inartistically
funny.
Worthy of mention for acting hon
ors, as far as legitimate straight
portrayal is concerned, â€¢ are J. P.
Cahn, Ralph Parr, and Janet Dole.
But even the right interpretation
of the roles is hai;d to single out in
view of the fact that even Cahn was
infected with the spirit of the eve
ning and read one line like a
Broadway wisecrack.
