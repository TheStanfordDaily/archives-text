## Intensive Attacks May Force Early Truce 
### 
SHANGHAI, Tuesday, Nov. 23
(UP). â€”Japan brought her peace of
fensive into the open today but si- |
multaneously redoubled her military 1
attacks on Chinese armies in the i
Yangtse Valley in an effort to hasten j
a break in Generalissimo Chiang j
Kai-Shek's all-China anti-Japanese j
front which might make possible an j
early truce.
A Japanese spokesman revealed j
that the first Japanese airplane j
which had flown over Nanking since
the Chinese government began to j
abandon its central capital dropped |
a letter at 2 p.m. yesterday ad
dressed to the Chinese generalis- 1
simo urging him to surrender.
The plane dropped no bombs but '
it was followed by others which
backed Japanese "suggestion" with j
a roar of explosives and machine j
gun fire on Chinese reinforcements
mai'ching toward the battle front |
west of Shanghai.
Anti-British sentiment still ran I
high in Tokyo, where the bulk of
the Japanese people believe that
Britain is giving all the assistance to
China that she qan, thus "prolong
ing the war." More than 4000 per
sons attended a mass meeting ar- ;
ranged by patriotic societies to I
urge "stronger" measures against
Britain. Speakers denounced Brit
ain for "conducting a world-wide
propaganda campaign against Japan."
