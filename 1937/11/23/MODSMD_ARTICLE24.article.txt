# Concert Artist Dances Tonight
## Von Goodmon Will Give Memorial Hall Recital 
### 
Von Goodmon, noted young Amer
ican dance artist, will appear in a
solo concert in Memorial Hall to
night at 7:30 o'clock for the Tues
day Evening Series, under the aus
pices of the Committee on Public
Exercises.
Excerpts from the program include
dances representing Spain, the
American Indian, Japan, Mexico,
Russia, and the Zapotecan race.
The dance, Lotus Land, which
Goodmon will present tonight, de
picts the spirit of the whole orient
rather than of one particular coun
try. The Mayan number, Guaca
maya de Fuego, will show the leg
endary sunbird which brings the
colors of the rainbow and the rays
of the sun to the earth. The final
number, Caucasian Lesginka, is an
authentic dance of the Russian
Steppes.
Gladys Steele, who appeared here
with John Teel early in October,
will accompany Goodmon on the
piano. During intermissions, Miss
Steele will give several selections of
her own choice. There is no admis
sion charge.
