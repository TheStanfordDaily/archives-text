# Big Game Rioters At Cal Fined $200
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 22 (UP).â€”Two
University of California students
and one non-student, the first group
of 21 defendants to appear in con
nection with Friday night's football
rally riot, today were given the al
ternative of a $200 fine each or a
100-day jail sentence.
Judge Oliver Youngs accompanied
each sentence with a verbal repri
mand to both students and non-stu
dents "for casting a reflection on the
name of the university."
The plea of one student that he be
allowed to work out his fine for the
city was refused. Three others, one
of whom was a university student,
pleaded not guilty. Their cases will
be heard separately. Others will be
brought before Judge Youngs later.
Seven persons were hurt and
$10,000 property damage was in
flicted in riots preceding the Cali
fornia-Stanford football game.
