STRASSBOURG, France, Nov. 22
(UP). â€”Six supposed spies, led by
a German, were arrested tonight
near France's famous $4,000,000.-
000 Maginot line of frontier defenses
as Minister of War Edouard Dala
dier watched a military review
nearby.
The six, seized near the Alsatian
Franco-German border, were placed
in the Besancon military prison. The
leader was identified by the name
of Dengler, a German.
While the prisoners were being
escorted from Mulhouse to the mil
itary prison, Daladier, accompanied
by Chief of the General StafT Marie
Gustave Gamelin, presided at a cere
mony here commemorating the 19th
anniversary of the entry of French
troops into Strassbourg after the
world war.
The ceremony inaugurated Dala
dier's inspection of the Maginot
line, supposedly for the purpose of
ordering reinforcements of key
points.
