# Hawaiian Coach Reports Stanford Has Cancelled Holiday Football Contests
## University Athletic Officials Describe Announcement as Surprise 
### ART STOKES 
Otto Klum, football coach at the University of Hawaii, last night an
nounced Stanford had canceled two proposed football games with island
teams—and Stanford athletic officials promptly responded that they knew
nothing of the report.
The United Press quoted Klum as saying he had received a wire from
Alfred R. Masters, graduate manager, canceling the games, scheduled for

• Christmas Day and New Year's Day,
because of changes in boat sailings.
One Week Delay
The wire service said the sailing
date of the President Garfield, on
which the team was to make the trip,
had been advanced one week, which
would mean the squad would be
absent almost a month.
Masters, contacted in New York
City, had nothing to say about the
report, according to the United Press,
but asked who was carrying it.
Apparently Klum's message would
confirm the sailing report, since he
said it revealed it would be impos
sible for the Stanford squad to ar
rive before December 29, and in or
der to play two games it would have
to remain until January 7, which
would be too late for scholastic rea
sons.
Robinson Uninformed
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, acting
president of the University while
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur is in the
East, said he had no information re
garding the report and did not know
who would make the decision.
J. Wesley Howell, newly elected
president of the Board of Athletic
Control, contacted in San Francisco,
declared the report "is a surprise to
me," and added he was sure A1 Mas
ters, graduate manager, would have
informed someone in the University
if the trip were called off.
William Brownlee Owens, faculty
athletic representative, also indicated
he knew nothing of a cancellation.
Game Date Changed
He said, however, the date of the
first game had been changed and
that Klum might have mistaken that
for a cancellation. Because the
squad, under the sailing plans, would
arrive on Christmas morning, the
game was changed to December 27.
Both J. Pearce Mitchell, treasurer,
and Dr. Thomas A. Storey, executive
officer of the 8.A.C., said th£y had
not been informed of cancellation of
the trip. Nor had Jacob Irwin, man
ager of operations for the 8.A.C.,
heard of the report.
Meanwhile, Hawaiian football
committees were reported consider
ing inviting the University of Wash
ington or the University of Denver
to Honolulu for the holiday contests.
Washington officials were under
stood to be planning to meet today to
discuss the tentative invitation.
