# Stock Market Drop Is Lowest In Two Years
## Clerks Work Feverishly Checking Results In Last – minute Break 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 22 (UP).—Wall
Street's margin clerks worked fev
erishly tonight checking their ac
counts following a new break in the
stock market which carried prices
down 1 to 9 points to the lowest lev
els in about two and a half years.
A last minute break in stocks
plunged the main list to new lows
after an abortive rally dislodged
fresh offerings.
Averages Drop
All the Dow-Jones averages, ex
cept utilities, fell to new bottoms
since mid-1935. The closing indus
trial average was down 6.26 points
to 114.19; rail, off 1.51 to 29.55; util
ity, off 0.69 to 21.16; and composite
down 1.98 to 39.12.
The break which embraced all sec
tions of the list, particularly U. S.
Steel common, Chrysler Motors and
Sears Roebuck, came when hopes
of the dwindling bull fraternity that
the market would resist pressure at
the previous lows were shattered.
Reports Bearish
The day's budget of news, prepon
derantly bearish, included:
1. The tenth consecutive weekly
decline in the steel operating rate to
a new low since 1934.
2. An increase in business failures
to the highest level since mid-1936.
3. A sharp break on the London
Stock Exchange, especially in trans-
Atlantics on forced selling attrib
uted to a syndicate formed only six
weeks ago to take over weakly-held
shares.
4. Continued recession in the
lumber industry.
5. Further decline in commodity
prices to the lowest levels on the
average since mid-1934.
