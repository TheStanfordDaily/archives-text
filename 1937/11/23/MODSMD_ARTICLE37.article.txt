LIMB DIDN'T BREAK
ON THIS FORECAST
In my first column of the current
volume, I made the statement that
Stanford would not take back its
lease on the Rose Bowl this year,
but it would generally conduct it
self like a ball team to fear and
would wind up among the top four
in the conference. That's one time
1 climbed out on the end of the
limb without the darned thing
breaking.
We also made up a concensus
survey predicting how the confer
ence teams would finish the sea
son. The prognosticators included
three former Daily sports editors,
Gordy Frost, Phil Klauber, and
Wall Peterson; three Card coaches,
Tiny Thornhill, Ben Winkelnian,
and Bobby Grayson; grid-round
er-uppcr Harry Press, and my
self.
BEARS CAME THRU
AS EXPECTED
The only team we placed exactly
in its correct niche was California.
We strung along with the rest of the
sporting world in calling the Bears
conference champs before the sea
son began. We picked three out of
four teams to finish in the top four
and three out of four to finish in the
lower four.
Stanford was picked for fourth
place and Washington was given a
slight edge for second place. The
Cards ended the season in second
place and the Huskies rallied near
the end to wind up in third place.
The Trojans of U.S.C., figured for
third place, dropped down to the
sixth spot, and the Oregon Staters,
given a cinch hold on fifth place,
fooled us by pulling up into the top
four in fourth position.
BEARS AHEAD IN
ANNUAL FEUDING
California has the edge by a 5-3
count in the yearly Bear - Indian
feuding. Stanford has emerged with
victories over the Bears in frosh
football, frosh water polo, and soccer.
The yearling gridders whipped the
Cal Cubs, 13-0; the first year am
phibians won 2-1; and the varsity
soccer team nosed out the Bear
hooters 1-0.
Cal lias won from the Indians
in varsity football, reserve foot
ball. varsity water polo, varsity
soccer, and cross country.
That cross country meet last
Thursday was really sumpin'. I've
never seen so many blue and gold
jerseys coming over a golf bunker
in all my life. The Cal harriers took
the first ten places to score a per
fect low total of 15 points against the
Indians' (58 (naturally it is evident
from this that the lowest score wins
in cross country).
In order to get a letter in cross
country a Stanford runner has to
place within the first ten, so no In
dian golf course rambler will re
ceive a letter this year.
The five Stanford runners who did
figure in the scoring deserve men
tion. Captain Ed Burrows was first
of the Cardinal steeple-chasers;
John Emanuel, second; Rusty
March, third; Ed Hyde, fourth; and
Dave Delameter, fifth.
