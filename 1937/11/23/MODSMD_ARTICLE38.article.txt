OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 22 (Special
to The Daily).—Rolling over snow
covered Nebraska plains, the Stan
ford team today studied Columbia
formations. Scouts' report of the
Columbia-Dartmouth game, sent by
air mail, was picked up at North
Platte. Squad -held a 10-minute
workout at Grand Island. Arrive in
Chicago two hours early, when
Thornhili routed special on fast mail
train. Coming into Cheyenne early
today, the engineer found a saddle
caught on the cow catcher—but no
horse. The entire party is holding
an lowa night tonight with Coach
Ben Winkleman illustrating evolu
tion of swing music.

When Stanford varsity gridders
pull on their long underwear in New
York next Saturday afternoon, they
will not be worried about their
chances of beating Columbia.
It is true that the record of the
Columbia Lions is none too good
this season, but the Big Red Ma
chine will find itself facing prac
tically the same line-up that caught
the first kick-off last year, carried
the ball through 90 yards of slush,
and won the game, 7-0.
Incidentally, a 7-0 victory for the
Lions over the Indians was nothing
new—the Columbians had won their
Rose Bowl encounter with the Cards
two years before.
Lack Reserves
Co-captains George Furey and Joe
Coviello of last year's victors were
the only Lion key men graduated
last June. Joe Vollmer and Johnny
Hudasky, top-notch backs who also
saw service against the Cards, drop
ped from the Columbia roster, also
via the sheepskin route.
Although the vacant spots have
been amply filled, the Lions still are
suffering from lack of reserves.
Coach Lou Little has a fine set of
regulars, but they'll all have to play
60 minutes to make a good showing
against a revengeful Redskin ag
gregation.
Bonom, aßtenian Brains
The Lions rely mostly on a fine
passing attack. Sid Luckman, at left
halfback, is the ace ball-tosser for
the New Yorkers. Art Radvilas and
Johnny Siegal, who play on the Co
lumbia flanks, are both skilled at
pulling the pill from the air.
Co-captain Oscar Bonom will call
signals for the Lions from the full
back post. He will be relieved as
brains of the team, when necessary,
by Johnny Bateman, co-captain at
right tackle.
Lions Fail To Convert
The New Yorkers' greatest failing
is in place-kicking. They have
made successful conversions in only
two games, both of which they won.
Two of their losses have been the
result of conversion points made by
their opponents.
If Stanford loses, the Indians can
feel they virtually have been de
feated by Army, Brown, Cornell,
Navy, Syracuse, and Dartmouth.

chine will find itself facing prac
tically the same line-up that caught
the first kick-off last year, carried
the ball through 90 yards of slush,
and won the game, 7-0.
Incidentally, a 7-0 victory for the
Lions over the Indians was nothing
new—the Columbians had won their
Rose Bowl encounter with the Cards
two years before.
Lack Reserves
Co-captains George Furey and Joe
Coviello of last year's victors were
the only Lion key men graduated
last June. Joe Vollmer and Johnny
Hudasky, top-notch backs who also
saw service against the Cards, drop
ped from the Columbia roster, also
via the sheepskin route.
Although the vacant spots have
been amply filled, the Lions still are
suffering from lack of reserves.
Coach Lou Little has a fine set of
regulars, but they'll all have to play
60 minutes to make a good showing
against a revengeful Redskin ag
gregation.
Bonom, aßtenian Brains
The Lions rely mostly on a fine
passing attack. Sid Luckman, at left
halfback, is the ace ball-tosser for
the New Yorkers. Art Radvilas and
Johnny Siegal, who play on the Co
lumbia flanks, are both skilled at
pulling the pill from the air.
Co-captain Oscar Bonom will call
signals for the Lions from the full
back post. He will be relieved as
brains of the team, when necessary,
by Johnny Bateman, co-captain at
right tackle.
Lions Fail To Convert
The New Yorkers' greatest failing
is in place-kicking. They have
made successful conversions in only
two games, both of which they won.
Two of their losses have been the
result of conversion points made by
their opponents.
If Stanford loses, the Indians can
feel they virtually have been de
feated by Army, Brown, Cornell,
Navy, Syracuse, and Dartmouth.

OMAHA, Neb., Nov. 22 (Special
to The Daily).—Rolling over snow
covered Nebraska plains, the Stan
ford team today studied Columbia
formations. Scouts' report of the
Columbia-Dartmouth game, sent by
air mail, was picked up at North
Platte. Squad -held a 10-minute
workout at Grand Island. Arrive in
Chicago two hours early, when
Thornhili routed special on fast mail
train. Coming into Cheyenne early
today, the engineer found a saddle
caught on the cow catcher—but no
horse. The entire party is holding
an lowa night tonight with Coach
Ben Winkleman illustrating evolu
tion of swing music.

When Stanford varsity gridders
pull on their long underwear in New
York next Saturday afternoon, they
will not be worried about their
chances of beating Columbia.
It is true that the record of the
Columbia Lions is none too good
this season, but the Big Red Ma
chine will find itself facing prac
