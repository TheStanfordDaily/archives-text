# Columbia Given Chance To Upset Indian Team

(Editor's Note: This is the first of two articles, written by a Stan
ford student, who formerly attended college in the East and who
knows Columbia players and coaches. He will present the Lions'
side of Saturday's game.)

Columbia has just as good a
chance to beat Stanford this Satur
day as it had in the Rose Bowl
game of 1934.
This does not mean that the Card
inals will be underdogs, not be any
means. On the contrary, Stanford
shoudl be at least a 2 1 /2-to-l favorite
over Lou Little's charges. We should
win, and win by at least 13 points.
But this was the case in the '34
contest, when Stanford was soundly
criticized from all sides for inviting
a team that had been trounced by
Princeton, 20-0. and which was not
considered capable of furnishing op
position for a strong high school
outfit by some of our more brilliant
Coast sports writers. Even last year
we were fairly heavy favorites, but
we hardly bad a look-in after Furey's
touchdown run on the opening
kickoff.
I can safely say that the Colum
bians are stronger than their record
shows. If they were not, our third

team probably could beat them.
They haven't won a game since early
October when they crushed Penn,
26-6. In the past six Saturdays
they have lost five contests, tieing
only Syracuse.
Stanford's Indians have defeated
Washington, Washington State,
Southern California and U.C.L.A.,
and tied Oregon State. The reader
can fill in the name of the team
that beat us.
So it's the Pacific Coast Confer
ence runner-up against one of the
outstanding Eastern doormats, at
Baker Field next Saturday. But if
Stanfordites are tempted not to tune
in on the game out of respect for
the erstwhile Roaring Lion, let
them remember that Little will start
practically the identical line-up that
beat us last year, and although the
Cardinal is certainly stronger than
in '36, we still won't have Clark and
Calloway in there as we did a sea
son ago. %
