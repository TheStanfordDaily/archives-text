# Waterdogs In Last Game At Berkeley Pool
## Indians after Revenge For Friday's Defeat By California Heirs 
### 
Nort Thornton's hapless waterdogs j
have their lust fling today against j
the California "wonder" water team j
at Berkeley. The Bears defeated the 1
Indians, 3 to 1, here last Friday.
The, Stanford freshmen will tag
along iti an effort to make it two
straight over the Cal Cubs.
The Stanford offense in the first
game was almost a nonentity. John
ny Lamb scored the single goal when
Cal was short a guard who had been j
tossed out of the pool for fouling.
Hoover To Start
Captain Bill Hanna, forward, will
play his last game against the Bears
today. Bill Bleeker, sophomore for
ward, is due to start in place of
Harvey Rothschild. Otherwise the
line-up will stay as it was in the
Friday tilt.
The Indian rear guard, with Hoo
ver, Hatch, and Allen at guards, and
potential all-Coast, choice Bill Burns
at goalie, remains intact. Hoover
caught cold over the week-end but
probably will start.
, The tight defense of this back line
.has become increasingly efficient
game by game. Thornton first dis
covered its potentialities half - way
through the season in games in Los
Angeles. Hoover was the only mem
ber of the quartet who had been
playing first-string prior to that
time.
Hanna, Lamb Back
With Hanna and Lamb back to
gether at forward after a long se
ries of position - shifting, the Card
offense may keep pace with the
strong defense.
The Papooses are licking their
chops with their return to power.
They defeated the Cubs Friday and
are favored to repeat.
