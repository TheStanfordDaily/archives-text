## Packing the Daily Californian 
### 
FREEDOM of the college press is as precious to
student publications as honor is to the melo
drama heroine. Until yesterday afternoon our
Berkeley contemporary, the Daily Californian,
was quite certain that it saw a villain in the
doorway.
The University of California Executive Com
mittee proposed to "reorganize" the paper, in
order that the "policies and management" of the
Californian would be more "democratic." In
order to confer the blessing of democracy, the
committee proposed to take control of editorial
policy out of the hands of the editor. Expres
sions of opinion and policy would be handled
by five "associate editors," and the editor would
take over the technical duties now handled by
the managing editor.
The idea appeared attractive as a means for
stifling the successors of recent California edi
tors who wrote what they pleased. It smacked
of righteousness and democracy, and superfi
cially was the antidote for such editorial wrongs
as monopoly of expression. It seemed to be a
stymie for radical expressions in editorial mate
rial.
In practice the reorganization of the Califor
nian would have turned it into a sort of daily
bulletin with one page of devitalized, contra
dictory opinion. The college editor finds that
it takes days of constant plugging, repetition
after repetition, to get even meager response.
What chance would five pocket edition editors
have? They would row back and forth, go off
on tangents, and stumble over each other. The

editorial page would become a confused noise;
and the paper would fall into about the same
class as an announcement of courses.
The University would lose its severest critic;
undoubtedly a boon to the most severely criti
cized, but hardly such to the democracy which
California's Ex Committee seeks to foster. It is
very easy to say that regulation of the paper
would not mean censorship. That was what they
told us in high school. But high school papers
write on "Don't spit in the drinking fountains,"
and "Keep trash off the lawns." University pub
lications would show little constructiveness if
reduced to this policy.
When the Committee for Reorganization of
the Daily Cal bantered these points about yes
terday they decided on the inevitable compro
mise; the editor would still be determiner of
policy and author of editorials, but he would
turn one column of his editorial page over to
any writer desiring its use. In reality, this was
scarcely a compromise. It was no change at all.
But in backing water the committee at Cali
fornia, which will soon submit its plan for Execu
tive Committee approval, recognized that its
five-editor idea was worse than censorship; that
it made for the obliteration of any constructive
and consistent policy whatsoever.
Democracy for the University of California
and for the Daily Californian will be more of a
reality without the committee's "reorganization"
tor "democracy." The Californian's villain in
the doorway has turned into a corps of marines
marching over the hill.

as monopoly of expression. It seemed to be a
stymie for radical expressions in editorial mate
rial.
In practice the reorganization of the Califor
nian would have turned it into a sort of daily
bulletin with one page of devitalized, contra
dictory opinion. The college editor finds that
it takes days of constant plugging, repetition
after repetition, to get even meager response.
What chance would five pocket edition editors
have? They would row back and forth, go off
on tangents, and stumble over each other. The

editorial page would become a confused noise;
and the paper would fall into about the same
class as an announcement of courses.
The University would lose its severest critic;
undoubtedly a boon to the most severely criti
cized, but hardly such to the democracy which
California's Ex Committee seeks to foster. It is
very easy to say that regulation of the paper
would not mean censorship. That was what they
told us in high school. But high school papers
write on "Don't spit in the drinking fountains,"
and "Keep trash off the lawns." University pub
lications would show little constructiveness if
reduced to this policy.
When the Committee for Reorganization of
the Daily Cal bantered these points about yes
terday they decided on the inevitable compro
mise; the editor would still be determiner of
policy and author of editorials, but he would
turn one column of his editorial page over to
any writer desiring its use. In reality, this was
scarcely a compromise. It was no change at all.
But in backing water the committee at Cali
fornia, which will soon submit its plan for Execu
tive Committee approval, recognized that its
five-editor idea was worse than censorship; that
it made for the obliteration of any constructive
and consistent policy whatsoever.
Democracy for the University of California
and for the Daily Californian will be more of a
reality without the committee's "reorganization"
tor "democracy." The Californian's villain in
the doorway has turned into a corps of marines
marching over the hill.
FREEDOM of the college press is as precious to
student publications as honor is to the melo
drama heroine. Until yesterday afternoon our
Berkeley contemporary, the Daily Californian,
was quite certain that it saw a villain in the
doorway.
The University of California Executive Com
mittee proposed to "reorganize" the paper, in
order that the "policies and management" of the
Californian would be more "democratic." In
order to confer the blessing of democracy, the
committee proposed to take control of editorial
policy out of the hands of the editor. Expres
sions of opinion and policy would be handled
by five "associate editors," and the editor would
take over the technical duties now handled by
the managing editor.
The idea appeared attractive as a means for
stifling the successors of recent California edi
tors who wrote what they pleased. It smacked
of righteousness and democracy, and superfi
cially was the antidote for such editorial wrongs
as monopoly of expression. It seemed to be a
stymie for radical expressions in editorial mate
rial.
