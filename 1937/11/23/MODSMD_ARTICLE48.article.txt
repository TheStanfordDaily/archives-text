# Gaieties Gold Mine
## 
### 
STANFORD'S 1937 "extravaganza," the Big
Game Gaieties, did more than draw certain
applause for good performance. It made money.
It smashed decade-long 8.0. records with
a $2,700 gross intake, a $1,500 net profit. Though
it is true that one-third of this came from the
hastily planned matinee performance, it is still
too large a sum to be earned by a "co-operative"
student show.
Blessed, however, with such a juicy nest egg,
Dramatic Council has few worries for the bal
ance of this college year. Not being a profit
seeking organization, it will probably attempt to
balance the books by returning profits in the
form of reduced prices for the winter and spring
shows.

Bui they might do well to guard against simi
larly awkward situations in years to come, and
to work out a practicable system for keeping
profits below a set figure.
Two equally workable methods of accom
plishing this, without cutting the quality of
campus productions, offer themselves. Most
obvious is a reduction in ticket prices. Last
week's charges could have been reduced 50
per cent and Dramatic Council would still have
made a profit of more than $150.
Second possibility is one which might put
Stanford's dramatics on a more equal basis with
Stanford's new dramatic setting, the Memorial
Hall—give student audiences more for their
money.
This is not to infer that this year's Gaieties
were not worth the prices charged. It is pos
sible, however, that next year's stage sets be
more elaborate, the orchestra larger, and cos
tumes better—without mutilating the dramatic
budget or singeing the students' wallets.
But that is next year.
In the meantime there is a $1,500 nest egg
which should indirectly be returned to its do
nors throughout the present season. This must
be accomplished by offering more for less in the
winter and spring shows yet to be given. The
student dramatic season should be off to a fly
ing start.—J. R.

were not worth the prices charged. It is pos
sible, however, that next year's stage sets be
more elaborate, the orchestra larger, and cos
tumes better—without mutilating the dramatic
budget or singeing the students' wallets.
But that is next year.
In the meantime there is a $1,500 nest egg
which should indirectly be returned to its do
nors throughout the present season. This must
be accomplished by offering more for less in the
winter and spring shows yet to be given. The
student dramatic season should be off to a fly
ing start.—J. R.
