DON QUIXOTE HIDES AGAIN
/ \VER at the University of California the student
newspaper and the Executive Committee are stag
ing a little undeclared war that fits in nicely with the
currently popular military spirit. Executive Commit
tee, it seems, wants the paper to be more "democratic.
To confer this blessing of equality it proposes to put
editorial policy in the hands of five assistant editors,
leaving the editor to handle technical duties.
As The Stanford Daily editor points out at the top
of this page, Cal's Ex Committee is obviously not
majoring in journalism. Its proposal is as impractical
as a fan dancer in an overcoat. In fact, the committee
has already begun to back water on it. But what
amazes me is not the holes-per-square-inch ratio of
the scheme. It is the touching confidence with which
(he Ex Committee passes on a problem that has put
grooves in philosophers' foreheads ever since Cain
put Abel out at first.

What Cal Ex Committee plans to do is set up a
water-tight organization that will give a perfect, co
operative paper regardless of staff. In other words, the
committee hopes to eliminate the well-known human
element. It wants a paper that can do no wrong. It
wants to put the editor in a position where he cannot
possibly become a problem child. It wants to make
the organization so perfect that the man can do
nothing but walk with angels.
And when it tries to do this, the committee blithely
bites oIT one of the biggest mouthfuls on record. Ever
since the first prc-historic men ganged up on a mam
moth, philosophers have been looking for some way
to eliminate the human clement. Mankind has al
ways sought the perfect organization, the system that
would make it impossible for men to do wrong. And
always he has failed tragically.

r INHERE is something touching about the way the
committee goes to the mat with this problem. It
is like a small boy setting out from the Farm, sub
limely confident that he will return by Christmas with
a first mortgage on Manhattan.
Unfortunately, though, the world is not particu
larly sentimental. Brave little boys find that the
demand for first mortgages considerably exceeds the
.supply. Cal will meet the same failure that" every
man finds when he tries to solve the riddle of the
world in ten easy lessons.
We have made a great many attempts, but we
still have the human element as prominent as ever.
Whenever we eliminate it we find that the perfect
organization can do nothing. Almost any government,
business, or code of ethics would work beautifully if
every man could be trusted to the limit. And since
every man cannot be trusted, no organization has ever
worked perfectly.
♦ * * *
It is interesting to note that Cal gives "democracy"
as the reason for its project. Democracy is the cur
rent white hope of those who seek the perfect organ
ization. But democracy as we know is no more per
fect than other systems. When it is completely demo
cratic it can do nothing but sit around and twiddle its
elected thumbs. When it works, it falls back on cen
tralized authority, and again runs the risk of the
human element.
And so I wish that some philosophy professors
would drop in on the Cal Ex Committee and explain
to them just what they are taking on. Biting oft big
mouthfuls may be admirable, Emily Post to the con
trary. But if you gag on the mouthful, there's going
to he on awful mess.
