by Big Game week-end, and by the vit
riolic attack on our respiratory tract by malignant
germies, we can tell you right now that this column
will be hardly worth the trouble. With little trolls
marching up and down our sinus passages beating bo
lero rhythms on African tom-toms, we are in no mood
for anything in the way of bright lights or soft music.
Come to think of it, we won't even be able to tell
whether it is a bolero rhythm until Collie Small and
his adversary of the Vox Campi settle it with sabers
at 50 paces.

Showing a bare-faced inconsistency, we confess to
a secret yen for Big-Appling, though we frown upon
other forms of eccentric ballroom dancing, particu
larly that hatched and fostered by Balboa and the
Palomar. But we realize that those hailing from the
nether regions of this state may not agree wtih us.
In fact, one gentleman from the sullen south threat
ened to organize a swing dancing club, using the Nit
ery as its stamping grounds.
He would probably find that his membership drive
would turn into a down-hill coast, if his southern
compatriots in the Balboa hop haven't been converted
by our cold-blooded northern brand. But until he
institutes the Big Apple, we will go over to the wom
en's dancing class, where, rumor tells us, Miss Jewell
is marching with time in teaching a few of the steps.
Latest word from the front reports that Emery
University in Atlanta, Georgia, finding their gym too
small for the "Enlarged Northern Spy," settled the
problem by inventing the "Little Peach." That ought
to solve the problem for the Nitery—we might call
ours the "Wandering Hatchett" to get away from the
fruit angle.
