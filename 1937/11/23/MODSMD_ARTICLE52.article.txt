# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Old Boy's effusion in last
Thursday's Chappie, coming as it
did on top of a number of deliber
ate misunderstandings and mis
statements from certain people who
should know better, tempts me
sorely to do what is probably the
only thing anyone trying to shake
Stanford from its sanctified rut can
do—throw up my hands, shut my
mouth, and let it go to hell in its
own way.
Such naivete as the Old Boy ex
hibited, however, is irresistible, with
the result that I am once more
darkening these pages.
Turn Back, Please
But only briefly. In fact, all I
am going to do is refer the Old Boy
back to my original letter. Ih it the
whole substance of my main argu
ment was that:
1. Stanford has no money to main
tain a first-class faculty.
2. Stanford has no money because
it is being spent on buildings.
3. Stanford does not need all those
buildings.
4. Stanford does need a good fac
ulty.
Perhaps the Old Boy will leave
out the red herring of sentiment—
which is a very valid reason for
criticism, even though it did not
loom half so large in my reasons
for writing as the Old Boy seems
to assume—and will explain why it
is inevitable that Stanford be al
lowed to grow into the sort of aca
demic monstrosity the administra
tion evidently wants it to grow into.
There is nothing which says the
registration must be above four
thousand. There is no law which
says every dollar above operating
costs must be used for pretty
buildings. I recall no requirement
which says that faculty must be sac
rificed on the altar of physical
structure.
Mrs. Stanford's Mind
What I questioned all the way
through my letter was the right of
the administration to ruin what
was once, in the mind of Mrs. Stan
ford, and for quite a long time
thereafter in actual fact, a very fine
conception of a university.
Either the Old Boy missed the
point of my argument completely—
(Cries of, "Hartmann? No, no!") —
or he was deliberately trying to
prove that it looked better under
the heading "Now That" than it did
under the heading "Campus Opin
ion"—equally unlikely, I think.
Therefore, just what is the point,
Old Boy? I don't get it.

Turn Back, Please
But only briefly. In fact, all I
am going to do is refer the Old Boy
back to my original letter. Ih it the
whole substance of my main argu
ment was that:
1. Stanford has no money to main
tain a first-class faculty.
2. Stanford has no money because
it is being spent on buildings.
3. Stanford does not need all those
buildings.
4. Stanford does need a good fac
ulty.
Perhaps the Old Boy will leave
out the red herring of sentiment—
which is a very valid reason for
criticism, even though it did not
loom half so large in my reasons
for writing as the Old Boy seems
to assume—and will explain why it
is inevitable that Stanford be al
lowed to grow into the sort of aca
demic monstrosity the administra
tion evidently wants it to grow into.
There is nothing which says the
registration must be above four
thousand. There is no law which
says every dollar above operating
costs must be used for pretty
buildings. I recall no requirement
which says that faculty must be sac
rificed on the altar of physical
structure.
Mrs. Stanford's Mind
What I questioned all the way
through my letter was the right of
the administration to ruin what
was once, in the mind of Mrs. Stan
ford, and for quite a long time
thereafter in actual fact, a very fine
conception of a university.
Either the Old Boy missed the
point of my argument completely—
(Cries of, "Hartmann? No, no!") —
or he was deliberately trying to
prove that it looked better under
the heading "Now That" than it did
under the heading "Campus Opin
ion"—equally unlikely, I think.
Therefore, just what is the point,
Old Boy? I don't get it.

The Editor, Sir:
The Old Boy's effusion in last
Thursday's Chappie, coming as it
did on top of a number of deliber
ate misunderstandings and mis
statements from certain people who
should know better, tempts me
sorely to do what is probably the
only thing anyone trying to shake
Stanford from its sanctified rut can
do—throw up my hands, shut my
mouth, and let it go to hell in its
own way.
Such naivete as the Old Boy ex
hibited, however, is irresistible, with
the result that I am once more
darkening these pages.
