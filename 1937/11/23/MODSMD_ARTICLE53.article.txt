Chappies' music critic, his No. 1

Editor.

The Editor, Sir:
The nice men in the white jack
ets have lost track of McGuirk (P.M.
of Campus Opinion, gentle readers),
and we're once more engaged in the
childish feud which he started.
As to the source of your gripes,
Mr. McGuirk—it couldn't lie in the
fact that you, at precisely the same

period, tried out for Stompin'
Around and failed, could it? And
there was no association of that
failure to your futile attempts to
shape Hartmann's editorial policy,
was there? When the man who
writes a column superior to mine
has it accepted by Chaparral, then
I'll be big enough to admit that he
is better. But I won't look for some
other publication to put my column
in and, incidentally, why don*t you
try Wee Wisdom, a magazine that's
very weak in its music department.
Casa Loma's drummer is Briglia—
it did come out wrong, yes, but who
are you when you spell Crosby's
drummer's name as "Baduc" instead
of "Mauduc"? I've seen it in print
no less than four times in the last
month, and somebody's screwy if
they're all wrong!
It's very nice and thoughtful of
you to ring up Shirley Jones and
Tom Siebert, who both have
"mighty fine record collections," to
find out a little something about
music. As to their knowledge of it,
I know nothing (Shirley sings very
nicely, and it must be lots of fun
to talk to her over the phone), but
my Aunt Priscilla had a wonderful
library of nasty jokes, and she
couldn't even read! So, little man,
what now?
All this is becoming very tiresome
to me, and pi'obably to those who
read Campus Opinion, but I have
just a few more lines. Your state
ment, "What a big laugh it is going
to be to the eastern cats, who really
know what swing is, when they read
it," is really a left-handed, double
reversed and triple-spiraled com
pliment, McGuii'k. Look in the
Bawlout, but don't feel silly when
you read it, and you will find my
address. Where ax - e you from, in
cidentally? Not EAST Stockton,
thereby making you an eastern cat?
And that's all, except that I ask
you to go easy on Hartmann. He
wakes in feverish sweats in the mid
dle of the night with huge, hairy
McGuirks descending slowly upon
him, all intent upon becoming edi
tors of Chaparral. Love and kisses.

childish feud which he started.
As to the source of your gripes,
Mr. McGuirk—it couldn't lie in the
fact that you, at precisely the same

period, tried out for Stompin'
Around and failed, could it? And
there was no association of that
failure to your futile attempts to
shape Hartmann's editorial policy,
was there? When the man who
writes a column superior to mine
has it accepted by Chaparral, then
I'll be big enough to admit that he
is better. But I won't look for some
other publication to put my column
in and, incidentally, why don*t you
try Wee Wisdom, a magazine that's
very weak in its music department.
Casa Loma's drummer is Briglia—
it did come out wrong, yes, but who
are you when you spell Crosby's
drummer's name as "Baduc" instead
of "Mauduc"? I've seen it in print
no less than four times in the last
month, and somebody's screwy if
they're all wrong!
It's very nice and thoughtful of
you to ring up Shirley Jones and
Tom Siebert, who both have
"mighty fine record collections," to
find out a little something about
music. As to their knowledge of it,
I know nothing (Shirley sings very
nicely, and it must be lots of fun
to talk to her over the phone), but
my Aunt Priscilla had a wonderful
library of nasty jokes, and she
couldn't even read! So, little man,
what now?
All this is becoming very tiresome
to me, and pi'obably to those who
read Campus Opinion, but I have
just a few more lines. Your state
ment, "What a big laugh it is going
to be to the eastern cats, who really
know what swing is, when they read
it," is really a left-handed, double
reversed and triple-spiraled com
pliment, McGuii'k. Look in the
Bawlout, but don't feel silly when
you read it, and you will find my
address. Where ax - e you from, in
cidentally? Not EAST Stockton,
thereby making you an eastern cat?
And that's all, except that I ask
you to go easy on Hartmann. He
wakes in feverish sweats in the mid
dle of the night with huge, hairy
McGuirks descending slowly upon
him, all intent upon becoming edi
tors of Chaparral. Love and kisses.
