# Move To Protect Buyers of Power
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 22 (U.R).â€”
The California Water Authority to
day took an initial step to protect
prospective purchasers of electric
power generated at Shasta Dam of
the Central Valley Water Project.
Attorney C. C. Carleton, counsel
for the authority, was instructed to
petition the State Supreme Court
for a liberal ruling in deciding pend
ing dissolution proceedings against
the Bidwell Utility District of Butte
County.
Carleton said unless, the issue of
utilities districts operating utilities
properties is decided on a liberal
basis, "infant public utility districts
will be strangled before they can
get into operation."
The Third District Appellate Court
recently reversed a Butte County
Superior Court decision ordering
Bidwill District directors to call a
dissolution. The Appellate Court up
held the district's contention it actu
ally is operating utilities properties,
hence cannot be dissolved. The de
cision has been appealed to the Su
preme Court.
