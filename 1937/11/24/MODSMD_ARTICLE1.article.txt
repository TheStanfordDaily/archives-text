SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Nov. 24.
-Confident that complete collapse
of effective resistance in China is
near, and that failure of the inter
national Far East Conference in
Brussels to agree on specific aid to
the Chinese has removed immediate
danger of foreign intervention,
Japan today began to put into ef
fect her carefully-prepared plans to
make over vast areas of this ancient
country on a pro-Japanese pattern.
The state would include the great
commercial cities of Peiping, Tient
sin, Taiyuan-Fu and others and
would be operated through Japa
nese advisers as part of a general
North Asian economic unit center
ing around Japan and Manchukuo.
Other Developments
Other war developments included:
I —In Nanking a letter dropped by
a Japanese aviator for General
issimo Chiang Kai-Shek, Central
Chinese dictator, urging him to sur
render with his army, was delivered
to the generalissimo by soldiers who
picked it up. A spokesman said that
"no answer was forthcoming since
none was necessary," which was in
terpreted to mean Chiang was de
termined to keep on fighting.
O—There were strong indications
that the Chinese were receiving
considerable supplies of war mate
rials, presumably through the Brit
ish Crown colony of Hong Kong in
South China, including new Soviet
Russian and American Curtis-Hawk
fighting planes.
•>—Foreign authorities of the In
ternational Settlement and the
French Concession in Shanghai were
adopting an increasingly concilia
tory attitude toward the' Japanese
following a Japanese spokesman's
threat that Japan would seize Chi
nese government agencies in the
foreign areas if necessary.
A— A. Japanese army spokesman
said there was no confirmation of
reports that Wusih, key to the Chi
nese lines west of Shanghai, had
been occupied, but said the Chinese
line was so battei'ed that Wusih had
ceased to be of major importance.
