# Dancer Performs In Memorial Hall
## 
### 
A well-filled auditorium at last
evening's dance concert in Memorial
Hall testified to the popularity of
Von Goodmon's unusual interpretive
dances. He was accompanied by
Gladys Steele, who also played and
sang several selections during inter
missions.
From the bullfight sequence to
the closing "Caucasian Lesginka" the
numbers were dramatically effective
and perfectly timed. Lighting, cos
tuming. and stage effects were strik
ing, adding much to the beauty of
his performances.
Worthy of especial note was the
extraordinary fluidity of his "Lotus
Land"; the contrasting mechanical
woodenness of the "Marionette," en
thusiastically applauded; the maj
esty of his "Tlaloc," a dance of the
Zapotecan race. Von Goodmon's
J "Fire Dance," brief and dynamic,
i came in for its due share of applause.
A charming native Mexican num
ber, "En el Campo," preceded the
dance of the Russian steppes. "Cau
| casian Lesginka." an acrobatic and
j refreshing ending to a most enter
i taining hour and a quarter.
