# Indian Gridders Sharpen Axe For Columbia Game; Hawaiian Tilts Cancelled
## Steamship Sailings Make Island Trip Inadvisable 
### 
Reports that the Stanford football team's trip to
the Hawaiian Islands, during Christmas vacation, had
been cancelled were confirmed yesterday by University
athletic officials.
The trip was called off, representatives of the Hoard
of Athletic Control said, because changed sailing dates
of steamships would have made return of the team
before January 12 impossible.
Otto Klum, football coach at the University of
Hawaii, was notified of the decision after A1 Masters,

graduate manager, and Dr. Hay
man Wilbur had conferred on the j
problem. Both are in the East.
According to information received
here they felt that, for scholastic |
reasons, it would be inadvisable to
have some 30 members of the foot- 1
ball squad miss the opening nine
days of winter quarter.
Sailings Changed
The Indians were scheduled to
play two games in the Islands, one on
Christmas Day, the other on New i
Year's Day. However, under the
changed sailing dates, the President
Garfield, only liner leaving for Ha
waii after finals, will sail on Christ
mas instead of December 17.
That would mean the team, reach
ing Hawaii at the end of the month,
would miss the ship on which it had
been booked for the return.
Dr. Thomas Storey, chairman of

the faculty athletic commission, was
informed of the cancellation yester
day.
Report Doubted
Klum made the first public an
nouncement of the message, sent to
him from New York City by Mas
ters, at Honolulu Monday. Before
they were notified by Masters, offi
cials on the campus here were in
clined to doubt the authenticity of
the message.
Klum immediately began negotia
tions to have either University of
Denver, frequent host to traveling
Hawaiian grid teams, or University
of Washington replace Stanford on
the holiday schedule.
At Seattle, Washington athletic
officials said they had received an
invitation late Monday to make the
trip. Officials there are conferring to
determine if such a trip would in
terfere seriously with gridders'
clotswork.
