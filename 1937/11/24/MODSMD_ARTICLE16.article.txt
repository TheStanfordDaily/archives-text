# Theta Hashers Splatter Foes
## 
### 
The Kappas owe the Thetas and
their hashers a lot of b—r because
the Theta hashers defeated the Kap
pa hashers in a simply "ducky"
game of basketball last night 28 to
25. It was the first game of the
newly concocted Hashers' League.
The affair simply abounded with
femininity. The Kappas were just
too, too in blue sweaters while the
Thetas looked gorgeous in a flock
of sweet-scented formals. Although
the Thetas claimed they had been to
a formal dinner, those in the know
insisted they prettied up for their
brave hashers who did not let them
down in the crisis—drop a tray on
their heads, as it were.
The Kappas presented a card stunt
of a pansy. Observers weren't sure
whether to declare that this was for
the opposition's hashers or because
the pansy is the house flower of the
Thetas. Anyway it was divine. A
take-off on the Axe Yell "Sling the
Hash" had the crowd on its feet.
Sis Young and Barbara Murphy
were cute in white hasher jackets
and served oranges and milk at the
rest periods. Several varsity basket
ball scouts were seen in the ofling,
but their reports to John Bunn will
necessarily be scanty because they
spent most of their time ogling at
the spectators.
After the game, the Kappas had to
sing while the triumphant Thetas
stood by and heckled, all the while
licking their chops over the b—r tci
come.
