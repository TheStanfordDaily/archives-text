# Cards Rated Pre-game Nod Over New York Team
## 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Twice disappointed at the hands of the "inferior
Columbia Lions, Stanford Indians will run out into
the cold art 1 of Polo Grounds in New York Saturday
intent on gaining for themselves a decisive victory—
■ and revenge.
It was hack in IJKI4, when the Vowing Sophs were
criticized for inviting a second rate football team,
: played the Columhias, for the New Year's Day en
i counter in Rose Bowl. Columbia had been defeated

•20-0 by Princeton and had not per
formed as a first-class team should.
But the Lions came out West and
embarrassed the highly favored In
dians by defeating them, 7-0. The
same team won by the same score
last year, when the Cards went East
and fumbled around on aj? icy field
in a pathetic effort to overbalance
the touchdown made by the Lions
on the kickoff.
Predict Victory
Columbia has about the same op
position to offer the Big Red Ma
chine this year, but the Indians
have more. And we need not fear
overconfidence this week (because
the players will not read this) in
predicting a decisive victory for the
Cards.
The Indians have the edge over
the Lions in nearly every position.
They need only to worry about Sid
Luckman, fullback for the New
Yorkers, and his great ball-passing
skill. The Stanford boys got some
good practice covering pass-receiv
ers in the Big Game, and they will
find their training useful in guard
ing Art Radvilas and Johnny Siegal,
highly touted flankmen of the Lion
varsity.
Blockers Needed
Although Coach Tiny Thornhill
will not know until the toss-up ex
actly what men will start for Stan
ford, it is likely that he will use
his best blockers if the weather is
bad on Saturday.
Bill Paulman will remain in the
fullback spot to show Luckman how
westerners toss passes, and Gene
Coldiron will back up the line at
quarterback. Halves will be Billy
Kirsch, and Jimmy Coffis or Peter
Fay.
Stone Will Start
Grant Stone, who is expected to
be fully recovered from a Big Game
shoulder injury, will again start as
captain on the right flank. Neil Ras
mussen and Bill Willard will fight
it out for the call on the left.
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen
will hold their regular tackle posts,
while guard spots will be held by
Leo Ferko and Jack Walton or Bob
Dakan. Louie Tsoutsouvas and Tony
Calvelli will again alternate in the
pivot post.
Coach Lou Little of the Lions will
probably start Radvilas and Siegal
at ends; Wright and Co-captain
Bateman, tackles; Waldo and Pis
tolas, guards; and Hersey, center.
Co-captain Oscar Bonom will be
starting fullback; Luckman and
Taylor, halves; and Stanczyk, quar
l terback.

But the Lions came out West and
embarrassed the highly favored In
dians by defeating them, 7-0. The
same team won by the same score
last year, when the Cards went East
and fumbled around on aj? icy field
in a pathetic effort to overbalance
the touchdown made by the Lions
on the kickoff.
Predict Victory
Columbia has about the same op
position to offer the Big Red Ma
chine this year, but the Indians
have more. And we need not fear
overconfidence this week (because
the players will not read this) in
predicting a decisive victory for the
Cards.
The Indians have the edge over
the Lions in nearly every position.
They need only to worry about Sid
Luckman, fullback for the New
Yorkers, and his great ball-passing
skill. The Stanford boys got some
good practice covering pass-receiv
ers in the Big Game, and they will
find their training useful in guard
ing Art Radvilas and Johnny Siegal,
highly touted flankmen of the Lion
varsity.
Blockers Needed
Although Coach Tiny Thornhill
will not know until the toss-up ex
actly what men will start for Stan
ford, it is likely that he will use
his best blockers if the weather is
bad on Saturday.
Bill Paulman will remain in the
fullback spot to show Luckman how
westerners toss passes, and Gene
Coldiron will back up the line at
quarterback. Halves will be Billy
Kirsch, and Jimmy Coffis or Peter
Fay.
Stone Will Start
Grant Stone, who is expected to
be fully recovered from a Big Game
shoulder injury, will again start as
captain on the right flank. Neil Ras
mussen and Bill Willard will fight
it out for the call on the left.
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen
will hold their regular tackle posts,
while guard spots will be held by
Leo Ferko and Jack Walton or Bob
Dakan. Louie Tsoutsouvas and Tony
Calvelli will again alternate in the
pivot post.
Coach Lou Little of the Lions will
probably start Radvilas and Siegal
at ends; Wright and Co-captain
Bateman, tackles; Waldo and Pis
tolas, guards; and Hersey, center.
Co-captain Oscar Bonom will be
starting fullback; Luckman and
Taylor, halves; and Stanczyk, quar
l terback.
Twice disappointed at the hands of the "inferior
Columbia Lions, Stanford Indians will run out into
the cold art 1 of Polo Grounds in New York Saturday
intent on gaining for themselves a decisive victory—
■ and revenge.
