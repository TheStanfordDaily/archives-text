# Clean-Up Crew Finds Clearing Stanford Stadium Hardest Job
## Three Caterpillars Used To Aid Mired Autos 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
When the gun ended this year s
rainy Big Game Saturday, the job
of staging the annual grid battle had
scarcely begun.
Soggy newspapers were strewn
about in the Stadium, people were
slopping around in the mud, some
of them falling prostrate, trying to
<jcl to their enmired automobiles,
75 bewildered children and elderly
women were reportedly asking as
i stance in finding their separated
friends.
Three caterpillar tractors were
kept busy for the rest of the eve
ning pulling automobiles out of the
black muck of the parking areas.
Motorists stuck the worst were the
c nes who came early and parked in
obscure places, hoping to get away
ina hurry after the game.
Despite the rain, mud, and game
enthusiasm, the parking grounds
were cleared a half hour earlier
(baa at any previous Big Game, said
.Jake Irwin, manager of operations
Jor the Board of Athletic Control.
No Arguments
"They didn't even stop to argue
v/Jien two cars smashed fenders," he
.said. This reduced congestion was
caused partly by the fact that many
who attended the game parked then
cars in Palo Alto.
One result of the rain on game
day was an v increased sale of sand
wiches at concessions. The 15,000 hot
dogs and 12,000 cold sandwiches
were reported sold out, most of them
by 1 o'clock. The 79,000 cokes and
sodas for sale at the Stadium went
mostly unsold because of the rain.
Monday afternoon, the agent was
loading up over two-thirds of his
stock to take it back to San Fran
cisco, perhaps to wait hopefully for
the Big Game next year.
Four Days' Cleaning
Early Sunday morning the clean
up crew started its four-day job
at the Stadium. Working eight hours
a day, most of the 25 men had to be
hired especially for the work, since
the regular grounds crew was oc
cupied with repairing the torn-up
athletic fields that had been used for
parking lots.
There was not sign of the goal
posts, souvenir hunters having
gleaned the last splinter. They will
not be replaced until the football
season opens again next fall, ac
cording to Mr. Irwin.
Bottles to Be Broken
Tidying the stands is particularly
difficult this game, because specta
tors used so many newspapei's to
sit on. Newspapers have now been
heaped together, too wet to sell, per
haps too wet to burn.
There were fewer liquor bottles
oven than at the smaller games, says
Mr. Irwin. He believes that the Palo
Aito dry law caused this. At least
Paly shop-keepers found their most
frequent query to be, "Where can I
get a drink?"
Beer and whiskey bottles will be
broken in compliance with state
law, Mr. Irwin revealed.
Rain brought an increased demand

for raincoats, many spectators find
ing that Palo Alto oil cloth was al
ready sold out to those who would
cut holes in squares of the material
so their heads would stick through.
It was rumored that one entrepre
neur made $1000 by selling 50-cent
transparent slickers for $2 apiece.
Most of the post-game clean-up
will be completed today, but the
crew will probably be kept working
tomorrow picking up bottle caps and
bits of glass.

Early Sunday morning the clean
up crew started its four-day job
at the Stadium. Working eight hours
a day, most of the 25 men had to be
hired especially for the work, since
the regular grounds crew was oc
cupied with repairing the torn-up
athletic fields that had been used for
parking lots.
There was not sign of the goal
posts, souvenir hunters having
gleaned the last splinter. They will
not be replaced until the football
season opens again next fall, ac
cording to Mr. Irwin.
Bottles to Be Broken
Tidying the stands is particularly
difficult this game, because specta
tors used so many newspapei's to
sit on. Newspapers have now been
heaped together, too wet to sell, per
haps too wet to burn.
There were fewer liquor bottles
oven than at the smaller games, says
Mr. Irwin. He believes that the Palo
Aito dry law caused this. At least
Paly shop-keepers found their most
frequent query to be, "Where can I
get a drink?"
Beer and whiskey bottles will be
broken in compliance with state
law, Mr. Irwin revealed.
Rain brought an increased demand

for raincoats, many spectators find
ing that Palo Alto oil cloth was al
ready sold out to those who would
cut holes in squares of the material
so their heads would stick through.
It was rumored that one entrepre
neur made $1000 by selling 50-cent
transparent slickers for $2 apiece.
Most of the post-game clean-up
will be completed today, but the
crew will probably be kept working
tomorrow picking up bottle caps and
bits of glass.
When the gun ended this year s
rainy Big Game Saturday, the job
of staging the annual grid battle had
scarcely begun.
Soggy newspapers were strewn
about in the Stadium, people were
slopping around in the mud, some
of them falling prostrate, trying to
<jcl to their enmired automobiles,
75 bewildered children and elderly
women were reportedly asking as
i stance in finding their separated
friends.
Three caterpillar tractors were
kept busy for the rest of the eve
ning pulling automobiles out of the
black muck of the parking areas.
Motorists stuck the worst were the
c nes who came early and parked in
obscure places, hoping to get away
ina hurry after the game.
Despite the rain, mud, and game
enthusiasm, the parking grounds
were cleared a half hour earlier
(baa at any previous Big Game, said
.Jake Irwin, manager of operations
Jor the Board of Athletic Control.
No Arguments
"They didn't even stop to argue
v/Jien two cars smashed fenders," he
.said. This reduced congestion was
caused partly by the fact that many
who attended the game parked then
cars in Palo Alto.
One result of the rain on game
day was an v increased sale of sand
wiches at concessions. The 15,000 hot
dogs and 12,000 cold sandwiches
were reported sold out, most of them
by 1 o'clock. The 79,000 cokes and
sodas for sale at the Stadium went
mostly unsold because of the rain.
Monday afternoon, the agent was
loading up over two-thirds of his
stock to take it back to San Fran
cisco, perhaps to wait hopefully for
the Big Game next year.
