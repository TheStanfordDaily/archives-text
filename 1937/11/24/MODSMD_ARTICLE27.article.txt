# 'Japan Can't Destroy China," Observer Says
## 
### ELEANOR MARQUAND 
"Does Japan think that by resorting to wanton and savage destruction
of life and property that all China can be exterminated in a few months
or years?"
This is the question asked recently in an open letter to the South
China Morning Post by James I). Bush. A Stanford graduate, Mr. Bush

has been living in China since 1931,
during which time he has been able
to observe the horrors of war in the
Far East.
Witness at Canton
Mr. Bush has seen Canton leveled
from a once brilliantly lighted city
to a now cowering mass waiting for
the night raids. He says that culture
and civilization is being destroyed
all over China.
The people of Peiping, especially
the students and educated classes,
are living in constant terror, says
Mr .Bush. "I had seen with my
own eyes the hundreds and thou
sands of Chinese students, boys and
girls, man-handled and driven into
the trains supposedly to be taken
into detention camps or military
headquarters to be questioned and
examined, but in fact to be shot
indiscriminately."
Japan Wild
Through an exaggerated idea of
military grandeur Japan seems to
have gone wild, says Mr. Bush.
He asks, "Is it not true that high
falutin' delusion of Empire, Mistress
of the Pacific and Asiatic Continent,
commercial greed and diplomatic
deceit and imbecile Fascism are re
sponsible for all the havoc in China
at this crucial hour and have
plunged the international trade into
such chaos and uncertainty.'
Japan's army and navy may think
that they can annihilate the work
of centuries in a few destructive
months, he writes, but it takes more
than Japanese aggression to wear
down China's man power and moral
I endurance. China has sustained her
cherished ideals of peace and cu!-
j ture for a long time.
