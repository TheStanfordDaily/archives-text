MADISON, Wis., Nov. 23 (UP).— :
Sen. Robert M. LaFollette, R., is a
likely successor to President Frank
lin D. Roosevelt if the latter were ,
free to pick his successor, Dr. Stan
j ley High said today in his new
book, "Roosevelt—And Then What?" j
"More nearly than any other
American of political importance,
Senator LaFollette is what Mr. Roo
sevelt would be if Mr. Roosevelt did
| not have a national political party |
ito think about," wrote the former
intimate of presidential circles. "That j
is why, if Mr. Roosevelt had com- |
j plete control of the Democratic
; party, or if a new and better suited
party were created for him, Bob La
i Follette would be his likeliest can
didate."
High said the President's inviting
Senator LaFollette and his brother,
Governor Philip F. LaFollette of
Wisconsin, on a cruise on the
presidential yacht last summer was
j regarded in Congress as a gesture
I of defiance toward Democratic con
i servatives.

Area of the Midway Islands is one
I square mile.
