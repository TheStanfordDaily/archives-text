# Weekly Excom Meeting Cancelled
## 
### 
Regular Ex Committee meeting
for last night was called off by
President Tom Killefer, due to the
fact that no business was to be con
sidered that could not wait.
Ex Com will swing into harness
after the Thanksgiving holidays with
the regular Tuesday night meeting
next week.
Among business to be brought up
at that time will be the official
statement by the body on Sunday
night movies. Estimates on a Nitery
soda fountain will also be discussed.
