# Coonley Explains Council to Club
## 
### 
Cynthia Coonley, speaking to
Klahoya Club members yesterday,
cited the wide opportunity for girls
to serve on Women's Conference
committees.
"Conference's policy this year is
to split up activities among as many
girls as possible. We have found
that some were doing too much
work at the expense of their
studies."
She explained the difference be
tween Conference and Council, and
discussed the government of wom
en's halls.
The group will meet at the home
of Dorothy Brown, Klahoya presi
dent, to listen to the tSanford-Co
lumbia game, have luncheon and
attend a showing of Paul Muni in
"Zola." Last social event slated for
the club is a dance to be given by
Barbara Templeton, social man
ager, December 4.
