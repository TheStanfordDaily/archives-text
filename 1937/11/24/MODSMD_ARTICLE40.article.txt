# Ballet Director Will Talk Here
## Fritz Cohen To Speak For Orchesis Dec 6 
### 
Fritz Cohen, musical director of
the Joass Ballet, will be presented
by Orchesis Society in an informal
talk on December 6 at 1:10 o'clock
in the Little Theater.
Any students or faculty members
in the University are urged to at
tend. The talk will be of especial
interest to those planning to attend
the ballet while it is in the Bay Re
gion.
Cohen has been an integral part
of the ballet since its organization.
He composes most of the music used
with his dances, and also arranges
and directs the accompaniment.
Often he plays one of the two pianos
used.
The Joass Ballet is best known for
its production of "The Green Table,"
a satire on the League of Nations.
This composition is so powerful that
when the company toured the Orient
last year, the Japanese government
forbade its presentation. Kurt Joass,
the director, refused to comply, and
the tour was canceled as a result.

the Postal Telegraph Company's
main office here was settled late to
day when the management granted

Association sole collective bargain
ing rights.
