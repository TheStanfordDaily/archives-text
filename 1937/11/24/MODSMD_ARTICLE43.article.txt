# Scientists Will Meet at Farm
## 
### 
Physicists from the Pacific Coast
will meet at Stanford December 17
and 18, for a semi-annual meeting of
the American Physical Society.
Dr. R. A. Millikun, famed scientist,
has co-authored a paper on cosmic
ray effects on the lower atmosphere,
which he may present in pei'son.
Fellow workers at the California In
stitute of Technology collaborated on
the research.
Stanford faculty members who
will present papers include Norris
E. Bradbury, Cornelis Bole, and Ar
nold Siegert. Professor Paul Kirk
patrick, local secretary of the Soci
ety, announced that reports on origi
nal research by other members will
be in the fields of atomic nuclei,
spectroscopy, and ionization.
Mr. Bole will demonstrate the re
sults of his work with mercury-arc
lighting. His lamps, which are small
for the high intensity which they
produce, are powerful enough to
serve as searchlights, and are ex
pected to have important practical
applications.
