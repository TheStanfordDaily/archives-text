NEARLY 200 students of Beloit College, Beloit, Wis., mostly girls, were bruised and shaken when their
special train, returning from a football game with University of Chicago, was wrecked as it crushed
into a stalled automobile near Morton Grove, 111. The locomotive turned over, as above, injuring the re
man, probably fatally.
