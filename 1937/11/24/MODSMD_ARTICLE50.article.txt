# Missouri Travels Far To Lead Iron Squads
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Never let it lie said that fooitjmllers can't take it.
It is a mere nothing f«»r the hoys who handle the pigskin to go out five
afternoons per week and heat each other to a veritable pulp. And it isn't
much of a workout to tear around a stadium come each Saturday for
some GO minutes. •
But let praise, orchids, and cheers be flung to the high heavens for these
iron men who play more than one game a week—that's really something.
Take San Jose State, Frinstance. Not very long ago they played three
games in eight days. But that feat disappears into ultra-black oblivion

when this week's case of super-hu-
I manism is discussed.
Two Games Coming
Missouri plays Kansas tomorrow
i in their last home game of the sea
son. Then on Saturday the Missou
ri ans are due in Los Angeles to meet
U.C.L.A. Which means, by very easy
reasoning, that team has to do a lot
of stepping to keep its dates. Travel
j ing 2000 miles in two days is enough
! to lay an ordinary guy very low.
But flip a couple of tough football
j games on each end of that 2000 miles
and you've got something. So, Mr.
j Head Chipper-outer, please carve
I another niche in the football Hall of
I Fame for that Missouri eleven. They
I deserve it.
Sparse Calendar
| Speaking o£ traveling, we notice
i that intersectional tilts headline this
| week's sparse grid calendar as the
! majority of the nation's teams wind
I up their schedules.
| The Trojans play their traditional
killer-diller of a battle with the
Fighting Irish in South Bend. And,
although dire results are most likely
in store for Howard Jones & Co.,
U.S.C. has never failed to really play
ball against Notre Dame. The Irish
! have been an up-and-down team
j this season; Troy has been mostly
J down. But MAYBE Ainby Schindler
will really roll. And MAYBE Andy
Puplis will snag passes all over the
i lot. So watch out for this one. It's
f a battle.
I And it will be a good idea also to
j keep your radio going on the two
Eastern games which will have plen
) ty to do with the third party on that
triple-date with, the football babe
of-the-year: Rosie Bowl. These two
| clashes bring together Pittsburgh
! and Duke, and Fordham and NY.U.
Pitt-Duke
Both Pitt and Fordham are being
boomed heavily for the trip West,
j since the only blotch on their rcc
i ords is their own scoreless tie. In
Duke, the Panthers meet one of the
South's top teams. Fordham should
| not have much trouble with NY.U.
| and perhaps a lot will hinge on how
| much of a show the two powerhouse
| elevens put on.
No Coast Conference games are
listed, but Oregon treks to San Diego
i to meet the Marines, who have no
doubt long since landed and con
j trolled the situation. But whether or
j not they can control Joe Graybeal's
passes remains to be seen. If Ore
i gon wins, that will be the deciding
factor.
