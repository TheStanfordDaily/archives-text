# Net Wins Scored By Ballard, Lundy
## 
### 
Frosh Neil Ballard and Jim Lundy
scored victories last week and en -
tered the quarter-final round of the
Hahn Novice Tennis Tournament.
Remaining fourth round matches
are to be played this week.
Both Ballard and Lundy are listed
in the top six on the frosh ladder
and one of them should go through
to the finals of the present tourna
ment. Ballard easily won from
Charles Smith 6-2, 6-4, and Lundy
overcame Carleton Yoder 6-0, 15-6,
6-0.
The following matches are to be
run off this week: A1 Whittell vs.
John Lyons, Syd Terry vs. Roger
Matthews, Ed Detrick vs. C. W.
Patterson, Ed Leßaker vs. Stan
Owen, Al Rose vs. George Cadwala
der, and Gary Ellis vs. Ned Ishii.

In their last scheduled game, San
ta Clara will dump Gonzaga HARD.
Buck Shaw will probably order his
Broncs to really pour it on, for it's
the last chance they have to show
the country and the moguls who
run the Sugar Bowl what they can
do. Hang on tight.
It's a fine day indeed when Loyola
doesn't meet some opponent from
far, far away. They've had four in
tersectional games so far and here
comes their fifth. This time Villa
nova comes We*t to meet ihe Lions,
and all indications point to eleven
bearded pussy-cats as a result.
Toss-up Here
Michigan State is another team on
ihe run. They come to San Fran
cisco to play ball with the Dons of
U.S.F. The result? A toss-up.
There's another candidate — al
though not such a popular one at
recent, bull sessions—for Rose Bowl
honors. Alabama is the one. This
Saturday the Crimson Tide hits
Vanderbilt. The Commodores have
a very powerful aggregation—noth
ing to be merely taken in stride.
Alabama has had several close ones
and may get another very bad fright
before they walk off the field from
this game.
That winds up this week's round
up, gang. Don't bet too much money.
