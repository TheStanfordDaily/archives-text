# Alpha Delta Takes Volleyball Pennant
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi won the first all-University volleyball championship
in Stanford history last night when they defeated Phi Kappa Sigina 15-4,
15-6 in the final game of a five weeks' season.
The Alpha Delts, though the game was not as one-sided as the score
indicates, were never in trouble after the opening volleys had relaxed the
| pie-game and early play tension. They stood for some time 1-2, then

! 2-all, and then 3-2, after which thfc<
winners stepped ahead rapidly to
the the first game.
In the second, Phi Kappa Sigma
, led briefly in the opening stages,
' running to 4 points while the cham
! pions were winning one, after which
! the Alpha Delts made a quick
| splurge up to 7-4. Here the advan
tage 'swayed back and forth for half
| a-dozen serves, fallowed by an ef
fective Alpha Delt rally which rap
idly ran out the game, match, and
j tournament.
Vise Five Men
The champions played the entire
| match with five men, H. B. Lee hav
! ing incurred a sprained ankle last
J week. The winners' board of strat-
I egy deemed it wisest not to substi
! tute a weak man for him.
Braly and Seaver were again out-
J standing for the Alpha Delts, as they
have been throughout the season,
j Their kills were untouchable, and
: their backcourt play efficient. Stoe
i fen, too, deserves credit as an up
court man, together with having the
| best serve on either team.

For Phi Kappa Sigma, Casamajor,
| Ellington, Gill, and Rouverol all
j seemed amazingly adept at saving
many, many deadly Alpha Delt kills,
; and it was only the work of these
1 and Grossman while close to the
' floor that prevented the score from
being worse than it was.
The winners will receive 40 points
'on the all-year intramural score
j chart, the losers 35. All league win
ners will be awarded 30, with a
j .sliding scale for other league mem
| bers. No team which did not play
j an entire season will receive points.
Phil Klauber, manager, announces
| that scoring for football and volley
ball has already been posted on the
intramural board; golf and horse
shoes returns will go up at the end
of next week, by which time finals
and consolation matches in both j
those sports must be reported.

Alpha Delta Phi won the first all-University volleyball championship
in Stanford history last night when they defeated Phi Kappa Sigina 15-4,
15-6 in the final game of a five weeks' season.
The Alpha Delts, though the game was not as one-sided as the score
indicates, were never in trouble after the opening volleys had relaxed the
| pie-game and early play tension. They stood for some time 1-2, then

! 2-all, and then 3-2, after which thfc<
winners stepped ahead rapidly to
the the first game.
In the second, Phi Kappa Sigma
, led briefly in the opening stages,
' running to 4 points while the cham
! pions were winning one, after which
! the Alpha Delts made a quick
| splurge up to 7-4. Here the advan
tage 'swayed back and forth for half
| a-dozen serves, fallowed by an ef
fective Alpha Delt rally which rap
idly ran out the game, match, and
j tournament.
