BUFFALO, N.Y., Nov. 23 (UP).â€”
Henry Armstrong, world's feather
weight champion, ruled a heavy
favorite today in his 10-round non
title bout with Joey Brown of Syra
cuse tonight.
The California negro has had light
workouts here for the past two days.

campaign of recent months in
which he knocked out 23 of his
last 24 opponents.
