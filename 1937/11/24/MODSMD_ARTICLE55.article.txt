OUR FRIEND TONER
IS IN AGAIN
I hate to keep dragging our i
friend Dick Toner, the Daily Cal |
sports editor, into this column, but I
Dick's childish prattle makes good
copy at times.
He claims that Tiny Thornhill j
stated dial Bear flankman Will
Dolman was the weakest link in ;
the California line-up. Toner i
claims that the Bears have no 5
weaknesses and that "Tiny's state
ment is like his excuses for tie- j
feat ... a lot of hooey."
The Cal rabble rouser is a fine
one to be talking about hooey . . .
it's certainly news to us that Tiny
had any excuse for losing the Big
Game. Tiny admitted that the Bears j
had the best team, as any sane in
dividual would.
SOME STATISTICS
TO BORE YOU
Just to pass the time away and
fill up space in this trying colyum,
let's look at the figures for the en
tire season for the Bears and the
Indians on the football turf.
The Californians piled up 1(566
yards on the ground against 1126
for the Stanfords. Bear opponents
were only able to gain 701 yards,
while the Indian opposition amassed
a total of 1051.
The Indians outgained the Bears
through the air, 372-347. Bear op
ponents took to the air for 334 yards,
while the Indian adversaries totaled
34(5.
SI ill further figures show the
Indians to have more of a passing
attack than the Bears. The Stan
lords threw 64 passes and com
pleted 25. while the Californians
were getting only 18 for (12 yards.
The Bears fell one short of mak
ing it 100 first downs for the sea
son. while the Cards were getting
63 first downs. Bear opponents
piled lip 43 and (he Indian op
ponents accounted for 67 first
downs.
The Cards were only able to put
across 9 touchdowns against the op
position's (i. The Bears crossed the
enemy goal line 21 times, while said
enemies were making but four
tallies.
Incidentally, the Bear first-string
backfield consists of three men, all
of whom have packed that apple for
a better average than four yards per
play for the entire season. Vic Bot
tari, Dave Anderson, and Sam Chap
man are the boys.
LITTLE RED ROLLER
SHOULD WHIP LIONS
Tiny's little red roller should
murder the Columbia Lions in the
j'jlo Grounds in New York Satur
day. They should, but if the jinx
holds out, they won't. The Indians
have met the Lions twice and both
times have been heavy favorites,
but both times they lost to give Co
lumbia's Lou Little more to chirp
about and to give the public more
magazine articles on "How We Did
It—By Lou Little."
If the game this year is football
and not ice hockey as last year, I
look for the Indians (o triumph by
13 prints. Let's hope the boys
won't be leoking too far out of
the eastern cold toward (he tropic
warmth of Hawaii.
There are lour California teams
mixed up in intersectional battles
this week-end. Stanford should win.
The U.C.L.A. Bruins will snap out
of their hibernation long enough to
win one from a none-too-strong
Missouri eleven. The Trojans of
U.S.C. will take it on the chin by
possibly two touchdowns at the
hands of Notre Dame, while the
S.F.U. Dons should drop one to
Michigan State.

LITTLE RED ROLLER
SHOULD WHIP LIONS
Tiny's little red roller should
murder the Columbia Lions in the
j'jlo Grounds in New York Satur
day. They should, but if the jinx
holds out, they won't. The Indians
have met the Lions twice and both
times have been heavy favorites,
but both times they lost to give Co
lumbia's Lou Little more to chirp
about and to give the public more
magazine articles on "How We Did
It—By Lou Little."
If the game this year is football
and not ice hockey as last year, I
look for the Indians (o triumph by
13 prints. Let's hope the boys
won't be leoking too far out of
the eastern cold toward (he tropic
warmth of Hawaii.
There are lour California teams
mixed up in intersectional battles
this week-end. Stanford should win.
The U.C.L.A. Bruins will snap out
of their hibernation long enough to
win one from a none-too-strong
Missouri eleven. The Trojans of
U.S.C. will take it on the chin by
possibly two touchdowns at the
hands of Notre Dame, while the
S.F.U. Dons should drop one to
Michigan State.

OUR FRIEND TONER
IS IN AGAIN
I hate to keep dragging our i
friend Dick Toner, the Daily Cal |
sports editor, into this column, but I
Dick's childish prattle makes good
copy at times.
He claims that Tiny Thornhill j
stated dial Bear flankman Will
Dolman was the weakest link in ;
the California line-up. Toner i
claims that the Bears have no 5
weaknesses and that "Tiny's state
ment is like his excuses for tie- j
feat ... a lot of hooey."
The Cal rabble rouser is a fine
one to be talking about hooey . . .
it's certainly news to us that Tiny
had any excuse for losing the Big
Game. Tiny admitted that the Bears j
had the best team, as any sane in
dividual would.
SOME STATISTICS

Just to pass the time away and
fill up space in this trying colyum,
let's look at the figures for the en
tire season for the Bears and the

The Californians piled up 1(566
yards on the ground against 1126
for the Stanfords. Bear opponents
were only able to gain 701 yards,
while the Indian opposition amassed
a total of 1051.
The Indians outgained the Bears
through the air, 372-347. Bear op
ponents took to the air for 334 yards,
while the Indian adversaries totaled
34(5.
SI ill further figures show the
Indians to have more of a passing
attack than the Bears. The Stan
lords threw 64 passes and com
pleted 25. while the Californians
were getting only 18 for (12 yards.
The Bears fell one short of mak
ing it 100 first downs for the sea
son. while the Cards were getting
63 first downs. Bear opponents
piled lip 43 and (he Indian op
ponents accounted for 67 first
downs.
