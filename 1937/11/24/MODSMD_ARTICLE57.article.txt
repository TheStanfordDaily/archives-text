# Cardinal Waterdogs Lose Final To Bears
## Maurer Stars In Papoose Double Kill Lamb Succeeds Hanna As Squad Captain; Touted Defense Fails 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Stanford ended one of its most dis
astrous water polo seasons yesterday
with a 7 to 1 loss to California at
Berkeley.
The win assured the Bears of at
least a tie for the conference title
and dropped Stanford into no better
than a last-place tie.
Captain Bill Hanna, playing his
final game for Stanford, scored the
lone Indian goal. Collins ol Califor
nia rolled up four scores to lead the
Bears.
The Indian frosh culminated a
highly successful season with a 3 to 1
pasting of the Bear Cubs. The
Papoose thus marked up their fifth
victory in a row and completed a
double killing of the Cal frosh. They
defeated the Cubs 2 to 1 last Friday.
Varsity Prospect
Captain Rix Maurer was again the
big gun for the yearlings and showed
himself to be a coming varsity pros
pect.
The touted Indian defense fell
down considerably over its showing
'in the past four games. Previously
the Stanford defense had held the
3ears to three goals.
Once again a poor offense failed
to chalk up more than one goal de
spite the fact that Hanna and, Johnny
Lamb were teamed in the front line.
Lamb Named Captain
Johnny Lamb was elected captain
jf the 1938 squad at a dinner held
after the game. Lamb succeeds Bill
Hanna, who as a junior was an All-
Coast forward and has been the
ream's main guiding strength this
year, playing in various positions.
Hanna's selection as an All-Coast
J man again this year might be ham
pered by the fact that he has played
four different spots in an attempt
jf Coach Nort Thornton to bolster
an apparently weak squad.
'Scoring Twins'
Lamb was likewise an All-Coast
forward last year and appears to be
well on his way to another honor
cost this season. Lamb has led the
Indians all year in scoring.
Teamed at forward last year, Lamb
and Hanna were dubbed the "Coast's
Scoring Twins." This year, however,
Hanna has been shifted about so
that the possibility of the two men
igain leading the league in scoring
was lessened to a marked degree.
