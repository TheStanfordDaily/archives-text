By BOB IRELAND

When Dartmouth walloped Columbia 27-0 last Saturday, it marked
the ail-time low in Lou Little's career, as i( was the first time in his 17
years of coaching that a Little team had Ios( five games in one season.

Moreover, it was the worst defeat {
that Columbia had absorbed since
1930.
This game was the culmination of
a hard-luck season that started
when Army nosed out the Blue and
White, 21-18, by virtue of a 93-yard
runback of a pass interception.
Brown toppled Columbia two
weeks later by a one-point margin,
although outgained 4 yards to 1. A
decisive defeat by Cornell. 14-0, was
followed by a loss to Navy that might
have been a victory, had the Morn
ingsiders gotten a few breaks.
Rccord Uninspiring
Therefore, Columbia will line up
at the kick-off Saturday with only
two wins over mediocre Williams
and Penn and a hollow tie with
Syracuse to their credit. It is ob
vious where the underdog's psycho
logical advantage will rest. A shade
too much overconfidence on Stan
ford's part, a little luck on Colum
bia's and a crushing upset may be
scored.
On the other hand, the Indians
have a chance to enhance their na
tional prestige by equalling or sur
passing Dartmouth's score of 27-0,
a feat of which I believe them ca
pable il!Â«jGrant Stone will gamble a

bit on passes, and if Tiny is saga
cious enough to let Pete Fay play
almost all the game.
Ends Bigger
Columbia's opening line-up will
include Radvillas and Siegel at the
ends, provided that the former re
covers from injuries sustained in the
Navy game. These boys are bigger
than the Stanford ends and belter
pass catchers. Schultze, another
6-foot 3-inch end, will start if Rad
villas is not ready to go.
Snavely and Co-captain Bateman
will start at tackle. Snavely is a
195-pound substitute who is taking
the place of Wright, whose injuries
have put him on the shelf for this
season.
I predict either a 20-0 Stanford
victory, or a 12-7 defeat depend
ing on whether or not our ends
rush Luckman. The only safe pre
diction to make on this contest,
however, is that it will snow or rain,
| and that we will make more yards
| than Columbia. We always do.
