# Pitt, Fordham Eligible For Bowl Games
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 23 (UP).—Pitts
burgh and Fordham stood out today
among 24 Bowl candidates as the
key teams to the New Year's Day
post-season football games.
The Panthers and the Rams who
played a scoreless tie with each
other and won all the rest of their
games, are under consideration for
ail four major Bowl games—Rose,
Sugar, Cotton and Orange. Each
has one game left, Pitt with Duke,
at Durham, N.C., and Fordham with
New York U. at New York.
It seems fairly certain that either
Pitt or Fordham, provided they win
their final tests, will meet Califor
nia, already named to represent the
West ,in the Rose Bowl game at
Pasadena. Pitt apparently has the
inside track despite the fact that
California authorities confused the
situation by announcing that the
! eastern school picked must have
1 standards similar to California's.
1 Members of the California squad
picked Pitt in a straw vote.
There is a possibility that Pitt,
! even if selected, may not go to the
; Rose Bowl. Last year Pitt was in
\ vited to the Sugar Bowl game at
j New Orleans before getting the Rose
| Bowl bid. Pittsburgh authorities
! may feel that they owe something
Ito the Sugar Bowl for turning
! down last year's bid. In addition,
j the shorter distance to travel
j would be a factor.
A Pitt-Alabama game in the Su
gar Bowl would overshadow the
Rose Bowl attraction regardless of
what eastern team California se
lected.
