## Stanford Was Lucky – This Time 
### 
DURING the week ending last Saturday, the
Administration, Men's Council, student
loaders, and The Daily sat around with their
fingers crossed. They were sitting on a powder
keg and the Frosh were playing with fire. There
was a collective sigh of relief when the game
Saturday put the fire out.
The reason The Daily merely sat around, and
it's probably the reason for the postures of the
others, should be told. It will probably answer
the question of a member of the Administration
who called The Daily last Thursday night.
The Daily didn't condemn raids on the Cal
campus because it thought that would do no
good.
To tell the Frosh that excursions to Berkeley
were absolutely wrong would be to tell them
something new, something that was contrary
to what they had heard and read. To tell them
to behave themselves, if they did go, and not
to injure persons or property would be in line
with what they had heard all their lives.
So The Daily asked that they act like gentle
men, though a fine case can be briefed on the
point that the only good raid is no raid at all.
But this was a practical case. Injury is the
difference between a raid that causes trouble
and one that doesn't. The practical solution
seemed to be to apply an old taboo to the situ
ation. Cal seemingly co-operated by leaving the
Big "C" unguarded. Most of the thrill of antici

pated conflict was taken away.
This, possibly, is the best long-run policy. It
is more workable than outright, dogmatic ban
ning of raids, because it takes advantage of
social sanctions against violence.
Application of the extreme penalty—expul
sion of raid participants —might work up to a
certain point. That point would probably be
reached about the time the bonfire was being
built. Interested Cal students would drop around
to see how it was going, perhaps to set fire to
it. Even if they failed there, they would fire
up the frosh.
The absolute prohibition would hold the frosh
steam for a while, but resentment against it
would add to the flames beneath the boiler.
Finally, in all probability, a large group would
coalesce, and, feeling security in numbers,
would make the trip anyway.
Of course, raids can be stopped by removing
their cause, Big Game spirit. But the only v/ay
to kill that is to kill the Big Game rivalry, built
up in the last 42 years. And the only way to
kill Big Game rivalry is to call off the Big Game.
That obviously won't be done.
So there the situation remains, and that's
probably where it will remain.
Probably next November, and a lot of No
vembers after that, The Daily, the Administra
tion, and other interested parties still will be
sitting cross-fingered on the same game-spirit
powder keg—watching the Encina torch.—L. L.
