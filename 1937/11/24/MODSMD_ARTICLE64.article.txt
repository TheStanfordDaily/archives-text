WHILE Chicago University has been setting
the pace for America's progressive educa
tors, fhe "Windy City's" high schools have been
bogging down under political boondoggling
and neglect. Now a complete revision of policy
announced in Time indicates that the high
schools, too, will soon be setting pace for the
nation's educators —but whether in the right
direction or not is guestionable.
Instead of offering an 80 per cent academic
curriculum, Chicago's 37 high schools will be
reorganized so that in five years 80 per cent of
the courses offered will be along vocational
lines.
Henceforth Chicago's 130,000 high school
students, of whom only 6 per cent go to college,
will pay little heed to acquiring cultural back
ground; will instead start at an average age of
14 to train for their vocation-to-be.
A few of the almost essential academic
courses, such as English, still will be compul
sory, but for the rest —the students will be given

"what they want," according to the originator
of the plan, Superintendent of Schools William
Harding Johnson.
If the plan is put through, it will mean that
high school students will be little different from
apprentices. Their education will be narrow
and one-sided, and they will not be fitted in any
way to met success once they have caught up
with it.
Prepared solely along vocational lines, stu
dents without money to go to college v/ill be
like so many robots. Culturally standardized in
a little rut, not at the top, but at the bottom of
the vast middle classes, these students will en
counter a widening gulf between themselves
and the so-called upper classes, which have
been able to afford a balanced education.
Generally accepted, the Chicago system
might lead to a moneyed intelligentsia, whose
ranks would be impenetrable to those whose
birthright did not entitle them to a college
education.
Instead of furthering democracy, as is said to
be intended, the plan might easily result in a
workers' class from which there is no egress, to
which certain classes would be destined from
birth. It is a dangerous experiment which
should be handled with kid gloves.—J. R.
