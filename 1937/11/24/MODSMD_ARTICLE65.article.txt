THE MUSIC WENT DOWN ANI) OUT
VJOMEWHERE on this campus there are half a dozen
men wasting $115 a quarter plus syllabus fees that
would do a great deal more good if used to buy foot
warmers for the esquimaux. The boys are those un
knowns involved in the criminal assault case on the
Nitery gramaphone. It is depressing to think that
they are paying to go to college, and yet refuse to
learn the first principles of economics, psychology, or
engineering .
The ravishment of the record-player is in itself a
sad story. When the Nitery was established to give
mental rest to all who were heavy laden with assign
ments, it was equipped with a gramaphone that
equalled those of the Peninsula's finest bars. It crouch
ed in the corner, and for a nickel, lovers of discord
could induce it to render anything from Goodman
dish-pannery to Wayne King wolf-howling.

In the course of time, this a'tar to the God of
swing became slightly unpopular. It sat there like
Moloch with the colored lights playing upon it, ever
demanding more and more sacrifices. And then one
night half a dozen roughs assaulted it. They bent the
coin chute and used one nickel to play the poor
victim to exhaustion. The next day it was repaired,
the mechanics encountering some difficulty due to the
fact that the attackers had attempted to replace the
parts and had accidentally included a door stop.
Shortly afterward the crime was repeated; avail
able supplies of patience dwindled. And now the
gramaphone is out of circulation. Anybody who wants
music has to sprain an arm hunting for it on the
radio.

r PHE loss of our beloved little old music box is sad,
of course. But most of us will be able to bear
up under it. Life offers many compensations, and
doubtless we shall be able to worry along without
music that sounds like a couple of sabre toothed Jigers
having it out with a dinosaur.
What depresses me is the unavoidable conclusion
that about six Stanford men arc cluttering up the
Bawlout and paying tuition without getting anything
out of college. In Econ I they told us that a business
project must pay if it is to be continued. In Psych we
learned that patience goes just so far.
The philosophy department teaches that it's a
hell of a note when a selfish minority chisels the
majority out of its rights. And the engineering majors
toll me that the gramaphone assaulters did a fright
fully messy and amateurish job.

Obviously the boys have learned nothing in the
whole time they have been in college. Apparently
they haven't been to chapel either. Dr. Trueblood
would not approve.
And so, I would suggest to the men who assaulted
our dear gramaphone that they quietly pack their
suitcases and hunt up a good ditch digging job. But
before they go, I'd appreciate it if they'd tell me how
they passed the freshman intelligence test.

Post Script and not at all apropos of the above:
I know of a beautiful blonde damsel who wants a ride
to the city this afternoon. Kind souls with proper
recommendations may communicate with me this
morning after S o'clock.
