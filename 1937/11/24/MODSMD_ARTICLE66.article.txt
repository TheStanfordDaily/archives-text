According to the nice gentleman to the left of my
typewriter, Men's Council is planning to start pro
ceedings against a certain student found scalping
aspirin tablets in Toyon Hall Sunday morning.
The charge against the scalper will be conduct un
becoming a Stanford gentleman and shooting pains
within the confines of a wild life preserve.
The Council stands on the platform that we must
preserve our wild life here on the campus for the
benefit of future generations. On the other hand,
the Council would like to get a corner on the wild
life and hold it for high prices which, according to the
good book, may be either death or 75 hours at the
Convalescent Home.
Scalping sin is, therefore, an extremely engrossing
business for councilors. Like all scarcity, or monopoly
economics, however, this procedure undoubtedly leads
to a rise in the wages of sin, which means that the
demand will remain constant throughout industry
while the supply will fall off. This is liable, if carried
to the extreme, according to all our best economists,
to plunge our great nation into the pit of another
repression.
This i/pay seem a peculiar thing to be talking about
four days after the Bog Game, but it in reality has
nothing to do with that so-called affair. These remarks
are addressed solely to the students on behalf of the
administrative dryer-ups. They are meant to warn
the students about the impending acidosis tomorrow.
Students must remember that wheiever they are
eating tomorrow, they arc unofficial ambassadors of
the University, and that excessive indulgence in mus
tard, catsup, paprika, tabasco sauce, pepper, sloan's
liniment, gin or bitters at the family dinner table
can only reflect on the good name of the institution,
induce hardening of the arteries, botulism, at the age
of HO or above, will eventually lead to the grave
and the destruction of the endowment fund, the New
Theater, the University itself, and world civilization,
perhaps.
