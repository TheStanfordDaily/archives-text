# CAMPUS OPINION
## HE APOLOGIZES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I would like to apologize to The
Daily at large and to Mr. Drury in
particular for being partly respon
sible for writing "Subway Serenade"
which, in the words of friend Drury,
"smacked strongly of some other
tune whose name this reviewer can
not remember."
My collaborator, Art Spaulding,
would also apologize, 1 am sure, but
he is hiding his shame in Hartford,
Conn., at the moment. However, 1
am sure that 1 can get Henry King
to express his regrets along with
mine. Mr. King, who conducts an
orchestra in San Francisco, was
foolish enough to make a special
request for an orchestration of this
number.
1 am afraid that 1 cannot get the
Federal Government to apologize for
granting me a copyright on the tune
several months ago, as they are
funny about those things. However,
1 will gladly refund their money to
the people, only a few of whom
were my relatives, who were kind
enough to phone or telegraph about
the number.
All I ask in return is that Mr.
Drury enlighten the campus as to
what "tune" "Subway Serenade"
"smacks of."
Sincerely,
Bob Ireland
