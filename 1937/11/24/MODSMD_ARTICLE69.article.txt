# SPIRIT KILLED?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The new theater is mighty nice,
and all that, but it has had one
deleterious effect which no one
foresaw: it has entirely killed the
Gaieties spirit.
The rough, too far away to pitch
pennies, feels out of place in his
new surroundings. The spirit of the
j evening is that of the smoothy and
1 his "new woman" date, not that of
j "To Hell with Cal!"
Gone, and sadly missed, is that
rousing spirit of yesteryear that
j made every Gaielies, no matter how
I bad, good.
Gone even from the script is ref
erence to the Big Game. Only one

such crack could my ears detect in
Friday's show.
Where is that old Stanford spirit
that made the Assembly Hall quiver
as 1700 roughs and co-eds roared in
unison with Winstead Weaver's
"Nuts to Cal!"?
Where is that communal feeling
bred in every Gaieties audience of
other years by the hoary traditions
of that well-worn barn?
Gone — vanquished by the suave
dignity of Memorial Hall. Dignity
and the Gaieties? Preposterous!
Stanford, shed a tear —a tear for
the Gaieties that will never be
again.
