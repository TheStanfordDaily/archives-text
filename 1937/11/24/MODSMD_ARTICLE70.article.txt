# Gigli, Tenor, Disappointing In New Film
## 
### 
"Forever Yours" (Mayfield The
ater) is just inexcusable. It's an
other example of the fact that movie
producers haven't yet been able to
star great opera signers without
either making them sing second
rate songs written especially for the
picture, or boring the audience by
inserting their singing into a me
diocre picture.
Benjamino Gigli, great operatic
tenor, is the victim in this case. The

picture is the most
pitiful hod g e -
podge of latter -
day rubbish that
has been forced
on the public for
some time. It
might possibly be
excused on the
grounds that Gigli
is allowed to sing
Italian love songs
and snatches of

arias from several operas. But the
recording is none too good, and the
theater's reproduction doesn't help
the situation any.
The cast includes some brute,
whom you would like to smack in
the face, and a rather wistful young
lady who just about wists your pa
tience away. Perhaps if they had let
Gigli handle the acting as well as the
singing things might have been bet
ter, for he has a certain amount of
charm, as well as a wonderful voice.
Don't let yourself be drawn by
promises of the Big Game pictures.
They are so dark that you can hard
ly see a thing. All in all, the pro
gram is rather unfortunate.
