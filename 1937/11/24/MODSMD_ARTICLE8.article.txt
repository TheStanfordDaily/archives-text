# STUDENTS POISONED Big Game Celebrants Ailing

### 
Approximately 40 Stanford stu
dents are reported ill with food
poisoning, apparently one of the in
direct results of the Big Game.
Thirteen of the cases were re
ported by Dr. Thomas Storey, and six
to Dr. Helen B. Pryor. None of them
are severe. Those attacked will "just
feel pretty uncomfortable for a
couple of days." Most of the victims
are not bed-ridden.
The poisoning is accredited by
the "sufferers" to cocktails eaten at
a Monterey hotel during Big Game
celebrations. Only people who ate

the cocktails have been sick. In one
sorority, for instance, three women
ate shrimp, four ate fruit cocktails.
Three are ill.
Two men are reported in the Men's
Rest Home from the poisoning, but
no poison cases in the Women's Rest
Rome.
Twenty-five men in four houses
are ill. In one house alone 10 men
were victims. The Daily check-up
found 14 women in six sororities,
and five Roble women, were stricken.
B.A.C. officials have reported the
poisoning to the Monterey County
health department.
