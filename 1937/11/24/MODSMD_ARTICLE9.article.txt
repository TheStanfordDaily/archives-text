# Hemingway Film Set for Showing
## 
### 
A motion picture which Time, Es
quire, and the New Yorker call "an
outstanding contribution to cinema
art"—"The Spanish Earth" —will be
screened next Monday night at
Blanco's Mountain View Theater,
sponsored by the Medical Bureau to
Aid Spanish Democracy.
Photographed by Joris Ivis, famed
Dutch photographer, "The Spanish
Earth" was produced in Spain last
spring by two famous American
authors, Ernest Hemingway and
John Dos Passos. Hemingway also
wrote a dramatic commentary which
he speaks as a background to the
film and its music.
This notable documentary film
deals not with war itself but with
the sociological effects of war on
the civilian nation of Spain. Tickets
will be sold at the Engineering Cor
ner all day Monday.
