# Rebels Bomb Small Towns In Air Raid
## Spain Awaits 'Big Push' From Franco Forces As Villages Attacked 
### 
MADRID, Nov. 28 (UP).â€”Gener
alissimo Francisco Franco's rebel air
raiders tonight swept over Loyalist
areas north of Madrid, unloading
tons of explosives on Colmenar and
other smaller towns within a radius
of 50 miles of the capital.
At least 50 were killed when a
squad of black-winged bombers
roared over Colmenar late this af
ternoon and then passed eastward
over other towns.
The insurgent planes were heard
over Madrid as they headed north
ward early this afternoon and a
staccato of anti-aircraft fire broke
the Sunday afternoon calm for
promenading Madrilenos.
Madrid in Panic
For a quarter of an hour the
anti-aircraft guns barked periodic
ally, then became silent. A few min
utes later the planes passed over
Colmenar, 30 kilometers north of
Madrid, and poured a terrific charge
into the town.
Sections of Madrid, where the en
emy air squadron was heard, al
though the planes could not be seen
due to murky skies, were in panic
for a few moments, as reports spread
that the raiders were attacking the
city.
Guadalajara Attacked
The raids followed attacks on a
half dozen towns north of Madrid,
including Guadalajara where the
insurgent armies were routed in
last summer's ill-fated "big push"
on the capital.
The planes passed over the towns
of Terancon, Santa Cruz de la Zarza,
Ermitadenianzares, Chinchon and
Ocana. One person was killed at
Chinchon and 17 wounded. At
Ocana and on the Toledo sector, at
least 18 persons were killed, scores
wounded and many houses de
stroyed.
'Big Push' Awaited
The village of Colmenar was al
most destroyed by the raiders. More
than 100 were wounded, and there
was hardly a block in the town that
was not hit by shells.
Meanwhile reports from the north
indicated nationalist planes were
keeping almost constantly in action
to forestall enemy raids that might
uncover important information on
troop movements.
There seemed little doubt that
both sides were preparing for the
long - awaited "big push" which
Franco has been threatening since
mid-October.
