"Stanford University has the most
honest group of students that I have
ever seen," says Paul Brewer,
branch manager of the Postal Tele
graph station in the Union. "Look
at those five nickels. No one ever
steals them, and if they are used to
telephone the Palo Alto station, they
are always promptly repaid the next
day."
Brewer, who has had experience
at Missouri University and numer
ous educational institutions on the
Pacific Coast, stated that the Stan
ford student is becoming more and
more wire conscious.
Wires Increasing
"At first, the students didn't send
many wires because they seemed to
feel that the station wasn't going to
be permanent. Now, however, they
have realized that we are going to
be here all the time, and conse
quently the number of wires being
sent is constantly getting larger."
At present the number of wires
being sent daily is about 15, and all
the wires emanating from the Union
carry the legend, "Stanford Univer
isty" on them, not Palo Alto, as
many students believe.

According to Brewer, the Postal
Telegraph recognizes Stanford Uni
versity as a city, completely sepa
rated from Palo Alto, and plans as
soon as the business warrants it, in
stalling a telegraphic printer. This
means that wires to Stanford stu
dents will be sent directly to the
university, and will insure quicker
delivery for students.
Follow Season
As a rule the wires follow sea
sonal activities. At present the
greatest number going out refer to
Big Game. Students often rush to
send a wire saying they passed an
examination that they thought they
failed. Contrary to the general
opinion, the number of wires that
are sent asking for money are sur
prisingly small. As a rule, men
send out more telegrams than wom
en, but that is probably because the
percentage of men is greater.
The funniest telegram that Brewer
could remember was one sent by a
disgruntled rooter after the U.S.C.
game to a Stanfoi'd pal. The tele
gram read: "Foo Foo Foo Foo Foo
Foo Foo Foo Foo Foo."
Ten words of explicit disgust, and
it was unsigned.
