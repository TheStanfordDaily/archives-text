Margaret Armstrong of San Mateo
J. C. was leader of the discussion
on "Neutrality in the Pacific"; Doro
thy Fields, a Stanford student, head
ed the group on "Philippine Inde
pendence"; and Dr. Jean Pajus, pro
fessor of International Law at U.S.F.
led the discussion of "Racial Prob
lems in the Pacific."
The conference was completely
organized and planned by students,
since the Institute is a student or
ganization. The officers which were
selected for the coming year were:
Chairman Stanley Ahlborn, Califor
nia; vice-chairman, Joyce Hickox,
Mills; secretary, Margaret Rockwell,
Mills; business manager, Sam Le-
Count, California; and publicity
chairman, Dorothy Fields, Stanford.
Many of the delegates to the con
ference felt that the accommodations
were so fine at Lokoya Lodge that
it should be chosen for the confer
ence next year. However, selection
will not be made until after Christ
mas, when plans for the conference
will be started.
