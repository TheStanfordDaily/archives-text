# Britain, Italy To Talk Peace
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 28 (UP).—Britain
tonight made plans to invite Pre
mier Mussolini of Italy to join her
"informal" campaign to avert war
in Europe.
The maneuver came as Premier
Camille Chautemps of France was
en route to London to talk over the
European situation with Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain.
It was reported Britain desires to
approach Mussolini, immediately
after the Chautemps conversations,
with a view to discussions similar to
those between Viscount Halifax,
Lord President of the Council, and
Adolf Hitler in Berlin.
One of the purposes of Chautemps'
visit to London presumably is to
talk over the results of the Halifax-
Hitler conversations, and let Britain
know just how far France was pre
pared to go.
