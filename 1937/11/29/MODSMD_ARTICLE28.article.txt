# Little Red Holler Stalled In Lion's Den With 0-0 Tie
## Indians Shine as Individual Stars; ShOW Lack of Team Spirit 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Where is that old Stanford spirit?
For weeks we have fooled ourselves into thinking we had a better
team than records show, constantly dismissing the hidden feeling that
something was missing—team spirit.
Although we cannot go too far by what we hear until the hoys get
hack, it appeared to he the "handwriting on the wall" when eleven fine

•ball players could not work well
enough together to break a scoreless
tie with a supposedly inferior Co
lumbia outfit which had been over
powered week after week by nearly
all the teams encountered.

The Stanford boys> cannot be
blamed for feeling low after the
cancellation of their Hawaiian trip,
and nobody expected them to re
main at their Big Game peak. But
there was something more that held
them back. Who is to blame nobody
can say for sure.
Individuals Star
While the Big Red Machine could
not function as a whole, almost ev
ery one of the eleven cogs worked
smoothly throughout the game. Most
of them were individual sensations.
Few ball players have shown
greater skill and greater diversity
than Stanford's own Peter Fay. One
test of a good football player is the
way he acts in emergencies, and
Coach Tiny Thornhill's greatest
worry over Fay was at one time that
the light fast halfback was so jit
tery from game-consciousness that
he could not handle himself under
adverse conditions. But Peter show
ed the husky mentor.
Fay Conies Through
Peter revived what appeared to
be Stanford s traditional second-half
fire by returning the kickoff to mid
field. Later in the third quarter, Art
Radvilas, of the Lions, caught a pass
from Sid Luckman, deep in his own
territory, and carried it right
through ten Card defenders. Fay
stood on the 50, the last man to be
met by the Columbia end, and pin
ned him in the open field.
Later, when Paulman fumbled on
his own 20. Peter met the emergency
by picking up the ball, planning his
own play, and running for what was
a cinch touchdown. But Referee
W. H. Friessel, the most unpopular
man at Stanford today, split hairs
on the out-of-bounds ruling, and
gave Fay only a four-yard gain.
Sensational Play
It was in the fourth quarter that
Peter proved himself for all time by
the most sensational escape of the
season. Standing in a puddle of water
beneath his own goal-posts, Fay's
punt was ruined by a bad pass from
center, and he began to run to the
I starboard to prevent a safety for
I Columbia. He was met there by the
enemy, and cut back. Faced on the
other side by the rest of the de
fense, he booted the ball on the
dead run and placed it safely out
of bounds on the 40-yard stripe.
Bill Paulman also faced an emer
gency to keep the Columbia score
to zero. When the fine Luckman-
R-advilas passing combination was a
sure bet for a touchdown in the
first quarter, Paulman loomed on the
5-yard line, intercepted the pass, and
carried the ball 23 yards to the safe
side. Paulman also performed in ex
pert fashion as a passer, line-smash
er, and kicker.
Zagar Holds Line
It was Pete Zagar who held the
New Yorkers in their final aims at
the goal-line. Jack Naylor, of the
Lions, was touchdown-bound, when
the burly Card tackle stopped him
on the 7-yard line and then held fast
a line-punch. And finally, when the
Lions made their last desperate at
tempts, Pete ruined them with a se
ries of hard tackles.
Tackling was the Indians' long
suit. Tony Calvelli and Gene Cold
iron backed up the line in excel
lent fashion, while Bob Dakan,
Grant Stone, Ed Gamier, Bobby
Matthews, and Stan Andersen were
each responsible for several hard,
decisive tackles.
Jake Brigham, substituting for
Paulman at fullback, made some
good drives with the ball. Jim
Groves, on the bench with a cold,
was missed in the reverse plays.

Students were asked not to wear
cleats on their shoes to a recent
dance at Tulane University.

I Columbia. He was met there by the
enemy, and cut back. Faced on the
other side by the rest of the de
fense, he booted the ball on the
dead run and placed it safely out
of bounds on the 40-yard stripe.
Bill Paulman also faced an emer
gency to keep the Columbia score
to zero. When the fine Luckman-
R-advilas passing combination was a
sure bet for a touchdown in the
first quarter, Paulman loomed on the
5-yard line, intercepted the pass, and
carried the ball 23 yards to the safe
side. Paulman also performed in ex
pert fashion as a passer, line-smash
er, and kicker.
Zagar Holds Line
It was Pete Zagar who held the
New Yorkers in their final aims at
the goal-line. Jack Naylor, of the
Lions, was touchdown-bound, when
the burly Card tackle stopped him
on the 7-yard line and then held fast
a line-punch. And finally, when the
Lions made their last desperate at
tempts, Pete ruined them with a se
ries of hard tackles.
Tackling was the Indians' long
suit. Tony Calvelli and Gene Cold
iron backed up the line in excel
lent fashion, while Bob Dakan,
Grant Stone, Ed Gamier, Bobby
Matthews, and Stan Andersen were
each responsible for several hard,
decisive tackles.
Jake Brigham, substituting for
Paulman at fullback, made some
good drives with the ball. Jim
Groves, on the bench with a cold,
was missed in the reverse plays.

Students were asked not to wear
cleats on their shoes to a recent

While the Big Red Machine could
not function as a whole, almost ev
ery one of the eleven cogs worked
smoothly throughout the game. Most
of them were individual sensations.
Few ball players have shown
greater skill and greater diversity
than Stanford's own Peter Fay. One
test of a good football player is the
way he acts in emergencies, and
Coach Tiny Thornhill's greatest
worry over Fay was at one time that
the light fast halfback was so jit
tery from game-consciousness that
he could not handle himself under
adverse conditions. But Peter show
ed the husky mentor.
Fay Conies Through
Peter revived what appeared to
be Stanford s traditional second-half
fire by returning the kickoff to mid
field. Later in the third quarter, Art
Radvilas, of the Lions, caught a pass
from Sid Luckman, deep in his own
territory, and carried it right
through ten Card defenders. Fay
stood on the 50, the last man to be
met by the Columbia end, and pin
ned him in the open field.
Later, when Paulman fumbled on
his own 20. Peter met the emergency
by picking up the ball, planning his
own play, and running for what was
a cinch touchdown. But Referee
W. H. Friessel, the most unpopular
man at Stanford today, split hairs
on the out-of-bounds ruling, and
gave Fay only a four-yard gain.
Sensational Play
It was in the fourth quarter that
Peter proved himself for all time by
the most sensational escape of the
season. Standing in a puddle of water
beneath his own goal-posts, Fay's
punt was ruined by a bad pass from
center, and he began to run to the
I starboard to prevent a safety for
I Columbia. He was met there by the
enemy, and cut back. Faced on the
other side by the rest of the de

Few ball players have shown
greater skill and greater diversity
than Stanford's own Peter Fay. One
test of a good football player is the
way he acts in emergencies, and
Coach Tiny Thornhill's greatest
worry over Fay was at one time that
the light fast halfback was so jit
tery from game-consciousness that
he could not handle himself under
adverse conditions. But Peter show
ed the husky mentor.
Fay Conies Through
Peter revived what appeared to
be Stanford s traditional second-half
fire by returning the kickoff to mid
field. Later in the third quarter, Art
Radvilas, of the Lions, caught a pass
from Sid Luckman, deep in his own
territory, and carried it right
through ten Card defenders. Fay
stood on the 50, the last man to be
met by the Columbia end, and pin
ned him in the open field.
Later, when Paulman fumbled on
his own 20. Peter met the emergency
by picking up the ball, planning his
own play, and running for what was
a cinch touchdown. But Referee
W. H. Friessel, the most unpopular
man at Stanford today, split hairs
on the out-of-bounds ruling, and
gave Fay only a four-yard gain.
Sensational Play
It was in the fourth quarter that
Peter proved himself for all time by
the most sensational escape of the
season. Standing in a puddle of water
beneath his own goal-posts, Fay's
punt was ruined by a bad pass from
center, and he began to run to the
I starboard to prevent a safety for
I Columbia. He was met there by the
enemy, and cut back. Faced on the
other side by the rest of the de
fense, he booted the ball on the
dead run and placed it safely out
of bounds on the 40-yard stripe.
Bill Paulman also faced an emer
gency to keep the Columbia score
to zero. When the fine Luckman-
R-advilas passing combination was a
sure bet for a touchdown in the
first quarter, Paulman loomed on the
5-yard line, intercepted the pass, and
carried the ball 23 yards to the safe
side. Paulman also performed in ex
pert fashion as a passer, line-smash
er, and kicker.
Zagar Holds Line
It was Pete Zagar who held the
New Yorkers in their final aims at
the goal-line. Jack Naylor, of the
Lions, was touchdown-bound, when
the burly Card tackle stopped him
on the 7-yard line and then held fast
a line-punch. And finally, when the
Lions made their last desperate at
tempts, Pete ruined them with a se
ries of hard tackles.
Tackling was the Indians' long
suit. Tony Calvelli and Gene Cold
iron backed up the line in excel
lent fashion, while Bob Dakan,
Grant Stone, Ed Gamier, Bobby
Matthews, and Stan Andersen were
each responsible for several hard,
decisive tackles.
Jake Brigham, substituting for
Paulman at fullback, made some
good drives with the ball. Jim
Groves, on the bench with a cold,
was missed in the reverse plays.

cleats on their shoes to a recent
dance at Tulane University.
