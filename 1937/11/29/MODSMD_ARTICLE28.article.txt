# Little Red Holler Stalled In Lion's Den With 0-0 Tie
## Indians Shine as Individual Stars; ShOW Lack of Team Spirit 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Where is that old Stanford spirit?
For weeks we have fooled ourselves into thinking we had a better
team than records show, constantly dismissing the hidden feeling that
something was missing—team spirit.
Although we cannot go too far by what we hear until the hoys get
hack, it appeared to he the "handwriting on the wall" when eleven fine

•ball players could not work well
enough together to break a scoreless
tie with a supposedly inferior Co
lumbia outfit which had been over
powered week after week by nearly
all the teams encountered.

The Stanford boys> cannot be
blamed for feeling low after the
cancellation of their Hawaiian trip,
and nobody expected them to re
main at their Big Game peak. But
there was something more that held
them back. Who is to blame nobody
can say for sure.
Individuals Star
While the Big Red Machine could
not function as a whole, almost ev
ery one of the eleven cogs worked
smoothly throughout the game. Most
of them were individual sensations.
Few ball players have shown
greater skill and greater diversity
than Stanford's own Peter Fay. One
test of a good football player is the
way he acts in emergencies, and
Coach Tiny Thornhill's greatest

from Sid Luckman, deep in his own
territory, and carried it right
through ten Card defenders. Fay
stood on the 50, the last man to be
met by the Columbia end, and pin
ned him in the open field.
Later, when Paulman fumbled on
his own 20. Peter met the emergency
by picking up the ball, planning his
own play, and running for what was
a cinch touchdown. But Referee
W. H. Friessel, the most unpopular
man at Stanford today, split hairs
on the out-of-bounds ruling, and
gave Fay only a four-yard gain.
Sensational Play
It was in the fourth quarter that
Peter proved himself for all time by
the most sensational escape of the
season. Standing in a puddle of water
beneath his own goal-posts, Fay's
punt was ruined by a bad pass from
center, and he began to run to the
I starboard to prevent a safety for
I Columbia. He was met there by the
