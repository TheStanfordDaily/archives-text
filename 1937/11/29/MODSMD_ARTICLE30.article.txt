# F.R. Will Open Major Attack Against Slump
## Congress Will Consider Housing Legislation, Highway Finance Cut 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt will open a ma
jor attack against the business slump
this week by asking Congress to
encourage a nationwide housing pro
gram and at the same time curtail
Federal highway spending in a new
drive to balance the budget.
The recommendations will be
placed before the legislators in two
special messages prepared by Mr.
Roosevelt before his departure last
night on a Florida fishing trip. The
housing message will be read tomor
row and the President's proposal that
Federal highway appropriations be
cut more than $100,000,000 in the
coming fiscal year will be made on
Tuesday.
Farm Program
In the meantime, Mr. Roosevelt
instructed Senate Majority Leader
Alben W. Barkley, D., Ky., to keep
the new farm program on a "pay
as-you-go" basis, explaining that
"we cannot hope to continue on a
sound basis of financial management
unless the regular annual expendi
tures are brought within revenues."
Administration leaders hoped that
the President's triple - edged pro
gram not only would inspire more
confidence of industry in the New
Deal, but that it also would soften
disappointment that came when
week - end developments blasted
hopes of an immediate repeal or
revision of business taxes.
