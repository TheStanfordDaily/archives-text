# Vatican Fears Pius' Overwork
## Pope Determined To Tax Self in Hard Week 
### 
VATICAN CITY, Nov. 27 (UP).â€”
Pope Pius Xl's repeated insistence
that he wants to "die at work"
alarmed Vatican prelates tonight as
the 80-year-old Pontiff disregarded
warnings of his physicians and em
barked on his annual week of "spir
itual exercises."
Intimates said the week-long cere
monies, inaugurating an unusually
heavy December schedule which he
has arranged, might prove a severe
strain on the ailing Pope.
A year ago the Pontiff went to his
sick bed and prayers were said
throughout the world for his recov
ery after he had completed the spir
itual exercises.
This year the Pontiff is deter
mined to emerge from the week of
spiritual mediation and prayer
which starts tomorrow with mind
and body refreshed to carry him
through the arduous program which
will not be completed until after the
new year.
The high point of the Pope's pro
gram in December is the ceremonies
connected with the creation of five
new cardinals. On December 13 the
Pontiff will preside at a secret con
sistory at which he will inform the
sacred college of the nomination of
five new princes of the church and
assign their pastorships.
