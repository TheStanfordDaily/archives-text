### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, Nov. 29
(UP). —Japan tightened her hold on
all Shanghai today by taking over
communications and the censorship
bureau formerly operated by the
Chinese government.
The telegraph office refused to ac
cept messages to points in China.
A formal statement by the Chinese
Ministry of Communications said
the Japanese had posted notices in
telegraph dispatch offices, including
those of the Chinese government
radio administration, warning that
these offices had been taken over by
the Japanese military authorities
and that messages would be accepted
subject to Japanese censorship, re
placing that formerly exercised by
the Chinese.
Aerial Bombing
Meantime the Japanese army, fol
lowing widespread new aerial bomb
ing operations, continued to fight its
way slowly toward Nanking with
indications that the partly aban
doned former Chinese national capi
tal might be occupied within two
weeks.
Chinese casualties were described
as very heavy.
In North China the Domei agency
reported that' the commanders of
7,000 Chinese troops stationed
around Shihkiachwang, southwest of
Peiping on the Peiping - Hankow
railway, had asked to surrender to
the Japanese army and offered to
fight with the Japanese.
Assume Control
The Japanese were moving more
cautiously in assuming full control
of the Shanghai offices of the Chi
nese maritime customs.
A Japanese Embassy spokesman
said that Japan reserved the right
to control the customs in principle
and that measures to make effective
this control, without working a hard
ship on any of the interested foreign
powers, were proceeding smoothly.
Referring to a British protest in
Tokyo he said Japan had emphasized
that due consideration always would
be given to the claims against Chi
nese customs revenue by various
powers which have accepted the
customs revenue as collateral for
loans.
