# Hit Bullseye, Win a Seegar

### 
Sex - geant Bellevue of the Stanford
R.O.T.C. unit has made a swell
racket out of the pistol practice for
the third year students. He has a
s-tanding wager with the boys every
time that they go out on the pistol
range.
When a student misses the target
completely, he Owes Sergeant Belle
vue a good five-cent cigar. Every
time the student on the firing line
gets five bull's eyes out of five shots,
the sergeant owes him a cigar.
Thus far, the sergeant owes two
cigars and has about 50 being owed
to him. It sounds like a paying
proposition—for the sergeant. How
ever, there is only one catch to it—
the sergeant has been paid only
once; the rest of the cigars seem to
be accidentally forgotten by the
students forfeiting them.
