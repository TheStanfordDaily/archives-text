TYPE LOUSE COHN
DEFAMES TINY & CO.
During this entire football season
a varmint of journalism, better
known as a type louse, has been
spreading his seed of hatred and
unwieldy prejudice» through the
sports pages of an Oakland news
paper.
This low form of human being
with u mind so warped that he
thinks nothing of cluttering up his
column with venomous lies in order
to carry on his campaign against
Stanford athletics, is Art Cohn,
sports editor of the Oakland Trib
une.
Many sports followers here on the
Farm are already familiar with
Cohn's outrageous attacks on the
Indian football team and coaching
stall. All Stanford supporters in
northern California who have read
Cohn's trash have felt righteous in
dignation, and even University of
California fans have been sickened
and disgusted with his demented
ravings.
Cohn blew the lid off the whole
works in last Monday's Tribune
when he put his finishing artistic
touch on his diabolical scheme to
defame Tiny Thornhill and Stan
lord's football players.
DOES COIIN USE
HIS OWN LIES?
Our little Oakland type louse
spends two full columns explaining
why Tiny and his boys are the worst
sports in the business. He takes.six
statements, supposed to have been
uttered by Tiny immediately after
the Big Game, and twists them to
conform with his warped reasoning.
In the first place, Cohn did not hear
Tiny utter one single after-game
statement. Either he has made up
his own lies or has hirelings trained
to bring him grut which will fit
into his campaign, regardless of the
truth of such statements.
Cohn was busy writing his game
story that dreary Saturday and did
NOT see Tiny or any of the Card
footballers before they left for New
York.
He is so saturated with blue and
gold that he thinks the Bears have
the only football team in the coun
try, and anybody that thinks an
other team is pretty good, too, is
committing a grave crime and should
be dragged through the streets and
publicly degraded.
A STANFORD PLAYER
CAN'T BE OUTSTANDING
Thornhill is quoted as saying that
Tony Calvelli, Card center, was the
best man on the field in the Big
Game. Cohn was terribly disturbed
about this. The idea . . . it's rot
ten unsportsmanship for a person
to pick anybody but a Cal player
as outstanding.
And then there's Cohn's childish
remark that Fay was flat on his back
all afternoon. It seems to me that
Pete did a lot of vertical playing.
All this followed Fay's purported re
mark that Cal players were easy to
fake out of position.
Tiny is also supposed to have said
that his Rose Bowl teams of 1933,
1934, and 1935 could have beaten the
Bears. Cohn calls this "prattling un
worthy of a 10-year-old spoiled
child."
Another alleged Thornhill state
ment . . . "California should invite
Pittsburgh to the Rose Bowl." Yes,
believe it or not, poor, demented
Cohn even plucks twangs of un
sportsmanship out of this humble
remark.
STANFORD MUST BE
AFRAID OF PITTSBURGH
Says Stanford's Public Enemy No.
1 . . . "Stanford had three chances
to invite Pitt to the Rose Bowl but
never got around to it. But Stan
lord did invite Columbia, which was
the East's fifth ranking team. I get
it now. Tiny: Stanford isn't afraid
of Pittsburgh ... if California
plays 'em." Talk about your child
ish prattle ... if Cohn isn't a
perfect subject for laboratory study
in child psychology I have yet to
see one. Of course there's the little
matter that Pitt was NOT the first
ranking team in the country dur
ing those three years, but that does
n't bother Cohn . . . heck, no . . .
Stanford's afraid, and that's all there
is to it.
Many football lovers in San Fran
cisco are considering a mass migra
tion across the bay to feed Cohn
his typewriter key by key.
