# Unbeaten Grid Squads Hope For Bowl Bid
## Alabama, Pitt, Michigan Win Holiday Tilts To Keep Slates Clean 
### ED BURROWS 
Bowling is sweeping the country!
If it isn't the Rose Bowl it's the Su
gar Bowl. Every team except Santa
Clara and Washington wants to play
in the Rose Bowl. The Santa Clar
ans want to get into the Sugar Bowl
but aren't wanted. The Washington
Huskies want to play in the Mush
Bowl. Let's let them.
Now that the Huskies have their
bowl of mush, who will make mush
out of California in the Rose Bowl?
Alabama is still giving thanks for
their Thanksgiving Day win over
Vanderbilt. The Commodores were
leading 7 to G most of the afternoon,
but the Crimson Tide from 'Bama
finally put a toe hold on the game
with a field goal to win 9-7.
Another Rose Bowl candidate,
Pittsburgh, found two Duke fum
bles and converted them into 10
points to keep their undefeated rec
ord clean.
The other eastern university that
would like to send its football team
to the Rose Bowl is Fordham. The
Rams kept themselves in the run
ning for the bid by outscoring New
York University 20 to 7 in front of
65,000 fans. They did it with passes
and mud pies.
Still Pitt is favored for the Rose
Bowl.
An Italian by the name of Mario
Tonelli saved the day for the Fight
ing Irish in the last two minutes of
their game against the University of
Southern California. The score was
6 to B, the time to play was two min
utes, the crowd was 40,000, the run
was for 70 yards, and the score was
13 to 6 when the final gun went off.
The West Pointers took their
greatest rivals, Navy, to the tufTe of
6 to 0, before the largest football
crowd of the season, 102,000 —2,000
more than saw a high school foot
ball game in Chicago.
