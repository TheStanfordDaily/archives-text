# 'Spanish Earth' Set for Tonight
## Farm Medical Aid Body Withdraws Support 
### 
Ernest Hemingway's film, "War
in Spain," goes on tonight at Blan
co's Mountain View Theater, but the
Stanford student committee for
Spanish Medical Aid has called off
its projected campus-wide ticket
sale in support of the event.
The sale of tickets scheduled for
today on the Engineering Corner
and in living groups was aban
doned, committee members an
nounced, when it was discovered
that profits from the venture would
go to Spain through the Mountain
View Spanish Club rather than
through the local group and the
Medical Bureau.
This represents a second sudden
reversal in policy for the student
committee. A theater party slated
for earlier in the quarter was un
expectedly cancelled when "block
booking" interfered with theater
arrangements.
The newest stalemate left student
committee members still casting
about for some means of raising
money to support the Spanish med
ical unit of Dr. Leo Eloesser, Stan
ford clinical professor of surgery.
