# Peerless Pickers End Tough Season
## 
### ED BURROWS 
The Dippy's Pfeerless Pigskin Pickers have ended a tough season; but,
considering the material they had to work wrtli. they did a darn good
jot). Out of (Sf> games the boys scored a guessing average of .(>O2.
Over the week-end they picked five winners out of six for an average
of .8:.:); it was nasty old Lou Little and his Columbia Lions who threw
the one monkev wrench into the guessing gears. The boys at the Daily

shack picked Stanford 13 to G over
the New Yorkers, but —Oh, Oh, you
knew the right score.
Two games, Notre Dame-U.S.C.
and Michigan State-U.S.F., fell only
one point away from the predictions.
The Pickers chose the Irish 14 to 6
over Troy, but were one point off.
The scoreboard score was 13-6 in
favor of Notre Dame. Michigan State
was supposed to beat the Dons by
only 13 points but they got tough and
ran it up to 14 to 0.
The Daily boys picked U.C.L.A.
over Missouri by 19-0 but Missouri
held out and only lost by 13 points.
Oregon was supposed to beat the
San Diego Marines 20 to 0, said the
seers, but did win by 24 to 7.
The last correct prognostication
came on the Santa Clara-Gonzaga
game. The Broncs won 27 to o—the0 —the
Pickers said the Broncs would win,
but gave them only 20 points.
Now that the season is over, think
how much money you'd have won
if you'd have put a buck with every
team the Peerless Pickers picked.
