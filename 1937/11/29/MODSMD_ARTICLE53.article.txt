### 
ORANGE, N.J., Nov. 28 (UP). â€”
William Read, retired policeman
now G7 years old, came out of re
tirement today with a 12-gaugc,
double barreled shot gun and killed
176 pigeons in two hours. Police
called on Read, an expert marks
man, on receiving complaints that
the pigeons were a nuisance.

Jack Dcmpsey, former world's
heavyweight boxing champion, re
turned to New- York after being tak
en ill by ptomaine poisoning while
on a wrestling refcreeing trip in
Canada.

Liners which will cross the At
lantic at 40 knots an hour, or in
three days, are foreshadowed by
secret experiments under way on
Tyneside, where many British ships
are built.
