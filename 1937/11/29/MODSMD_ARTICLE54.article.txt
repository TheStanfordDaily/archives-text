## Not Stupendous, But Not Bad

DOC LUCKETT'S attempted placement ended
Stanford's big show last Saturday, the
yearly, autumnal extravaganza called football
season. The Columbia game brought down the
curtain, though it was to be the first part of a
two-reel travelogue, before the second attrac
tion went by the boards last week.
In rating the season's show, last Saturday's
epilogue might also be disregarded, since aside
from its moral victory aspect to loyal Colum
bians, it had no meaning to anyone except New
York laundry proprietors. However, Lou Little
may now write a series entitled "How We Tied
Stanford."
The Tiny Thornhill players really wound up
the season the previous week when they lost to
what is supposed to be the best team in the
country by two touchdowns and a conversion.
To say that a season that included three de
feats and two ties has been a most successful
one would be a bold statement, but there are a
few facts to support it.
It was shown in the last two months that Stan

ford can come back, and do it in record time.
After three fat years there are supposed to be
thiet; lean ones, but second place in the con
ference standings hardly indicates a thin season.
Improvement was shown in each appearance.
After the two initial defeats only the Big Game
was lost. The Coast's two undefeated teams,
Santa Clara and California, were the only teams
to score more than one touchdown against the
Indians.
Because the best combination was made up
of young players, this season also served as a
tryout for next year. The new star of the act,
Pete Fay, and an old one who added to his repu
tation, Bill Paulman, both have another year of
eligibility. Sportswriters already are picking
Stanford as next year's team to beat.
Only the B.A.C. can tell if the run was a box
office success, and these returns won't be in
until after the first of the year.
Under the glow of such highlights, the Farm's
football show for 1937 might not rate a four-star
label, but the severest critic could hardly give
it less than three.â€”L.L.
