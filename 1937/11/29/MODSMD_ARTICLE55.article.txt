# Ask the Gal Who Has One

### 
FRESHMAN and sophomore women can afford
to be carefree souls. They know that for two
or three years longer they will live under Stan
ford's red-tiled or shingled roofs, unaware of
the world outside except for an occasional
glance at the front page of a San Francisco
newspaper.
By the time women are seniors or even juniors
their freedom from care is ebbing. Realizing
their days in the Farm world are numbered, they
think about passing on to days in the big out
side world of which writers have made such a
bugaboo. With two and one-half quarters left,
seniors see only too well that they must shortly
have an answer to the question "After college—
what?"
A few of the women who graduate each year
know that they'll exchange textbooks for recipe
books.
Others intend to travel or rest after being
ground four years in the college mill.
But many women want to turn from studying
to earning a living on their own hook. Some of
these have a definite job in mind; others are
scanning the vocational horizon for an appro
priate field of work.
It is primarily for the large group of potential
Stanford woman job-hunters that the Vocational
Guidance Committee is Wednesday night bring

ing back to the Farm eight or more recently
graduated alumnae who acquired jobs when
they left the University.
Meeting in Lagunita Court after dinner Wed
nesday night, the alumnae job-hunters will talk
to all prospective Stanford women job-hunters,
whether senior or freshmen, on how the gradu
ate can find a job and how she can manage
after she gets it.
The result of their discussion should be some
very pertinent, practical, down-to-earth advice
to Stanford women on getting and holding jobs.
That this year's program is a repeat of a similar
one last year, shows that the Committee, and
the women who attended last spring, feel that
this is at least a partial solution of the problem.
Wednesday night Stanford women who want
jobs after college will have a real glimpse into
what they can expect from the world outside
the Farm.—M. L.
