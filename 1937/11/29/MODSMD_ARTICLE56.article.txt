SNUFFING OUT CIVILIZATION
have known for some time that civilization is
fiddling with dynamite while the moralists burn.
Ordinarily we can ignore the impending doom. There
is nothing to remind us of it if we sleep late enough
to let the man across the hall grab the paper. But yes
terday I ran across one of those straws in the wind
which indicate that the time is right for something nice
in the way of a barbarian invasion.
I was canvassing the local drugstores, looking for
something that would cure a head cold contracted a
week ago at the time of the great flood when the
B.A.C. was fresh out of arks. All I wanted was the
usual atomizer mixture of hydrochloric acid and
shellac, or some similar prescription. What I got was
a "pocket companion."
* * * *
As an evidence of the glories of Modern Science,
my acquisition is unsurpassed. It consists of a small
metal tube. Sniff it, and you experience a sort of gas
attack, accompanied by heavy artillery fire. The effect
is about the same as exploding a firecracker in your
nose, and is supposed to be very good for a cold.
My little companion also does well for cuts and bruises
and insect bites if applied directly. And it can be
used to write checks, and kill breath when you have
to see the dean.
All this is very fine, but in the rise of the pocket
companion I see one of the shadows of the twilight of
civilization creeping across our cultui'al landscape. In
advertising it as a companion, the makers do their
bit towards putting the skids under the last of the
great virtues that has made our civilization what it
is. With the advent of the companion, one more blow
is struck at Sacred Friendship.
* * * *
IT is a commonplace that our virtues are vanishing
faster than an allowance check. Faith, hope, and
charity are so scarce that it takes a posse with blood
hounds to find them. Friendship alone remains, and
friendship is being undermined by our "companions."
When a man has a cold, he does not want com
panionship. He wants to sneak off into a back room
and kick the furniture. When he goes abroad, he has
an irresistible desire to kick dogs and swear at little
children.
- * * t *
It is quite obvious to the discerning mind that the
"pocket companion" will link this attitude with what
the sociologists might call post-cold associations. By
a series of conditioning processes, companionship will
become linked to the negative stimulation of a cold
in the head, thus acquiring a negative response. Friend
ship will be tarnished because in our symbolism it will
be linked with colds in tjie head.
And with the sacred bonds of Friendship in default,
civilizatoin will head for the abyss like a professional
grad heading for the bm\ And the barbarian hordes
will sweep in from the steppes of the Bronx.
♦ * * #
There are doubtless men who will question this rea
soning. But the weight of precedent is behind it.
For years, self-appointed prophets have seen the doom
of culture in movies, in books, in liquor, in rumble
seats, in Mae West jokes. Personally, I consider it
much simpler and more convenient to foresee doom
in canned nose sprays. It will be so simple to abolish
pocket companions, and so hard to abolish rumble

SNUFFING OUT CIVILIZATION
have known for some time that civilization is
fiddling with dynamite while the moralists burn.
Ordinarily we can ignore the impending doom. There
is nothing to remind us of it if we sleep late enough
to let the man across the hall grab the paper. But yes
terday I ran across one of those straws in the wind
which indicate that the time is right for something nice
in the way of a barbarian invasion.
I was canvassing the local drugstores, looking for
something that would cure a head cold contracted a
week ago at the time of the great flood when the
B.A.C. was fresh out of arks. All I wanted was the
usual atomizer mixture of hydrochloric acid and
shellac, or some similar prescription. What I got was
a "pocket companion."
* * * *
As an evidence of the glories of Modern Science,
my acquisition is unsurpassed. It consists of a small
metal tube. Sniff it, and you experience a sort of gas
attack, accompanied by heavy artillery fire. The effect
is about the same as exploding a firecracker in your
nose, and is supposed to be very good for a cold.
My little companion also does well for cuts and bruises
and insect bites if applied directly. And it can be
used to write checks, and kill breath when you have
to see the dean.
All this is very fine, but in the rise of the pocket
companion I see one of the shadows of the twilight of
civilization creeping across our cultui'al landscape. In
advertising it as a companion, the makers do their
bit towards putting the skids under the last of the
great virtues that has made our civilization what it
is. With the advent of the companion, one more blow
is struck at Sacred Friendship.
* * * *
IT is a commonplace that our virtues are vanishing
faster than an allowance check. Faith, hope, and
charity are so scarce that it takes a posse with blood
hounds to find them. Friendship alone remains, and
friendship is being undermined by our "companions."
When a man has a cold, he does not want com
panionship. He wants to sneak off into a back room
and kick the furniture. When he goes abroad, he has
an irresistible desire to kick dogs and swear at little
children.
- * * t *
It is quite obvious to the discerning mind that the
"pocket companion" will link this attitude with what
the sociologists might call post-cold associations. By
a series of conditioning processes, companionship will
become linked to the negative stimulation of a cold
in the head, thus acquiring a negative response. Friend
ship will be tarnished because in our symbolism it will
be linked with colds in tjie head.
And with the sacred bonds of Friendship in default,
civilizatoin will head for the abyss like a professional
grad heading for the bm\ And the barbarian hordes
will sweep in from the steppes of the Bronx.
♦ * * #
There are doubtless men who will question this rea
soning. But the weight of precedent is behind it.
For years, self-appointed prophets have seen the doom
of culture in movies, in books, in liquor, in rumble
seats, in Mae West jokes. Personally, I consider it
much simpler and more convenient to foresee doom
in canned nose sprays. It will be so simple to abolish
