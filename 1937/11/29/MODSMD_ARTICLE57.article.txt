¥ ATEST addition to the roster af radio symphony
programs is NBC's new orchestra. There's been
lots of talk about the expenses involved, and, to be
sure, their line-up of conductors warrants such bally
hoo. Pierre Monteux has been directing the concerts
to date, to be followed by Artur Rodzinski and, trum
pet fan-fare, Arturo Toscanini. Rodbinski takes over
next week for three concerts, and then, Christmas
night, Toscanini returns.
The program which they played Saturday night
allows one to judge them alongside the New York
Philharmonic, which played yesterday noon. Both went
through the Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony. As
usual, Monteux galloped along, losing a great deal of
the rich sonority of the music. He also showed his
characteristic lack of attention to detail. Or perhaps
it was merely poor execution of the orchestra. They
didn't at all live up to their gilt-edged bally-hooed
rep, muffing their attacks, and shaking on their solo
passages. The string section, particularly, needs
strengthening if they are going to join the ranks of
the other symphony organizations in the United States.
Definitely better than previous "radio symphonies,"
they still have some to go before they start resting
on their laurels.
Perhaps a session under Toscanini will brush them
up. A good deal of the quality which makes a sym
phony orchestra noteworthy comes from long years
of playing together. Seasoning, you might call it. And
under the world's finest and most meticulous leader,
they will get it, or forever after hold their peace.

pROVING that business and pleasure, while not
necessarily mixing, can often be profitable, Les Lie
ber, maestro of the tin whistle, holds a job on the
New York Times as well as appearing with Bernie,
and on the Saturday Night Swing Club among othei'
things. It was in Paris that Lieber awoke to find him
self famous, so to speak, when he happened to pur
chase, at a sort of 10-cent store deal, a small fife. And
the rest is history. The gentleman can do on his
fife what has made Goodman, Armstrong, all the rest
of 'em, famous—swing.
Listening to him playing last Saturday, we got a
flash which suddenly fitted all swing into the whole
musical picture. We realized fully, for the first time,
that the stuff those boys are doing when they take
eight bars, is of the same nature as Bach's counter
point in its most advanced form. Developed on the
spur of the moment—improvised—it lacks a planned,
mathematical form, but the melodic ideas are exactly
the same, could as well be the basis for a contra
puntal work as any theme of Bach.
We may be dodging the names of heretic and Phil
istine for the next few days by coupling the names of
Swingdom with that of Bach. But just listen to Good
man, for instance, at his best, take his breaks apart,
analyze them, and you'll have melody of the purest
nature. Put those breaks or choruses with the rest of
the band, and you have precisely what Bach had, coun
terpoint—one or more melodies running along with
other unrelated melodies, and tied together as a whole
with harmonic values. That's why swing is the most
important part of modern music; and not the "sym
phonic jazz" of Gershwin, popular as it is.
