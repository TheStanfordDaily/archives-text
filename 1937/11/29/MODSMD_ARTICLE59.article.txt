# 'Awful Truth' Brings Dunne In Comedy Role
## 
### 
"The Awful Truth" (now in S.F.
but soon at the Stanford) is one of
the better things that has happened
this year. Irene Dunne is funnier
with each successive picture, and
Cary Grant does his best job to date
i in a comic role.
The picture's light and mad-cap
; without going slapstick. For the au-

dience, it's a con
tinual state of hi
larity. You feel
like you'd eaten
yeast, for no soon
er has one laugh
bubbled up and
burst, than anoth
er is on its way.
Each scene is a
gem in itself, and
put together,

they're terrific. It wouldn't be fair
to tell you about them, but if the
scene with Mr. Smith ("Asta" to
, you) and the bowler hats doesn't
I make the world seem all right for
I the next week or so, we give you up.
Irene, bless her, never fails to
j amaze us. Ever since we fell in
j love with her in "Roberta," and
practically turned to a life of sweet-
I ness and light after "Magnificent
! Obsession," she has done things to
us. But we like her best of all in
; the kind of role she has been get
ting lately. We're so sorry she's
getting on in years—for a movie
star, that is—though she's still very
de-lovely. But as far as we're con
cerned, she can go right on being
cute and quixotic till the cows, led
by Mr. Goldwyn and Will Hays,
j come home.
And Cary Grant has suddenly got
! ten the knack of sitting still, saying
; nothing, but being very funny. Pan
j tomime is no .cinch, and it's some
! thing which, except for Charlie
| Chaplin and a few of the old school,
i modern cinemactors are noticeably
i lacking. He's sharp in this one.
Don't miss "The Awful Truth."
We'll take it over "Mr. Deeds," and
i place it hot on the heels of "It Hap
| pened One Night." It's a real
| Christmas present, delivered a mite
too soon, but nonetheless welcome.

"The Awful Truth" (now in S.F.
but soon at the Stanford) is one of
the better things that has happened
this year. Irene Dunne is funnier
with each successive picture, and
Cary Grant does his best job to date

yeast, for no soon
