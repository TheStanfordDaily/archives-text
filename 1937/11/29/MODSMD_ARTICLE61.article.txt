### 
CAIRO, Nov. 28 (UP). â€” Riots
broke out in Cairo tonight after an
unsuccessful attempt to assassinate
Premier Moustapha El-Nahas Pasha,
leader of the WAFD political party.
Three men, reputedly members of
the "Green Shirts" organization of
young Egyptians, violently opposed
to the government, leaped upon a
car in which the premier was riding
and one of the men fired three shots
at- him. None of the shots took
effect.
