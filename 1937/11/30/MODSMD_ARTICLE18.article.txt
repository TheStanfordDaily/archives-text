### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP).â€”
Mounting opposition to the admin
istration's new crop control program,
together with a flood of amendments,
combined tonight to imperil quick
Congressional action on the legisla
tion despite pleas that it is needed
to stabilize surpluses and bolster the
farmer's income.
Shortly after the House took up
the Jones bill, which differs con
siderably from the Senate measure,
Chairman Marvin Jones, D., Tex.,
of the House Agriculture Committee
touched off a fight when he defended
the appropriations necessary to carry
it out as "restitution to the farmers
for what they have lost through the
tariff."
