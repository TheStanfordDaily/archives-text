# Love Laughs at Lockoutsâ€”-and Lockins Don't
## 
### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
Love Lockcd Out was the theme
song last nfonth as Stanford women
lingered a little longer and tempus
fugited too fast.
Women's Council and the various
lockout chairmen gnashed their
teeth, but Cupid got the upper
hand, and lockouts for the past
month soared to a grand total of 153
for the sororities and the smaller
halls.
Every house, wtih one exception,
increased in numbers of late leaves
taken, but only two decreased in
number of lockouts.
This is all very discouraging to
Women's Council, especially as an
example to the freshmen women.
But the worst part of it is that the
poor women receiving the lockouts
have to stay in on certain nights as
penalties.
The most number of lockouts was
taken last month by the Kappas,
who had 25. Thetas. Tri-Delts and
Dee Gees all had 21 and Manzanita
had 15, which is the most for the

smaller halls. This docs not com
pare too well with last month's fig
ures, when the most had by any
house was 19.
Tri-Delts were tied by Thetas for
most late leaves taken, both houses
having 272. Madrono, the largest of
the hall group, took 330 late leaves.
The Pi Phis showed the greatest

improvement in decreasing number
of lockouts, dropping their number
from 19 to 9. Alpha Phis decreased
from 4 to 2, making them the fair
haired children as far as council is
concerned. That's a mighty good
record, considering that they were
among the first 4 in number of late
leaves taken for the month.

The largest increase in lockouts
belongs to the Dee Gees, who had 17
more than last month, while Tri-
Delts increased by 10.
And the naughty, naughty fresh
men women in Redwoods! After the
last article bragged on them so, they
decreased in number of late leaves
for the month and increased their
lockouts by five!
The comparative statistics will
enable you to sec these unhappy
facts for yourselves. The number
of is a total of the regu
| lars and technicals. For the benefit
of the men, a technical lockout is a
mistake on the lockout slip, for
getting a key, etc., while a regular
is just plain old staying out past
the deadline.
Man proposes and U'.kes his time
| about it, but Women's Council dis
penses penalties in short order. So
remember, Stanford women, a drive
j for the elimination of lockouts
I might not be a bad idea. How about
I it?

Love Lockcd Out was the theme
song last nfonth as Stanford women
lingered a little longer and tempus
fugited too fast.
Women's Council and the various
lockout chairmen gnashed their
teeth, but Cupid got the upper
hand, and lockouts for the past
month soared to a grand total of 153
for the sororities and the smaller
halls.
Every house, wtih one exception,
increased in numbers of late leaves
taken, but only two decreased in
number of lockouts.
This is all very discouraging to
Women's Council, especially as an
example to the freshmen women.
But the worst part of it is that the
poor women receiving the lockouts
have to stay in on certain nights as
penalties.
The most number of lockouts was
taken last month by the Kappas,
who had 25. Thetas. Tri-Delts and
Dee Gees all had 21 and Manzanita
had 15, which is the most for the

smaller halls. This docs not com
pare too well with last month's fig
ures, when the most had by any
house was 19.
Tri-Delts were tied by Thetas for
most late leaves taken, both houses
having 272. Madrono, the largest of
the hall group, took 330 late leaves.
The Pi Phis showed the greatest

improvement in decreasing number
of lockouts, dropping their number
from 19 to 9. Alpha Phis decreased
from 4 to 2, making them the fair
haired children as far as council is
concerned. That's a mighty good
record, considering that they were
among the first 4 in number of late
leaves taken for the month.

The largest increase in lockouts
belongs to the Dee Gees, who had 17
more than last month, while Tri-
Delts increased by 10.
And the naughty, naughty fresh
men women in Redwoods! After the
last article bragged on them so, they
decreased in number of late leaves
for the month and increased their
lockouts by five!
