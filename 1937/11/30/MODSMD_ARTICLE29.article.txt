# Excom Goes To Work On New Plans
## Election of Peace Day Chairman, Ski Club Request on Calendar 
### 
Brushing the cobwebs from their
brains and the turkey gravy from
their vests, Ex Committee will go to
work again tonight, with the ap
pointment of the Peace Day chair
man as their chief business.
This position, held last year by
Carolyn Moore, ex-president of La
gunita, involves the organization of
the Peace Day observance cere
monies next spring.
Second subject for deliberation
will be the request of Stanford's Ski
Club for official recognition. Whip
ped from a state of near extinction
last year by Willy Meyer, the club
now boasts over 300 members.
Ski Club Active
Last year, club members partici
pated in week-end trips to nearby
winter sports areas, competed with
other coast university ski teams. This
year's plans include similar jaunts,
and a greater number of sched
uled contests with universtiy
squads.
Broached two weeks ago, Al Hy
man's suggestion that Ex Com fin
ance the purchase of a soda foun
tani for the Nitery will be consid
ered again tonight. The plan was
previously tabled in order that more
specific data could be obtained as to
exact cost, and details involved in
installation.
Fashion Show Idea
Possibilities of putting on a fash
ion show before the Sunday night
movie in Memorial Hall this week
end will also come before Ex Com
mittee.
Pomona College's Men's Glee
Club has written, asking a recon
sideration of Ex Corn's refusal to
grant them a concert date next
spring. The request was dinged be
cause of a possible conflict with the
home concert of Stanford's Glee
Club. Pomona's championship or
ganization has offered to come on
any other date which might be con
venient.
Final business on the docket,
reminiscent of a similar incident
about this time last year, is the con
sideration of a local farmer's com
plaint that his out-house disap
eared a short while ago. Ex Com
probably will grant the necessary
funds to replace this loss.
