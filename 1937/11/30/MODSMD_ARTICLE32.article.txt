# F.D.R. Pushes Bills To Start Housing Boom
## Five-year Plan Will Be Keystone of Attack On Unemployment 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 (UP).—
Congress tonight prepared to expe
dite legislation designed to start a
live-year, $12,000,000,000 to $16,000,-
000,000 housing boom which, Presi
dent Roosevelt said in a special
message, is the keystone of his at
tack on the trade slump and unem
ployment.
Identical bills, embracing proposed
changes in the Housing Act, to liber
alize mortgage restrictions, reduce
the cost of financing new dwellings
and generally encourage large and
small building operations on a na
tionwide basis, were introduced in
both chambers soon after the Presi
dent's message was read.
The President's proposal received
warm praise from Democrats, but
more cautious approval from Re
publicans. Organized labor leaders
were hopeful but not optimistic over
the outcome of the project. John L.
Lewis, head of the Committee for In
dustrial Organization, declined com
ment.
The President said that 3,000,000
or 4,000,000 housing units, at an esti
mated cost of $4,000 a unit, could be
built over the next live years with
out creating a surplus of accommo
dations and without impairing the
value of existing property that is "fit
for decent human occupancy." He
warned that the long-continued lag
in building is a "drag on all industry (
and trade," and "presents an urgent
problem which is the common con
cern of industry, labor, and govern
ment."
