# First Entries Received In Quad's Picture Contest
## 
### 
First entries in Quad's "Stories in
Pictures" contest, launched last
week, have been received by George
McKenna, editor of the annual.
"Several amateur photographers
have turned in good shots taken
over Thanksgiving," McKenna said
yesterday, "but we need a lot moi'e.
Week-end and other parties during
the Christmas holidays should 1 be
good subjects."
The Quad particularly wants se
ries of pictures illustrating student
parties, both on and off campus, as
well as candid shots, principally of
professors. Ten or 15 photographs
are enough to cover one event, ac
cording to McKenna.
The contest will continue until
next March, when the winning se
ries will lie chosen by the Quad
staff, then get its first publication
when the yearbook comes out in
May.
Entries should be in the form of
four-by-five inch prints, mailed to
McKenna at Box 100. Once submit
ted, they will become Quad prop
erty and not be returned.
Entrants must keep negatives
available in case enlargements are
needed later for publication, also
must write their names, addresses,
and telephone numbers plainly on
the back of each print. Pictures
must be identified for persons, oc
casions, and scenes.
The Quad's display in the Cellar
trophy case, composed ot candid

shots already taken by staff photog
raphers, will be changed this week.
As the "Stories in Pictures" contest
continues, some of the best entries
also will be put on display.
