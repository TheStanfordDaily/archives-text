SACRAMENTO, Nov. 29 (UP).â€”
Four of five Folsom prison convicts
condemned to die for the slaying of
Warden Clarence A. Larkin began
their last legal fight today to escape
execution in a lethal gas chamber.
The defendants, seeking to show
they were insane when they joined
in the September 19 penitentiary
break which resulted in death of
four men, were Wesley E. Eudy, Al
bert Kessell, Fred Barnes, and Ed
Davis.
