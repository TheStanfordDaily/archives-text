| The Editor, Sir:
We the cast of "The Stanford Gaie- '
ties of 1937," the stagehands, and
I co-workers of J. P. Cahn use this!
J means of expressing their appre- j
' ciation of his wonderful work.
J. P. was the guiding light behind
j the technical stage work and also j
co-author of four skits and a nuin- I
ber of songs.
He kept his temper in the mo- j
merits of most stress when any show ;
|of emotion would have blown the j
i lid off the whole show. He worked j
beyond normal human endurance
1 and, we think, did an exceptionally
! good job. The stage manager has a j
i tough job with no recognition.
