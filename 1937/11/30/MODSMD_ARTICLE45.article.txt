# MISSING BUREAU

The Editor, Sir:
While recently seeking a lost ar
ticle, I discovered that Stanford suf
fers from an overabundance of lost
and found departments. There is
one in the Administration Building,
one in the Memorial Theater, one
in the A.S.S.U. oflice, one in almost
every department, and probably a
few I haven't heard of yet.
Obviously, this system is disad
vantageous and inefficient. Time is
lost by owners who must make the
rounds to all of them, there is delay
in recovering needed articles, and
doubtless many articles never find
their way back to their owners sim
ply because the owners don't know
where to apply.
These disadvantages can be elim
inated by the designation of one
place (e.g., the A.S.S.U. office) as
official lost and found department, to
which students, janitors, and de
partment secretaries should turn in
all found articles. I hope The Daily
will promote the establishment of
such a single lost and found depart
ment.
Sincerely
W. H. Bue.l
