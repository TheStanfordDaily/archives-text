STANFORD'S GLAD LION
SERIES IS ENDED

Well, Stanford's football relations
with Columbia are ended for the
present. Tiny and his boys must be
very glad. The three games with
the Columbines haven't netted the
Indians a single point, and have
caused them no end of embarrass
ment.
The Cards were 3-1 favorites in
all three encounters and about all
they did was launch Lou Little on a
literary career. The world over has
heard how he outsmarted the Stan
lords in the 1934 Rose Bowl game.
I believe it was his "K 99" play, or
something similar, that whipped the
Indians that dreary day.
If this series continued many
years longer, "Moanin' Lou" could
retire from the game, independently
wealthy.
Next season Tiny's charges open
their two-game series with Dart
mouth.

DAILY WONT PICK
ANY ALL-STAR TEAMS

We have been asked to pick an
all-coast team and an ail-American
eleven. Neither the Daily sports staff
nor myself will choose any all-star
teams this year. None of us have
seen all the teams play, and even
if we had it would be an impossible
task to pick eleven players on the
coast or in the entire nation who are
outstanding at their positions.
We'll let the people who think they
can pick 'em, do the guessing. The
Daily probably will print a con
census survey of all these lists. The
Daily ones have been nuts on con
census opinions this volume. In
stead of letting little Johnny Drof
nats shoulder the burden of pre
dicting the outcomes of important
coast games, the entire sports staff
climbed out on the limb week after
week.
We didn't do bad at that. Out of
05 games the seers picked 43 win
ners. This wasn't bad considering
that tie games went on the minus
side of the ledger. Four scores were
called right on the nose—Stanford-
Washington, Stanford-W.S.C., O. S.
C. - Willamette, and Washington -
Oregon.

FOUR CARDS MENTIONED
FOR ALL-COAST HONORS

Eight games were missed only by
the matter of a conversion or two —
Cal - 0.5.C., S.F.U.-Daniel Baker,
Cal-W.S.C., Santa Clara-Portland,
St. Mary's-Loyola, Cal-U.S.C., Mich
igan State-S.F.U., and Notre Dame-
U.S.C.
The lists of correct or near-cor
rect scores includes all of the coast
confei'ence teams with the exception
of U.C.L.A.
Stanford players we would recom
mend for all-coast honors would be
Pete Fay, halfback; Pete Zagar,
tackle; Grant Stone, end; and Tony
Calvelli, center. Even then, we
wouldn't attempt to place them on
the first, second, or third teams. We
would recommend them as Stan
ford's outstanding gridders for the
season just past.
Under this same system we would
have to recommend the entire Cal
team—all eleven of them. It's real
ly funny—last year Bob Hcrwig was
picked on everybody's all-American
team. This year the wise boys are
forgetting all about him . . . sort
of taking him for granted because he
was picked last year. And Burly
Bob is better this year than he was
last.
