# Cal Denies Pitt In Bowl, Rumor
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 29 (UP).â€”Ken
neth Priestly, graduate manager of
the University of California, said
today he "knew nothing" about a
report published in Pittsburgh that
the University of Pittsburgh foot
ball team had been invited to play
in the Rose Bowl.
Meanwhile the Panther team, op
erating under a new athletic plan of
de-emphasizing football, today vot
ed to reject any invitations for post
season games, including the Rose
Bowl, Sugar Bowl and other bowl
games.
But that decision, understood to
have reached at noon, was compli
cated by reports that the football
players met later, apparently to re
consider their earlier rejection.
