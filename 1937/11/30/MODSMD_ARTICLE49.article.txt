# Hoopsters In Exhibition At Pavilion
## Cage Squad To Present Diagrammatic Plays Saturday Afternoon 
### 
First public activity for the 1937-
38 edition of the Crimson Giants,
John Bunn's basketball varsity,
will take place Saturday afternoon,
when the cagers engage in an ex
hibition for fans and coaches in En
cina Pavilion.
Scheduled to start at 3 o'clock,
Coach Bunn's brainchild will consti
tute somewhat of an explanation of
the system in use at Stanford. Play
ers will perform in diagrammatic sit
uations to present concrete examples
of the principles.
Students Asked To Come
All students interested in under
standing the sport are urged to at
tend, although probably those most
interested will be high school coach
es and star players of the bay re
gion, according to Bunn.
Immediately following the dem
onstration there will be played the
annual varsity-freshman game, ti
tanic struggle between those who
are and those who would like to be.
The varsity, as usual, will be con
ceded the edge, although the frosh,
sparked by the huge Dick Taylor,
won't be playing for fun. Taylor,
six feet, seven inches tall, has even
the stoic Coach Wytze Gorter smil
ing, so he must be a prospect.
First Game U.S.C.
Monday, December 6, the first
game for the varsity without side
competition will be held in the Pa
vilion, against the Olympic Club of
San Francisco. The next night
Bunn's boys travel to San Jose for
a game with the San Jose State
Spartans, the only other game before
! the intersectional tour begins De
cember 20.
Surprise development in person
nel of the season thus far finds Bob
Burnett, dynamic guard who was
; not out last season, giving the rest
of the feeders about all they can
| handle in the way of competition for
the post opposite perennial Jack
Calderwood.
Burnett on First Team
Burnett played with the first
team—Luisetti, Stoefen, Phil Zonne
and Calderwood—last night in drill,
and things aj?e- at about a standoff
between him and H. B. Lee for the
job. Bob Zonne, who was figured
to be there before practice started,
is now playing behind Calderwood in
Bunn's new system of using a short
guard and a tall guard at all times.
Burnett, while no little fellow, is
short compared to Caldy, Zonne,
Will Anderson and Bill Rapp, tops
in the tall guard job at present. He
competes with Lee, Bill Schuette,
Gil Rahn and Jack Kessel for the
shorty duties.
Practice for the squad will close
for finals a week from Friday, Bunn
says, but the gym will be there for
anyone on the squad who wants
some exercise. Needing it most will
be the 12 members of the traveling
squad, to be named by Bunn fol
lowing the two games at the start of
next week. The graying coach can
virtually name the men going now,
he says, but will decide definitely
after the week-end.

San Francisco. The next night
Bunn's boys travel to San Jose for
a game with the San Jose State
Spartans, the only other game before
! the intersectional tour begins De
cember 20.
Surprise development in person
nel of the season thus far finds Bob
Burnett, dynamic guard who was
; not out last season, giving the rest
of the feeders about all they can
| handle in the way of competition for
the post opposite perennial Jack
Calderwood.
Burnett on First Team
Burnett played with the first
team—Luisetti, Stoefen, Phil Zonne
and Calderwood—last night in drill,
and things aj?e- at about a standoff
between him and H. B. Lee for the
job. Bob Zonne, who was figured
to be there before practice started,
is now playing behind Calderwood in
Bunn's new system of using a short
guard and a tall guard at all times.
Burnett, while no little fellow, is
short compared to Caldy, Zonne,
Will Anderson and Bill Rapp, tops
in the tall guard job at present. He
competes with Lee, Bill Schuette,
Gil Rahn and Jack Kessel for the
shorty duties.
Practice for the squad will close
for finals a week from Friday, Bunn
says, but the gym will be there for
anyone on the squad who wants
some exercise. Needing it most will
be the 12 members of the traveling
squad, to be named by Bunn fol
lowing the two games at the start of
next week. The graying coach can
virtually name the men going now,
he says, but will decide definitely
after the week-end.
First public activity for the 1937-
38 edition of the Crimson Giants,
John Bunn's basketball varsity,
will take place Saturday afternoon,
when the cagers engage in an ex
hibition for fans and coaches in En
cina Pavilion.
Scheduled to start at 3 o'clock,
Coach Bunn's brainchild will consti
tute somewhat of an explanation of
the system in use at Stanford. Play
ers will perform in diagrammatic sit
uations to present concrete examples
of the principles.
Students Asked To Come
All students interested in under
standing the sport are urged to at
tend, although probably those most
interested will be high school coach
es and star players of the bay re
gion, according to Bunn.
Immediately following the dem
onstration there will be played the
annual varsity-freshman game, ti
tanic struggle between those who
are and those who would like to be.
The varsity, as usual, will be con
ceded the edge, although the frosh,
sparked by the huge Dick Taylor,
won't be playing for fun. Taylor,
six feet, seven inches tall, has even
the stoic Coach Wytze Gorter smil
ing, so he must be a prospect.
First Game U.S.C.
Monday, December 6, the first
game for the varsity without side
competition will be held in the Pa
vilion, against the Olympic Club of
San Francisco. The next night
Bunn's boys travel to San Jose for
a game with the San Jose State
Spartans, the only other game before
! the intersectional tour begins De
