# Big Red Machine Rolls Uphill To End Second
## 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Who would have thought last Sep- I
tember that Stanford would finish
second in the 1937 conference foot
ball race?
The Big Red Machine started at
rock bottom, rolled uphill contin
uously to a Big Game Peak, and
then began ist return trip on the
down grade.
Begin with Loss
It was a blistering hot day Sep
tember 25, when Santa Clara sent
a fine squad of gridders to the Farm
to defeat the Indians, 13-7. The
home team gained only 20 yards on
the ground, opened up an aerial at
tack in the last four minutes of the
game, and gained 100 yards in the
air.
A week later the Cards went north
to meet their second defeat, 7-6, to
the Oregon Webfeet. This time the
Reds looked better. They gained
376 yards against the northerners'
200. Greatest disappointment to
Stanford fans was Paulman's shoul
der injury early in the game.
O.K. in Practice
And while the Indians seemed to
be failing on the scoreboard, they
were sensational in practice. It was
simply a matter of using their po
tential skill in a game.
Tiny shuffled the deck, and the
Big Red Machine trounced the
U.C.L.A. bruins in the Stanford Sta
dium, 12-7. The machine was den
nitely on the upward slope.
Win Over Washington
After a two weeks' rest, the In
dians trimmed Washington at Se
attle, 13-7. The game was full of
breaks for Stanford. But the breaks
were really hard-earned, and the
Cards knew what to do with them.
It rained on the Farm the next
week, and the Indians and Oregon
State Beavers played 60 minutes of
colorless football with a wet ball for
a scoreless tie.
Trojans Fall
Stanford rooters went wild in Los
Angeles when Doc Luckett topped
off Peter Fay's touchdown for a 7-6
victory over the highly favored
University of Southern California
Trojans. Paulman's excellent kick
ing saved the day defensively.
On its way to what was destined
to be a close and hard-fought Big
Game, the Big Red Machine stop
ped off in home territory to deal the
Washington State Cougars a 23-0
blow, the greatest margin of the
season for the Redskins.
The Indians reached their peak
despite rain and mud in the Big

Game, hut they lost to a distinctly |
superior University of California
combination, 13-0. Both scores were 1
made while an integral part of Stan- I
ford's first string sat on the bench. :
Psychologically in bad shape after j
toss of the Big Game and cancella
tion of the proposed journey to the ,
land of the hula dancers, the Stan- !
ford boys were held to a scoreless
tie by Sid Luckman and his aides
from Columbia University in cold
New York.
So the Stanford boys claimed sec- '
ond place in the conference by four j
victories, one tie, and two defeats; ,
and lost their two non-conference |
contests.

a fine squad of gridders to the Farm
to defeat the Indians, 13-7. The
home team gained only 20 yards on
the ground, opened up an aerial at
tack in the last four minutes of the
game, and gained 100 yards in the
air.
A week later the Cards went north
to meet their second defeat, 7-6, to
the Oregon Webfeet. This time the
Reds looked better. They gained
376 yards against the northerners'
200. Greatest disappointment to
Stanford fans was Paulman's shoul
der injury early in the game.
O.K. in Practice
And while the Indians seemed to
be failing on the scoreboard, they
were sensational in practice. It was
simply a matter of using their po
tential skill in a game.
Tiny shuffled the deck, and the
Big Red Machine trounced the
U.C.L.A. bruins in the Stanford Sta
dium, 12-7. The machine was den
nitely on the upward slope.
Win Over Washington
After a two weeks' rest, the In
dians trimmed Washington at Se
attle, 13-7. The game was full of
breaks for Stanford. But the breaks
were really hard-earned, and the
Cards knew what to do with them.
It rained on the Farm the next
week, and the Indians and Oregon
State Beavers played 60 minutes of
colorless football with a wet ball for
a scoreless tie.
Trojans Fall
Stanford rooters went wild in Los
Angeles when Doc Luckett topped
off Peter Fay's touchdown for a 7-6
victory over the highly favored
University of Southern California
Trojans. Paulman's excellent kick
ing saved the day defensively.
On its way to what was destined
to be a close and hard-fought Big
Game, the Big Red Machine stop
ped off in home territory to deal the
Washington State Cougars a 23-0
blow, the greatest margin of the
season for the Redskins.
The Indians reached their peak
despite rain and mud in the Big

Game, hut they lost to a distinctly |
superior University of California
combination, 13-0. Both scores were 1
made while an integral part of Stan- I
ford's first string sat on the bench. :
Psychologically in bad shape after j
toss of the Big Game and cancella
tion of the proposed journey to the ,
land of the hula dancers, the Stan- !
ford boys were held to a scoreless
tie by Sid Luckman and his aides
from Columbia University in cold
New York.
So the Stanford boys claimed sec- '
ond place in the conference by four j
victories, one tie, and two defeats; ,
and lost their two non-conference |
contests.
Who would have thought last Sep- I
tember that Stanford would finish
second in the 1937 conference foot
ball race?
The Big Red Machine started at
rock bottom, rolled uphill contin
uously to a Big Game Peak, and
then began ist return trip on the
down grade.

It was a blistering hot day Sep
