## You Wouldn't Know the Old Girl

DIAGNOSTICIANS of the ailing Tuesday eve
ning lecture series have repeatedly asso
ciated the cause of weak attendance with a
tendency to present academic programs that
bore too close a resemblance to the daily rou
tine of classroom lectures. Students circum
vented the evening lecture because it appeared
to be just a little more of what they had been
through all day on the Quad.
This year's rejuvenated Public Exercises Com
mittee, recognizing this difficulty, has sunk its
teeth into the deal and is beginning to shake the
aged conception of the stereotype. It is out to
prove that Tuesday evening lectures are not
"always dull." In its attempt to shed the musty
raiment of seasons back, it considered changing
the name of the series—then decided to try
plastic surgery on the old face.
Tonight's lecture is exemplary of the new
trend, wherein the old educational qualification
is still fulfilled, but wrapped in popular sheath
of light, not-too-cultural entertainment. From
the Paramount lot, the Committee has brought

the "Diary of a Movie Idea."
Ralph Jester of Paramount's Educational De
partment, which chops out the historical shots
from entertainment films, brings several of
these educational shorts to illustrate his work in
the salvage of this valuable educational mate
rial from entertainment films.
With Memorial Hall's most modern of pro
jection and sound equipment, the Jester lecture
and illustrative material should go great guns—
if sufficient Stanford audience shuns the tra
ditional Tuesday evening bugaboo and accepts
a good thing when offered.
Like most Stanford people we have never
been particularly enthused about Tuesday eve
ning lectures and were quite content to let Palo
Altans have the dubious honor of filling the
old Assembly Hall's veneered seats and of shiv
ering through the evening.
Tonight, with red plush, plenty of knee room,
no icicles on the chandeliers, and a pleasant
evening of light entertainment promised, we're
going to slip over and see how the old Tuesday
evening hag looks with her face lifted.
