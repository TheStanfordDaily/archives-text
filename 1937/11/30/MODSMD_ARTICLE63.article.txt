# What Rough?

WTJE does not consider himself (a) quite as
JLi handsome as Robert Taylor, (b) as intelli
gent as Einstein, (c) as finished a raconteur as
Woollcott, (d) as graceful as Astaire, (e) as com
pelling as Casanova, and as masculine as white
cotton socks.
"But he is open to argument.
"And he does, nevertheless, consider himself
—to the exclusion of all others the most brilliant
star in the scholar system —the average college
male!"
Or so runs the opinion of Average College
Columnist Jack Kelly of the Minnesota Daily,
who must have been taken in by the five-year
old bromidic definition of "collegiate." For
1937's typical student is different, far different
from the egotist described by Kelly. At least
the new model Stanford "rough" is. "Rough"
definitely should be in quotes, however.
For, if you can believe underground murmurs
and intramural mumbles—the "rough" is suf
fering, not from over development of the ego,
but from a slight attack of inferiorious com
plexeus.
His attitudes toward football, women, and the
other important things in life remain unchanged,
but his opinion of himself in relation to these
subjects is not at all what Kelly makes it out
to be. For during the last few years the "rough"
has begun to grow up. It is a gradual process
and must be carefully nurtured before blossom
ing forth into a significant change.
Chief symptom of this coming of age is an
increased interest in outside affairs. Other evi
dences are the' increasing popularity of the

shaving habit and growing patronization of the
cleaners.
Stanford "rough" for 1937 is right in the
middle of this "adolescent" period. He is grow
ing away from a juvenile, world-beating self
confidence and is beginning to learn his true
relation to the general scheme of things.
If this development continues, he will soon
be in position to put the lie to Jack Kelly, whose
classmates must have been exceptions or badly
maligned.—J. R.
