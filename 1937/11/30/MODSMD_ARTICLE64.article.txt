# BULL SESSION
## WHAT'S SO DAMN FUNNY? 
### 
AT the moment, America is having a grand time
patting itself on the back about the way it has
received the popular satire, "I'd Rather Be Right.
Commentators tell us that "fundamental American
humor" makes us snicker at a play that would give a
Fascist apoplexy. Observers glow with pride as they
note our national sense of humor which makes audi
ences grin when in other countries they would try to
get out before the riot squad came.
As a matter of fact, we can afford to be a little
proud of our attitude toward the play. It is a frank,
unveiled satire on the Administration, and like the
one-piece bathing suit, it conceals nothing. Under a
dictatorship it would cause a blood purge, martial law,
and a frightful mortality rate for officials. Hitler abol
ished university secret societies, so we are told, for
.speculating on the way He ate His asparagus. But
Roosevelt reads about "I'd Rather Be Right" and goes
off on a fishing trip, or tries to catch up in his corre
spondence with Congress. The American Public
chuckles and tries to find a reasonable scalpel".
* * * *
All this is very fine and commendable. It makes
a good argument when you get in a row with some
body who believes Roosevelt wears a crown under his
silk topper. But the fact that we snicker at "I'd Rather
Be Right" does not mean that a sense of humor is a
"fundamental American trait." It does not mean that
we have a gift of laughter which will make riot, revo
lution, blood in the gutter, and imbeciles in office
forever an impossibility.
On the contrary, it seems that a sense of humor is
one of the most scarce traits in America. It is not as
rare, of course, as in Russia, where they have to shoot
a general to make the balcony stop whispering, or as
in Germany where they cure ideologies with castor
oil. But a good sense of humor is entirely too rare
here to warrant the assumption that we can laugh
our way out of trouble.
* * * *
IT appears that American officials and American Pub
lic laugh more often from necessity than from
choice, and that when they do not have to laugh, they
can be very nasty indeed. The While House, if we
can believe the papers, did not resound with hearty
guffaws when the Supreme Court declared an open
season on New Deal legislation. Cagy business men
were not jollied into joining the NRA.
There is also a shortage of humor in other fields.
Republicans still need a block and tackle to get their
faces back to normal length.
♦ * # *i
Even in the universities, where supposedly our bur
dens are lightest, gay laughter does not ring contin
ually. Recently we have seen the Cal Ex Committee
attempt to censor the newspaper in a way that was
hardly dictated by a sense of humor.
It is very nice that we can laugh at "I'd Rather
Be Right." It would also be very nice if this case
were not so unusual that wo pat. ourselves on the
back about it.

Even in the universities, where supposedly our bur
dens are lightest, gay laughter does not ring contin
ually. Recently we have seen the Cal Ex Committee
attempt to censor the newspaper in a way that was
hardly dictated by a sense of humor.
It is very nice that we can laugh at "I'd Rather

AT the moment, America is having a grand time
patting itself on the back about the way it has
received the popular satire, "I'd Rather Be Right.
Commentators tell us that "fundamental American
humor" makes us snicker at a play that would give a
Fascist apoplexy. Observers glow with pride as they
note our national sense of humor which makes audi
ences grin when in other countries they would try to
get out before the riot squad came.
As a matter of fact, we can afford to be a little
proud of our attitude toward the play. It is a frank,
unveiled satire on the Administration, and like the
one-piece bathing suit, it conceals nothing. Under a
dictatorship it would cause a blood purge, martial law,
and a frightful mortality rate for officials. Hitler abol
ished university secret societies, so we are told, for
.speculating on the way He ate His asparagus. But
Roosevelt reads about "I'd Rather Be Right" and goes
off on a fishing trip, or tries to catch up in his corre
spondence with Congress. The American Public
chuckles and tries to find a reasonable scalpel".
* * * *
All this is very fine and commendable. It makes
a good argument when you get in a row with some
body who believes Roosevelt wears a crown under his
silk topper. But the fact that we snicker at "I'd Rather
Be Right" does not mean that a sense of humor is a
"fundamental American trait." It does not mean that
we have a gift of laughter which will make riot, revo
lution, blood in the gutter, and imbeciles in office
forever an impossibility.
On the contrary, it seems that a sense of humor is
one of the most scarce traits in America. It is not as
rare, of course, as in Russia, where they have to shoot
a general to make the balcony stop whispering, or as
in Germany where they cure ideologies with castor
oil. But a good sense of humor is entirely too rare
here to warrant the assumption that we can laugh
our way out of trouble.
* * * *
IT appears that American officials and American Pub
lic laugh more often from necessity than from
choice, and that when they do not have to laugh, they
can be very nasty indeed. The While House, if we
can believe the papers, did not resound with hearty
guffaws when the Supreme Court declared an open
season on New Deal legislation. Cagy business men
were not jollied into joining the NRA.
