We have grown suspicious of our reading mat
ter since those early days when we really believed
that Mr. Hearst swam out to the Golden Gate
every night to give the alarm in case of Japanese
invasion. But until today we had a remaining
idol in "Time," and have relied on it increasingly
since we no longer have time to read newspapers.
But now our idol is smashed. In a recent article
in Wisconsin Daily Cardinal, "Time" is lumped
with other weeklies as a poisoner of the public
mind. Statements that Liberty and The Saturday
Evening Post arc opinionated glanced oIT, but the
words below left us bereft.

"Time," the weekly newsmagazine, consistently re
fers to itself as being "factual,' "objective," "impartial,"
"unbiased." And most of its readers believe this and
agree. When they read "Time" they are certain that
they are getting the straight goods and let it go at
that. "The Nation," however, in a series of articles
last spring demonstrated that "Time's" "impartiality"
and "objectivity" are pure myth.
As the "Nation" points out, the careful and con
scientious reader will discover that "Time" is friendly
toward Italy, dictators, big business; unfriendly toward
labor, radical movements, Russia, the national admin
istration. Wisconsin students last year may have been
amazed to read that the great liberal Glenn Frank was
the victim of the dictatorial LaFollette steam roller.
"Time" used the incident to discredit the entire pro
gressive movement in Wisconsin.
Those who arc sufficiently discerning to see through
"Time's" frequent misrepresentations of certain phases
of a week's happenings, find the magazine distinctly
valuable. For nowhere is there to be found a more
concise, interesting and inclusive recording of the
news of the week. Upon the more unsuspecting, how
ever, "Time" wreaks considerable mental havoc.

If magazine readers are unaware that they are
reading the gospel, according to the "forces of
intrenched greed," its then too much to expect that the
gospel will not eventually take effect. Overnight,
should the wind show any indication of blowing in
that direction, could "The Saturday Evening Post,"
"Liberty" and "Time" easily become the direct spokes
men of a fascist movement in this country.
Well aware was the American public of the posi
tion that 85 per cent of the nation's press had been
taking prevoius to Mr. Roogevelt's re-election. The
press was unmistakably repudiated. It would seem that
when the American public is brought to understand
that its favorite weekly magazines are in the same
class with the Chicago Tribune, only then will the
"Post" and its cohorts command comparable respect.
