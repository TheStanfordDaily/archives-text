# Bridge Novel Has Charm, Fascination
## 
### 
The Marchesa Suzy di Vil' Alta
was a great lady in the province of
Gardone in Italy 30 years ago. Al
mina Prestwich was only a quiet
little governess from England. There
was bound to be a clash when "the

"little Postiche"
met "The En
chantress," and in
relating the story
of what hap
pened, Anne
Bridge has writ
ten in "Enchant
er's Nightshade"
a book as blandly
fasc i n a ting as
Suzy herself.

When Almina came from Eng
land, she was, as the Vil' Altas and
their* cousins, the Castellones, could
see, "a harmless little thing." It was
not until Roffredo Castellone de
serted Suzy to lay his heai*t at her
feet that this way of looking at
Postiche began to change; but once
the change began, it took no time at
all for the two houses to be split
from top to bottom.
The first open indication of trouble
came when Almina found herself
summarily dismissed by Suzy, with
out pay, and without passage home.
Forced to throw herself on Rof
fredo's mercy, she became at once
a bone of contention which, before
her stay in Gardone ended, had
jolted her out of her innocence, dis
turbed the families, and almost
caused Suzy to die of pneumonia.
Miss Bridge's story is not com
pletely dominated by any one char
acter. Maintaining a nice balance
between them, she presents the Old
Marchesa, conserving her strength
one minute in order to reach her
hundredth birthday, and expending
it the next to preserve sanity among
her troubled descendants; earnest
Giulio Castellone, wtih his passion
ate search for learning; the old Swiss
governess, Frau Gelsicher; the
dashing Roffredo; unscrupulous
Suzy, and the gentle Almina.
Written with a completely charm
ing lack of morals, "Enchanter's
Nightshade" succeeds very well in
presenting a distinctive setting and
a group of highly interesting char
acters. â€”A. S. D.
