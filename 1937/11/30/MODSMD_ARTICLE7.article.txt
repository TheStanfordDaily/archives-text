SHAGNHAI, Tuesday, Nov. 30
(UP). â€”The Japanese army, heart
ened by radio broadcasts announc
ing Italy's diplomatic recognition of
Manchukuo, drove across the flat
plains of Kiangsi Province and deep
into Anhwei Province today in an
effort to occupy Nanking, China's
partly abandoned national capital,
within a fortnight.
There was fcn increasing belief
that the Japanese soon might an
nounce a formal declaration of war
to regularize the naval blockade of
China's coast and convince Chinese
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek that
further resistance will result only in
increasingly difficult, peace terms.
