### 
Professor Hardin Craig, dean of
the school of letters, will speak at
Luncheon Club meeting today at
noon in the Women's Clubhouse on
"Education and Career; a Distinc
tion."
Professor Craig is generally
known to be a vigorous critic of the
present tendency to give vocational
education and in favor of offering
cultural rather than vocational
training, and will discuss his views
on this subject at the meeting.
All students and faculty members
interested may attend, according to
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, sponsor of
the club.
