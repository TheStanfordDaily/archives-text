ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 30 (UP).
â€”Fritz Kreisler, noted Austrian vio
j linist, had to stop in the middle of
! his concert at Hull Auditorium last
j night while more than 50 people beat
a hasty exit. Someone had dis
; charged a tear gas shell and the first
three rows were cleared. "It must
have been some little freshman
joke." Kreisler said later.
