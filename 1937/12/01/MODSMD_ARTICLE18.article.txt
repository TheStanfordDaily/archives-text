# Nitery Fountain Plan Considered By Ex Committee
## Ski Club Given Recognition; Stagers' Constitution Approved 
### JIM STONE 
If the Nitcry's condition of not drawing Hies continues to exist, it won t
be Ex Committee's fault. Newest plan to inject the campus nite-spot with
a monkey gland rejuvenation solution was considered last night, when
A1 Hyman reported on the possibility of installing a soda fountain.
From his investigations of cost of the fountain and installation. Ex
fi.mllv decided that no final

step which would involve the ex
penditure of a large sum, should be
taken until some sort of a gauge to
student reaction to the innovation
was taken. It was variously sug
gested that the Union hashers might
be persuaded to trot up and down
with coke orders, or that an ice-box
might be installed with soft drinks
to test the added attraction of
liquid refreshments in the Nitery.
Suggest Ice Cream
Bob Garretson suggested that a
local creamery might install an ice
cream box, and it was this sugges
tion that Ex Com finally decided to
consider. Garretson will report next
meeting on this possibility, and the
committee will then reconsider the
refreshment scheme for the Nitery.
The suggestion to install a fountain
will be dropped until this temporary
plan has been tested.
Stanford's Ski Club, led by Willy
Meyer and boasting a membership
of 300, requested and was granted
official student body recognition, by
Ex Committee last night.
No Sunday Fashions
The request of the Ski Club to put
on a fashion show, displaying ski
costumes furnished by local stores,
on the Sunday night movie program
was dinged, as appearing too much
like carrying out the prophecy of
Reverend Oscar Green: that the
Sunday night movies would lead to
other attractions. It was suggested
that ushers and usherettes might be
dressed in the ski costumes.
The revised constitution of Stan
ford Stagers was submitted to the
committee, and was approved, pend
ing final okay, by President Wilbur.
â– At the same time, the charter for
the new Dramatic Council was in
troduced, was taken by Tom Killc
fer to be reviewed before final pre
sentation to Ex Committee.
