### 
Dr .Donald M. Erb, associate pro
fessor of economics, yesterday ac
cepted the position of President of
the University of Oregon, upon ap
pointment by the Oregon Board of
Higher Education.
Dr. Erb last night said that, he will !
transfer to the northern school at
the end of winter quarter and "will i
fill the job as he finds it," rather I
than plan activities at the present j
time.
Returns to Eugene
Coming to Stanford four years j
ago to take up duties with the eco- j
nomics department, Dr. Erb will re- j
turn to the Eugene campus, where J
he was first an assistant professor
and then held a full professorship
of economics during six years.
Born in 1900. Dr. Erb will become
the youngest university president in
the history of the Oregon institu
tion at the age of 37 years. He will
succeed Dr. C. Valentine Boyer, who j
resigned last June due to ill heatlh.
Faville Considered
Among the group of five outstand- j
ing educators considered by the l
board to fill the position was also i
Dr. David E. Faville of the Stanford
School of Business.
Dr. Erb was born in Bx-ooklyn,
N.Y., and is the son of J. Lawrence
Erb, who is now head of the music
department of Connecticut College
for Women.
Graduating from the University of
Illinois in 1922 and earning an M.S.
degree in 1924, he entered private
business for a year in Peoria, but
decided to continue academic work
at Harvard, where he was awarded
both an M.S. and his doctorate.
Awarded Prize
For outstanding graduate work at
Harvard, Dr. Erb won the coveted
Ricar.do Prize in 1927, and is consid
ered an authority on economic his
tory and the economics of transpor
tation and public utility systems.
While at Stanford, Dr. Erb has
also conducted a study of the de
pression history of Oroville, which
he took as a typical California com
munity, and from which he has been
able to trace a picture of depression
decline and recovery which has
proved of great significance to
economists. *
