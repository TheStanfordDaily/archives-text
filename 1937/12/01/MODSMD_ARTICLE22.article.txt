### 
LONDON, Nov. 30 (UP). —The premiers and foreign ministers of Great
Britain and Prance, groping for a solution to Europe's troubles, agreed
today to satisfy "in principle" Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's demands for the
restoration of colonies stripped from Germany after the World War.
The statesmen in a historic two-day conference decided to propose

an international "pooling" of colo-<
nies for German exploitation.
But they left the next move up to
Hitler and demanded that he aban
don his militaristic defiance and
sit down and talk things over
peaceably.
The projected colonies "pool' will
be the reward, according to the au
thoritatively outlined plan, if the
Reichsfuehrer gives rigid assurances
that he is ready to contribute to a |
plan of durable peace.
The tossing of the Reich's former
colonies into one basket to satisfy
Hitler's claims would require con
sent from several other powers and
dominions holding territorial man
dates.
The British and French govern
ments immediately notified Belgium,
which holds a league mandate over
part of the former German terri
tories in East Africa, of their de
cision.
Japan, however, was not notified
although she acquired German
islands in the Pacific.
It was stated authoritatively that
no further formal approach would
be made to Germany until after
diplomatic exchanges between Paris
and London on a definite plan.
