# Coed Increase Report Denied
## Larger Quota Rumors False, Says Dean 
### 
Campus reports that the Univer
sity is contemplating an increased
enrollment quota for freshmen wom
en were emphatically denied yester
day afternoon by Dean Mary Yost,
who declared that "there is not a
word of truth in such rumors."
According to the reports, plans for
a significant increase next autumn
quarter in the number of first-year
women allowed to enroll were under
consideration. The same reports as
serted that new dormitories, prob
ably off-campus, would be opened
as a result of the higher enrollment.
Pointing out that even if such
proposals were under consideration,
they would not come before the
University until next spring, Miss
Yost declared that reports of an in
crease in the present women's en
rollment of 1100 are without any
foundation.
Only enrollment changes now be
ing planned are merely routine, Miss
Yost said, and relate to the admis
sion of about 40 new freshmen
women winter quarter.
The exact number to be admitted
will be determined probably next
week by the University admission
committee, following closing of the
period for room reservations.
