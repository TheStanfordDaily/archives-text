### 
SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Dec. 1
(UP). —Japanese officials were re
ported today to be prepared to re
turn the seized American tug Fei
ting and apologize for their action
in confiscating it if the vessel is
found to be a legitimately owned
American ship.

general in Shanghai, filed an imme
diate protest with the Japanese

Ship Thought Chinese
It was understood the Japanese
based their action in seizing the ship
on a suspicion that it really is Chi
nese-owned and merely was trans
ferred to American interests to pre
vent it from being taken by the
Japanese as a war prize.
The ship—a big steam tug—was
seized late yesterday at the Kinlee-
Yuan wharf in the Whangpoo River
off the French Concession.
U.S. Flag Torn Down
Witnesses said that an American
flag flying on it was torn down and
thrown into the river and that a
wooden plaque, showing its Ameri
can ownership, was torn from the
bridge-house by a Japanese sailor
who cracked it on the head of a
Chinese member of the ship's crew.
The Japanese simultaneously
seized two tugs flying the Italian
flag-
All the vessels were towed down
the river past the U. S. Cruiser Au
gusta and the Italian Cruiser Monte
Cuccolo which were anchored off
the International Settlement.
Consuls Protest
It was understood that U. S. Con
sul General Clarence Gauss imme
diately registered a protest with the
Japanese consulate general and re
ported the incident to the State De
partment in Washington.
The Italian consulate general was
reported to have made a similar
protest.
Gauss was said to have been par
ticularly incensed at the desecra
tion of the U.S. flag and to have
told .the Japanese that in the future
they must respect the flag. It was
understood he said the flag can be
touched only with the American
consul general's specific permission.
