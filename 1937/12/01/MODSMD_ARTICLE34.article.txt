## Soccer Team To Meet San Mateo Today Cards Point To Second Place in Conference; Season Nears Close 
### GENE GEAR, Sports Editor 
Stanford's 1937 soccer season goes
into its final stages this afternoon at
3:30 o'clock when the Indian booters
meet San Mateo Jaysee on the Farm
field, leaving them one more game
to be played Saturday morning at
U.S.F. Dons.
Out of the running for the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Conference
title which California's Bears
clinched last week for the second
consecutive year, the Cardinal soc
cermen are now pointing toward un
disputed possession of second place,
which they now hold jointly with the
S.F.U. Dons.
Both teams have won four games
and lost two, and both have two
more contests left on their sched
ules. If the Indians and Dons win
their penultimate games today, the
contest Saturday should decide the
runner-up in the final standings.
Coach Harry Maloney, seeking
another victory over San Mateo,
whom the Cards defeated easily 2-0,
in the opening game of the season,
indicated that he will take no
chances and will start his strongest
line-up which will be as follows:
Faulk, goalie; Edwards, fullback;
Hanna, fullback; Cuthbertson, half
back; Sloane, halfback; Hatch, half
back; de Benedetti, outside left;
Pellas, inside left; Schaupp, center
forward; Sadullah, inside right;
Parker, outside right.
