panthers pull prize
COMMERCIALISM STUNT
Commercialism in college athlet
ics has been taken for granted these
many years, but it was left up to
(he Pittsburgh football players to
come right out into the open with
one of the most startling acts in the
history of amateur college athletics.
Those Panthers, who went through
the season undefeated and were tied
only by Fordham, weren't the least
bit backward when they were asked
to vote on the favorability of accept
ing a bid to play in the Rose Bowl
against the Bears.
The players themselves accom
plished what 10 other teams have
been unable to do all season —keep
Pittsburgh out of the Rose Bowl.
And if you want my humble opin
ion, their action is going to keep the
Panthers out of Pasadena for quite
some years to come.
The Pitt gridders weren't shy in
asking for actual cash-on-the-line
remuneration for playing the New
Year's game, Their reasoning tells
them that the University gets $100,-
000 out of the game so why shouldn't
the players share in the profits?
PITT BOYS WANT
PAY—OR ELSE
Here are the Pittsburgh players'
reported demands: Each player is to
receive from $150 to $200 apiece for
"spending money." The team is to
be granted two weeks vacation
from school and also from training.
And the full squad is to be taken on
the trip west.
Revolving out of this was what is
supposed to be the first sit-down
strike in college athletics.
MANAGERS, DIPPY ONES
STAGE AQUATIC I RAY
At last . .. it is almost upon us
. . . the battle of the century . . .
the greatest aquatic struggle of all
time . . . the womenting fray be
tween the Dippy sports staff and the
water polo managers.
This titanic water polo game has
at last been definitely set for
this afternoon at 4 o'clock in
the Encina Pool that is only 20
yards long, but alas, is 12 feet deep
in all parts.
The Dippy ones to sign up so far
include John "No Spirit" Shallen
berger, Phil "Waterwings" Klauber,
Walt "Rockbound" Peterson, Harry
"Herring" Press, Dave "Sink or
Swim" Botsford, Bob "Ferryboat"
Glikbarg, and yours truly . . .
