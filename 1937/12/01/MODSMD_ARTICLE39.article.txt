# Waterpoloists Wind Up Year Of Few Wins
## Cards Guard Basement As U.C.L.A., Bears Seek Championship 
### 
While California and U.C.L.A. are
still angling for a conference water
polo championship play-off, Stanford
sits serenely on the bottom rung of
the league ladder with a thought
that the season just ended could have
been worse.
All of the Indian defeats were by
small margins with the exception of
the insult dealt by Cal in the last
game, which the Bears won 7 to 1.
Coach Nort Thornton's squad regis
tered wins over the Olympic Club,
San Jose State, and U.S.C. among
others, and displayed a few men
who should win All-Coast ranking.
Leading Scorer
Johnny Lamb was again the scor
ing threat of the Indians and led the
entire squad in net goals. Captain
Bill Hanna, playing his last year,
worked in four different positions
before he moved back to his old
forward spot. But Hanna proved to
be the main cog and the guiding in
fluence that kept some games as
close as they were.
Bill Burns at goal was probably
the most sensational of the unexpe
rienced players. Unless the All-Star
pickers shut their eyes while they
select their teams, Burns should be
a cinch for recognition. His amaz
ing defensive game in the first Bear
game was the best bit of goal-guard
ing any man on the Coast has shown
since Bob Haslacher filled the net for
Stanford last year.
Good Guards
Before it crumbled in the last
game, the Stanford rear guard of
Bill Hatch, Dick Hoover, and Art
Allen was standing up well despite
the fact that a flimsy offense was able
to bag only one or two goals a game.
Bob Plate, Jack Vibert, Bill Blee
ker, and Harvey Rothschild per
formed creditably without experi
ence. Vibert, one of the fastest swim
mers in school, also graduates in
June.
At any rate, the Indians will have
a host of veterans back next fall
and with a crop of good men up from
the frosh might again win a title
that had been a Stanford monopoly
for 25 years.

game, which the Bears won 7 to 1.
Coach Nort Thornton's squad regis
tered wins over the Olympic Club,
San Jose State, and U.S.C. among
others, and displayed a few men
who should win All-Coast ranking.
Leading Scorer
Johnny Lamb was again the scor
ing threat of the Indians and led the
entire squad in net goals. Captain
Bill Hanna, playing his last year,
worked in four different positions
before he moved back to his old
forward spot. But Hanna proved to
be the main cog and the guiding in
fluence that kept some games as
close as they were.
Bill Burns at goal was probably
the most sensational of the unexpe
rienced players. Unless the All-Star
pickers shut their eyes while they
select their teams, Burns should be
a cinch for recognition. His amaz
ing defensive game in the first Bear
game was the best bit of goal-guard
ing any man on the Coast has shown
since Bob Haslacher filled the net for
Stanford last year.
Good Guards
Before it crumbled in the last
game, the Stanford rear guard of
Bill Hatch, Dick Hoover, and Art
Allen was standing up well despite
the fact that a flimsy offense was able
to bag only one or two goals a game.
Bob Plate, Jack Vibert, Bill Blee
ker, and Harvey Rothschild per
formed creditably without experi
ence. Vibert, one of the fastest swim
mers in school, also graduates in
June.
At any rate, the Indians will have
a host of veterans back next fall
and with a crop of good men up from
the frosh might again win a title
that had been a Stanford monopoly
for 25 years.

China is a warm temperate, rather
han a tropical land.
