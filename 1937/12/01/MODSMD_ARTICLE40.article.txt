## Guard Race Close As Christmas Trip Set 
### 
With a wide open fight for the
two guard positions featured in prac
tice, Stanford's frosh basketballers
are continuing their spirited compe
tition for the 12 berths on the Christ
mas vacaiton barnstorming tour. On
their trip the frosfi will meet Marin,
Santa Rosa and Placer Junior Col
leges on successive nights.
Ed DeMoss has catapulted him
self from nowhere, right into the,
thick of the fight for the guard spots.
DeMoss, Bud Jones, Bob Stone, Bill
Rumbley, Bill Niccolls and John
Alltucker all take turns looking hot
and cold and Coach Wytze Gorter
has been playing various combina
tions trying to get his "ace."
On the forward line, the situation
is a little more settled. Don Wil
liams of Oakland High, sparkplug of
the team, has been holding forth on
one forward in great style. There
isn't anything the alert Williams
can't do well. .
Opposite him is Bill Masters, fast
and rugged. Closely pressing Wil
liams and Masters are Bill Marshall
and Bill Schroeder. Marshall, the
smallest man on the team, is a dead
eye shot with either hand and is
handicapped only by his size.
At center is Dick Taylor, 6 feet
midget, who is constantly improv
ing. If Taylor is hot Saturday, Gor
ter figures the freshmen will extend
the varisty in their annual scrim
mage.
The freshmen boast of unusual
height this year and if one or two
of the key men perform up to ex
pectations they should have a very
successful season.
Coach Gorter will not announce
the barnstorming personnel until the
last practice a week from Friday.
