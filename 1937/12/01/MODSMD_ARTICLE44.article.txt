## Spotlight in the Gold-Dusty Corner

PITTSBURGH'S commercialistic Panthers
made national news yesterday when they
committed the rather heinous crime of letting
John Public in on a secret cherished by every
"inside" sportsman since post-season football
epics became the thing to do. Pitt dumped the
cart and temporarily spoiled the "insiders' "
fun, but that is about all.
The boys on the know will tell you some
interesting things about post-season football.
It's a characteristic of those colorful New Year's
Day classics that everyone has a mighty fine
time but the ball teams—especially if the same
club played that classic the previous year.
Put yourself in the ball player's spot. Last
year you kept training through the Christmas
holidays and vetoed the trip home because the
ball club was going to play in somebody's bowl
to win honor and a hundred thousand dollars
for the alma mater. You would be honored, too,
and ninety thousand people would scream your
name.
But you wouldn't care much about having
ninety thousand people scream your name be
cause you'd been hearing people do it all sea
son. You had to be part of a good team to get
the bowl bid.
That was last year, but you went and played
a good game, and heard people scream, and
made money for the alma mater, and didn't
have a very good Christmas.
And now you're 'fed up with football after
another season, but you've still got the same
good ball club, and somebody asks you to
play in somebody's sugar, or orange, or rose,
or other kind of bowl. You don't feel very
honored this time because you know it just

means that you'll play another good game, and
hear people scream, and make money for the
school—and not get home for the holidays. So
you decide to do something about it.
You get the gang together, decide that you
want a cut in the hundred thousand to play in
somebody's bowl. Also you ask for a vacation
to see the folks, because you lose the Christ
mas holidays. And you think the athletic con
trollers ought to take the goofs along too, 'cause
they've worked just as hard as you have all
season. That's the least the alma mater can
do for you. Aren't you making them a clean
hundred grand?
Thus far the procedure is the same whether
you're at Pitt or any place else that trades in
post-season football. The next step is dependent
on whom you play for.
At Pitt you'll make your demands and an
undiplomatic official will say "no" and you'll
scream so loud it bounces against the Pacific
Coast.
If you're somewhere else you'll explain
what you want, and they'll say, "Let's work this
thing out quietly, boys." And that's what you
do. They quietly make it worth your while to
play the football classic of the year. And it's
almost fun to hear everyone screaming your
name when you think of the wallet back in the
dressing room.
There are undoubtedly a lot of disappointed
sports authorities weeping silently to them
selves tonight. It's a shame that those nasty
Pitt boys weren't smooth enough to keep the
cat in the bag on post-season games. But
they've gone and done it, and now everyone
knows.
It was all so much fun while it lasted.
