MARITAL relations honeymoon cottage at
Stanford is going to be a full house, it
was shown yesterday when pre-registration for
Personal Problems in Modern Society, new
course on economic and social relationships in
marriage, reached the set limit and left an
overflow of more than 100 students.
Such a response must be gratifying to the
students and faculty members who worked to
have the study added to the curriculum. Their
belief that college students wanted such infor
mation has been justified.
But it gives this group a new problem to
solve. Either a means of admitting all the ap
plicants must be devised, or a criterion of se
lecting those with the greatest need must be
found.
The group need look no further than its own
syllabus, and probably won't.
There it should find some discussion of the
increasing economic dependency of marriage
able young people, and of resulting problems

caused by long engagements and late mar
riages. From this, it might be deduced that
seniors only be admitted.
It will be long enough, in many cases, before
even June graduates can give practical appli
cation to information contained in the course.
