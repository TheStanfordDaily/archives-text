BLESSED EVENT
SUBSCRIBERS to The Daily who got up yesterday
k before somebody spilled syrup all over page one
discovered that our curriculum has found another
baby on its doorstep. The news item, hiding coyly in
the unexplored interior of column three, read as fol
lows: "The Stanford glee club director proposed an
extensive course in microphone technique, script writ
ing, and radio production management to fill the
growing demand for collegiate talent on the radio."
The Daily .staff is a little doubtful about the cur
rent rumor that this story will be considered for the
Pulitzer Award. And we do not expect that metro
politan editors will ofTer us a blanket contract when
they read it. But if there are any sentimental souls
on the campus who like to see things grow, if there
{ire any observers who like to watch mighty soaks rise
from a little corn, they will have a lot of fun putting
the story in their scrapbooks.
With this brief mention of the "proposal" there
begins the life cycle of a course for which our sons
and daughters will doubtless pay tuition fees. It will
never be established during our generation but it is
quite probable that in the fullness of time we will
again make checks payable so that Junior can take it.
In case we have among us any innocent children
whose parents never told them that courses*are not
found full grown under a leaf in the time schedule,
it might be wise to sketch the embryonic development
of the average course. Usually it begins with a "pro
posal," which is so small that a thousand of them
would not fill one page of The Daily. Fertilized by
the endowment fund and nourished by the demands
of students it grows slowly. As the embryonic peribd
nears completion, demands come with increasing fre
quency. Finally Ex Committee and the faculty go
into a huddle, and after much travail give birth to the
new course. Normally the process takes about 10 years.
* ♦ * *
present wc have on the campus several courses
in various stages of development. The new study
in personal relations has just been delivered. The
lon.'j; demanded course in typing and stenography is
expected any day now. Parents of the proposed photo
graphic course are working on tiny garments and pos
sessing their souls with patience.
It will be some time before the radio course ap
pears among us. There will have to be suggestions,
plans, studies, investigations, and reports. Sub-com
mittees will probe; discussion groups will have a
beautiful time with pointless brawls where everybody
.sits tense waiting to beat the other man to the floor.
But eventually we shall hear the cultured tones of
Stanford trained men selling us alfalfa breakfast food,
patent razors, and lubricating oils of various sorts.
And when the approaching footsteps approach, we
shall know that they graduated from Stanford. Then
we shall feel a glow of pride as we say, 'I saw that
start." And we will call up the life insurance com
p.iuii'.: and nuke unciiutli noises.
