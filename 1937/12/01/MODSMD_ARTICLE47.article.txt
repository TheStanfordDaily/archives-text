/OVERHEARD in a brief pause between classes was
this confidential message: "We gotta get some of
our boys in the firehouse. Why, the other day when
we turned in a fire alarm, all the Phi Delts came over
with axes and prepared to chop the place down." The
guy wot was talking was a Zete.
The Stanford Daily, being a newspaper, does a lot
of telephoning in its line of business. Sometimes it
acquires by such electrical transcription the joys, the
sorrows, the heartbreaks, the heartaches, and the arte
rio-sclerosis of the campus. Other times all you can
find in the columns is the busy signal. To show, how
ever, to what great lengths of physical endurance
Daily reporters must go to "get the news," I offer
this little story:
A reporter wanted to get an item from the AKL
house. So he dialed the number of the AKL house, or
at least he thought so.
When the "party" dialed answered, the Dailyman
asked, "Is this Alpha Kappa Lambda?"
The dialed party replied, "No, I'm sorry, he's taking
a bath."
All being washed in the blood of the Lambda, no
doubt.
Striding behind that dachshund you see so fre
quently a professor. The dog belongs to the professor
and the professor belongs to the physics department.
The physics department, as you know, has sponsored
the Rhumbatron on the campus, but frowns upon swing
music in the Nitery. The Rhumbatron, according to
report, is to be operated for the benefit of breaking up
the atom, while swing music is good only for shat
tering sleep, according to departmental analysis. The
department frankly admits, however, that until fur
ther investigation is made, that it cannot definitely
state that the Big Apple is not definitely leading to
the destruction of the atom, and several other things.
Be that as it may, and it may be that, the dach
shund is a very popular animal in the physics depart
ment, which speaks well for such a low-browed crea
ture in such a high-browed crowd, and he more or
less has his run of the place.
One time a visiting professor was flashing one
of those high-voltage lectures, when the culvert crep
er rubbed himself into the room. The department
head passed off the affair lightly, saying to the visitor
not to let the dog bother him, because when lectures
were good, the dog usually made many entrances and
exits.
The track-laying mammal then proceeded to flatter
the regular departmental staff by collapsing himself
onto himself and staying in the room during the rest
of the period.
At another time the world's greatest Rhumbatron
ruminator was delivering of himself a lecture, when
he was interrupted by a student who opened the
door and sneaked into the back of the room. This
brought forth another lecture. The subject was on
how interrupting interruptions were. But this second
lecture was interrupted by scratching on the door.
Absentmindedly, the professor walked over to the
door, blushed when he looked down and realized
amidst titters on every side that he had let the little
quitter fritter in.
Other than that, there isn't much doing in the
physics department these days.

asked, "Is this Alpha Kappa Lambda?"
The dialed party replied, "No, I'm sorry, he's taking
a bath."
All being washed in the blood of the Lambda, no
doubt.
Striding behind that dachshund you see so fre
quently a professor. The dog belongs to the professor
and the professor belongs to the physics department.
The physics department, as you know, has sponsored
the Rhumbatron on the campus, but frowns upon swing
music in the Nitery. The Rhumbatron, according to
report, is to be operated for the benefit of breaking up
the atom, while swing music is good only for shat
tering sleep, according to departmental analysis. The
department frankly admits, however, that until fur
ther investigation is made, that it cannot definitely
state that the Big Apple is not definitely leading to
the destruction of the atom, and several other things.
Be that as it may, and it may be that, the dach
shund is a very popular animal in the physics depart
ment, which speaks well for such a low-browed crea
ture in such a high-browed crowd, and he more or
less has his run of the place.
One time a visiting professor was flashing one
of those high-voltage lectures, when the culvert crep
er rubbed himself into the room. The department
head passed off the affair lightly, saying to the visitor
not to let the dog bother him, because when lectures
were good, the dog usually made many entrances and
exits.
The track-laying mammal then proceeded to flatter
the regular departmental staff by collapsing himself
onto himself and staying in the room during the rest
of the period.
At another time the world's greatest Rhumbatron
ruminator was delivering of himself a lecture, when
he was interrupted by a student who opened the
door and sneaked into the back of the room. This
brought forth another lecture. The subject was on
how interrupting interruptions were. But this second
lecture was interrupted by scratching on the door.
Absentmindedly, the professor walked over to the
door, blushed when he looked down and realized
amidst titters on every side that he had let the little
quitter fritter in.
Other than that, there isn't much doing in the
physics department these days.
/OVERHEARD in a brief pause between classes was
this confidential message: "We gotta get some of
our boys in the firehouse. Why, the other day when
we turned in a fire alarm, all the Phi Delts came over
with axes and prepared to chop the place down." The
guy wot was talking was a Zete.
The Stanford Daily, being a newspaper, does a lot
of telephoning in its line of business. Sometimes it
acquires by such electrical transcription the joys, the
sorrows, the heartbreaks, the heartaches, and the arte
rio-sclerosis of the campus. Other times all you can
find in the columns is the busy signal. To show, how
ever, to what great lengths of physical endurance
Daily reporters must go to "get the news," I offer
this little story:
A reporter wanted to get an item from the AKL
house. So he dialed the number of the AKL house, or
at least he thought so.
When the "party" dialed answered, the Dailyman
asked, "Is this Alpha Kappa Lambda?"
The dialed party replied, "No, I'm sorry, he's taking
a bath."
