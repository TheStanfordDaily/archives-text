# 'Angel' Brings Dietrich Legs In Fair Flick
## 
### 
"Angel" now at the Fox-Stanford
— Most accepted authorities agree
that some time during the first se
; quence of a motion picture the main
character should be introduced and
his usefulness to the plot made

clear. In other
words, the story
should get defi
nitely somewhere
in the first 10
minutes.
Sad but true,
this is not the
case with 'Angel.'
Lovely Marlene
Dietrich wanders
aimlessly through
lovely sets design
ed by lovely Mr.
A. E. Freudman
and come se-

j quence three and we still don't
know our heroine's name. This is
the fault of Director Ernest Lu
■ bitsch, who did all the mystery
| work for the purpose of creating
suspense. The trouble" is that the
1 suspense just doesn't come off, and
so until the plot gets someplace
there is an effect of static beauty
standing still waiting to jell.
Camera Work
Besides the star the camera work
should be given second place in the
beauty contest and the sets come
third. There are no trick shots, but
the one which most effectively cre
ates a maximum of mood is the
! close-up of La Dietrich with her
head tilted at a diagonal angle to
' the screen with a diagonal shadow
i running in the opposite plane in the
background. This use of diagonals
creates restlessness, and then the
i fairly fast cutting at this portion of
I the picture increases that illusion.
Melvyn Douglas is the man in the
i picture who falls in love with the
I mysterious lady he meets at a house
iof shady reputation that is only
hinted at. He and Herbert Marshall
give rather uninspired performanc
j es, with very little to work with,
but Edward Everett Horton de
; serves credit for his work as an
| operatic valet. He is, as always,
! superb.
Fair Picture
"Angel" is not, however, a second
| run feature because of its cast and
the lavish treatment it received. It
is fair to middlin' entertainment, and
iat any time Marlene Dietrich and
her legs — which are displayed in
this picture the first time in many
j a day, are good to pass away an
1 otherwise dull evening.
The second bill is the usual dull
1 tripe. This time it has Beverly Rob
erts and Patric Knowlcs, a newcom
er who isn't too good, in "Expensive
Husbands." It is a bit of nothing
, about a movie star who marries a
i prince in Vienna only she didn't
I know he was a prince. Nuts!

character should be introduced and
his usefulness to the plot made

clear. In other
words, the story
should get defi
nitely somewhere
in the first 10
minutes.
Sad but true,
this is not the
case with 'Angel.'
Lovely Marlene
Dietrich wanders
aimlessly through
lovely sets design
ed by lovely Mr.
A. E. Freudman
and come se-

j quence three and we still don't
know our heroine's name. This is
the fault of Director Ernest Lu
■ bitsch, who did all the mystery
| work for the purpose of creating
suspense. The trouble" is that the
1 suspense just doesn't come off, and
so until the plot gets someplace
there is an effect of static beauty
standing still waiting to jell.
Camera Work
Besides the star the camera work
should be given second place in the
beauty contest and the sets come
third. There are no trick shots, but
the one which most effectively cre
ates a maximum of mood is the
! close-up of La Dietrich with her
head tilted at a diagonal angle to
' the screen with a diagonal shadow
i running in the opposite plane in the
background. This use of diagonals
creates restlessness, and then the
i fairly fast cutting at this portion of
I the picture increases that illusion.
Melvyn Douglas is the man in the
i picture who falls in love with the
I mysterious lady he meets at a house
iof shady reputation that is only
hinted at. He and Herbert Marshall
give rather uninspired performanc
j es, with very little to work with,
but Edward Everett Horton de
; serves credit for his work as an
| operatic valet. He is, as always,
! superb.
Fair Picture
"Angel" is not, however, a second
| run feature because of its cast and
the lavish treatment it received. It
is fair to middlin' entertainment, and
iat any time Marlene Dietrich and
her legs — which are displayed in
this picture the first time in many
j a day, are good to pass away an
1 otherwise dull evening.
The second bill is the usual dull
1 tripe. This time it has Beverly Rob
erts and Patric Knowlcs, a newcom
er who isn't too good, in "Expensive
Husbands." It is a bit of nothing
, about a movie star who marries a
i prince in Vienna only she didn't
I know he was a prince. Nuts!
