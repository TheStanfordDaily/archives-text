# Photo Contest Closes Today
## Sig Delts Will Display Entries in Nitery 
### 
Sigma Delta Chi's First Annual
Competition in Photography, the
first attempt to discover and reward
Stanford's photographic best, closes
this afternoon at 5:30 o'clock.
All entries, according to contest
officials, must be submitted to either
the journalism secretary in the
Press Building, or to David Kee
ble's in Palo Alto. An entry blank
must accompany each print.
Until Sigma Delta Chi, profes
sional journalistic fraternity, an
nounced this as the first of yearly
competitions, Stanford had no means
of seeing what its photographers
could do. Next week, when all the
entries are hung in the Nitery, the
campus can decide for itself what is
or isn't good about Farm photogra
phy, it was pointed out.

into three divisions—pictorial, news
and action, and stories-in-pictures—
