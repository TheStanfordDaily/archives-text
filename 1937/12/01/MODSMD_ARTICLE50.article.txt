The Editor, Sir:
I was over to Encina the other day
visiting a friend who is a sponsor
there. While there, I heard some
conversations of the frosh and was
rather surprised to note the evident
elements of discord, unrest, and con
fusion. The basis of unhappiness
seemed to center around money
spent for amusement. Evidently, ac
cording to sentiments expressed, to
have a good time requires at least
ten dollars.
1 wonder if, in the complexity of
our present society, with its multi
plicity of widely differing social
functions, their sense of values has
not become confused. I realize that
it is difficult to place a reasonable
value on our amusements, but a sen
sible medium can be found.
When these fellows leave Encina,
it will not be the expensive times
they will remember as the happiest
ones. More likely it will be the
simpler amusements they will cher
ish most. They will look back on the
time when, in the company of two
or three congenial companions, they
played a good game for an evening
or experienced some funny incident
in an old Model T Ford. These are
merely examples of enjoyment
based on simplicity—the true basis
of any lasting happiness.
Those chaps who sit around grous
ing because they happen to lack the
ten or fifteen dollars necessary for a
night in the city are missing some of
the pleasantest experiences encoun
tered in Encina. Understand that
my contention is not based on the
idea that one should not enjoy a ten
or fifteen dollar affair occasionally.
Certainly they are a definite part in
one's education in the development
of a well-balanced, socially adapted
individual. The proposition I am at
tempting to establish is this: one
should not allow himself to become
confused by the complexity of our
society of today. By keeping the
principle of simplicity in mind, he
will be able to maintain a much
healthier standard of values.

The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the course
Personal Problems in Modern So
ciety should have a quota of more
than fifty students. Tuesday I had
classes most of the morning, and
though I tried to sign up for the
course as soon as possible, I found
that the class was already filled.
Surely, if this course is being given
as a result of a year's agitation by
students, it is equally as important
as other larger classes in the Uni
versity. Those who are graduating
this year, who cannot enter the class,
are being deprived of what appears
to be an interesting and valuable
course. Can something be done
coursc. Can something be done
about this?

Dear Mr. Bell:
We defy you to send us the elec
trical or mechanical wizard, be he
Edison's grandson or Steinmetz's
ghost, who can put through a tele
phone call from an Encina booth !
without being pressed to the extrem
ity of using some very unpleasant
phraseology about your company
and the poor, innocent operator. We
defy him to speak more than two I
words to his party more quickly

than any man with two legs can
reach the same person by roller
skate. And we defy you or any
member of the Bell Company's
hierarchy to get out of Encina alive
if ever "the boys" get wind of his
presence!
Faithfully yours,

It seems to me that the course
Personal Problems in Modern So
ciety should have a quota of more
than fifty students. Tuesday I had
classes most of the morning, and
though I tried to sign up for the
course as soon as possible, I found
that the class was already filled.
Surely, if this course is being given
as a result of a year's agitation by
students, it is equally as important
as other larger classes in the Uni
versity. Those who are graduating
this year, who cannot enter the class,
are being deprived of what appears
to be an interesting and valuable
course. Can something be done
coursc. Can something be done
about this?

Company:
President of the Bell Telephone Co. j
Dear Mr. Bell:
We defy you to send us the elec
trical or mechanical wizard, be he
Edison's grandson or Steinmetz's
ghost, who can put through a tele
phone call from an Encina booth !
without being pressed to the extrem
ity of using some very unpleasant
phraseology about your company
and the poor, innocent operator. We
defy him to speak more than two I
words to his party more quickly

than any man with two legs can
reach the same person by roller
skate. And we defy you or any
member of the Bell Company's
hierarchy to get out of Encina alive
if ever "the boys" get wind of his
presence!
Faithfully yours,
Sherman Mellinkoff

The Editor, Sir:
I was over to Encina the other day
visiting a friend who is a sponsor
there. While there, I heard some
conversations of the frosh and was
rather surprised to note the evident
elements of discord, unrest, and con
fusion. The basis of unhappiness
seemed to center around money
spent for amusement. Evidently, ac
cording to sentiments expressed, to
have a good time requires at least
ten dollars.
1 wonder if, in the complexity of
our present society, with its multi
plicity of widely differing social
functions, their sense of values has
not become confused. I realize that
it is difficult to place a reasonable
value on our amusements, but a sen
sible medium can be found.
When these fellows leave Encina,
it will not be the expensive times
they will remember as the happiest
ones. More likely it will be the
simpler amusements they will cher
ish most. They will look back on the
time when, in the company of two
or three congenial companions, they
played a good game for an evening
or experienced some funny incident
in an old Model T Ford. These are
merely examples of enjoyment
based on simplicity—the true basis
of any lasting happiness.
Those chaps who sit around grous
ing because they happen to lack the
ten or fifteen dollars necessary for a
night in the city are missing some of
the pleasantest experiences encoun
tered in Encina. Understand that
my contention is not based on the
