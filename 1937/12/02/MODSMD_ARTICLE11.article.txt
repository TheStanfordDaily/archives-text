"Discover and exploit your own
powers while in college," Dr. Har

head of the School of Letters, told
sandwich - eating Luncheon Club
bers yesterday noon. "Otherwise
college is just an asylum to keep
young people off the streets."
Dr. Craig defended a broad, cul
tural education against specialized,
strictly vocational education. "The
mind of the post-adolescent must be
kept healthy and open to new ideas,"
he said. "Specialization too early
warps young people's minds and pre
vents discovery of deep-seated, hid
den talents."
