## 
### BILL MILLIS 
After a trial period of opening the Library reserve room for three
Sunday niglits. Library Director Nathan Van Patten declared yesterday
afternoon that lie is not yet ready to recommend the adoption of a policy
for permanent Sunday night Library hours, and that lie would not pre
dict whether or not the experimental period will be continued next

According to a tabulation made
by library offiicals, the total number
of students using the reserve room
books on the three Sunday nights
that it has been open were: Novem
ber 7, 100; November 14, 190; and
November 21, 95. No count was
made of the number of students who
j used the reserve room for studying,
| but did not take out books.
While this use of the Library was
j "just about what we anticipated,"
j Mr. Van Patten emphasized that "we
| don't have sufficient data as yet to
j draw any conclusions."
Financial grants from reserve
i funds in the University budget al
| low for opening the reserve room
! Sunday nights for this quarter only,
j he said.
An extension of the "trial period"
through next quarter will depend
i upon what decision Dr. Wilbur
j reaches on its success so far, and
I whether he will grant funds for its
j continuance, Van Patten said. The
director plans to present a report
j on its operations to the University
I president following the end of this
I quarter.
