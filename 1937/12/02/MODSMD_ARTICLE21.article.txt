# Farm Row Set-up Tops, Says Moulton
## Interfraternity Meeting Cites Stanford Board Of Control as Leader 
### 
Stanford may boast one of the fin
est and most effective Interfrater
nity set-ups in American universi
ties, according to Don Moulton and
Bud Milligan, Interfraternity Coun
cil executives, who returned yester
day from attending the National
Interfraternity Convention held in
New York City November 25 and 2(5.
More than 200 undergraduates and
alumni representing 80 colleges at
tended the conference, reported
Stanford's representatives. The
question put before the group for
discussion this year was "How to
strengthen loeal councils and make
them more effective."
Moulton was one of the chief
speakers at the convention, explain
ing the Interfraternity Board of
Control to the assembly, since this
feature of interfraternity administra
tion is unique to Stanford. Nearly
all college groups have student fra
ternity councils but none have an
alumni represented Board of Con
trol, an organization which helps to
avoid the conflict between Row and
administrative officials, which is so
common in other colleges.
In addition Stanford's Co-op
came in for some very favorable
discussion and examination since it
is one of the very few successful
systems in the country. Oregon
State College has a similar set-up
and is also ranked very high.
Stanford is looked upon as an ex
ample of progressive fraternity
practice, report Moulton and Mil
ligan. Regarding the deferred rush
ing plan, scholastic requirements to
live in a house, and general inter
fraternity effectiveness, Stanford is
studied by many universities who
may copy the plan.
