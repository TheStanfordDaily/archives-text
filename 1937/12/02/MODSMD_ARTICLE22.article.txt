# Encina Informal To Feature Hulas
## 
### 
Stanford couldn't sail over to Ha
waii and play football so Hawaii is
coming to Stanford to play. It won't
be football this time but something
just as thrilling to watch, when grass
skirted hula girls swing and sway
for the Encina Informal tomorrow
night.
Three women and two men, all
Stanford students born in Hawaii,
will dance several hulas during the
intermissions. George Doriss and his
Hawaiian orchestra from San Fran
cisco will furnish the melodies for
the hulas.
Arrangements for the native danc
ing were made through the co-op
eration of Bill Ward, president of
the Hawaiian Club at Stanford.
Regular dancing will be to the
music of Warren Ringen and his
eight-piece orchestra.
Bids for the dance are now on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office at SI .50
per couple. Hall men are welcome
to come and stags will be permitted
to attend.
