# Schafer Speakers' Post
## Bob Maiden Named New Bureau Manager 
### 
Chuck Schafer, energetic founder
and manager of the Speakers' Bu
reau, announced yesterday that he
will resign from the position which
he has held since the birth of his
organization at the end of this
quarter.
Guiding the bureau through its
third year of work will be Robert
Maiden, junior transfer who was
formerly president of the Long
Beach Junior College Speakers' Bu
reau, who will take over at the be
ginning of next quarter.
Maiden is at present assistant
manager to Schafer and also a
speaker for the bureau. His talk on
frog farming, 'The Saga of the
Leaping Leviathan," has been one of
the most requested speeches, ac
cording to Schafer. Last week he
was held over by the Palo Alto
Lions Club for further information.
The bureau was approved by Ex
Committee in November, 1935. This
: quarter has been the busiest in its
history. Also it is the first quarter
j in which the bureau has publicized
j debate topics and offered debaters
| to service clubs and groups on the
peninsula.
A new program listing speakers
for the bureau will be published
next January, to start the new re
gime afresh. Those interested in
speaking for it should see either
Schafer or Maiden in the bureau's
office, Old Union.
