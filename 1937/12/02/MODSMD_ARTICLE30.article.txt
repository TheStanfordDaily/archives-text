# 'Trojan Women', Anti- War Drama, Opens Tonight
## Play Runs Tomorrow, Saturday Nights; Janet Dole in Leading Role 
### 
"The Troian Women," which opens tonight at 8 o'clock in the I/i 11le
Theater, is the most powerful anti-war play ever written, according to
Thomas Wood Stevens, acting director of the Department of Speech
and Drama.
The Stanford production is particularly timely because of it.s com-

â–ºageous comment on tnc subject ox
aggressive war. The Greek tragedy
was written by Euripides as a pro
test against the action of the Athe
nian state in invading the island of
Melos and dispossessing its inhab
itants.
Human Values Stressed
Mr. Stevens' presentation of "The
| Trojan Women," which will be re
j peated tomorrow and Saturday
nights, stresses the human values of
the classic drama. This interpre
tation is better suited to the modern
stage than a more stately or archaeo
logical production.
The Little Theater was selected as
the setting for the play because it
provides an unexcelled background
for its modern psychology. The sor
rows of the chief character Hecuba
and her daughters can be voiced
most effectively in this intimate set
ting.
