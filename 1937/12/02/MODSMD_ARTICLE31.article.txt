# Women Journalists To Sell Doughnuts
## 
### 
The first of a series of doughnut
sales, sponsored by Theta Sigma Phi,
national women's honorary journal
ism fraternity, will be held on Quad
next Monday morning, December (?.
Fresh doughnuts, plain, powdered,
and sugared will be peddled at 5
cents apiece by members of the soci
ety all morning.
Vendors expect to get under way
at their stations at the post office
and the Enginering and English cor
ners before 8 o'clock so that those
making a breakfastless dash for
their classes can grab one on the
way. Barbara Rosenblatt is in charge
of sales.
