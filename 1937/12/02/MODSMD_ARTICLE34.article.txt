# Paly Garagemen End Union Pact
## 
### 
Twelve Palo Alto garage operators
â– yesterday terminated an agreement
with Auto Mechanics' Union No.
1414, affiliated with the A. F. of L.
International Brotherhood of Team
sters, and at the same time an
nounced that they were willing to
negotiate a new agreement which
would lengthen the minimum work
ing week.
Failure of the union to sign up
other operators in the vicinity, which
wa.s one of the provisions of the
agreement, was the reason given by
(he employers for their action.

Newsreels of important campus
activities are taken by the cine
