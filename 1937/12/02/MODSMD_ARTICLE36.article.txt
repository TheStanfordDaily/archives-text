# Surgeon To Give Officer New Eye
## 
### 
DETROIT, Dec. 1 (UP).—The city
of Detroit planned today to gamble
$1200 on the chance that Policeman
John V. Hogan could regain his
sight through the surgical • trans
plantation of a cornea removed from
the eye of a stillborn infant.
Hogan will be sent to the Pres
byterian Hospital in New York City
early in February for an operation
by Dr. Ramon Castroveijo. He will
have to wait until a stillborn infant
just freed from its mother, is avail
able to the surgeon.
