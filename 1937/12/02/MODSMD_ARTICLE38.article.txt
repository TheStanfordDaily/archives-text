# Students Get Trip In Streamliner Cab
## 
### PAT McGUIRK 
"Honestly, we coasted at 95 miles !
per hour! The engineer just shut
off the throttle, and that was the
speed we were going."
That was the thing that impressed
Bud Milligan, Sigma Nu, and Don
Moulton, Zete, most when they were
allowed to ride in the cab of "The
City of San Francisco," streamlined
train traveling from Chicago to San
Francisco, last 'Monday.
Moulton and Milligan, who were
returning from New York, where
they were the tSanford representa
tives to a national meeting of in
terfraternity councils, decided that
it would be a fine experience if
they could* ride in the cab of the
train.
Wired for Permission
Upon being told by the conductor
that there wasn't anyone aboard the
train with sufficient authority to
give them permission to ride in the
cab, they telegraphed the division
superintendent of the road. They
explained that they were Stanford
students, and that they would like
to make a report of the trip.
They and a vice-president of
Standard Oil Company were the
first three passengers that had been
allowed to ride in the cab for over a
month. And they found that the
railroad absolutely barred all
women.
Moulton rode from Evanston to
Ogden, Utah, while the train trav
eled through the winding Weaver
Canyon. "We only coasted at 60
while we were going through
there," commented Moulton.
Milligan rode over 120 miles in

the cab. The top speed of the train
while he was in the cab was 97 miles
per hour.
"One thing we couldn't help no
ticing," remarked Moulton, "was
the engineer and his surroundings.
Instead of the usual greasy appear
ing engineer, the one we had wore
a neat business suit, and only stayed
on the shift for a x little over two
hours."
Comfortable Cab
According to Moulton, the engi
neer had a comfortably upholstered
seat, a telephone system connected
with each car in the train, air con
ditioning in the cab, steam heat, and
big windshield wipers for the cab
windows.
"Another thing," said Milligan,
"was the safety device they had.
The engineer has a big pedal on
which he must keep his foot. If he
should faint, or take his foot off the
pedal, the train would automatically
stop.'
Sec Scenery
The engineer showed them differ
ent interesting points of scenery as
they traveled, and the , average
sped of 80 miles per hour didn't
seem to faze him much. However,
it seemed to them that as they sped
down the road the engine literally
ate up the track.
"It was the smoothest ride we
have ever had. They did everything
to make us comfortable. A big ra
dio, soft seats, no clicks to be heard,
springy matresses, and," Moulton
and Milligan emphasized this, "they
even had a separate ladder for each
upper berth."

The engineer showed them differ
ent interesting points of scenery as
they traveled, and the , average
sped of 80 miles per hour didn't
seem to faze him much. However,
it seemed to them that as they sped
down the road the engine literally
ate up the track.
"It was the smoothest ride we
have ever had. They did everything
to make us comfortable. A big ra
dio, soft seats, no clicks to be heard,
springy matresses, and," Moulton
and Milligan emphasized this, "they
even had a separate ladder for each
upper berth."
"Honestly, we coasted at 95 miles !
per hour! The engineer just shut
off the throttle, and that was the
speed we were going."
That was the thing that impressed
Bud Milligan, Sigma Nu, and Don
Moulton, Zete, most when they were
allowed to ride in the cab of "The
City of San Francisco," streamlined
train traveling from Chicago to San
Francisco, last 'Monday.
Moulton and Milligan, who were
returning from New York, where
they were the tSanford representa
tives to a national meeting of in
terfraternity councils, decided that
it would be a fine experience if
they could* ride in the cab of the
train.
Wired for Permission
Upon being told by the conductor
that there wasn't anyone aboard the
train with sufficient authority to
give them permission to ride in the
cab, they telegraphed the division
superintendent of the road. They
explained that they were Stanford
students, and that they would like
to make a report of the trip.
They and a vice-president of
Standard Oil Company were the
first three passengers that had been
allowed to ride in the cab for over a
month. And they found that the
railroad absolutely barred all
women.
Moulton rode from Evanston to
Ogden, Utah, while the train trav
eled through the winding Weaver
Canyon. "We only coasted at 60
while we were going through
there," commented Moulton.
Milligan rode over 120 miles in

the cab. The top speed of the train
while he was in the cab was 97 miles
per hour.
"One thing we couldn't help no
ticing," remarked Moulton, "was
the engineer and his surroundings.
Instead of the usual greasy appear
ing engineer, the one we had wore
a neat business suit, and only stayed
on the shift for a x little over two
hours."
Comfortable Cab
According to Moulton, the engi
neer had a comfortably upholstered
seat, a telephone system connected
with each car in the train, air con
ditioning in the cab, steam heat, and
big windshield wipers for the cab
windows.
"Another thing," said Milligan,
"was the safety device they had.
The engineer has a big pedal on
which he must keep his foot. If he
should faint, or take his foot off the
pedal, the train would automatically
stop.'
