# Cards To Lose Nine Gridders By Graduation
## Next Year's Line-up To Be Same as '37 With Few Exceptions 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
When the 1938 Stanford football
season rolls around, this year's start
ing lineups will be intact with few
exceptions.
Diplomas will take a toll of nine
veterans from the 1937 varsity squad.
As many promising players will
move up from Greys and freshman
squads.
Grant Stone's graduation will
leave the greatest deficit in the var
sity accounts. Team captain through
the last conference season, Stone
called signals from the right end
post. He gained all-Coast honors in
that position.
Clark Returns
The end problem, however, will
not be too hard to solve. Jack Clark,
injured before this season opened,
will probably be back on the field,
and Neil Rasmussen is still eligible
for competition. Bill Willard, enter
ing his junior year, has a good
chance of remaining in a regular
post, and McElroy and Stojkovich
I have both shown promise.
Although Peter Fay has already
j moved into a first string halfback
I post, Jimmy Coffis will leave a great
i vacancy in the squad. Besides three
years of excellent work as safety
| man, Jimmy has proved himself a
spark plug of spirit in the Big Red
j Machine.
Veterans Back
Doc Luckett, Jake Brigham, and
i Joe Vigna, none of whom closed the
'season on the first string, have seen
J plenty of service, and will be greatly
l missed on the 1938 squad.
Luckett, an excellent place-kicker,
j saved the day with the winning point
I over Southern California a month
I ago, and Brigham has boosted Stan
ford scores several times by his
[ southpaw passes. Vigna saw first
string service at right half last year.
Guard Vacancies
Biggest vacancy in the line will
| again be in the guard positions. Leo
Ferko, Jack Walton, and Bobby
Matthews will all graduate, leaving
the spots to be held by Bob Dakan,
at present on the first string, and
whoever Coach Tiny Thornhill can
recruit for the other side.
Louie Tsoutsouvas has done some
fine worl£ at center during his three
years of varsity competition, but the
position will be amply handled by
Tony Calvelli.
There will still be plenty of re
serve material at Stanford and a lot
can be expected from the Greys and
the new sophomores.

I ago, and Brigham has boosted Stan
ford scores several times by his
[ southpaw passes. Vigna saw first
string service at right half last year.
Guard Vacancies
Biggest vacancy in the line will
| again be in the guard positions. Leo
Ferko, Jack Walton, and Bobby
Matthews will all graduate, leaving
the spots to be held by Bob Dakan,
at present on the first string, and
whoever Coach Tiny Thornhill can
recruit for the other side.
Louie Tsoutsouvas has done some
fine worl£ at center during his three
years of varsity competition, but the
position will be amply handled by
Tony Calvelli.
There will still be plenty of re
serve material at Stanford and a lot
can be expected from the Greys and
the new sophomores.
When the 1938 Stanford football
season rolls around, this year's start
ing lineups will be intact with few
exceptions.
Diplomas will take a toll of nine
veterans from the 1937 varsity squad.
As many promising players will
move up from Greys and freshman
squads.
Grant Stone's graduation will
leave the greatest deficit in the var
sity accounts. Team captain through
the last conference season, Stone
called signals from the right end
post. He gained all-Coast honors in
that position.
Clark Returns
The end problem, however, will
not be too hard to solve. Jack Clark,
injured before this season opened,
will probably be back on the field,
and Neil Rasmussen is still eligible
for competition. Bill Willard, enter
ing his junior year, has a good
chance of remaining in a regular
post, and McElroy and Stojkovich
I have both shown promise.
Although Peter Fay has already
j moved into a first string halfback
I post, Jimmy Coffis will leave a great
i vacancy in the squad. Besides three
years of excellent work as safety
| man, Jimmy has proved himself a
spark plug of spirit in the Big Red
j Machine.
Veterans Back
Doc Luckett, Jake Brigham, and
i Joe Vigna, none of whom closed the
'season on the first string, have seen
J plenty of service, and will be greatly
l missed on the 1938 squad.
Luckett, an excellent place-kicker,
j saved the day with the winning point
I over Southern California a month
I ago, and Brigham has boosted Stan
ford scores several times by his
[ southpaw passes. Vigna saw first
string service at right half last year.
