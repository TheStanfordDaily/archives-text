HUSKIES TRANSFORMED
INTO HOWLING WOLVES
They may call themselves the
Huskies up at the University of
Washington, but Seattle is full of
howling wolves right now.
One of the lowest and most de
plorable situations existing in col
lege football today is the action taken
by alumni in various schools the
minute their team starts losing a
few football games.
When a team starts losing there is
oftentimes a pack of alumni waiting
around in the role of wolves to do a
little nipping at the coach's heels.
This action by alumni is bad
enough but when a city newspaper
digs around and starts things going
and then takes up the bludgeon to
lead the howling against the coach,
this is carrying things a little too
far.
TIMES SAYS TWO THINGS
WRONG AT WASHINGTON
Recently the Seattle Times came
out with a blazing editorial de
nouncing the football situation at
Washington and asking for the dis
missal of Head Coach Jimmy Phe
lan. It seems that the Times' main
gripe is that a good deal of the Hus
kies' football talent comes from Chi
cago and way points, and that the
home town boys don't get a break.
We'll quote the opening paragraph
of that October 31 editorial in the
Times: "There are two things very
wrong with the University of Wash
ington football team—the system and
the coach. Both Seattle and the
State of Washington are inordinately
proud of the University of Wash
ington crew. It doesn't seem neces
sary to hire oarsmen from Chicago
to make it a success. The crew also
has a graduate coach."

Needless to say, this edit brought
a storm of indignant missives to the
Times office, so the Seattle paper
followed it up a week later with
an article by Carl E. Brazier, man
aging editor, which covered nearly
a half page.
Here are a few quotes from this
masterpiece: "Last year Washing
ton's team won its way through the
Pacific Conference football race —
won its way despite the policy of
keeping hometown boys on the
sidelines; won its way despite a
coaching policy that placed the
scoreboard count above everything."
"When it comes to spending
money to bring Chicago boys here
and keep them here, unfair compe
tition with Washington's young man
hood has been developed."
The Times really doesn't have any
thing against Phelan except they
figure that he is part of the system
that is so unfair to the home-spun
product.
The howling of the wolves is an
old, old stunt that will go on as long
as college football exists but this is
a comparatively rare action in hav
ing the press instigating and leading
the pack.

Here are a few quotes from this
masterpiece: "Last year Washing
ton's team won its way through the
Pacific Conference football race —
won its way despite the policy of
keeping hometown boys on the
sidelines; won its way despite a
coaching policy that placed the
scoreboard count above everything."
"When it comes to spending
money to bring Chicago boys here
and keep them here, unfair compe
tition with Washington's young man
hood has been developed."
The Times really doesn't have any
thing against Phelan except they
figure that he is part of the system
that is so unfair to the home-spun
product.
The howling of the wolves is an
old, old stunt that will go on as long
as college football exists but this is
a comparatively rare action in hav
ing the press instigating and leading
the pack.

HUSKIES TRANSFORMED
INTO HOWLING WOLVES
They may call themselves the
Huskies up at the University of
Washington, but Seattle is full of
howling wolves right now.
One of the lowest and most de
plorable situations existing in col
lege football today is the action taken
by alumni in various schools the
minute their team starts losing a
few football games.
When a team starts losing there is
oftentimes a pack of alumni waiting
around in the role of wolves to do a
little nipping at the coach's heels.
This action by alumni is bad
enough but when a city newspaper
digs around and starts things going
and then takes up the bludgeon to
lead the howling against the coach,
this is carrying things a little too
far.
TIMES SAYS TWO THINGS
WRONG AT WASHINGTON
Recently the Seattle Times came
out with a blazing editorial de
nouncing the football situation at
Washington and asking for the dis
missal of Head Coach Jimmy Phe
lan. It seems that the Times' main
gripe is that a good deal of the Hus
kies' football talent comes from Chi
cago and way points, and that the
home town boys don't get a break.
We'll quote the opening paragraph
of that October 31 editorial in the
Times: "There are two things very
wrong with the University of Wash
ington football team—the system and
the coach. Both Seattle and the
State of Washington are inordinately
proud of the University of Wash
ington crew. It doesn't seem neces
sary to hire oarsmen from Chicago
to make it a success. The crew also
has a graduate coach."

Needless to say, this edit brought
a storm of indignant missives to the

followed it up a week later with
an article by Carl E. Brazier, man
