# Card Soccermen Win Rough Tilt
## Indians Beat San Mateans By 2-0 Tally Second Half Recovery Saves Day for Farm In Soccer Thriller 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
suddenly came to life in the second
half of its game with San Mateo
Junior College yesterday afternoon
on the Farm field, and handed the
Bulldogs a 2-0 defeat in the sea
son's roughest contest, which was
slowed up all afternoon by penalties
and foul shots.
After a scoreless, evenly matched
first half in which the ball trav
eled up and down the field with
neither team having any advantage,
the Indians showed a complete re
versal of form, and started pene
trating the Bulldog territory.
Midway in the third period Tevfik
Sadullah, Cardinal inside right,
tried a free kick from the San Ma
ted 20-yard line. The Bulldog goalie
blocked his attempted conversion,
bat Karl Schaupp, Card center for
ward, took the loose ball on the re
bound and pierced the net with
what turned out to be the winning
goal.
Stanford kept hammering away at
San Mateo pay dirt for the rest of
the period and during the entire
last quarter, getting only one more
score in return for its efforts, but
keeping the ball away from the des
perate Bulldogs, who were trying
to tie the count.
In the closing minutes of play, Ed
Gudewill, Cardinal inside left,
with the entire Bulldog team in
Stanford territory trying to knot the
score, broke away with the ball and
rifled it from 30 yards out to
put the game on ice for the Indians.
