# Ralphs Looms As Tennis Material
## 
### 
Walter Ralphs showed himself as
potential varsity tennis material
yesterday when he scored a 2-6,
6-2, 6-4 victory over Myron Folsom
and jumped from the 12 spot to the
number 6 notch on the Senior
ladder.
With rain keeping players inactive
a good many days during the past
week, few matches have been run
off on either the senior or the frosh
lists. Captain Bob Underwood held
onto his place behind top-man Bob
Braly by downing Lloyd Gates, 6-4,
6-8, 6-3 in a challenge match Tues
day.
Only two major changes have
been posted on the frosh list during
the past two weeks of play In these
Stan Owen defeated Bob Worth
ington and took over the number 5
position, and Ed Detrich came up
from nowhere to the 8 spot with an
overwhelming triumph over Gary
Ellis.
