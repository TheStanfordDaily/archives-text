### AQUARIUM DROFNATS 
The Dippy's sea-going sports writers gasped and sputtered their way
to a sensational 12-4 victory in the season's outstanding water polo game
against the water-logged aquatic managers.
The issue was never in doubt with Dippy hoys John "Seal Bait" Shal
lenberger and Gene "Neutral" Gear carrying high the offensive torch.

Whenever the managers got close 1
for a shot at the Dippy goal there
was , Walt "Rockbound" Peterson,
attired in a life saver around each
leg, to bat down their efforts in
heroic style.
High scorer for the afternoon was
"Seal Bait" Shallenberger, who
peppe'red away at the defenseless
managers for nine goals. "Neutral"
Gear controlled the sprint through
out and scored the remaining three
goals. Frank "Ringer" Hooper, who
never managed anything irk his life,
scored two for the managers in the
first half and was relieved by Dick
"Our x Star" Palmer, who whizzed in
the remaining two points for the
Encina Pool boys in the second half.
Half time score wsfk 5-2.
" Three Referees
The ordeal was too much for one
referee so three of the whistle toot
ers saw duty—Johnny Lamb started
and was relieved by Dave Rider,
who in turn gave way to Harvey
Rothschild. The first half took ap
proximately 10 minutes to play but
the watches stopped after that and
the second half lasted for 35 min
utes.
Phil "Water Wings" Klauber
played a gallant game at guard for
the sports scriveners and was car
ried from the pool after the final
whistle in a sadly demented state.
Harry "Octo" Press, "Water
Wings'" sinking mate at the other
guard position, did more playing on
the bottom than on the surface dur
ing the first half, but a life preserver
bolstered him up to Ail-American
consideration in the second half.
Teams Swear Off
John "Bottom of the Pool" Hede
lund lived up to his name, although
between submersions he stopped a
few shots at the goal for the man
agers. Jack "Thank God for My
Fat" Ellis, of the managers, amazed
the trio of rooters with his out
standing breakaway play. He fooled
everybody, including the ref and
himself.
Perry "Dry Land" Chisum rolled
through the water in true porpoise
style for the managers and was al
ways a threat—to both teams.
Chuck "Oh What a Ham" Berger
and Sam "Water-Logged" Wooling
ton gave their all for the managers
before being carried from the tank.
Both teams, to a man, promise
never to go near the water again—
water wings or no water wings.
Most of the players can be reached
today at the Rest Home.
