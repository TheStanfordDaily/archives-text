## Feature Comment Moaning After the Nitery Before 
### 
EX COMMITTEE might as well call a spade
a spade and a Nitery by its right name, and
come down to the awful truth that it has become
heir to one of the whitest elephants ever to
crash underbrush in and around the Stanford
Farm.
Last year the ecstatic dream of Ex Commit
tee—definitely not the same in personnel as
the one mentioned above—coupled with edi
torial proddings from this champion of many
an idea, brought on the campaign for a campus
night spot; a glamorous, soft-lighted little nest
where everyone could gather, dance, carry on
sparkling bits of repartee, and make itself think
it had some of the brilliance of the City right
here between the haystacks. It seemed quite
possible and still is.
But somewhere along the line there was a
herring thrown across the trail and the Nitery
path led off into a swamp of financial and argu
mentative mire that greatly affected the end
product.
What came out of the deal, instead of a glam
orous little lakeside gathering place, was what
we now inappropriately call the Nitery; in real

ity a lounge and nothing more. All this is very,
very sad but true, though no fault of the pres
ent Executive Committee.
However, there has been an attempt to turn
the lounge into the night spot it was intended
to be by putting in refreshment facilities dupli
cating those in the Cellar. Ex Committee must
realize that this is nothing more than a feeble
attempt to turn the so-called Nitery into a sub
sidiary Cellar—for which there is no felt need.
The Nitery is a lounge and is being used as
a lounge. The Daily feels that it will probably
always be a lounge. An occasional jolly-up,
movies of football, rather extensive use during
summer quarter, and a meeting spot for com
mittees are approximately its potential uses. A1
Hyman and committee can popularize it some
what by arranging such jolly-ups and other
interest-gathering events.
But Stanford may as well admit that it still
has no Nitery, that its present one is not what
was sought when the drive for a campus night
spot started, that it must make the best of an
obvious error in judgment.
Stanford should call its spade just that —and
its white elephant a lounge.
