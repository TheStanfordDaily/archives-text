THE DAILY'S leather medals tor achievement
go to these:

Stanford's varsity Red Cross team has closed
its seabon untied and undefeated with a neat
$1,000. Last year's record of $850 is left sobbing
with shame. Headed by Jan North, who was
assisted by Beth Allen, Hap Dey, and Roy
Thompson, the job was done quickly and well.

Two years ago a blond lad from L.A.J.C.
drifted into Stanford with an idea he'd picked
up down south. There should be a Stanford
speakers' bureau, an agency to provide cam
pus speakers for off-campus organizations that
wished to apply.
Chuck Schafer organized his bureau, became
its manager, built it to an efficient, well-estab
lished fixture in the Stanford scene. Yesterday
he turned over the managership to a new man,
concluded his two years of unsung service.

I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look
at it for hours. —Jerome K. Jerome
