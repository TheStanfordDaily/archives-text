CAMARADERIE
IV'E hear a lot these days about the rotten time pos
terity is going to have as a result of our stupid
ity. We are told that our descendants even unto the
third and fourth generation will have to pay and pay
and pay to fund the debt our WPA boys are running
up. We learn with dismay that our sons and daugh
ters will have to clean up the mess from the next
war, and try to collect enough of us, their fathers, to
rate a Christian burial. Our hearts bleed when we
think of. our children living off of twigs and roots
because we are wasting the natural resources. Truly,
the lot of the next generation is a sad one, and I shall
not feel hurt if sensitive readers pause here for two
minutes meditation with heads bowed.
But posterity will have one blessing that should do
a great deal to compensate for funding arrangements,
and jig-saw puzzle jobs on fathers. Posterity will have
all this glorious art without realizing what travail and
none of the agonies that are now making cemetery
lots the best real estate investment. Posterity will
have pictures to delight the soul. It will have shots
of glasses on platters, scotties on doormats, co-eds on
diving boards. And it will inherit these without
charge, without having to pose and squirm and crawl
under tables.

By the time our grandchildren are trying to talk
Ihe tax collector out of the current installment of the
WPA debt, the camera mania will be a thing of past
ages. At the rate we are going now, all possible
pictures will be taken long before our sons start feel
ing sorry for their descendants. Posterity will inherit
all this glorious art wtihout realizing what travail and
heartbreak went into creating it.
In fact, relief from the oppression of the camera
craze is about as much of a blessing as any self
respecting posterity has a right to ask. There are
many in this generation who would trade it for the
WPA debt right now.

about two years now we have been in the
throes of the craze. Camera fiends, it seems, lose
all sense of balance the minute they get their hands
on a Leica, and for two years there has been no peace
for innocent bystanders. At dances there will be a
sudden flare of light which blinds you so that you
slam into the next couple. A week later you are
shown a picture of yourself with your mouth open
and one foot held up daintily like a hurt pup.
On dates there will be another burst of light, and
all sorts of embarrassment.
Camera fiends, moreover, lose all sense of humor.
I lived in harmony and concord with a roommate for
a year once. And then there were bitter words and
unpleasant references to ancestry, all because I had
the temerity to pick up my glasses when he was
talking them for a candid shot.

This state of affairs has progressed so far that we
innocent bystanders are as jumpy as a rabbit in the
open season. We dare not kick a rock, or sneeze, or
turn a corner suddenly. There is always a picture
snapper about. And if you don't step on him while
he's getting an angle shot, he will have a nice basis for
blackmail.
I think that I will have to get a camera so that the
next time somebody comes whining around about pos
terity I can take care of him. I will blow off a flash
bulb in his teeth, print up a picture that looks like an
introverted chipmunk, and pass this along to pos
terity. It should be n great comfort to our suffering
children.
