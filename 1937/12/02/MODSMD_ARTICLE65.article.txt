Tuesday The Daily Californian's second edit
column was written by a professor about profes
sors. Because of its obvious controversial nature
the "prominent and respected member of the fac
ulty" was granted the privilege of withholding his
name.—The Editor

As an old member of the faculty, I was much in
trigued by the communication of Dr. Franz Schneider
which appeared in a late issue of The Daily Cali
fornian. Dr. Schneider urged that we faculty mem
bers were remiss in not teaching our students an ap
preciation of higher ideals of conduct.
I could not help but wonder if Dr. Schneider re
alized that we are not paid to teach ideals, and that
we are not paid or promoted because we are "good
teachers." I challenge him to name a single member
of the faculty who has been promoted to an associate
or full professorship during the period 1920-1937
solely or primarily because he has been an excellent
teacher or because he has had a beneficial, elevating
influence on the student body.
When a faculty member is suggested for promotion
to the associate or full professorship, the first and de
ciding question is "What has he published?" We are
paid for pagination (research and publication). Why
should be worry about teaching ideals? Why should
we bother to give our students an appreciation of the
finer aspects of life? Why should we give time to our
students by discussing their problems with them? Such
things take time from our research.
The authorities who hold faculty promotions and
salary increases in the palms of their hands do not
care whether or not we teach ideals. Nor do the stu
dents care whether or not we teach ideals. We get
no appreciation or recognition for our efforts in that
direction from either party. So why teach ideals? Or
for that matter why even bother to be "good teachers"
in our various subjects?
