# Color Makes 'Vogues of '38' Solid Hit
## 
### 
"Vogues of 1938," now at the Fox-
Stanford—a world of publicity pre
ceeded Walter Wanger's Vogues and
the agents said it would be some
thing. They were right. Although
it is the most elaborate fashion
show ever filmed it is somehow tem
pered with a restraint that makes

for an illusion of
good taste.
It would have
been as easy to
take hundreds of
Hollywood beau
tifuls and dress
them alike, pai-ade
them in, each on
a revolving stage,
followed by Joan
Bennett, the piece
de resi st a n ce,

spotlighted in a separate creation.
Instead intelligent Mr. Wanger went
to New York and selected ten of
! the most experienced and most
photographed clothes horses and
brought them to Hollywood to model
; the gowns with Miss Bennett.
Men Stylewise Too
In order to make the men feel
just as stylish as the women in this
picture, Warner Baxter wears some
thing like 34 suits, 11 overcoats, 9
1 pairs of shoes, several lounging
robes and hats. All these garments
> are given a tactile sense of reality
by the new advanced technicolor.
. Whatever that is, let us hope it is
i
1 here to stay.
The most beautiful color photog
raphy yet screened is shown here
and if Joan Bennett isn't given a
new lease on stardom because of her
color photographability then Ghandi
never wore a sheet.
Plot Old StufT
There is nothing in the way of a
plot that you haven't seen before; it
is the old story of the two designers
who try to ruin each other and fi
nally come to a show-down at a big
(and I mean big) fashion show.
Mischa Auer as the eccentric Rus r
sian designer is tops and Alan Mow
bray as his boss turns in the best
bit of acting he has done so far.
So realistic is the color that it is

hard to concentrate on the flat
black and white picture which is a
companion feature. It is called
"Portia on Trial" but the photog
raphy suffers so in comparison to
the color work in "Vogues" that it
makes almost no impression.

the color work in "Vogues" that it
makes almost no impression.
—Curley


Thumbs Up
"Vogues of 1938," now at the Fox-
Stanford—a world of publicity pre
ceeded Walter Wanger's Vogues and
the agents said it would be some
thing. They were right. Although
it is the most elaborate fashion
show ever filmed it is somehow tem
pered with a restraint that makes

for an illusion of
good taste.
It would have
been as easy to
take hundreds of
Hollywood beau
tifuls and dress
them alike, pai-ade
them in, each on
a revolving stage,
followed by Joan
Bennett, the piece
de resi st a n ce,

spotlighted in a separate creation.
Instead intelligent Mr. Wanger went
to New York and selected ten of
! the most experienced and most
photographed clothes horses and
brought them to Hollywood to model
; the gowns with Miss Bennett.
Men Stylewise Too
In order to make the men feel
just as stylish as the women in this
picture, Warner Baxter wears some
thing like 34 suits, 11 overcoats, 9
1 pairs of shoes, several lounging
robes and hats. All these garments
> are given a tactile sense of reality
by the new advanced technicolor.
. Whatever that is, let us hope it is
i
1 here to stay.
The most beautiful color photog
raphy yet screened is shown here
and if Joan Bennett isn't given a
new lease on stardom because of her
color photographability then Ghandi
never wore a sheet.
Plot Old StufT
There is nothing in the way of a
plot that you haven't seen before; it
is the old story of the two designers
who try to ruin each other and fi
nally come to a show-down at a big
(and I mean big) fashion show.
Mischa Auer as the eccentric Rus r
sian designer is tops and Alan Mow
bray as his boss turns in the best
bit of acting he has done so far.
So realistic is the color that it is

hard to concentrate on the flat
black and white picture which is a
companion feature. It is called
"Portia on Trial" but the photog
raphy suffers so in comparison to
the color work in "Vogues" that it
makes almost no impression.
