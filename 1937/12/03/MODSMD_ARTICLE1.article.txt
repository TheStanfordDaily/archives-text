ing club member to change his affili
ation oil her directly or impliedly

dent of the club involved of that in
tention, according to the new agree
ment.

and ignorance of the Club-Row re
lationship.
Harry Cragin, president of the In

unless it has first notified the presi
dent of the club involved of that in
tention, according to the new agree
ment.
Neither may rushing cards be sent
to club members, and any which are
sent will be turned over to the In
tcrfratcrnity Council office so that
its officers may inform the fraternity
of the mistake.
A third point included in the
agreement provides that the pledging
of any club member may not be an
nounced until 30 days after the club
president has been notified.
This new plan does not apply to
freshmten until after formal pledge
day for the fraternities, and will go
into effect immediately.
Executive heads of both clubs and
fraternities voiced strong approval
of the plan. Speaking for the Inter
fraternity Council. President Don
Moulton said:
"We are heartily in favor of the
movement, believing that it satisfies
a need felt at Stanford for many
years, and we sincerely hope it suc
ceeds."
The move was instigated by the
Axe Society, co-ordinating unit of
Hall and Row, with the idea in mind
of establishing a gentlemen's agree
ment to prevent the repetition of
unfortunate and unnecessary embar
rassing incidents which have hap
pened in the past through confusion
and ignorance of the Club-Row re
lationship.
Harry Cragin, president of the In
terclub Council, also voiced hearty
approval of the plan, saying:
"I am sure that it will bring Hall
and Row closer together through
clarification of a relationship which
has sometimes caused unnecessary
misunderstanding."
