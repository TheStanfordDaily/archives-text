# Writer Calls Sonja Henie 'Good Skate'
## Actress Finds Skating For Camera Harder Than for Competition

She's a good skate.
We all agreed on that at Lake
Placid, five years ago, when she was
defending her Olympic champion
ship. In the evening, when the flags
of the nations had been lowered and
the cold winds came down from the
mountains, she used to drop in on
what we newspapermen called the
Cellar A. C. and sip at her beer as
daintily as she had whirled about
the ice on her silver blades.
She was mighty pretty then, too,
and the boys paid'her great compli
ment of stopping their play at the
slot machines just to sit and look
at her, and listen to her giggly little
laugh and appealing Norwegian ac
cent. Even the tremendous brown
bear which always occupied the
center of the room at the feet of its
tremendous master, one of the bob
sledding Stevens boys, stopped its
growling when she came in.
I saw Sonja Henie yesterday
for the first time since those win
ter Olympic days in the Ad iron
dacks. She's a movie star now.
Her name is up in lights, h.'r pic
tures gross millions, and her stu
dio dressing room is a padded satin
cell of luxury.
But she is the same Sonja. Maybe
a little prettier than when she was
working for gold medals instead of
just gold, but that's the only dif
ference. That, and the amount of
work she does.
'It is hard —this movie business,"
she said, and her mother nodded
and echoed "Yes, it is hard, very
hard work that my child must do."
'It is so much harder than skat
ing for medals," Sonja continued.
"I work more in one day on this
picture than I do in winning three
world championships. I get up at
5 in the morning and skate until
dinner time. I skate and skate
and skate. I do it perfect. I know.
But the director blows a whistle
and all must be done over again.'
The writer has a great respect for
directors, but he could not keep from
inquiring what director in Holly
wood knew enough about skating to
tell the world's greatest skater
when she was right or wrong.
"Oh no," she answered, "I did not
mean that. No one tells me. I am
the only judge of my own skating.
But the director and the dance di
rector they see the little things that
go wrong with the camera, the
lighting, the cast. Then the whistle
blows. And I used to think that
five or ten minutes of skating for a
medal was hard."
Not long after they resumed
shooting on her new picture,
"Happy Landings," and I saw that
Sonja meant. In one scene, which
has a background of a snow
covered forest. Sonja is supported
by n chorus of men and woman
dancers on ice skates. For some
two or three minutes everything
was perfect, with the chorus skat
ing gracefully about Sonja as she
whirled through an intricate ma
neuver. Then, just as Sonja spun
in the air for the finale, a whistle
blew and the director boomed
through the microphone:
"Nelson, pull up your drawers."
The director, Roy Del Ruth, had
spoted some drooping drawers, or
tights, on one of the chorus boys.
The scene was shot again and
again. First it was Nelson's draw
ers. Then it was vibration in a
camera. Then one of the girl skat
ers slipped and fell. On each one of
these retakes Sonja had to go
through her physically exhausting
routine.
When it was finally done, Sonja
confided in me that when the pic
ture is finished she is going on an
exhibition tour with her skaters.
"It will be grand," she said,
"just to skate once a day. We
will go to Chicago, Detroit, New
York. Boston, and finally Miami.
For all of us it will be great fun.
No whistles, no cameras, no
nothing."

ference. That, and the amount of
work she does.
'It is hard —this movie business,"
she said, and her mother nodded
and echoed "Yes, it is hard, very
hard work that my child must do."
'It is so much harder than skat
ing for medals," Sonja continued.
"I work more in one day on this
picture than I do in winning three
world championships. I get up at
5 in the morning and skate until
dinner time. I skate and skate
and skate. I do it perfect. I know.
But the director blows a whistle
and all must be done over again.'
The writer has a great respect for
directors, but he could not keep from
inquiring what director in Holly
wood knew enough about skating to
tell the world's greatest skater
when she was right or wrong.
"Oh no," she answered, "I did not
mean that. No one tells me. I am
the only judge of my own skating.
But the director and the dance di
rector they see the little things that
go wrong with the camera, the
lighting, the cast. Then the whistle
blows. And I used to think that
five or ten minutes of skating for a
medal was hard."
Not long after they resumed
shooting on her new picture,
"Happy Landings," and I saw that
Sonja meant. In one scene, which
has a background of a snow
covered forest. Sonja is supported
by n chorus of men and woman
dancers on ice skates. For some
two or three minutes everything
was perfect, with the chorus skat
ing gracefully about Sonja as she
whirled through an intricate ma
neuver. Then, just as Sonja spun
in the air for the finale, a whistle
blew and the director boomed
through the microphone:
"Nelson, pull up your drawers."
The director, Roy Del Ruth, had
spoted some drooping drawers, or
tights, on one of the chorus boys.
The scene was shot again and
again. First it was Nelson's draw
ers. Then it was vibration in a
camera. Then one of the girl skat
ers slipped and fell. On each one of
these retakes Sonja had to go
through her physically exhausting
routine.
When it was finally done, Sonja
confided in me that when the pic
ture is finished she is going on an
exhibition tour with her skaters.
"It will be grand," she said,
"just to skate once a day. We
will go to Chicago, Detroit, New
York. Boston, and finally Miami.
For all of us it will be great fun.
No whistles, no cameras, no
nothing."

She's a good skate.
We all agreed on that at Lake
Placid, five years ago, when she was
defending her Olympic champion
ship. In the evening, when the flags
of the nations had been lowered and
the cold winds came down from the
mountains, she used to drop in on
what we newspapermen called the
Cellar A. C. and sip at her beer as
daintily as she had whirled about
the ice on her silver blades.
She was mighty pretty then, too,
and the boys paid'her great compli
ment of stopping their play at the
slot machines just to sit and look
at her, and listen to her giggly little
laugh and appealing Norwegian ac
cent. Even the tremendous brown
bear which always occupied the
center of the room at the feet of its
tremendous master, one of the bob
sledding Stevens boys, stopped its
growling when she came in.
I saw Sonja Henie yesterday
for the first time since those win
ter Olympic days in the Ad iron
dacks. She's a movie star now.
Her name is up in lights, h.'r pic
tures gross millions, and her stu
dio dressing room is a padded satin
cell of luxury.

a little prettier than when she was
working for gold medals instead of
just gold, but that's the only dif

two or three minutes everything
was perfect, with the chorus skat
ing gracefully about Sonja as she
whirled through an intricate ma
neuver. Then, just as Sonja spun
in the air for the finale, a whistle
blew and the director boomed
through the microphone:
"Nelson, pull up your drawers."
The director, Roy Del Ruth, had
spoted some drooping drawers, or
tights, on one of the chorus boys.
The scene was shot again and
again. First it was Nelson's draw
ers. Then it was vibration in a
camera. Then one of the girl skat
ers slipped and fell. On each one of
these retakes Sonja had to go
through her physically exhausting
routine.
When it was finally done, Sonja
confided in me that when the pic
ture is finished she is going on an
exhibition tour with her skaters.
"It will be grand," she said,
"just to skate once a day. We
will go to Chicago, Detroit, New
York. Boston, and finally Miami.
For all of us it will be great fun.
No whistles, no cameras, no
nothing."

United Press Staff Correspondent
HOLLYWOOD, Dec. 2 (UP). -
She's a good skate.
We all agreed on that at Lake
Placid, five years ago, when she was
defending her Olympic champion
ship. In the evening, when the flags
of the nations had been lowered and
the cold winds came down from the
mountains, she used to drop in on
what we newspapermen called the
Cellar A. C. and sip at her beer as
daintily as she had whirled about
the ice on her silver blades.
She was mighty pretty then, too,
and the boys paid'her great compli
ment of stopping their play at the
slot machines just to sit and look
at her, and listen to her giggly little
laugh and appealing Norwegian ac
cent. Even the tremendous brown
bear which always occupied the
center of the room at the feet of its
tremendous master, one of the bob
sledding Stevens boys, stopped its
growling when she came in.
I saw Sonja Henie yesterday
for the first time since those win
ter Olympic days in the Ad iron
dacks. She's a movie star now.
Her name is up in lights, h.'r pic
tures gross millions, and her stu
dio dressing room is a padded satin
cell of luxury.
But she is the same Sonja. Maybe
a little prettier than when she was
working for gold medals instead of
just gold, but that's the only dif
ference. That, and the amount of
work she does.
'It is hard —this movie business,"
she said, and her mother nodded
and echoed "Yes, it is hard, very
hard work that my child must do."
'It is so much harder than skat
ing for medals," Sonja continued.
"I work more in one day on this
picture than I do in winning three
world championships. I get up at
5 in the morning and skate until
dinner time. I skate and skate
and skate. I do it perfect. I know.
But the director blows a whistle
and all must be done over again.'
The writer has a great respect for
directors, but he could not keep from
inquiring what director in Holly
wood knew enough about skating to
tell the world's greatest skater
when she was right or wrong.
"Oh no," she answered, "I did not
mean that. No one tells me. I am
the only judge of my own skating.
But the director and the dance di
rector they see the little things that
go wrong with the camera, the
lighting, the cast. Then the whistle
blows. And I used to think that
five or ten minutes of skating for a
medal was hard."
Not long after they resumed
shooting on her new picture,
"Happy Landings," and I saw that
Sonja meant. In one scene, which
has a background of a snow
covered forest. Sonja is supported
by n chorus of men and woman
dancers on ice skates. For some
two or three minutes everything
was perfect, with the chorus skat
ing gracefully about Sonja as she
whirled through an intricate ma
neuver. Then, just as Sonja spun
in the air for the finale, a whistle
blew and the director boomed
through the microphone:
"Nelson, pull up your drawers."
The director, Roy Del Ruth, had
spoted some drooping drawers, or
tights, on one of the chorus boys.
The scene was shot again and
again. First it was Nelson's draw
ers. Then it was vibration in a

ers slipped and fell. On each one of
these retakes Sonja had to go
through her physically exhausting

confided in me that when the pic
ture is finished she is going on an
exhibition tour with her skaters.
"It will be grand," she said,
"just to skate once a day. We
