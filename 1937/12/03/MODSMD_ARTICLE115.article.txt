LOS ANGELES, Dec. 2 (UP).â€”
Earle Harris, 200-pound California
at Los Angeles end who was de
clared ineligible a week ago, was
refused reinstatement for Saturday's
game with Southern California. His
plea to Dr. Robert Gordon Sprotii
was denied yesterday. Coach Bill
Spaulding is concerned about the
wearer since his key performer,
Ken Washington, bogs down on a
wet field and has trouble passing a
slick football.
