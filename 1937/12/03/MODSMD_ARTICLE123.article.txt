SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2 (UP).—
Random reminiscences of the 1937
Pacific Coast football season:
The consensus for the player of
the year award —Sam Chapman,
California halfback, who did every
thing well in every game. Next in
line, Phil Dougherty, Santa Clara's
alert, smart center.
Coaches of the year—Stub Allison
of California and Buck Shaw of San
ta Clara. They kept the Bears and
Broncos moving every game as a
unit and played down the individual
stars. Both were modest in victory,
Bill Paulman of Stanford —gashed
over the eye and knocked goofy on
the first play—returning to the Stan
ford lineup later to play an excellent
game against California.
