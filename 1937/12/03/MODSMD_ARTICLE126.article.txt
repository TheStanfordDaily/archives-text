# Mystery Golfer Loses to Ruth
## Bambino Praises Game Played by Montague 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 2 (UP).â€”Babe
Ruth has played golf with John
Montague four times and has beaten
him every time, the former baseball
player told the United Press today.
"We played three matches in ad
dition to that exhibition at Fresh
Meadow," Ruth said. "Say, I wish
you'd get one thing into the papers.
"Some of my friends have been
asking me about a story that Monty
lost a lot of money to me and left
town without paying. Well, he left
town all right, but he doesn't owe
me any money and never did. We
bet on just one match. That was a
$5 Nassau, and it came out even as
far as money was concerned be
cause we doubled up."
Ruth said that he thinks that Mon
tague is a potentially great golfer,
"because he certainly has all the
shots."
"1 want you to know that I was
lucky to beat him," Ruth added.
