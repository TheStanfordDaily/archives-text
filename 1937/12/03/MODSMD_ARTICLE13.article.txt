"I only hope that I can acquit ;
myself as well as my predecessors
have."
Thus John Bunn last night ac
knowledged his appointment as dean
of men, succeeding George Bliss
Culver, who retires at the end of
this academic year.
"I feel quite honored at being
chosen," said Mr. Bunn, "although
I know it will be a difficult task to
follow in the steps of Dean Culver
and Jack McDowell."
McDowell was the first Stanford
administrative officer to hold the
title of Dean of Men.
"It will be an honor to be asso
ciated with those men as their
successor," Mr. Bunn declared.
He indicated he will complete the
present basketball season, in which
the Indians will attempt to acquire
their third consecutive Coast Con- i
ference championship, before he
turns to study of his new position.
It will be then that, the basketball
coaching set-up for 1938-39 will be
considered and probable jurange
ments for his continued participa
tion in direction of the squad will
be made.
