# Red Machine Rolls Home After Season Wind-Up
## Grid Varsity Back From Lion Battle Players Reveal Inside Dope on Rugby Kick; Praise Sid Luckman 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Stanford varsity ball players, ar
riving from New York in derbies and
red blazers yesterday, agreed that
Sid Luckman, Lion fullback, de
serves greatest credit for Colum
bia's scoreless tie against the In
dians.
Wet ball and field were not
blamed. The boys pointed out that
"although it rained hard during the
game, conditions were no worse than
in the Cal game."
Passes Poor
Stanford passes, it was agreed,
should have been thrown into the
flat instead of over center, where
two were knocked down and one
was intercepted by the Lions.
The Cards' long and repeated runs
were accredited to fine offensive
blocking. But the Cardinal defense
was poor, and the boys knew why.
Columbia had an especially tricky
offense; but although Luckman's
passing was exceptionally good, the
Lion pass offense was nothing new
to the Cards.
The Big Red Machine met * the
same trouble it had encountered a
week earlier in the Big Game. The
passer was well guarded, and no
body could get at him.
Zone defense brought the Indians
the same difficulty as the week be
fore. Opponent pass-receivers sim
ply moved into territory between
zones, and nobody quite knew whom
to cover.
Odd Rulings
Rulings definitely had the Stan
ford boys stumped. Pete Fay, on
his way to the touchdown that
would have won the game, pivoted
away from the boundary line and
swung his right foot into so-called
"foul air," was ruled out of bounds.
But Referee W. H. Friessel realized
his mistake, according to the players,
as shown by his attitude toward Fay
and the team during the rest of the
game.
In fact, there were other cases
in the game where the same situa
tion arose, and nothing was said
about it. Jimmy Coffis nearly
knocked the ref over at one point
when his foot swung into "foul air"
whlie cat-walking in safe territory.
Another thing that would have
made the Stanford students see red
was the manner in which the Co
lumbians, between quarters, walked
over to the bench and talked things
over with Coach Lou Little. It may
be a New York custom, but accord
ing to the rule book it is wrong.
Rugby Boot Good
Interesting facts about Fay's sen
sational "rugby kick" play were
brought home by the returning In
dians. First of all, the play was
not to be a puntâ€”the play, called
by Fay himself, was meant for an
end run from fake punt formation.
But as the boys lined up, Fay
could see by the opponents' ex
pressions that they knew what was
planned, so he decided to kick.
Tsoutsouvas centered the ball to the
left, as was correct for the proposed
left end run, but the ball went too
far to the left for Fay to catch it
and make a safe kick.
Fast thinking told him the only

thing to do was to run the ball as
planned and pray that he could car
ry it out of the end zone. But the
opponents charged in from the left,
Fay cut back to the right, and
practically in the arms of the rest
of the New York team, he kicked
on a dead run over their heads to
the 40-yard line.
Columbia, it was agreed, was hot,
and Stanford had been gypped. But
the boys do not hesitate to admit
that if they had remained at their
Big Game peak, they would have
scalped the Lions by such a great
margin that the name Friessel would
never have seen print.
