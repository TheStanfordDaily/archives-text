# Rose Bowl Seats Taken by Alumni
## 
### 
PASADENA, Dec. 2 (UP).—Citi
zens of this Rose Bowl community
awoke today and found themselves
apparently forced to stay away from
the football game they built from a
neighborhood attraction into a na
tional classic.
The ticket sales office opened com
plete with telephones, clerks, and an
oversupply of customers, but with
little prospect of anything to sell.
There wasn't even anyone for the
indignant residents to blame, except
the Bowl for being too small, or the
University of California for being
too large.
The situation is this:
California, the Western represen
tative, is host to Alabama and this
city alike. All ticket arrangements
are in charge of the Golden Bear
officials, who first must fill the needs
of the alumni, the rooters, the sta
dium subscribers, and the Big "C"
Society members. These number
33,000 persons, each of whom is en
titled to buy six tickets, or a total of
• 198,000.

As a memorial to Irving Thalberg,
the producer, Dartmouth College
will give a course in screen wirting.
