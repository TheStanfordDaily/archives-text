SHANGHAI, Friday, Dec. 3 (UP).
â€”Japan today staged an impres
sive military demonstration in the
heart of the Anglo-American area
of Shanghai designed to impress
upon the Chinese the futility of hop
ing for effective foreign assistance
and the necessity of accepting truce
proposals which reportedly will be
delivered to Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-Shek in Nanking by the Ger
man ambassador.
Americans in Nanking doubted
that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
Chinese supreme commander, would
accept any suggestion of ending the
war at this time. They pointed out
that Chiang's military position is far
from hopeless and that he is receiv
ing indirect encouragement from a
number of countries, notably Brit
ain and Soviet Russia.
