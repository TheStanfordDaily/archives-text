# Christmas Play Set for Monday
## 
### 
The "Night of the Shepherds," to
be given Monday at 8 o'clock by the
class in Gertnan dramatics is a
simple play dealing with the birth of
Christ. The whole story is centered
about the star and the shepherds'
reactions to it.
This is the third German Christ
mas play to be given and according
to Dr. Kurt Reinhardt, who is di
recting the play, will be one of the
best as it is the first to be presented
in the Memorial Hall Little Theater.
German Christmas carols will be
sung both before and after the per
formance by the members of the
"Deutsche Singstunde." Tickets are
20 cents and will be on sale at the
door or in advance at the office of
the Secretary of the Department of
Germanic Languages in Room 115.
