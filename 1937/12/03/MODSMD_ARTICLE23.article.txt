Navy airplanes. Coast Guard cut
ters and land parties intensified
search at dawn today for two Navy

Officials at the Hampton Roads
naval air base said there still is
"definite possibility" that Aviation
Cadet James J. Jones of Washing

Class Troy W. Blanton of Lafayette,
Ala., still are alive.

leaped from the plane before it
crashed. Wearing life belts, they
might have drifted into the swampy

might still be bobbing about in the
Atlantic somewhere near Virginia
