### 
John W. Biinn, director of basketball at Stanford since 1!).'5I), will be
come dean of men at the opening of the next fall quarter, succeeding
George Bliss Culver, who reaches retirement age this year.
Bunn's appointment' to the position was announced last night by Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, general director of the School of Hygiene and Phys-

ical Education.
Appointment of the new dean was
| reported to have been confirmed by
the Board of Trustees several months
| ago, but it originally was not to
| have been announced until spring.
To prevent disruption of the bas
| ketball system which in the past two
seasons brought Stanford two Coast
| Conference championships, Coach
| Bunn will maintain contact with the
1 varsity coaching position.
New Varsity Coach
The Daily was reliably informed
last night that Wytze Gorter, fresh
man coach, probably will succeed
| Coach Bunn as director of varsity
| activities. The new dean will co
j operate with Gorter in an advisory
capacity so that the scheme and
philosophy of the present squad's
playing will not be lost.
The Daily also was informed that
H. B. Lee, member of the present
varsity and a physical education
major, may step into Gorter's post
as freshman coach, thereby further
assuring continuance of the system
introduced by Bunn.
Gorter, in the past, has been
praised by Coach Bunn as one of
his most capable and thorough
pupils.
