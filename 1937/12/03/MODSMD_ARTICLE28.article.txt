# "Trojan Women' Holds Opening Night Audience Dole, Campbell Score Hit in Greek Tragedy
## 
### JIM STONE 
The applause which greeted the
closing curtain of "The Trojan
Women" last night was not the hila
rious uproar of an audience that
laughs and forgets, but of an audi
ence that had felt the tragic after
maths of war in the wreckage of
noble lives.
Getting off to a rather plodding
start, Euripides' drama grew con
stantly, wove a spell which held the
audience silent through a contin
uous hour and a half of emotional
tension.
To Janet Dole go first honors for
a sincere and stately performance.
Miss Dole's Hecuba had a depth
and power which gave a foundation
to the whole structure, set the pace
and keynote for the tragedy.
But it was Kathleen Campbell's
Andromache that contributed an im
petus which made itself felt
throughout the whole performance.
She brought the audience to active
emotional grips with the hopeless

remains of a once-glorious past, left
in their minds a deep impression
which pervaded the whole atmos
phere of the subsequent action.
Frances Farmer, in a role differ
ent from any she has thus far at
tempted, reinforced the far-famed
reputation of Helen. Nor should
Virginia Rogers, who handled the
difficult part of Cassandra with
skill, be omitted from the role of
honor.
The chorus, led by Phyllis Cor
son, sustained the action throughout
with a smooth deftness seldom found
in amateur performances.
For the men, Gary Simpson dem
onstrated the skill which he has
shown before this year in "Murder
in the Cathedral," and "Don Juan."
Douglas Bryan's Meneleus displayed
a little too much huffing and* puff
ing for our taste, but was, never
theless, good.
The whole performance, a difficult
one in its long speeches, its lack of
action, moved with a pace and har

mony which denotes skilled direc
tion on the part of Thomas Wood
Stevens.
Not a play which might be ex
pected to hold the attention of the
"tired business man," "The Trojan
Women' has something to say, says
it in a way which is moving and
powerful. The play will be repeated
Friday and Saturday nights in the
Little Theater, 8 o'clock. You will
lose something by missing it.

to the whole structure, set the pace
and keynote for the tragedy.
But it was Kathleen Campbell's
Andromache that contributed an im
petus which made itself felt
throughout the whole performance.
She brought the audience to active
emotional grips with the hopeless

remains of a once-glorious past, left
in their minds a deep impression
which pervaded the whole atmos
phere of the subsequent action.
Frances Farmer, in a role differ
ent from any she has thus far at
tempted, reinforced the far-famed
reputation of Helen. Nor should
Virginia Rogers, who handled the
difficult part of Cassandra with
skill, be omitted from the role of
honor.
The chorus, led by Phyllis Cor
son, sustained the action throughout
with a smooth deftness seldom found
in amateur performances.
For the men, Gary Simpson dem
onstrated the skill which he has
shown before this year in "Murder
in the Cathedral," and "Don Juan."
Douglas Bryan's Meneleus displayed
a little too much huffing and* puff
ing for our taste, but was, never
theless, good.
The whole performance, a difficult
one in its long speeches, its lack of
action, moved with a pace and har

mony which denotes skilled direc
tion on the part of Thomas Wood
Stevens.
Not a play which might be ex
pected to hold the attention of the
"tired business man," "The Trojan
Women' has something to say, says
it in a way which is moving and
powerful. The play will be repeated
Friday and Saturday nights in the
Little Theater, 8 o'clock. You will
lose something by missing it.
The applause which greeted the
closing curtain of "The Trojan
Women" last night was not the hila
rious uproar of an audience that
laughs and forgets, but of an audi
ence that had felt the tragic after
maths of war in the wreckage of
noble lives.
Getting off to a rather plodding
start, Euripides' drama grew con
stantly, wove a spell which held the
audience silent through a contin
uous hour and a half of emotional
tension.
To Janet Dole go first honors for
a sincere and stately performance.
Miss Dole's Hecuba had a depth
and power which gave a foundation
to the whole structure, set the pace
and keynote for the tragedy.
