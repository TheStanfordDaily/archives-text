# Cal Leaders Vote For Quiet Big Game Rally
## 
### 
With the echo of the Big Game rally riot still roaring in their ears, 15
student leaders of the University of California met last Thursday and
voted to make next year's rally quiet and calm.
In its stead, a "mixer rally" will be held on the Friday morning preced
ing the game. This "mixer" rally is intended to restrain the rooters from

their previous rioting, and will served
as a quietus for Big Game hysteria.
Morning Rally
In order to prevent a repeat per
formance of this year's mass attack,
upon Berkeley police, the rally will
be held in the morning, which will
keep out non-student rowdies.
Hoping that the presence of both
men and women will serve to deter
some of the lustier spirits from dis
playing excess energy, the student
committee, headed by President
Stan McCaffery, decided that the
"mixer rally" would be held in the
quiet and dignified atmosphere of
the Greek Theater.
Student Police
In addition, the student commit
tee voted to lend the aid of the Big
"C" Society to Berkeley police dur
ing Big Game week in 1938. The
athletes would serve as patrols and
maintain peace in the Berkeley
streets.
Only flaw in the plan is that the
executive committee for 1938 might
decide to hold the same type of rally
that resulted in the riots of this year.
The present committee would have
no authority to compel the next ex
ecutive committee to comply with
the new ruling.
