WASHINGTON, D.C, Dec. 2 (UP) j
â€”Chairman Royal S. Copeland (D., I
N.Y.) of the Senate commerce j
committee introduced a bill today ;
to make the Railway Labor Act ap- j
plicable to the maritime industry.
His proposal, closely following rec
ommendations by Chairman Jo- 1
seph P. Kennedy of the Maritime
Commission, would require the
maritime industry to submit its dis
putes over contracts to the National
Mediation Board, which handles
similar cases involving railroads
and commercial airlines.
With this exception, Senator
Copeland's bill is similar to the one
which the House merchant marine
committee is considering.
