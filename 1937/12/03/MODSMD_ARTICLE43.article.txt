# Police Radio Men Get Ants in Pants
## 
### 
FRESNO, Dec. 2 (UP).â€”Radio car
patrolmen heard cries of pain in
stead of the familiar "calling all
cars" when they switched on their
radios last night-
Reason: a bunch of big, white
ants, freed from rotted planks in
the police station, got inside the
trousers of the police radio broad
casters.
