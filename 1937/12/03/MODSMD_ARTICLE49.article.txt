Will Lee, recording secretary of
the organization, will head the eve
ning's program with an informal dis
cussion of possible plans for some
type of international dwelling place

Such a plan is only in the forma

out in time, the group will sponsor
such a living place to be established

at the beginning of winter quarter.

Betty Moser, who will play the vio
lin, and also by group games.
"All foreign students are invited
to the party,' said Jacoby, "and any
students who are interested in at
tending or who need transportation
should call Betty McClintock at the
Delta' Gamma house. This invita
tion also includes American stu
dents."

where the party is to be given, is
571 Foothill Road.
