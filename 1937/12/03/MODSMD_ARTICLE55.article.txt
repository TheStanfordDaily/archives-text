## NO BAR FOR NITERY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
According to yesterday's paper, the
Ex Committee is trilling with the
Nitery. The defunct Nitery com
mittee suddenly decides to put in a
refreshment bar and other junk.
The Nitery was originally for peo
ple to congregate in and to have re
laxation in during class hours of the
day and to be used occasionally for
dapces, et cetera.
In the first place, a refreshment
bar is unnecessary. The Cellar is
only a few steps downstairs, and no
one as yet has broken a leg or
strained a gut walking downstairs
from the Nitery to have a drink. That
idea of having hashers bring drinks
upstairs is a good thing to make Ex
Committee think that Hyrnan and
cohorts have been sitting and think
ing about the Nitery.
In the second place, there are some
of us, in fact, most of us who con
tinually use the Nitery who go up
there to relax between classes. Dur
ing the day it should be a quiet
place to study in, read a magazine
or something of that sort. But to
convert it into a mob-gathering place
like the Cellar is foolish.
In the third place, why have two
watering-places just a few feet
apart? The only justification of a
soda fountain would be if the Nitery
were isolated like the. golf club
house.
Another thing: they said there
would be dances in the Nitery.
Where are they? During football
season were there any after-game
dances there? No, dear reader, no.,
But last year after "Down the
Hatch" they had a radio dance and
some of Stanford's frustrated in
structors came down and wrecked
the joint. I know, I was there. Tell
them to move to Paly, they make
enough money.
Suppose the Ex Committee wises
up and puts someone in charge of
the Nitery who can get up good
dances and make use of the place.
They could start an Artists' Bureau
for entertaining talent.
Anyway, don't make it a place like
the Cellar. One of those is enough.
Use it for a quiet place in the after
noon and week-end dances occa
sionally. Do something or let the
Nitery Committee go bury itself.

The Editor, Sir:
I am sure many students who use
the main room of the Library would
second this motionâ€”namely, that the
pseudo-baldheaded eagle who sits
in the middle of the room, and whose
duty it is to maintain peace and
QUIET, would either have the steel
taps removed from his shoes, or buy
himself a pai of Keds. He makes
twice as much noise as the average |
campus big shot does and four times
as many trips up and down the room.
Respectfully submitted,

The Editor, Sir:
In my humble opinion, something
ought to be done about this fellow
Thompson. Such talent as he has
displayed in handling the Steam
Holler and related material should
be preserved for all to see.
I know of several instances where
out of state readers have put in plugs
for him; let's demand it lirst.
I, for one, would know what to !
do with several copies of "The Red I
Steam Roller" if and when it's pub- I
lished.
