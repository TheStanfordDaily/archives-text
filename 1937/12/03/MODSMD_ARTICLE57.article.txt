# Student, Alumni, University Leaders Iron Out Difficulties in Farm Relations
## Views Held Toward Stanford Aired In Session 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Questions about Stanford and at
i titudes toward the University were
brought out and aired around a fire
| place as 23 representatives of the
student body, administration, and
alumni met in an open forum Wed
nesday night.
Designed partially as a means of
j ironing out differences in opinion
, in student-faculty and student-ad
ministration relations, the meeting
j grew out of a similar one held re
! eently for members of The Daily
staff by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds, re
! tiring president of Stanford Asso-
I ciates.
I Wednesday's meeting, also held in
j Dr. Reynolds' home, was led in
! formally by George Ditz, new presi
' dent of the Associates.
'Gripes' Answered
i Typical "gripes" such as "poor
| quality of Lower Division instruc
j tion," the Administration's "make
| checks payable" attitude, and "Stan
| ford is slipping" were answered by
j Acting President Edgar E. Robin
| son, Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson,
and Professor Ralph Lutz.
Teaching in Lower Division and
i undergraduate schools, Professor
j Robinson declared, is actually bet-
I ter at Stanford than at comparable
j universities.
"There are more professors avail
| able for lower division teaching at
| Stanford," he said. "Almost every
professor here teaches sophomore
classes at least."
Finances Discussed
Since checks payable to Stanford
are of especial interest to the Asso
i ciates, the question of the Univer
| sity's financial policy caused a long
| discussion. The group agreed that
I most students failed to realize that
j one-half to two-thirds of their edu
cation is free.
To most people, education is a free
thing, paid for by taxation, was Pro
fessor Robinson's opinion. Here, at
a private institution, we have to
build a new psychology to combat
that attitude, he said.
A significant attempt to form a
new attitude was cited by Comp
troller J. Hugh Jackson, who de
clared that "Please" was added to
the ridiculed "Make Checks Pay
able" sign in the Administration
Building, when the first resentment
against the sign was heard.
He said that, although his office
was always open to student sugges
tion, in the nine months that he hac'
been comptroller no student had
made any complaint on policy to
him.
Stanford Slipping?
Opinion that Stanford is slipping
in academic standing was traced
back to an article in The Atlantic
Monthly on the so-called Embree
report of last year. Even alumni
spread the misconception caused by
the report, members of the group
declared.
In rebuttal, Professor Lutz told of
opinions ho had heard at a recent
convention of the American Asso
ciation of American Universities.
There, he said, Stanford was con
sidered one of the top universities,
especially in the quality of its ad
ministration.
