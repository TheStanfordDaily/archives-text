# Public Understanding Sought by Associates
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
"Stanford Associates seek to bring understanding of the problems of
i the University to the various groups connected with it and to the public
in general," George Ditz, new president of the alumni organization, said
on a visit to the campus Wednesday.
"The Associates," he explained, "will continue in their past program
which has aimed at advancement of the interests of the University." Ditz

I pointed out that the Associates is<
I an organization consisting of 250
Stanford alumni, formed for the
purpose of giving service to the Uni
versity. Their primary object, he
I said, is to stand ready to help Stan
] ford in any way that appears neces
sary.
Stanford Fund
In the past, the Associates have
i concentrated on public relations
J work, seeking to acquaint alumni
| and students with facts about Stan
j lord. This policy, Ditz said, will be
t continued. In the three years since
| organization, the Associates have
' carried out several publiicty projects,
j guided by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds,
i past president. In the first year, they
j issued brochures explaining Uni
j versity problems. These were dis
! tributed to alumni with the Illus
trated Review. The Associates also
! sponsored Stanford dinners in New
j York and San Francisco, where edu
| cational topics were discussed.
"One of the most important proj
i ects of the organization is the Stan-
I ford Fund," Ditz said. The Stanford
! Fund consists of two committees
] whose object is to assist the Uni
! versity in matters concerning its en
dowment. The committee on an
nual appeal promoted a campaign
last year which made it possible for
alumni to contribute to the fund
through class organizations. The re
sponse was gratifying, Ditz said.
Promote Co-ordination
Committee on special gifts ex
plains to persons interested in the
I University the facts about Stanford,
and points out to them where their
contributions would do the most
good. This committee is headed by
Morgan A. Gunst for Northern Cali
fornia, and by Louis Roseberry in
Southern California.
The Associates attempt to promote
co-ordination between the groups
connected with the University. Ditz
pointed out that there are occasions
when students and alumni would
understand each other and Stanford
better if they were in possession of
the facts.
The group directs its publicity
program toward presenting the facts
about the University to alumni, stu
dents, and public. It is their belief
that this will do much to prevent
misunderstanding and working at
cross purposes.
Student Influence
"Students just out of school can
do a tremendous amount of good for
Stanford," Ditz said. He pointed out
j that every graduate becomes u rep
resentative of the University in his

jommunity, and can vise his influence
to better Stanford. The Associates
hope to inform the students of Uni
versity facts and problems so that
ihey may be in a better position to
aid Stanford after graduation.
In carrying out their work, Ditz
stated, the Associates seek to get an
understanding of the viewpoint of
all groups concerned.

I ford Fund," Ditz said. The Stanford
! Fund consists of two committees
] whose object is to assist the Uni
! versity in matters concerning its en
dowment. The committee on an
nual appeal promoted a campaign
last year which made it possible for
alumni to contribute to the fund
through class organizations. The re
sponse was gratifying, Ditz said.
Promote Co-ordination
Committee on special gifts ex
plains to persons interested in the
I University the facts about Stanford,
and points out to them where their
contributions would do the most
good. This committee is headed by
Morgan A. Gunst for Northern Cali
fornia, and by Louis Roseberry in
Southern California.
The Associates attempt to promote
co-ordination between the groups
connected with the University. Ditz
pointed out that there are occasions
when students and alumni would
understand each other and Stanford
better if they were in possession of
the facts.
The group directs its publicity
program toward presenting the facts
about the University to alumni, stu
dents, and public. It is their belief
that this will do much to prevent
misunderstanding and working at
cross purposes.
Student Influence
"Students just out of school can
do a tremendous amount of good for
Stanford," Ditz said. He pointed out
j that every graduate becomes u rep
resentative of the University in his

jommunity, and can vise his influence
to better Stanford. The Associates
hope to inform the students of Uni
versity facts and problems so that
ihey may be in a better position to
aid Stanford after graduation.
In carrying out their work, Ditz
stated, the Associates seek to get an
understanding of the viewpoint of
all groups concerned.
"Stanford Associates seek to bring understanding of the problems of
i the University to the various groups connected with it and to the public
in general," George Ditz, new president of the alumni organization, said
on a visit to the campus Wednesday.
"The Associates," he explained, "will continue in their past program
which has aimed at advancement of the interests of the University." Ditz

I pointed out that the Associates is<
I an organization consisting of 250
Stanford alumni, formed for the
purpose of giving service to the Uni
versity. Their primary object, he
I said, is to stand ready to help Stan
] ford in any way that appears neces
sary.
Stanford Fund
In the past, the Associates have
i concentrated on public relations
J work, seeking to acquaint alumni

j lord. This policy, Ditz said, will be
t continued. In the three years since

' carried out several publiicty projects,
j guided by Dr. Harry B. Reynolds,
i past president. In the first year, they
j issued brochures explaining Uni
j versity problems. These were dis
! tributed to alumni with the Illus
trated Review. The Associates also
! sponsored Stanford dinners in New
j York and San Francisco, where edu
| cational topics were discussed.
