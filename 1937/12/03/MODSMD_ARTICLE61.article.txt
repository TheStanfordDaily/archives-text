# Hawaiian Club Plans Holidays
## Honoluluites Find Farm Winters Too Cold 
### 
Christmas will be a sunny affair
for quite a number of the students
from the Hawaiian islands. Far
from Xmas trees, cellophane wrap
ped packages, and the good old plum
pudding of a Christmas at home,
will be the members of the Ha
waiian club who are planning a
Yuletide trip into the tropical cli
mate of Mexico.
The proposed itinerary will take
the*group down through Southern
California and Arizona, deep into
Mexico to the newly opened resort
of Guaymas, southern terminus of
the Pan-American highway. Those
going on the trip will gypsy it in
tourist camps on the way down to
help cut down on expenses.
Three hundred miles below the
Arizona border, it will be deep
enough in Mexico to allow the trav
elers to see real Mexican life by
taking side trips to Mexico City and
other choice spots.
The party that goes will be ade
quately entertained as the Hawaiian
club has many accomplished sing
ers, dancers, and musicians as mem
bers.
Anyone interested is invited to
join the club on the Mexican jaunt.
It is not limited to members of
Honoluluites. Adequate chaperonage
for the women has been arranged.
Anyone interested can get in touch
with Bill Ward, Adrian Englehard,
Margaret Greenwell, and Gertrude
Tucker, officers of the club.
