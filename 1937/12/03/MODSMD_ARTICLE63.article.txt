# Peace Croup Decides Policy

### 
A discussion of the basic convic
tions of the World Foundation or
ganization as outlined by the inter
national council which met at Pari*
last September, formed the central
theme of the meeting of the new
Stanford group last night.
Led by Chairman Ralph H. Lutz,
the group came to the conclusion
that the emphasis on the nature of
the movement should be placed on
the fact that it is entirely non-con

troversial. This is in direct contrast
to th" type of international organi
zation as represented by the League
of Nations where national issues
cause much bitterness.
A motion was passed that another
meeting be held in January, which
would be planned by a nominating
and program committee to be ap
pointed. Thi.s committee will con
sist both of faculty members and
students.
