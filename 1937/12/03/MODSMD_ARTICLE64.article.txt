SINCE that first day in October, forty-six years
ago, when a group of some four hundred
students tramped into the barren Inner Quad
and heard first life breathed into the sandstone
at Opening Day, Stanford has had but two
Deans of Men.
Today Stanford learns the name of its third.
With the appointment of John W. Bunn to
succeed Dean George B. Culver next fall as
Dean of Men, the Board of Trustees has singled
out an individual whose record of achievement
and personal merit goes unchallenged.
But traditionally the "record of achievement
and personal merit" phrase is shuffled out of the
old box to use when men are appointed and
when men resign, and today a drugged mar
ket of such cliche phraseology makes those
words hollow and damnably trite.
Better than scuffling through it all again, is
this statement made without authorization but
still unquestionably true.
Had a board of students chosen a successor
to Dean Culver, they would have undoubtedly
picked John Bunn.
That, in itself, is worth three thousand'lino
type slugs each inscribed in ultra boldface with
the "record of achievement and personal merit"
handywords.
For seven years Bunn has coached basketball
on the Stanford Farm, to become not only re
spected and admired but a genuine friend of
his every contact. That is the test of the able
administrator. Respect and admiration often
come when the element of friendship is inhib

ited, never with Bunn.
Nearly four years ago a quaky frosh reporter
slipped into the Daily shack, awed by Stanford
and none-too-confident about anything. He was
sent to interview Bunn on the basketball pros
pects for that year — a memorable day for a
greenhorn reporter.
Memorable because it was the beginning of
a fine friendship with John Bunn, secondly be
cause it resulted in the ever-important story,
thirdly because ten minutes of conversation
with that man put stability into a pair of weak
knees and an uncertain mind. I will always
remember that day.
And everyone who has contacted John Burm
on the Stanford campus has repeatedly en
dorsed the man as does this reporter, so often
that his appointment as a future Dean of Men
comes less as a surprise and more as an ex
pected event in the annals of the University.
John Bunn has a heavy task ahead when he
steps into the boots of George B. Culver. There
is no need for elaboration on that point. Dean
Culver's popularity is understood, and as his
retirement nears there will be ample words of
commendation in these columns and otherwise
for Stanford's lovable Dean.
But today is John Bunn's day. And today, on
the eve of the Stanford Daily sign-off for fall
quarter, we find that we've stumbled through
a wandering editorial which means to make at
least one point definitely.
We see in John Bunn the finest man Stanford
could have chosen for its new Dean of Men.
We wish him success.

and personal merit goes unchallenged.
But traditionally the "record of achievement
and personal merit" phrase is shuffled out of the
old box to use when men are appointed and
when men resign, and today a drugged mar
ket of such cliche phraseology makes those
words hollow and damnably trite.
Better than scuffling through it all again, is
this statement made without authorization but
still unquestionably true.
Had a board of students chosen a successor
to Dean Culver, they would have undoubtedly
picked John Bunn.
That, in itself, is worth three thousand'lino
type slugs each inscribed in ultra boldface with
the "record of achievement and personal merit"
handywords.
For seven years Bunn has coached basketball
on the Stanford Farm, to become not only re
spected and admired but a genuine friend of
his every contact. That is the test of the able
administrator. Respect and admiration often
come when the element of friendship is inhib

ited, never with Bunn.
Nearly four years ago a quaky frosh reporter
slipped into the Daily shack, awed by Stanford
and none-too-confident about anything. He was
sent to interview Bunn on the basketball pros
pects for that year — a memorable day for a
greenhorn reporter.
Memorable because it was the beginning of
a fine friendship with John Bunn, secondly be
cause it resulted in the ever-important story,
thirdly because ten minutes of conversation
with that man put stability into a pair of weak
knees and an uncertain mind. I will always
remember that day.
And everyone who has contacted John Burm
on the Stanford campus has repeatedly en
dorsed the man as does this reporter, so often
that his appointment as a future Dean of Men
comes less as a surprise and more as an ex
pected event in the annals of the University.
John Bunn has a heavy task ahead when he
steps into the boots of George B. Culver. There
is no need for elaboration on that point. Dean
Culver's popularity is understood, and as his
retirement nears there will be ample words of
commendation in these columns and otherwise
for Stanford's lovable Dean.
But today is John Bunn's day. And today, on
the eve of the Stanford Daily sign-off for fall
quarter, we find that we've stumbled through
a wandering editorial which means to make at
least one point definitely.
We see in John Bunn the finest man Stanford
could have chosen for its new Dean of Men.
We wish him success.
SINCE that first day in October, forty-six years
ago, when a group of some four hundred
students tramped into the barren Inner Quad
and heard first life breathed into the sandstone
at Opening Day, Stanford has had but two
Deans of Men.
Today Stanford learns the name of its third.
With the appointment of John W. Bunn to
succeed Dean George B. Culver next fall as
Dean of Men, the Board of Trustees has singled
out an individual whose record of achievement
and personal merit goes unchallenged.
