# This Is A Short Edit

THE annual sale of Christmas Seals again is
being held between Thanksgiving and
Christmas. The money received finances the
greatest single attack on tuberculosis. Support
from The Daily has been asked.
A long suporting editorial might be impres
sive. A short edit might be read. This is that
short edit sincerely supporting the sale of
Christmas Seals.
The critical faculty alone does not drive the
world forward. The vitalizing force is the power
of imagination. The two are not contradictory
but complementary. . . . Great men have this
faculty in an extraordinary degree. — Daily
Princetonian
Nothing makes people so worthy of compli
ments as occasionally receiving them. One is
more delightful for being told one is delightful
—just as one is more angry for being told one
is angry.—Katherine F. Gerould
