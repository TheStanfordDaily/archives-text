## THERE IS A VIRGINIA, SANTA 
### 
Dear Santa Claus:
AS you probably know this is the last issue of The
Daily until next quarter and I won't have another
chance to write you without spending a week in the
post office trying to buy a stamp. I think I'll try a
new technique this year; the one last Christmas
worked pretty well, but you fell down badly on that
car I wanted.
Once I read a very sweet story about a boy who
wrote you and didn't ask for a thing for himself.
All he mentioned was a lot of stuff for other people,
but on Christmas morning, 10, the place was littered
with beautiful things for the boy. I trust, dear Santa,
that you'll bear -this in mind as I proceed with my
unselfish plea. #

First of all, I wish you'd give Mr. Van Patten a
new reserve room at the library. Then he could close
it up on Sunday nights and sit and meditate upon
how much money he is saving by not having it open.
In the meantime we can use the regular reserve room
to study.
And then, Chaparral Editor Hartmann could use
a lot of things. He needs a bucket of whitewash to
touch up that little affair of the Chappie-Daily foot
ball game. I still think that after that fiasco Hart
mann ought to tip his hat every time he passes a
worm. Any man who would issue a challenge when
he knew the game couldn't be played is lower than a
flat-chested snake.

JRVIN JORGENSEN neeris a new committee. The
old one for medical aid for the Spanish Loyalists is
getting awfully threadbare, and Jorgi is really ashamed
to appear with it. Of course, he's very proud and will
never admit it. But he looks pitiful wandering around
without any committee to play with. A lot of people
have tried to give him their old ones, but Jorgi is
too proud to appear in a second-hand committee. He
wants a new one he can show to the commissar.
The University wants a telephone switchboard so
that it won't have to notify the department of missing
persons when it has to get hold of a man in the dor
mitories. The way things stand now we have to send
out a Saint Bernard or a carrier pigeon.

There are also a lot of little things that people want.
Mr. Lange is hunting for a play that everybody can
understand and nobody can produce, or maybe it's the
other way around. A sophomore who went to the
Cellar for a coke last month would like news of the
hasher that took his order. The B.A.C. wants a bunch
of row-boats for the next Big Game. Tiny wants the
opportunity to develop some more character on a 250-
pound scale.
Our backshop foreman wants to get back the letter
his grand-daughter wrote to you, Santa. He says he
wants to use it himself. And the dramatics boys want
a carload of Gaieties tickets, to prove there were
some in existence.
And then there's one very important thing that I'm
afraid will be too much for you. Ex Committee wants
a problem it can settle without setting a precedent.
Yours
John Cobbs
