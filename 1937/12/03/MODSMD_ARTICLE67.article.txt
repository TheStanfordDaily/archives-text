/ CURRENT plans of the San Francisco hotels are to
have Joe Reichman, so-called "Pagliacci of ihe
Piano," do a return act—remember —he was at the
Fairmont before the hotel strike; an early return en
gagement of Red Norvo to the Frantic; and another
visitation of Anson Weeks in the near future. Also
some very interesting rumors going about to the effect
that Bunny Berigan and Tommy Dorsey are due for
a stay in San Francisco.
If you missed Jimmy Lunceford in Oakland during
the holidays, you'll have a chance to recoup a little
by catching Fletcher Henderson when he comes to
Sweet's Ballroom this next week-end, Sunday I be
lieve. And after that Louis Armstrong, with the best
band backing him he has ever had. It includes
Allen on trumpet and Louis Russell on piano.
Although no one else seems to have heard of her
around here, the best up-and-coming vocalist that I
have heard for many a year is haunting my dreams.
She is Maxine Williams, a colored lass, discovered by
Claude Thornhill, negro pianist. At present she is
singing in the Onyx Club in New York. Unfortunately,
she has made only two recordings, and for Vocalion,
whose palters aren't as easily accessible as they
should be.
"I'm Coming Virginia," ''Loch Lomond," "Blue
Skies," and "Annie Laurie" (Vocalion 3679) are the
tunes she has recorded up to now. Her voice has lots
of personality; by that I mean you can easily rec
ognize her voice after having heard it a couple of
times, if you are addicted to that sort of thing. It is
as characteristic as those of Helen Ward, Mildred
Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, or Harriet Hilliard.
CHE gets lots of swing out of her inflections and it
seems to me while she doesn't possess Ella Fitz
gerald's lusty, spirited shouting, or Bailey's more re
fined, sophisticated style, she does have a manner of
singing that insinuates itself. It grows and grows, and
after closely listening to her you can't help feeling
that she is reaching you with her rhythmically sub
dued incantations. On these records she is backed by
an all-colored group consisting of Buster Bailey, clari
net; Frank Newton, trumpet; Claude Thornhill, piano;
Pete Brown, alto; Babe Russell, tenor; John Kirby,
bass; O'Neil Spencer, drums. Some of these men
helped make Fletcher Henderson into the smooth
working unit that he had last year, but are all now
working at the Onyx Club.
One of the greatest bits of news concerning swing
music I have heard for some time concerns the return
of Sonny Dunham back into the Casa Loma fold.
If you are a Casa Lomaddict you'll know that it was
oSnny who used to take off on all the wild trumpet
rides in Blue Jazz. White Heat, and help do some
marvelous work in the fast trombone trio work that
the Casa Loma did in tunes such as 'Wild Goose
Chase." He left them to take a cruise in the Mediter
ranean and since then the Casa Loma crew hasn't
been quite as sparkling. But with his return, there
ought to be some definite improvement shown in the
musical quality of the Casa Loma. And his arranging
ability will definitely add to the band's value.
