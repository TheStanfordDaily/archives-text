# Critic Lauds Life Story of Madame Curie
## 
### 
Calm and deep end powerful as
: a river, the life story of the discov
| erer of radium and her husband
flows through one of the most beau
i tifully written books to come off the
| presses in many years, Eve Curie's
j just-published "Madame Curie; The
' Story of My Mother."
Much has been written about the
J drama of research, but rarely, ex-

cept in isolated
instances such as
the fictional "Ar
rewsmith," has it
been presented to
the public, and
» never has it been
presented so viv
idly as here.
Passion to Learn
The high pas
sion for learning

has created one of ihe most
exclusive religions in the world—
the religion of Science—has at last
been done full justice.
Days of Poverty
Manya Skladowska was born in
oppressed Poland, daughter of a low
salaried professor. It was not until
she had almost completed an ado
lescence devoted to the customary
agitation for Polish freedom that she
decided upon a career, but once it
had been decided nothing could stop
her from achieving it.
There followed days of living al
most literally in a garret in Paris
while she studied at the Sorbonne;
I days when she did nothing but exist

in order to learn, yetting through the |
j day sometimes on tea and bread, and
I staying up until 2 or 3 every morn- ,
| ing
There followed examination after
j examination with the name of Ma
rie Sklawdowska (the "Manya" sac
rificed long ago in French pronun- J
ciation) always standing at the top, j
or very near it. There followed, |
finally, her meeting with and mar- j
riage to one of the most brilliant
men of science who ever lived, a !
man whose brilliance matched her I
own, and with whom she could live I
and work in perfect harmony — I
Pierre Curie.
Brief Happiness
After this came a few brief years i
iof happiness, blessed with two j
daughters, Eve, the author, and j
I Irene, who today carries on her'
j parents' work in Paris; and culmi- |
; nating in the designation of the Cu- '
| lies as joint recipients of the Nobel :
Prize for Science.
j Tragedy coming so soon that it
| left Marie Curie stunned and help- l
I less, took Pierre Curie from her at
this peak of their career together, j
He was run over by a wagon in the j
noon-day traffic of Paris, and his
widuw was left alone to continue her
researches.
In relating this story of her moth- j
er's life, Eve Curie has drawn heav- I
| ily on personal records and her own
[ vivid memories. It is a fitting tribute I
to a genius, a truly inspiring book
; about a great and indomitable wom
-1 an who contributed much to science
| and mankind.

Days of Poverty
Manya Skladowska was born in
oppressed Poland, daughter of a low
salaried professor. It was not until
she had almost completed an ado
lescence devoted to the customary
agitation for Polish freedom that she
decided upon a career, but once it
had been decided nothing could stop
her from achieving it.
There followed days of living al
most literally in a garret in Paris
while she studied at the Sorbonne;
I days when she did nothing but exist

in order to learn, yetting through the |
j day sometimes on tea and bread, and
I staying up until 2 or 3 every morn- ,
| ing
There followed examination after
j examination with the name of Ma
rie Sklawdowska (the "Manya" sac
rificed long ago in French pronun- J
ciation) always standing at the top, j
or very near it. There followed, |
finally, her meeting with and mar- j
riage to one of the most brilliant
men of science who ever lived, a !
man whose brilliance matched her I
own, and with whom she could live I
and work in perfect harmony — I
Pierre Curie.
Brief Happiness
After this came a few brief years i
iof happiness, blessed with two j
daughters, Eve, the author, and j
I Irene, who today carries on her'
j parents' work in Paris; and culmi- |
; nating in the designation of the Cu- '
| lies as joint recipients of the Nobel :
Prize for Science.
j Tragedy coming so soon that it
| left Marie Curie stunned and help- l
I less, took Pierre Curie from her at
this peak of their career together, j
He was run over by a wagon in the j
noon-day traffic of Paris, and his
widuw was left alone to continue her
researches.
In relating this story of her moth- j
er's life, Eve Curie has drawn heav- I
| ily on personal records and her own
[ vivid memories. It is a fitting tribute I
to a genius, a truly inspiring book
; about a great and indomitable wom
-1 an who contributed much to science
| and mankind.
