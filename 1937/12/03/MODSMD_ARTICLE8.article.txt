# Barclay Sees Further Rift Among Democrats
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
The present deadlock in the i
House of Representatives over the i
question of wages and hours legis- j
lation "indicates clearly part of the 1
widening rift between Roosevelt and j
the Southern conservatives," Pro
fessor Thomas S. Barclay of the
political science department de
clared yesterday, in commenting
upon the situation in the special
session of Congress and its effects
upon the Democratic party.
Upon the basis of pledges in the
1936 platform and the promises of
the candidates, Barclay said that
"the' mandate of the Democratic
party to enact wages and hours leg
islation is as clear as anything in
American politics can be."
At the present time the Adminis
tration's wages and hours bill is
being held in the House rules com- I
mittee by an alliance of five South
ern conservative Democrats with
four Republicans.
'Threat to Industry'
This "paradoxical situation in
which the chief opposition to the
New Deal bill comes from the tradi
tional Democratic stronghold of the
solid South" is caused, Barclay be
lieves, by the fact that the Black-
Conncry bill "is there regarded as a
sinister threat to the further indus
trial development of the region.'
Although a large majority of the
House membership would probably
favor wages and hours legislation, he ;
pointed out that the Administration J
leaders in ihe House so far have been
unable to out-maneuver the Repub- |
lican-Southern Democratic coalition i
and extricate the bill from the rules i

committee.
"Members of the opposition party
will gladly support a fellow mem
ber against his own leader," Bar
clay said, in explaining the bi-parti
san coalition against the bill. "That
is simply human nature in politics."
Two parliamentary devices exist
to break the present "embarrassing
deadlock": suspension of the rules
and invoking of the discharge rule.
"Party leaders fear to use the for
mer method," he said, while he de
scribed the procedure of discharging
a committee from further considera
tion of any bill as complicated and
cumbersome.
As yet the 213 signatures required
to petitions under the latter proce
dure have not been obtained, and if
they are the House could consider
the bill only on the second and
fourth Mondays of each month.
Three Factors
Barclay—who will be on leave
next quarter and will be studying
the present situation in Washington
—said that factors now causing many
Southern Democrats "to openly op
pose many of the New Deal policies"
include the anti-lynching bill now
before Congress, plans to reorganize
the federal judiciary, and the 1936
abolition of the two-thirds majority
rule in the Democratic National
Convention, "which deprivecf the
South of its veto power."
"Basically," he concluded, "it is a
struggle for the direction of party
policy and tho control of party ma
chinery that will doubtless become
more intense as the campaign of
1940 approaches."

before Congress, plans to reorganize
the federal judiciary, and the 1936
abolition of the two-thirds majority
rule in the Democratic National
Convention, "which deprivecf the
South of its veto power."
"Basically," he concluded, "it is a
struggle for the direction of party
policy and tho control of party ma
chinery that will doubtless become
more intense as the campaign of
1940 approaches."
The present deadlock in the i
House of Representatives over the i
question of wages and hours legis- j
lation "indicates clearly part of the 1
widening rift between Roosevelt and j
the Southern conservatives," Pro
fessor Thomas S. Barclay of the
political science department de
clared yesterday, in commenting
upon the situation in the special
session of Congress and its effects
upon the Democratic party.
Upon the basis of pledges in the
1936 platform and the promises of
the candidates, Barclay said that
"the' mandate of the Democratic
party to enact wages and hours leg
islation is as clear as anything in
American politics can be."
At the present time the Adminis
tration's wages and hours bill is
being held in the House rules com- I
mittee by an alliance of five South
ern conservative Democrats with
four Republicans.
'Threat to Industry'
This "paradoxical situation in
which the chief opposition to the
New Deal bill comes from the tradi
tional Democratic stronghold of the
solid South" is caused, Barclay be
lieves, by the fact that the Black-
Conncry bill "is there regarded as a
sinister threat to the further indus
trial development of the region.'
Although a large majority of the
House membership would probably
favor wages and hours legislation, he ;
pointed out that the Administration J
leaders in ihe House so far have been
unable to out-maneuver the Repub- |
lican-Southern Democratic coalition i
and extricate the bill from the rules i

committee.
"Members of the opposition party
will gladly support a fellow mem
ber against his own leader," Bar
clay said, in explaining the bi-parti
san coalition against the bill. "That
is simply human nature in politics."
Two parliamentary devices exist
to break the present "embarrassing
deadlock": suspension of the rules
and invoking of the discharge rule.
"Party leaders fear to use the for
mer method," he said, while he de
scribed the procedure of discharging
a committee from further considera
tion of any bill as complicated and
cumbersome.
As yet the 213 signatures required
to petitions under the latter proce
dure have not been obtained, and if
they are the House could consider
the bill only on the second and
fourth Mondays of each month.
Three Factors
Barclay—who will be on leave
next quarter and will be studying
the present situation in Washington
—said that factors now causing many
Southern Democrats "to openly op
pose many of the New Deal policies"
include the anti-lynching bill now
before Congress, plans to reorganize
the federal judiciary, and the 1936
abolition of the two-thirds majority
rule in the Democratic National
Convention, "which deprivecf the
South of its veto power."
