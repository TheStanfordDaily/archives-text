lIANNES SCHROLLE, Hie famous skier who is exhibiting his
skill this year at Yosemite National Park, is shown above in the new
est device to give skiers additional speed. It is a pair of bat-like,
man-made wings which catch the wind and give skiers the sensa

of 90 miles an hour in short runs without the wings and is hoping
for still greater speed through their use. .
