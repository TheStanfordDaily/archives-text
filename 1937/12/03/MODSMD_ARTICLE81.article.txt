# Frosh Hoopsters Clash With Varsity Tomorrow
## 
### 
.
Prepared to make the varsity hustle, one of Stanford's tallest-ever
frosh basketball fives tangles with Coach John Bunn's varsity tomorrow
in their annual game.
Coach Wytze Gorter announces his starting lineup as follows: Don Wil
liams and Bill Masters, forwards; Dick Taylor, center; Bob Stone and

either Ed DeMoss or Bill Rumbley,*
guards.
The above combination is just
about the tallest that Gorter can send
against the varsity, only Stone being
under six feet. Williams and Mas
ters are both six feet, Taylor stands
6 feet 6¥2 inches, Rumbley soars 6
feet 5 inches, and DeMoss is a mere
6 feet 3 inches.
Frosh Lost in '3fi
Last year's frosh lost to the varsity
by a score of 30-9, holding them to
less points than any other foe. Coach
Gorter believes that the added height
on the '41 team makes them slightly
better than their predecessors, but
doesn't expect them to do any bet
| ter.
Following the game, the two teams
will hold a scrimmage. Gorter will
throw twenty men into the actual
contest and the scrimmage.
Other freshmen who have flashed
good form in recent workouts are
Bill Marshall, Bill Schroedcr, and
Stan Graff on the forward line and
Bud Jones, John Alltucker, and Bill
Niccolls at guard.
Harbkc Back
With the return of Harland
Harbkc to relieve Taylor at'center,
one of Gorter's chief worries is alle
viated. Harbkc has been out with a
1 sprained ankle. Em Hiler is closely
pressing Harbke. DeMoss can also
fill in at center.
Showings tomorrow will go a long
1 way toward deciding the personnel
t of twelve players who will go barn
storming Christmas vacation.
