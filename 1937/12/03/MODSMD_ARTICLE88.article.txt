# Varsity, Frosh Cagers Clash Tomorrow
## Farm Hoop Men To Open New Season John Bonn Will Offer Demonstration; Frosh In Conflict Tomorrow 
### 
Fisrt flurry of the 1937-38 basket- j
□all season for both varsity and |
freshmen pops up in Encina Pavilion j
tomorrow afternoon, when Coach |
John Bunn's technique demonstra- i
tion by the varsity will precede the
annual frosh-varsity contest.
The demonstration, set for 3
a'clock, has been planned by Coach
Bunn with the view of explaining
some of the fundamentals of the
system in use at Stanford. An un
derstanding of these fundamentals
by fans will help them in enjoying
both varsity and freshman games
throughout the season, Bunn feels.
Students Invited
All students are cordially invited
to visit the pavilion for the affair.
Also in attendance will be bay re
gion high school coaches and teams
interested in analyzing Coach Bunn's
methods.
Immediately following the dem
onstration the Crimson Giants will
take on Coach Wytze Gorter's frosh
five in the first real competitive test
of the year for both outfits.
How seriously both coaches take
the game is reflected in the starting
line-ups posted yesterday. For the
varsity there will open Captain Hank
Luisetti at one forward, Phil Zonne
at the other, Art Stoefen at center,
Jack Calderwood at one guard, and
Bob Burnett at the other.
Best Available
As far as Coach Bunn is con
cerned, that is probably the best
outfit he has available. Burnett,
newcomer to the squad this fall, has
been so effective in practice that the
maestro has given him the starting
call over Bob Zonne, leading pros
pect for the job at the start of the
season.
However, Zonne is a proven
quantity in competition, while Bur
nett is still guiltless of varsity expe
rience. He probably will play as
much of the game as Burnett, Bunn
says.
Lafaille Looks Good
Leon Lafaille, one of last year's
frosh stars, has been looking very
good in action with the first team
in place of Phil Zonne, according to
Bunn, and will get his chance to
morrow, too. In all, Bunn plans to
use at least 20 men;
On the frosh front Gorter will
present Don Williams, all-around
artist, at one forward, and Bill Mas
ters at the other. Dick Taylor, cat
like giant who surpasses even last
year's frosh star, Tom Siebert, in
height will play at center, with Bob
Stone and Bill Rumbley at guards.
Rumbley, 6 feet 5, with Taylor will
give a tremendous height average to
an out-of-the-ordinary team.
Ed DcMoss Stars
Pressing Rumbley for the starting
job, and definitely a possible starter
instead, is Ed DeMoss. Unknown at
the start, DeMoss has zoomed up
ward remarkably to threaten for a
first-string position.
Monday night in the pavilion the
varsity will tangle with the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco in the first
contest of the year with outside com
petition. Little is known of the
Winged O squad, which is com
posed of coast college hoop stars of
previous years.
San Jose, Tuesday
Tuesday night the varsity travels
to San Jose State in its last game
before the intersectional tour, which
starts December 20 against Univer
sity of Arizona at Tucson. The
Spartans gave the first string Stan
fords a vicious battle for the first
half last year, and went into the in
termission with a narrow lead. They
collapsed in the second half before
too much power.
The intersectional tour will con
sist of four other games besides the
Arizona tiIt—C.C.N.Y. and L.I.U. in
New York. T mple in Philadelphia
and Duquesne in Cleveland. Tin
team will leave for home January 2

newcomer to the squad this fall, has
been so effective in practice that the
maestro has given him the starting
call over Bob Zonne, leading pros
pect for the job at the start of the
season.
However, Zonne is a proven
quantity in competition, while Bur
nett is still guiltless of varsity expe
rience. He probably will play as
much of the game as Burnett, Bunn
says.
Lafaille Looks Good
Leon Lafaille, one of last year's
frosh stars, has been looking very
good in action with the first team
in place of Phil Zonne, according to
Bunn, and will get his chance to
morrow, too. In all, Bunn plans to
use at least 20 men;
On the frosh front Gorter will
present Don Williams, all-around
artist, at one forward, and Bill Mas
ters at the other. Dick Taylor, cat
like giant who surpasses even last
year's frosh star, Tom Siebert, in
height will play at center, with Bob
Stone and Bill Rumbley at guards.
Rumbley, 6 feet 5, with Taylor will
give a tremendous height average to
an out-of-the-ordinary team.
Ed DcMoss Stars
Pressing Rumbley for the starting
job, and definitely a possible starter
instead, is Ed DeMoss. Unknown at
the start, DeMoss has zoomed up
ward remarkably to threaten for a
first-string position.
Monday night in the pavilion the
varsity will tangle with the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco in the first
contest of the year with outside com
petition. Little is known of the
Winged O squad, which is com
posed of coast college hoop stars of
previous years.
San Jose, Tuesday
Tuesday night the varsity travels
to San Jose State in its last game
before the intersectional tour, which
starts December 20 against Univer
sity of Arizona at Tucson. The
Spartans gave the first string Stan
fords a vicious battle for the first
half last year, and went into the in
termission with a narrow lead. They
collapsed in the second half before
too much power.
The intersectional tour will con
sist of four other games besides the
Arizona tiIt—C.C.N.Y. and L.I.U. in
New York. T mple in Philadelphia
and Duquesne in Cleveland. Tin
team will leave for home January 2

□all season for both varsity and |

tomorrow afternoon, when Coach |
John Bunn's technique demonstra- i
tion by the varsity will precede the
annual frosh-varsity contest.
The demonstration, set for 3
a'clock, has been planned by Coach
Bunn with the view of explaining
some of the fundamentals of the
system in use at Stanford. An un
derstanding of these fundamentals
by fans will help them in enjoying
both varsity and freshman games
throughout the season, Bunn feels.
Students Invited
All students are cordially invited
to visit the pavilion for the affair.
Also in attendance will be bay re
gion high school coaches and teams
interested in analyzing Coach Bunn's
methods.
Immediately following the dem
onstration the Crimson Giants will
take on Coach Wytze Gorter's frosh
five in the first real competitive test
of the year for both outfits.
How seriously both coaches take
the game is reflected in the starting
line-ups posted yesterday. For the
varsity there will open Captain Hank
Luisetti at one forward, Phil Zonne
at the other, Art Stoefen at center,
Jack Calderwood at one guard, and
Bob Burnett at the other.
