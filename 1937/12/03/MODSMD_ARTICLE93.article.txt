# Frosh Tank Event Won By Vitousek
## '41 Phenomenon Takes Easy Lead in First Of Swimming Series 
### 
Roy Vitousek clipped off a 50-yard
free-style in 25 seconds flat yester
day to take the lead after the first
event of the annual freshman
swimming competition.
Frank Weeden was second, Bruce
Jessup third, and Jim Sherman
fourth.
Vitousek's time was phenomenal
for any time of the year and was es
pecially outstanding for such an
informal early season meet. The
Stanford-California freshman record
of 24:8 hasn't been approached in
11 years.
The times of the other thi-ec
point-winners were all good enough
to win a California frosh meet.
The first four finishers received
5, 3, 2, and 1 points respectively to
be added to their totals next week.
The three high aggregates will be
awarded prizes. Approximately 1G
freshmen turned out and took part
in the first event. Varsity water
polo men under Coach Nort Thorn
j ton are handling the details of the
| competition. The frosh rest today
i but will swim one event a day from
Monday through Friday of next
week.
