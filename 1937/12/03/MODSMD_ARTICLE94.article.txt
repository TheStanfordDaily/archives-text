# SIDELINE SLANTS
## GREAT NEWS! LAST SLANTS OF QUARTER 
### 
This is positively the last time this
quarter that the half dozen readers
of Slants and, of course, Mr. Art
Cohn and Mr. Dick Toner, will be
bothered with the energy-wasting
motion of throwing this portion of
the Daily into the waste basket.
This has been an interesting
quarter ... it has been pretty
peaceful from my point of view
except for the three blasts at
Toner, the Daily Cal sports edi
tor, and the one blasting of Cohn,
sports mogul of the Oakland Trib
une.
