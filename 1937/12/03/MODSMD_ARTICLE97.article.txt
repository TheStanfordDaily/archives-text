# INDIAN BOOTERS FIGHT FOR SECOND PLACE
## 
### 
California has already won the
intercollegiate soccer conference
title, despite the play-off between
the Cards and the Bears tomorrow.
That play-off tomorrow is just to
settle the Card-Bear series and does
not count in the conference stand
ings.
Stanford is in second place with
one more game to play—against
• lie third place U.S.F. Dons. A
loss for the Indian hooters will
put the Dons in a tie for second
place with Harry Maloney's men.
San Jose State's strong eleven
landed in fourth place with San
Mateo J. C. trailing in fifth place.
It was an exceptionally strong
league this year with not one
walk-away victory for any team.
