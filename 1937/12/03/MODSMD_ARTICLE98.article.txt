# NEW WATER POLO FASHION SET BY DAILY
## 
### 
I haven't as yet completely re
covered from that titanic struggle
in the depths of Encina Pool Wed
nesday afternoon. It was a great
fight from start to finish with the
Daily sports writers having the ad
vantage over the managers in having
more water wings, life savers, and
life preservers. The boys really set
a new fashion in the latest water
polo toggery, besides drawing up a
new list of rules.
See you again next quarter—
