# F.R. States New Reforms In Message
## Congressional Address Urges Enactment Of New Reform Laws 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt told Congress
today that the 1938-39 budget can
not be balanced, disclosed new plans
to attack monopolists and business
abuses, and called for prompt enact
ment of his recovery-reform pro
gram, including a wages-hours bill.
Cheers, applause, and rebel yells
greeted Mr. Roosevelt as he appeared
in the House chamber and read his
4,000-word message on the "state of
the union" which put the second reg
ular session of the Seventy - fifth
Congress to work.
Contrary to earlier reports which
whetted interest abroad, the presi
dent devoted only nine paragraphs
to world unrest. He restated this
nation's desire for peace and fore
cast the likelihood of an expanded
navy building program by warning
that all peace-loving countries must
be strong enough to force peaceful
solution of conflicts which threaten
civilization. He added that "we must
keep ourselves adequately strong in
self-defense."
He was equally frank in discussing
domestic problems. He bitterly as
sailed a small minority of business
men whom he accused of seeking to
thwart New Deal objectives. He
attacked monopolists and financial
domination by the few. He rejected
substitution of the dole for' works
relief, and proclaimed that there will
be no retreat from New Deal ob
jectives and principle.
