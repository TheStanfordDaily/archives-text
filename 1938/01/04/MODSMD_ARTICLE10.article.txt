# Work Pushed By B.A.C. On Mural Field
## Masters Predicts Early Project Completion; Three Fields Planned 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Newest addition to the Farm's
athletic plant, an intramural play
ing field, yesterday was reported to
be approximately half completed,
by Graduate Manager Alfred
Masters.
Authorized at the last meeting of
the Board of Athletic Control on De
cember 10, the new field will cost
an estimated $1783. Construction
began in mid-December, and will
be completed about the fifteenth of
this month.
The field will contain three touch
football fields covered by natural
grass turf. When it is completed all
outdoor intramural sports will be
scheduled there, according to Harry
Wolters, director of intramural
sports.
Seats Withheld
Only 2100 seats may be available
for students at this season's basket
ball games, the board also decided.
The graduate manager was author
ized to withhold up to 500 of the
Pavilion's seats for sale to the gen
eral publish.
In the past, all seats have been
offered the students at advance
sales, and remaining tickets used for
general distribution. M&in reason
for the change is to make more tick
ets for important games available to
alumni, according to Masters.
The old system also was said to
be wasteful, because many students
took reserved tickets for free games,
and then failed to attend. Masters
estimated that attendance last year
was approximately 60 per cent of
the tickets reserved.
Finals Conflict
That playoffs for the Pacific Coast
Conference basketball championship
occur at almost the same time as
Stanford final examinations, caused
the board some concern. Last year
the three-game series was postponed
until spring quarter, which, the
board thought, caused some loss of
interest in the games. The matter
was referred to the Faculty Athletic
Committee.
A proposed appropriation of be
tween $6000 or $7000 for recondi
tioning the varsity tennis courts was
referred to the finance subcommit
tee, which will report at the next
meeting to the board, January 13.
