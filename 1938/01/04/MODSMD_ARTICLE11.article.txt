# 'Pic' Pictures Farm Students
## 
### 
Several Stanfordites were sur
prised last week to find their pic
tures in the January issue of the
magazine Pic—part of a four-page
comparison of football week-ends
at Stanford and at Yale.
Three other Stanford students —
John Rice, Dave Botsford, and Mel
Jacoby — had their surprise two
weeks earlier when they received a
fat check and word that their pic
tures had been accepted.
One of the pictures showed a stu
dent-loaded touring car. The caption
explained that liquor is forbidden
on the Farm and that here was a
group of student starting out to a
roadhouse down the highway.
A sidelight came to light yester
day when it was learned that a
local woman was shocked to find
her own daughtei*, a Paly high
school student, in the picture. In
vestigation revealed that the party
was going to a Palo Alto restaurant
for a cup of hot chocolate when the
picture was taken.
