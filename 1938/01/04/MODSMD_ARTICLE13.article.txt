# OLD HEADLINES AND NEW HOPES

### 

A NEW YEAR has come again, leaving behind disasters, squabbles, kidnapings, murders and the human
frailties and quirks that make the news. From the Mattson kidnap case at the start of the year through the
major news stories of 1937 the headlines above tell the passing of another year. A good year, or a bad year
it's all in the point of veiw. And the four charming young women shown throwing up their hands in
glee at the arrival of 1938 at least give an indication that 1938 is shaping up well.
