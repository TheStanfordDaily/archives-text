# Phi Psi Fire Fails To Phase Firemen
## 
### 
The Stanford stalwart smoke
swishers had only one fire call to
mar the otherwise peaceful Yule
tide holidays.
An upstairs study room of the Phi
Psi house was the scene of the
conflagration which was reportedly
started by a lighted cigarette left
in a davenport. The davenport and
other room furnishings were ruined
by the flames, but the room itself
was not damaged badly.
The blaze occurred the day before
Christmas. Chief Dugan, when
asked whether the fire squad had
any difficulty with the blaze, said,
"We never have any trouble; Happy
New Year!"
