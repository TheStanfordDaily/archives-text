Secretaries in the Administration
Building were jolted yesterday when
two students each pushed $115 in
small change across the counter for
their tuition â€”one in silver dollars,
the other in one dollar bills.
Pampered by their usual fare of
checks and large-size currency, the
clerks wouldn't accept the silver dol
lars. "Go upstairs to the cashier's
office," they ordered. He left, with
his satchel of silver.
Tuition lines stood still for ten
minutes while the other youth pulled
rolls of bills out of various pockets.
"I just saved it up little by little,"
he said.
The cashier's office, perhaps sens
ing the approach of a new fad, was
good-naturedly ruffled. "I never
saw anyone pay that way before,"
said one clerk. She has been here 13
years.
"We just accepted the small change
because we were so surprised," she
said. "It is probably the last time
you can get by with it."
