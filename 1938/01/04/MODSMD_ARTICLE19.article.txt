the Snow Warming Up to Clara
Bow" the best of 123 photographs
entered in the Sigma Delta Chi first
annual Competition in Photography.
Joe Graves, another business grad,
won $10 for submitting the best pho
tographs in both the Pictorial and
Stories -in - Pictures divisions. The

lage on the Rhine; the latter, off the
Quad of two girls smoking between
classes.
Dick Lyon's shot of two Mexican I
peons in the basket market at To
luea, Mexico, won $5 for him as best
in the News and Action division.

"Stanford photographers have
come a long way in the past five
years," said David Keeble, Palo Alto
photo - supply merchant who fur
nished $25 (n merchandise for the
prizes. Keeble helped four other
photography experts judge the com
petition.
All entries were publicly displayed
in the Nitery the last week of au
tumn quarter, where an estimated
750 students viewed and commented
upon them. They will be returned to
their owners this week at Keeble's,
323 University Avenue.
I Raymond B. Collerd, president of
| the San Francisco Photographic So
\ ciety and one of the judges, found
most of the entries "lacking in com
position technique."
"Stanford photographers have ex- j

| hibited excellent knowledge of both j
the artistic and mechanical .sides of |
picture - taking and printing," he |
said. "They haven't, however, mas- |
tered the simple principles of com- j
position. Most of them stuck their I
points of interest smack in the cen- I
ter of the picture. Bad, very bad. A '
little intelligent cropping would j
have helped nearly every picture j
here."
Among the score of photos award- j
[ sd honorable mention were the pic- j
tures of Alec Brownstein, Easton j
I Rothwell, Ed Bowley, Adrien An
| derson, Howard Roberts, and Jean
Sheriff.
