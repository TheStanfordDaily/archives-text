# Stanford Inaugurates New Dial Exchange
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
Familiar Stanford telephone numbers are no longer located in the
basement of the Graduate School of Business, following the beginning of
operation last Friday afternoon of the new University dial exchange.
Numbers on campus formerly reached through the Administration
Building exchange, number 6161, and the Board of Athletic Control ex-

â™¦change, number 4181, have been re
vised and will now be reached
through the new board, which is
listed as Palo Alto 9411.
Chief characteristic of the new
service now in effect is that al) in
ter-office calls are to be dialed and
will go directly from one local tele
phone to the other without being
handled at the main switchboard.
Dial Explained
For Palo Alto and long distance
j calls, users of the new board must
j dial zero (operator) and ask the
' number desired. Outside calls, un-
I like inter-office communications,
I can be ti'ansferred from one local
number to another by moving the
receiver hook slowly up and down
and stating the required change to
the operator.
Installed as a private branch ex
change, leased Isy the University
j from the telephone company, the
I new service applies only to Univer
| sity and B.A.C. phones. Service to
j men's and women's halls through
1 Toyon exchange number 3121, which
j has been criticized intermittently by
| students as "ineffiicent," will not be
j affected by the new board, it is em-
I phasized.
Check-up Continued
University officials under the di
rection of Assistant Comptroller
E. S. Erwin are continuing a check
up of 3121 service begun last fall,
and are expected to announce their
recommendations in the near future.
A temporary directory listing
j changed numbers reached by the
1 new exchange has been issued by
I the University, pending the publica-
I tion of Ihe Winter Quarter Direc
j tory. which will have the new num-
I! hers arranged by departments.
