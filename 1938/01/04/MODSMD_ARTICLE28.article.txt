minutes after Leon Lafaille, soph sub
for Hank, rallied his mates with
three quick field goals.

last year 011 the eastern tour, pulled off the upset it approached in !!).'{(»

by nosing out the Indians 35-31 De
cember 30 in Philadelphia. A val
ant last half rally left Stanford stiil
short of victory, but they more than
made it up against Duquesne in
Cleveland January 1, 92-27.
That brings the story to the in
imitable, the incomparable Captain
Angelo Luisetti, who topped off his
second trip to the Atlantic seaboard
in that Duquesne massacre with a
new national intercollegiate scoring
record, 50 points in 37 minutes.
Another Title
After yielding scoring honors in
both New York contests —with City
College and Long Island U. — to
lanky Art Stoefen, Hank scoured the
Cleveland maple to take the last
scoring mark in the sport that was
n't his. Previous holder was A1
Chuckovitz of Toledo U., Akron,
who caked 41 points in a single
game last year.
Although playing second fiddle to
Stoefen in points in New York, the
Italian was the sensation on floor
play that two capacity crowds of
18.000 expected him to be.
Averages 21 Points
Lusietti averaged more than 21
points' per game on the trip, ,to lift
his varsity scoring record to 933
points. In his college career he has
tanked 1238, and is hot after the na
tional four year record of 1531.
The squad played to capacity
crowds in Tucson, twice In New
York, once In Philadelphia and in
Cleveland, a total audience of 58,467
fans. They trimmed Arizona in the
opener December 20, 44-28, before
2500. Luisetti led scorers with 12,
Calderwood was second with 10.
Two Easterners Fall
City College of New York fell be
fore the Juggernaut December 27 in
a nose-and-nose thriller, 45 - 42.
Stoefen scored 17, Luisetti 14. Two
nights later Long Island U. took its
second defeat in two years from
Stanford, 49-35, when the Cards
went wild in the last 14 minutes.
Making the jump to Philadelphia
to play Temple the next night was
too much, and the Owls staved of!
the fighting Cardinals in the final
minutes after Leon Lafaille, soph sub
for Hank, rallied his mates with
three quick field goals.
Duquesne Slaughtered
One night of rest was enough, ap
parently, for the team to get back to
its peak. Duquesne was mercilessly
slaughtered January 1, slipping be
hind 24-0 in the first 10 minutes and
scoring its. first field goal only after
14 minutes. Luisetti was too much
for the outfit, as he whipped in 23
field goals.
Phil Zonne took second scoring
honors in the Duquesne battle with
15, while Stoefen again shone with
13.
Conference competition starts
January 14 and 15 here, against
Southern California, no practice
games having been scheduled be

Stanford's varsity basketball team returns home at noon today laden
with glory from another intersectional tour —four victories in five starts
and the only defeat more than balanced by a tremendous last-game
showing.
