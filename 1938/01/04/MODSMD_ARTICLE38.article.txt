### 
SHANGHAI, Jan. 3 (UP).â€”The
reorganized Chinese government
headed by Dr. H. H. Kung embarked
tonight on a plan of merciless gue
rilla warfare as Japanese troops
drove southward from Taian in
fighting that raged along the banks
of the Wen River.
Meanwhile, the consolidated Chi
nese military machine, centralized
under Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek after the governmental shift,
struck with an airplane bombing
campaign against Nanking, China's
national capital until it was captured
by Japanese forces.
