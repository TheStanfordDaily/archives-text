# Workers Overrun Caliente Resort

### 
AGUA CALIENTE, Baja Cal.,
Jan. 3 (UP). — Barefoot children,
who flocked here with their parents
when 400 workers seized this once
swank resort, raced up and down
the luxurious corridors of the $10,—
000,000 Agua Caliente Hotel tonight.
Where the elite of society, the
wealthy and clamorous of the movie
colony, and politicians from the
United States once strolled and took
their ease, almost penniless men and
women slept in double-springed
beds, or lolled in deeply-upholstered
easy chairs.

The? vanished people of Easter
Island, 2000 miles west of Chile,
were egg-worshippers. They chose
their rulers by egg gathering con
tests, in which the winner became
king. They lived in egg-shaped
huts.
