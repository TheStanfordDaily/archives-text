# U.S. Ships Begin 'Good Will' Trip
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 (UP). â€”
Navy docks bustled today, with four
cruisers sailing on a "good neigh
bor" visit to Australia, and 12 huge
dreadnoughts leaving for a week's
gunnery drill off San Clemente Is
land.
The light, 6-inch gunned cruisers
Trenton, Memphis and Milwaukee
were scheduled to sail from San
Diego and meet the heavy 8-inch
gunned Louisville somewhere off
Los Angeles harbor. They will car
ry America's greetings to the Aus
tralian commonwealth on its sesqui
centennial.
