The Editor, Sir:
Can't something please be done
about social regulations for women?
We learn in sociology thut civiliza
tion brings restraint, but boyoboy
there is a limit even to being civ
ilized.
True, social regulations for women
are in themselves doubtless neces
sary and even beneficial. But, like
a good many good things, they caif
be overdone. It is the little tech
nical points of the regulations which
get the women down. For instance,
women driving back from vacation
Sunday night received lockouts if
they arrived at their residences even
a minute or a few secopds after
10:30 in the evening. Yet they might
have stayed out all night, signed in
the next morning, and received no
penalty at all. The regulations are
definitely inconsistent in their ef
forts to make Stanford women be
have. And in the fifth place, if
Stanford women really wanted to
misbehave, chances are they would
n't be going to Stanford.
In sororities, where women arc
given their own keys, a technical
lockout i.s given a girl who signs
ouL for a late leave and forgets her

I key, finding it necessary therefore
! to ring the bell alter closing hours.
Yet I doubt if there has ever been
a sorority house in which everyone
was gone or had retired before the
hours allotted for late leaves.
Moreover, a woman who has sign
ed out for an overnight and returns
before 2:'AO but after 12 is also locked
out, for as long a period as she
comes in after 12.
Women's Council will pay scant
attention lo a typical student gripe,
but I'm sure it is the opinion of the
majority of the women that social
regulations should be simplified to
a large degree.
