HANK IS ALL RIGHT FwR
OUR MONEY ANY DAY

Of all the well-liked and thor
oughly modest feliows on this or any
campus, Hank Luisetti stands out
above the mob. Hank, the greatest
basketball player in the country to
day and touted by many as the best
of all time, has been "on the spot"
for four years.
If there is a finer and more mod
est athlete in the country I'd like
to he shown. Hankus actually leans
over backward to be modest.
Farm sports fans will be interest
ed in a startling bit of journalistic
analysis turned in by Royal Foo,
pardon me . . . Frew, sports mogul
of the University of Washington
Daily. I'll take the liberty of quot
ing a few excerpts from Frew's tal
ented typewriter . . .

FREW THINKS LUISETTI
HAS GONE HIGH HAT

"But would you believe it, Stan
ford's ace hoop hound, Angelo Lui
setti, has become one of the glamour
boys around the circuit and has
picked up the high-sounding title,
"THE MR. Angelo Luisetti."
"Down San Francisco way, Luiset
ti's name has been listed in the jour
nalistic 'Sacred Cow' roster and the
Bay City scribes, whenever speak
ing of the Italian flash, must be sure
to include the 'MR.' and positively
the 'THE'."
That's certainly news to us, Mr.
Fooâ€”l mean Frew.
Dippy sports scrivener Harry
Press has come back from the south
land with lavish praise of the South
ern California basketball team. Ac
cording to Harry, the Trojans are
going to give John Bunn's laughing
boys plenty of trouble.
Pretzel also took a glimpse at
the U.C.L.A. quintet and states that
the pint-sized Bruins will need
stilts and ten men on the floor to
even arouse the Redskins' fighting
spirit.

BASKETEERS GIVE UP
NEW YEARS CELEBRATING

Stanford's touring basketeers
shunned the revelries of last Friday
night and the headaches of Satur
day morning to carry the Cardinal
banner to four victories out of five
on a barnstorming trip of these
United States.
Luisetti & Co. moved into Ari
zona and swept the Wildcats out
into the streets. The Bunn Boys
then moved into litle old Noo
\ ork and eked out a close win
over the obscure City College of
New York five. The following
night the Redskins repeated their
performance of last year by whip
ping Long Island University.
In the two Gotham games Center
Art Stoefen went on a rampage to
outscore Hankus Pankus and gain
top point-gathering honors.

HANK SCORES 50 POINTS
IN A SINGLE GAME

Then came the lone blotch on
Stanford's seven practice games
when the Card casaba artists drop
ped a close game to Temple, home
of Pop Warner.
Those four games were just a
warm-up for Hank, because he real
ly got down to work in the fifth
game against the hapless Duquesne
quintet. He established a new world
record when he tanked no less than
23 field goals and four free throws
for the unbelievable total of 50
points.
The final score of that game is
rather amazing. Bunn's seniors
walked off the hardwood with a
02-27 victory ,and Hank left the
game three minutes before the final
whistle. If the raven-thatched mar
vel had gone the distance he might
have boosted his scoring to 60 points
and put the Redskins over the 100
mark.
