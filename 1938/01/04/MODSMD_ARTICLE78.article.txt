## Santa Rosa, Placer Fall To Papooses Yearlings Lose Opener To Marin J. C.; Map Revenge Tilt Plans 
### 
Picking up momentum slowly
after an inauspicious start, Stan
ford's freshman cagers wound up
their Christmas barnstorming tour
with two victories in three attempts.
The yearlings dropped their open
ing game to a more experienced
Marin Junior College outfit, 47-45,
but came back with triumphs over
Santa Rosa J. C., 32-30, and Placer
J. C„ 48-32.
Against Marin, the Papooses were
ahead by six digits at the half and
with nine minutes to go had an
eleven-point advantage. However,
at this point their inexperience
caught up with them and Marin ral
lied to win the game. Bill Marshall,
pint-sized forward, garnered high
point honors with 20 digits, despite
the fact that he played hardly half
the contest.

The Santa Rosa game was "touch
and go" from the start with each
team constantly exchanging the lead.
With three minutes to go, the
Cardinals iced the game. Santa
Rosa threw away a chance to win
the game when it missed four foul
shots in the closing minutes. Dick
Taylor, giant Papoose center, took
high honors with 10 points.
Coach Wytze Gorter's proteges
took pity on his nerve-wracked con
dition after the first two thrillers
and put a smile back on his face
with an easy 48-32 triumph over a
weak Placer team. Eddie DeMoss,
lanky center, bucketed 18 points fox
leading scorer honors.

were: forwards, Don Williams, Bill
Masters, Bill Marshall, Bill Schroe
der and Stan Graff; centers, Dick
Taylor and Bill Rumbley; guards,
Eddie DeMoss, Bob Stone, Bud
Jones, Bill Niecolls and Jack All
tucker.
While the rest of the school
danced in the Women's Gym last
night, the frosh twinkle-toed around
the Pavilion under the critical eyes
of Coach Gorter.
Gorter didn't lose any time in slip
ping the yearlings back into harness
as he prepares the team for the re
turn game with Marin Junior Col
lege on Friday night. The Papooses
are out for revenge after their de
feat while on tour.
Squad Bolstered
They will also be bolstered by
several new additions to the squad,
including Don Burness, guard from
Lowell in San Francisco; Ken Dav
idson, forward from University
High, Oakland; and Tilford Denton,
a guard from Northeast High in
Kansas City, Missouri.
Other candidates battling for po
sitions on the squad are Bob Ham
lin, Kenny Kessel, Dave Simpson,
Bob Gill, Hank Hinds, Harland
Harbke, Emerson Hiler, Chuck
Boggs, and Jerry Mayer.
The team lost its game to Marin
because, instead of throwing short,
sure passes, it gambled on long ones
—and lost. Gorter will work the
squad on its short passing game for
the Marin battle.
Picking up momentum slowly
after an inauspicious start, Stan
ford's freshman cagers wound up
their Christmas barnstorming tour
with two victories in three attempts.
The yearlings dropped their open
ing game to a more experienced
Marin Junior College outfit, 47-45,
but came back with triumphs over
Santa Rosa J. C., 32-30, and Placer
J. C„ 48-32.
Against Marin, the Papooses were
ahead by six digits at the half and
with nine minutes to go had an
eleven-point advantage. However,
at this point their inexperience
caught up with them and Marin ral
lied to win the game. Bill Marshall,
pint-sized forward, garnered high
point honors with 20 digits, despite
the fact that he played hardly half
the contest.
Taylor Leads Score
The Santa Rosa game was "touch
and go" from the start with each
team constantly exchanging the lead.
With three minutes to go, the
Cardinals iced the game. Santa
Rosa threw away a chance to win
the game when it missed four foul
shots in the closing minutes. Dick
Taylor, giant Papoose center, took
high honors with 10 points.
Coach Wytze Gorter's proteges
took pity on his nerve-wracked con
dition after the first two thrillers
and put a smile back on his face
with an easy 48-32 triumph over a
weak Placer team. Eddie DeMoss,
lanky center, bucketed 18 points fox
leading scorer honors.
Travelers Listed
The 12 players making the trip
were: forwards, Don Williams, Bill
