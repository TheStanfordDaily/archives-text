WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UP).—
Senator Royal S. Copeland (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the commerce commit
tee, said today that he would press
for early action on a bill intended to
restrict Japanese invasion of Ameri
can fishing waters along the West
Coast.
It was understood that the decision
to hurry the bill also was a result of
recent protests that Japanese were
operating in fishing waters off the
American coast. The bill would
provide that fishing vessels in such
waters must be operated by crews
at least half of which are Americans.
