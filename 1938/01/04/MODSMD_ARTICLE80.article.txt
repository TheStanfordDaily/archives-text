# RADIO SENDS SCORE

### 
BOSTON, Jan. 3 (UP). â€”Science
joined art last week when the lost
score of a Jan Sibelius symphony,
duplicated by transoceanic radio
photography in the first process of
its kind in history, arrived in Boston
by train on Wednesday. The Finnish
composer's unpublished and little
known "Origin of Fire" was rushed
here from a New York music pub
lisher so it could make its American
premiere by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra last Friday night.
