Roy Vitousek is the best all- !
around swimmer in the freshman [
class. He showed his superiority by j
winning four first places and taking j
a second and a fourth in the annual
frosh competition completed just
before the holidays.
Bill Weeden not only smashed the i
existing yearling 100-yard back- !
stroke record but also placed sec- 1
ond in the combined competition, j
Weeden also won the 440-yard free
style and placed second in the 50,
100, and 220-yard events. His time
of 1:05.9 in the upside down event
whacked a full three seconds off the
late record of 1:05 fiat.
Failing to break any. records,
Vitousek barely missed tying the
old marks in both the 50 and tKe
100-yard free style. He also won the !
220 free style and the 100-yard
breast-stroke.
Weeden and Vitousek displayed
by their superiority over the rest of
the contestants that frosh aquatic
hopes will rest mainly upon them in
asmuch as they won every event in
the six-day program without too
much competition from the field.
Bruce Jessup managed to scrape
up enough points to win the show
honors and Ted Moreno was fourth.
