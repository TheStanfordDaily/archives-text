# Surprise Move Lifts Silver Price
## 
### 
, LONDON, Jan. 3 (UP).â€”A sur
prise bear-covering movement lifted
silver prices today in the face of the
United States action in lowering its
price for newly mined domestic
metal by presidential decree last
Friday.
While the covering was not heavy,
it was sufficient to absorb offerings
and to allow bullion dealers to fix
the price at the usual time.
