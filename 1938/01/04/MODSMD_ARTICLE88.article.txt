# Grid Rules See Few Changes
## 
### 
EDGEWATER PARK, Miss., Jan.
3 (UP). â€”Few changes to existing
football rules were indicated today
after the first day of a two-day meet
ing of the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association rules committee.
There were two suggestions from
the Football Coaches' Association,
which with the NCAA completed
conventions last week in New Or
leans. The coaches' committee,
headed by Lou Little of Columbia,
wanted the ball to be placed 15 yards
in from the sidelines instead of 10
yards when the ball goes out of
bounds or is downed closer than 15
yards to the sideline.
Little also asked that if a forward
pass behind the line of scrimmage
inadvertently touched an ineligible
man it be ruled an incompleted pass

and counted one dnwn. Interpreta
tion was asked of "intentionally
grounding a forward pass."
Although the coaches have nothing
to do with rule-making, their sug
gestions are usually followed.
The rules committee, meeting at
the Edgewater Gulf Hotel, was due
to make its report today.
