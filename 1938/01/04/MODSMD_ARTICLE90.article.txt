## Here We Go Again 
### 
AS The Daily's sticky gears creak and grum
ble and begin to shake off the mire of a
month's layoff, and the rattle of typewriters in
the outer office and the backshop buzzer tell us
that another lap of publication is started, we
barricade ourselves in the little inner sanctum
sanctorum and look up at the Greyhound cal
endar and Jorgi's dream of the Nitery and a
couple of Thompson's • cartoons and let the
editorial windmills begin to turn again.
To the chance observer all this whirring and
turning is just tomorrow's Daily coming out,
and to many an observer the fact that tomor
row's Daily is coming out may not even be
worth consideration.
But the publication of a paper following a
month's layoff can produce more mental an
guish for the handful of trusties that grind out
Stanford's spasmodic daily than the casual ob
server would guess.
Minds grown unaccustomed to headline

writing, to news gathering and writing, sud
denly are called upon to snap back into form.
A night editor whips back to an efficiency built
up over a period of several weeks.
Copy readers must recall headline jargon
long left idle. Proof readers maintain a doubled
vigil to hold proof butches to a minimum
(though sometimes you wouldn't guess it). The
back shop must recapture the "feel" of slapping
four pages of type into the forms by 12 o'clock—
with the edits late. Every job requires double
effort.
Not often do Daily editorials compliment
Daily personnel. But with this return to publi
cation, tradition may be set aside, in order that
these people in the outside office who are ap
plying extra effort to turn a bunch of rusty gears
may get their due.
This morning The Daily is back again. Little
will the campus know that last night there was
a world revolution.
