ACCORDING to an item on the front page
today, the B.A.C.'s gift to intramural sport,
though hardly wrapped in colored paper ready
for delivery, is at least half completed.
That is rather snappy work, since the pro
posal for a field solely for intramural use was
still in one of the Board's subcommittees when
The Daily last was deposited on campus door
steps. Appropriation of money and partial con
struction have come since that time:
Mural now may be on the new field by spring
quarter, and have an early chance to continue
the rapid, though low-pressure, rate of growth
it has maintained in the last few years.
But speed is not the only commendable as
pect of the Board's action. The apparent reason
for any action at all is also encouraging.
Intramural seems to be one of the few ama
teur "amateur sports" left on college athletic
curricula. Football, especially the post-season
variety, in many instances can no longer qualify.
Recognition of this seemed implicit in the

Board's action. And the Board seemed to agree
that football could at least help support a pro
gram for the boys who play for the fun of it. â€”
