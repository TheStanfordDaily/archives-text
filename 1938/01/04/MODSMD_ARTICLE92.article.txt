r | I IIE engineer on this train, I am sure got his
early experience shaking cocktails, and has re
verted to type. Two scats up the car, a very inter
esting flirtation is progressing toward the giggling
stage. The boy across the aisle has been working
on a letter for two hours. He just dropped a bit of
scratch paper. On it was written "lovlyest—love-
Icyest—lovieliest."
And in the midst of all this true love not running
smooth, Bull Session for Tuesday, January 4, 19158,
is gradually evolving with a suitcase for its lied,
and the scenery—two cows and a mountain—for
its inspiration.
