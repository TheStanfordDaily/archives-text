# BULL SESSION FOR JANUARY 4, 1938
## 
### 
Christmas vacation fades off toward memory's
horizon, critics of education begin their annual
debate over what the students get out of the holiday.
In this argument, as in most, pessimists and optimists
face each other from opposite sides, catapulting pithy
adjectives and turning neat but not gaudy phrases on
a mass production basis. The pessimists follow in
the grand American tradition which holds that the
world is proceeding toward complete damnation at a
rate equal to the square of the speed of the younger
generation. At night they read Schopenhauer and
"Challenge to Liberty," and in the morning they grab
for the burnt piece of toast so that they can grumble
about it.
This school of thought paints the returning under
graduates in colors that would terrify a surrealist.
It holds that the student crawls back to the arms of
dear alma mater like a prodigal son who wound up
nursing a particularly low-caste bunch of swine. It
credits him with three weeks cumulative hangovers.
And it points to him like a dowager pointing to a cock
roach and says, "See—vacation has ruined him. He's
dissipated.' And after delivering this sweet message
the pessimists go oil to gloat over the stock market
slump.

At the other extreme are the optimists, gentle,
beaming men who believe in miracles and Roosevelt.
They picture the post Christmas student as a walking
power house, ready to leap afresh into pursuit of
knowledge. They see a character as rigorous as
though he had just stepped out of an oatmeal ad,
strong enough to split infinitives all day without tiring.
And in the midst of this crackpot tempest the stu
dent returns looking amazingly like he did when he
left.

r | I IIEIiE is, of course, a minor psychological differ
ence which might give the Freudians something to
talk about. Any Peace-on-Earth-Good-Will-toward-
Men that was not put away with the Christmas tree
ornaments can usually be counted upon to conflict
with reg day proceedings. Fighting railroad porters
and unscrambling time, schedules fosters an attitude
that doesn t. quite jibe with the lingering traces of
Christmas spirit.
And then there are usually disturbing memories of
fluffy heads and laughing eyes which make it a bit
hard to concentrate on the love life of mere amoebae.
But these are only minor problems and vanish in the
nasty jolt you get when you see the grade on your
first exam of the quarter.

Outside of such small alterations, the returning
student i.s retnaikably like the vacationbound one. No
man has been seen staggering up the Quad; and there
are no bodies in the street where exhausted wrecks
have collapsed.
Contrariwise, the way registration lines moved
hardly indicated an exportable surplus of energy;
and we have received no reports of students who
couldn't wait for classes to begin.
I hesitate to expose this conclusion to the devastat
ing comment of the logic professors. But it does look
as though a student can survive a vacation without
being completely remodeled and put under a new
management.

as though a student can survive a vacation without
being completely remodeled and put under a new

Christmas vacation fades off toward memory's
horizon, critics of education begin their annual
debate over what the students get out of the holiday.
In this argument, as in most, pessimists and optimists
face each other from opposite sides, catapulting pithy
adjectives and turning neat but not gaudy phrases on
a mass production basis. The pessimists follow in
the grand American tradition which holds that the
world is proceeding toward complete damnation at a
rate equal to the square of the speed of the younger
generation. At night they read Schopenhauer and
"Challenge to Liberty," and in the morning they grab
for the burnt piece of toast so that they can grumble
about it.
This school of thought paints the returning under
graduates in colors that would terrify a surrealist.
It holds that the student crawls back to the arms of
dear alma mater like a prodigal son who wound up
nursing a particularly low-caste bunch of swine. It
credits him with three weeks cumulative hangovers.
And it points to him like a dowager pointing to a cock
roach and says, "See—vacation has ruined him. He's
dissipated.' And after delivering this sweet message
the pessimists go oil to gloat over the stock market
slump.

At the other extreme are the optimists, gentle,
beaming men who believe in miracles and Roosevelt.
They picture the post Christmas student as a walking
power house, ready to leap afresh into pursuit of
knowledge. They see a character as rigorous as
though he had just stepped out of an oatmeal ad,
strong enough to split infinitives all day without tiring.
And in the midst of this crackpot tempest the stu
dent returns looking amazingly like he did when he
left.

r | I IIEIiE is, of course, a minor psychological differ
ence which might give the Freudians something to
talk about. Any Peace-on-Earth-Good-Will-toward-
Men that was not put away with the Christmas tree
ornaments can usually be counted upon to conflict
with reg day proceedings. Fighting railroad porters
and unscrambling time, schedules fosters an attitude
that doesn t. quite jibe with the lingering traces of
Christmas spirit.
And then there are usually disturbing memories of
fluffy heads and laughing eyes which make it a bit
hard to concentrate on the love life of mere amoebae.
But these are only minor problems and vanish in the
nasty jolt you get when you see the grade on your
first exam of the quarter.

Outside of such small alterations, the returning
student i.s retnaikably like the vacationbound one. No
man has been seen staggering up the Quad; and there
are no bodies in the street where exhausted wrecks
have collapsed.
Contrariwise, the way registration lines moved
hardly indicated an exportable surplus of energy;
and we have received no reports of students who
couldn't wait for classes to begin.
I hesitate to expose this conclusion to the devastat
ing comment of the logic professors. But it does look
