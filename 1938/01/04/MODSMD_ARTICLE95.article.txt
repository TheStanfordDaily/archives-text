City Music Hall program last Sunday, was the death
December 28 of Maurice Ravel. To musicians, this
death denoted the loss of one of the foremost modern
composers; to the peepul, the passing of the author of
"Bolero."

It sometimes happens, to the vexation of a com
poser (or other artist as well), that he is known by
one work only—sometimes a work which he considers
unimportant. Such is the case of Sergei Rachmaninoff,
who, if he can get through a program without playing
his "Prelude in C Sharp Minor," considers himself a
mighty lucky man. No wonder he looks dour. So
would you if you knew that, sure as death and taxes,
you were going to be forced by fawning audiences to
hammer away at a piece of music that you wished you
had never written.

The case of Maurice Ravel and his "Bolero" is not
quite as poisonous. But of classical music, the "Bolero"
is probably as well known to John Public as any piece
of music ever written. Whether this popularity with
the peepul is a compliment or a slander may be a ques
tion. But as a pure work of composition, it could stand
alone, popular or not.
Ravel did something which is so logical that one
wonders why it was never done before—or perhaps it
was, but never in such masterly fashion. It is obvious
that one of the easiest ways in which to achieve variety
and climax in music is by changes in key. And Ravel
carried this principle to the furthest extreme in "Bo
lero." Taking an old Basque melody, repeating it over
and over, relying on the different tonal qualities of the
instruments for variety, and the insistant rhythm for
suspense; he never changes key until the last few
measures. And the single change carries a pile-driver
punch which releases all the pent-up energy in one
dramatic blaze. A real stroke of showmanship—if not
of genius.

AVEL, in working with a Spanish subject, is simi
lar to many French composers. One immediately
thinks of Bizet's 'Carmen," as the most outstanding
example of this observation. Debusy, too, wrote an
"Iberia" suite, and other French composers have been
fascinated with the color and rhythm of Spanish mel
ody. Ravel's "Bolero" was not his only manifestation
of this fascination, for his "Rhapsodic Espanole" is
nearly as well known as the "Bolero."

He was a modernist—even once criticized as the
writer of "dangerous and anarchist" music, but cer
tainly not of the Stravinsky wing of modern music.
Rather, his works remind one of those of Debussy.
His piano compositions, and his music for small en
sembles, particularly, have the delicate, impression
istic style which is associated with Debussy's name.
Almost typically "French" (if there is such a thing)
was his music—methodical and precise; brilliant and
fiery; and yet delicate and charming.

Ravel will never be revered like the three B's—
Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, nor idolized like Wag
ner. But, unlike those others, through one stroke of
genius, he will live in the minds of shop-girls as well
as the intelligentsia through the bumpty-bump of a
Spanish dance—the "Bolero." Which may demonstrate
that rhythm—they call it swing nowadays—is the
thing after all.

lero." Taking an old Basque melody, repeating it over
and over, relying on the different tonal qualities of the
instruments for variety, and the insistant rhythm for
suspense; he never changes key until the last few
measures. And the single change carries a pile-driver
punch which releases all the pent-up energy in one
dramatic blaze. A real stroke of showmanship—if not
of genius.

AVEL, in working with a Spanish subject, is simi
lar to many French composers. One immediately
thinks of Bizet's 'Carmen," as the most outstanding
example of this observation. Debusy, too, wrote an
"Iberia" suite, and other French composers have been
fascinated with the color and rhythm of Spanish mel
ody. Ravel's "Bolero" was not his only manifestation
of this fascination, for his "Rhapsodic Espanole" is
nearly as well known as the "Bolero."

He was a modernist—even once criticized as the
writer of "dangerous and anarchist" music, but cer
tainly not of the Stravinsky wing of modern music.
Rather, his works remind one of those of Debussy.
His piano compositions, and his music for small en
sembles, particularly, have the delicate, impression
istic style which is associated with Debussy's name.
Almost typically "French" (if there is such a thing)
was his music—methodical and precise; brilliant and
fiery; and yet delicate and charming.

Ravel will never be revered like the three B's—
Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, nor idolized like Wag
ner. But, unlike those others, through one stroke of
genius, he will live in the minds of shop-girls as well
as the intelligentsia through the bumpty-bump of a
Spanish dance—the "Bolero." Which may demonstrate
that rhythm—they call it swing nowadays—is the
thing after all.

City Music Hall program last Sunday, was the death
December 28 of Maurice Ravel. To musicians, this
death denoted the loss of one of the foremost modern
composers; to the peepul, the passing of the author of
"Bolero."

It sometimes happens, to the vexation of a com
poser (or other artist as well), that he is known by
one work only—sometimes a work which he considers
unimportant. Such is the case of Sergei Rachmaninoff,
who, if he can get through a program without playing
his "Prelude in C Sharp Minor," considers himself a
mighty lucky man. No wonder he looks dour. So
would you if you knew that, sure as death and taxes,
you were going to be forced by fawning audiences to
hammer away at a piece of music that you wished you
had never written.

The case of Maurice Ravel and his "Bolero" is not
quite as poisonous. But of classical music, the "Bolero"
is probably as well known to John Public as any piece
of music ever written. Whether this popularity with
the peepul is a compliment or a slander may be a ques
tion. But as a pure work of composition, it could stand
alone, popular or not.
Ravel did something which is so logical that one
wonders why it was never done before—or perhaps it
was, but never in such masterly fashion. It is obvious
that one of the easiest ways in which to achieve variety
and climax in music is by changes in key. And Ravel
carried this principle to the furthest extreme in "Bo
lero." Taking an old Basque melody, repeating it over
and over, relying on the different tonal qualities of the
instruments for variety, and the insistant rhythm for
suspense; he never changes key until the last few
measures. And the single change carries a pile-driver
