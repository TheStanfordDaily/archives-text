# New Lombard Movie Proves Good Comedy
## 
### 
Busy as the proverbial bee right
! now, Carole Lombard is making
movies right and left, bringing to
each her peculiarly efficient flair
for likeable dumbness. First of these
j recent efforts to reach Paly screens
is "True Confession," playing for the
last time tonight at the Stanford.
In this mad mystery, in which the
j murder is quite incidental, Miss

Lombard plays a
well-meaning but
untruthful wife to
the harassed and
struggling young
lawyer of Fred
Mac Murray,
Somehow the
truth never man
ages to find its
way to Miss Lom- '
bard's lips, with

i the result that she gets herself I
j charged with a murder she did not '
commit, almost gets electrocuted for ■
it, and in general upsets the law, her \
husband, herself, and the public in j
general.
Complications begin when she ex- !
j plains to a bill-collector her hus- I
i band's mad passion for her type- '
I writer, and continues until the lie
1 which the movies, with pretty coy
i ness, lead you to suspect will be her
j last.
Fred Mac Murray and Una Merkel i
| offer expert support in the roles they i
j are given, but the real surprise of i
! the film is John Barrymore, com
i plete with gestures, turning in a per
formance which takes one back to j
the days of "Topaze" and "Twentieth
Century." Charlie Jasper, his bal- j
loon, and his theme music will prob- !
ably linger much longer in the minds
of theater-goers than will the antics '
of Miss Lombard and her cast, pleas- !
ing as those are.
* * *
"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry," sec- j
ond feature on the bill, introduces |
M-G-M's latest English juvenile, j
Ronald Sinclair, who might just as |
well have been left at home. Judy i
Garland, Mickey Rooney, Sophie |
Tucker,' and C. Aubrey Smith do
the best they can with a plot full
of every single stock situation and
cliche in the book.

formance which takes one back to j
the days of "Topaze" and "Twentieth
Century." Charlie Jasper, his bal- j
loon, and his theme music will prob- !
ably linger much longer in the minds
of theater-goers than will the antics '
of Miss Lombard and her cast, pleas- !
ing as those are.

"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry," sec- j
ond feature on the bill, introduces |
M-G-M's latest English juvenile, j
Ronald Sinclair, who might just as |
well have been left at home. Judy i
Garland, Mickey Rooney, Sophie |
Tucker,' and C. Aubrey Smith do
the best they can with a plot full
of every single stock situation and
cliche in the book.
