# Enlargement Of Hospital Advocated
## $175,000 Bond Issue To Finance New Unit Suggested to Council 
### 
Probability that a special election
on a proposed $175,000 bond issue,
for construction of an 80-bed addi
tion to the Palo Alto Hospital, will
be called by the city council next
Monday night was indicated yester
day by council members.
The addition, which would double
the capacity of the seven-year-old
institution, was recommended to
the council last month by its spe
cial hospital committee.
Councilman E. C. Thoits, chair
man of the special committee, said
yesterday the proposal is "a worthy
project." The hospital, he said, is
in good condition and he believes
the addition would be self-liquidat
ing, yith no need for taxation.
The plan would be to construct a
four-story addition, including pri
vate rooms, wards of two to ten
beds, and a segregated section for
obstetrical cases. The wing would
be on the southeast side of the pres
ent structure.
Student Unit Urged
In a sub-committee report by Er
nest Erwin, assistant comptroller of
Stanford, and L. Harold Anderson,
deputy city engineer, Mr. Erwin
suggested that the lower, or ground
floor, could advantageously be used
for students requiring isolation and
rest, but not expensive nursing
care. This would utilize a usually
waste "basement" area.
Mr. Erwin's suggestion is in line
with a recommendation made by
Dr. Thomas E. Storey, medical ad
viser of men, last quarter that a
separate hospital unit be provided
for students. He urged that such
infirmary facilities be provided par
ticularly. to care for the semi-annual
peaks of respiratory cases among
students.
Ward Is Ready
Although the addition would not
be completed before the spring of
1939, the campus isolation ward is
prepared to handle cases this year.
However, Dr. Storey believes a hos
pital unit would be preferable, not
only because equipment would be
immediately available, but because
it would eliminate congestion.
Total cost of the proposed wing
would be $222,000, of which all over
the bond issue probably would come
from earnings. The bond issue would
cover the cost of the building and
the remaining expenditure would
be for beds and equipment, not all
of which would have to be supplied
at once.
Planned for Expansion
The committee pointed out the
kitchen, laboratory, X-ray appa
ratus and boiler room of the present
hospital were made large enough to
provide for additions.
Floor plans for the addition at
present are in a preliminary stage,
with some contending suggestions as
to arrangement of private rooms and
wards on the first three floors.
Mayor Byrl R. Salsman said yes
terday that "as an individual coun
cilman, I am going to vote in favor
of submitting the bond proposal to
the people. I am personally in favor
of the addition and of passage of
the bonds."
Others in Favor
Councilmen Earl C. Thomas,
Granville Wood, physician, and
Thoits, also indicated they would
vote in favor of the bond election.
Council woman Frances Merner was
a member of the hospital committee
which submitted the unanimous rec
ommendation.
Councilman E. P. Cashel reported
he has been investigating the mat
ter "and I haven't made my deci
sion."

cover the cost of the building and
the remaining expenditure would
be for beds and equipment, not all
of which would have to be supplied
at once.
Planned for Expansion
The committee pointed out the
kitchen, laboratory, X-ray appa
ratus and boiler room of the present
hospital were made large enough to
provide for additions.
Floor plans for the addition at
present are in a preliminary stage,
with some contending suggestions as
to arrangement of private rooms and
wards on the first three floors.
Mayor Byrl R. Salsman said yes
terday that "as an individual coun
cilman, I am going to vote in favor
of submitting the bond proposal to
the people. I am personally in favor
of the addition and of passage of
the bonds."
Others in Favor
Councilmen Earl C. Thomas,
Granville Wood, physician, and
Thoits, also indicated they would
vote in favor of the bond election.
Council woman Frances Merner was
a member of the hospital committee
which submitted the unanimous rec
ommendation.
Councilman E. P. Cashel reported
he has been investigating the mat
ter "and I haven't made my deci
sion."
Probability that a special election
on a proposed $175,000 bond issue,
for construction of an 80-bed addi
tion to the Palo Alto Hospital, will
be called by the city council next
Monday night was indicated yester
day by council members.
The addition, which would double
the capacity of the seven-year-old
institution, was recommended to
the council last month by its spe
cial hospital committee.
Councilman E. C. Thoits, chair
man of the special committee, said
yesterday the proposal is "a worthy
project." The hospital, he said, is
in good condition and he believes
the addition would be self-liquidat
ing, yith no need for taxation.
The plan would be to construct a
four-story addition, including pri
vate rooms, wards of two to ten
beds, and a segregated section for
obstetrical cases. The wing would
be on the southeast side of the pres
ent structure.
Student Unit Urged
In a sub-committee report by Er
nest Erwin, assistant comptroller of
Stanford, and L. Harold Anderson,
deputy city engineer, Mr. Erwin
suggested that the lower, or ground
floor, could advantageously be used
for students requiring isolation and
rest, but not expensive nursing
care. This would utilize a usually
waste "basement" area.
Mr. Erwin's suggestion is in line
with a recommendation made by
Dr. Thomas E. Storey, medical ad
viser of men, last quarter that a
separate hospital unit be provided
for students. He urged that such
infirmary facilities be provided par
ticularly. to care for the semi-annual
peaks of respiratory cases among
students.
Ward Is Ready
Although the addition would not
be completed before the spring of
1939, the campus isolation ward is
prepared to handle cases this year.
However, Dr. Storey believes a hos
pital unit would be preferable, not
only because equipment would be
immediately available, but because
it would eliminate congestion.
Total cost of the proposed wing
would be $222,000, of which all over
the bond issue probably would come
from earnings. The bond issue would
cover the cost of the building and
the remaining expenditure would
be for beds and equipment, not all
of which would have to be supplied
at once.
