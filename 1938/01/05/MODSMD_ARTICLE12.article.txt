# Big Game Blaze Too Hysterical, Yost Charges
## 
### 
Because Big ' Game excitement
caused "several cases of hysteria"
among Stanford women, Dean Mary
Yost has suggested to Ex Commit
tee that the bonfire be abandoned
entirely and replaced by a fireworks
display, it was revealed yesterday.
Though Ex Committeemen agreed
with the dean that the "spirit" gen
i erated Big Game week might inter
| fere with studies, they seriously
! doubted that fireworks should sub
stitute the bonfire.
Next fall, they decided, freshmen
will build the bonfire the day it is
burned. The excitement resulting
from reported Cal raids will thus be
eliminated.
Dean Yost objected to Lagunita's
bed as the firesite, but Ex Committee
tee could think of no better place.
