Yankees' baseball pitcher and star
of the 1937 World Scries, who an
nounced in Hollywood yesterday he
would seek a Reno divorce, arrived
here today.
Friends who engaged him a room
in an obscure apartment hotel, said
the baseball player wished "to
avoid publicity." Gomez spent the
day with Monte Pearson, his Yankee
pitching teammate, who is visiting
his brother, Verne Pearson, in
Reno.
