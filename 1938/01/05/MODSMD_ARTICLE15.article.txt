# F.D.R. Seeks Aid in Fight On Recession
## President Warns Labor To Initiate Reforms Before Intervention 
### 
V/ASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP). —
Close friends of President Roosevelt
said today the chief executive was
hopeful of a co-operative response
from business to his message as an
aid in fighting business recession.
The presidential source declared
reaction to the congressional mes
sage may go a long way toward
determining what the President will
say in his speech at the Jackson day
celebration Saturday night.
Meantime Roosevelt warned that
labor, as well as capital, must put
its house in order and promised that
the government will give both an
opportunity to make reform before
it intervenes.
Cites Labor War
At a press conference held 24
hours after he delivered his mes
sage, the President criticized certain
jurisdictional disputes in labor on
the Pacific Coast and condemned in
stances of high-pressure salesman
ship and unbalanced production in
industry.
Asked to clarify his statement
to Congress that labor must assume
responsibility comparable to its in
crease in power, the President said
he believed the unions were assum
ing additional responsibility as col
lective bargaining expanded.
Among "abuses" of power, he cit
ed the jurisdictional dispute among
lumber sawmill workers in the
Western States which, he said, had
gone to the extent of influencing
construction work on the eastern
seaboard.
Cites "Overselling"
Roosevelt also gave two instances
of high-pressure salesmanship and
unbalanced px-oduction.
He cited the case of an automo
bile salesman who admittedly had
"oversold" a small community, aid
ed by reports that prices would rise
sharply within 12 months. He told
of a recent conversation with a
prominent but unidentified steel
manufacturer who reported rail
roads had placed orders for a full
year's supply of rails in advance be
cause of a threatened price increase.
Result of the carrier action, the
President said, was to aid in forc
ing a drop in steel production. He
said the steel master described the
incident as "unintelligible."
When asked how the Government
could intervene in such a situation,
the chief executive pointed to busi
ness-Government co-operation un
der the old NRA.
Balance Industry
Under NRA codes, he explained,
members of an industry could sit at
a table with the Government and
with accurate statistics arrive at a
fairly acurate estimate of the Na
tion's needs in the immediate fu
ture of a given product. This re
sulted in a more evenly balanced
production.
He said he would send to Con
gress in two or three weeks his spe
cial message directed at monopolists
and at curbing unfair business prac
tices. Although he said he had had
no opportunity to study nation
wide reaction to his message of yes
terday, he was repi'esented earlier
as feeling it opened wide the door
for co-operation between honest
business and the government to aid
in combatting the trade recession.

Cites Labor War
At a press conference held 24
hours after he delivered his mes
sage, the President criticized certain
jurisdictional disputes in labor on
the Pacific Coast and condemned in
stances of high-pressure salesman
ship and unbalanced production in
industry.
Asked to clarify his statement
to Congress that labor must assume
responsibility comparable to its in
crease in power, the President said
he believed the unions were assum
ing additional responsibility as col
lective bargaining expanded.
Among "abuses" of power, he cit
ed the jurisdictional dispute among
lumber sawmill workers in the
Western States which, he said, had
gone to the extent of influencing
construction work on the eastern
seaboard.
Cites "Overselling"
Roosevelt also gave two instances
of high-pressure salesmanship and
unbalanced px-oduction.
He cited the case of an automo
bile salesman who admittedly had
"oversold" a small community, aid
ed by reports that prices would rise
sharply within 12 months. He told
of a recent conversation with a
prominent but unidentified steel
manufacturer who reported rail
roads had placed orders for a full
year's supply of rails in advance be
cause of a threatened price increase.
Result of the carrier action, the
President said, was to aid in forc
ing a drop in steel production. He
said the steel master described the
incident as "unintelligible."
When asked how the Government
could intervene in such a situation,
the chief executive pointed to busi
ness-Government co-operation un
der the old NRA.
Balance Industry
Under NRA codes, he explained,
members of an industry could sit at
a table with the Government and
with accurate statistics arrive at a
fairly acurate estimate of the Na
tion's needs in the immediate fu
ture of a given product. This re
sulted in a more evenly balanced
production.
He said he would send to Con
gress in two or three weeks his spe
cial message directed at monopolists
and at curbing unfair business prac
tices. Although he said he had had
no opportunity to study nation
wide reaction to his message of yes
terday, he was repi'esented earlier
as feeling it opened wide the door
for co-operation between honest
business and the government to aid
in combatting the trade recession.
V/ASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP). —
Close friends of President Roosevelt
said today the chief executive was
hopeful of a co-operative response
from business to his message as an
aid in fighting business recession.
The presidential source declared
reaction to the congressional mes
sage may go a long way toward
determining what the President will
say in his speech at the Jackson day
celebration Saturday night.
Meantime Roosevelt warned that
labor, as well as capital, must put
its house in order and promised that
the government will give both an
opportunity to make reform before
it intervenes.
