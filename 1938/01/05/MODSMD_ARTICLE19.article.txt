# Foot-Loose Caricaturist Draws 1000 Farm Faces
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Leonard Ward likes to travel around drawing caricatures.
I>ast quarter over a thousand Stanfordites had theirs drawn hy this
peppy little man who was staying at a Pah* Alto hotel for two weeks.
"Yes, I like the work," he used to tell students while he was scrib
bling off their portrait-insults (it takes him only three minutes to draw

one). "I don't have to stay in one#
place. I can make my money at j
some college and then dash oft' to a
big city and have a good time;
spending it."
Perhaps this is why Mr. Ward did ■
not return this week as he had
planned. However, he may yet re
visit the farm to caricature those
who couldn't break away from
studying for exams when he was j
here before.

Mr. Ward's biggest business came j
when he spent afternoons at the j
various houses and dormitories.!
Some of the fraternities have had f
profiles of all their members re- '
produced in miniature on one sheet, j
One house has such a cartoon that
was made three years ago by Mr. |
Ward.
Traveling all over the country, i
this five-foot four artist does most j
of his work at colleges. Prices vary, j
At Stanford it is 75 cents for a !
profile, but at some eastern schools
he says students would look down j
their noses unless he charged more [
than that. And at "some little cow j
college" he must drop prices. "But j
I sure don't stay there long," he j
says.
Accountant Once
It was as an accountant that Mr.
Wax*d first worked. "I always was I
good at figures," he says. His pref- !
erence now is drawing women.
During his stay in Palo Alto, stu
dents kept him busy by coming }
down to the hotel. Men he draws j
in his room. But he always meets j
women in the lobby and sketches j
them there, remarking to some that ;
"it's always best to be careful not to 1
antagonize deans and people."

sophical. Young people in particu
lar like caricatures, he observes, be
cause they can appreciate a joke on
themselves. A healthy attitude, he
thinks.
Persons being caricatured are
usually surprised that Mr. Ward can
draw them so quickly. He hunches
up behind his little easel, looks
keenly at his subject, and then his
soft pencil scribbles around for 60
seconds. Just when you think he
is getting started he turns the paper
toward you, and there is your leer
ing likeness. Another two minutes
with brush and India ink finishes up
the drawing.
Human, Mr. Ward plays little
pranks when students don't accom
modate by holding a pose or sitting
where he wants them to. After an
argument with one student over
where he would sit, the artist drew
a nose so long that it almost over
stepped caricaturist's license. More
insulting was the fact that the
drawing was still a recognizable
likeness.

cause they can appreciate a joke on

thinks.
Persons being caricatured are
usually surprised that Mr. Ward can
draw them so quickly. He hunches
up behind his little easel, looks
keenly at his subject, and then his
soft pencil scribbles around for 60
seconds. Just when you think he
is getting started he turns the paper
toward you, and there is your leer
ing likeness. Another two minutes
with brush and India ink finishes up
the drawing.
Human, Mr. Ward plays little
pranks when students don't accom
modate by holding a pose or sitting
where he wants them to. After an
argument with one student over
where he would sit, the artist drew
a nose so long that it almost over
stepped caricaturist's license. More
insulting was the fact that the
drawing was still a recognizable
likeness.
Leonard Ward likes to travel around drawing caricatures.
I>ast quarter over a thousand Stanfordites had theirs drawn hy this
peppy little man who was staying at a Pah* Alto hotel for two weeks.
"Yes, I like the work," he used to tell students while he was scrib
bling off their portrait-insults (it takes him only three minutes to draw

one). "I don't have to stay in one#
place. I can make my money at j
some college and then dash oft' to a
big city and have a good time;
spending it."
Perhaps this is why Mr. Ward did ■
not return this week as he had

visit the farm to caricature those
who couldn't break away from
studying for exams when he was j
here before.
