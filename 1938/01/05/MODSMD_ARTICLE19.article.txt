# Foot-Loose Caricaturist Draws 1000 Farm Faces
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Leonard Ward likes to travel around drawing caricatures.
I>ast quarter over a thousand Stanfordites had theirs drawn hy this
peppy little man who was staying at a Pah* Alto hotel for two weeks.
"Yes, I like the work," he used to tell students while he was scrib
bling off their portrait-insults (it takes him only three minutes to draw

one). "I don't have to stay in one#
place. I can make my money at j
some college and then dash oft' to a
big city and have a good time;
spending it."
Perhaps this is why Mr. Ward did ■
not return this week as he had
planned. However, he may yet re
visit the farm to caricature those
who couldn't break away from
studying for exams when he was j
here before.
Visits Row
Mr. Ward's biggest business came j
when he spent afternoons at the j
various houses and dormitories.!
Some of the fraternities have had f
profiles of all their members re- '
produced in miniature on one sheet, j
One house has such a cartoon that
was made three years ago by Mr. |
Ward.
Traveling all over the country, i
this five-foot four artist does most j
of his work at colleges. Prices vary, j
At Stanford it is 75 cents for a !
profile, but at some eastern schools
he says students would look down j
their noses unless he charged more [
than that. And at "some little cow j
college" he must drop prices. "But j
I sure don't stay there long," he j
says.
Accountant Once
It was as an accountant that Mr.
Wax*d first worked. "I always was I
good at figures," he says. His pref- !
erence now is drawing women.
During his stay in Palo Alto, stu
dents kept him busy by coming }
down to the hotel. Men he draws j
in his room. But he always meets j
women in the lobby and sketches j
them there, remarking to some that ;
"it's always best to be careful not to 1
antagonize deans and people."
When Mr. Ward is working on a
subject he sometimes waxes philo- [


"IT'S ALL done with mirrors,"
was the explanation given by
Leonard Ward, caricaturist, for
this self "portrait." He used it on
Christmas cards.
