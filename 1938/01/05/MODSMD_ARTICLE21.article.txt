## 
### 
Although library officials report
that only minor use has been made
of the library reserve room on the
Sunday nights that it was open last
quarter, the experiment will be con
tinued at least during this quarter.
This decision was announced yes
terday afternoon by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur — recently returned
from a six weeks' trip to New York
City—who indicated that the past
practice of using special University
funds to finance the plan will be con
tinued.
While he believes that the record
of use of the library Sunday nights
following the introduction of the
plan aroused a relatively small
amount of interest, Dr. Wilbur au
thorized the continuation of the trial
opening for at least three or four

Sunday nights this quarter, and per
haps for a longer period.
Library Director Nathan Van Pat
ten yesterday issued a report tabu
lating the use of the reserve room
on the five Sunday nights, beginning
Nov. 7, on which it was kept open,
! and indicating that "the average
| number of students using the ma
j terial in the Reserve Book Room per
night was approximately 100." The
I smallest use was on Nov. 21, while
; the largest was on Dc. 12.
Conclusion of Mr. Van Patetn's re
port was that "although these results
j do not justify us in keeping open the
reserve book room on Sunday eve
nings, it will be kept open during
the present winter quarter and a
final decision as to the future made
at the end of this period."
