### 
China started it.
In the Far Eastern conflict, Japan
wants peace, but China's Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek has blocked
local settlement of the undeclared
war.
This is what Dr. Yamato Ichihashi,
Stanford professor of Japanese his
tory and government, told 1100 per
sons at last night's Tuesday evening

"Inspired by Russia, China is using
anti-Japanism to effect national uni
fication," the speaker contended.
Record Crowd
Addressing the largest Tuesday
lecture gathering in four years, Dr.
Ichihashi tevmed his address the cus
tomary report of a returning profes
sor. He arrived recently from Japan
where he has spent the past several
months in writing and research.
Japan is seeking peace and is anx
ious to stop the Eastern conflict as
soon as possible, Dr. Ichihashi told
the rapt audience.
"Japan has no territorial ambition
in China or elsewhere," he said.
'Angels vs. Devils'
According to the speaker, failure
of the League of Nations to effect a
solution has made it look as if Japan
is to blame. "World sentiment has
succumbed to Chinese propaganda,"
he said. "The conflict has been made
to appear a war between angels and
devils."
Basing his view on conversations
he had with "learned men who oc
cupy responsible positions in Japan,"
Dr. Ichihashi charged other world
powers were to blame for fighting at
Shanghai, because of their "luke
warm" attitude when the city was in
danger and China was moving dis
guised troops and arms into the de
militarized zone.
Japan Not Fascist
As to Japan's connection with Italy
and Gei-many, the professor said
that Japan was morally supported
by these powers, both of whom op
pose Communism. Although Japan
knows these two countries are un
popular in the eyes of the world, she
accepts their moral backing in her
desire to get rid of Communism in
the Far East, he said.
"Japan is not interested in Nazi
ism or Fascism," he declared. "The
Japanese are all individualists. They
want to maintain their economic se
curity, to further their industrial
development and trade expansion."
The professor charged that the
three demjocratic nations (the United
States, France, Great Britain) may
be different in some ways but that
"they are all alike in their failure to
apply their principles to the Far
Eastern situation.
"At times even the beauty of de
mocracy fades into ugliness in inter
national relations," he epigrammed.
Urges Neutrality
While in Japan, Dr. Ichihashi spent
much of his time in ancient Japanese
capitals where "the traditional mo
nastic calm and serenity of ancient
capitals" remained the same as ever
in spite of the war. He did not know,
however, how the situation would
| develop, because it was just like
] many other incidents at the time he
I left for the Orient.
I The speaker stressed the point that
there is no hostility between the peo
ples of China and Japan.
"War, at its best, is destruction,"
jhe declared. "It is hoped that other
powers will remain strictly neutral
I and facilitate attempts to end the
I horrors of this conflict."

China started it.
In the Far Eastern conflict, Japan
wants peace, but China's Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek has blocked
local settlement of the undeclared
war.
This is what Dr. Yamato Ichihashi,
Stanford professor of Japanese his
tory and government, told 1100 per
sons at last night's Tuesday evening
lecture.
"Inspired by Russia, China is using
anti-Japanism to effect national uni
fication," the speaker contended.
Record Crowd
Addressing the largest Tuesday
lecture gathering in four years, Dr.
Ichihashi tevmed his address the cus
tomary report of a returning profes
sor. He arrived recently from Japan
where he has spent the past several
months in writing and research.
Japan is seeking peace and is anx
ious to stop the Eastern conflict as
soon as possible, Dr. Ichihashi told
the rapt audience.
"Japan has no territorial ambition
in China or elsewhere," he said.
'Angels vs. Devils'
According to the speaker, failure
of the League of Nations to effect a
solution has made it look as if Japan
is to blame. "World sentiment has
succumbed to Chinese propaganda,"
he said. "The conflict has been made
to appear a war between angels and
devils."
Basing his view on conversations
he had with "learned men who oc
cupy responsible positions in Japan,"
Dr. Ichihashi charged other world
powers were to blame for fighting at
Shanghai, because of their "luke
warm" attitude when the city was in
danger and China was moving dis
guised troops and arms into the de
militarized zone.
Japan Not Fascist
As to Japan's connection with Italy
and Gei-many, the professor said
that Japan was morally supported
by these powers, both of whom op
pose Communism. Although Japan
knows these two countries are un
popular in the eyes of the world, she
accepts their moral backing in her
desire to get rid of Communism in
the Far East, he said.
"Japan is not interested in Nazi
ism or Fascism," he declared. "The
Japanese are all individualists. They
want to maintain their economic se
curity, to further their industrial
development and trade expansion."
The professor charged that the
three demjocratic nations (the United
States, France, Great Britain) may
be different in some ways but that
"they are all alike in their failure to
apply their principles to the Far
Eastern situation.
"At times even the beauty of de
mocracy fades into ugliness in inter
national relations," he epigrammed.
Urges Neutrality
While in Japan, Dr. Ichihashi spent
much of his time in ancient Japanese
capitals where "the traditional mo
nastic calm and serenity of ancient
capitals" remained the same as ever
in spite of the war. He did not know,
however, how the situation would
| develop, because it was just like
