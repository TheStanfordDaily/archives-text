OTHER COLLEGES TURN
TO WINTER SPORTS
While we are content here on the
Farm with a dry skiing course and
a ski club, the other three confer
ence colleges in California are go
ing in for winter sports in an in
tercollegiate way.
Cal, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Loyola
are busy preparing for the Califor
nia Intercollegiate ice hockey sea
son. The 800-erkeley Bears have
already played several games in the
Oakland Ice Rink. Incidentally,
that Oakland ice is plenty hard . . .
I tried it during vacation . . . but
maybe ice is that way everywhere.
The Californians are led by Stan
Oakes, an ace puckster from Can
ada. The Bears aren't too adept on
the ice and lost their first three
games, U-0 and 7-3, to Pacific Gas
and Electric outfit, and 8-0 to the
Montgomery Ward team.
The Oakland games, the only
ones in the San Francisco Bay area,
have been attracting capacity crowds
of 4000.
Cal, U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and Loyola
teams will travel to Yosemite for
the Hoover Cup Matches, January
G, 7, and 8.
BRUINS HIRE
GERMAN STAR
Down Weslwood way the Bruins
have hired Otto Steiner, former
German cross-country and Bavarian
cross-country and jumping cham
pion, to coach the U.C.L.A. ski team
during the coming season.
Little College of Pacific is going
on its longest football trip next sea
son to play its first intersectional
opponent since the institution was
founded.
"Double A," otherwise known as
Amos Alonzo Stagg, the grand old
man of football, is leading his Ben
gal Tigers back to the Windy City
for a tussle with the team he coached
into many Big Ten titles . . . the
University of Chicago. Next season
will mark the sixth year that Stagg
lias been in Stockton and away from
Chicago.
Jack Cuddy, U.P.'s ace sports
commentator, rattled oft' the story of
the Golden Bear and Little Red Rid
ing Hood yesterday for the nation's
papers. While the Pacific Coast was
singing the praise of the Cal won
der boys, Cuddy was tooting the
trumpet of the east by boobing Cal's
feat of whipping Alabama in the
Rose Bowl.
Pitt football players eliminated
themselves, which left the logical
choice either Alabama or Fordham.
The East is still moannig because
the Rams weren't chosen.
CAL STILL HAD
WHALE OF TEAM'
On the Farm we have no love for
the Denizens of Razzberry Canyon,
but I must admit they had one
whale of a ball team this season and
I honestly think they would have
beaten the Rams by practically the
same score. I don't believe there
was much to choose between the
Crimson Tide and the Rams. If the
two teams had played each other, it
couldn't be rated anything but a
toss-up.
One thing that must have had
something to do with Alabama's se
lection was the fact that the Bears
whipped the pants of St. Mary's,
30-7, while the Rams were hard
pressed to eke out a 6-0 win.
Cuddy's crying is simply typical
of the East's yelping, which is an
attempt to cover up the fact that
that section of the country wasn't
on the gridiron.
Pacific Coast football was supe
rior this season after a rather dis
mal one during 1936. Washington,
Cal, Santa Clara, U.SF., San Jose
State, Fresno State, U.C.LA., and
U.S.C. all won games from inter
sectional opponents.

Jack Cuddy, U.P.'s ace sports
commentator, rattled oft' the story of
the Golden Bear and Little Red Rid
ing Hood yesterday for the nation's
papers. While the Pacific Coast was
singing the praise of the Cal won
der boys, Cuddy was tooting the
trumpet of the east by boobing Cal's
feat of whipping Alabama in the
Rose Bowl.
Pitt football players eliminated
themselves, which left the logical
choice either Alabama or Fordham.
The East is still moannig because
the Rams weren't chosen.
CAL STILL HAD
WHALE OF TEAM'
On the Farm we have no love for
the Denizens of Razzberry Canyon,
but I must admit they had one
whale of a ball team this season and
I honestly think they would have
beaten the Rams by practically the
same score. I don't believe there
was much to choose between the
Crimson Tide and the Rams. If the
two teams had played each other, it
couldn't be rated anything but a
toss-up.
One thing that must have had
something to do with Alabama's se
lection was the fact that the Bears
whipped the pants of St. Mary's,
30-7, while the Rams were hard
pressed to eke out a 6-0 win.
Cuddy's crying is simply typical
of the East's yelping, which is an
attempt to cover up the fact that
that section of the country wasn't
on the gridiron.
Pacific Coast football was supe
rior this season after a rather dis
mal one during 1936. Washington,
Cal, Santa Clara, U.SF., San Jose

U.S.C. all won games from inter
sectional opponents.
OTHER COLLEGES TURN
TO WINTER SPORTS
While we are content here on the
Farm with a dry skiing course and
a ski club, the other three confer
ence colleges in California are go
ing in for winter sports in an in
tercollegiate way.
Cal, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Loyola
are busy preparing for the Califor
nia Intercollegiate ice hockey sea
son. The 800-erkeley Bears have
already played several games in the
Oakland Ice Rink. Incidentally,
that Oakland ice is plenty hard . . .
I tried it during vacation . . . but
maybe ice is that way everywhere.
The Californians are led by Stan
Oakes, an ace puckster from Can
ada. The Bears aren't too adept on
the ice and lost their first three
games, U-0 and 7-3, to Pacific Gas
and Electric outfit, and 8-0 to the
Montgomery Ward team.
The Oakland games, the only
ones in the San Francisco Bay area,
have been attracting capacity crowds
of 4000.
Cal, U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and Loyola
teams will travel to Yosemite for
the Hoover Cup Matches, January
G, 7, and 8.
