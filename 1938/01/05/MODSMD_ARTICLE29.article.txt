# Temple Game "Woke Cards Up" Bunn Says
## Team Played 'Just to Win' In New York Captain Luisetti Needs Police Escort's Help Leaving Gymnasium 
### WALT PETERSON 
The varsity basketballers didn't
regain the type of play that marked
their intersectional tour a year ago
until they "woke up' in the second
half of the Temple game in Phila
delphia December 30, Coach John
Bunn said yesterday, upon the re
turn of the squad from the second
triumphal trip in as many years.
They played just to win in the
Arizona University game which
opened the series, but then couldn't
find the necessary spark in either
the roughhouse C.C.N.Y. tilt or the
j less colorful L.I.U. contest in New
i York a week later.
Battle Sluggish
The first half of the Temple battle
found the Cards putting up a slug
gish battle, according to Bunn, that
left them eight points behind at half
time and slightly chagrined. They
went back into the game after the
intermission and hit the peak they
had lost sight of since the season be
fore, to pull up to a one-point lead
over the driving, hard-playing
Owls.
However, it was their last bolt
and found them too spent after
three games in four nights to stave
off the returning rally of the Phila
delphians. Three points advantage
instead of one, Coach Bunn aver
red, might well have been enough
to win the game.
Crowd Speechless
The discovery that they had not
been playing the sort of ball they
were capable of left the team charg
ed with determination, and after a
night of rest they caught Duquesne
amidships to crowd them into
speechless submission.
The ease of their victory dupli
cated the showing the team had
made for Cleveland fans a year ago
in walking all over Western Re
serve U. It left those fans with
the impression that Stanford basket
ball teams must be nothing short of
miraculous, Bunn said.
Court Short, Narow
Part of the success in Cleveland
must be attributed to the fact that
the court is 8 feet narrower and
10 feet shorter than the regulation
arenas elsewhere, according to the
coach of the Indians.
A police escort was necessary to
help Captain Luisetti out of the
gym at the end of the game, after
he had scored his 50th point on a
one-hand shot while tumbling
backward from a collision with
teammate Bill Rapp. The crowd
stood and cheered unhaltingly for
five minutes at his exhibition.
With the tour history now, the
team will once again buckle down to
intensive practice, in preparation for
the conference openers with South
ex*n California in the Pavilion a
week from Friday and Saturday.
Coach Bunn will drill the squad
the rest of this week, including Sat
urday, and then will bear down for
four days next week. It is expected
that the Trojans will offer stiff com
petition, since they are consider
ably heavier this season than last.
Lost from the dangerous outfit of
last year are Oram and Gracin, All-
Coast stars, but returning veterans
have been greatly supplemented by
a group of sophomore flashes.
