# Stagers Plan Winter Show
## Loss of Director Makes Program Indefinite 
### 
Dramatic Council met yesterday
to select a winter show for student
production, only to find that Stan
ford Stagers is minus the director
they selected last quarter. Bud
Cady was forced to resign the po
sition because he will not be at
schoo lthis quarter.
Stagers will meet toda in the
Little Theater at 4 o'clock to select
a new director for the proposed
show. No student looms as a pos
sible mentor because of heavy win
ter quarter programs.
Martin Flavin has offered the dra
matic organization the premiere of
his American comedy, "Blue Jeans."
It was suggested at yesterday's
meeting that the Stagers request
Mr. Flavin, who is teaching a
course in playwriting here this quar
ter, to direct his own work. This
plan would offer students the oppor
tunity of being directed by the au
thor of the vehicle on which they
are working.
Possibility of Stagers' producing a
Broadway success this quarter was
discussed by Dramatic Council. In
quiries revealed that current plays
are not available for amateur pro
duction, and those of past seasons
have either already toured the coast
or are not suitable for a campus
presentation.
Stagers will produce two play
readings this quarter. The first, un
selected as yet, will be January 12
under the direction of Jack Daw
son.
