# Football Gets New Rules Passing Offense Benefits

EDGEWATER PARK. Miss., Jan.
4 (UP). —More forward passes in
the end zone and more elbow room
for quarterbacks to open up with
all their scoring threats today were
envisioned for the 1938 football sea
son as a result of the two rule
changes announced by the' national
football rules committee after their
33rd annual meeting.
The changes were:
1. Hereafter any forward pass
(excepting those made on fourth
down) which becomes incomplete
behind the goal line, will be treated
as though it struck the ground in
the field of play. An incomplete for
ward pass behind the goal line on
fourth down will as now result in a
touchback.
2. When the ball goes out of
bounds between the goal lines, or
becomes dead within 15 yards of
the side line, in which case it shall
be put in play at a spot 15 yards
fi'om that side line, instead of 10
yards as heretofore.
Aids Quarterback
The new rule governing passes
means that the offensive team can
now make three consecutive incom
plete passes in the end zone, bar
ring, of course, fourth down, with
out losing the ball. This, the rules
committee felt, will enable the
quarterback to employ his full rep
ertoire of plays at all times.
The'rules committee deemed that

the development of both forward
and lateral passes had made more
leeway desirable. As it is imprac
ticable to widen the field, the ball
will be brought in five yards far
ther. This change also will aid short
side plays near the sidelines, plac
ing a greater burden on the de
fense.
The suggestion of the football
coaches to the rules committee that
a forward pass which inadvertently
strikes an ineligible player behind
the line of scrimmage be considered
an incomplete pass instead of loss
of the ball was rejected after con
siderable debate.
But a standing committee on rules
changes will study the suggestion,
along with several others, and make
a report at the next meeting.
Study Made
Secretary W. S. Langford, New
York City, reported that the many
rules suggestions made were stud
ied carefully, and sifted down to 10
final possibilities, of which eight
were rejected and two accepted.
"The suggestion to permit a for
ward pass any place behind the line
of scrimmage was discussed only
briefly and there was no marked
sentiment for it," he said. "No
thought at all was given to moving
the goal posts back to the goal
line."
These two rules have been used
successfully by the National Pro
fessional football league.

fourth down will as now result in a
touchback.
2. When the ball goes out of
bounds between the goal lines, or
becomes dead within 15 yards of
the side line, in which case it shall
be put in play at a spot 15 yards
fi'om that side line, instead of 10
yards as heretofore.
Aids Quarterback
The new rule governing passes
means that the offensive team can
now make three consecutive incom
plete passes in the end zone, bar
ring, of course, fourth down, with
out losing the ball. This, the rules
committee felt, will enable the
quarterback to employ his full rep
ertoire of plays at all times.
The'rules committee deemed that

the development of both forward
and lateral passes had made more
leeway desirable. As it is imprac
ticable to widen the field, the ball
will be brought in five yards far
ther. This change also will aid short
side plays near the sidelines, plac
ing a greater burden on the de
fense.
The suggestion of the football
coaches to the rules committee that
a forward pass which inadvertently
strikes an ineligible player behind
the line of scrimmage be considered
an incomplete pass instead of loss
of the ball was rejected after con
siderable debate.
But a standing committee on rules
changes will study the suggestion,
along with several others, and make
a report at the next meeting.
Study Made
Secretary W. S. Langford, New
York City, reported that the many
rules suggestions made were stud
ied carefully, and sifted down to 10
final possibilities, of which eight
were rejected and two accepted.
"The suggestion to permit a for
ward pass any place behind the line
of scrimmage was discussed only
briefly and there was no marked
sentiment for it," he said. "No
thought at all was given to moving
the goal posts back to the goal
line."
These two rules have been used
successfully by the National Pro
fessional football league.
EDGEWATER PARK. Miss., Jan.
4 (UP). —More forward passes in
the end zone and more elbow room
for quarterbacks to open up with
all their scoring threats today were
envisioned for the 1938 football sea
son as a result of the two rule
changes announced by the' national
football rules committee after their
33rd annual meeting.
The changes were:
1. Hereafter any forward pass
(excepting those made on fourth
down) which becomes incomplete
behind the goal line, will be treated
as though it struck the ground in
the field of play. An incomplete for
ward pass behind the goal line on
fourth down will as now result in a
touchback.
2. When the ball goes out of
bounds between the goal lines, or
becomes dead within 15 yards of
the side line, in which case it shall
be put in play at a spot 15 yards
fi'om that side line, instead of 10
yards as heretofore.
