# Golfers Priming For Link Season
## 
### 
Although golf competition doesn't
reach its peak until spring quarter,
Coach Eddie Twiggs has wasted no
time in getting his divot diggers into
shape for another big season on the
links.
Intramural play held the lime
light in golf competition last quar
ter and interclass matches will be
of main interest during this semes
ter. Candidates for varsity and
freshman teams participated in a
ladder tournament last term, Art
Doering winning the varsity division
by better than 30 points and Don
Haslett, former state junior cham
pion, nosing out Hal Stone for frosh
honors. The same tournament will
be held this quarter to get the squad
into condition.
In the spring, competition will
consist of the Stanford Individual
Championship, the Long Driving
Championship, the Pacific Coast In
tercollegiate Meet and the Big
Match with California.
Kinscem, wonder horse of Europe,
rah 54 races and never lost one.
