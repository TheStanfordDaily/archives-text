HENDAYE, Franco-Spanish Fron
tier, Jan. 4 (UP). â€”Insurgent col
umns, smashing through three lines
of Loyalist trenches behind a fleet
of Italian whippet tanks, were re
ported tonight to have entered the
walled city of Teruel from the west.
Insurgent headquarters at Sara
gozza said battalions under com
mand of General Miguel Aranda
moved across the frozen Turia River
after a three-day battle that cost
heavy casualties.
Loyalist dispatches at the fron
tier denied that Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco's troops had broken
through defenses on the western
outskirts and insisted that govern
ment forces had forced the enemy
to a standstill.
Heavy fighting continued, the
Loyalists said, in the deep snows of
the Albarracin foothills two miles
north of Teruel, where the enemy
sought to open a path into the
Aragonese city.
