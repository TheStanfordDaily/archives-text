## Hall-Row Rush Rules Need Teeth 
### 
A HEADLINE last spring proclaimed the birth
of a new society on the campus, designed
to heal the Hall-Row split. Another in the last
issue of last quarter told of the first accomplish
ment of the group. The Axe Society had de
vised a way to keep the fraternities from taking
members from the clubs, and Interfraternity
Council had ratified the measure.
In its first action, soon after formation last
year, the society proposed a joint Hall-Row cau
cus to nominate candidates for student offices.
The proposal failed, perhaps because student
government, like any other government, works
through parties and pressure groups. The cau
cus might have produced candidates acceptable
to both sides, but actually left their nomination
in the hands of one small group instead of two.
The new society-sponsored ruling has been
praised enthusiastically by both Hall and Row
officials. Its terms are that the club president
must be notified before one of his members can
be rushed, and that no pledging can be made
until 30 days after the notification. It is claimed
that it will prevent recurrence of recent exam
ples of changes of allegiance, and resulting
hard feelings.
But, since rushing and pledging are essen

tially private, clubs have no assurance that the
same process will not be repeated with just a
little more secrecy. The Hall actually regards
the ruling as something to point to in case of
future trouble, .a defined, printed bill of what
they believe are their rights. But something to
point to may be its only use.
Whether the new system works or not, the
society's aim in trying to close the gap between
Lasuen and Arguello is fine and idealistic in its
theoretical aspects. You can't beat peace on
earth and good will toward men as a precept
of behavior.
But, in practice, to do completely what the
society is trying to do, all differences between
Hall and Row would have to be taken away,
thus leaving a dead level of uniformity. Hall
and Row would no longer exist as political or
social entities. When that state is reached there
would be little reason for joining either frater
nity or club, which might or might not be a
good thing.
However, to pass over the large question of
the classless society, the new rushing regu
lation merely means that Hall and Row are mak
ing rules for their game. All that is needed
now is a referee, head linesman, umpire, field
judge, and some penalties.â€”L. L.
