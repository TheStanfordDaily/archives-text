# Mr. Lange Knows Why
## 
### 
NOW that the curtain has risen several times
on "what promises to be the most ambi
tious program in the history of Stanford dra
matics," students are beginning to wonder why
the main hall of brand-new Memorial Hall has
been set aside in preference for the Little The
ater.
Already Stanford's grapevine has gone hog
wild with stories about unmanageable acoustics
and unalterable austerity, about proposed
changes running into tens of thousands of dol
lars. Explanations are sought as to why last
quarter's trinity of "Don Juan," "The Trojan
Women," and "The Alchemist" were all pre
sented in the Little Theater, and why the four
plays scheduled for this quarter are going to
be handled in the same way.
While such rumors rear ugly heads through
various campus manholes, the new Division of
Speech and Drama sticks by its original state
ment that "we have the best dramatic plant of
any college in the world."
In spite of, not because of, this unexcelled
equipment, Messieurs Lange and Stevens, who
are in charge of the productions, explain that
they are chiefly interested in turning out actors,
not box office hits.
To accomplish their purpose best, student
dramatists should be in as many plays as pos
sible and should play in each production as
many times as possible. So most of the drama
department plays are held in the Little Theater.
Here the students are in intimate contact with
nighly "full houses." Here they get a chance
to correct first-night butches, to rid themselves

of stage fright, to train themselves for typical
professional working conditions.
All of this cannot be done in the main hall.
Not because of architectural mistakes, but be
cause the very size of the hall eliminates inti
mate audience contact, makes impossible any
attempt for more than a one- or two-night stand.
Petty fault-finders to the contrary, the theater
is not ruined by a crimson curtain, by a too
shiny brass rail or too bright aisle lights—it is
not, in the words of the vacationing Mr. Lange,
ruined by anything. Slight changes may be
made eventually. The walls may be darkened,
and possibly the seats moved closer to the
stage.
However, many a night the main hall will
remain dark as footlights flare in the Little
Thetter—not because of bad planning but be
cause Stanford is trying to design its training
to turn out near-professional actors. —J. R.

of stage fright, to train themselves for typical
professional working conditions.
All of this cannot be done in the main hall.
Not because of architectural mistakes, but be
cause the very size of the hall eliminates inti
mate audience contact, makes impossible any
attempt for more than a one- or two-night stand.
Petty fault-finders to the contrary, the theater
is not ruined by a crimson curtain, by a too
shiny brass rail or too bright aisle lights—it is
not, in the words of the vacationing Mr. Lange,
ruined by anything. Slight changes may be
made eventually. The walls may be darkened,
and possibly the seats moved closer to the
stage.
However, many a night the main hall will
remain dark as footlights flare in the Little
Thetter—not because of bad planning but be
cause Stanford is trying to design its training
to turn out near-professional actors. —J. R.
NOW that the curtain has risen several times
on "what promises to be the most ambi
tious program in the history of Stanford dra
matics," students are beginning to wonder why
the main hall of brand-new Memorial Hall has
been set aside in preference for the Little The
ater.
Already Stanford's grapevine has gone hog
wild with stories about unmanageable acoustics
and unalterable austerity, about proposed
changes running into tens of thousands of dol
lars. Explanations are sought as to why last
quarter's trinity of "Don Juan," "The Trojan
Women," and "The Alchemist" were all pre
sented in the Little Theater, and why the four
plays scheduled for this quarter are going to
be handled in the same way.
While such rumors rear ugly heads through
various campus manholes, the new Division of
Speech and Drama sticks by its original state
ment that "we have the best dramatic plant of
any college in the world."
In spite of, not because of, this unexcelled
equipment, Messieurs Lange and Stevens, who
are in charge of the productions, explain that
they are chiefly interested in turning out actors,
not box office hits.
To accomplish their purpose best, student
dramatists should be in as many plays as pos
sible and should play in each production as
many times as possible. So most of the drama
department plays are held in the Little Theater.
Here the students are in intimate contact with
nighly "full houses." Here they get a chance
to correct first-night butches, to rid themselves

of stage fright, to train themselves for typical
professional working conditions.
All of this cannot be done in the main hall.
Not because of architectural mistakes, but be
cause the very size of the hall eliminates inti
mate audience contact, makes impossible any
attempt for more than a one- or two-night stand.
