# BULL SESSION
## THE 						ONE ON THE RIGHT IS BOWLEGGED 
### 
AS Our Editor pointed out yesterday, the gears of
the Stanford Daily grind slowly in these first
days of publication. When we, the staff, left off ring
ing welkins and returned to tilt with the windmills
that the business staff gives us for typewriters, we
found that the Muse was annoyed by our brief flirta
tion with other goddesses. The coy wench refused to
lean over our shoulders; the gears of The Daily re
fused to grind. And so we had to shred many a gear
to produce the masterpiece that the campus dragged
through the syrup yesterday morning.
But we have evidence which indicates that all that
jitters is not The Daily staff. Featured among the
lovely photos which United Press delivered to us
Monday was the lukewarm-surrealistic gem that
adorned our front page. This masterpiece pictured
four glamorous girls, clad in numbers reading from
left to right, 1938, and gladhanding the New Year
with an abandon they did not learn at Vassar. In the
background was an assembly of headlines which
brought to mind most of the major wars, famines,
pestilences, and deaths of the past year.
* * *
I have no intention of going into the broader social
implications of this work. I cut my finger on a razor
blade yesterday (Mother: It is perfectly all right now.
I had it bandaged at the 8.A.C.; there is no danger of
blood poisoning; they did not have to take stitches.)
But it makes it hard to type; and it's a good excuse
for keeping this short and leaving out commas.
There are, however, several points about the pic
lure which would delight a sociologist. In the first
place, it indicates that United Press is caught hi the
strip tide which has swamped so many papers. The
charming briefness of the maidens' costumes shows
(hat Sally Rand and Gipsy Rose Lee have not lived
in vain.
* # * *
The Daily has not dared venture into the field of
leg art since the famous Eisenbach survey which in
dicated that ninety per cent of the women should (or
perhaps it was should not) look to their morals. But
now under the protection of United Press we again
make a bid for the interest monopolized by that second
cup of coffee.
Of course, the girl on the end is bowlegged. But
(his too has its social significance. It shows that in
the glad new year no discrimination will be made
ngainst those who' are not cast in the mold of Venus.
It rededicates us to the noble doctrine of liberty,
equality, fraternity, and clean rushing.
♦ * * *
And then, too, the girl second from the end is
knockneed. which balanced things up.
It is all very beautiful and symbolic. I suspect
111:11 UP. i out In rapture Iho Rembrandt trade.

AS Our Editor pointed out yesterday, the gears of
the Stanford Daily grind slowly in these first
days of publication. When we, the staff, left off ring
ing welkins and returned to tilt with the windmills
that the business staff gives us for typewriters, we
found that the Muse was annoyed by our brief flirta
tion with other goddesses. The coy wench refused to
lean over our shoulders; the gears of The Daily re
fused to grind. And so we had to shred many a gear
to produce the masterpiece that the campus dragged
through the syrup yesterday morning.
But we have evidence which indicates that all that
jitters is not The Daily staff. Featured among the
lovely photos which United Press delivered to us
Monday was the lukewarm-surrealistic gem that
adorned our front page. This masterpiece pictured
four glamorous girls, clad in numbers reading from
left to right, 1938, and gladhanding the New Year
with an abandon they did not learn at Vassar. In the
background was an assembly of headlines which
brought to mind most of the major wars, famines,
pestilences, and deaths of the past year.

I have no intention of going into the broader social
implications of this work. I cut my finger on a razor
blade yesterday (Mother: It is perfectly all right now.
I had it bandaged at the 8.A.C.; there is no danger of
blood poisoning; they did not have to take stitches.)
But it makes it hard to type; and it's a good excuse
for keeping this short and leaving out commas.
There are, however, several points about the pic
lure which would delight a sociologist. In the first
place, it indicates that United Press is caught hi the
strip tide which has swamped so many papers. The
charming briefness of the maidens' costumes shows
(hat Sally Rand and Gipsy Rose Lee have not lived
in vain.

The Daily has not dared venture into the field of
leg art since the famous Eisenbach survey which in
dicated that ninety per cent of the women should (or
