best this, best that, we think that this is
as good a time as any to name those we think were
the best of last year's swing musicians. It won't prove
anything but the result will be merely the combina
tion of a lot of our stray thoughts about musicians
into one band. '
Into last year's star swing aggregation I would place
nine white men and four colored men. It seems a
bit paradoxical that white men should predominate
in such a selection, but we believe that is because the
general public and ourselves hear more white than
colored recordings, and so our selections are based
upon what we personally have heai'd, not the opinions
of others.
But getting back to our swing group: in the reed
section we like Jimmy Dorsey on alto, Chu Berry,
with Cab Calloway; Eddie Miller with Bob Crosby
on tenors; Benny Goodman on clarinet. In the brass
section we pick (we're going to hear about this) first
trumpet, Harry James with Benny Goodman; second
trumpet, Bunny Berigan; third trumpet, Louis Arm
strong.
Ti'ombones, Tommy Dorsey, first chair, Jack Tea
garden, second chair; Pee Wee Hunt, with Casa Loma,
third chair. For the rhythm, we would have Teddy
Wilson, of course, on piano; Carmen Maestren, Tommy
Dorsey's man, on guitar; Bob Haggart on bass; and
Ray Bauduc on drums, both of these men with Bob
Crosby's outfit.
Most of these selections stand upon their own mer
its, but we can hear the anguished howls of those
who would place Berigan over James, Gene Krupa
over Bauduc, as the best drummer, and Goodman's
guitarist, Allan Ruess, as the best in the land. All
we can say is that James's stuff sounds more like jig
(colored) music than Berigan's things do.
It's not that we think that Berigan can't swing
marvelously, because that isn't true; you can catch
him on "I Can't Get Started" to see what we mean.
There really isn't a terribly big margin between them,
but just listen awfully hard to the second side of "Sing
Sing Sing," and see how James attacks, and the tone
he gets out of that mess of tubes and slides he blows
through. He sounds like a Negro, there being no higher
compliment we could possibly pay a white man, mu
sically speaking.
For 1937's outstanding swing band, Goodman was
tops, with Jimmy Lunceford best in the colored realm.
As for sweet music we tab Hal Kemp for first, with
the Casa Loma in second spot. Vocalists find Bing
Crosby still best, with Mildred Bailey and Maxine
Sullivan, a colored gal, splitting the feminine chores.
When it came to picking our choice for the outstand
ing instrumentalist, we got to mulling between Good
man and Tommy Dorsey; then we thought about
Teddy Wilson, then Red Norvo, and finally we just
gave it up and decided, '"Oh, hell, why go crazy at
the first of the quarter?"

(colored) music than Berigan's things do.
It's not that we think that Berigan can't swing
marvelously, because that isn't true; you can catch
him on "I Can't Get Started" to see what we mean.
There really isn't a terribly big margin between them,
but just listen awfully hard to the second side of "Sing
Sing Sing," and see how James attacks, and the tone
he gets out of that mess of tubes and slides he blows
through. He sounds like a Negro, there being no higher
compliment we could possibly pay a white man, mu
sically speaking.
For 1937's outstanding swing band, Goodman was
tops, with Jimmy Lunceford best in the colored realm.
As for sweet music we tab Hal Kemp for first, with
the Casa Loma in second spot. Vocalists find Bing
Crosby still best, with Mildred Bailey and Maxine
Sullivan, a colored gal, splitting the feminine chores.
When it came to picking our choice for the outstand
ing instrumentalist, we got to mulling between Good
man and Tommy Dorsey; then we thought about
Teddy Wilson, then Red Norvo, and finally we just
gave it up and decided, '"Oh, hell, why go crazy at
the first of the quarter?"

best this, best that, we think that this is
as good a time as any to name those we think were
the best of last year's swing musicians. It won't prove
anything but the result will be merely the combina
tion of a lot of our stray thoughts about musicians
into one band. '
Into last year's star swing aggregation I would place
nine white men and four colored men. It seems a
bit paradoxical that white men should predominate
in such a selection, but we believe that is because the
general public and ourselves hear more white than
colored recordings, and so our selections are based
upon what we personally have heai'd, not the opinions
of others.
But getting back to our swing group: in the reed
section we like Jimmy Dorsey on alto, Chu Berry,
with Cab Calloway; Eddie Miller with Bob Crosby
on tenors; Benny Goodman on clarinet. In the brass
section we pick (we're going to hear about this) first
trumpet, Harry James with Benny Goodman; second
trumpet, Bunny Berigan; third trumpet, Louis Arm
strong.
Ti'ombones, Tommy Dorsey, first chair, Jack Tea
garden, second chair; Pee Wee Hunt, with Casa Loma,
third chair. For the rhythm, we would have Teddy
Wilson, of course, on piano; Carmen Maestren, Tommy
Dorsey's man, on guitar; Bob Haggart on bass; and
Ray Bauduc on drums, both of these men with Bob
Crosby's outfit.
Most of these selections stand upon their own mer
its, but we can hear the anguished howls of those
who would place Berigan over James, Gene Krupa
over Bauduc, as the best drummer, and Goodman's
guitarist, Allan Ruess, as the best in the land. All
we can say is that James's stuff sounds more like jig
(colored) music than Berigan's things do.

him on "I Can't Get Started" to see what we mean.
