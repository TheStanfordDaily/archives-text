# 'Rosalie' Futile Despite Money, Stars Used
## 
### 
"Rosalie," soon to be seen in Palo
Alto, is a futile motion picture.
M.G.M. has indulged in paroxysms
of effort, spent four-digit sums a
minute, stuck in everything from
Flirtation Walk to the mythical
kingdom of Romanza, to no avail.
It is really all a little bit sad.
First we must shed a tear for
Nelson Eddy, who is embarrassingly
cast as a combination West Point
Cadet-star halfback - record break
ing aviator-opera singer. It's a
cinch that Mr. Eddy can sing, but
the feeble Cole Porter tunes that he
is handed in "Rosalie" are not what ,
the poor fellow deserves.
Music a Mistake
It must be admitted, however, that ■
the star of God-knows-how-many j
radio hours acts just about as ex
pressively as a geology professor. In ;
this little opus his running mate is ;
Eleanor Powell, the lady who can ;
tap a mean tap. Yes, she can tap to
the proper kind of music, but in an
effort to be super-colossal, or
something, M.G.M. lets her attempt I
her one big number to the tune of
the ballet music from Borodin's
opera, "Prince Igor," with interpola
tions of the tune "Rosalie" played
in the manner of Richard Wagner.
To top it off this routine is ini- ,
tiated by several legions of chorus j
girls and concluded by the entire j
population of Los Angeles county in
every conceivable pose and cos- '
tume. Oh, we must add that the 1
routine is executed on a series of |
gigantic tom-toms.
To swell the awing budget for j
"Rosalie" every spare supporting 1
player around the lot was thrown j
into the cast. Many of them ex- |
tremely talented, they must be con- I
tent to more or less stand around j
and look silly in this one. Ray 80l- j
ger, nimble-footed Broadway com- j
edian, gets plenty of footage as j
Nelson's buddy, but he has little ]
chance to display the specialties that 1
have panicked legit audiences.
Originality Missing
Frank Morgan and Edna May
Oliver are unfortunately stuck with
a couple of roles borrowed from a
half dozen of their previous- pic- |
tures, viz the philandering monarch |
I and the stuffy old dowager. Ilona j
! Massey is a recent European impor- i
| tation who has few opportunities to !
j act but does prove that she possesses |
j a mediocre soprano voice.
The plot is all about the princess |
|of a mythical kingdom studying at !
I Vassar and» her All-American West;
i Point sweetheart who chases her all j
I the way to the joint she came from i
j only to find she is engaged to one j
;of the local hot shots. Anyway, the j
super-man gets the gal in the end,'
and it is all too, too original.
Sad to say, some people are go
ing to like this picture, and lots >
more like it are going to be made, i
I guess we can't reform society ,
overnight.

"Rosalie," soon to be seen in Palo
Alto, is a futile motion picture.
M.G.M. has indulged in paroxysms
of effort, spent four-digit sums a
minute, stuck in everything from
Flirtation Walk to the mythical
kingdom of Romanza, to no avail.
It is really all a little bit sad.
First we must shed a tear for
Nelson Eddy, who is embarrassingly
cast as a combination West Point
Cadet-star halfback - record break
ing aviator-opera singer. It's a
cinch that Mr. Eddy can sing, but
the feeble Cole Porter tunes that he
is handed in "Rosalie" are not what ,
the poor fellow deserves.
Music a Mistake
It must be admitted, however, that ■
the star of God-knows-how-many j
radio hours acts just about as ex
pressively as a geology professor. In ;
this little opus his running mate is ;
Eleanor Powell, the lady who can ;
tap a mean tap. Yes, she can tap to
the proper kind of music, but in an
effort to be super-colossal, or
something, M.G.M. lets her attempt I
her one big number to the tune of
the ballet music from Borodin's
opera, "Prince Igor," with interpola
tions of the tune "Rosalie" played
in the manner of Richard Wagner.
To top it off this routine is ini- ,
tiated by several legions of chorus j
girls and concluded by the entire j
population of Los Angeles county in
every conceivable pose and cos- '
tume. Oh, we must add that the 1
routine is executed on a series of |
gigantic tom-toms.
To swell the awing budget for j
"Rosalie" every spare supporting 1
player around the lot was thrown j
into the cast. Many of them ex- |
tremely talented, they must be con- I
tent to more or less stand around j
and look silly in this one. Ray 80l- j
ger, nimble-footed Broadway com- j
edian, gets plenty of footage as j
Nelson's buddy, but he has little ]
chance to display the specialties that 1
have panicked legit audiences.
Originality Missing
Frank Morgan and Edna May
Oliver are unfortunately stuck with
a couple of roles borrowed from a
half dozen of their previous- pic- |
tures, viz the philandering monarch |
I and the stuffy old dowager. Ilona j
! Massey is a recent European impor- i
| tation who has few opportunities to !
j act but does prove that she possesses |
j a mediocre soprano voice.
The plot is all about the princess |
|of a mythical kingdom studying at !
I Vassar and» her All-American West;
i Point sweetheart who chases her all j
I the way to the joint she came from i
j only to find she is engaged to one j
;of the local hot shots. Anyway, the j
super-man gets the gal in the end,'
and it is all too, too original.
Sad to say, some people are go
ing to like this picture, and lots >
more like it are going to be made, i
I guess we can't reform society ,
overnight.
