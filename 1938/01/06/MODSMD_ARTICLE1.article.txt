# China Asks U.S., British Aid in Crisis
## International Settlement Scene of Japanese Demand for Control 
### 
SHANGHAI, Thursday, Jan. 6
(UP). â€”China appealed t" the Unit
ed States, Great Britain and France
today for "prompt measures" to
meet Japanese demands for virtual
domination of the Shanghai Inter
national Settlement.
A fresh clash between Japanese
and foreign interests threatened as
result of the action of the Chinese
provisional government at Hankow
in calling upon the three powers to
defy the Japanese and "preserve the
existing legal administration of the
settlement."
The Chinese objected particularly
to a reported proclamation of the
Shanghai Municipal Council stating
that anyone offending any armed
force in the International Settlement
would be handed over to the armed
force involved for punishment.
Slight Satisfaction
The proclamation was said to have
been a slight measure of satisfaction
for Japanese demands for stern
measure to put down an outbreak
of bombings and other attacks on
Japanese and pro-Japanese Chinese.
Under the ruling, China's "dare to
die" men forming suicide squads
would face Japanese punishment.
The Japanese, seeking domination
of the International Settlement with
its vast American, British, and other
interests, revealed that they are de
termined to exert control through
the Municipal Council instead of en
forcing an outright military occupa
tion.
