# Football Becomes a National Problem Child
## Should Something be Done About It? YES 
### 
What is the matter with football? From all
sides comes the rumor that it is assuming a
Frankenstein character. Surely anything so
prominent in the public eye as football is to be
criticized, but actually these evils are out
weighed by the benefits derived. Anyone "in
the know" or who has even considered the
facts in any detail can detect the "corny trill"
in the present denunciatory babble.
Football, under the regulations of some col
leges, does present quite a commercialized as
pect, but even in these institutions it does do
untold good—that is never mentioned. When
you stop to realize that there could be no minor
sports programs at all without the aid of foot
ball receipts, you must give another thought
before cutting off the feeding hand.
According to reliable statistics, 75 per cent of
all athletes must earn their way through col
lege: eliminate football and you throw the ma
jority of this group out in the world without the
opportunity of trying to get a university educa
tion. This leading American sport is full of
little-known and little recognized benefits; it
allows athletic departments to expand, to offer
more adequate and extensive facilities, and to
secure competent instructors in all fields.
Up to now all that has been mentioned has
been aimed at the benefits extended only to
those connected with athletics. Actually, the
greatest value of football has been to the uni
versities themselves. Not only have their indi
vidual reputations been enhanced, but football
has allowed the extension of old and the crea
tion of new academic departments. New living
quarters, new libraries, new theaters, new edu
cation buildings, and even new professors have
been made possible by gridiron proceeds. To
slight football would be to cut off the nose to
spite the face of the entire University program.
At Stanford, however, a clause in the found
ing grant —which prohibits the use of athletic
moneys for general University financing—has
largely limited the benefits of football to other
fields of athletics. Four swimming pools and
21 tennis courts owe their existence to football.
But through the roundabout system of "loans"
the Stanford Board of Trustees has received
financial help from football returns in the gen
eral operation of the University. Branner Hall
was built by sweat from Stanford Red Machines.
Give football a back seat and you still would
n't solve the problem. It is foolish to believe
that the sport-crazed public, let alone our com
petitive youth, would not proffer some substi
tute by pressure of public demand.

Two Stanford authorities on this question—one a prominent
first-string football man, the other a well informed sports writer—
have taken their respective sides on this issue which draws
national interest at the close of every football year. Acting Cap
tain of the Stanford varsity, Grant Stone, is author of the "yes" ar
gument. —The Editor.

Give football a back seat and you still would

that the sport-crazed public, let alone our com

Two Stanford authorities on this question—one a prominent

AN EDITORIAL
What is the matter with football? From all
sides comes the rumor that it is assuming a
Frankenstein character. Surely anything so
prominent in the public eye as football is to be
criticized, but actually these evils are out
weighed by the benefits derived. Anyone "in
the know" or who has even considered the
facts in any detail can detect the "corny trill"
in the present denunciatory babble.
Football, under the regulations of some col
leges, does present quite a commercialized as
pect, but even in these institutions it does do
untold good—that is never mentioned. When
you stop to realize that there could be no minor
sports programs at all without the aid of foot
ball receipts, you must give another thought
before cutting off the feeding hand.
According to reliable statistics, 75 per cent of
all athletes must earn their way through col
lege: eliminate football and you throw the ma
jority of this group out in the world without the
opportunity of trying to get a university educa
tion. This leading American sport is full of
little-known and little recognized benefits; it
allows athletic departments to expand, to offer
more adequate and extensive facilities, and to
secure competent instructors in all fields.
Up to now all that has been mentioned has
been aimed at the benefits extended only to
those connected with athletics. Actually, the
greatest value of football has been to the uni
versities themselves. Not only have their indi
vidual reputations been enhanced, but football
has allowed the extension of old and the crea
tion of new academic departments. New living
quarters, new libraries, new theaters, new edu
cation buildings, and even new professors have
been made possible by gridiron proceeds. To
slight football would be to cut off the nose to
spite the face of the entire University program.
At Stanford, however, a clause in the found
ing grant —which prohibits the use of athletic
moneys for general University financing—has
largely limited the benefits of football to other
fields of athletics. Four swimming pools and
21 tennis courts owe their existence to football.
