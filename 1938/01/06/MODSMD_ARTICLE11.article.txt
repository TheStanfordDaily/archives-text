One plan for the de-emphasis of football which might some '
day prove a panacea tackles the problem of big money. It is
this.
A maximum price for football game tickets of approximately
one dollar would be set, making it no longer possible to charge
the absurdly inconsistent three to five dollars for the privilege
of watching two hours of football in an 80,000-seat stadium, with
one-third of the seats empty.
This action would produce manifold results. It would make
proselyting no longer necessary since no financial gain would
be made by having good ball clubs. It would stifle the players'
demands for a cut in the gravy because there would be no gravy.
It would enable more spectators to see the games.
Essentially it would take the big money out of the game, and
as "yes" says, in the big money lies the evil.
Admittedly, the plan is faulty. But in a whitecapped sea of
controversy it might be preferable to the outright guillotining of
the Frankenstein football or to the fattening of him by putting
players on a 40-hour week at 40 cents per hour.
