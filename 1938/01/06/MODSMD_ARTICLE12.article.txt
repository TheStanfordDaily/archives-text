American Colleges and Universities are in J
the show business. Just as definitely as if they
displayed the gaudy "come on's" of the circus
sideshow across the front on their administra
tion buildings, put barkers out in front, and
hired a troop of bearded women, our educa
tion institutions have gone Barnum and Bailey.
Their Great God is football; a sort of Frank
enstein monster they created and which now
controls them. Before our entire educational
system loses sight of its original purpose, some
thing must be done about football.
Examine its evils. Then try to justify the con
tinuation of such hypocrisy.
Proselyting—the buying of athletes—is an in
dictment no self respecting "amateur" sport can
defend. Every major university in the country,
including Stanford, finds one means or another,
either by waiving tuition or giving "scholar
ships" to induce athletes to attend the Univer
sity.
In addition the potential all-American may re
ceive offers of payment for his services. It may
be a job, usually not too difficult a job. In a
Southern California university promise of movie
work is an effective lure.
Since the post-season game craze has taken
over, the big money has been reason enough
for teams to demand concessions before they
would consent to play. At Stanford and Califor
nia the men received between 15 and 20 compli
mentary seats —worth 15 to 25 dollars —for their
play.
That the players make and receive such de
mands can be understood but that the admin
istrators of the University bury their heads in
the sand and watch football and its commer
cialism run the show is less intelligible.
Fortunately the condition at Stanford is more
healthy than at the majority of other universi
ties. Tuition scholarships for athletes are bought
by one of the organizations for that purpose,
but no tuition is waived. Payment after the
men reach Stanford is confined to help in se
curing jobs. Post-season game payment has
been limited to comps and expense money.
But because the Frankenstein has not gotten
a death grip at Stanford is no reason it should
not be viewed with alarm.
Something must be done about football. Few
people would advocate that the game be thrown
out entirely. Few would have football men paid
by the hour, but there might be less hypocrisy
in that method. A limitation on the gate re
ceipts, and thus elimination of the big money,
might be the panacea.
But whatever it is, the universities had best
stop fiddling around with their little stick of
dynamite and do something.

by the hour, but there might be less hypocrisy
in that method. A limitation on the gate re
ceipts, and thus elimination of the big money,
might be the panacea.
But whatever it is, the universities had best
stop fiddling around with their little stick of
dynamite and do something.
American Colleges and Universities are in J
the show business. Just as definitely as if they
displayed the gaudy "come on's" of the circus
sideshow across the front on their administra
tion buildings, put barkers out in front, and
hired a troop of bearded women, our educa
tion institutions have gone Barnum and Bailey.
Their Great God is football; a sort of Frank
enstein monster they created and which now
controls them. Before our entire educational
system loses sight of its original purpose, some
thing must be done about football.
Examine its evils. Then try to justify the con
tinuation of such hypocrisy.
Proselyting—the buying of athletes—is an in
dictment no self respecting "amateur" sport can
defend. Every major university in the country,
including Stanford, finds one means or another,
either by waiving tuition or giving "scholar
ships" to induce athletes to attend the Univer
sity.
In addition the potential all-American may re
ceive offers of payment for his services. It may
be a job, usually not too difficult a job. In a
Southern California university promise of movie
work is an effective lure.
Since the post-season game craze has taken
over, the big money has been reason enough
for teams to demand concessions before they
would consent to play. At Stanford and Califor
nia the men received between 15 and 20 compli
mentary seats —worth 15 to 25 dollars —for their
play.
That the players make and receive such de
mands can be understood but that the admin
istrators of the University bury their heads in
the sand and watch football and its commer
cialism run the show is less intelligible.
Fortunately the condition at Stanford is more
healthy than at the majority of other universi
ties. Tuition scholarships for athletes are bought
by one of the organizations for that purpose,
but no tuition is waived. Payment after the
men reach Stanford is confined to help in se
curing jobs. Post-season game payment has
been limited to comps and expense money.
But because the Frankenstein has not gotten
a death grip at Stanford is no reason it should
not be viewed with alarm.
Something must be done about football. Few
people would advocate that the game be thrown
out entirely. Few would have football men paid
by the hour, but there might be less hypocrisy
in that method. A limitation on the gate re
ceipts, and thus elimination of the big money,
might be the panacea.
