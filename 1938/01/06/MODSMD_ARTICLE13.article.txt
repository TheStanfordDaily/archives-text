WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP). —President Roosevelt asked Congress in
his annual budget message today to hold recovery and relief appropria
tions during the 1039 fiscal year to $1,138,304,000, the smallest since the
New Deal came into power, but he warned that he would seek additional
funds if economic conditions warrant.

The request represents a slash of<
$841,350,600 under the appropriation
for the current fiscal year and is
$1,876,285,912 under the 1937 out
lay.
The president asked for an out
right appropriation of $1,000,000,000
for direct relief and said he hoped
that it, together with minor recovery
outlays, New Deal construction and
other activities, plus co-operation
from private industry, would make
additional spending unnecessary.
"The economic situation may not
improve," he said, however, "and if
it does not I expect the approval of
Congress and the public for addi
tional appi'opriations if they become
necessary to save thousands of
American families from dire need."
His proposal to trim relief expend
itures came while a special Senate
committee inquired into the causes
of the trade slump, the scope of the
ever-increasing relief problem, and
possible legislative cures. Also it.
