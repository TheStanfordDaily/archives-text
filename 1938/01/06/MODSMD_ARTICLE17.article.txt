### 
A new chance for Stanford candid
camera fiends and aspiring scribblers
to turn their hobbies into pi-ofit
making channels is the contest re
cently announced jointly by the
Stanford Chaparral and the Palo
Alto Camera Shoppe.
Prizes have been offered by the
two organizations for the best inside
camera angles on campus sorority
and fraternity life. Pictures are ex
pected to have plenty of human in
terest and possibly to be of the type
seen in "Life" and other current
pictorial magazines. Planning, com
position, interest, and originality
plus ingenuity will all be considered
in the awarding of the prizes.
Stories will be considered on
much the same basis, except that
no prizes are offered, and should be
worked up in "feature story" style.
The deadline has been announced
for Friday for all copy and photo
graphs, and everyone on campus is
urged to participate.
