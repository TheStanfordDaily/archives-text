# Sutherland To Quit High Court Post
## New Deal Foe Resigns Under Sumners Act To Safeguard Health 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP). —
Associate Supreme Court Justice
George Sutherland in a letter to
President Roosevelt today an
nounced his retirement January 18.
Mr. Sutherland's letter to the
President stated that he was retir
ing under the Sumners Supreme
Court retirement act passed by

Congress last
year. It was this
act under which
J us t i c e Willis
Van Devanter
retired last
spring.
It was under
stood that Mr.
Sutherland took
the step because
he felt he had
reached the age
where he no
longer could
continue the ar-

duous duties of the Supreme Court
justice without sacrificing his health.
Conserves Health
It was understood that his general
physical condition at present was
good, but that he believed it might
break should he continue on the
court. He will be 76 in March.
His letter to the President said:
"My Dear Mr. President:
"Having reached the age of more
than 75 years, and having held my
commission as associate justice on
the Supreme Court of the United
States, and served in that court for
15 years, and thus being eligible for
retirement under the Sumners Act
of March 1, 1937, entitled 'An act to
provide for retirement of justices
of the Supreme Court,' I desire to
avail myself of the rights, privileges
and judicial service specified in that
act; and to that end I hereby retire
from regular active service on the
bench, this retirement to be effec
tive on and after Tuesday, the 18th
day of January, 1938.
"Very respectfully yours,
"George Sutherland."
Follows Van Devanter
Mr. Sutherland's retirement fol
lowed Van Devanter's by eight
months, near the conclusion of the
historic fight over President Roose
velt's historic judiciary reorganiza
tion plan.
The act provides that Supreme
Court justices may retire at the full
$20,000 per year salary and may be
called back to active service in lower
courts at the direction of the chief
justice.
Mr. Sutherland, one of the four
men born outside of the United
States ever to sit upon the supreme
bench, was enlisted firmly among
the conservative branch of the court
during his 15 years on the bench.
He was born in England March 25,
1862.
He was appointed in 1922 by Presi
dent Harding and from his first ap

George Sutherland in a letter to
President Roosevelt today an
nounced his retirement January 18.
Mr. Sutherland's letter to the
President stated that he was retir
ing under the Sumners Supreme
Court retirement act passed by

Congress last
year. It was this
act under which
J us t i c e Willis
Van Devanter
retired last
spring.
It was under
stood that Mr.
Sutherland took
the step because
he felt he had
reached the age
where he no
longer could
continue the ar-

duous duties of the Supreme Court
justice without sacrificing his health.
Conserves Health
It was understood that his general
physical condition at present was
good, but that he believed it might
break should he continue on the
court. He will be 76 in March.
His letter to the President said:
"My Dear Mr. President:
"Having reached the age of more
than 75 years, and having held my
commission as associate justice on
the Supreme Court of the United
States, and served in that court for
15 years, and thus being eligible for
retirement under the Sumners Act
of March 1, 1937, entitled 'An act to
provide for retirement of justices
of the Supreme Court,' I desire to
avail myself of the rights, privileges
and judicial service specified in that
act; and to that end I hereby retire
from regular active service on the
bench, this retirement to be effec
tive on and after Tuesday, the 18th
day of January, 1938.
"Very respectfully yours,
"George Sutherland."
Follows Van Devanter
Mr. Sutherland's retirement fol
lowed Van Devanter's by eight
months, near the conclusion of the
historic fight over President Roose
velt's historic judiciary reorganiza
tion plan.
The act provides that Supreme
Court justices may retire at the full
$20,000 per year salary and may be
called back to active service in lower
courts at the direction of the chief
justice.
Mr. Sutherland, one of the four
men born outside of the United
States ever to sit upon the supreme
bench, was enlisted firmly among
the conservative branch of the court
during his 15 years on the bench.
He was born in England March 25,
1862.
He was appointed in 1922 by Presi
dent Harding and from his first ap
