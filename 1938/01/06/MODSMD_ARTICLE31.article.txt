## THORNTON'S SMILE FADES away 
### 
Nort Thornton's optimistic smile
has suddenly changed to a look of
utter dismay. The reason . . . Nort
has lost four aces from his 1938
varsity swimming deck.
Just when everything was look
ing brightest for the best swimming
season in Stanford history the in
eligibility bolt came down from the
sky and struck the Indian swim
ming forces. A sure-fire defense of
the conference crown won last year
has turned into an outside chance.
In ail probability, the red-cheeked
mentor of the Card water forces will
lose Roy YVinkelman, All-American
diver; Don Towne, one of the best
short-distance breast-strokers in the
world; and Dick Clarke and Jack
Vibert, ace sprinters.
