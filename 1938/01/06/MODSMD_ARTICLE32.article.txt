Towne and Vibert are trying now
to clear up their ineligibility and
may, by some slim chance, pull
back onto the team. "Appollo"
Winkelman has not as yet regis
tered this quarter but Nort is still
hoping his 1940 Olympic Games
candidate will come back into the
fold. Clarke is in school and is eli
gible but at the present time is un
able to talk his family into a three
months swimming career.
At the end of last quarter, Nort
had characterized his team as "the
best in the history of Stanford . . .
even greater than the '32 team."
The Cards will still be strong in
the distances with Dave Rider and
Winfield Needham,' and the back
stroke with Hal Weatherbe and Ma
son Letteau. The loss of Vibert and
Clarke will ruin Stanford's free
style relay team and hit the sprint
ing forces a deadly blow. The loss
of Towne will nullify the Indians'
strength in the breaststroke and
medley relay. And the loss of Wink
will cost the Farm amphibians five
points in all dual meets and more
than five in the conference meet.
