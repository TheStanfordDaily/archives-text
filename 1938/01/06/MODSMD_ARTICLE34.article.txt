# Tracksters Prepare For Indoor Meet
## Soph Jumper Clears 6.3 in Monday Drill; Dink Shifts Runners 
### 
An indoor track meet in San Fran
cisco's Civic Auditorium scheduled
for the end of this month has set
Stanford's trackmen to doing hard
work almost before their "Happy
New Year" has worn off.
Originally two indoor meets were
plannedâ€”now one is the maximum
with a likelihood that even that one
may not materialize.
However, if there is going to be
an indoor meet Stanford will be well
represented and if there is not the
track team will be in good shape be
fore the spring rains which are due
too soon.
Wulff Clears 0.3
Russ Wulff, sophomore high jump
er, cleared 6 feet 3 Inches Monday
in spite of his poor condition and
will be good for another 5 inches
before the season is over, opines
Track Coach Dink Templeton.
Dick Carew and Johnny Hewitt,
out'of school last quarter, came out
for the first time and will strengthen
the track team in the sprints and
the hurdles. Footballer and N.C.A.A.
discus champion Pete Zagar will be
another welcome addition to the
track squad.
Since Monday, Templeton has been
working his distance men on speed
work and his sprinters on the longer
events. So far the results have been
very sickening to some, but will
produce favorable results when they
count most.
Templeton Confident
Templeton is sure that Captain Ray
Malott will break Ben Eastman's
world record of 46.4 in the quarter
mile on the first good day next
spring. This may appear to be over
optimistic on Dink's part, but he
contends that Malott is in better
shape now than Ben was at this time
of the season in the year that he set
the record.
In the same event, Templeton has
Carl Mahurin working to get his
time down to 47 seconds before the
season is over. Mahurin has already
done 49.8 this season.
