# Papoose Hoop Line-Up Set for Marin Tussle
## 
### 
Following; yesterday's hour-and-a-half long scrimmage, Coach Wytze
Gorter announced Stanford's starting line-up for the Papoose-Mann Jun
ior College battle Friday night in Encina Pavilion.
Acting Captain Dick Taylor, giant center, will open at the pivot spot,
with Don Williams and Bill Masters lining up in front of him at the for-

ward berths. Eddie DeMoss and Bob
Stone will be the starting guards.
This is the same line-up that started
the yearlings' first game with Marin,
which they lost, 47-45.
Coach Gorter's charges will be
out to avenge that defeat, the only
one on their record, and a hard
fought contest should be • forth
coming. Marin plays a fast game and
the frosh will have to round into
better shape than they showed in
yesterday's scrimmage if they ex
pect to turn back the invaders.
Rustiness Explained
The Christmas vacation lay-off
probably accounts for its rustiness
and Gorter expects the team to
smooth out.
Saturday night, the peagreeners
tangle with George Washington
High School in the local Pavilion.
The frosh, thus far, have presented
a well-balanced team with no ob
vious weak position.
High-Scorer
In the three games played, a dif
ferent player has been Stanford
high-point man in each one, show
ing a diversified scoring attack.
Bill Marshall, 5 foot 8 sub for
ward who walked off with high
scoring honors in the first Marin
game, will be ready to repeat his 20-
point performance against the jay
sees. Bill Rumbley, who doesn't
have to tilt his head much to look
the giant Taylor in the eye, is a
capable substitute center.
