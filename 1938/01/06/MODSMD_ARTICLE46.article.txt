# Loss of Card Tank Stars Sinks Hopes
## Winklemann, Star Diver Other Veterans Fail To Return to Team 
### ARCH JENKINS 
A duke's mixture of ineligible J
men, incompleted courses, and fin- |
ancial troubles is wreaking havoc!
with what originally had the mak- :
ings of another Stanford Coast cham- j
pionship swimming team.
Foremost among the doubtful men '
are Roy Winklemann, conference j
diving chamlp, Don Towne, Dick
Clarke, and Jack Vibert. "Wink" is â€¢
having his share of woe scraping to- I
gether the almighty $115 and pos- I
sibly may not be able to negotiate |
enough loans in time to qualify j
himself. Low grades caught both Vi- J
bert and Towne.
Clarke Out
Towne may be reinstated by the j
scholarship Committee today, but j
Clarke's dad insists that his young 1
sprinter son won't be allowed to J
compete until spring quarter at the
earliest. "Vibert, the squad's
ace sprint man, has an incomplete
lab course to his discredit and will
also be out at least until spring
term.
Both the U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. meets
come this quarter and only the Cal
affair is left until spring. But a sud- j
den burst of knowledge by the in- j
eligibles will undoubtedly help the i
Card chances in the conference meet '
as well as the Cal swim.
First Meet
Of nearly 30 men reporting and
eligible, Coach Nort Thornton is try
ing to evolve enough talent to round
out a winning team. First meet of
the season will be with the unusually
strong frosh on Jan. 22.
Captain Dave Rider, two-event j
All-American, and Winfield Need
ham. should clean up the coast in the j
440 and possibly the 220. Needham
was also an Ail-American choice.
John Brahtz, last year's intramural
high point man, is now the best eli
gible sprinter, with Bill Tench close
behind. These two may develop and
along with Frank Bowling, frosh
captain last year, and Bob Plate,
soph water polo man, should form a
fair sprint team.
Hal Weatherbe, Big Swim back
stroke winner, looks good in his
event, arid Bill Hatch has moved up
in place of the absent Towne to lead
the breast-stroke crew.
