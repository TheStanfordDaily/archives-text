## Son of the Rising Sun 
### 
WHEN the Japanese consul at San Francisco
came down to Stanford nearly two months
ago to address the International Club, no one
was particularly surprised to hear him say that
China had forced Japan into the present un
declared war in the Orient.
Though Mr. Hirota emphasized that he spoke
as a private citizen, his audience remembered
his official position in the Japanese govern
ment. When he claimed that Chinese military
action had precipitated the war, was prolonging
hostilities, and that only Japan could check the
spread of Communism in the Far East, there
was no indignation.
But when Professor Yamato Ichihashi spoke
Tuesday night in Memorial Hall, his record au
dience expected something different. A Stan
ford man had gone abroad, as professors do; he
would give an impartial survey of a burning
world question, his listeners thought.
Instead, what they heard was a rehash of the
opinions given by Japan's consul. China started
the war . . . Japan must save the Orient from
Communism . . . Japan is seeking peace . . .

Japan is the victim of propaganda.
A few persons left the hall, indignant. Others,
less idealistic, still felt cheated. Reports of Chi
na's race to achieve national unity against the
threat of invasion, the lack of communistic in
fluence in the national government might be
propaganda. So might be the past enmity re
ported between Chiang Kai-shek and the Com
munists in North China.
But they had heard no new arguments to
prove this.
Today this indignation and disappointment
may have faded. Little else could be expected
of a man whose country was at war. An Ameri
can would uphold his country in the same situ
ation. God is always on "our" side.
Perhaps the Committee on Public Exercises
should have arranged a forum on such a con
troversial subject, with at least two speakers, so
that both sides of the question could be pre
sented.
But one thing stands out. Although Mr. Ichi
hashi is an American professor and scholar, a
student of history and international relations, he
is even more a Son of the Rising Sun.
