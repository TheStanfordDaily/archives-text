BRITISH children are very lucky. They like
to laugh and because they look so pretty
laughing the government gives them all sorts
of surprises to keep them in a good humor. For
some time now King George VI and his cabinet
have been worried no end because some of
the youngsters have hardly cracked a smile.
Last week, according to the Minnesota Daily,
the British home defense discovered a way to
restore their mirth, and at the same time to
solve a vital problem—how to persuade little
children from two to four years old to wear
gas masks in case of attack.
The solution must have been advanced by
one of England's most brilliant civil service men
—for it smacks of true genius. The little tots
are made to think that they are being taught
some new sort of game when the ugly black
masks are fitted to their heads.
As an experiment British officials took a load
of masks to "Babies' Castle" in Kent where 70
youngsters proved willing guinea pigs. First to
be honored was four-year-old Cyril Wilkes, who
looked wonderingly at the heavy rubber "face,"
its mica window and metal container full of evil
smelling purifying chemicals.
As he put it on, an attendant nurse started to
laugh, and, seeing the obviously humorous as
pects of the situation, 69 other youngsters joined
in the mirth. While they were being fitted Cyril
strutted about proudly. The experiment was
obviously successful.

"Now," in the words of ou? Minnesota con
temporaries, "all the English need worry about
in case of an air raid is a way to make little
children scream with delight as shrapnel tears
into their flesh."—J. R.
