# BULL SESSION
## IT'S A SLACK WEEK 
### 
ABOUT this time of the year it is customary for
college newspapers to run sweet little items tell
ing how grand it feels to be wrapped around the old
desk playing hounds and hare with group behavior
among the polyps. Tradition has it that the returning
journalist must do his part to convince the students
that they really didn't want another date with that
blond they met Christmas. Tradition also has it that
one glimpse of red-tiled roof is enough to settle us
back in the groove; that one look into a time schedule
fires us with new energy, and sends us out searching
for an intellectual wildcat to kick in a tender spot.
But as I sit here playing verbal chopsticks on a
delinquent typewriter, I feel strangely out of sym
pathy with the faith of our fathers. In the long run,
it's marvelous to be in college; these are the days
when we lay up memories we shall treasure always;
forsan et olim haec meminisse juvabit; and all that.
But just at the moment it takes more than a look at
the calendar to convince me that playing leapfrog with
concepts is the best indoor sport.
* * * *
There is no way of dodging the fact that the post-
Christmas slump takes a lot of the joy out of pursuit
of just the right adjective. And I can't bring myself
to writing a lot of sweet, Wednesday-Afternoon-Club
stuff about how grand it is to be back in harness. It
would certainly need disinfecting.
But when we declare that topic out of bounds, we
deprive The Daily of the one thing that is left to it
in these dark days of dreaming and drifting. It is not
without regret that I j\mk the subject; and it is not
from any abortive sense of intellectual integrity. It is
just that I am sure I would be violently sick if I
took it.
* * * *
y\ ND that, in the present psychological slump, leaves
nothing to fill this hole on the back page. The
campus wants to retire into a corner and figure out
where it butched on that last date. It wants to brood
over what a workout Econ is going to giv£ it, and
how much sleep it will have to miss over Poli Sci.
And I have no desire to intrude on such sacred
moments. I shrink from crashing in when some uncer
tain student is holding blissful tryst with the memory
of the head that was on his shoulder.
Of course. Dr. Ichihashi opened the way for a beau
tiful scrap when he gave his unusual views on obtain
ing peace and concord among Asia's hordes. And
Miss Yost's pessimistic view of woman's power of
self control might bear discussion. But nobody would
waste time on such minor matters when they can
dream of New Year's Eve.
# * * *
That explains why today I do not ride abroad re
dressing wrongs and putting unsocialized dragons in
their place. Instead, I sit here and meditate upon the
glory that was Christmas, and upon the bleakness
that is The Daily. The Business staff hasn't fixed the
broken window and it's cold as the worlds charity in
here. Somebody has borrowed my overcoat.
Isn't it rrand to b< back in harness?

But when we declare that topic out of bounds, we
deprive The Daily of the one thing that is left to it
in these dark days of dreaming and drifting. It is not
without regret that I j\mk the subject; and it is not

just that I am sure I would be violently sick if I
took it.

nothing to fill this hole on the back page. The
campus wants to retire into a corner and figure out
where it butched on that last date. It wants to brood
over what a workout Econ is going to giv£ it, and
how much sleep it will have to miss over Poli Sci.

That explains why today I do not ride abroad re
dressing wrongs and putting unsocialized dragons in
their place. Instead, I sit here and meditate upon the
glory that was Christmas, and upon the bleakness
that is The Daily. The Business staff hasn't fixed the
broken window and it's cold as the worlds charity in
here. Somebody has borrowed my overcoat.

ABOUT this time of the year it is customary for
college newspapers to run sweet little items tell
ing how grand it feels to be wrapped around the old
desk playing hounds and hare with group behavior
among the polyps. Tradition has it that the returning
journalist must do his part to convince the students
that they really didn't want another date with that
blond they met Christmas. Tradition also has it that
one glimpse of red-tiled roof is enough to settle us
back in the groove; that one look into a time schedule
fires us with new energy, and sends us out searching
for an intellectual wildcat to kick in a tender spot.
But as I sit here playing verbal chopsticks on a
delinquent typewriter, I feel strangely out of sym
pathy with the faith of our fathers. In the long run,
it's marvelous to be in college; these are the days
when we lay up memories we shall treasure always;
forsan et olim haec meminisse juvabit; and all that.
But just at the moment it takes more than a look at
the calendar to convince me that playing leapfrog with
concepts is the best indoor sport.

There is no way of dodging the fact that the post-

of just the right adjective. And I can't bring myself
