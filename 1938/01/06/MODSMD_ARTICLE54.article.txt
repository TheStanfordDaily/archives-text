# INSIDE CHINA

(The following excerpts, the first, of a series to
appear in The Daily, are from letters written
from Changsha, China, by Dr. Phillips F. Greene,
dean of the Hunan-Yale Medical School; his wife,
Ruth, and their cousin and associate, Dr. Lois D.
Greene. The women and children were evacuated
on December .'5O. 1937, to Hong Kong and Manila,
but Dr. Phillips Greene plans to remain.—Ed.)
By Ruth Greene—November 15, 1937: "We landed
in Changsha . . . after the rude jar of arriving off
Shanghai August 14, since known as "bloody Satur
day" . . . Within a week of our being here, Canton
was being heavily bombed; the railway, that one last
great artery of China, bombed again and again; Han
kow to the north of us bombed; Hengchow and Liling
to the south and east.
How we have escaped so far we hardly know. But
six times we have had the air-raid alarm. When
Japanese planes are sighted crossing into Hunan the
signal is relayed on to the cities in their path. The
first alarm signal is a long shrieking siren. At that
signal everybody stx-eaks for cover. Every family or
group that can afford it has a dugout. This lovely Yale
campus is scooped full of them—fifty.
"The second signal, a series of imperative short
blasts, means 'stay where you are.' The enemy is
practically on top of us. After that, there can be no
running anywhere. The 'all clear' signal is a steady
three-minute blast. We all emerge from cellar or
dugout and take up our rice bowls where we left off,
cramped, but with perhaps a new sense of the prec
iousriess of life.
"... With the destruction in the north of the
great educational and cultural centers, and the perse
cution of the intellectuals, Changsha has become the
rallying ground for the intellectual forces of China
. . . Japan knows the brilliance and power of these
new leaders of China. She sees how the whole thought
and face of China is being made over by them. That
is the bitter explanation of Japan's attack on China's
intellectuals ..."
Dr. Phillips Greene—November 15: "All bombings
in Hunan have included machine gunning the civilian
population; as ruthless and futile as anything I have
seen. Over 20 such have been patients here. This
machine gunning has not been by the whole squadron,
but usually just one or two planes, as if not a set
Japanese policy, but the work of young 'patriotic'
firebrands. The innocent die just the same.
"... The nearest to an understanding of Japanese
policy has come through a semi-official Japanese
document written for private circulation among Japa
nese upper circles some years ago. It contains three
main theses.
"I. The whole world is a rotten mess. In this
"ness ,the people of Asia are the underdogs . . . The
exclusion of the mongol race from the human family
if races is resented deeply . . . our U. S. constitu
:ion and our exclusion act are mentioned.
"11. Japan is the divinely appointed country to lead
lie world out of this mess. It is the real vision of many
Japanese.
"111. Japan cannot fulfill this destiny without the
.'omplete co-operation of China . . . Co-operation can
:ome willingly or as a subject nation. Apparently the
second one is the method they trust in.
". . .1 know that many in America feel the
injustice of China's present situatioh, and yet would
question the right of taking up arms in her behalf.
There can be no question of the benefit of helping in
this and similar work in China, and we arc hoping
more than we find it easy to say that American
friends will conlribute to this work in this emergency
year sufficiently to carry it through."
