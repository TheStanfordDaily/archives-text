# "Arrowsmith" Pattern Used By Cronin
## 
### 
Probably because it comes from
England, the land where nobody
criticizes anything, A. J. Cronin's
best-seller, "The Citadel," has x-ais
ed a great hullabaloo.
Yet somehow one reads with the
feeling that all this has been done

before — by Sin
clair Lewis, to be
exact, in "Arrow
smith." So close
ly does Cronin's
novel parallel
Lewis', that the
one might be
merely a reset
ting of the other
against a British
background.
Alex Manson is

a young and honest doctor, strug
gling against a lethargic public and
a vicious system. So was Martin
Arrowsmith. Alex Manson finally
gives in to the system. So did Mar
tin Arrowsmith. The death of his
wife Christine turns Alex Manson
back to the true faith. Martin Ar
rowsmith reacted in exactly the
same way to the death of his wife.
Manson even talks like Arrow
smith.
It is of course unlikely that Dr.
Cronin consciously had Lewis'
noel in mind while wx*iting "The
Citadel," but one does finish the
book with a bored feeling of having
heard it all before, and much bet
ter told. The Individual vs. The
System has been done and done, sev
eral times with a medical tinge; and
the mere fact that this time it hap
pens to be English does not seem
sufficient to make it a best-seller.
"The Citadel's" vogue in England,
where the last man to suggest that
something was not quite right must
have passed away a good 300 years
ago, is understandable; but not in
this country, a country whose eager
passion for The Bitter Truth should
have long ago left it impervious to
such bombshells from the popular
press.

Turtles in China are regarded as
the most depraved of animals. Only
one invective gives a Chinese great
er offense than to call him a turtle.
That is to call him the descendant
of one.
