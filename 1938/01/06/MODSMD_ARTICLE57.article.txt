## WHAT IS TRUTH? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Because China moved troops
around in her own territory, China
is responsible for the present Sino-
Japanese conflict.
Presumably then, on the basis of
Professor Ichihashi's reasoning,
Japan will feel completely justified
in "visiting" these shores to "pre
serve the peace" the next time an
army regiment moves out of the San
Francisco Presidio.
And just why should Professor
Ichihashi object to a nationalistic
movement in China, particularly
since Japan quite obviously has been
cooking up intense nationalism for
some time?
"Japan has no territorial ambition
in China or elsewhere," he adds.
Of course, "China or elsewhere"

does NOT include Manchukuo (or
Manchuria), the five northern prov
inces of China, now in Japan's pos
session, Shanghai, the area around
Nanking, the technically mandated
and technically unfortified islands in
the Pacific, Canton, Southern China
and Korea, which, I believe, hasn't
always been Japanese territory.
And while he is about the business
of justifying the conduct of the em
pire of the Rising Sun, it might be
interesting if he would explain the
terms on which Japan will gracious
ly accept peace when Generalissimo
Chiang quits his disgraceful efforts
to defend his country.
