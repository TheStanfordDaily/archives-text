# Kahn Named To Direct Winter Show
## Slaters Debate Choice; Farm May See Debut Of Flavin Comedy 
### 
Hal Kahn was selected to direct
the first student produced winter
show at the meeting of Stanford
Stagers in the Little 1 heater yester
day. The director of last fall's Big
Game Gaieties will fill the position
left open by the resignation of Bud
Cady.
Dramatic Council will meet at 4
o'clock today to select a vehicle for
the new society's production. Among
the plays being seriously considered
at the present time are "Boy Meets
Girl," Phillip Barry's "Spring
Dance," "Excursion," a current
Broadway success, and "Blue Jeans,"
a comedy by Martin Flavin.
Flavin Play Offered
Mr. Flavin, who is giving a course
in play writing here this quarter,
has offered Stagers the premiere of
his show. Approached about the
possibility of his directing his own
work, the playwright excused him
self on the ground that he does not
have the extra tinne.
Chief difficulty facing the organi
zation hi presenting the show is that
most of theis members are busy
working on the two productions of
the Department of Speech and
Drama, "The Governor's Wife" and
"A Winter's Tale." As a result, new
comers to Stanford dramatics will
be given opportunities to win their
spurs in the winter show.
Tryouts Scheduled
Anyone who is interested in taking
part, even though not a member of
Stagers, is urged to report at the
tryouts which will be held next
week, according to new Director
Kahn. Men and women with junior
college and high school dramatic ex
perience have an excellent chance to
be in the cast.
Since all members of Dramatic
Council are officers of Stagers ex
cept Student Manager Chuck Fon
tius and Dramatic Manager Clay
McDaniel, the Council's choice will
be accepted as final. President Ray
Lyman Wilbur has approved the
plan of the student dramatic society
producing a show during winter
quarter.
