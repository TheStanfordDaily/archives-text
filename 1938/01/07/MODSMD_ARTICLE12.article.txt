# No 'Prima Donnas' In Salzburg Group Artists Look, Act, Parts
## 
### 
The Salzburg Opera Guild, which
will sing in Memorial Hall next
Tuesday evening, was founded by
Paul Czonka, a young Viennese mu
sician, in 1934 for the purpose of per
fecting ensemble singing and syn
chronizing music and drama.
All the artists are young, and each,
in order to gain admittance to the
guild, must act and look, as well as
sing, the part he has been selected to
portray.
To capture the exact mood of each
production, the group isolated itself
in the Austrian Tyrol during the re
hearsal period, and each member of
the company was required to live
and work in the same community.
Besides Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte,"
which the Guild will sing next Tues
day, their repertoire includes Ros
sini's "The Marriage Market"; "Lc
Pauvre Matelot" and "Angelique,"
modern French works; and Krenek's
special version of Monteverdi's "The
Coronation of Poppea."
According to Czonka, "We have
gathered together a group of young
artists, artists who are willing to

submerge their personalities into
giving a performance with as fine i
an ensemble as it is possible to pre
pare.
"No 'prima donna' airs are per- ,
mitted. Everyone must work for |

the good of all. For three years we
have lived and dreamed together in
a sort of artistic 'rapport' and now
have brought to America the results
erf our arduous labors."
Hearing that there was a growing
appreciation for the non-conven
tional opera in America, the Guild
came over last fall and made its
debut in New York, starting a na
tion-wide tour.
Tickets are on sale in the Concert
Series Office in the Old Union and
at Keeble's in Palo Alto for $2.50,
$2, and $1.50.
