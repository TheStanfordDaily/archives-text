# Pink Animals Cheer Convalescents
## Wolo Creates Whimsical Paintings for Home 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Hit, name is Wolo and he paints
! pictures on the walls of the Con
! valescent Home. Big, bright, whim
sical pictures of pink llamas, and
black sea lions, and red ants.
During the month in which the
slim, Swiss-born artist has been
working at the murals, he has cov
ered the walls of two rooms with
original observations in terms of
animal pictures. He expects to finish
! next week. Known simply as "Wolo"
I in professional life, a career which
j has included cartooning for the San
Francisco Chronicle, the artist got
his name from his little sister who
stumbled on the pronounciation of
his real one.
Eating Is Important
His gray eyes twinkling, his brown
cheeks crinkling into a grin, Wolo
will tell you that the most important
thing to his animals is eating. "All
these children must gain weight and
grow healthy and .strong," their nim
ble little creator explains in his bro
i ken Continental English. "I myself
} have gained nineteen pounds just
| working here, and one of the little
convalescent boys wrote to Santa
Claus that he is 'getting as fat as
Wolo's cow'.'
First of all, among the pictures in
I the dining room, the Helpful Mon
key tips a bowl of creamy milk into
the grateful mouth of a striped zebra
—the Convalescent Zebra, in fact,
who is laid up with a broken leg.
Then there is a fat, black Mama Sea-
Lion who sits on an ice-cake and
feeds her "kids" from a bowl of
oatmeal.
Personality Pictures
In addition to the happy eating
idea, the Puck-like artist, dressed in
a blue jersey shirt and a bright
plaid scarf, has given each figure a
personality, each picture a philo
sophical meaning. "Spiritual food
for after dinner," he calls it. There
are the blue and pink humming
birds, who smile happily because
they are off relief now, and hard at
work.
The tricky fox has been endowed
with a new personality. Sprouting
wings and surrounded by a halo,
Reynard is asking nicely for a big,
purple bunch of grapes. "The fox
is going to get these grapes from the
bird by fair means instead of foul,"
Wolo says.
There i.s a henna-colored lady bug
who, the artist thinks, "wears a very
impudent smirk." She is, in fact, up
to no good.
With a thin, wiry finger, Wolo
points out a pink horse, with a
bleached platinum mane adorned by
blue bows. "This worldly looking
damie," he nods wisely, "is the Nude
Horse. She got that way in Holly
wood. She typifies carnal content
ment and nibbles on a corsage of
expensive flowers." ,
In the line of spiritual content
ment, Wolo has drawn the Heavenly
Pink Llama, follower of the Ferdi
nand cult, who sniffs daintily at a
blue flower—the face of one of the
little girls in the Home who collabo
rated with the artist.
There is a pink sea-horse, sucking
her finger coyly, and flirting with a
sappy sucker fish. "This one," ob
serves Wolo, "is not as innocent as
she looks—l can tell you that right
now. She is a sort of submarine
Little Audrey," he adds gravely.
The artist shakes his head ruefully
over the plight of a gawky yellow,
brown-spotted giraffe who is bend
ing over a pool and gazing sadly into
the eyes of a fish. "A hopeless love
affair," Wolo sighs.
There is a butterfly with a bushy
mane. "The butterfly is like me,"
the artist chuckles pointing to his
own brown thatch. "He needs a
haircut."
Finally, all of Wolo's animals live
together in blissful contentment, the
rabbit lying down with a kindly lion,
the great and small all helping each
other and sharing alike. With a
sweeping gesture, Wolo explains
their ideal state: "Not one of these
animals has a red cent. Here, there is
no strife, no squabbling, and abso
lutely no politics."
