# Disney Viewed By Muralist
## 
### 
"What do you think of Walt
Disney?"
! When Wolo is asked this, he clears
; his throat and thinks a moment. He
knows he's on the spot.
"Our work may look alike." he
| begins, "but his is more of a tech
nical process than mine, He is a
cartoonist. I am not."
Obliged to speak for himself, he
says his animal characters are per
sonalized, that they have none of
the slapstick and unnatural contor
tion typical of the animated car
toons.
"My drawings are for children,"
he says. "And children enjoy ani
mal pictures that have personality.
When they see conventionalized
animalsâ€”poof! They aren't inter
ested."
