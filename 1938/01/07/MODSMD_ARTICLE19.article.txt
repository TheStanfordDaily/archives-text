# S. F. Man Presents Murals as Memorial
## 
### 
Bread and butter and sweaters
| and stockings are what most of the
Convalescent Home's income must
pay for. So Mrs. Ruth Atwood, su
i perintendent, was happy two
! months ago when the home was
, presented with cheery murals for
j the dining room.
The room had just been enlarged,
so that it now accommodates 30 of
the youngsters. Few windows left
the place dark, and Mrs. Atwood
doesn't like gloomy dining rooms.
She thought murals would brighten
the walls and keep the little con
valescents happy at meals.
Committee women began making
suggestions. Why not glue holly
hocks on the walls and varnish over
them? suggested one. Mrs. Atwood
wanted murals. Cut out wallpaper
figures and stick them on the
walls, beamed another. Mrs. At
wood wanted murals.
| "We waited eight years for the
, linoleum. I guess we can wait six
I months for what we want now," she
; told them.
Come the Murals
The rest of the story has all the
precision of a comic-strip thriller.
Peter Blanchard, retired San Fran
t cisco insurance man, and his wife
j visited the home with some friends,
j Mrs. Blanchard was impressed.
A week later she suddenly become
; ill. Lying in her hospital bed, she
j kept telling her husband what a
I wonderful work the Stanford Con
valescent Home was doing. "I wish
| we could help them in some way,"
I she told him.
