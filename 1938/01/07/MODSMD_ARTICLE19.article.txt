# S. F. Man Presents Murals as Memorial
## 
### 
Bread and butter and sweaters
| and stockings are what most of the
Convalescent Home's income must
pay for. So Mrs. Ruth Atwood, su
i perintendent, was happy two
! months ago when the home was
, presented with cheery murals for
j the dining room.
The room had just been enlarged,
so that it now accommodates 30 of
the youngsters. Few windows left
the place dark, and Mrs. Atwood
doesn't like gloomy dining rooms.
She thought murals would brighten
the walls and keep the little con
valescents happy at meals.
Committee women began making
suggestions. Why not glue holly
hocks on the walls and varnish over
them? suggested one. Mrs. Atwood
wanted murals. Cut out wallpaper
figures and stick them on the
walls, beamed another. Mrs. At
wood wanted murals.
| "We waited eight years for the
, linoleum. I guess we can wait six
I months for what we want now," she
; told them.
Come the Murals
The rest of the story has all the
precision of a comic-strip thriller.
Peter Blanchard, retired San Fran
t cisco insurance man, and his wife
j visited the home with some friends,
j Mrs. Blanchard was impressed.
A week later she suddenly become
; ill. Lying in her hospital bed, she
j kept telling her husband what a
I wonderful work the Stanford Con
valescent Home was doing. "I wish
| we could help them in some way,"
I she told him.
She died after a week's illness.
As a memorial to his wife, Mr.
Blanchard decided on a gift to this
home that had so impressed her.
What did Mrs. Atwood think would
be most suitable, he asked.
The superintendent had attended
a San Francisco exhibit of animals
murals by an artist named Wolo
(pronounced vo-lo). Here was a
chance to get murals and animate
the dining halls.
"Some people wanted big circus
animals," says Mrs. Atwood. '"But I
told them we wanted peace, content
ment, and animals happily eating."
Full of sympathy was the kindly
woman when a tired, undernour
ished Wolo reported for work. Un
employed for some time, the artist
had been sick and had lost much
weight. The first thing Mrs. Atwood
did was to give him a glass of milk.
Now he has his "nourishment" ev
ery afternoon — graham cracker
sandwiches and milk.
The main dining room is finished
now, walls covered with happy ani
mals. The murals should last a
long time. All Mrs. Atwood has to
do is treat them once a year with
beaten egg-white.

She thought murals would brighten
the walls and keep the little con
valescents happy at meals.
Committee women began making
suggestions. Why not glue holly
hocks on the walls and varnish over
them? suggested one. Mrs. Atwood
wanted murals. Cut out wallpaper
figures and stick them on the
walls, beamed another. Mrs. At
wood wanted murals.

Come the Murals
The rest of the story has all the

Peter Blanchard, retired San Fran
t cisco insurance man, and his wife
j visited the home with some friends,
j Mrs. Blanchard was impressed.
A week later she suddenly become
; ill. Lying in her hospital bed, she
j kept telling her husband what a
I wonderful work the Stanford Con
valescent Home was doing. "I wish
| we could help them in some way,"
I she told him.
She died after a week's illness.
As a memorial to his wife, Mr.
Blanchard decided on a gift to this
home that had so impressed her.
What did Mrs. Atwood think would
be most suitable, he asked.
The superintendent had attended
a San Francisco exhibit of animals
murals by an artist named Wolo
(pronounced vo-lo). Here was a
chance to get murals and animate
the dining halls.
"Some people wanted big circus
animals," says Mrs. Atwood. '"But I
told them we wanted peace, content
ment, and animals happily eating."
Full of sympathy was the kindly
woman when a tired, undernour
ished Wolo reported for work. Un
employed for some time, the artist
had been sick and had lost much
weight. The first thing Mrs. Atwood
did was to give him a glass of milk.
Now he has his "nourishment" ev
ery afternoon — graham cracker
sandwiches and milk.
The main dining room is finished
now, walls covered with happy ani
mals. The murals should last a
long time. All Mrs. Atwood has to
do is treat them once a year with
beaten egg-white.
Bread and butter and sweaters
| and stockings are what most of the
Convalescent Home's income must
pay for. So Mrs. Ruth Atwood, su
i perintendent, was happy two
! months ago when the home was
, presented with cheery murals for
j the dining room.
The room had just been enlarged,
so that it now accommodates 30 of
the youngsters. Few windows left
the place dark, and Mrs. Atwood
doesn't like gloomy dining rooms.
