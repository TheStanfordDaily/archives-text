# Fund To Continue Rixford Activities
## 
### 
Designed to provide either free
hospital beds for indigent patients
or to carry on medical research, an
endowment fund was launched yes
terday by Stanford Hospital nurses
and friends of Dr. Emmett Rixford,
internationally known surgeon and
member of the Stanford Medical
School faculty who died Sunday in
Boston.
Dr. Rixford, whose funeral serv
ices are being held today at St.
Luke's Episcopal Church in San
Francisco, devoted much of his
time during his 46 years of med
ical practice in San Francisco to the
care of the sick poor. He was a vis
iting surgeon at the Stanford Hospi
tal's clinics, and often gave his
services to indigents at the San
Francisco City and County Hospi
tal.
The memorial fund has been cre
ated to carry on his philanthropic
work. Decision for final use of the
endowment will be left with his
family.
