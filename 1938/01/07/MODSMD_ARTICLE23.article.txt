## Stanford Professor Tells World Affairs Group Post – war Relalions 
### 
Limitations of American under
standing of the French idealistic
point of view has strained French-
American relations during post-war
years, Professor Albert Guerard, of
the Stanford English department,
declared last night at the meeting of
the World Affairs Group at the
home of Mrs. David Starr Jordan.
Refusal of this country to enter
Ihe League of Nations was de
scribed by Professor Guerard as a
weakening of the power of the
Treaty of Versailles and as the first
factor contributing to divided re
lations between the two nations.
Disarmament efforts at the Wash
ington Confei'ence in 1922, in which
France was not given a naval ratio
equal with England, Japan, and the
United States, did not allay Gallic
suspicions, he said.
France, counting on the idealism
of Wilson, was disillusioned by the
American policy of non-commitment
and isolation in foreign affairs, Gue
rard stated.
On the question of war debts, 'the
French believe that a common un
dertaking ought to have been made
at a common expense," while Gue
rard also believes that French good
will towards America was lost by
what he described as "America's re
fusal to consider the matter except
as a purely business transaction."
In conclusion, Guerard advocated
that the United States should re
sume its natural position of leader
ship in a normal world. By doing
that we would find France on our
side."
