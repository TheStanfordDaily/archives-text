# Frosh Set For Marin Tilt Tonight
## Papoose Seek Revenge For Vacation Loss Taylor, Acting Captain, To Hold Center Post; Starters Are Named 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's strong freshman bas- |
ketball team goes a-gunning for a
little bit of revenge tonight in En
oina Pavilion when the Papooses
take on Marin Junior College in a j
return game. Action starts at 7:30
o'clock.
Murin handed the yearlings a 47-
45 defeat on the latter's Christmas ;
vacation road trip, and the Indian i
babes have been eyeing the rematch
eagerly. Their mistakes of the pre
vious game, which was their first of
Ihe season, have been ironed out,
and if the frosh play the game of
which they are capable, they have a
better than even chance to reverse
the previous verdict.
Marin Stars
The stars of Coach Louis H.
"Scoop" Carlson<'s Marin outfit are
Morrison, a sharpshooting forward
who scored 13 points in the first
game; Boyle, a substitute forward
who bucketed 10 digits; and Allen,
a guard who intercepted so many
Papoose passes in the first game that
he looked like a Stanford player.
Coach Wytze Gorter avers that
his team's offense, leather than de
fense, beat Stanford in the previous
contest. Instead of relying on short,
sure passes, the Cardinals were con
tinually gambling on long tosses
which Allen constantly intercepted.
Marin had trouble penetrating the
Gortermen's set defense, however.
The past week's practice has ironed
out Stanford's offensive faults, and
night than it did before. #
Taylor To Start
Dick Taylor, acting captain, will
start at center for the frosh. With
his tremendous height he should be
able to control the tip-off as well as
get the ball off the backboard. Don
Williams and Bill Masters hold down
the forward berths. Both boys are
fast, alert and are good shots. The
guard spots will be filled by Eddie
DeMoss and Bob Stone, a couple of
defensive ballhawks and offensive
threats.
Ready to enter the game at any
time will be Bill Marshall, substi
tute forward, who tanked 20 points
in the first Marin game.
Nicoclls Out
The only casualty on the squad is
Bill Niccolls, peppy guard, who
turned his ankle in Wednesday's
hard scrimmage. Niccolls probably
won't be able to play tonight, but
he should be in shape for the game
with George Washington High
School tomorrow evennig. The
Washington game will take place at
the same hour and place as tonight's
game.
Coach Gorter has now cut the
squad down to the 16 players who
will make up this year's team. They
are: forwards — Don Williams, Bill
Masters, Bill Marshall, Bill Schroe
der, Ken Davidson, Stan Graff and
Bob Ditlevsen; centers—Dick Tay
lor and Bill Rumbley; guards —Ed
DeMoss, Bob Stone, Bill Niccolls,
Jack Alltucker, Chuck Boggs, Har
land Harbke and Don Burness.
Probable starting line-ups are:
Stanford Marin
20 Williams F Southuroyd 6
33 Masters F Morrison 8
3!) Taylor C Hoberg 15
28 Stone G Allen 14

turned his ankle in Wednesday's
hard scrimmage. Niccolls probably
won't be able to play tonight, but
he should be in shape for the game
with George Washington High
School tomorrow evennig. The
Washington game will take place at
the same hour and place as tonight's
game.
Coach Gorter has now cut the
squad down to the 16 players who
will make up this year's team. They
are: forwards — Don Williams, Bill
Masters, Bill Marshall, Bill Schroe
der, Ken Davidson, Stan Graff and
Bob Ditlevsen; centers—Dick Tay
lor and Bill Rumbley; guards —Ed
DeMoss, Bob Stone, Bill Niccolls,
Jack Alltucker, Chuck Boggs, Har
land Harbke and Don Burness.
Probable starting line-ups are:
Stanford Marin
20 Williams F Southuroyd 6
33 Masters F Morrison 8
3!) Taylor C Hoberg 15
28 Stone G Allen 14
29 DeMoss G Smith 12
Stanford's strong freshman bas- |
ketball team goes a-gunning for a
little bit of revenge tonight in En
oina Pavilion when the Papooses
take on Marin Junior College in a j
return game. Action starts at 7:30
o'clock.
Murin handed the yearlings a 47-
45 defeat on the latter's Christmas ;
vacation road trip, and the Indian i
babes have been eyeing the rematch
eagerly. Their mistakes of the pre
vious game, which was their first of
Ihe season, have been ironed out,
and if the frosh play the game of
which they are capable, they have a
better than even chance to reverse
the previous verdict.
Marin Stars
The stars of Coach Louis H.
"Scoop" Carlson<'s Marin outfit are
Morrison, a sharpshooting forward
who scored 13 points in the first
game; Boyle, a substitute forward
who bucketed 10 digits; and Allen,
a guard who intercepted so many
Papoose passes in the first game that
he looked like a Stanford player.
Coach Wytze Gorter avers that
his team's offense, leather than de
fense, beat Stanford in the previous
contest. Instead of relying on short,
sure passes, the Cardinals were con
tinually gambling on long tosses
which Allen constantly intercepted.
Marin had trouble penetrating the
Gortermen's set defense, however.
The past week's practice has ironed
out Stanford's offensive faults, and
night than it did before. #
Taylor To Start
Dick Taylor, acting captain, will
start at center for the frosh. With
his tremendous height he should be
able to control the tip-off as well as
get the ball off the backboard. Don
Williams and Bill Masters hold down
the forward berths. Both boys are
fast, alert and are good shots. The
guard spots will be filled by Eddie
DeMoss and Bob Stone, a couple of
defensive ballhawks and offensive
threats.
Ready to enter the game at any
time will be Bill Marshall, substi
tute forward, who tanked 20 points
in the first Marin game.
Nicoclls Out
The only casualty on the squad is
Bill Niccolls, peppy guard, who
turned his ankle in Wednesday's
hard scrimmage. Niccolls probably
won't be able to play tonight, but
he should be in shape for the game
with George Washington High
School tomorrow evennig. The
