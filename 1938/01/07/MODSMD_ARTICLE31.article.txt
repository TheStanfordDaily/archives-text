## SIDELINE SLANTS DINK LOOKS FOR GREAT PERFORMANCES 
### 
Dink Templeton has great ideas
for his varsity trackmen this sea
son.
Stanford's perpetual "Boy Coach'
may be putting his cindcr artists on
the spot, but he honestly believes
that some of them are going to es
tablish some records this year for
Pacific Coasters and the nation in
general to gasp at.
First of all. Dink prophesies that
Ray Malott, Stanford's contribu
tion to last summer's European
track tour, will break Blazin'
Ben Eastman's world record of
40.4 in the 440 the first good day
that Ray steps onto a track for
dual meet competition.
That's saying a lot. Such great
quarter-milers as Bill Carr and Ar
chie Williams have been unable to
touch Ben's record; I believe that
either Malott or Willaims will break
that 440 mark this coming season.
If neither runner accomplishes the
task before the dual meet with Cal,
it should happen then, allowing for
good weather.
