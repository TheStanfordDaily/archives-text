# RAY IS CAPABLE OF A WORLD RECORD
## 
### 
Dink claims that Ray is in better
shape right now than was Eastman
at this same time hi his career.
Malott's summer tour should set
him up for a great season. Who
knows? He may collect that rec
ord in the first n.eet. He's capable
of it.
Dink smiled a little as he thought
of his hurdling crew for the coming
season. The former Stanford star
athlete claims he has the best high
hurdling team it has ever been his |
pleasure to tutor. He has three aces
in his high timber deck, capable of
walking down the track, one, two,
three, in more than one meet.
The boys who compose a team
rated by Dink greater than the
famous Cardinal combinations of
past years, arc Bill Hawkins,
Johnny Hewitt, and Sophomore
Dick Simpson. Dink thinks Haw
kins should be down to 14.1 this
year, and young Simpson is fast
developing into a first class tim
ber topper.
