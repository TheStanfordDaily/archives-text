# ED BURROWS FIGURED ON FOR COMEBACK
## 
### 
Ed Burrows is figured on for a
sensational comeback this year. Dink
thinks he will get down to 4:12 in
the mile. Carl Mahurin is another
cinderman who should come
through with flying colors. Tem
pleton believes Carl capable of a 47-
second quarter mile and close to.
1:50 in the half mile.
In the field events Stanford will
be far from weak. The inimitable
track mentor figures that foot
balling Pete Zagar will go over
the 170-foot mark in the discus,
and that his tossing mate, Hugh
Gribben, will exceed 160.
In the high jump Dink has that
sophomore kangaroo, Russ Wulff,
who, Dink thinks, can go as high as
6 feet 8. Russ has already soared
6-3 in early practice and is in far
from top condition.
All in all, Stanford is going to
have some track team this year, and
the mighty Trojans of U.S.C. are in
for another tough tussle for the
conference championship they won
last year.
Win or lose, world records or not,
the Farm is going to be mighty
proud of its scantily clad cinder art
ists this season.
