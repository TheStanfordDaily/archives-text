# Southern Hoop League Opens In L.A. Tonight
## 
### 
The first whistle of the southern division basketball race blows tonight
in Los Angeles, while John Burtn's boys take it fairly easy, working out
in the Pavilion for their opener next week.
That whistle will set the hordes of Troy to stompin' around all over
the poor ol' Bruin from U.C.L.A., in a game that should end up in a

track meet with U.S.C. on top —by<
far.
Sam Barry's hoopsters feature a
not-too-fast attack which employs
a "bouncing' style of play. Viz: a
bouncer in a nightspot.
Troy's Stars
Star of Troy's game is a young
gentleman yclept Ralph Vaughn.
Good under the basket; fair ball
handler; mediocre long shot. Then
there is Fainting Clem Ruh, who has
the cute habit of falling down when
ever an opponent comes within a
yard of him, and then screaming
for a fpul. A right fine ball han
dler, he.
Center spot is held down by
Mons. Carl Anderson, who isn't any
slouch on any team, but Barry has
a sophomore who is much better.
Maybe someday he'll use him.
Guards are Hal Dornsife and Bill
Remsen. two big mooses who can
hit the bucket from a long way out
with consistency.
U.C.L.A.'s Team
As for U.C.L.A.—drag out the
lilies, Philbert. The only fair ball
player is Bob Calkins, at forward.
The other four are Crossan Hays,
Jack Montgomery, Paul Slaughter,
and Harley Humes.
The Bruins are a fine ball
handling quintet—in mid-court. But
that doesn't help very much in any
game. So —watch the Trojans roll.
Against U.C.L.A., that is.
