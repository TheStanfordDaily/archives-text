## Possible Tonic for an Anemic Purse 
### 
AT Bryn Mawr they have developed one pos
sible solution to what has become a coun
try-wide educational prpblem—how to corre
late the cost of four years at college and the
ability of U.S. students to pay for those four
years.
This question has both national and local
aspects. At Stanford it has proved a two-year
old worry to depression-born Stanford Asso
ciates, who are still seeking a way to remind
students that tuition covers less than 40 per
cent of what each student costs the University,
that most of the rest comes from interest on
endowments.
Fond hope of Stanford Associates is to be
able to instill a sense of gratitude in the bosoms
of graduating Stanfordites. That this gratitude
might soon pay returns in the form of monetary
gifts is the obvious desire and almost certain
conclusion.
At Bryn Mawr, however, they have devel
oped another method which has been working
efficiently for some time now. At the begin
ning of each school year form letters are sent
out to the parents of all students not holding
scholarships.
Couched in highly subtle phrases, these let
ters point out the low tuition charges as com

pared with the true costs of higher education.
Then, admitting that the parents are under nei
ther social nor moral obligation, the circulars
suggest that if the family is in a position to
afford it, the full cost be remitted. Further ex
planation shows that the system is co-operative
in that the money coming from the well-off
families is turned over to be used for scholar
ships.
Surprising to many is the fact that a large
percentage of those receiving these letters send
in their share. Some, unable to spare the full
amount, contribute what they can.
Successful as it is in the East, this system
would have some disadvantages along with
obvious advantages at Stanford. Probabilities
are that families of Farm students, in general,
are less wealthy than those whose daughters
attend Bryn Mawr. To many Stanford families,
$115 a quarter is already a strain. To these,
letters like those described would be little more
than a slap in the face.
However, with diplomatic handling and per
haps a little modification, the system could be
adapted to California sunshine. Grateful par
ents, though unable to afford $70,000 amphi
theaters, might not be displeased at a chance
to show their appreciation by contributing a few
hundred dollars a year.—J. R.
