WHEN Associate Justice Sutherland of the
Supreme Court resigned this week, it
brought him down to the stature of ordinary
mortals. Even a Supreme Court justice could
have the common fear of ending up on the
bread line.
Of course, Mr. Sutherland probably would
accept his bread only from private parties, and
not from Franklin Roosevelt's WPA. But the
fact that he is the second justice to retire within
a year after passage of the full-pay retirement
act gives plausibility to his supposed fear. The
conservative nature of the two ex-justices, as
evidenced by their court records, clinches the
argument.
Possibly there are other reasons for Mr. Suth
erland's action. If, as has been said, he would
go far out of his way to embarrass the presi
dent, he couldn't have chosen a better time to
retire. After the Black episode, any nominee to
the court will have to be perfect to satisfy the
Senate and the country generally. To make
selection more difficult, candidates must be lib-

eral, should be Democrats and from the West.
Then, too, Mr. Sutherland may feel that his
duty to save the constitution now is over. Con
gress is recovering from a four-year lethargy,
the Associate Justice may be willing to let it
take care of any radical proposal.
But these may be dismissed as superficial
guesses. The fear of unemployment is known
to be stronger among older persons. Alone, it
could have kept Mr. Sutherland punching the
time clock every day.—L. L.
