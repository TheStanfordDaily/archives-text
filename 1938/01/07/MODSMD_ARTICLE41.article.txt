# BULL SESSION
## PUBLIC FUTILITY 
### 
while the campus was placidly dream
ing of misses, mistletoe, .and mistakes, Our Edi
tor firmly put aside such childish things and started
playing handball with a bit of editorial dynamite. In a
front page layout as big as the relief rolls he commit
ted outright lese majesty on the person of King
Football.
On one side of the page Grant Stone defended his
master, pointing out that the revenue compensates for
the evils. On the other, a sports writer spoke like a
prophet of old, damning football as a false god, brand
ing its worship as idolatry. And in the middle Our
Editor put forth a plan for a constitutional monarchy,
with reduced prices that would remove the "big
money" evil.
* * * *
In these sad days when gloom flows in the gutter
and broken hearts lie about in corners, I hesitate to
add another pessimistic note to our over-supply of
sorrow. But two things seem obvious: that the foot
ball situation is very messy indeed; and that nothing
will be done about it.
The depressing aspect of the problem is that both
Stone and the sports writer are pretty close to being
right. The present football set-up is illogical, hypo
critical, and unfair. But the universities have built it
into their foundations, and they can't change it with
out starting an epidemic of apoplexy among trustees
and comptrollers.
Football has become one of those illogical-compro
mise institutions that make psychopathic cases out of
people who believe a budget can be balanced by apply
ing the ten commandments. The colleges depend on
it to fill up that nasty spot in the balance sheet that
the endowment fund leaves unmarked. They use it
to carry minor sports, to build dormitories and to ad
vertise. If they abandoned it they would run a deficit
approaching Rooseveltian dimensions.
* * * #
B UT our commercialized football carries with it
enough evils to make the devil shudder. It is
unfair to the legitimate students who find themselves
shouldering off the team by imported articles. It is a
bit trying for presidents with consciences that balk at
practices for which industrial magnates have been in
vestigated.
And so we arrive at that beautiful union of two
mutually exclusive principles. And we get an illogical
compromise which cynics say is typical of our civiliza
tion. The universities are in the position of a man who
spends the day prying orphans loose from their patri
mony, and then goes home staggering under a load of
lollypops for his own children.
* * * *
It is obvious that in a situation like this, the col
leges are going to do nothing. They may make a show
of charging the problem with great fanfare publicity
trumpets. But they will not try to alter the set-up.
They must have their revenue, and they must have
their advertising. They can't very well take a page in
Collier's and run some choice bit about "Flunkmore
College—gentlemen tailored to order." They have to
depend on football.
Cutting the price is no solution. That would take
the money out, which is the last thing the universities
want.
The prospect is not exactly a glowing one. But it
seems that King Football is going to continue his divine
ri' hl rule, No revolutionists nerd apply.

In these sad days when gloom flows in the gutter
and broken hearts lie about in corners, I hesitate to
add another pessimistic note to our over-supply of
sorrow. But two things seem obvious: that the foot
ball situation is very messy indeed; and that nothing
will be done about it.
The depressing aspect of the problem is that both
Stone and the sports writer are pretty close to being
right. The present football set-up is illogical, hypo
critical, and unfair. But the universities have built it
into their foundations, and they can't change it with
out starting an epidemic of apoplexy among trustees
and comptrollers.
Football has become one of those illogical-compro
mise institutions that make psychopathic cases out of
people who believe a budget can be balanced by apply
ing the ten commandments. The colleges depend on
it to fill up that nasty spot in the balance sheet that
the endowment fund leaves unmarked. They use it
to carry minor sports, to build dormitories and to ad
vertise. If they abandoned it they would run a deficit
approaching Rooseveltian dimensions.
* * * #
B UT our commercialized football carries with it
enough evils to make the devil shudder. It is
unfair to the legitimate students who find themselves
shouldering off the team by imported articles. It is a
bit trying for presidents with consciences that balk at
practices for which industrial magnates have been in
vestigated.
And so we arrive at that beautiful union of two
mutually exclusive principles. And we get an illogical
compromise which cynics say is typical of our civiliza
tion. The universities are in the position of a man who
spends the day prying orphans loose from their patri
mony, and then goes home staggering under a load of
lollypops for his own children.
* * * *
It is obvious that in a situation like this, the col
leges are going to do nothing. They may make a show
of charging the problem with great fanfare publicity
trumpets. But they will not try to alter the set-up.
They must have their revenue, and they must have
their advertising. They can't very well take a page in
Collier's and run some choice bit about "Flunkmore
College—gentlemen tailored to order." They have to
depend on football.
Cutting the price is no solution. That would take
the money out, which is the last thing the universities
want.
The prospect is not exactly a glowing one. But it
seems that King Football is going to continue his divine
ri' hl rule, No revolutionists nerd apply.

On one side of the page Grant Stone defended his

the evils. On the other, a sports writer spoke like a
prophet of old, damning football as a false god, brand

with reduced prices that would remove the "big
