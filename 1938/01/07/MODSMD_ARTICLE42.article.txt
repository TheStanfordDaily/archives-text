(This is the sccond of a series of excerpts from
letters by Dr. Phillips F. Greene, dean of the
Hunan-Yale Medical School at Changsha, China,
his wife, and their cousin and associate, Dr. Lois D.
Greene. —Ed.)

Dr. Lois Greene —November 11, 1937: ... I wish
you might see the hospital during an air raid warning.
Every student, nurse, doctor, and servant has his
task. Each bed is marked as to whether the patient
may walk, be carried, or not be moved, and in the
last raid, of the 180 patients who were in the hospital,
the 120 who could be moved were in the basement in
seven minutes. All this was without elevators for the
three floors. They have had to sit huddled on mats,
wrapped in blankets for as long as two hours. Even
the new-born babies are there in their blue and white
blankets.
. . . This is a dark time for China. With plans
carefully worked out and prepared years before,
Japan has been progressing toward her aim of becom
ing master of Asia. With mechanized units she has
been steadily pressing south from her holdings in the
north of China, and she has recently taken Taiyuanfu,
the capital of Shensi, which brings her closer ot the
Yellow River, her objective for the time being. With
terrific losses to herself and to China, and at the cost
of wide destruction, she is bent upon encircling Shang
hai and driving out the defenders.

Works of beauty, universities, hospitals, labora
tories and fruits of engineering skill have gone down
before her. Children and refugees have taken their
place in the tragedy, and have been lost by scores and
hundreds, often by direct attack. Canton and the
cities of the interior have been attacked, and the
ugly monster of hatred and fear stimulated to rise
and breed. Tiny children now know the language of
international hatred, deceit, and distrust.
. . . The loads that the responsible leaders are
carrying must be almost overwhelming, for in addi
tion to planning to the best of their ability, they are
continually having to deal with men who have not
kept pace with progress, and are consequently not to
be relied upon. There is still a lot of the old war lord,
jealousy, and the soldiers are very unevenly prepared
and equippd. The men from Kwangsi and Kwang
tung to the south are excellent, while those who have
been under the northern war lords are often pretty
poor stuff. Patriotism has always burned brighter in
the south.

. . . The most serious demand came this week
when the hospital was ordered to open and staff a
hospital for 500 wounded. They will be housed in old
drafty temples and warehouses in the little town across
the river from Siangtan . . . dirt floored temples
hardly make surgical wards.
Medical supplies are an ever pressing problem, and
we think twice about every bit of cotton, gauze, or
medicine that we use. In addition, the government
appropriations have been cut drastically, leaving a
deficit of $70,000.
