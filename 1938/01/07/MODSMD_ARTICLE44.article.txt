# Stars Depict Royal Exiles In 'Tovarich'
## 
### 
Romanoffs in exile, forty billion
francs, a Soviet commissar, and a
mildly dizzy family combine to
make "Tovarich," now playing at
the Stanford, one of the most charm
ing pictures in a long time.
Claudette Colbert, of course, plays
the Grand Duchess Tatiana, and
Charles Boyer, who might never

have heard of
Napoleon as far
as any similarity
of characterization
is concerned, en
acts her valiant
spouse, Prince
Mikail.
Guarding and
leav i ng strictly
alone foxly bil
lion francs en-

trusted to them by the Czar, these
two happily helpless people first
find themselves forced to accept po
sitions as butler and maid, and then
find themselves faced with a deci
sion which revives the days of ter
ror they went through during the
Revolution: whether or not to turn
over to their old enemy, Commissar
Gorochenko, the Czar's money, so
that he can save for Russia rich oil
lands necessary for the Soviet's
prosperity.
Miss Colbert is beautiful and very
likeable, Mr. Boyer handsome and
suavely humorous, Basil Rathbone
handsome and villainous, and the
supporting cast excellent. One says
these things, the customary things
to say in a review, and still one has
not explained what is the real rea
son for the picture's success — the
very intangible thing called charm.
In "Tovarich" will be found no
such hilarious dance as climaxed
"The Awful Truth," no such pas
sionate pursuit as made "It's Love
I'm After" so amusing; but there
will be found a very human quality
which is somehow lacking from al
most all current comedies.
Perhaps it is simply because these
people are real, where the others are
merely the creations of some facile
scenario-writer; perhaps because
they are just nice people struggling
to get along, keep their sense of
humor, maintain their dignity, and
not give in.
Whatever it may be, it is there;
and because of it, "Tovarich" is, to
repeat, one of the most charming
pictures to come this way in a long
time.

The largest exhibit at the New
York World's Fair will depict the
history of railroading in the United
States.

Romanoffs in exile, forty billion
francs, a Soviet commissar, and a
mildly dizzy family combine to
make "Tovarich," now playing at
the Stanford, one of the most charm
ing pictures in a long time.
Claudette Colbert, of course, plays
the Grand Duchess Tatiana, and
Charles Boyer, who might never

have heard of
Napoleon as far
as any similarity
of characterization
is concerned, en
acts her valiant
spouse, Prince
Mikail.

trusted to them by the Czar, these
two happily helpless people first
find themselves forced to accept po
sitions as butler and maid, and then
find themselves faced with a deci
sion which revives the days of ter
ror they went through during the
Revolution: whether or not to turn
over to their old enemy, Commissar
Gorochenko, the Czar's money, so
that he can save for Russia rich oil
lands necessary for the Soviet's
prosperity.
Miss Colbert is beautiful and very
likeable, Mr. Boyer handsome and
suavely humorous, Basil Rathbone
handsome and villainous, and the
supporting cast excellent. One says
these things, the customary things
to say in a review, and still one has
not explained what is the real rea
son for the picture's success — the
very intangible thing called charm.
In "Tovarich" will be found no
such hilarious dance as climaxed
"The Awful Truth," no such pas
sionate pursuit as made "It's Love
I'm After" so amusing; but there
will be found a very human quality
which is somehow lacking from al
most all current comedies.
Perhaps it is simply because these
people are real, where the others are
merely the creations of some facile
scenario-writer; perhaps because
they are just nice people struggling
to get along, keep their sense of
humor, maintain their dignity, and
not give in.
Whatever it may be, it is there;
and because of it, "Tovarich" is, to
repeat, one of the most charming
pictures to come this way in a long
time.
