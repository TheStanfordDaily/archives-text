# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Publication in today's Daily of
Dr. Phillips Greene's letter brings to
my mind an incident that well bears
out his suggested explanation of the
present and past Japanese territorial
advancesâ€”that the Nipponese con
sider it their destiny to conquer the
world, later lead it to what they
consider greater heights.
In May, 1936, there visited our
home a Professor Dmitri Sokolov, a
botanist connected with the Univer
sity of Mexico. He was affected with
myopia, and had been delayed on a
scientific trip through Baja Califor
nia by having his glasses broken; he
was waiting in San Diego for a
new pair.
Driven from Russia
Sokolov was a White Russian, hav
ing been driven from his native
country to Japan in 1917. Being a i
competent linguist, he soon found
employment at the Japanese equiva
lent of our Army War College, where ;
the military officers receive post- 1
graduate instruction. He was a !
teacher of Russian, a language
deemed wise to be known by Japa- |
ne.se military men.
Sokolov remained in Japan until |
1926, all the time picking up bits of
learning here and there; most Japa
nese assume that white people can
not understand their language, and
the discussions he overheard on
street corners, in trains, and even
at the War College were amazing.
Japanese Destiny
It seems that this destiny which
the Japanese revere as religion is ]
known and discussed by all classes,
that many of the people believe their I
principal purpose here on earth is
to bring it about. The plan, simply, !
is to conquer China, then the sur- 1
rounding minor Asiatic nations, after 1
which Russia and India can be over- |
powered. By that time the Japanese
empire should be large enough and
strong enough to subjugate Europe,
and finally the United States.
Sounds fantastic, like a Floyd
Gibbons story, doesn't it? Well, just ;
exactly how much pooh-poohing j
would you have done to anyone!
who had predicted to you ten years i
ago the invasions that Japan has |
already made in China? At that |
time they would have been unbe- I
lievable. And the amazing thing'
about the whole story to me is that j
Sokolov, in the spring of 1936, pre
dicted the invasion of central and,
south China as the next Japanese
advance, and set its date at between j
1938 and 1939.
Chinese Organization
You can see that in time only was i
he wrong, and many writers already |
have explained this in that Chiang's
organization of the Chinese people
threatened to seriously deter the
Japanese plan, and it was found
necessary to bring the matter to a !

head before he should become too
strong.
Dr. Greene's letter was the third
mention of this world-conquering
destiny that I have heard; it was
given in the radio program just a
week ago.
Don't you think it might prove
worth while if this angle on the Jap
anese purpose were given some
thought?
