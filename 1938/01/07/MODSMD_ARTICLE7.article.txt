# Lights Out, Farm in Dark For Dinner
## 
### BERT ALWARD 
Stanford was dark last night.
Students wandered hither and yon,
peering into darkened Post Office
! boxes and Lbrary shelves, ate dinner
and read by matchlight, all because
of a short circuit in the power line
between Encina and the Stadium.
Libc. Post Office, Theater, Encina,
the Gym, Toy on, Branner, and eat
ing clubs were in a state of com
plete darkness from 5:15 till 6:30.
Professor Flavin's playwriting
! class, at its first meeting, sat in the
, dark, because, as the professor says,
it is more inspirational. When some
! student tried to turn on the lights
toward the close of the hour, he
was disappointed to find no elec
; tricity.
"God's on our side," said an em
bryo playwright, munching an apple
1 at his desk.
One student, caught in the Libe
just as he was getting a book, lit a
match, signed his card, and dropped
j the match down the card slot.
Another, asking for Motteux's
translation of Rabelais, got Man
toux's "Industrial Revolution from
1789 to 1801." The librarian ex
plained that he couldn't do any bet
: tcr with his last three matches.
Encinamen, roused to anger by
the deficiency in their lighting sys
tem, built a fire in their lobby, and
! sat around doing a little reading.
Furniture, it is rumored, was the
I main material used for fuel.
Other freshmen, after questioning,
said that the lights went out and
then they went to dinner and ate by
| candle-light.
One Encina hasher set the kitchen
clock five minutes fast, and got all
his food on the table before the boys
came down to eat.
Scalping, in perhaps its most viru
lent form, was noticed on the west
end of Encina third floor when a
frosh with a box of wooden matches
sold them at a cent apiece to his
neighbors.
