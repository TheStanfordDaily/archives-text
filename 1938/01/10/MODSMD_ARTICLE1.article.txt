Hospital will receive the income J
from the $500,000 estate of Mrs. Jen- J
nie W. Cushing, widow of Dr. Clin

Mrs. Cushing died December 10,
1937, in New York, at the age of

the v/ill to be determined by the
Surrogate's Court of New York.
Two Wills
An earlier will was executed by
Mrs. Cushing in 1930, and the pres
ent will was executed in 1933. By
the 1933 will, Mrs. Cushing greatly
increased her bequest to the Uni
versity and the hospital, at the same
time decreasing other items listed in
the first will.
In both wills, John D. Parsons of
Newburyport, Mass., was named as
executor, and in the 1930 will Miss
Nancy Morrison of McClean, Va.,
was named executrix. Together
Parsons and Miss Morrison are pe
titioning for the admission of the
1930 will be probate. Advices stated
that the 1933 will has merely been
filed, without petition for px-obate.
