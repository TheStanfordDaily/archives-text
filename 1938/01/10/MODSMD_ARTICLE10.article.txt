"What's Â£he use of killing?"
This famous question, heard so
often that it has become a common
expression, was first asked at the
beginning of the Spanish-American
War by Brigadier General William
A. Shafter, subject of this week's
library exhibition.
General Shafter's participation in
a series of famous battles during
the conflict is portrayed at the li
brary through the exhibition of re
cently acquired papers, which in
clude messages and letters sent and
received by him during his military
command.
