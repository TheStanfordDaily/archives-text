# Change Suggested as Daily Looks at Cellar
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Celiar food is like the weather:
everyone talks about it but no one
does anything about it.
Though student talk has resulted
in the traditional semiannual Daily
editorial on food service and customs
in the Union, such fulminations have
usually concerned specific items,
such as five-cent coffee and five
dollar checks.
This year, to break with tradition
and in an effort to get at more basic
factors in the Union setup, The
Daily first is attempting to draw con
clusions from an analysis of the
finances and management of the or
ganization.
Interviews Held
With this purpose, the editor and
an associate editor last week talked
informally with Christine Ricker,
Union directress; Dean J. Hugh
Jackson, University comptroller;
Professor William B. Owens, chair
man of the Union Board of Gover
nors; and Charles Fontius, student
rrtanager of the Associated Students.
From these interviews they for-

mulated three possible plans by
which, they think, complaints could
be stopped. They are:
1. Institute a rebate system by
which students would be paid back a
share of Cellar profits, in ratio to
the money spent by each individual.
This would be similar to the Book
store rebate system in force a few
years ago.
2. Operate the Cellar at a loss,
by serving larger portions or reduc
ing prices. The loss would be borne
by profits made in other departments
of the Union, and by the 8000 "Union
dollars" collected each year.
3. Cut the "Union Dollar" from
the quarterly community fee.
No investigation was made of
opinions that eaters got less for
their money at the Cellar than at
comparable restaurants in Palo
Alto. Labor, overhead, and other
costs could hardly be compared,

size of portions oil specific orders
would be almost meaningless.
Monopoly, Issue
Rather the view was taken that
student unrest could be explained
and justified on the basis that the
Union holds a monopoly, that stu
dents believe that they are subsi
dizing it, and that they believe that
it is something of a co-operative run
for their benefit without hope for
profit.
The rebate system was thrown out j
rather early in the discussions. Ac
counting costs would eat away a
great part of the dividends; in any
case these would be too small to
make any impression on the students I
receiving them.
In order to do anything about the j
essential gripe, the editors felt, it
would be necessary to change quan
tity or price of food in the Cellar. |
So it was suggested that a loss be
sustained on the Cellar to satisfy
these complaints.
It could be considei'ed, the editors
argued, that the Union dollar would
subsidize food in the Cellar, although
that would be a matter of accounting.
Losses Shared
Actually, the Union dining room
and the Union residence dining hall,
which made the largest profit this
year, the cigar store, Encina store,
Cellai', ice-cream plant, and student
fees would share the loss, as at pres
ent they share the loss on the Old
Union dormitory.
However, amount of the loss
could be held to the number of
Union dollars collected.
In the same way a profit could be
computed only on the whole setup,
with each unit making as much
profit as the traffic would bear.
Anticipating an argument that
this would be the "Union dol
lar" to benefit the comparatively
few that eat at the Union, The Daily
believes that only a few would be
benefited under any distribution of
profits.
The money spent at the Union
and the profits made now go to
maintenance of the buildings and t
equipment, for the free tsudent
olTices that now cause a loss on the
Union dormitory, and for the the
ater, none of which directly bene
fit the whole student body.
When the Union paid off its debt
a few years ago, it was suggested that
I profits go into scholarships. That
j too would not be of general benefit.
Lengthy History
Reasons for advocating cutting the
Union dollar can be traced back
nearly to the building of the Union
buildings. From there the trail leads
through the financing of Memorial
Hall and up to the present.
When Herbert Hoover gave
| money for erecting Student Union
j buildings, there was no provision
in the gift for equipment. The
I Union incurred a debt of around
j 870,000 for the equipment which
! was to he amortized by a dollar
a quarter paid by the men stu
dents.
The comparable dollar paid by
women is split between the Women's
Clubhouse and the Women's Ath
letic Association.
That Union Dollar
About three years ago, that debt
was finally cleared up. At the same
time student agitation for a new
theater reached its height. Several
places for the Union dollar and prof
its were suggested, but it was finally
decided that 75 per cent should go
to the theater, 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund, until the reserve fund
should contain $30,000 when the ra
tio would be changed.
But the Union dollar is still paid
to the Union, made up part of its
$34,000 profit last year, although
75 per cent of it eventually goes
to the theater.
In addition, another dollar of the
$15 community fee goes directly to
the theater, making, with the $25,000
from the Union, around $36,000 to
be applied on the loan from the Uni
versity. The Union dollar could be
cut and, on the basis of this year,
interest and about $10,000 on princi
pal still would be paid on approxi
mately $360,000 owed. The debt may
be slightly smaller and the payment
larger.
This would put the Union on its
own, apparently and actually. With
the Cellar run at near cost (its net
profit has varied from 2.3 per cent of
gross to 2.5 per cent in the last three
years), there would be left no basis
for student belief that the Union was
subsidized, it was concluded.
The Daily rests its case there; to
morrow will be given the opposition
to these proposals.

nors; and Charles Fontius, student
rrtanager of the Associated Students.
From these interviews they for-

mulated three possible plans by
which, they think, complaints could
be stopped. They are:
1. Institute a rebate system by
which students would be paid back a
share of Cellar profits, in ratio to
the money spent by each individual.
This would be similar to the Book
store rebate system in force a few
years ago.
2. Operate the Cellar at a loss,
by serving larger portions or reduc
ing prices. The loss would be borne
by profits made in other departments
of the Union, and by the 8000 "Union
dollars" collected each year.
3. Cut the "Union Dollar" from
the quarterly community fee.
No investigation was made of
opinions that eaters got less for
their money at the Cellar than at
comparable restaurants in Palo
Alto. Labor, overhead, and other
costs could hardly be compared,

size of portions oil specific orders
would be almost meaningless.
Monopoly, Issue
Rather the view was taken that
student unrest could be explained
and justified on the basis that the
Union holds a monopoly, that stu
dents believe that they are subsi
dizing it, and that they believe that
it is something of a co-operative run
for their benefit without hope for
profit.
The rebate system was thrown out j
rather early in the discussions. Ac
counting costs would eat away a
great part of the dividends; in any
case these would be too small to
make any impression on the students I
receiving them.
In order to do anything about the j
essential gripe, the editors felt, it
would be necessary to change quan
tity or price of food in the Cellar. |
So it was suggested that a loss be
sustained on the Cellar to satisfy
these complaints.
It could be considei'ed, the editors
argued, that the Union dollar would
subsidize food in the Cellar, although
that would be a matter of accounting.
Losses Shared
Actually, the Union dining room
and the Union residence dining hall,
which made the largest profit this
year, the cigar store, Encina store,
Cellai', ice-cream plant, and student
fees would share the loss, as at pres
ent they share the loss on the Old
Union dormitory.
However, amount of the loss
could be held to the number of
Union dollars collected.
In the same way a profit could be
computed only on the whole setup,
with each unit making as much
profit as the traffic would bear.
Anticipating an argument that
this would be the "Union dol
lar" to benefit the comparatively
few that eat at the Union, The Daily
believes that only a few would be
benefited under any distribution of
profits.
The money spent at the Union
and the profits made now go to
maintenance of the buildings and t
equipment, for the free tsudent
olTices that now cause a loss on the
Union dormitory, and for the the
ater, none of which directly bene
fit the whole student body.
When the Union paid off its debt
a few years ago, it was suggested that
I profits go into scholarships. That
j too would not be of general benefit.
Lengthy History
Reasons for advocating cutting the
Union dollar can be traced back
nearly to the building of the Union
buildings. From there the trail leads
through the financing of Memorial
Hall and up to the present.
When Herbert Hoover gave
| money for erecting Student Union
j buildings, there was no provision
in the gift for equipment. The
I Union incurred a debt of around
j 870,000 for the equipment which
! was to he amortized by a dollar
a quarter paid by the men stu
dents.
The comparable dollar paid by
women is split between the Women's
Clubhouse and the Women's Ath
letic Association.
That Union Dollar
About three years ago, that debt
was finally cleared up. At the same
time student agitation for a new
theater reached its height. Several
places for the Union dollar and prof
its were suggested, but it was finally
decided that 75 per cent should go
to the theater, 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund, until the reserve fund
should contain $30,000 when the ra
tio would be changed.
But the Union dollar is still paid
to the Union, made up part of its
$34,000 profit last year, although
75 per cent of it eventually goes
to the theater.
In addition, another dollar of the
$15 community fee goes directly to
the theater, making, with the $25,000
from the Union, around $36,000 to
be applied on the loan from the Uni
versity. The Union dollar could be
cut and, on the basis of this year,
interest and about $10,000 on princi
pal still would be paid on approxi
mately $360,000 owed. The debt may
be slightly smaller and the payment
larger.
This would put the Union on its
own, apparently and actually. With
the Cellar run at near cost (its net
profit has varied from 2.3 per cent of
gross to 2.5 per cent in the last three
years), there would be left no basis
for student belief that the Union was
subsidized, it was concluded.
The Daily rests its case there; to
morrow will be given the opposition
to these proposals.
Celiar food is like the weather:
everyone talks about it but no one
does anything about it.
Though student talk has resulted
in the traditional semiannual Daily
editorial on food service and customs
in the Union, such fulminations have
usually concerned specific items,
such as five-cent coffee and five
dollar checks.
This year, to break with tradition
and in an effort to get at more basic
factors in the Union setup, The
Daily first is attempting to draw con
clusions from an analysis of the
finances and management of the or
ganization.

their money at the Cellar than at

costs could hardly be compared,

size of portions oil specific orders
would be almost meaningless.
Monopoly, Issue
Rather the view was taken that
student unrest could be explained
and justified on the basis that the
Union holds a monopoly, that stu
dents believe that they are subsi
dizing it, and that they believe that
it is something of a co-operative run
for their benefit without hope for
profit.
The rebate system was thrown out j
rather early in the discussions. Ac
counting costs would eat away a
great part of the dividends; in any
case these would be too small to
make any impression on the students I
receiving them.
In order to do anything about the j
essential gripe, the editors felt, it
would be necessary to change quan
tity or price of food in the Cellar. |
So it was suggested that a loss be
sustained on the Cellar to satisfy
these complaints.
It could be considei'ed, the editors
argued, that the Union dollar would
subsidize food in the Cellar, although
that would be a matter of accounting.
Losses Shared
Actually, the Union dining room
and the Union residence dining hall,
which made the largest profit this
year, the cigar store, Encina store,
Cellai', ice-cream plant, and student
fees would share the loss, as at pres
ent they share the loss on the Old
Union dormitory.
However, amount of the loss
could be held to the number of
Union dollars collected.
In the same way a profit could be
computed only on the whole setup,
with each unit making as much
profit as the traffic would bear.
Anticipating an argument that
this would be the "Union dol
lar" to benefit the comparatively
few that eat at the Union, The Daily
believes that only a few would be
benefited under any distribution of
profits.
The money spent at the Union
and the profits made now go to
maintenance of the buildings and t
equipment, for the free tsudent
olTices that now cause a loss on the
Union dormitory, and for the the
ater, none of which directly bene
fit the whole student body.
When the Union paid off its debt
a few years ago, it was suggested that
I profits go into scholarships. That
j too would not be of general benefit.
Lengthy History
Reasons for advocating cutting the
Union dollar can be traced back
nearly to the building of the Union
buildings. From there the trail leads
through the financing of Memorial
Hall and up to the present.
When Herbert Hoover gave
| money for erecting Student Union
j buildings, there was no provision
in the gift for equipment. The
I Union incurred a debt of around
j 870,000 for the equipment which
! was to he amortized by a dollar
a quarter paid by the men stu
dents.
The comparable dollar paid by
women is split between the Women's
Clubhouse and the Women's Ath
letic Association.
That Union Dollar
About three years ago, that debt
was finally cleared up. At the same
time student agitation for a new
theater reached its height. Several
places for the Union dollar and prof
its were suggested, but it was finally
decided that 75 per cent should go
to the theater, 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund, until the reserve fund
should contain $30,000 when the ra
tio would be changed.
But the Union dollar is still paid
to the Union, made up part of its
$34,000 profit last year, although
75 per cent of it eventually goes
to the theater.
In addition, another dollar of the
$15 community fee goes directly to
the theater, making, with the $25,000
from the Union, around $36,000 to
be applied on the loan from the Uni
versity. The Union dollar could be
cut and, on the basis of this year,
interest and about $10,000 on princi
pal still would be paid on approxi
mately $360,000 owed. The debt may
be slightly smaller and the payment
larger.
This would put the Union on its
own, apparently and actually. With
the Cellar run at near cost (its net
profit has varied from 2.3 per cent of
gross to 2.5 per cent in the last three
years), there would be left no basis
for student belief that the Union was
subsidized, it was concluded.
The Daily rests its case there; to
morrow will be given the opposition
to these proposals.
Celiar food is like the weather:
everyone talks about it but no one
does anything about it.
Though student talk has resulted
in the traditional semiannual Daily
editorial on food service and customs
in the Union, such fulminations have
usually concerned specific items,
such as five-cent coffee and five
dollar checks.
This year, to break with tradition
and in an effort to get at more basic
factors in the Union setup, The
Daily first is attempting to draw con
clusions from an analysis of the
finances and management of the or
ganization.
Interviews Held
With this purpose, the editor and
an associate editor last week talked
informally with Christine Ricker,
Union directress; Dean J. Hugh
Jackson, University comptroller;
Professor William B. Owens, chair
man of the Union Board of Gover
nors; and Charles Fontius, student
rrtanager of the Associated Students.
From these interviews they for-

mulated three possible plans by
which, they think, complaints could
be stopped. They are:
1. Institute a rebate system by
which students would be paid back a
share of Cellar profits, in ratio to
the money spent by each individual.
This would be similar to the Book
store rebate system in force a few
years ago.
2. Operate the Cellar at a loss,
by serving larger portions or reduc
ing prices. The loss would be borne
by profits made in other departments
of the Union, and by the 8000 "Union
dollars" collected each year.
3. Cut the "Union Dollar" from
the quarterly community fee.
No investigation was made of
opinions that eaters got less for
their money at the Cellar than at
comparable restaurants in Palo
Alto. Labor, overhead, and other
