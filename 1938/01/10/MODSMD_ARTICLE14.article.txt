# Salzburg Opera Guild To Present Mozart's 'Cosi Fan Tutte' Tomorrow
## 
### 
The way of women will be op
eratically depicted tomorrow night
in the Memorial Hall, when the
Salzburg Opera Guild presents Mo
zart's "Cosi Fan Tutte."
Liberally translated the title of
the opera means "Isn't that Just
What You'd Expect from a Woman?"
and was written in 1789 when Mo
zart. was 33 at the royal request of
the Emperor Joseph of Austria, by
whom the plot is said to have been
suggested.
The scene is laid in Naples. A
cynical old bachelor, Don Alphon
so, has made a wager with two
young Neopolitan officers, Ferrando
and Guglielmo. that the fidelity of

their respective fiancees, Fiordiligi
and Dorabella, is of uncertain
quality.
To provide the necessary test the
two officers declare that they have
been called away from Naples on
duty, but they return the same
afternoon disguised as Oriental
noblemen.
The would-be strangers lay
siege to the girls and repeatedly
make violent love to them. After a
series of especially ardent advances,
the girls finally succumb and agree
to marry their new wooers.
The wedding contracts are
signed and sealed, when suddenly
I drums are heard and Don Alfonso

annonuces the return of the sol
diers. The Orientals vanish and
reappear as their own selves, and
l'eproach their sweethearts' fickle
ness.
The mystery is made clear to the
1 two girls, and Don Alfonso, pock
[ eting the wager he has won, rec
onciles them with their lovers, who
respond with the phrases "Cosi Fan
Tutte" or ''Thus do all women."
The opera will begin at 8:15
o'clock promptly and late comers
will not be seated until after the
first act. Tickets are on sale in the
Concert Series Office and at Kee
ble's in Palo Alto for $2.50, $2, and
I $1.50.
