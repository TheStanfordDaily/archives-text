the second sorority rushing period. Men's preference week gets under
way tomorrow noon.
Women will also accept dates for lunch and dinner tomorrow. Wed

Pledging will take place in En
cina Friday afternoon from 1 to 4
o'clock, according to Don Moulton,
chairman of Interfraternity Coun
cil. Fireworks at the houses and
the annual Pledge Prom Friday
evening will conclude the day.
Change Defeated
Sorority bids will be distributed
in Roble immediately after dinner
Saturday, followed immediately by
pledging at the houses. Each soror
ity will hold an open-house from
7:30 to 10:30 o'clock.
A move to hold pledging Satur
day afternoon instead of Saturday
evening was voted down last night
by Pan-Hellenic Council, whose
members reported they saw no ad
vantage in this plan, whfch they de
cided would cause additional strain
on Row women.
Approximately 150 rushees, from a
class of 260 freshman women and
several transfers, were entertained
at luncheons and dinners Friday,
Saturday, and yesterday at the nine
houses. The four dates constituted
[ the first period of rushing.
Bid 117 Women
Of those rushed, 117 will be
pledged if all the houses take their
full quota, according to Pan-
Hellenic.
Women's luncheon dates will be
from 12 to 1:30 o'clock and dinner
dates from 6 to 8 o'clock. Row wom
; en and rushees are reminded that
| (lie dinner date tomorrow night will
| not conflict with the A.S.S.U. con
i cert, which does not begin until
8:15 o'clock.
Quad clothes will be worn at to
morrow's lunch and dressy street
clothes for dinner tonight and to
morrow. Preference banquets will
be formal.
