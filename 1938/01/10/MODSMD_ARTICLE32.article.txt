# Frosh Cagemen Win Two Game
## Marin Javsee, Washington High Men Cause Coach Gorter Worry 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's freshman basketball team is two victories richer today fol
lowing its activities «.f the past week-end. but only at the expense of a
case of nervous prostration by Coach Wytze Gorter.
Gorter had most of his trouble Friday night during the Frosh's thrill
ing overtmei win over Marin Junior College, 28-27. although he had some

of anxiety Saturday eve
ning when the yearlings swamped
George Washington High School,
| 37-23. Both games were held in
the local pavilion.
The Marin affair was so exciting
that it made most other basketball
games look like sewing bees. Marin
got off to an early 5-0 lead, and
soon after were ahead, 9-4. How
] ever, from then on the two teams
j traded the lead like a hot potato.
No team was ever ahead by more
than three points. At the half they
were tied, 12-12.
Basket for Basket
In the second period the thrills
x*eally commenced with Marin and
the Papooses coming down the
stretch trading basket for basket.
When the gun ended the regular
j playing period, the score stood 25-
25."
The overtime period had hardly
| started when Hoberg, jaysee center,
sank a bucket. Then, with the chips
down and every move a crucial
one, Eddie DeMoss, yearling guard,
dropped in the tieing basket and a
I few seconds later added the game
winning foul shot.
DeMoss Scores Nine
DeMoss tied with Smith and Ho
' berg of Marin for high point honors
' with nine, but the sparkplug of the
frosh was little Bill "Mike" Mar
shall, spunky forward, who kept the
team going when several times it
appeared on the brink of faltering.
The win was doubly sweet for the
1 frosh because not only did it cross
j off the previous verdict Marin had
j scored over them, but it also gave
i Gorter a victory over his old junior
j college coach, Louis H. "Scoop"
Carlson.
Close Game Saturday
Saturday night's game with Wash
-1 ington started out close but once the
; Frosh warmed up to their task it
| was no contest.
The Papooses held a bare 17-16
i lead at the half against the inspired
j play of Coach Lloyd Leith's Eagles,
| but Stanford, led by Don Williams,
I sharp-shooting forward, and Bill
i Rumbley, tall substitute center,
started scoring fast and often in the
second half.
Wil iams High Scorer
Williams, who scored the first
eight frosh points, pilfered high
scoring honors with 15 digits. Phil

Stanford's freshman basketball team is two victories richer today fol
lowing its activities «.f the past week-end. but only at the expense of a
case of nervous prostration by Coach Wytze Gorter.
Gorter had most of his trouble Friday night during the Frosh's thrill
ing overtmei win over Marin Junior College, 28-27. although he had some

of anxiety Saturday eve
ning when the yearlings swamped
George Washington High School,
| 37-23. Both games were held in
the local pavilion.
The Marin affair was so exciting
that it made most other basketball
games look like sewing bees. Marin
got off to an early 5-0 lead, and
soon after were ahead, 9-4. How
] ever, from then on the two teams
j traded the lead like a hot potato.
No team was ever ahead by more
than three points. At the half they
were tied, 12-12.
Basket for Basket
In the second period the thrills
x*eally commenced with Marin and
the Papooses coming down the
stretch trading basket for basket.
When the gun ended the regular
j playing period, the score stood 25-
25."
The overtime period had hardly
| started when Hoberg, jaysee center,
sank a bucket. Then, with the chips
down and every move a crucial
one, Eddie DeMoss, yearling guard,
dropped in the tieing basket and a
I few seconds later added the game
winning foul shot.
DeMoss Scores Nine
DeMoss tied with Smith and Ho
' berg of Marin for high point honors
' with nine, but the sparkplug of the
frosh was little Bill "Mike" Mar
shall, spunky forward, who kept the
team going when several times it
appeared on the brink of faltering.
The win was doubly sweet for the
1 frosh because not only did it cross
j off the previous verdict Marin had
j scored over them, but it also gave
i Gorter a victory over his old junior
j college coach, Louis H. "Scoop"
Carlson.
Close Game Saturday
Saturday night's game with Wash
-1 ington started out close but once the
; Frosh warmed up to their task it
| was no contest.
The Papooses held a bare 17-16
i lead at the half against the inspired
j play of Coach Lloyd Leith's Eagles,
| but Stanford, led by Don Williams,
I sharp-shooting forward, and Bill
i Rumbley, tall substitute center,
started scoring fast and often in the
