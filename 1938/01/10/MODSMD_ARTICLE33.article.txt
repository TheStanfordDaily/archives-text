BOUNDING BASKETEERS
FACE TOUGH ONE
Genial John Bunn's bounding
basketeers will probably run into
their toughest competition of the en
tire season here on the Farm this
week-end when "Elevator" Sam
Barry's Trojans invade the Indian
sanctuary.
The rough and tumble artists
from Troy are especially tough
this year despite the loss of Eddie
Oram and Jerry Gracin, all-
Coasters from last year.
The Trojans have played eleven
games, winning nine and losing two
to top-notch squads. The southern
ers lost to Purdue and Indiana.
Friday night they whipped the weak
U.C.L.A. Bruins into submission by
the comparatively moderate score of
48-31.
BARRY'S LADS HAVE
SCORING POWER
Barry's iads have amassed a total
of 512 points to a mere 352 for the
opposition. Ralph Vaughn, soph
forward, has averaged something
like 15 points per game which is
tops in any league.
The easiest bet of the current
season is one that says this Tro
jan-Indian series is going to be
the best bit of basketball on the
coast this year. I look for Bunn's
charges to win both games, and
win one of the Trojan games in
LA.
Sports authorities up and down
the Coast are predicting what Stan
find will do this year. Some say
the Indians will only take two games
from Troy; others say three; and
still others are positive that the
F;irm casaba tossers will come
through the conference play with a
clean siate.
COIIN TURNS BENEVOLENT;
PRAISES LUISETTI AND CO.
Believe it. or not, ladies and gen
tlemen, the one and only Art Cohn,
Stanford's public enemy number
one, actually comes out in print
with a few kind words for Stan
ford. ♦
Says the venerable sage of the
Oakland Tribune, "Greatest cinch is
that Stanford will win the Coast title
again. It will be a breeze. With
Luisetti, the club outclasses the
league as the New York Yanks and
the Golden Bears did theirs."
"I have seen the best basketball
players in the country for the last
17 years, but never have I seen a
greater one than Hank Luisetti."
That almost takes our breath away
after Cohn's vicious attacks during
the football season.
Maybe the conductor of Cohning
Tower let everything go during the
Bears' hilarious grid season. Having
no energy left, he's probably turned
into a kind and benevolent little
chap for the present at, least.
BUCK'S BRONCOS ARE
GOING HIGH HAT
Just one more look into football
. . . I see where the Santa Clara
Broncos under the Buck Shaw re
gime are starting a little "Freeze
out within a freezeout." The mis
sion city gridders, inflated with the
fortunes of the last two football
seasons and the sweetness of two
dips into the sugar bowl, are be
ginning to get a little t°° big for
their helmets.
I see where they arc drop
ping San Jose State, Loyola, and
Portland University from their
1938 schedule. Wasn't it Santa
Clara that hollered the loudest
when the Pacific Coast Confer
ence instigated that purported
"freezeout" several years ago?
The Santa Clarans are taking the
Sugar Bowl as a yearly matter-of
course, and are thinking of football
in terms of Fordham, L.S.U., Pur
due, Marquette, and Texas A. & M.

BOUNDING BASKETEERS
FACE TOUGH ONE
Genial John Bunn's bounding
basketeers will probably run into
their toughest competition of the en
tire season here on the Farm this
week-end when "Elevator" Sam
Barry's Trojans invade the Indian
sanctuary.
The rough and tumble artists
from Troy are especially tough
this year despite the loss of Eddie
Oram and Jerry Gracin, all-
Coasters from last year.
The Trojans have played eleven
games, winning nine and losing two
to top-notch squads. The southern
ers lost to Purdue and Indiana.
Friday night they whipped the weak
U.C.L.A. Bruins into submission by
the comparatively moderate score of
48-31.
BARRY'S LADS HAVE
SCORING POWER
Barry's iads have amassed a total
of 512 points to a mere 352 for the
opposition. Ralph Vaughn, soph
forward, has averaged something
like 15 points per game which is
tops in any league.
The easiest bet of the current
season is one that says this Tro
jan-Indian series is going to be
the best bit of basketball on the
coast this year. I look for Bunn's
charges to win both games, and
win one of the Trojan games in
LA.
Sports authorities up and down
the Coast are predicting what Stan
find will do this year. Some say
the Indians will only take two games
from Troy; others say three; and
still others are positive that the
F;irm casaba tossers will come
through the conference play with a
clean siate.
COIIN TURNS BENEVOLENT;
PRAISES LUISETTI AND CO.
Believe it. or not, ladies and gen
tlemen, the one and only Art Cohn,
Stanford's public enemy number
one, actually comes out in print
with a few kind words for Stan
ford. ♦
Says the venerable sage of the
Oakland Tribune, "Greatest cinch is
that Stanford will win the Coast title
again. It will be a breeze. With
Luisetti, the club outclasses the
league as the New York Yanks and
the Golden Bears did theirs."
"I have seen the best basketball
players in the country for the last
17 years, but never have I seen a
greater one than Hank Luisetti."
That almost takes our breath away
after Cohn's vicious attacks during
the football season.
Maybe the conductor of Cohning
Tower let everything go during the
Bears' hilarious grid season. Having
no energy left, he's probably turned
into a kind and benevolent little
chap for the present at, least.
BUCK'S BRONCOS ARE
GOING HIGH HAT
Just one more look into football
. . . I see where the Santa Clara
Broncos under the Buck Shaw re
gime are starting a little "Freeze
out within a freezeout." The mis
sion city gridders, inflated with the
fortunes of the last two football
seasons and the sweetness of two
dips into the sugar bowl, are be
ginning to get a little t°° big for
their helmets.
I see where they arc drop
ping San Jose State, Loyola, and
Portland University from their
1938 schedule. Wasn't it Santa
Clara that hollered the loudest
when the Pacific Coast Confer
ence instigated that purported
"freezeout" several years ago?
