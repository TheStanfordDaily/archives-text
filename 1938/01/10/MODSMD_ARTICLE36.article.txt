Coach John Bunn and Captain

hurry-up jaunt to Los Angeles Fri
day night to scout the U.S.C.-
U.C.L.A. basketball game filled
with respect for this year's Tro

Sam Barry's Wooden Horsemen
waded mercilessly through the
Bruin quintet, which is consider
ably weakened this year by the loss
of Long John Ball.
Led by a confident sophomore
who scored 19 points, Ralph Vaughn,
the Southern California varsity
seems only slightly touched by the

graduation of Eddie Oram, all-coast
guard, and Jerry Gracin, second
highest scorer in the southern loop
last season.
Not very tall as basketball play
ers go, Vaughn is stockily built and
not afraid to use his weight, ac
cording to various observers. He
cavorts at one forward, with Clem
Ruh, regular forward last year, at
the other side.
Hal Dornsife, substitute guard
last season, and Captain Bill Rem
sen hold out at guards, and Carl
Anderson, last year's regular cen
ter, has returned for another year.
"They're a good team," remarked
Luisetti Saturday afternoon at
practice, "we have a real pair of ball
games on our hands this Friday and
Saturday."
Coach Bunn backed up the cap
tain's statement by drilling his
squad thoroughly on a set of plays
especially designed to stop the
Barrymen, and then topped the
Saturday session off with a lively
scrimmage.
