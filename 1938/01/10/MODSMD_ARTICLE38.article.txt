lake an early lead over the rest of
the field, as 30 golfers opened com
petition last week for places on
Stanford's 1938 golf squad.
Two more rounds remain to be
played by the end of the week and
the 20 lowest scorers for three
rounds will be given berths on the
squad with which Coach Eddie
Twiggs expects to continue Stan
ford's supremacy on the links when
intercollegiate competition gets un
der way in the spring.

pions for 1937, the Indians are ex
pected to win the title again this
year and are considered one of the
strongest college teams in the
country.

the opening round. Art Doering,
heavily favored to capture the
number one spot, was suffering
from a had knee injury sustained
while skiing during vacation, and
hobbled around in a 79.
Paced by Don Haslett, former

this year will be well balanced,
though not as strong as last year's
outfit.
