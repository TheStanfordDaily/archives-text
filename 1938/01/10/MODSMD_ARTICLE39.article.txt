# Rugby Squads Cheer Coaches
## 
### 
Willi only three days of practice
behind them, Stanford's varsity and
freshman rugby squads went
through a two-l.„ur •"•rh.nwage Sat
urday afternoon and showed such
remarkable progress that Coach Jim
Wylie of the varsity and Kenny
Peters of the Frosh now bear grins
from ear to ear on their faces.
A Red team, composed of first
and second-stringers, ran circles
around the Grays at midfield, but
fumbles near pay dirt nullified nu
merous scoring opportunities. The
Grays had fewer chances, but they
took advantage of them and came
out ahead.
After a scoreless first half, they
broke into the scoring when Bob
Sengstack crossed the goal for a
try. A few minutes later John
Raymond scored again for the Grays.
At this point Coach Kenny Pet
ers inserted some of his frosh can
didates on each team, and they took
up the scoring where the varsity
left off. Bob Lewis added a try for
the Grays and Norm Standlee con
tributed one as the game ended.

The United States is the leading
cotton producing country of the
world.
