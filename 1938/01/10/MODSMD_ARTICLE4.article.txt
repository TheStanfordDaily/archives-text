# 'Blue Jeans' Selected For Stagers Show
## Tryouts on Deck Today For World Premiere 
### 
World premiere of Martin Fla
vin's "Blue Jeans" will be present
ed by Stanford Stagers in Memo
rial Hall February 19.
The modern American comedy
was chosen by Dramatic Council at
its meeting last Friday because it
is especially adapted to campus au
diences. However, it was wx'itten
with the hope that it would ulti
mately play on Broadway.
Tryouts for the 18 parts in the
play will be held today and tomor
row in the Little Theater from 4 to
6 o'clock. New talent is particularly
needed for this production because
many of the regular members of
Stagers are busy with presentations
of the Department of Speech and
Drama.
Freshmen and anyone who has
had dramatic experience in high
school or junior college are espe
cially encouraged to try out for
"Blue Jeans." Hal Kahn was se
lected to direct the first winter
quarter student show at Stanford at
a meeting of Stagers last week.
Members of the cast will be able
to receive the expert advice of the
author on details of the production
because Mr. Flavin is teaching a
course in the writing of plays at
Stanford this quarter. Dramatic
Council took the value of this ex
pert supervision into consideration
when they select the vehicle.
"Blue Jeans" will be the only play
presented in the main auditorium of
Memorial Hall this quarter. The
technical facilities of Stanford's new
theater will only be used for this
production.
