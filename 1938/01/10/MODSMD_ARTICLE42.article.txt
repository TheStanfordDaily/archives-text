## International Housing on the Farm 
### 
WHILE Japanese bombs explode in China,
and Spain lies devastated by civil war,
Stanford's International Committee is laying
plans for a place of international amity on the
Farm—a revolutionized type of international
house.
Unlike California's, which is said to be more
like "Grand Hotel" than any other American
institution, Stanford's International House
would be organized on a modest, co-operative
basis. Instead of starting with an enormous
grant from the Rockefeller Institute, it will, if
approved, open without ceremony in one of
the larger campus homes.
Preliminary plans, though enthusiastically
endorsed by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, have not
yet been presented before the A.S.S.U., and are
not, therefore, too well defined.
Object of the organization will be to house
and orient some of the 50 odd foreign students
attending Stanford. By far the greatest per
centage of these are graduate men, for whom
no accommodations of any sort are available,
outside of private homes and downtown apart
ments.
Many of these men came to the United States
for the express purpose of meeting American
students and absorbing or at least studying
their culture. That this goal is hard to achieve
is evidenced by a young English - speaking
Turk, who, after three guarters at Stanford, had
found only five students hospitable enough to

engage in conversation.
Thus while Farm men and women are en
thusiastically received by most foreign uni
versities, students from these same institutions,
who come to Stanford for graduate work, find
few friends, almost no social life.
It is to put an immediate end to such condi
tions that Mel Jacoby, chairman of the Inter
national Committee, is seeking to gain approval
of his project that it may be inaugurated Spring
Quarter.
Present plans call for a group of 25 or 30, of
whom it is expected that about five or ten
would be Americans from the various living
groups. These latter would under no condi
tion be considered as sponsors, but would sim
ply be members of a co-operative community.
This co-operative element in the venture is
largely one of degree. At some universities sys
tems have been developed under which stu
dents paid a lump sum for their rooms and then
received refunds according to the amount of
community work to their credit. This system
may be adopted for the International House, if
it becomes a reality.
Vague as all of the plans are, arrangements
are being carried on which, in the near future,
will allow presentation before Ex Committee.
Because of the obvious benefits to a hitherto
neglected group, and because of the apparent
social justification of the scheme, the Commit
tee should find no reason to reject it. —J. R.
