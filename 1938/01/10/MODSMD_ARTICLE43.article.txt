# Smoke Gets in Tradition's Eye
## 
### 
"No Smoking on the Quad —a few days
after the University opened 46 years ago Mrs.
Stanford asked the students not to smoke in
side the Quadrangles or on the arched walks
surrounding them. For 46 years Stanford men
and women have respected her wish."
Between the rosy covers of Stanford's little
freshman bible this optimistic bit is tucked
under the confusing subtitle "Traditions," to be
read and revered as such by unsuspecting frosh
and disregarded by others.
But the rosy little freshman bible is twice
wrong. The "no smoking on the Quad" prac
tice is not a tradition and unfortunately has not
been respected for 46 years by Stanford men
and women.
Traditions are contemporary things; they
spring from within, and either live or die by
their own merits. Traditions need not neces
sarily be fostered. They take seed and grow
by impetus inherent in their nature.
"No smoking on the Quad" is a Founder's
plea to students of the University—a simple
request. It came from a generous woman's
heart as one of the things she would appreciate
from the students who attend the University she

founded and loved.
Traditions can be tossed aside as not worth
the while, but Mrs. Stanford's request is not a
tradition.
