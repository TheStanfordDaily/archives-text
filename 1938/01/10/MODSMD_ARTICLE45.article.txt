HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO WHITE
I NEAREST MARJIE:
Time has continued to unfold its wondrous pat
tern, and here I am again sheltered behind the skirts
of dear alma mater. Things are going along as usual;
the lark is on the wing; the snail is on the thorn;
even the lowly worms have found their place—they
arc on student committees. God is in his Heaven and
wc are doing our bit to make earth into a better and
finer place like Stanford.
It was very comforting to come back and find that
in the midst of all the alarums and excursions which
make the world change as fast as a movie star's matri
monial status, Stanford is the same serene temple it
always has been. The mud puddles on the Row are as
deep as ever. The red-tiled roofs have not faded one
.shade. The Daily shack still looks as though a riot
had been interrupted by a cyclone. And over all the
campus hovers the spirit of joyous industry that is so
typical of Stanford.

Everything possible is done to shelter us from the
storms of life that assail those poor fleeced lambs
who go to other schools. When the Big Game Bonfire
excites Stanford women so that there are "several
cases of hysteria," our Olympians frown on the bonfire
and tell it to stop annoying defenseless women. Such
loving paternalism guides our groping intellects on
ward toward the heights.
The weather out here has been very fine recently.
In fact it has vaguely approximated the glories de
scribed in the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce
advertisements. I might even believe that this sort of
weather happens occasionally if the Californians were
n't going around shouting about it and looking as sur
prised as a coach who finds a man named Smith on
his squad.

Working on The Daily is actually a pleasure this
quarter. The campus is so busy and active that a big
story comes in for every issue. And subjects for col
umns practically stalk me. They jump out from be
hind every corner and beg to be immortalized in type
metal. I haven't had to pad out a single column since
I got back. The beauty of this is that it gives me
more time to think of you. And of course, my studies
are so easy that they don't take up any time at all.
The profs don't expect more than a couple of minutes'
work per day out of you. And so I can spend prac
tically all the time musing upon the glory that is
Marjie.

The one note of sadness in this symphony of joy is
that you are not here. Stanford women are adorable
and very sweet, and I love them dearly (particularly
Corena, Jean, Rosie, Ruth, Eleanor, and Suzanne) but
the Greeks had a word which freely translated means
"Oh hell" and that, covers the situation nicely.
But despite my sadness I am bearing up bravely.
Stanford is so inspiring Winter Quarter.
Love,
Johnny
