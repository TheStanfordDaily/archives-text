# INSIDE CHINA

Dr. Lois Greene—December 27.
Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving on a sun
ny afternoon about 3; the children kept popping in and
out, and one time Ellen dashed out. As the door slam
med, all the windows rattled. Soon they rattled again,
particularly the porch French doors, and Ruth said,
"Oh, that is just Anne coming in." But in a moment
Ellen, Fritz, and Peggy burst in, "Those are bombs,
Mother."
Students were still playing on the field, but the
teachers had their glasses out and were watching the
sky. In a few moments the alarm went and we all
put on coats and went to the basement. There was a
gray haze of bomb smoke in the low land around Yale.
Soon we were joined by about 15 students and in a
few moments the Chinese planes went up from the
field to the north. But the damage had been done and
we wondered who was suffering now.
Frank Hutchins had been listening to the radio at
1:30 o'clock when the report came in that bombers
had left Canton flying north at 11:45. We have no
idea why the alarm was not given here, but those
must have been the same planes, for they arrived
right on time.
* * * *
The story, as we have pieced it together, was
something like this. Since Nanking is evacuating al
most everyone, the trains and roads are full of people
coming this way, and a train due at that time had
many important officials on it. This the Japanese must
have known. The train unloaded, and as the people
were passing through the stations and collecting bag
gage, the six or seven bombs fell on both sides of the
tsation within a radius of about half a city block,
but as far as I know, none of the passengers were
hurt.
The chief damage was done through a direct hit on
a hotel, one of the flimsy kind apt to be found near
railway stations, but full of people and with a wedding
feast in session. Some warehouses were hit, and a lot
of wood oil leaked away, but there were no serious
fires. The reports seem to be that about 30 or 40 were
killed, and 100 seriously wounded, while 50 houses
went down from the concussion.
* * * *
No one knows why the warning was not given in
Changsha at this time, but each day since then there
have been warnings. Each time the defending planes,
7 to 11 of them, have gone up promptly and have
soared around for an hour. Yesterday the Japanese
are supposed to have come within 15 miles of Chang
sha.
. . . Nanking is now stripped for action with 200,-
000 good troops in it, and supported by about 20
speedy Russian planes in addition to the Chinese.
The Japanese say they will have it by January 1.
The Chinese say they can hold out for a long time.
After that, they threaten to come on up the river,
laying cities low as they come. I mentioned that they
had bombed the lovely little city of Soochow almost
into ruins, and last night the nurses and doctors from
the hospitals there and near by arrived in town.

most everyone, the trains and roads are full of people
coming this way, and a train due at that time had
many important officials on it. This the Japanese must
have known. The train unloaded, and as the people
were passing through the stations and collecting bag
gage, the six or seven bombs fell on both sides of the
tsation within a radius of about half a city block,
but as far as I know, none of the passengers were
hurt.
The chief damage was done through a direct hit on
a hotel, one of the flimsy kind apt to be found near
railway stations, but full of people and with a wedding
feast in session. Some warehouses were hit, and a lot
of wood oil leaked away, but there were no serious
fires. The reports seem to be that about 30 or 40 were
killed, and 100 seriously wounded, while 50 houses
went down from the concussion.

No one knows why the warning was not given in
Changsha at this time, but each day since then there
have been warnings. Each time the defending planes,
7 to 11 of them, have gone up promptly and have
soared around for an hour. Yesterday the Japanese
are supposed to have come within 15 miles of Chang
sha.
. . . Nanking is now stripped for action with 200,-
000 good troops in it, and supported by about 20
speedy Russian planes in addition to the Chinese.
The Japanese say they will have it by January 1.
The Chinese say they can hold out for a long time.
After that, they threaten to come on up the river,
laying cities low as they come. I mentioned that they
had bombed the lovely little city of Soochow almost
into ruins, and last night the nurses and doctors from
the hospitals there and near by arrived in town.

Dr. Lois Greene—December 27.
Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving on a sun
ny afternoon about 3; the children kept popping in and
out, and one time Ellen dashed out. As the door slam
med, all the windows rattled. Soon they rattled again,
particularly the porch French doors, and Ruth said,
"Oh, that is just Anne coming in." But in a moment
Ellen, Fritz, and Peggy burst in, "Those are bombs,
Mother."
Students were still playing on the field, but the
teachers had their glasses out and were watching the
sky. In a few moments the alarm went and we all
put on coats and went to the basement. There was a
gray haze of bomb smoke in the low land around Yale.
Soon we were joined by about 15 students and in a
few moments the Chinese planes went up from the
field to the north. But the damage had been done and
we wondered who was suffering now.
Frank Hutchins had been listening to the radio at
1:30 o'clock when the report came in that bombers
had left Canton flying north at 11:45. We have no
idea why the alarm was not given here, but those
must have been the same planes, for they arrived
right on time.
* * * *
The story, as we have pieced it together, was
something like this. Since Nanking is evacuating al
most everyone, the trains and roads are full of people
coming this way, and a train due at that time had
many important officials on it. This the Japanese must
have known. The train unloaded, and as the people
were passing through the stations and collecting bag
