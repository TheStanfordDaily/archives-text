# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO PROPAGANDA 
### 
The Ecutor, air:
Several nights ago Professor Ichi
hashi spoke on the Japanese war.
"A few persons left the hall in
dignant. Others, less idealistic, felt
cheated," said an editorial in The
Daily. This is an example of the
famous Stanford open, mind. The
students who expected a shamed ad
mission of guilt found instead a de
fense for Japan's actions, and the
next day they denounced Ichihashi
as being prejudiced.
Ichihashi is accused of doing no
more than rehashing opinions given
by Japan's consul. It is just possible
that the Japanese consul could have
had a small basis of fact underneath
some of his statements. Diplomacy
does not automatically predict prop
aganda and all propaganda is not
untrue.
Ichihashi was forced onto the de
fensive side by smug student opinion
based on superficial bull session
ideas. Only the day before his
speech he was warned that he would
face a hostile audience.
This is not to defend either Japan's
actions nor Dr. Ichihashi's statements
but rather to point out that Stan
ford students, supposedly tolerant
thinking adults, have accepted with
out question well pointed Hearst
propaganda and denounced Japan
without a fair hearing.
