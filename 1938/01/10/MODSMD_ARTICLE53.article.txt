# Eloesser Says Madrid Faces Lack of Food
## 
### LYNNE ASHTON 
"Food is scarce in Madrid," de
clared Dr. Leo Eloesser, clinical
professor of surgery in the Stanford
Medical School, now with a med
ical unit in Spain, in an article
published yesterday in the "This
World" magazine of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
"At 7 a.m., 12 noon, and 7 p.m.,"
he continues, "the hotel is filled by
a rugged, mud-encrusted horde of
soldiers on leave, looking for a
j room with a bath, and most espe
i cially for a man with a cigarette,
! for of tobacco there is none in
j Madrid."
Of the quality of civilian diet in
I general, however, Dr. Eloesser says,
i "Of calories, 1 think, sufficient. Of
• vitamins, practically none."
Dr. Irving Busch, second in com
j mand to Dr. Edward Barsky, who
j heads the unit, has found means,
j Eloesser says, to supply the hospi
| tal patients with a much better
i quality of food, with "occasionally
jan egg for soft diet patients. How
[he gets 'em unless he lays 'em, 1
j don't know!"
Pressing Needs
The most pressing needs, Dr.
| Eloesser reports, are: (1) money to
J construct base hospitals for patients
who can be sent back from the front
lines; (2) light chassis trucks, rather
than ambulances, to be converted
into mobile, light ambulances in
Spain; (3) vitamin products, drugs
or dry vegetables, tomato and
grapefruit juice in tins, cod liver oil
concentrates, etc.; and (4) cutting
surgical instruments.
"The use of the Bard-Parker
I type (with detachable blades) has
become so general in the U.S. that
1 think there is scarcely a hospital
that would not give, or sell for very
little, scalpels of the old type that
lie around on their shelves and
would be very useful here," says
the doctor in concluding his list of
rvtpmi ailiftee eencmwf pymcmshh
imperative needs.
Need Lights
Deficiencies in the electric cur
rent have made it difficult for the
unit to light wards or to make use
of X-ray machines, etc. Dr. Barsky
assembled the doctors, nurses, scul- j
lery maids, and some of the towns- j
people to make a report on this '
condition, explaining that 15.000
pesetas would provide them with
adequate lighting.
"Immediately he had finished,"
Dr. Eloesser comments, "a half
dozen men made speeches propos
ing ways of raising money among
themselves, such as contributing
half their wages.
"The representative of the village
committee said he'd give half of all
the money paid out to him for work
done. "Their eagerness to give help
made one ashamed of the apathy at
home.'

| NEW YORK, Jan. 9 (UP).—Mrs.
i Katherine B. Pearce complained to
I police today that her home had
been robbed. She said the burglar
i took, among other things a .38 cal
iber pistol. The police arrested Mrs.
Pearce and charged her with illegal
possession of a gun.

i took, among other things a .38 cal
iber pistol. The police arrested Mrs.
Pearce and charged her with illegal
possession of a gun.
"Food is scarce in Madrid," de
clared Dr. Leo Eloesser, clinical
professor of surgery in the Stanford
Medical School, now with a med
ical unit in Spain, in an article
published yesterday in the "This
World" magazine of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
"At 7 a.m., 12 noon, and 7 p.m.,"
he continues, "the hotel is filled by
a rugged, mud-encrusted horde of
soldiers on leave, looking for a
j room with a bath, and most espe
i cially for a man with a cigarette,
! for of tobacco there is none in
j Madrid."
Of the quality of civilian diet in
I general, however, Dr. Eloesser says,
i "Of calories, 1 think, sufficient. Of
• vitamins, practically none."
Dr. Irving Busch, second in com
j mand to Dr. Edward Barsky, who
j heads the unit, has found means,
j Eloesser says, to supply the hospi
| tal patients with a much better
i quality of food, with "occasionally
jan egg for soft diet patients. How
[he gets 'em unless he lays 'em, 1
j don't know!"
Pressing Needs
The most pressing needs, Dr.
| Eloesser reports, are: (1) money to
J construct base hospitals for patients
who can be sent back from the front
lines; (2) light chassis trucks, rather
than ambulances, to be converted
into mobile, light ambulances in
Spain; (3) vitamin products, drugs
or dry vegetables, tomato and
grapefruit juice in tins, cod liver oil
concentrates, etc.; and (4) cutting
surgical instruments.
"The use of the Bard-Parker
I type (with detachable blades) has
become so general in the U.S. that
1 think there is scarcely a hospital
that would not give, or sell for very
little, scalpels of the old type that
lie around on their shelves and
would be very useful here," says
the doctor in concluding his list of
rvtpmi ailiftee eencmwf pymcmshh
imperative needs.
Need Lights
Deficiencies in the electric cur
rent have made it difficult for the
unit to light wards or to make use
of X-ray machines, etc. Dr. Barsky
assembled the doctors, nurses, scul- j
lery maids, and some of the towns- j
people to make a report on this '
condition, explaining that 15.000
pesetas would provide them with
adequate lighting.
"Immediately he had finished,"
Dr. Eloesser comments, "a half
dozen men made speeches propos
ing ways of raising money among
themselves, such as contributing
half their wages.
"The representative of the village
committee said he'd give half of all
the money paid out to him for work
done. "Their eagerness to give help
made one ashamed of the apathy at
home.'
