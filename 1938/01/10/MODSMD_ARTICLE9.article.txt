# Jewelry Nabbed In Saturday Theft
## 
### 
Approximately $100 worth of jew
elry and various other valuables was
stolen Saturday evening from Bed
lam Gables, a cottage in Menlo
Heights occupied by Stanford seniors
Dave Botsford, John Rice, and Art
Stokes.
Stokes returned to his residence at
about 8:15 to find two men ransack
ing the house. As he entered
through the front door, the two
fled by way of a rear kitchen en
trance.
The fact that the two marauders
overlooked several articles of con
siderably more value than much of
their loot indicates that the two
were probably not professional bur
glars.
Police after a thorough investiga
tion at the house were unable to
name any definite suspects.
