# Ten Killed In Montana Plane Crash
## Eastbound Liner Drops into Wooded Canyon Near Bozeman, Burns 
### 
BUTTE, Mont., Jan. 10 (UP).â€”A
Northwest Airways plane crashed
and burned in heavily wooded
Bridger Canyon northeast of Boze
man, Mont., late this afternoon. The
airline reported that two pilots
from Billings found the missing
plane. All aboard were killed.
The plane, a Lockheed Zephyr,
was en route from Seattle to Chi
cago with eight passengers and a
crew of two aboard. Northwest
Airways reported that it was the
first accident they had had on the
line in 11 years.
Elmer Johnson, ranch hand, re
ported to the United States Forest
Service that he saw a plane circle
an open clearing in the forest and
then drop out of sight. After it
apparently had been down several
minutes, he said he saw smoke ris
ing from the clearing.
Plane Off Course
it is believed that the plane was
about 6 miles off its course.
Johnson, Luther Yadon, another
rancher, four sheriff's deputies and
U. S. Forest Ranger L. E. Ewan
started for the clearing.
They will not be able to report
for several hours since they must
go on horseback seven miles from
the highway through heavy snow
to reach the clearing and then re
turn to the Alfred Nickles ranch
before they can communicate with
the outside world.
Last report of the plane was at
3:05, when Co-pilot West checked
in with routine flight information.
Leaving Butte at 2:05, the plane
was due in Billings at 3:47. It was
piloted by Nick Mamer, pioneer
Northwest flyer.

agent for the airlines, was aboard
