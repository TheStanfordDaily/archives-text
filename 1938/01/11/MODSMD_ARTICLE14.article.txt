# Loyalists Take Hill Near Teruel
## 
### 
TERUEL, Spain, via Barcelona,
| Jan. 10 (UP). —Government troops
j tonight stormed and captured La
. Muola Hill, a ragged mountain
j fang dominating this Aragonese
city, in a victory described by the
Loyalist high command as "more
important and heroic than the cap
ture of Teruel itself."
The hill, rising behind a plateau
a mile and a half northwest of
Teruel, fell to General Vicente
Rojo's troops after heavy artillery
bombardment.
Until "the tooth of Teruel" was
taken, the government's hold on the
city was insecure and rebel guns
atop the peak might at any time
start a destructive bombardment of
the ctiy below. The peak dominates
four important roads—to Concud on
the north, Bezas on the west, La
Puebla to the southeast and Villel
to the south.
