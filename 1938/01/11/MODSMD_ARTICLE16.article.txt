# REVOLT AT ROBLE
## EDITORIAL 
### 
Roble's revolution against the Stanford sorority system, be
sides being a demonstration of mob hysteria that would send the
Big Game Bonfire to the corner sobbing with shame, is moreover
a graphic indication that the sorority problem can no longer be
passed over lightly.
When women who are certain of going the house they de
sire become sufficiently aroused over the evils of Stanford's
setup, over the tears of disappointed roommates, to consider
refusing their bids (even if in reality there is not a chance that
they will) it is time to put the house in order.
Something must be done about Stanford's sorority problem.
It must be done soon.
There is no longer justification for a setup which was faulty
even before the number of Stanford women was increased, that
today allows only one-third of the freshman women to join one
of the nine houses on the campus and turns at least another third
away to flood Roble halfway down to the Quad.
There is no reason why Stanford should continue to tolerate
a system made acute by the increase of women and no increase
in the number of sororities.
There are two alternatives.
Stanford must either (1) increase the number of sororities or
it must (2) wipe them out entirely.
Objection to proposal number one is a Uni
versity regulation which provides that there
shall be no increase in the number of sororities.
That this ruling could be waived is not impos
sible, however.
Plan number two, that sororities be removed
from the Stanford campus, is more feasible for
it would lead to a definite obliteration of the
problem.
To do this it would be necessary for each
house voluntarily to turn in its charter. It would
then be a University problem to find housing
facilities for the women involved.
Roble's uprising gives impetus to this solu
tion.
Dean of Women Mary Yost yesterday guar
anteed Roble sponsors to find housing for the
118 women who would not go into houses next
fall, and also to take over the indebtedness of
the houses in the event that the freshman action
leads to their disbandment. The University's
stand on the guestion is clearly indicated in
this action.
But any move of this sort must come from
the houses themselves through their Pan-Hel
lenic Council.
Twice before has the feeling against Stan
ford's sorority system become hot enough to
geyser to the surface.
In both cases movements have sprung from
within the major houses themselves, advocating
the wiping out of sororities at Stanford. In both
cases the very mention of such action has
brought alumnae like locusts to swarm and
stifle the thought.

This time the freshmen have taken action.
If they should refuse to pledge, which is un
likely, the alumnae are powerless. The houses
must go.
However, from within sororities themselves
comes opposition to their abandonment. Tra
dition, brotherhood, fraternal spirit, are not ex
tinguishable with one stroke.
It would be a supreme sacrifice for certain
sorority members to forfeit their charters. It
would be sacrilege. Still, it is one way out.
Pan-Hellenic Council cannot step around the
corner from this latest incident. If nothing
more, it serves notice that the iron is hot. Now
is the time for action.
Whether it attempts to receive University
sanction to increase the number of sororities
(despite the administration's stubborn refusal to
do this for years) or whether it solicits help from
its member sororities to abandon the houses, is
a problem its representatives from the houses
must decide.
However, it must solicit help from the Uni
versity administration, which could probably
handle the problem alone if it wished to, through
its manipulation of the financial strings it holds
on the puppet sororities.
It must examine alternatives, probe public
opinion, get into the heart of the problem.
Pan-Hellenic Council and the University ad
ministration can mend Stanford's sorority sys
tem.
Its faults are not fictional when anxious fresh
man women temporarily disregard personal
ambition and consider revolt.

It must be done soon.
There is no longer justification for a setup which was faulty
even before the number of Stanford women was increased, that
today allows only one-third of the freshman women to join one
of the nine houses on the campus and turns at least another third
away to flood Roble halfway down to the Quad.
There is no reason why Stanford should continue to tolerate
a system made acute by the increase of women and no increase
in the number of sororities.
There are two alternatives.
Stanford must either (1) increase the number of sororities or
it must (2) wipe them out entirely.
Objection to proposal number one is a Uni
versity regulation which provides that there
shall be no increase in the number of sororities.
That this ruling could be waived is not impos
sible, however.
Plan number two, that sororities be removed
from the Stanford campus, is more feasible for
it would lead to a definite obliteration of the
problem.
To do this it would be necessary for each
house voluntarily to turn in its charter. It would
then be a University problem to find housing
facilities for the women involved.
Roble's uprising gives impetus to this solu
tion.
Dean of Women Mary Yost yesterday guar
anteed Roble sponsors to find housing for the
118 women who would not go into houses next
fall, and also to take over the indebtedness of
the houses in the event that the freshman action
leads to their disbandment. The University's
stand on the guestion is clearly indicated in
this action.
But any move of this sort must come from
the houses themselves through their Pan-Hel
lenic Council.
Twice before has the feeling against Stan
ford's sorority system become hot enough to
geyser to the surface.
In both cases movements have sprung from
within the major houses themselves, advocating
the wiping out of sororities at Stanford. In both
cases the very mention of such action has
brought alumnae like locusts to swarm and
stifle the thought.

This time the freshmen have taken action.
If they should refuse to pledge, which is un
likely, the alumnae are powerless. The houses
must go.
However, from within sororities themselves
comes opposition to their abandonment. Tra
dition, brotherhood, fraternal spirit, are not ex
tinguishable with one stroke.
It would be a supreme sacrifice for certain
sorority members to forfeit their charters. It
would be sacrilege. Still, it is one way out.
Pan-Hellenic Council cannot step around the
corner from this latest incident. If nothing
more, it serves notice that the iron is hot. Now
is the time for action.
Whether it attempts to receive University
sanction to increase the number of sororities
(despite the administration's stubborn refusal to
do this for years) or whether it solicits help from
its member sororities to abandon the houses, is
a problem its representatives from the houses
must decide.
However, it must solicit help from the Uni
versity administration, which could probably
handle the problem alone if it wished to, through
its manipulation of the financial strings it holds
on the puppet sororities.
It must examine alternatives, probe public
opinion, get into the heart of the problem.
Pan-Hellenic Council and the University ad
ministration can mend Stanford's sorority sys
tem.
Its faults are not fictional when anxious fresh
man women temporarily disregard personal
ambition and consider revolt.
Roble's revolution against the Stanford sorority system, be
sides being a demonstration of mob hysteria that would send the
Big Game Bonfire to the corner sobbing with shame, is moreover
a graphic indication that the sorority problem can no longer be
passed over lightly.
When women who are certain of going the house they de
sire become sufficiently aroused over the evils of Stanford's
setup, over the tears of disappointed roommates, to consider
refusing their bids (even if in reality there is not a chance that
they will) it is time to put the house in order.
