# REVOLT AT ROBLE
## EDITORIAL 
### 
Roble's revolution against the Stanford sorority system, be
sides being a demonstration of mob hysteria that would send the
Big Game Bonfire to the corner sobbing with shame, is moreover
a graphic indication that the sorority problem can no longer be
passed over lightly.
When women who are certain of going the house they de
sire become sufficiently aroused over the evils of Stanford's
setup, over the tears of disappointed roommates, to consider
refusing their bids (even if in reality there is not a chance that
they will) it is time to put the house in order.
Something must be done about Stanford's sorority problem.
It must be done soon.
There is no longer justification for a setup which was faulty
even before the number of Stanford women was increased, that
today allows only one-third of the freshman women to join one
of the nine houses on the campus and turns at least another third
away to flood Roble halfway down to the Quad.
There is no reason why Stanford should continue to tolerate
a system made acute by the increase of women and no increase
in the number of sororities.
There are two alternatives.
Stanford must either (1) increase the number of sororities or
it must (2) wipe them out entirely.
