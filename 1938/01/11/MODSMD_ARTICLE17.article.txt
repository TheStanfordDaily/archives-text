# Cellar Must Keep Out Of Red Say Directors
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Editor's note.—This is the second of two articles designed to look
behind the small piece of pie and diminutive steak and into the problems
that face the management of the Union Cellar. From this "behind the
scenes" view The Daily hopes to join with Union directors in solving the
Cellar problem.

In the way of lowering prices or enlarging portions served at the Cellar
lies one great obstacle. The Daily was told last week in interviews with
officials concerned.
Unpredictability of food and labor costs would make dangerous a policy
of losing money on the Cellar unit of the Union. Any unforeseen rise in

would put the amount of loss
j completely out of control, it was
j contended.
Officials Give Views
Of the officials interviewed. Pro
fessor William B. Owens, chairman
of the Union Board of Governors;
Christine Ricker, Union director;
and Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson,
none considered dropping the Union
dollar from tuition particularly un
wise, all agreed that it would not
cure the essential complaint about
Cellar food.
It was asked, however, what would
j be used as a criterion of how much
; the Cellar would have to lose in
| order to stop complaints.
Arguments Against Loss
I Three other arguments against
I taking a loss on the Cellar were of
fered:
| 1. Losing money is not a good
! business practice.
2. Perhaps the Cellar is taking a
; loss now. A profit could be shown
i by not charging some items of over
head to other units.
3. Perhaps making the Union resi
dence dining hall bear a larger share
of a student debt is wrong since it
is in reality a University property.
It is possible, one official said, that
I under the present accounting sys
l tern the Cellar is not bearing its
; share of the common burden of
j maintenance with the otl.er units of
i the Union.
Cellar a Hybrid
Also, since the plate dinners served
'at the Cellar are from the main
| kitchen that also serves the dining
i hall and the residence dining hall, it
could be possible that they are not
being paid for in full from Cellar
receipts.
This kitchen was originally part of
the Union organization. At the pres
ent time it is a sort of hybrid. It
serves the tables of the Union resi
dence hall for women, gives the
Union its largest single item of profit.
Profits to Students
But this is the only dining hall the
profits of which go to student uses.
Profits from other hall dining rooms
go into the University's general fund.
It could be considered that the Uni
versity is giving the students the
money to pay off their theater debt.
And, the proportion paid by these
profits would be larger, if the Cellar
lost money.
The general impression that the
editors found in their interviews was
that the Cellar should pay its own
way. II The Daily could prove that
restaurants with comparable costs
gave more food or charged less, then
something should be done; otherwise
no changes were indicated.
Other Problems
Officials also thought that there
were other problems in the Cellar
setup that could not be solved. They
explained that the Cellar was origi
nally planned as a soft drink parlor,
and might never be satisfactory as a
restaurant.
The capacity has been raised by
the addition at the rear, but it was
impossible to enlarge the kitchen.
Consequently, food for plate dinners
still must be prepared in the main
dining room kitchen.
Finally, the officials took the view
that there had been complaints about
food since Adam tried to eat Eve's
first biscuits. And. they suggested,
there would be complaints about
the Cellar no matter what was done.
Tomorrow The Daily will present
its solution to the Union Cellar prob
lem after having viewed the argu
ments pro and con as presented in
the foregoing articles.

could be possible that they are not
being paid for in full from Cellar
receipts.
This kitchen was originally part of
the Union organization. At the pres
ent time it is a sort of hybrid. It
serves the tables of the Union resi
dence hall for women, gives the
Union its largest single item of profit.
Profits to Students
But this is the only dining hall the
profits of which go to student uses.
Profits from other hall dining rooms
go into the University's general fund.
It could be considered that the Uni
versity is giving the students the
money to pay off their theater debt.
And, the proportion paid by these
profits would be larger, if the Cellar
lost money.
The general impression that the
editors found in their interviews was
that the Cellar should pay its own
way. II The Daily could prove that
restaurants with comparable costs
gave more food or charged less, then
something should be done; otherwise
no changes were indicated.
Other Problems
Officials also thought that there
were other problems in the Cellar
setup that could not be solved. They
explained that the Cellar was origi
nally planned as a soft drink parlor,
and might never be satisfactory as a
restaurant.
The capacity has been raised by
the addition at the rear, but it was
impossible to enlarge the kitchen.
Consequently, food for plate dinners
still must be prepared in the main
dining room kitchen.
Finally, the officials took the view
that there had been complaints about
food since Adam tried to eat Eve's
first biscuits. And. they suggested,
there would be complaints about
the Cellar no matter what was done.
Tomorrow The Daily will present
its solution to the Union Cellar prob
lem after having viewed the argu
ments pro and con as presented in
the foregoing articles.
Editor's note.—This is the second of two articles designed to look
behind the small piece of pie and diminutive steak and into the problems
that face the management of the Union Cellar. From this "behind the
scenes" view The Daily hopes to join with Union directors in solving the
Cellar problem.

In the way of lowering prices or enlarging portions served at the Cellar
lies one great obstacle. The Daily was told last week in interviews with
officials concerned.
Unpredictability of food and labor costs would make dangerous a policy
of losing money on the Cellar unit of the Union. Any unforeseen rise in

would put the amount of loss
j completely out of control, it was
j contended.
Officials Give Views
Of the officials interviewed. Pro
fessor William B. Owens, chairman
of the Union Board of Governors;
Christine Ricker, Union director;
and Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson,
none considered dropping the Union
dollar from tuition particularly un
wise, all agreed that it would not
cure the essential complaint about
Cellar food.
It was asked, however, what would
j be used as a criterion of how much
; the Cellar would have to lose in
| order to stop complaints.
Arguments Against Loss
I Three other arguments against
I taking a loss on the Cellar were of
fered:
| 1. Losing money is not a good
! business practice.
2. Perhaps the Cellar is taking a
; loss now. A profit could be shown
i by not charging some items of over
head to other units.
3. Perhaps making the Union resi
dence dining hall bear a larger share
of a student debt is wrong since it
is in reality a University property.
It is possible, one official said, that
I under the present accounting sys
l tern the Cellar is not bearing its
; share of the common burden of
j maintenance with the otl.er units of
i the Union.
