# Cellar Must Keep Out Of Red Say Directors
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Editor's note.—This is the second of two articles designed to look
behind the small piece of pie and diminutive steak and into the problems
that face the management of the Union Cellar. From this "behind the
scenes" view The Daily hopes to join with Union directors in solving the
Cellar problem.

In the way of lowering prices or enlarging portions served at the Cellar
lies one great obstacle. The Daily was told last week in interviews with
officials concerned.
Unpredictability of food and labor costs would make dangerous a policy
of losing money on the Cellar unit of the Union. Any unforeseen rise in

; the Cellar would have to lose in
| order to stop complaints.
Arguments Against Loss
I Three other arguments against
I taking a loss on the Cellar were of

! business practice.
2. Perhaps the Cellar is taking a
; loss now. A profit could be shown
i by not charging some items of over
head to other units.
3. Perhaps making the Union resi
dence dining hall bear a larger share
of a student debt is wrong since it
is in reality a University property.
It is possible, one official said, that
I under the present accounting sys
l tern the Cellar is not bearing its
; share of the common burden of
j maintenance with the otl.er units of
i the Union.
Cellar a Hybrid
Also, since the plate dinners served
'at the Cellar are from the main
| kitchen that also serves the dining
i hall and the residence dining hall, it
