# Excom To Hear China Aid Plan
## Reception Slated For Stevens Delegates 
### 
Because of women's rushing, and
the Salzburg Opera Guild concert
tonight, Ex Committee's meeting
will be brief and to the point.
Up for consideration will be the
question of the formation and sanc
tion of a relief work group for
China. Such a group, if it is formed
on the campus, will be strictly non
partisan, in contrast to the group
formed for medical aid in Spain.
Discussion of plans for the enter
tainment of the Stevens' College
women who will be spending a
week-end at Stanford next spring
will also take place. Approximately
300 women are expected to visit the
campus on their annual tour.
Final consideration of Pomona
College's request for a concert date
for their Men's Glee Club will be
brought up before the body tonight.
The granting of letter awards to the
polo team will also occur.
With Carl Sandburg scheduled
to speak on Stanford's initial
attempt at a lecture series, the ques
tion of a more extensive series next
year will be considered. Appoint
ments to the Public Exercises Com
mittee will be made.
