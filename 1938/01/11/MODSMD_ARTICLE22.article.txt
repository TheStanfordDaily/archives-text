# Seven Tagged For Parking Offenses

### 
Evidently warning tags given out
to cars parked in the semi-circle
outside of Memorial Hall were not
sufficiently emphatic, for according
to Officer Gordy Davis seven
summons were issued to violators
of the no-parking rule yesterday.
During the autumn term warning
tags were given out to violators
practically every day and this term
campus police have announced their
intentions to enforce the regulation.
The semi-circle was originally in
tended to afford motorists a con
venient turning ax - ea.
