# Mutiny Against Sorority Set-Up Brews at Roble
## Freshmen Women May Refuse Bids On Eve of Pledging 
### 
A movement against sororities, starting in a bull-session of a few
freshmen women and gathering headway until it was hall-wide, was
launched in Roble last Sunday night, it was revealed yesterday.
Fostered by women almost assured of bids, the movement took the
form of a plan to refuse all bids tendered next Saturday by the houses.

An outgrowth of the high feeling
always attendant during rushing,
the movement was strengthened
when the women who received
rushing invitations saw the effects
of the inevitable discrimination of
the system on the other women, it
was reported.
Disappointments Cited
According to the freshmen, they
realized for the first time how the
system broke up friendships and
caused disappointment and even ill
health among the women.
Discussions of the problem con
tinued until early yesterday morn
ing, resulting in a conference yes
terday between Helen Dohrmann,
Roble president; Jean Bird, head
sponsor, Jackie Brown, sponsor, and
University officials.
University will. House
Dean Mary Yost, speaking for the
University, reported that if the plan
is carried through, the University
would immediately assume all re
sponsibility for housing the women.
Since the move might result in the
abolition of sororities from the
campus, the University would also
assume the responsibility for work
ing out a plan of meeting the finan
cial obligations of the houses.
Rumors Sweep Campus
As rumors of the movement swept
the campus, various opinions werp
voiced by persons on both sides of
the fence. A housemother in one of
the sororities agreed with the gen
eral feeling that the move has been
coming on for a number of years.
"If the equivalent of the benefits
which a girl derives from a sorority
can be offered in small open resi
dence units, there is no reason why
sororities should not go. At pres
ent, however, I do not believe the
advantages of hall living groups
equal those of a house.
Learn Co-operation
"Girls in small closed groups like
a sorority learn co-operation and
subordination of the individual for
the benefit of the whole; girls in
changing open residence units tend
more towards individuality. Yet,
since the tendency of modern life is
more and more towards individual
ity, I think the abolition of sorori
ties is a coming thing."
Speaking with difficulty between
emotional stammers and actual
sobs, one freshman woman voiced
the following opinion over the phone
as representative for a group of
anonymous members of her class:
Friends Heartbroken
"It's—it's just that so many of our
friends are just heartbroken over
it—that we don't think it's all quite
fair. We think that something's
wrong somewhere. We like the
sorority girls, but we think that
something should be done to make
their system fairer all around."
A rush chairman from one of the
Row houses said of the movement
in Roble:
"Really, we don't know much
about it. Those things flare up now
and then, but—well really, we have
no ideas on the subject. Make up
your own opinion."
She added that she thought the
drive might succeed, "Oh—maybe in
20 years."
Defending the organizations of
which she is a member, a sorority
house president stated that she felt
sororities definitely did have a
place in Stanford life, and should
not be abolished at any cost.
