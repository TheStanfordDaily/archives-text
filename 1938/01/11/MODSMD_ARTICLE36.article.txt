# Hoopsters Warm Up For S. C. Tilt Friday
## 
### 
Reappearance of Art Stoefen and Tom Siebert on the basketball scene
yesterday, Stoefen after a three-day stay in the hospital with a cold and
Siebert after a lapse of eligibility, retinted the varsity to its original hue
as outstanding contender on the Coast this year.
Both centers, the two tallest lads on the squad have only four days

this week in which to get back into,
shape for the U.S.C. battles this
week-end. Stoefen, in spite of his
cold, is probably in better condition,
since he performed throughout the
eastern junket over vacation.
Siebert Wears Specks
Siebert is equipped with contact
lens spectacles this season, which
should eliminate the trouble he had
with his eyes as a freshman. He will
compete with Nellie Heath for the
second-string center spot, since
Stuefen takes over at the top spot.
Yesterday was designated as cam
era day by Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C.
news service director, and photogra
phers from various bay region news-

papers kept Captain Hank Luisetti
and his mates jumping through a lot
of crazy antics for three-quarters of
an hour before practice began.
Team Dons New Uniforms
The first team showed up for pic
tures garbed in their new uniforms
for the year, white cotton shirts and
gaudy white silk pants trimmed in
reel. Numerals are red.
The practice session found Bunn
giving his team a little more drill on
plays for the Trojan series, and then
directing them through light rebound
and fast break practice. Considering
the outfit in pretty good condition,
the coach says he will give them only
a 10-minute scrimmage session Wed
nesday for their hardest work this
week.
The first team now consists of the
five men who were tops during most
of the vacation tour â€” Luisetti and
Phil Zonne, forwards; Lee and Cal
derwood, guards, and Stoefen, cen
ter. Unless there is some unexpected
development this week, that team
will start Friday night against U.S.C.
according to Bunn.
