# Frosh Cagers Gun For New Laurels
## 
### 
With four straight victories under
their belts, Stanford's freshman
basketballers are gunning for two
more triumphs come this week-end
when they take on Lowell and
Stockton High Schols in prelimi
naries to the two varsity tilts with
Southern California.
Following their loss to Marin J. C.,
the yearlings have bounded back
with wins over Santa Rosa J. C.,
Placer J. C., Marin and Washington
High.
In a short offensive drill yester
day, Coach Wytze Gorter's neo
phytes looked especially good and
the young mentor is hopeful that
they are finally ready to put on
the steam.
Several substitutes stole the show
in yesterday's drill, including Bill
Rumbley, tall center; Mike Mar
shall, half-pint forward; and Don
Burness, guard. Rumbley prac
tically monopolized all the tip-ins
and looked all fired up to make a
strong bid for the starting berth.
Gorter is well satisfied with the
Cardinals' set defense and once the
offense rounds into form, he is con
fident the team will be a match for
any opponent on its schedule.
Both frosh games this week-end
should be thrillers as Lowell and
Stockton boast powerful aggrega
tions and will be laying for the
Papooses.
