# Star Paddlers Are Eligible
## Towne, Winkleman In Fold; Vibert Out 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton foresaw a
brighter season for his varsity
swimmers yesterday with the return
of two of his outstanding lettermen
prodigals.
Don Towne, best of the Card
bi'east-strokers, managed to squeeze
by the Scholarship Committee and
thus made himself eligible for the
winter quarter. However, the com
mittee warned him that he wouldn't
be back for either the California or
the conference meets in the spring
unless his scholarship took a turn
for the better.
Winkleman Returns
Roy Winkleman, the best collegiate
diver on the coast, finally found a
means of getting together tuition
money and can now be definitely
counted upon for competition.
Jack Vibert is definitely out of the
swim, but Dick Clarke is still keep
ing up a correspondence with his
father in an attempt to win pater
nal approval. Clarke, holder of the
University 50-yard free style record
and winner of the 100-yard dash
against Cal last spring, is cursed
with an incompleted course. The
elder Mr. Clarke insists upon his
son's finishing the course before he
approves his competition.
Weak in Relay
With Towne back again, Coach
Thornton declared his squad was
now excellent in the middle and
back strokes, good in the breast
stroke, but weak in the relays and
sprints. John Brahtz is being touted
as a possible first-place man in the
short sprints, but he is in a class by
himself. Phil Neil may come along
well enough to take-a few seconds
and thirds.
Herb Wooley, a fencer turned
spring-board artist, was working
out on the planks during Winkle
man's absence. While he isn't ex
actly of the same caliber as Ail-
American '"Wink," he shows possi
bilities of developing into a fair
diver.
Mel Jacoby has returned from
China after two years and may press
Towne and Bill Hatch in the breast
stroke. Towne and Hatch finished
third and fourth in the conference
meet last year.
Two more back-strokers, Stan
Wilson and Dave Duncan, are hold
ing down the second-string jobs be
hind Hal Weatherbe.

now excellent in the middle and
back strokes, good in the breast
stroke, but weak in the relays and
sprints. John Brahtz is being touted
as a possible first-place man in the
short sprints, but he is in a class by
himself. Phil Neil may come along
well enough to take-a few seconds
and thirds.
Herb Wooley, a fencer turned
spring-board artist, was working
out on the planks during Winkle
man's absence. While he isn't ex
actly of the same caliber as Ail-
American '"Wink," he shows possi
bilities of developing into a fair
diver.
Mel Jacoby has returned from
China after two years and may press
Towne and Bill Hatch in the breast
stroke. Towne and Hatch finished
third and fourth in the conference
meet last year.
Two more back-strokers, Stan
Wilson and Dave Duncan, are hold
ing down the second-string jobs be
hind Hal Weatherbe.
YOSEMITE, Jan. 10 (UP). —The
Hoover intercollegiate winter sports
trophy went back to Los Angeles
today in the keeping of Tom Lieb
and his University of Loyola skat
ers.
Coach Nort Thornton foresaw a
brighter season for his varsity
swimmers yesterday with the return
of two of his outstanding lettermen
prodigals.
Don Towne, best of the Card
bi'east-strokers, managed to squeeze
by the Scholarship Committee and
thus made himself eligible for the
winter quarter. However, the com
mittee warned him that he wouldn't
be back for either the California or
the conference meets in the spring
unless his scholarship took a turn
for the better.
Winkleman Returns
Roy Winkleman, the best collegiate
diver on the coast, finally found a
means of getting together tuition
money and can now be definitely
counted upon for competition.
Jack Vibert is definitely out of the
swim, but Dick Clarke is still keep
ing up a correspondence with his
father in an attempt to win pater
nal approval. Clarke, holder of the
University 50-yard free style record
and winner of the 100-yard dash
against Cal last spring, is cursed
with an incompleted course. The
elder Mr. Clarke insists upon his
son's finishing the course before he
approves his competition.
Weak in Relay
With Towne back again, Coach
Thornton declared his squad was
now excellent in the middle and
back strokes, good in the breast
stroke, but weak in the relays and
sprints. John Brahtz is being touted
as a possible first-place man in the
short sprints, but he is in a class by
himself. Phil Neil may come along
well enough to take-a few seconds
and thirds.
