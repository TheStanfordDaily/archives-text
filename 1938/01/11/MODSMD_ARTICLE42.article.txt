## Tournaments Scheduled For Fryemen Winners of January 20 Ring and Mat Bouts To Receive Medals 
### GENE GEAR, Sports Editor 
It's just about that time of year
when Farm boxers and wrestlers
leave their quiet little comer of the
J gym and come out underneath
, bright lights to shine—literally.
A week from Thursday, January
i 20, the muscle men of the mat and
j squared ring will hold their annual
All-University Boxing and Wrest
ling Tournament in the Pavilion,
beginning at 7 o'clock.
Over 100 Signed
Sbmething over 100 men are
l signed up for boxing this quarter—
which should mean a largish sort
of turnout for the mtaches. Elimi
! nation bouts will be held Monday at
4:30 in the boxing room of Encina
' Gym, for the boxers, and in the
wrestling room for the wrestlers.
While they are scheduled to begin
on Monday, Coach Clayton Frye
' said yesterday that he may start
them on Friday, depending on how
many men sign up.
On the Big night, a week from
| Thursday, the wrestlers will open
; the show at 7 o'clock with matches
jin eight divisions. Then the, gym
nastic team will put on an exhibi
; tion before the boxers come out.
Boxing Finals
Then, at 8:30, the boxing finals be
| gin. It's just a little early to pre
dict such things, but the high spots
! of the evening might possibly come
when Anderson, last year's heavy
! weight champion, and Ward, frosh
I sensation, meet, and when Saun
: ders and Gallarneau, light-heavies,
come together. If, of course, these
men get as far as the finals.
' Winners of the tournaments in
both boxing and wrestling win gold
medals. But even more important,
J possibly, is the fact that winners in
1 this tournament will make up a
| large part of Mr. Frye's boxing team
I this year.
