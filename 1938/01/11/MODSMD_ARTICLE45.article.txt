Now don't let anyone tell you
| Stanford hasn't one of the finest
and most complete athletic pro
grams in the country. 'Cause we
have everything a person could ask
for. Almost.
Yes, gang, there's decidedly a
lacking element in A1 Masters &
Company's physical-education-for
the-masses curieulum. It's a light
weight basketball team.
Being a little guy, maybe we're
a wee bit biased, but we think that
we have very good grounds for ad
vocating a hoop team for the
i shorties.
LOTS OF
LITTLE HOOPSTERS
Small fellows who are good bas
ketball players are plentiful, but
they are stymied when they want to
go in for team play because of their
j size. They haven't a chance.
Of course, there's always intra
mural. And never let it be so much
as whispered that we dropped a
1 word against Stanford's fine mural
layout.' But there's an indefinable
I something which team play against
outside teams gives participants
I that mural games lack. Meeting an
outside team gives us the feeling
that we are playing for STAN
FORD, not just for rho dammit rho.
Get what we mean??
HERE'S THE
ONLY ANSWER:
And there's one answer to the
problem: A 145-pound basketball
team. Organize a hoop squad lim
ited to men weighing under 145
1 pounds, and athletic enjoyment on
I the Farm will be doubled.
Two universities in this state —
and perhaps more—have had great
success for several years with their
145-pounders. They are U.C.L.A.
i and her little brother, Cal. We
don't know very much about the
-1 latter's quintet, except for one fact:
j Every year, during their Christmas
vacation, the Bear lightiest trek
' down to God's country (Southern
I California) as if all of you didn't
| know) to meet U.C.L.A.'s peanut
' five. And that's worthwhile for our
money, any day.
BRUINS COACHED
BY FORMER PLAYER
The Bruin team is coached by a
former 145-pounder who is now a
physics instructor at the university.
The 1 boys play a long and tough
schedule—one week during Christ
mas vacation they played four
nights in succession—meeting Jay
sees, college frosh, high schools, and
'independent teams. Their reward?
A grand and glorious time, and a
I "Circle C"—it's a minor sport.
Those are the facts. For a coach,
Stanford could use a basketball
player who is doing graduate work;
or perhaps some P.E. major who
knows his hoop fundamentals. We
I think it's worth looking into, Mr.
Masters. How about giving it a try?
