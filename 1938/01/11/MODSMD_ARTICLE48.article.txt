# Frosh Tennis Ace Takes Double Win
## 
### 
â€¢
Freshman Ken Roberts fought his
way into the semi-finals of the
Hahn Novice Tennis Tournament
last Friday with two straight - set
wins, the first over Ray Stahl, 6-3,
6-0 and the second over Syd Terry
6-4, 6-2.
Although Roberts ended up in
second place on the fall frosh lad
der and was rated several notches
above both Stahl and Terry, it was
expected he would find plenty of
trouble in coming through to the
next to last round. Superior
steadiness and a superb backhand,
however, enabled him to win both
matches with ease.
