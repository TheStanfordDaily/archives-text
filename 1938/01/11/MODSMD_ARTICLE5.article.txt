# Japan Prepared To Declare War
## 
### 
TOKYO, Jan. 11 (Tuesday) (UP).
â€” Japan's supreme war council
meets with the Cabinet and Em
peror Hirohito today in the most
critical conference since Japan de
clared war on Germany in 1914, to
adopt a fundamental policy toward
China which observers believe will
include destruction of the regime of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and
a formal declaration of war.
Although greatest secrecy has
shrouded deliberations of Premier
Prince Konoye and the Cabinet, it
was believed the crisis has been
precipitated by two fundamentally
ojDposing views of the proper way
to wage war in China.
The strong military and naval
group, headed by Admiral Nobu
masa Suegetsu, has long favored an
outright declaration of war against
the present Chinese government,
and presumably carrying on intens
ive war and setting up a Japanese
controlled puppet government in
occupied areas.
