BECAUSE the city council of Palo Alto ap
proved a bond election last night, Stanford
students may worry a little less about a cough
or a sneeze a year from now.
Not quite so unrelated as they sound, the
cause and effect connect up because the bonds,
if passed, will finance a new wing to the Palo
Alto hospital. And one of the factors making
a new wing necessary is the twice yearly peak
of respiratory infections among students, which
in the past has filled the hospital and over
flowed into makeshift quarters.
To Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Director of Men's
Health Service, the Council's action is one more
step toward correcting a major fault in the cam

pus health setup. More hospital room will rem
edy a situation that he has described as serious.
From his shoulders is lifted the fear that at
some time one of the students quartered outside
the hospital may develop complications that
make regular hospital treatment necessary but
unavailable.
This year, with the Isolation Home in readi
ness to take care of a possible overflow, the
campus can await the peak of coughs and
sneezes with definite assurance that the end to
the situation is in sight.—L. L.
