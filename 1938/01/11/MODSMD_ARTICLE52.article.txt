3 N these clays when the dominant motif in basement
architecture is bombs instead of beer, the public is
as pittery about propaganda as a moralist is about
bathing suits. In fact, one of our favorite American
pastimes is the pursuit of propaganda. We harry some
disagreeable opinion through the columns of a paper,
corner it at the bottom of the page, and pierce it with
the one savage epithet, "Propaganda.
Perhaps it is pure coincidence, but the opinions
which we shatter thus are always those which clash
with our previous ideas.
Just at the moment Stanford is getting a sore
shoulder patting its back for a neat bit of ferreting.
With lightning judgment we tagged Dr. Ichihashi's
pro-Japan speech and refused to receive a word of it.
Wherefore, we point to this brillaint bit of sales re
sistance and say patronizingly that Stanford is im
mune to the propaganda virus.
* * * #
Like most Americans we believe that never again
will we be persuaded to do a rescue job on other
people's chestnuts. We point to our recent triumph
and say with the glowing pride of a child who has
resisted the temptation to drink Sani-flush, "See —
we don't believe it."
What seems forgotten is the fact that successful
propaganda like a successful criminal is never recog
nized.
Probably when we called three strikes on Dr. Ichi
hashi we exercised judgment that would make Solo
mon look like rather poor police court material. But
unfortunately we have not turned the same astound
ing judgment upon the numerous pro-China stories
that float about the campus, cropping out in The Daily
and leavening the coke conversation at th'e Union.
# * * *
r is, for instance, the charming little yarn
about Japan's dream of world domination. It gives
you a nasty feeling in the stomach to compare this
morsel with almost identical items about Germany that
circulated before the World War.
Very possibly the story has some facts behind it.
Every nation dreams of magnificence in these days
when nationalism runs the Holy Trinity a close second
in popularity. But it is interesting to note that while
the authority for the story is usually placed in the
past, the yarn itself appeared very recently. And it
appeared in the same form simultaneously in several
places.
* * ♦ #
I do not mean that the gentle little Russian men
tioned in our campus opinion was drawing a salary
from Peiping; or that he went around the country
breaking his glasses and spreading the insidious mes
sage. Nor do I doubt the validity of the dispatches
from China we printed last week.
But, it sems fairly logical to believe that some
Chinese propaganda is afloat in this country. England,
France, China, and many American commercial in
terests would benefit if they could swing the support
of the United States.
* * # *
But we calmly swallow the pro-Chinese stories and
not so calmly junk the pro-Japanese ones. Perhaps
this indiactes that Justice and Righteousness are
shooting their roll ori the Chinese. Or perhaps it in
dicates that we arc the world's greatest consumers of
propaganda.
We might take a minute off from our back patting
to consider the question. Damn clever, these Chinese.

Like most Americans we believe that never again
will we be persuaded to do a rescue job on other
people's chestnuts. We point to our recent triumph
and say with the glowing pride of a child who has
resisted the temptation to drink Sani-flush, "See —
we don't believe it."
What seems forgotten is the fact that successful
propaganda like a successful criminal is never recog
nized.
Probably when we called three strikes on Dr. Ichi
hashi we exercised judgment that would make Solo
mon look like rather poor police court material. But
unfortunately we have not turned the same astound
ing judgment upon the numerous pro-China stories
that float about the campus, cropping out in The Daily
and leavening the coke conversation at th'e Union.

r is, for instance, the charming little yarn
about Japan's dream of world domination. It gives
you a nasty feeling in the stomach to compare this
morsel with almost identical items about Germany that
circulated before the World War.
Very possibly the story has some facts behind it.
Every nation dreams of magnificence in these days
when nationalism runs the Holy Trinity a close second
in popularity. But it is interesting to note that while
the authority for the story is usually placed in the
past, the yarn itself appeared very recently. And it
appeared in the same form simultaneously in several
places.

I do not mean that the gentle little Russian men

from Peiping; or that he went around the country
breaking his glasses and spreading the insidious mes
sage. Nor do I doubt the validity of the dispatches
from China we printed last week.
But, it sems fairly logical to believe that some
Chinese propaganda is afloat in this country. England,
France, China, and many American commercial in
terests would benefit if they could swing the support
of the United States.

But we calmly swallow the pro-Chinese stories and
not so calmly junk the pro-Japanese ones. Perhaps
this indiactes that Justice and Righteousness are
shooting their roll ori the Chinese. Or perhaps it in
dicates that we arc the world's greatest consumers of
propaganda.
We might take a minute off from our back patting
to consider the question. Damn clever, these Chinese.

architecture is bombs instead of beer, the public is

pastimes is the pursuit of propaganda. We harry some
disagreeable opinion through the columns of a paper,
corner it at the bottom of the page, and pierce it with
the one savage epithet, "Propaganda.
