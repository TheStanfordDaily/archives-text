T>ROBABLY everyone who reads Colliers tor Time
knows now that one of the greatest modern feats
of memorization (outside of these freaks who can tell
you the population of every hamlet and village in Ru
mania) is due to poor eyesight. For it is impossible
for Arturo Toscanini to read an orchestral score which
is more than four inches away from the tip of his
nose; consequently he must do his reading mentally.
Tales of his photographic memory are bandied
about whenever symphony players get together; wit
nesses abound to his minute knowledge of obscure
notes in obscure works.
It is part of the aura of genius which surrounds
the Maestro.

This question of memorizing scores is one of
which musicians have differed ever since Liszt first
began playing his recitals from memory. Until that
time, playing of a work by memory had been done
only as a trick, and then usually for one composition,
only, out of a whole program. Even then, Liszt's per
formance was definitely a trick—but one which he
could pull off in the brilliant style with which he did
everything. And the fad —for that was what it was—
spread like wild-fire, until no accredited musician
could afford to present himself before an audience un
less he played from memory.

rumors of Toscanini's phenomenal mem
ory "had been filtering out of Europe for some
time, it was not until Frederick Stock followed his
example that the custom was started in the United
States.
It seems that Mr. Stock was a young sprig just be
ginning his work with the Chicago Symphony group,
and upon one occasion was playing the Liszt E-Flat
Concerto with a now-forgotten German pianist. Said
pianist, during rehearsals, made himself most obnox
ious by insisting upon tending to the business of
Maestro Stock—directing the orchestra. At each in
terruption, Stock would say patiently,
"My orchestra knows the concerto."
But the pianist couldn't be satisfied, and finally
drove Stock to the point of throwing the score onto
the floor, standing upon it, and, with a final, "My
orchestra knows the score, and so do I!" proceeding to
conduct the remainder of the rehearsal from memory.
And to further discomfit the pianist, insisting upon
performing the work next day in the same manner.
Finding that he could get along just, as well, if not
better, by conducting from memory. Stock proceeded
to do so from that time on. With one exception—he
never conducts works which include a solo perform
ance without following the score.

T>ROBABLY everyone who reads Colliers tor Time
knows now that one of the greatest modern feats
of memorization (outside of these freaks who can tell
you the population of every hamlet and village in Ru
mania) is due to poor eyesight. For it is impossible
for Arturo Toscanini to read an orchestral score which
is more than four inches away from the tip of his
nose; consequently he must do his reading mentally.
Tales of his photographic memory are bandied
about whenever symphony players get together; wit
nesses abound to his minute knowledge of obscure
notes in obscure works.
It is part of the aura of genius which surrounds
the Maestro.

This question of memorizing scores is one of
which musicians have differed ever since Liszt first
began playing his recitals from memory. Until that
time, playing of a work by memory had been done
only as a trick, and then usually for one composition,
only, out of a whole program. Even then, Liszt's per
formance was definitely a trick—but one which he
could pull off in the brilliant style with which he did
everything. And the fad —for that was what it was—
spread like wild-fire, until no accredited musician
could afford to present himself before an audience un
less he played from memory.
* * * «
rumors of Toscanini's phenomenal mem
ory "had been filtering out of Europe for some
time, it was not until Frederick Stock followed his
example that the custom was started in the United
States.
It seems that Mr. Stock was a young sprig just be
ginning his work with the Chicago Symphony group,
and upon one occasion was playing the Liszt E-Flat
Concerto with a now-forgotten German pianist. Said
pianist, during rehearsals, made himself most obnox
ious by insisting upon tending to the business of
Maestro Stock—directing the orchestra. At each in
terruption, Stock would say patiently,
"My orchestra knows the concerto."
But the pianist couldn't be satisfied, and finally
drove Stock to the point of throwing the score onto
the floor, standing upon it, and, with a final, "My
orchestra knows the score, and so do I!" proceeding to
conduct the remainder of the rehearsal from memory.
And to further discomfit the pianist, insisting upon
performing the work next day in the same manner.
Finding that he could get along just, as well, if not
better, by conducting from memory. Stock proceeded
to do so from that time on. With one exception—he
never conducts works which include a solo perform
ance without following the score.
