# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I think your editorial, "Son of the
Rising Sun," criticizing Dr. Ichi
hashi for his talk, was in bad taste.
Just because he presented the
Japanese aims and reasons for
fighting China, you threw him into
the same class as official spokesman
of the Japanese governm'ent.
You fail to take into consideration
this point: Knowing beforehand that
his speech would be subjected to
close scrutiny, and fully aware of
his position in the University, Pro
fessor Ichihashi made only state
ments backed by facts and conclu
sions drawn from his trip to the
Orient.
Because we Americans have been
hearing nothing but the Chinese
side of this conict, we are prone to
denounce, as you did, anyone who
presents the Japanese side.
In all fairness to Dr. Ichihashi,
we must bear in mind that a scholar
such as he would not stoop to propa
gandizing. Poli Sci '39
