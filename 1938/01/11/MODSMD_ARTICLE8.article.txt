# Farm to Have Opera Minus Tails Tonight
## 
### 
Opera—minus diamond horseshoe and ermine—comes to Stanford to
night, to demonstrate to the Concert Series audience the way of all women.
The Salzburg Opera Guild, with the original cast which participates in
the festival season in Austria, stops off at the Farm at 8:15 o'clock on their

coast-to-coast tour to sing Mozart's*
"Cosi Fan Tutte."
During the tour the Guild has been
widely acclaimed and critics were
full of praise during its recent ap
pearance in Los Angeles.
"A scintillating novelty, a proof
that opera need not necessarily im
ply anemic libretto and boring mu
sic. It is absolutely a knockout,"
said the Los Angeles Daily News.
"An audience which crowded Phil
harmonic Auditorium found the en
tire performance of great charm.
The voices of the several singers are
fine, and all well adapted for the
almost continuous ensemble sing
ing. The dialogue is rapid, cues given
and picked up with spontaneous
speed, and action lively throughout,"
was the opinion of the Los Angeles
Examiner.
"Real opera bouffe, blithe and
sprightly and with all the spicy in
sinuation that lurks in the airy aban
don of the music and text of a Mo
zartian score," according to Los An
geles Evening Herald and Express.
The opera itself is a typical eight
eenth century buffo with the so
phistication of the twentieth century.
The organization is devoted to
presentations of operas stressing pro
duction and ensemble rather than
star voices. Its conductor. Ernst Kre
nek, is the well-known composer of
the notorious jazz opera, "Johnny
Spielt Auf." Alberto Erede, one of
the most talented of Europe's young
er conductors, comes as musical di
rector of the Guild.
Tickets may still be obtained at
the Concert Series office for $2.50,
$2, and 51.50, and all seats are sub
ject to sell-out.
Late comers will not be admitted
until after the first act.
