# Roble Rebels Ballot Today On Pledging
## Call Meeting To Decide Action of Freshmen Regarding Soroities 
### 
Deferring a final opinion until
I hey meet again this afternoon,
Rohle women met late last night to
further consider the plan inaugu
rated Sunday night as a move
against sororities.
Decision as to whether to accept
bids Saturday was to have been set
tled last night, but because of the
absence of many of those being
rushed, final verdict was postponed
until all could be represented. Post
ponement will also give the rushees
more time to consider the problem.
The agitation originated when a
few Roble women began discussing
the system and its disadvantages. It
spread throughout the hall, and be
came so serious that a group was
sent to Dean Mary Yost to find
out the consequences if no one
pledged. She informed them that
if the move did go through, the
University would assume all obli
gations of housing the women, and
would eventually assist the houses
in working out a plan to settle their
financial obligations.
Meanwhile, rushing went on much
as usual, with the second period
ending at dinner last night. A day
of silence will be observed today.
Formal preference dinners will be
held tomorrow and Friday.
Bidding and pledging have been
set for Saturday by Pan-Hellenic
Council.
