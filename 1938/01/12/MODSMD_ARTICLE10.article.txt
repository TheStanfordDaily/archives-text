### ALLAN DRURY 
Excellent pantomime, good if not distinguished voices, pleasant scen
ery. and streamlined direction combined last night to make the Sal/burg
Opera Guild's presentation of Mozart's "Cosi fan tuttc" one of the most
successful productions iâ€¢ i Concert Series history.
Combining the lightest of plots with some of bis most enjoyable music,
the compaser tells the stor\ of two young men and their lady hives.

models of constancy and virtue. *
When a cynical friend, Alfonso,
wagers that the maidens would for
get them if given the chance, the
lovers take him up on it, and the
subsequent action describes how,
after much persuasion, they do just
that.
Show -Stealers
By the very nature of their roles,
Alfred Hollander, ;.s Alfonso, and
Aune Antti as Despina, the maid,
stole most of the individual honors.
Given the two richest parts in the
opera, and fully capable of playing
them to their comic hilt, these two
romped merrily through the eve
ning, plotting and counter-plotting
with accomplished skill.
Marisa Merlo and Esther Ilosvay,
in the roles of the girls, Fiordiligi,
atid Dorabella, and Laszlo Csabay
and Igino Zangheri as their lovers,
Ferrando and Gugliemo, made
workmanlike jobs of tin ir stereo
typed parts. Noteworthy in their
characterizations was constant use
of suave and wilty pantomime.
Scenery Apropos
Scenery man.iged to convey some
thing of the quaint charm of the
period and place in which the opera
was set Naples in the 18th cen
tury and the ease and informality
with which it wa> shifted added to
the impression.
Given opera bouffe and a good
cast, the Farm last night actually
found itself enjoying Culture
something for which the Salzburg
I Opera Guild, with its youth, it hu
tnor. and its enthusiasm, may take
I full credit
