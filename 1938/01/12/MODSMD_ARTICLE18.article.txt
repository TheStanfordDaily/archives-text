# Profit Slash Proposed To Stop Cellar 'Gripes'
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Here's The Daily s solution. After having talked with Union directors
on the Cellar problem, the following proposal is set forth as a possible
panacea for the Cellar's ills in this, the third of a series.—The Editor

Three proposals, their advantages
mid disadvantages, by which com
plaints about food in the Union CeJ
lar might be stopped, have been out
lined in the two preceding articles.
One. that the Cellar be subsidized
by other Union units and by the
Union dollar, is considered the most
effective by The Daily from inter
views last week with officials con
cerned.
Simply, The Daily's belief is that
to make food at the Cellar more sat
isfactory in quantity and quality,
more money will have to be spent
there.
Change Neccssarx
For this to be done, however, a
change in the Union's policy of man
agement will have to be okayed by
the Union Board of Governors.
Early next week, the Board will
meet with this change in policy as a
probable subject of discussion.
At present the Cellar is run to
make money. A hangover from the
days when the Union was in debt
for equipment, this policy was not
changed when the debt was paid off
about three years ago. It was de
cided. rather, that the profits be di
vided, 7.) per cent to the Memorial
Hall fund and 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund.
I hat gives the Union two purposes;
to serve satisfactory food in all units,
including the Cellar; and to pay off
part of the theater debt.
Change Profits
The Daily believes that both pur
poses fould be served if the Cellar
were run at cost or a slight loss.
OnK lite Cellar profit need be
changed; no complaints have been
heard about the other units.
It was demonstrated to Dailj men
J that the theater debt could be paid,
; even though the Union dollar be
dropped. Consequently, if it were
kept, the Union as a whole could
show around $8000 less profit and
; still hold up its end of the debt
payment.
This would satisfy one of the
Union's functions, and, if part or all
of the cut in piofit were put into the
Cellar, both purposes would be
Served.
Would Benefit Few
Union officials might consider that
this would be using the Union dol
lar to benefit a small portion of the
students—the Cellar eaters, though
in the first of these articles The
Daily asserted that nothing outside
a rebate system could benefit the
whole student body.
But one official contended that the
Cellar might be suffering an actual
less at the present time, that a profit
could be shown by accounting ad
justment.
That could work both ways. More
money might be spent for Cellar food
and through the same accounting
| adjustment the Cellar could still
break even in the profit and loss
statement.
And the officials could consider

that they were cutting down profit
merely to yive satisfactory service
in all departments, using not the
Union dollar, but the amount of
profit needed for theater and reserve
fund a.s a measure of the cut to be
made.

cerned.
Simply, The Daily's belief is that
to make food at the Cellar more sat
isfactory in quantity and quality,
more money will have to be spent
there.
Change Neccssarx
For this to be done, however, a
change in the Union's policy of man
agement will have to be okayed by
the Union Board of Governors.
Early next week, the Board will
meet with this change in policy as a
probable subject of discussion.
At present the Cellar is run to
make money. A hangover from the
days when the Union was in debt
for equipment, this policy was not
changed when the debt was paid off
about three years ago. It was de
cided. rather, that the profits be di
vided, 7.) per cent to the Memorial
Hall fund and 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund.
I hat gives the Union two purposes;
to serve satisfactory food in all units,
including the Cellar; and to pay off
part of the theater debt.
Change Profits
The Daily believes that both pur
poses fould be served if the Cellar
were run at cost or a slight loss.
OnK lite Cellar profit need be
changed; no complaints have been
heard about the other units.
It was demonstrated to Dailj men
J that the theater debt could be paid,
; even though the Union dollar be
dropped. Consequently, if it were
kept, the Union as a whole could
show around $8000 less profit and
; still hold up its end of the debt
payment.
This would satisfy one of the
Union's functions, and, if part or all
of the cut in piofit were put into the
Cellar, both purposes would be
Served.
Would Benefit Few
Union officials might consider that
this would be using the Union dol
lar to benefit a small portion of the
students—the Cellar eaters, though
in the first of these articles The
Daily asserted that nothing outside
a rebate system could benefit the
whole student body.
But one official contended that the
Cellar might be suffering an actual
less at the present time, that a profit
could be shown by accounting ad
justment.
That could work both ways. More
money might be spent for Cellar food
and through the same accounting
| adjustment the Cellar could still
break even in the profit and loss
statement.
And the officials could consider

that they were cutting down profit
merely to yive satisfactory service
in all departments, using not the
Union dollar, but the amount of
profit needed for theater and reserve
fund a.s a measure of the cut to be
made.
Here's The Daily s solution. After having talked with Union directors
on the Cellar problem, the following proposal is set forth as a possible
panacea for the Cellar's ills in this, the third of a series.—The Editor

Three proposals, their advantages
mid disadvantages, by which com
plaints about food in the Union CeJ
lar might be stopped, have been out
lined in the two preceding articles.
One. that the Cellar be subsidized
by other Union units and by the
Union dollar, is considered the most
effective by The Daily from inter
views last week with officials con
cerned.
