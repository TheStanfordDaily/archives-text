# Profit Slash Proposed To Stop Cellar 'Gripes'
## 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Here's The Daily s solution. After having talked with Union directors
on the Cellar problem, the following proposal is set forth as a possible
panacea for the Cellar's ills in this, the third of a series.—The Editor

Three proposals, their advantages
mid disadvantages, by which com
plaints about food in the Union CeJ
lar might be stopped, have been out
lined in the two preceding articles.
One. that the Cellar be subsidized
by other Union units and by the
Union dollar, is considered the most
effective by The Daily from inter
views last week with officials con
cerned.
Simply, The Daily's belief is that
to make food at the Cellar more sat
isfactory in quantity and quality,
more money will have to be spent
there.
Change Neccssarx
For this to be done, however, a
change in the Union's policy of man
agement will have to be okayed by
the Union Board of Governors.
Early next week, the Board will
meet with this change in policy as a
probable subject of discussion.
At present the Cellar is run to
make money. A hangover from the
days when the Union was in debt
for equipment, this policy was not
changed when the debt was paid off
about three years ago. It was de
cided. rather, that the profits be di
vided, 7.) per cent to the Memorial
Hall fund and 25 per cent to a Union
reserve fund.
I hat gives the Union two purposes;
to serve satisfactory food in all units,
including the Cellar; and to pay off
part of the theater debt.
Change Profits
The Daily believes that both pur
poses fould be served if the Cellar
were run at cost or a slight loss.
OnK lite Cellar profit need be
changed; no complaints have been
heard about the other units.
