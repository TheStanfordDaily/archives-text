# Excom Boosts Sandburg Ante
## Expenses, Psychology Cause Price Raise 
### 
Because everyone knows that "you
never get something for nothing at
Stanford." Ex Committee last night
raised the price for Carl Sandburg's
lecture next month from a suggested
25 cents to 50 cents.
''It's psychological, I guess," said
President Tom Killefer. "If we make
the price too low, people will think
it's no good.''
Because the lecture will cost $300,
the committee — especially Student
Manager Chuck Fontius —felt that
the "two-bit'' fee would not cover
expenses.
Beth Allen, lecture manager, was
not particularly concerned. "It's
your decision. I know we'll pack the
place."
The Palo Alto audience will pay
75 cents for its tickets.
To help Manager Allen arrange the
lecture and work on the student
public - exercises committee, Ex
Committee appointed Esther Berry,
Patsy Henricks, Bill Millis, and Walt
Stessel.
Visitors sometimes use Ex Com
mittee's big room in the Old Union.
President Killefer yesterday got a
request from a junior college jour
nalism society to meet in it next Sat
urday.
"I don't know,' he told the com
mittee. "Last time people used it
they left dirty ash-trays and foot
prints on the table."
"But the journalism department
said last year there were no foot
prints. replied Manager Fontius.
Then someone piped: "They took
off their shoes."
Polo letters were granted Doi
McCausland and Bob Wallace.
