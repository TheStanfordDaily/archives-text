## 
### 
With Mary Beaton leading the all-campus symposium tonight al 7:.'10
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse, the members of the Stanford delega
tions to the Asilomar Conference and National Christian Assembly will
present short talks on subjects pertaining to the general theme of the
two conferences, "What Students Are Thinking on Contemporary Issues."

â–ºThe speeches will cover approxi
mately 50 minutes, at the end of
which time the floor will be open
for questions and discussion.
The purpose of the conclave, ac
cording to Jackie Brown, one of the
delegates to the National Assembly,
is to give interested Stanford stu
dents a chance to hear the most il
luminating ideas on matters of gen
eral concern as brought out by a
majority of the two thousand col
lege students attending the Confer
ences. It is hoped that Farm stu
dents who would like to take ex
ception to some of these views or to
add their own ideas to those ex
pressed will enter the discussion
freely.
The program will include the fol
lowing speakers and subjects: Don
Crawford, "Impressions of the Asil
ornar Conference"; Henry Tani,
"Peace and the Boycott"; Lorren
Crawford, "Labor"; Ellabeth Det
ter, "Religion"; Helen Dake, "Stu
dents and the Educational System";
Jackie Brown, "Impressions of the
National Assembly," and George
Ching, "A Chinese Student's Im
pression of the American Students
at Asilomar."

ium included Gerald Marcus, Jack
Hata, Henry Tani, Ellabeth Detter,
Jackie Brown, and Bob Crawford.
