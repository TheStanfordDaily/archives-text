# Frosh Plays Guardian For Shearer Children
## 
### 
There is a young man living in
Encina who thinks no more of say
ing "Hello" to such celebrities as
Tyrone Power or Frances Dee than
he does of greeting his own grand
mother. This freshman is named
Kenny Cameron and his summer oc
cupation is taking care of Norma
Shearer's two children.
Cameron doesn't have to peek
through keyholes to get information
about the screen folk for he lives
in Miss Shearer's big home in "Santa
Monica and meets and talks to stars
all vacation long.
"Aw, Hollywood stars are just
plain people off the screen," said
Encina's screenland authority when
interviewed. "When Miss Shearer
gives a party it is usually a din
ner followed by a preview of a new
picture in her living room, not a lot
of night-clubbing as most people
imagine." i
It seems' that Miss Shearer's
friends are Kenny's friends. He ran
through a star-studded list of peo
ple he had met that would make
the Milky Way start a search-for
talent contest. 'This list included
Douglas t Fairbanks, Helen Hayes,
Joel McCrea, Frederic March, Mary
Pickford, Producers Zanuck and
Selznick, and many others.
When asked how he got this cov
eted spot, Kenny modestly an
swered, "Well, it all started when
I was a life guard at Lake Arrow
head last summer. Norma Shearer
needed a young man to guard her
children, and by some queer quirk
of fate I became that guardian."
This lucky freshman told how he
got three-year-old Katherine and
seven-year-old Irving, Jr., to like
milk by drinking four quarts of it
himself every day to show them how

good it was.
"All I do is to see that the two
kids brush their teeth, wash their
necks, and drink their mid-morning
orange juice. Then, of course, I see
that they don't get into mischief or
get spoiled by too much of their
own way," smiled Cameron.
Kenny Cameron is viewing his
coming summer vacation with a
grin for again he will guard the
two easy-to-look-after children of a
grand employer, Norma Shearer.
