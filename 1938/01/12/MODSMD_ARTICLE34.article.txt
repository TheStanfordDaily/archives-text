Inasmuch as the athletes always
have a lot of fun on their trips, Bill
Rapp, a member of the varsity bas
ketball squad that recently clat
tered all over the continent, decided
he ought to keep a diary of the trip
as a little remembrance.
His diary, kept in a loose-leaf
notebook and written for the most
part on a jolting train, contains a
few interesting little anecdotes as
well as a dandy new collection of
nicknames for the basketball play
ers.
It seems that one of the highfights
of the junket as recorded by Joe
Eartothoground in his Diary con
corned the exploits of "Pathe News"
Bunn, coach, exhibitionist and
pocket movie camera nut.
A member of a party of the ath
letes that attended "You Can't Take
It with You," Genial John brought
along the little camera with which
he took almost five rolls of film on
the trip.
In the middle of some act or other
the play slipped into a great build
up for the hero and heroine. Things
got deathly quiet, the thespians be
gan to get mushy, and the coach
started his gadget going.
The accompanying whir gave
Bunn the right to tell his grand
children how he stole the show
from two of the best sock-and
buskin artists on Broadway, ac
cording to Joe Eartotheground.

Coach Bunn got another laugh
when he worked out with the squad
at Tulane U. on the way to New
York. An innocent bystander, says
Joe, couldn't figure out which of the
kids was the coach.
Hank Luisetti, affectionately call
ed "Lover Boy" in the Diary, was
slightly perturbed to find the Pi
Phi and Theta houses side by side
on the University of Arizona cam
pus at Tucson, and there was grow
ing tension on the squad until Har
lan "Mike" Copsey got in New York
the letter he had been looking for
since Los Angeles.
Jack Calderwood, variously nam
ed anything from Spook to Calder
lumber, lulled the team to sleep by
aipsing up and down the Pull
mans Christmas Eve joyously sing
ing carols. To quote Joe, "... his
turkey buzzard-like voice drown
ing out the monotonous drone of
Ihe car wheels."

Just a few of the nicknames pick
od up by the lads on the tour were
"Bubbles" Heath, '"Fat Boy" Lee,
"Aire" Dale Huff, "Izzy" Zonne
(who got a hair-net for Christmas
from the boys), "Blimp" Zonne
(that's Bob), "Chubby" LaFaille,
and Doc "Stumpy" Northway.
Doctor Northway met the team in
New York—he was traveling med
ico last season with the squad and
has a little sentimental attachment
1o the fellei's.
Lest wc forget, the Fx-ench din
ners in New Orleans, the nite clubs
in New York (with Calloway and
Lsliam Jones), and the nightly diet
of cornflakes for the players were
never-to-be-forgotten features of
Ihe counter-clockwise sweep from
Palo Alto around the nation.

Inasmuch as the athletes always
have a lot of fun on their trips, Bill
Rapp, a member of the varsity bas
ketball squad that recently clat
tered all over the continent, decided
he ought to keep a diary of the trip
as a little remembrance.
His diary, kept in a loose-leaf
notebook and written for the most
part on a jolting train, contains a
few interesting little anecdotes as
well as a dandy new collection of
nicknames for the basketball play
ers.
It seems that one of the highfights
of the junket as recorded by Joe
Eartothoground in his Diary con
corned the exploits of "Pathe News"
Bunn, coach, exhibitionist and
pocket movie camera nut.
A member of a party of the ath
letes that attended "You Can't Take
It with You," Genial John brought
along the little camera with which
he took almost five rolls of film on
the trip.
In the middle of some act or other
the play slipped into a great build
up for the hero and heroine. Things
got deathly quiet, the thespians be
gan to get mushy, and the coach
started his gadget going.
The accompanying whir gave
Bunn the right to tell his grand
children how he stole the show
from two of the best sock-and
buskin artists on Broadway, ac
cording to Joe Eartotheground.

Coach Bunn got another laugh
when he worked out with the squad
at Tulane U. on the way to New
York. An innocent bystander, says
Joe, couldn't figure out which of the
kids was the coach.
Hank Luisetti, affectionately call
ed "Lover Boy" in the Diary, was
slightly perturbed to find the Pi
Phi and Theta houses side by side
on the University of Arizona cam
pus at Tucson, and there was grow
ing tension on the squad until Har
lan "Mike" Copsey got in New York
the letter he had been looking for
since Los Angeles.
Jack Calderwood, variously nam
ed anything from Spook to Calder
lumber, lulled the team to sleep by
aipsing up and down the Pull
mans Christmas Eve joyously sing
ing carols. To quote Joe, "... his
turkey buzzard-like voice drown
ing out the monotonous drone of
Ihe car wheels."

Just a few of the nicknames pick
od up by the lads on the tour were
"Bubbles" Heath, '"Fat Boy" Lee,
"Aire" Dale Huff, "Izzy" Zonne
(who got a hair-net for Christmas
from the boys), "Blimp" Zonne
(that's Bob), "Chubby" LaFaille,
and Doc "Stumpy" Northway.
Doctor Northway met the team in
New York—he was traveling med
ico last season with the squad and
has a little sentimental attachment
1o the fellei's.
Lest wc forget, the Fx-ench din
ners in New Orleans, the nite clubs
in New York (with Calloway and
Lsliam Jones), and the nightly diet
of cornflakes for the players were
never-to-be-forgotten features of
Ihe counter-clockwise sweep from
Palo Alto around the nation.
