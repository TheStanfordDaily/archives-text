# Troy Seeks Victory For Jump on Cards
## Stanford Varsity Favored; S.C. Looks To Brilliant Soph Squad 
### 
While the.Cardinal cage forcqs go through final tuning up for their
first conference battles this week-end against U.S.C., the Trojans are
pointing for this series as the chance for them to grab an immediate
jump on the favored Stanford varsity.
The advantage of winning one or even both of the first two games in
the annuel fcurgame battle between the schools from their underdog

♦position might give the U.S.C. five
| enough momentum to slide to a
j conference win.
I However, they have an uphill
fight, in the opinion of virtually all
basketball observers. Although
! there are missing from this year's
[ edition of the Trojan varsity the
great Eddie Oram and the likewise
[Jerry Gracin, all-southern division
! players last season, a brilliant soph
| omore squad has moved in and
things look bright for Elevator Sam
| Barry.
Vaughn Shines
Best sophomore seems to be an
Indian lad named Ralph Vaughn,
| who tanked 113 points in the U. C.
L. A. game last week to establish
j himself as a definite contender for
' scoring honors in the loop this year.
, His average so far this year ap
| proaches 15 points per game, noth
: ing to sneeze at indiscriminately.
Four veterans—Hal Dornsife, Cap
tain Hal Remsen, Carl Anderson,
j and Ctemmie Ruh — make up the
I rest of the first team, but none
\ seems to have a cinch on his job.

Anderson, regular center for two
I years, is in imminent danger of
losing out to Dale Sears, a bril-
I liant sophomore, according to ad
vices from the south.
One of the dark horses on the j
I Barry outfit this season is John 1
Morrison, another soph who clicked
I nicely in practice and the first game
j until he broke his foot. Whether
he will be ready this week is ques
j tionable, but unless he suffers an
! other injury he's liable to get in j
Stanford's hair in the second half [
of the series, in Los Angeles.
Veterans Return
Lettermen returning include a j
neat threesome that was not flashy j
but strong last year, Bobbie Dale, i
: John Kewak. and Gail Goodrich, a
j handsome blond.
! While the Trojans are storing up j
a lot of nervous energy for the game, j
J the Indians will be getting rid of. a j
little of theirs in a 10-minute scrim- j
mage after play drills this after- j
; noon. Content that his squad is in j
good enough condition, Coach Bunn j
i plans more of the brain-exercise 1
j type of practice for tomorrow, and J
then the squad will lay off until I
I game time.

In England a billion is a million
million, instead of a 4 thousand mil
lion as in the United States and
France.
