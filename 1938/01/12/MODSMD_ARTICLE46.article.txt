## GENE GEAR, Sports Editor Daily Bowlers' Taunt Taken By Chappies 
### 
After weeks of search for worthy
opposition, The Daily staff's power
ful bawling team finally found an
outfit that dared to meet them on
the alleys when Bob Hartmann, in
behalf of Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, bravely accepted Sports Edi
tor Gene Gear's challenge, in be
half of the Daily team, to a bowl
ing match.
Having accepted the challenge,
the Hammer and Coffin team
claimed the usual prerogative of
naming the time and place, which
will be 1:30 o'clock Saturday, Jan
uary 15, at Thurlow's Bowling
Alleys, Palo Alto.
Hammer and Coffin will start a
four-man team composed of Guy
Combs, Robert Harper, Foster Mar
kolf and Pres Ellington, each one of
whom it i.s claimed has bowled 250
or better this year. However, there
are no records available crediting
them with those marks.
Figures show the Daily varsity
quartet with a top average of 211.
Walt Peterson heads the foursome
with 224, followed by Gordy Frost
215, Gene Gear 208, and Phil Klau
ber 200. Frost may not be able to
start Saturday, but the Daily team
is abundant in reserve strength
headed by Dave Botsford, Art
Stokes, and Harry Press. Press is
the most improved player on the
squad, having raised his season's
record from 98 to 148 recently.
