THE revolutionary corridors of Roble hummed
last night after Salzburg did a Cosi Fan Tutte
and freshman women began their expected de
scendency from the clouds of idealism into the
stark reality that pledge day is nearing, tra la,
tra la.
The women will do the natural thing next
Saturday, unless we miss our guess, and pledge
their respective houses without a hitch. That
they would do otherwise is against all the
rules of human nature.
But the ringleaders of the revolt against the
sorority system are frank about their feelings.
They have decided that it is too great a sacrifice
to refuse to pledge, that they are not that un
selfish, that they wouldn't want to give up the
opportunity to live in a house. We don't blame
them.
Women who have been brought up in fami
lies where mothers and sisters sang the songs
and wore the pin of good old Kappa Kappa
Kappa, have anticipated for years that glorious
day when they, too, would wear the pin and
sing the songs. The day they pledge, and run
up the front steps, and spend their first night in
the house, is going to count. They wouldn't
miss it for anything—not even a rickety sorority
system, or a weeping Roble roomey. At least
now that that day is almost here, they wouldn't
miss it.
But early in the week they became suffi
ciently aroused over the unjust set-up at Stan
ford, over the inability of two-thirds of their

freshman class to belong to any house, that
they considered forfeiting these long-cherished
hopes. That is significant.
In a few days the fuss and flurry will be
over. The pledges will settle back to normal
living. The all-night bullsessions will end. And
the Administration and Pan-Hellenic Council
will decide that the freshman women and The
Stanford Daily have had their little fun for 1937,
that all's well that ends well even if there are a
few broken hearts, and that "thank God it's over
for another year." We can well understand
their feelings.
But we hope it doesn't end here. Each year
the sorority system at Stanford causes con
sternation and alarm. Each year the wedge that
will eventually split the log is driven deeper.
Some day one of the two solutions to the
problem—(l) more sororities, (2) no sororities—
will have to be found. Despite misleading re
ports by news services and misinterpretation
of yesterday's editorial, The Daily has not and
does not attempt to dictate which path should
be followed.
But it does maintain that the situation is more
than an annual attempt by The Daily to stir up
trouble.
The trouble is here. It is being stirred by
those who sense it most—Roble's women.
That their little revolt is but a demonstration
of feeling, hardly a realistic plan of attack, is
admitted, but it should carry sufficient impetus
to warrant disturbing the sanctity of the status
quo.
