THE "famous Stanford open mind," especially
that of The Daily, has been in some question
the last three or four days. Letters in the cam
pus opinion columns have questioned The Daily
for publishing an editorial questioning Dr. Ichi
hashi's recent defense of Japan. In a word, we
have been accused of being pro-Chinese.
Even Bullsessioner Cobbs snapped at the
hand that feeds him with a subtle bit on the
comparative potency of two types of Oriental
propaganda.
To the charge of being especially susceptible
to Chinese propaganda we plead guilty. In de
fense we can only cite the ingenious ruse that
the sons of the good earth have used to get the
United States on their side.
China is letting the war be fought on her own
territory, with Japan in the aggressor role.
Of course China stood on her side of the
fence and like a little girl stuck out her tongue
3t Japan until Japan came after her. And now

she is retreating slowly yelling "Mama" at
every step.
There will be some cost to China in carrying
out the strategem. Cities are being partially
destroyed, and noncombatants killed. Straight
news stories tell the reader whose cities they
are, if he reads no farther than the date line
which tells where the article was written.
But, whatever the consequences, it is a par
ticularly effective trick. Only a people as clever
as the Chinese could think of fighting a war
on their own territory in order to gain world
sympathy.â€”L. L.
