# BULL SESSION
## ROW, ROW, A THOUSAND TIMES NO 
### 
| F the reports which trickle out of the Roble no
man's land can be credited, the freshman women
have worked up a fine revolutionary spirit and are
preparing to march on the row Versailles. Latest re»
ports from the front indicate that the Cause is still
marching on despite the fact that some of its gen
erals, "almost assured of bids," have sold out to the
enemy. Robleites speak with difficulty "between emo
tional stammers, and actual sobs." Whispering groups,
we are told, gather cautiously in the halls like high
school girls with their first pack of cigarettes. The
whole place, it seems, has the air of a reunion banquet
for bolsheviks.
The vague object of this glorious campaign is to
take the evils out of rushing and pledging. "It's—it's
just that so many of our friends are just heartbroken
over it—that we don't think it's all quite fair." The
strategy adopted by the general staff is to refuse all
bids to sororities.

The value of the movement and its probable con
tribution to Ultimate Good is a problem that should
give the philosophy department something to keep
it out of mischief. Certainly the present sorority sys
tem and the rushing set-up are enough to shatter
the soul of any freshman Candide that gets her fin
gers caught, in its machinery. If the Roble putsch
can do something to improve the situation it deserves
direct subsidization from Heaven.
But a fact that the militant damsels seem to forget
is that they create nine-tenths of the agony them
selves. Properly, this is a matter which the women
should recognize and straighten out for themselves.
But the Roble women are striking, the Row women
are worrying, and the hall women are doing a nice
job of watchful waiting. None seem to realize that
most of the heart-break and tragedy that blights the
rejected soul comes because they take themselves too
seriously.

IT is the tense emotion, the everything-depends-on
this attitude that scars the tender spirit. If the
women could draw a map of the world without put
ting the Kappa Kappa Kappa house at the center so
many of their friends would not be "just heart
broken." But instead of decreasing, the gripping
emotion of rushing has soared in recent years to
Greek tragedy heights.
And now, the same spirit has carried over into
the Roble revolt. When freshmen sob over the tele
phone, and whimper softly in the corners, it is safe
to assume that they have not adopted a thoroughly
judicial and impassioned attitude. The- putsch is
marked by the same willful hysteria that character
izes pledging.
This means that the revolution carries with it the
greatest evil of rushing. It means that the freshmen
have clung to the attitude that was responsible for
their misery. It means that the movement will ac
complish something constructive only by the direct
intervention of God. Instead of sensible consideration
we have an hysterical outburst like a child's tantrum
when he lies on the floor and kicks his heels.
Maybe the girls know what they are doing, but as
a bit of friendly advice I would suggest that they
.steer clear <»f abnormal psych professors.
