### 
t'INALLY recognizing that the West Coast does con
tain a large group of excellent swing musicians,
the famous Columbia Swing Session, for the first time
in its history will inaugurate a broadcast originating
entirely from some place other than its New York
studio.
Lengthening their broadcast period from a half
an hour to an hour, the Swing Session will present
such super super super de luxe stars of the music
world as Connie Boswell, Jack Teagarden, Paul White
man, Louis Armstrong, and Bing Crosby. Locally, the
program will be heard from 3:30 to 4:30 next Saturday
afternoon.
Its all very nice to be famous, and I, for one would
just as soon hear Crosby as anyone I know. How
ever, since this program is going to be heard from
Hollywood to New York, I think that the producers of
the program could make a nice gesture by giving the
"name" talent as small a spot as possible, and devote
most of the time to some of the unknowns or those
who aren't quite so famous. It was by this very
method that Bunny Berigan was given a chance to
shine, and it's conceivable that talent equally as good
will be available.
* * * *
ANGELES and Hollywood abound with swing
musicians. But who has ever heard of Jack Briggs,
Jonas Jones, Jimmy Maxwell, Ruel Lynch? But men
tion Lionel Hampton, and everybody knows who he is.
Still it wasn't so very long ago that Hampton was a
member of the same group of names listed above, un
known and unsung except by a few commentators in
Los Angeles. Then Benny Goodman came to town.
It was my fortunate privilege to «be sitting at the
same table with Benny, Gil Evans, two men from Jim
my Dorsey's band early one morning around 3 a.m.
when Benny first heard Hampton play the vibes.
Recognizing Goodman, Hampton asked him to sit in
with the band for a few numbers. Benny did, and it
was then and there that the famed Goodman trio
became a quartet.
Since it took Goodman to give Hampton his chance
for a "name" I see no reason why the CBS can't do
as much for some other as yet unknown musician.
It wouldn't surprise me a bit if such a plan were adopt
ed, some musician or vocalist would, by the sheer bril
liance of his performance, create such a sensation that
the network would be forced to give them a separate
spot. And I don't mean amateurs, just musicians
who know what it's all about.

such super super super de luxe stars of the music
world as Connie Boswell, Jack Teagarden, Paul White
man, Louis Armstrong, and Bing Crosby. Locally, the
program will be heard from 3:30 to 4:30 next Saturday
afternoon.
Its all very nice to be famous, and I, for one would
just as soon hear Crosby as anyone I know. How
ever, since this program is going to be heard from
Hollywood to New York, I think that the producers of
the program could make a nice gesture by giving the
"name" talent as small a spot as possible, and devote
most of the time to some of the unknowns or those
who aren't quite so famous. It was by this very
method that Bunny Berigan was given a chance to
shine, and it's conceivable that talent equally as good
will be available.

ANGELES and Hollywood abound with swing
musicians. But who has ever heard of Jack Briggs,
Jonas Jones, Jimmy Maxwell, Ruel Lynch? But men
tion Lionel Hampton, and everybody knows who he is.
Still it wasn't so very long ago that Hampton was a
member of the same group of names listed above, un
known and unsung except by a few commentators in
Los Angeles. Then Benny Goodman came to town.
It was my fortunate privilege to «be sitting at the
same table with Benny, Gil Evans, two men from Jim
my Dorsey's band early one morning around 3 a.m.
when Benny first heard Hampton play the vibes.
Recognizing Goodman, Hampton asked him to sit in
with the band for a few numbers. Benny did, and it
was then and there that the famed Goodman trio
became a quartet.
Since it took Goodman to give Hampton his chance
for a "name" I see no reason why the CBS can't do
as much for some other as yet unknown musician.
It wouldn't surprise me a bit if such a plan were adopt
ed, some musician or vocalist would, by the sheer bril
liance of his performance, create such a sensation that
the network would be forced to give them a separate
spot. And I don't mean amateurs, just musicians
who know what it's all about.
