# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
In connection with the editorial
in The Daily regarding the trials
and tribulations of Roble, I should
like to make a few observations.
Though this is a result, not a cause
of trouble at Stanford—for the real
reasons are far more fundamental—
it shall be dealt wtih separately due
to lack of space.
To begin with, the trouble is a re
sult of certain acts by the Admin
istration. More than the usual
"500" were admitted without pro
viding more sororities. Neither was
there provision made for the elim
ination of feeling that would nat
urally arise; namely, the abolish
ment of sororities. Some girls al
ways were left out; always will be;
and doubtless always expect to be.
But at the present the proportion is
way out of line.
I can think of three possible rem
edies. First, keep out the greater
number of girls. This would solve
this and many other problems at
Stanford, but it is almost an im
possibility, for the greater number
of girls at Stanford spells $$$ to
the Administration. From this
standpoint alone it seems impos
sible.
Or the sororities might be in
creased in number. This too has
drawbacks. The Administration
seems to be against such a policy
even if it were possible. If state
ments in The Daily are correct, it
is obvious that as far as the Admin
istration is concerned, it would be
quite in favor of letting the sorori
ties go.
Which leads us to the third pos
sible solution, that of abolishing
them entirely. But the alumni cer
tainly would growl if Administra
tion took steps in this direction. The
Row in general would react unfa
vorably, for it would destroy a com
paratively balanced Row-Hall ar
rangement in local affaii's.
Though it would present prob
lems, this latter might be the best
way out under the circumstances,
for the first two appear to be im
possible. Investigation will show
that other schools get along with
out them, anyway.
Whatever the action, it is impera
tive that some course be taken in
the very near future. The situation
as it now exists is inexcusably vic
ious. Forget this year's crop of pos
sible pledges. Whatever the mass
felt, their leaders didn't have the
strength to stand by "alleged" con
victions. I say "alleged," for those
who could have helped the cause
backed down at the first encounter;
none was sincere enough to make
what appeared to be a sacrifice.
Those people are not your leaders,
Roble. They failed you. At best,
J the whole mix-up appears to be the
j bunch of young girls that are finding

out that life is real.
The Administration got us into
this mess; let them, with helpful
criticism, get us out.
The Editor, Sir:
The Daily is to be commended for
bringing to the front the situation
existing in the Cellar. Howevei-, the
interest of the students is not so
much in the profits that the Cellar
and the Union make (that is com
mon knowledge), but in obtaining
something to eat at a reasonable
price without going broke or starv
ing.
There are four items that the Cel
lar may be indicted on. They are:
(a) Quality
(b) Quantity
(c) Choice of menu
(d) Price
The quality of the food served for
luncheons and dinners in the Cellar
does not warrant the price that is
now being asked. By the time that
the food reaches the consumer, it is"
not appetizing nor prime.
The quantity of the portions served
in the Cellar would put a ladies' tea
party to shame. It only serves to
satisfy those of bird-like appetites.
The quantity certainly does not jus
tify the price asked.
The choice of menu is extremely
limited. Actually there is no choice
of a complete luncheon with only
one item listed—the special lunch
eon—and that is not always appe
tizing.
The item of price has already been
mentioned in connection with qual
ity and quantity, but it has been a
source of interest why one can ob
tain a complete, liberal, and appe
tizing luncheon in the Union dining
room for less than in the Cellar.
It is hoped that, The Daily will
carry on a campaign which will re
sult in a complete reform in the
Cellar. It will find strong student
support back of it.
