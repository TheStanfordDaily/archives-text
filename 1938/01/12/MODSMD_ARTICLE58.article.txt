# MOCK HERO EXPOSED

The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the story of the party
who paid his tuition in 115 one-dol
lar bills, I should like at this time
to register my complete disgust.
Rumors have it that a reporter of j
yours, one Mr. Batsforth, was both
perpetrator and raconteur of this in
cident. It was he who wilfully held
up us harassed students waiting to
pay our usual $115. It was he, mock (
hero that he is, who wrote that aw- 1
ful account of HIS OWN foolish
ness.
