# Roble Votes To 'Go Row'; Revolt Fails
## Ballot Blasts Stanford's Sorority System As Frosh Mutiny Ends 
### 
Despite four days of agitation
against sororities, ending in a two
hour meeting yesterday before and
after dinner, freshman rushees voted
to pledge sororities next Saturday.
Because an insufficient number of
women was present at a meeting held
last Tuesday night after the Concert,
when final vote was to have been
taken, the meeting was postponed
until yesterday afternoon.
First Ballot Anti-Row
The first ballot, taken by a show
of hands, revealed that only 28 out
of approximately 110 women wore
definitely going to pledge. However,
as the meeting went on, opinions
seemed to change, and two questions
were finally put to vote.
The women voted overwhelmingly
against the sorority system as it ex
ists here, but at the same time, the
vote to pledge was almost unani
mous. They had agreed not to pledge
if three-fourths of the class so voted,
but the majority voted in opposition
to the move.
Pledging Saturday
A day of silence between Row and
rushees was observed yesterday. In
vitations for preference dinners to
night and tomorrow night were given
out last night after the meeting v/as
concluded. The dinners will be held
from 6 to 8 o'clock and will be for
mal.
Bids will be given out after dinner
Saturday, and pledges will go im
mediately to their respective houses
for pledging. Open houses will be
held by the sororities to inti'oduce
their new members to the campus.
