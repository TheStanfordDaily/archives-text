# Stanford Researchers Lead in Battle on Polio
## 
### 
Stanford leads on in the fight against poliomyelitis.
Aided by funds received from the annual birthday balls held through
out the country in celebration of President Roosevelt's birthday anni
versary, January 30, Stanford is in the forefront of the poliomyelitis
research.
The discovery of the effectiveness of zinc sulphate as a preventive
of the polio infection in monkeys was made last year by Dr. E. W.

Schultz, professor of bacteriology#
and experimental pathology, and
his assistant, Dr. L. P. Gebhardt.
The research was made possible
by grants of money from the Presi
dent's Ball Commission for In
fantile Paralysis Research. The
commission's grant last year to
Stanford was $15,000.
Application Fails
Last June Dr. Schultz announced
that zinc sulphate in solution, ap
plied to the olfactory processes of
monkeys, was ready to be tested on
man. This was done last summer by
Toronto physicians during an epi
demic in Ontario. They found, after
application of the solution to 4713
children, that the suggested method
of application was not satisfactory.
Since then four Stanford Hospital
research men have found a simple |
way to apply the zinc sulphate solu- I
tion so that its effectiveness in cov- [
ering the olfactory area is more defi- j
nitely assured.
Next summer's tests will show |
whether the zinc sulphate, when
applied so as to deprive the child
of his sense of smell, will also make
the nervous system impervious to
the entry of the polio virus, as it |
does in monkeys.
Rapid Development
In less than three years scientists J
have found what promises to be j
the blockade against the virus by j
turning from the theory that serums
vaccines would be the principal
weapons in fighting the disease to
Dr. Schultz' findings on chemical j
pievention through treatment of the 1
olfactory nerves. !
Endorsing whole-heartedly the
Piesident's Birthday Ball plans and
(he National Foundation for Infan
tile Paralysis, Dr. Schultz says, !
"Enough is now known to justify j
some hopes that practical meas
ures for its (polio) control will soon
be available."
