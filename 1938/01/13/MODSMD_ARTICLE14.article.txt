# Murray Stresses Greek Qualities
## 
### 
"The whole of our higher life is
steeped with Greek influence," said
Professor Emeritus Augustus T.
Murray as he opened his talk to the
Luncheon Club yesterday noon.
Two qualities of the Greeks were
outstanding, continued Professor
Murray: their quest for truth, and
their quest for beauty. He spoke of
the intellectual honesty which
characterized the Greek thinker,
and his insatiable spirit of inquiry
which is reflected today.
In discussing the Greek quest for
beauty, Professor Murray pointed
out that the appreciation of beauty
was not a supernatural gift which
only Ihe Greeks possessed, but was
won by them through hard work.
The Greeks recognized the' neces
sity of "learning how" before beauty
could be either appreciated or ex
pressed.
Believing that life was an expres
sion of art, the Greeks pioneered in
the study of ethics, and believed
that one must "learn how" to live,
in order to fully express that art.
In conclusion, Professor Murray
advocated application of Greek ideas
by an "approach to our difficulties
with a dedication to. ideals, with
intellectual honesty, and with a de
sire to make our lives works of
art."
