# Ed Musick Was Pioneer of Air
## Brilliant Career Ended By Clipper Crash 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12 (UP).
—Ed Musick's first plane crashed
when he was a schoolboy and living
in Los Angeles.
His last plane, the four-motored
Samoan Clipper of Pan-American
Airways, crashed into the ocean
south of the equator yesterday, and
the accident wrote an end to one of
aviation's most remarkable careers.
For in between Ed (Edwin C.) Mu
sick, 43, had flown one million miles,
most of them over water, in pioneer
ing the air trails which Pan-Ameri
can Airways follows in service to
faraway places.
After experience in commercial
flying, he joined Pan-American Air
ways in 1927 and worked his way up
to be its No. 1 pilot. He was chosen
to blaze the trail over on the Carib
bean, Then two y6ars ago it was Ed
Musick who took out the first trans-
Pacific plane, made a careful survey
flight.
That task done, he was assigned
to a new trail—that connecting Ho
nolulu and the Antipodes. He made
one round trip flight over that area
last spring, and then he brought up
from Auckland the first load of air
mail from the Australasia area. He
was taking back a load of air ex
press when the Samoan Clipper
crashed yesterday morning on the
last leg of the journey and carried
him and six companions to their
deaths. Musick was married but had
no children.
