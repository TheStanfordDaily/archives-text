# House Scanned For Foreigners
## Group To Submit Ideas To Administrators 
### 
Culminating discussion and in
vestigation of unfavorable living
conditions of the foreign students at
Stanford, the International Com
mittee last night drew up tentative
plans for a campus International
Living Group.
First step in carrying out the plan
will be its presentation to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur and Dean Mary
Yost, both of whom have recognized
the need for such a group on the
campus and have enthusiastically
expressed approval of the establish
ment of such a house.
According to the committee's
plans, the living group will be simi
lar in organization to women's out
side houses already in existence.
25 in House
Taking over a house on the cam
pus. approximately 25 students will
live in the home. Most of the resi
dents will be foreign graduate stu
dents, but perhaps ten of the mem
bers will be American, giving the
foreign men opportunity to partici
pate more fully in American life.
Plans previously advanced by the
administration hinge around the
proposed establishment of a house
for graduate students. In this event,
foreign students, both graduate and
undergraduate, will be given pref
erence in obtaining residence.
Second suggestion for the estab-
I lishnient of an international living
l group would be the opening of a
j home presided over by an American
| couple.
Is Strong Need
The committee pointed out the
j strong need for such a group, since
; foreign students have practically no
opportunity to participate in campus
I life. Most of these live in Palo Alto,
j and come in contact with Stanford
| only through attending classes. Ex
amples were cited of students who,
throughout a school year, meet only
half a dozen students.
"The establishment of such a house
! will do more toward attacking the
i larger problem of international amity
i than any other project," was the
! feeling of the committee.
Sponsors Receptions
The International Committee,
| headed by Mel Jacoby, has sponsored
I informal parties in faculty homes for
: the foreign students throughout the
| past year.
i Reporting on plans for such a re
ception to be held January 30 at
I the home of Professor Theodore
! Kreps, Helen Gilman said that the
I party would be held from 7:30 to
10:30. Games of various sorts will be
played, and an informal spread will
furnish refreshments.
Committee members include Joan
Williamson, Buddy Iwata, Helen
Gilman, Bud Hartzel, Will Lee, Vir
ginia Thompson, Bob Livingston, and
Jim Stone.

Sponsors Receptions
The International Committee,
| headed by Mel Jacoby, has sponsored
I informal parties in faculty homes for
: the foreign students throughout the
| past year.
i Reporting on plans for such a re
ception to be held January 30 at
I the home of Professor Theodore
! Kreps, Helen Gilman said that the
I party would be held from 7:30 to
10:30. Games of various sorts will be
played, and an informal spread will
furnish refreshments.
Committee members include Joan
Williamson, Buddy Iwata, Helen
Gilman, Bud Hartzel, Will Lee, Vir
ginia Thompson, Bob Livingston, and
Jim Stone.
Culminating discussion and in
vestigation of unfavorable living
conditions of the foreign students at
Stanford, the International Com
mittee last night drew up tentative
plans for a campus International
Living Group.
First step in carrying out the plan
will be its presentation to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur and Dean Mary
Yost, both of whom have recognized
the need for such a group on the
campus and have enthusiastically
expressed approval of the establish
ment of such a house.
According to the committee's
plans, the living group will be simi
lar in organization to women's out
side houses already in existence.
25 in House
Taking over a house on the cam
pus. approximately 25 students will
live in the home. Most of the resi
dents will be foreign graduate stu
dents, but perhaps ten of the mem
bers will be American, giving the
foreign men opportunity to partici
pate more fully in American life.
Plans previously advanced by the
administration hinge around the
proposed establishment of a house
for graduate students. In this event,
foreign students, both graduate and
undergraduate, will be given pref
erence in obtaining residence.
Second suggestion for the estab-
I lishnient of an international living
l group would be the opening of a
j home presided over by an American
| couple.
Is Strong Need
The committee pointed out the
j strong need for such a group, since
; foreign students have practically no
opportunity to participate in campus
I life. Most of these live in Palo Alto,
j and come in contact with Stanford
| only through attending classes. Ex
amples were cited of students who,
throughout a school year, meet only
half a dozen students.
"The establishment of such a house
! will do more toward attacking the
i larger problem of international amity
i than any other project," was the
! feeling of the committee.
