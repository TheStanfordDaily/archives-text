# Plans for Subway To Be Discussed
## 
### 
Plans for the proposed University
Avenue railroad underpass and
"clover leaf" highway intersection
at University Avenue and El Ca
mino Real will be discussed soon
at a meeting of representatives from
the State Division of Highways, the
Southern Pacific, Stanford Univer
sity and the City of Palo Alto.
Principal features of the rail sub
way project for which the federal
government has allocated more than
$270,000, include a new railway sta
tion, preferably on the eastern side
of the tracks, and a subway struc
ture with four vehicular lanes.
The "clover leaf" idea proposes to
elevate University Avenue and de
press El Camino Real slightly, the
roadways to be arranged in order
to make congestion at this inter
section impossible.
