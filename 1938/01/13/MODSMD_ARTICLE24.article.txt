# Sokol Says Germany Wants World Peace
## 
### TEMPLETON PECK 
"The German people do not think
of war, do not talk it, do not be
lieve it is coming, and are,entertain
ing no hopes of regaining their 'lost
colonies' by warfare."
This is an impression of German
middle-class opinion brought back
to the Stanford campus by An
thony E. Sokol, assistant professor
of Germanic languages, who return
ed recently from a six months' visit
abroad.
"What the German people really
would like," Professor Sokol says,
"is friendly relations with England."
But concerning such an l lliance, the
Germans say, "We've tried, but we
don't get anywhere."
Talks To Commoners
This interpretation of policy, sur
prising in the face of British de
fense propaganda which plays on
fears of a possible German invasion,
came to Professor Sokol from talks
with rank and file Germans.
Although he did not confer with
Nazi leaders, he came away con
vinced that one of the pillars of
Hitler and German policy is not to
wage war against England, since
England has before, and can again,
cut Germany off from the world.
While he does not sympathize

with Naziism, Professor Sokol be
lieves "there is no doubt that in re
turn for one's surrender of his free
dom of speech and of thought, he
gets certain valuable compensations"
under Naziism. Unemployment has
been virtually abolished, money
circulates rapidly (although prices
are sky high), the shops are full of
patrons, and there is enough to eat.
Construction Booms
Germany, Professor Sokol says, is
enjoying a boom in building, al
though construction is in the main
restricted to homes in the $2500-
$3500 class. Nazi literature is
"pretty good, but nothing exciting."
Nazi art is "not outstanding."
By contrast with Germany, Aus
tria is in a cloud of glom, Profes
sor Sokol reports.
"The government of Austria
wants indepednence," he said, "but
most of the people I met sympathize
with the Nazis and would like to see
a union with Germany."
