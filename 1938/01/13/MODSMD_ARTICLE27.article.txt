# Leaders Laud Student Rule
## Farm Presidents Lead Discussion Over Air 
### 
Stressing the importance of stu
dent government as a means of
teaching the co-operative aspects of
a democratic system, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, president of the Uni
vessity, and Tom Killefer, student
body president, last night gave a
radio discussion of "The Role of
Student Government in Higher
Education Today."
Arthur Northwood, Jr., president
of the National Student Federation,
queried both university leaders as
to their views on conclusions reach
ed at the Thirteenth Annual Con
gress of the federation, held at the
end of last month in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.
Develops Responsibility
"Democracy can succeed only if
the citizen has a sense of responsi
bility. Our student bodies contain
many of our future leaders. If we
can develop in them a clear-cut
sense of responsibility to govern
ment by having an effective student
government, we ean give a consid
erable part of the answer to those
who think that democracies are too
inefficient to succeed in the present
world," said Dr. Wilbur.
Describes Farm Plans
In discussing the operation of
student government, Killefer de
scribed the Honor System, and the
supervisorial task of Ex Committee
as planned at Stanford.
Concluding, Dr. Wilbur declared,
"In dealing with the University in
all of its aspects we must remem
ber that quality is the one essential
thing that it rates above everything
else.
"We can have high quality in stu
dent government if we have re
sponsible participation of a consid
erable percentage of our students in
student government and those fea
tures of government that are
brought together in some places un
der what we call the honor sys
tem."
