# Men, Women Acting Jointly Is Group Aim
## Conference Delegates Advocate Freedom In Group Discussion 
### 
The great value of men and wom
ien students working together as
j people and trying to solve cam
j pus and other problems that con- '
| front them was stressed by dele- â– 
j gates who attended the Asilomar
; and National Christian Conferences
j as they spoke last night at an all
j campus symposium held in the!
| Women's Clubhouse.
The relationships in college be- |
tween men and women, as Jackie |
i Brown expressed it, are confined |
largely to dating and social activi-I
; ties, so' that the opportunity for a j
| freer group discussion between the i
two sexes on fundamental issues j
are overlooked.
Suggests Problems
Such issues as racial prejudice on j
the campus, improving the educa- :
j tional system through better fac- |
j ulty-student understanding, student j
j religion, and the problems concern-I
ied with the innate differences be
tween men and women, she sug
gested.
"At the conference which I at
tended," stated Miss Brown, "there
was a wonderful feeling of fellow
ship, co-operation,, and a real inter
est and unity of views on contem
j porary px*oblems between the joint
Christian organizations."
Proposes Question
The question that Mary Beaton, I
as chairman, put before the group 1
was, "What are we as men and.
women going to do about facing |
these vital questions?"
The possibility of those attending
the meeting to act either as a nuc- j
leus for a joint Christian organiza- !
tion movement, or as a pressure
group to try to bring about a reali- I
zation of this aim, was discussed.
"There is really no place for the
Stanford man in the Christian
movement on the campus," said one
student. "The fellows feel that they
are on the outside, and would like
Ito belong to some such group."
