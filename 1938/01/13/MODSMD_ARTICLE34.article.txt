# Jackson To Speak At Mothers' Club
## 
### 
Dean Hugh Jackson and other
members of the faculty of the
Graduate School of Business will
speak to the Stanford Mothers' Club
at its meeting next Tuesday.
The policy of the club this year has
been to invite a different depart
ment to put on a program at each
meeting, so that the members can
become acquainted with all the di
visions of the University, according
to Mrs. Louis Love, publicity chair
man. *
After the meeting, members of
the club will be the guests of La
gunita Court for tea. The business
meeting will be at 2 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse, preceded by a
no-host luncheon in the Union.

ADELAIDE, Australia, Jan. 12

tennis star, has received "a very in
teresting offer" to turn professional,
he said today. He refused to give
details but added that he intended
to help the United States defend the

must remain an amateur.
