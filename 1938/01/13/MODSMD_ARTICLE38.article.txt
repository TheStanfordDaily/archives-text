ANNOUNCER TOYS WITH
TROY'S INDIANANS
A Bruin's chance to knock the
helmet off El Trojan came last
week-end when Sammy Bolter, an
nouncer for the Pan-Pacific Audi
torium in Los Angeles, took over
the microphone for the U.C.L.A.-
U.SC.. conference basketball clash.
The entire starting line-up for
the Trojans was composed of stars
from a casaba state known as In
diana, while all the starting Bruins
were from southern California.
Bolter, a Westwood grad, saw his
big chance.
He gave the names, numbers, and
home towns of the Uclan boys. All
was fine. Then he came to the
Southern Cal outfit. He mentioned
the towns in an ordinary tone, and
then blasted out, with a sarcastic
note, the word Indiana, for each of
the five Trojan basketeers.
Incidentally, the same Indiana
quintet will, in all probability, take
the floor against LuLsetti and Co.
this week-end. "Elevator" Sam
Barry's five first-stringers are
Ralph Vaughn, high scoring for
ward; Hal Dornsife; Captain Hal
Remsen; Carl Anderson; and Clem
mie Huh, the little bespectacled
chap who has a habit of crying
"wolf."

KMPC, the Station of the Stars,
down in Beverly Hills, has added
Bob Reynolds, Stanford's former
All-American tackle, to its staff.
G. A. Richards offered Bob a
contract to play professional foot
ball for the Detroit Lions, but the
old Stanford "Horse" refused the
bid. Mr. Richards, not satisfied
with the prospect of going away
empty-handed, offered him the
poistion of salesman at KMPC.
Bob, incidentally, is the only per
son who ever played three entire
football games—lBo minutes—in the
Rose Bowl. In three consecutive
New Yeai-'s classics—Columbia ('34),
Alabama ('35), and Southern Meth
odist ('36) — Bob played the com
plete game with no time out.

KMPC, the Station of the Stars,
down in Beverly Hills, has added
Bob Reynolds, Stanford's former
All-American tackle, to its staff.
G. A. Richards offered Bob a
contract to play professional foot
ball for the Detroit Lions, but the
old Stanford "Horse" refused the
bid. Mr. Richards, not satisfied
with the prospect of going away
empty-handed, offered him the
poistion of salesman at KMPC.
Bob, incidentally, is the only per
son who ever played three entire
football games—lBo minutes—in the
Rose Bowl. In three consecutive
New Yeai-'s classics—Columbia ('34),
Alabama ('35), and Southern Meth
odist ('36) — Bob played the com
plete game with no time out.

ANNOUNCER TOYS WITH
TROY'S INDIANANS
A Bruin's chance to knock the
helmet off El Trojan came last
week-end when Sammy Bolter, an
nouncer for the Pan-Pacific Audi
torium in Los Angeles, took over
the microphone for the U.C.L.A.-
U.SC.. conference basketball clash.
The entire starting line-up for
the Trojans was composed of stars
from a casaba state known as In
diana, while all the starting Bruins
were from southern California.
Bolter, a Westwood grad, saw his
big chance.
He gave the names, numbers, and
home towns of the Uclan boys. All
was fine. Then he came to the
Southern Cal outfit. He mentioned
the towns in an ordinary tone, and
then blasted out, with a sarcastic
note, the word Indiana, for each of
the five Trojan basketeers.
Incidentally, the same Indiana
quintet will, in all probability, take
the floor against LuLsetti and Co.
this week-end. "Elevator" Sam
Barry's five first-stringers are
Ralph Vaughn, high scoring for
ward; Hal Dornsife; Captain Hal
Remsen; Carl Anderson; and Clem
mie Huh, the little bespectacled
chap who has a habit of crying
"wolf."
