# Frosh Mermen Train for Meet
## Yearling Stars Shape Up for Varsity Tilt 
### 
One of the best first-place fresh
man swimming teams in years is
gradually shaping into form for the
varsity-frosh meet January 22.
The only apparent weakness with
the squad is the lack of depth in
many events. At that the squad will
undoubtedly develop enough men
for seconds and thirds to present an
exceedingly well balanced unit.
Weeden No Ordinary
Bill Weeden, the gangling back
stroker who windmills up and down
the pool mile after mile and doesn't
even breathe hard, will make himself
heard from in a few weeks. His time
trials have indicated that he is no
ordinary swimmer.
Then there's the winner of the
frosh all-around meet,. Roy Vitou
sek. Vitousek has already narrow
ly missed on assaults at Ted Wiget's
50 and 100-yard frosh records. An
other sprinter, Charles Wiper from
Eugene, Ore., is Pacific Northwest
junior champion in the 440-yard
free-style and also makes knots in
the 220.
Stein Good Diver
Two former frosh water polo
men, Bill Teitzen and Ted Moreno,
take care of the breast stroke. Don
Stein of Chicago is the leading diver
and is said by some to look as good
as Roy Winkleman did as a year
ling.
The two relays will depend upon
the staying power of the above
swimmers. If Weeden and Vitousek
don't get tired, they might swim
both the medley and the free-style
tandem events. Wiper and another
yet undiscovered paddler are tem
porarily in line for the remaining
relay jobs.
