# Vines-Perry Tour Is Real Contest

### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 (UP).â€”
Any lingering doubt about the sin
cerity of purpose with which Ells
worth Vines and Fred Perry regard
their annual professional tennis tour
was dispelled early today when they
battled through three and a half
hours and 69 games before settling
the first contest of the 75 - match
series.
A year ago the two young pro
fessionals split even in their first
barnstorming tour at 37 matches
each, and the experts greeted the
outcome with some skepticism.
