### 
Stanford's frosh cagers will hold
only a light practice session this
afternoon as they round of! their
week's practice in preparation for
the Lowell High tilt tomorrow night
and the Stockton High battle the
following evening.
The team is in excellent shape
for this week-encl's tilts and Coach
Wytze Gorter h?s high hopes that
the yearlings will run their winning
streak to six straight games by tak
ing both the interscholastic lives
into camp,
Bill Niccolls, aggressive substitute,
guard, is back in shape again, com
pletely recovered from a sprained
leg injury. The only other casualty,
Harland Harbke, a guard, was
forced to drop from the team be
cause of a bad knee that kept
troubling him.
Gorter doesn't count on any of
his new players because they have
n't had time, as yet, to work in with
the team, but they should be ready
to go by next week. This includes
Kenny Davidson, forward, and Don
Burness, sharp-shooting guard.
Lowell, who year after year turns
out the best high school quintets in
the Bay Region, pops up with an
other powerful team this season and
the frosh should rule no better than
even money to defeat its younger
opponents.

Shasta Dam, key to the vast Cen
tral Valley reclamation project in
California, will be 560 feet high and
3,100 feet long, backing up waters of
three rivers—the Sacramento, Pit,
and McCloud.
