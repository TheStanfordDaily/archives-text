## Ray of Hope for the 'Full Tuition' Plan 
### 
FOR almost fifty years, as class after class has
sat through long-heralded commencement ex
ercises, traditionally staid seniors have felt
twinges of sentiment at the thought of a last
leave-taking.
But they seldom feel anything else. It is the
exceptional student in an exceptional class that
realizes what Stanford has done for him. "Edu
cations at 60 per cent discount" could be the
world's best sales slogan, but until recent years
the University has done little to popularize it.
Now that some attempt is being made by
Stanford Associates and other groups, it is time
that the undergraduates themselves take a part.
Last week a Daily editorial told about the
"Bryn Mawr Plan" whereby grateful parents
are given ag. opportunity to show their appre
ciation by remitting the full cbst of their chil
dren's education. The mechanics of this scheme
hinge around letters couched in very tactful
terms, which call to the parent's attention the
wide gap which exists between the cost of an
education and the price which students pay
for it.
That this scheme has feasible aspects is
proved by the success it has enjoyed at Bryn
Mawr, where it has been in use for many years.
That it might be practicable at Stanford is evi
denced by enthusiastic reception on the part of
certain student leaders and alumni officers.
Calling attention to the 50 per cent of the
student body which is partly self-supporting
and therefore would be unable to assume a
further financial burden, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
has expressed the opinion that if the letters
were sent only to a selected list of well-to-do
families the plan might succeed.
The nature of this success is naturally a pure

ly relative matter. But, if only 100 of the Uni
versity's 4,000 students paid the full cost of
their education, it would be the same as an
endowment increase of $1,000,000.
Obvious, then, are the benefits to be derived
from even partial success. Not so obvious is
the best way to swing the plan into action. It
could be handled by the administration, by
the alumni, by the A.S.S.U., or by all three in
conjunction. Stanford Associates are already
planning a thorough discussion of the subject
at their Board of Governors' meeting in March,
but this is not enough.
It remains for the students to build up some
sort of mechanism for helping to carry out the
plan. The letters themselves would carry more
power if they came as a direct appeal from the
A.S.S.U. than as formal requests from some
more austere body.
The students also are in a position to do more
by direct contact than the administration could
ever do through the medium of letters. Natu
rally, much must first be done to convince the
Farm's skeptical populace that the idea is wor
thy and not just another dig by a pay-to-the
order-of crazed University.
Some few parents already realize this and
there is a continuous, if almost imperceptible,
flow of account-squaring donations. One man
has given Stanford a gift of $1,000 as each of
his three daughters graduated.
This desire to "pay up" is not freakish. It
does, however, lie dormant under a pile of
doubt and cynicism which has been accumu
lating for almost fifty years.
It remains for the Administration, students,
and alumni to assume the task of uncovering it.

families the plan might succeed.
The nature of this success is naturally a pure

ly relative matter. But, if only 100 of the Uni
versity's 4,000 students paid the full cost of
their education, it would be the same as an
endowment increase of $1,000,000.
Obvious, then, are the benefits to be derived
from even partial success. Not so obvious is
the best way to swing the plan into action. It
could be handled by the administration, by
the alumni, by the A.S.S.U., or by all three in
conjunction. Stanford Associates are already
planning a thorough discussion of the subject
at their Board of Governors' meeting in March,
but this is not enough.
It remains for the students to build up some
sort of mechanism for helping to carry out the
plan. The letters themselves would carry more
power if they came as a direct appeal from the
A.S.S.U. than as formal requests from some
more austere body.
The students also are in a position to do more
by direct contact than the administration could
ever do through the medium of letters. Natu
rally, much must first be done to convince the
Farm's skeptical populace that the idea is wor
thy and not just another dig by a pay-to-the
order-of crazed University.
Some few parents already realize this and
there is a continuous, if almost imperceptible,
flow of account-squaring donations. One man
has given Stanford a gift of $1,000 as each of
his three daughters graduated.
This desire to "pay up" is not freakish. It
does, however, lie dormant under a pile of
doubt and cynicism which has been accumu
lating for almost fifty years.
It remains for the Administration, students,
and alumni to assume the task of uncovering it.

FOR almost fifty years, as class after class has
sat through long-heralded commencement ex
ercises, traditionally staid seniors have felt
twinges of sentiment at the thought of a last
leave-taking.
But they seldom feel anything else. It is the
exceptional student in an exceptional class that
realizes what Stanford has done for him. "Edu
cations at 60 per cent discount" could be the
world's best sales slogan, but until recent years
the University has done little to popularize it.
Now that some attempt is being made by
Stanford Associates and other groups, it is time
that the undergraduates themselves take a part.
Last week a Daily editorial told about the
"Bryn Mawr Plan" whereby grateful parents
are given ag. opportunity to show their appre
ciation by remitting the full cbst of their chil
dren's education. The mechanics of this scheme
hinge around letters couched in very tactful
terms, which call to the parent's attention the
wide gap which exists between the cost of an
education and the price which students pay
for it.
That this scheme has feasible aspects is
proved by the success it has enjoyed at Bryn
Mawr, where it has been in use for many years.
That it might be practicable at Stanford is evi
denced by enthusiastic reception on the part of
certain student leaders and alumni officers.
Calling attention to the 50 per cent of the
student body which is partly self-supporting
and therefore would be unable to assume a
further financial burden, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
has expressed the opinion that if the letters
were sent only to a selected list of well-to-do
families the plan might succeed.
