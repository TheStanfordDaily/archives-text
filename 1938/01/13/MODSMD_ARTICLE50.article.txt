THOUGH it covers no points that have not
been made in these columns in the last two
days, the editorial below is reprinted as an ex
ample of off-campus comment on Roble's revolt.
Fairer than most, it comes from the San Fran
cisco News.

When college girls who are being rushed by
the sororities organize a protest against the
system that leaves half of their classmates out
in the cold, they deserve a cheer and something
more substantial in the way of support from
the college authorities.
That is what has happened at Stanford Uni
versity, where only 118 first year students out
of a class of 265 gills may belong to sororities,
which are limited to nine in number. The revolt
has broken out, not among the excluded, but
among the 118 eligibles, one of whom says,
"So many of our friends are heartbroken over
not receiving sorority bids that we don't think
it's all guite fair. We think something is wrong
with the system."

A good many people, including fraternity and
sorority members, have been thinking that for
a good many years. Young people are snob
bish enough without being encouraged, and
college is no place for recognizing class dis
tinctions. They segregate students in groups,
and deprive them of the variety of contacts that
should be one of the greatest benefits of college
life. Money and social position inevitably in
fluence the choice of new members, and the
prestige of the Greek letter societies then op
erates to establish college values that are just
the opposite of what they should be. It is a
system that has much to do with the discredit
ing not only of scholarship but of any genuine
interest in cultural values.
Stanford began with democracy as its key
note, and it is good to see the spirit of democracy
still at work there.
