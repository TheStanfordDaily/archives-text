CIIALK ONE UP FOR THE COMMISSAR
• [EVIDENCE of coming revolution and of subtle bor
ings at the heart of our civilization crops up occa
sionally to mar the beauty of our leisurely flirtation
with the goddess of knowledge. In most cases the
events are, on the surface, innocent enough, but we
who are trained by Hearst in the technique of follow
ing the red trail can see through their superficial re
spectably.
During the past quarter our Mosco\fr representa
tives confined themselves to various minor projects
which did not threaten the government with instant
dissolution. There was for instance the dormant vol
cano in front of the Union which gassed all innocent
bystanders and caused students with a D average to
ricochet of! the vests of passing professors. And
there were the shell holes at the intersection of the
♦sidewalk and the Phi Delt drive, obviously designed
to incapacitate Row men and thus cut down the
anti-revolutionary forces.

But these worms in the Stanford apple were insig
nificant. They were not nearly as irritating as some
legal forms of highway robbery like the sales tax and
syllabus fees. Recently the soviet agents have started
a boring project that threatens to blast our culture
to fragments and svyeep it down the sewer. The com
munists have started tampering with the lighting
system.
For the past week the circuit thai lights the Halls,
Encina, the Library and the Post Office has been
under the control of revolutionists. When the lights
go out, the authorities call it an act of God and send
a man out to play with the wiring. And I suppose
that the poor, blind sheep are sincere when they say
it. But we who can smell a communist up wind with a
chem major in between know better. It is quite ob
vious that the forces of chaos are using the lights to
spread their doctrine through Stanford.

r pilE scheme is simple. If the lights go out at stra
tegic times, such as during dinner, study hours,
shaving time, the seeds of a discontent will be sown
in the student soul, seeds that are more fruitful than
those that were watered by blood in the Bastile. The
student who has dug divots in his face because the
lights vanished just as he finished lathering will be
as pliable in radical hands as a "free-thinking" fra
ternity man who gets a pep talk from the house
president.
When we flunk exams because we can't read' by
moonlight, capitalism begins to totter. And when we
burn our fingers, ruin our cigarette lighter, and scorch
our letters trying to get into the post office box, we
are ready for something nice in the way of blood in
the gutter and heads on the block.
Obviously, it's all the work of the Communists.
And if it happens again, we are likely to get a sub
poena from Sail Simeon.
