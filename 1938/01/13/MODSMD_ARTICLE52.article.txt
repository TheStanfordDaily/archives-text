"SIX DAYS SIIALT THOU LABOR ..."
UVERY Sunday the capitalists who take the bread
from our mouths the rest of the week sponsor a
flock of tremendous radio programs. Maybe it's all
part of a plot to keep the masses at bay, but anyway
you can't beat the line-up they dish out every seventh
day.
Don't get up before 9:30 unless you have to hash,
01' you'll be stuck with a brat called Bobby Rockwell
reading the funnies to the illiterates of America. But
immediately afterwards Erno Rapee directs the Radio
City Symphony Orchestra on KGO in an hour of fine
classical music with an occasional soloist thrown in.
Be sure to swing your dial to KSFO at noon to
hear the New York Philharmonic, probably the best
all-around symphonic program on the air. Deems
Taylor's intermission comments sparkle with dry wit
and information you won't find any place else. This
will keep you going until almost 2 o'clock.
Next you can choose between Metropolitan Opera
auditions and Marion Tallcy chortling about how she
got her shape in shape. KPO brings the new Mickey
Mouse Theater at 2:30 o'clock for those addicted to
whimsey and short subjects. At 3 try Thirty Minutes
in Hollywood with George Jessel (if you must), at
3:30 Senator Fishface and Professor Figgsbottle (if
you can stand them), and at 4 o'clock Jeanette McDon
ald's Open House.
1(1 * »|: *
OZZIE NELSON and Harriet Hilliard fill the next
hour on KGO with smooth tunes and Hollywood
guest stars. At 5 Charlie McCarthy, the phenomenal
fire-hazard, drags his stooge Bergen into the spot
light. He is always surrounded by an ace cast includ
ing Nelson Eddy, Don Ameche, Dorothy Lamour, and
the Stroud twins.
Bo sure to hurry to KSFO at 6 oi* you'll find
yourself breaking down with the Manhattan Merry-
Go-Round, the biggest stinkeroo on the air. Invariably
starred is Rachel Carlay of the Folies Bergeres and
Blanco's Mountain View, and the music all sounds
like Mademoiselle from Armentieres played on beer
bottles.
Of course Jack Benny and company take the air
at 8:30 (as if you didn't know). Tales of California
isn't too bad at 9. While New York sleeps we must
be content with the usual run of coast bands for the
rest of the evening.

from our mouths the rest of the week sponsor a
flock of tremendous radio programs. Maybe it's all
part of a plot to keep the masses at bay, but anyway
you can't beat the line-up they dish out every seventh
day.
Don't get up before 9:30 unless you have to hash,
01' you'll be stuck with a brat called Bobby Rockwell
reading the funnies to the illiterates of America. But
immediately afterwards Erno Rapee directs the Radio
City Symphony Orchestra on KGO in an hour of fine
classical music with an occasional soloist thrown in.
Be sure to swing your dial to KSFO at noon to
hear the New York Philharmonic, probably the best
all-around symphonic program on the air. Deems
Taylor's intermission comments sparkle with dry wit
and information you won't find any place else. This
will keep you going until almost 2 o'clock.
Next you can choose between Metropolitan Opera
auditions and Marion Tallcy chortling about how she
got her shape in shape. KPO brings the new Mickey
Mouse Theater at 2:30 o'clock for those addicted to
whimsey and short subjects. At 3 try Thirty Minutes
in Hollywood with George Jessel (if you must), at
3:30 Senator Fishface and Professor Figgsbottle (if
you can stand them), and at 4 o'clock Jeanette McDon
ald's Open House.
1(1 * »|: *
OZZIE NELSON and Harriet Hilliard fill the next
hour on KGO with smooth tunes and Hollywood
guest stars. At 5 Charlie McCarthy, the phenomenal
fire-hazard, drags his stooge Bergen into the spot
light. He is always surrounded by an ace cast includ
ing Nelson Eddy, Don Ameche, Dorothy Lamour, and
the Stroud twins.
Bo sure to hurry to KSFO at 6 oi* you'll find
yourself breaking down with the Manhattan Merry-
Go-Round, the biggest stinkeroo on the air. Invariably
starred is Rachel Carlay of the Folies Bergeres and
Blanco's Mountain View, and the music all sounds
like Mademoiselle from Armentieres played on beer
bottles.
Of course Jack Benny and company take the air
at 8:30 (as if you didn't know). Tales of California
isn't too bad at 9. While New York sleeps we must
be content with the usual run of coast bands for the
rest of the evening.
