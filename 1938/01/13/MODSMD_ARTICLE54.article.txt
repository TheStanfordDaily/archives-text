## INTERNATIONALIST SAYS: 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A grand idea the International
Committee of the A.S.S.U. struck.
For many years Stanford has been
in need of a house for foreign stu
dents in order for them to get ac
quainted with the American stu
dents. And I personally believe the
essence of the house is not only to
find accommodations for the foreign
students but for the American stu
dents to live with them.
It may take a lot of work for the
International Committee, but with
(he support of the administration,
already endorsed by President Wil
bur, the students should push for it.
Let's hope they carry it out!
