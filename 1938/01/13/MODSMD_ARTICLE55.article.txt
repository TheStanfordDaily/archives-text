# LET THERE BE LIGHT

An Open Letter to Stanford
Electric Supply Corporation
Gentlemen: (If you may be termed
such)
May I inquire into the state of
your health? I hope that you are !
well; The Lord only knows that the '
inhabitants of Encina Hall and the t
other men's dormitories on this i
campus are in a state of mental and
physical maladjustment, thanks to
you and your haphazard methods of
light supply.
Almost every evening in the year,
when with an Ex staring you in the j
face, you nervously grab up your
books and start to pound the knowl- i
edge for a 10-yard loss, out go your
glims. Immediately following the ,
cessation of light there descends j
upon Encinasylum such bedlam as
Prince Prospero and his gay con
federates never knew when the Red :
Death descended upon them. The ,
desolation and destruction described
by the able Poe could describe the j
conditions when your lights do come
on. And after sitting around in the !
dark for several hours, there is none
of that usual (?) desire to study.
May I suggest that possibly it
would take a bit of money or spe
cial workers to do this very slight >
job, that the boys here in the hall
would be only too delighted to con- j
tribute to a fund and put some of j
the nation's vast army of unem- |
ployed to work.
This is not just a flight into the !
impossible by an impractical and
dope-ridden fiend dabbling with the
muse, but by a fairly rational stu- ,
dent, who in the throes of agony 1
and frustration appeals to your bet
ter nature and desire, not only to
take our money in the form of bills,
but also to deliver a semblance of
service.
De LIGHT edly yours,
Pat Graham
