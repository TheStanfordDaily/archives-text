# MORE SORORITIES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Two years ago, Quad suggested
the solution for present sorority
evils in the following paragraph:
"One factor which exaggerates the
difficulty of housing the women is
the Hall-Row proportion. Among
the men, the Hall-Row split is about
50-50: half go Row; half go Hall.
But because there are only nine
sororities to 1000 women, this nat
ural ratio is artificially distorted to
the point where somewhat less than
one-third of the women can go Row.
Remembering the days when Stan
ford had ten sororities, Quad hum
bly suggests that perhaps one or two
more Greek houses might solve
some pressing problems."
Because the sorority system is not
inherently evil, because it is finan
cially and morally in a healthy sit
uation at Stanford, because it gives
the women pleasure, and, lastly and
most importantly, because it is es
tablished as a going concern with
all the advantages of "social mo
mentum," I will stick by what I
wrote in the 1936 Quad and again
suggest, no longer humbly, more
sororities (we had 'em once) to
raise the Hall-Row split to natural
(50-50) proportions.
