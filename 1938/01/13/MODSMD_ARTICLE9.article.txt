# Air Tragedy Discovered; Seven Dead
## Samoan Clipper Burns; Wreckage Sinks As Crew Die in Flames 
### 
PAGO PAGO, American Samoa,
Jan. 12 (UP). —Scattered fragments
of an airplane found floating on the
oil-smeared surface of the ocean 14
miles from here tonight marked the
place where the giant Pan-Ameri
can flying boat Samoan Clipper
crashed into the sea yesterday, car
rying Captain Edwin C. Musick,
pioneer trans-Pacific flier, and his
crew of six to their deaths.
Naval officials aboard the mine
sweeper Avocet, which reported
finding the bits of wreckage north
west of the coast of this South Pa
cific Island, said they had been
positively identified as those of the
big clipper plane, lost since early
yesterday when it reported motor
trouble 75 miles out of Pago Pago.
All Dead
Navy and Pan-American officials
said there was no question that all
seven aboard the plane lost their
lives when it plunged into the
ocean, less than six minutes flying
time from its base here.
Musick, veteran of a quarter of a
century of flying and the man who
blazed Pan-American air trails over
three oceans—the Pacific and North
and South Atlantic — was in com
mand of the 19-ton flying boat pio
neering a new route from Honolulu
to New Zealand.
It was believed *the plane, which
reported it was dumping gasoline as
it raced back to Pago Pago harbor
with smoke pouring from the cowl
ing of one motor, had exploded in
mid-air or crashed into the sea and
burned.
22-hour Silence
Musick's last report was at 8:27
a.m. Tuesday (3:27 p.m., EST). At
that time he signed off preparatory
to circling to make a landing at Pago
Pago Harbor.
After that there was a 22-hour
silence, until the Avocet picked up
a trail of oil slick, as it criss
crossed over the rolling blue Pa
cific, and followed the oil to the
wreckage.
A launch from the Avocet picked
up parts of the wreckage which the
Navy reported "was identified satis
factorily as of the clipper."
Aboard the plane with Musick
were Captain C. G. Sellers, first of
ficer; P. S. Brunk, junior flight offi
cer; F. J. McLean, navigator; J. W.
Stickrod, first engineering officer;
J. A. Brooks, assistant engineering
officer, and T. J. Findley, radio op
erator.
First Clipper Disaster
The crash of the Samoan Clipper
was the first major disaster in over
water flying by Pan-American's
fleet of clipper planes. The airline
has never had a fatal crash of a
plane carrying passengers on over
water routes.
The big clipper, which last month
pioneered the route northeastward
from Auckland to Honolulu, took off
from the Samoan base at 5:30 a.m.,
Samoan time, Tuesday, on the last
leg of the flight.
Aboard the plane was air express
from Honolulu but no mail, since
the route had not yet been approved
by the United States postal depart
ment.
The first indication of trouble
came 38 minutes after the plane
left Pago Pago for Auckland. Mu
sick radioed an engine had devel
oped an oil leak and he was re
turning to the take-off point. When
the flying boat failed to reach the
base, the Navy set out in search
of it.
Had Four Motors
Shortly after 6:30 a.m. Samoa'n
time, the Avocet picked up a trace
of the oil smear and followed it to
the wreckage, 14 miles northwest of
Pago Pago.
The clipper plane had four 800-
horsepower motors mounted on the
single wing structure, and could
have easily proceeded to port with
one of these disabled. It also could
have landed without difficulty in
the ocean, had it been under con
trol, and taken off again with only
three motors operating.
The fact that the plane's radio did
not function led to first apprehen
sion that it had either exploded or
sunk. There were two two-way ra
dio sets aboard, with an accessory
"antenna kite" which could be sent
up from the ocean to enable the
plane to send over any "radio pock
et" created by the tall hills of Tu
tuila, which rose about 1500 feet
above the sea.
