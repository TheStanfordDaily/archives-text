# Card Hoopmen Meet Troy In Game Tonight
## 
### WALT PETERSON 
About twenty minutes before
game time tonight, if you stepped
into that Cardinal dressing room in
Eneina Gym as the basketballers
were preparing for the first confer
ence game of the season, against
U.S.C., you would probably see a
nervous captain pacing up and
down.
No fbolin', Hank Luisetti is a
bundle of jitters before every game
—last year he did a lot of traips
ing around in the dressing room,
and this year he's captain and real
ly has something to worry about.
It's the last year for Hank, and
for Art Stoefen, Jack Calderwood,
Beebs Lee, Bob Zonne, and Nellie
Heath, and they start their last con
ference drive tonight against the
toughest team they will have to
meet in conference play, if practice
season indications follow through.
It's Last Season
It's the last season for the
greatest team that has hit coast
basketball —yea, even national bas
ketball—in years, and that team
steps tonight into the part of the
season that really counts, the con
ference. Two wins this weekend
and the squad is off to a flying
start, two losses and the Trojans
are in an enviable position to upset
the mighty Indians.
No wonder Luisetti, captain iti
coparable, is nervous tonight.
As the two starting teani> si ft
out from the welter of their mates
warming up and begin to doff their

warm-up clothes, you'll probably
see these men in silks:
For Stanford, CaptaHn Luisetti
and Phil Zonne at forwards, Jack
Calderwood and H. B. Lee at
guards, and Art Stocfey at center.
Line-up Told
For U.S.C., Captain Hal Rctnson
and Hal Dornsife, guards; Ralph
Vaughn and Clem Rub, forwards,
and Carl Anderson, center.
The Cardinal team features four
seniors and a junior, Phil Zonne.
Of the seniors, Li«isctti, Stoefeti
and Calderwood have played side
by side without a miss into this,
their third varsity season. Every
game of importance has found them
starting.
Lee, a freshman team member
with Luisetti, couldn't displace reg
ularly the great Dinty Moore for
two years at guard, but this year
eives him his chance. The smooth
kid can show steadily now the
great form of which fans have had
glimpses in the last two seasons,
particularly in the California series.
