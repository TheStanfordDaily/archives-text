# Frosh Cagers To Tangle With Lowell
## 
### 
Stanford's fast-improving fresh
man cage squad tangles with Low
ell High School of San Franciso in
tonight's preliminary game to the
Varsity-U.S.C. game. The tip-off
will be at seven o'clock.
Coach Wytze Gorter has been
working on his reserves the past
week and consequently the frosh
will not have to depend so much on
its first ftive players as it has in the
past. However, the same team that
has started every frosh game to
date will be in at the opening whis
tle.
Dick Taylor will hold down the
center berth and is primed to turn
on the heat tonight. Bill Rumbley,
who has flashed improved form in
recent practice sessions, will be
ready to spell Taylor.
Forwards Named
Bill Masters and Don Williams
are due to open at the forwards and
present an accurate shooting, hard
driving combine. Mike Marshall,
who has already proven his mettle,
will be ready to enter the game at
any time.
At the guards, Eddie DeMoss and
Bob Stone will hold forth. Both
have been playing heads-up ball and
DeMoss is a splendid shot in the
bargain.
Ready to substitute at the defense
posts are John Alltucker, who turn*
ed in a good game against Wash
ington last week; Don Burness, and
Bill Niccolls, who is back in shape
again.
Lowell Agressive
Lowell presents an agressive
team that is definitely pointing for
Stanford. Coach Bunny Neff's
team is one of the leading high
school squads in the Bay Region
and he is confident of a victory
over the Papooses.
Tomorrow evening the yearlings
will tangle with Stockton High, in
a preliminary to the second U.S.C.
tilt.
