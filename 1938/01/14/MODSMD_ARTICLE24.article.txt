# Clubs Made Safe For Hashers
## 
### 
Eating clubs no longer awake
some morning to find their hashers
have joined fraternitiesâ€”organiza
tion last year of the Interclub
Council was designed to stop that.
"Losing a hasher was even worse
than losing another member," de
clared Harry Cragin, president of
the council, yesterday. "The worst
of it was we couldn't tell who was
rushing our members."
Most important work of the coun
cil has been enforcement of the
"30-day" rule, which provides that
a house must notify a club presi
dent 30 days in advance if he plans
to rush one of that club's mem
bers.
"The system hasn't really had a
chance to work yet," said Cragin.
"The clubs have lost some men to
fraternities, but we have made no
appeals yet to Intrafraternity Coun
cil. By the end of the year, after
there have been some hearings, we
should be able to tell how well this
gentlemen's agreement is function
ing."
Don Moulton, chairman of Inter-

fraternity Council was optimistic
about future house-club relations.
