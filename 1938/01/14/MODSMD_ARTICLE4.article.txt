# Sororities Will Get Classes Despite Roble Rebellion Against Rush System
## 
### 
Roble's once rebellious rushees
will be pledged to nine sororities
tomorrow night, climaxing a para
doxical week of rushing and revolt
against the Row.
Final preference dinners, which
are formal, are being held tonight
from 6 to 8 o'clock. Bids will be
given out after dinner tomorrow,
and pledges will then be called for
and taken to their respective
houses. Following tradition, open
houses will be held all along the
Row to give the men a chance to
look over the new classes.
Pledging will climax the evening,
following which pledges will sleep
at their houses. Quota of pledges
for all houses has been set at 117.
And thus will end a hectic, week
for Roble and Row, in which the
freshman woman almost upset the
Greek applecart. First sign** of the
revolt, which was climaxed by a
final meeting Wednesday, appeared
late Sunday when news of a bull
session on the ups and downs of
rushing spread quicklv through the
hall.
Meetings held throughout the
week showed many rushees opposed
to pledging, because of what they
believed are inherent faults in Stan
ford's sorority set-up.
Feeling seemed to taper off by
Wednesday, and resulted in a maj
ority vote by the rushees to pledge.
At the same time, however, rushees
went on record as saying that they
were still against the sorority sys
tem in its Stanford form.
