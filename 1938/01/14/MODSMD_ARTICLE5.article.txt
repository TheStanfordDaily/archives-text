# Open Doors Await Unpledged Frosh In Toyon, Branner
## 
### 
Half of the Encina has gone up
the Row, but freshmen left behind
by choice or circumstance have no
reason to weep about it. Toyon
and Branner will open their doors
to them next September.
Here at Stanford, where the cam
pus is so evenly divided the non
fraternity men are every bit the
equals of their Row classmates.
While men at other colleges may
be left out of campus affairs, here
activities arc equally dviided.
No Social Differences
Nor is there any social difference
between Row and Hall. Eating
Clubs and dormitories hold more
and 'larger dances each quarter, per
living group than do the frater
nities.
Tlie Hall, by reputation, is the
home of individuals, a place where
there is a broader opportunity for
making friends. While it tis not
wholly true here, that the Houses
arc clannish groups, it is even less
true in the Halls.
Men in Toyon, Branner, and Seq
uoia have the added opportunity of
knowing all the men in their hall.
Contrary to the popular notion,
the Hall-Row split does not come
between friendships and acquaint
ances. Row men frequently come
down to the Halls and vice-versa.
Living conditions in Toyon and
Braner are superior to those in the
Houses, in that they offer more pri
vacy, less crowded conditions, and
better studying facilities. There are
only two men to a sleeping room,
and two to a study in the Halls, a
condition that most houses cannot
attempt to equal.
Study, Recreation
In addition, there are recreation
and study rooms on each corridor,
where students may go when they
are bothering their roommates, or
wiish privacy flor thei,r 'thoughts
and typewriters.
Then too, from a materialistic
point of view, a man entering a
hall is not running a risk of sad
dling himself with a part of his
fraternity's debt for rebuilding. The
Halls are University property.
Eating Clubs
And in the Hall-Row question
comes the inevitable question of an
Eating Club. Every frosh has had
an opportunity to see an eating
club this year, and he has seen the
advantages of the system.
Already, several members of the
class of '41 have joined the clubs,
and there will be more before the
end of the year. In these, the hall
men find a great many of the ad
vantages, and few of the disadvan
tages of Fraternity life.
A great many students enter the
Halls rather than fraternities in or
der to do more studying, and it is
probably a great deal easier for a
great many people. Additional pri
vacy found off the Row is frequent
ly a help.
The Morris chair was named
after William Morris, English poet,
though he did not invent it.

condition that most houses cannot
attempt to equal.
Study, Recreation
In addition, there are recreation
and study rooms on each corridor,
where students may go when they
are bothering their roommates, or
wiish privacy flor thei,r 'thoughts
and typewriters.
Then too, from a materialistic
point of view, a man entering a
hall is not running a risk of sad
dling himself with a part of his
fraternity's debt for rebuilding. The
Halls are University property.
Eating Clubs
And in the Hall-Row question
comes the inevitable question of an
Eating Club. Every frosh has had
an opportunity to see an eating
club this year, and he has seen the
advantages of the system.
Already, several members of the
class of '41 have joined the clubs,
and there will be more before the
end of the year. In these, the hall
men find a great many of the ad
vantages, and few of the disadvan
tages of Fraternity life.
A great many students enter the
Halls rather than fraternities in or
der to do more studying, and it is
probably a great deal easier for a
great many people. Additional pri
vacy found off the Row is frequent
ly a help.
The Morris chair was named
after William Morris, English poet,
though he did not invent it.
Half of the Encina has gone up
the Row, but freshmen left behind
by choice or circumstance have no
reason to weep about it. Toyon
and Branner will open their doors
to them next September.
Here at Stanford, where the cam
pus is so evenly divided the non
fraternity men are every bit the
equals of their Row classmates.
While men at other colleges may
be left out of campus affairs, here
activities arc equally dviided.
No Social Differences
Nor is there any social difference
between Row and Hall. Eating
Clubs and dormitories hold more
and 'larger dances each quarter, per
living group than do the frater
nities.
Tlie Hall, by reputation, is the
home of individuals, a place where
there is a broader opportunity for
making friends. While it tis not
wholly true here, that the Houses
arc clannish groups, it is even less
true in the Halls.
Men in Toyon, Branner, and Seq
uoia have the added opportunity of
knowing all the men in their hall.
Contrary to the popular notion,
the Hall-Row split does not come
between friendships and acquaint
ances. Row men frequently come
down to the Halls and vice-versa.
Living conditions in Toyon and
Braner are superior to those in the
Houses, in that they offer more pri
vacy, less crowded conditions, and
better studying facilities. There are
only two men to a sleeping room,
and two to a study in the Halls, a
condition that most houses cannot
attempt to equal.
