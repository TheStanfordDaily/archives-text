# Open Doors Await Unpledged Frosh In Toyon, Branner
## 
### 
Half of the Encina has gone up
the Row, but freshmen left behind
by choice or circumstance have no
reason to weep about it. Toyon
and Branner will open their doors
to them next September.
Here at Stanford, where the cam
pus is so evenly divided the non
fraternity men are every bit the
equals of their Row classmates.
While men at other colleges may
be left out of campus affairs, here
activities arc equally dviided.
No Social Differences
Nor is there any social difference
between Row and Hall. Eating
Clubs and dormitories hold more
and 'larger dances each quarter, per
living group than do the frater
nities.
Tlie Hall, by reputation, is the
home of individuals, a place where
there is a broader opportunity for
making friends. While it tis not
wholly true here, that the Houses
arc clannish groups, it is even less
true in the Halls.
