# Fraternities Pledge 256
## Dekes, Chi Psis, Delts Tie, Pledge 15 Each 
### 
Dekes, Delts and Ghi Psi's were tied for first place with
15 new members as Stanford's annual "pledge race" came to
a close late this afternoon. In second place were S.A.E. and
Delta Chi, each with 14 members.
A total of 256 members of the Class of 1941 received formal
pledging cards from Warren M. Turner, Interfraternity Aud
itor, at the Encina sponsor's room this afternoon. This repre
sents a considerable decline from last year's figure, when 307
freshmen went "up the Row".

â–º It's all over but the shouting.
But there is plenty of that being
done, as Freshmen invaded the Row
this afternoon after pledging before
the Interfraternity Council's attor
ney in the sponsor's room of En
cina Hall.
Bells, whistles, automobile horns,
and fireworks welcomed the new
pledges. Trees along the Row
shook as if each house were staging
its own private "Charge of the
Light Brigade". The new Row men
of the Class of '41 got a rip-roar
ing welcome.
Stocked with provisions reaped
from the annual trek to "a certain
A\ oodside factory", the Greeks set
off charges of fireworks to wel
come each neophyte.
With pledging a new spirit came
to the Row. Gone was the formal
ity and stiffness of rushing. An at
mosphere of "Welcome, Frosh"
pervaded each fraternity on the
campus.
Special dinners are to follow the
glad-handing. Bull-sessions will be
cut short as frosh returned to En
cina to get smoothed up for the
anual Pledge Prom tonight.
It has been estimated that there
were approximately 146,000 hand
shakes on the Row this afternoon.
1 he number of back-slaps has yet
to be compiled.
