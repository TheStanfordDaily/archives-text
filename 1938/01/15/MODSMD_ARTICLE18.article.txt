# Pan-Hell Not 'Concerned' With Rebellion, Says Paine
## 
### 
Her face drawn after a week of*
Roble insurrection, Barbara Paine,
president of Pan-Hellenic, sighed
this afternoon and very sweetly told
The Daily that "it's been a clean
year. That's about all 1 can say."
Pan-Hellenic wasn't officially con
cerned about the Roble rebels, she
said. Its job was merely to main
tain the sororities' bidding contracts
with the University—that is, prevent
or at least punish "dirty rushing."
Very Interested
"I was personally very interested
in what the freshmen were doing,"
she declared. "All of us have gone
through much the same thing, and
all of us have recognized the in
herent evils of Stanford rushing."
Every year there is some emot
ional excitement and hysteria be
cause of rushing, she explained.
This year, though, the Roble women
felt that maybe it wasn't all so
futile that maybe they could really
do something to relieve the "un
happy" situation.
Trouble Conscious
"The women on the Row were of
course made more intensely con
scious this year of the 'stew' in
Roble," President Paine, a member
of Delta Delta Delta, said. "But
they were surprisingly sane and
rational about it."
As to her official part in rushing
—"as far as we know, there has
been absolutely no illegal rushing.
Reports of it may reach us later,
but right now all nine houses have
clean slates."


BARBARA PAINE
"... a sigh of relief"
