# Yost Says Actives Must Solve Stanford's Sorority Problems
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Roble's anti-sororiLy strike this
week was evidence of some mature
thinking—not merely emotionalism
—but such rebellions are not the
way toward ultimate solution of
the sorority problem at Stanford.
This is the opinion of Dean of
Women Mary Yost, who comment
ed yesterday on the now defunct
movement of three-fourths of the
freshman women, who decided not
to pledge houses this year because
"so many of our friends arc just
heartbroken over it that we don't
think it's all quite fair."
"The answer," said Miss Yost,
"must come as a result of a rational
decision by the active chapters.'
"The movement in Roble was in
teresting because it showed the
type of women we're getting," Miss
Yost declared. "To even think of
attacking a vested interest takes
courage and clear thinking. And
these were only freshmen."
More houses will not settle the
problem either, said the dean, al
though this often has been thought
the panacea. Objections to this
as a solution, she said, are as fol
lows:
First, more houses would not
prevent broken friendships, one of
the freshmen's prime complaints.

Second, more hruses would be
unfair to the halls. It would take
several years to finance a new house
and obtain a national charter.
