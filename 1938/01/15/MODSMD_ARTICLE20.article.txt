# Varsity Quintet Wallops Invading Trojans
## Luisetti, Hurt, Sinks 28 Points To Blast Troy 
### WALT PETERSON 
What did the basketball fans see
last night at Encina Pavilion?
'1 hey saw an incomparable Stan
ford varsity, led by tiie matchless
Captain Hank Luisetti, slash thro
ugh a sturdy, dangerous U.S.C. team
for a brilliant 64-54 victory, in one
of the most colorful hoop games
the coast has seen in years.
They saw a wonderful exhibition
by Luisetti, who tanked 28 points
even though he suffered a deep cut
over the right eye in a collision
with Gail Goodrich, U.S.C. forward,
before he had scored half his total.
Zonne Shines
They saw Phil Zonne, Luisetti ,s
running mate at forward, play the
greatest game of his year-and-a-hall
011 the varsity; big 'l om Siebert, an
untried sophomore with plenty of
class, show in his first varsity game
that he's dynamite; and good old
Nellie Heath, three-year veteran,
always used by Coach John Bunn
in the rough and ready spot, come
through with a world of finesse in
one of the best games in his career.
They saw the rest of the Card
team —Stocfen, Lee, and Calder
wood —put up inspired play to
match the urgent threat of the Iro
jans. They also saw that Coach
Sam Barry can put out basketball
teams even after he has lost two of
the greatest players lie has ever
had, for Ralph Vaughn, dead-eye
soph, and Carl Anderson, whirling
center, have come up to take their
places.
Fans Will See More
All that the fans saw, and they'll
be zooming back for more tonight.
The victory gave Stanford a tie
for the lead in the Pacific Coast
Conference, southern division, but
a win by Troy tonight would give
them the lead. As it stands, Stan
ford and California, which trimmed
U.C.L.A. last night, 39-37, lead with
a victory and no losses.

What did the basketball fans see
last night at Encina Pavilion?
'1 hey saw an incomparable Stan
ford varsity, led by tiie matchless
Captain Hank Luisetti, slash thro
ugh a sturdy, dangerous U.S.C. team
for a brilliant 64-54 victory, in one
of the most colorful hoop games
the coast has seen in years.
They saw a wonderful exhibition
by Luisetti, who tanked 28 points
even though he suffered a deep cut
over the right eye in a collision
with Gail Goodrich, U.S.C. forward,
before he had scored half his total.
Zonne Shines
They saw Phil Zonne, Luisetti ,s
running mate at forward, play the
greatest game of his year-and-a-hall
011 the varsity; big 'l om Siebert, an
untried sophomore with plenty of
class, show in his first varsity game
that he's dynamite; and good old
Nellie Heath, three-year veteran,
always used by Coach John Bunn
in the rough and ready spot, come
through with a world of finesse in
one of the best games in his career.
They saw the rest of the Card
team —Stocfen, Lee, and Calder
wood —put up inspired play to
match the urgent threat of the Iro
jans. They also saw that Coach
Sam Barry can put out basketball
teams even after he has lost two of
the greatest players lie has ever
had, for Ralph Vaughn, dead-eye
soph, and Carl Anderson, whirling
center, have come up to take their
places.
Fans Will See More
All that the fans saw, and they'll
be zooming back for more tonight.
The victory gave Stanford a tie
for the lead in the Pacific Coast
Conference, southern division, but
a win by Troy tonight would give
them the lead. As it stands, Stan
ford and California, which trimmed
U.C.L.A. last night, 39-37, lead with
a victory and no losses.
