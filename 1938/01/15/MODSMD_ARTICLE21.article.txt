# Papooses Drop Rough Battle
## 
### 
Stanford hoop forces had to be
content with a draw in last night's
double bill as the Cardinal frosh
dropped a heartbreaking 20-18 de
cision on free throws to a fighting
Lowell High team.
Bill Cowden, Lowell center, won
the game for his team when he
broke an 18-18 tie by sinking two
foul shots in the fading moments of
the game. Cowden carried off high
point honors for the evening with
eight markers.
Lowell's man -to - man defense
completely bottled up the frosh
attack, holding them to four field
goals during the entire evening.
The frosh meet Stockton High
in tonight's preliminary. Game
started at 6:30 o'clock.
