# Tank Explodes In Cellar Kitchen
## 
### 
Following the emotional fire
works of Roble last week and pre
ceding the actual fireworks on the
Row yesterday afternoon, the tank
containing carbonated water ex
ploded in the Union Cellar kitchen
at 4:15 o'clock Thursday afternoon.
The explosion shocked and frigh
tened the people working in the
kitchen and shot charged water all
over the room, but no one was
hurt. The wire grill around the
tank prevented that. The mechanics
who installed the tank could find no
reason for its exploding. Until it
can be fixed tomorrow, the Union
is dishing out the carbonated water
from emergency containers.

All changes in study lists for this
quarter should be made at the Ad
ministration building not later than
Monday, to avoid fine. After that
day, petitions subject to fees will be
necessary for all program changes.

The Daily wishes to thank Cur
tis Barnes for the idea, and Tom
Thompson for the drawing of the
cartoon on page 1; and Barbara
Paine for making the pledge lists
available before formal pledging.
