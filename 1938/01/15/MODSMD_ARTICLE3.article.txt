# Pledging Soothes Row Headache
## 
### A ROW WOMAN 
Morning alter the preference
night before—
And women in nine sororities up
and down the Row know that their
eight-day rusning headaches will
be soothed for another year when
tlie '38 crop of pledges is planted
tonight behind the heavy doors of
the chapter houses.
Pledge lists and bidding cards
arc the only aspirin for a rushing
headache, as every Greek letter
woman knows. And because a num
ber of freshman women this year
decided not to join the ranks of the
cure-alls for rushing ills, the rush
ing hangovers may be prolonged.
Traditional Sigh
But today with formal rushing
formally over, the Row has at least
breathed its traditional sigh of re
lief.
For another year Row women
can be comparatively normal.
Dressing for dinner to entertain
freshman women, stocking up on
small talk and chit-chat, smiling
and smirking for two hours and
then arguing in drawn-out hash
meetings—these are things of the
past for a while at least.
Though men's rushing is admit
tedly less stifling than women's, the
Stanford sorority system has one
advantage over the Stanford frat
ernity system: sorority rushing does
not drag on through more than a
quarter.
Lights Out
When pledges are eagerly hugged
and kissed in the house tonight, the
sorority spotlight that has been
searching out freshmen with bril
liant intensity for the last two weeks
will be turned off for another year
with only occasional flickerings for
post-season catches.
Sorority rushing is through, fin
ished, and done—though its effects
will remain longer than it's
pleasant to think about.
Rushing is over—hurray, hurray.
