# Lagunita Casas Start 'Rushing'
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
About this time every year, as
sorority pledging ends, Lagunita
Court opens its arms to freshman
women and transfers who are not
speaking Greek.
Housing 211 women in its four
casas, Naranja, Magnolia, Eucalipto,
and Adelfa, the dormitory was first
opened on September 20, 1934. Com
pletion of the living group made it
possible to restrict Roble Hall to
freshmen women and their spon
sors.
Advantages Listed
Since only 45 women live in each
casa, Lagunita combines the ad
vantages of a small living group
with the benefits of wider contacts,
and increased opportunities for in
dividuality in a larger group.
Among the casa activities are
sponsor spreads, exchange dinners
with men's living groups, and Mon
day night house meetings presided
over by the casa president. The hall
as a whole holds quarterly dances,
teas, and faculty dinners.
New Casas Added
Rooms in the hall are singles,
suites of two rooms, large corner
doubles, and smaller doubles with
dressing rooms attached.
Augmenting the original building,
two new casas, del Olivo and
Granada, were opened last October.
The new addition houses approxi
mately 80 women.
Candlelight suppers are held
every Wednesday night. And at
the end of the quarter, the oppres
sion of finals is partially relieved by
afternoon tea and the serving of hot
chocolate at 10:30 o'clock each
night.
