IJp the Row, shortly after dinner
tonight, trooped pledge classes of
the nine sororities on the Stanford
campus. Two hours later, house
doors., were opened to admit Row
men for an all-Row open house.
Because of University regulations,
houses must close, and dancing
stop at midnight, although a num
ber of the sororities will stop earlier
for pledge ceremonies.
