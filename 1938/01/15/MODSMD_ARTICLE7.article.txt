# Sorority Pledging Drops
## Ill-Fated Rebellion Slashes Class To 89 
### 
Sharply hit by the now historic rebellion in Roble this
week, the Farm's nine sororities could count only 89 pledges
tonight when formal bidding ended. Last year's class totaled
108.
Deegees, with 14 new members, topped the houses. Kappas
and Gamma Phis with 12 each were next, closely followed
by the Pi Phis, who pledged 11 members of the Class of '41.

> More than one meal was gulped
with haste and inattention tonight
at Roble as unmutinous freshman
women fidgeted and waited for bids.
Immediately after dinner the
women who yesterday had filed
preference cards in the office of
Mrs. Leona Diekema, head resident,
lined up at the office to get the
word which would settle or dash
their hopes.
Cards, Lists Matched
Mrs. Thomas H. Ward, attorney
for the sororities, had matched pre
ference cards with house lists and
had the bids ready.
Within a few minutes after bids
were presented by Mrs. Ward, cars
driven by Cap and Gown alumnae
were at the Roble door to carry
the women up the row.
Pledges Greeted
At the doors of their chosen
houses the pledges were greeted,
according to Barbara Paine, Pan-
Hellenic president, "however the
houses desire"—(it's usually with
an effusive kiss).
All Row open house, to provide a
widespread and cheerful welcome
for the pledges followed. Dancing
—witli music ranging from radios
through phonographs to small orch
estras—kept the crowds circulating.
