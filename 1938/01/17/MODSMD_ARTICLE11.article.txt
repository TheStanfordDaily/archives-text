# Governor's Wife' Opens Long Run Wednesday
## 
### 
A spectacular bull arena is the
setting for the climax of "The Gov
ernor's Wife," uproarious Spanish
| comedy which opens a six-night run
; at 8 o'clock Wednesday night in the
; Little Theater.
Waldemar Johanscn has designed
a painted back-drop 30 feet wide
; and 20 feet high suggesting the au
j dience of American football fans.
Boxes jammed with spectators take
the center of the stage in this scene.
From these the members of the no
i bility boo and hiss at each other and
! the crowd throws pop-bottles.
A sidewalk cafe on a Spanish plaza
is the background for another of the
acts. Mr. Johansen has executed a
drop showing the brown houses and
red-tiled roofs of the town. Inte
riors include a room in the gover
' nor's palace and a little shop.
| Colorful costumes of nld Spain j

contrast with the modern dress of
the town big-wigs in "The Gover
nor's Wife." The costumes of the 27
members of the cast were designed
by Mrs. Helen Green. Frock coats
and fashionable gowns pop out un
expectedly from among the man
tillas, sombreros and other tradi
tional items of Spanish dress.
Performances of "The Governor's
Wife" are scheduled for next Wed
nesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Monday, and a week from Wednes
day. Tickets will be 40 cents and
