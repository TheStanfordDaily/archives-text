at 1:30 o'clock yesterday morning
after he and a companion were fol

house in a seemingly intoxicated
condition. Beucus' companion, whose

leased by police.
An overcoat belonging to Ed Hal

charges of theft.
Douglas and Arrasmith were re

saw the man take off in a car in
great haste. They trailed the car
and forced it off the road at the in

looking for a man named Fishback
who resided in the "Phi Bete" house.
The two students took the coat
and allowed Beucus and his com
panion to proceed. Douglas and Ar
rasmith trailed the car again and
trapped the car in Mayfield, where
they notified the police.
