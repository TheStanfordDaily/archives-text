# Delts Plagued By Fake Invitations
## 
### 
Astounded were the Delts Satur
day noon when, awakening after a
hard night of pledge prom and hand
shaking, they found they were
scheduled to entertain 250 freshmen
women at 1 o'clock.
They got word somehow that a
rival had sent out postcard invita
tions. Announcing refreshments,
the cards asked the women to at
tend an "informal presentation of
pledges" at the Delta Tau Delta
house.
"We'll order some stuff and call
in some Pi Phis for a floor show,"
thought the beleaguered Delts. "And
maybe a housemother to help things
along." Then they remembered
that women's pledge lists were not
yet out. Pi Phis plus frosh would
be dirty rushing.
Things didn't look so bad, how
ever, when rumors of the hoax kept
all but 30 of the Robleites from
coming. And things looked posi
tively good for the Delts when they
"found those 30 were just about the
cream of the frosh class. The only
trouble now is that the Delts want
to laugh at someone, but they aren't
sure yet who sent the fake invita
tions.
