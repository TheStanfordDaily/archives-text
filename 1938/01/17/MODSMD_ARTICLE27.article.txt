# Final Foul Ruling Gives S.C. 49-48 Win Over Indians
## Luisetti Leads Scoring As Indians Take Friday Game, 64-54 
### 
Officially the results of the Stanford-University of Southern Cali
fornia basketball week-end iust concluded stand as follows:
Stanford, one win and one loss; U.S.C., likewise.
The confusing climax to one of the hottest southern division half
series in history, when Stanford's 11. B. Lee scored a foul throw during

half time of the second game that
did and then didn't count, has been
completely ironed out. Troy wins,
49-48.
The story of that foul, committed
by Dale Sears. Trojan center, had
two facets. Fn.st there was a ques
tion of whether the foul had been
committed before or after the end
of the half. The gun denoting the
end of the period was late, but it
was decided by Official Scorer J. E.
Markee that Referee Lloyd Leith
had not blown his whistle for the
foul until after the buzzer on the
electric timer had sounded the close
of the first half.
Foul Not Flagrant
Then there arose the question of
whether the foul, even though com
mited during the intermission, might
count. The rule book says that a
"flagrant" foul in the rest period
shall be recognized. Sears' foul was
not flagrant, it was decided at

length, and although Lee scored the
point before the start of the second
half it was just a precautionary
measure that did no harm but also
no good.
Apart from the legal aspects of
the situation, the two games—the
first won by Stanford 64-54, with
Captain Luisetti scoring 28 points,
and the second won by U.S.C. 49-
48, with Hank tanking 13—kept the
fans on edge constantly.
At the finale of the Friday night
contest, the crowd stood and ap
plauded Luisetti for his marvelous
exhibition. Saturday night the
fans stood and screeched for the
last three minutes of the battle as
Stanford, once behind 40-28, pulled
into a tie with a mighty U.S.C. out
fit, nosed ahead on a brilliant 40-
foot shot by Beebs Lee, and then
lost by one point in the last 20
seconds.
Indians Lack Fire
The Cardinal squad was brilliant
Friday—every man that played had
everything he needed. Saturday it
was different, for the Indians lacked
fire in the first half. Center Art
the head of the attack in the second
half Saturday that Stanford came
from 12 points behind to almost
win. Calderwood at his best,
slashing, reckless, and irresistible,
was the picture the fans got in the
second half. He picked up the
whole team with his play, to give
U.S.C. Coach "Elevator" Sam Barry
something to hop up and down
about.
Siebert Stars
Showings that bode well for fu
ture Stanford varsities were made
by Soph Tom Siebert, in both
games, and Derrol Huddleson, in
the second game. Siebert was ter
rific on offense, Huddleson was a
pesty little guy on both offense and
defense.
For U.S.C., the touted forward
Ralph Vaughn was all they said of
him, a great shot and a vicious
Stoefer, out on fouls in the first
half of the first game, was afraid to
bear down and his defensive and
