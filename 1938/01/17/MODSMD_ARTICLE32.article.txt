## 
### 
America's peace policies must be guided by "straight thinking" and
"geared to realities" if war is to be prevented, former President Herbert
Hoover declared in a radio address Saturday afternoon in San Francisco.
The only living ex-President said that "we are torn into confusion by
idealistic dreaming, by wishful thinking, by the illusion of isolation where

there is no isolation"' and warned
that old national origins make
Americans sympathetic to "con
scious or unconscious propaganda."
'American Peace Policies'
Discussing a program of "Ameri
can Policies for Peace," the former
President's address was made be
fore a luncheon at the Fairmount
Hotel, and was transmitted by radio
to the annual New York City meet
ings of the Women's National Re
publican club. Among those at
tending the luncheon was Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Stanford president.
As a contributing factor to pres
ent international unrest, Mr.
Hoover placed responsibility upon
the Roosevelt Administration for
having lost "the unparalleled op
portunity to have brought some
measure of economic peace" to all
nations "when the World Economic
Conference was delaped and finally
destroyed by our Government in
19.33."
Hoover Cites Mission
"The three dominant and im
mediate missions" before this coun
try at the present time, Mr. Hoover
asserted, are:
1—"To maintain its own inde
pendence.
2—"To maintain its own inde
men and women.
3—"To cooperate with the rest of
the world to lift the burdens of war
and to build again its prosperity and
its hopes."
Neutrality Urged
Urging the preservation of neu
trality, Mr. Hoover urged that
America should limit its use of
arms solely "to repel aggression
against the Western Hemisphere."
"We should not join in any eco
nomic sanctions or embargoes or
boycotts in endeavor to prevent or
end other people's wars," he em
phasized.
In conclusion he advocated the
upholding of the Kellogg Pact, the
submission of international disputes
to arbitration, and joint action by
all nations in denunciation of treaty
violations.
