DAILY* SCRIVENERS
BOWL OVER CHAPPIES
Elsewhere on this page can be
found a gripping account of the
Dippy sports staff second athletic
victory in as many starts this year.
Down at Thurlow's the Dippy
ten pin artists went to work on the
Chappie quartette of keglers Satur
day afternoon and trimmed them
by some 242 points.
The sports scriveners, inflated
with a sense of superior bowling
skill, do hereby issue a challenge
to any legitimate and bona fide
four-man team on the Farm.
Rumor has it that the Breaker's
fearless fcur have bravely come
out in the open with a challenge
to the peerless ones. The chal
lenge was made, however, before
the Dippy's crushing victory.
In a few other coast institutions,
including Cal, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.,
bowling is listed on the intramural
sports bill. We believe it should be
added here.
BOWLING NEEDS
A HELPING HAND
There's hardly a fraternity or
club on the campus that wouldn't
put out a team. The only argu
ment against the idea that could
possibly bear any weight, is the ex
pense item. Other intramural
sports don't cost the competitors
any money except tennis. In that
sport the losers have to buy tennis
balls.
The Daily wants to encourage
bowling here at Stanford. To start
the ball rolling, I'll guarantee to
print a short story on each and ev
ery bowling match held, if frater
nities or clubs will challenge each
other, and put a siip of paper-, giving
the score and lineups, in my box
over here in the shack.
HOOP FANS WENT
HOME IN DAZE
That hoop game Saturday night
sent 2800 fans home in a daze.
Never has there been a game like it
in the annals of coast conference
basketball history.
The official ruling did not allow
11. B. Lee's free throw. It seemed
that the gun stuck and the half
was fouled. Therefore Lee's shot,
made before the second half got,
under way, was not counted in the
scorebook.
It looked like a Cardinal victory,
when, with 30 seconds to go, Lee
arched a 40-footer through the net.
That ball didn't touch the hoop and
put the Indians out in front by one
point. If the Bunnmen could have
held five seconds longer the game
would have gone to Stanford by a
48-47 count.
Stanford was definitely out
played in the first half. Hank was
suffering from lack of sleep and a
splitting headache, and Art Stoe
fen, Jack Calderwood, and Phil
Zcntie were far from their top
ability.
"Spook"' Calderwood's comeback
in the second half was the main
factor that pulled Stanford from 12
points in the rut up into a tie with
a smooth-clicking, alert, Southern
California five.
