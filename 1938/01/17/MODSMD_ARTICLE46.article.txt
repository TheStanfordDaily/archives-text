# Frosh Cagers Bruised By Week-End Tilts
## Coach Gorter Musters Forces for San Mateo Contest Wednesday 
### 
Following its dismal week-end,
Coach Wytze Gorter is collecting
the Stanford's scattered frosh hoop
forces and at today's practice will
attempt to piece the team together
again for Wednesday's fray with
San Mateo Junior College.
Two high school quintets invaded
the Pavilion last week-end for pre- i
liminary games with the frosh, and i
after the smoke had cleared both
Lowell and Stockton Highs had de- ;
parted with victories, Lowell win- j
ning Friday night's affair, 29-18, \
and Stockton annexing the Satur- '
day's game, 33-30.
Stockton Midgets
The hit of the week-end was
Coach Pete Lenz' tiny Stockton
cagers. The tallest boy on the
whole squad was only 5 foot 10,
while the team as a whole aver
aged 5 foot 7.
D. Rogers, tiny guard for the un
defeated Stocktons, carried off high
point honors for the evening with
13 digits. Rogers tips the Fairbanks
at an insignificant 104 pounds.
Looking for all the world like
some prep school lightweight team,
Stockton rolled up an early lead on
the frosh and held off a late first
half rally to hold a 17-14 advantage
at halftime. The winners drew ;
away once more in the second half, j
and Stanford had to rally again to !
make the score as close as it finally |
was.
Don Williams was high point man
for Stanford with eight points.
Friday evening the Papooses J
dropped the duke to an aggressive <
band of hoopsters from Lowell High. |
Coached by Benny Neff, Lowell I
showed the yearlings a man-to- J
man defense that completely bot- J
tied the "Stanford attack, holding :
them to four goals all evening.
