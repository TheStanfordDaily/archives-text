# Daily Keglers Bowl Over Chappie Team
## "Curses, Foiled Again" Snarls Hartmann 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
From Bulling Alley to Bowling
Alley in One Short. Lesson was
just about 10 instruction periods too
lew for the Hammer & Coffin boys.
For today they are beaten men,
slinking around their dusty, cob
webbed hovel, back at their never
ending task of digging up not-too
good jokes for further mangling.
That's all they can do, because they
know now (we knew it all the time)
that they couldn't bowl.
Chappie Fails
yhey tried it yesterday against
The Daily sports staff bowling team
and failed miserably. 'Tis indeed a
pity.
The Chappie keglers don't know
how lucky they were to get off
with such an easy beating, because
when they read this, they will learn
for the first time that each man of
The Daily quartette bowled with
his left eye shut.
Before anyone should begin to
wonder, let me explain here and
now that the term keglers refers
exclusively to bowling, and has no
connection whatsoever with you
know-what.

To enlighten you further as to the
prowess of The Dailymen, be it
known that three of the four
sportswriters far outscored the
Chappies' high man, and the fourth's
point total was only 11 digits under
said high man's score.
Aggregate score for The Daily's
squad was IG6B as compared with
the Chappies' 1426 —a difference of
242 points. Individual scores fol
low:

From Bulling Alley to Bowling
Alley in One Short. Lesson was
just about 10 instruction periods too
lew for the Hammer & Coffin boys.
For today they are beaten men,
slinking around their dusty, cob
webbed hovel, back at their never
ending task of digging up not-too
good jokes for further mangling.

know now (we knew it all the time)
that they couldn't bowl.
Chappie Fails
yhey tried it yesterday against
The Daily sports staff bowling team
and failed miserably. 'Tis indeed a
pity.
The Chappie keglers don't know
how lucky they were to get off
with such an easy beating, because
when they read this, they will learn
for the first time that each man of
The Daily quartette bowled with
his left eye shut.
Before anyone should begin to
wonder, let me explain here and
now that the term keglers refers
exclusively to bowling, and has no
connection whatsoever with you
know-what.

prowess of The Dailymen, be it
known that three of the four

Chappies' high man, and the fourth's
point total was only 11 digits under
said high man's score.
Aggregate score for The Daily's
squad was IG6B as compared with
the Chappies' 1426 —a difference of
242 points. Individual scores fol
low:
