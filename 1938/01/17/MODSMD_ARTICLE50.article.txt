## Hard One to Take, Yet... 
### 
STANFORD opened its collective eyes Sun
day morning to find that this was not, after
all, the best of all possible worlds. Though the
sun had risen as usual, its glory was dimmed by
a vague memory that the basketball team had
lost a game the night before.
For the first time since Big Game Sunday,
Popeye and Blondie were passed by for the
sports pages. There, through the worse than
usual Sabbath fog, the collective eyes confirmed
the memory.
But the night before there was talk of a dis
puted point, the last words of the radio an
nouncer who described the game were that
Coach John Bunn was to telephone the Con
ference rules committee for a decision. A tech
nical point could have given Stanford a tie.
Eyes hopefully read on down the column, for
further news of this.
When the looked-for information was found,
however, the sun shown no brighter and disap
pointment was still fashionable. Immediately
after the game, the papers said, Coach John
Bunn had announced that there would be no

protest. Stanford had lost, 49 48.
But for most, sober second thought soon dis
pelled the clouds of disappointment and con
firmed the wiseness of this course. Now, with
the excitement of a close game dissipated, Mon
day thinking should show the situation in its
true perspective.
The basketball teams of Stanford and Uni
versity of Southern California played Saturday
night to see which was best on that particular
night. That the score as it stands is the correct
answer, was shown clearly throughout the
game. Stanford did not play up to maximum
efficiency, trailed at half time and at the finish.
After the first few minutes the Indians were in
the lead only once and then only by one point.
Not only would protest on whether the timing
device or the referee's whistle should end the
half seem petty, but also a replay could not
change the fact that U.S.C. played better ball
during the regulation time. To John Bunn should
go much credit for realizing this so quickly in
the aftergame excitement.
The score was 49-48 last week, Stanford los
ing. This week Stanford plays California.—L. L.
