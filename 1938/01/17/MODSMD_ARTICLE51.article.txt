# Come Join, Band
## 
### 
ryiODAY is Monday. This is an editorial on
_L the Band. But here the popular tradition of
Monday band-panning falls down, for Stan
ford's brasses were kept quietly in the closet
during the week-end's skirmish with Troy's
Indianans.
Reason for the absence probably was not, as
was popularly suspected, penury on the part of
an oft-criticized B.A.C. Though this may have
been one factor, the real cause was the atrocious
band-acoustics which result from 40 or 50 in
struments going full blast in the under-sized,
steel-lined pavilion.
Granted that this is a legitimate argument, it
still leaves the Board with no adequate reasons
for not sending Stanford's much improved
Band to Berkeley Friday night. Since their re
organization last fall the "swing boys" have
not had many good chances to strut their stuff
and Cal's pavilion will offer the best of au
diences.
Farm rooters will remember last year's first
game at Berkeley when the U.C. band broke
into a lovely waltz arrangement of "Come Join
the Band."
The Daily hopes that there will be no repe
tition of that incident, but Stanford might do
well to have on hand its body of trumpeteers
to counter if necessary.â€”J. R.
