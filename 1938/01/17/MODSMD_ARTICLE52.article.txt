CONFESSION IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL
I N THESE dark days of misunderstanding when one
man knows not that his brother is doing him, it is
not surprising that The Daily is the subject of more
mistaken opinions than a virtuous fan dancer.
Local cynics picture Our Editor as a sort of beast
of prey who crouches in his lair waiting to pounce on
poor woodcutters in the administrative forests. Chap
arral pictures the staff as a sleep-walkers union, tread
ing cautiously among stacks of beer bottles and
drowsing placidly over exchanges. A few idealistic
lassies in Roble who read "Frank Merriwell" at an
impressionable age see the staff as a dynamo, dis
charging noble thoughts and beautiful ideas. For
them the shack is a temple of Minerva, where well
turned phrases lie about on the floor, and scintillating
ideas can be picked up buffet style.

As a matter of fact, if The Daily ever met one of
these versions of itself, it would need a formal intro
duction. Predatory pouncing is frowned on, and it's
about as easy to find an idea in the exchanges as it
is to find a girl at a jolly-up. The Golden Rule
doesn't hang framed over the Editor's desk, but then
there's no statue of Hearst there either.
The idea conference this afternoon would give a
nasty jolt both to Roble's dreaming maidens and to
Chappie's columnists. Present were the Editor and I,
with various lights and shadows of the staff flitting in
atid out.

"WELL," I said, "what the hell do I write about
today? We've picked all the fight with Chap
pie they're good for. Jorgi's gone, dammit, and his
committee's told the Loyalists that if they want to be
nasty about their old funds they can go and bleed to
death for all it cares. What say I write on rushing?
The system is poisonous enough to kill a gila monster."
"No," quoth the oracle. '"That isn't too good.
There's nothing you can say about the mess that
hasn't already been said. We've tried to keep off the
trite subjects this volume, and there's no use broad
jumping into one."
I shelved the idea remembering that all the nasty
remarks I could make had gone through the linotype
back in the days when only hen's laid eggs on the
Farm.

"Well," I suggested, "there's always the Bawlout.
But it would make me almost as sick to write on it
as it does to read it."
"Yeah," said the Editor, "we've got. to stay away
lrom these moth-eaten crusades. Everybody expects
you to sound off like a congressman. And every time
you say anything you get accused of wanting an in
vitation to sorority suppers. Of course I wouldn't re
fuse an invii.ition, but we can't use second-hand cru
sades.

One of the associate editors ploughed in. "Got a
cigarette?" he asked, and departed dismally at the
sight of an empty package.
The night editor came in wanting to know where
the hell the columns were.
And I went out wondering what started the idea
that college newspapers are personally supervised by
Stalin.â€”John Cobbs.
