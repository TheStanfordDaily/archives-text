# GOIN' MY WAY

### 
IJ AVING played day in, day out, for five long years
of depression, recession, and Wally Simpson, "To
bacco road" has returned to San Francisco. The show
will be here for two weeks.
Leading the road-show cast is John Barton in his
dirtiest rags as Jeeter Lester, now famed Georgia
cracker. There's not much to say about Jack Kirk
land's dramatization of Erskine Caldwell's novel of
the poor white trash. As Stage said awhile back,
"Tobacco Road" is getting almost old enough to vote,
and it still seems to bring the crowds to the box-office
in both sophisticated New York and in the provinces
of the Mid West. If you haven't seen it yet, better do
so, because it will be something your grandchildren
will ask you about when they have seen it in their
turn.
* * * *
Next door to the Curran, the Geary is opening to
night with Mark Reed's "Yes, My Darling Daughter."
In the cast are Florence Reed, Agnes Doyle, Regina
Wallace, and others. The show ran most of last year
in New York and was tabbed as one of the season s
best comedies.
It's all about the mother who sowed her wild oats
in the course of a Greenwich Gillage career, and who
has to yes her darling daughter when she wants to
spend a week-end in a lakeside cottage with her boy
friend—to solve a personal problem or so.
You'll like this one too, and you have three weeks
to see it in, so hop to it.

a Valentine's Day present next month, the
Curran theater will present "Porgy and Bess" for
one week. The production will bring the complete
New York cast with Tod Duncan, Anne Brown, and
Ruby Elezy.
Due to his untimely death, the "Porgy and Bess"
music will go down as the climax of George Gersh
win's career. The success with which it was received
reminds one of the old days when the peepul, as well
as the intelligensia, considered opera as something
which they could sing as well as appreciate in the
abstract.
They tell a story about Verdi's "Rigoletto" which
exemplifies the way in which opera music can take on
the qualities of popular appeal which only swing
seems to have today. The aria "La Donna Mobile"
was never sung in rehearsal because the composer
feared that it would become so popular that the open
ing performance would be something of an anti
climax. And his fears were justified by the reception
it was given when finally sung on the opening night.
Within 24 hours, seemingly, everyone was singing it,
from dukes to streetsweepers.
Now, the only thing the peepul know is the "Tore
ador Song," which is sung by naughty little boys in
a pornographic version.—Stone.

music will go down as the climax of George Gersh
win's career. The success with which it was received
reminds one of the old days when the peepul, as well
as the intelligensia, considered opera as something
which they could sing as well as appreciate in the
abstract.
They tell a story about Verdi's "Rigoletto" which
exemplifies the way in which opera music can take on
the qualities of popular appeal which only swing
seems to have today. The aria "La Donna Mobile"
was never sung in rehearsal because the composer
feared that it would become so popular that the open
ing performance would be something of an anti
climax. And his fears were justified by the reception
it was given when finally sung on the opening night.
Within 24 hours, seemingly, everyone was singing it,
from dukes to streetsweepers.
Now, the only thing the peepul know is the "Tore
ador Song," which is sung by naughty little boys in
a pornographic version.—Stone.
IJ AVING played day in, day out, for five long years
of depression, recession, and Wally Simpson, "To
bacco road" has returned to San Francisco. The show
will be here for two weeks.
Leading the road-show cast is John Barton in his
dirtiest rags as Jeeter Lester, now famed Georgia
cracker. There's not much to say about Jack Kirk
land's dramatization of Erskine Caldwell's novel of
the poor white trash. As Stage said awhile back,
"Tobacco Road" is getting almost old enough to vote,
and it still seems to bring the crowds to the box-office
in both sophisticated New York and in the provinces
of the Mid West. If you haven't seen it yet, better do
so, because it will be something your grandchildren
will ask you about when they have seen it in their
turn.

Next door to the Curran, the Geary is opening to
night with Mark Reed's "Yes, My Darling Daughter."
In the cast are Florence Reed, Agnes Doyle, Regina
Wallace, and others. The show ran most of last year
in New York and was tabbed as one of the season s
best comedies.
It's all about the mother who sowed her wild oats
in the course of a Greenwich Gillage career, and who
has to yes her darling daughter when she wants to
spend a week-end in a lakeside cottage with her boy
friend—to solve a personal problem or so.
You'll like this one too, and you have three weeks
to see it in, so hop to it.

a Valentine's Day present next month, the
Curran theater will present "Porgy and Bess" for
one week. The production will bring the complete
New York cast with Tod Duncan, Anne Brown, and
Ruby Elezy.
Due to his untimely death, the "Porgy and Bess"
music will go down as the climax of George Gersh
