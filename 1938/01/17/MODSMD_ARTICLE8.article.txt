# Blum Seeks Support For Paris Cabinet
## Situation Still Regarded As Critical; Monetary Demands May Arise 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 16. (UP). â€” Leon
Blum, Socialist leader who com
manded the only Socialist govern
ment in the history of France, to
night accepted President Albert Le
brun's invitation to attempt to form
a cabinet to succeed the collapsed
government of Premier Camille
Chautemps.
Blum was hustled into the breach
after two radical Socialist leaders,
former Finance Minister Georges
Bonnet and former Premier Albert
Sarraut, refused to attempt to form
a government in the face of oppo
sition from the Socialist and Com
munist groups.
To Make Demands
The 65-year-old Socialist," whose
cabinet was overthrown seven
months ago when the French senate
refused to grant him extraordinary
monetary powers, was expected to
reiterate the same demands if he is
able to organize a government.
The situation was regarded as ex
tremely critical, even if Blum should
succeed in forming a cabinet, since
radical Socialists have made their
support of Blum contingent upon his
pledge of monetary freedom.
Party Conflicts
Blum's acceptance ended 24 hours
of feverish activity at the Elysee
Palace, during which Bonnet, Sar
raut, Chautemps and Blum were in
almost constant conference.
Bonnet informed the President
early today that he was unable to
salvage support of the Socialists and
Communists in the face of the op
position of labor and left wing
groups to his financial policies, and
declined the offer of premiership.
It was understood that if Blum
failed to organize support for a
Socialist government, Sarraut would
agi-ee to make an attempt, presum
ably with a popular front rather
than an all-radical Socialist cabinet.
