### 
Jacinto Benevente, author of
Governor's Wife" which opens
a six-night run on the Farm to
morrow night, is one of the best
known modern European play
wrights.
Tlie plays of this Spanish drama
tist are among the most frequent
presentations on the continent. His
best known works are "Bonds of
Interest," "La Malyuerida," and
"The Governor's Wife." Besides
being a playwright, Senior Bene
vente is a distinguished and popular
actor.
"The Governor's Wife" takes place
in a Spanish village during a hilari
ous three-day fiesta. According to
Director H. Miles Heberer, the at
mosphere is something like that at
Stanford during the three days be
fore the Big Game.
At the same time the play pre
sents an accurate picture of all the
celebrated aspects of Spanish lifeâ€”
the bullfight, the fiesta, colorful
cafes, and local political squabbles.
In the scene in the bull arena
the patrons behave like American
students at a football game but are
not nearly so decorous. They
scream at the bull, the toreadors,
their friends and enemies, and throw
pop bottles.
The plot centers around the ar
rival of a shady theatrical troupe
in the town to find itself the center
of a political battle. The company
becomes the target of both liberals
and conservatives in the battle. Af
ter numerous complications and the
birth and death of a few feuds,
everything is straightened out to
suit hei'self by the Governor's wife.
