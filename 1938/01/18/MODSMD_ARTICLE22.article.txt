# Pipes Burstâ€” "Rain" In Roble
## 
### 
Robleites scarcely knew the
difference between inside and
outside Sunday evening when
they entered Roble to find that
umbrellas just put down again
were necessary to get them
through 3-C corridor in a shower
caused by a broken water pipe
under the roof.
Garbage cans, fruit bowls, and
water glasses were put into use
to catch the water dripping from
the ceiling, and clothes from ev
ery closet were thrown hurriedly
on the beds to save them from a
soaking.
