"The Indian is America's most
completely forgotten man," Joel V.
Berreman, instructor in sociology,
said last night in a talk over KGO.
"The white race thinks it is doing
the Indian a favor by foisting on
him the white man's culture," he
remarked in the course of his broad
cast.
Berreman maintained that as a
result of this feeling the Red Man is
being remade to satisfy our assump
tions of superiority.
