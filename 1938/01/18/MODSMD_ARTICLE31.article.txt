# Hashers Ask Excom to Give Date for Dance
## 
### 
Opening Ex Committee business !
tonight will be the request of Stan- j
ford's Hasher's Union for a dance I
date. Having had trouble in finding
an open date, the Union will attempt I
to close arrangements for a campus i
dance sometime in February.
Boyd White, head of the commit- j
tee which is making plans for a
campus President's Birthday Ball on 1
January 27, will request Ex Commit- 1
tee to waive A.S.S.U. constitution
rules which state that no dance may
last after 8 o'clock during week
nights. Owing to the impossibility
of obtaining either the Women's j
Gym or the Pavilion any afternoon, j
the committee can only schedule the I
dance from 7 to 9 o'clock in the eve- I
ning, thus violating by-laws rule, i
Dr. Trueblood will submit a plan <
for a China Medical Aid group to be !
formed at Slanlord. The group will j
be nonpartisan, in contrast to the
Spanish Loyalist Aid group which i
was formed last fall.
After having been officially recog
nized by Ex Committee as a cam- 1
pus organization, the Ski Club will i
seek to have skiing recognized as a I
minor sport at Stanford.
Discussion will be held over the j
question of sending a representative |
to the National Scholastic Federa- j
tion's annual conference next year, j
Although Stanford has always sent a !
representative in the past, it has j
been felt that little value has been j
gained from the meeting.
