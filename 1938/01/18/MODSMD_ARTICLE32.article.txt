FARM HOOPSTERS CARRY
ON FEUD FRIDAY
The 1937-1938 Indian-Bear feud
will-spark into activity again Friday
night when Hank Luisetti and his
Farm hands move into the Razz
berry Canyon district to take on
California's Bears, who are not quite
so adept on the hardwood as they
were on the gridiron.
The Bears have by far the upper
hand in tiie feud, counting 10
victories over the Indians. The
Stanfords can only point to four
Bear scalps.
The Californians chalked up tv/o
football victories . . . varsity, 13-0,
and reserve, 12-0; two wins in var
sity water polo, 3-1 and 7-1; two
successful varsity soccer games; a
tremendous 68-15 win in cross
country; two victories in frosh soc
cer; and a match win in fencing.
Stanford can only point to a frosh
football win, 13-0; ' two successful
frosh water polo battles, 2-1 and
3-1; a varsity soccer win. 1-0.
Cap'n Hankus, Stork, Spook, and
the rest of the gang have a chance
to put the Indians back in the run
ning by dropping four of the Bear
tribe in this annual feuding. That'll
make the casualty list eight for the
Indians and 10 for the Bears.
NIBS' TEAM HIGHLY
UNDER-RATED ON COAST
Nibs Price's team wasn't to be
worth much this season but it
pulled a surprise by winning 7 out
of 11 games on its Northern and
Midwestern barnstorming tour.
The California hoopslers ran up
a string of five straight victories
over such top-notch Middle West
teams as Ohio State, Michigan
State, Northwestern, Creighton,
and Detroit, finally being halted
by Nebraska in an overtime game.
This Cal series is going to be no
set-up. Don't lull yourself into a
sense of false security. The Bears
haven't a super team, but they have
a real team and they will, as always,
be pointing for the Cards.
BUNN'S BOYS SHOULD
WIN COMFORTABLY
I look for Bunn's men to win this
first game •by a fairly comfortable
margin. They were hot Friday night
and the Trojans didn't have much of
a chance. They were all off for
three fourths of the game Saturday
night and weren't in the ball game
until the final 10 minutes.
We're looking for John's laughing
boys to come back against the Bears
with plenty of pep after a good
week's rest, and give the Berkeley
beast a sound hiding. Even if the
Indians are off Friday night, a
rally near the end probably will
give them a victory instead of a
near victory. The Bears are under
rated this year, but they still can't
put a team like the Trojans did on
the floor.
Wally Frederick, Cal's ace pub
licity expert, rates the Bears a dis
tinct threat to Luisetti & Co.
Wally's right . . . the Bears are
a serious contender . . . but that's
about as far as it goes. Stanford
and U.S.C. are going to have to have
more than one off-night and the
Bears are going to have to have
the sporting god of luck with them
to win the southern division title.

football victories . . . varsity, 13-0,
and reserve, 12-0; two wins in var
sity water polo, 3-1 and 7-1; two
successful varsity soccer games; a
tremendous 68-15 win in cross
country; two victories in frosh soc
cer; and a match win in fencing.
Stanford can only point to a frosh
football win, 13-0; ' two successful
frosh water polo battles, 2-1 and
3-1; a varsity soccer win. 1-0.
Cap'n Hankus, Stork, Spook, and
the rest of the gang have a chance
to put the Indians back in the run
ning by dropping four of the Bear
tribe in this annual feuding. That'll
make the casualty list eight for the
Indians and 10 for the Bears.
NIBS' TEAM HIGHLY
UNDER-RATED ON COAST
Nibs Price's team wasn't to be
worth much this season but it
pulled a surprise by winning 7 out
of 11 games on its Northern and
Midwestern barnstorming tour.
The California hoopslers ran up
a string of five straight victories
over such top-notch Middle West
teams as Ohio State, Michigan
State, Northwestern, Creighton,
and Detroit, finally being halted
by Nebraska in an overtime game.
This Cal series is going to be no
set-up. Don't lull yourself into a
sense of false security. The Bears
haven't a super team, but they have
a real team and they will, as always,
be pointing for the Cards.
BUNN'S BOYS SHOULD
WIN COMFORTABLY
I look for Bunn's men to win this
first game •by a fairly comfortable
margin. They were hot Friday night
and the Trojans didn't have much of
a chance. They were all off for
three fourths of the game Saturday
night and weren't in the ball game
until the final 10 minutes.
We're looking for John's laughing
boys to come back against the Bears
with plenty of pep after a good
week's rest, and give the Berkeley
beast a sound hiding. Even if the
Indians are off Friday night, a
rally near the end probably will
give them a victory instead of a
near victory. The Bears are under
rated this year, but they still can't
put a team like the Trojans did on
the floor.
Wally Frederick, Cal's ace pub
licity expert, rates the Bears a dis
tinct threat to Luisetti & Co.
Wally's right . . . the Bears are
a serious contender . . . but that's
about as far as it goes. Stanford
and U.S.C. are going to have to have
more than one off-night and the
Bears are going to have to have
the sporting god of luck with them
to win the southern division title.

FARM HOOPSTERS CARRY
ON FEUD FRIDAY
The 1937-1938 Indian-Bear feud
will-spark into activity again Friday
night when Hank Luisetti and his
Farm hands move into the Razz
berry Canyon district to take on
California's Bears, who are not quite
so adept on the hardwood as they
were on the gridiron.
The Bears have by far the upper
hand in tiie feud, counting 10
victories over the Indians. The
Stanfords can only point to four
Bear scalps.
The Californians chalked up tv/o
football victories . . . varsity, 13-0,
and reserve, 12-0; two wins in var
