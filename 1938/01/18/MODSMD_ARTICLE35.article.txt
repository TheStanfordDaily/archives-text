# Bunn Starts Scrimmages For Cal Tilt
## First Team Gets Rest As Second, Third Stringers Work Out 
### 
Giving the first team a rest after I
the two bruising games with Troy (
over the week-end, Coach John
Bunn sent his second and third
string basketball charges through a
scrimmage yesterday to get them
into shape for the first California
game this Friday.
Bob Zonne and .Bob Burnett,
guards, Derrol Huddleson and Leon |
Lal'aille, forwards, and Tom Seibert, j
center, constituted the second out- i
fit. Huddleson, hustling little soph |
who showed his best previous el- j
forts in the Cal freshman series last
year, stepped into a tight hole Sat
urday night and came out with
colors flying.
Luisetti Not Out
His showing at forward, when a
demoralized Card team was making
a brilliant comeback, has earned
him the second-team job.
Capaitn Hank Luisetti did not
come out to practice, since he suf
fers from a slight cold caught over
the week-end. The. injured eye,
patched up at half time Friday
night, is not bothering him any
longer, according to Coach Bunn.
The remainder of the first squad
— Stoefen, Lee, Calderwood, and
Phil Zonne—went through a light
shooting workout and skull prac
tice with the remainder of the var
sity.
It's Up To Cal
In answer to the query as to how
he planned to stop the Bears at
Berkeley Friday, Coach Bunn said,
"Why, we haven't considered that
proposition—we're going to let the
Bears worry about stopping us."
Results of the week-end find
Stanford in third place in Ihe con
ference, southern division. Cali
fornia, with two wins over U.C.L.A.,
leads with a 1.000 percent average.
U.S.C. holds second with two vic
tories and a loss, .667, while Stan
ford has .500 with the split pair
against Troy. Poor little U.C.L.A.,
without John Ball this year, is be
ing made the doormat of the loop
with three losses so far, .000.
Troy Has Edge
U.S.C. must be conceded a slight
advantage in the league at this junc
ture, since they will have the rest
of their greatest competition, against
Stanford, on their home court.
Stanford must travel to them for the
remaining two games of the series.
There will be a practice battle
against Harlan Dykes' Gaels of St.
Mary's Saturday night in the Pa
vilion, after the Cal contest Friday.
Student body cards will admit to
the game with the Moragans.
