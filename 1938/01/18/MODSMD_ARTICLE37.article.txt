# Cindermen Hold Time Trials On Wet Track
## 
### 
Soggy track and cloudy sky did
not keep Dink Templeton's cinder
men from going through time trials
yesterday. Times were slowed down
by heavy cinders.
Ray Malott won the quarter easily
and later nosed out Norm Bright in
the half mile. Bright had cleaned
up earlier in the mile.
Henry McMicking, a freshman,
surprised bystanders by winning a
second heat of the quarter, nosing
out even Cy Oberg, veteran 440
star.
Allan Grey, freshman shot-putter,
drew eyes from the runners three
times by tossing the pill over 47
feet. His best, which is sensational
for a frosh this early in the season,
was 47 feet three inches. The rec
ord for the Little Big Meet—and
that is a long way off—is 48 feet
five inches.
Stan Hiserman gained honors in
the 100-yard dash and the low
hurdles.
Dick Simpson won the 120-yard

high hurdles, and Johnny Emanuel
came in far ahead in the two mile.
AGUA CALIENTE, Lower Cal.,
Jan. 17 (UP). —With conversion of
the premises into an aviation and
industrial school scheduled to get
under way this week, the $10,000,000
Agua Caliente Hotel today remained
in the hands of the 400 workers who
seized the resort January 3. Federal
soldiers and a vigilance committee of
workers continued to guard the food
and' liquor store houses.
