# Varsity Nine Begins Practice
## Trial Tilts Slated With Winter League Teams 
### 
Taking advantage of favorable
weather conditions, Stanford's var
sity baseball squad is fast whipping
into shape for its 1938 campaign,
scheduled to open around Feb, 15.
A game with the Gennealy Seals
tentatively lined up for tomorrow
afternoon will launch the Indian
practice season with teams in the
San Francisco Winter League.
With Catcher Leo Heagerty,
Pitcher Jack Weiershauser, First
baseman Red Holman and Third
Sacker Leonard Linde the only reg
ulars gone from last year's team and
capable replacements available for
them, Coach Harry Wolter expects
to have a successful season on the
diamond.
Fighting for the spot left vacant
at first base by Red Holman are
Jim Graham and John Livermore.
At second base veteran Dick Tam
returns, backed up by By West.
Captain George Farrell will hold
down the shortstop position and
either Pete Mac Arthur or Dale Rei
mer at third base, according to pres
ent plans.
Leo Heagerty v/ill be a hard man
to replace behind the plate, but
Oliver Jamison, a transfer from
Sacramento J. C., is showing much
promise and will probably get the
starting call. .
"Spike" Furman and Joey Grif
fin will form the nucleus of the
pitching staff with Tom Killefer and
Glenn Hamilton available for oc
casional mound duty. Last year's
regular outfield consists of Jimm>
Coffis, Wally La Franchi, Killefer
Bob Matthews, Dick Hanna, and
Norm Juney, a promising sopho
more.
