## Ten-Week Good Will Marathon 
### 
TOMORROW, Stanford's two luckiest men
will leave school, not to return till Spring
Quarter. For ten weeks they will travel from
university to university, heading back east
through Chicago to Montreal, then south
through New England and New York, to south
ern schools. The trip ends at U.S.C. on March
18.
Carl Diesenroth and Gerald Marcus, the
Farm's emissaries on the year's most ambitious
debate trip, do not question the amount of their
luck. Enthusiastic, they already anticipate high
points of the tour.
Most exciting will be a decision debate with
McGill University in Montreal, Marcus believes.
There, they will argue that the C.1.0. is not
detrimental to labor, before an audience that
will be overwhelmingly anti-union.
Most enjoyable according to Deisenroth will
be a week in New York, with the one debate
coming at the first of the week.
Some of the 14 debates and discussions will
be broadcast, the subject matter for all of
them will be timely. But more than the chance
to debate, the two men welcome the oppor
tunity to back off and put their own school in

perspective. Visiting the best universities in
the country, with Harvard, Yale, and Chicago
as samples, they want to find how problems that
vex Stanford are handled elsewhere.
"There has been talk of an international
house here," Marcus says, "I'd like to know how
well such halls have solved the exchange stu
dent's living problems at other schools."
Sorority systems will come under the debat
er's especial scrutiny since Roble's abortive
revolt of last week, and because Marcus is
chairman of Stanford's Peace Day program, he
will search for new means of making this year's
exercises more effective.
Not all benefit of the trip will come to the
students making it. To the University will come
much favorable publicity, comparable to that
gained from the trans-Atlantic debate with Uni
versity of Edinburgh last year.
Both men, however, think the experience will
be worth missing a quarter of school. The
cost to Marcus will be a heavy Spring Quarter
program; Deisenroth will come back Summer
Quarter, will miss graduating with his class.
But, for value received, both to the Univer
sity and to its emissaries, that's not such a high
price.—L. L.

Both men, however, think the experience will
be worth missing a quarter of school. The
cost to Marcus will be a heavy Spring Quarter
program; Deisenroth will come back Summer
Quarter, will miss graduating with his class.
But, for value received, both to the Univer
sity and to its emissaries, that's not such a high
price.—L. L.
TOMORROW, Stanford's two luckiest men
will leave school, not to return till Spring
Quarter. For ten weeks they will travel from
university to university, heading back east
through Chicago to Montreal, then south
through New England and New York, to south
ern schools. The trip ends at U.S.C. on March
18.
Carl Diesenroth and Gerald Marcus, the
Farm's emissaries on the year's most ambitious
debate trip, do not question the amount of their
luck. Enthusiastic, they already anticipate high
points of the tour.
Most exciting will be a decision debate with
McGill University in Montreal, Marcus believes.
There, they will argue that the C.1.0. is not
detrimental to labor, before an audience that
will be overwhelmingly anti-union.
Most enjoyable according to Deisenroth will
be a week in New York, with the one debate
coming at the first of the week.
Some of the 14 debates and discussions will
be broadcast, the subject matter for all of
them will be timely. But more than the chance
to debate, the two men welcome the oppor
tunity to back off and put their own school in

perspective. Visiting the best universities in
the country, with Harvard, Yale, and Chicago
as samples, they want to find how problems that
vex Stanford are handled elsewhere.
"There has been talk of an international
house here," Marcus says, "I'd like to know how
well such halls have solved the exchange stu
dent's living problems at other schools."
Sorority systems will come under the debat
er's especial scrutiny since Roble's abortive
revolt of last week, and because Marcus is
chairman of Stanford's Peace Day program, he
will search for new means of making this year's
exercises more effective.
Not all benefit of the trip will come to the
students making it. To the University will come
much favorable publicity, comparable to that
gained from the trans-Atlantic debate with Uni
versity of Edinburgh last year.
Both men, however, think the experience will
be worth missing a quarter of school. The
cost to Marcus will be a heavy Spring Quarter
program; Deisenroth will come back Summer
Quarter, will miss graduating with his class.
But, for value received, both to the Univer
sity and to its emissaries, that's not such a high
price.—L. L.
