# Two for the Price of One

ONE of the Stanford Administration's tradi
tional worries is the pitifully inadequate
provision for housing the Farm's thousand-odd
graduate students.
Other, newer causes for worry are the ob
stacles which continually thwart University
efforts to assimilate the growing number of
foreign students.
That these problems are closely related long
has been obvious to a wide-awake Administra
tion which has considered several solutions,
found none of them to be practicable without
heavy financial backing.
Pet hope of Dean Mary Yost is the eventual
construction of a large graduate dormitory built
in the shape of an H with one wing reserved
for women and the other for men. The connect
ing wing would be devoted to community rooms
for both sexes.
Still a dream, such a building would solve
the existing problems efficiently and quickly.
For, by providing housing for graduates, it
would immediately care for a large percentage
of the foreign students. Furthermore, conges
tion in other dormitories would be relieved,
and place could be found for the undergraduate
members of Stanford's "international society."
Another suggestion is that a faculty couple
with a roomy, comfortable house be delegated
as a sort of reception committee for men and
women from abroad. Put on a half-time basis
and supported by endowment, the hosts would

do everything in their power to help acclimate
these students, who would still be restricted to
present accommodations. The deficiencies in
this system are obvious and, if put into effect,
it probably would not enjoy as much success
as the present A.S.S.U. International Commit
tee, whose several parties have been popu
larly approved.
This leaves, at least in the line of immediate
solutions, only a co-operative International
House of the type outlined in The Daily last
week. Some effort is being made to find a "for
rent" campus home where 25 to 30 students
could live. Of these, five or six would be
American and the rest foreign.
These Americans probably would profit more
than seems likely at first glance. They would
be jerked from the more or less stereotyped
life of campus men and women and would be
given an opportunity to enjoy an almost cos
mopolitan existence on the supposedly rural
Farm.
In addition to this betterment of social life,
they would be thrown into a whirlpool of in
tellectual development. New thoughts and new
languages soon would become familiar and a
better understanding of other nations would
quickly follow.
Stanford admittedly needs housing for its
under-privileged foreign students, and in satis
fying that need, Stanford can drive a wedge into
its graduate-housing problem. That alone is
justification for pushing the plan.â€”J. R.
