# BULL SESSION
## THROUGH THE BAWLOUT WITH LANCE AND LISTERINE 
### 
an energetic young knight of The
Daily court gets tired of scrapping with the
customary punch-drunk dragons, he rides forth to
shatter an editorial lance on paper-backed armor of
the dragon Bawlout. Many a brave warrior has
charged the creature, and seeing his sharpest objec
tives ricochet off harmlessly has limped down the
highway to get linament for the soul. Many a mighty
magician has tried to cast a spell on it with a mystic
dependent clause, and has gotten his journalistic beard
singed by its fiery breath.
The Bawlout, it seems, will be with us always, and
will go on exposing the tender flowers of grade points
to the merciless light of publicity. It is one of those
legal crimes like the sales tax, speed limits and Union
prices. There is no point in wasting ammunition on it.
But at least we can do one or two things to make it
less of a spot on the University's shirt front.

Of course the ideal thing to do would be to include
in the list of. the faculty a few meaty statements about
the best way to get a grade out of each man. And
another good bet would be to add a few notes on dis
position after each girl's name. But these are idle
dreams that will materialize only in the fulness of a
very full time.
One thing we can do now is calculate Bawlout
averages on the same basis as transcript averages. At
present each student is the subject of an involved
mass of figures that can be interpreted only by a
trained accountant. The plans works something like
this. For each grade of C the Bawlout graciously
starts you from scratch giving no grade points per
unit. But the neat record that the University mails
to you generously gives two points per unit.

r JPHE same rule applies to higher and lower grades,
except that at some undetermined point square
root and differential calculus enter. The whole equa
sion aproaches expulsion as a limit.
Things wouldn't be bad if we were given a handy
formula for converting one average into the other.
Something like the centigrade-fahrenheit ratio would
help. A math major reports that if you divide one
figure into the other, multiply by the square root of
minus one and add in the registrar's telephone num
ber a fairly accurate result is obtainable. But that's
a bit complicated.
♦ * * *
Of course, the situation isn't particularly earth
shaking. Men manage to get diplomas under it, and
no nervous breakdowns are directly attributable to
it. But in these troubled times it is upsetting to find
that even our University is inconsistent and uncertain.
It is little things like this that shake our faith.
And the Bawlout way of figuring averages is like
all the rest of that depressing bulletin. It is incon
sistent with the University. But the dragon Bawlout
will continue with us. All we can ask is that he get
;«»iiu• moiilhw »;.h and sweeten up 11is fiery breath.
