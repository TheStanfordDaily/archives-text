# GOIN' MY WAY
## A 						CBS SMELL 
### 
My hat is off to the CBS. Last Saturday after
noon they aired from their Hollywood studios the
first Western program of its famed Swing Session.
With all the marvelous musical talent that is centered
around Los Angeles, the CBS did an unparalleled job
of hutching.
In the first place, they should have never given the
position of M.C. to Paul Whiteman, who instead of
being a lift to swing music, is an absolute dead weight.
It is true that at one time or another most all of to
day's leading musicians were with "Oom Paul," but
at present Whiteman is but a glorified brass band
leader, greatly outshone by Fred Waring and his crew.
Secondly, the program showed an obvious lack of
adequate preparation. No provision was made for
any special arrangements other than what Whiteman
has been playing night after night at the Coconut
Grove; there was no rhythm or rhyme to the way the
turies or the artists were presented.
Standouts on the mediocre airing were Louis Arm
strong's trumpeting; the Raymond Scott Quintet, Jack
Teagarden's singing; Cleo Brown's work on the piano
and vocals, and very, very obvious, the out-of-tune
saxes in the Whiteman method.
* * * *
Omissions were Fats Waller, Stuff Smith (remem
ber, "I'se A'Muggin?") and his fiddle; Vida Musso and
his tenor sax (see especially the tenor work on the
second side of Goodman's "Sing Sing Sing"); Connie
Boswell's singing. All of them were in and around
Hollywood at the time of the broadcast.
I hope that when you hear some musician go into
an ecstacy of praise over some jam session which he
has witnessed, you won't wrinkle your nose in disgust
and say in that certain tone which is reserved for the
rushing system and the double bills, "Oh, that," be
cause you remembered this last swing session.
I'll agree with you. It certainly smelled.
