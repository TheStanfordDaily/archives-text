# Dupuy, Eliot Book Analyses Future War
## 
### 
Indispensable for political know
italls and bar-room bull-sessioner,
Dupuy and Eliot's just published
"If War Conies," presents a sane
analysis of the probable paths fu
ture aggression will take.
Calmly and without hysteria—the
use of the word "If" in the title in
preference to "When' shows
the authors discuss the various
forces in the world today which are
making for war, the problems from
which war may be expected to arise,
and the ways in which war may be
expected to affect each nation in the
world.
Section by section—tanks, air
craft, naval vessels, gas—the auth
ors survey the advances that have
been made, and the various factors
which make extensive use of these
armaments impractical.
Tanks, for instance, impose a
terrific hardship on their crews,
and furthermore can only be used

on comparatively
smooth terrain.
Aircraft are re
stricted in effect
iveness because
they must come
down, and con
sequently their
bombing radius
is never greater
than 500 miles.
Submarines are

impractical for everything but de
struction of commerce, and are ex
tremely vulnerable to attack.
Only in their discussion of gas
does the authors' bland rationaliza
tion break down, no amount of so
phistry being quite able to explain
away that lingering scourge.
Refreshingly free from the
"when" psychology which seems to
have invaded the press and mind
of the world, "If War Comes" is a
handy guide-book to Armageddon.
