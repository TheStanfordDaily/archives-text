# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford is reputed to have one of
the most worthy records of any
school for student participation in
sports. Yet Stanford's athletic fa
cilities do not include provisions
for one of the increasingly import
ant sports practiced in America —
handball.
Handball offers a maximum of all
around exercise in a minimum of
time. The cost of the game to the
participant is almost negligible
when compared with most other
sports. Gloves, a ball, and the usual
gym outfit are all that are required.
Nor is it necessary to hunt up a
bunch of players as in football or
basketball. Two, three, or four can
play the game with equal enjoy-*-
ment.
By the game, handball, I do not
mean the makeshift aiTangement
which passes under that name here.
Handball, as it is played in a ma
jority of universities, uses a small,
solid, rubber ball on a "box" court.
This court is of regulation propor
tions, high, four-walled, and con
structed of wood.
It is true, these courts are rather
expensive to construct. Yet many
colleges smaller and less affluent
than Stanford have seen fit to build
them as an integral part of their
athletic program. Modern high
schools have out-door courts that
would put Stanford's to shame.
Handball's rising popularity may be
guaged by the growing number of
courts in Y.M.C.A.'s and men's
clubs all over the country. Inter
collegiate competition may be found
among the Eastern schools.
I hope by this letter I have given
a worthwhile suggestion. Its ac
ceptance would prove a boon to a
large number of students.
