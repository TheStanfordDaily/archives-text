# Council Releases Late Leave Quota
## 
### 
Confusion over extra late leaves
granted to women in activities has
caused Women's Conference to an
nounce again the late leave schedule,
as passed during the last year.
At present all women engaged in
dramatics other than freshmen are
allowed one extra 12 o'clock per pro
duction for dress rehearsal. This
applies to crew as well as cast.
Freshmen women are allowed one
extra 12 o'clock and two extra 2:3o's.
All other late leaves taken must
count on the individual quota.
Daily late leaves remain as fol
lows: One 1:30 a week for night edi
tors and one 12 for copy editors.
Women on rest schedule must ob
serve a curtailment of late leaves,
according to yesterday's Conference
report. They may take only one
12:30 a week on Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday, unless special permission is
granted by the doctor.
