# 'Extremists' Caused Asia War: Carter
## Nippon Officers Started Conflict, Secretary Of I. P. R. Declares 
### 
"Extremist" junior officers in the
Japanese army in North China, act
ting without the knowledge or sup
port of their superiors, provoked
"Japan's War in China despite the
wishes of the Tokio cabinet and
general staff.
.Thus Edward C. Carter, Secre
tary General of the Institute of Pa
cific Relations, explained the pres
ent Sino-Japanese conflict to an au
dience of nearly 1700 Stanford stu
dents, faculty members, and Palo
Alto citizens in the Memorial Hall
auditorium last night.
'Needless War'
By carrying out night maneuvers
early last July near important Chi
nese railway junctions in the Peiping
area, these officers felt certain that
Chinese troops would resist, and
cause an "incident" necessitating
saving Japan's "national honoi',"
Carter said.
"Hot-headed and insulting young
officers have plunged the Far East
into a needless, costly and wasteful
war," he emphasized.
Prior to the July 7 "incident," the
Japanese cabinet and general staff
were co-operating in efforts to re
move such officers from North
China and to moderate army policy
there, Carter indicated.
Officers' Interests
The subsequent "night maneu
vers" in Peiping-Tientsin area, and
the later airport "incident" preced
ing the Japanese navy's bombard
ment of Shanghai, were in Cartel - 's
opinion "two more historic instances
of the instinct for survival. It was
quite natural for these officers to get
violent."
Warning that Americans must try
to "immunize themselves to Japa
nese and Chinese propaganda," the
head of the Pacific l-elations institute
said that the opinions of large num
bers of sincere, intelligent, high
place Japanese are guided by two
trends of thought, that:
1. "If China defends her own ter
ritory that is aggression against
Japan."
2. "If Japan invades Chinese ter
ritory, that is self-defense in the
eyes of the Japanese people.
Nipponese Error
Japanese, both in North China and
in Shanghai, were "surprised when
Chinese would not lie down under
attack," Carter said, adding that
"their very great error was in as
suming that China would not fight."
Present Chinese unity is a com
bination of upholding ancient cul
tural values, mixed with "a modern,
rather terrifying type of national
ism," Carter said. Conceding Ja
pan's military superiority for the
moment, many Chinese, he asserted,
arc guided by a fatalistic view that
they "can out-die the Japanese un
til they are driven out."
Sees Long War
China, believing that it is fighting
"a war of liberation," is preparing
to continue the war indefinitely,
Carter predicted. In the end, peace
will be reached only by a return to
influence of groups within both
Japan and China believing in mod-r
oration and economic co-operation,
he emphasized.
"Japan should have its place in
the sun, but the people of the world
believe that that sun should shine
on all mankind and not only on the
Japanese empire," Mr. Carter con
cluded.
Mr. Carter was introduced by Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson, head of the
history department and chairman of
the University Committee on Pub
lic Exercises, which sponsored the
lecture.

Present Chinese unity is a com
bination of upholding ancient cul
tural values, mixed with "a modern,
rather terrifying type of national
ism," Carter said. Conceding Ja
pan's military superiority for the
moment, many Chinese, he asserted,
arc guided by a fatalistic view that
they "can out-die the Japanese un
til they are driven out."
Sees Long War
China, believing that it is fighting
"a war of liberation," is preparing
to continue the war indefinitely,
Carter predicted. In the end, peace
will be reached only by a return to
influence of groups within both
Japan and China believing in mod-r
oration and economic co-operation,
he emphasized.
"Japan should have its place in
the sun, but the people of the world
believe that that sun should shine
on all mankind and not only on the

"Extremist" junior officers in the
Japanese army in North China, act
ting without the knowledge or sup
port of their superiors, provoked
"Japan's War in China despite the
wishes of the Tokio cabinet and

.Thus Edward C. Carter, Secre
tary General of the Institute of Pa
cific Relations, explained the pres
ent Sino-Japanese conflict to an au

Alto citizens in the Memorial Hall
auditorium last night.
'Needless War'
By carrying out night maneuvers
early last July near important Chi
nese railway junctions in the Peiping
area, these officers felt certain that
Chinese troops would resist, and
cause an "incident" necessitating
saving Japan's "national honoi',"
Carter said.
"Hot-headed and insulting young
officers have plunged the Far East
into a needless, costly and wasteful
war," he emphasized.
Prior to the July 7 "incident," the
Japanese cabinet and general staff
were co-operating in efforts to re
move such officers from North
China and to moderate army policy
there, Carter indicated.
Officers' Interests
The subsequent "night maneu
vers" in Peiping-Tientsin area, and
the later airport "incident" preced
ing the Japanese navy's bombard
ment of Shanghai, were in Cartel - 's
opinion "two more historic instances
of the instinct for survival. It was
quite natural for these officers to get
violent."
Warning that Americans must try
to "immunize themselves to Japa
nese and Chinese propaganda," the
head of the Pacific l-elations institute
said that the opinions of large num
bers of sincere, intelligent, high
place Japanese are guided by two
trends of thought, that:
1. "If China defends her own ter
ritory that is aggression against
Japan."
2. "If Japan invades Chinese ter
ritory, that is self-defense in the
eyes of the Japanese people.
Nipponese Error
Japanese, both in North China and
in Shanghai, were "surprised when
Chinese would not lie down under
attack," Carter said, adding that
"their very great error was in as
suming that China would not fight."
