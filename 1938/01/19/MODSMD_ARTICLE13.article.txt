### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 18 (UP).—G-men
moving with secrecy unusual even
for them, sought tonight to clinch
their case against Peter Anders by
discovering the body of Charles S.
Ross, the elderly valentine manu
facturer whom Anders confessed
slaying.
A rumor here was that Hoover or
other federal men had taken Anders
to Tacoma, Wash., to be viewed by
the parents of Charles Mattson, the
boy who was kidnaped from his
home there in December, 1936. Pub
lished photographs of Anders bore
resemblance to the artist's recon
struction of the Mattson kidnap
slayer.
Activity in the Chicago-Rockford
area seemed to center around search
for the body of Ross. Without it
the government would have diffi
culty prosecuting Anders, despite
the latter's confession.
Search also was believed being
conducted for the body of the ac
complice whom Anders confessed
killing after the ransom had been
collected.
