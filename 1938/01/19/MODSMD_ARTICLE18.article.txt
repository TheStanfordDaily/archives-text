# PAINTOURIST DAUBS Watercolors Record Trip
## 
### 
Some people record their vacation
trips by sending picture postcards.
But Daniel M. Mendelowitz, Stan
ford instructor in graphic art, has 30
water color paintings to show for
his vacation.
H etook all of fall quarter and
drove 7000 miles, visiting the South
west, Mexico, the Old South, and
New York City.
It was across Nevada toward
Utah that Mr. Mendelowitz first
pointed his radiator cap. He foifrid
the old mining towns quite paint
able, with their ancient red brick
town halls and lodge buildings.
Twice, however, rainstorms and
gusty wind blurred his watercolors
and kept him from painting the
scenes.
At Utah's Bryce Canyon, he was
impressed but found it "a little too
grand to provide subject matter for
anything but calendars and post
cards."

country. Mr. Mendelowitz found the
Vermillion Cliff and Painted Desert
very beautiful and dramatic.
The artist liked New Mexico so
well that it is now his favorite state,
particularly Mon Kopi Pueblo, first
Indian village in America, and Taos,
widely known artists' colony.
All the houses of the Indians and
Mexicans there were colored just
the same as the landscape. Al
though he found Taos "not tuo arty,'
Mr. Mendelowitz described it as
paintable and impressing. He en
joyed particularly painting the
cloud effects. Even when the roads
were covered with water he liked
New Mexico.
It was at Taxco, Mexico, that Mr.
Mendelowitz did most of his water
colors. He found the policemen of
the painters' resort one of its most
colorful features.
"Except on Sundays they never
wear uniforms or shoes," he said.
"And while I was there they were
spending much of their lime racing
around town in the limousine of a
rich American who had been mur
dered.
Mexico may be colorful, thinks the
instructor, but the United States is
more varied and has been painted
less. He prefers painting in this
country. At Corpus Christi, Texas,
he spent some time on the industrial
scenes, the coal bunkers.
The rainy season was on when he
visited the "nostalgic" Deep South
and painted the Negroes and the
walnut barns.
Seven weeks in New York com
pleted the paintourist's busy fall
quarter. There he spent much of his
time in the Museum of Modern Art,
doing research work in the library
and selecting movies for his course
on the motion picture.
Of his 30 paintings, three were
submitted to the American Water
color Show in New York, four at
Weyhe Gallery in New York, and
some of the others at Western
shows. They probably will be on
exhibit on the Stanford campus
around the end of winter quarter.

At Utah's Bryce Canyon, he was

country. Mr. Mendelowitz found the
Vermillion Cliff and Painted Desert
very beautiful and dramatic.
The artist liked New Mexico so
well that it is now his favorite state,
particularly Mon Kopi Pueblo, first
Indian village in America, and Taos,
widely known artists' colony.
All the houses of the Indians and
Mexicans there were colored just
the same as the landscape. Al
though he found Taos "not tuo arty,'
Mr. Mendelowitz described it as
paintable and impressing. He en
joyed particularly painting the
cloud effects. Even when the roads
were covered with water he liked
New Mexico.
It was at Taxco, Mexico, that Mr.
Mendelowitz did most of his water
colors. He found the policemen of
the painters' resort one of its most
colorful features.
"Except on Sundays they never
wear uniforms or shoes," he said.
"And while I was there they were
spending much of their lime racing
around town in the limousine of a
rich American who had been mur

Mexico may be colorful, thinks the
instructor, but the United States is
more varied and has been painted
less. He prefers painting in this
country. At Corpus Christi, Texas,
he spent some time on the industrial
scenes, the coal bunkers.
The rainy season was on when he
visited the "nostalgic" Deep South
and painted the Negroes and the
walnut barns.
Seven weeks in New York com
pleted the paintourist's busy fall
quarter. There he spent much of his
time in the Museum of Modern Art,
doing research work in the library
and selecting movies for his course
on the motion picture.
Of his 30 paintings, three were
submitted to the American Water
color Show in New York, four at
Weyhe Gallery in New York, and
some of the others at Western
shows. They probably will be on
exhibit on the Stanford campus
around the end of winter quarter.
Some people record their vacation
trips by sending picture postcards.
But Daniel M. Mendelowitz, Stan
ford instructor in graphic art, has 30
water color paintings to show for
his vacation.
H etook all of fall quarter and
drove 7000 miles, visiting the South
west, Mexico, the Old South, and
New York City.
It was across Nevada toward
Utah that Mr. Mendelowitz first
pointed his radiator cap. He foifrid
the old mining towns quite paint
able, with their ancient red brick
town halls and lodge buildings.
Twice, however, rainstorms and
gusty wind blurred his watercolors
