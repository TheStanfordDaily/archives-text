KILGORE. Tex., Jan. 18 (UP). -
Home town firemen bearing asbestos
suits edged in on a blazing oil well
in the center of the business district
early today and extinguished it
while national guardsmen restrained
an excited crowd of onlookers.
Several buildings were destroyed
at a loss of more than $130,000; bil
lowing flames were reaching 200
feet into the air and a worse dis
aster was threatening when Fire
Chief Jess Pool and his men took
over the fight.
