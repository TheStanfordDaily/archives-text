Political Battle
The plot of "The Governor's Wife"
centers around a battle between the
liberal and conservative political
parties in a small Spanish town. A
theatrical troupe with a rather shady
reputation arrives for the town
fiesta, and becomes the center of
the campaign mud-slinging.
The conservatives want to bar
the show, while the liberal Governor
orders its opening. The Governor's
wife, who really wears the pants in
the family, sides with the conserva
tive element, and a battle royal en
sues.
Toreador Decides
The showdown occurs at the bull
fight which climaxes the fiesta. The
victorious toreador declares him
self a liberal, and that settles the
matter.
I The troupe is allowed to give its
i show, and the play ends in the riot
jof a Spanish holiday. All the color
j and romance of the Iberian penin
| sula are brought to life in the Stan
ford production of "The Governor's
Wife," according to Director H.
Miles Heberer. Costumes and
scenery are exceptionally pi c
turesque.
Tickets for all performances arc
!40 cents. They are on sale during
j the day in Room 202 Memorial Hall
i and at the door of the Little Theater
before each performance.
