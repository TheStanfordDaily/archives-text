# GIRL DIES AS JULIET
## 
### 
DINUBA, Jan. 18 (UP). â€” White
friends of his own race kept Sam
Kurihara hidden today during the
funeral of his American sweetheai't
who, like Juliet, took poison because
she thought her lover was dead,
Americans of this community, where
the races meet but do not mingle,
were talking vengefully about his
having dared to love a girl who was
denied him by law and by caste.
