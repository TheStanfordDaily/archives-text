# Women Riders Plan Tryouts Next Saturday
## 
### 
Moonlight horseback trips, a
spring gymkhana, and Sunday
morning breakfast rides are a few
of the activities planned this year
by the Stanford Women's Riding
Club, which will have tryouts for
new members Saturday afternoon
at 3 o'clock at the Menlo Circus
Club.
Tryouts will be fairly simple.
There will be no jumpingâ€”just seat
and hand, walk, trot, and canter,
according to Maltha Hall, presi
dent of the club, who asks that girls
intending to try out call her today at
the Gamma Phi house, P.A. 5189,
and leave their names, in order that
enough horses may be reserved.
Transportation may also be ar
ranged.
The Menlo Circus Club is situated
on P#rk Lane, turning left from
State Highway 101 after leaving
Menlo Park. There is no charge for
tryouts.
