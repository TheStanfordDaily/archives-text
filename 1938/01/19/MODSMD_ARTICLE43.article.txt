BRICK MORSE BELITTLES
CARD CINDER STARS
I see where Brick Morse, Cal's
perennial sophomore, doesn't believe
ail he hears.
At least he doesn't believe it when
it comes from the lips of Dink Tem
pleton, Stanford's great track coach.
A few weeks ago Dink came
on ( with a few bold statements
that Cardinal trackmen were go
ing out after some records this
season. Several days ago Cal's
number one enthusiast lit into
tlicse Templeton predictions and
substituted a few of bis own.
Morse claims that Ray Malott will
not capture the world's record in the
440 this season. The Berkeley sage
asserts that Archie Williams is the
greatest quarter miler in the world
today and that, all hough he is in
eligible, he is still at Cal and will
be working out with Brutus Hamil
ton's team.
MORSE SAYS ARCHIE
WILL OUTRUN RAY
Morse claims that the chocolate
charger will break the record if
anybody does, so it won't do Malott
much good to get down to 46 flat
or better. I just thought I'd let you
know how everything stands, Ray,
so you won't break your neck try
ing to shatter that mark.
The aging soph also claims that
Ed Burrows will not get down to
4:12 in the mile this year, as Dink
thinks he will. Again Brick
brings in an ineligible man as bis
choice . . . Cecil Cole, the greatest
distance runner on the Pacific
Coast. Cole won't be eligible this
year but will probably do a little
running on the side.
Incidentally( while we're talking
about Cole, there's an interesting
little item in that mighty of the
college dailies, the Daily Califor
nian. It tells how Cole finally
chose U.C. as his university, because
he liked Cal the best. We, in the
know, say looey.
COLE INCIDENT PROVES
OLD SCHOLASTIC ADAGE
If they'd take the trouble to ask
Cole himself, the raven-thatched
runner would tell the denizens of
Razzberry Canyon that he had no
choice in the matter. He did not
have the grades to get into Stan
ford, SO, he went to Cal. The same
thing happened a few years ago
when hurdler Lcroy Kirkpatrick
went to U.S.C.
The Cole incident only goes to
strengthen the old adage, "When
they can't get into Stanford, they
go to Cal." Incidentally, I'd like
to see liob Herwig's IQ. His total
score should be fairly interesting.
Morse doesn't doubt that Stan
ford's Jack Lippman will get over
50 feet in the shot, but he claims
they've got a beefy boy at Berkeley
who will take Lippman to the
cleaners.
He also doesn't question Temple
ton's statement that Russ Wulf will
go (3 foot 8 inches in the high jump,
but hastens to add that Cal wil
have somebody to give Russ plenty
of competition.
DAILY CAL HAVING FUN
WITH LEAGUE STANDINGS
The Daily Cal is having its mea
ger fun with the basketball situa
tion at the present time. They print
the standings, showing Cal in top
place, in 10 point boldface caps, and
Stanford in third place, in 6 point
type.
The Bears had better celebrate
while they may, because there are
only two more U.C.L.A. games on
their calendar. When the Trojans
and the Indians start to work on
Cal, it's going to be anything but
amusing from a blue and gold point
of view.
They also mention that Stanford
beat Duquesne 92-27, and Duquesne
beat Pitt, 27-25, and yet Stanford
lost to U.S.C.. and that Pitt had one
of the three best football teams in
the country.
Please tell me, Bears, what has all
that got to do with the price of
beans in Boston?â€” Gene Gear.
