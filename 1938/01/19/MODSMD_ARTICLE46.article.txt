# Indian Rugbymen Renew Practice
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby squads returned
to the practice field yesterday after
noon following a day of idleness to
prepare for a tougher week-end of
rugby than they had last week.
The Indian varsity will clash Sat
urday afternoon at Stanford with
the University Club which is one of
the strongest teams in the California
Rugby Union. The Club should
give the Indians a tougher struggle
than the Argonauts did last week
in losing, 27-0.
The junior varsity game Satur
day will be with either the Uni
versity Club second team or San
Jose State and will be announced
later. In the morning Stanford's
freshman fifteen is scheduled to
meet the S.F.U. frosh.
Coach Jim YVylie is working this
week on the passing attack in the
backfield and the defense in the for
ward line, which were not up to par
in last week's contests. The backs
showed plenty of speed and de
ception Saturday but lacked ac
curacy in their passing.
