## GENE GEAR, Sports Editor Bunn Drills Indian Cagers Basketballers Concentrate On Defense Victory Over California Necessary To Win Coast Conference 
### 
No specific preparation for the
Bears of California, but intensive
work on defense principles so ob
viously lacking against U.S.C. was
handed the basketball varsity yes
terday by Coach John Bunn.
The practice session was topped
off with a drill on offensive play. A
Stanford victory Friday night at
Berkeley will be virtually essential
to winning the coast championship
for the third year, and the Indians
will be pointing to redeem them
selves for Saturday's loss to Troy.
Luisetti Returns
Hank Luisetti returned to prac
tice after missing Monday's work
out with a cold, but he engaged in
only a light practice consisting
mainly of shooting.
California, undefeated in two
conference contests, will be out to
stave off the Cardinals. A win for
the Bears would establish them as
a dangerous contender for the title,
while it would also put Stanford in
a position from which recovery
would be very difficult.
Three-way Tie
On the other hand, a Stanford
triumph according to all form
charts would throw the conference
into a three-way tie between Cal,
U.S.C. and Stanford, at two wins
and a loss apiece.
In other words, it behooves Coach
John Bunn and his boys to win this
one, or else. Cal, without a danger
ous score like Captain Ray Balsley
of last year, has been getting along
with a flock of ordinary shots, most
notable of which is a lad named Ed
Dougery. The gang got together
enough points against U.C.L.A. last
week-end in Los Angeles to win
both games, one by two points and
the other by five.
Although a seven-point margin in
two games over the team that can't
seem to get out of the well is not
too impressive, the Bears must
nonetheless be given consideration.
