# Varsity Tanksters Favored To Defeat Frosh Saturday
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
One of two opportunities to watch
Stanford swimming teams in action
this quarter will be afforded Satur
day as the freshmen and varsity
meet in their annual competition
in* Enema Pools.
The only other local meet before
spring quarter will be" the inter
class affair. The Cardinals will
travel to Los Angeles later in the
term to meet U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. on
successive days.
Frosh Have Stars
While the Coast champion varsity
is favored to win easily, the frosh
have developed some outstanding
prospects, who should win at least
three events. Bill Weeden, yearling
back-stroker, has established him
self as the fastest upside-down pad
dler who ever hit the Farm.
Weeden has yet to swim as a
Stanford competitor, but he has al
ready smashed the 100-yard back
stroke records of the Coast, the Uni
versity and Encina Pools. Swim
ming against time last week, Weed
en whacked 1.2 seconds off the old
mark. He will swim Saturday
against Hal Weatherbe, Big Meet
winner last spring in the 150-yard
event.
Vitousek Faces Titlist
Roy Vitousek, winner of the frosh
all-around championship, will go
against Dick Clarke in the 50-yard
free-style and against Johnny
Brahtz in the 100. Clarke is the
present holder of the pool 50-yard
record.
The other frosh victory hope will
be in the 400-yard relay. The med
ley relay looks like a varsity cinch
with Don Towne back again. The
breast stroke also should be all var-

sity. Towne, Bill Hatch, and Lloyd
Wilson should finish in that order.
Roy Winkleman will handle the
diving responsibilities without too
much difficulty. Don Stine of the
freshmen and Herb Wooley are due
to fight for second and third. Win
Needham and Capt. Dave Rider
should finish one-two in both the
220 and 440 with Frosh Charles Wi
per tagging them in both events if
he enters.
