## 
### 
When Stanford's frosh basketball
team takes the Pavilion floor to
night at 7:30 o'clock against San
Mateo Junior College, it is going to
have a hard time recognizing itself.
After a tremendous shakeup which
affected practically the whole team.
Coach Wytze Gorter produces al
most an entire new starting line-up. \
Of the Papoose quintet that has
started every game to date, only
Forward Don Williams remains. Bill
Marshall, the best shot on the team
moves up from the second string to
the forward spot opposite Williams.
Don Burness hafe been shifted from
guard to center and will start at the
pivotp osition. Bill Niccolls ad
vances from reserve guard to a
starting post, teaming with Kenny
Davidson, a made-over forward.
Bill Masters, erstwhile starting
forward, has been shifted to guard
and should see plenty of action.
Coach Gorter believes that his
new combination possesses what his
other team didn't have — namely,
speed, hustle and shooting ability.
If its defense can hold up he is con
fident that the team will be able to
hold its own. However, he is not
expecting too much tonight, as the
players are likely not to be accli
mated to their new positions.
San Mateo invades the Farm with

a fast, alert and aggressive team
that will be favored over the year
lings. Nevertheless, the frosh are
determined to make up for their
miserable showings of the past
week-end and should make the go
ing plenty hot for the Jaysees.
Admission will be free.
