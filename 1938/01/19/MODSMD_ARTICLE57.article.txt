EDUCATION at Stanford, we have just been
informed, is inferior to that offered by the
state.
This bit of wisdom from editor John Burd of
the Daily Californian, as he trotted through the
third issue of his volume early this week, comes
as that publication's periodic dig which makes
life worth living on the Farm.
Burd tucked his bit between the paragraphs
of a pick-up editorial from The Stanford Daily
concerning the proposed Bryn Mawr plan under
v/hich parents would be given the opportunity
to help close the gap between the cost of an
education and the price which students pay
lor it.
He says: "This proposition will probably be
viewed with cynical amusement by Califor
nians accustomed to free tuition at state ex
pense. There is evident irony in this situation
where parents will be requested to add an
honorarium to the $342 (it's $345, Burdie) per
annum they must now pay for an education
inferior to that offered by the state."
Editor Burd's generalization concerning the
inferiority of Stanford education to that of the

state is neither a good generalization, in good
taste, nor in good sense.
Education is an intangible commodity. Which
universities offer most of it, is a question no
one, not even the Daily Californian editor, can
hope to answer intelligently. Both Stanford
and California rank high, but the country's best
educators would squirm like poisoned pups be
fore they'd put either on top.
Despite the Californian's boast, Stanford's
waiting-list is still long enough to keep the
demand curve for diplomas well off the base
line. And those who plank out the $345 per
year could go to California for exactly nothing,
if they wanted to.
There is no irony in the situation, Mr. Burd.
Certain folks down here on the old Farm still
believe that Stanford offers opportunities for
an education second to none. If they will pay
$345 per year to substantiate that belief, usually
they are sufficiently convinced of this fact to
contribute more if given the opportunity.
There are a lot of things about Stanford that
aren't reckoned in dollars and cents.
And at this writing there is no exodus to Ber
keley to get superior education free.
