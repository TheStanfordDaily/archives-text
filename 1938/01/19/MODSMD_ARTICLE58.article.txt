TODAY Stanford's newest brain-child — the
Wednesday Luncheon Club —will celebrate
its first birthday with a speech by Dr. Henry
Lanz and with ice cream and cookies.
Fathered by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood and moth
ered by a conviction that Stanford social life
is in need of an intellectual prod, the Club
already has reached a position of some signifi
cance.
Goal of Dr. Trueblood in founding the club
was to create a "constant sounding board for
all those with ideas" and to make it possible for
students to meet interesting people from both
on and off the campus.
That this goal is being approached is obvious
to the 60 to 70 men and women who flock to
the cellar of the Women's Clubhouse each week
to hear interesting, and often vital, subjects
discussed.
As the club grows older it may become
larger and more mature, but it will always be

territory. But he added the interesting story of
a new mission to improve Oriental security and
civilization.
Some Chinese believe, he said, that Japan's
government can only become effective if the
Chinese succeed in battering down the Japa
nese army. The story proceeds thus:
At the present time, the Japanese army func

The two organizations are parallel, both deriving
their power to act from the Emperor. Only if
China so succeeds in weakening the army that
the government gains the upper hand can the
non-belligerent element give the country a sane,
peaceful rule.
It's a fine story and just as probable as that of
the Japanese. But it's more interesting as a
sample of rationalizations that always appear
to justify war as a charitable act to save de
mocracy, the race, and civilization.—L. L.
