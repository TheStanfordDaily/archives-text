" \ FORMAL dinner in Japan always consists of 17
rigidly defined courses." With this innocent little
item tucked into the bottom of a column in yester
day's Daily we .stripped off our armor and exposed
ourselves to the arrows and slings of critics. For ob
viously this statement reveals our attitude toward the
game of puss-wants-a-corner our Asiatic friends are
playing in China. Obviously it is a subtle bit of prop
aganda intended to blight the budding flower of in
tellectual integrity at Stanford.
It is ironic that the item which gives local heels a
chance to be Achilles should be a front page filler, a
species of editorial erring daughter presumably banned
forever from The Daily. It was printed with no malice
aforethought. And even a prosecuting attorney would
have a nasty time making something of it. But never
theless it provides an opening for those indoor triple
threat men who specialize in kicking.
* * + *
To (he militantly pro-Chinese the filler is patently
the most vicious sort of Japanese propaganda. There
is a well known principle of sociology which I re
member hearing one depressing morning when I got
a wobbly seat in Econ 75 and couldn't sleep. It holds
that when you know about the habits and intimate de
tails of a people, immediately there blossoms a love
and understanding for its civilization.
No groucher who even pretends to take his work
seriously would miss such a point. Even now our
critics are doubtless making expeditions into sociology
books, and are in hot pursuit of the principle. To
morrow or the next day they will corner it, then they
will fling it in our faces and go home to sharpen their
scissors and wait for it to be printed.
* * + *
r |X) THOSE who use Japanese sympathy as an out
let for a dog-kicking disposition, the filler is ob
viously Chinese propaganda. For, they will say, its
subtle wording is fiendishly designed to prejudice all
students against Japan. They will point to the refer
ence to "rigidly defined courses." This is "manifestly
intended to connect J a pin with Registration in the
minds of students. It will associate Japanese culture
with time schedules, prerequisites, and soul searing
interviews with department heads. To the student
"rigidly defined courses" can mean only those into
which dear alma mater jams us. And granted this
assumption, it is impossible to deny that things look
a bit black for any civilization associated with those
courses.
The damage is done, and the axe-wielders' union
is preparing to do us. The word is spoken, and neither
the swearing of Our Editor nor the weeping of our
sweethearts can recall it. There is nothing to do but
prepare for a barrage of catapulting adverbs and
lethal participial clauses.
And, uli Cod, we're fresh out of gas masks.

" \ FORMAL dinner in Japan always consists of 17
rigidly defined courses." With this innocent little
item tucked into the bottom of a column in yester
day's Daily we .stripped off our armor and exposed
ourselves to the arrows and slings of critics. For ob
viously this statement reveals our attitude toward the
game of puss-wants-a-corner our Asiatic friends are
playing in China. Obviously it is a subtle bit of prop
aganda intended to blight the budding flower of in
tellectual integrity at Stanford.
It is ironic that the item which gives local heels a
chance to be Achilles should be a front page filler, a
species of editorial erring daughter presumably banned
forever from The Daily. It was printed with no malice
aforethought. And even a prosecuting attorney would
have a nasty time making something of it. But never
theless it provides an opening for those indoor triple
threat men who specialize in kicking.

To (he militantly pro-Chinese the filler is patently
the most vicious sort of Japanese propaganda. There
is a well known principle of sociology which I re
member hearing one depressing morning when I got
a wobbly seat in Econ 75 and couldn't sleep. It holds
that when you know about the habits and intimate de
tails of a people, immediately there blossoms a love
and understanding for its civilization.
No groucher who even pretends to take his work
seriously would miss such a point. Even now our
critics are doubtless making expeditions into sociology
books, and are in hot pursuit of the principle. To
morrow or the next day they will corner it, then they
will fling it in our faces and go home to sharpen their
scissors and wait for it to be printed.
