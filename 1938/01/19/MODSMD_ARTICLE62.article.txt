# FULL COST FOR EDUCATION

### 
'THHAT Stanford University should adopt the "Bryn
Mawr plan," an arrangement whereby parents
may show their appreciation of the collcge by remit
ting "full cost" of their children's education, is edi
torially proposed by the Stanford Daily.
Says the Daily: "The mechanics of this scheme
hinge around letters couched in very tactful terms,
which call to the parents attention the wide gap which
exists between the cost of an education and the price
which students pay for it."
This plan reportedly has been received with en
thusiasm by student and alumni officials. And well it
might be, for the Daily estimates that if 100 of Stan
ford's 4000 students paid the "full cost" of their edu
cation the equivalent of a million dollar endowment
increase could be obtained.
proposition will probably be viewed with
cynical amusement by Californians accustomed to
free tuition at state expense. There is evident irony
in this situation where parents will be x*equested to
add an honorarium to the $342 per annum they must
now pay for an education inferior to that offered by
the state.
But if properly adapted, there is seemingly no
reason why a refined version of this plan could not be
applied by this University. Parents or students of suf
ficient financial means might by this process relieve
the University of much financial worry and have the
satisfaction of aiding a really great institution.
