# 'One Kopek' Depicts Real Communism
## 
### 
How Communists get that way is
the burden of "One Life, One Ko
pek," Walter Duranty's latest book.

Fresh from the
triumph of having
everyone • believe
him when he
made a flat state
ment — "I Write
As I Please," —
and useci it for
the title of his
autobiography, he
has turned again
to the Russia he

knows so well, and has found there
in the materials for a novel as ex
citing as the best adventure story.
Ivan begins life as companion to
the children of a rich merchant.
When his young master gets in a
drunken brawl, Ivan is blamed for
starting it, and is summarily sent
to Siberia, where he runs up against
a pathological commissar, and be
gin to see that more than a little is
rotten in the state of Russia.
From that point the story mounts
in excitement and suspense as Ivan
escapes from prison, makes his way
back to Russia, meets some revolu
tionaries, and decides to give his
life to the Communist cause. As he
rises ever higher in revolutionary
circles, he grows more and more
ruthless — a ruthlessness arising
originally from personal bitterness,
but soon transformed into the ruth
lessness of power and successful re
volt.
From his colorful tale, written
with an ease which belies the fact
that it is a first novel, Mr. Duranty
draws what is probably the sanest
conclusion regarding the great bulk
of Communist leaders — that their
zeal comes, first, from personal
grievance, and, second, from The
Cause. —A.S.D.
