I don't mind paying $115 for the
tuition, or paying for football games,
or even paying for basketball games.
But I think that when a university
charges for these things they should
give value received.
Last Saturday evening I went to
watch Stanford play U.S.C., at least
I thought I was. To my great dismay
I found that the only seats avail
able were those behind the wooden
backboards. From where I sat I
wasn't able to see either one of the
baskets, and the only way I could
tell what happened was by the ac
tion of the crowd. At least in a
movie I can see what happens.
This fault has been successfully
overcome in the eastern basketball
centers by installing glass back
boards which enable the paying
spectator to see the basket even
when sitting on the wrong side. Ac
cording to reports, the Stanford
team wasn't annoyed by this type
of a backboard.
It is my suggestion that Stanford
adopt these backboards, and get it
self out of the "chisoler" class. There
is an unpleasant name for the tak
ing of money under false pretenses.
