# Minor Sport Recognition Given Skiing
## Excom Waives Action On Proposal Of Aid To Asiatic Students 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
A bright little Swiss named Willie
Meyer last night waded through ev
ery Ex Committee objection to win
minor-sports recognition for his
Alps-bred passion, skiing.
While Ex Committee's approval
will be official only after the Ski
Club has submitted satisfactory
bases for awarding letters and means
for absolving the University from
accident liability, Meyer convinced
the originally-lukewarm committee
members that skiing deserved the
recognition he sought.
"Stanford placed second in com
petition against nine other univer
sities, all of which have given ski
ing minor-sport recognition." the
Ski Club's president told the com
mittee in his quaint Swiss-German
accent.
They Had the Answers
Unlike most Stanford "lobbyists"
who seek subsidies for their pet ac
tivities, Meyer and three other Ski
Club officials anticipated every
question, had an answer ready every
time.
"We'll pay all our own expenses,"
they said.
"Interest is so great we have 300
members, 176 of whom have already
paid their dues," they said.
"We will drive to snow-fields only
if the cars are fully insured and the
University absolved of liability,"
they said.
Gordy Frost advanced the prin
cipal objection. "I've seen these
things spurt, then drop off." he
said, speaking mainly of the Sailing
Club.
Stanford's No. 1 skiier promptly
proved that skiing's appeal is much
wider than sailing's, that the thou
sands of Americans who have paid
$30 and over for ski equipment
aren't liable to drop the sport soon.
An Annoying Problem
Once Internationalist Meyer was
gone, Ex Committee ran smack up
against another problem, the kind
that particularly annoys it—lnterna
tional Affairs.
Chinese and Japanese students
whose universities have been de
stroyed in the war were asking Stan
ford to join other American col
leges in raising $50,000 to help
them.
Because such a request involved
"foreign affairs" and might not be
"impartial," the committeemen de
cided to wait for Dr. Wilbur's advice
before saying yes or no.
"Like the New Deal"
Balked almost half an hour by
that peculiar Ex Committee red
tape known as "precedent." the A. S.
S. U. legislators finally agreed to let
the President's Jolly-up—an infan
tile paralysis benefit—run until 9
o'clock Jan. 27, an hour past the
regular mid-week deadline.
When Ex Committee broke its own
by-law to grant the extension, Phil
Klauber remarked: "We're just like
the New Deal—always breaking
laws."
Other dates were granted to Pi
Phi, Feb. 18; to Theta Delta and
Alpha Delt, Feb. 26.

ing minor-sport recognition." the
Ski Club's president told the com
mittee in his quaint Swiss-German
accent.
They Had the Answers
Unlike most Stanford "lobbyists"
who seek subsidies for their pet ac
tivities, Meyer and three other Ski
Club officials anticipated every
question, had an answer ready every
time.
"We'll pay all our own expenses,"
they said.
"Interest is so great we have 300
members, 176 of whom have already
paid their dues," they said.
"We will drive to snow-fields only
if the cars are fully insured and the
University absolved of liability,"
they said.
Gordy Frost advanced the prin
cipal objection. "I've seen these
things spurt, then drop off." he
said, speaking mainly of the Sailing
Club.
Stanford's No. 1 skiier promptly
proved that skiing's appeal is much
wider than sailing's, that the thou
sands of Americans who have paid
$30 and over for ski equipment
aren't liable to drop the sport soon.
An Annoying Problem
Once Internationalist Meyer was
gone, Ex Committee ran smack up
against another problem, the kind
that particularly annoys it—lnterna
tional Affairs.
Chinese and Japanese students
whose universities have been de
stroyed in the war were asking Stan
ford to join other American col
leges in raising $50,000 to help
them.
Because such a request involved
"foreign affairs" and might not be
"impartial," the committeemen de
cided to wait for Dr. Wilbur's advice
before saying yes or no.
"Like the New Deal"
Balked almost half an hour by
that peculiar Ex Committee red
tape known as "precedent." the A. S.
S. U. legislators finally agreed to let
the President's Jolly-up—an infan
tile paralysis benefit—run until 9
o'clock Jan. 27, an hour past the
regular mid-week deadline.
When Ex Committee broke its own
by-law to grant the extension, Phil
Klauber remarked: "We're just like
the New Deal—always breaking
laws."
Other dates were granted to Pi
Phi, Feb. 18; to Theta Delta and
Alpha Delt, Feb. 26.
A bright little Swiss named Willie
Meyer last night waded through ev
ery Ex Committee objection to win
minor-sports recognition for his
Alps-bred passion, skiing.
While Ex Committee's approval
will be official only after the Ski
Club has submitted satisfactory
bases for awarding letters and means
for absolving the University from
accident liability, Meyer convinced
the originally-lukewarm committee
members that skiing deserved the
recognition he sought.
"Stanford placed second in com
petition against nine other univer
sities, all of which have given ski
ing minor-sport recognition." the
Ski Club's president told the com
mittee in his quaint Swiss-German
accent.
