# Board Denies Protest On 'Hasher Tax'
## Unemployment Reserve Fund Fee To Boost Eating Group Costs 
### 
Campus eating groups were in- |
formed yesterday they must pay j
the long-disputed "hasher tax,"
which will boost house and club
costs an average of $10 a month.
A ruling of the Federal Social
Security Board, delivered to War
ren M. Turner, interfraternity audi
tor, rejects arguments given by In
terfraternity Board against pay
ment of the tax. The ruling is ret
roactive to Jan. 1, last.
More generally known as the un
employment reserve fund tax,
which is designed to provide bene
fits for certain classes of workers
who are involuntarily unemployed,
the "hasher tax" totals 5.7 per cent
of wages.
A California State tax, stepped up
each year, now takes 3.7 per cent of
the entire payroll, the employer
paying 2.7 per cent and the employe
1 per cent. In addition, employer
and employe each must pay a 1 per
cent federal tax.
Interfraternity Board had object
ed to payment of the tax on the
ground that honorary officers are
not paid, and, therefore, should not
be included on employe rolls.
Houses Educational
The Board also contended that
fraternities and sororities are part
of an educational institution, and
thus exempt from the tax under
terms of the Federal Social Secur
ity Act. Since the California act
takes its provisions from the federal
statute, this argument, if upheld,
would have eliminated all payments.
The Social Security Board threw
out the latter argument and ruled
on the first that fraternity, sorority,
and eating club executivies are "of
ficers" under the terms of the Act
regardless of whether they are paid
or are honorary.
Most Groups Exempt
When the exemption first was
claimed, the law provided that only
those organizations having more
than eight employes were required
to pay the tax. Under those pro
visions, a small percentage of the
houses have been ordered to pay
1937 taxes. Most groups were ex
empt.
Now, however, a new provision
sets the exemption at "four or less."
Since all house presidents, mana
gers, and hashers are designated as
"employes," all groups will be
taxed.

Interfraternity Board had object
ed to payment of the tax on the
ground that honorary officers are
not paid, and, therefore, should not
be included on employe rolls.
Houses Educational
The Board also contended that
fraternities and sororities are part
of an educational institution, and
thus exempt from the tax under
terms of the Federal Social Secur
ity Act. Since the California act
takes its provisions from the federal
statute, this argument, if upheld,
would have eliminated all payments.
The Social Security Board threw
out the latter argument and ruled
on the first that fraternity, sorority,
and eating club executivies are "of
ficers" under the terms of the Act
regardless of whether they are paid
or are honorary.
Most Groups Exempt
When the exemption first was
claimed, the law provided that only
those organizations having more
than eight employes were required
to pay the tax. Under those pro
visions, a small percentage of the
houses have been ordered to pay
1937 taxes. Most groups were ex
empt.
Now, however, a new provision
sets the exemption at "four or less."
Since all house presidents, mana
gers, and hashers are designated as
"employes," all groups will be
taxed.
