# Governor's Wife' Gives Slight Chance to Cast
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
The Speech and Drama Division's preoccupation with the inhabitants
of the Iberian Peninsula received its second expression on the Stanford
stage last night, and one regrets to report that tbc subject seems iust about

evhausted —and exhausting.
Following a brilliant production
of "Don Juan" with a production of
Benevente's "The Governor's Wife"
which can only be classed as sec
ond-rate, the Division has let down
its public in a decided and not-to
be-denied manner.
Too long, too talky, too thin,
"The Governor's Wife" gave its cast
no more than the opportunity for a
gallery of portraits, one or two
brilliant, several outstanding, the
rest varying in interest from good
to very bad. Gary Simpson, Bar
bara Thrasher, Dan Holtom, Vir
ginia Sharpe, and of course the ac
complished Miss Schreiber were
among those present, but one imag
ines that there were times when they
wished they weren't.
Plot could hardly be said to exist,
what little there was being compli
cated by a tendency to go off into
long discussions of this and that on
the slightest provocation. There
was something about a revolution
ary movement, and we were sup
posed to be worried about the hero
ine's love affair, but somehow it
never quite jelled.
Easily the most pointless play the
Farm has been privileged to get en
thusiastic about in some time, "The
Governor's Wife" illustrated once
more that something must be done
about Stanford drama.
