# Farm In Dark As Sun Rises Behind Clouds

### 
Followers of the maxim "Early
|to bed, early to rise—" have found
; themselves plunged into darkness
j these last few mornings.
The Oldest Inhabitant woke up
] yesterday to the tune of a set-for
i 7 alarm clock to find himself in
I pitch darkness. Threatening to sue
■ everyone connected with the mak-
J ing of the clock, he smashed the
| poor defenseless thing in the face
■ and went back to bed — to sleep
I through his 8 o'clock.
The clock was right, and the mid
j night oil was just having a hang
j over—on the sloppiest, wettest day
it could find.
Remarking that it was the darkest
morning he'd ever experienced, the
Oldest Inhabitant said: "I borrowed
I a flash-light and some hip-boots'.
They won't catch me napping
! again!"
