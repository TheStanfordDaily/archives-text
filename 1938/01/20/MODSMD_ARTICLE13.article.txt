# River Repair Work Delayed By Storm
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 19 (UP).â€”
State Engineer Edward Hyatt re
ported today that the present storm
is impeding emergency levee repair
work along the Sacramento and
Feather Rivers.
He said although work is being
delayed on a serious break in the
Feather River levee at Robinson's
Bend, east of Gridley, sufficient re
pairs already have been completed to,
withstand a nominal rise in the
river.
