# Student Sees War From Shanghai Line
## TO KEEP AVIATRIX'S MEMORY ALIVE 
### LLOYD LAPHAM 
Warfare in Shanghai last autumn was a blurred ncwsreel picture of
bombings to most Stanford students, but one, at least, got real closeups
without benefit of camera.
In the volunteer corps of Shanghai's International Settlement, Mario
"Sunny" Somoes, senior, British citizen, and resident of the war-torn

city, went through the entire siege,4
got the view of a neutral though !
interested soldier.
"Foreign Legion"
Somoes joined the corps, which is
a sort of foreign legion mustered I
the various nations represented
for defense of the settlement from j
day his detachment was sent to
there, on Friday, Aug. 13. The next
Windy Corner, toughest defense
point along the boundary.
For four days he stayed in the
blockhouse there, behind sandbags.
The detachment did no fighting,
merely stood ready to repel any in
vasion of the settlement. But the i
point was dangerous, fighting was
going on just across the street, and
Japanese, Chinese, and British sec
tors converged there.
After those four days regular
troops arrived and the volunteers
were put on "internal duty." So
moes remained there until his dis
charge, except for a short term at
North Station.
"That was fierce, too," he says.
Remembers Bombing
Internal duty meant cleaning up
after bombings, keeping order in
the Chinese quarter, and evacuating
Europeans marooned in Greater
Shanghai. Somoes remembers three
bad bombings, that of the Cathay
Hotel that figured so prominently in
newsreels, the Sincere department
store bombing, and, near the end,
the accidental hit scored on a street
car.
All these bombs came from the
air; the stray shells from ground
guns did not cause nearly the dam
age of the high bursting air bombs.
But after each the corps had to clear
the area of the dead and wounded.
Evacuation Dangerous
Most dangerous of the internal
duty was evacuating nationals
caught outside the Settlement. The
corps had to do this job because the
regular troops who had taken over
the defense of the boundaries did
