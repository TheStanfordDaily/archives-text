# Stanford To Aid Fight On Polio
## Early Jolly-Up Planned As 'President's Ball' 
### 
Stanford swung its famous axe 011
poliomyelitis yesterday when plans
were announced for a Stanford
"President's Birthday Ball," a jolly
up, to be held on Thursday night,
January 27.
Though the Farm will be jumping
the gun by three days, the ball is
part of the nation-wide celebration
of the President's birthday to raise
funds for the Warm Springs Foun
dation in Georgia.
Begun two years ago by Warm
Springs' most distinguished patient,
President Roosevelt has set the ex
ample for a national contribution to
the polio sanitarium.
Last year, Stanford joined in the
campaign by sponsoring a dance
which netted over $90. Chairman
Boyd White, who also headed last
year's committee, hopes to exceed
this total with the jolly-up. Boyd
himself was a patient at Warm
Springs from 1929 to 1934, when he
enrolled at Stanford.
The jolly-up will last from 7 till
9 o'clock in the Women's Gym, "just
long enough to get warmed up, but
not long enough to break into stud
ies." Owing to conflicts in week-end
dates, the dance has been set for
Thursday night instead of Sunday,
official day of the celebration.
Isabel Goldthwaite's committee
will operate contributions from local
creameries. Music will be furnished
free by a local band.
