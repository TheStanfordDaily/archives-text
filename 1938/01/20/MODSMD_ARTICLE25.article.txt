# Cellar To Fill Special Plate Next Monday
## Union To Serve Large, Profit-free Meals For 35 And 50 Cents 
### 
Starting Monday, one corner of
the Cellar menu Will be dedicated
to the Farm's big eaters.
In that corner will be listed a
special 35 cent plate lunch and a 50
cent dinner which the Union Board
of Governors last night decided may
stop complaints about the amount
of Cellar food.
Portions will be large, the Board
decided, with no effort made to
make a profit on meals.
Daily Suggestion
The idea for the special additions
to the menu grew out of discussion
of a recent series of articles in The
Daily concerning the Union organi
zation.
From Acting Comptroller J. Hugh
Jackson and Student Manager
Charles Fontius came confirmation
of The Daily's view that, quantity
of food was low compared to price.
Fontius in particular made the
point that students eating regularly
at the Cellar could not get the same
quantity of food for the price that
students at living groups could get.
Dean Jackson observed that prob
ably this group was least able to
pay high prices for food.
Living Group Meal
Using the average living group
meal for a base, the Board attempt
ed to work out a meal that would
give satisfaction to regular Cellar
eaters. On the special menu item,
it was agreed, there would be meat
and vegetables with a drink and des
sert.
Following the living group cri
terion, it was decided to give only
one choice of meat and dessert. A
35 cent lunch and 50 cent dinner,
the Board believes, will make three
meals available at living group
prices.
Daily representatives suggested
that a distinctive name be given
the plate in order to make the ex
periment effective. Choice of the
name was left to The Daily.
Cellar Problems
After Christine Ricker had cited
the peculiar problems of the Cellar
and the many types of patrons to be
served, the discussion narrowed
l down to amount of food. The Board
agreed that there was one special
group of eaters that had a legitimate
complaint—those who were practi
cally forced to eat regularly at the
Cellar.
Rather than increase portions on
dishes throughout the menu, the
Board decided that one special plate
without regard for cost could be
tried at least for a time. The suc
cess of the experiment, the Board
believes, may suggest other changes.

special 35 cent plate lunch and a 50
cent dinner which the Union Board
of Governors last night decided may
stop complaints about the amount
of Cellar food.
Portions will be large, the Board
decided, with no effort made to
make a profit on meals.
Daily Suggestion
The idea for the special additions
to the menu grew out of discussion
of a recent series of articles in The
Daily concerning the Union organi
zation.
From Acting Comptroller J. Hugh
Jackson and Student Manager
Charles Fontius came confirmation
of The Daily's view that, quantity
of food was low compared to price.
Fontius in particular made the
point that students eating regularly
at the Cellar could not get the same
quantity of food for the price that
students at living groups could get.
Dean Jackson observed that prob
ably this group was least able to
pay high prices for food.
Living Group Meal
Using the average living group
meal for a base, the Board attempt
ed to work out a meal that would
give satisfaction to regular Cellar
eaters. On the special menu item,
it was agreed, there would be meat
and vegetables with a drink and des
sert.
Following the living group cri
terion, it was decided to give only
one choice of meat and dessert. A
35 cent lunch and 50 cent dinner,
the Board believes, will make three
meals available at living group
prices.
Daily representatives suggested
that a distinctive name be given
the plate in order to make the ex
periment effective. Choice of the
name was left to The Daily.
Cellar Problems
After Christine Ricker had cited
the peculiar problems of the Cellar
and the many types of patrons to be
served, the discussion narrowed
l down to amount of food. The Board
agreed that there was one special
group of eaters that had a legitimate
complaint—those who were practi
cally forced to eat regularly at the
Cellar.
Rather than increase portions on
dishes throughout the menu, the
Board decided that one special plate
without regard for cost could be
tried at least for a time. The suc
cess of the experiment, the Board
believes, may suggest other changes.
