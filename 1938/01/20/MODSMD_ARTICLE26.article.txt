# Hoover, Debaters Discuss Problems
## 
### 
Before they left yesterday on the
Stanford eastern debate tour Ger
ald Marcus and Carl Deisenroth
visited Herbert Hoover to discuss
topics which the two will argue.
The two main topics concern the
National Labor Relations Board and
the C.1.0. in relation to their effect
on labor problems.
They plan to use much of the ma
terial derived from the discussion
in their eastern forensic engage
ments.
Deisenroth and Marcus also talked
to President Wilbur and received of
ficial letters of identification, which
certify them as Stanford's official
representatives.
