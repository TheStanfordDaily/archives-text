### 
BARCELONA, Spain, Jan. 19
(UP) —Rebel bombing planes today
attacked Barcelona and Valencia,
the most crowded cities of Loyalist
Spain, and within an hour and a
half piled streets .with dead and de
bris for a total of hundreds of lives.
Hurried estimates of the noon
time raids by six black bombers
that swept off the Balearic Islands,
put the number of dead at some
where between 700 and 1000, includ
ing hundreds of women and chil
dren.
Children Killed
The tanker Esturia reported today
in a wireless message transmitted
through the Algiers radio station,
that 500 children were killed in the
raid on Valencia.
The Esturia said benzol storage
tanks had been struck and that
flames were visible for 50 miles.
The six planes exacted a toll of
civilian lives that exceeded the sol
dier dead of most battles in the
front lines.
It was the worst extermination of
non-combatants in this 18-month
old "little world war."
Debris Fills Streets
The estimate of 1000 lives was only
a sweeping one, for the streets of
Spain's two big cities along the
Mediterranean coast were piled with
debris and the bodies of men, women
and children.
The Loyalist Defense Ministry list
ed 520 dead and countless hundreds
wounded in Barcelona alone after
95 seconds of explosive horror, in
which 11 huge bombs scored direct
hits—and from an altitude of 10,000
feet that mocked anti-aircraft fire.
