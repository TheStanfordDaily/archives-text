# Farm Dancers Will Meet Today
## 
### 
Junior Orchesis, open to all who I
wish to attend, is continuing its
weekly meetings on Thursdays at 5
o'clock this quarter. The work of
the next two weeks will be especial
ly concerned with techniques for j
Orchesis tryouts, which wili be held |
Feb. 1 in the Dance Studio.
Stanford women wishing to try
out for Senior Orchesis will gain a
great deal from participation in !
this preparatory group. The society
offers an hour a week of strenuous i
exercise along with definite im- ;
provement in body carriage. For- |
mer dance students, not now en- I
rolled in classes, are particularly j
urged to join.
