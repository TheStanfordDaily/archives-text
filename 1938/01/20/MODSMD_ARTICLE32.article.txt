LUISETTI & CO. STOCKS
DROPPED A FEW POINTS
John Bunn's boys have got to win
lhat basketball game tomorrow
night over in the lair of the Boo
erkeley Bear.
A loss will cause a panic in the
P.C.C. stock market. Holders, dead
sure of their investments, will fall
all over each other trying to sell
their interests in Luisetti & Co.
The staff of Luisetti & Co. was
dog-tired and ailing, one gloomy
night last week-end, and instead of
taking the night off, they worked.
A few blunders here and there
in the accounts, and the Cardinal
sealed stocks went down a few
points, with El Trojan Preferred
climbing to a new high.
Chairman Bunn of the Board of
Directors has pulled his company
together and the work that Luisetti
& Co. turn out this week-end should
shoot the little stock certificates
with the pretty red seals up a f ew
points.
BUNNMEN WERE FAR
FROM TOP FORM
To climb out from behind this pic
ture of the P.C.C. financial world
and to get down to an everyday dis
cussion of sports, the Card basket
ball team was far from top form
when they lost to a powerful U.S.C.
quintet last Saturday *night in the
Pavilion.
Cap'n Hankus, bothered by a
slight cold and a splitting head
ache, wasn't doing the work he
is capable of. Friday night, Phil
Zonnc played the best game of
his career; Saturday night, he was
definitely oil' his form.
Art Stoefen, one of the best re
bound men and deadeyes on the
coast, was so far removed from his
visual form, with the exception of
the last five minutes, that he looked
more like a frosh sub. Jack Cal
derwood wasn't playing real ball
until the last 10 minutes of play,
when he came to life to spark a
brilliant Stanford rally that was
just a little too late.
PODUNK 111 CAN DO
IT TOO, NIBS
We all look for a convincing Red
and White victory in the Bear pavil
ion tomorrow night. Bunn's basket
eers should reach rare form and
sweep the cocky Bears from the
court.
Nibs Price's men are at the top
of the conference ladder, now,
but they got there by winning
two games from U.C.L.A. with a
total margin of seven points. I
honestly believe that Podunk High
School could head the conference
right now if its first two games
were against the diminutive
Bruins of Westwood.
The Californians are always
tough, however, especially against
the Stanfords. The Bears know
that a win will definitely place them
in the running for the crown . . .
they have a slight chance and they
may come through.
BI RD WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO CARDS
I received a little missive from
John Burd Jr., editor of the Cal
Dippy. Sez Burd: "Might I inquire
what happened to the indomitable
Hank Luisetti & Co. last Saturday
eve?
"The degrading spectacle of a
northern team humbling itself to
those lousy Kansans (they're In
dianans, John) from the South
rankles me no end, despite the
fact that our standing was in
creased thereby. Caution the
boys to remember that if Stan
ford MUST drop an occasional
game, they might be gentlemen
and drop them to a California
varsity."â€”Gene Gear.
