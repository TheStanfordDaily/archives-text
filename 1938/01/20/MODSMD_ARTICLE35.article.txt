# Frosh Scalp San Mateo In Hoop Tilt
## Changed Yearling Team Flashes 63-21 Win, As Marshall Stars 
### JERRY MAYER 
Lokoing for all the world as if they
were used to running up big scores,
Stanford's frosh basketball players
nonchalantly slaughtered a hapless
San Mateo College outfit last night
in the Pavilion by a 63-21 score.
It didn't look like the same outfit
that couldn't even score 63 points
in TWO games last week-end—and
it wasn't the same outfit.
Coach Wytzg Gorter threw togeth
er almost an entirely new team
against the jaysees, and the boys
liked the idea of being off the
bench so well that they decided to
take steps to stay off. Result—a mur
derous attack that would have done
credit to the varsity.
Marshall High Scorer
Tiny Bill "Mike" Marshall, for
ward, gathered scoring honors with
20 points. He was hard-pfessed by
Teammate Don BurneSs, who tanked
19 digits. Don Williams garnered
himself an even dozen markers and
turned in an outstanding defensive
and offensive game in the bargain.
Williams' passing was deadly.
Gorter felt sure that his team
would come through offensively, but
he was a litle worried about the de
fense. His worry was needless be
cause, if possible, the defense func
tioned better than the offense.
Every time a San Mateo player
got his hands on the ball he found
two or three Papooses hanging all
over his frame.
Guards Hustled
Both yearling guards, Kenny Dav
idson and Bill Niccols went out of
the game on fouls, but not before
they had run the San Mateo attack
into the floor with their hustling
defensive play.
High point man for San Mateo
was Harris, a forward, who tanked
five, digits. The weak jaysee team
was outclassed from the opening tip
off and were trailing 29 to 9 at the
half.
Line-ups:
Stanford (63) (21) San Mateo
Marshall (20) F (4) Hunt
Williams (12) F (5) Harris
Burness (19) C (2) Martini
Davidson (5) G (4) Newlove
Niccojls (5) G (1) Wiener
Subs: Stanford—Schroeder, Ditlev

20 points. He was hard-pfessed by
Teammate Don BurneSs, who tanked
19 digits. Don Williams garnered
himself an even dozen markers and
turned in an outstanding defensive
and offensive game in the bargain.
Williams' passing was deadly.
Gorter felt sure that his team
would come through offensively, but
he was a litle worried about the de
fense. His worry was needless be
cause, if possible, the defense func
tioned better than the offense.
Every time a San Mateo player
got his hands on the ball he found
two or three Papooses hanging all
over his frame.
Guards Hustled
Both yearling guards, Kenny Dav
idson and Bill Niccols went out of
the game on fouls, but not before
they had run the San Mateo attack
into the floor with their hustling
defensive play.
High point man for San Mateo
was Harris, a forward, who tanked
five, digits. The weak jaysee team
was outclassed from the opening tip
off and were trailing 29 to 9 at the
half.
Line-ups:
Stanford (63) (21) San Mateo
Marshall (20) F (4) Hunt
Williams (12) F (5) Harris
Burness (19) C (2) Martini
Davidson (5) G (4) Newlove
Niccojls (5) G (1) Wiener
Subs: Stanford—Schroeder, Ditlev
sen, Rumbley (2), Graff, Masters;
San Mateo — Gill, Nellen, McCall,
Sherry (3), Adler (2), Walker.
Lokoing for all the world as if they
were used to running up big scores,
Stanford's frosh basketball players
nonchalantly slaughtered a hapless
San Mateo College outfit last night
in the Pavilion by a 63-21 score.
It didn't look like the same outfit
that couldn't even score 63 points
in TWO games last week-end—and
it wasn't the same outfit.
Coach Wytzg Gorter threw togeth
er almost an entirely new team
against the jaysees, and the boys
liked the idea of being off the
bench so well that they decided to
take steps to stay off. Result—a mur
derous attack that would have done
credit to the varsity.
Marshall High Scorer
Tiny Bill "Mike" Marshall, for
ward, gathered scoring honors with
20 points. He was hard-pfessed by
Teammate Don BurneSs, who tanked
19 digits. Don Williams garnered

and offensive game in the bargain.
