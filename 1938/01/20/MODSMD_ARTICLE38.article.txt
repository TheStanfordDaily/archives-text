# Pavilion Floor Takes Beating
## 
### 
Workmen were busily employed
repairing the Pavilion floor yester
day afternoon in time for the frosh
basketball game after the terrific
beating it took Tuesday night when
the Sponsor pachyderms nosed out
A.K.L. 15 to 14 in an intramural con
test of superiority decided through
the manly medium of basketball.
Charmingly adorned in scarlet
bathing robes while training on ci
gars, Sponsors Peter "Renfrew" Za
gar, Woodward Ernest Adams,
Louis "Shanghai Express" Tsou
tsouvas and others performed their
blocking assignments perfectly to
squeeze out the slim victory.
Hiding in their Encina hovels the
inflated Sponsors issued an ultima
tum, "We'll take on any organization
on the campus."
