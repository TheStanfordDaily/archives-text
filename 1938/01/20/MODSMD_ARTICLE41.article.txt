# Card Hoopmen Perk Up, Set For Bear Tilt
## Cards Take Work-Outs To Improve Offense For Cal, Moragans 
### 
Having watched his team go
through what he termed a "very
successful" workout on offense
Tuesday, after a drill on funda
mentals of defense, Coach John
Bunn ordered more of the same for
the varsity basketballers yesterday.
No contact work will be meted
out to the squad, which has perked
up considerably after a slightly
gloomy practice on Monday, the
coach said. Even Captain Hank
Luisetti, who was a beautiful shade
of indigo Monday because he felt
|he hadn't done too well against
U.S.C., was chipper as a lark yes
terday.
The outfit goes through its last
work-out this afternoon before the
contest with the Bears at Berkeley
tomorrow night. It will also be the
I last, of course, before-the St. Mary's
game Saturday night in the Pavil
ion.
The exact status of the Gaels in
the Cards' estimation is pretty much
in the dark, but it is reasonably cer
tain the unkind words slung around
so far this year by Harlan Dykes,
coach of the Moragans, about how
Stanford will lose three games to
U.S.C. and stuff hasn't helped out.
Whether the Indians choose to
disregard Dykes or take his utter
' ances to heart will make little dif
ference to the form betters, for
| while Dykes has a mighty reputa
tion as a basketball coach he still
hasn't got what is popularly known
as a marvelous basketball team.
Cal will not be taken too lightly
by Stanford, according to Bunn, for
their record shows them to be not
at all weak. A bright intersectional
record before the conference start
ed, and then two wins last week
i against U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles
| that have put them in the confer
! ?nce lead makes the Bears look a
' little better than pushovers.
