## Quick, Fellas, Let's Fight!

A AMERICAN universities have been criti
cized at one time or another for almost
every possible fault, but last week famed Wil
liam Allen White turned up with a brand new
slant on an old, old tale.
Recently he told a Boston reporter:
"I'd like to see more riots on college cam
puses. I am a little appalled sometimes when
I see students in college more conservative
than their fathers ... I like the English way,
where people are radical when young, and
conservative when old."
The Emporia editor, himself a conservative,
bases his statement on a well known psycho
logical fact—that the individual tends to be
come more conservative as he matures.
Thus a conservative youth becomes a middle
aged reactionary, while a liberal youth grows
moderately conservative. Therefore, accord
ing to Mr. White's ideas, American students
must be more liberal to insure a balanced,
rather than a lop-sided, government in the
future.
This line of reasoning has some obvious
merits, but it also includes a false premise.
For. while there is admittedly a positive corre
lation between adulthood and sane thinking,
there is no sense to sweeping statements that
this is a general rule or that mature thought
universally turns toward the right.
In the first place, the political and social

prejudices of many students are the result of
no deep thinking whatsoever. Too often "men
and women" go to college armed with "the
true thought" which is in reality only a hand
out of paternal prejudices.
These prejudices are relatively permanent
affairs and almost never mature as do thought
out opinions. A dangerously large number of
American students depend wholly on such en
vironment-fostered ideas.
These students—not those who come to col
lege and start thinking—imperil the future of
both government and sanity.
Whether a man tends toward the right or
left does not matter nearly so much as that he
might, through sheer laziness, depend upon
the thinking of others.
Thought, good clear thought, is the only log
ical antidote to Mr. White's worries. And the
premium on such thinking is at a low ebb
when the greater percentage of university stu
dents borrow, in toto, their fathers' political and
social attitudes.
That this condition is rather general through
out U. S. colleges is obvious to most modern
educators. Not so obvious is the best means of
combatting such indifference.
We know this much, however. Until the pres
ent intellectual apathy can be overcome in
American univeristies, students will continue
to take the easiest way—borrowing stereotyped
ideas on stereotyped subjects.—J. R.
