LAST week the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol wilfully swung a haymaker right hook
and laid itself wide open for more abuse than
a sparring partner's chin â€”it passed a ruling in
validating all Block "S" cards five years after
graduation and made its action retroactive.
It thus touched a match to the charitable old
order under which Block "S" cards were good
for life, entitling their holder to free admis
sion to all athletic contests in which Stanford
participates.
Present Stanford athletes and prospective
holders of Block "S" cards have little grounds
for bombardment, but no great powers of de
duction need be used to anticipate the howl
that alumni Block "S" holders will raise next
fall when their cards no longer hold the magic
charm for free football tickets.
The B.A.C.'s action is entirely justifed. Last
year it cost Stanford $32,000 to give its ath
letic heroes of yesteryear their gratis admission
to football alone. Under the old plan that figure
was increasing with every year.

In most every case the individuals receiving
the concession were in a position to cover the
expense of tickets had they been treated as
regular alumni.
The new deal will give graduating Block "S"
holders free tickets for five years. That is sup
posed to be long enough to allow them to
find a job, get married, and earn the price of
a couple of tickets on the side. At least that's
the reasoning behind the thing.
It's just as well that Stanford has decided not
to subsidize for life every man who made ten
yards. But listen for the bombshell next fall.
