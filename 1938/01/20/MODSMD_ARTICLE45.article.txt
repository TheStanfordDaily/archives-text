# BULL SESSION

I Mr. "Ghost Writer":
Yesterday I received one of your circulars in
which you offered to write to order my reports and
jssays. A number of other people on the campus were
sent similar letters, and I am sure that we all appre
ciate the humanitarian work you are doing.
You suggest that we commission you to "ghost
write" our themes and term papers for a "minimum
charge." You specify you are not interested in use of
these papers, but only in pleasing the consumer. As
you point out, your equipment and training make it
possible to compose "original" themes and book re
ports. This lightening of the load of study is obviously
worth the "minimum charge."
It is regrettable that most of the students here had
their characters warped at an early age so that now
they rate buying term papers on about the same moral
plane as clubbing newsboys and taking their pennies.

It is also regrettable that Stanford believes people
who sell term papers are quite a bit lower than sea
level. I am afraid that this will keep us from form
ing any lasting friendship. But that does not mean
that we can't work out some business relationship.
From your letter it appears that while a genius in
research you are a little weak on your writing. That's
nothing to be ashamed of in these days of specializa
tion. But when you split a verb and say, "I feel that
I may confidently produce the piece of work desired,"
it's time that you got somebody to handle the writing
end of "your business. I would suggest that you get
lip the material whenever you receive an order, and
then shoot it out to me. I'll be glad to whip it into
shape—for a "minimum charge" of course. In fact,
we can institute a new service. I'll guarantee- to de
liver the paper to the professor so that the purchaser
doesn't have to show up at class at all and can stay
home to nurse his hangover.

OUT if we work this little deal, it will have to be on
a salary basis. You see, your experience has been
in colleges where a lot of men undoubtedly don't mind
chiseling their classmates out of a year's hard work
prospecting for ideas in the library hinterland. But
out here we unsophisticated country boys just haven't
the sense to take advantage of a grand opportunity
like that. If I took the job on a commission basis it
wouldn't pay.
Even if we can't work out a deal, though, I'm glad
that you wrote. It clears up a problem that has been
bothering me for some time. I have been wondering
why in this age of advertising the criminals don't bill
their products. Now I find that they do, and I realize
that it is only a matter of time before some of the less
intellectual boys get around to it. We can look for
ward to ads like, "Expert safecracking and bomb
throwing. See Joe Burp." Or a snappy catch line,
"Does your aunt annoy you? We do guaranteed ex
termination work." At that the low brows would be
frank, a virtue which you can't of course permit your
self.
I don't like to torpedo any of your rosy dreams, but
I'm afraid you won't find much "ghost writing" trade
on this campus. Maybe our boys lack good business
sense. But they stand head over the heels who have
lo final a loan In tlieir brains. Sincerely,
—John Cobbs.
