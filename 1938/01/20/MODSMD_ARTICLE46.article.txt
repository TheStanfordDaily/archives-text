A MAMMOTH stage we never use . . . facilities for
experimental drama which are never utilized . . .
a series of smash productions of all the plays nobody
else wiil touch with a 10-foot pole ... a great deal of
talk about "giving the student actor experience" . . .
"artistic triumphs" . . . "freedom from box office re
strictions" ... an unconscious self-sabotage which is
rapidly stripping the new theater of its prestige, its
significance, and its value. \
All these, the chief contributions to date of a De
partment of Speech and Drama which began its career
with unparalleled promise and an opportunity for con
structive and progressive work seldom equalled in the
American theater.
Just where the reason for this deadly mediocrity
lies, one could not say. Certainly the directors work
hard enough, and conscientiously, too. The enthusi
asm and earnestness of the casts cannot be questioned.
Public response has been whole-hearted and sym
pathetic. The Administration has placed little restric
tion on the Depai'tment, and has given it everything
in the way of equipment and material. Everything,
that is, but a practical sense of what constitutes
worthwhile experimentation.
There have been good plays in the new theater—
"good" in the sense of good for the actor, good for the
audience, good for the soul. "Don Juan" was such a
play, "Trial by Jury" was another. Occasionally the
Department forgets its stern duty to dust off forgotten
masterpieces and brings forth something which is en
tertaining as well as artistic.

it remembers that if the actor is
to get anything from his play, he must have audi
ence response, and that if audience response is lack
ing, value for the actor is lacking too.,
Occasionally it should stop to realize, also, that
while audiences on the whole tend to be medium
brow, they do possess a pretty good sense of what is
worthwhile and what is not, and show a pretty strong
tendency to go for the one and leave the other alone.
If experimentation and experience are the goals,
how about O'Neill's "Lazarus Laughed," as savage,
barbaric, and colorful a play as one could desire? How
about modern-dress "Julius Caesars" and similar ex
citing innovations? How about any one of a thousand
and one plays and a thousand and one ways in which
one can achieve a vivid experience in the theater?
The facilities are here; the plays are available;
there is lacking only the imagination capable of using
them.
Until they are used, until Stanford does step for
ward into the place of dramatic leadership which is
rightfully hers, one cannot help but feel that the De
partment of Speech and Drama is not keeping faith
with those who built and are backing its magnificent
theater: the students of Stanford University.—Drury.
