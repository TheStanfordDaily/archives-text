# CAMPUS OPINION
## BAND STAND 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford students attending the
basketball games this past week-end
were much surprised to find the
Stanford band not present. Not
present was any of the color, the
spirit, or the music that is part of
the band; one could hardly realize it
was a Stanford game, played in the
Stanfoi'd pavilion, against traditional
Stanford rivals.
It is the unanimous opinion of
Cardinals that the band should be
present at the games. This coming
week-end the California band will
be there in all its glory—the Stan
ford band will not be present to
answer the musical challenge. The
policy of the Board of Athletic Con
trol for the current season is def
initely opposed to having the band
play at any game, California or
otherwise.
Action Necessary
Unless some action is taken by
the student public opinion, the band
—naturally an essential part of any
Stanfoi'd athletic activity—will be
non-functioning this quarter.
A talk to the student manager of
the band convinced us that the band
is truly anxious and desirous of
playing at the games; that music
can be played so as not to blast the
students out of their seats, as the
Board of Athletic Control contends
the band must necessarily play; that
every week finds the band im
proving.
The members of the band are
practicing twice a week, and with
no student activities to play for,
those members are losing all their
incentive.
Opinion Responsible
We cannot help but realize the
tremendous progressive steps taken
by the band last quarter—student
opinion was responsible for it. To
keep the band progressing and in
terested in improving, student opin
ion should see to it that the band
goes where the student body goes,
and plays at those functions where
it has always played in the past.
But more important than the
position of the band itself is the
position of the student body. Why
should not. the student body enjoy
the new music prepared by its band?
Why should we not make the rest
of our basketball games Stanford
games?— Mark Hopkins, chairman
of Cardinals.
