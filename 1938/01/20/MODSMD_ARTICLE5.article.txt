# Foreign House Plans Pushed
## Project Lacks Funds, But Will Continue 
### 
Though administrative financial
backing must be at least temporarily
lacking, Stanford's live-wire Inter
national Committee decided last
night to carry on plans for the es
tablishment of a living group for
foreign students on their own ini
tiative.
Because of a dearth of admini
strative funds for such a purpose,
plans suggested by Dean Mary Yost
and President Ray Lyman Wilbur
for the construction of a graduate
dormitory or for a house presided
over by an American couple must
be shelved.
''Self-Supporting"
Instead, the committee is going
to bet its shirt on the possibility of
establishing a living group pat
terned after such organizations as
the German House. Underwritten
by the University for the first few
years of its existence, such houses
have become self-supporting, and
the committee believes that an In
ternational House could follow this
arrangement.
Informal investigation during the
past week showed that, of about 25
foreign students who were ques
tioned, nearly everyone wanted to
live in such a group. In addition,
several American students have al
ready applied to Mel Jacoby, chair
man of the group, to live in the
proposed house.
Second problem which the com
mittee is considering is that of aid
ing foreign students to overcome the
language handicap which they must
face.
Language Handicap
Though seldom lacking a working
knowledge of grammar, most of
these students have trouble with
conversational English.
Committee members will investi
gate the possibility that American
students seeking practice in teach
ing might be willing to aid in over
coming the language difficulties of
foreign students.
Plans for the forthcoming in
formal party for Stanford's inter
national popularity on Jan. 30 were
discussed. Lack of space and fi
nances do not permit an unlimited
I number to be invited, but American
I students wishing to attend should
call Helen Gilman, in Lagunita.
