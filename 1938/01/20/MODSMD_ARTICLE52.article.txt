# Painters Show Color, Realism In New Exhibit
## 
### 
Two collections of modern paint
ings, one of Albert Marshall and
one of Lester Boronda, are now on
exhibit at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Mr. Marshall's collection consists
of about 35 water color sketches, for
which he has taken scenes from the
high Sierras as subjects. Detail of
outline and color stands out par
ticularly in the sketches which
range from dark canyon scenes done
in deep purples and browns to
sketches in bright autumn hill sides.
His use of dark colors is exempli
fied in the sketch entitled "Mt.
Ritter and Barnet Peak," while the
sketch "Autumn," painted in Ka
weah Canyon, is one of his best
examples of bright color. "Moun
tain Ranch in October" shows a
combination of both bright and
dark colors.
Lester Boronda's collection is
done in oil. He has used scenes from
all over the world as subjects for his
paintings, although most of his pic
tures are of Mexico and early Cali
fornia.
Outstanding in the group is "To
the Fiesta," which shows a two
wheel cart drawn by tired oxen. In
the cart the the drivei', a guitar play
er, a senorita and an indistinguish
able companion.
"Washington Square," a snow
scene, effectively subordinates
people, and centers on an old, grey
arch.
"Afternoon" painted in Oeurayez,
Brittany and "Inner Harbor," a
scene from St. Tropiz, France, are
also well worth seeing.—Marquand.
