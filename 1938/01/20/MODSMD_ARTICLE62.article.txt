# Encinans Abandon Plans For Formal
## 
### 
Encina Council last night aban
doned its plans for a Winter Quarter
dance because the A.S.S.U. had no
available date. All efforts will be
centered upon a formal spring
dance, possibly to feature a big
name band, on Friday, May 13.
Arrangements for an Encina open
house and jolly-up are being laid
by Walt Stoessel, Encina president,
and Dick Harman, manager.
