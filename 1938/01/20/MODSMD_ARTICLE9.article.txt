# Cardinals Debate Don Team Today
## 
### 
In the first of two exchange de
bates. Gene Glasmann and Carl
Barrow will meet a University of
San Francisco team here this after
noon at 4 o'clock in Room 202. The
second match will take place on a
later date on the Don campus.
The clash will mark the first use
of the point of information in a
Stanford debate. Each speaker may
be asked three questions during his
constructive speach. The opposi
tion, by asking a simple, direct
quetion thus has a means of elicit
ing some information which the
speaker avoids.
The Cardinals will take the af
firmative of "Resolved, that the pro
gram of the C.1.0. is detrimental to
the best interests of labor."' The
public is invited to attend the de
bate.
