## Cardinal Team Employs Information Method In U. S. F. Contest 
### 
For the first time at Stanford, in
tercollegiate debaters used the point
of information when Gene Glasmann
and Carl Barrow met Murray Shea
and Harry Sloan of the University
of San Francisco yesterday after
noon on the question "Resolved, that
the program of the C.1.0. is detri
mental to the best interests of
labor."
The point of information consists
of the system of allowing opposing
sides to rise to a question during the
constructive arguments. One addi
tional minute is allowed each speak
er to whom a question is put.
Attack C.1.0.
The Cardinal debaters upheld the
affirmative of the question and at
tacked the program of the C.1.0. on
the grounds that it is working for
the pez'sonal ambitions of a few men
and not the good of the whole.
In the words of Miss Glasmann,
"The C.1.0. is not working for a
solid and united labor front." She
also stated that the C.1.0. has been
the of many needless strikes.
Tlie first question came from the
negative side when Mr. Shea asked,
"Do you consider all strikes need
less?" Miss Glasmann answered
that only those involving wages and
hours were excusable.
History Told
The negative told of the formation
of the C.1.0., its accomplishments
and its aims, and brought out the
point that it had slarted under the
American Federation of Labor and
that only the personal ambitions of
the leaders of the A. F. of L. had
blocked its progress and suspended
it from the original group.
Mr. Sloan argued that the C.1.0.
organization takes care of the un
skilled laborer, who is ignored by
other organizations, and that it in
tends to give labor a foothold and
prestige in America.
Next Contest
Mr. Barrow stated for the affirma
tive. "This question involves more
than just labor; it involves the
American people as a whole."
The point of information, though
new to the Stanford debaters, proved
successful and will be used next
week when Bob Curtis and Warren
Margrath go to U.S.F. to debate the
same question. The debate was
non-decision.

negative side when Mr. Shea asked,
"Do you consider all strikes need
less?" Miss Glasmann answered
that only those involving wages and
hours were excusable.
History Told
The negative told of the formation
of the C.1.0., its accomplishments
and its aims, and brought out the
point that it had slarted under the
American Federation of Labor and
that only the personal ambitions of
the leaders of the A. F. of L. had
blocked its progress and suspended
it from the original group.
Mr. Sloan argued that the C.1.0.
organization takes care of the un
skilled laborer, who is ignored by
other organizations, and that it in
tends to give labor a foothold and
prestige in America.
Next Contest
Mr. Barrow stated for the affirma
tive. "This question involves more
than just labor; it involves the
American people as a whole."
The point of information, though
new to the Stanford debaters, proved
successful and will be used next
week when Bob Curtis and Warren
Margrath go to U.S.F. to debate the
same question. The debate was
non-decision.
