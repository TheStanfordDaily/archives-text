# Dailymen Vanquish Chappie-Daffies
## 
### 
Embattled Shanghai has nothing
on the Stanford Press building, not
after the great Daily-Chappie battle
of yesterday afternoon.
Bitter over their ignominious
showing in the recent bowling con
test, the Chappie-daffies, morose as
usual, were screaming taunts of bat
tle from their Press Building office
down to the adjoining Shack.
Taunts led to rejoinders. Re
joinders led to scorching telephone
calls. Phone calls led immediately
to rocks thrown from the Chappie
hideout to the home of Stanford
journalism, and vice versa.
In less time than you could say
"Men's Council will get you if you
don't watch out," a battle was on
that none could shirk. A.s one man,

the Daily scriveners picked up arm
fuls of wrapped, unopened exchange
papers, began hurtling them into the
humor-asylum.
The air was thick, with papers go
ing up and coming down, and cat
calls from all directions. One good
thing leading to another, a Chappie
culprit suddenly blasted a "Bull
Sessioner's" dignity with a well
aimed water bag.
Speaking figuratively, fire was re
turned with fire, and, again to mix
our metaphors, the main entrance to
the Stanford Press began to look likt
Niagara. Dailymen, using every
thing from paper bags to milk bot
tles to large popcorn cans, proceeded
to give the Chappie office the clean
ing-out that it has needed for so
many years.
Suddenly, as if drawn to the scene

of conflict by some psychic attrac
tion, Officers Gordy Davis and
George Burns pulled to the curb in
their white chariot, just as a hectic
associate editor was hopelessly using
a large screen in an effort to ward
off a missile from the Chaps.
No words were spoken; none were
needed. With the officers present,
the battle ended. In the armistice
following, a person describing him
self as editor of the Chappie, on J
Robert T. Hartmann, came down to
"confer" with the law-upholders.
Judging from injuries received,
Hartmann was ever in the front of
the battle, facing the other way.
All present stood in silence, but
only for a moment, respecting a man
who had proven that in battle as in
journalism he was valorous, was no
longer wet only "behind the ears.
