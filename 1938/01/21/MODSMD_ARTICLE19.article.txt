# Recovery Of Ross' Body Unconfirmed
## Deep Silence Is Maintained On Report Of Arrest In Kidnaping 
### 
ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 20 (UP).—
Federal agents under direct super
vision of J. Edgar Hoover were re
ported without confirmation tonight
to have recovered the body of
Charles S. Ross and to have made a
second arrest in his kidnaping and
murder.
Hoover himself continued to main
tain the secrecy with which for 48
hours he has cloaked his movements.
His Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents refused either to confirm or
deny the reports.
A clerk in a Superior, Wis., hotel
was responsible for the rumor—for
that was all it was—that a second
arrest had been made.
Clerk Starts Rumor
The clerk, Donald Mcßae, said
Hoover and five of his agents ap
peared at the hotel about 1 a.m.
He said two other men with the
party were in irons. It is thought,
however, that the supposed second
prisoner was likely a G-man, who
had shackled himself to Anders.
Mcßae, who identified Hoover
positively, said the entire party left
for St. Paul at 6:50 a.m.
He was said to have identified
tentatively Peter Anders, confessed
kidnaper and slayer of Ross, as one
of the men in irons.
If true, this presumably would
account for one of two groups of
agents who left St. Paul clad in
heavy outdoor clothing yesterday,
apparently to hunt the spot where
Anders said he buried Ross and J.
Atwood Gray, his kidnap-accomp
lice. Anders said he killed Gray to
prevent a split of Ross' $50,000 ran
som. Previously it had been assumed
that the bodies were buried near
Rockford, 111., probably just across
the Wisconsin state line.
Silence Causes l>oul)t
Doubt was cast on Mcßae's story
because of Hoover's usual taciturn
ity and because of the unusual se
crecy with which he has surrounded
this case.
One of the reports that Ross' body
had been found appeared to origi
nate in Chicago, where it was said a
"semiofficial" source at the FBI
office had disclosed that the body
had been found in Northern Wis
consin near Superior.
Daniel Ladd, chief of the Chicago
FBI office, denied he had made a
statement of any kind on the case.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 20 (UP).—
Federal agents under direct super
vision of J. Edgar Hoover were re
ported without confirmation tonight
to have recovered the body of
Charles S. Ross and to have made a
second arrest in his kidnaping and
murder.
Hoover himself continued to main
tain the secrecy with which for 48
hours he has cloaked his movements.
His Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents refused either to confirm or
deny the reports.
A clerk in a Superior, Wis., hotel
was responsible for the rumor—for
that was all it was—that a second
arrest had been made.
Clerk Starts Rumor
The clerk, Donald Mcßae, said
Hoover and five of his agents ap
peared at the hotel about 1 a.m.
He said two other men with the
party were in irons. It is thought,
however, that the supposed second
prisoner was likely a G-man, who
had shackled himself to Anders.
Mcßae, who identified Hoover
positively, said the entire party left
for St. Paul at 6:50 a.m.
He was said to have identified
tentatively Peter Anders, confessed
kidnaper and slayer of Ross, as one
of the men in irons.
If true, this presumably would
account for one of two groups of
agents who left St. Paul clad in
heavy outdoor clothing yesterday,
apparently to hunt the spot where
Anders said he buried Ross and J.
Atwood Gray, his kidnap-accomp
lice. Anders said he killed Gray to
prevent a split of Ross' $50,000 ran
som. Previously it had been assumed
that the bodies were buried near
Rockford, 111., probably just across
the Wisconsin state line.
Silence Causes l>oul)t
Doubt was cast on Mcßae's story
because of Hoover's usual taciturn
ity and because of the unusual se
crecy with which he has surrounded
this case.
One of the reports that Ross' body
had been found appeared to origi
nate in Chicago, where it was said a
"semiofficial" source at the FBI
office had disclosed that the body
had been found in Northern Wis
consin near Superior.
Daniel Ladd, chief of the Chicago
FBI office, denied he had made a
statement of any kind on the case.
