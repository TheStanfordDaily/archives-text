# Indian Hoopsters Ready For Battle With Cal Tonight
## Farm Quintet Favored In Berkeley Tilt Despite U.S.C. Loss 
### BY GENE GEAR 
Luisetti & Co. officials roll up their sleeves tonight anil tliti i" for sonic
hard work in an attempt to boost the cardinal-sealed stocks up a few
points.
Chairman John Bunn will move liis company into Ihc Berkeley foot
hills at 8 o'clock tonight to take up a little business with the Golden Boar

Co.
Despite Stanford's defeat at the
hands of the Trojans last Saturday,
and the Bears' impressive intersec
tional and conference record to date,
Luisetti & Co. will be heavily fav
ored to win the ball game and boost
up their stocks.
From all indications Bunn will
start the same lineup that took the
floor against U.S.C. last week-end.
Cap'n Hank Luisetti and Phil Zonne
will start in the forward berths;
Jack "Spook" Calderwood and H. B.
I Lee, at guards; and Art "Stork"
Stoefen at center.
Same As Against Troy
This was the combination that
clicked so beautifully against Ele
vator Sam's men of Troy last Fri
day night, and then, tired of it all,
slipped into mediocrity the follow
ing eve.
Tonight Stanford will start its
campaign to win its fourth basket
ball series from Cal since the Big
Games started back in 1912. To
date Cal has won 22 series to Stan
ford's 3 with one tied, and the Bears
have piled up a game advantage of
57-16.
Offense Stressed
Bunn has been stressing offense
most of the week in practice ses
sions while over across the bay His
Nibs . . . Price has been putting the
stress on defense.
Price has decided not to designate
the man-sized job of stopping Cap'n
i Hank to any individual, as has been
! tried by other team A without suc
; cess. Rather, he will turn that un
| pleasant duty over to his whole
team.
Fighting Spirit Back
The Card squad is psychologically
set for the game tonight after their
one-point loss to the Trojans. Hank
has regained his fighting spirit which
was lacking in the gloomy Monday
practice and the entire team has
followed suit.
Despite the fact that the Indians
are heavy favorites to whip the con
ference-leading Californians, the
Bunnmen are not taking tonight's
clash lightly. Despite publicity
blurbs stating that the Bears are
weak this season, they have an im
pressive record behind them so far,
and they may choose tonight to see
conference play.
St. Mary's Tomorrow
Tomorrow night here in the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock the Indians will
return to take on Harlan Dykes'
St. Mary's quintet.
The Gaels are none too good, de
spite the fact that they are leading
their league. In all probability the
Stanfords will take the hardwood
tomorrow night with one purpose in
view . . .to'make Mr. Dykes swallow
his uncomplimentary remarks.
During the season the Gael men
tor has repeatedly commented that
U.S.C. will take three out of four
games from the Indians, and that
Stanford has only Luisetti, while
U.S.C. has the team.
. Tonight and tomorrow night may
bring a prelude of the answers to
I these two remarks.
