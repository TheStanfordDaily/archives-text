Bacigaluping along over (he Brown
Brookes and the Bimbaums. Strib

bleyed up in her Fordyce and said:
"Hy-man! Won't you take me Bick
enbach?"
"Oh no," he remonstrated, "That

ise called 'I Shoor like to Shoop
Shoongs.' Now get out of here, you
little Baskin, and don't come back

"Ulph!" said the child. "Why the
Hellyer so Sharpe with us little
Gallas? It's Spring, and everything

But Bodkin stood Tight. "I'm get
