# Gorter Hoopmen Face St. Mary's Tomorrow
## 
### 
Anxious to get back into action.
Stanford's frosh cagers will go
through light drills this afternoon as
a final preparation for tomorrow
evening's invasion by St. Mary's
frosh. The game will start at 0:30
o'clock, being a preliminary tussle
to the varsity tilt between the
two schools.
Coach Wytze Gorter will start the
same aggregation that ran over San
Mateo Junior College last Wednes
day. Despite the fact that they had
been playing together as a unit less
than one week, the new line-up
that Gorter has concoGted is looking
better and better and he has
hopes that it will knock off the fa
vored Gaelets.
Coached by Dykes
St. Mary's is coached by Harlan
Dykes, who is also varsity mentor,
and plays a fast-breaking offensive
game with a modified man-to-man
defense. The Gaels have cleaned up
the San Francisco region prep school
teams and are all set to knoqk off the
Papooses.
Starting for Stanford will be Don
Williams and Bill Marshall, for
wards; Don Burness, center; Kenny
Davidson and Bill Niccolls, guards.
Williams turned in his best game
of the season against San Mateo,
scoring 12 points and playing bril

liant all-around ball. He is the only
member remaining on the first team
of the line-up that had started every
frosh game previous to Wednesday.
Burness in Good Form,
Opposite him will be the little
dead-eye, Marshall, who is a threat
to break up any game with his
deadly shooting. Marshall stands a
bare 5 feet 8.
Don Burness returned to his high
school form in the last game and his
shooting and rebounding was out
standing. The guards, Davidson and
Niccolls, were the heroes of the San
Mateo game and if they can repeat
their heads-up, alert, scrappy play
tomorrow evening, part of Gorter's
biggest worry will be erased. Both
boys were fouled out last Wednes
day night's game but they made life
miserable for the hapless jaysees
until their exit.
Strong Reserves
Gorter has strong, hustling re
serves to back up the opening quin
tet, including Bill Schroeder and
Bob Ditlevsen, forwards; Bill
Rumbley, center; and Bill Masters
and Stan Graff, guards.
The Gortermen will average
hardly more than 5 feet 11 against
the lanky "Mad Midgets of Moraga"
but the coach expects their fight and
speed to make up the deficiency.
