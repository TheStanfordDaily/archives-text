# It's Breakers Next for Daily Alley Artists
## 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
There's one born every minute.
Bowling teams, we mean.
And oh, how audacious they ai'e.
Why, some of them are so chipper
as to think that they have a chance
when they challenge the champion
ship Daily Sports Staff bowling
team.
Now, It's The Breakers
Take the Breakers outfit, f'rin
stance. Yeah, you take 'em. They
have actually come out publicly with
an announcement that they will take
on The Daily Sportswritcrs any time
that we're l'eady. They weren't
even subtle about it. And will they
regret it. Just wait.
Being unsubtle as they are, then
strategy is to keep the names of their
quartet a very deep secret, thinking
to frighten the Dailymen into a
shaky submission. But we care not
for their names. Masked Marvels or
no M. M.'s, we're not afraid, are
we, men? Or are we, mice?
Unbeaten Daily Four
The unbeaten Sports Staff four
will be Walt Peterson, Gene Gear,
Harry Press, and Phil Klauber, all
of whom have bowled at least 255 in
their kegling sessions.
The first pin will swat the back
board tomorrow at 1:30 o'clock in
Thurlow's Bowling Alleys. There
will be no admission charge, but a
collection will be made, proceeds to
be given to broken-down sports
writers .
