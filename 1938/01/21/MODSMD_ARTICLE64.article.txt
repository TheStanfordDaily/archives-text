EIGHT BOWLING TEAMS
ItEADY FOH ACTION
Well, Sideline Slants' bowling sug
gestion is beginning to take a foot
hold on the Farm. We're trying to
boost the plain and fancy art of keg
ling into a position where it v/ill be
placed on the list of intramural
sports.
Eight four-man teams have ap
peared from various nooks and
crannies on the campus, eager for
a little competition. In the only
match held thus far, the Daily
Sports Staff defeated the Chappie
squad, lfi<>B-142(i. The next match
is set lor Saturday at 1:30 when
the championship Daily Sports
Scriveners tangle with the highly
touted Breakers quartet.
Here are the eight teams: Daily
Sports Staff, Chappie Staff, Daily
Business Stalf, Breakers, Alpha
Sig.s, Chi Psis, Kappa Sigs, and An
gelenos. In a fc w days a complete
list of the teams and phone num
bers of their captains will be printed
in The Daily.
STANFORD BOWLING
LADDER LOOMS
Besides this week-end's match,
there are a few matches pending:
Alpha Sig-Chi Psi; Alpha Sig-Kappa
fcig-Daily Sports Staff; Daily Sports
Staff-Angelenos; and Daily Sports
Staff-Daily Business Stalf.
A match consists of four men on
each team howling three lines.
The final score is determined by
adding all scores for both teams.
There is no contest between indi
viduals ... it is a team average,'
Next week we hope to inaugurate
a Stanford Bowling Ladder, to be
printed in The Daily once or twice
a week. Teams may then challenge
one or two teams above them on the
ladder. As soon as a few of the pend
ing matches are played off, we will
know approximately where to place
the teams on the first ladder.
As soon as matches are played if
the captain of the winning team will
notify me at 8767 or 22166 of the
final score, team members, and in
dividual high scores, etc., a short
account of the match will be printed
in The Daily and the ladder ad
justed.
I ROSH ACCOMPLISH
COMPLETE REVERSAL
One of the biggest upsets and
greatest form reversals, on the Farm
this school year transpired in the
Pavilion Wednesday night, when a
none-too-flashy frosh basketball
team suddenly came out of the
weeds to smash a supposedly strong
Ban Mateo J. C. team into submis
sion, 63-21.
The yearling 1 - didn't look too im
pressive in nosing out a close one
over Marin J. C., and then looked
pretty feeble indeed, losing last
week-end to a pair of good high
school teams.
Wednesday night the Encina asy
lum inmates scored more points than
they could muster in both games
last week. The reason . . . Coach
Wytze Gorter juggled his lineup
around and found a combination
that should sweep anything off the
courts, especially those Cal Cubs.
DON BURNESS COMES
INTO ins OWN
Don Burness, rated last year as the
best high school player San Fran
cisco had seen since Luisetti, was
pulled from his obscure guard post
and put where he belongs ... at
center. Don tanked 19 points.
Little Bill Marshall, one of the
classiest bail players, for his size,
the Farm has ever seen, was
yanked from the bench where he
didn't belong, and put in at for
ward. Diminutive "Mike" tallied
20 points.
Kenny Davidson and Bill Niccols
proved to be a good pair of guards,
and Don Williams' work at the other
forward post was, as usual, excel
lent.
Now, Wytze, you've got a real
ball team.—Gene Gear.

STANFORD BOWLING
LADDER LOOMS
Besides this week-end's match,
there are a few matches pending:
Alpha Sig-Chi Psi; Alpha Sig-Kappa
fcig-Daily Sports Staff; Daily Sports
Staff-Angelenos; and Daily Sports
Staff-Daily Business Stalf.
A match consists of four men on
each team howling three lines.
The final score is determined by
adding all scores for both teams.
There is no contest between indi
viduals ... it is a team average,'
Next week we hope to inaugurate
a Stanford Bowling Ladder, to be
printed in The Daily once or twice
a week. Teams may then challenge
one or two teams above them on the
ladder. As soon as a few of the pend
ing matches are played off, we will
know approximately where to place
the teams on the first ladder.
As soon as matches are played if
the captain of the winning team will
notify me at 8767 or 22166 of the
final score, team members, and in
dividual high scores, etc., a short
account of the match will be printed
in The Daily and the ladder ad

I ROSH ACCOMPLISH
COMPLETE REVERSAL
One of the biggest upsets and
greatest form reversals, on the Farm
this school year transpired in the
Pavilion Wednesday night, when a
none-too-flashy frosh basketball
team suddenly came out of the
weeds to smash a supposedly strong
Ban Mateo J. C. team into submis
sion, 63-21.
The yearling 1 - didn't look too im
pressive in nosing out a close one
over Marin J. C., and then looked
pretty feeble indeed, losing last
week-end to a pair of good high
school teams.
Wednesday night the Encina asy
lum inmates scored more points than
they could muster in both games
last week. The reason . . . Coach
Wytze Gorter juggled his lineup
around and found a combination
that should sweep anything off the
courts, especially those Cal Cubs.
DON BURNESS COMES
INTO ins OWN
Don Burness, rated last year as the
best high school player San Fran
cisco had seen since Luisetti, was
pulled from his obscure guard post
and put where he belongs ... at
center. Don tanked 19 points.
Little Bill Marshall, one of the
classiest bail players, for his size,
the Farm has ever seen, was
yanked from the bench where he
didn't belong, and put in at for
ward. Diminutive "Mike" tallied
20 points.
Kenny Davidson and Bill Niccols
proved to be a good pair of guards,
and Don Williams' work at the other
forward post was, as usual, excel
lent.
Now, Wytze, you've got a real
ball team.—Gene Gear.
