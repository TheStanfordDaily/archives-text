PASADENA, Jan. 20 (UP). â€”The
amateur division of the $3000 Pasa- j

.swinging down the Brookside fair
ways today. Professionals start off !
tomorrow.
Practically the only big name
among the amateurs was that of i
George Zaharias, who got that name \
in wrestling, not golf. [
Ed Dudley and Denny Shutc, who
missed the first two stands on the !
western winter circuit, arrived last
night to enter the professional divi
sion. The field will be cut to 120 pro
fessionals and 30 amateurs for the
second-round on Saturday.
