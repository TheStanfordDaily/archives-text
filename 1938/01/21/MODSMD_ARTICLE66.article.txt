# Ward Stars in All-University Boxing Tourney
## Fast Fights Featured In Many Bouts Keusseff, Haffner Win In Wrestling Matches Tournament Finals 
### 
John Ward, cool frosh boxer, beat
Slan Anderson last night for the
all-University heavyweight title and
was carried triumphantly from the
ring on the shoulders of proud class
of '41 men.
An estimated crowd of 12,000
watched Ward easily out-point An
derson, last year's winner, as a cli
max to a full evening of boxing and
wrestling championship bouts.
Steve Keusseff won the heavy
weight wrestling championship, get
ting two quick falls on J. Dignun.
Light Heavyweight John Haffner
was the only other wrestler to win
by pinning his opponent, A. Engle
hard.
Gallarneau Wins
Hugh Gallarneau, winning all the
way by a scanty margin, won the
175-pound class title over lial (Dub
ber) Saunders in one of the most
professional looking fights of the
evening. He won, as all the boxing
winners did this year, by deci
sion.
Doug Grant and Carleton Boyd,
165 pounds, put on possibly the most
exciting bout of the evening, with
the exception of the Ward-Anderson
battle. Southpaw Grant won the
slugfest—and it actually was a slug
fest.
There were a surprising amount
of good fights all down the line last
night. For the 155-pound title, solid
hitting John Pease out-pointed Mac
"Got-the-Jitters" Pope in one of the
many close battles last night.
Wilbur Victor
In a fight that seemed a trifle
slow in comparison to the bouts that
preceded and followed it, Bill Wil
bur, last year's varsity captain,
gave Charles Mclntyre a boxing les
son—a boxing lesson in which you
couldn't always be quite sure who
was the teacher—and won the deci
sion. Their fighting was definitely
not of the back alley variety.
Frank (Quail) White won a slam
bang fight over Park Kimball, who
was knocked down in the first round
but came back strongly to threaten
White in the next two rounds. The
135-pound crown was at stake.
Most surprising win of the evening
was scored by Thad Bell over Jerry
James in the 125-pound class.
Knocked down by a good, solid hit
in the first round, he came back to
halve the second round and to deci
sively win the last round and the
title.
Medals Awarded .
Bruce Berg and Larry Spain open
ed the boxing card with a rather un
eventful fight. Berg won the fight
and the 115-pound title.
