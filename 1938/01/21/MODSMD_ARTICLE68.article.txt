CAIRO. Egypt, Jan. 20 (UP). —
Farouk I, youthful monarch of 16,-
000.000 Egyptians, signed his name
to a wedding contract today in a
"brideless" ceremony which gave
the Nile its "most beautiful queen
since Cleopatra." The ancient Mo
hammedan ritual excluding all wo
men from the ceremony, even the
bride—the lovely 17-year-old Sar
ir.az Zulficar — was held in the
drawing room of Koubbeh Palace,
the first wedding of a reigning king
of Egypt since the Pharaohs.
Young Farouk. who will be 18 on
Feb. 11, signed his name to the wed
ding parchment and a moment later
a white flag was unfurled atop the
palace and the cannon of the Cairo
Garrison roared a royal salute.
Egypt, under the country's year-old
constitution, will have the first in
dependent sovereigns in four cen
turies.
