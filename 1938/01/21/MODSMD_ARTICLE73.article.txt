# Cal Refuses To Shift Game To S.F. Site
## U. C. Manager Declares Berkeley Gym Large Enough For All Fans 
### 
With the refusal of University of
California Executive Committee
Wednesday to transfer one of Cal's
home basketball games with Stan
ford to San Francisco Civic Audi-
torium provided Stanford did the
same, all rumors on the situation
were terminated.
Because of agitation on the part of
John Public to get Stanford's team
on a court where the fans outside of
the rooters would have a chance to
see Captain Hank Luisetti play,
Graduate Manager Al Masters,
made the reciprocatory proposal to
California.
However, it was turned down on
the suggestion of Kenneth Priestley,
California graduate manager, who
said that the Berkeley gym "holds
almost as many spectators as the
San Francisco auditorium and would
only put the students to needless
expense in crossing the bay."
He failed in his reply to answer
the gripe of John Public that the
students buy all seats in both gyms
before the outsiders have a chance
at them. A.S.U.C. made the sug
gestion, according to Priestley, that
Stanford put both its home games
in San Francisco, but that was
turned down as a situation giving
Cal too much edge in court famil-
iarty.
Despite the stewing around over
the subject evident in San Francisco
papers recently, the games will be
played as originally scheduled â€”
two in the Pavilion and two in Ed
wards Gym at Berkeley.
