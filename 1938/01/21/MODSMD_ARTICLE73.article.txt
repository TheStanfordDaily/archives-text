# Cal Refuses To Shift Game To S.F. Site
## U. C. Manager Declares Berkeley Gym Large Enough For All Fans 
### 
With the refusal of University of j
California Executive Committeel
Wednesday to transfer one of Cal's j
home basketball games with Stan
ford to San Francisco Civic Audi- i
torium provided Stanford did the
siime, all rumors on the situation
were terminated.
Because of agitation on the part of ;
John Public to get Stanford's team !
on a court where the fans outside of j
the rooters would have a chance to ;
see Captain Hank Luisetti play,
Graduate Manager A1 Masters,
made the reciprocatory proposal to j
California.
However, it was turned down on |
;he suggestion of Kenneth Priestley, j
California graduate manager, who ]
said that the Berkeley gym "holds j
almost as many spectators as the |
San Francisco auditorium and would ;
only put the students to needless \
expense in crossing the bay."
He failed in his reply to answer j
the gripe of John Public that the
students buy all seats in both gyms j
before the outsiders have a chance i
at them. A.S.U.C. made the sug
gestion, according to Priestley, that
Stanford put both its home games 1
in San Francisco, but that was j
turned down as a situation giving
Cal too much edge in court famil- j
iarty.
Despite the stewing around over j
the subject evident in San Francisco ;
papers recently, the games will be
played as originally scheduled — !
two in the Pavilion and two in Ed
wards Gym at Berkeley.
