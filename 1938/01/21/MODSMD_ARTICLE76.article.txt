### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 20 (UP). —
James J. Braddock, the "cinderella
man" of the prize ring, hits the
comeback trail again tomorrow
night but the odds arc overwhelm
ing against his ever regaining the
heavyweight title.
Others have tried before—Corbett,
Jeffries, Willard and Dempsey—and
all fell short of the goal. Neverthe
less, Braddock will test his fighting
weapons against Tommy Farr, the
rugged Welshman.
Less than four years ago, when
he was 28 and considered a "has
been," Braddock began a comeback
that whirled him from relief rolls to
the championship. He hasn't had a
fight since last June 22, when he
was knocked out by Joe Louis.
Farr, eight years Braddock's jun
ior, also has been idle since he faced
Louis. That was last August when
"Tonypandy" Tommy amazed every
one by staying 15 rounds with the
champion in Louis' first defense.
The betting odds favor Farr by
about 8-5. They v/ere 11-5 but
dropped sharply when Braddock be
gan to show good form in workouts
late last week. The winner is sched
uled to meet Former Champion Max
Baer on March 11, although both
already have beaten Maxie.
