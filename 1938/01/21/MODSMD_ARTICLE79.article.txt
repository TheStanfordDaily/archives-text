## ... And How Are Things In England?

Mr. Gordon Lange
London, England
Dear Mr. Lange:
You'll probably be surprised to hear from me,
but I thought you might like to get the coldies
on what is going on back here at the Farm.
Anyway, I hate to talk behind your back.
I doubt very much if you have heard the re
sounding squish with which your "corking good
comedy," that smash hit of 1901 (which has not
been produced since), has flopped on the stage
of the Little Theater.
Last night "The Governor's Wife" was given
everything it had by a cast of 27, chosen by
yourself as the men and women best fitted for
such a production. And last night, at the second
of a scheduled six performances, a meager au
dience of 60 chuckled once or twice and then
sat stonily through greater part of the "comedy."
Even the kids in the play are bored and wor
ried about playing before four more empty
houses. One of them complained that it was
like going to bat in the ninth inning of the last
game of the World Series—with no bat.
What I can't understand, Mr. Lange, is why
the devil you picked a work which hasn't been
produced for 37 years and stands unproved in
the field of modern dramatics. There was a
chance it might be sensational—but a better
chance that there was a reason for the 37-year
collection of dust.
I'll admit that it made things difficult to

' change directors in the middle of the stream,
but I'm told that Mr. Heberer is carrying out the
plans which you laid last quarter. I remember
that just before you left you told me, "It'll de
velop."
I surely hope it does, but there isn't much
time left, and most of us feel that right now it's
quite underdeveloped.
Things wouldn't be so tough if the Depart
, ment of Speech and Drama weren't hard up. But
I'm told it's in no shape financially to pay SB5
royalties for box-office flops. Maybe it's true
1 that you don't like most of the really modern
stuff, but you know as well as I do that some
thing like "Boy Meets Girl" would be 8.0.K.
and still would be good experience. And the
best thing is that the royalties on the Spewacks'
hit play are lower than those on "The Gover
nor's Wife."
However, if you don't go for that kind of
thing, what about some of the older fellows.
Ibsen's not so bad, nor are Pirandello and a
lot of others—and ther eare no royalties on some
of their plays.
Otherwise things are sort of quiet back here
on the Farm. Roble had a little revolution against
the sorority system last week, and Saturday the
"Laughing Boys" dropped a tough one to U.S.C.,
but everything else is about the same.
Except "The Governor's Wife"—she's sitting
home nights.
Sincerely,
J.R.

velop."
I surely hope it does, but there isn't much
time left, and most of us feel that right now it's
quite underdeveloped.
Things wouldn't be so tough if the Depart
, ment of Speech and Drama weren't hard up. But
I'm told it's in no shape financially to pay SB5
royalties for box-office flops. Maybe it's true
1 that you don't like most of the really modern
stuff, but you know as well as I do that some
thing like "Boy Meets Girl" would be 8.0.K.
and still would be good experience. And the
best thing is that the royalties on the Spewacks'
hit play are lower than those on "The Gover
nor's Wife."
However, if you don't go for that kind of
thing, what about some of the older fellows.
Ibsen's not so bad, nor are Pirandello and a
lot of others—and ther eare no royalties on some
of their plays.
Otherwise things are sort of quiet back here
on the Farm. Roble had a little revolution against
the sorority system last week, and Saturday the
"Laughing Boys" dropped a tough one to U.S.C.,
but everything else is about the same.
Except "The Governor's Wife"—she's sitting
home nights.

Dear Mr. Lange:
You'll probably be surprised to hear from me,
but I thought you might like to get the coldies
on what is going on back here at the Farm.
Anyway, I hate to talk behind your back.
I doubt very much if you have heard the re
sounding squish with which your "corking good
comedy," that smash hit of 1901 (which has not
been produced since), has flopped on the stage
of the Little Theater.
Last night "The Governor's Wife" was given
everything it had by a cast of 27, chosen by
yourself as the men and women best fitted for
such a production. And last night, at the second
of a scheduled six performances, a meager au
dience of 60 chuckled once or twice and then
sat stonily through greater part of the "comedy."
Even the kids in the play are bored and wor
ried about playing before four more empty
houses. One of them complained that it was
like going to bat in the ninth inning of the last
game of the World Series—with no bat.
What I can't understand, Mr. Lange, is why
the devil you picked a work which hasn't been
produced for 37 years and stands unproved in
the field of modern dramatics. There was a
chance it might be sensational—but a better
chance that there was a reason for the 37-year
collection of dust.
I'll admit that it made things difficult to

' change directors in the middle of the stream,
but I'm told that Mr. Heberer is carrying out the
plans which you laid last quarter. I remember
that just before you left you told me, "It'll de
velop."
I surely hope it does, but there isn't much
time left, and most of us feel that right now it's
quite underdeveloped.
Things wouldn't be so tough if the Depart
, ment of Speech and Drama weren't hard up. But
