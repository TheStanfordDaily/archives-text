# Cyclical Sabotage

LAST year the campus opinion columns on
this page filled up and overflowed because
the 9 o'clock closing hour at the Post Office was
considered too early. It seemed a legitimate
complaint, but the Postmaster had a snappy
comeback. It was that the Post Office had been
damaged when the closing hour was set at 12.
Recently, however, the Postmaster relented
and mail was again available until midnight.
More recently, at a meeting of Men's Council,
the Postmaster reported that history was re
peating itself. Pen throwing, placard defacing,
and other high crimes and misdemeanors were
again late evening sports in the Post Office
lobby. If they didn't stop, he declared, more
history would be repeated in the form of a

renewed 9 o'clock closing hour.
This, inevitably, would result in more campus
opinion letters to complete the phase.
Of course, campus opinions are always wel
come. On the other hand, pen throwing and
placard defacing might stop, which would be
unnatural, but pleasing to all concerned.—L. L.
