IT ISN'T often that we get a chance to chide Presi
dent Roosevelt for hiding his brilliant light under
s bushel like some self-conscious Republican. Usual
ly when our F.D.R. does something there is a great
blowing of horns and snapping of flashlights; and the
post office department prints up a new stamp. But
facts which have come to light recently prove that
quietly, like some reticent fairy godmother, our Presi
dent has been sponsoring an educational program that
should make John Harvard rise from the grave and
tip his cocked hat.
It is inevitable that when the facts are known,
Rooseelt will be offered a post on every faculty in the
country. And the Social Security Act will be listed
in every announcement of courses.

It all follows logically from one of the basic prin
ciples which dear alma mater has used as a good rock
foundation for her temple. "The purpose of college is
to teach you how much you don't know." This il
legitimate brain child has been adopted by so many
professors and has been presented to so many students
with loving paternalism that it has become almost a
motto of education. And if we accept this principle,
we must give Roosevelt the post of greatest educator
of all time. He is certainly teaching us a lot about
how much we don't know.
Latest example is the "hasher" tax which the social
security boys insist on collecting, making noises each
month like a mass meeting of Shylocks. I am told by
the manager of an eating club that nobody understands
this bit of legislation. The idea seems to be that since
the hashers are working for their living they should
put. by a little fund with the government so they can
buy cigarettes when they are 65. This much is clear
enough, but from here on in the fog gets thicker.

r jPHE eating groups are frank, and say that they can't
understand the mechanics of payment. The hash
ers are frustrated and say to hell with it. The state
sends out instructions that read like an accounting syl
labus. And the University comptroller sends out in
structions that look like a C.P.A. exam.
The trouble seems to center around the fact that
the hashers are paid no money. So far nobody has
been able to establish rapport with the authorities so
that they can get this idea over. The tax collectoi's de
mand one per cent of the v/ages. The hashers say
they have no wages. The house managers are still
trying to figure out what the University says. They
can't tell from its instructions.

The hashers point out that they have no money.
But the law says pay. It hasn't yet been decided
whether or not the collectors will be satisfied with
one per cent of a salad, and three baked potatoes a
month. But doubters have pointed out that it would
complicate the bookkeeping no end. Probably the
state auditor wouldn't like it.
And so it becomes obvious that the government is
doing a lot to teach us how much we don't know. The
house managers don't know how they are going to pay.
The hashers don't know why. The University doesn't
know how to explain.

Another beauty of the situation is that its educa
tional value is reciprocal. Perhaps the government
will leant how much it doesn't know when it tries to
figure out how to make the scheme work.
It's all excellent training for the mind. Doubtless
Roosevelt will rank from now on with those who have
made great contributions to culture Abelard and
lleloise, Gilbert and Sullivan, Haijf and Haig.
