All college papers have traditional windmills with
which they fence when things set-in too quiet. Re
cently the Daily Trojan revived an old campaign
against the sale of "breezy" magazines by the Student
Union. Flustered by the increased sale of such maga
zines following publication of a recent article, S.C.'s
editorial writer is here careful to mention the names
of no such publications.—The Editor.

When the Daily Trojan printed an editorial last
year calling attention to the cheap type of magazines
which are displayed and sold in the Student Union, it
named a number of these publications and cited para
graphs which were excellent examples of bad taste.
But as these publications were named by the paper
at that time, it developed that our indignation was
ironically an excellent medium for advertising those
magazines. However, the magazines which we named
are still being sold and the same degenerates seem to
be editing and writing the publications.
Those in charge of the University magazine stand
did nothing about improving this situation last year.
But as we sincerely believe that many of the magazines
are not representative of a university, we again sug
gest that certain Hollywood, and other "breezy" mag
azines be banned from display and sale.
After our first editorial on this subject it was
argued by one of the attendants at the magazine stand
that since there were students who liked the degraded
tawdry type of literature, that this constituted justi
fication for its sale; we did not concur then and we do
not concur now.
Certainly, we realize that there is a certain type of
student mind in this university which loves the cheap
and trivial, for only last week we heard this mind ob
ject to raising the university's standards for scholar
ship. But because this type of mind does exist upon
this campus, (he University magazine stand should not
encourage it by catering to its desires.
The students are often told that the Student Union
is their enterprise; if this is so, we believe that we are
voicing the opinion of (he majority of (he students
when we again suggest that the magazine stand pro
hibit the display and sale of those magazines which are
in bad taste.
If any assistance is needed by the magazine at
tendants in selecting those magazines which we have
branded as cheap, base, and tawdry, the Daily Trojan
will gladiy submit a list of the publications which is
not representative of the standards upheld by any in
stitute of higher learning.

All college papers have traditional windmills with
which they fence when things set-in too quiet. Re
cently the Daily Trojan revived an old campaign
against the sale of "breezy" magazines by the Student
Union. Flustered by the increased sale of such maga
zines following publication of a recent article, S.C.'s
editorial writer is here careful to mention the names
of no such publications.—The Editor.

When the Daily Trojan printed an editorial last
year calling attention to the cheap type of magazines
which are displayed and sold in the Student Union, it
named a number of these publications and cited para
graphs which were excellent examples of bad taste.
But as these publications were named by the paper
at that time, it developed that our indignation was
ironically an excellent medium for advertising those
magazines. However, the magazines which we named
are still being sold and the same degenerates seem to
be editing and writing the publications.
Those in charge of the University magazine stand
did nothing about improving this situation last year.
But as we sincerely believe that many of the magazines
are not representative of a university, we again sug
gest that certain Hollywood, and other "breezy" mag
azines be banned from display and sale.
After our first editorial on this subject it was
argued by one of the attendants at the magazine stand
that since there were students who liked the degraded
tawdry type of literature, that this constituted justi
fication for its sale; we did not concur then and we do
not concur now.
Certainly, we realize that there is a certain type of
student mind in this university which loves the cheap
and trivial, for only last week we heard this mind ob
ject to raising the university's standards for scholar
ship. But because this type of mind does exist upon
this campus, (he University magazine stand should not
encourage it by catering to its desires.
The students are often told that the Student Union
is their enterprise; if this is so, we believe that we are
voicing the opinion of (he majority of (he students
when we again suggest that the magazine stand pro
hibit the display and sale of those magazines which are
in bad taste.
If any assistance is needed by the magazine at
tendants in selecting those magazines which we have
branded as cheap, base, and tawdry, the Daily Trojan
will gladiy submit a list of the publications which is
not representative of the standards upheld by any in
stitute of higher learning.
