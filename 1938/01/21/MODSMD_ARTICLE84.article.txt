## CIVILIAN ON REVOLT 
### 
Editor of The Stanford Daily:
To us civilians, the now historic
Stanford sorority revolution was
partly a failure and partly a success.
It was a failure in that it produced
no maid in shining armor who could
restore the realm to democracy. And
it was a success to the extent that it
provided a medium for the voice of
the Zeitgeist to reach those vulgar
co-eds who enjoy the cruel sport of
pressing down a thorny crown of
snobbery on the brow of their alma
mater. Yours very truly,
Robert Elder.
