The Editor, Sir:
What does "The Governor's Wife''
have that makes Stanford students
get up on a stage for six nights in a
row and make fools out of them
selves? Nothing. If they have to get
up on the stage they should at least
have something worthy of their ef
forts.
This play wouldn't last one night
even in Podunk, but they put it on
for six at Stanford. This is truly a
Farm, one way up in the mountains
where the hill billies come from.
This play has nothing, no depth,
no plot worthy to be called such,
but it does have words, plenty of
them, which the players said as
best they could.
Stanford used to be noted for the
plays it put on, but after this at
tempt, one wonders how we ever
gained such a good reputation in
dramatics. Is this why Gordon
Lange went to Europe? It might be,
at that.
