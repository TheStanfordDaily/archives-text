# Leslie Howard Does Romeo In Modern Farce
## 
### 
"IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER." starling
tomorrow at the Varsity Theater.
"It's Love I'm After" is a modern
comedy starring Leslie Howard.
Many screen and stage fans may
wonder what Mr. Howard, famed
Shakespearean actor, is doing in a
modern comedy, especially with
such a title. And in the opening
scene the audience is sure some
misleading advertisement has been
perpetuated, for there is our Mr.
Howard doing his regular routine in
the death scene from "Romeo and
Juliet."
However, the spell of the old Bard
is quickly broken, when Romeo,
whispering words of love to the
dead Juliet (Bette Davis) almost has
his ear bitten oil by the aforemen
tioned "dead" young lady.
The curtain fails on the play, and
the comedy begins. If you ever
wondered what actors do after the
play is over, "It's Love I'm After"
will tell you. "Romeo" Howard and
"Juliet" Davis are that way off the
stage, too, but many a time through
the picture one decides that love
certainly has queer ways of mani
festing itself.
Many hilarious moments are spent
by Leslie Howard and his faithful
butler (Eric Blore) as they try to
evade the stage-struck Olivia de
Haviland. The more cold-shoulder
ing Mr. Howard tries on the girl, the
more she seemingly falls in love
with him. He didn't have enough
time to marry Miss Davis, and now
he wishes he had more time to get
out of marrying Miss De Haviland.
Leslie Howard surprises with his
comedy role, for the part seems to
really fit him. Butler Blore is above
par, as is the highly dramatic Miss
de Haviland. Bette Davis turns in
a good performance, but the Acad
emy Award winner has done a good
deal better in previous roles.
