# SZABO WINS BOUT
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20 (UP). -
Sandor Szabo, Hungarian wrestler,
defeated El Pulp of Mexico last
night. Pulp took the first fall and
then was thrown into the ringside
seats with what Szago calls a "death
swing,' something that somewhat
resembles skinning the cat on a
cross bar. He was pronounced unfit
to continue.
