# Farm Skiers Found After Snowy Night
## Bill Janss Locates Party Beside Fire; Quartet Tells Of Cold, Hunger 
### 
Back at Stanford last night after
being lost for 10 hours in the snow
at Yosemite National Park, four
Stanford skiers told a story of cold,
hunger, and a rescue at 2:30 o'clock
Sunday morning.
In the party were Connie Bohos
key and Ruth Pease, both sopho
mores from Portland, Ore., and Oscar
Waterman and Robert Tyson, both
seniors from San Diego.
The four were found by Bill Janss,
member of the Stanford ski team,
who was one of a rescue party of
25 organized by John Pease, Stanford
student and brother of Miss Pease.
The lost skiers were huddled
around a little fire near the Old
Glacier Point road at Pcregoy
Meadows, two miles from the Badger
Pass ski house at about the 7000-
foot level.
Rescuers Named
When Janss found them, the res
cuers yodeled back and forth until
others reached the lost skiers. Among
the rescuers were Stanford students
Lloyd Davis, Bill Rosenfeld, John
Pease, and Willy Meyer, Stanford ski
coach.
The two co-eds started out at 3
o'clock Saturday afternoon near the
Badger Pass ski house and were
joined on the trail by the two men.
Leaving the path to make a short
cut, they were unable to find the
trail again.
Since it was fast growing dark,
they stopped at 7 o'clock after skiing
several hours through the dry, pow
dered snow in search of the trail.
The mercury was falling and first
attempts to build a fire failed.
In their efforts to build a fire, the
four even resorted to tearing up
Miss Bohoskey's cotton shirt bit by
bit. "It was cold," she said, '"but I
was wearing a sweater over it."
They dug a trail in the snow and
ran up and down to keep warm. It
was just before the rescuers arrived
that the men finally managed to start
the fire.
Signal Fires Built
The night-long search was direct
ed by Park Ranger Frank Givens,
who built fires near the ski house
and along the trails. The searchers
spread out over the area, using
flashlights. Janss and Marin Sten
love, park employe, were the first
to reach the lost skiers.
Despite the long search, Janss com
peted in a downhill race yesterday
morning and won. Also among the
searchers were Hanness Schroll,
world figure in skiing and Jules
Fritsch, another instructor.
Mr. and Mrs. G. N. Pease, parents
of one of the co-eds, arrived in Palo
Alto yesterday. They were already
on their way south from Portland
at the time of the search, not know
ing of their daughter's difficulties.
Following their i-escue, the two
co-eds slept for eight hours and then
went ice skating. They are reported
planning a return trip to Yosemite
in two weeks.
