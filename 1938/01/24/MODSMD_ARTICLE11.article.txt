Abou Bob Hartmann, may his
Chappies increase, awoke last night
from a deep dream of Peace, and
muttered, "Wednesday morning on
the English Corner, stupendous, co
lossal, the best ever, just the right
length, color, humor," and rolled
over.
With the aid of Keeble's and the
Camera Shoppe, Stanford's own hu
mor magazine has been able to se
lect a group of candid camera pic
tures of very high quality. Winners
of the $20 in trade prizes at the two
stores will be announced in the pub
lication, and many picture entries
will be shown.
"Fables of the Farm," "Little Pop
Off," and "Modern Mother Goose,"
together with "Sparks from the Sil
ver Hammer," an old feature re
vived, are some of the specialties in
the first number of winter quarter.
"Collie Small," mumbled the Old
Boy, "writes again despite Hell and
McGuirk. Stompin Around . .
carries on!"
Bob Gillespie has drawft a cartoon
reputed to be Chappie's funniest for
the campus in the next issue. Other
art features are Patty Bosqui's latest
tintype and the cover by Carlson W.
"Jack" Boyd, art editor.
