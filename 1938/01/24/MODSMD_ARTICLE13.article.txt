# Hawaii Shaken By Earthquake
## Shocks Heavy, But No Serious Damage 
### 
HONOLULU, T. Hâ€ž Jan. 23 (UP).
A series of violent earthquakes ac
companied by strange flashes in the
sky shook every major island in the
Hawaiian group shortly before mid
night last night, sending crowds
scurrying from hotels and theaters
and leading to fears that a new vol
canic eruption may be imminent.
The shocks were the most violent
felt in Honolulu in two decades,
and caused landslides and other
damage on outlying islands, but ap
parently resulted in no casualties or
serious damage.
Volcanologists at Kilauea Observ
atory, on the rim of the smoulder
ing crater of Halemaumau on the
islands of Hawaii, were checking
the possibility that the light flashes
were the result of the eruption of a
new crater on towering Mauna Loa,
the largest active volcano in the
world.
There was no evidence, however,
to indicate that the long-expected
blow-off of Mauna Loa had oc
curred. The massive mountain
rises two and a half miles into the
sky and the summit is nearly 60
miles from the seashore and not
easily accessible.
