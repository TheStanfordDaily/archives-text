# Award System To Be Discussed
## 
### 
At house meetings of women's
living groups tonight, representa
tives from the Women's Athletic
Association Board will talk to the
various groups about the system of
award for participating in athletics
now in use at Stanford, and will ask
the opinion of the women about the
system.
It is the opinion of the Board that
the award system as it now stands
is too complicated, and does not
serve the real interests of the wo
men. The Board believes that wo
men come out for athletics mainly
for fun and enjoyment, not to earn
points and awards; the system
should be radically changed, or ab
olished and the Board wishes to
discover the collective opinion of
the women as to what should be
done.
With the "point" system now in
force, the W.A.A. has to spend a
rather large portion of their funds
for the various numerals, blazers,
blankets and trophies awarded each
year. This money, if not spent on
awards, would go towards building
new tennis courts and further im
proving athletic facilities for the
women. '
