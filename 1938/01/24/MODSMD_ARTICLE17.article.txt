## 
### 
William Hawley Davis, Stanford
English professor and editor of the
Stanford University Press, has col
lected nearly 3000 figures of speech
which he will trace over KGO to
night at 9:15 o'clock.
Many of these verbal twists Davis
dates back to prehistoric times.
These include: "back-biting," "skin
ning him alive," "tanning his hide,"
and "let sleeping dogs lie."
Others, the editor says, originate
in the city streets: "right down my
alley," "in on the ground floor,"
"window dressing." The automo
bile has been responsible for "step
on it," and the horse for "raring to
go" and "taking the bit in his teeth."
Professor Davis regards ptinch
lines as "indirect but forceful means
of communication, each involving a
resemblance between the point we
arc making and some matter usu
ally more vivid in the recollection or
the imagination of a speaker and
hearer."
