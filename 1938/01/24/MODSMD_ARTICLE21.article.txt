# Cal, Stanford Plan Joint Peace Day
## 
### 
Plans for the possible cooperation
between Stanford and the Univer
sity of California in celebration of
Peace Day on April 22, were an
nounced over the week-end by
Gerald Marcus, Stanford Peace Day
Committee chairman, and Bernard
Shapiro, University of California
Peace committee chairman.
Marcus, who has just left on a
Stanford debate tour, expressed the
hope that an understanding could
be reached between the two schools
for a joint celebration in which stu
dent speakers for Peace Day exer
cises could be exchanged and stu
dent round table discussions and
forums could be presented over
East Bay radio stations.
"If a common understanding with
Stanford group can be arranged,
the results would add much to the
effectiveness of the day," stated
Shapiro. It is hoped that the ex
change of speakers would be a
means of strengthening relations
between the two universities.
