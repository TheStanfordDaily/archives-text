# Fighting Cal Men 'Hang Mortgage' On Indian Tepee
## Stanford Next To Conference Cellar After Loss To California 
### GENE GEAR 
They went out and hung a mortgage on the old Luisctti & Co. build
ings last Friday night.
Chairman John Runn is going to have to get his hoard of directors
together for some real land-office business in the next few weeks in order
to pull the once-great company off the rocks and onto the top of the

heap.
Stanford's Redskin basketball
varsity led by the dauntless Hank
Luisetti just couldn't get fired up
against a fighting California Bear
outfit and went down to a 47-44 de
feat.
Therein lies the story of the
Cardinal defeat. The Indians just
didn't have any fight . . . the old
pep of the Laughing Boys of the last
two years was lacking, and Nibs
Price's under-rated hoopsters put
the game on ice by taking the ball
away from the pep-less Cards time
and again and making their own
breaks throughout.
Same On Saturday
The same thing happened the fol
lowing night when the men of
Stanford ran up against a tough, but
not spectacular, basketball team
from Moraga Valley . . . the Gallop
ing Gaels of St. Mary's.
The boys trailed through most of
the first half, only to pull up at the
finish for a 19-16 lead. In the sec
ond half it loked like the same old
thing until little Bob Burnett was
injected into the game at guard.
Burnett combined with Hank to
put some real fire into the Cards,
and for the first time in more than
two and a half games, the Indians
clicked somewhere like the cham
pionship team they're rated to be.
Cal Game Thriller
The old fire came back into Art
Stoefen's eyes, and speed coursed
through the system of Jack Calder
wood. The result ... a Stanford
victory by a 42-32 margin.
The Bear game was a thriller from
start to finish with the issue always
in doubt until the last 30 seconds of
play. The Bears jumped into an
early lead, however, and were never
really headed until late in the sec
ond half when Hustlin' Hank led
the Cards to the fore by a full five
points.
The California underdog fight
proved to be too much for the Cards
and the Bears soon caught the In
dians and once more moved into a
slight lead before the final gun.
Hank Watched
In both games Hank was held
down closely in the first half and
did very little shot-making. In the
Cal game he scored four points in
the first period and registered but
two digits in the | St. Mary's clash.
In the second half of both games
Luisetti began to drop them into
the netting. His total for the Cal
game was 14 as he annexed high
scoring honors for the evening. In
the Gael battle he really laid it on
in the second half and piled up a
formidable total of 19 points for the
game.
H. B. Lee's work at guard against
the Bears was heartening to watch.
The diminutive senior jumping jack
played a stellar floor game and
picked up 10 points.
Lumberous Tom Siebert proved to
Cardinal fans in both games that
he'll fill in very nicely during the
next two years. He is invaluable
under the backboard, and otherwise
conducted himself like a top notch
basketball player.
The Indians, now down in third
place in the conference standings
behind Cal and U.S.C., will need to
win all their remaining league games
to cinch the southern division title
they were considered a cinch for
two short weeks ago.

The Indians, now down in third
place in the conference standings
behind Cal and U.S.C., will need to
win all their remaining league games
to cinch the southern division title
they were considered a cinch for
two short weeks ago.
They went out and hung a mortgage on the old Luisctti & Co. build
ings last Friday night.
Chairman John Runn is going to have to get his hoard of directors
together for some real land-office business in the next few weeks in order
to pull the once-great company off the rocks and onto the top of the

heap.
Stanford's Redskin basketball
varsity led by the dauntless Hank
Luisetti just couldn't get fired up
against a fighting California Bear
outfit and went down to a 47-44 de
feat.
Therein lies the story of the
Cardinal defeat. The Indians just
didn't have any fight . . . the old
pep of the Laughing Boys of the last
two years was lacking, and Nibs
Price's under-rated hoopsters put
the game on ice by taking the ball
away from the pep-less Cards time
and again and making their own
breaks throughout.
Same On Saturday
The same thing happened the fol
lowing night when the men of
Stanford ran up against a tough, but
not spectacular, basketball team
from Moraga Valley . . . the Gallop
ing Gaels of St. Mary's.
The boys trailed through most of
the first half, only to pull up at the
finish for a 19-16 lead. In the sec
ond half it loked like the same old
thing until little Bob Burnett was
injected into the game at guard.
Burnett combined with Hank to
put some real fire into the Cards,
and for the first time in more than
two and a half games, the Indians
clicked somewhere like the cham
pionship team they're rated to be.
Cal Game Thriller
The old fire came back into Art
Stoefen's eyes, and speed coursed
through the system of Jack Calder
wood. The result ... a Stanford
victory by a 42-32 margin.
The Bear game was a thriller from
start to finish with the issue always
in doubt until the last 30 seconds of
play. The Bears jumped into an
early lead, however, and were never
really headed until late in the sec
ond half when Hustlin' Hank led
the Cards to the fore by a full five
points.
The California underdog fight
proved to be too much for the Cards
and the Bears soon caught the In
dians and once more moved into a
slight lead before the final gun.
Hank Watched
In both games Hank was held
down closely in the first half and
did very little shot-making. In the
Cal game he scored four points in
the first period and registered but
two digits in the | St. Mary's clash.
In the second half of both games
Luisetti began to drop them into
the netting. His total for the Cal
game was 14 as he annexed high
scoring honors for the evening. In
the Gael battle he really laid it on
in the second half and piled up a
formidable total of 19 points for the
game.
H. B. Lee's work at guard against
the Bears was heartening to watch.
The diminutive senior jumping jack
played a stellar floor game and
picked up 10 points.
Lumberous Tom Siebert proved to
Cardinal fans in both games that
he'll fill in very nicely during the
next two years. He is invaluable
under the backboard, and otherwise
conducted himself like a top notch
basketball player.
