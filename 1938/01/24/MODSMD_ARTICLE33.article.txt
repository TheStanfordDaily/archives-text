# Frosh Hoopsters Down Gael Yearlings, 50-41
## Last Period Rally Brings Victory Papooses Show Good Form, But Have Difficulty In Scoring 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's freshman basketball team is still an unknown quality fol
low inn its 50-11 victory over the St. Mary's yearlings last Saturday night. !
The Gaelets. playing their first game of the season, put up a plucky
'tghl and didn't fall far behind until the Papooses put on a scoring spree :
»l nine straight points midway in the second half to break a 33-33 tie and

up the game.
The Cardinal frosh looked at all
: times like the superior team, but for
some reason it had a hard time to
make the scoreboard acknowledge it.
The whole first half was nip-and
j tuck, ending with Stanford on top,
j 30-27.
Good Passing
Time and again after the Gaelets
has scored baskets, the Papooses
i caught them l'lat-footed with tre
mendous full-floor passes from Don
Burness to Bill Marshall and Don
Williams, which the duo turned into
j easy scores. However, the Cardinal
i defense itself wasn't any too "sharp"
the first half, and St. Mary's, led by
Center Carl Johnson, was continu
ally riddling the Red defense for
easy shots.
In the second half, Stanford set
tled down, and after the Gaelets had
tied the score at 33-33, put on the
steam. Don Burness, Cardinal cen
ter, started the streak with a short
one-hander, and followed with a
charity toss. After Bill Niccolls had
contributed a foul shot, Burness
sank another short one, and Kenny
Davidson drove in for a set-up bas
ket. Bill Marshall scored the ninth
poin twith a foul shot.
Scoring Honors
Burness took high-scoring honoi's
with 16 points, followed by Gael
Carl Anderson with 15. Kenny
Davidson, who turned in an out
i standing game from his guard post,
! tallied 13 digits for Stanford and
Marshall tanked 11. Standing out
for St. Mary's was Pete Spiley, a
guard.
Coach Wytze Gorter will put the
squad through hard practice this
week for next week-end's games
against Galileo and Santa Rosa High
Schools. His main job is to keep the
new first string hustling — some
thing they didn't seem to be doing
the first half of last Saturday's
game.
