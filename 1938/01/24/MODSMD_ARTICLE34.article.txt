SURPRISE! TONER'S 111
SCHOOL WIT RETURNS
Dick Toner, the rabble rousing
rajah of the typewriter, strikes back
at this column with all the scintila
ting wit and high school humor in
his makeup.
In Friday's Daily Cal that mon
arch of coast college sports edi
tors spouts on and on to defend
my cracks about Cal's scholastic
rep and the old adage, "When they
can't go to Stanford they enter
Cal."
Toner turns out a lot of nice
sounding adjectives and a few ex
clamations and very tritely calls me
everything from Low Gear to Re
verse, but quite neatly manages to
say nothing. •
We'd still like the 800-erkeley
sage to ask Cecil Cole what his real
choice of a university is. He quite
tactfully avoided a talk with Cole
before he wrote his little literary
gem.
HEAD MAN STARTS IT,
STOOGE CARRIES ON
He tried his best to defend Hcr
wig . . . you have to give these Bears
credit for trying, anyway. I'd still
like to see Burly Bob's IQ, and I
still think it would be rather inter
esting one way or the other.
Our funny little man across the
mud flats attaches more than a
full column's importance to this
little scholastic beef, which inci
dentally, was started by John
Burd, who serves as editor-in
chief on the sheet Toner works for.
Even the San Francisco Chronicle
picked up Toner's moanings yester
day morning and played around
with it lor several paragraphs.
We've already used up too much
space, publicizing Toner's trash, so
we'll stop right here. We've prob
ably given tlie Bear Boober enough
in these few short paragraphs to
furnish him with enough inflated
griping to fill a few more issues of
the Cal sheet.—Gene Gear.
