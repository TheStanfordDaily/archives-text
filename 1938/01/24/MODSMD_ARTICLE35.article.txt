# Freshmen Star In Swim Meet
## Vitousek Equals Eleven Year Record 
### 
Varsity swimmers defeated a
freshman squad 50-25 in Encina
Pools Saturday, but three yearling
stars stole the meet from their more
experienced elders.
Hoy Vitousek won the 50-yard free
style in 24:8 to equal an 11-year-old
frosh record as he beat Dick Clarke
of the varsity by a fingernail. Vitou
sek came back later to ease out
Charles Wiper and Johnny Brahtz
in the 100-yard event. Wiper, a frosh
dark-horse, had the race won up
until the last five yards, when Vitou
sek nipped him.
Wecden Cracks Records
Bill Wecden has been officially
timed only twice all year, and both
times he has modestly come through
to crack an existing back-stroke
record. Saturday he smashed a uni
versity and freshman 150-yard mark.
He had previously set a new pool,
university and Coast record in a
100-yard time trial.
Varsity Captain Dave Rider finally
eked out a win over teammate Win
Ncedham in the 220-yard free style
in the good time of 2:23. Rider later
two-lapped the entire field to finish
all alone in the 440.
The expected all-varsity finish in
the breast stroke found Don Towne
four yards in front of Bill Hatch who
rallied to take second from Lloyd
Wilson by an inch.

While the varsity won both relays,
the frosh almost got away with the
400-yard free style event. Dick
Clarke came through in his anchor
lap to catch Bill Weeden at the
turn and go on to win in 3:54.
Herb Wooley won second place
by a fraction from Don Stine in
diving. Roy Winkleman was far
ahead of both in points to take top
honors. Stine is a husky freshman
who takes all kinds of chances off the
10-foot board while Wooley com
petes from the one-meter low board.
