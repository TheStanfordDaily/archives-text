### 
Stanford's bid for a California j
Rugby Union championship this ,
year was given an unexpected jolt |
Saturday afternoon when the Uni- :
versity Club of San Francisco battled |
the Indians to a 3-3 tie in a rough, j
hard-fought game on the Farm field, j
University Club, composed of for- I
mer Stanford and California ruggers |
and Jim Hornell, an all-Scotland j
back from the University of Edin- ;
burgh, was expected to give Jim
Wylie's men plenty of trouble, but
as the game progressed, the Club i
team more than lived up to expecta- j
tions and set itself up as a definite j
championship contender.
A free place-kick by Allan Nixon, !
University right wing, from the 25-
yard-line in the last five minutes of j
play provided his team with the
tying point. His score nullified a ;
five-yard try by Stanford's Captain 1
Bill Harrington toward the end of
the first half.
Both teams missed further scor- ,
ing opportunities, the Indians fail- j
ing to make the conversion and a j
free kick and University the point
after try and four penalty kicks.
Jim Grubbs scored two tries and '
Aubrey Austin a try, a conversion, '
and a free kick to lead Stanford's j
junior varsity as it swamped the |
University Club seconds, 33-3. Al- ;
den Ames, Bob Staver, and Jack J
Ellis added tries and Jack Mc- 1
Donough a try and two conversions
to complete the Stanford scoring.
DODGE CITY, Kas., Jan. 23 (UP) !
John Wykoff, 15, broke out of jail
and ran home to his mother. But I
he was no welcome prodigal. She
called the sheriff and a half hour
later John, a youthful burglar, was
back in jail.
