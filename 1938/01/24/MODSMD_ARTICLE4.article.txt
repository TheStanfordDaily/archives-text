EXAMPLE OF Eastman's best moonlight-type photography are
the canoers, top left, paddling across the site of last fall's Big Game
Bonfire. The notice in the center is as traditional around Lagunita as
the Ad Building's il Make All Checks Payable." Top Right, Betty
Finch contemplates an icy plunge; while at the bottom a gallant Rough
steadies the canoe while his companions climb in. (Photos by John
