# DAILY KEGLERS LOSE
## Pi Phis to Enter Tourney 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
At a late hour last night rumors
were floating with great vitality
through various campus gutters to
the effect that a certain Breakers
bowling team had thoroughly and
definitely skunked The Daily Sports
Staff quartet.
The Daily, however, always has
and always will consider rumors as
rumors, and until absolute proof ol
such a defeat is forthcoming, no
mention of such will appear in this
publication. Besides, we had an ofl
day.
Incidentally, all you local yokel
kegler fans are going to have a great
treat come Saturday at 1:30 in the
I usual place. (And are we going to
| have fun!)
j It's a real Bowl Classic: The
| Daily Sports Staff vs. The Pi Phi
Palookas.
Heading the female team (the Pi

Phis) will be Captain Lily Bell
Couts. Cap'n Lil is the only def
inite starter, although the other
three bowlers will most likely be
Gerry Reed, Janet Brownell, and
Helen Zwick. The Palookas plan to
bring every member down to foifn a
rooting section. Oooooh boy!
Sports Staffers on the team will
be Gene Gear, Walt Peterson, Harry
Press, and Phil Klauber.
