## Extra-Curricular On the Skids? 
### 
WHEN Ex Committee last spring asked lor a
constitutional amendment limiting the
number of activities one person could engage
in, Stanford refused the request. That such a
ruling was considered high school stuff might
have caused the refusal, but the request itself
may have meant that a new era had begun.
To strengthen the latter view are signs re
layed from other colleges which seem to show
that last spring's flurry was more than a lover's
quarrel between the students and their dearest
possessions, unlimited participation in extra
curricular activities and student self govern
ment. The long honeymoon during which the
undergraduate wooed and won the freedom to
run his own affairs might be over. At least two
colleges are taking action that could be inter
preted as leading to divorce.
At Minnesota, the student senate recently
passed a detailed ruling governing participation
in activities. No other offices will be permitted
students holding certain enumerated grade A
positions. And at U.S.C., there is agitation for
a one-point-five, or C plus, grade requirement
lor student officers.
If conditions at Stanford, traditional strong
hold of free and untrammeled student- partici
pation in extra-curricular work, are indicative,
it's not abuses that have prompted executive
committees to pull in their ears. Rather, they
seem to think that, over a period of years, they
have bitten off too much.
Neither of the two proposed regulations would

affect Stanford office-holders seriously. There
are no cases of persons holding two jobs. Nine
of 30 major officials would be ousted by the
grade requirement, but of these only one is
actually minus in the Bawlout. The others are
within a few points of the average.
If conditions at the other colleges are similar,
the regulations are hardly prompted by misuse
of privilege, but they might be interpreted as a
general protest against the increasing amount
of work that student activities entail.
Controlling so many phases of student life as
they do, officials find their jobs to be big ones.
Student presidents nowadays have their own
offices with large desks. The position and re
sponsibility are honors, but a lot of time must
be put in behind the desks.
Publications, especially, give their executives
the problem of getting an education and con
ducting a business enterprise at the same time.
Demands for salaries show the tendency to re
gard running a newspaper not as an honor, but
as a chore. That the demands usually have been
granted shows the agreement of executive com
mittees.
The trouble seems to be that the fight is over.
Outside of taking over the chair of the presi
dent of the university, there is little that stu
dents are not allowed to do. With nothing left
to battle for, leaders are considering the spoils
of victory and finding them a little hollow; their
birthright a mess of pottage and a lot of hard
work.â€”L. L.
