JEEVES, FETCH ME MY EIGHT-BALL
IF, AT any time, the psychology department finds
that the white rats are on strike and that the con
ditioned dogs would rather fight than salivate at the
sound of a gong, I suggest that they investigate the
effects of the Sunday comics on American youth.
There have already been several studies along that
line, but most of them have been superficial.
It is quite common to have some problem child pop
up from behind a bush, ruin your collar with a water
gun, and inform you with lovable glee that Buck
Rogers has just sprayed you with liquid helium. Psy
chology has disposed of such cases nicely. It says
that they result from deficient secondary models; and
suggest off the record that if used properly a belt or
fence picket will work an astounding change in char
acter.

But psychology has ignored completely the effects
of the Sunday comics on men of college age. And here,
I think, they have overlooked a field that properly
cultivated would tie knots in the supply curve for
Ph.D. theses.
From what observations I have been able to make,
I would conclude that the comics are imbuing Ameri
can youth with a deep-seated inferiority complex.
Personally, I emerge from a bout with the colored
sheets feeling like something that God made for prac
tice and neglected to destroy only because he couldn't
find me afterwards.

4 |NE glance at Brick Bradford makes me feel that
if I were twins I couldn't reach the gutter stand
ing on my shoulders. When I last left the dauntless
Brick, he was doing a neat bit of Australian crawl in
flying togs, toward a floating plane a half mile away.
Immediately before that he had fought his way through
a terrific storm in the clouds, fallen some 10.000 feet,
and had been battered about by waves like liquid Alps.
A story like that depresses me. I cannot deny to
myself that in the same situation I would have gone
down quietly for the third time, failing in the trust
my public placed in me.

And then, there's Flash Gordon, who is continually
getting gassed, or having a foot or so of lance shoved
into him. He always keeps his feet and slaps his op
ponent flat. Last month when I cut my finger on a
razor blade I turned in record time to the B.A.C. and
stayed close to the iodine bottle for the next week.
The noble Flash plays hell with my ego.
And, I imagine, Flash and Brick are a bit hard on
all of us. Picture the half-back who has been carried
off the field on a shutter after that Mack truck in the
opposing backfield made a pass at him. He feels like
a pretty brave man until he sees Fhsh putting a couple
of halbard-headed rhinosorkuses in their place, and
strolling off afterward without even a headache.

I can't tell what influence these duo-tone heroes
have on the women. But I am opposed to it on prin
ciple. I feel quite sure that on more than one occa
sion, that heart-breaker, Bradford, has come between
me and the darling of my heart. And I also imagine
that many a poor girl eats her heart out with envy of
the glamorous consorts of our knights of the Sunday
supplement.
In fact, the one comforting feature of the comic
page is Mickey Mouse. He may be invincible among
his own kind. But we all know what would happen
if some villain stood him to a bowl of Rough-on-Rats.
Perhaps psychologists will b? able to save our col
lective sdf-esteem by persuading the government to
equip every home with a mouse-trap. John Cobbs,
