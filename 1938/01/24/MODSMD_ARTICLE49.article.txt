# A 						POINT WE LOVE TO ARGUE
## 
### 
When last week we printed in these columns a
short editorial on the Bryn Mawr plan and Stanford
University, we little expected to stir Stanford Daily
Editor Gordy Frost and the entire Stanford campus
into the lather of an anti-Californian editor campaign.
The paragraph that stung the souls of Stanford's
gentlemen follows: "This proposition (for full pay
ment of tuition) will probably be viewed with cynical
amusement by Californians accustomed to free tuition
at state expense. There is evident irony in this situa
tion where parents will be requested to add an honor
arium to the $345 per annum they must now pay for
an education inferior to that offered by the state."
Editor Frost turned on the heat to comment: "Editor
Burd's generalization concerning the inferiority of
Stanford education to that of the state is neither a
good generalization, in good taste, nor in good sense.
Education is an intangible commodity. Which univer
sities offer the most of it, is a question no one, not
even the Daily Californian editor, can hope to answer
intelligently. Both Stanford and California rank high,
but the country's best educators would squirm like
poisoned pups before they'd put either on top."
You bet they would, Gordy . . . And we'll bet that
Walter Crosby Eells, prominent STANFORD educator,
squirmed like a poisoned daschund pup when, for
"School and Society magazine," he ranked the Uni
versity of California number one on a list of "higher
educational institutions adequately staffed and
equipped for work for the doctorate in specific fields."
I)r. Eells probably squirmed even more violently
when he was forced by his large and distinguished
collaborating committee to rank Stanford number 12,
and in the second class.
By 1937, three years after his first report, Dr. Eells,
still professor of education at Stanford, made a new
survey, this time a ranking of graduate schools. He
placed California first among public institutions and
one of the five most outstanding universities in the
country.
And in 1937, squirming Dr. Eells decided that Stan
ford did not deserve the number 12 ranking and moved
that institution down to number 15!
Assuming that Editor Frost will consider Dr. Eells
poisoned by his long association with Stanford, we
publish the findings of Dr. Edwin R. Embee, president
of the Julius Rosenwald foundation. Embee places
California fourth and OMITS STANFORD FROM
HIS CLASSIFICATION.
Naturally, Editor Frost should understand that we
are proceeding on the same basis as were Dr.s. Eells and
Embee. As Dr. Embee said in commenting on his
selection, "We are considering university scholarship,
not college life.—When we are considering the schol
arly eminence of universities, the country club aspects
of undergraduate life are not relevant."
/ Perhaps Gordy Frost ignored this point when he
irrelevantly maintains that "Stanford's waiting list is
still long enough to keep the demand curve for di
plomas well off the base line." And if he is correct, we
can only comment that you can fool some of the people
some of the time —even about education.
