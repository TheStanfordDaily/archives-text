The Editoi\ Sir:
Please accept one apology for our esteemed editor's editorial with
regard to your University. I am sure that it would take but little effort
to secure many pages of signatures to this letter.
My hope is that there is not a single one on your campus who
would for one moment think that our editor's attitude reflects the
common regard of this student body for your University. We are all
aware of the fact that in number of first-rate scholars our campus ex
ceeds yours, that in number of outstanding departments this University
has more etc.—so what?
We are also aware of the fact that our University, unfortunately, is
a great deal larger than yours, is a State University, and that many
worthy gentlemen see fit to pay your larger tuition often by the sweat
of the brow rather than attend here.
It is difficult to find students here who do not have he highest
regard for your school in spite of their well-deserved loyalties to this
school.
Yours for increased fellowship,
Berkeley, Calif. C. L. Russell, '38.
