# THOSE BLOCK 'S' CARDS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
All I know is what they say in
the newspapers . . . BUT if the pa
pers are correct and the "S" cards
have been withdrawn from circu
lation, you can prepare for a 10-
round bout with me for proposing
this petty scheme.
The report said the University is
losing $3000 per year by allowing
Block "S" men to use their cards.
Let's forget individuals and look
at this proposition from a long
range standpoint . . . and not at a
little sack of 3000 paltry dollars.
My use of the card has always
been to take some prospective high
school or junior college athlete to a
game . . . and that has been eight
times in 16 years.

Let's be big enough, Al, to forget
a dollar sign and do something for
the Block "S" boys as long as they
live if they have given something to
Stanford.
Personally, I nearly flunked out
my last final quarter in 1921, when
a group of volunteer football men
laid down our books and made
stump speeches for the building of
the present Stadium. Sure, we put
it over and are proud to have had
a part in the achievement for the
kids of today.
Take my card privilege away . . .
and I'll start grooming my boy for
any other school on the coast . . .
including U.S.C. (and that's the last
straw).
Sincerely and sentimentally yours,
Howard E. Deems '21.
