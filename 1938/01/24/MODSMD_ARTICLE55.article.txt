"Tobacco Road," Curran Theater,
San Francisco: This late and blight
ed blossoming of a hardy perennial
not only made unfortunate doggerel
of a whole first act, but a complete
fool of the playwright.
The kind of uneasy snicker that
rippled through the audience on

"Tobacco Road's"
first appearance
two years ago gave
way this time to a
variety of belly
la ugh peculiar
to bald head row
at Minskey's. In
short, "Tobacco
Road's" grim por
nography has been
transformed into
just plain smut.

Granted that the play is enough
of an institution to burlesque; grant
ed its susceptible exaggerations —
still there are certain elements here
that simply are not funny. There is
an essential tragedy — compact and
sanguine—of a man who happened
to love the starved sand which he
tilled. Two of its chief characters
are a half-wit and a hare-lip. In

the third act, an old woman lies
mangled in the road-way while her
husband curls up on the stoop.
True. John Barton, who plays the
grubby old lecher, Jeeter, has his
moments. But they are brief and
scarce. On the whole, one might
expect something considerably less
chipper from a hungry man. Aida,
his wife, intones her part like a
tired priest administering extreme
unction, or a high school actress do
ing Lady Macbeth's sleep-walk. She
.should be told that it takes more than
a monotone to express misery.
