# 'Governor's Wife' Closes This Week
## 
### 
Climax of '"The Governor's Wife,"
which ends its six-night stay on the
Farm tonight and Wednesday night,
is a comic bullfight scene.
The setting represents the grand
stand of a bull arena thronged with
townspeople, visitors to the fair, and
members of the Spanish nobility.
The combat is brought to the audi
ence through the local announcer,
who broadcasts the names, weights,
and positions of all the bulls.
Mention is made of all licensed
undertakers for the benefit of the
toreadors. At a signal from the gov
ernor the fight starts. But like the
famous "Ferdinand" this bull is
not interested in the proceedings.
Instead of charging Campos, the
famous matador, he sticks his head
in a puddle of water.
It takes torpedoes plus a pep talk
from the Governor to get the bull
into action, and the scene ends with
a first-class riot.
A cast of Farm favorites fills the
many colorful roles in "The Gover
nor's Wife." The play is under the
direction of H. Miles Heberer, set
tings are by Waldemar Johanscn,
and costumes by Mrs. Helen Green.
Tickets are 40 cents and are on
sale in Room 202. Memorial Hall, and
outside of the Little Theater the
nights of the performances.
