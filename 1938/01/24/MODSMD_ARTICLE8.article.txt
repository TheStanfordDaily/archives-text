open today provided new anchors for the floats arrive. If they do not,
swimming and boating cannot start until tomorrow, according to Hal

Weatherbe, manager of the boat-<

Although softies may find the
water a little icy, the site of the Big
Game bonfire is now the necessary
36 feet under, and the Lake will
open.
Canoes drifting beneath a lazy
sun, swimmers cutting across the
sparkling surface, tans taking form
on limp bodies lying on the floats,
canoeing couples in the moonlight
â€”and it's January 24 at Stanford.
Old Man Winter must have been
drowned in Lagunita.
