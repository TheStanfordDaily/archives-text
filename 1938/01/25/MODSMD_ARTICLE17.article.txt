# Union Cellar Forgoes Profit; Offers 'Dividend Plate' Today
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
"Dividend Plate" will be formally
introduced in the Union Cellar to
day.
Designed to offer living-group type
of meals to frequent Cellar patrons,
tlie inauguration of the new special
luncheons and dinners follows the
publication in The Daily recently of
a series of articles presenting a "be
hind the scene" view of Union
problems.
Differing from familiar student
complaints about the Cellar, the ar
ticles examined the physical plant
and financial structure of the Union,
and concluded with the recom
mendation that a reduction of prof
its would be the most effective meth
od for meeting student criticism.
At a meeting last Thursday, the
Union Board of Directors decided to
offer for a "trial period" special
meals that satisfy a recognized de
mand for extra-size servings at rela

tively low prices.
Such meals, it was agreed, would
be subsidized out of other Union in
come, and would not be offered with
any expectation of profit, which
marked a complete reversal of pre
vious Union policy.
Yesterday the Cellar offered un
named equivalents for the new spe
cial meals, designated on the menus
by a border of "x's". One hundred
and thirty-nine students ordered the
luncheon, and received for 35 cents
portions that were, according to Miss
Christine Ricker, director of dining
rooms and the Stanford Union, from
two and one-half to three times
larger than the average Cellar serv
ings.
Chief purpose of the Union man
agement in offering the new meals,
Miss Ricker explained yesterday
afternoon, "is to duplicate the
amount, price, and quality of food

offered by Stanford living groups for
students who are not members of
such organizations."
Approximately one-third of the
regular patrons of the Cellar belong
to such a classification, she esti
mated.
Tentative weekly menus for the
special meals were arranged by reg
ular Union dieticians, acting upon
recommendations of a student com
mittee that included A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Tom Kiliefer, student manager,
Chuck Fontius, and the editor and
associate editor of The Daily. Mem
bers of this committee decided yes
terday upon the name for the new
meals.
"Dividend plate" lunches, costing
35 cents, will be served daily from
11:30 to 1:30 o'clock, while the din
ners, priced at 50 cents, will be of
fered from 5:30 to 7:30 o'clock, Union
officials have announced.
