# Henderson's Band Will Swing Prom
## 
### 
"The man who, outside of the
King himself, helped most to make
Benny Goodman the King of
Swing."
That's what the boys in the know
say of Fletcher Henderson, whose
15-piece band will pound out the
rhythm for the Junior Prom, Fri
day, Feb. 11.
And the boys in the know will
also tell you that the man who
makes the band is the arranger.
Henderson is one of the best in the
business—spin some of Goodman's
recordings, and chances are that
you'll be listening to a Henderson
score.
Perhaps his top arrangement is
that of "Christopher Columbus,"
now his theme. And the style that
made his colossal bit of swing fam
ous is incorporated in evei'y piece
Henderson plays.
The Prom, which will feature the
first nationally known colored band
ever to appear at an all-University
dance, will be semi-formal. Bids
are $3.
