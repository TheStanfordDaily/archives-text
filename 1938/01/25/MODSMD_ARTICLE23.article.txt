# Soph May Whistle Way To New York
## 
### 
Ten years ago, Jack Baker started
imitating bird calls.
Now, a sophomore at Stanford, he
may turn his ability into a free air
plane trip to New York City and a
week at the Waldorf-Astoria.
Baker is one of the 10 finalists on
a radio amateur program on KGO
tonight from 8:15 to 9:15 o'clock.
Votes from radio listeners will select
two winners for the free trip East.
Sponsors of the program scouted
the Big Game Gaieties last fall.
Those selected were among the en
trants in a preliminary contest. Ra
dio editors of San Francisco news
papers chose 10 of the 25 winners
to compete in tonight's contest.
Baker has appeared many times
in public, and during the past year
he has whistled with Paul Pendar
vis, Carol Lofner, and Freddy Nagle.
He was at Yosemite one week at
Camp Curry, and at Bal Bijou, Lake
Tahoe. Other appearances were at
the Salinas Rodeo and with the 66th
Infantry Band of Ohio and the
Southern Pacific Band at the Reno
Rodeo.
