Wearing only wet swimming
trunks and shivering and dripping
in the back of Jack McCune's car
Encinamen Ed Rabjohn and Jack
Lyons told a Daily reporter last
night that they were "charter mem
bers of the Polar Bear Club."
McCune, also from Encina, took
the men over to Lake Lagunita last
night and waited while they took a
dip. Rabjohn announced proudly
that they stayed in three minutes
and swam out to the raft. The dar
ing frosh claimed they did not know
the lake was still closed.
When the interviewer voiced his
personal opinion that the boys were
"awfully dumb," they chorused, "We
think so, too."
