(UP). â€” President James Bryant
| Conant of Harvard believes univer
i sities should reduce their enroll-
I ment to prevent overcrowding in
, the learned professions.
"It seems evident that we are in
j danger of reaching the condition al
ready so acute on the continent of
Europe, where the problem of un
employment in the learned profes
sions demands attention even in
j countries racked by political and
economic troubles," he said in his
annual report.
