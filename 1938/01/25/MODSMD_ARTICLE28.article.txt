## Work Units Compete; Dean Yost, Killefer Tell Of 'Y' Benefits 
### 
Returns from the Y.W.C.A. Fi
nance Drive were reported last night
as having reached a total figure of
$377 at the conclusion of the first
d-;y of active canvassing, according
to Virginia Clausen, treasurer.
Many more contributions are ex
pected to be received this afternoon
when the 250 drive workers turn in
their collection envelopes for the
second day of the campaign. In
order that the quota of $1000 set for
the drive to be reached, an average
contribution of $1 from each girl
would be necessary.
Workers Compete
In the competition between the 10
units of workers, Team Five, headed
by Putzie Hinricks is ahead so far
with a collection record of $63.25.
Dean Mary Yost, commenting yes
terday on the potential values that
the Y.W.C.A. has for the campus
brought out the following points:
1. "Student life tends to crystalize
around the living groups. The
Y.W.C.A. draws from all living
groups and, therefore, tends to pro
mote campus-wide friendliness and
democratic standards of judging
one's fellows.
2. "Student life tends to be pro
vincial since student interests are so
largely campus centered. The
Y.W.C.A. offers opportunity through
their social service work and their
discussion groups to enlarge knowl
edge and sympathetic understanding
of groups beyond the campus gates.
Varied Activities
3. "The Y.W.C.A. offers varied
and interesting activities to students
who are asking to make more
friends, who wish opportunities for
leadership, and who have interests
and talents not developed through
other means.
4. "nl the present world of shift
ing and confused values the
Y.W.C.A. offers its standard of
Christian ethics and tries to help its
members apply thus standard to
daily life."
Dean Yost also added that
"whether or not the potential values
of the Y.W.C.A. are realized in any
one year depends on the thinking
co-operation of the membership and
the vision and leadership of the
cabinet."
Killefer Supports 'Y'
Tom Killefer, President of the
A.S.S.U. made the following state
ment last night, "On a campus as
little actively interested in national
and international problems as ours,
the work of the Y.W.C.A, in con
nection with a peace program is es
pecially noteworthy. Any help this
gi'oup may receive from the campus
will be in itself a progressive step."
Campus projects which were orig
inated by the Y.W.C.A. are the
Roble Sponsor system and Peacc
Day. The "Y" also takes an activc
part in putting over the annual
May Brunch which is an important
event in the Convalescent Home
Drive.
