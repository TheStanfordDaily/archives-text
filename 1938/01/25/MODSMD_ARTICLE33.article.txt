# Hawaiian Club Feasts; Makes Whoopee in Paly
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
Swing music swung again Sunday
night, to the strain of ukes anji gui
tars. Roast pig, lomi-lomi salmon,
and the succulent tasting poi was
the basis for a real Hawaiian feast,
only a mere mile off the limits of
good old Stanford University.
The scene of the gathering was
the home of Jean Glassman, one of
the Palo Alto members of the Ha
waiian Club and almost every stu
dent from Hawaii who goes to Stan
ford, a group from San Jose, and
even a special edition from Mills and
Cal were present.
When the clan gathered they were
promptly ushered out to the kitchen
to aid the volunteers who were mix
ing the fish, cutting off ripe bananas

preparatory to cooking them, roast
ing sweet potatoes in the oven, slic
ing real Hawaiian pineapples, and
doing the many other details neces
sary in the preparation of a luau or
native feast which was served in the
buffet style on huge leaves without
benefit of knives or forks.
Leaves Licked Clean
When finally the leaves were
licked clean, and the bones piled in
the center of the table, the party
repaired to the next room for
whoopie making.
Three guitars and a number of
"jumping fleas" (ukeleles to you,
chum) were on deck, and as soon as
shoes were taken off and everyone
was comfortably seated on the floor,
the festivities began. Before you
could say "ecomo mai no ka ua ika,
hale walekahao," the room was vi
brating to spirited strains of many a
nifty Hawaiian number. Soon more
nifty Hawaiian numbers were sway
ing, as the gals entered into the
spirit of the occasion and danced
hulas.
Far, Far Into Night
On far, far into the night this con
tinued, with trucking and the big
apple being tried to hula rhythm,
until finally, with late leaves being
threatened, the party regretfully
broke up.
Now, any more of you laddies, and
you, too, lassies, who want to get
into this. There'll be more like 'em,
all you have to do is x'ead the Daily
bull-board and find out when the
next one comes off.

was comfortably seated on the floor,
the festivities began. Before you
could say "ecomo mai no ka ua ika,
hale walekahao," the room was vi
brating to spirited strains of many a
nifty Hawaiian number. Soon more
nifty Hawaiian numbers were sway
ing, as the gals entered into the
spirit of the occasion and danced
hulas.
Far, Far Into Night
On far, far into the night this con
tinued, with trucking and the big
apple being tried to hula rhythm,
until finally, with late leaves being
threatened, the party regretfully
broke up.
Now, any more of you laddies, and
you, too, lassies, who want to get
into this. There'll be more like 'em,
all you have to do is x'ead the Daily
bull-board and find out when the
next one comes off.
