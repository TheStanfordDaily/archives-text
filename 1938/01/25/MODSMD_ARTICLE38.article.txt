# Davis Discusses Figures Of Speech
## 
### 
Enumerating the factors which
j have given rise to figures of speech,
William Hawley Davis, editor of the
! Stanford University Press spoke
i last night over KGO.
"It is somewhat startling," Pro
fessor Davis remarked, "to find that
the expressions relating to physical
combat, including war, which are
j embedded in our common speech
j amount to hundreds."' Among these
Ihe lists, "cutthroat competition,"
I "tactical error."
"Similarly we employ many ef
! fective expressions from outdated
science," he declared, including in
this group, "touchstone," "dragon's
teeth," "vampire," "harpy," and
"ends of the earth."
Professor Davis concluded with
j the comment: "There is a thrust in
such terms whioh 'drives them
home,' a colorfulness beside which
literal or mere straightforward ex-
I pressions seem 'pale' and 'drab'."
"No wonder there is a lot of
; knowledge in the colleges," says Ab
j bott Lawrence Powell, president
: emeritus of Harvard. "Freshmen
! always bring a little in and seniors
; never take any away."
