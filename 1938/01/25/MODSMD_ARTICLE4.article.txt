## 
### 
Editor Bob Hartmann of the Stan
ford Chaparral is missing a lot of
sleep these last few days before
publication. A Daily reporter found
him in a semi-conscious state when
he mentioned some of the major
features to be revealed in this, the
first issue of winter quarter.
Pres Ellington's newest master
piece, "Of Angels and Annabella,"
is one of the outstanding articles
written this year, according to Hart
mann.
A monumental advance review of
"Snow White," written by the edi
tor, is the first to be published in
these parts, if latest reports in the
second floor of the Journalism
Building are to be believed.
Tom Fleming, a regular contribu
tor, has recently turned his facile
pen, says Hartmann, to ajjitter satire
on the Campus Big Shot. Sister Mc-
Gonigle, who should know, writes a
story of rushing, "The Tragic Tale
of Tessie" for student readers.
Vital editorials on what Ls wrong
with Stanford University will be
continued in this issue by the Old
Boy, who also has a few critical re
marks to make about rushing in
fraternities and sororities, and a
number of other subjects.
