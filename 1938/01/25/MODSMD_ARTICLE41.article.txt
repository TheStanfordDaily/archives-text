THEY'RE CLIMBING OFF
THE BAM) WAGON
I see where all the wise boys are
climbing off the Stanford band
wagon and discarding the Card
basketball team as a choice for the
southern division title.
It's easy enough lo string along
with a winning team, but let a
team, even of championship cali
ber, lose a couple of ball games
and then watch (he sports critics
scurry from the scene like a pack
of rals fleeing a sinking ship.
We on the Farm still believe John
Bunn's boys have an even chance,
despite the two-game handicap, to
emerge on top of the heap. Stan
ford had potentially the best team
on the coast. When they pull out of
t-his slump they're going to bowl
over Cal and help explode the Bear
bubble ... a job that was started by
Santa Clara Saturday night.
CARDS CAN STILL
WIN CONFERENCE TITLE
Cal is leading the conference now
with three wins and no losses. Hav
ing seen both the Bears and Tro
jans play this season, I feel perfect
ly sure that U.S.C. will take the
series from the Bears. The Trojans
should take both games from the
Cal bunch this week-end at Berke
ley while the Cards are whipping the
stuffin' out of the hapless Bruins
down south.
If (lie Indians hit their stride
and play the kind of hall they're
capable of playing, they can win
the remaining nine conference
games and win the undisputed
right to meet the northern division
winner for the P.C.C. title.
Incidentally, a surprisingly strong
University of Oregon team is lead
ing the pack in the northern race.
Washington was figured to be the
team to beat at the start of the sea
son. All six teams are still in the
running, however. No team has an
undefeated record and no team has
a goose egg score sheet.
PERRY AND VINES
COMING TO SAN JOSE
The Fred Perry-Ellsworth Vines
tennis duel for the professional
championship of the world moves
into San Jose on Jan. 31 when the
two world beaters go into action in
the Civic Auditorium.
It'll he the Farm's chance to see
championship tennis at its finest.
To insure good seats (a capacity
crowd is expected) Stanfordites
can secure tickets from John Gor
dan, '32, at his tennis shop, 125
East Fernando Street, San Jose.
I understand tickets are as low as
55 pennies.
SPARTAN BOXERS
GO ON TOUR
Our little neighbor, San Jose
State, is going in for boxing in a
big way. The Spartans have one of
the best teams on the coast . . have
had for several years.
The Spartans have signed for a
match with Santa Clara in March,
and are going on two extended
tours. One trip will carry them
into the Pacific Northwest to meet
Washington State and Idaho, while
the other will take the Staters into
Arizona to face the University of
Tucson and Tempe Teachers.
They don't differentiate between
major and minor* sports at State,
hut if they did boxing would cer
tainly rate right up in there.
Not much importance is attached
to intercollegiate boxing here on
the Farm. There was a time when
the Cardinal boxing teams were
known up and down the coast.
We hope the coming of Clayton
Frye this year to the Farm will
start a new era in Stanford's inter
collegiate boxing history.

over Cal and help explode the Bear
bubble ... a job that was started by
Santa Clara Saturday night.
CARDS CAN STILL
WIN CONFERENCE TITLE
Cal is leading the conference now
with three wins and no losses. Hav
ing seen both the Bears and Tro
jans play this season, I feel perfect
ly sure that U.S.C. will take the
series from the Bears. The Trojans
should take both games from the
Cal bunch this week-end at Berke
ley while the Cards are whipping the
stuffin' out of the hapless Bruins
down south.
If (lie Indians hit their stride
and play the kind of hall they're
capable of playing, they can win
the remaining nine conference
games and win the undisputed
right to meet the northern division
winner for the P.C.C. title.
Incidentally, a surprisingly strong
University of Oregon team is lead
ing the pack in the northern race.
Washington was figured to be the
team to beat at the start of the sea
son. All six teams are still in the
running, however. No team has an
undefeated record and no team has
a goose egg score sheet.
PERRY AND VINES
COMING TO SAN JOSE
The Fred Perry-Ellsworth Vines
tennis duel for the professional
championship of the world moves
into San Jose on Jan. 31 when the
two world beaters go into action in
the Civic Auditorium.
It'll he the Farm's chance to see
championship tennis at its finest.
To insure good seats (a capacity
crowd is expected) Stanfordites
can secure tickets from John Gor
dan, '32, at his tennis shop, 125
East Fernando Street, San Jose.
I understand tickets are as low as
55 pennies.
SPARTAN BOXERS
GO ON TOUR
Our little neighbor, San Jose
State, is going in for boxing in a
big way. The Spartans have one of
the best teams on the coast . . have
had for several years.
The Spartans have signed for a
match with Santa Clara in March,
and are going on two extended
tours. One trip will carry them
into the Pacific Northwest to meet
Washington State and Idaho, while
the other will take the Staters into
Arizona to face the University of
Tucson and Tempe Teachers.
They don't differentiate between
major and minor* sports at State,
hut if they did boxing would cer
tainly rate right up in there.
Not much importance is attached
to intercollegiate boxing here on
the Farm. There was a time when
the Cardinal boxing teams were
known up and down the coast.
We hope the coming of Clayton
Frye this year to the Farm will
start a new era in Stanford's inter
collegiate boxing history.

THEY'RE CLIMBING OFF
THE BAM) WAGON
I see where all the wise boys are
climbing off the Stanford band
wagon and discarding the Card
basketball team as a choice for the
southern division title.
It's easy enough lo string along
with a winning team, but let a
team, even of championship cali
ber, lose a couple of ball games
and then watch (he sports critics
scurry from the scene like a pack
of rals fleeing a sinking ship.
We on the Farm still believe John
Bunn's boys have an even chance,
despite the two-game handicap, to
emerge on top of the heap. Stan
ford had potentially the best team
on the coast. When they pull out of
t-his slump they're going to bowl
over Cal and help explode the Bear
bubble ... a job that was started by
Santa Clara Saturday night.
