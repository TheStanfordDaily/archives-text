# Score Error Gives Cards Extra Point
## Official Record Shows Indians Won 43-32 In St. Mary's Game 
### 
Out of the slightly bland St.
Mary's-Stanford basketball game
Saturday night there has come an
intriguing little mysteryâ€”a mystery
of a missing point.
Up until now the general impres
sion has been that Stanford won 42-
32, but the general impression has
been wrong. Stanford scored 43
points, and the official scorebook has
the figuxes to back it up.
Question Over Tip-up
It seems that all newspaper re
ports credited Captain Hank Luisetti
with 19 points, or six field goals
and seven free throws. The score
book has the number of field goals
and foul throws reversed, to give the
maestro 20 points. Whereas Luisetti
was given only one field goal in the
first half by virtually everyone, the
Stanford scorer gave him credit for
two field goals. The question arose
over a tip-in shot that might have
been scored by Phil Zonne, but
Zonne refused responsibility for it
when questioned.
The St. Mary's scorebook artist
went slightly huffy and refused to
give Hank the score, but he's wrong
as far as the official score is con
cerned, because the home book al
ways rules.
Point Unexplained
However, that doesn't explain
away the fact that there was a one
point difference in the final score.
Any controversy over a field goal
would have to result in a two-point
difference, obviously, and a goal was
definitely scored anyway.
At any rate, all newspaper reports
previous to this one have had the
score wrong, and it is now officially
established that Stanford scored 43
points, and that Captain Luisetti
plunked 20.
Hank's Total
The game brought Hank's total to
209 points this year for 11 games, or
an average of 19 points per game.
That puts him hot on the trail of the
all-time four-year record of 1531
points, for he now has 1340 points
and half a season to go, there being
11 more games on the schedule.
The team starts on the second half
of its season this week-end when it
tangles with U.C.L.A. in a pair of
conference contests in Los Angeles.
In spite of their laggardly showing
in the past three games, the Indians
will undoubtedly be installed as fa
vorites to trim the cellar-a"biding
Bruins, who have yet to win a con
ference game this year.
Having decided that the players
showed signs of weariness this past
week-end, Coach Bunn plans short
practices this week in the hopes that
the Laughing Boys will once again
become the Laughing Boys. For the
past two weeks the chortlers have
been playing as if they had the world
itself on their shoulders.
