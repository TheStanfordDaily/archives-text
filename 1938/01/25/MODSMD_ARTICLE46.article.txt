# Braddock, Farr May Meet Again
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 24 (UP). â€”
Former Heavyweight Champion
Jimmy Braddock and Tommy Farr
of Wales were expected to sign con
tracts today for a return bout this
spring.
Braddock's win over the Welsh
man last Friday night gave his man
ager, Joe Gould, a commanding posi
tion in the heavyweight situation.
He has ruled out Maxie Baor as the
next opponent for the perennial
Irishman despite a written agree
ment with Promoter Mike Jacobs
for a Braddock-Baer fight on
March 11.
