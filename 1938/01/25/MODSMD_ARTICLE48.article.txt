## Trackmen Make Records Malott, Shaw Hit High Marks Hiserman Takes Low Hurdles In 24.3 
### GENE GEAR, Sports Editor 
Ray Malott and George Shaw hit
the best marks attained so far on
the Coast this year with early season
records in yesterday's practice meet
on Angell Field.
Malott broke the 440 tape in 48.2
seconds, probably the best time ever
made in this event this early in the
season at Stanford. Shaw's javelin
toss of 190.7 feet was sensational,
but unofficial because he fouled by
one inch.
Stan Hiserman crashed through
with a 24:3 low-hurdle run, the
best in time trials so far this season
and the best Stan has ever done in
the lows. Hiserman also won the
100-yard dash.
Ed Burrows took first in the mile,
and John Emanuel won the two-mile
contest. Bill Hawkins cleaned up
in the high hurdles.
Rusty March won the half-mile
race, and Wilson Slater came in
first in the 220-yard dash.
While Humbert Smith, of the
Olympic Club, made the best record
in the high jump, he was followed
closely by Clarence Bernhauer, of
the varsity.
Ray Brown made the longest
broad jump, and Duke Gill the
highest pole vault.
Bill Wohle won the shot put.
Shaw's foul in the javelin throw
gave Bill Braheny official first
place.
