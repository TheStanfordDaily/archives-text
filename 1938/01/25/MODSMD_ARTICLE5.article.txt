# Lagunita Opening Set for Saturday
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita's opening is post- !
poned until next Saturday morning
at 10 o'clock.
Reason for the delay is that the '
boathouse crew lacks anchorage ma- i
terial for the floats. Manager Hal I
Weatherbee spent the afternoon yes
terday rattling around the campus in
his Model A collecting 700 pounds of
iron.
The proper amount of avoirdupois
assembled, he found that no chains
were available. They will have to
be purchased, and delivery is not ex
pected until Thursday or Friday. So, j
the boathouse cannot open unlil
Saturday morning.
Disappointed water-lovers sun- |
bathed on the boathouse porch yes-\
terday afternoon as the sun beat j
down on the lake and wondered if ;
Stanford was not just a little un
grateful.
One of the lifeguards, John Brahtz, I
Bill Hatch, or Weatherbe, will be on
duty from 1 to 4 o'clock every after
noon this week at the boathouse so
that living groups can bring their i
canoes to the lake for storage.
Prompt action in this matter is !
suggested by the crew because the
amount of space is limited.
"The lake will positively open Sat
urday morning, we hope," hollered
â™¦he boathouse boys as they sweated
over their anchors yesterday. This I
year's opening will be eight days be- !
fore last winter's ducking debut.
