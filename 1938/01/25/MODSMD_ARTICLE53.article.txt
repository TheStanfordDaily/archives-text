## ...But The Daily Can't Win 
### 
THE editorial finger of The Stanford Daily
which so gleefully has pointed with pride,
alarm, dismay, disdain—and often just pointed
—must now execute a maneuver which is as
revolutionary as the completion of a hurry call
through 3121 at dinner time.
Having dissected everything in the Stanford
scene, The Stanford Daily can now view its
pretty self in the mirror and scream with alarm
at its own impossible election system.
Witness a situation in which two men with
promise aie rolled through the mill from re
porter to associate editor, become the two most
reliable members of the staff, the two most
qualified to handle the publication of Stanford's
news.
Witness these two pitted against each other
in an election for editor in which one becomes
sole heir to the sheet, the other gets a consola
tory cocktail, a couple of handshakes, and a
complete dismissal from service to The Stanford
Daily. At times a defeated candidate has been
given some unimportant position on the staff,
some job he'd already held two volumes be
fore, as a disgustingly feeble prize of con
solation.
More important than the injustice to the indi
vidual is the loss which The Daily itself sus
tains. What justification is there for a system
in which a man is groomed for three years and
then is shoved off the end of the bench, when
a matter of a half dozen votes might have re
versed the outcome? It's as silly as Stanford's
sorority system.
While The Daily has manhandled every other
organization on the campus, it has reverently

pursued its policy of self laissez faire. Now it's
time for the rag to get wise to itself.
One plan which was tentatively discussed
last quarter and which deserves further con
sideration before next election time, is this:
Of the two associates who run for editor,
one becomes recipient of that position, and the
losing candidate automatically becomes man
aging editor. Opponents to the plan say that
the two couldn't get along, but the defense
holds that the decreased tension on the candi
dates during the pre-election period would be
sufficient to prevent any serious enmity.
Coincident with this revision cf policy would
be the increasing of the M.E.'s salary to nearly
equal thet of the editor, which, incidentally,
still won't send him chortling about chucking
bright new dimes at Charlie, Bat, and Bailey.
The plan may not be the answer. But a couple
of glances in the glass will let the old gill know
that if this one won't lift her face, there should
be one that will.

Last night two damn good college journalists
got as far as Mora's, according to late reports,
before making the first stop on their way to a
bit of "Yes, My Darling Daughter." J. R. and
L. L. were taking the traditional night-before
election "rest." This afternoon The Daily will
unnecessarily lose the ability of one of those
men.
This is not sob stuff because I like them both,
have worked side by side with 'em for several
weeks and hate to see one lose.
I hate to see the sheet lose—and it does,
either way.

tains. What justification is there for a system
in which a man is groomed for three years and
then is shoved off the end of the bench, when
a matter of a half dozen votes might have re
versed the outcome? It's as silly as Stanford's
sorority system.
While The Daily has manhandled every other
organization on the campus, it has reverently

pursued its policy of self laissez faire. Now it's
time for the rag to get wise to itself.
One plan which was tentatively discussed
last quarter and which deserves further con
sideration before next election time, is this:
Of the two associates who run for editor,
one becomes recipient of that position, and the
losing candidate automatically becomes man
aging editor. Opponents to the plan say that
the two couldn't get along, but the defense
holds that the decreased tension on the candi
dates during the pre-election period would be
sufficient to prevent any serious enmity.
Coincident with this revision cf policy would
be the increasing of the M.E.'s salary to nearly
equal thet of the editor, which, incidentally,
still won't send him chortling about chucking
bright new dimes at Charlie, Bat, and Bailey.
The plan may not be the answer. But a couple
of glances in the glass will let the old gill know
that if this one won't lift her face, there should
be one that will.

Last night two damn good college journalists
got as far as Mora's, according to late reports,
before making the first stop on their way to a
bit of "Yes, My Darling Daughter." J. R. and
L. L. were taking the traditional night-before
election "rest." This afternoon The Daily will
unnecessarily lose the ability of one of those
men.
This is not sob stuff because I like them both,
have worked side by side with 'em for several
weeks and hate to see one lose.
I hate to see the sheet lose—and it does,
either way.
THE editorial finger of The Stanford Daily
which so gleefully has pointed with pride,
alarm, dismay, disdain—and often just pointed
—must now execute a maneuver which is as
revolutionary as the completion of a hurry call
through 3121 at dinner time.
Having dissected everything in the Stanford
scene, The Stanford Daily can now view its
pretty self in the mirror and scream with alarm
at its own impossible election system.
Witness a situation in which two men with
promise aie rolled through the mill from re
porter to associate editor, become the two most
reliable members of the staff, the two most
qualified to handle the publication of Stanford's
news.
Witness these two pitted against each other
in an election for editor in which one becomes
sole heir to the sheet, the other gets a consola
tory cocktail, a couple of handshakes, and a
complete dismissal from service to The Stanford
Daily. At times a defeated candidate has been
given some unimportant position on the staff,
some job he'd already held two volumes be
fore, as a disgustingly feeble prize of con
solation.
More important than the injustice to the indi
vidual is the loss which The Daily itself sus
tains. What justification is there for a system
in which a man is groomed for three years and
then is shoved off the end of the bench, when
a matter of a half dozen votes might have re
versed the outcome? It's as silly as Stanford's
