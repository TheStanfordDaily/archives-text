# Flunking the Flunkers

//"j \0 unto others .. . —is a time-honored
YJ biblical adage, but one which has seldom
received practical application.
Last week, however, Fxesno State's students
discussed a plan to square accounts with the
faculty by publishing professorial rating sheets.
Purpose of such ratings was "to develop a more
co-operative feeling between students and fac
ulty."
Such a goal is obviously full of merit but the
attack could hardly be called subtle. Chief
weakness in the plan is that the students' ratings
cannot and will not be impersonal. Because of
variable interests and personal attitudes, the
grading will be too prejudiced to be justified,
even on the basis of the omnipresent law of
averages.

As Dr. Wilbur criticized in a recent radio
interview:
"The better students are almost sure to give
a professor a satisfactory or high rating, while
those less well prepared or less interested are
apt to blame the professor for their own inade
quacies."
Besides this personal element, there remains
the fact that in universities where the number
of required subjects is limited, faculty members
are rather well rated by the student's choice
of courses.
Thus, though in some cases turn-about is fair,
students have in the main no legitimate reason
for wishing to grade their professors. Numer
ous bull sessions to the contrary, university
grading systems are kept on a pretty fair basis
—and this is something that professorial ratings
could never be. — J. R.
