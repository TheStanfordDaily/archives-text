# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS DEPARTMENT
local union of cold-water throwers got
a surprise recently when the forgotten Student-
Faculty Relations Committee announced a plan to
establish communications across the gulf that separates
professors and undei'graduates. For some time now,
the committee has been reposing in a modest obscurity
that would make even the most isolated hermit look
like a publicity hound. Cynics predicted that before
long it would be interred decently in the Ex Committee
files and forgotten.
But with its new proposal the committee shows that
meditation and seclusion may after all help to build a
• ire under the imagination. In brief, the plan is to
sponsor a series of informal student-faculty gatherings
in the nitery on Thursday afternoons. There will be
no attempt at formalized "steering" of conversation, no
infuriatingly tactful discussion of ways to "foster
better understanding." Instead the committee will
try to persuade good conversationalists, both profes
sors and students, to attend. And after that it plans
to let nature take its well known course.
# * * *
All of this means that the committee has hit upon
one of the most workable plans that has turned up
since the earthquake. Nature has had considerably
more experience in taking her course than most com
mittees have had in taking theirs. It is unfortunate
that so few "leaders" realize this. But when a com
mittee does manage to let the idea soak in, and pro
ceeds on from there, its chances of success come down
around the pari-mutual limit.
Of course, the unqualified success of the plan is
hardly a good risk for an orphan's patrimony. And
a well-advised widow will think twice before she
stakes her mite on it at even odds. But the scheme
has a sporting chance.
+ * * *
|>EFORE this the great trouble with establishing any
unofficial contact between students and faculty
has been the constant fear of apple polishing. Students
who stop by the desk after class lose caste faster than
a small-town girl who is careless about her window
shades. They are branded as apple polishers, and like
Cain they find every man's hand against them.
But if the committee can arrange the student
faculty bull session, the apple polishing spectre need
not receive an invitation to the feast. Conversation
has a way of skipping about, and even from a standing
start it ought to be well away from the professor's
subject by the end of the first 10 minutes.
♦ * » »
Tho success of the plan depends on how well the
committee can choose its conversationalists. If it gets
some single-minded test-tube who sees life only as its
affects the cytoplasm of the amoeba, the scheme has
about as much of a chance as a Hearst agent would
have in Russia. Similarly, if it can attract only stu
dents who feel that their C needs a little strengthening,
the odds will lengthen out again.
But if the scheme can bring together even a dozen
or so undergraduates and professors who like a good
bull session it will be well out of the long-shot class.
This group would form tho nucleus for student-faculty
forums that will draw attendance instead of snickers.
And it will provide real contact between undergradu
ate and teacher, supplementing the cafeteria style
teaching of the lecture rooms, where the professor
hand' out informal ion like a cook serving up beans.

Faculty Relations Committee announced a plan to
establish communications across the gulf that separates
professors and undei'graduates. For some time now,
the committee has been reposing in a modest obscurity
that would make even the most isolated hermit look
like a publicity hound. Cynics predicted that before
long it would be interred decently in the Ex Committee
files and forgotten.
But with its new proposal the committee shows that
meditation and seclusion may after all help to build a
• ire under the imagination. In brief, the plan is to
sponsor a series of informal student-faculty gatherings
in the nitery on Thursday afternoons. There will be
no attempt at formalized "steering" of conversation, no
infuriatingly tactful discussion of ways to "foster
better understanding." Instead the committee will
try to persuade good conversationalists, both profes
sors and students, to attend. And after that it plans
to let nature take its well known course.
# * * *
All of this means that the committee has hit upon
one of the most workable plans that has turned up
since the earthquake. Nature has had considerably
more experience in taking her course than most com
mittees have had in taking theirs. It is unfortunate
that so few "leaders" realize this. But when a com
mittee does manage to let the idea soak in, and pro
ceeds on from there, its chances of success come down
around the pari-mutual limit.
Of course, the unqualified success of the plan is
hardly a good risk for an orphan's patrimony. And
a well-advised widow will think twice before she
stakes her mite on it at even odds. But the scheme
has a sporting chance.
+ * * *
|>EFORE this the great trouble with establishing any
unofficial contact between students and faculty
has been the constant fear of apple polishing. Students
who stop by the desk after class lose caste faster than
a small-town girl who is careless about her window
shades. They are branded as apple polishers, and like
Cain they find every man's hand against them.
But if the committee can arrange the student
faculty bull session, the apple polishing spectre need
not receive an invitation to the feast. Conversation
has a way of skipping about, and even from a standing
start it ought to be well away from the professor's
subject by the end of the first 10 minutes.
♦ * » »
Tho success of the plan depends on how well the
committee can choose its conversationalists. If it gets
some single-minded test-tube who sees life only as its
affects the cytoplasm of the amoeba, the scheme has
about as much of a chance as a Hearst agent would
have in Russia. Similarly, if it can attract only stu
dents who feel that their C needs a little strengthening,
the odds will lengthen out again.
But if the scheme can bring together even a dozen
or so undergraduates and professors who like a good
bull session it will be well out of the long-shot class.
This group would form tho nucleus for student-faculty
forums that will draw attendance instead of snickers.
And it will provide real contact between undergradu
ate and teacher, supplementing the cafeteria style
teaching of the lecture rooms, where the professor
hand' out informal ion like a cook serving up beans.
