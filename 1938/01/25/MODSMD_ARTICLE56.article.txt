A LTHOUGH, or perhaps because, Hollywood has
built the star system into a positive menace, there
are more thankless jobs per square foot than almost
any other artistic industry you can think of. Your
painter signs his stuff; even the members of a sym
phony orchestra stand up at the conductor's sign to
take their bow.
But all those behind-the-scenes artists—script girls,
property men, and so on—remain forgotten men in the
midst of Roosevelt's mighty campaign. And among
this horde of bushels-under-baskets, is the musician.
His name may be seen, but he is unheard.
For, the main requisite of movie music is that it
must remain unobtrusive to the point of non-existence.

In the old days, the musician's job was easy. All
he had to do was to play "Hearts and Flowers," or
"Narcissus" when the heroine and the hero appeared
on the screen, and trot out Rossini's "William Tell
Overture" during the inevitable chase scenes.
But with the increasing attention paid to what had
hitherto been considered minor details, music came in
for its share of improvement. As always, the main
character of a musical background was implied in its
description—it was background, and background alone.
So there developed a stalwart crew of hacks who
ground out melody a la Ethelbert Nevin.

r I I ODAY, theVe is a new deal brewing. Significant is
the coming of composers to Hollywood who have
a legitimate rating in the musical world. Such men as
Korngold, Werner Janssen, and others indicate the
added importance that producers are giving to music.
And the result of this added attention is showing.
You probably were on the look-out for Janssen's
music for "The General Died At Dawn." Composers
are fast approaching the stage whei«e the music they
are doing for a picture is good enough to be played by
itself.
We are firmly convinced that eventually a picture
will be produced where the music is the star, and, like
opera, the story is almost disregarded. It was Sto
koski who suggested that an animated cartoon be
made to Dukas' "Sorcerer's Apprentice."
Some day a real composer is going to emerge—to
the great amazement of the musical world and of Hol
lywood itself—who learned his abe's writing hack
music for MGM.—Stone.
