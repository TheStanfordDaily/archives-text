# Lombard Nuts As Usual In Screwy Farce
## 
### 
Showing today only at the Stan
ford Theater is "Nothing Sacred,"
Selznick International's bid for one

of the more
screwy farces of
the season.
With Carole
Lombard top
spotted as Hazel
Flagg, allegedly
radium - poisoned
Vermont blond,
who takes New
York's sympathy
in her stride, and
Frederic March,

ace reporter, who is taken in by
every hoax in the show, "Nothing
Sacred" offers entertainment most
will enjoy.
Done in technicolor, this film hits
amusing highs in its caustic por
trayal of Vermont New England as
newshawk, Wallace Cook (March)
experiences it. The monosyllabic
"Yeps' 'and "Nope's" of the natives
bring down the house.
Chief criticism of Lombard in
"Nothing Sacred" is her style of
acting which is reminiscent of "True
Confession" and "My Man Godfrey."
Native New Yorkers on the Farm
will enjoy the four color shots of
their city's skyscrapers, and Broad
way by night and day.
Best line is delivered by Charles
Winninger as Doc Enoch, who, drunk
again, aboard ship, peers out of a
stateroom porthole, shouts to Miss
Lombard, "Run for your life, Hazel,
the hotel's flooded!"
''Danger Patrol," last half of the
double-biller, is concerned chiefly
with the perils braved by the rela
tively short-lived "nitro-shooters,"
whose explosives make or break
oil wells.
If you like "Big Apples," see the
newsreel which shows true-kin' and
peckin' Southern style, but on ice.
