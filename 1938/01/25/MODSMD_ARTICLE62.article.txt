## DOG KENNEL? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We accept the new habit of prome
nading one's dog in between classes,
a gesture which distinguishes its
owner as a member of an exclusive
tong or lodge. But we do object to
being chaperoned to a movie by a
hound who has forgotten his ostenta
tious pledge to such an extent that
he is a definite menace to the audi
ence.
We wonder if Stanford has become
so democratic that it allows a dog to
enter class free of charge, or is
Stanford just turning into a glorified
dog kennel?
—Just Being Plebian.
