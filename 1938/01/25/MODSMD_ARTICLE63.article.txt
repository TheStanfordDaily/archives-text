# THAT GHOST AGAIN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Don Quixote Cobbs chose a
ghost writer for his windmill in
Thursday's Bull Session. Said Mr.
Cobbs in paragraph five:
"When you split a verb and say,
'I feel that I may confidently pro
duce the piece of work desired,' it is
time that you get somebody to
handle the writing end of your busi
ness."
Said Mi-. Cobbs in paragraph sev
en, splitting a verb on his own hook:
. .a virtue which you can't of
course permit yourself."
We can stand on your empty elo
quence, Mr. Cobbs, but do preserve
your superb consistency, you sofa
pillow philosopher, you.
English Major
