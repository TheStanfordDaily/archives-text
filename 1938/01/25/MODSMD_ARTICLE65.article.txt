# PANAY PROBE CONTINUES

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 (UP). -
State Department officials today
awaited further reports of the condi
tion of the injured in the bombing
and sinking of the U.S. gunboat
Panay before attempting to compile
the total monetary damages for pre
sentation to Japan. Officials said
there was no way at present to esti
mate the prospective indemnity
which the Japanese government has
asserted in advance it will pay.

Only the fact that water of Yo
semite falls descends in three sec
tions keeps the falls from being the
world's loftiest. A sheer drop would
be 2600 feet.
