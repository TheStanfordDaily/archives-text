# Skiing Loses Minor Sport Recognition
## Excom Reverses Ruling; Maloney Urges More 'Pioneering' In Field 
### 
Afraid that skiing is "just a
mushroom that will disappear over
night," Ex Committee last night
withdrew their recognition of skiing
as a minor sport.
Approval had been granted last
week on condition that (1) the Uni
versity be relieved of liability in
case of accident, (2) a definite basis
be fixed for awards, and (3) the j
B.A.C. approve the action.
But Harry Maloney, director of
minor sports, did not approve. Rec
ommending that skiers spend an
other year or so in "pioneering," he
advised committee members to
withhold their recognition and let
students ski "for the love of the
sport."
Maloney Objects
Mr. Maloney objected on grounds
that present enthusiasm may be only
temporary. His other arguments
were that the sport is expensive, dis
tant, and intermittent —can be play
ed only when there is snow.
Willy Meyer, Swiss ski coach, an
swered objections with the same
enthusiastic logic he employed last
week. He had looked through Ex
Committee's minutes, and found
skiers had been "pioneering" for
two years, meanwhile applying for
minor sport recognition.
"Even at Dartmouth," he said,
"the skiers usually have to go off
the campus to practice, and they
send teams to Europe. This doesn't
happen in very many other sports."
Expense Slight
The expense is not prohibitive, he
said, citing the Christmas training
camp, at which board and room cost
$1.25 a day.
Put forward as Ex Committee's
chief objections were contentions
that skiing is expensive in time and
money, not open to everyone, a
sport for individuals.
President Tom Killefer reminded
' Ihe committee that the Farm is the
la.sl of the "big four" — U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., U.C., and Stanford — to
recognize the sport.
'Let It Go'
"Let it go for a while," suggested
Phil Klauber, "and sometime we
can buy a few sweaters that they can
wear around here with a big red
ski across their chests."
With the skiing question settled
for another week, Ex Committee
tackled one of its touchy little in
ternational problems. Jackie Brown
was named chairman of a commit
tee to consider Stanford's part in
raising $25,000 for non-partisan stu
dent relief in the Far East, 2 per
cent of the proceeds to go to Japa
nese students.
Said Bob Garretson: "I don't see
why it's non-partisan with only 2
per cent going to the Japanese."
When he was named as Jackie
Brown's assistant, she suggested they
have three on the committee. Jean
Reynolds was named.
Election Okayed
Other business included approval
of the Daily editorial staff election.
In spite of the Hawaiian Club's
three-man offensive, Cap and Gown
was given the spring quarter Reg
Dance.
Other dates granted were Alphi
Delta Phi. Feb. 25; Encina Club,
Feb. 25; Delta Chi, Feb. 26; Delta
Delta Delta, Feb. 26.

be fixed for awards, and (3) the j
B.A.C. approve the action.
But Harry Maloney, director of
minor sports, did not approve. Rec
ommending that skiers spend an
other year or so in "pioneering," he
advised committee members to
withhold their recognition and let
students ski "for the love of the
sport."
Maloney Objects
Mr. Maloney objected on grounds
that present enthusiasm may be only
temporary. His other arguments
were that the sport is expensive, dis
tant, and intermittent —can be play
ed only when there is snow.
Willy Meyer, Swiss ski coach, an
swered objections with the same
enthusiastic logic he employed last
week. He had looked through Ex
Committee's minutes, and found
skiers had been "pioneering" for
two years, meanwhile applying for
minor sport recognition.
"Even at Dartmouth," he said,
"the skiers usually have to go off
the campus to practice, and they
send teams to Europe. This doesn't
happen in very many other sports."
Expense Slight
The expense is not prohibitive, he
said, citing the Christmas training
camp, at which board and room cost
$1.25 a day.
Put forward as Ex Committee's
chief objections were contentions
that skiing is expensive in time and
money, not open to everyone, a
sport for individuals.
President Tom Killefer reminded
' Ihe committee that the Farm is the
la.sl of the "big four" — U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., U.C., and Stanford — to
recognize the sport.
'Let It Go'
"Let it go for a while," suggested
Phil Klauber, "and sometime we
can buy a few sweaters that they can
wear around here with a big red
ski across their chests."
With the skiing question settled
for another week, Ex Committee
tackled one of its touchy little in
ternational problems. Jackie Brown
was named chairman of a commit
tee to consider Stanford's part in
raising $25,000 for non-partisan stu
dent relief in the Far East, 2 per
cent of the proceeds to go to Japa
nese students.
Said Bob Garretson: "I don't see
why it's non-partisan with only 2
per cent going to the Japanese."
When he was named as Jackie
Brown's assistant, she suggested they
have three on the committee. Jean
Reynolds was named.
Election Okayed
Other business included approval
of the Daily editorial staff election.
In spite of the Hawaiian Club's
three-man offensive, Cap and Gown
was given the spring quarter Reg
Dance.
Other dates granted were Alphi
Delta Phi. Feb. 25; Encina Club,
Feb. 25; Delta Chi, Feb. 26; Delta
Delta Delta, Feb. 26.
Afraid that skiing is "just a
mushroom that will disappear over
night," Ex Committee last night
withdrew their recognition of skiing
as a minor sport.
Approval had been granted last
week on condition that (1) the Uni
versity be relieved of liability in
case of accident, (2) a definite basis
be fixed for awards, and (3) the j
B.A.C. approve the action.
