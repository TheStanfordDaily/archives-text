"Five Star Final," Louis Wiet
zenkorn's dramatic indictment of the
tabloids, has been picked for
Stagers' February reading. Jack
Dawson, play reading manager said
yesterday.
Preliminary casting was held
yesterday, but no parts have been
assigned. Tryouts will continue to
day in the Little Theater from 1 to
2 o'clock. The play, selected from
three including "The Masque of
Kings," and "You Can't Take It
With You," concerns the tragedy
caused when a sensational paper
revives an old scandal.
Concerning production date, J.
P. Cahn, director, said that the
Committee of Public Exercises is
"still shuffling events to get us in
during the first week of February."
Director Cahn urges all new talent
to try out for the reading.
