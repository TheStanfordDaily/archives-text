### 
MESA, Ariz., Jan. 25 (UP).â€”Ari
zona's new $2000 "iron lung," in
use for the first time, fought alone
today the battle of science for the
life of 17-year-old Jack Shill, Mesa
high school basketball star, suffer
ing a rapidly ascending paralysis.
The youth's ailment, which re
mained undiagnosed for more than
a week after he complained of
aches in his legs, was revealed by
Dr. Melvin L. Kent today to be
Landry's paralysis. The physician
said Shill's lungs were almost com
pletely paralyzed and he was able
to breathe but 25 per cent of ca
pacity.
The youthful athlete, with only "a
remote" chance of ever walking
again, would die for lack of air
within a few minutes if deprived of
the mechanical respirator's aid, Dr.
Kent said.
