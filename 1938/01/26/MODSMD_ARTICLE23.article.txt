CAL'S BEST FROSH
TRACK TEAM —MORSE
Over at 800-erkeley, Brutus
Hamilton, track coach of the Bears,
claims he has the strongest frosh
track team in the history of his ca
reer as a mentor.
Brutus claims he has 'em three
deep in most spots. They have
six half-milers, all of whom are
two-minute runners; a quartet of
high hurdlers who were all around
the 15 flat mark in high school;
a trio of low hurdlers who arc
purported to have hit at least 25
flat in prep school; three high
jumpers who have cleared the six
fool mark and over; four discus
throwers over 130 feet: and many
others.
Brick Morse, Cal's perennial soph
omore, goes Brutus one better by
stating that this year's frosh team
is the best he has ever seen at Cal,
which covers quite a bit of terri
tory, annually speaking.
BEAR VARSITY NO
PUSHOVER EITHER
The Californians are going to
have quite a varsity track team this
season, too. The Bears have real
.si length in practically all events.
The 800-erkeleyites boast of three
javelin throwers, f'rinstajice, who
can take one, two, three in the Big
Meet. The javelin is the weakest
event in the Card lineup, but still
George "Bernard" Shaw tossed the
spear 190 feet the other night out
on Angell Field. This throw is
probably the best practice heave
made on the Coast this early in the
year.
With a little improvement and
plenty of hard training, Shaw can
trim Doug Lehman, Guy Manuel,
and Dave Anderson of Cal.
HALF MILE IS
BEAR STRONGHOLD
Cal's biggest stronghold is the
half-mile where Brutus boasts of
three lads who have done better
than 1:55. Elton Weiman and
Leonard Spencer, regular half
milers of last year, will be rein
forced by the addition of De Mott
Modisette, frosh phenomenon of last
year.
Carl Mahurin of Stanford is cap
able of taking all three Bears into
camp, and Rusty March may come
into his own this year for a few
places.
Arnold Nutting, 25'5", and Guy
Manuel, 24'U" seem to have the
broadjump situation sewed up for
Cal, although Ray Brown, Card
frosh champ of last year, may de
velop into a serious contender.
Cal has three ace distance run
ners who are going to give Ed Bur
icvvs and John Emmanuel of the
Indians plenty of trouble in the mile
and two mile. They go by the

labels of Charlie Mehlert, Lucas
Powe, and Stan Sadaj.
As things stand now it looks as
though Dink Templeton's scantily
clad warriors have the advantage in
eight out of 15 events. Cardinal
favored events at present are: 440,
Ray Malott; mile, Ed Burrows; high
hurdles, Bill Hawkins; low hurdles,
Johnny Hewitt; discus, Pete Zagar;
shotput, Bill Wohle; high jump,
Russ Wolf; and pole vault, Vic
Boore.-—Gene Gear.
