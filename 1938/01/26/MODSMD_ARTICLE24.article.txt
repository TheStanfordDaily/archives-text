# Indian Hoop Squad Drills For U.C.L.A.
## Practice Meets Short; Hoopmen To Entrain For South Tomorrow 
### WALT PETERSON 
The varsity basketballers aren't
getting it for very long these after
noons — the first string, that is —
but they're getting it in stiff doses.
Practice is what they're getting,
practice that lasts only until about
5:30 but which is kept at a brisk pace
all the way through. Yesterday
Coach John Bunn put the starting
gang of Luisetti, Zonne, Stoefen,
Calderwood and Lee through a
scrimmage with fast breaks, against
the third stringers.
Defense Slow
Defensively, the starters looked
none too sharp. The third stringers
worked the ball in or they shot from
far out, but somehow they kept the
ball bouncing around the backboard
and through the hoop fairly consis
tently.
On offense, things didn't gtart pep
ping up until the latter part of the
scrum, when Coach Bunn gave the
varsity the ball and told them to
work on nothing but offense against
the thirds. They began to click at
length like the Indians of old, with
Stoefen and Zonne in particular
showing signs of normalcy.
Head For South
The same deal faces the varsity
today and tomorrow, after which
they entrain for Los Angeles and a
pair of battles with the U.C.L.A.
Bruins Friday and Saturday nights.
'Tis said the Bruins are ambling
around with moss on their backs
from being in the conference cellar
so long, but the Cards don't figure
on being nice to them because of
that.
Two victories being essential to a
Stanford championship for the third
year, the team will go south with the
idea of winning the pair and showing
the rest of the coast there's some
life in the old boy yet.
