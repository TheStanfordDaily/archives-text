# Breakers Yell 'Yea Team!' As Bowlmen Win
## 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
It seems that a revolution is brew- J
ing, in fact boiling, in the Breakers j
Factory for Broken-down Bowlers.
Definite and certified proof has I
finally come through by four
motored carrier pigeon service di
rect from the gutters of bowling
alleys to the effect that a champion- I
ship match between The Daily ;
Sports Staff and Breakers ended up
with a victory for the latter.
So ,the winners have demanded 1
(with death by drowning with j
waterbags as a penalty for refusal) j
the immediate publication of the
scores. Being allergic to water, we
hasten to our rescue:

ways did think carrier pigeons were J
slow. Total scores, in case you j
aren't a mathematician, are 1754 for ;
Breakers, 1543 for The Daily Sports |
Staff.
Today another classic will be put
on the scoreboards when the Alpha
Sig team meets the Kappa Sig quar
tet.
Thrill-of-the-week fell through ■
when the Pi Phi team, which was |
scheduled to meet The Daily Staff- ;
ers in a match, decided that, the an- !
nouncement of an engagement had !
to be listened to, leaving the Staff
men in the cold with no bowling
match, no Pi Phis. Very cold.
This classic may be played soon,
but in the meantime the sports
writers are negotiating for a little
deal with the Tri-Delt bowlers, who ,
are said to be terrific.

are said to be terrific.
It seems that a revolution is brew- J
ing, in fact boiling, in the Breakers j
Factory for Broken-down Bowlers.
Definite and certified proof has I
finally come through by four
motored carrier pigeon service di
rect from the gutters of bowling
alleys to the effect that a champion- I
ship match between The Daily ;
Sports Staff and Breakers ended up
with a victory for the latter.
So ,the winners have demanded 1
(with death by drowning with j
waterbags as a penalty for refusal) j
the immediate publication of the
scores. Being allergic to water, we
hasten to our rescue:
BREAKERS
Stan Mayer 150-169-179: 495!

We hope we are saved. We al- i
ways did think carrier pigeons were J
slow. Total scores, in case you j
aren't a mathematician, are 1754 for ;
Breakers, 1543 for The Daily Sports |
Staff.
Today another classic will be put
on the scoreboards when the Alpha
Sig team meets the Kappa Sig quar
tet.
Thrill-of-the-week fell through ■
when the Pi Phi team, which was |
scheduled to meet The Daily Staff- ;
ers in a match, decided that, the an- !
nouncement of an engagement had !
to be listened to, leaving the Staff
men in the cold with no bowling
match, no Pi Phis. Very cold.
This classic may be played soon,
but in the meantime the sports
writers are negotiating for a little
deal with the Tri-Delt bowlers, who ,
are said to be terrific.
