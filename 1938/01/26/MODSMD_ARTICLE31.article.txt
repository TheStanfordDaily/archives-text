# New Yearling Quintet Keeps Up Hot Pace
## Marshall, Burners Lead Fighting Gortermen On Changed Line-up 
### 
Stanford's newly developed fresh
man basketball combine continues"
to scintillate in practice sessions un
der Coach Wytze Colter's guiding
hand.
The team was thrown so hurriedly J
together that it hasn't as yet devel- '
oped its teamwork to a fine point.
Gorier has been concentrating on |
this angle so far this week.
However, even the most critical
observer can't complain about the
individual abilities of the players
comprising the first string. Don Wil
liams at one forward has been
playing good ball lately with his
clever ball-handling and passing,
combined with accurate shoot
ing.
Marshall, Forward
Bill Marshall, who. towers an in
significant 5 feet 8 under the oppo
sition, holds down one forward spot.
Marshall is the high point scorer of
the team, despite the fact that he
but recently has been promoted to
the first string. Fast and alert, he
is constantly in the other team's
hair, if for no other reason than they
can't see him half the time.
Don Burness, high school phenom
from San Francisco, is the pivot man
of the quintet. Burness is the best
rebounder on the team, a tremen
dous passer and a dead-eye shot.
Being a southpaw, he has an advan
tage over his orthodox opponents.
Davidson Good Guard
Kenny Davidson has been one of
the shining lights of the team with
his work at guard. A fine shot,
adept ball-handler and accurate
passer, his steadiness has balanced
the team. Playing with him on the
defense is Bill Niccolls, a driving
fighter. Next to Marshall, Niccolls'
5 feet 10 makes him the smallest
man on the team, but his terrific
fight more than makes up the de
ficiency.
Friday night the frosh tangle
with Galileo High of San Francisco
and with Santa Rosa High School
Saturday evening.
