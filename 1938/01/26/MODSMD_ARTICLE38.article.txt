# Thompson, Smith Win At Ingleside
## 
### 
One of the largest galleries in local
golfing history watched Jimmie
Thompson team with Horton Smith
to defeat Harry Cooper and Lawson
Little one down in a best ball match
at Ingleside Country Club yesterday
afternoon.
Thompson, still hot from his vic
tory in the Pasadena tournament at
Brookside, turned in the low card
of the day with a 67, while his part
ner, after a good start of two bird
ies, slowed down to come in with a
par of 71.
Lighthorse Harry Cooper, playing
I his usual steady iron game, came in
j with a sub-par 70, as did Lawson
| Little, Stanford's own, who showed
i plainly the effects of eight straight
j days of golf. Little's approaching
' and putting was ragged although he
! did sink one approach shot for a
j birdie from a difficult lie.
I The match was climaxed by birdie
| three's for Thompson and Smith on
! the eighteenth, and two of the most
heartbreaking long putts of the day.
Little's ball went all the way into
the cup and out again, while Coop
er's hesitated on the lip of the cup
after traveling some 25 feet.
