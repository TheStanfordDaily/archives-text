# President Calls Cuts 'Suicidal'
## F. R. Agrees Willi Labor Leader On Wages 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 (UP). -
President Roosevelt today opposed
wage cuts by industry during the
business recession as "suicidal" and
warned that if salaries are slashed
this winter and spring the govern
ment will be forced to consider
"other means" of creating purchas
ing power.
His views were embraced in a
formal statement read at a press
conference a few hours after John L.
Lewis, chairman of the Committee
for Industrial Organization, had an
nounced that labor would fight to
the bitter end against a reduction '.n
wages and prices to offset effects of
the trade slump.
Mr. Roosevelt coupled his warning
with a suggestion that mass produc
tion industries cut their prices to
meet reduced purchasing power.
He brushed aside inquiries as to
what the government would do if
salaries are pared further, but it was
believed he referred to possible re
sumption of federal "pump prim
ing."
The chief executive said his
statement was prompted by statis
tics showing that some business men
in a few sections of the country al
ready had reduced wages and that
similar action is reportedly contem
plated by others.
He made it clear that wage reduc
tions thus far are not widespread.
The president's wage statement
was in reply to a question as to
whether he agreed with a recent
declaration by Benjamin V. Fair
less, president of U. S. Steel Corp.,
that labor is an essential feature in
steel prices and that these prices can
not be reduced unless the wages of
the employes are cut.
"I'm afraid it won't help for me
to answer that question again," the
president said. "I have said so fre
quently—and I do not know how
to say more clearly and unequivo
cably than I have already said—that
I am opposed to wage reductions."
