## Ex Committee Does a Telemark 
### 
A WEEK ago Executive Committee fell in
line behind a clever little man who
knows his diplomacy, and decided to make
skiing a minor sport at Stanford.
Last night the same committee, in the same
room, with arguments put in its mouth by a
Stanford sportsman who knows of what he
speaks, found reasons to refute those of clever
Willy Meyer, and quickly reversed its field.
This week skiing is not a minor sport at
Stanford. But next Tuesday is the "on" week
when Ex Committee will probably make it a
minor sport again, or something.
The right for any ruling body to have enough
intestinal fortitude to change its past decisions
is not to be entirely condemned, but Ex Com
mittee should not make its vacillating policy a
practice.
In this case the ski group, which the Com
mittee apparently desires to foster rather than
discourage, takes the brunt of a hasty decision.
Encouraged to think it had finally won the goal
of three years' effort, the Stanford Ski Club
was ready to uncork the champagne because
Ex Committee almost definitely had declared

it would become a minor sport.
Now the club must forestall the uncorkingâ€”
which cannot help but slow up activities tem
porarily.
The recent spurt in skiing popularity at Stan
ford is one of the evidences that the Univer
sity is keeping abreast of the pack. California,
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. have active skiing groups,
as do most of the universities on the Coast
since the sport edged its way into western
popularity.
If the enthusiasm curve continues to sweep
upward with continuation of its rise during the
last two or three years, there is no reason why
Stanford's Ex Committee should not leave it
on the minor sports list for more than a week.
Then it will be assured that local popularity
was not due entirely to the dynamic person
ality of its Stanford exponent, Willy Meyer,
who built the Ski Club from a defunct Alpine
Club into a vital, active body of 300 enthusiasts.
It is to be hoped that skiing withstands the
stem christie Ex Committee pulled on it last
night, to prove its permanence so definitely
that future minor sports recognition is inevi
table.
