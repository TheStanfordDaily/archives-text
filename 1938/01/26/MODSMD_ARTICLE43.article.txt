# Enterprising 'Y'
## 
### 
ON May 1 the campus will participate in a
peace day program with appropriate
speeches and meetings sponsored by the A. S.
S. U. ( though three years ago there were no
plans for a Peace Day, no organization to make
them.
Forming a committee to institute such a pro
gram was up to someone, fortunately it was
right up the alley of one organization. Since
its establishment at Stanford the Y.W.C.A. has
been providing organized outlets for special
groups—it cpuld take a peace program in its
stride.
Turning the idea over to someone else after
it was on its feet and self-sufficient is also
typical of the "Y." Of the many innovations
it has sponsored, it has kept supervision of
only those that did not fall in the province of
the A.S.S.U. or the Administration. The sponsor
system was one of these. Klahoya and Walrus
clubs have stayed with the "Y" organization.
Other "Y" enterprises nearly would fill this
column. To start them and keep them going
costs money, over a thousand dollars a year,
in fact.
Monday, the "Y" started its annual drive for
these funds. This morning the $1000 goal was
over half reached. Further collections today
should assure no great curtailment of the pro
gram.
To the "Y" The Daily offers congratulations
for unsung work in the past, and lends hope
that the financial mark will be scored by to
night.—L. L.
