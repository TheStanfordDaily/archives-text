# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
WITH ONIONS, PLEASE
YV/ORD lias come to me that the boys in the school
of education have a problem on their hands,
which is not unusual in these troubled days when
hands without problems are scarcer than roommates
who prefer their own neckties. It seems that the edu
cators have been trying for some time to discover what
it is that makes the wheels of college life revolve.
They are not satisfied with the old theory that a
combination of lectures and bull sessions provides the
steam to drive dear alma mater's engine. They are
looking for new forces.
If any of the education majors have some spare
time over the week-end, I suggest that they unleash
the intellectual bloodhounds on the question of early
hour expeditions to Paly after food. Here, I believe,
is the focussing "point for forces that move student life.

There is a small hamburger shop on a sidestreet. in
Paly which is to Stanford what a good drippy cellar
is to the old-school bolsheviks. Here in the well
known still of the night, students gather to cat while
the good burghers fight for their share of the blanket
and dream of dividends.
It is here that Stanford's greatest ideas begin to
bud, and students' grandest dreams are forged with
a hamburger for an anvil. For all student activities
are represented at the nightly assembly. The Daily
totters in shortly after 12, settles down to argue type
and campaigns, and to dream of smash tag lines that
were unprintable. It builds journalistic air castles in
the onion scented air, and goes forth wondering how
to solidify them into type metal.

r â–  IE Chappie boys drop in around publication time,
drink their coffee straight, and snicker at their
jokes. The dramatics crowd comes down after re
hearsal or performances. It spills onto the stools and
over the booths, rowing pleasantly about delivery,
elocution, and curtain calls. It is in these sessions
that the much abused damsel, Art, has her name
dragged in the grease paint, and the Governor's Wife
has her reputation blasted. Occasionally, the words
become heated, when the conversation turns to
whether it would be better to shoot the Daily review
editor on sight, or make him read his own stuff.
Back in the golden age, Jorgenson's current com
mittee used to stop by on the way home from Mora's.
It always took the back booth and discussed ways of
achieving dove-like coups d'etat.

Students with dates come to give love interest to
the tense drama of an editor and his associates ham
mering out policy while the nite eds play catch with
the salt shaker. Taxi drivers doze at the counter,
giving a sturdy proletarian background. There arc
also debaters, Quad staff, and athletes in season.
It is this assembly that guides the Stanford life. It
channels the forces that make the student wheels
lurn. And so I suggest that some footloose education
major drop in and look it over. The service is foul,
but Ihe hamburgers are not bad. John Cobbs.
