# GOIN' MY WAY

For years Red Nichols and his Five Pennies proved
that swing, it was called jazz then, didn't need a large
instrucentation to prove its worth. Those old Nichols
records will always he collector's items.
Today Benny Goodman is repeating Nichols' work
with his Quartet. As most of you know, the quartet
is composed of two white musicians; Benny on clari
net and Gene Krupa on drums; the other half consists
of two colored men, Teddy Wilson on piano and Lionel
Hampton on vibraphones.
Their latest recording, that of "Bei Mir Bist Du
Schoen," Victor 25751, Part One, is the best work they
have ever done. Missing are the blazing negroid tones
of the brass and the x*ounded sax choir, but the loss
seems small after the platter is once heard. The
vocal work is handled by Martha Tilton and she does
a workmanship job with the tune, but the rest of the
record is so marvelous that the vocal listens in* bad
taste.

"Schoen," originally a Jewish Wedding March,
was a ceremonial song for the Jewish people. Some
negroes heard it one night and took the tune back to
Harlem and gave it their own treatment. From Har
lem it worked up to the swing spots in upper New
York, and then to its present position. There is no
doubt in my mind that the tune will always be with
us, thank God!
Up to now I haven't heard any other version of
"Schoen" except that of the Casa Loma, but it will
serve adequately for purposes of comparison. The
Casa. Lomans, once my favorite band, have slipped
very greatly during the last few years. At present
they are what is considered as a good sweet band, but
as for swing, they have just lost the touch. Except
for Hunt and Hutchenrider, they are now a bunch of
sheet men. So when you hear their version of
"Schoen" you will hear a recording that is smooth,
technically correct, and danceable, but Pappy! the
fire has burned out.
* * * *
Now grab a good listen to the Quartet's work. They
take "Schoen" and they fondle it, then Wilson takes
it up to the skies, then Hampton with his great creative
talent on the vibes brings it down low again with some
minor chord work that still leaves me almost speech
less. Krupa hits it all over the place with his sticks,
and then Benny gives it that stuff that makes the whole
record hit you hard as hell somewhere between your
fourth and fifth ribs. There's a big difference between
the feeling you get from "Schoen" and the one that
singing the words to "Jamboree Jones" gives you.
The record is just one of sheer beauty of feeling.
The way the Quartet fades out in the ending of the
first part ought even to convince people with tin ears
of that. So the next time that someone tells you that
Benny smells, ask them with that superior air which
is so easily developed at Stanford, "Have you heard
his recording of "Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen?" and don't
forget to lift your eyebrow when you say it.—McGuirk.

for Hunt and Hutchenrider, they are now a bunch of
sheet men. So when you hear their version of
"Schoen" you will hear a recording that is smooth,
technically correct, and danceable, but Pappy! the
fire has burned out.

Now grab a good listen to the Quartet's work. They
take "Schoen" and they fondle it, then Wilson takes
it up to the skies, then Hampton with his great creative
talent on the vibes brings it down low again with some
minor chord work that still leaves me almost speech
less. Krupa hits it all over the place with his sticks,
and then Benny gives it that stuff that makes the whole
record hit you hard as hell somewhere between your
fourth and fifth ribs. There's a big difference between
the feeling you get from "Schoen" and the one that
singing the words to "Jamboree Jones" gives you.
The record is just one of sheer beauty of feeling.
The way the Quartet fades out in the ending of the
first part ought even to convince people with tin ears
of that. So the next time that someone tells you that
Benny smells, ask them with that superior air which
is so easily developed at Stanford, "Have you heard
his recording of "Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen?" and don't
forget to lift your eyebrow when you say it.—McGuirk.
For years Red Nichols and his Five Pennies proved
that swing, it was called jazz then, didn't need a large
instrucentation to prove its worth. Those old Nichols
records will always he collector's items.
Today Benny Goodman is repeating Nichols' work
with his Quartet. As most of you know, the quartet
is composed of two white musicians; Benny on clari
net and Gene Krupa on drums; the other half consists
of two colored men, Teddy Wilson on piano and Lionel
Hampton on vibraphones.
Their latest recording, that of "Bei Mir Bist Du
Schoen," Victor 25751, Part One, is the best work they
have ever done. Missing are the blazing negroid tones
of the brass and the x*ounded sax choir, but the loss
seems small after the platter is once heard. The
vocal work is handled by Martha Tilton and she does
a workmanship job with the tune, but the rest of the
record is so marvelous that the vocal listens in* bad
taste.

"Schoen," originally a Jewish Wedding March,
was a ceremonial song for the Jewish people. Some
negroes heard it one night and took the tune back to
Harlem and gave it their own treatment. From Har
lem it worked up to the swing spots in upper New
York, and then to its present position. There is no
doubt in my mind that the tune will always be with
us, thank God!
Up to now I haven't heard any other version of
"Schoen" except that of the Casa Loma, but it will
serve adequately for purposes of comparison. The
Casa. Lomans, once my favorite band, have slipped
very greatly during the last few years. At present
they are what is considered as a good sweet band, but
as for swing, they have just lost the touch. Except
for Hunt and Hutchenrider, they are now a bunch of
sheet men. So when you hear their version of
"Schoen" you will hear a recording that is smooth,
technically correct, and danceable, but Pappy! the
fire has burned out.
