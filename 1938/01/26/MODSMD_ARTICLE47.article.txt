# Cast Sparkles As Bohemians In Geary Play
## 
### 
"Yes, My Darling Daughter," as
most people know by now, is the
story of an enlightened daughter

who practices
what an enlight
ened mother once
preached — and
practiced — i n
Greenwich Vill
age.
What they do
not know, unless
they have been
to the Geary and
seen the play, is

that under the skillful tutelage of
Florence Reed and a sparkling cast,
it emerges a completely charming
comedy, nothing to set the Bay on
fire, perhaps, but a very pleasant
way to spend an evening.
When Ann Whitman Murray, who
spent her salad days emancipating
herself in the Village, discovers that
her daughter Ellen proposes to go
off for a week-end with her fiance,
her reaction, dictated by the fact
that she is now a sedate woman of
letters, is to object. Ellen's reaction
to this, dictated by the fact that she
has been doing research for a paper
on "Greenwich Village, Its Contri
bution to the Advance of American
Art and Morals," is flippant but to
the point.
Further complicated by the ar
rival of her co-partner in Village
sin, Ann's case is shot completely to
pieces by her romantic memories of
young love and once-in-a-lifetime
happiness, and she eventually capi
tulates with the heckled remark,
"God damn sex, anyway!" And
Ellen goes off with her man.
When she returns, and when the
boy, Doug, finds out that her mother
knew what was going on all the
time, he begins to get mad, and for
a time threatens to leave forever.
Happiness for everybody is only
saved by Ann, who comes through
with the second good curtain-line of
the evening.
As Ann, Florence Reed is excel
lent, handling her comedy and her
serious moments with perfect ease,
lending her gracious presence to the
portrait of the gracious lady whose
daughter investigates her mother's
past with her English professor.
Agnes Doyle's Ellen couldn't be
better. Assured, flippant, and like
able, she knows all the answers and
never hesitates to use them to get
what she wants. Lawrence Gros
smith as Titus Jaywood, Ann's old
flame, contributes dignity and a
good deal of humor to the proceed
ings, and John Franklin, as Doug,
Boyd Davis, as Mr. Murray, and
Regina Wallace as his much-married
sister, complete a perfect cast.
"Yes, My Darling Daughter" is
staying another week at the Geary,
and it might be well to drop around
sometime. It's a lot of fun.—A.S.D.

story of an enlightened daughter

who practices
what an enlight
ened mother once
preached — and
practiced — i n
Greenwich Vill
age.
What they do
not know, unless
they have been
to the Geary and
seen the play, is

that under the skillful tutelage of
Florence Reed and a sparkling cast,
it emerges a completely charming
comedy, nothing to set the Bay on
fire, perhaps, but a very pleasant
way to spend an evening.
When Ann Whitman Murray, who
spent her salad days emancipating
herself in the Village, discovers that
her daughter Ellen proposes to go
off for a week-end with her fiance,
her reaction, dictated by the fact
that she is now a sedate woman of
letters, is to object. Ellen's reaction
to this, dictated by the fact that she
has been doing research for a paper
on "Greenwich Village, Its Contri
bution to the Advance of American
Art and Morals," is flippant but to
the point.
Further complicated by the ar
rival of her co-partner in Village
sin, Ann's case is shot completely to
pieces by her romantic memories of
young love and once-in-a-lifetime
happiness, and she eventually capi
tulates with the heckled remark,
"God damn sex, anyway!" And
Ellen goes off with her man.
When she returns, and when the
boy, Doug, finds out that her mother
knew what was going on all the
time, he begins to get mad, and for
a time threatens to leave forever.
Happiness for everybody is only
saved by Ann, who comes through
with the second good curtain-line of
the evening.
As Ann, Florence Reed is excel
lent, handling her comedy and her
serious moments with perfect ease,
lending her gracious presence to the
portrait of the gracious lady whose
daughter investigates her mother's
past with her English professor.
Agnes Doyle's Ellen couldn't be
better. Assured, flippant, and like
able, she knows all the answers and
never hesitates to use them to get
what she wants. Lawrence Gros
smith as Titus Jaywood, Ann's old
flame, contributes dignity and a
good deal of humor to the proceed
ings, and John Franklin, as Doug,
Boyd Davis, as Mr. Murray, and
Regina Wallace as his much-married
sister, complete a perfect cast.
"Yes, My Darling Daughter" is
staying another week at the Geary,
and it might be well to drop around
sometime. It's a lot of fun.—A.S.D.
