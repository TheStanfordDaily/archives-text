The Editor, Sir:

j dents and alumni give the "Sincere
ly and sentimentally yours. Howard
i Deems," the collective raspberry.
Deems pictures himself as the valu
able alumnus holding a Block S
card, who has had the exceptional
| interest of making use of same eight
times in 16 years, and then to bring
a prospective athlete to a game.
He speaks of the paltry few dol
lars it costs Ihe B.A.C. Can't
Deems afford a "paltry few dollars"
| eight times in 16 years? And then
the big baby says if his card privi
: leges are taken away he'll groom
i his "prospective athletes" for any
; where else on the coast — even
; U.S.C. (and Cal too, I suppose).
| That statement shows the true
! colors and insides of the inimitable
: Mr. Deems! From such loyalty as
that we desire nothing.
Men he might bring to Stanford
would undoubtedly fit much better
at U.S.C. or Cal as would Mr. Deems
j himself. Take your card, Mr. Deems,
j and your prospective athletes of
