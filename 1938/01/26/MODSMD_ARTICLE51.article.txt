# UNION SOLUTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While wandering quite innocently
after having completed two hours of
solid study in the Libe (honest!),
thinking to clear our slightly be
fogged brains over a convivial coke,
we sat ourselves down at the cellar
counter.
Up came a hasher.
"Plain coke," said one of us.
"Make it two," said the other.
Unaccustomed to being regarded
either as twins or a lamebrain, the
latter was surprised, but not too
pleased, to be taken literally. He
got his two cokes. The other, only
one.
As this was on Sunday afternoon,
we immediately deduced that de
spite recent agitation, this was no.
part of the Cellar's new policy of
extra-helpings, which does not go
into effect until Monday.
In a moment of regrettable weak
ness, no doubt caused by the study
ing, nothing was said to the over
enthusiastic hasher.
We can now definitely assert that
no further explanations by Mr. Lap
ham are necessary. The Union
profit deal is solved. Order two
cokes; get three; pay three. This
foiTnula also should appeal to the
economics department.
â€”Cokie Flo and Cokie Joe.
