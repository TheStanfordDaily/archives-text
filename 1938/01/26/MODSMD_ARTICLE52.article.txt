# STAGERS SPEAK

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since the opening of the last pro
duction of the Department of Speech
and Drama there have been in
quiries as to whether this production
was connected with Stagers.
We wish to explain that Stagers
is a student organization entirely in
dependent from the Department of
Speech and Drama.
Stagers gives three major pro
ductions during the year — The '
Gaieties; the Winter Show, which is
"Blue Jeans" to be given this quar
ter; and the annual Spring Musical
Show.
Feeling that the more intellectual
side of drama is adequately taken
care of by the Department of Speech
and Drama, Stagers' main purpose
is to appeal to general student in
terest by producing such shows as
light comedies and musical shows,
as well as current Broadway suc
cesses in the form of play readings.
Since Stagers is a student or
ganization it welcomes any student
who wishes to try out for one of its
shows or readings.
When tryouts are scheduled for
the Spring Show, Stagers hopes that
anyone with any previous acting or
musical experience either at Stan
ford or elsewhere will report.
Sincerely,
Clay McDaniel
