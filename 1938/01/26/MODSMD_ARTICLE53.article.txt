# Large Crowd Enjoys Dunce Presentations
## 
### MARY ELIZABETH SMITH 
A dance recital by the well
known team of Harry Hamilton and
Wana Williams was given last eve
ning an Memorial Hall as part of
the Tuesday night series. The
crowded hall attested to the popu
larity of their skillfully constructed,
often amusing, numbers.
The first dance, "Journey to the
End of Night," struck a sombre note
with an element of weirdness end
ing in death. The next two num
bers, "Renaissance" and "Cere
monia.l" were perhaps too purely
technical to be fully appreciated by
the average spectator, but they of
fered a fine opportunity for the
dancers to interpret abstracts with
grace and formal perfection.
'Caricature' Applauded
"Caricatures," with Hamilton as
the "Hitch Hiker," and "Waldo,"
were clever, amusing, and gener
ously applauded by a delighted aud
ience. In the first, Hamilton gave
the "Hitch Hiker" all the devil-may
care, swaggering, gum-chewing non
chalance his easy grace made poss
ible.
In "Waldo," he was a sissy little
boy showing off for his girl friend
in a perfect imitation of awkward,
small-boy antics. "Pastorale in Dis
cord" was also a "Caricature" in
which Wana Williams, the shepherd
ess, disturbed Hamilton at his day
dreaming (of another girl), coaxing
him to dance with her.
Dance-Duo
"Song of Songs," a duo-dance, was
a charming picture of grace, as both
danced in flowing white robes on a
blue-lighted stage. Miss Williams
danced with tempestuous abandon
in the lively "Maelstrom."
"Indictment"—an extremely mod
ern duo-dance—followed. Search
lights swept the darkened stage, ma
chine guns chattered, while two ref
ugees sought escape from the law,
but fell dead together. The last
number was a triumph of farce
mixed with charming technique.
'First Appearance'
Mr. Hamilton was alone in "First
Appearance," the first part of "Bag
atelles." He portrayed a harassed
young dancer trying a little bit of
every sort of style in a vain effort to
please his first audience. Miss Will
iams joined him in the second part,
'A Student of the New School." She
was the dancing teacher endeavoring
to instruct an awkward new-comer
who followed her every movement
with jerky energy; finally giving up
in comical despair.
The pair were called back for
numerous curtain calls by the ap
preciative audience. The sound ef
fects and lighting throughout added
much to the success of the recital.

A crew of ocean divers soon will
try to recover $250,000 in gold bars
which sank with the liner Lauren
tic during the World war, off the
coast of County Donegal.
