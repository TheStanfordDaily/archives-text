# Juniors Sign Ben McGuire For M.C. Post
## 
### 
Ben McGuire, a would-be maniac
and the only man capable of hand
ling the difficult task, according to
experts, has been definitely signed
to act as master of ceremonies for
the Cal-Stanford Jamboree.-
The Jamboree, which is sponsored
by the junior class, will follow di
rectly after the next California bas
ketball game on February 4.
Jack Laney and Betty Davis,
chairmen of the Jamboree commit
tee, have arranged a program that
will include an evening of dancing
and entertainment. Among the per
formers who will appear during the
evening are Larry Randall, the Zook
twins with a special act, and a
piano duo. All the performers were
starred in the 1937 Big Game Gaie
ties. Plans are being made to secure
the services of the Theta vocal trio.
The Jamboree, which will be an
all-university affair, is intended to
promote publicity for the main
event, the Junior Prom. The junior
executive committee felt that a jam
boree would prove more popular
with the students than a dinner, and
decided to invite the visiting Cal
students to attend with their dates.
The necessary arrangements to
get together with the Berkeley stu
dents are being made by George
Chalmers. He will be assisted by
Jack Trefts, Deane Johnson, Sanford
Butts, Eleanor Hatch, and Edwina
Butts.
