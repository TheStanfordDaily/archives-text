WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (UP).—
John L. Lewis, chairman of the
Committee for Industrial Organiza
tion, today offered to make a con
ditional peace with the American
Federation of Labor, under which
either the A.F.L. would absorb the
C.1.0., or vice vei - sa.
Addressing the biennial conven
tion of the United Mine Workers of
America, of which he is president,
Lewis issued a virtual challenge to
the Federation, whose executive
council is now meeting in Miami,
Fla.
"If the Federation wants peace,"
he said, "I will recommend to the
4,000.000 members of the C.1.0. that
on Feb. 1 they march into the Fed
eration—on horse, foot or dragoon
—if the Federation will issue char
ters to C.1.0. units and later call a
convention to arrange details.
"But, if this be not pleasing to the
Federation leaders, we offer the al
ternative proposal that on Feb. 1
the entire membership of the Fed
eration march into the C.1.0.—0n
horse, foot or dragoon — and the
C.1.0. will issue charters to all their
units and later call a convention to
arrange the details."
