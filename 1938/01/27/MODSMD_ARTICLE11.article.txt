# Toyon Hall Starts New Forum Series
## 
### 
Toyon Hall initiated a new plan
in student-faculty relations Tues
day evening, with an informal forum
from 9 until 10:30 o'clock. Professor
H. J. Rathbun led the discussion,
which centered around "A Living
Philosophy." About 20 students dis
cussed objects of living, how to live,
and what college teaches us about
living.
The forum is the first of a pro
posed series to be held every week,
probably with some professor as
the leader. The second forum is
tentatively scheduled for next Tues
day evening and will probably have
Professor Robert T. Ross of the
psychology department as leader.
