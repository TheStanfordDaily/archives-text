### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 26 (UP).—
An allegation that "Harry Bridges is
afraid to call his C.1.0. longshore
men out on strike" was made here
today by Charles G. Peabody, vice
president and organizer for the Pa
cific Coast district A. F. of L. long
shoremen.
Peabody said the Pacific Coast or
ganizer for the C.1.0. "knows the
men are getting sick of the C.1.0.
One more strike and the men will
return to the A. F. of L. faster than
they are now. We already have
3500 on the Coast.
"Bridges claims the A. F. of L. has
only 15 longshoremen in San Pedro.
This probably comes about due to
the fact that only 15 names were
signatory to a court action. There
are hundreds down there and he
knows it."
