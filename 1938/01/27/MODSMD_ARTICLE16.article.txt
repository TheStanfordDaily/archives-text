# Wall Street Drops To New Bottom
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 26 (UP). -
President Roosevelt's contention that
industry should maintain wages and
cut prices to expand markets sharp
ly reduced Wall Street hopes for an
early business-administration rap
prochement today and unleashed a
general wave of liquidation in se
curity markets.
Stocks plunged 1 to 6 points in
heavy trading, with liquidation in
the first two hours reminiscent of
the October 1937 break. Rails fell
to new lows since 1935 on the aver
ages, while utilities were only
slightly above those levels. Indus
trials maintained part of the sweep
ing gains recorded in the first two
weeks this year.
