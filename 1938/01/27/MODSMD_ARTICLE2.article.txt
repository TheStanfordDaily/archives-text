# Drive For 'Buck' Club Starts Here

### 
An immediate campaign for 40
Tiny - Buck -of - the - Month Club
memberships to be raised upon tbe
campus will be started by the Axe
Society today, it was announced by
Bud Milligan, head of the organiza
tion, after its meeting last night.
The Buck Club, alumni organiza
tion started two years ago to con
solidate all efforts toward Stanford
athletic scholarships, and now num
bering over 2000 contributors, is now
declared to be recession-hit, has be
come hard pressed in maintaining
funds for those men whom they have
brought to Stanford, and who must
depend on the club for future tui
tion. Four men on the club rolls
stand to be dropped from registra
tion unless tuition funds are secured
for them before early next week.
The Axe Society plans to work
wholly through living group man
agers, and will ask each for $12, to
cover one year's membership in the
Buck Club. The money requested
may be raised by any means selected
by the managers.
"These contributions will be an
nounced by organization names in
the Buck Club's monthly periodical,
which has over 2500 circulation,"
said Milligan last night. "I think it
is a commendable campaign, both
from the standpoint of these four
needy fellows, and from that of bet
terment of alumni-student relation
ships."
