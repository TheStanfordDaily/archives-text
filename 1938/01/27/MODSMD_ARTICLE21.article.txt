# Paul Crary Named Stagers President
## 
### 
Paul Crary was elected president
of Stagers Monday to fill the va
cancy created by the resignation of
Bud Cady, first head of the new
dramatic honorary society.
Cady is no longer able to handle
the duties of the position because
he is carrying an exceptionally
heavy schedule of studies. Crary,
selected at a meeting of Stagers in
the Little Theater Monday, will take
office immediately and will hold it
until the regular term lapses next
June.
He is a student in the Law School
and has been prominent in campus
dramatics and play-readings for the
past four years. Crary was a char
ter member of Barnstormers and a
member of Sword and Sandals and
Rams Head before these organiza
tions were dissolved.
