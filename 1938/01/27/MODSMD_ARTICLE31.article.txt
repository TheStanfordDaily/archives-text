Stanford's faculty-alumni commit
tee, which has been arranging for a
campus play by an alumnus, receiv
ed permission Tuesday to present the
first off-Broadway release of Max
well Anderson's new play, "Star
Wagon," which is now running in
New York.
The committee met last night after
word had been received from Ander
son, to set a definite date some time
early in April and to discuss an
alumni staff. Invitations have been
extended to Farm graduates who
have won honors on the professional
.stage and it is expected that a dis
tinguished cast will be presented.
Anderson, holding a master's de
gree from Stanford, has demon
strated his interest in his alma mater
in numerous ways, notably by es
tablishing a verse drama competi
tion.
A movement has been started to
correct the drinking problem on the
U.S.C. campus after a survey showed
that most of the students indulged.
