### 
NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Jan. 26
(UP). â€”Thousands of tons of icej
massed in a solid mountain 90 feet
high at the foot of the Niagara Falls,
tonight began breaking up Falls View
Bridge, one of the world's most
famous spans.
Trapped in the giant glacier, the
bridge, which links the United
States to Canada about 1000 feet
below the mighty cataracts, was
crumbling piece by piece under the
tremendous pressure of an ice jam
moving slowly down the river.
Authorities said the collapse of the
historic span, which holds romantic
memories for millions of honey
mooners, was only a matter of time.
