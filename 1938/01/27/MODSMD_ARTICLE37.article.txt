## EXCOM ON SKI(D)S 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
Regarding the action of Ex Com
mittee in reversing its decision to
j make skiing a minor sport, it did
| not do a telemark—it did a sitzmark.
Of all the raw decisions which Ex
| Committee has made during the
j four years I have been here, this one
! is the rawest.
As a ski club member who is not j
an expert on skis, who is not trying j
out forth 6 team, it makes no ma
terial difference to me just what '
action is taken. However there are j
j many reasons why the newest stand
i taken by Ex Committee is illogical, j
One of the arguments is that ski- !
I ing is expensive. The team is not !
I asking the school to bear the ex- !
■ pense of transportation to and from '
; the snowfields, nor the cost of j
' equipment. What expense there is
would be very slight. m
Skiers Increase
The argument was also raised that i
the popularity of skiing may be \
1 temporary. Is it conceivable that j
j people who have spent $20 to $70
on ski clothes and equipment will j
| let them stay around the house
! without being used?
Skiing offers an opportunity for j
people to get into the open during
\vinter, regardless of the weather. !
The sport has been popular for ;
some time at Dartmouth and at
j Washington, and its popularity has j
J not ebbed. The number of skiers at ;
both of the schools has increased j
over the last five years.
Another objection offered to the
recognition of skiing is the fact that
it is intermittent. Few people re- 1
alize the length of the skiing season !
in California. The season normally ;
begins around the middle of De
j cember and lasts in such spots as !
j Yosemite and Soda Springs until j
the end of April. If one does not i
; mind a slightly longer drive, he can
jgo to Lassen Volcanic National
Park, where a ski tournament is
j held annually during the last week
end in June and v/here, at that time,
the snow banks along the side of
the Loop highway are as high as six
feet. Of course, a six-month ski
season is very short, although foot
ball, including Spring practice, lasts
at the most for five months.

With the increased popularity of ;
the sport, a prospective student try- |
ing to decide which university he ;
will go to, will, if skiing is the only j
sport in which he is proficient, put j
much weight on the recognition
! given the sport in the various Cali
j fornia universities. i
j To "funny-man" Klauber it might I
be added that the team is not in
terested in sweaters as such, al
though Mr. Klauber probably would
be were he on the team, but is in
terested chiefly in the development
of the sport at Stanford. The best
way in which this development can
be accelerated is by giving skiing
j recognition as a minor sport.

Skiing offers an opportunity for j
people to get into the open during
\vinter, regardless of the weather. !
The sport has been popular for ;
some time at Dartmouth and at
j Washington, and its popularity has j
J not ebbed. The number of skiers at ;
both of the schools has increased j
over the last five years.
Another objection offered to the
recognition of skiing is the fact that
it is intermittent. Few people re- 1
alize the length of the skiing season !
in California. The season normally ;
begins around the middle of De
j cember and lasts in such spots as !
j Yosemite and Soda Springs until j
the end of April. If one does not i
; mind a slightly longer drive, he can
jgo to Lassen Volcanic National
Park, where a ski tournament is
j held annually during the last week
end in June and v/here, at that time,
the snow banks along the side of
the Loop highway are as high as six
feet. Of course, a six-month ski
season is very short, although foot
ball, including Spring practice, lasts
at the most for five months.

the sport, a prospective student try- |

way in which this development can
be accelerated is by giving skiing

I The Editor, Sir:
Regarding the action of Ex Com
mittee in reversing its decision to
j make skiing a minor sport, it did
| not do a telemark—it did a sitzmark.
Of all the raw decisions which Ex
| Committee has made during the
j four years I have been here, this one
! is the rawest.
As a ski club member who is not j
an expert on skis, who is not trying j
out forth 6 team, it makes no ma
terial difference to me just what '
action is taken. However there are j
j many reasons why the newest stand
i taken by Ex Committee is illogical, j
One of the arguments is that ski- !
I ing is expensive. The team is not !
I asking the school to bear the ex- !
■ pense of transportation to and from '
; the snowfields, nor the cost of j
' equipment. What expense there is
would be very slight. m
