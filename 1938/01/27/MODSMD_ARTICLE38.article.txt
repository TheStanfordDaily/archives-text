# PERSONAL PROBLEMS GRIPE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Professors often tell their unruly
| freshman students, "You are out of
! high school now; you are no longer j
| children." I feel it is high time to
j make this remark to one member of |
' the faculty, specifically the head of j
the course in Personal Problems in
Modem Society.
Today, four of us in the Business
School, a serious institution attended
by students ostensibly serious and
far removed from the flighty, jocose
actioois which characterized their
high school days, attempted to audit
this course. We were greeted with
the I'ebuff: "I am sorry, but only
students properly registered are ad
mitted to this class."
Ejected in a state of confusion, I
returned after the hour was over to
enqu n the reason for this seem
ingly unwarranted ruling, was told:
"For reasons that I do not see the
need to discuss with you, this course
is not open to auditors."
"Why?" I asked; "Why should a
course given in a class room in which
there are many seats available, given
in a university supposedly enlight
ened, given to students who are be
lieved to be in quest of higher edu
cation be denied to those whose
schedule does not permit their en
rolling in the course, but who, hav
ing a free period, are interested in
acquiring additional information on
a subject vital to all of us?"
Presumably the reason lies in the
fact that the auditors would not have
the proper receptive attitude. A

lecture on venereal disease as we
would have heard had we been per
mitted to attend is not fit for the
uninitiated; we might titter or break
forth in a horselaugh. The faculty,
in short, does not believe that four
years of advanced education have
served to make gentlemen of us,
that an avowed purpose (see Found
ing Grant) of the University has
been achieved, that a horselaugh
should be given only by a four
legged animal wtih a sleek mane and
a silky tail.
This, of course, was too frank a
reason to give to me. Rather, the
answer was, "If you want the in
formation, you can get it from any
good textbook." Yes, and that is
true for all my courses; but that is
not my purpose in paying tuition
above $100 a quarter. That fee is
intended to entail far greater privi
leges. So, at least, I have thought.
"Let the winds of freedom blow"
—and send a gentle hurricane in the
direction of Miss Doyle and her
Personal Problems course.—W.A.W.
