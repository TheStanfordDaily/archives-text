# Alpha Sigs Take Lead In Bowl Ladder
## 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
What with The Breakers pacified,
The Daily Sports Staff team very
downcast, and the Pi Phis holding
out for a handicap, there is not ex
actly any reason extant for drag
ging out the 144-point type to head
line Stanford's bowling activities.
Yes, indeed, it IS a dull week,
i But everything is going to start mov
j ing pronto â€”the official ladder is now
i being prepared, and will be an
nounced in Monday's Daily,
i On top of the ladder is the Alpha
Sig quartet, by virtue of its vic
tory yesterday over Kappa Sig, 1915
to 1754. The winners' score was the
highest yet marked up in tourna
j ment play.
