THORNTON HABIJ-UP
FOR SWIMMERS
The swimming season is coming
upon us in large splashes.
Here on the Farm, Nort Thornton
is as busy as a one-armed paper
hanger with the hives trying to paste
a team together to retain the con
ference title the Indian water forces
won last year.
This season brings forth the
strongest teams to grace the four
conference campuses in many long
years. A month ago, Nort was
beaming ... he had quite an out
fit. Then came the blow . . . the
Indians had four aces snatched from
the deck by the fickle finger of fate-
Two of those aces are back in the
pack . . . Roy Winkelmann, All-
American diver, and Don Towne,
breaststroker. Dick Clarke, star
sprinter, has a fighting chance to
compete, although it's still fairly
doubtful. Jack Vibert, school record
holder in the 100-yard free style, is
definitely out of commission.
Despite this setback, the super
optimist of Encina Pools comes back
with a smile and a team that, is go
ing to make a real fight of it for the
championship against a star-studded
U.S.C. fin flipping aggregation and
a well-balanced California team.
Even the usually weak Bruins of
U.C.LA. will be right in there pitch
ing.
RIDER, NEEDHAM
SET FOR 220-440
At present the Indian mentor has
two All-Americans to use in the
220 and 440-yard free style races.
Dave Rider and Winfield Needhaifi
can be counted on for plenty of
points this season even though such
men as Paul Wolfe and Bob Boals of
Troy and Jim Shields of Cal will be
splashing things up on the Coast
this year.
In the 50 and 100, Thornton will
still have John Brahtz to warm the
cockles of his heart. The loss of
Clarke and Vibert has hit Thorn
ton's dream of a relay team to face
the mighty Trojans' relay squad.
Roger Hatch and Paul Wolfe of
U.S.C., Steve Barber and Steve An
derson, and Devere Christenson of
U.C.L.A. form the competition for
Brahtz.
WINKELMANN LEADS
IN DIVING LINE-UP
Winkelmann should lead the div
ing in the conference this year by a
wide margin. "Apollo" is being
groomed by Ernst Brandsten for
the 1940 Olympic Games, if and
when they are held in the Land of
the Rising Sun.
In the backstroke, the Cards will
have Hal Weatherbe, Mason Let
teau, and Jack Reade to stand up
against the onslaughts of Phil Bar
ker of Cal and that man Wolfe of
Troy, who can't enter everything in
the books.
Wolfe is a world's champ in the
individual medley, which means he's
an ace on his back or right side up.
Stanford's representative in the
breaststroke will be Don Towne,
who can take anybody on the coast
at 50 yards, but fades a little over
that distance. There'll be Bill
Hatch and Lloyd Wilson to back him
up.
Hang on to your hats when the
conference meet comes around next
quarter and get out the umbrellas
. . . there's going to be plenty of
chlorine splashed around . . . it's
anybody's race. — Gene Gear.

Despite this setback, the super
optimist of Encina Pools comes back
with a smile and a team that, is go
ing to make a real fight of it for the
championship against a star-studded
U.S.C. fin flipping aggregation and
a well-balanced California team.
Even the usually weak Bruins of
U.C.LA. will be right in there pitch
ing.
RIDER, NEEDHAM
SET FOR 220-440
At present the Indian mentor has
two All-Americans to use in the
220 and 440-yard free style races.
Dave Rider and Winfield Needhaifi
can be counted on for plenty of
points this season even though such
men as Paul Wolfe and Bob Boals of
Troy and Jim Shields of Cal will be
splashing things up on the Coast
this year.
In the 50 and 100, Thornton will
still have John Brahtz to warm the
cockles of his heart. The loss of
Clarke and Vibert has hit Thorn
ton's dream of a relay team to face
the mighty Trojans' relay squad.
Roger Hatch and Paul Wolfe of
U.S.C., Steve Barber and Steve An
derson, and Devere Christenson of
U.C.L.A. form the competition for
Brahtz.
WINKELMANN LEADS
IN DIVING LINE-UP
Winkelmann should lead the div
ing in the conference this year by a
wide margin. "Apollo" is being
groomed by Ernst Brandsten for
the 1940 Olympic Games, if and
when they are held in the Land of
the Rising Sun.
In the backstroke, the Cards will
have Hal Weatherbe, Mason Let
teau, and Jack Reade to stand up
against the onslaughts of Phil Bar
ker of Cal and that man Wolfe of
Troy, who can't enter everything in
the books.
Wolfe is a world's champ in the
individual medley, which means he's
an ace on his back or right side up.
Stanford's representative in the
breaststroke will be Don Towne,
who can take anybody on the coast
at 50 yards, but fades a little over
that distance. There'll be Bill
Hatch and Lloyd Wilson to back him
up.
Hang on to your hats when the
conference meet comes around next
quarter and get out the umbrellas
. . . there's going to be plenty of
chlorine splashed around . . . it's
anybody's race. — Gene Gear.
THORNTON HABIJ-UP
FOR SWIMMERS
The swimming season is coming
upon us in large splashes.
Here on the Farm, Nort Thornton
is as busy as a one-armed paper
hanger with the hives trying to paste
a team together to retain the con
ference title the Indian water forces
won last year.
This season brings forth the
strongest teams to grace the four
conference campuses in many long
years. A month ago, Nort was
beaming ... he had quite an out
fit. Then came the blow . . . the
Indians had four aces snatched from
the deck by the fickle finger of fate-
Two of those aces are back in the
pack . . . Roy Winkelmann, All-
American diver, and Don Towne,
breaststroker. Dick Clarke, star
sprinter, has a fighting chance to
compete, although it's still fairly
doubtful. Jack Vibert, school record
holder in the 100-yard free style, is
definitely out of commission.
