## Hoopmen To Leave For U.C.L.A. Today 
### 
Not quite satisfied with his team's defensive play. Coach John Bunn
directed his varsity hasketballers through another fast scrimmage drill in
the art of stopping the other guy yesterday.
The workout was the last for the Indians before their games with
U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles tomorrow and Saturday nights, since Bunn has |

decided not to hold practice today, i
The team, in fine physical condi
tion and mentally better than a week
ago, leaves tonight on the Lark for
the first pair of games it will en
counter on the road back to the top.
Two wins will be necessary if the
Cards are to capture the southern
division title for the third year, for
it is almost certain that a defeat in
the remainder of the league race
would hand the title to either U.S.C.
or Cal.
Stoefen In Shape
Center Art Stoefen, after being in
a bad slump for two weeks, has
pulled himself out of the doldrums
enough so that Coach Bunn looks
fpr him to be the old Stoefen once
again this week-end.
He put on a lively exhibition
Monday afternoon, and then speeded
up after a dull early practice show
ing Tuesday to show he can still do
it if he wants to.
Also pleasing to Coach Bunn has
been the work of stocky Bob Burn
ett, aggressive guard who has been
dogging first-stringer H. B. Lee's
footsteps all season. His spirited
play lifted the first outfit last Satur
day against St. Mary's, and Bunn
expects even better things from the
curly headed guard as the season
wears on.
Probable Line-Up
Probable starting line-up against
Caddy Works' Bruins will be Lee
and Calderwood, guards; Stoefen,
center; and Captain Luisetti and
Phil Zonne, forwards. Facing them
for U.C.L.A. will probably be
Slaughter and Montgomery, guards;
Calkins and Humes, forwards; and
center.
Calkins, not-too-tall front line
man, has been leading the unim
pressive Bruin offense with his abil
ity to get away shots in spite of his
size. He is pressed for honors by
Hays, who replaced John Ball, last
year's team leader, in spirit if not in
ability.
All the Bruin starters are juniors,
there being only one senior on the
team, Jack Cooper, reserve forward.
