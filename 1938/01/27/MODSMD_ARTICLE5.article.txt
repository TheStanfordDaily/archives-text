# Eliot Stresses Aim Of Church
## Religion Criticized At Luncheon Club 
### 
"Churches of today have got to
get down to their real business,"
declared Dr. Frederick Eliot, famed
Boston churchman and lecturer, in
an address on "The Place of the
Church Today," befox-e Luncheon
Club yesterday.
"Much of the church business is
purely a relic of earlier days," Dr.
Eliot further stated in discussing
the religious situation of this coun
try. "The church's real job," Dr.
Eliot defined, "is making men will
ing to take the responsibility to de
cide how they are going to use the
scientific advances of this age."
To exemplify his point the noted
churchman cited the story of the
pacifist-scientist who perfected war
equipment.
"Physical science is dumping its
discoveries on the world's doorstep
and does not care what the world
does with them," Eliot went on.
"Then," he asked, "whose responsi
bility is it to see that these newly
found truths and facts are properly
used? It is everyone's," Dr. Eliot
answered himself, "and therefore,
perhaps, no one's."
Somewhere, in modern society, he
explained, there must be some
agency (or perhaps it is a quality in
human life) to see that men realize
their responsibilities. That agency,
Dr. Eliot averred, is the church. But,
as a churchman, he feels the
churches are not prepared to meet
their obligations.
'The churches need to have things
turned up side down," Dr. Eliot
concluded, "but it should come from
within and not from those on the
outside who, calm and detached,
criticize."
