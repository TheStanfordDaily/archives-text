## Memorial Hall-New Toy To Fight For 
### 
DESPITE a recent tendency upon the part of
Daily columnists to lambast the devil out
of the Department of Speech and Drama every
time a press turns over twice, there is one in
escapable fact which to me most obviously is
cause for student reproachâ€”the Department
acts not wisely but too well.
To personalize, let me first explain that I
know little about the drama. Although the
operatives report that "The Governor's Wife"
never should have been married, and that a
dozen other men's wives would have been
more interesting and appropriate, that is hear
say.
Disregarding the quality of production, an
intangible point subject to every man's indi
vidual concepts, there is a factual matter of
quantity which is ruffling feathers all along
the line.
Frequent reports have come at intervals from
the student-built, faculty-run Memorial Hall that
the equipment and theaters are too heavily
loaded with Speech and Drama Department
work to be used in student productions.
The Winter Show to be produced by the stu
dent organization, Stagers, will be run on the
Friday of Washington's Birthday week-end, be
cause that is the only time the facilities will be

"free."
The Farm will be relatively deserted while
Stanford deploys for Yosemite or home for the
holiday.
Perhaps this couldn't be helped; the show
was a last-minute idea, the date application was
late, the Department's program already planned.
More recently, after much deliberation, Stag
ers finally was granted a one-night stand on the
reading "Five Star Final" in the Little Theater.
Perhaps eventually, after the graduation of a
present generation used to self supervision, the
Department plans to scoop all dramatics under
its wing and do away with student directed
productions. With such able directors as Mr.
Thomas Wood Stevens on the staff, this may
be entirely possible.
But for the present it must concern itself with
current problems.
Admittedly, operation of the new plant is
still in the adjustment period, the kinks are still
being ironed out. But even now the Depart
ment can not believe that its policy of "first
come first served" is justifed.
For succeeding guarters there must be a
joint calendar drawn, carefully and co-opera
tively planned to give student producers and
casts what they can expect from a plant built,
and still being paid for, by themselves.
