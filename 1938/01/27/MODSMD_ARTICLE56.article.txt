# Newspaper Guild on the Stand
## 
### 
WHEN I go to hear Mr. Howard Hill of the
Northern California Newspaper Guild
speak in the Union tomorrow, I hope to take
my room-mate along. Because I once said that
I probably would join the Guild someday, he's
been bothering me with criticisms. Some of
them I haven't been able to answer.
"What about freedom of the press?" he asks
me. "How unbiased is going to be the report
ing of men belonging to an organization that
has taken sides on such controversial things
as the Spanish War, and the President's Court
plan?"
Of course I can tell him reporters aren't go
ing to be any more affected by what the Guild
thinks than by what they think the boss will
like to read as it is now. And I'm not so sure
that the boss' tastes are any better than the
Guild's. But the room-mate's father owns a
newspaper; that isn't a very strong argument
to him. Besides, I don't think that those en
dorsements were very good policy. If Mr.
Hill will oblige, I'd like a little more ammuni
tion on this point.
Then it's difficult to make clear the differ
ence between a Guild shop which requires that
new employes join the union, and the un
speakable closed shop. Perhaps Mr. Hill can
succeed where I failed in explaining this to
my room-mate.
One thing I'd like to find out for myself to
morrow is how the Guild contracts that now are

being negotiated in San Francisco are going to
affect my chances of getting a job. In making
the tenure of the older workers more secure
there have been rather rigid limits set on the
number of inexperienced workers that may be
hired. Which may mean that each paper can
hire only two college men next summer. And
that, Mr. Hill, makes my chances pretty slim.
