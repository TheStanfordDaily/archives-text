# BULL SESSION

### 
| lIDDEN in yesterday's Ex Committee story was an
item which blasted the neatest bit of financial
engineering that I have ever worked out. One brief
paragraph contained the information that Cap and
Gown had been awarded the spring quarter Reg
Dance, which means a "gift" of $150. Despite my ad
miration for Cap and Gown, I find this news ex
tremely depressing. For I had designs on the Reg
Dance myself, and I know now how Jim Fisk felt
when his castle of currency was bombed.
I had planned to incorporate as a campus organiza
tion, apply for the Dance, and use the "gift" as a re
serve to cover contributions to Stanford's various fi
nance campaigns. The scheme seemed to be one of
the most practical ever worked out. If it succeeded, I
would be able to give my share to every drive, thus
saving my self-respect which always has a bad time
of it when I turn down "worthy" causes.

And there was no reason why the plan should not
have succeeded. It had a philanthropic purpose; it
was in keeping with the best Stanford traditions. Ex
Committee itself has adopted policies which in com
parison to my scheme were pure financial mysticism.
But I neglected to start the machinery. There were
Daily elections, and accounting problems in which a
prayer book is much more help than a text. Mid
quarters harried me despite the fact that it is the
closed season. And so I woke up yesterday morning
to learn that my golden dream would never reach the
assaying otlice.

r |MIEF!E is one consolation that will help me to bear
up when the Cap and Gown girls merrily carry off
the "gift" and go out to buy caps and gowns, or do
whatever it is they are supposed to do. Shattered
though my dream is, it will be remembered as the first
attempt to do something about our system of finance
drives. Perhaps some day it may inspire a budding
Rothschild to design a plan for the relief of campaign
racked students.
Stanford always has at least one vigorous drive on
foot, and often it goes in for double features. The
endowment fund keeps popping up like a Wagnerian
leit-motif. The Convalescent Home drops around in
the spring. The Red Cross pays an annual call, and
there is always a flood somewhere which means an
impromptu flood-relief campaign. Women journalists
and or club members break out with a doughnut sale
at regular intervals. The police mail you two tickets
to a ball, and want only a paltry $4 in return.
Â» * * *
The big trouble is that all are good causes. And it
makes you feel like a worm with an inferiority com
plex whenever you turn one of them down. But banks
are not philanthropic institutions; they write very
nasty letters when you overdraw your account.
With my Reg Dance air castle dynamited, the fu
ture looks black. Unless Ex Committee has another
"gift" lying about, I will have to wow n beard ami
