# GOIN' MY WAY

I" AST Thursday in this column it was suggested that
all might not be for the best in our best of all
Speech and Drama Departments, and the reaction was,
to put it mildly, terrific. The cast of "The Governor's
Wife" was all for organizing a lynching party,
Opinions bombarded The Daily, and even the Palo
Alto Times stuck a completely gratuitous nose into the
matter to overwhelm me with truly devastating irony.
In the belief that this indicates that there is a very
definite feeling on the matter, I would like to use the
column again, this time to suggest a few of the sort of
plays I think the Department might put on in order
to justify its existence, give its actors experience, and
its audiences enjoyment.
None of these is a specific proposal; all are merely
indications of the long line along which I personally
think the Department might go. Arranged chrono
logically, because that seemed simplest, they cover the
range from high tragedy to high comedy, each one a
play of good reputation and sound worth.
1: Aristophanes' "Lysistrata," (if we must go
Greek), which describes what happens when the wo
men of Greece decide they really want peace, and go
on strike to get it.
2. "Macbeth," one of the best murder melodramas
ever penned.
3. Sheridan's ''The School for Scandal," that bold
and bawdy romp through 18th century England.
4. Rostand's "L'Aiglon," the tragic and beautiful
story of Napoleon's son, the Prince of Rome, who finds
himself forgotten by Europe when the father he has
never seen goes to St. Helena.
5. Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac," most tragi-comie
of tragi-comedies.
6. Shaw's "Saint Joan," sincere, reverent, profoundly
moving.
7. Shaw's "Androcles and the Lion," uproarious and
sometimes terrible satire on organized religion.
8. Pirandello's "Six Characters in Search of an
Author," clever, experimental, good.
9. Maxwell Anderson's "High Tor," a fantastic frolic
with the men of Hendrik Hudson's crew.
10. A program of three one-act plays—"Riders to
the Sea," perhaps, combined with "Waiting for Lefty,"
and any one of numerous one-act comedies to com
plete the bill.
* * * *
jV"ONE of these—with the possible exception of "The
School for Scandal," "Cyrano," and "L'Aiglon"—
needs very much more than clever use of lights and
backdrops to make it effective. Each offers many op
portunities for fine characterization, and each comes
from the pen of a master dramatist.
Furthermore—and this seems, to me, a rather im
portant point—they are plays which people will come
to see, not because they are curious novelties, not be
cause they are full of a dubious artistic perfection, but
because they are plays which make some lasting and
valuable contribution to audience pleasure or audi
ence thought.
I shall not feel very hurt if the Department doesn't
put on things like this; but I shall feel pretty disgusted
if it asks us to sit through any more of its pseudo
pseudo smash flops. True, "Winter's Tale" is coming,
and "Winter's Tale" is Shakespeare and a good show
to boot; and maybe all is not lost, and maybe I had
better close on that hopeful note this garrulous ex
pression of personal opinion.
In regard to "The Governor's Wife," I am sorry if
my review caused anyone to stay away; but'l see no
reason why support should be given a play whose
success in the long run—because it would lead to sim
ilar wastes of time, energy, and patience in the future
—could only have a bad effect on Stanford Drama.
