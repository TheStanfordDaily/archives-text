Dear Gordy:
You will, I am sure, be interested
to know that there is no person by
the name of C. L. Russell listed in

the University publication "Offi
cers and Students" for 1937-38.
This catalogue is all-inclusive, and
if any person by the name of C. L.
Russell is attending this University,
he is not attending as a regular
student.
Just for the record, how about
publishing this letter?
John Burd Jr.
Editor, The Californian.
