# Drive Nets $785, May Equal Set Goal
## 
### 
Although official figures announced yesterday show a total contribu
tion record of $785 at the close of the third and last day of the Y.W.C.A.
Finance Drive, the committee in charge believes that this amount will be
swelled to meet the set goal of $1000 when collection envelopes not yet

turned in are received. {
Jackie Brown, toastmistress for
the concluding dinner, held last
night for the 250 "Y" workers on
the Drive, announced that Team
One, headed by Colonel Mary Hayes,
with a canvass record of $92 led in
the competition between the 10 i
teams. Runner-up for the honor
with $83 was Team Nine, headed by
Colonel Wilma Baker. Each team
was aiming for $100 as its quota.
May Reach Goal
"It is feasible to believe," said
Virginia Clausen, treasurer of the
"Y," "that when the remaining
workers who have not done so turn I
in the results of their three-day
campaigning, the collection figure !
may go much farther towards reach- i
ing the goal of $1000."
Speaking last night at the "Y" i
dinner, Miss Anastasia Doyle, di
rector of Women's Residences, con- j
gratulated the workers on their en
thusiasm and effort in making this |
year's Drive a success.
"Your work does not stop tonight,
however," she declared. "It is your
continuing task to- see that the pro
gram of the Y.W.C.A. remains for
ward-looking and friendly in spirit,
cutting across living groups and age
groups in accordance with the
Christian ideals of the organization."
Board Introduced
Miss Anita Hodgkin, chairman of
the Y.W.C.A. Advisory Board, in
troduced the members of the Board
who were present and spoke of the !
value that working together on a j
Drive of this sort has for the build- 1
ing up of lasting friendships.
Anne Martineau as finance chair- !
man of the "Y" thanked all women
who have given their time and sup
port to the success of the Drive.
