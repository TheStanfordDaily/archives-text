### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP). â€”
Thi' State Department revealed to
day Ambassador Grew in Tokio,
protesting continued looting of
American property in China by Jap
anese troops, had questioned Japa
nese assurances upon which the set
tlement of the Panay incident was
based.
Mr. Grew, citing numerous in
stances of Japanese depredations
against American property at Nan
king, Hangchow and other places in
China, said:
"My government finds it impos
sible to reconcile the flagrant disre
gard nf American rights shown by
Japanese troops as above described
with the assurances contained in
your excellency's note of Dec. 24,
1937."
One of the concluding paragraphs
of the Japanese note of Dec. 24 sc lid
111 at "rigid orders have been issued
to the military, naval, and foreign
office authorities to pay . . . greater
attention than hitherto to observ
ance of the instructions that have
been repeatedly given against in
fringement of, or unwarranted inter
ference with the rights and interests
of the United States and other third
powers."
Mr. Grew's protest quoted this
paragraph to remind the Japanese
government of its promises.
