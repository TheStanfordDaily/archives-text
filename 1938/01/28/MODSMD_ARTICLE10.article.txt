# Shepard To Air Talk On Health
## Director Plans Monday Radio Hour On KGO 
### 
Dr. Charles E. Shepard, director
of the men students' health service
at Stanford University, will discuss
programs for medical care for col
lege students Monday night, over
KGO at 9:15 p.m.
Because a doctor can't tell a sick
college student to go to bed in his
dormitory or fraternity house, where
he cannot get proper attention and
the noise itself is hard enough for a
healthy young man to live through,
health programs in (500 American
colleges and universities are under
investigation by hygicnists.
"Where student health plans are
operating successfully, as at Stan
ford. students get better care when
they are sick than other members of
the community, and at less cost," Dr.
Shepard says.
Other speakers scheduled on the
Stanford Radio Program over KGO
are Professor Rex F. Harlow, Feb.
7; Professor Charles A. Dobhel,
Feb. 14; Mr. Gault Lynn, Feb. 21;
and Professor Guerard, Feb. 28.
