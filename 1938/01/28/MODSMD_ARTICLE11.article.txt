Mr. Hill said that the newspaper
guild "has had the most amazing
growth in (he history of American
trade unionism."
The Guild, founded in 1933, "was
committed to industrial unionism
Irom the first," he explained. Or
ganized as ;m independent union,
Mr. Hill slated that it affiliated with
the American Federation of Labor

are gradually losing their fear of the
Guild's purposes and tb.it "issues
such as freedom of the press are no
longer being raised as objections"
In a discussion and citation per
iod, Mr. Hill said that the Guild
welcomes the entrance of qualified
college graduates into journalism,
and that in no sense is it endeavor
ing to limit the number of men en
tering the field.

ment, Mr. Hill concluded that the
Guild represent "a final break with
the old romantic tradition about un
derpaid newspaper men."
