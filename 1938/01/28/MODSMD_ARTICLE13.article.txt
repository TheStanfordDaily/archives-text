# Buck-Of-Month Drive Gets Aid Of Hall, Row
## 
### 
Seventeen Tiny - Buck-of-the-
Month Club memberships were
signed for by campus living groups
in the Axe Society's emergency
campaign, it was reported last night.
This constitutes approximately
one-third of the ultimate goal, and
came largely from emergency house
meetings yesterday. The full quota
of $400, to come from Sl2 member
ships, is expected by Society mem
bers after regular house-meetings
Monday.
Sigma Nu led the race yesterday
with three year's memberships, two
over the amount asked from each
group. Fourteen other organizations
gave one each.
The Axe Society's drive, totally
unsolicited by the Buck Club, and
promised by Society members as not
to become a routine affair, has been
conceived to maintain four unnamed
athletes this quarter who were un
able to be cared for on the regular
alumni scholarship rolls.
The money must be promised the
Accounting Office by Monday, so
Axe Society campaigners are urging
all organization managers who in
tend to join in the donations to give
notice of such intention as soon as
possible by telephoning 5844.
