# Indian Hoopmen to Face Bruin Challenge In Test For Conference Laurels
## Crimson Crushers Regain Strength For U.C.L.A. 
### WALT PETERSON 
Twelve men tried and true—all
Indians—are going to look into the
case of U.C.L.A. vs. Stanford to
night and tomorrow night in Lo:i
Angeles, and on their verdict lies
the life of the party of the second
part as a southerr division basket
ball contender.
Twelve players were herded
aboard the Lark last night by At
torney John Bunn, L. A.-bound, and
those 12 maple artists hold the fate
of the Crimson Crusher, lately re
sembling a Pink Powder Puff but
apparently now back in form.
Whether the Foreman Hank Lui
setti-led panel can find it in their
hearts and their floorwork to give
the defendants another chance at

such us California and U.S.C., at
the expense of the plaintiff Bruins,
is a moot question.
Up To Indians
The jury, in other words, holds
its fate in its own hands, U.C.L.A.
contends for conviction, but whether
their attorney, Caddy Works, has
prepared a convincing-enough brief
of the case is undecided.
Climbing aboard the southbound
flier last night were, besides Fore
man Luisetti, Jurors Art Stoefen,
Tom Siebert, Nellie Heath, Phil
Zonne, Leon Lafaille, Derrol Hud
dleson, Dale Huff. Jack Caldqrwood,
Horace Lee, Bob Burnelt, and Bob
Zonne.
Chief complaining witnesses for
the plaintift have been listed as Paul
Slaughter and Jack Montgomery,
guards; Bob Calkins and Harley
Humes, forwards, and Crossan Hays,
center. It is expected that Luiselti,

Stoefen, Phil Zonne, Leo and Cald
erwood will dominate the action of
the jury.
Mentally Better
Apart from the legal aspect;of the
situation, the boys were in fine
mental fettle for the first time since
the second U.S.C. game two weeks
ago. A 12-minute battle Wednesday
afternoon between the first and sec
ond teams found the first winning
23-12. and also a flock of bets in
volving milkshakes and cokes.
Coach Bunn didn't want his boys
to go to it, but they insisted so he
let them have their fling, and now
it's definitely decided the first string
is better than the second.
Students going south for the
games in Pan-Pacific Auditorium
will be able to gain admittance on
presentation of student body cards,
the B.A.C. announced yesterday.

Frederick Steiwer. of Oregon today
submitted his resignation from the
United States Senate.
Twelve men tried and true—all
Indians—are going to look into the
case of U.C.L.A. vs. Stanford to
night and tomorrow night in Lo:i
Angeles, and on their verdict lies
the life of the party of the second
part as a southerr division basket
ball contender.
Twelve players were herded
aboard the Lark last night by At
torney John Bunn, L. A.-bound, and
those 12 maple artists hold the fate
of the Crimson Crusher, lately re
sembling a Pink Powder Puff but
apparently now back in form.
Whether the Foreman Hank Lui
setti-led panel can find it in their
hearts and their floorwork to give
the defendants another chance at

such us California and U.S.C., at
the expense of the plaintiff Bruins,
is a moot question.
Up To Indians
The jury, in other words, holds
its fate in its own hands, U.C.L.A.
contends for conviction, but whether
their attorney, Caddy Works, has
prepared a convincing-enough brief
of the case is undecided.
Climbing aboard the southbound
flier last night were, besides Fore
man Luisetti, Jurors Art Stoefen,
Tom Siebert, Nellie Heath, Phil
Zonne, Leon Lafaille, Derrol Hud
dleson, Dale Huff. Jack Caldqrwood,
Horace Lee, Bob Burnelt, and Bob
Zonne.
Chief complaining witnesses for
the plaintift have been listed as Paul
Slaughter and Jack Montgomery,
guards; Bob Calkins and Harley
Humes, forwards, and Crossan Hays,
center. It is expected that Luiselti,

Stoefen, Phil Zonne, Leo and Cald
erwood will dominate the action of
the jury.
Mentally Better
Apart from the legal aspect;of the
situation, the boys were in fine
mental fettle for the first time since
the second U.S.C. game two weeks
ago. A 12-minute battle Wednesday
afternoon between the first and sec
ond teams found the first winning
23-12. and also a flock of bets in
volving milkshakes and cokes.
Coach Bunn didn't want his boys
to go to it, but they insisted so he
let them have their fling, and now
it's definitely decided the first string
is better than the second.
Students going south for the
games in Pan-Pacific Auditorium
will be able to gain admittance on
presentation of student body cards,
the B.A.C. announced yesterday.
