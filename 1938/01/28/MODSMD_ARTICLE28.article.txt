# Green Refuses New Move For Labor Peace
## Dewey To Confer With A. F. of L. Chief On Conciliation Measures 
### 
MIAMI. Fla.. Jan. 27 (UP).—Pres
ident William Green of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor said tonight
a suggest ion that the Committee for
Industrial Organization's latest peace
proposal be submitted to a vote of
all A. F. of L. members was both
"impracticable and foolish."
The newest idea put forth in the
long-distance bickering between
president Green of the A.F. of L.
and John L. Lewis, C.1.0. chairman,
was offered on the floor of Lewis'
United Mine Workers' convention,
1200 miles away in Washington.
John B. Easton, president of the
West Virginia State Industrial Coun
cil, asked that a proffer by Lewis to
take his entire C.1.0. back into the
Federation Feb. I—or to accept the
entire A.F. of L. into his Committee
—be subjected to referendum ap
proval of Federation members.
"That idea is both impracticable ■
and foolish," Green . said crisply,
when informed of Easton's request.
"Those fellows are just trying to de
ceive the workers and make them
believe they have a peace plan."
As an alternative, he extended an
invitation for the entire A. F. of L.
to join the C.1.0. '
"This is not a new proposal,"
Green answered. "It is just the same
old thing. It is identical with the
impossible peace plan proposed by
Lewis toward the end of the peace
conference (last month) after he had
vetoed our proposal which had been
accepted and approved by the C.1.0.
Committee.
"We rejected this plan then be
cause it would only serve to move
the scene of war and dissension
from outside the A.F. of L. into its
very midst. The same objections
prevail now."
Meantime, prospects of an armis
tice in organized labor's civil war
received a severe buffeting at to
day's meeting of the A.F. of L. Ex
ecutive Council.
A flurry was caused early in the
day when Charles P. Howard, pres
ident of the International Typo
graphical Union and, at the same
time, secretary of the C. I. 0., said
he would suggest a referendum by
his union on the question of quit
ting the Federation for the C.1.0.

"This is not a new proposal,"
Green answered. "It is just the same
old thing. It is identical with the
impossible peace plan proposed by
Lewis toward the end of the peace
conference (last month) after he had
vetoed our proposal which had been
accepted and approved by the C.1.0.
Committee.

cause it would only serve to move
the scene of war and dissension

prevail now."

MIAMI. Fla.. Jan. 27 (UP).—Pres
ident William Green of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor said tonight
a suggest ion that the Committee for
Industrial Organization's latest peace
proposal be submitted to a vote of
all A. F. of L. members was both
"impracticable and foolish."
The newest idea put forth in the
long-distance bickering between
president Green of the A.F. of L.
and John L. Lewis, C.1.0. chairman,
was offered on the floor of Lewis'
United Mine Workers' convention,
1200 miles away in Washington.
John B. Easton, president of the
West Virginia State Industrial Coun
cil, asked that a proffer by Lewis to
take his entire C.1.0. back into the
Federation Feb. I—or to accept the
entire A.F. of L. into his Committee
—be subjected to referendum ap
proval of Federation members.
"That idea is both impracticable ■
and foolish," Green . said crisply,
when informed of Easton's request.
"Those fellows are just trying to de
ceive the workers and make them
believe they have a peace plan."
As an alternative, he extended an
invitation for the entire A. F. of L.
to join the C.1.0. '
