## 
### 
GENEVA. Jan. 27 (UP).â€”Dr. V. K.
Wellington Koo of China ended a
League of Nations "love feast" to
night when he turned upon the Brit
ish and French delegates and as
sailed them for "uttering empty
phrases while the world hovers on
the brink of an abyss."
The Chinese delegate's startling
attack came a few minutes after
eloquent speeches by British For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden and
French Foreign Minister Yvon Del
bos who asserted that, despite its
failures, the League remains "hu
manity's best hope of avoiding an
other catastrophe."
