It's all over including the shouting.
It's been a swell volume for me
and I hope we've put out a §ports
page that hasn't beey scooped every
day by some Frisco paper. I hope
we've given the Farih a fairly ac
curate account of Stanford sports,
and I hope we've given the fellows
and coaches some semblance of a
fair break.
This is my passing, and I'd like
here and now to publish my last
will and testament, composed of
all my worldly goods—gratitude,
thanks, and good luck.
To WALT PETERSON, the in
coming sports editor, I wish all the
good luck in the world and all the
worries, hard work, and real pleas ?
ure that goes with this job. Pete's
been in this same harness before,
and his coming volume should be
the best in the history of Dippy
sports pages.
To the fellows on my sports staff,
I leave my undying thanks and sin
cere gratitude for the swell co-op
eration you all gave me (that's an
expensive gift to leave anybody . . .
the boys are sure to love me for it).
At any rate my hat's off to PETE,
PRETZEL, GERRY, JERRY, ARCH
IE, DOUG, 808, GLEEK, and
SHALLY.
My sincere gratitude to DON
LIEBENDORFER and AL MASTERS
for all the swell help they've given
me during this volume. Any suc
cess at all during these months for
the sports page can be attributed in
part to Don. I hope all future sports
eds have him around. He's a grand
fellow and in inyaluable friend to
help you over the rough spots.
To my "enemies" of the press . . .
ART COHN of the Oakland Tribune,
DICK TONER of the Daily Cal, and
808 RAY of the L. A. Times, goes
some more thanks. Yes, if it wasn't
for these three gentlemen I would
have floundered many times along
the way. Their literary efforts fur
nished material for more than one
Slants. Without them there un
doubtedly would have been more
than one blank space in the column
where Slants belongs.
I call these men my "enemies"
of the press ... in real life we'd
probably be good friends . . . I've
met Toner, and he's a swell fel
low, except of course, that lie goes
to Cal.
To all the Card coaches I wish the
best of !uck. Here's hoping HARRY
MALONEY, JOHN BUNN, DINK
TEMPLETON, NORT THORNTON,
and CLAYTON FRYE turn out
teams during this next volume that
will bring championships to the Farm
in rugby, baseball, track, swimming,
and boxing.
Well, there's my swan song . . .
starting Monday you can read, for
a change, a good column of sports
as turned out by my tow-headed
colleague, Walt Peterson.
