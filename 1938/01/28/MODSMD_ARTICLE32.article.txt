# Crippled Frosh Cagers To Meet Galileo Tonight
## Santa Rosa To Play Here Saturday; Masters Out 
### JERRY MAYER 
struck suddenly and disasterous
ly by illnesses to star players, Stan
lord's frosh hoop team takes the
Pavilion floor against Galileo High
School tonight at 7:LiO o'clock. There
will be no admission charge.
Don Williams, star forward, and
Bill Masters, capable substitute
guard, are the men whose loss hits
Coach Wytze Goiter's team right
between the eyes. Williams is suf
fering from a bad cold and although
he will probably play, he is far from
in shape. Masters is in the hospital
with a case of the flu and there is
no chance that he will get in this
week-end's games.
If Williams doesn't perform up to
snuff Gorter will have to dig into
his grab bag for a capable replace
ment. Bill Schroeder and Bob Dit
levsen have strangle holds on the
second-string forward spots but
both are handicapped by lack of
experience under fire. Either Bill
Rumbley or Dick Taylor, giant cen
ters, are also possibilities.
Galileo Strong
Galileo's Lions, coached by Tom
De Nyke, boast a tough team and
should be even stiffer competition if
Williams doesn't hit his form.
However, tomorrow night's fray
with Santa Rosa High School is ihe
game that the frosh are pointing for.
Mentored by Orv Fortier, the Pan
thers have lost but one game in three
years and are hailed as the outstand
ing prep team in Bay Region circles.
The Panthers have defeated Lowell
High, who defeated the Papooses two
weeks ago, and they also hold a vic
tory over the strong Santa Rosa
Junior College quintet. Tomorrow's
game will also be in the Pavilion at
7:30 o'clock.
