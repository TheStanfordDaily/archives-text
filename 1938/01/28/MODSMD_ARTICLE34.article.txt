# Alpha Sigs Top Bowling Ladder
## Engineers Make Strong Bid For Top Place 
### PHILBERT BOWL 
If they don't get buck fever when
it comes to actual competition, the
Engineers should hit the top of the
bowling ladder in a very short time.
Looking into my little Blue Book |
of high scores, 1 notice that these J
keglers who claim to be Engineers
are doing all right by themselves,
hitting 200'.s as though they actually j
meant it. Maybe they do.
But right now the Alpha Sigs are
sitting on top of the Stanford bowl
ing world. The complete and only r
official ladder will be released Mon- i
day, with names and numbers of
all the players, without which you ;
can't enjoy the game.
Tomorrow the Engineers will aim .
at their first competitive pins when
they meet the Breakers four. Teams !
which have signed up so far—this j
is not the ladder; you'll have to wait
till Monday for that—include the
following:
Alpha Sig, Breakers, Engineers, j
Kappa Sig, Daily Sports Staff, Chap
pieslappiehappie, Fiji, Chi Psi, Sig
ma Chi, and Theta Delt. Any other
keglers v/ho wish to enter a team
should get in touch with Gene Gear
at 22166 or 87(57, or Harry Press at
2216(5 or 3121.
