### 
Stanford men swimming in the
Pacific Association's 50-yard swim
ming championships tonight at the
Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco
will not be representing the Farm.
All seven of the Indian entrants
are classed as '"unattached contest
ants.'' However Coach Nort Thorn
ton believes that the meet will pro
vide a fair omen of what other Bay
region swimmers can do.
Swimming for Stanford in the
junior division will be Roy Vitousek
and Dick Clarke.
