## Varsity Nine To Play Third Game Tomorrow 
### 
In keeping with the axiom that
"practice makes perfect" Stanford's
varsity baseball team v/ill play its
third game in a week tomorrow af-
I ternoon when it faces the Kenealy
| Seals at 3 o'clock on the sunken dia
-1 mond.
The Indians climaxed three weeks
I of practice last Saturday by defeat
| ing the Athens Club of Oakland,
j 5-2, in the first of a series of games
| with local Winter League nines. In
S their second contest Wednesday the
! Indians committed six errors in the
| field to offset a six-hit pitching per-
I forrnance by Furman, Hamilton and
i Lazzarone and go down before the
' Gaddini Ai-Stars, 5-2.
Believed at the beginning of the
i year to be Stanford's weakest spot,
i the pitching staff in the first two
| games has turned in good perform -
j ances for this early in the season.
I "Spike" Furman has allowed one
j run, which was unearned, and a
I single hit in the six innings that he

has toiled on the mound, indicating
that he is ready for a winning season
if his present form continues.
Glenn Hamilton in six innings has
been touched for three runs and
three hits by the opposition and has
collected three hits in five times at
bat to lead the team in hitting thus
far.
