## This Is Where I Came In 
### 
Dear lap:
Four months ago as a rather self-con
scious newcomer to this business of playing
witfi a college daily, I sat here behind the little
green table and tantalized the Underwood
through an incoherent statement of proposed
editorial policy.
I wasn't sure then just what I wanted to say
except one point which had been driven home
earlier as I stood on the sidelines and watched
Daily editors puff, fume, and rant over things
which the campus considered trivial. The one
ambition, a negative one at that, came through
this way:
"The Daily will not take itself too seriously.
It will not work itself into a fever over the dif
ference it will make ten years from now—it
will remember that it won't make any."
Now that the future tense can be stricken
from that early struggle with verbosity, the
quesion comes, did The Daily do it? Did it
keep out of the rut? Did it always bear in
mind how ideas which were cooked up in fiery
evening debate would sound in the awful
coolness of tomorrow morning's coffee?
I'm not sure. Sometimes in moments of
egotistical meditation, I give The Daily credit
for achieving what it sought to acquire—bal
ance and good judgment without loss of vital
ity. At other times, I'm sure that the policy
was vaccillating, fence-straddling, and limp.
Whether it hit the mid-line between those two,
I'll never know. Naturally, I hope it did.
At any rate, I'm still convinced that the
policy, whether adhered to or not, was right.
If you can keep it sensible yet newsy, Lap, and
not worry about gaining distinction as a "fiery
young college editor," Stanford as both Uni
versity and collection of individuals will re
ceive most from the publication of which
you've just become editor.
But before I dilute my beer, I'll get down to
earth.

When you defeated Johnny Rice for the edi
torship last Tuesday, you won out over one of
the most energetic, most likeable chaps The
Daily has ever known; in and out of the dark
room 200 times a day and an idea for some
body every time.
Everyone likes Rice. And that you swung
the deal over that man, Lloyd, is recommen
dation in itself.
You've got a damn fine staff, and ought to
go great guns. I could name them all as
Eisenbach did when he called you the "quiet
guy off the Sacramento Union" but they'll be
talking for themselves soon.
it it ir it
Which brings us back to the gang I've
worked with to make the last four months the
damnedest, most enjoyable experience I've
known.
Zan Hammond and Art Stokes, the insep
arable managing editor and assistant manag
ing editor team, printed all the news that was
JiLand some art that wasn't.
To Hammond goes the distinction of being
the first woman managing editor to handle the
job better than most men could—and she get's
my leather medal anytime.
""""Women's Editor Mags Loud smiled more than
one tryoutee onto the staff, and Bill Millis did
everything there was to do—but just a little
better.
It's a swell outfit. Only wish there were room
to bouquet each one—they've got it coming!
But it's time to be along, so I'm dragging in
a bit of sentimentality the old sea captains used
when they pulled down canvas, dropped the
hook, and made the last entry in a log filled
with storms and calms and good sailing.
It was always two words:
"So Ends."

Dear lap:
Four months ago as a rather self-con
scious newcomer to this business of playing
witfi a college daily, I sat here behind the little
green table and tantalized the Underwood
through an incoherent statement of proposed
editorial policy.
I wasn't sure then just what I wanted to say
except one point which had been driven home
earlier as I stood on the sidelines and watched
Daily editors puff, fume, and rant over things
which the campus considered trivial. The one
ambition, a negative one at that, came through
this way:
"The Daily will not take itself too seriously.
It will not work itself into a fever over the dif
ference it will make ten years from now—it
will remember that it won't make any."
Now that the future tense can be stricken
from that early struggle with verbosity, the
quesion comes, did The Daily do it? Did it
keep out of the rut? Did it always bear in
mind how ideas which were cooked up in fiery
evening debate would sound in the awful
coolness of tomorrow morning's coffee?
I'm not sure. Sometimes in moments of
egotistical meditation, I give The Daily credit
for achieving what it sought to acquire—bal
ance and good judgment without loss of vital
ity. At other times, I'm sure that the policy
was vaccillating, fence-straddling, and limp.
Whether it hit the mid-line between those two,
I'll never know. Naturally, I hope it did.
At any rate, I'm still convinced that the
policy, whether adhered to or not, was right.
If you can keep it sensible yet newsy, Lap, and
not worry about gaining distinction as a "fiery
young college editor," Stanford as both Uni
versity and collection of individuals will re
ceive most from the publication of which
you've just become editor.
But before I dilute my beer, I'll get down to
earth.

When you defeated Johnny Rice for the edi
torship last Tuesday, you won out over one of
the most energetic, most likeable chaps The
Daily has ever known; in and out of the dark
room 200 times a day and an idea for some
body every time.
Everyone likes Rice. And that you swung
the deal over that man, Lloyd, is recommen
dation in itself.
You've got a damn fine staff, and ought to
go great guns. I could name them all as
Eisenbach did when he called you the "quiet
guy off the Sacramento Union" but they'll be
talking for themselves soon.

Which brings us back to the gang I've
worked with to make the last four months the
damnedest, most enjoyable experience I've
known.
