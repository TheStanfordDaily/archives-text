# BULL SESSION
## SOFT MUSIC—SNIFFLES FROM THE BALCONY 
### 
WITH this issue, Volume 92 of The Daily gently pulls
a cardboard over its head and is gathered to the
arms of the editor. Monday morning Volume 93 will
pick up the torch and strive to hold it high without
burning its fingers. But today is one when sentiment
strolls unchallenged through the Shack. It is a day of
muffled sobs, quivers about the upper lip, and shivers
about the lower vertebrae. At the top of this column,
Our Editor is gracefully bowing. To the right the old
mast head-' displays the staff of 92 for the last time.
And in this obscure corner of the stage I am left alone
for one last moment with Bull Session.
I am templed to do a very juicy job of splattering
sentimentality all over the place. I hate to leave the
dear girl. But the boys in the back shop wouldn't like
it. They are sturdy, well-adjusted, men who have
held the hands of departing Dailies for more years than
we like to have them raise a stink about. They assure
me that if any of the type metal drips tears, they will
be violently sick.

The boys up in the Chappie office wouldn't like
sentimentality either. They are strong, powerful cal
umnists who can dangle a participle with one hand.
Of course, they haven't the courage to come down
stairs to throw their water bags, but they could be very
nasty about any tender parting scene.
And so I shall follow the policy which has ruled me
this volume; I shall straddle the fence.

4 FTER all, it's my own fault. I could have kept Bull
by my side and wandered hand in hand with her
through the journalistic meadows of next volume. But
the flashy type further up on the page lures me, and so
I steel my soul and depart.
It is useless to say that I've tried to do my best for
Bull. She has been a rather demanding sweetheart, but
I've pounded the Underwoods and thumbed the dic
tionary for her until the night ed started saying nasty
things about the time columns are due. But even so,
I'm afraid that in some ways I didn't bring her up
just right. She has a bad habit of compromising, a
trait that will hurt any girl's reputation. And she's
quite a tomboy; she always straddles fqncafi.

I tried to teach her good manners, and keep her
language clean, although I had a lot of trouble about
that when she reached adolescence. And I did my best
to keep her from associating with the nasty little col
umns from the Chappie office. But I did mix her
metaphors, and I couldn't teach her not to go around
without her modifiers tied down.
But now comes the time of parting; and Bull is
making eyes at Allen Drury, who is planning to move
over from the Goin' My Way column. God bless you
my child. I know you will be very happy with him.

ska, the indescribably lovely Irena Baronova. Music
will be supplied by the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, and one work on each program will be con
ducted by Pierre Monteux, probably the most famed
director of ballet music.
Tonight will bring the airy grace and conventional
dancing figures of Chopin's "Les Slyphides"—misty
white tulle against a Corot landscape. The sensational
"Union Pacific" of Massine portrays the completion of
the trans-continental railroad—Chinese laborers from
the West and Irishmen from the East try to find out
what color garters the Lady-Gay is wearing as Senator
Stanford drives in the golden spike. "Choreartium" is
Massine's interpretation in dance form of Brahms'
Fourth Symphony.
The charming "Hundred Kisses" opens the Satur
day matinee. "Le Coq d'Or" of Rimsky-Korsakoff will
thrill you with the barbaric brilliance of an old legend
told to the tune of some of the world's finest ballet
music. Colorful "Gypsy Dances" complete the program.
Tomorrow night brings two new creations of David
Lichine never before seen on the Coast, "The Gods Go
A-Begging," music by Handel, and "Francesca da
Rimini," music bj Tschaikowsky. The toys come to
life in a new and different way in Rossini's "Boutique
Fantastique."
Repeats of "Hundred Kisses," "Coq d'Or," and
"Union Pacific" are scheduled for Sunday afternoon.
"Children's Games" is the starter for the final per
formance, followed by a modem interpretation 'The
Fantastic Symphony" of Berlioz. "Le Beau Danube"
is graceful and overflowing with continental charm.
Debussy's famed "Afternoon of a Faun" with chore
ography by Vaslav Nijinsky closes the engagement of
this superb company. The muscles of David Lichine
will ripple to impressionistic music and the lure of
four milk-and-water maidens (this shocked our par
ents at its premiere).
And when you're left with only a ticket stub
clutched in your fist, you'll have more than a memory
of graceful bodies and pointing toes. You will have
recaptured a lost era with the Ballet Russe.
—Livingston.
