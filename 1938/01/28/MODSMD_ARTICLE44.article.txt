## 'INEFFICIENCY PLUS' 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Inefficiency plus should be the
motto of the periodical room of our
esteemed library. Why doesn't the
University install some of those
highly lauded principles of business
efficiency, learned so effectively in
the Graduate School of Business,
into the above mentioned section of
the Library?
And to what particular gripe am I
referring? There is no co-ordinated
index filing system for magazines
and periodicals. One must ask the
librarians either of the presence or
of the whereabouts of any particular
magazine. This contributes to much
waste of time to both librarian and
student.
Perhaps the Ex Committee can
divert some of the profit-fund of the
Cellar to a better equipped and more
business like library. Or would
such an act endanger the already
poor quality of "a cup of java?"
Students, you can't win, but please
forgive those who direct the policies
of our Alma Mater, for they know
not what they do.â€”John A. Wright.
