# SEQUOIA'S BEDS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We would like to take this oppor
tunity to extend to the Administra
tive Officers of Stanford University
an invitation to an exchange sleep
with Sequoia Hall at any date which
can be mutually agreed upon.
We feel that the Administrative
Officers of this University should
not be denied the privilege of sleep
ing in a Sequoia bed. We guai'antee
that one night will not be fatal.
However exceptions must be made
in the case of those not in good
health for whom this guarantee may
not hold.
Sincerely yours,
Sequoia Committee of Hospitality,
by Michael Macomber.
