# UNION ADVENTURE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Cokie Joe and Cokie Flo recounted
their adventures with a Cellar
hasher in Wednesday's issue of the
Dinpie, Campus Opinion coluino.
I'm the much-maligned hasher who,
they claimed, dished up the "extra
helping" of two cokes when the
wandering students, "heads befud
dled from two solid hours of study
in the libe (honest!") ordered only
one. In all fairness, let me submit
the actual truth in this garbled af
fair.
After the two wanderers had been
supplied with glasses of water, Cokie
Flo ordered "Plain coke."
Cokie Joe abruptly added "Two"
—not, as the writers later claimed,
"Make it two."
I turned questioningly toward
Cokie Joe and asked, "Do you really
want two?" The answer was in the
affirmative. Like all good Cellar

hashers, I see that the customer
gets what he wants—eventually.
Cokie Joe got his two cokes, and a
check for both of them, too. With
out a murmur he accepted the cokes
and paid the checks. He didn't leave
a tip.
I suspect both Cokie Joe and Cokie
Flo, though I know neither of them,
of being only Dippie scouts in search
of a way to solve the Union profit
deal. They can't win that way.
Still
"Enthusiastic Hasher."
