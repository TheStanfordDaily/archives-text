### FRANCES SLATER 
Slugs of type clinking into trays—click of a linotype machine—foreman
in a tan apron swearing over hand-set heads—thin sheets of smudged
impaled on hooks. And another Stanford Daily goes to press.
An old denizen of this back-shop behind the shack where copy is
rushed for the actual business of printing, is Charlie Wegncr. Charlie has

j been in the newspaper game a long
i time.
"I have been a printer for pretty
near 42 years," he reminisces, slid
ing a thick black pencil behind his
ear, "and during that time I have
seen plenty of changes.
When I got my first job as a kid of
I 15, we set up a paper by hand. It
was a big jump when we got some
machines that took three men to
(work. Now we're efficient as heck,
i These linotypes we have now use
only one type-setter and we can get
a paper out in no time.
On duty from 4 to 12 o'clock daily,
j Charlie speaks curtly, smiles seldom.
! But at the mention of Stanford stu
dents with whom he has- worked...far
15 years, Charlie's blue eyes soften
behind his horn-rimmed spectacles.
■ "On the whole," he reflects, "I'd
I say the kids who ran The Daily this
j volume are a pretty efficient lot

j dcfil with."
j "Some staffs," he observes with
j contempt, "don't know a darned

j business of getting out a paper. I've
veiled plenty in my time. But this
