# Axe Society Drive Nets $276 Total
## Goal Of Campaign To Raise Funds For Four Scholaships 
### 
With its goal as tuition scholar
ships for four athletes, the Axe So
ciety's campaign to supply the nec
essary funds to the "Tiny-Buck-of
the-Month Club" has brought in a
total of $276, Andy Stojkovich, sec
retary of the society, reported last
night.
Funds arc being raised by solici
tation of campus living groups. The
Buck-of-the-Month Club, an alumni
organization, provides for from 20
to 25 scholarships for needy athletes
each quarter. Its active membership,
850 at present, is drawn chiefly from
alumni, although a small number of
students are enrolled on its mem
bership list.
Coaches Participate
Candidates for the scholarships
are recommended by Coaches John
Bunn, Dink Templeton, Tiny Thorn
hill, and Harry Wolter, who draw up
a list with names' arranged in pref
erential order. After determining
by interview that there is a definite
financial need present, the scholar
ships are awarded by a committee
of three, headed by James Howell.
Axe Society's aid was undertaken
when, due to a shortage of funds,
nine athletes found themselves with
out prospect of aid from the Buck
of-the-Month Club. Five scholar
ships were made up by contributions
from other scholarship athletes and
from emergency sources.
Today Day
The society then undertook,
through the living groups, to pro
vide for the four other athletes. To
day is the final day for contributions
to be made.
Additions to the list of living
groups who have definitely signed
for memberships over the week-end
include Alpha Delta Phi, Sequoia,
the Union, Delta Tau Delta, Delta
Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Mariposa,
Alpha Phi, Encina 11, and Madrono.
