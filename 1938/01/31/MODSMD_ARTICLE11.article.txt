# Cal, Stanford Will Parade To Jamboree
## Rivals Will Celebrate After Game Friday; Randall To Entertain 
### 
A torch-lighted parade, with stu
dents singing victory songs, will
! march next Friday night from the
j Pavilion to the Women's Gym, for
I the Cal-Stanford jamboree, follow
ing the basketball game.
Leading the parade will be the
Kappa Alpha's madman, Ben Mc
| Guire, who spends his time in class
, rooms quoting excerpts from "Lost
Horizon."
"We won't break Stanford tradi
tion." said Dave Ryus, junior class
president, discussing the jamboree.
"We'll go to the game; get our dates
after the game, and then go to the
jamboree."
'Scat' Till 1 To Perform
From Cal will come Cedric "Scat"
Tihl, Mask and Daggers, to aid Larry
Randall and McGuire in the enter
tainment. Tihl, through his antics,
has acquired a reputation for ad
libbing that may be necessary when
he faces the Stanford students.
The Zook twins calmly refuse to
disclose the title of their number,
claiming that it didn't make any
difference anyway. Numbers on the
program will include Randall's spe
cialty, and songs by Shirley Jones.
Other numbers are being arranged
by Jack Laney, and Betty Davis,
jamboree chairmen.
Promote Publicity
The Cal-Stanford jamboree, which
will be an all-University affair, is
intended to promote publicity for
the main event, the Junior Prom of
Feb. 11. The junior executive com
mittee felt that a jamboree would
prove more popular with the stu
| dents, and would provide an oppor-
I tunity for the students to have
something to do after the game.
The necessary arrangements for
the get-together with the Cal stu
dents have been made by George
Chalmers, with the aid of Jack
Trefts, Dp->'if To;'nso^ ( Srnford
Butts, Eleanor Hatch, and Edwina
Butts.
