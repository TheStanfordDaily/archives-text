# Tito Hunts 'God-mothers' on Farm Instead of Fighting With Franco
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
It was Seville, a key city in the
south of Rightist Spain, a year ago
iast week.
Outside the Army Air Corps head
quarters stood four or five young
Spaniards, smoking and talking in
the clear cold air. They were wait
ing to see what happened to their
friend Tito.
Behind a big desk inside sat a re
cruiting officer. A picture of Gen
| eral Franco hung on the wall.
"Sorry"
"I am sorry, young man," he told
j the slim, good-looking boy stand
ing before him. "The men who fly
our planes must have better eyes
than yours."
The boy, whose name was An
tonio Sanz-Agero, returned to his
friends. His face told them that he
was intensely disappointed. None
of them said much. They all went
to a cafe to drown their sorrows.
Looking Backward
He remembered his family home
in Madrid, the villa which had been
his grandfather's, and his grand
father's father's. The last time he
had seen it, a banner with the ham
mer-and-sickle hung across the
door. The government had taken it
to quarter their troops.
He remembered the two months
he and his mother hid from the
Communists in a hot. damp Madrid
boarding-house. Only twice, and
j then in the dark of night, had lie
dared to leave the place. He had
slipped down a side street to get
! some cigarettes.
For three months before he took
| the pilots test, Antonio Sanz-Agero
' h'td fought rs a volunteer with

Franco's army in the Cordoba cam
paign. He had liked the boys in
trenches beside him, but he hadn't
liked to see them die.
From Seville he took a train across
Spain to San Sebastian, 20 miles
from the French border in the north.
There his family had since his
mother and lie escaped from Ma
drid in a German airplane Ihe sum
mer before. His father commanded
Franco's forces at the border.
His mother was glad that his eyes
had kept him from being a pilot.

JShe understood his burning desire
to fight the Reds, hut mothers whose
sons are pilots are never without
fear.
Before the war, Tito had studied
at the Sch(Kjl of Engineering in Ma
drid. Ol course the school was de
stroyed now, but his family wanted
him to go on with his work.
Laboratory Work
For a while he experimented with
new war gases at the Army labora
tory in Burgos, headquarters of the
Nationalist War Ministry. Then,
one sultry afternoon last August,
the French border patrol visaed a
pass his father had gi /en him, and
Antonio Sanz-Agero saw his war
torn Spain for the last time.
In Paris, night-clubs and cham
paigne created a gaiety he mostly
didn t feel. His sisters and his mother
and his father were still living in a
war. On Sept. 2, the S. S. Cham
plain passed the Statue of Liberty.
Tito was in America for the first
time.
.Such is the story of Antonio Sanz-
Agero, a Stanford junior in engin
eering .who traded the bloody
trenches of Rightist Spain for room
218 in Toy on Hall.
Stanford was very strange for Tito
at first. Before he landed in Amer
ica he spoke no English, could read
but a little with the help of a dic
tionary. But Miss Vivian Church,
the dean of men's secretary whose
special hobby is foreign students,
helped him get started. He got
along.
Today, with Lacho Pedrcro, a
Mexican student also living in
Timlin, as his closest friend, Tito is
very happy. He walks in the coun


ANTONIO SANZ-AGERO
Pi Phis have replaced the Reds
try with pretty Pi Phis in the after
noons, studies hard on his engineer
ing problems at night, spends most
of his week-ends with his Spanish
guardian in San Francisco.
Hunts 'Godmothers'
Before he left Spain to come to
Stanford—Stanford is well-known in
Europe, he says—he told his friends
' that he would get some "god
mothers" for them. "Godmothers"
are the girls who write to the boys
at the Front, send them cigarettes
and candy and their photographs.
He hopes some Stanford girls will
be "godmothers" to his friends in
Spain.
Tito says that he finds most Stan
ford boys and girls in favor of the
Loyalists, but he doesn't mind. "The
Loyalists have the best propaganda
over here," he says. "The papers
keep telling you how good the Loyal
ists are, and how bad the Nationalists
are. How can you tell from the
| newspapers?"
Expects Democracy
j Socialism and Communism are
I fine in theory, he says, but Spain is
1 very traditional. "You can't change
j a whole people overnight."
"Spain should get democracy,"
Tito says sincerely. "But we want
it through education and order and
I peace—not through anarchism."
