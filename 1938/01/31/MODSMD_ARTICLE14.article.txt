# P.C.C. Aide Due on Farm This Week
## Atherton To Survey Card Athletic Aid 
### 
Edwin G. Atherton, former De
partment of Justice agent, is ex
pected to visit Stanford early this
week to investigate sources of fin
ancial aid to athletes, according to
Professor William B. Owens, faculty
representative to the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Employed by the conference, Mr.
Atherton was at California last week,
after previously visiting U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A.
To Find Facts
Purpose of the investigation is to
find the facts about athletes who
must have financial support to at
tend college, said Professor Owens
yesterday.
"This is purely a constructive in
vestigation," he said. "We are not
trying to dig up anything on any
body. Needs and sources of support
are being examined so that the
problem can be dealt with more in
telligently than in the past."
'Not To Embarrass'
He emphasized the fact that infor
mation uncovered will not be used
to disqualify or embarrass any insti
tution. The facts will be used as a
basis for a new set of rules by the
conference.
Spending a few days at each of
the coast colleges, Mr. Atherton is
first making a preliminary tour.
Later he will make a longer, more
oomprehensive visit to each school.
