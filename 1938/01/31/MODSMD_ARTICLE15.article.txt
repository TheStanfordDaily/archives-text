# House To Push Naval Building
## Committee Will Hear Vinson Bill Witness 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (UP).—
The Vinson bill embodying Presi
dent Roosevelt's demand for author
ity to build the greatest war fleet in
American history will be pushed
through Congress with all possible
speed, administration leaders an
nounced tonight.
Hearings on the billion-dollar pro
gram will open tomorrow before the
House Naval Affairs Committee with
Admiral William D. Leahy, chief of
naval operations, as first witness.
Chairman Carl Vinson (Dem., Ga.),
expects to have the program ready
for House action about Feb. 15. He
is confident of final approval of the
measure which authorizes a 20 per
cent horizontal increase over treaty
limits in the navy's fighting strength.
The bill, introduced by Vinson af
ter the President sent a special mes
sage to Congress, provides for three
new battleships which, with the four
already under construction or ap
propriated for in the 1939 naval sup
ply bill, would give the United
States 18 "under age" dreadnaughts.
Other increases authorized in
clude: 1000 airplanes, two new air
craft carriers, eight additional cruis
ers, 25 more destroyers, nine addi
tional submarines and 22 auxiliary
vessels. It is believed the high point
of Admiral Leahy's testimony will
deal with the $15,000,000 appropria
tion President Roosevelt asked for
immediately for construction of
"small experimental vessels."
