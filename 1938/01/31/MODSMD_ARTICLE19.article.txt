# De Cou To Give Travel Speech
## Tour Through Italy To Be Lecture Topic 
### 
"Florence and the Italian Hill !
Towns" will be the subject of a |
musical travelogue by Branson De
Cou, traveler and lecturer, Tuesday
evening at 7:30 o'clock in Memorial
Hall. Some 270 views in color by
Miss Augusta A. Neyder, painter of
miniature landscapes on glass, will
be shown.
Mr. De Cou will take his audience
from Rome to Florence by way of a
pilgrimage to Assisi, with a detour to
the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa.
He will describe the new "David,"
as well as Michelangelo's original,
the rose garden of Villa Lo Strozzino,
the colorful walled gardens and flow- |
ers of Villa l'Ombrellino, and the j
famed Cedars of Lebanon.
The Christian Science Monitor in
Boston has said in review of the
lecture, "The pictures themselves
were masterpieces in color, and their
presentation was unusually delight
ful. It was as if Neighbor De Cou
had dropped into our living room
with a huge portfolio under his arm,
and shown us the pictorial record of
his most recent travels in a simple,
friendly way, chatting amiably with
us about them."
The musical part of the lecture
will be accompaniments of "Medita
tion," by Glazounow, "Santa Lucia
Luntana" sung by the Florentine
choir. "In a Summer Garden" by
Delius, and "The Fountains" by ;
Respighi.
