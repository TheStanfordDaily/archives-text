# 'Buck' Drive Riles Toyon
## 
### 
Angered by the "unrepresentative
group" which passed Toyon Club's
$24 appropriation for the Buck-of
the-Month Club, three Hall men
circulated a petition Thursday night
asking that the vote be taken again
before a larger group. It. was signed
by 45 members, 10 more than ap
peared at the meeting.
Finding that they could do noth
ing about the appropriation, the
three took steps to draw up an
amendment to the Toyon constitu
tion, preveniing similar situations m
the future.
The three parts of the new amend
ment are: (1) that no meeting may
be called without 36 hours notice;
(2) that the nature and purpose of
the meeting must be announced;
and (3) that in the event of insuffi
cient time to call an emergency
meeting, there would be a majority
of the club members present for the
voting.
The amendment must first be read
and passed on by the Toyon cabinet,
a week before it is voted on by the
club. Three-fourths of those pres
ent at the meeting must be in
favor of the amendment before it
will become a part of the consti
tution,
