# Shepard To Speak On KGO Tonight
## 
### 
Dr. Charles E. Shepard, director
of the men's health service, will
speak over KGO tonight at 9:15
o'clock on the subject of programs
for medical care for college students.
"Hygienists are investigating
health programs in 600 American
colleges and universities. The need
for better operating health plans is
felt because of the impossibility of
sick students getting proper atten
tion in fraternity houses and dormi
tories, where the noise makes it dif
ficult for even the healthy student to
live," Dr. Shepard says.
"Where student health plans are
operating successfully, as at Stan
ford, students get better care when
they are sick than other members
of the community, and at less cost."
