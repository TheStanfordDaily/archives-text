# Card Hoopsters Smash Bruins
## Luisetti Hits Basket For 48 Points As Indians Run Wild, 69-33, 36-29 
### 
John Bunn s boys started laughing again tl>is week-end.
Living up to their name for the first time since the 1938 Stanford bas
ketball machine slipped into gear, the Cardinal hoopsters twice scalped the
southern division's cellar residents. U.C.L.A.. 69-33 and 5«-2«l
Captain Hank Luisctti's total of 18 points for the two games led the

in a couple of track meet - *,
the luckless Bruins only coming as
close as five points in one tilt.
Stanford s t>9 points tied the
Laughing Boys' own Pacific Coast
Conference scoring record, made
against U.C.L.A. last year. What's
■ more, the .if>-point difference breaks
| the former "margin-of-victory" rec
| ol d. which was held jointly by Stan
i lord, U.C.L.A., and Cal at 33 points.
Runaway At Half Time
An 8-0 lead in the first four min
utes of Friday's game sprouted into
a 33-17 runaway at half-time, with
Hank and Stoefen monopolizing tho
net most of the time. During that
first period, "Stork" dropped in 17
points, while the Indian captain
grooved the bucket for nine field
i goals and two free throws—2o digits
in all.
And never let it be said that John
Bunn's replacements aren't just as
good as the original equipment. In

the second half, Tom Siebert marked
up five goals in 10 minutes, while
Leon Lafaille was scoring four in
the same time.
It was practically the same in the
second game; the Stanford quintet,
was finally finding itself — getting
rid of that tied-up style of play that
has marked every game so far this
season.
Playing with the Bruins as though
they were movable dummies in a
practice scrimmage, the Car d,s,
: flipped the ball around without much
! hurry, waiting for an opening which
would lead to a sure set-up shot.
Lead For 10 Minutes
Despite this deliberateness, Stan
! ford led 9-0 after 10 minutes of play.
Then U. C. L. A. finally scored its
i first basket.
Hitting from all over the court,
j Hoopin' Hank made four consecutive
! field goals and two free throws for
I 10 points in a row just before the
| close of the first period, which ended
with a 24-7 Stanford lead.
The Card captain rang up 28
; points in the game and probably
j would have broken his own confer
ence record if Coach Bunn had not
: taken him out five minutes before
! the final gun roared.

grooved the bucket for nine field
