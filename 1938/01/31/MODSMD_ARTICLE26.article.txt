## 
### 
"A Winter's Tale" by William Shakespeare will be the next presenta
tion of the Speech and Drama division in the Little Theater for a week
beginning Feb. 7.
Thomas Wood Stevens, well-known Shakespearean authority and
founder ol the Globe Theater Players, will give Ins own streamlined vers- |

ion of the comedy. Mr. Stevens and<
the famous Globe Players secured
an international reputation at the
World's Fair in Chicago and again
at the San Diego Exposition.
Gary Simpson, versatile Farm
actor, will play Leontes, heading a
east of two dozen players.
Long History
The stage history of "'A Winter's
Tale" is a long and traditional one.
Since the days of the Elizabethan era
it has retained the quality of magic
sometimes not prevalent among the
better efforts of Shakespeare.
There are no supernatural or
mythical characters present in the
play. Rather, the appearance of
Shakespeare's famous comedian,
Autolycus, adds more color and
skullduggery to the show. But
comedy alone does not consume all
the action. Tragedy finds its way
into the comic sequences provided
at Autolycus' expense.

The plot of the story revolves
around numerous anachronisms.
Music and romance lighten up the
play, while dancing and singing at
the sheep-shearing festival (minus
the sheep) provides a touch of
simple purity and sweetness elevated
in feeling. All this takes place in
the colorful Renaissance period with
the city of Bohemia as the center of
attraction and activity. Nearby is
the historic Oracle of Apollo fore
casting the events and lives of the
characters.
In the last two acts there is an
artful interchange and blending of
romantic beauty and comic tomfool
ery. The lost princess and heir
apparent of Bohemia, two of Shake
speare's loveliest and noblest crea
tions, occupy the center of the pic
ture. Around them are placed
rustic shepherds and their families
at pleasure and at work. This whole
is enlivened by the tricks and humors
of that prize pickpocket and peddler,
Autolycus.
Dance Arranged
"Gathering Peascod," one of
Shakespeare's favorites songs, is in
serted in the play and a dance has
been arranged by Miss Margaret
Jewell, of the Women's Physical Ed
ucation department, to accompany
the music.
The Winter's Tale will be per
formed on the evenings of Feb. 7, 9,
10, 11, 12, and 14, at 8 o'clock with a
matinee show on Feb. 8 at 4 o'clock.
Admission price is 50 cents and
tickets may be obtained in Room
202 of Memorial Hall or at the door
of the Little Theater at each per
formance.

Long History
The stage history of "'A Winter's
Tale" is a long and traditional one.
Since the days of the Elizabethan era
it has retained the quality of magic
sometimes not prevalent among the
better efforts of Shakespeare.
There are no supernatural or
mythical characters present in the
play. Rather, the appearance of
Shakespeare's famous comedian,
Autolycus, adds more color and
skullduggery to the show. But
comedy alone does not consume all
the action. Tragedy finds its way
into the comic sequences provided
at Autolycus' expense.

The plot of the story revolves
around numerous anachronisms.
Music and romance lighten up the
play, while dancing and singing at
the sheep-shearing festival (minus
the sheep) provides a touch of
simple purity and sweetness elevated
in feeling. All this takes place in
the colorful Renaissance period with
the city of Bohemia as the center of
attraction and activity. Nearby is
the historic Oracle of Apollo fore
casting the events and lives of the
characters.
In the last two acts there is an
artful interchange and blending of
romantic beauty and comic tomfool
ery. The lost princess and heir
apparent of Bohemia, two of Shake
speare's loveliest and noblest crea
tions, occupy the center of the pic
ture. Around them are placed
rustic shepherds and their families
at pleasure and at work. This whole
is enlivened by the tricks and humors
of that prize pickpocket and peddler,
Autolycus.
