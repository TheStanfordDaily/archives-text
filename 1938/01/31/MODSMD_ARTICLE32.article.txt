# Vines Flays Perry In S. J. Tonight
## 
### 
Fred Perry and Ellsworth Vines,
top professional tennis stars, will
fight it out tonight in the San Jose
Auditorium in one of their matches
of the winter tour that will take them
all over the United States. Walter
Senior and Berkeley Bell complete
the touring group.
Vines and Perry are out to try to
lick each other in every match this
year, because the winner will get
the call to play the next amateur
top-notcher to turn pro. From cur
rent reports this is likely to be Don
Budge.
