For the first time in the history of
the Farm, there is only one man in
the Men's Rest Home, acording to
Mrs. Clifford Allen, matron. Even
this record was almost surpassed,
for with all inmates well and dis
charged in the morning, the house
was empty until a call from the
hospital announced a new patient.
