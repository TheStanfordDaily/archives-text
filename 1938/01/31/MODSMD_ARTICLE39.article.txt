### WALT PETERSON. Sports Editor 
JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES
If you had told me at the end of
last spring volume that I would be
sports editor again this spring 1
would have laughed in your face.
When I passed over the job to
Gene Gear with best wishes and j
stuff I kissed it goodbye forever,
but now look. He gives it back to
me, and I welcome it like an old
friend. It's nice to be back in the
old traces again.
OUTSIDE OF A FEW
MISTAKES. IT'S FINE
As far as anybody knows, Cap
tain Hank Luisetti is the first athlete
found worthy of two full pages of
Labeled the basketball player of the
year by the picture book, Hank is
splashed into a double truck with a
.swell close-up and esareis ofL
swell close-up and a series of fair
"Magic Eye" photos showing him
executing a reverse dribble.
The art work was done by Barney
Peterson of the S. F. Chronicle. He
did a swell job of the close-up, got
Hank's dimples and everything, but
his movie shots were ordinary. Not
only .that, but even though the re
verse dribble (changing direction by
bouncing the ball behind you) is a
spectacular maneuver, it is practi
cally never used in actual play.
Another photo, which shows Jack
Calderwood going after the ball in
the second U.S.C. game, is mis
takenly identified. H. B. Lee lies
on the floor, and LIFE says it's
Luisetti. Also, it wasn't the scramble
in which Hank got the cut eye, be
cause that was in the first game
and besides only Gail Goodrich of
U.S.C. was involved.
Outside of that the pictures are
swell.
JULIE BESCOS
ISN'T DIPLOMATIC
Julie Bescos, former U.S.C. bas
ketball marvel and now coach of the J
Trobabes, was asked to the mike |
during the broadcast of the second j
Cal-Troy game Saturday night, and |
he didn't make anybody love him j
the more for it.
Julie pulled a little sour grapes by
saying that Nibs Price, Bear coach,
had at last gotten wise to the best
defense—the one that stopped U.S.C.
Friday night—by shifting from his
zone method to Troy Coach Sam
Barry's tight man-to-man. He
wouldn't give Nibs credit for the
fact that his Bears were trimming
U.S.C. Saturday at halftime with a
regulation zone defense.
He also got in the crack that a
lot of people would like to make,
but don't because it wouldn't be
nice—to the effect that the Cal band
is very nasty in mocking school
songs of visiting teams. Whether the
remark was justified is none of any
body's business, but it wasn't very
smart of Julie to say so, especially
when his team was behind.
This is going to be a lively spring.
