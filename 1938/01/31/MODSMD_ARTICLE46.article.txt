# Frosh Trounce Two Foes
## Santa Rosa, Galileo Fall To Yearlings Encina Quintet Prepares For Cal Preliminary 
### JERRY MAYER 
With the first of three "grudge"
battles with Cal's clawless Cubs on
tap for Friday night, Stanford's
freshman hoopsters will settle down
to serious practice this week.
Coach Wytze Gorter's proteges
won two more games last week-end
as a preparation for Friday night's
preliminary tilt with the Cubs, de
feating a weak Galileo High team
Friday night, 30-20, and ambushing
Santa Rosa High the following eve
ning by a 43-21 score.
Trail At Half
The Papooses turned in a 50-50
performance over the week-end,
even though they managed to win
both games handily. The Tom De
Nyke-coached Lions gave them a
tremendous battle during the first
half of Friday's battle before the
frosh finally woke up in the second
half to steamroller their foes.
Although they have been a walk
ing mat for opponents this season,
the Lions were out in front by a 13-
12 score at half-time, partly due to
their own good playing, but mostly
due to the uninspired play of the
frosh.
Coach Goiter can take a joke, but
he doesn't think it's funny when his
team is trailing an inferior bunch of
preps. He especially fails to see the
joke when his team isn't giving its
best. The result was that he talked
to the boys between the halves—
and talked to them "gently" and
"understandingly."
Oration Helps
After his quiet little oration the
boys came out with slightly red
faces—and, incidentally, they man
aged to outscore Galileo 18-7 in the
last half.
Mike Marshall bucketed 10 points
to walk off with high point honors,
being followed by Bill Niccolls and
Kenny Davidson with seven apiece.
Gene Galetti, Lion center, led the
losers with six points. Don Williams
was playing with a bad cold but
still turned in his customary excel
lent game.
Don Burness Tops
Saturday night's fracas with Santa
Rosa High showed the frosh at their
best. Don Burness, after a miser
able performance Friday eve, reai'ed
back into top form and galloped off
with high point honors with 13
digits. The Panthers are not to be
underrated by the wide 43-21 mar
gin.
Coach Orbin Fortiers brought
down a good team; one that had
been beaten; previous to Saturday
night, only once in three years.
The frosh displayed their best
team play of the season and were
working the ball in for set-ups from
every angle. Half-time score was
22-9 and the margin gradually
widened until the entrance of Stan
ford's subs in the closing minutes.
Even the. reserves looked better
and managed to more than hold the
Panthers even.

half to steamroller their foes.
Although they have been a walk
ing mat for opponents this season,
the Lions were out in front by a 13-
12 score at half-time, partly due to
their own good playing, but mostly
due to the uninspired play of the
frosh.
Coach Goiter can take a joke, but
he doesn't think it's funny when his
team is trailing an inferior bunch of
preps. He especially fails to see the
joke when his team isn't giving its
best. The result was that he talked
to the boys between the halves—
and talked to them "gently" and
"understandingly."
Oration Helps
After his quiet little oration the
boys came out with slightly red
faces—and, incidentally, they man
aged to outscore Galileo 18-7 in the
last half.
Mike Marshall bucketed 10 points
to walk off with high point honors,
being followed by Bill Niccolls and
Kenny Davidson with seven apiece.
Gene Galetti, Lion center, led the
losers with six points. Don Williams
was playing with a bad cold but
still turned in his customary excel
lent game.
Don Burness Tops
Saturday night's fracas with Santa
Rosa High showed the frosh at their
best. Don Burness, after a miser
able performance Friday eve, reai'ed
back into top form and galloped off
with high point honors with 13
digits. The Panthers are not to be
underrated by the wide 43-21 mar
gin.
Coach Orbin Fortiers brought
down a good team; one that had
been beaten; previous to Saturday
night, only once in three years.
The frosh displayed their best
team play of the season and were
working the ball in for set-ups from
every angle. Half-time score was
22-9 and the margin gradually
widened until the entrance of Stan
ford's subs in the closing minutes.
Even the. reserves looked better
and managed to more than hold the
Panthers even.

freshman hoopsters will settle down
to serious practice this week.
Coach Wytze Gorter's proteges

Trail At Half
The Papooses turned in a 50-50
performance over the week-end,
