# League Plans To Aid China Without U.S.
## 
### 
GENEVA, Jan. 30 (UP).â€”A semi
official announcement tonight said
that the League of Nations Council
will proceed with its plan to aid
China without seeking endorsement
of the United States.
The announcement, apparently in
spired by British quarters, was is
sued after Secretary of State Cor
dell Hull in Washington indicated
that the United States would con
tinue, without change, its policy of
permitting arms shipments to both
Japan and China.
Powers' Hopes Crushed
This information crushed hopes of
Britain, France and Soviet Russia
that the United States might join
with them in carrying out a secretly
devised plan of providing China with
arms, ammunition, and credit to
resist the Japanese army.
League of Nations approval of the
resolution, which reaffirms last Oc
tober's recommendation that League
states "should consider how far they
can individually extend aid to
China" and "consult with other na
tions outside the League," seemed
assured tonight as result of Poland's
consent to abstain from voting on
the matter. Poland has consistently
objected to proposals arranged by
the big League powers without
previous council authorization.
French Hesitant
In view of the United States pol
icy of strict neutrality and the
French amendments to the resolu
tion, which Chinese delegates com
plained showed "a hesitant attitude"
on France's part, it was widely be
lieved that the resolution would
constitute only repetition of last Oc
tober's statement without any con
crete. action. The attitude of the
United States, it wa sreported here,
may have the effect of weakening
French support of the plan of direct
aid.
No reference was made in the an
nouncement to the Franco-British-
Soviet plan of approaching the
United States regarding extension of
material aid to the Chinese.
