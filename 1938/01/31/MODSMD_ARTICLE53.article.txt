# Business as Usual

Dear gordy:
New editors usually start these "dear
blank" letters with self-conscious expressions
of thanks and end them with long explanations
of new volume policy. I'm going to say thanks,
Gordy, for all your help, and congratulations
on one of the finest volumes in Daily history.
But I'm not going to define a rigid policy.
Essentially policy will be the sum of re
actions that the staff and I will have to future
situations, most of them still unforeseen. And
I don't know myself v/ell enough to predict all
those reactions; God knows I don't know the
staff well enough.
What usually has passed for a prospectus of
policy in these letters actually is an enumera
tion of the changes the writer would like to
make to prove to himself that he really is the
boss. That he seldom puts more than half of
the list into effect merely proves that editors
come and go, but The Daily goes on for
ever. I remember Eisenbach's complete baffle
ment when he realized that he was at the mercy
of the reporters and desk men who really put
out the paper.
Of course, Gordy, there are these columns in
v/hich we can say what we think, within rea
son. It goes without saying that lohnny Cobbs,
Jim Stone, and I will have observations to make
about what transpires in the circle around the
Quad, and some of them will be caustic. But
that again is not entirely on our own initiative.
It's part of the tradition, and no man could be
around this social institution we call The Daily
for a few years without coming to believe that
comment is his divine right.
That I believe is as it should be. Even people
in the Ad Building have been known to admit
that Daily editorials do more good than harm.
To the writers, learning to stand behind their
edits is a hardening and refining process.
You spoke in your semi-annual message of
the virtue of not taking things too seriously.
I subscribe only partially to that idea. Objec
tivity and ability to put events in their proper
perspective are jewels greatly to be sought for,
but after all we're really living. College so
ciety is admittedly artificial, but we are eating
and sleeping, not in a Jtate of suspended ani
mation in our four years here. I'm going to
play my part for all the emotional kick I can
get from it.
Yet, as I said before, there are no momentous
changes around here, though the "under new
management" sign is hung. The inner sanc
tum you left last week is about the same, though
the editor's desk has been moved slightly to
the left.
Yours,
Lap
