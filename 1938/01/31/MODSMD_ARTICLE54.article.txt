# Where Angels Fear To Tread

WHEN it made its debut as an active Stan
ford organization late last week, the Axe
Society showed that its education in the social
amenities of a debutante had been sorely ne
glected. In its method of aiding the Tiny-
Buck of-the-Month Club, it showed a marvelous
disregard for the tender corns on student and
administrative toes.
There is apparently no legal measure which
Ex Committee can take to prevent the solici
tation of campus groups for funds. Neither is it
the concern of any but the living groups them
selves that house and club contributions were
often voted through by Executive Councils, or
by unrepresentative groups within the organ
izations. Nor did faculty advisers of Axe So
ciety hear of its actions except through round
about sources. Though not legally open to
censure, the Society is going to have a tough
time explaining the black eye hung on it by
the appearance of such methods.
When nine athletes turned up short of schol
arships on the Buck-of-the-Month Club roster,
other scholarship students dug into their pock
ets, managed to scrape together enough to
take care of five of them. The Axe Society, in
a tender-hearted moment, then started solicita
tion of campus living groups for the remaining
four scholarships.
Candidates for Buck of-the-Month Club schol
arships are selected by four coaches, Bunn,
Thornhill, Templeton, and Wolters, who sub
mit their lists with names arranged in order
of preference. A committee of three, headed by
James Howell, then examines each candidate
to insure the presence of real need, and auto
matically awards from 20 to 25 scholarships
from the coaches' list.
The Buck of the Month Club is unconnected
in any wuy with Stanford, cxcept in this finan

cial aid to a limited number of students. In its
active membership of 850, perhaps 20 are stu
dents, 15 per cent are not even alumni.
The support of athletes is a question which
need not be debated at present. But when stu
dents, under the instigation of a student organ
ization, contribute to a cause which they can
only rationalize into validity under a different
appearance, they are deceiving themselves by
a strange sleight-of-hand.
The broad cause—support of needy students
—is undeniably worthy. But should support be
given a group of students chosen primarily for
their athletic ability? Should the Axe be swung
to support students chosen for their potential
all-round contribution to the University, only
praise would be the lot of the committee.
But student action, for the benefit of a few
students, for purposes admittedly not scholas
tic, and over which no control of the choice can
be exercised by contributors, deserves more
consideration than Axe Society's hurried
handling of the project would indicate. .—J. S.

The support of athletes is a question which
need not be debated at present. But when stu
dents, under the instigation of a student organ
ization, contribute to a cause which they can
only rationalize into validity under a different
appearance, they are deceiving themselves by
a strange sleight-of-hand.
The broad cause—support of needy students
—is undeniably worthy. But should support be
given a group of students chosen primarily for
their athletic ability? Should the Axe be swung
to support students chosen for their potential
all-round contribution to the University, only
praise would be the lot of the committee.
But student action, for the benefit of a few
students, for purposes admittedly not scholas
tic, and over which no control of the choice can
be exercised by contributors, deserves more
consideration than Axe Society's hurried
handling of the project would indicate. .—J. S.
WHEN it made its debut as an active Stan
ford organization late last week, the Axe
Society showed that its education in the social
amenities of a debutante had been sorely ne
glected. In its method of aiding the Tiny-
Buck of-the-Month Club, it showed a marvelous
disregard for the tender corns on student and
administrative toes.
There is apparently no legal measure which
Ex Committee can take to prevent the solici
tation of campus groups for funds. Neither is it
the concern of any but the living groups them
selves that house and club contributions were
often voted through by Executive Councils, or
by unrepresentative groups within the organ
izations. Nor did faculty advisers of Axe So
ciety hear of its actions except through round
about sources. Though not legally open to
censure, the Society is going to have a tough
time explaining the black eye hung on it by
the appearance of such methods.
When nine athletes turned up short of schol
arships on the Buck-of-the-Month Club roster,
other scholarship students dug into their pock
ets, managed to scrape together enough to
take care of five of them. The Axe Society, in
a tender-hearted moment, then started solicita
tion of campus living groups for the remaining
four scholarships.
Candidates for Buck of-the-Month Club schol
arships are selected by four coaches, Bunn,
Thornhill, Templeton, and Wolters, who sub
mit their lists with names arranged in order
of preference. A committee of three, headed by
James Howell, then examines each candidate
to insure the presence of real need, and auto
matically awards from 20 to 25 scholarships
from the coaches' list.
The Buck of the Month Club is unconnected
in any wuy with Stanford, cxcept in this finan

cial aid to a limited number of students. In its
active membership of 850, perhaps 20 are stu
dents, 15 per cent are not even alumni.
