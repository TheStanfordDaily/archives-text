# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
PROSPECTUS
WRITE honestly; to criticize constructively.
These, it seems to me, are pretty good pegs for a
Bull Sessioner to hang his daily dozen on, and on them
I shall attempt to hang mine.
Whether Bull Session will temper its wind to Stan
ford's many shorn lambs remains to be seen; offhand, I
doubt it. One thing I can think of in particular, and
many in general, seem to me to be begging for a little
discussion; and since I feel that one of Bull Session's
chief purposes should be to shake campus thought out
of its customary lethargy, I shall probably get around
to them sooner or later.
* * * *
In regard to general policy, Bull Session will look
beyond the confines of the Farm this volume at some
of the more vital and more interesting happenings in
national and international affairs.
Despite high-flown phrases, governments are al
ways, in the last analysis, governments of men rather
than laws; and when an interesting personality rises
from the hubbub of the week's news, Bull Session may
attempt to place him against his proper background.
When a consul gets slapped or a munitions factory
blows up, Bull Session may take time out to comment
on the fact.
* * * *
WO VITAL, and yet so vast and complex, are the
k currents which move the world, that no one can
say what events and what people hold the key to the
future. One can only realize that everything that
happens—every program, every speech from Palazzo
de Venezia or the Kremlin, every pawn moved in the
great checkerboard of international politics and per
sonalities—inevitably affects us in some manner, re
mote though it may seem.
One can only guess as to outcomes; but facts, each
doing its bit to mold the future, and change the pres
ent, are facts; and Bull Session will note them as such.
* * * #
Lastly, from time to time there may appear the
name and views of Emery Bellwether, a friend of mine
who is convinced, as I am, that eternal vigilance is
indeed the price of democracy; and that Stanford
democracy is no exception.
A column of comment and controversy, as well
written as could be expected when it has to be turned
out five days a week, as intelligent as I can make it—
that will be Bull Session for Volume 93.
To write honestly; to criticize constructively.
I can at least take a stab at it.

WO VITAL, and yet so vast and complex, are the
k currents which move the world, that no one can
say what events and what people hold the key to the
future. One can only realize that everything that
happens—every program, every speech from Palazzo
de Venezia or the Kremlin, every pawn moved in the
great checkerboard of international politics and per
sonalities—inevitably affects us in some manner, re
mote though it may seem.
One can only guess as to outcomes; but facts, each
doing its bit to mold the future, and change the pres
ent, are facts; and Bull Session will note them as such.

Lastly, from time to time there may appear the
name and views of Emery Bellwether, a friend of mine
who is convinced, as I am, that eternal vigilance is
indeed the price of democracy; and that Stanford
democracy is no exception.
A column of comment and controversy, as well
written as could be expected when it has to be turned
out five days a week, as intelligent as I can make it—
that will be Bull Session for Volume 93.
To write honestly; to criticize constructively.
I can at least take a stab at it.

PROSPECTUS
WRITE honestly; to criticize constructively.
These, it seems to me, are pretty good pegs for a
Bull Sessioner to hang his daily dozen on, and on them
I shall attempt to hang mine.
Whether Bull Session will temper its wind to Stan
ford's many shorn lambs remains to be seen; offhand, I
doubt it. One thing I can think of in particular, and
many in general, seem to me to be begging for a little
discussion; and since I feel that one of Bull Session's
chief purposes should be to shake campus thought out
of its customary lethargy, I shall probably get around
to them sooner or later.

In regard to general policy, Bull Session will look
beyond the confines of the Farm this volume at some
of the more vital and more interesting happenings in
national and international affairs.
Despite high-flown phrases, governments are al
ways, in the last analysis, governments of men rather
than laws; and when an interesting personality rises
from the hubbub of the week's news, Bull Session may
attempt to place him against his proper background.
When a consul gets slapped or a munitions factory
blows up, Bull Session may take time out to comment
on the fact.
