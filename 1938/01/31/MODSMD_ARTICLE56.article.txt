Phew because Freddie Nagel is back at Del Monte
and we can't say that we're not glad. Freddie was just
a little too sickening, and at any moment one expected
to see huge gobs of syrupy saxes come floating down on
the floor in the Mural Room.
However, taking his place is the best dance band in
San Francisco. Our old friend of the movies, Roger
Pryor, son of the famous military band director, has
come into the Gate city with a musical aggregation
that should cause all sorts of glee to awake in the
hearts of the collegians.
When we saw him on his opening night, he had the
identical instrumentation that Benny Goodman uses
on his broadcasts. Of course this doesn't mean much
except that the men in the band are definitely above
the average found in San Francisco, and the combina
tion of good men, plus good instrumentation has given
Pryor a swell outfit. The swing men aren't bad at
all, and he has a corn arrangment of "Josephine" that
ought to tell you immediately how silly the Wayne
King types of music are.

VEXT in line with Roger Pryor is the "old left
hander," Joe Sanders. Sanders was half of the
old Coon-Sanders Nighthawks when that name meant
something to people who buy records. Since the death
of his partner, he has organized a band that, while it
isn't sensational, is solid; the saxes play in tune, the
arrangements aren't too trite, and, if you like it, there's
the Sanders' personality on vocals. So, if you're one
of those people who doesn't have to go to a certain
place because it's the thing to do, you'll find a swell
night of dancing ahead of you in Rose Room Bowl,
with the Sanders voice telling you at the end of each
dance group, "Ree-lax."

As for the Mark and the Fairmont, there you will
hear two bands that are just dance bands. Neither one
of them has anything sensational to offer, and the best
thing to do when you're dancing, is to grope your way
around on the floor, and pray that they won't play
rhumbas or tangos.
It's hard to say anything bad about them, but it is
even harder to say anything good. Henry King and
Joe Reichman know what the largest group of the pub
lic wants—the group that always votes for Guy Lom
bardo as the best dance band—and they give it to them,
till it hurts.
So if you're going to the city just for dancing,
you'll probably like these last two the best. On the
other hand, if you like music that has some sparkle,
pep, a realization thai swing isn't a life and death mat
ter (I think it is) and a sense of musical humor, we
can't recommend too strongly linger l'ryor and Joe
Sanders. McGuirk.
