# Axe Society Raises $396 For Athletes
## Contributions Nearly Complete Goal Set For Scholarships 
### 
Reaching a total of $369.84, con
tributed by campus living groups,
the Axe Society's drive for four
scholarships has come to a close
with the certainty that the fund
will be enough to see the needy stu
dents through the quarter.
The fund was raised by soliciting
contributions from the various living
groups on the campus. Each organ
ization was asked to contribute
enough for one year's subscription
to the Tiny-Buck-of-the-Month
Club, or $12.
Requirements Reduced
At the first of the quarter, four
coaches, John Bunn, Dink Temple
ton, Tiny Thornhill, and Harry
Wolter, submitted the names of 35
men to be awarded scholarships.
The Buck-of-the-Month Club, how
ever, had funds for only 26 of these.
Most of the original 26 men re
duced their requirements so that
three more men were added to the
list. Two more men were taken care
of through voluntary outside con
tribution. The remaining four now
have been taken care of by the Axe
Society's drive. These men are ex
pected to forfeit as much as others
have, making up the necessary total
of $460 for four tuition and com
munity fee payments.
Applicants Interviewed
Final awarding of scholarships is
made by a committee of three head
ed by James Howell, Stanford alum
nus, after they have interviewed
each applicant personally.
The recommendation that Axe So
ciety attempt to raise more funds
for scholarships was made by one of
its members, who had heard of the
students' difficulties. Andy Stojko
vich, secretary of the society, was in
charge of gathering the contribu
tions.
