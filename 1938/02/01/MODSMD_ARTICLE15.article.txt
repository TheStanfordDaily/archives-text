# Stagers Read Play Tomorrow
## 'Five Star Final' To Be Presented 
### 
"Yellow journalism" will be ex
posed tomorrow night before a Stan
ford audience when Stagers' "Five-
Star Final" shows the "inside dope"
on the harm done by sensational
newssheets.
Phyllis Lakin has been cast as
Nancy Voorhees Townsend, the
woman who is driven to suicide by
the houndings of the unscrupulous
paper, and Pete Simmons takes the
role of Randall, hard-hearted man
aging editor.
Onyet Watson, as Jenny Town
send, the daughter of the tragic vic
tim, shares the love interest oppo
site Pres Ellingston, as Phyllis Week.s
The comedy, in the character of
Ziggie Feinstein, the paper's feature
editor, is in the hands of Nick Al
exander.
Today, mimic newssheets will be
distributed about the campus with
the advice to Stanford career
women that it is not good policy to
fall in love with one's boss â€” one
moral of the play.
Tickets, which sold for $5 during
the play's run in New York, will be
on sale for 15 cents at the door of
the Little Theater.
