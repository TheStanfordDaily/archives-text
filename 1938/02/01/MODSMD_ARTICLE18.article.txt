# 'Dividend Plate' Proves Success, Wins Third of Union's Noon, Dinner Patrons
## 
### 
Only a week after their introduc
tion, "Dividend Plate" meals are now
being ordered by approximately 30
per cent of the Union Cellar's lunch
eon and dinner customers, Miss
Christine Ricker, director of dining
rooms and of the Stanford Union,
announced yesterday.
Of 376 patrons yesterday noon, 125
i ordered the special extra-size lunch
j eon, she said.
This percentage is based not upon
the total daily patronage of the Cel
lar, Miss Ricker emphasized, but
upon a tabulation of the checks
turned in between 11:30 and 2
o'clock, the hours when the 35 cent
luncheons and 50 cent, dinners are
served.
Although she believes that a week
is too short a period for the making
of any long-range conclusions re
garding the meals inaugurated last
Monday at the request of a special
A.S.S.U. committee, Miss Ricker is
j of the opinion that "the 'Dividend
| Plate' has accomplished what stu

dents have tried to get—inexpens
ive, filling meals such as an organ
ized eating group would offer."
Less student comment than was
expected has been received by Union
officials upon the new meals, she
indicated. Miss Ricker added that
"attention is usually given to food
only if it is liked or disliked, but
the average seem to be pleased by
the new luncheons and dinners."
''The fact that the 'Dividend Plates'
have just been accepted with so
little comment means that they
probably answer the problem," the
director said.
However, orders for "Dividend
Plates" proportionately are not very
much greater than requests for pop
ular specials previously offered, Miss
Ricker estimated.
While some students have com
mented that the servings are too
large and have requested smaller
portions, the director believes that
the chief criticism of the new meals
is that, because of mechanical space

limitations of the Cellar kitchen,
they limit the choice and variation
possible on the rest of the menu.
Union officials also declare that
any estimate on the number of
"Dividend Plates" that may be or
dered at a particular meal "is al
ways a gamble." However, they re
port that there has been consider
able less fluctuation in demand for
♦he meals following the first day.
Tentative weekly menus for the
meals, which were adopted by the
Union Board of Directors 10 days
ago as a non-profit, subsidized ven
ture, were drawn up by Union
dieticians in cooperation with a spe
cial student committee.
Members of this committee were
A.S.S.U. President Tom Killefer,
Student Manager "Chuck" Fontius,
former Daily Editor Gordy Frost,
and present Daily Editor Lloyd Lap
ham, who wrote a recently pub
lished series of articles presenting a
behind the scene" view of Union
problems.
