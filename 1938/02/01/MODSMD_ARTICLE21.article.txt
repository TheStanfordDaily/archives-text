SHANGHAI, Jan. 31 (UP). —
China, marking the start of a new I
year, assembled its fighting forces to
day for the most important military
campaign in its history as a republic
—the defense of China's defense
line along the "Lunghai" railroad.
As the Japanese organized 200,000
troops for a drive against the stra
tegic East-West rail line in an at
tempt to sever North and South
China from the East Coast inland
to Sian, China's leading generals j
brought up their forces for a de- j
fense.
