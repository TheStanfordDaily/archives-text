will speak at the Palo Alto Com

The American Youth Hostel As
sociation was organized to give high
school and college students a place
to go over the week-end where they
can hike, bicycle and enjoy the out
of-doors. The cost of membership
is $1 a year or 25 cents a night.
There are five hostels in the bay
area, located at Half Moon Bay,
Montara, Los Altos and Santa Cruz.
The organization hopes to estab
lish a chain of hostels along the
coast at intervals of about 15 miles.
