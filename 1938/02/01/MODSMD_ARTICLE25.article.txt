# 'Y' Finance Drive Closes Near Goal
## 
### 
With an official collection total of
$784.68 reported last night as the
final figure for the Y.W.C.A. Finance
Drive, this year's campaign came to
a close.
Although late contributions turn
ed in to Virginia Clausen, treasurer,
did not raise the concluding contri
bution record to the drive goal set
at $1000, the committee feels that the
campaign has proven a reasonable
success.
Anne Martineau, chairman of
finance on the "Y" cabinet, said that
she wished to thank all those who
have co-operated in the drive.
The committee under whose lead
ership the drive was carried, in
cluded Jackie Brown. Anne Mar
tineau. Barbara Goodrich, Mary Kay
Horton, Jean Hiler, Kay Fitzpatrick.
Virginia Clausen, and Jean Bolton.
