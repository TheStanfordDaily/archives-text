# Excom Will Act On Ticket Blocks
## Complete Sell-Out In One Hour Draws Protests From Rooters 
### 
Because rooters tickets for the Cal name were sold out yesterday in
an hour and five minutes, Ex Committee tonight will gnaw at an old hone
how to sell basketball tickets so no one gets mad.
Nettled protests have been aimed all day at A.S.S.U. President Tom
Killefer, and he expects Ex Committee action at the meeting.
"One person bought the last 32 tickets while there was a long waiting

â–º line, went one complaint.
A student was sitting on the
B.A.c. steps at 6:30 o'clock, waiting
to get a block of tickets for his
house, it was reported. Someone
brought him his breakfast.

Scalping season already is open,
with three students advertising on
the Toyon bulletin board that each
will pay $3 for a pair of rooters'
tickets.
A possible solution would be sell
ing only one to a customer, Kille
ler suggested yesterday. "It's the
only thing for the Cal game," he
said, pointing out that Big Game
tickets are sold that way. This
change would meet the approval of
Alfred R. Masters, general manager
of the 8.A.C., Killefer said.
Liebendorfer Replies
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. news
director, yesterday said that the
University was answering student
demands when it began selling tick
ets more than one to a customer.
'Three or four years ago they
said they wanted it this way," he
said. "They complained they had
classes and asked why someone else
couldn't bring over their student
body cards instead."
Although some of the Cal game
tickets were left for general sale
last year, almost all of them went
up for student sale this year, ac
cording to Mr. Liebendorfer. Out
of the 2650 seats in the Pavilfari>
1150 were sold at Stanford and 1350
were sent to Berkeley, where they
were exhausted yesterday a few
hours after being put on sale.
Staff Gets Tickets
The remainder of the seats, said
Mr. Liebendorfer, are being held for
team benches, press, and two each
for the University athletic staff.
"Cal wanted more tickets this
year because she's up on top," said
Mr. Liebendorfer. "Some years one
team or the other is down near the
bottom, and we don't have any
trouble with too few seats. We can
even put some on sale to the pub
lic those years."
Garrctson To Report
Other Ex Committee business in
cludes a report from Jackie Brown's
committee, which has been spending
the week pondering what Stanford's
part will be in the nationwide cam
paign to raise $25,000 to help stu
dents in Chinese war zones. Bob
Garretson will make the report, as
Miss Brown is in the Rest Home.
Tom Killefer will announce the
appointment of an election board
member to replace Henry Ward
Beecher, who is not at Stanford this
quarter.
Plans for student-faculty bull
sessions and at-homes, a student
leadership institute, and next year's
pre-registration program will also
come up for discussion.
