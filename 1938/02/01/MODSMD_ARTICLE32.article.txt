# Students Write Few, Receive Many Letters

### 
Stanford students get three times
as much mail as they send out.
According to Superintendent John
Callahan of l4 >( ' Stanford Post Of
fice, the average incoming mail here
is 30 sacks a day, average out-going
mail is 10 sacks. The estimated in
coming parcel post for 1937 was 47,-
000 letters.
It takes about ;ur hour to get all
of the first-class mail in the boxes

days, there are five deliveries and
six pick-ups. Most Stanford stu

p.m., 2:53, 4:55, 6, 7:30.
Largest mail of the day is the
7:45 delivery. Lightest is the 5:35

I boxes in 15 minutes, as compared to
the usual hour for other deliveries,
jOf interest to students from down
south should be the 9:2s*delivery,
j when mail from there comes in.
On Sundays and holidays, the only
i delivery is at 10:30 a.m., and the two
dispatches are at 2:30 and 7:30.
