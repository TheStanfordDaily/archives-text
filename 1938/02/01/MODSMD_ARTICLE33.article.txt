# Rain Postpones 1938 Opening Of Lagunita
## University Sets Regulations For Use Of Lake, Canoes 
### 
Too much water cancelled yester
day's scheduled opening of La
gunitaâ€”the Farm's largest body of
water.
A steady, day-long downpour
made necessary postponement of the
1938 official opening. According to
Ernst M. Brandsten, . dvisory direc
tor of water sports, the first clear,
warm day will be set for the open
ing.
Rules Issued
Operation of the lake's facilities
will be on the same basis as in the
past, Mr. Brandsten said. Until the
arrival of warm weather, the lake
will be closed except from 19 a.m. to
li p.m. Later, night boating will be
permitted.
As a precaution against acci
dents, tiie University has made nu
merous regulations and has set cer
tain rules for use of Lagunita.
At the boathouse and along the
shores are "Swimming at your own
risk'' signs. A guard will be on duty
at the boathouse at all times that
the lake is in use and on Sundays
additional guards will be provided.
Guards On Duty
Two spotlights have been placed
on the boathouse balcony to insure
immediate location of any boat
which might overturn at night, and
no swimming is permitted after
dark.
Each canoe or boat leaving the
boathouse must have one life pre
server for each passenger, according
to Mr. Brandsten, and the guards
will be available for rescue of ca
noeists or boaters who upset.
The University does not encourage
"tilting" or playing in boats.
