TIIE EASTERNERS
FINALLY CAME AKOUND
Three years ago the basketball
coaches in the East and Mid-West
hadn't seen Stanford play basketball
in fact, they hadn't seen a Western
team pi»y the wide open type of
basketball used on this coast.
Now, Western basketball includes
a few fundamentals of play that
were taboo in Easterners' eyes three
short years ago. Principal of those
fundamentals are the one-handed
shot, the zone defense, and lively
"passing the ball around."
When Coach John Bunn took the
Stanford varsity to the Atlantic
seaboard in the winter of 193G —
that was the team captained by
Dinty Moore—he started something.
That Stanford team, capable of play
ing any type of basketball, had to
lit itself to the rules that guided the
unenlightened type of play of the
Eastern colleges.
Those rules greatly favored a
man-to-man defense. To quote
Coach Bunn, "According to the
coaches of the East, any defense but
mmi-to-man absolutely ruined the
game. They couldn't countenance a
zone defense."
The team that scoured the East
this past winter had a different
proposition on its hands. The team
of thi' year before had done its work
so well that this year's squad found
Stanford's method of play springing
up all over the sector. Long Island
U. and Temple, always the staunch
es! supporters of man-to-man you'd
ever want to see, have made ft com
plete about-face and are using a de
fense that Coach John Bunn says
he can't distinguish from his own.
This occurred all in one year.
LUISETTI'S STYLE
GAVE 'EM THE BUG
As for the one-handed shot—why,
sue ft goings-on were the silliest way
of making points the easterners had
ever seen. They thought it was im
possible, but after they watched Lui
selti, Stoefen and Turner tear their
defenses to bits with the one-handed
stuff they changed their minds.
This year when the team went
back they found the one-handed
shot blossoming like the zone de
fense. Every player had the idea he
could shoot like Luisetti, which is
also true around here.
The staid method of getting points
before the overnight shift in style
was the old "set" shot. Give your
scorer the ball anywhere from 10
to 40 feet out, let him get both feet
set and both hands set, and then
watch him swish 'em. It was a fine
style, until a zone defense prevented
blocking off guards to leave the star
shooter free once in a while.
Stanford players made points so
fast and furiously with one hand or
the other that they convinced the
Easterners of the folly of their ways.
FOLLOWS ON HEELS
Ol CENTER-JUMP SQUABBLE
Ail this speeding up of play in the
East followed the controversy that
was brought up by Coaches Bunn
and Sam Barry, U.S.C., over the
center-jump. Bunn and Barry start
ed the elimination of the center
tip after each goal because they
found it speeded the game up tre
mendously.
The Easterners claimed it would
he too hard on the athletes—that
going 20-minute halves with the tip
was hard enough, let alone without.
After Coach Bunn proved to them
with tests of the heart action of
players before and after each type
oi play that it certainly wasn't any
harder on them, the die-hards came
around. That's all they play in the
fast leagues now.
It is to be expected that with the
acceptance of the sort of play used
on the Pacific Coast by the eastern
ers, the Coast teams are going to
find the competition increasingly
sliffer each year back there. The
East is wel-founded in the funda-
East is well-founded in the funda
played it much longer than the
Coast, and there should be some
tough teams out of there in the next
10 years.—Peterson.
