# Bunn Drills Seconds On Fast Break
## Luisetti Points Towards High Score Record 
### 
Planning to put the final polish on j
a fast-break that finally started .
breaking in last week-end's double- :
header massacre, John Bunn yester
day scrimmaged his reserves, giving i
; the varsity a rest.
While the reserves were working
out, Don Liebendorfer came through
, with some interesting facts in re- .
j gard to the status of the southern di
j vision basket bailers.
Best news of all to Farm hoop
I fanatics is the elimination of back !
rests on the Pavilion seats. If the !
majority of you will stop cheering j
for a moment, let it be explained to I
the uninitiated that this will enable 1
■ knees to be placed where they be- !
j long—not jammed up against one's j
' face.
Shoots For Records
All Stanfordites should know that j
I Captain Hank Luisetti is well on !
I his way to breaking (1) his own j
j Conference scoring record for one
I season, and (2) the national four
year total scoring record. And what
else, Hank alone knows.
Last year, the hoop wizard marked
up a new record of 208 points for
12 Conference games. That's an
average of 17 1/3 points per game.
So far this season, in five confer- !
ence tiles, Hoopin' Hank has grooved
the basket for 103 points, an average |
of 20 3, 5 per game. To save you !
time, it means that the Card cap- J
tain has to tank only 15 points in
each of the remaining seven Con- j
ference tilts just to tie his own i
record.
Nine Games To Go
As to the national scoring mark, I
] Mr. Luisetti is doing right well in !
that department, thank you. The j
record at which Mr. L. is shooting is '
j 1531 points for four years of play.
Toward that record Our Boy has !
| chalked up 1388 points to date. That i
; leaves 144 points for him to make ;
during the rest of this year. Thei'e j
are nine scheduled games yet to be
played. To top the record, Hank
i must average 16 points per game.
And those nine scheduled games !
; might lead to two or three more !
j playoff tilts, which would help just
I that much toward knocking over the
record.
