# Diving Champ Postpones Visit
## Pete Desjardines Held In Hawaii 
### 
The Duke "kidnapped" Pete Des
jardines last week, so a proposed
Farm visit by the one-time Stanford
student and Olympic diving cham
pion, conceded to be one of the
greatest springboard experts of all
time, has been indefinitely post
poned.
Desjardines was on his way to
director-general of swimming* activi
director general of swimming activi
ties, after an extended exhibition
tour, when he met Duke Kahano
moku, sheriff of Honolulu and him
self an all-time swimming great.
Desjardines and the Duke met
during their conquests of the swim
ming and diving worlds ten years
ago and the Duke apparently re
fused to permit his former Olympic
Games colleague to come back home
before they relived their conquests.
Coaches Nort Thornton and
Brandsten had hoped to have Pete
perform as an exhibition feature in
Encina Pools this week, possibly as
an added attraction at the inter
class swimming championships this
Friday. The long arm of the Hono
lulu law, however, has already
thwarted that plan.
Desjardines is now a professional
I star. He lost his amateur standing
! when he performed in a meet with
pro stars while he was still a simon
pure. v The A.A.U. quickly withdrew
his amateur ranking, but not before
he had thrilled the sporting world
as N.C.A.A. and Olympic champ.
Desjardines missed three years of
intercollegiate competition because
of his error. As a result he was
awarded a Block S as a freshman
and usually exhibited before or after
meets during his undergraduate
days.
