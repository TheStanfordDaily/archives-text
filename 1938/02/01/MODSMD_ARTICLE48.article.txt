# Frosh Remodel Attack For Fray With Cubs
## 
### 
| Realizing that special measures
will have to be taken if Stanford's
I frosh hoop team is to emerge vic
! torious over California Friday,
i Coach Wytze Gorter is remodeling
; his olTense for a surprise attack on
! the Cubs.
Gorter is satisfied with the way
| the squad performed last week-end,
j especially in handing Santa Rosa
I High its second defeat in the last
three years, but Cal's Cubs served
notice that they are going to be
tough when they trounced Sacra
mento High by an overwhelming
45-8 margin Saturday night.
No Common Opponent
This was only the Cubs' second
win in six games played but Coach
Bill Higgins' team has been handi
| capped by a long Christmas vaca
tion lay-off. There is no way to
j compare the two foes of this Friday
j night because neither has met a
| common opponent.
Star of the Cal team has been
i Freeman Dill, diminutive forward,
{ who is the high scorer of the squad.
According to reports from Berkeley,
! Dill lacks only height to become an
I outstanding player.
The rest of Cal's probable starting

line-up will be Jack Roger, forward
opposite Dill; Bell, center; Fay
Froome and Jack Cameron, guards.
Froome hails from Hollywood High
School, where he was an outstanding
center on the casaba team besides
starring in track.
Papooses in Fair Shape
The Papooses are in only fair
shape. Bill Masters is still out with
a bad case of the flu, while Don
Williams is having a hard time shak
ing off the effects of a cold. How
ever, unless Williams' condition takes
a turn for the worse, Stanford's
starting line-up will be the same as
has faced the tip-off in the last four
games.
Williams and Mike Marshall will
hold down the forward berths, with
Donnie Burness at center and Kenny
Davidson and Bill Niccolls, guards.
