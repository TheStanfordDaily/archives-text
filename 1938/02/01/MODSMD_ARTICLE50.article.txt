# interclass Swim Due Friday
## Juniors Favored Over Seniors, Frosh 
### 
The last opportunity this quarter
to watch the Stanford swimming
squad perform in Encina Pools will
be afforded this Friday afternoon
during the annual interclass com
petition.
All the remaining competition will
be either in Los near-by
peninsula towns.
A star-studded junior class is
favored to win the affair with such
artists as Roy Winkelmann, Dick
Clarke, Hal Weatherbe, Don Towne,
Win Needham, and others. Second
place is likely to develop into a
fight between the senior and fresh
man squads. The sophomores prob
ably won't offer much of a lineup.
The meet is open to lettermen as
well as others interested.
