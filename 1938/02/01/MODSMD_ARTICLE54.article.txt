JUST before the windows of the booth at the
B.A.C. slammed shut at 9:05 o'clock yester
day morning, disappointed ticket seekers
watched enviously as one man bought rights
to the last 32 seats for Friday's basketball game.
Then they dispersed, some of them to gripe
about the B.A.C. and the system, others to seek
buyers who had been lucky enough to corner
blocks of seats.
By afternoon, the griping was in full swing,
and the first evidence that the scalpers' custo
mers were ready for the shearing had appeared
on the Toyon bulletin board. It was a situa
tion.
Remedies for the situation are few and far
between. Obviously the Pavilion cannot be
enlarged before this California game or even
before the next one. Just as obviously, Graduate
Manager A1 Masters' figures show that 1000
tickets were sold and no more can be sold.
Only a change in the ticket sale system re
mains.
A suggestion ior such a change in the form
of a ruling that only one ticket be sold to each
person will come before Ex Committee tonight.
That the ruling would be only palliative is ap
parent; it was unpopular when in force several
years ago.
Yet there are a few points in favor of the
plan. It would stop the more virulent forms of
scalping. It would prevent the re-enactment of
the last scene of the B.A.C. tableau yesterday
morning; if a man was left standing he would
have only himself to blame. And there is some
precedent in the successful application of such
a ruling to football ticket sales. Possibly the
B.A.C. could see fit to hire more ticket sellers
to take care of the resulting longer lines.
Both single and block sale plans have been
unpopular because they didn't remedy the basic
faiilt —lack of room in the Pavilion. But the
suggestion before Ex Committee tonight is
slightly fairer, and it will stop wholesale scalp
ing. It seems the best way to play a bad deal.
