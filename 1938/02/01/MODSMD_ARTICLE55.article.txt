# The 						Tin Cup Again
## 
### 
ANOTHER attempt by the battered Angel
of Mercy to hold out its tin cup on the
campus will come before Ex Committee to
night, when the Far Eastern Student Emergency
Fund asks permission to make a drive at Stan
ford.
Sponsored by various Christian movements
and blessed by enough bishops to vote Satan
back into Heaven, the proposal shows an at
tractive face. But it has one or two unfortunate
characteristics that keep it from being the sort
of thing a university likes to have wandering
about loose on the campus.
The main object of the fund is to help stu
dents suffering from the war in China. Its
backers point out that Chinese colleges have
been bombed and their students forced to flee
to the interior. They declare that the fund will
be used to feed and clothe the students and
re-etsablish them at temporary universities out
of the war zone. Administration of the project
will be carried on by the Y.M.C.A. and assist
ance will be given impartially to Chinese and
Japanese students.
The motives of the campaign cannot be criti
cized; they could be incorporated directly into
a prayer book. But in application and long-run
effect the plan has aspects that upset even a
deep-seated faith in the blessedness of the
merciful.
Impartiality is a banner which the backers
wave persuasively. But the guestion arises as
to how impartial the Japanese will consider
the scheme. Of course, there will be no dis
crimination between students because of race.
But it is not hard to be impartial to Japanese
students when you can't find one without a
posse. There is a fair probability that the Japa
nese people would be shortsighted and feel that
helping the enemy was not the best way "to
increase understanding and community tran
scending all national barriers."
There is also the question of how impartial
the administration of the fund would be when
its backers put out literature referring to Japan's
action as "a rebellion against God's moral law."
Somehow that doesn't sound like the true ju
dicial spirit.
Another point that the campaigners fail to
stress is that the students are not the ones who
need help most. Even if we concede that aid
should be given in China, we cannot avoid the
fact that students are a small and fairly healthy
minority.
All in all, the campaign doesn't sound like

the best possible course for a country which
intends to do the greatest good and at the same
time stay out of a war that is strictly none of its
business.
Last quarter Ex Committee refused sanction
to the plan to raise funds for medical aid of
the Spanish loyalists. Perhaps tonight it will
demonstrate that after all its passion for prece
dents can be useful.â€”J. C.
