# BULL SESSION

### 
THE CORD COMPLEX
FRIEND Emery Bellwether, a philosopher if
there ever was one, has brought up an interesting
point. He was in to see me last night, looking rather
dusty and not a little disgusted.
"Well," I said. "Which war have you been through?"
He looked at me in scorn.
"You needn't try to be clever," he said. "It doesn't
become you. I've been sitting under the oak tree at
the English Corner smelling people's exhaust just like
Ferdinand."
"And it annoys you?"
"Intensely."
'And what do you think you can do about it?"
"Oh, nothing, of course. I go aiound in a daze,
under the mental impression that traditions which
died 10 years ago are still alive."
"But the lift-to Paly isn't dead."
"My good man, have you ever tried to get a ride?"
"Frequently."
"Have you ever gotten one?"
"Certainly."
'How long have you had to wait?"
"Well—" I said.
"I thought so," said Bellwether, pouncing. "A long
time, wasn't it?"
"Seldom more than an hour, Bellwether."
"An hour! Didn't it cut into your day?"
I was forced to admit that it had.
"And didn't you often want to poison the cowards
vvho turn left toward Ad Building?"
"Or"—chiming in with his mood—"right toward
Memorial Hall."
"Or right toward Memorial Hall."
"Well, yes, now that you mention it, 1 was rather
annoyed."
"You know what it is, don't you?"
"No, unless you mean plain orneriness."
"It's the Cord complex."
"The what?"
"The Cord complex."
* # * *
"Bellwether." I asked, "your mind fascinates me, and
I'm very willing to listen to your blather any other
time, but when I'm trying to write Bull Sess—"
"Aren't you interested in the Cord complex?"
"No."
"It'll revolutionize psychology. I can tell you. It's
already revolutionizing this campus. What is under
mining Stanford democracy? The Cord complex."
"Bellwether—" I said.
"No, listen. What kind of car always stops and
gives you a ride into Paly? It's generally a veteran,
isn't it, with things coming loose all over the place, and
a motor that was young 10 years ago. But it runs,
doesn't it, and it gets you there, and it's usually piloted
by a fairly nice type of person."
"Yes, that's true."
"And what kind of car passes you up like a bolt
from the blue?"
"Must I say it's a Cord?"
"No. because it isn't. But it's that type of car, isn't
it ? High class. Goes by so fast you can't see it.
Driver very snooty. Probably makes people take
off their shoes before entering. I tell you, it's ruining
Stanford democracy, the Cord complex is, at least in
sofar as it applies to the lift-to-Paly. And things will
get worse, mark my word. If mere possession of a
gold-plated buggy gives you the right to ignore your
fellow-students at the English Corner, I hate to think
what the future will be.
"Stanford democracy seems to be hitting a new low
when the only thing the winds of freedom blow is
dust in your face from somebody's back tires."
—Allen Drury.

FRIEND Emery Bellwether, a philosopher if
there ever was one, has brought up an interesting
point. He was in to see me last night, looking rather
dusty and not a little disgusted.
"Well," I said. "Which war have you been through?"
He looked at me in scorn.
"You needn't try to be clever," he said. "It doesn't
become you. I've been sitting under the oak tree at
the English Corner smelling people's exhaust just like
Ferdinand."
"And it annoys you?"
"Intensely."
'And what do you think you can do about it?"
"Oh, nothing, of course. I go aiound in a daze,
under the mental impression that traditions which
died 10 years ago are still alive."
"But the lift-to Paly isn't dead."
"My good man, have you ever tried to get a ride?"
"Frequently."
"Have you ever gotten one?"
"Certainly."
'How long have you had to wait?"
"Well—" I said.
"I thought so," said Bellwether, pouncing. "A long
time, wasn't it?"
"Seldom more than an hour, Bellwether."
"An hour! Didn't it cut into your day?"
I was forced to admit that it had.
"And didn't you often want to poison the cowards
vvho turn left toward Ad Building?"
"Or"—chiming in with his mood—"right toward
Memorial Hall."
"Or right toward Memorial Hall."
"Well, yes, now that you mention it, 1 was rather
annoyed."
"You know what it is, don't you?"
"No, unless you mean plain orneriness."
"It's the Cord complex."
"The what?"
"The Cord complex."
* # * *
"Bellwether." I asked, "your mind fascinates me, and
I'm very willing to listen to your blather any other
time, but when I'm trying to write Bull Sess—"
"Aren't you interested in the Cord complex?"
"No."
"It'll revolutionize psychology. I can tell you. It's
already revolutionizing this campus. What is under
mining Stanford democracy? The Cord complex."
"Bellwether—" I said.
"No, listen. What kind of car always stops and
gives you a ride into Paly? It's generally a veteran,
isn't it, with things coming loose all over the place, and
a motor that was young 10 years ago. But it runs,
doesn't it, and it gets you there, and it's usually piloted
by a fairly nice type of person."
"Yes, that's true."
"And what kind of car passes you up like a bolt
from the blue?"
"Must I say it's a Cord?"
"No. because it isn't. But it's that type of car, isn't
it ? High class. Goes by so fast you can't see it.
Driver very snooty. Probably makes people take
off their shoes before entering. I tell you, it's ruining
Stanford democracy, the Cord complex is, at least in
sofar as it applies to the lift-to-Paly. And things will
get worse, mark my word. If mere possession of a
gold-plated buggy gives you the right to ignore your
fellow-students at the English Corner, I hate to think
what the future will be.
"Stanford democracy seems to be hitting a new low
when the only thing the winds of freedom blow is
dust in your face from somebody's back tires."
—Allen Drury.
