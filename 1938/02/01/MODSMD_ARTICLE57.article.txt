T HE actors' profession never lias been one of sweet
ness and light. After developing themselves quite
a nice little sinecure under the wing of the Medieval
Church, the players were harried under the stern
frown of their aforetime protectoress, into the cold
world to shift for themselves.
This necessity to frequent the by-ways of the
world is perhaps contributory to the somewhat Bo
hemian atmosphere which surrounds the stage. It
also developed in the actors a skin innured to the
buffets of the braw blast, enabling them to put on
plays in the "opery" house of Hannibal. Mo., or other
quaint places. Further, it is probably entirely respons
ible for the ability to fulfill the "Act of God" clause
in theater contracts. A hardy crew, these players.
* * « *
Besides the necessity to guard themselves against
legal as well as moral persecution, the job of the actors
was made no easier by the playwright, if one may
judge from the sparse stage directions which Renais
sance authors appended to the script.
For instance, in Chris (he'll always be just Chris
to me) Marlowe's "Tamburlaine," two actors are called
upon to batter their brains out, right before everybody,
by dashing against the walls of a cage. That seems to
me to require a rather enormous amount of versatility.
Or, take the case of one of the actors in Kyd's
"Spanish Tragedy," who is led to the gallows, then,
before the amazed eyes of the audience, is kicked off,
and, apparently, left swinging. I'm not quite sure just
what exercises one would take to develop the neck in
order to qualify for the part at the casting office. Per
haps the best man for the job would be a talented
giraffe.

SkUCII was the lot of the predecessors of the hot
house creations which inhabit ihe modern stage.
It is about as disgusting a spectacle as I care to think
about (what with mid-terms and pneumonia germs),
to consider the Hollywood tribe, which have finally
degenerated to the use of stand-ins. Shades of David
Garrick! When the stand-ins begin to hire stand-ins
to save their complexions, we will refuse to see any
thing but Walt Disney creations. They won't have
stand-ins!
The only remnant of the good old days is that reck
less half-dozen in the movies, who double for the pre
cious stars when there is anything of a physical na
ture to be done, such as diving off the Empire State
building, balancing a tea-cup, or powdering one's nose.
But alas for times long gone. We'd give a pretty
to see a nice pair of brains, battered lo order before
our very i-ves. Stone.

This necessity to frequent the by-ways of the
world is perhaps contributory to the somewhat Bo
hemian atmosphere which surrounds the stage. It
also developed in the actors a skin innured to the
buffets of the braw blast, enabling them to put on
plays in the "opery" house of Hannibal. Mo., or other
quaint places. Further, it is probably entirely respons
ible for the ability to fulfill the "Act of God" clause
in theater contracts. A hardy crew, these players.

Besides the necessity to guard themselves against
legal as well as moral persecution, the job of the actors
was made no easier by the playwright, if one may
judge from the sparse stage directions which Renais
sance authors appended to the script.
For instance, in Chris (he'll always be just Chris
to me) Marlowe's "Tamburlaine," two actors are called
upon to batter their brains out, right before everybody,
by dashing against the walls of a cage. That seems to
me to require a rather enormous amount of versatility.
Or, take the case of one of the actors in Kyd's
"Spanish Tragedy," who is led to the gallows, then,
before the amazed eyes of the audience, is kicked off,
and, apparently, left swinging. I'm not quite sure just
what exercises one would take to develop the neck in
order to qualify for the part at the casting office. Per
haps the best man for the job would be a talented
giraffe.

SkUCII was the lot of the predecessors of the hot
house creations which inhabit ihe modern stage.
It is about as disgusting a spectacle as I care to think
about (what with mid-terms and pneumonia germs),
to consider the Hollywood tribe, which have finally
degenerated to the use of stand-ins. Shades of David
Garrick! When the stand-ins begin to hire stand-ins
to save their complexions, we will refuse to see any
thing but Walt Disney creations. They won't have
stand-ins!
The only remnant of the good old days is that reck
less half-dozen in the movies, who double for the pre
cious stars when there is anything of a physical na
ture to be done, such as diving off the Empire State
building, balancing a tea-cup, or powdering one's nose.
But alas for times long gone. We'd give a pretty
to see a nice pair of brains, battered lo order before
our very i-ves. Stone.
T HE actors' profession never lias been one of sweet
ness and light. After developing themselves quite
a nice little sinecure under the wing of the Medieval
Church, the players were harried under the stern
frown of their aforetime protectoress, into the cold
world to shift for themselves.
