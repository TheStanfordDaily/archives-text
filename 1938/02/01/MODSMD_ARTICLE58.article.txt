The Editor, Sir:
With regard- to your editorial of
Thursday, Jan. 27, entitled "Me
morial Hall—New Toy to Fight For,"
I feel it only fair to all parties con
cerned to inform you that it was
based upon an error of fact.
You advocated that "For succeed
ing quarters there must be a joint
calendar drawn, carefully and co
operatively planned to give student
producers and casts what they can
expect from a plant built, and still
being paid for.' by themselves."
Which was to infer that such a sys
tem was not now existent. But that
is exactly what was done at the end
of last quarter with regard to both
Stagers and Dept. of Speech and
Drama programs for the current
quarter. The program of dates as
they now exist was not considered
binding until unconditionally agreed
to by both Stagers and the Depart
ment. No one was "cowed" or dic
tated to. From my point of view
splendid co-operation exists.
I make this correction knowing
that you do not sanction opinions
formulated upon incorrect facts.
