The Editor, Sir:
"Inefficiency plus," rather than be
adopted as motto of the periodical
room of the deserves-to-be-es
teemed library, might more appro
priately be used to characterize the
average Stanford student's ability to
discover tools thoughtfully provided
for his use, without the way being
paved with large red arrows, and
an "X" to mark the spot.
May I take it upon myself as a
graduate student who is also a li
brarian, the responsibility of calling
to the attention of Mr. Wright, as
well as others so concerned about
"highly lauded principles of busi
ness efficiency," that almost every
student who rushes to the desk of
the librarian to ask his question,
however ane or inane it may be,
leans his hands on a bound copy of
"List of Magazines Filed in the Al
coves of the Periodical Room;" be
side it, if he deigned to look, resides
"List of Magazines in the Education
Library;" on the bulletin board—
so close to the door that I'm sur
prised Mr. Wright has not fallen
over it—is posted a list of "Bound
Magazines Filed on the Open
Shelves in the Periodical Room."
Our plaint may, with justification,
now read: The directors of the
policies of Stanford know not what
they do; the students do not what
they know. • Crystelle Clark.
