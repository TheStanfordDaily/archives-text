# Ballet Russe Described As 'Enjoyable'
## 
### 
The Ballet Russe in San Francisco
Sunday afternoon presented the
representative and highly enjoyable
program of "Les Cent Baisers,"
"Symphonie Fantastique," and "Le
Beau Danube." The performance
at the War Memorial Opera house
was well received by the audience,
which was very appreciative of
Irina Baronova, Leonide Massine,
and David Lichine, stars of the
company.
"Les Cent Baisers," a true ballet
for which the music is written, tells
the story of a "princess fey and ca
pricious," Baronova, who mocks her
suitor, Lichine. The story has no
moral, not too much of a plot, good
dancing, but not on the whole the
best part of the afternoon's enter
tainment.
Most impressive, as well as ex
pressive, was "Symphonie Fantas
tique," an interpretation of music
by Berlioz. Choreography was by
Leonide Massine, who took the main
part in the presentation of the
dreams of a young musician who has
poisoned himself with bottled
opium. Most effective part was the
procession to the stake, after he has
dreamed of murdering his beloved.
Here the jailor, Belsky, played a
prominent part.
"Le Beau Danube" was a charac
ter ballet, with music chosen from
various Strauss waltzes. Choreog
raphy was again by Massine who,
with Baronova, again held the major
parts. 1 enjoyed this ballet more
than the others, probably because
of its simplicity, beauty, and the
dance to the strains of the "Blue
Danube."â€”Alward.
