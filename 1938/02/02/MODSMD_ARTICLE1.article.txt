# Peace Dove Again Hovers Over Farm
## A.S.S.U. Committee Decides To Call All-Campus Meeting 
### 
Stanford's veteran Peace Dove,
bedraggled by three previous en
gagements here, hovered over the
Farm yesterday afternoon while
student peace-advocates met in the
Women's Clubhouse and debated
plans for this year's celebration on
April 22.
In an effort to meet criticism of
other years that Peace Day "has
not been representative of all the
campus," the A.S.S.U. committee
decided yesterday to establish a
permanent advisory council com
posed of representatives of all Stan
ford living groups.
The purpose of this council, which
will have its first 'meeting next
Tuesday afternoon at 4 o'clock, will
be to suggest names for speakers to
the committee and to advise it in
its other decisions, Dan McComish,
Political Science* major and tem
porary committee chairman, de
clared.
Marcus Absent
McComish is directing local peace
activities during the absence of Ger
ald Marcus, permanent chairman,
who is out of school this quarter for
an Eastern debate tour.
Representation at next Tuesday's
meeting will be upon the basis of
one delegate from each sorority and
fraternity and each Lagunita easa
and Union unit, two delegates from
both Roble and Encina, the chairman
said.
Although the delegates, to be
named by living group presidents,
will not be voting members of the
A.S.S.U. Peace Committee, Mc-
Comish emphasized that "the dele
gates will be able to represent all
University opinion on policies for
Peace Day."
To Choose Speaker
Final choice of speakers for the
assembly, based upon recommenda
tions submitted at next week's com
mittee meeting and subject to the
approval of the University Commit
tee on Public Exercises, will prob
ably be made by the end of this
month, McComish indicated yester
day.
"The committee believes that the
main speaker should outline a def
inite program whereby students car
work for peace," he said.
At the same time, McComish ex
pects that the assembly speakers
should present different points ol
view on subjects that will be con
sidered in greater detail during the
Peace Day round tables.
Proposals that California anc
Stanford should exchange speakers
probably debaters, for their assem
blies were informally vetoed al
yesterday's meeting, with the com
mittee members feeling that "t
prominent main speaker will be
necessary in order to assure studeni
attendance."
Plan Open Forum
As preparation for the April 22
assembly, the committee decided tc
sponsor an open forum meeting latei
this month in which student speak
ers will present conflicting views or
such issues as the Neutrality Aci
and the Ludlow Amendment. Date
for this meeting has not been set.
Also, it was announced that the
Stanford Dames will sponsor a stu
dent essay contest, closing two week;
before Peace Day, on "What student:
are doing to promote peace."
In addition to Marcus and Mc-
Comish, members of the A.S.S.U.-
sponsored Peace Committee an
Beth Allen, Mary Beaton, Jackit
Brown, Bob Garretson. Bob Living
stone, Ed Kerr. Bob Hartman, Dor
Crawford, and Buddy Iwata.
