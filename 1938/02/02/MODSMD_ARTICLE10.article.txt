# Reading Offers 'Space Staging'
## New Method Used In 'Five Star Final' 
### 
J. P. Cahn, director of Stagers'
j reading of "Five-Star Final," is us-
I ing for the first time tonight a sys
! tem which he terms "space staging."
Cahn explained that to keep the
i tempo of a modern newspaper office,
I he has seated the readers at three
I tables instead of the customary one.
! Short scenes will be read from two
small tables placed in front of the
main curtain, while the longer
scenes are read from the main table.
This system, Cahn explained, fa
cilitates in speeding the reading by
swift exchange of dialogue from po
sition to position, thus giving the
audience a feeling of rapid action.
Louis Wietzenkorn's "Five-Star
I Final" is the last of a series of
i Stagers' readings this quarter ap
i pealing to campus demand for
1 Broadway successes. These plays
[ are available for readings but are not
available for amateur production.
The cast includes Pete Simmons,
Shirley Jones, Quentin Warren. Bar
j bara Thrasher, Curt Barnes, Don
Cady, and Onyet Watson.
The reading begins at 8 o'clock in
the Little Theater. Admission is 15
j cents.
