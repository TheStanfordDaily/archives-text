# Slow Music Promised For Junior Prom
## Fast Tunes Limited To One Out Of Five 
### 
. . and the party of the second
part hereby agrees to maintain a
ratio of only one fast number in
each five played."
Afraid that attendance to the
Junior Prom would suffer because
students would refuse to attend a
dance where all the music would be
fast, the junior class had a clause
inserted in its contract with Fletcher
Henderson which would definitely
give them the desired amount of
danceable tempos.
As for the "Big Appiers," Mr.
Henderson has promised to give
over some whole dance groups to
them.
Mr. Henderson has been a favor
ite of dancers for many years. With
the recent emphasis on swing music
his band has steadily maintained one
of the leading positions in dance
popularity polls conducted by East
ern colleges.
At his recent stay at the Grand
Terrace Cafe in Chicago, Mr. Hen
derson was inspiration for the musi
cal development of musicians like
"Chu Berry," "Buck" Baily, and
Roy Eldridge. At present Bailey is
the clarinet that is heard on the
Maxine Sullivan records.
The Prom, under the new chair
manship of Andy Shirey, will be
I held on Feb. 11; dress will be semi-
I formal; and bids $3.
