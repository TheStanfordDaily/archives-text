WASHINGTON. Feb. 1 (UP).—
Two hundred students broke up the
regimental ball of the Roosevelt
High School Cadets last night with
a sit-down strike against waltzes.
The couples—young men in full
dress regimental uniforms, the girls
in dainty evening dresses—sat on
the floor for 15 minutes until the
orchestra played "snappier num
bers." Orchestra Leader Jimmy
Gantley said that the faculty chap
erone had requested that he play
waltzes and "stay away from the
hotter music."
