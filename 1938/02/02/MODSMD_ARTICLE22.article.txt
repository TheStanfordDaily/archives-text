# Vote Proposes Holiday Switch
## Wilbur To Act On Four-Day Vacation 
### 
George Washington may have his
birthday on the 21st this year.
Ex Committee last night voted to
ask the University administration to
shift the holiday to Monday, chief
reason being that women want the
extra day to follow their week-end,
but stand little chance of getting
Monday overnights.
If anyone wants a four-day vaca
tion, Tuesday's classes can be cut
as easily as Monday's, was the con
census. "A few profs would be glad
to let off their Tuesday classes," said
Betty Hellyer, "but some would
probably spring exes, and they'd
have a right to."
Petition Suggested
A petition to President Wilbur
was suggested, but Ex Committee
considered its recommendation suf
ficient.
The motion was passed unani
mously, despite Jim McCormick's
warning to "go slow—we were too
hasty when we recognized skiing as
a minor sport."
After denying any Ex Committee
back-stepping' in the skiing situa
tion, President Tom Killefer moved
on to election board appointments.
He named Chuck Russell to replace
Henry Beecher and Jeane Hauser to
replace Gretchen Ahlswede. New
assistants are Pete Whittlesey, Sue
Sistrom, and Norma Watkins.
'Incident' Avoided
Another international "incident"
was avoided as members decided a
request for funds to aid students in
Chinese war zones was humanitar
ian but possibly partisan.
"I move," recommended Phil
Klauber, "that Ex Committee not
grant A.S.S.U. funds to the move
ment for diplomatic reasons, al
though recognizing the humanitarian
aspects of the drive."
Agreeing with the motion, Jim
McCormick observed that "the Con
valescent Home and Buck-of-the-
Month Club are enough already."
Appropriation Voted
The committee voted another
j $8000 co Memorial Hall construction,
|to pay for a 10-foot, arc-lighted
| walk clear around. This action was
I thought wise when Kiliefer re
i minded them that "someone clipped
! oil one of the Salzburg musicians
| and he's still in the hospital."
Agreeing that the Olympic Games
movies last week were "lousy,"
members authorized Student Man
ager Chuck Fontius to ignore the
promoter's pleas for more funds if
[ he keeps coming around.
To Entertain Women
When 300 Stephens College wom
| en visit Stanford March 10, they will
I be entertained at a luncheon, it was
| decided, since it will be too close to
i final examinations for a dance. Will
j ing to pay for a dance, they may
| provide money for the luncheon, it
! was thought.
Other business included approving
i a new and smaller Stanford ring,
I authorizing purchase of 14 new
typewriters for The Daily, appro
priating an indefinite amount for
cider and doughnuts at Thursday's
student-faculty bull session, and
approving Boyd White's report of
$158.30 cleared at the President's
Birthday Jolly-up.
Dates granted: A.K.L., Feb. 18;
Women's Conference and Chaparral,
March 1; Chi O, March 5; and Theta
Delt, March 5.

cider and doughnuts at Thursday's
student-faculty bull session, and
approving Boyd White's report of
$158.30 cleared at the President's
Birthday Jolly-up.
Dates granted: A.K.L., Feb. 18;
Women's Conference and Chaparral,
March 1; Chi O, March 5; and Theta
Delt, March 5.
George Washington may have his
birthday on the 21st this year.
Ex Committee last night voted to
ask the University administration to
shift the holiday to Monday, chief
reason being that women want the
extra day to follow their week-end,
but stand little chance of getting
Monday overnights.
If anyone wants a four-day vaca
tion, Tuesday's classes can be cut
as easily as Monday's, was the con
census. "A few profs would be glad
to let off their Tuesday classes," said
Betty Hellyer, "but some would
probably spring exes, and they'd
have a right to."
Petition Suggested
A petition to President Wilbur
was suggested, but Ex Committee
considered its recommendation suf
ficient.
The motion was passed unani
mously, despite Jim McCormick's
warning to "go slow—we were too
hasty when we recognized skiing as
a minor sport."
After denying any Ex Committee
back-stepping' in the skiing situa
tion, President Tom Killefer moved
on to election board appointments.
He named Chuck Russell to replace
Henry Beecher and Jeane Hauser to
replace Gretchen Ahlswede. New
assistants are Pete Whittlesey, Sue
Sistrom, and Norma Watkins.
'Incident' Avoided
Another international "incident"
was avoided as members decided a
request for funds to aid students in
Chinese war zones was humanitar
ian but possibly partisan.
"I move," recommended Phil
Klauber, "that Ex Committee not
grant A.S.S.U. funds to the move
ment for diplomatic reasons, al
though recognizing the humanitarian
aspects of the drive."
Agreeing with the motion, Jim
McCormick observed that "the Con
valescent Home and Buck-of-the-
Month Club are enough already."
Appropriation Voted
The committee voted another
j $8000 co Memorial Hall construction,
|to pay for a 10-foot, arc-lighted
| walk clear around. This action was
I thought wise when Kiliefer re
i minded them that "someone clipped
! oil one of the Salzburg musicians
| and he's still in the hospital."
Agreeing that the Olympic Games
movies last week were "lousy,"
members authorized Student Man
ager Chuck Fontius to ignore the
promoter's pleas for more funds if
[ he keeps coming around.
To Entertain Women
When 300 Stephens College wom
| en visit Stanford March 10, they will
I be entertained at a luncheon, it was
| decided, since it will be too close to
i final examinations for a dance. Will
j ing to pay for a dance, they may
| provide money for the luncheon, it
! was thought.
Other business included approving
i a new and smaller Stanford ring,
I authorizing purchase of 14 new
typewriters for The Daily, appro
priating an indefinite amount for
cider and doughnuts at Thursday's
student-faculty bull session, and
approving Boyd White's report of
$158.30 cleared at the President's
