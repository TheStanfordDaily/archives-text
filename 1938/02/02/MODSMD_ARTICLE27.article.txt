# Excom Favors Limit On Tickets
## Group Urges B.A.C. To Allow Only Two Cal Game Ducats Per Student 
### 
Ex Committee Inst night voted to recommcnd to the Board of AlMetic
Control that ticket sales for Cal basketball games, and "other games, to he
designated at the discretion of the H.A.C.," be limited to two per person.
The return to the system of sales abandoned several years ago will
prevent re-occurrence of the situation where, according to Tom Kille-

ter, me secona man in line at :*:u:>
o'clock Monday "thought he was in
the pear tree, with 32 tickets yet to
be sold, only to have the window
closed on his nose."
Might Prevent Scalping
With latest quotations on a pair of
tickets reported to be $6. Ex Com
mittee felt that the system would
do much to wipe out scalping in
preventing block buying. It was
agreed that no arrangements could
be made which would satisfy every
one, that no staggering of sales times
could prevent some students from
being placed at a disadvantage in
securing tickets.
In a "six of one, half dozen of
another" situation, Ex Committee
decided that the fairest solution
would be to reinstall a "stand on
your own feet" system.
Ski Club Loses
Renewing the struggle for minor
sport recognition, Ski Club members
gave Ex Comm i 11 e e "another
chance" by asking that the question
be put on next week's ballot for a
student body vote. Faced with the
ticklish problem of saving a face
which Killefer declared to be still
intact, Ex Committee finally decid
ed to stick by its guns, refusing to
place the question on the ballot.
According to Killefer, Ski Club
members intend to carry on the at
tack by circulating a petition, which,
if signed by 150 student body
members, will automatically force a
vote on the problem.
Explains Stand
In explaining Ex Committee's
stand on the subject, Killefer said
that the body had approved the rec
ognition of skiing as a minor sport
only on the condition that it was
further approved by the Physical
Education Department. When Harry
Maloney, director of minor spoils',
presented the objections of the de
partment to such a move, Ex Com
mittee made its final, and only, de
cision on the matter — to refuse
recognition.
That Ex Committee itself was not
sure that its slate was clean in the
eyes of the campus was shown by
Jim McCormick's comment that un
less they stuck by their decision of a
week ago, they would appear
"wishy-washy."
What will happen should the stu
dent body vote to recognize skiing
as a minor sport was apparently a
matter of some doubt. As Jack
Calderwood said, "We'll let the mat
ter drop for now, and spend the next
week reading the constitution."

tack by circulating a petition, which,
if signed by 150 student body
members, will automatically force a
vote on the problem.
Explains Stand
In explaining Ex Committee's
stand on the subject, Killefer said
that the body had approved the rec
ognition of skiing as a minor sport
only on the condition that it was
further approved by the Physical
Education Department. When Harry
Maloney, director of minor spoils',
presented the objections of the de
partment to such a move, Ex Com
mittee made its final, and only, de
cision on the matter — to refuse
recognition.
That Ex Committee itself was not
sure that its slate was clean in the
eyes of the campus was shown by
Jim McCormick's comment that un
less they stuck by their decision of a
week ago, they would appear
"wishy-washy."
What will happen should the stu
dent body vote to recognize skiing
as a minor sport was apparently a
matter of some doubt. As Jack
Calderwood said, "We'll let the mat
ter drop for now, and spend the next
week reading the constitution."
Ex Committee Inst night voted to recommcnd to the Board of AlMetic
Control that ticket sales for Cal basketball games, and "other games, to he
designated at the discretion of the H.A.C.," be limited to two per person.
The return to the system of sales abandoned several years ago will
prevent re-occurrence of the situation where, according to Tom Kille-

ter, me secona man in line at :*:u:>
o'clock Monday "thought he was in
the pear tree, with 32 tickets yet to
be sold, only to have the window
closed on his nose."
Might Prevent Scalping
With latest quotations on a pair of
tickets reported to be $6. Ex Com
mittee felt that the system would
do much to wipe out scalping in
preventing block buying. It was
agreed that no arrangements could
be made which would satisfy every
one, that no staggering of sales times
could prevent some students from
being placed at a disadvantage in
securing tickets.
In a "six of one, half dozen of
another" situation, Ex Committee
decided that the fairest solution
would be to reinstall a "stand on
your own feet" system.
Ski Club Loses
Renewing the struggle for minor
sport recognition, Ski Club members
gave Ex Comm i 11 e e "another
chance" by asking that the question
be put on next week's ballot for a
student body vote. Faced with the
ticklish problem of saving a face
which Killefer declared to be still
intact, Ex Committee finally decid
ed to stick by its guns, refusing to
place the question on the ballot.
According to Killefer, Ski Club
members intend to carry on the at
tack by circulating a petition, which,
if signed by 150 student body
members, will automatically force a
vote on the problem.
