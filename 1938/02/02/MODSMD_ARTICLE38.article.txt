j partment of Speech and Drama an-
I nounced yesterday.
"Caleb Stone's Death Watch," by
I Martin Flavin, Broadway dramatist
i and acting professor of playwriting;
I and "The Nursery Maid of Heaven,"
| by Thomas Wood Stevens, Stanford
| director, will share a program set
| for February 24, 25, and 26.
According to H. Miles Heberer,
| director of the Flavin play, both
! the plays can be bracketed in the
| same category.
Director Heberer cited the chief
j reason for the choice as being "to
I entertain the Stanford student body
| after that big furor they raised over
| "The Governor's Wife."
"Caleb Stone's Death Watch"
deals with an old man who fails to
crash the gates of St. Peter when
| enemies in heaven blackball his en
trance. Stevens' play tells of a young
I nun and her spiritual trials.
