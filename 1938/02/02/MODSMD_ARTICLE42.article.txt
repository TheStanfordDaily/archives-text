TAKE IT EASY
ON THE SMOKING
People are always griping about
something, and The Daily has al
ways been known as one of the
campus' little leaders in matters of
trying to change things.
In line with the traditional Daily
policy of attacking windmills more
for the purpose of creating a stir
than anything else. Slants is going
to take a whack at the Pavilion.
This idea of taking the backs off
the Pav seats should help the
cramped-knee situation no end, but
taking the backs off isn't going to
make it easier to get out of that
fire-trap if somebody makes a mis
take with a match some night.
Can't you see people getting
trampled into a fine state of squish,
if some thoughtless maniac yelled
"Fire!" and started for the nearest
door?
The B.A.C. is walking around with
its fingers crossed, figuratively
speaking, for fear of a fire in that
match-box some one of these bas
ketball games. If there is one it's
liable to be a major catastrophe. But
don't let this keep you away from
ihe basketball game Friday night, or
anything like that.
Well, Pancho, I guess we took that
windmill, eh?
BLACKJACK WEIERSIIAUSER
COMES INTO HIS OWN
Stockton is mighty proud of Jack
Weiershauser, its home town boy
who made good as a Stanford
sprinter and hurdler last spring, and
recently was named the best Ameri
can at 200 meters during 1937 by
the A.A.U.
The Stocktonites gave a little
blowout for Jack Monday night,
naming him Stockton's "athlete of
the year" and presenting him with
a little token in recognition of that
title. It's always good to hear of
that soil of thing, especially when
it happens to a solid guy like Weier
shauser.
ROAMING
AROUND
Hilmer Lodge, graduate in journ
alism of last June and probably the
staunchest supporter Stanford track
teams ever had, has got himself
lined up with his first love, a track
coaching job. Recently named to re
place Tex Bvrd as San Mateo Jun
ior College mentor, old Hodge-Podge
is looking forward to a pretty good
season—he has a good lad here and
a good lad there, and when he adds
it all up il looks like a tidy sum to
him.
Ray Malott, track captain and
A.A.U. 400 meters champ, will go to
the A.A.U. National Indoor Champ
ionships in New York Feb. 2(5 if he
gets an entry blank. That's the only
thing holding him back. A couple of
letters from Dan Ferris, secretary
treasurer of the A.A.U., have fixed
things up, but Ray hasn't x'eceived
the entry slip yet. If he goes he'll
have to run 600 meters, for that's
the only race in the meet between
65 and 1000 meters that approximated
Ray's distance.
Bill McCurdy, last year's oval
captain, and Tige Alexander, his pal
and star miler, are still trying to
keep in condition. They live to
gether in San Francisco, and every
chance they get they put on the old
track outfits—sweat pants and all—
and take a turn from their place on
Leavenworth Street out over the
Golden Gate Bridge and back. That's
a good walk, let alone run. And
they howl because they're tired
when they get back. Terrible con
dition, terrible.—Peterson.
