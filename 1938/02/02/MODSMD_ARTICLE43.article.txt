## 
### 
Taking advantage of a break from
ihe weatherman, Stanford's rugby
squad went through a hard workout
yesterday afternoon in preparation
for its game with U.C.L.A. Saturday
in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
The Bruin contest, which will
open the Pacific Coast Conference
rugby season, is expected to be
Stanford's hardest game thus far
and may prove its toughest en
counter all season. U.C.L.A. has
the same team this year which last
season lost one game, a 6-5 decision
to the Indians and which finished
second to Jim Wylie's men in the
P.C.C. race.
In view of that fact, Wylie put his
men through a brisk workout yester
day in their first formal practice
since Thursday. Doc Luckett, goal
kicking specialist, is suffering from
a shoulder injury, which is expected
to keep him out of play for three
weeks. Otherwise the squad ap
peared in good physical shape as it
opened preparations for the Bruin
same.
