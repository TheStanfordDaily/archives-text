## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 1 (UP).â€”Tom
my Farr, British heavyweight cham
pion who lost a close decision to
Jim Braddock 10 days ago, flatly re
jected tonight Promoter Mike Ja
cobs' offer for a fight with Maxie
Baer.
"Why should I help to re-estab
lish Baer as a contender?" Farr
asked. "I've beaten him once, and
the agreement 1 had with Jacob?
specified that the winner of my fight
with Braddock was to fight Baer. I
was not the winner, and despite
Braddock's retirement, I don't think
I'm obligated to fiuht Baer."
