# Varsity Quintet Will Forego Scrimmage
## Cards Hold Short, Fast Break Drill Golden Bears Also Take Things Easy, Work On Long Shots 
### HARRY PRESS 
Short, fast workouts â€” that's Dr.
John Bunn's prescription for his
Laughing Boys for the week.
Going over everything, stressing
fast breaks, the Card varsity will not
scrimmage at all this week, saving
its scrimmage-of-the-week for the
game with Cal Friday night.
Main feature of yesterday's work
out wits the usual half-hour warm
up before getting down to work.
During that time. Dr. John matched
shot for shot with Art Stoefen, each
taking five shots from different an
gles, 30 feet out. The number of
missed baskets could be counted on
the lingers of a handless man.
Winkleman 'Talks'
Also working out was Assistant
Coach Ben Winkleman, trying to
find the basket down at the end of
the Pavilion. Between every swisher
(live minutes or so), Texas Ben
came through with some lucidating
statements in regard to basketball.
After revealing the heretofore un
known fact that basketball first be
gan when men threw the ball
through peach-basket hoops, Mr. W.
mumbled his early choice for an all
southern division team.
He refused to grant publication
rights at this early date, however,
and intimated that in the very near
future he will bring forth some more
new facts regarding basketball.
We will let you know.
Bears Rest Easily
Meanwhile, the Californians seem
to be resting easily in their lair at
Berkeley. Nibs Price, who has been
developing an ever-changing de
fense in recent days, also has been
giving his league-leaders a rest.
The reserves (they were helped
by most of the varsity) played a
team made up of former Cal bas
ketballers, and came out on the
short end of a 55-54 count.
The Bears, however, have prac
ticed a little, brave fellows, mostly
on long shots. Evidently Coach Price
is anticipating an air-tight Stanford
defense Friday night. And that is
exactly what he will get, if the
Laughing Boys close' the valve on
the basket, as they did last week
against U.C.L.A.
