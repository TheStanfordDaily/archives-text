## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Seniors Find Back Stroker Juniors Favored In Swimming Meet 
### 
Nort Thornton has discovered a
back-stroke swimmer who can ap
proach the times turned in by Fresh
man Bill Weeden, local record holder
in both the 100 and 150-yard upside
down events.
He is A1 Letteau, the forgotten
senior whom Thornton hadn't
thought much about until yester
day. Letteau has done 1:05.6 in the
100-yards which almost equals the
old record of 1:05.4 and may make
Weeden race to another new record
in the 150-yard i'nterelass champion
ships Friday afternoon if he expects
to win.
While the powerful junior squad
seems to have the Friday meet won
already, both frosh and senior swim
mers are juggling men in an attempt
to upset the third-year men.
However, the seniors lost a first
place man when Jack Vibert found
he would be unable to compete in
at least half of the meet. Conflict
ing appointments elsewhere will
prevent his appearance in the med
ley relay and possibly in the 100-
yard free-style. Vibert holds the
pool record of 54.8 in that event.
The yearlings plan to rely on Coy
Vitousek, Chuck Wiper, Weeden,
and one other entry to bring them
10 points in the free style relay. A
lack of depth will probably keep
them from gaining top meet honors.
