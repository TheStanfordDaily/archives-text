# Cubs Are Even Bet To Whip Card Frosh
## 
### 
With a team composed of poten
tially brilliant players, Cal's Bear
cubs present a rapidly improving
aggregation that figures to be no
less than an even choice against
Stanford's Papooses come Friday
night.
Breaking a losing streak of four
straight games with an impressive
45-8 victory over Sacramento High
last Saturday, the Cubs showed that
they have a team to be feared. The
chief handicap for Coach Bill Hig
gins' team was Berkeley's long
Christmas vacation, which found
the team returning badly out of
shape.
Darian, Dill Star
The individual stars of the Cal
frosh are A1 Darian, a guard, and
Freeman Dill, sharp-shooting for
ward. Darian, prep school star from
Poli High in San Francisco, just en
tered Cal this semester and is slowly
catching onto the system. Dill has
been the scoring star in every game
to date and is the man to be watched
if Coach Wytze Gorter's team is to
stop the Cubs.
Behind the two stars is a good ag
gregation of players, especially
strong on defense. Fay Froom,
rangy center, is the man who will

be called upon to stop Don Bur
ness and, if the feat can be achieved,
Cal figures Froom is the man to
do it.
Another Pillar
Another defensive pillar is Carl
Olson, a tall, hard-driving guard,
while A1 Cameron, another guard, is
slowly coming into his own as a
defensive ace.
Offensive threats are Jack Rog
ers, first-string forward; Art Flegal,
an experienced and active front
line man; and Henry Steinback, a
dead-eye guard.
Friday night's competitors have
met but one common foe, Lowell
High, and each finished on the
wrong end of the score against the
preps, Cal losing by one point and
Stanford by two. However, the In
dian line-up has been changed con
siderably since the defeat by Lowell
and players that were first-string
then are having a hard time to get
in the ball game now.
While pointing for Cal, Gorier
isn't forgetting that the yearlings
engage a rugged frosh quintet from
U.S.F. Saturday night.

catching onto the system. Dill has
been the scoring star in every game
to date and is the man to be watched
if Coach Wytze Gorter's team is to
stop the Cubs.
Behind the two stars is a good ag
gregation of players, especially
strong on defense. Fay Froom,
rangy center, is the man who will

be called upon to stop Don Bur
ness and, if the feat can be achieved,
Cal figures Froom is the man to
do it.
Another Pillar
Another defensive pillar is Carl
Olson, a tall, hard-driving guard,
while A1 Cameron, another guard, is
slowly coming into his own as a
defensive ace.
Offensive threats are Jack Rog
ers, first-string forward; Art Flegal,
an experienced and active front
line man; and Henry Steinback, a
dead-eye guard.
Friday night's competitors have
met but one common foe, Lowell
High, and each finished on the
wrong end of the score against the
preps, Cal losing by one point and
Stanford by two. However, the In
dian line-up has been changed con
siderably since the defeat by Lowell
and players that were first-string
then are having a hard time to get
in the ball game now.
While pointing for Cal, Gorier
isn't forgetting that the yearlings
engage a rugged frosh quintet from
U.S.F. Saturday night.
