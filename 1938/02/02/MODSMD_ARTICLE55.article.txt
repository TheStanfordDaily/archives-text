# Passing the Book
## 
### 
SOME weeks ago a very uncertain student
was assigned a term paper and decided
that a little background material on folk-lore
might ultimately reflect itself in the Bawlout.
He plunged into the never-never land of the
library card index, emerged after half an hour
of first-rate exploring work, and called for a
standard work on folk-lore.
The attendant at the desk informed him that
it was out, and would continue to be out for
some time, because a professor in the Spanish
department had cornered the market in folk
lore books two years before. The student went
home to make up his own folk-lore about pro
fessors v/ho take books out of the library and
refuse to return them.
According to various reports which trickle
out of the tiered fastnesses behind the circula
tion desk, this thumbnail tragedy is a common
one. Faculty members have the privilege of
hunting in the posted preserves of the stacks,
and may carry out any game they reduce to
hand. A professor may take out any books he
wishes, and may keep them as long as he
likes. Members of the library forest service
report that unless we find a good conserva
tion measure the stacks are going to take on a
Lady Godiva look very shortly.
One former assistant estimates that 25,000
books are now being hoarded by faculty mem
bers. A fair proportion of these are concerned
with the private life of the mollusc, or with the
sex habits of the pterodactyl; and have no
interest for students. But it is common to see an
undergraduate leave the desk saying things he
didn't learn from Victorian novels, because
some professor has cornered the book he
wants.
One faculty member had about 1200 books
out, according to the latest guotation. Doubt
less he is doing great research. But it takes a
good imagination to picture his using all 1200
at once.
And a special investigator would probably
declare an extra dividend when he heard of the
professor who wrote a book, assigned it to
his class, and then checked all six copies out
indefinitely.
The library is a little depressed about the
situation. If a student calls for a book that is
incarcerated in a professor's office, the library
sends a pleading little post card. When this is
ignored it enters the name on a slip, and settles
down to brood over its lost children.
The futility of it all depresses it too. A pro
fessor emeritus still has a volume he checked
out in January, 1907. The assistants are consid
ering asking him to leave it to them in his will.
Of course, Stanford has enough books to
keep the stacks in use in spite of the wander
ing volumes that never come back. But cynics
are beginning to suggest that if the drain keeps
up we will have to make the professors install
card catalogues for their borrowed books. Then
we could remodel the library and use it for
basketball.—J. C.

fessors v/ho take books out of the library and
refuse to return them.
According to various reports which trickle
out of the tiered fastnesses behind the circula
tion desk, this thumbnail tragedy is a common
one. Faculty members have the privilege of
hunting in the posted preserves of the stacks,
and may carry out any game they reduce to
hand. A professor may take out any books he
wishes, and may keep them as long as he
likes. Members of the library forest service
report that unless we find a good conserva
tion measure the stacks are going to take on a
Lady Godiva look very shortly.
One former assistant estimates that 25,000
books are now being hoarded by faculty mem
bers. A fair proportion of these are concerned
with the private life of the mollusc, or with the
sex habits of the pterodactyl; and have no
interest for students. But it is common to see an
undergraduate leave the desk saying things he
didn't learn from Victorian novels, because
some professor has cornered the book he
wants.
One faculty member had about 1200 books
out, according to the latest guotation. Doubt
less he is doing great research. But it takes a
good imagination to picture his using all 1200
at once.
And a special investigator would probably
declare an extra dividend when he heard of the
professor who wrote a book, assigned it to
his class, and then checked all six copies out
indefinitely.
The library is a little depressed about the
situation. If a student calls for a book that is
incarcerated in a professor's office, the library
sends a pleading little post card. When this is
ignored it enters the name on a slip, and settles
down to brood over its lost children.
The futility of it all depresses it too. A pro
fessor emeritus still has a volume he checked
out in January, 1907. The assistants are consid
ering asking him to leave it to them in his will.
Of course, Stanford has enough books to
keep the stacks in use in spite of the wander
ing volumes that never come back. But cynics
are beginning to suggest that if the drain keeps
up we will have to make the professors install
card catalogues for their borrowed books. Then
we could remodel the library and use it for
basketball.—J. C.
SOME weeks ago a very uncertain student
was assigned a term paper and decided
that a little background material on folk-lore
might ultimately reflect itself in the Bawlout.
He plunged into the never-never land of the
library card index, emerged after half an hour
of first-rate exploring work, and called for a
standard work on folk-lore.
The attendant at the desk informed him that
it was out, and would continue to be out for
some time, because a professor in the Spanish
department had cornered the market in folk
lore books two years before. The student went
home to make up his own folk-lore about pro
fessors v/ho take books out of the library and
refuse to return them.
