LAST week Editor John Burd of the Daily
Californian ran an editorial claiming for
Cal a superiority in scholars, instruction and
research unequalled since Plato quit active
practice. Monday morning Mrs. Herbert Hoo
ver ventured over to Berkeley to give a lecture,
and Burd ran a story stating that she had grad
uated from the University of California in 1894.
All this is rather alarming, because the Regis
trar's files say that Mrs. Hoover graduated from
Stanford in 1898, with an A.B. in geology. And
her secretary says that Mrs. Hoover never at
tended the University of California.
Academic superiority is a matter of personal
opinion; if it gives Cal any pleasure to claim it,
there is no reason why we should be selfish
and quarrel with them. But if Berkeley is going
to start the practice of annexing any Stanford
graduate who wanders across the Bay it's time
to call offside. It just isn't fair. If this prece
dent is established, no Farm man will be safe,
ftiul wo can soy yoodbye to Mr. Hoover, Dr.

Wilbur, and any other man that may strike the
Cal fancy.
Berkeley claims the largest alumni body on
the Coast; and yet Burd can't wait until June to
see it enlarged.
After all, if Cal is going to take over our
alumni they might in common courtesy let us
know before hand and refund the cost of their
education.â€”J. C.
