CHINA AND THE OPEN MIND
W/HATEVER Ex Committee decides on the question
of recognizing the Fax - Eastern Student Emer
gency fund—and it has a perfect right to refuse recog
nition as far as I am concerned—it seems to me that a
word might be said for it, not on any of the grounds
that will doubtless be presented, but simply on those of
common decency. .
* In his editorial in yesterday's Daily, Associate Editor
Cobbs noted that the Fund would be used impartially
for both Chinese and Japanese students, and remarked
that, "It is not hard to be impartial to Japanese students
when you can't find one without a posse."
Assuming that for this reason the Fund will be used
only for Chinese students—disregarding the Fund Com
mittee's express intention of aiding Japanese students if
they are found—he goes on to predict that any such
fund administered from America would plunge us into
the middle of the current Asiatic crisis.
This, it seems to me, is assuming a good deal. Since
the Fund will be administered through the Y.M.CA., a
recognized organization, and since it will be used, not
for shotguns but for scholars—always an honored com
modity in the East—l doubt very much whether the
Japanese people, who after all have very little to say in
the matter, will object.
And it occurs to me to ask, what if they did? As
suming a certain amount of intelligence on the part of
the Y.M.C.A., a certain regard for its own safety, I
doubt if the Japanese Army could take very effective
reprisals upon it; and even if it could, I doubt very much
whether the Japanese Army is willing to take on the
United States Government, or even world opinion, for
the sake of a few students.

T>EACE at any price is a nice, alliterative generaliza
tion; but when it is carried to the extent of refusing
aid to a class comparatively removed from the battle, it
can lead to a number of other generalizations, not so il
literative, not so nice.
If aid to non-combatants is to be refused, why not
forbid contributions to the Red Cross? If any organiza
tion sticks its nose willy-nilly into other people's wars,
that one does. And never yet have we got into a war on
its account. Never yet has it succeeded in arousing the
sort of feeling the Panay affair aroused. Even in modern
warfare humanity has a place—a very small place. If
it is to keep that, it must not be hit over the head every
time it says boo.
Further, Mr. Cobbs objects to the Fund on the ground
that its literature calls Japan's aggression "a rebellion
against God's moral law." And isn't it? Unprovoked,
unpopular, inhumane, its moral justification seems very
slim.
Sometime, it seems to me, the world is going to have
to take a stand one way or the other. If Japan is wrong,
by all that's holy be honest and say so. If innocent
people are being harrassed and killed, by all means don't
be afraid to be honest and help them. If something is
wrong, say it is wrong. Democracy has gone down be
fore this in a welter of perpetual quibble, and it may go
down again.
The open mind is a wonderful thing, and I admire it.
But underlying every case the open mind has to con
sider is a certain basic truth, a certain basic right. And
attempts to evade this right or look away from it at
something more pleasant—and less demanding—only
serve to bring that much nearer the ultimate destruction
of liberal opinion.
Sometime, somehow, the open mind must, make its
decision. Otherwise it dies, killed by its own impartial
ity.—Allen Drury.
