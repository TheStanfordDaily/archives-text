it's still quite a while off, the season of
the San Carlos Opera Company deserves attention
of Joe and Dolly Rough. You probably will be told,
when you mention possession of tickets to one or more
of the performances, that you might as well be sitting
home listening to the Classical Recording Hour on
station KYA. Or that you'd be doing a lot better if
you did.
Don't be misled. You can hear all the music, played
more or less correctly, and sung with willingness, if
not deftness. You may return home with a grin on
your face, but it is pure snobbishness to claim that you
can get nothing from the San Carlos Company.
Following their big brothers, who finished their
season last Fall, the company opens with "Aida," and
offers 18 performances, three of them repeats of "Ma
dame Butterfly." Anent "Aida," you may remember
the skit in the Gaieties which was all sort of confused,
but which opened with a grand march. The column
of marching men consisted of three stars who marched
on the stage, dashed off and around the flats, and
marched back on again. The San Carlos is forced into
much the same tactics whenever they do "Aida."

that's nothing. The "Big" opera in S. F. uses
the whole Galileo High football squad as spear
carriers. Some of them have been doing it so long
they won their letters. News of scabbing came out
from last season's performances, however, when an
acquaintance of ours spotted a block C somewhere in
the glint of armor.
Probably the favorite of most audiences is their
"Madame Butterfly," where' the little Japanese miss,
Hizi Koyke, takes the title role and does a good job of
it. You can pretty well count on enjoying this one.
But you can never quite be sure that your artistic
mood won't be broken somewhere in the evening by
a rather ludicrous mishap. For instance, in a per
formance of "Carmen," a year or so ago. a tiny tenor
was ranged against a massive soprano in the two title
roles. In the scene where Carmen dances, Escarnilio
had perched himself precariously on a table while
Carmen dashed around preparatory to her dance.
Somehow, the long fringes of her shawl became en
tangled in the buttons on Kscamilio's coat. When,
with a gigantic toss of her head, she flung herself off in
gay abandon, little Escarnilio found himself singing
from the floor.
But this is not to discourage you. Particularly if
you have yet to attend your first opera, you can make
a good start here. The grosser mishaps will simply
amuse you, and the lack of finejse, of fine singing, and
of lavish production won't bother you.
The experienced crew of opera-goers can use their
own judgment. But the first who hints hi-. iu»sr in the
air is a Philistine. Stone.
