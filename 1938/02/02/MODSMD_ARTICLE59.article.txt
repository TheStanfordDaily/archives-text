# Libe Gardener Does Service In Farm Flood
## 
### 
Boy Scout medal for distinguished
service during the great flood on the
Stanford campus, yesterday and
Monday, goes to Joe Weiss, gardener
at the Libe grounds, who took it
upon himself to do something about
the congested parking situation
there.
Joe got out and directed parking
in an area which, so notoriously
dangerous even under ordinary con
ditions that drivers venture in at
the risk of bent bumpers and
smashed fenders, was made doubly
bad by the storm. Strangely
enough, though more students rode
to class in their Cords and Model
A's to keep out of the rain, there
seemed to be twice as much room as
before in the Libe parking area.
Reports indicate that it is now
possible to effect entrance and exit
without actual danger to life, limb,
and new paint jobs.
