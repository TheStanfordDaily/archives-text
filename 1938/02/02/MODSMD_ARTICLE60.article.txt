Lusty and strong as its main
character is Stuart Cloete's "The
Turning Wheels," saga of the Great
Boer Trek which took some
thousands of Dutch immigrants into
the heart of South Africa 100 years
ago.
Illuminating a section of history,
which has been more or less neg
lected by both novelists and his
torians, Mr. Cloete tells the story of
the caravan led by Hendrik Van Der
Burg, stern Puritan who rational
izes the Bible to fit his own will.
When the disturbing beauty of
Sannie van Reenen captivates Hen
drik, he sees that the only way he
can have her is by shooting her
lover, his son Hermann. This he
does, finding without difficulty a
justification for the murder in the
Bible. God means him to produce
many children to fill this fertile land
into which they are going, and, in
Sannie, God obviously has provided
the perfect wife. Therefore, it is
dnly right that she be his.
But in Sannie, -Hendrik does not
find the mother he had hoped for,
and after Hermann's son is born,
she gives Hendrik no more. Ever
seeking outlet, his desire grows into
an all-consuming fire which destroys
him and eventually destroys his
people. The massacre which ends
the book is the indirect but inevit
able result of his insane obsession.
Mr. Cloete writes his story out of
a deep familiarity with the people
in it, creating characters such as
Tante Anna de Jong, philisophical
old female Falstaff, and the great
hunter, Zwarte Picle du Plessis,
the only man who forsees the de
struction of the settlement.
Told in a lucid, .hard-hitting prose
which pulls no punches, "The Turn
ing Wheels" forms a colorful record
of a little-known period in the his
tory of a great and indomitable
people.—Drury.
