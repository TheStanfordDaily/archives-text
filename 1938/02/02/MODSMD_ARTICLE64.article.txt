The Editor, Sir:
An article on the front page of
Friday's Daily has solved all my
pressing problems.
1 hereby give notice of intention
to organize a 500-Buck-a-Year Club
with the purpose of gathering suf
ficient support among alumni and
students to carry me through the
rest of this year.
I have set $10, no less, as the price
of each year-membership: I know
that the public spirit will stand be
hind me in this cause. I expect
contributions especially from all
living groups and clubs, from Presi
dent Wilbur, and from former Presi
dent Hoover, because they are well
known for loyalty to Stanford.
I'm an athlete of sorts (I want to
be here next. Fall for varsity chess),
but I need the money primarily so
I can stay on the Farm and study.
Contributors please call 3121 be
between 5 and (5 o'clock. Amounts
less than $10 will be welcome, of
course. And the Dippy might start
things off.—"Unnamed Student."
