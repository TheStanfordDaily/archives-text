Starts Program
This get-together is the first of a
projected plan of activities for the
quarter being sponsored by the Si.u- ;
dent-Faculty Relations Committee j
of the A.S.S.U. The schedule for j
this quarter includes, besides the j
bull session, several Sunday eve- 1
nings at various professors' homes, j
This plan was used last quarter to
bring students and members of the
faculty closer together, and proved
very successful, according to Jean
Bird, chairman of the committee.
This Sunday, Dr. Hazel D. Hansen
of the classics department will have
the first evening bull session in her
Kingscote apartment from 8 to about
10 o'clock. There will be a sign-up
in the A.S.S.U. office for those stu
dents who wish to come. Anyone
who is interested should sign up
immediately, as the number is lim
ited.
Committee Members
The Student - Faculty Relations
Committee includes: Chairman Bird,
Vic Martin, Jane Eaton, Barbara
Paine, Gordon Pearson, Putzie Hin
richs, Woody Miller, and Charlotte
Lombardi.
The purpose of the program for
this quarter is to draw the two sides
of the campus—the faculty and the
student body—together more and to
get them better acquainted, accord
ing to Miss Bird. Student-faculty
relations are "deplorable," in com
parison with large schools in the
East, she believes. The committee
is attempting to remove the apathy
existent in these relations.
