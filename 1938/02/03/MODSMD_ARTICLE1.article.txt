# Money Drive Problem Will Go To Excom
## Killefer Proposes Special Committee To Study Campaigns 
### 
Ex Committee's recurrent prob
lem of what to do about finance
drives of student organizations
might be solved by creating a spe
cial student-faculty committee to
investigate such campaigns, A.S.S.U.
President Tom Killefer declared yes
terday.
Brought to the front recently by
Axe Society's campaign for scholar
ships for athletes and by the pro
jected campaign to aid Chinese stu
dents, as well as by former Daily
Editor Irvin Jorgensen's efforts last
fall to secure contributions for send
ing medical aid to Loyalist Spain,
the whole problem is to be discussed
at next week's meeting of Ex Com
mittee, Killefer said.
Solution Cited
One possible solution, the A.S.S.U.
president believes, would be to re
vitalize a once-existing student
faculty committee that had as its
sole function deciding on the per
missibility of proposed campus fund
drives.
Such a committee was active here
through the 1920's he related, but
then died out.
With no definite rules existing
governing proposed financial ap
peals, Killefer thinks that "there is
a definite flaw in the student gov
ernment which should not be al
lowed to continue, since the A.S.S.U.
is held responsible for what student
organizations do."
After conferring with President
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday, he
said that University officials are
sympathetic with the proposal to
establish a special joint student-fac
ulty committee to deal with the
problem.
Direct Contribution
On the proposed .$5OO Stanford
contribution to the national cam
paign of Christian organizations to
send $25,000 to Far Eastern students,
Killefer said that a direct contribu
tion from the A.S.S.U. treasury,
rather than permission for a finan
cial campaign, was involved.
Admitting the humanitarian na
ture of the drive, Killefer said that
the proposal was vetoed by Ex Com
mittee because of the "partisanship"
involved.
Axe Society's recent drive for
athletic scholarships will also come
up for discussion before Ex Commit
tee, he indicated.
By enactment of a special consti
tutional by-law, it would be possible
to deal with all future fund-raising
proposals, Killefer concluded.

ture of the drive, Killefer said that
the proposal was vetoed by Ex Com
mittee because of the "partisanship"
involved.
Axe Society's recent drive for
athletic scholarships will also come
up for discussion before Ex Commit
tee, he indicated.
By enactment of a special consti
tutional by-law, it would be possible
to deal with all future fund-raising
proposals, Killefer concluded.
Ex Committee's recurrent prob
lem of what to do about finance
drives of student organizations
might be solved by creating a spe
cial student-faculty committee to
investigate such campaigns, A.S.S.U.
President Tom Killefer declared yes
terday.
Brought to the front recently by
Axe Society's campaign for scholar
ships for athletes and by the pro
jected campaign to aid Chinese stu
dents, as well as by former Daily
Editor Irvin Jorgensen's efforts last
fall to secure contributions for send
ing medical aid to Loyalist Spain,
the whole problem is to be discussed
at next week's meeting of Ex Com
mittee, Killefer said.
Solution Cited
One possible solution, the A.S.S.U.
president believes, would be to re
vitalize a once-existing student
faculty committee that had as its
sole function deciding on the per
missibility of proposed campus fund
drives.
Such a committee was active here
through the 1920's he related, but
then died out.
With no definite rules existing
governing proposed financial ap
peals, Killefer thinks that "there is
a definite flaw in the student gov
ernment which should not be al
lowed to continue, since the A.S.S.U.
is held responsible for what student
organizations do."
After conferring with President
Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday, he
said that University officials are
sympathetic with the proposal to
establish a special joint student-fac
ulty committee to deal with the
problem.
Direct Contribution
On the proposed .$5OO Stanford
contribution to the national cam
paign of Christian organizations to
send $25,000 to Far Eastern students,
Killefer said that a direct contribu
tion from the A.S.S.U. treasury,
rather than permission for a finan
cial campaign, was involved.
Admitting the humanitarian na
ture of the drive, Killefer said that
the proposal was vetoed by Ex Com
mittee because of the "partisanship"
involved.
Axe Society's recent drive for
athletic scholarships will also come
up for discussion before Ex Commit
tee, he indicated.
By enactment of a special consti
tutional by-law, it would be possible

proposals, Killefer concluded.
