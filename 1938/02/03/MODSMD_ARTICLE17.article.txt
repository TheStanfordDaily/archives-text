# Row, Roble Exchange Phi Delts Popular With Girls
## 
### 
Roble went out to dinner the night
before last. That is, 60 women went
out to dinner and the rest stayed
home and met HO male Greek speci
mens who came to their house for
dinner.
It all sounds very complicated, but
it was only Roble having an ex
change dinner with four fraternity
houses on the Row. The Delts, Phi
Delts, Alpha Delts, and Betas each
sent 15 men to Roble in exchange
for 15 of the fairest flowers of '41.
Apparently a good time was had
by all—especially by the women at
the Phi Dolt house. They stayed the
longest. A senior of that tong re
marked, "They're damn nice kids.
We've had a Roble exchange every
year and this is the first one that
hasn't been stiff."
A loyal Delt junior stuck up for
the women in his class. "The girls
up here were pretty good most of
them,'' he said. "I think our class
was the best, but this class comes

next to it."
An enthusiastic Alpha Delt soph
apparently likes his class, too, for
he remarked of the Roble women
(after many suspicions that it was
a freshman woman and not The
Daily doing the checking), "They're
wonderful!— Simply exuberant! But
they're not as good as the class of
*40."
An unbiased junior transfer of
the Beta house said rather ambigu
ously, "I thought the women were
pretty good on the average. Of
course I haven't anything to compare
them with."
Nearly all the men seemed to have
enjoyed the exchange and a number
of the freshman women spoke glow
ingly of their hosts.
"They were wonderful to us,"
said one, ". . . made us feel right at
home."
Roble went out to dinner. Sixty
Row men ramc to Roble.
"We enjoyed it," said the men.
"We loved it," said the women.
