# Beman To Head Men's Council
## Delt Defeats Rider For Chairmanship 
### 
Jack Benian, Delta Tau Delta, was
chosen yesterday to succeed John
Dern as chairman of Men's Council.
He will take office next Wednesday.
Beman and Dave Rider, holdover
councilmen, were the candidates for
the position. Votes were cast by all
five members, including Chairman
Dern, Ed Barnett, and Stan Zimet,
who will retire after Tuesday's elec
tion.
A secretary probably will be
chosen at the first meeting of the
new regime. Rider, who now holds
that position, and three new mem
bers will all be eligible, since the
qualification of previous experience,
which applies to the chairmanship,
does not hold to this post.
Other business transacted at yes
terday's meeting included routine
consideration of parking and speed
ing tickets. Students are warned by
Men's Council to be especially care
ful about parking in the Physics
parking lot so as not to furnish an
obstruction to cars desiring to park
or to leave.
