# Discussion Held By Walrus Club
## 
### 
Tracing the economic philosophy
and historical background of "Crop
Control," Robert Galletti and M. K.
Bennett, both of the Food Research
Institute, led a Walrus Club panel
discussion last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
The central idea of all recent
plans for crop control has been the
conception that the farmers' income
should be raised by the limitation
of acreage and consequently in
creased prices," said Mr. Bennett,
who is executive secretary of the
institute.
Commenting upon the philosophi
cal aspects of agricultural limitation,
Mr. Galletti declared, "The farmer
is faced by the apparent paradox
that society will pay more for less,
and crop control plans point toward
producing only so much as the com
munity will pay the highest prices
for, in proportion to the work in
volved."
