# 'Little' Business Leaders Convene
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP). -
The first congress of America's little
business men and women settled
down tonight to prepare what they
hoped would be a "helpful" eco
nomic program for President Roose
velt, after an opening session up
roar over attacks on the New Deal
and charges that the presiding officer
had been "hand picked."
Later A. S. Shafer, a Philadelphia
building contractor, was escorted
from the Department of Commerce
building by federal guards because
he refused to abide by a speaking
time limit. The incident occurred
after Shafer earlier had been pre
vented from making a speech at the
general gathering. He finally made
it before an empty house.
Criticism of the conference spread
to Congress, where Hep. Dudley A.
White, R., 0., said in a House speech
that the meeting was "cut and dried"
and "a frame-up."
The tumult began soon after more
than 1000 small business execu
tives had crowded into the auditor
ium at the Department of Com
merce. They came from 45 states.
Each delegate had his own cure for
the recession. They jeered at the
views of some colleagues but de
manded so loudly to present their
own that Secretary of Commerce
Daniel C. Roper was forced to. in
tervene.
