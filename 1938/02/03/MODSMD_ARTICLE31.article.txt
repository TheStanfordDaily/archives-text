## 
### 
"Japan's military adventure in China is not the work cf a small army
clique, hut is wholeheartedly supported hy the mass of the Japanese people,
including students and intellectuals," according to 'lhohurn T. Brumbaugh,
expert on the Far-Eastern situation, who spoke at the Luncheon Club
yesterday.
"The Japanese feel that every other method of improving internal con-

ditions has failed, and they turn to<
the new, dynamic military policy as
a last resource. Trying to feed a
population more than half as large
as ours on an area of cultivated land
no larger than half of the state of
Ohio, has produced unbelievable
rural poverty. Conditions have been
becoming worse for the last 10 years.
The intelligent Japanese compare
their standards of living and com
fort with those of the United States
and other Western countries and are
dissatisfied," said Mr. Brumbaugh.
"Deep in their hearts, the Japa
nese students want peace and fel
lowship with other nations, particu
larly the United States," Mr.
Brumbaugh, "but the idealism and
internationalism which character
ized them 10 years ago has largely
been crowded out by Japan's press
ing need for action."
The mass of the Japanese feel that
the so called "civil" element in the
government is dominated by the 15
industrial families and work lor their
interests alone, while the military
element is striving for the improve
ment of the whole country, the
speaker explained.
A recognized authority on Far-
Eastern affairs, Mr. Brumbaugh has
spent 13 years in Japan as the di
rector of the Wesley Foundation.
