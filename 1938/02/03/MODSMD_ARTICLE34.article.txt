Stanford may have many a con- j
troversy over Peace Day observ- j
ances and campaigns to send medi- j
cal relief and funds to Spanish Loy- J
alists and Chinese Nationalists, but
one university where such matters'
seem to be taken as a matter of
course is the University of Chicago,
Gerald Marcus, touring Cardinal j
debater, wrote recently to The j
Daily.
"The University of Chicago does '
not have the motto that relates to :
winds of freedom; it might well |
have," Marcus, who with Carl Dei- j
senroth is representing Stanford in i
debates with 14 Eastern universi- ,
ties, declared.
Endowed by the Rockefeller |

foundation, the debater said that
"the Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity permits absolute intellectual
freedom, both among students and
faculty."
University policy is to permit
"virtually any outside speaker to
address students in all campus
meetings," he stated.
"Just yesterday Scott Nearing
spoke in one part of the campus, the
Communist Club sponsored a lec
ture in another part, and the Ameri
can Student Union held a current
events class in another," Marcus
wrote.
Large A.S.U. Group
The debater said that he was im
pressed by the A.S.U.'s membership
of over 350, and that a Communist J
and two Socialist clubs each had
nearly 100 members.
While in Chicago, Marcus said he 1

heard lectures by Professor Jacob
Viner, T. V. Smith, Paul Douglas,
and H. A. Millis, but that he had
missed literally dozens of other
brilliant and outstanding men on
the faculty.
No Class Politics
Chief difference from Stanford,
Marcus found, was that "the stu
dent body does not exist as a poli
tical group, which may or may not
bo unfortunate." Neither are there
any class organizations or officers,
he reported.
"Inter-collegiate athletics are on
their way out and students take life
seriously, but perhaps there might
be a method in the madness," Mar
cus concluded, adding that the cold
weather was freezing his ears.
The Cardinal debaters are now
visiting at the University of Pitts
burgh.

University policy is to permit
"virtually any outside speaker to
address students in all campus
meetings," he stated.
"Just yesterday Scott Nearing
spoke in one part of the campus, the
Communist Club sponsored a lec
ture in another part, and the Ameri
can Student Union held a current
events class in another," Marcus
wrote.
Large A.S.U. Group
The debater said that he was im
pressed by the A.S.U.'s membership
of over 350, and that a Communist J
and two Socialist clubs each had
nearly 100 members.
While in Chicago, Marcus said he 1

heard lectures by Professor Jacob
Viner, T. V. Smith, Paul Douglas,
and H. A. Millis, but that he had
missed literally dozens of other
brilliant and outstanding men on
the faculty.
No Class Politics
Chief difference from Stanford,
Marcus found, was that "the stu
dent body does not exist as a poli
tical group, which may or may not
bo unfortunate." Neither are there
any class organizations or officers,
he reported.
"Inter-collegiate athletics are on
their way out and students take life
seriously, but perhaps there might
be a method in the madness," Mar
cus concluded, adding that the cold
weather was freezing his ears.
The Cardinal debaters are now
visiting at the University of Pitts
burgh.
