STANFORD IS STILL
PRETTY CLEAN
Just for the purposes of com
parison, here is the setup in personal
fouls for individual players so far
in the basketball conference:
Captain Chet Carlisle of Califor
nia leads the offenders with 16,
which gives hirn an average of
slightly better than three for the five
games he has played.
Crossan Hays of U.C.L.A., Carl
Anderson of U.S.C., and Captain Bill
Rcrnsen of U.S.C. are tied for second
with 14 each. Anderson seems to
have little trouble keeping up with
the leaders even though* he has
played in just five games, and about
half of them watching his under
study Dale Sears from the bench.
Why they ever nicknamed Ander
son "Buttercup" is beyond anybody's
ken. He's no slouch as a basketball
player in some respects, but a prin
cipal point in any basketball play
er's makeup should be his ethics of
play. Anderson ain't got 'em.
Back to the original story, Stan
ford s leaders in the dirty play
league are Jack Caldersplinters with
11, and H. B. Lee with 10. Captain
Luisetti is stiil whirling around half
again as fast as three-quarters of
the players in the loop and he has
just six. Art Stoefen, in spite of
what anybody might recollect, is
still quite pure with six.
Phil Zonne has transgressed the
rules seven times, and Big Tom
Siebert has been a little over-zeal
ous thrice.
Apart from that, Stanford has been
playing pretty fair basketball. Cali
fornia has a pair of boys to match
Stanford's guards in Bob Garetson
and Lou Goldenson, for they have
11 fouls apiece.
The guards are the players that
have to do the dirty work, and on
the whole they pile up more fouls
than men in any other position.
However, Carlisle, Hays and Ander
son, who lead, are centers. Rem
sen is the only guard up that high
so far.
CAL HASN'T WON
THE LEAGUE YET
Conference standings for what is
approximately the first half of the
season find Cal with five wins and
no losses, Stanford with three wins
and two losses, U.S.C. with two wins
and three losses, and U.C.L.A. with
not much of anything.
Cal and Stanford have seven more
games, three between themselves,
two with U.S.C., and two with U.C.
LA. By winning the next three
games from Cal, trouncing U.C.L.A.
again for a pair, and splitting with
Troy, Stanford can at least tie with
Cal for the league title.
To reach such an impasse, Cal
will have to win all but the three
Stanford games, which, of course,
are all reserved in the name of the
Cards. However, a slip-up that
gave Stanford and Cal two victories
over each other would mean that
if Cal went undefeated in her four
games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. she
would win the conference, regard
less of how Stanford fared with the
two southern outfits.
Well, Cal won't go undefeated this
season against Troy and the Bruins,
even though she has won half of
each four-game series already.
Stanford has a better chance in that
department—but this thing is getting
too involved.
Cal will lose her first conference
game Friday night.—Peterson.

Crossan Hays of U.C.L.A., Carl
Anderson of U.S.C., and Captain Bill
Rcrnsen of U.S.C. are tied for second
with 14 each. Anderson seems to
have little trouble keeping up with
the leaders even though* he has
played in just five games, and about
half of them watching his under
study Dale Sears from the bench.
Why they ever nicknamed Ander
son "Buttercup" is beyond anybody's
ken. He's no slouch as a basketball
player in some respects, but a prin
cipal point in any basketball play
er's makeup should be his ethics of
play. Anderson ain't got 'em.
Back to the original story, Stan
ford s leaders in the dirty play
league are Jack Caldersplinters with
11, and H. B. Lee with 10. Captain
Luisetti is stiil whirling around half
again as fast as three-quarters of
the players in the loop and he has
just six. Art Stoefen, in spite of
what anybody might recollect, is
still quite pure with six.
Phil Zonne has transgressed the
rules seven times, and Big Tom
Siebert has been a little over-zeal
ous thrice.
Apart from that, Stanford has been
playing pretty fair basketball. Cali
fornia has a pair of boys to match
Stanford's guards in Bob Garetson
and Lou Goldenson, for they have
11 fouls apiece.
The guards are the players that
have to do the dirty work, and on
the whole they pile up more fouls
than men in any other position.
However, Carlisle, Hays and Ander
son, who lead, are centers. Rem
sen is the only guard up that high
so far.
CAL HASN'T WON
THE LEAGUE YET
Conference standings for what is
approximately the first half of the
season find Cal with five wins and
no losses, Stanford with three wins
and two losses, U.S.C. with two wins
and three losses, and U.C.L.A. with
not much of anything.
Cal and Stanford have seven more
games, three between themselves,
two with U.S.C., and two with U.C.
LA. By winning the next three
games from Cal, trouncing U.C.L.A.
again for a pair, and splitting with
Troy, Stanford can at least tie with
Cal for the league title.
To reach such an impasse, Cal
will have to win all but the three
Stanford games, which, of course,
are all reserved in the name of the
Cards. However, a slip-up that
gave Stanford and Cal two victories
over each other would mean that
if Cal went undefeated in her four
games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. she
would win the conference, regard
less of how Stanford fared with the
two southern outfits.
Well, Cal won't go undefeated this
season against Troy and the Bruins,
even though she has won half of
each four-game series already.
Stanford has a better chance in that
department—but this thing is getting
too involved.
Cal will lose her first conference
game Friday night.—Peterson.
STANFORD IS STILL
PRETTY CLEAN
Just for the purposes of com
parison, here is the setup in personal
fouls for individual players so far
in the basketball conference:
Captain Chet Carlisle of Califor
nia leads the offenders with 16,
which gives hirn an average of
slightly better than three for the five
games he has played.
Crossan Hays of U.C.L.A., Carl
Anderson of U.S.C., and Captain Bill
Rcrnsen of U.S.C. are tied for second
with 14 each. Anderson seems to
