# Ticket Rules Are Explained
## Cards 'Punched' By Students Are Voided 
### 
Additional warning to students
that rooters' tickets for the Cali
fornia-Stanford game must be used
only by the rightful purchaser was
issued yesterday by Al Masters,
general manager of the Board of
Athletic Control. Student body cards
must be presented at the Pavilion
with the rooters' tickets.
"At a rooters' sale we punch the
student body card of each purchas
er," said Masters. "We have been
advised that some students who did
not secure tickets Monday have
since acquired them and are cutting
holes in their cards to resemble our
punch mark. These alterations will
be detected, the cards confiscated,
and the holders denied admission,
though they have rooters' tickets.
"Students should bear in mind
that rooters' tickets are not trans
ferable, even to other students, and
must be returned to the Foard of
Athletic Control for refund if the
original purchasers cannot use them.
A rooters' ticket presented by any
one other than the original pur
chaser will be confiscated, as will
the student body card."
Any tickets returned for refund
will be sold to students on the wait
ing list in the order in which they
signed. Mr. Masters again called
attention to the fact that approxi
mately 100 .standing room tickets will
go on sale to students at the Pa
vilion at 8 o'clock Friday night.
