Announcing a change of officials
for tomorrow night's varsity game,
Graduate Manager Alfred R. Mas
ters yesterday issued the following
statement:
"We have been informed this
week, from outside sources, that Art
Ross, who had been selected as one
of the officials for the California-
Stanford basketball game Friday
night, is associated with the same
real estate firm with which Nibs
Price, University of California bas
ketball coach, is identified.
"We believe that because of this
business connection, it would place
Mr. Ross in a very embarrassing po
sition and would not be to his best
interests or to the best interests of
basketball for him to officiate this
game. For this reason, Ernie Bailly,
if he is available, will be substituted
for Mr. Ross. It is to be understood
distinctly that in replacing Mr. Ross,
we do not reflect on Mr. Ross' abil
ity or integrity."
