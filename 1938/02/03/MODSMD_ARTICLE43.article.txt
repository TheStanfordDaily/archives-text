# 'Stop Cal' Play Stars Luisetti
## 
### 
Nibs Price and his low-price cubs
—marked down from Bears—are go
ing to be plenty surprised when
they meet Stanford's basketballers
tomorrow night.
It's something new that they're
going to hit—something never before
shown in these parts—and it was
designed especially for the rougher
uppers from across the bay.
Yes, John Bunn plucked it from
his never-ending bag of tricks just
for Cal. It's a new defense, and it's
tremendous. You'll see for your
self.
And that's not all. Dr. John has
revamped the Card fast break, and
doubled its spe.ed. But first, about
that defense.
Those who saw the first Cal game
—in fact, all those who remember
Cal's style of offense—will remem
ber the "weave" that they employ
to bring the ball down the court. In
this move, the two guards plus one
other man weave back and forth,
passing the ball between them as
they do.
To stop this, Dr. John has devel
oped a defense which puts Captain
"Hank" Luisetti front and center,
about two yards directly in back of
the center circle. The other four
men are placed in the form of a
square—just outside the foul circle.
This gives Hank the chance to in
tercept one of the passes which Cal
will be flipping across court in the
"weave." In the meantime, the
other Cards are ready to pull down
the long passes, which will be many
when Cal finds itself stymied by
Luisetti.
As to that super-speed fast break,
Dr. John has eliminated the former
long passes between players run
ning in a straight line. Tearing
down the court, the Indians now
cut hither and yon, and it's well
nigh impossible to discover just
where they will be next.
The passes are now much shorter,
and most of them make use of
screening. Thus, the old formula to
the effect that short, invisible passes
are much more effective than long
heaves which a blind man could see
is borne out.
Watch for these innovations.
You'll be almost as surprised as Mr.
Price and Co. will be at their effec
tiveness.

And that's not all. Dr. John has
revamped the Card fast break, and
doubled its spe.ed. But first, about
that defense.
Those who saw the first Cal game
—in fact, all those who remember
Cal's style of offense—will remem
ber the "weave" that they employ
to bring the ball down the court. In
this move, the two guards plus one
other man weave back and forth,
passing the ball between them as
they do.
To stop this, Dr. John has devel
oped a defense which puts Captain
"Hank" Luisetti front and center,
about two yards directly in back of
the center circle. The other four
men are placed in the form of a
square—just outside the foul circle.
This gives Hank the chance to in
tercept one of the passes which Cal
will be flipping across court in the
"weave." In the meantime, the
other Cards are ready to pull down
the long passes, which will be many
when Cal finds itself stymied by
Luisetti.
As to that super-speed fast break,
Dr. John has eliminated the former
long passes between players run
ning in a straight line. Tearing
down the court, the Indians now
cut hither and yon, and it's well
nigh impossible to discover just
where they will be next.
The passes are now much shorter,
and most of them make use of
screening. Thus, the old formula to
the effect that short, invisible passes
are much more effective than long
heaves which a blind man could see
is borne out.
Watch for these innovations.
You'll be almost as surprised as Mr.
Price and Co. will be at their effec
tiveness.
