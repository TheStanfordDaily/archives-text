# Frosh Baseball Team To Meet Santa Clara
## 
### 
A yet untested and untried frosh
baseball team will play their first
game against Santa Clara's fresh
men Friday at 3:30 o'clock on the
Farm frosh diamond.
Although the game will be the
| first encounter for both teams, pre
| season dope gives the Encinans
an edge. With a longer practice
| period tucked under their belts than
: the Broncos can brag of, the little
i red machine should roll to a win.
When first calls were sounded for
; baseball about a month ago, Fresh-
I man Coach Harry Shipkey and his
! assistant, Bobby Grayson, were
i greeted by a turnout of material of
rather unknown proportions. How
ever, practice on fundamentals and
form has smoothed off rough edges
and the team is rounding out nicely.
Thompson Stars
Several individual stars are be
ginning to appear in the outfit.
"Cutie" Thompson, erstwhile foot
ball quarterback, now assumes the
role of a pitcher of no mean ability.
Moreover, his batting is not down
j to the usual standard of a pitcher,
I as he is one of the longest hitters on

the team.
"Swede" Johanessen, the fastest '
talker on the squad and also a heavy I
hitter, will bear watching. "Ush"
Tucker, hustling first sacker, can
also swat 'em far and wide.
Squad To Be Aided
The squad, although at least two i
deep in every position, will be fur
ther strengthened before the games ;
with the Cal frosh next quarter. Don \
Smiles, who ranks close behind j
Thompson in hurling ability, has '
a bit of ineligibility to work off. j
Two present basketball players. !
"Mike" Marshal and Ditlevson, will |
be turning out at the end of the ca
saba season and will be in trim by
then.
The team roster as it is at present,
follows. The first named in each '
position will be the probable starter
in Friday's encounter.
P—Thompson, Smiley, H. Smith,
Murphy, Pfyl. C — Atkinson, Fay, >
Purkett. lb—Tucker, Harbke. 2b— j
