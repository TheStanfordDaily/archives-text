## 
### 
Practice tennis matches have been
! scheduled for both varsity and
frosh teams for Saturday, Feb. 12,
according to Varsity Tennis Mana
ger Ed Barnett. The varsity will
tackle a team from the California
Tennis Club in San Francisco and
the frosh will oppose Menlo Junior
College on the University courts.
Varsity, prospects were dimmed
momentarily last week-end when it
was thought that Captain Bob Un
derwood would not recover from in
juries suffered on a recent skiing
trip in time to participate in the
opening match. However Under
wood will be in shape and probably
will turn out for practice within a
few days.
