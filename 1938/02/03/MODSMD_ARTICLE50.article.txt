# Frosh Cagers Point Toward Bear Cub Tilt
## Cal Yearling Stock Rises After Victory Over Mission High 
### 
Following yesterday's well-de
served lay-off from practice, Stan
ford's frosh hoopsters will swing
back into their drills today in final
preparation for the week-end's
games against yearling teams from
California and University of San
Francisco.
The Bear Cubs' stock continued
to soar following a decisive 53-31
victory over Mission High School of
San Francisco last Tuesday night.
The win gave Cal a season record
of three triumphs in seven games to
date. Cubs' record:
4!)... . Cal Aggie Frosh 30
27.... Modesto Junior College. .. .54
28... .Santa Clara Frosh 57
27....8a1b0a High School... 30
20....L0we1l High School 21
45.... Sacramento High 5ch001.... 8
53... .Mission High School 31
Bear Cubs Improve
The record shows Cal's rapid im
provement and Coach Bill Higgins
j is bringing a team down to the Farm
tomorrow that is determined to
leave with a victory. A1 Darian, star
I guard, is working in better with the
team every practice session, while
Freeman Dill, diminutive forward,
continues to display the best shoot
ing eye on the squad.
Coach Wytze Gorter is more afraid
of how the Papooses will perform
Saturday night against S.F.U. than
against Cal. He is confident that
! Stanford can give the Bears all they
j can bargain for, but there is a dan
j gerous possibility that the Dons will
j catch the yearlings in the middle of
j a natural let-down that is bound to
follow the "Little Big Game."
Masters in Hospital
Bill Masters, sub-guard, is still in
the hospital with a bad case of flu,
but Don Williams, star forward, is
ridding himself of the effects of a
bad cold. Williams should be in top
shape for both tilts.
Statistics on the frosh for the elev
en games played have been assem
â–  bled and show that Mike Marshall is
1 leading the team with 92 points, an
! average of slightly more than 8
I digits a game.
