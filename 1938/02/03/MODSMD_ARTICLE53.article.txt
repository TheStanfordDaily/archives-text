SLIPPED into the production schedule of the
Department of Speech and Drama is a
double bill of one-act plays. The comment of
Director H. Miles Heberer was that the two were
chosen primarily "to entertain Stanford stud
ents," to remove the bad taste in the mouth of
campus theater-goers after "The Governor's
Wife."
This, it seems to me, is magnanimous of the
Department. When students complained that
"Murder in the Cathedral" was over their
heads, they were told that one of the chief pur
poses of campus dramatics should be to raise
the taste of theater audiences to the point where
worthwhile drama could be appreciated. Sub
sequent and scheduled productions bear out
this quasi-statement of policy.
The Department is primarily concerned with
giving as much as it can to students working
on its projects. The effect of such work on the
campus as a whole is incidental. Naturally,
student actors and producers will derive most
training from plays which are worthwhile to
start with. Like the rest of the world, they
doubt the possibility of making a silk purse
from a sow's ear.
If the comprehension of such plays is out
of the grasp of the uninitiated, so much the
worse. The campus had better devote a little
thought to improving a dramatic taste princi
pally acquired from Hollywood double bills.
There is no doubt that this attitude is log
ical and justified. The campus theater is a
laboratory, and should be used as such.
But, unfortunately, the theater cannot be con
sidered only as the chemist considers his test
tube—as a means to an end. The theater is a
two-way business, with actors and audience co
operating. Only through giving, can an audi
ence receive anything from the players. And
only by having a receptor can those players
succeed in fulfilling to the highest degree their
task of giving.
Therefore, if students complain of produc
tions which only the cast and technicians can
appreciate, they have some basis for a gripe
at being deprived of their rightful role in every
performance. If the "scientific" attitude were
carrid to its bitter extreme, an empty house
would be the ideal of the dramatist. Then,
without having to bother to explain his work
to a theatrical dull audience, he could revel in
the magnificent lighting change in Act 11,
Scene IV.
Lord knows, the taste of audiences needs to
be raised. But when the Department stops to
provide fare for the groundlings, no apologies
for a prostitution of its artistic concept need
be offered. We fear no more the possibility of
receiving a steady, and deadening, diet of such
obvious drama. That era is past. But when we
begin to miss some of the hard ones on the bill
of-fare, toss us a couple of easy plays as breath
ers, Mr. Department.
We'll take the chance you offer on this double
bill, and puff plenty before taking the next lap
in pursuit of an ability to appreciate fine drama.

heads, they were told that one of the chief pur
poses of campus dramatics should be to raise
the taste of theater audiences to the point where
worthwhile drama could be appreciated. Sub
sequent and scheduled productions bear out
this quasi-statement of policy.
The Department is primarily concerned with
giving as much as it can to students working
on its projects. The effect of such work on the
campus as a whole is incidental. Naturally,
student actors and producers will derive most
training from plays which are worthwhile to
start with. Like the rest of the world, they
doubt the possibility of making a silk purse
from a sow's ear.
If the comprehension of such plays is out
of the grasp of the uninitiated, so much the
worse. The campus had better devote a little
thought to improving a dramatic taste princi
pally acquired from Hollywood double bills.
There is no doubt that this attitude is log
ical and justified. The campus theater is a
laboratory, and should be used as such.
But, unfortunately, the theater cannot be con
sidered only as the chemist considers his test
tube—as a means to an end. The theater is a
two-way business, with actors and audience co
operating. Only through giving, can an audi
ence receive anything from the players. And
only by having a receptor can those players
succeed in fulfilling to the highest degree their
task of giving.
Therefore, if students complain of produc
tions which only the cast and technicians can
appreciate, they have some basis for a gripe
at being deprived of their rightful role in every
performance. If the "scientific" attitude were
carrid to its bitter extreme, an empty house
would be the ideal of the dramatist. Then,
without having to bother to explain his work
to a theatrical dull audience, he could revel in
the magnificent lighting change in Act 11,
Scene IV.
Lord knows, the taste of audiences needs to
be raised. But when the Department stops to
provide fare for the groundlings, no apologies
for a prostitution of its artistic concept need
be offered. We fear no more the possibility of
receiving a steady, and deadening, diet of such
obvious drama. That era is past. But when we
begin to miss some of the hard ones on the bill
of-fare, toss us a couple of easy plays as breath
ers, Mr. Department.
We'll take the chance you offer on this double
bill, and puff plenty before taking the next lap
in pursuit of an ability to appreciate fine drama.

SLIPPED into the production schedule of the
Department of Speech and Drama is a
double bill of one-act plays. The comment of
Director H. Miles Heberer was that the two were
chosen primarily "to entertain Stanford stud
ents," to remove the bad taste in the mouth of
campus theater-goers after "The Governor's
Wife."
This, it seems to me, is magnanimous of the
Department. When students complained that
"Murder in the Cathedral" was over their
heads, they were told that one of the chief pur

the taste of theater audiences to the point where
