# Mix and Stir Gently

THREE professors and unknown quantities of
students, doughnuts, and conversation will
be mixed this afternoon in the latest experiment
of the committee on student-faculty relations.
1 he committee has arranged an informal bull
session in the nitery, designed to bring students
and professors together on somewhat equal
terms instead of across that academic spite
fence, the lecture desk. It is hoped that when
faculty and students meet o.n neutral ground,
they will find something to talk about besides
the tragedy of the last term paper, and the bear
raid on the grade point market.
As the chemistry department will gladly dem
onstrate, almost anything can happen in an
experiment; and the outcome of this project is
about as predictable as the reactions of a co-ed
to a kiss. If it fails there will be one more sad
little martyr's grave marking the course of stu
dent-faculty relations. If it succeeds, it may
provide a starting point for improving our
present grab-bag system.
The way things stand now, a student has
about the same chance of knowing a professor
as Stalin has of marrying Mussolini's daughter.
It can be done, but it takes quite a bit of
arranging.
teacheis are regarded by their fellows as keep- ■
iiuj rather bad company. The cry of "apple

polisher" is raised on the campus as often as
the cry of "witch" in old Salem, and with much
the same results. A man may need Listerine
The professors are more tolerant. They per
mit a colleague to collect students as another
man might collect stamps. But they seem to
regard it as a waste of time that could be spent
much hetter digging into the reaction times of
the water louse. Why bother with students
when God has given us water lice?
Of course, Stanford has managed to get along
this way for some time, and it isn't likely that
the Quad will crumble if we don't change at
once. But every so often we meet a man tak
ing correspondence courses; and we have a
nasty time explaining what we get that he
doesn't.
If the committee can do anything to estab
lish communications across the gulf between
undergraduates and faculty, it will do more for
Stanford than the best half-back that ever got
his name in six-inch type. It would be nice to
know a professor as something other than a
text-book wired for sound.—J. C.

If the committee can do anything to estab
lish communications across the gulf between
undergraduates and faculty, it will do more for
Stanford than the best half-back that ever got
his name in six-inch type. It would be nice to
know a professor as something other than a
text-book wired for sound.—J. C.
THREE professors and unknown quantities of
students, doughnuts, and conversation will
be mixed this afternoon in the latest experiment
of the committee on student-faculty relations.
1 he committee has arranged an informal bull
session in the nitery, designed to bring students
and professors together on somewhat equal
terms instead of across that academic spite
fence, the lecture desk. It is hoped that when
faculty and students meet o.n neutral ground,
they will find something to talk about besides
the tragedy of the last term paper, and the bear
raid on the grade point market.
As the chemistry department will gladly dem
onstrate, almost anything can happen in an
experiment; and the outcome of this project is
about as predictable as the reactions of a co-ed
to a kiss. If it fails there will be one more sad
little martyr's grave marking the course of stu
dent-faculty relations. If it succeeds, it may
provide a starting point for improving our
present grab-bag system.
The way things stand now, a student has
about the same chance of knowing a professor
as Stalin has of marrying Mussolini's daughter.
It can be done, but it takes quite a bit of
arranging.
teacheis are regarded by their fellows as keep- ■
iiuj rather bad company. The cry of "apple

polisher" is raised on the campus as often as
the cry of "witch" in old Salem, and with much
the same results. A man may need Listerine
The professors are more tolerant. They per
mit a colleague to collect students as another
man might collect stamps. But they seem to
regard it as a waste of time that could be spent
much hetter digging into the reaction times of
the water louse. Why bother with students
when God has given us water lice?
Of course, Stanford has managed to get along
this way for some time, and it isn't likely that
the Quad will crumble if we don't change at
once. But every so often we meet a man tak
ing correspondence courses; and we have a
nasty time explaining what we get that he
doesn't.
