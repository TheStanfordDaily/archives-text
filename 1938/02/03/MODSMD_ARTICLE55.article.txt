# BULL SESSION
## HENRY SACHS GOES MARCHING ON 
### 
IT SEEMS there was some difficulty in New York
Tuesday, some difficulty about the President's "100
small businessmen" agreeing with one another on what
they wanted to talk about when they reached the
White House.
But there was no difficulty in the mind of Henry
Sachs.
'The group had been exhorted by Henry Sachs, one
of its leaders, to 'holler like hell' in Washington."
HeTiry Sachs was in no doubt about what he was
going to do. He knew. Henry Sachs planned to
holler like hell, and constructive action and the chance
to resuscitate business and go out the window for all
he cared.
If it were not for the fact that Henry Sachs repre
sents an American characteristic much too dangerous
to be funny, he might be dismissed as an ill-mannered
little toady from the sticks. But he is far more than
than. Henry Sachs is a symbol. Not any old symbol,
but the sort of symbol which every dictator might very
well enshrine on his mantlepiece. It is from Henry
Saqhs—or his cousins—that most dictators, coming in
at the death of democracy receive their power.
Henry Sachs is the great I Want. Henry Sachs sees
in the President's conferences with business and labor
only a vast grab-bag, full and overflowing with every
thing that Henry Sachs wants, free for the hollering
and his for the taking.
* * * *
President expects his conferences to lead to
something constructive. Idealistists think they may
be pointing the way to a new form of co-operative
democracy. These fine points don't bother Henry
Sachs. He's going to holler like hell.
For the Henry Sachses of America, in short—and
there are a great many of them, in Congress, in state
legislatures, in business and in labor—the nation ex
ists for what they can get out of it. Co-operation
means nothing. Democracy means nothing. "The
greatest good for the greatest number" is an empty
phrase, and to its pleasant, but meaningless, sound
they will holler themselves to destruction.
Henry Sachs may be only a temporary phenomenon
of twentieth century U. S. A. America has been dom
inated by self-interest before, and it may possibly be
dominated by self-interest again.
But America lives in an age of great egotists today,
and the influences which act against democracy are
too well-organized for her to risk the sort of self
interest Henry Sachs represents. To have orderly
progress within an orderly society, self-interest must
be based on a strong social conscience, or it must not
be at all.
Henry Sachs obviously doesn't know this; and when
he finds it out it may be too late. He may wake up
some day to find himself goose-stepping with every
body else.
And he probably won't be able to holler like hell,
either.—Allen Drury.
