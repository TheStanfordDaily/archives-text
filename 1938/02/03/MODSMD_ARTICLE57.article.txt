A S CONGRESS today prepares to pass new appro
priations for military purposes and as youthful
idealists talk seriously of intervention in a foreign war,
the alignment of a significant and distressing historical
parallel becomes more obvious.
America faces the world today almost precisely as
it did in 1916 and 1917.
In those two years these things were happening:
American opinion was uniting against an aggressor
nation which had taken the lives and property of an
innocent people. We were fed a stream of propaganda,
and we began to identify a people with the acts of a
military machine.
We began boycotts, for our adversary was a com
peting industrial nation; we avoided contact with the
"offending" nationals.
Congress and the President agreed on staggering
totals for military expansion. They insisted that the
armament is "defensive" and then drew plans to con
vert the merchant marine into potential carriers for
troops going "over there."
Flattering statements were issued that the ship
building program would put .steel back to work. Steel
is a basic industry, they argued. When it prospers,
everyone prospers.
The rallying cry was "Preparedness." Democracy
was in danger. Rights of American nationals were
zealously guarded.

Change the dates to 1938. Substitute Japan for
Germany and China for Belgium. The parallel is then
complete.
We went to war in 1917 proudly and with the flush
of prosperity. If we go to war in 1938 we will go on a
burst of inflation, hiding a crippled economy. We are
