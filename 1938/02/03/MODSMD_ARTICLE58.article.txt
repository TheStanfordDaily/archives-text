In "Five-Star Final" without
much skill and a good many missed
cues, a Stagers' cast last night pelt
ed each other with Weitzenkorn's
over-ripe melodrama of the tab
loids.
Now Time, the grim reaper and
great thief, skips with the gold plate
off'the best of plug drama. Such
is true of "Five-Star Final." Once
sure-fire theater, its indictment now
is passe. In these days when leg art
finch; its way into the "Police Ga
zette," and no one but the Chicago
Tribune takes life seriously enough
to editorialize in a front-page head,
grist for newspapers pours in from
the Far East, from Spain, and from
the big three—Hitler, Stalin, and
Mussolini. Small private scandals
are pretty generally buried in third
page captions.
As for the cast—able as Phyllis
Lakin proved in the role of Nancy
Voorhees Townsend, tragic victim
of a "yellow sheet," there is pied
casting somewhere along the line
when Onyet Watson is fated to call
her "mother." As a matter of fact,
every player gave theatergoers a
somewhat foolish feeling—an expe
rience comparable to shaking hands
with an empty glove; every player
was at least three sizes too small
and a decade too young for his part.
However, Nick Alexander as
Ziggie Feinstein, cheap contest edi
tor; Ralph Parr, as sanctimonious
Parson Isopod, Sunday editor; and
Shirley Jones, as Miss Taylor, boost
ed "Five-Star" stock by three not
able points.
All told, less than 15 cents worth
of effort went into Stagers' reading
last night. —Slater
