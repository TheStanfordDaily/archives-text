# Groundhog Says Spring Is Here
## 
### 
Keep your uvercoat another week,
your umbrella two weeks, perhaps,
then sell them. Spring is nearly
here.
The proverbial ground hog came
out of his hole yesterday on Ground
Hog Day and failed to see his
shadow, proverbial or not proverbial.
That is the proof that spring is
nearly here. That is the proof that
Lake Lagunita didn't fill up early
this year. It's proof that the old
adage, "April showers bring May
flowers," will be moved up to late
February this year.
