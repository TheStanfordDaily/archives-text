students than the usual banquet, and
that it would also fulfill a long
needed want, that of some type of
entertainment after basketball
games.

Cal students with the Jamboree have
been made by George Chalmei's,
who will be in charge of directing
the visitors to the gym from the
Pavilion.
Purpose of the Jamboree is to stir
up student interest in the traditional
Junior Prom, which will be swung
to Fletcher Henderson's orchestra
Friday, February 11. Tickets for
the Prom will soon go on sale at
$3, 50 cents less than last year's
price. Henderson recently signed a
contract to do arranging for Bennie
Goodman.
