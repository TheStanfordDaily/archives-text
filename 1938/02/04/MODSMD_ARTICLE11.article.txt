### 
Interviewing varsity and freshman football players will take up most
of his time while at Stanford, said Edwin G. Atherton, former San Fran
cisco graft investigator, who arrived here yesterday for a week's stay.
Employed by the Pacific Coast Conference to investigate sources of
financial aid to athletes, Mr. Atherton is making a preliminary tour of Coast

colleges, already having visited Uni-<
versity of Southern California, U.C. I
L.A., and University of California, j
"Entirely Confidential"
"I'm just here now to get ac
quainted and get a general picture of j
the Stanford athletic setup," he said. !
"My next visit will probably last a I
month."
The fdrmer G-man emphasized
the fact that his investigation is en
tirely confidential, "The only way
to get the facts is to assure people
they will not be made public," he
said.
Declaring that he has been mis
understood and misrepresented by
Bay Area newspapers, Mr. Ather
ton said the purpose of the investi
gation is merely to collect facts,
upon which the Conference will
base more reasonable and practical
rules.
Just Getting Facts
"Our inspection is not punitive in
any way whatsoever," he said. "We
are not trying to embarrass any
donor, athlete, or institution. I am
just the field representative of the
conference, gathering and assem
bling facts."
Mr. Atherton is working under a
conference committee, of which
Professor William B. Owens of
Stanford is a member.
