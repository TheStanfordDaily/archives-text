WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP). â€”
Senator Robert F. Wagner (D., N.Y.)
said in the Senate today the Consti
tution presents no obstacles to the
anti-lynching bill but in fact "makes
it the implied duty of the Federal
Government to take reasonable
steps" to stop lynchings.
The coauthor of the bill, which is
threatened by filibuster, presented
the first argument in its defense.
