# Palo Altan Recalls Farm's Beginning
## 
### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
A racehorse decided the present
site of Stanford!
It's not a very generally known
fact that surveyors wanted to build
the University where the stock farm
now stands, because the elevation
was better, but. that because Sena
tor Stanford wanted that plot for his
racehorses, the present site was se
lected.
It sounds far fetched, but it's true
because Harry Reinhart says so, and
he was there! Mr. Reinhart, who is
79 years old, came here in 1883,
when there was no Palo Alto, no
Quad, no University.
"It was all pasture land," he says,
"and Mr. Stanford used it for his
racehorses. He was a fine man—Mr.
Stanford--couldn't be better."
Mr. Reinhart worked on Mr. Stan
ford's stock farm for many years.
After the University was built, he
worked in the nursery for 25 years,
retiring after an automobile acci
dent. He has been confined to his
bed for a great part of the last 10
years.
"Palo Alto was named for a
champion horse," he asserted yes
terday. "I have a picture of him in
the garage."
The picture hangs on the wall of
a locked, empty shed. It is a sketch
of a beautiful black horse, the cross
bred Palo Alto, whose sire was a
trotter, and whose dam was a run
ner. This horse held the world's
record of 2.8 :, : i and was considered
the greatest racehorse in the Stan
ford stables, according to Mr. Rein
hart.
"When Mr. Stanford decided to
build the University, he said to Tim
othy Hopkins, 'You buy that lard

from Seal and we'll call it Palo Alto
after my horse'," reminisced Mr.
Reinhart.
"There's nobody around here who
knows more than I do about the
starting of Palo Alto and Stanford,''
he said. "I saw it all grow from a
pasture land and an alfalfa field."
"Mr. Stanford died before the
chapel was completed and they
held services in the Inner Quad and
put his body in the mausoleum he
had built for his son. The Stan
fords used to live where the Con
valescent home now is."
Mr. Reinhart remembers that
Highway 101 was just a dirt road.

and alfalfa waved in the breezes
over the present site of Thurlow's,
the railroad station, Beltramo's and
points north, south and east.
Palm Drive grew from the first
small roadway to the University.
The palm trees are California palms
and are replaced as they die. The
trees require practically no water,
but the bushes around them must
be watered. The reason that the
palm trees die is because gophers
creep up from the roots and eat out
their hearts.
"Dr. Jordan loved the palm trees.
Once the University wanted to dis
continue them and plant something
else, but Dr. Jordan wouldn't let
them."
"The earthquake did a lot of dam
age on the Quad," says Mr. Heinhart.
"There used to be a big tower with
tour clocks on the chapel. They'd
chime for the different hours. The
earthquake knocked it down and it
was never replaced,"
Living at 315 Lytton Avenue, he
recalls that the property next dooV
to him, which he owns, was once
rented by the Delts, and later by the
Sigma Chis, before there were fra
ternity houses on the campus.
"They didn't use to be so par
ticular about who they took at the
University." remarked with a
grin. "They took anybody they
could get. Now the grades have
gone up and up. Mr. Stanford used
to say h<? wanted the University to
be the best iti the world, and I guess
it's on its way." •
Surprisingly active for his 7!) years
and precarious health, Mr. Remhart
says, "I'd be working out there yet,
if it hadn't been for that accident."
