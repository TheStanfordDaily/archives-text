# Came Rooters To Celebrate At Jamboree
## 
### 
With their voices hoarse from the I
joyful cheers of victory and the mut- j
tered reminiscences of defeat, stu- |
dents from Cal and Stanford to
night will parade up to the Women's
Gym for the Jamboree following
the basketball game. I
Leading the torchlighted parade
to the Gym will be Kappa Alpha's
madman, Ben McGuire, who will
also be master of ceremonies dur
ing the entertainment later in the
evening.
All-University Affair
'This is going to be an all-Uni
versity affair, ' declared Dave Ryus,
president of the junior class, which
is sponsoring the Jamboree, "and we
are not going to break tradition even
though it is a date affair. First we'll
go to the game, then get our dates,

and then go to (he dance."
At the Gym, students will dance
to the music supplied by Hal Barnes'
orchestra, and look and listen to a
program arranged by Betty Davis
and Jack Laney, co-chairmen of
the Jamboree Committee.
Gaieties Stars To Appear
Featured on the entertainment
program will be stars from the Big
Game Gaieties. The Zook twins
have worked up a little number,
and Larry Randall will team with
Cedric "Scat" Pihl, U.C. Mask and
Daggers ace, in one of their original
skits.
Vocal honors will be handled by
Pat Bernard, newly discovered
songstress of the Tri Delts, and there
is a possibility that Bob Forbes and
Tony DeGrassi, piano duet and
Gaieties composers will appear.
First Jamboree
This is the first year that the jun
ior classes from Cal and Stanford
have united in a Jamboree Jim Lo
gan, Cal Fiji, has created consider
able interest on the Berkeley campus
over the Jamboree. He was given
his information by George Chal
mers who presided over a commit
tee composed of Jack Trefts, Deane
Johnson, Sanford Butts, Eleanor
Hatch, and Edwina Butts.
The purpose of lite Jamboree will
be to fulfill a long needed want, that
of providing some type of entertain
ment to the Cal visitors after the
basketball games. Members of the
Junior Executive Committee felt
that the Jamboree would prove
more popular with the students of
the University than a dinner with
Californians.
Prom Interest Raised
Another purpose of the Jamboree
will be that of stirring up enthusi
asm for the traditional Junior Prom
which will be held on Feb. 11. Tick
ets will soon go on sale for $3, 50
cents less than last year's price.
Music for the Prom will be supplied
iby Fletcher Henderson, top-notch
j colored swingster from the Grand
Terrace Cafe in Chicago.
Tickets for the Jamboree are 50
I cents a couple and can be obtained
lon the Quad, in front of the Post
I Office, and at the A.S.S.U. office.
| The committee in charge of the
Jamboree tonight, as appointed by
j Dave Ryus and Jean Fox, consists of
j Jack Laney and Betty Davis, chair
|men; Jayne Copp and H. B. Lee, in
| charge of entertainment.
