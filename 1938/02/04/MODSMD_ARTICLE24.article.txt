# Cards To Meet Cal In Last Chance Tilt
## Hoopsters Set To End Streak Of Bear Wins 
### Harry PRESS 
All skepitcs to the cause of Cap
tain Hank Luisetti and fellow Coast
champions are going to receive the
setback of their lives tonight.
It's Stanford against Cal, and the
Cards are out to show what a team
really can do when it wants to play
ball. Stanford-Cal games are al
ways Big Games, but this year they
are pushing all other southern divi
sion contests into the shadows, be
cause the results of these tilts will
decide the Conference champion
ship.
Team Set To Go
When John Bunn's team booms
out onto the hardwood tonight, Pa
vilion patrons will see the quintet
that has won the Pacific Coast Con
ference title for the past two years;
that has knocked over with ease the
pick ol Eastern and Mid-Western
teams during two barnstorming
tours; and a quintet that has sur
prised basketball fans and experts
all over the country with its failure
to mop up the southern division so
far this season.
And when Nibs Price's Bears walk
onto the court, the same patrons will
see the team that amazed the same
fans and experts with its ability to
win games not one loss has the Cal
quintet sustained in Conference
play, and they're on top of the heap.
Quintet Trains For Cal
Stanford's hoopsters have been
preparing this week especially for
Cal — not merely developing syn
chronization of play in order to win
any game that comes along, but
working on defense tactics designed
for the Bear style of offense alone.
Figuring, that the best way to stop
the Cal "weave" by sending one
man to break it up, Dr. John has de
vised a type of defense which re
sembles a "flying wedge"—except
it's stationary.
Luisetti Moves Up
Captain Hank moves out in front,
about two yards back of the center
circle, which gives him plenty of
chance to intercept one of the sev
eral passes employed in the "weave."
The other four Stanford men are
placed around the foul circle, where
they can intercept any long passes
which may come their way.
As to offense, Dr. John has altered
the Card fast break, so that the
Laughing Boys now cut all over the
court, instead of running fast and
straight.
Cal Starters Unchanged
The live men who will wear the
Blue'n'Gold are the same ones who
got hot from way out. beyond the
foul circle a certain disastrous Fri
day night not so long ago.
Starting at center, Chet Car
lisle will attempt to continue flip
ping the ball in from the most awk
ward positions imaginable. Some
thing like Luisetti, except that Hank
really means it.
Forwards Ed Dougery and Bob
i Chalmers will help out by passing
j the ball around, and working in for
ian occasional short shot. Bob
I Garetson and Lew Goldenson are
studying hard right now, trying to
learn how to stop the Card fast
break, and Garetson will do a little
overtime work, standing way out
and firing away at the basket.
Leading subs are Lee Hunt, Maur
ice Lilot, and Bill Biggerstaff, all of
whom will probably see plenty of
action.
Enough has been written already
describing the Card five. All that
can be said now is that if the week's
practices are any indication, they
are going to play a game of basket
ball that would massacre any team
in the land.
Referees for the colossus tonight
will be that übiquitous pair, Lloyd
Leith and Ernie Bailly. Bailly will
replace Art Ross, whose previous
connections with Nibs Price caused
Graduate Manager Al Masters to
arrange the substitution.
Tomorrow night, the Indians will
met U.S.F. in the Pavilion. Coached
by Wally Cameron, the Dons' start
ing line-up will be Baylacq, Fran
uschi, Jaeger, Knifsend, and Guinee.
Starting time is 8 o'clock both
nights.

out onto the hardwood tonight, Pa
vilion patrons will see the quintet
that has won the Pacific Coast Con
ference title for the past two years;
that has knocked over with ease the
pick ol Eastern and Mid-Western
teams during two barnstorming
tours; and a quintet that has sur
prised basketball fans and experts
all over the country with its failure
to mop up the southern division so
far this season.
And when Nibs Price's Bears walk
onto the court, the same patrons will
see the team that amazed the same
fans and experts with its ability to
win games not one loss has the Cal
quintet sustained in Conference
play, and they're on top of the heap.
Quintet Trains For Cal
Stanford's hoopsters have been
preparing this week especially for
Cal — not merely developing syn
chronization of play in order to win
any game that comes along, but
working on defense tactics designed
for the Bear style of offense alone.
Figuring, that the best way to stop
the Cal "weave" by sending one
man to break it up, Dr. John has de
vised a type of defense which re
sembles a "flying wedge"—except
it's stationary.
Luisetti Moves Up
Captain Hank moves out in front,
about two yards back of the center
circle, which gives him plenty of
chance to intercept one of the sev
eral passes employed in the "weave."
The other four Stanford men are
placed around the foul circle, where
they can intercept any long passes
which may come their way.
As to offense, Dr. John has altered
the Card fast break, so that the
Laughing Boys now cut all over the
court, instead of running fast and
straight.
Cal Starters Unchanged
The live men who will wear the
Blue'n'Gold are the same ones who
got hot from way out. beyond the
foul circle a certain disastrous Fri
day night not so long ago.
Starting at center, Chet Car
lisle will attempt to continue flip
ping the ball in from the most awk
ward positions imaginable. Some
thing like Luisetti, except that Hank
really means it.
Forwards Ed Dougery and Bob
i Chalmers will help out by passing
j the ball around, and working in for
ian occasional short shot. Bob
I Garetson and Lew Goldenson are
studying hard right now, trying to
learn how to stop the Card fast
break, and Garetson will do a little
overtime work, standing way out
and firing away at the basket.
Leading subs are Lee Hunt, Maur
ice Lilot, and Bill Biggerstaff, all of
whom will probably see plenty of
action.
Enough has been written already
describing the Card five. All that
can be said now is that if the week's
practices are any indication, they
are going to play a game of basket
ball that would massacre any team
in the land.
Referees for the colossus tonight
will be that übiquitous pair, Lloyd
Leith and Ernie Bailly. Bailly will
replace Art Ross, whose previous
connections with Nibs Price caused
Graduate Manager Al Masters to
arrange the substitution.
Tomorrow night, the Indians will
met U.S.F. in the Pavilion. Coached
by Wally Cameron, the Dons' start
ing line-up will be Baylacq, Fran
uschi, Jaeger, Knifsend, and Guinee.
Starting time is 8 o'clock both
nights.
All skepitcs to the cause of Cap
tain Hank Luisetti and fellow Coast
champions are going to receive the
setback of their lives tonight.
It's Stanford against Cal, and the
Cards are out to show what a team
really can do when it wants to play
ball. Stanford-Cal games are al
ways Big Games, but this year they
are pushing all other southern divi
sion contests into the shadows, be
cause the results of these tilts will
decide the Conference champion
ship.
