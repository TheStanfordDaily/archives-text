# Students Bull, Drink Cider With Professors
## 
### 
Marking a definite step in the
progress of relations between Stan
ford's students and faculty, the first
in a new series of informal meetings
between professors and students
was held yesterday afternoon in the
Nitery.
Professors Elmer D. Fagan,
Charles N. Reynolds, and Theodore
H. Boggs were the centers of dif
ferent groups of students. Students
dropped in for a few minutes, wan
dered from one group to another,
and decided to stay until 6 o'clock.
About 40 students attended the bull
session, taking part in the different
discussions, eating doughnuts, and
drinking cider.
Many Topics Discussed
The discussion ran the gamut of
topics, covering politics, economics,
books, travel, labor, and presidents,
among others. One group found that
one of its members had been in
Iceland. There followed a discus
sion of Iceland, Greenland, and the
Arctic regions. Dr. Boggs, more
popular with men bull sessioners,
stayed on serious subjects, such as
the effect of strikes on labor and
economic relations of Canada with

the United States and Great Brit
ain.
Sex did not "rear its ugly head,"
as is the case in a large number of
bull sessions, but discussion in Pro
fessor Fagan's feminine group cov
ers the new marital relations course.
According to Jean Bird, chairman of
the Student-Faculty Relations Com
mittee, "The plan seems to meet with
the approval of the students, judg
ing by the reactions of those who
attended. We hope to have more
meetings of this type in the future."
More Meetings Planned
These informal afternoon meet
ings are part of a general program
of faculty-student contacts which
are being planned by Miss Bird. An
other part of the program is Sunday
evening gatherings at different pro
fessors' homes.
The first of the evening meetings
will be this Sunday at Professor
Hazel D. Hansen's apartment in
Kingscote. There is still room for
a few students to sign up on the list
in the A.S.S.U. office in order to
attend the discussion in Miss Han
sen's home.
