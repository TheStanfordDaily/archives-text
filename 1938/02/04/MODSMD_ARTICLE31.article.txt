# Trade Confab Ends In Chaos
## 'Little Businessmen' Present Resolutions 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP). -
The two-day congress of "little busi
nessmen" ended today on the same
disorderly note on which it began,
after two noisy delegates had been
ejected and resolutions had been
steamrollered through demanding
tax relief, a balanced budget, and
loans to small industry,
A 10-man committee worked to
night to whip the resolutions into a
rounded program which will be
presented to President Roosevelt
tomorrow. The chief executive in
vited the "little" business men and
women here to suggest ways to com
bat the trade recession.
Many of the resolutions are sharp
ly critical of the New Deal and of
Mr. Roosevelt's attitude toward
business. They were jammed
through without debate and with
only a rising vote shortly before
Chairman Fred Roth, Cleveland, 0.,
wholesale shoe dealer, adjourned the
first congress of "little business."
Earlier, A. S. Shafter, Philadel
phia building contractor, who was
ejected from the conference yester
day, and Robert Kaempfer. self
styled "forgotten man" delegate
from New York, had been removed
from the room by guards.
