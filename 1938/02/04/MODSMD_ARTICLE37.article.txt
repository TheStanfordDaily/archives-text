J. P. Cahii has been chosen to
fill the gap left in the cast of "Blue
Jeans" when Paul Crary, Stagers'
president, was forced to withdraw
because of excessive work, it was
learned yesterday from Director
Hal Kahn.
Crary, a law school graduate, had
been cast in the role of "John Kirk,"
but found that he could not spare
the time to rehearse the part. A
veteran of many Stager productions,
he was the last of the "Koyal Fam
ily" of Stanford dramatics of a short
while ago, which included the
names of many past Farm stage fa
vorites.
Scored in 'Murder'
Cahn, who has gained recognition
through his directing of Farm plays
and readings, made his first appear
ance on the stage this fall and is re
membered in the role of "Thomas a
.Beckett," the bishop, in the produc
' ion. "Murder in the Cathedral."
Stagers also will lose a valuable
member, Gene Cailon, technical di
rector for all Farm shows during
the last two years, when he turns
over the light switches to a suc
cessor after the "Blue Jeans" per
formance. Callnon's job has been
to design and build all of the stage
sets, and to supervise all of the
lighting. An experienced electrician,
he worked all summer on the light
ing system of Memorial Hall.
Schreiber Plays Lead
Geraldine Schreiber, a prominent
Stager who is credited with many
excellent performances, plays the
feminine lead in "Blue Jeans" op
