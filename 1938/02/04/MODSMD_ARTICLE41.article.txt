# Hitler To Oust Von Blomberg
## Dictator Seeks New German War Minister 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 3 (UP).â€”Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler held a long conference
today with General Walter Von
Reichenau, commander of the Sev
enth German Army Corps in Ba
varia, heightening reports that
Reichenau may be named either War
Minister or Commander-in-Chief of
the Army.
Hitler, faced with an open breach
in long-brewing antagonism be
tween conservatives of the Army's
high command extremist Nazi poli
cies, was said to be anxious to find
a successor to War Minister Werner
Von Blcmberg with the least pos
sible commotion.
Persistent reports that Colonel-
General Werner von Fritsch, Com
mander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr
armies who protested recently
against Baron Blomberg's marriage
to 25-year-old Erika Gruhn, also is
about to quit his post brought up
Reichenau's name as his successor.
In that event Col. Gen. Hermann
Wilhelm Goering, Hitler's right
hand man and administrator of
Germany's four-year economic plan,
might be named W;ir Minister.
Despite many rumors it appeared
tonight that Baron Fritsch. opposed
to Baron Blomberg's marriage to a
girl of humble origin in defiance of
Army traditions, has not even been
considered for the War Ministry
post.
