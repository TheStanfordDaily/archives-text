### 
HONOLULU, Feb. 3 (UP), Two
hundred students of Roosevelt High
School went on strike today, ab
senting themselves from classes in
protests to several school practices.
The strikers objected to a $2 stu
dent fee and also asked revision of
the student body constitution, free
track and basketball uniforms, and
an accounting of student funds. The
strike was short-lived, the students
soon returning to their classes after
difficulties had been adjusted.
