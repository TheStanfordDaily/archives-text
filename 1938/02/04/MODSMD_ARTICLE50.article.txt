ITS FOR KEEPS TONIGHT,
NO FOOLIN'
When the Card basketball varsity
trots out onto the Pavilion floor to
night it is going out with only one
thought in mind—hand these amaz
ing California Bears a trouncing.
At the start of the season it was
generally conceded that Cal was the
third place team this year, with
U.S.C. second and Stanford first.
So far the only thing the dopesters
have right is their brutal relegation
of U.C.L.A. to the cellar. It begins
to look a little as though Carry
Works' Westwood five is going to be
lucky to win a single game.
California, with a well-balanced
offensive team and one of the best
defensive teams Coach Nibs Price
has ever put out in .a long line of
good defensive teams, is making a
brilliant showing in spite of her
supposed chances.
However, it's the honest opinion of
everyone in close contact with Stan
lord's team that, California will have
to show she is the best team on the
Coast if she is to trim Stanford for
tl e second time this season.
It's no secret that the Indians
p!ayed one of their poorest games in
the last three years that horrible
night at Berkeley. Even then Cali
fornia had only the slimmest of
margins, as in all her games in the
conference.
CALIFORNIA SOMEHOW
KEEPS AHEAD
To show what is meant by that,
California has scored 190 points in
winning five conference games. Her
opponents have scored 170, which
mjans that the Bears have averaged
four points better than their op
pments.
Four points wins a ball game just
as thoroughly as 100, but nonethe
less the Bears have been skating
along the margin. Tonight they will
have to put a lot of points on their
side of the ledger if they are to win,
because there is no defense in the
country capable of stopping the
Cards when they are really playing
ball. They'll be playing tonight.
Stanford has a margin of 09 points
in five games, scoring 281 points to
the opposition's 212. That's almost
14 points per game better, on the
average, than the opponents, yet
Stanford has lost two in five. Stan
ford has been up and down, Cal has
been uncommonly steady.
Stanford, after looking miserable
against Cal and then St. Mary's the
night following, went south last
v/eek and showed the Los Angeles
fans the type of basketball they have
come to expect of the Luisetti-led
Cards.
They were hot, they were consist
ent, and they looked like the Indians
of old. They have regained their
equilibrium lost when the tension
got too great three weeks ago, and
there'll be fireworks tonight. The
Cards are going after Cal, not the
conference title, tonight, and that is
significant.—Petersen.
