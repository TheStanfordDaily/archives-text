# Papooses, Cubs Set for First Tilt
## Gorter Men Favored In Cal Opener Frosh Preliminary Expected To Match Varsity Main Event 
### 
The Little Big Game!
In a game that .should match the I
vai'sity tilt, play by play, point by 1
point, for thrills and excitement
Stanford's Papooses will tangle with j
California's Bear cubs in a prelim- !
inary to the mair game. The battle
between Coach Wytze Gorter's j
young Indians and Coach Bill Hig- [
gins' immature Bears will start at |
(5:30 o'clock.
Cal, coming fast after an inaus- j
picious beginning, is a slight under
dog in I he bett ing but the Berkeley- !
ites arc confident that the fi*osh can j
upset the Papooses just as the var- 1
sity did Stanford's big boys the last j
time they met.
To Pour On Steam
Stanford has a different idea on ,
the subject. Realizing that the
Bear cubs are pointing all their
resources toward them, the players
are set to pour on the steam tonight
and run up an impressive win. Al
though Bill Masters, substitute
guard, is still in the hospital with
the flu, Don Williams, ace Stanford
forward, has shaken himself of the
cold that handicapped him last
week-end and will enter the game
in first-class shape.
Coach Bill Higgins of Cal, who is
an ink salesman in his spare time, j
has decided that he doesn't like the :
idea of selling himself red ink all i
the time and thinks that now is the ,
time to start himself on a shipment
on the credit side of the ledger.
Former Proxies Play
One sidelight of tonight's game |
will be the sight of two former Oak- !
land High School student body pres
idents opposing each other, when
Don Williams, Red forward, runs up
against Henry Steinbach, Blue ;
guard, who is one of the stars of the |
Cal attack. Al Darian, another I
sharp-shooting defense man, will :
probably start opposite Steinbach j
for the Higginsmen. Carl Olson and j
Al Cameron should also see plenty I
of action in the back court for Cal. j
Froom At Pivot Spot
Fay Froom will be in the Blue
and-Gold's pivot spot when the game j
starts. Froom is a dandy shot from j
anywhere around the foul circle and j
is strong defensively, to boot. |
Berkeley is counting on him to ef- !
fectively handcuff Don Burness. '
Bell is Froom's first reserve.
Probable starters at forward
against the Indians tonight are Jack !
Rogers and Freeman Dill, with Art :
Flegal set to relieve either one of !
them. Dill, short, pudgy deadeye, j
is the scoring star of the northern !
team and a great point-gathering |
duel should ensue between him and \
Mike Marshall, Stanford's diminu- :
tive pot-shot artist. Rogers is an i
experienced floor man while Flegal '
is practically as good as either of
the top two.
Same Team To Start
Coach Gorter will send his usual
first string against the Bear cubs.
Williams, a splendid all-around
player will open at one forward op
posite Marshall, the team's high
scorer. Don Burness will open at
center while the crucial guard spots
will go to Kenny Davidson and Bill
Niccolls. Davidson and Niccolls
have displayed remarkable defen
sive prowess and Davidson is an ex
cellent, shot. Niccolls spends half
his time throwing himself all over
the floor in pursuit of loose balls,
but the mere fact that he's on the
first string proves that he gets them.
Tomorrow night at the same time
Stanford's yearlings match shots
with the freshman maple artists
from SF.U. Not much is known
about the Dons but they usually put
out rugged teams and Coach Goiter
expects them to put up a stiff brawl.

week-end and will enter the game
in first-class shape.
Coach Bill Higgins of Cal, who is
an ink salesman in his spare time, j
has decided that he doesn't like the :
idea of selling himself red ink all i
the time and thinks that now is the ,
time to start himself on a shipment
on the credit side of the ledger.
Former Proxies Play
One sidelight of tonight's game |
will be the sight of two former Oak- !
land High School student body pres
idents opposing each other, when
Don Williams, Red forward, runs up
against Henry Steinbach, Blue ;
guard, who is one of the stars of the |
Cal attack. Al Darian, another I
sharp-shooting defense man, will :
probably start opposite Steinbach j
for the Higginsmen. Carl Olson and j
Al Cameron should also see plenty I
of action in the back court for Cal. j
Froom At Pivot Spot
Fay Froom will be in the Blue
and-Gold's pivot spot when the game j
starts. Froom is a dandy shot from j
anywhere around the foul circle and j
is strong defensively, to boot. |
Berkeley is counting on him to ef- !
fectively handcuff Don Burness. '
Bell is Froom's first reserve.
Probable starters at forward
against the Indians tonight are Jack !
Rogers and Freeman Dill, with Art :
Flegal set to relieve either one of !
them. Dill, short, pudgy deadeye, j
is the scoring star of the northern !
team and a great point-gathering |
duel should ensue between him and \
Mike Marshall, Stanford's diminu- :
tive pot-shot artist. Rogers is an i
experienced floor man while Flegal '
is practically as good as either of
the top two.
Same Team To Start
Coach Gorter will send his usual
first string against the Bear cubs.
Williams, a splendid all-around
player will open at one forward op
posite Marshall, the team's high
scorer. Don Burness will open at
center while the crucial guard spots
will go to Kenny Davidson and Bill
Niccolls. Davidson and Niccolls
have displayed remarkable defen
sive prowess and Davidson is an ex
cellent, shot. Niccolls spends half
his time throwing himself all over
the floor in pursuit of loose balls,
but the mere fact that he's on the
first string proves that he gets them.
Tomorrow night at the same time
Stanford's yearlings match shots
with the freshman maple artists
from SF.U. Not much is known
about the Dons but they usually put
out rugged teams and Coach Goiter
expects them to put up a stiff brawl.
The Little Big Game!
In a game that .should match the I
vai'sity tilt, play by play, point by 1
point, for thrills and excitement
Stanford's Papooses will tangle with j
California's Bear cubs in a prelim- !
inary to the mair game. The battle
between Coach Wytze Gorter's j
young Indians and Coach Bill Hig- [
gins' immature Bears will start at |
(5:30 o'clock.
Cal, coming fast after an inaus- j
picious beginning, is a slight under
dog in I he bett ing but the Berkeley- !
ites arc confident that the fi*osh can j
upset the Papooses just as the var- 1
sity did Stanford's big boys the last j
time they met.
To Pour On Steam
Stanford has a different idea on ,
the subject. Realizing that the
Bear cubs are pointing all their
resources toward them, the players
are set to pour on the steam tonight
and run up an impressive win. Al
though Bill Masters, substitute
guard, is still in the hospital with
the flu, Don Williams, ace Stanford
forward, has shaken himself of the
cold that handicapped him last
week-end and will enter the game
in first-class shape.
