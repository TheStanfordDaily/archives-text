lIEADLINERS IN THE annual interclass swimming championships in Encina Pools this afternoon include
the six stalwarts grouped around Coach Nort Thornton. At the extreme left is Frank Weeden, sensational
frosh backstroke star. Lower left is Roy Vitousek, another freshman and winner of the trophy for best all
around swimmer in his class. Above him glaring to the right is Chuck Wiper, freshman freestyle star.
Glaring right back is Winfield Needhain, junior distance, while at the lower right is Dave Rider, senior dis
tance man. Roy Winkleman, extreme right, will be overwhelmingly favored to take the diving for the
juniors. Coach Nort Thornton, barking through his traditional megaphone in the center, will be chief judge
and timer for the meet. (Photos by A. Anderson, Daily Staff Photographer.)
