# Interclass Swimming Meet To Be Held Today
## 
### 
Rain or shine the annual interclass swimming meet gets under way at
3:15 o'clock this afternoon in Encina Pools.
The favored junior class will be headed by Win Needham, Dick Clarke,
and John Brahtz in the free style events, Don Towne and Bill Hatch in the
breast stroke.. Hal Weatherbe is their back stroke entrant.. Hatch also is

slated to swim in the 400-yard free-<
style relay. Roy Winkleman, Coast
champ diver, is another third-year
entrant.
Frosh Strong
A small but exceedingly strong
frosh aggregation should gather in
a few points before the swim is over.
With Roy Vitousek, who has already
beaten both Clarke and Brahtz, as
well as Bill Weeden, the backstroke
ace, and Chuck Wiper, the yearlings
plan on taking second place ranking
at the least.
Dark horse entrant is the senior
team. With Marshall Letteau (not
Al) out to win over Weeden and a
completely unknown diver in Ray
Fremlin, the seniors stand a good
chance of surprising.
Letteau Fast
Letteau has been a consistently
fast back-stroke man for three sea
sons, but has confined himself to
relay events before this year. Frem
lin has been working out steadily
under Myron Sprague and may bring
home the second-place bacon. Capt.
Dave Rider in the distance swims,
Mel Jacoby, and possibly Jack Vi
bert should come in for their share
of points.
The sophomores probably will
have to content themselves with
what points the other classes leave,
inasmuch as their team is small and
not very speedy.
