# White Sox Clarify Off-Season Moves
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 3 (UP).â€”Clar
ence (Pants) Rowland, right-hand
man of President P. K. Wrigley, to
day swept aside the mantle of mys
tery enveloping the Chicago Cubs
these many months and clarified
the club's baffling off-season moves.
Rowland, who piloted the Chicago
White Sox to the world's champion
ship in 1917, is listed on the Cubs'
directory as "scout,' but owner
Wrigley, in a campaign t-o hoist his
team to National League suprem
acy, has made him an "ambassador
without portfolio." When another
club wants to talk trade with the
Cubs, Rowland is the man to see. In
addition he has other duties which
transcend the usual scouting rou
tine.
