# Ruggers Start Title Drive Tomorrow
## Farm Squad To Go South For Games Two Tilts Scheduled; U.C.L.A. Match May Deride Championship 
### 
Stanford's 18-man rugby squad
leaves Palo Alto tonight on the Sun
set to fulfill two week-end engage
ments, one with the U C.L.A. Bruins
;it Los Angeles Saturday and the
second wHh Santa Barbara State
College, Monday night at Santa
Barbara.
Coach Jim Wylie took advantage
of a break in the weather yesterday
afternoon to put his men through
their first real workout in a week.
Since last Thursday, rugby practice
sessions have been limited to in
formal limbering up drills and yes
terday's one hard scrimmage.
Bruins Strong
The opening Bruin line-up, stud
ded with stars from Coach Bill
Spaulding's 19.'i7 football aggrega
tion, includes eleven regulars and
four reserves from last year's squad
which lost but one game, a fc-5 deci
sion to Stanford, and finished second
to the Indians in the Pacific Coast
Conference race.
Stanford will open with a team
which includes only nine men from
last year's championship fifteen. The
Indians, however, will present a
well balanced line-up composed of
a poweiful front line and a light,
speedy, "pony" backfield.
Rccords Favor Cards
In comparative records thus far
Stanford has slightly the edge,
boasting a 27-0 swamping of the
Argonaut Club and a 3-3 tie with
the strong University Club. U.C.L.A.
has played and won only one game
against a lesser opponent before en
tering tomorrow's all-important
contest. The result is expected to
tell the tale in the P.C.C. race, as
the Bruins are eo-favorites with
Stanford to annex the title.
Stanford men making the trip arc:
John Partridge, Mitch Boyd, Jack
Wright, Wayne Richardson. George
Ditz, Dave Carnahan, Bill Harring
ton, Marv Taylor, Karl Schaupp,
Maurice Musy, Woodward Bohosksy.
Kay McMurray, Ken Peters, John
Pauly, Lyman Calkins, Chad Reade,
and Primo Pinotti.
