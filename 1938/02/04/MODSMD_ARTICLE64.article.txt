# Rain May Postpone Frosh Nine Opener
## 
### 
Every indication seems to point !
to the fact that the freshman ball
game with Santa Clara frosh this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock will have
to be postponed. Wet weather and
a soggy field present a stymie that
will probably win out. However, j
there is still a chance that the sun
will stay out long enough to allow
the ground to dry.
Practices have been cut for the last
three days on account of the rains.
Workouts in the gym have kept the
players in condition, and in all prob
ability the team will be in good form I
for the game tomorrow—should it
. be played.
Probable Lineup Told
In event of a game, the battery !
will probably be Thompson and At
kinson, with Tucker at first. Pfyl
| seems to have an edge on the pivot
1 sack, and Bull will most likely stan
| at short. The race between Boone
i and South for third base is a close
; one, but Boone seems to have the
i nod because of his heaves to first.
! In the field, Ruth will see starting
j action, as will McCloud. Johannes
| sen looks like the other starter, with
| two or three right at his heels. These
three are a well clicking combina-
I tion and should go places, but they
: have four more good ball players
1 trying to take their jobs away from
i them, and by no means have a cor
; ner on the starting lineup.
Schedule Completed
The schedule for the season has
been completed. Twenty games have
i been signed up, with three big tilts
I with the Cal cublets coming late in
! April. All games will be played on
j the Farm frosh diamond except for
i two out of three at Berkeley. One
j more game with San Jose Frosh is
j tentative, and may be played.
As now arranged, there will be a
I 25-day lay-off between the game

immediately preceding spring vaca
tion, and the first game after it. Al
though it does not look likely, a few
encounters away from home may be
arranged for this period to keep the
boys in trim.
