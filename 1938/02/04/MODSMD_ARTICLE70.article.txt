# We Like the Ride

IN THE adjacent column, Mr. Anonymous
has put basketball on the go-cart and has
taken it for a long, long ride. Along the route,
he has picked up the players, the coaches, the
referees,' and Stanford students.
Chief theme of the answer to "What's it all
about?" seems to be that no one knows, but
who cares, anyhow? The only fallacy is
simply that, absurd or not, lots of people care,
and in an insanely big way.
The day of school spirit has passed with
turtle-necked sweaters and the "plug-ugly."
But though the core is gone, the structure about
which school spirit draped its colors remains.
Frankly, we'll go to the game tonight as we
do to all others —to yell our throats ragged, to
gripe at the refereeing, to eat peanuts, to
scream "That's the time you got 'em, Hank!",
to throw our arms about and get red in the
face—to experience the emotional orgy which
only mass hysteria can bring.
But it wouldn't be the show it is without
having a purpose, a reason to yell: to see your
team win, to see Stanford take Cal. You might
get the same effects if you watched two unfa
miliar teams in action, but we doubt it. We
know we wouldn't.
And after all, this is the game that counts.
The "laughing boys" have dropped two games,
and Cal rides on their high horse of undefeat.
This is the last chance lor a flying leap at the
conference title.
Sure, we'll forget all about it the next day;
we'll go right on muddling through mid-terms,
and go canoeing on the lake. But, Mr. Anony
mous, if the whole show doesn't raise your
pulse ten degrees, it's because you haven't any
pulse.
We'll admit that we can sit down right now
and remember the second U.S.C. game this
year without popping open our collar. But when
we think of ihe conference title at stake tonight,
we'll take a ride on your go-cart. We may
be suckers to bother about the whole thing,
but the intentional emotional pushing around
we're going to give ourselves in the Pavilion
tonight is worth it.—J. S.

do to all others —to yell our throats ragged, to
gripe at the refereeing, to eat peanuts, to
scream "That's the time you got 'em, Hank!",
to throw our arms about and get red in the
face—to experience the emotional orgy which
only mass hysteria can bring.
But it wouldn't be the show it is without
having a purpose, a reason to yell: to see your
team win, to see Stanford take Cal. You might
get the same effects if you watched two unfa
miliar teams in action, but we doubt it. We
know we wouldn't.
And after all, this is the game that counts.
The "laughing boys" have dropped two games,
and Cal rides on their high horse of undefeat.
This is the last chance lor a flying leap at the
conference title.
Sure, we'll forget all about it the next day;
we'll go right on muddling through mid-terms,
and go canoeing on the lake. But, Mr. Anony
mous, if the whole show doesn't raise your
pulse ten degrees, it's because you haven't any
pulse.
We'll admit that we can sit down right now
and remember the second U.S.C. game this
year without popping open our collar. But when
we think of ihe conference title at stake tonight,
we'll take a ride on your go-cart. We may
be suckers to bother about the whole thing,
but the intentional emotional pushing around
we're going to give ourselves in the Pavilion
tonight is worth it.—J. S.
