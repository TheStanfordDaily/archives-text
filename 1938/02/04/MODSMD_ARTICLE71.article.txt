# Drive with Care
## 
### 
FRUSTRATION, clad in shining constitution
al armor, leaned over the shoulder of
campus officialdom last week when Axe So
ciety started its fund drive. Several student
leaders wondered if the campaign was as
sweetly guileless as it professed. Several oth
ers wondered how long Stanford could play
fairy godmother to questionable causes without
overdrawing its magic.
But there was nothing they could do about
it. Under the present constitution, any organi
zation that wants money can pass the hat as
long and as often as an elastic self respect will
permit. With this in mind, Ex Committee next
week will seek some way to check the alarm
ing birth rate among the lower classes of
campus drives.
If the committee can work out a practical
plan, it will get Stanford out of a situation that
would give a conservation expert a nervous
breakdown. Under the present set-up, any cam
pus organization that needs another figure on
its bank balance can think up a good slogan
and start phoning house-managers. Stanford
thus finds itself building cash foundations un
der air castles of suriealistic architecture.
This in itself is an annoying state of affairs,
but even more troublesome is the drain on
campus contributions. We have several tradi
tional drives which hallowed custom pledges
us to support. The Red Cross asks its annual
tithe. The Convalescent Home comes around
every spring. Campaigners to the contrary,
Stanford does not possess a private mint. Its
charity and good nature are definitely limited;
and when it gives to one drive, it takes from
another.
When we start exploiting the Stanford mine
with a dozen petty campaigns, we work it
beyond the well-known point of diminishing
returns. Then the legitimate drives find a flint
hearted campus that makes Scrooge look like
a wastrel.
Probably the best suggestion for improve
ment is that a joint student-faculty committee

supervise all campaigns. An arrangement of
this sort worked during the last decade, but
was buried in one of the constitutional earth
quakes that marked the passing of that era.
Ex Committee is hardly qualified to decide
which drives shall be permitted. Il finds enough
trouble handling its present tasks, and if it took
on an additional responsibility, its pacing would
probably ruin the committee-room carpet. But
a committee would have time to investigate and
judge, and would represent both faculty and
students.
If that can't be arranged, perhaps the gov
ernment could be persuaded to classify us as
wild animals and establish a closed season.â€”
