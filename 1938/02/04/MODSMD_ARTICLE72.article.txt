is a very good game; it takes only
five men to play the game, which is a saving on
alumni scholarship budgets.
The idea of the game is to put the ball through
tJie hoop. Sometimes the team laughs while they
are trying to put the ball through the hoop. They are
then called "laughing boys," and everyone think.s it is
fine that they can have so much fun playing a game,
until they lose one. Then everyone thinks they are
a lot of slap-happy eggs who had better take up
knitting.
During the game the players sometimes bump into
each other. They also sometimes hold a player's
arms, or stand on his feet when he is about to leap
into the air to catch a ball. The referees do not
like this and they blow a whistle. Sometimes they
get breathing too hard while following the game,
and thoy blow the whistle anyhow. Then they think
hard and wave their arms to the scorekeeper, which
means they have thought up a foul to call on some
one.
The -audience does not always like this, and they
make uncouth noises and say to the man on their
right, "Throw him a fish." This is considered very
scathing, but the referee does not hear it and blows
his whistle very soon again anyhow.

Stanford has some fellows who are very good at
this game. They have beaten lots of other peopl?,
only sometimes they get laughing too hard, and they
do not beat anyone.
Everyone wants Stanford to win tonight, because
if they do not, Stanford is not going to do very
well in the conference. While the team is losing or
winning 993 Stanford students will yell six rahs for
the Stanford varsity. The other seven will have
peanuts in their mouths. Then 119 Stanford students
will yell for the California man on the floor. The
other 881 will have peanuts in their mouths.
If Stanford wins, there will be a great big story
in all the papers about the game, with pictures of
Luisetti. If they lose, there will also be a great big
story in the papers about the game, with pictures of
Luisetti. Also, Stanford will study for mid-terms
next day.
And the team will go on laughing, and Luisetti will
go on making and breaking scoring records, and if
the lake opens let's go canoeing.—Anonymous.

tJie hoop. Sometimes the team laughs while they
are trying to put the ball through the hoop. They are
then called "laughing boys," and everyone think.s it is
fine that they can have so much fun playing a game,
until they lose one. Then everyone thinks they are
a lot of slap-happy eggs who had better take up
knitting.
During the game the players sometimes bump into
each other. They also sometimes hold a player's
arms, or stand on his feet when he is about to leap
into the air to catch a ball. The referees do not
like this and they blow a whistle. Sometimes they
get breathing too hard while following the game,
and thoy blow the whistle anyhow. Then they think
hard and wave their arms to the scorekeeper, which
means they have thought up a foul to call on some
one.
The -audience does not always like this, and they
make uncouth noises and say to the man on their
right, "Throw him a fish." This is considered very
scathing, but the referee does not hear it and blows
his whistle very soon again anyhow.

Stanford has some fellows who are very good at
this game. They have beaten lots of other peopl?,
only sometimes they get laughing too hard, and they
do not beat anyone.
Everyone wants Stanford to win tonight, because
if they do not, Stanford is not going to do very
well in the conference. While the team is losing or
winning 993 Stanford students will yell six rahs for
the Stanford varsity. The other seven will have
peanuts in their mouths. Then 119 Stanford students
will yell for the California man on the floor. The
other 881 will have peanuts in their mouths.
If Stanford wins, there will be a great big story
in all the papers about the game, with pictures of
Luisetti. If they lose, there will also be a great big
story in the papers about the game, with pictures of
Luisetti. Also, Stanford will study for mid-terms
next day.
And the team will go on laughing, and Luisetti will
go on making and breaking scoring records, and if
the lake opens let's go canoeing.—Anonymous.
