# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
PUT IT IN THE TIME SCHEDULE
Student-Faculty Relations Committee
marches forward with all good will from both
groups concerned, inaugurating its first definite activ
ity, the student-faculty bull session. Roughs and pro
fessors talk and discuss, and Stanford democracy takes
a long step in the right direction.
Graders and gradees get a chance In find out that
neither is quite so bad as the other had .supposed.
Students come to the conclusion that the professorial
attitude may, and often docs, conceal a pretty good
Joe. and faculty members realize that a C minus
Bawlout average quite often goes with an A 'plus
brain.
* * * >1*
Unconscious and doubtless undeliberated, however,
is one very significant fact —a fact which has probably
never occurred to the Administration. The bull ses
sion. by far the most educative force on any campus,
has at last received recognition.
Official or unofficial, student-faculty or just stu
dent-student, the fact remains that the bull session
has now been accorded some sort of definite status
in Stanford life; and whether it works out in its
student-faculty form or not —and the difficulty of
bull-sessioning with a student body of 4000 seems to
make that a little doubtful—it has at least arrived.
# * * *
come to school to study, some of them,
k but the great majority come for a combination of
reasons — for studies, good times, for the contacts
they make and the people they meet.
More for the latter than for anything else, I
imagine, are they willing to plank down $115 every
quarter, because they know full well that while they
may not get that much return from Stanford Univer
sity, they will get it from their activities, their
friends, their adventures and experiments in living.
In this field of education, too long neglected by
educators—perhaps because it cannot be dictated and
prescribed, perhaps because it cannot be given a
pop quiz every second Tuesday, perhaps because it is
a tender plant and has to be allowed to just grow like
Topsy—the bull session plays a great and soul-satis
fying part.
♦ * * *
Nothing very worthwhile could come from "Hu
man Relationship Group in World Problems, dhr by
arrangement," but just let someone bring up the
subject about 11 o'clock on a night when you should
be studying and don't want to, and by the time you
go to bed at 3 the whole thing's been solved beauti
fully, you've had four hours of very good talk during
which you've exchanged ideas, found out what people
think and something about how they react, have done
your bit for humanity, and have become just a little
more well-rounded and mature.
Very little of this sort of education can come from
I the system as it now stands. Perhaps the Oxford
I plan comes a little nearer to it, but even there the
| compulsory element makes it far less valuable than a
good, ordinary, down-to-bedrock bull session.
Therefore, all hail the Student-Faculty Relations
Committee, which has recognized the bull session.
| And congratulations to the Administration for at last
j acknowledging the most valuable single educative
1 force in college life.

Unconscious and doubtless undeliberated, however,

never occurred to the Administration. The bull ses

Official or unofficial, student-faculty or just stu
dent-student, the fact remains that the bull session
has now been accorded some sort of definite status
in Stanford life; and whether it works out in its
student-faculty form or not —and the difficulty of
bull-sessioning with a student body of 4000 seems to
make that a little doubtful—it has at least arrived.

reasons — for studies, good times, for the contacts
they make and the people they meet.
More for the latter than for anything else, I
imagine, are they willing to plank down $115 every

may not get that much return from Stanford Univer

friends, their adventures and experiments in living.
In this field of education, too long neglected by
educators—perhaps because it cannot be dictated and
prescribed, perhaps because it cannot be given a
pop quiz every second Tuesday, perhaps because it is
a tender plant and has to be allowed to just grow like

Student-Faculty Relations Committee
marches forward with all good will from both
groups concerned, inaugurating its first definite activ
ity, the student-faculty bull session. Roughs and pro
fessors talk and discuss, and Stanford democracy takes
a long step in the right direction.
Graders and gradees get a chance In find out that
neither is quite so bad as the other had .supposed.
Students come to the conclusion that the professorial
attitude may, and often docs, conceal a pretty good
