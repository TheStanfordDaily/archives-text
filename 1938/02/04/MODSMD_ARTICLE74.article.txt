# CAMPUS OPINION
## OH, JUSTICE! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I be so bold as to ask for a
slight amount of space in your wor
thy columns for the purpose of
bringing up a question or two?
First question: Why all the stew
about Cal basketball tickets? This
seemingly inane question is prompt
ed by another, not so inane: What
kind of an inconsistent policy is the
B.A.C. following in regard to these
tickets?
Big Shot Says:
According to the Big Shot at the
B.A.C. "Students should bear in
mind that rooters' tickets absolutely
are not transferable, even to other
students, and must be returned to
the Board of Athletic Control for
refund if the original purchasers
cannot use them. A rooters' ticket
presented by anyone other than the
original purchaser will be confis
cated as will the student body card."
Now, if said tickets are not trans
ferrable, it is to be assumed that it
is because student body cards have
to be presented with the tickets on
admission to the game and usage of
a card other than one's own for such
purposes is against some rule or
other. Well, how the hell can the
B.A.C. blissfully sit back and sell
more than one ticket to a student?
Why is it permissible for one to
buy a ticket with someone else's
card and not be allowed to get in
the game with it?
"Stick To Rule"
According to the statement of Mr.
Masters, only the original purchaser
can use a ticket to the game. Ob
viously if they are going to stick to
their own rule they will sell only
one ticket to each student. I sup
pose the real spirit of the thing is
that the person who owns the stu
dent body card is the purchaser, be
he present at the time of sale or
otherwise. However, according to
the present state of affairs, one could
lend his card to someone else to buy
a ticket with it and nothing would
be said about it, even though the
girl at the ticket window knew the
card did not belong to the person
buying the ticket.
Of course the purchaser is sup
posed to be getting the ticket for the
one owning the card, however, who
knows for what purpose he is buying
the ticket. Everything is fine then
until the student goes to the game,
then, if he is caught using another's
card he gets kickcd in the pants for
it.
If it is all right to use someone
else's card to buy a ticket with, why
is it not, by the same reasoning, all
right to see the game for him?
Oh yes, and the Ex Committee
says that students should be limited
to buying two tickets each.

until the student goes to the game,
then, if he is caught using another's
card he gets kickcd in the pants for
it.
If it is all right to use someone
else's card to buy a ticket with, why
is it not, by the same reasoning, all
right to see the game for him?
Oh yes, and the Ex Committee
says that students should be limited
to buying two tickets each.

The Editor, Sir:
May I be so bold as to ask for a
slight amount of space in your wor
thy columns for the purpose of
bringing up a question or two?
First question: Why all the stew
about Cal basketball tickets? This
seemingly inane question is prompt
ed by another, not so inane: What
kind of an inconsistent policy is the
B.A.C. following in regard to these
tickets?
Big Shot Says:
According to the Big Shot at the
B.A.C. "Students should bear in
mind that rooters' tickets absolutely
are not transferable, even to other
students, and must be returned to
the Board of Athletic Control for
refund if the original purchasers
cannot use them. A rooters' ticket
presented by anyone other than the
original purchaser will be confis
cated as will the student body card."
Now, if said tickets are not trans
ferrable, it is to be assumed that it
is because student body cards have
to be presented with the tickets on
admission to the game and usage of
a card other than one's own for such
purposes is against some rule or
other. Well, how the hell can the
B.A.C. blissfully sit back and sell
more than one ticket to a student?
Why is it permissible for one to
buy a ticket with someone else's
card and not be allowed to get in
the game with it?
"Stick To Rule"
According to the statement of Mr.
Masters, only the original purchaser
can use a ticket to the game. Ob
viously if they are going to stick to
their own rule they will sell only
one ticket to each student. I sup
pose the real spirit of the thing is
that the person who owns the stu
dent body card is the purchaser, be
he present at the time of sale or
otherwise. However, according to
the present state of affairs, one could
lend his card to someone else to buy
a ticket with it and nothing would
be said about it, even though the
girl at the ticket window knew the
card did not belong to the person
buying the ticket.
Of course the purchaser is sup
posed to be getting the ticket for the
one owning the card, however, who
knows for what purpose he is buying
the ticket. Everything is fine then
until the student goes to the game,
then, if he is caught using another's
card he gets kickcd in the pants for
it.
If it is all right to use someone
else's card to buy a ticket with, why
is it not, by the same reasoning, all
right to see the game for him?
