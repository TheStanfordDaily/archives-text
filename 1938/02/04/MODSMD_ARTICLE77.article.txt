# The 						Reviewer Picture

It's been only four months since
; people first sat in their reserved
j seats while Mr. Paul Muni awed
I them twice daily by .living "The Life
1 of Emile Zola." Right now it's back
:in Paly showing at the Varsity.
! Soon the hundreds of "Zola" films
| will be back in the Warner studio;
! their silver will be reclaimed for
| successive successes; a master film
I will be filed; a few duplicates will
be floating around in Addis Ababa
! and obscure South American min
ing camps for the next four or five
; years. But right now "The Life of
I Emile Zola" has ended its material
! existence.
Some pseudo-intellectuals will
i gloat over the above account. "See,"
i they will scream with childish glee,
j "Zola was supposed to be a fine
j movie. Look at it now; where is it?"
Like artistic vultures they pounce
| upon the perishability of celluloid
|as an excuse for condemning the
; movies. Why time should be a cri
i tenon of art isn't too clear, but yes-
I terday I accosted people on the
j Quad and asked them if they saw
"Zola" and what they remembered
of it new. Reactions varied from
"I was bored," to "I want to un
cover a scandal." But the average
had Confucius' saying planted, un
consciously perhaps, in his own phi
j losophy: "It is not the truth which
makes men great but men who
make truth great." â€”Zelver

The body of William Shakespeare
I has never been disturbed since he
was buried in Stratford.
