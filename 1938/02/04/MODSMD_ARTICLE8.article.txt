# Row Council May Offer Scholarship
## Plan Would Replace Cash Award System By Foreign Exchange 
### 
Proposal for the establishment of
an interfraternity exchange scholar
ship was made la*t night by Don
Moulton, president of the Interfra
ternity'Council, at a meeting of the
organization in the Kappa Alpha
house.
According to Moulton, a tentative
plan to replace the Bruce Macon
Tarver Memorial Award, which is
given yearly to the fraternity house
that records the greatest scholastic
improvement, was drawn up by the
Interfraternity Council Board of
Control Wednesday evening. The
plan has been left with the houses
for revision or rejection and will be
brought up at the next meeting of
the Council.
Change in Cash Award
In emphasizing the need for
change in the present cash award,
Moulton said:
'"The existing Bruce Macon Tarver
scholarship has not fulfilled its pur
pose to stimulate scholastic achieve
ment among house men. It has
practically dropped out of sight."
Conditions for the new scholar
ship as proposed by the Interfra
ternity Board of Control are as
follows:
Tuition fees of both students will
be provided by the Interfraternity
Council here and the foreign univer
isty abroad, but the students will be
expected to provide for their own
transportation expenses and their
spending money while on the schol
arships.
Final Selection
Final selection of the Stanford
representative will remain with the
Interfraternity Council Board of
Control. This board is comprised of
six students, three members of the
faculty, and two alumni. Selections
will be made on the basis of all
around merit.
Each of the 24 fraternity houses
will be permited to nominate one
senior for the scholarship each year.
No one house will be awarded the
scholarship more than once in every
four years.
The foreign exchange student will
live here at the fraternity which
wins the award and sends a man
abroad. He will attend Stanford for
three quarters.
Heidelberg First
If this plan is accepted by the
houses, it has been arranged to send
the first Stanford exchange student
to Heidelberg University in Ger
many next fall. Moulton particu
larly emphasized the fact that there
was absolutely no requirement that
Heidelberg be chosen in the future.
Tentative plans have also been
made to have the Stanford exchange
student live with a German family
designated by Heidelberg. It will
not be necessary for the Stanford
winner of the award to have a
knowledge of German.
