WIN MONEY AND PRIZES
WRITE AN AD!
Can you write a good clothing, dry goods, drug, or institutional advertisement? If you can—and practically anyone can with a little thought
and study—you can win one or more or 22 $5 merchandise orders plus $10 in cash?
Just think a few minutes work and you can pick out $5 worth of choice merchandise from one of Palo Alto's leading stores!
Here show it works. Twenty-two merchants in Palo Alto want to run ads in The Stanford Daily which will appeal to students. They want
new ideas for their ads. They are each willing to give a $5 merchandise order for your service.
The 22 stores are listed below. All you have to do is to go into any one or all of these stores, ask for entry blanks. Find out something about
the product which the merchant wants to advertise. Then go to your room and write a 12-inch ad that will make other students want to buy that
article. Then turn your ads in to the store or The Stanford Daily before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23. On Monday, February 28, the winning
ads and their winners names wil! be published in The Daily. Each of the 22 stores will give a $5 merchandise order for the best ad for their
store, so there will be 22 prizes of $5 merchandise orders.
But that isn t all—the judges will choose the best ad and the writer of that one will be given $10 in cash by The Stanford Daily. Isn't that
worth trying for?
And on top of that, The Daily will give another $10 in cash to some campus living group or eating club of which you are a member. Every ad
entered in the contest counts 5 points for the organization, while the winning ads count for more. Do your part to help win $10 for your group.

WIN MONEY AND PRIZES
WRITE AN AD!
Can you write a good clothing, dry goods, drug, or institutional advertisement? If you can—and practically anyone can with a little thought
and study—you can win one or more or 22 $5 merchandise orders plus $10 in cash?
Just think a few minutes work and you can pick out $5 worth of choice merchandise from one of Palo Alto's leading stores!
Here show it works. Twenty-two merchants in Palo Alto want to run ads in The Stanford Daily which will appeal to students. They want
new ideas for their ads. They are each willing to give a $5 merchandise order for your service.
The 22 stores are listed below. All you have to do is to go into any one or all of these stores, ask for entry blanks. Find out something about
the product which the merchant wants to advertise. Then go to your room and write a 12-inch ad that will make other students want to buy that
article. Then turn your ads in to the store or The Stanford Daily before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23. On Monday, February 28, the winning
ads and their winners names wil! be published in The Daily. Each of the 22 stores will give a $5 merchandise order for the best ad for their
store, so there will be 22 prizes of $5 merchandise orders.
But that isn t all—the judges will choose the best ad and the writer of that one will be given $10 in cash by The Stanford Daily. Isn't that
worth trying for?
And on top of that, The Daily will give another $10 in cash to some campus living group or eating club of which you are a member. Every ad
entered in the contest counts 5 points for the organization, while the winning ads count for more. Do your part to help win $10 for your group.

WIN MONEY AND PRIZES
WRITE AN AD!
Can you write a good clothing, dry goods, drug, or institutional advertisement? If you can—and practically anyone can with a little thought
and study—you can win one or more or 22 $5 merchandise orders plus $10 in cash?
Just think a few minutes work and you can pick out $5 worth of choice merchandise from one of Palo Alto's leading stores!
Here show it works. Twenty-two merchants in Palo Alto want to run ads in The Stanford Daily which will appeal to students. They want
new ideas for their ads. They are each willing to give a $5 merchandise order for your service.
The 22 stores are listed below. All you have to do is to go into any one or all of these stores, ask for entry blanks. Find out something about
the product which the merchant wants to advertise. Then go to your room and write a 12-inch ad that will make other students want to buy that
article. Then turn your ads in to the store or The Stanford Daily before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23. On Monday, February 28, the winning
ads and their winners names wil! be published in The Daily. Each of the 22 stores will give a $5 merchandise order for the best ad for their
store, so there will be 22 prizes of $5 merchandise orders.
But that isn t all—the judges will choose the best ad and the writer of that one will be given $10 in cash by The Stanford Daily. Isn't that
worth trying for?
And on top of that, The Daily will give another $10 in cash to some campus living group or eating club of which you are a member. Every ad
entered in the contest counts 5 points for the organization, while the winning ads count for more. Do your part to help win $10 for your group.

WIN MONEY AND PRIZES
WRITE AN AD!
Can you write a good clothing, dry goods, drug, or institutional advertisement? If you can—and practically anyone can with a little thought
and study—you can win one or more or 22 $5 merchandise orders plus $10 in cash?
Just think a few minutes work and you can pick out $5 worth of choice merchandise from one of Palo Alto's leading stores!
Here show it works. Twenty-two merchants in Palo Alto want to run ads in The Stanford Daily which will appeal to students. They want
new ideas for their ads. They are each willing to give a $5 merchandise order for your service.
The 22 stores are listed below. All you have to do is to go into any one or all of these stores, ask for entry blanks. Find out something about
the product which the merchant wants to advertise. Then go to your room and write a 12-inch ad that will make other students want to buy that
article. Then turn your ads in to the store or The Stanford Daily before 5 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23. On Monday, February 28, the winning
ads and their winners names wil! be published in The Daily. Each of the 22 stores will give a $5 merchandise order for the best ad for their
store, so there will be 22 prizes of $5 merchandise orders.
But that isn t all—the judges will choose the best ad and the writer of that one will be given $10 in cash by The Stanford Daily. Isn't that
worth trying for?
And on top of that, The Daily will give another $10 in cash to some campus living group or eating club of which you are a member. Every ad
entered in the contest counts 5 points for the organization, while the winning ads count for more. Do your part to help win $10 for your group.
