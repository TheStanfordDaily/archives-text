# Ski Club Loses Place on Ballot
## Technicalities Invalidate Petitions For Minor Sports Recognition Vote 
### 
Because they worded their petition wrong, Ski Club members will not
see 011 tomorrow's ballot a space to give minor sport recognition to skiing.
That the A.S.S.U. constitution docs not provide for initiative action to
amend by-laws was given by Professors Marion Kirkwood, dean of the
school of law, and Edwin Cottrcll, political science, legal advisers of the

student body, as the second
for disqualifying the ski petition.
Refutes Action
Refusing action taken last week
by the election committee, the A. S.
S. U. legal experts yesterday ruled
the petition, signed by 500 students,
invalid. They offered, as the only j
solution to the problem, either a |
constitutional amendment clarifying
the status of skiing or an amend
ment to provide for initiative action
to amend by-laws of A.S.S.U. Both
alternatives would require two
thirds majority vote and two-day
announcement in The Daily. In any
case, a special election would be
necessary.
Two precincts, determined by al
phabetical division of the student
body, will be established tomorrow,
Dick Riddell, election chairman, an
nounced. Balloting places wiil be
the Law steps and the Engineering
Corner. Voting must be in ink, by
the mark X. Women alone will vote
for Women's Council positions and
men, for Men's Council berths.
