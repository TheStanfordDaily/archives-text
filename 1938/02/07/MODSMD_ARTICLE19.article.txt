# Steel Producers To Meet C.I.O.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP). â€”
United States Steel Corp. and Com
mittee for Industrial Organization
officials have arranged to meet se
cretly in New York Tuesday to be
gin formal negotiations for renewal
of the collective bargaining agree
ment which the corporation signed
in a surprise move last year, it was
learned tonight.
From reliable sources, however, it
was learned definitely that the con
ferences will be held in New York,
with the actual meeting place secret.
Wages expected to be the major
problem for the negotiators and the
C.1.0. representatives carried with
them John L. Lewis' blunt warning
that labor will resist wage reduc
tions "to the bitter end." This was
in contrast to a statement of Ben
jamin F. Fairless, U.S. Steel presi
dent, that steel companies cannot
co-operate with the Roosevelt ad
ministration's desire for lower
prices without wage cuts.
