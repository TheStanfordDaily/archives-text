# Wilbur Refuses Holiday Shift
## Monday Non-Quota 2:30's Given Women 
### 
Refusing Ex Committee's recom
mendation that the Washington's
Birthday holiday be shifted from
Tuesday to Monday, President Wil
bur announced last night that the
vacation will be observed on Tues
day as usual.
The motion to request the holiday
change was passed unanimously at
last Tuesday's Ex Committee meet
ing on the grounds that women
wanted the extra day to follow their
week-end but stood little chance of
getting Monday overnights.
Late Leave Granted
However, according to announce
ment made by Jean Hemphill, chair
man of Women's Council, last night,
all women will be granted non
quota 2:30 leaves for the Monday
preceding the holiday.
All those, except seniors with an
average of C or more, who wish to
take overnights for that night must
apply to Council. Although these
overnights will not count on the reg
ular quotas. Council asks that they
not be applied for unless absolutely
necessary.
Overnights and all other leaves
taken Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
nights will be counted on the quotas.
Freshmen Must Apply
Sophomore, junior and senior
women may take overnights without
permission Sunday night, but fresh
men must apply to Council. Halls
and houses will close at 10:30 o'clock
Tuesday night as usual, and no spe
cial leaves will be granted.
Since classes will meet on Mon
day Council also asks that all wom
en co-operate with the University
by remaining on the campus for the
holiday if it is possible for them to
do so.
