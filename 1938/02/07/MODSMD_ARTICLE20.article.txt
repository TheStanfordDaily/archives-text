### 
Rex F. Harlow, assistant professor j
of education will speak over KGO
this evening at 9:15 o'clock. He will
present a discussion of his findings
in the Stanford School-Press In- !
vestigation of which he is in charge. [
> "Higher education and the press
are abandoning their old hostility
toward each other," declared Dr. j
Harlow. "The demand for more as- j
sistance of all kinds has made ap- j
parent to higher education that it
must reveal its problems to the pub
lic. The agency to which it has na- j
turally turned is the press, the most j
effective of all the agencies which
could serve in meeting this respon
sibility."
