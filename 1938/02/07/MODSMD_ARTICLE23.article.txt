# 'Laughing Boys' Swamp Cal Five
## Week-End Brings Victory Over Bears, 51-30 Don Defeat 
### 
Hit* Cards were due.. It was Stanford's hall game, and nothing could
have taken it away from the Laughing Boys.
Io the California huskethnll team, it was simply a case of having to
play a scheduled game. They came, they played, they went home —on the
small end of a 62-3.'s score.
Saturday night, the second and first Stanford teams joined forces to

University of San Francisco,
151-30.
Cards Regain Form
Witnesses, who filled the Pavilion's
seats to capacity at the second game
of the 1938 Stanford-Cal basketball
series, saw a Stanford quintet play
the same type of ball game that ha.s
carried the Cardinals to the top of
the nation's list of great hoop
squads, and to two consecutive
Coast Conference championships.
Taking their time, the Indiana
made sure of every move, every
pass, every shot. They were work
ing, with marvelous effectiveness,
every fundamental of the game tha*
Dr. John Bunn had taught them in
practice.
And the spark of it all was Phil
Zonne, playing his best game yet,
making shots count, and best of all,
handling the ball and working plays
as though they were an integral
part of him.
Luisetti Performs
The Master, at his best, demon
strated for all and sundry his ability
to perform to perfection every task
of every department of basketball.
That was Captain Hank Luisetti.
Hank did the unbelievable time
and time again. There was the in
stance where ho shot while falling
away toward the right corner of
the court. Before he hit the ground,
he recovered, tore for the basket,
took the rebound of his own shot,
then sank a short one while going
the other way.
And there was Hank passing,
sometimes not bothering to look, but.
every pass as accurate as they come.
Get 15-Point Lead
The Cards, after Phil Zonne's
basket and free throw, passed Cal's
one-point charity toss start, and
were never headed. In the last 10
minutes of the first half, the Laugh
ing Boys roared out from a 14-11 to
a 28-13 lead at the half-time. Two
points for the Bears in 10 minutes.
The second period saw them put
on even more steam to pile up leads
of 22-, 25-, and after 12 minutes of
play, a 29-point margin. That 22-
point lead, incidentally, was reached
just three minutes after the start of
the second half. The count was
37-15.
California played only fair ball,
far below the pace it has been set
ting to stay on top of the southern
division. Chalmers turned in the
best performance for the Bears with
Carlisle following right behind. Gar
retson got a bit excited, and Gold
enson couldn't stop Hank for all he
was worth, which wasn't very much.
Seconds Play Dons
Against U.S.F., Dr. John started
the second team, which held its
own against the Dons during the
first half. Luisetti, who came in
five minutes before the end of the
half, was the only first stringer to
see action in the opening period.
The entire first string, however,
started the second half. They im
mediately pulled away from the
short end of the 23-22 half-time
score, and the Dons never threatened
again. In fact, U.S.F. made only
seven points in this half.
Outstanding for the Dons was A1
Baylacq, smallest man on the court
— including Bcebs Lee.
