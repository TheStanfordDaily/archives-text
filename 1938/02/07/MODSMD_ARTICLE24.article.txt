# Setting the Stage for Mr. Atherton
## Alumni Groups Give Athletes Financial Aid 
### 
When Axe Society started a drive
for four scholarships for athletes
last week it did more than irritate
a few unwilling and involuntary
donors. It brought up the old ques
tion of how athletes come to Stan
ford and how they finance them
selves while here, so providing a
grand entrance for Edwin N. Ath
erton, field representative and sur
vey maker extraordinary for the
Pacific Coast Conference.
For, soon after Axe Society had
successfully concluded its drive, Mr,
Atherton arrived on the campus
Thursday to interview freshmen and
varsity football players. His pur
pose is to find the amounts and
sources of their financial aid.
His Business
Far from wishing to tell the for
mer G-man his business, The Daily
is printing the following stories be
cause it believes that events of the
past week will make them of in
terest to campus readers.
In his interviews with frosh grid
men, Mr. Atheiton will find that one
source of income for many is the
University's dining hall, Encina
Commons, and he will find that many
varsity players hash. But he will
find one expense item on the play
ers' budget that is peculiar to Stan
ford players. In only one other uni
versity, U.S.C., in the conference is
tuition charged, and there some
scholarships are provided directly
from the southern counterpart of
the B.A.C.
Balancing Budget
How this item is balanced by the
men who do not dig from their own
pockets is an interesting story. Some
of it is printed in that invaluable
compendium, the Bawlout. Most of
it is available for anyone who asks.
But the machinery that puts the
names in the Bawlout, the men who
run it, and their attitudes is not so
apparent.
Below Daily writers view the pic
ture from several angles.
