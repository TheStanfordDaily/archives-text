# Buck Club-- New, Potent
## 
### 
Though a comparative newcomer
on the scene, the Tiny-Buck-of
the-Month Club is one of the most
potent and effective means of arm
ing athletes for their quarterly visit
to the Comptroller's window. Also
it is the one organization that pro
vides scholarships for athletes only.
To reduce the comparative ad
vantage held by other conference
schools, Stanford coaches four years
ago suggested to prominent alumni
that a new means of helping needy
athletes with their tuition could be
devised.
Club Results
The result was the Buck Club,
with membership open to alumni
and others interested in Farm ath
letics, who would contribute one
dollar a month, $12 a year. At the
present time, 850 such members are
enrolled, according to James Howell,
Atherfon resident and official Buck
keeper of the Club.
Of these, 15 per cent are not Stan
ford graduates, 20 or ,'K) are students.
Howell is a graduate of Annapolis.
Prominent members of the club in
clude President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Registrar J. P. Mitchell, and Bill

Hunter, director of athletics at U.S.C.
Scholarship candidates are nomi
nated by Coaches John Bunn, Tiny
Thornhill, Dick Templeton, and
Harry Wolter who submit their
choices to Howell in preferential or
der. Howell and his committee of
Henry Hauser, '16, and Murray
Draper, '28, then examine the appli
cations filed by the candidates them
selves, and interviews each in order
to insure definite need of financial
aid. If scholarships are given with
out financial need present, students
receiving such awards will be barred
from conference competition under
the new ruling.
After interviews are made, tuition
scholarships are automatic ally
awarded from the coaches' lists un
til the financial supply is exhausted.
Twenty-six such scholarships were
given last quarter.
Return Favor
In return for contributions, Buck
of-the-Month Club members are
accorded one slight favor. Each
year, 2000 Big Game tickets are set
aside at the regular price with Club
members given first opportunity for
their purchase.
Axe Society's aid to the Club in
supplying scholarships follows the
precedent set several years ago by
the Block S Society, who provided
athletic scholarships from finance
drives. In other schools, similar
groups also aid in giving financial
aid to athletes.

Scholarships are also provided by
individual donors, to finance par
tially, or in full, the cost of a Stan
ford education. Many of these
awards are anonymous; at Stanford
many students are on such scholar
ships whose financial sources are un
known to coaches and administra
tion .
Aid Welcomc
Although alumni aid is never un
welcome, difficulties arise when
over-enthusiastic graduate groups
or individuals send students with
promises that "they will be taken
care of," but with no provision for
financing.
When such an emergency arises,
as it has more than once in the past,
hurried attempts are made to "keep
faith with the students," provide for
tuition payments and part-time
work. Financial aid may be derived
from other alumni sources; if the
student is eligible, he may be sent
to the Student Aid Committee,
where he supposedly takes his
chance with the rest of the needy
students.
To Keep Up
As voiced by Tiny Thornhill, chief
reason for alumni support is Ihe de
sire to see Stanford "keep up with
the Joneses." In return for four
years of education, such scholarship
students offer an ability which the
university can, and will use to the
advantage of reputation, building
programs, and an enlarged academic
curriculum. The returns from ath
letics are never realized in full by
the athletes; their skill may help
build gymnasiums, dormitories, ten
nis courts, swimming pools which
they cannot use themselves.
Opposed to this view of financial
aid based purely on athletic ability
is the attitude that scholastic con
siderations should come first in
awarding scholarships. Should the
student be too poor to come without
a scholarship, possession of athletic
skill should be no magic charm to
solve an unfortunate problem.
