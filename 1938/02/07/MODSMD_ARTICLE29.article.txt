# Student Aid Also Helps Non-Athletes
## 
### 
Striking at the larger problem of
Student aid, Stanford seeks to pro-
I vide tuition scholarships to needy
| students regardless of athletic ability.
Organized with the aid of alumni
cooperation, the Committee on Stu
dent Aid draws on three sources of
income: Students, 8.A.C., and alum
ni. Student aid is obtained through
i the contribution of 50 cents of the
i "extra" Spring Quarter dollar,
I amounting to about $1700. In addi
i tion. Book Store profits are added to
j the Committee's fund—a total of
from $4800 to $fiooo annually.
B.A.C. Contributes
Five thousand dollars is contrib
: uted by the Board of Athletic Con
! trol, and the balance of the $18,050
which was given in scholarships last
year, is made up from alumni dona
tions.
In choosing students to whom
scholarships are awarded, the degree
of need is the primary consideration
!of the Committee. Factors in de
' termining need are the resources
' from which the student may draw—
; family, loans, and work. All stu
j dents must be partially self-sup-
I porting to be eligible for a tuition
! award. The Committee also seeks to
1 prevent students from overloading
I themselves with debt.
C Average Or Better
Bawlout averages must not be be
j low a C average, but students whose
j scholastic record enables them to
j try for a competitive scholarship are
not eligible for Committee aid. The
[ student's situation in relation to his
scholastic goal is considered; those
! who start school with little prospect
of partial self-finance are discour
aged from attempting the struggle.
Athletes seeking Committee schol
arships are given no special consi
deration, except that in two equal
cases of need, the amount of time
spent on athletics which might be
| spent in work is taken into account.
The lower limit placed on the
i scholastic record gives rise to a cur
j ious situation where a premium on
! low grades is placed on athletes
j seeking financial help. Such stu
dents may obtain an alumni or a
Buck-of-the-Month Club scholar
ship with no grade restriction, while
they are ineligible for Student Aid
without fulfilling the minimum
grade requii'ement.
