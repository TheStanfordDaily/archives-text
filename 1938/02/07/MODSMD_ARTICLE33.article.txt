# Baseball Games Again Rained Out
## 
### 
Old Jupe Pluvius frowned, and
once again leaden skies and marshy
diamonds kept Stanford's baseball
nines from action over the week
end.
The varsity continued its run of
hard luck. Saturday's wash-out en
counter with the Elks Club of Ala
meda was the third consecutive can
cellation. After winning their open
er with the Oakland Athens Club,
5-2, and dropping one to the Gad
dini All-Stars by the same score,
they were forced to dismiss their
last two tilts, with the Kenealy Seals
and San Francisco Postmen, because
of continued rains.
Both Card nines will see action
early this week, however, if the de
iuge ceases. The big boys will meet
the Greyhound Bus gang Wednes
day, here in the sunken diamond.
The frosh will try to talk the weather
into letting them open against the
Marin J. C. outfit on the freshman
diamond the afternoon before.
