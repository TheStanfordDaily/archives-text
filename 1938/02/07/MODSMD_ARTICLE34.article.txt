# Olympic Champion Acts As Judge
## 
### 
Perched under a big yellow um
brella at (he interclass swimming
meet was Pete Desjardins, former
Stanford student and Olympic div
ing champion, back home again after
an exhibition professional tour
which included South America and
Hawaii.
Desjardins dodged (he hail stones
long enough to act as a judge in the
diving competition. He was accom
panied by Claudia Eckert, one-time
woman's champion, and Ernie
Brandsten, Stanford's high mogul of
water sports. The inclement weather
probably prevented Roy Winkleman
and other divers from putting on
a better show for their illustrious
visitor. \
The possibility of a Desjardins ex
hibition in Encina Pools has not yet
been determined although both (he
swimming coaches and the B.A.C.
may announce such a performance
in the next few days.
The Midway Islands, though 1200
miles northwest of Honolulu, are
considered part of Hawaii.
