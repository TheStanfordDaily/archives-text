# Mystery Girl Capsizes Canoe
## 
### 
When Bill Weeden, Stanford froeh
swimmer, was paddling a canoe on
Lake Lagunita Saturday afternoon
and stopped to pick up a young and
beautiful co-ed who was hitch
hiking from a float, he plunged him
self into a deep mystery,
He also plunged into the lake —
which is deep, too, for this time of
year.
The plunge into the lake came
when the hitch-hiking lass stepped
on the edge of the canoe instead of
the bottom. The canoe tipped over.
Weeden and the hitch-hiker, on the
spur of the moment, went swim
ming.

The mystery is the name of the
hitch-hiker. All the time they were
swimming around waiting for a boat
to come and fish them out, Weeden
wasn't able to find out who she was.
Her name remains a mvstery.
