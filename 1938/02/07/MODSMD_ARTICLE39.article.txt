now THAT
THAT'S OVER
As per announcement in Slants'
last Thursday, California lost her
first conference basketball game of
the year Friday night. That coupled !
with the fact that the Pavilion got 1
through another jam-packed week- j
end without a fire makes everything j
satisfactory.
Of course there were a lot of i
chumps that tried to put over fast J
ones on the lads at the gates Friday !
night, after all (he warnings of the j
8.A.C.. and had their student body j
cards lifted, but that's all right — ;
experience is the best teacher, they j
used to say. Before the evening was |
over the B.A.C. officials had a whole |
pocketful of A.S.S.U. cards, and each
one carries a little moral: When
you can't get a ticket it's smartest
to forget about going.
As far as the basketball team was
concerned, that Cal game was some
thing worthwhile. As thorough a
job by one good team in trouncing
another good team as is conceivable
was turned in by the Cards. They
looked their best of the year—in
fact, they looked like the team of J
last year, when Turner and Moore j
v/ere around. Phil Zonne and Beebs !
Lee, who took that pair's places, |
were rather effective, to say the j
least.
Zonne, who is every bit as good a i
floorman as Turner if he can ever j
get fired up, finally found himself, |
to the chagrin of Cal guards Gar- I
retson and Goldenson. Luisetti, of!
course, was his usual self at the j
other forward, also to the chagrin
of G. and G.
Lee, who seems to play his best
against California, was all over the
floor. The only things that bothered
him were the height advantages
possessed by Chet Carlisle and Bob
Chalmers. They took a rebound
here and there, but Lee didn't give
them anything when it came to gen
eral floorwork. And there wasn't
a man on the Cal team that had his
fight.
One thing the game showed was
that Stanford on a best night is much
farther ahead of Cal than is Cal on
a best night against Stanford. Cal's
first win, 47-44, was no fluke—the
Bears played better ball and they de
served to win.
But at the same time that victory
can't be charged to superior play by
Cal. Nibs Price's boys played their
usual strong defensive game, but
Stanford's offense didn't click. Fri
day night Cal was all right, for a
while, but when they began to look
bad it wasn't because they were do
ing poorly—it was because Stanford
was doing so well.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
Cal people who question the logic of
that little review of cause and effect.
PLAYERS VS. FANS—
WHICH WILL IT BE?
Saturday night Coach John Bunn
started his second team, and not un
til late in the first half did he put in
Luisetti, nor until the second half
the rest of the first team.
The outside customers—not the
students—who plunked down $1.10
to see the first outfit, particularly
Hank, were probably a little steamed
at Bunn's procedure, but there's
much to be said for both sides.
For instance, the U.S.F. game, the
St. Mary's game two weeks ago, and
ihe Santa Clara game two weeks
hence are the only three practice
games during the conference sched
ule. Stanford must win all her con
ference games, and therefore Bunn
can't start his second team.
His only chance to give these sec
onds—who arc going to be his firsts
next year—a little experience under
the fire of starting a game is in
these three practice tilts.
The question is whether basket
ball is being played for fans or for
the sake of seeing which team is bet
ter. One of basketball's virtues is
that it hasn't yet reached the com
mercialization of football, where the
customer's money is getting to be
more important than the players.
That's a paradox of economics,
wherein the superstructure is be
ginning to exceed the foundation.
Something is going to get too heavy
for something else before long in
football, but basketball, thank the
saints, still isn't a three-ring circus.
That closes the lesson for today.

As far as the basketball team was
concerned, that Cal game was some

other forward, also to the chagrin
of G. and G.
Lee, who seems to play his best
against California, was all over the
floor. The only things that bothered
him were the height advantages
possessed by Chet Carlisle and Bob
Chalmers. They took a rebound
here and there, but Lee didn't give
them anything when it came to gen
eral floorwork. And there wasn't
a man on the Cal team that had his
fight.
One thing the game showed was
that Stanford on a best night is much
farther ahead of Cal than is Cal on
a best night against Stanford. Cal's
first win, 47-44, was no fluke—the
Bears played better ball and they de
served to win.
But at the same time that victory
can't be charged to superior play by
Cal. Nibs Price's boys played their
usual strong defensive game, but
Stanford's offense didn't click. Fri
day night Cal was all right, for a
while, but when they began to look
bad it wasn't because they were do
ing poorly—it was because Stanford
was doing so well.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
Cal people who question the logic of
that little review of cause and effect.
PLAYERS VS. FANS—
WHICH WILL IT BE?
Saturday night Coach John Bunn
started his second team, and not un
til late in the first half did he put in
Luisetti, nor until the second half
the rest of the first team.
The outside customers—not the
students—who plunked down $1.10
to see the first outfit, particularly
Hank, were probably a little steamed
at Bunn's procedure, but there's
much to be said for both sides.
For instance, the U.S.F. game, the
St. Mary's game two weeks ago, and
ihe Santa Clara game two weeks
hence are the only three practice
games during the conference sched
ule. Stanford must win all her con
ference games, and therefore Bunn
can't start his second team.
His only chance to give these sec
onds—who arc going to be his firsts
next year—a little experience under
the fire of starting a game is in
these three practice tilts.
The question is whether basket
ball is being played for fans or for
the sake of seeing which team is bet
ter. One of basketball's virtues is
that it hasn't yet reached the com
mercialization of football, where the
customer's money is getting to be
more important than the players.
That's a paradox of economics,
wherein the superstructure is be
ginning to exceed the foundation.
Something is going to get too heavy
for something else before long in
football, but basketball, thank the
saints, still isn't a three-ring circus.
That closes the lesson for today.

used to say. Before the evening was |
over the B.A.C. officials had a whole |
pocketful of A.S.S.U. cards, and each
one carries a little moral: When
you can't get a ticket it's smartest
to forget about going.
As far as the basketball team was
concerned, that Cal game was some
thing worthwhile. As thorough a
job by one good team in trouncing
another good team as is conceivable
was turned in by the Cards. They
looked their best of the year—in
fact, they looked like the team of J
last year, when Turner and Moore j
v/ere around. Phil Zonne and Beebs !
Lee, who took that pair's places, |
were rather effective, to say the j
least.
Zonne, who is every bit as good a i
floorman as Turner if he can ever j
get fired up, finally found himself, |
to the chagrin of Cal guards Gar- I
retson and Goldenson. Luisetti, of!
course, was his usual self at the j
other forward, also to the chagrin
of G. and G.
Lee, who seems to play his best
against California, was all over the
floor. The only things that bothered
him were the height advantages
possessed by Chet Carlisle and Bob
Chalmers. They took a rebound
here and there, but Lee didn't give
them anything when it came to gen
eral floorwork. And there wasn't
a man on the Cal team that had his
fight.
One thing the game showed was
that Stanford on a best night is much
farther ahead of Cal than is Cal on
a best night against Stanford. Cal's
first win, 47-44, was no fluke—the
Bears played better ball and they de
served to win.
But at the same time that victory
can't be charged to superior play by
Cal. Nibs Price's boys played their
usual strong defensive game, but
Stanford's offense didn't click. Fri
day night Cal was all right, for a
while, but when they began to look
bad it wasn't because they were do
ing poorly—it was because Stanford
was doing so well.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
Cal people who question the logic of
that little review of cause and effect.
PLAYERS VS. FANS—
WHICH WILL IT BE?
Saturday night Coach John Bunn
started his second team, and not un
til late in the first half did he put in
Luisetti, nor until the second half
the rest of the first team.
The outside customers—not the
students—who plunked down $1.10
to see the first outfit, particularly
Hank, were probably a little steamed
at Bunn's procedure, but there's
much to be said for both sides.
For instance, the U.S.F. game, the
St. Mary's game two weeks ago, and
ihe Santa Clara game two weeks
hence are the only three practice
games during the conference sched
ule. Stanford must win all her con
ference games, and therefore Bunn
can't start his second team.
His only chance to give these sec
onds—who arc going to be his firsts
next year—a little experience under
the fire of starting a game is in
these three practice tilts.
The question is whether basket
ball is being played for fans or for
the sake of seeing which team is bet
ter. One of basketball's virtues is
that it hasn't yet reached the com
mercialization of football, where the
customer's money is getting to be
more important than the players.
That's a paradox of economics,
wherein the superstructure is be
ginning to exceed the foundation.
Something is going to get too heavy
for something else before long in
football, but basketball, thank the
saints, still isn't a three-ring circus.
That closes the lesson for today.
—Peterson.
