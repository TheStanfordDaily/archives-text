# Frosh Cagers Take Twin Victories
## Bears, Dons Easy Marks For Cards Second String Shows Promise In Handing Cal 42-20 Drubbing 
### 
Easy winners over California's
over-rated Bearcub basketball team,
Stanford's frosh hoop squadron
bombed its way through another
duo of victories last week-end in
Pavilion preliminary games.
After swamping the hapless Cubs
Friday night by a 42-20 count, the
Papooses roared back Saturday with
an equally convincing triumph over
the U.S.F. Don frosh, 50-35.
Cal Takes Lead
Cal started out as if it intended
io do great things against Coach ;
Wytze Gorter's powerful Cardinal
frosh. With the game but a few |
minutes under way, Carl Olson,
big Cub guard, drove through a
melee under the Stanford basket to !
pot a set-up and put his team ahead, j
2-0. Don Williams sank a set-up for
the Papooses to tie the score and
then Mike Marshall scored two quick
baskets to put Stanford ahead for
good.
The Papooses played magnificent
basketball the first half. Working
the ball smoothly and confidently, â€¢
they pierced the Cal defense for a I
rapid succession of short shots, and ;
when they were stopped they would
stand out from afar and nonchalant
ly pot long ones. Stanford held a
26-12 lead at half time.
Second Half Slower
The game moved slower in the
second period with defensive tactics
rather than offensive predominating
and both teams shoving in their !
resei ves.
Don Burness, Papoose center, was
easily the outstanding man on the
floor. He gari. ired high-point hon
ors with 12 digits and his rebound
ing off both baskets was spectacular
and effective.
A1 Darian, Bearcub guard, lived
up to all advance notices and was
by far Cal's outstanding performer.
His six points gathered high-point
honors for the visitors and his gen
eral all-around defensive play was
all that kept Coach Bill Higgins'
team from being run right out of j
the Pavilion.
Cal Closely Guarded
Freeman Dill, supposed dead-eye
Bear forward, limited his sharp
shooting to the foul-line, gettting
three digits from that point, although
the official score gave him a bucket
when a Stanford man was penalized !
for hitting the netting on the Cal ]
hoop because he was acting captain
of his team. Don Williams was ap
pointed leader of the Cardinals.'
Saturday night's 50-35 win over
the Dons was more or less an after
math to the "Little Big Game," and
the team for the most part turned
in an uninspired performance. Ken
| ny Davidson snagged scoring hon-
I ors with 13 points, followed by Mar
! shall and Burness with 12 apiece.
