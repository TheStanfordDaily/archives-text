# Juniors Win Swim Contest
## Freshmen Second As Seniors, Sophs Trail 
### 
A strong junior class won the in
terclass swimming honors last Fri
day in a surprisingly thrilling meet.
One event, the 220-yard free
style, was officially a dead heat be
tween Dave Rider and Win Need
ham, in 2:21.2: two others should
have been called ties. Rider was
given first place over Needham in
the 440 in 5:11.2 although a magic
eye photo wouldn't have detected a
gnat's eye-brow between them. In
the 50-yard free-style Dick Clarke
came through in :25.2 to get a close
judge's decision over Roy Vitousek.
While the juniors were piling up
66 points, the frosh gained 44, the
seniors 35, and the sophomores a
scrawny 16.
Bill Weden swam 1:44 in the 150-
yard back-stroke leaving Mason
Letteau and Hal Weatherbe in his
wake. Vitousek beat Clarke clean
ly in the 100 in :57.5 with Johnny
Brahtz close behind.
Don Towne barely aced out Bill
Hatch in the final yards of the
breast stroke.
Rain and hail pelted the divers
into submission and cut down on
their performances. Roy Winkleman
won over Herb Wooley and Ray
Fremlin.
The free-style relay turned into
an anchor man battle between
Clarke of the winning juniors and
Vitousek of the frosh. Both swam
close to :57 flat with Jack Vibert of
the seniors who started out a half
lap behind swimming under :55 to
narrowly miss squeezing in a win.
