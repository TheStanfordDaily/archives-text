## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Ruggers Down U.C.L.A., 12-3 Victory Makes Cards League Favorites 
### 
Stanford's varsity rugby team
successfully hurdled the first and
most difficult obstacle in its quest
for another Pacific Coast Intercolleg
igate Championship Saturday after
noon when it overpowered the U.C.
L.A. Bruins, 12-3, in the Los An
geles Coliseum.
By defeating the Bruins, consi
dered the strongest team in the
Conference at the beginning of the
season and co-favored with Stan
ford to capture the title, the Indians
left themselves in a . commanding
position to retain their 1937 cham
pionship.
The squad left Los Angeles last
night for Santa Barbara where they
will be taken on a sightseeing tour
this afternoon and will meet Santa
Barbara State College in a game to
night under the arc lights.
Standings in the Northern Cali
fornia Rugby Union remained the
same as last week as all scheduled
games were postponed until a later
date because of rain. California and
the Olympic Club shared the lead
with two victories apiece followed
by Stanford and the University
Club, tied for second with one win
and one tie.
