# An Exchange for the Better
## 
### 
CAMPUS oracles had to back water on sev
eral of their best predictions last week
when Interfraternity Council came out of its
customary winter quarter hibernation and pre
sented a plan for an exchange scholarship.
For years on hallowed years past Councils
have retired to quiet slumber on pledge day
and have remained dozing until the pangs of
dirty rushing drove them out in the fall.
But the ripple of surprise that swept over
our local prophets when the Council stayed
up past its bed time turned into a tidal wave
when they discovered its proposal was sens
ible and workable. In substance, the plan is
to award an exchange scholarship with a for
eign university to the house showing greatest
scholastic improvement during the year. In
machinery the plan resembles the Phi Delt
exchange with Heidelberg which has worked
successfully for two years. This system would
replace the old Bruce Macon Tarver award
which consisted of a cash bonus given on the
same basis.
The new plan represents an improvement
that should warm the sad hearts of even the
sourest of our budding cynics. The Tarver
award is backed by purposes noble enough
to be incorporated into the President's Report,
but it lacks the glowing inspiration that gives
eclat to an accounting problem, and finesse
to a paper on intestinal influenza of amoeba.
The award could be used for any purpose, and
the house managers could be trusted to bury
it quietly in an unmarked grave. There is no
percentage in plowing through economics
when you know the results will go toward
a new ice box.
An exchange scholarship may not provide
inspiration in carload lots, but it will make the
award considerably more attractive. When it
comes to romance, Old Heidelberg has quite
an edge on a new furnace. The scholarship will
also make for better international understand
ing, and for better feeling among fraternity
men, and in various other ways will do beau
tiful things to advance us toward the Golden
Age when lions lie with lambs instead of to
them.
But more important even than these contri
butions to sweetness and light and Chester
Rowell is the ammunition which the plan will
give fraternities in their eternal battle with
critics. If adopted, the plan will provide a very
neat answer to the cynics who demand proof
that fraternities are not useless mushrooms on
the great tree that is the University.
Perhaps the Council had this in mind when
it suggested the scholarship. Perhaps it was
just tired of taking up collection to buy some
body else a new shower room. But if it did
see the uses of the plan, it deserves an apology
from every critic who ever coined a counter
feit phrase. In these days when some of us
are smothering "Democracy" to death in an
over-loving embrace, fraternities often have a
nasty time proving that they are not useless
bulwarks of exclusiveness. The exchange
scholarship may make explanation less em
barrassing.
All in all, the scheme has an aura of the
Napoleonic. With such a sense of strategy, the
Council should take a shot of No-Doz and
tackle the Japanese question.â€”J. C.
