# SYNTHETIC GENIUS
## 
### 
complaints have been issued by the gen
tlemen of criticism on the failure of college writing
courses to spawn an army of young geniuses.
They wave a righteous finger at the catalogs of a
modern university listing hundreds of courses in the
technique of literary expression from "The Philosophic
and Social Concept of Writing in Contemporary Life"
to "Abstractions in the formation of Modern Inter
pretative Poetry." They announce that the attendance
for these sessions with the muses has the pro
portions of a community sing. They insist that the
manuscripts received by one faculty member of one
institution during a period of five days would be enough
to paper the walls of the Kremlin, or, if you prefer,
would create a bonfire of sufficient heat to melt all the
snow north of Manitoba. i
Despite all this, the courses have not been fertile
soil for geniuses; in fact, they have only provided a
moderate harvest of hacks.
The critical gentry display an unwholesome respect
lor democratic education. While writing instructors
are too often bewildered Ph.D.'s who wandered into
the wrong profession, one should not demand the im
possible. If a butcher puts baloney into a meat grinder,
he is not surprised when it comes out ground baloney.
If society introduces mediocre writers into the ma
chinery of education, it should not be disconcerted when
they come out mediocre writersâ€”although the medi
ocrity is then of a high caliber. Teachers can only
demonstrate how the tools of self-expression may be
employed with the maximum of effectiveness, but the
student must possess the equipment originally.
It is obvious that writing courses need instructors
specially trained for the work and infected with a zeal
to spread the gospel. But the public has a greater
need for a realistic attitude toward, not only writing
courses, but democratic education in general. Man
now looks for miracles, not from his gods, but I'roni his
colleges. It has been u pleasant delusion.
