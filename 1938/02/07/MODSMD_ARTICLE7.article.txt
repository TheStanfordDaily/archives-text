# Hull Outlines Peace Program
## Armament Reduction Urged For Nations 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP).—
Secretary of State Cordell Hull to
night invited the world to join the
United States in a "determined ef
fort to promote peace and economic
prosperity and said that this nation
stands ready at any time to help
bring about limitation and reduction
of armaments.
At the same time he warned
"have-not' nations—those not self
sufficient economically—that "they
can all too easily be misled into at
tempting to secure by force of arms
what, under stable world conditions,
they would be able to obtain much
more iully through peaceful means."
The cabinet officer's remarks I
came 24 hours after the United
States, Great Britain and France
asked that Japan reveal her naval
building program or agree to limi
tation consultations. The speech
ostensibly was a defense of the ad
ministration's reciprocal trade treaty
program.
Hull tonight said the United States
will continue to exert all possible
moral influence for universal ac- I
ceptance of the principles of inter- I
national law and economic security
through a system of mutually bene- j
ficial trade relations. "Only as such i
international order is firmly estab
lished, as its moral and economic
foundations become strong, will the
hope for lasting peace assume the
aspect of attainable reality," he de
clared.
