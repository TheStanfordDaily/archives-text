Tentative plans for a radio debate
league over station KSFO were an
nounced by Ed Kerr, debate mana
por. yesterday. Five bay area schools
would belong to the league if pres
ent plans are successful.
Besides Stanford, the Universities
of California, San Francisco, Santa
Clara, and San Jose would be rep
resented. Mr. J. C. Morgan of KSFO
is in charge of arranging the setup.
The debates will be in the form of
a round-robin series, he said, with
one meet being held each week for
.'!0 minutes. Although the clashes
will be non-decision, audience polls
will probably be held after each de
bate.
Debate topics and details of the
radio league will be worked out
later if representatives of the five
schools and Mr. Morgan establish
the forensic league.
