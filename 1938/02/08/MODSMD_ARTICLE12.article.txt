# Farm Acclaims 'Winter's Tale'
## Simpson, Farmer Star As Shakespeareans 
### FRANCES SLATER 
By FRANCES SLATER

The Stanford student who will not
balk at the prospect of polishing off
a little extra-curricular culture is
rarer than a Russian novel with a
happy ending. But when Thomas
Wood Stevens presents a bang-up
show like "A Winter's Tale," not all
hLs noble educational aims should
scare away the customers.
There is not a student on the cam
pus who will not be willing to float
for three stream-lined acts on
Shakespeare's serene denial that life
is either real or earnest. The bland
est hokum a playwright ever dished
up with a straight face. "A Winter's
Tale" detours happily into broad
comedy, flat melodrama, and pastoral
romance with a little mother love
thrown in.
Comedy Fresh
In the Speech and Drama produc
tion last night, there was not a
mildewed moment in the whole
play. The comedy was fresh and
unselfconscious, the dramatic se
quences workmanlike and polished.
A shrewd master of the classic
knack, Gary Simpson was a suave
Leontes. Frances Farmer, a good
young actress with enough self-con
trol not to fake a British accent,
proved a noble Hermione and Dan
Holtom and Hal Kahn may be
singled out for lively comedy char
acterizations. Other notable mem
bers of the cast include J. P. Cahn,
and Eloise Lambert.
'Slight Flaw'
Naturally a few minors fell out of
the Eiizabethan spirit and seemed a
bit hot under their Elizabethan col
lars—as awkward in their slashed
breeches as Penrod in the pageant.
But the flaw was slight.
For once, moreover, the costumes
were made not of unbleached mus
lin dipped in Rit, but of real, con
vincing velvet and brocade. Simply
mounted without change of scene,
all three acts rolled on castors.
"A Winter's Tale" runs eVery
night this week except tomorrow
with matinee performances tomor
row at 4 o'clock and Saturday at
2:30.
