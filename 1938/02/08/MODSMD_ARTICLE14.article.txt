### 
After welcoming three newly
I elected members tonight, Ex Com
| mittee will turn to the problem of
j controlling campus finance drives.
Brought to a head by Axe So
! ciety's drive two weeks ago to aid
; the Buck-of-the-Month Club, ard
j by the increasing number of organi
zation appeals to the student pocket
j book, the problem has revealed a
i flaw in the A.S.S.U. constitution,
I which allows no student control on
j money-raising projects.
Committee Suggested
One possible solution to be con
j sidered tonight is the establishment
!ol a student-faculty committee of
six, whose sole duty will be to give
an official sanction to campus fund
drives. Such a committee existed in
the 1920's but has since died out.
Ex Committee will also consider
a "leadership institute" such as was
j conducted last spring under the
guidance of Professor Harold Hand,
associate professor of education.
| Purpose of the institute was to give
j training to student leaders, and to
I consider problems in student gov
i ernment.
Held Discussions
The institute held a series of panel
j discussions open to the entire stu
' dent body, and led by administra
tive and student body officials.
Should the institute be held this
year, compulsory attendance of or
ganization heads would be required.
Looking forward to next fall, Ex
Committee will begin planning the
j freshman pre-registration period
j which has been held for the past
! two years.
All spring quarter dates will be
gi'anted, and Vice President Bar
| bara Murphy has issued the call for
