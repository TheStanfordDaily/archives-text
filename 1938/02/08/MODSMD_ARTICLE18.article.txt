# Props To Work Magic in 'Blue Jeans'
## 
### PARK KIMBALL 
How to allow a realistic chase be
tween two motorcycles and a real
automobile across the stage of Me
morial Theater, a way to shatter a
burning kerosene lamp without en
dangering the building, and a means
to blow the roof from a trailer on
the stage, without bringing down
the house, are among the perplexing
problems taxing the ingenuity of
Gene Callnon, technical director of
"Blue Jeans."
According to the "Blue Jeans"
script, two motorcycle officers must
whiz on and off the stage in pursuit
of cars, and finally catch up with an
old jalopy, "Justabus," which is
filled with Communist literature,
pictures of Karl Marx, and a piccolo,
which is piloted by Jonathan, the
college-hoy Communist.
May Shako To Pieces
Rumor from reliable sources hints
that old "Justabus" probably will
shake to pieces before the audience's
very eyes. "Justabus," in real life,

belongs to J. P. Cahn, a member of
the cast, who used it as a truck un
til it slipped into some mud one day
and the tired old cylinders silently
gave up the ghost.
Callnon and his staff have been
working afternoon and night turn
ing out the three elaborate sets re
quired for "Blue Jeans," two of
which are nearly finished and the
third under way.
New Equipment Helps
The work has been speeded up by
the efficiency of the equipment of
the large new workshop of Memorial
Theater, and time, which originally
was spent in merely constructing
the props, is now being devoted to
turning out sets of greater quality
which may be used in future pro
ductions.
"I doubt that we could have pro
duced "Blue Jeans" with the limited
facilities of the old Assembly Hall,"
said Callnon. remembering the times
when the sets had to be constructed
on the stage itself with 'he use of
hand tools.

Now the old hand tools have been
augmented in the new shop with
fine electrical equipment, including
large hoists with which to move the
heavier props.
Sets In Skeleton Stage
Standing about the floor of the
shop are parts of the set which will
be the lavish interior of John Kirks'
country home, furnished in early
I California!! furniture. In a corner,
still in the skeleton stage, is the
' vehicle which will be the shanty
trailer of Sam Purdy, leader of the
j lettuce strikers.
The finished sets will represent
| many hours of work by a tired,
j paint-covered, but enthusiastic
. group of workers lead by Callnon,
: who is doing his last Farm show.
| Among this group are "Bernie"
Birnbaum, Wilma McFadden, John
Paulson, ;ind Bill Bassett.
Tickets for "Blue Jeans" will go
on sale Monday, Feb. 14. in the A.S.
S.U. offices. According to Dramatic
Manager Clay McDaniei, no advance
I reservations will be made.
