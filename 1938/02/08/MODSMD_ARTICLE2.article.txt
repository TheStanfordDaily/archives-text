# Harlow Discusses Probe Over Radio

### 
Findings in the Stanford School-
Press Investigation were discussed
by Professor Rex F. Harlow over
Station KGO last night on the Mon
day radio hour.
"For many years, higher educa
tional institutions and the press
moved together across the Ameri
can stage,' said Dr. Harlow. "In
time, however, the two institutions
fell apart. The demands of big
business commanded more and more
of the attention of the press, while
education held to its old purposes
and ideals."
"A number of economic factors
have contributed recently to change
this situation. And so today we
have the press and higher educa
tion again drawing together. This
does not mean that there are not
many difficulties to meet and solve.
But the fact is apparent that the
alignment of these two forces is
becoming steadily closed, with the
promise of much profit to both."
