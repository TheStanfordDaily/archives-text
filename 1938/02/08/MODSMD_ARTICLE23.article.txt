# Seaver Keeps Fifth Position In Tennis
## 
### 
Jim Seaver held on to his num
ber five position on the varsity ten
nis ladder yesterday when he scored
a 6~n, 1-fi, 6-3 triumph over Myrom
Folsom, who retains his six rating.
Superior steadiness from the hack
court gave Seaver his margin of
victory. Although more forceful
throughout, Folsom was unable to
keep up the pressure after scoring
decisively in the second set.
