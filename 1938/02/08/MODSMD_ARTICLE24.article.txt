# Solon Sees Row Grief Rabbits Needed in Election
## 
### 
From out of the political graveyard, Solon O. Swampum again appears
to predict and caution against today's student association elections. At the
Law Steps some will find their political aspirations successful, hut the
great majority of candidates will turn philosophers until the next election.
Topping the list of offices is that of graduate man of the Ex Committee.

,To the great mass of plebes, the of
fice means nothing, but to Dr. Wil
bur and graduate students it is the
latters' self-expression. Two Phi
Betes are competing, but Solon be
lieves that the ex-gravy man or John
Dern will win, though not handily.
Who's Running Now?
In the ranks of the juniors ap
pears the most interesting news of
the day. Six Row men are running
against the Hall's one. Such ambi
tion on the part of the Row is com
mendable— in everything but the
winning of this election. Our cor
respondents tell us that very early
last Friday morning," the day for
presentation of declinations, the Phi
Delts and Delta Chis decided that
their men held little promise of
winning the junior Ex Committee
position.
The Phi Delts, so we are told, de
cided that all the Row candidates
should draw straws to decide the
the lucky man for the lucky Row
support. This scheme, progressed
happily until the Alpha Delt junior
was approached. He refused, to the
consternation of his fraternity, which
felt that this was the best he could
expect—a five-to-one chance to win.
Women Arc Question
Solon hesitates to express an opin
ion about the sophomore woman on
Ex Committee, or the positions open
in women's council. Women, as many
of the campus political bosses have
learned, are most unreliable in these
matters. We shouldn't be surprised,
however, to find the Pi Phis looking
for rabbits for their political top
hats.
In the other berths, if the weather
remains clear and bright, the Men's
Council should include the addition
of Robert Braly, Robert Underwood,
and Alvah Horn; and the B.A.C.
member-at-large, owing to a dis
organized Row and a strong femi
nine vote, should be Bill Paulman.

winning of this election. Our cor
respondents tell us that very early
last Friday morning," the day for
presentation of declinations, the Phi
Delts and Delta Chis decided that
their men held little promise of
winning the junior Ex Committee
position.
The Phi Delts, so we are told, de
cided that all the Row candidates
should draw straws to decide the
the lucky man for the lucky Row
support. This scheme, progressed
happily until the Alpha Delt junior
was approached. He refused, to the
consternation of his fraternity, which
felt that this was the best he could
expect—a five-to-one chance to win.
Women Arc Question
Solon hesitates to express an opin
ion about the sophomore woman on
Ex Committee, or the positions open
in women's council. Women, as many
of the campus political bosses have
learned, are most unreliable in these
matters. We shouldn't be surprised,
however, to find the Pi Phis looking
for rabbits for their political top
hats.
In the other berths, if the weather
remains clear and bright, the Men's
Council should include the addition
of Robert Braly, Robert Underwood,
and Alvah Horn; and the B.A.C.
member-at-large, owing to a dis
organized Row and a strong femi
nine vote, should be Bill Paulman.
