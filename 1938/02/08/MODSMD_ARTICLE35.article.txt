# Poet's Books To Be Shown
## Bookstore To Display Sandburg's Works 
### 
In preparation for Carl Sandburg's
Stanford lecture on Feb. 17, the
Stanford Bookstore is arranging a
special exhibit of Mr. Sandburg's
books. They probably will be placed
on display today.
A number of his books will be
arranged in a front window of the
Bookstore on Lasuen Street soon,
Mrs. Helen Stirling of the new book
department said yesterday, while
other copies of his works will be
shown inside the store.
Beginning with "The American
Songbag," first published in 1927,
the Bookstore also will show copies
of "Good Morning America," "Se
lected Poems," a one volume edition
of 'Smoke and Steel," "Slabs of the
Sunburnt West," and "The People,
Yes," Mr. Sandburg's latest book.
An awakened public interest in
Mr. Sandburg's poetry has developed
in the past year, Mrs. Stirling said,
following the publication in the fall
of 1936 of the widely received "The
People, Yes."
Tickets for Mr. Sandburg's lec
ture, which will be presented by the
A.S.S.U. Committee on Public Exor
cises, will go on sale Friday at the
A.S.S.U. office in the Union and at
Keeble's in Palo Alto and will be
pi iced at 50 cents for student body
members and 75 cents for the gen
eral public.
