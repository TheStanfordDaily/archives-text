PHOTOPENIC,
THKSK guys
In line with the almost universal
policy of every magazine concerned
in any way with sports, the current
issue of Sports Illustrated has be
tween its covers an action shot of
the Stanford basketball team.
The picture was taken during the
Long Island University game in New
York's Madison Square Garden last
December, and shows principally
Spook Calderwood going high into
the air with an L.I.U. man after a
rebound.
Called the best of the month, the
flash photo shows three other mem
bers of the Card varsity Phil Zonne,
Bob Zonne, and Art Stoefen. Lui
setti was too clever for the photog
rapher this time and kept in the
dark.
PHOTOGRAPHING
A PFIOTOG
The action shot itself isn't so much
to shout about, for you can find pix
to match or better it right" in the
S. F. newspapers 'most any week
end. However, it is remarkable in
that directly across the court an
other photographer had the same
idea at precisely the same instant.
His flashbulb went off within the
minute fraction of a second it took
for this photographer's camera
shutter to wink.
In other words, both picture-get
ters took the same picture, from op
posite sides, exactly coincidental.
That is a mighty feat if you're try
ing to do it, but it is even more re
markable if you're not trying.
Sports Illustrated got this picture
wonder what became of the pic
ture the other guy got?
SUCH EFFICIENCY
IN THIS A.A.U.
Captain Ray Malott, the man Dink
Templeton says is a dead cinch to
break the quarter mile record set
by Ben Eastman some years ago
during the coming track campaign,
possibly in the first meet, still doesn't
know if he's going to run in the
A.A.U. Indoor in New York Feb. 20.
Jn an exchange of letters with Dan
Ferris, secretary-treasurer of the
A.A.U.. recently, Ray came to the
conclusion that all he had to do
was to sit back and wait for his en
try blank, for Ferris said he would
send it directly.
It didn't come, and then yesterday
Ray got a telegram from Daniel J.
asking him if he plans on competing.
Ray will compete if Ferris will ever
get around to sending him an entry
blank. II and when the deal goes
through, the quiet quarter-miler
will hop a plane to New York soon
after the Pacific Association Indoor
me< t in S. F. Feb. 10.
A WHOLE
DECK O! CARDS
The P. A. meet is the sectional
championship meet of the A.A.U.,
and will find entered besides Ma
lott a flock of other Stanford men,
including Ed Burrows. Burrows will
have a race on his hands when he
steps into the mile with Sadaj,
Powe, and Mehlert of California,
plus a few other hotshots of the bay
region.
Malott will have to run GOO meters
in New York if he goes, for that is
the only distance between 05 and
1500 meters that comes close to a
440. It is in truth approximately
000 yards, which is a lap and a
half on an outdoor track, instead of
the single lap quarter.
Whatever it is, Ray will give the
fans a race to yell about. Peterson.
