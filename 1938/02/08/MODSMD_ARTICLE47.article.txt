## Frosh Nine, Marin Open Season Today 
### WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor 
Raring to go alter a five-day lay-off. the yet uutried yearling baseball !
nine got back into the traces >esteri.lay in preparation fort afternoon's
conflict with Marin J. C., scheduled lor o'clock <;n the frosh diamond. !
Today's same, speaking in terms of a dry field, will be against the
bard-playing Marin .1. C. outfit. The ••Jaysees* have been up against the
same hard luck streak that the*—■ .——

trosh have, as the storm up and
down the coast has kept them off the
diamond for about the same length
of time. Anything can happen in
this game, and the frosh will fight
doubly hard to win their opener.
Colt Game Later
Friday's postponed game with
Santa Clara Freshmen may be
played later in the season. The Colts,
led by Johnny Hanna, who calls
signals from behind the plate, and
Sam Alexander, initial sacker, seem
to consider themselves pretty much
of an outfit, and think that they can
handle the Card fledglings.
As Coach Harry Shipkey and
Bobby Grayson, his number one
man. think that they have a smooth
nine themselves, this question may
have to be settled by a game later
in the season. Just where this con
flict can be sifted into the schedule
is a moot question, but it may be
worked.
Starters Listed
Tomorrow's starters for the Farm
frosh will probably be the same as
were scheduled to st;irt against
Santa Clara. On the mound facing
the first Marin batter, Quentin
Thompson should be smacking them
into Herb Atkinson's glove behind
the plate. "Ush" Tucker will be
dancing off the initial sack and
talking it up to Monte Phyl over at
second.
Herb Bull and Elton Boone, at
short and third respectively, will
most likely get the nod to start.
Backed up far in the outfield, Sip
key will probably have Howie Ruth,
Jim McCloud and Ed Johannessen
watching for the long drives of the
Marin sluggers.
