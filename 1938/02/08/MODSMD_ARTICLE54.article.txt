# 'Do I Hear a Second'
## 
### 
BY FIVE o'clock this afternoon, three students
will be new members of Executive Com
mittee, will take their places this evening for
their first session on the "nerve center of stu
dent government."
Except for the presence of three new faces
around Ex Committee table, no difference will
be heard in the voice of the students. Presi
dent Killefer will broach new business, mem
bers will pause long, speak little, answer in
apathetic tones to the request, "All in favor
signify by the usual sign."
Through no lack of effort on the part of Presi
dent Killefer to liven the deliberative atmos
phere, Ex Committee members will continue to
act like their less prominent schoolmates, will
show about the same indecision that might be
expected of any student familiar with local
problems through rumor and Daily stories.
Business will crawl on as usual—unless these
three new members approach their task with a
revolutionary change in attitude.
This docility might be simply a matter of in
dividual qualifications for office, about which
nothing can be done after election. More pos
sibly, it springs from the system under which
Ex Committee is chosen.
The Committee is a body of class representa
tives; and the classes themselves represent no
political entity. They are simply convenient di
visions for election. Except for participation in
a few social events, they do nothing as a group.
In electing its representatives, most of the
Stanford proletariat merely chooses names not
connected with any real student organization.
This alone could be the flaw which places mem
bers on the governing body who have no real
interest in their job, have been elected be
cause their names have been prominent on
sports pages, or in connection with minor activ
ity groups.
The attitude of the students themselves to
their government contributes in no small degree
to the apathy of Ex Committee members. Few
students are familiar with Stanford's govern
mental and activity set-up, most pay prac
tically no attention to the actions of those who
represent them and plan campus activities.
Yet the lack of real political constituencies
cannot be discounted in considering the prosaic
character of the Committee. That no other satis
factory method of representation has ever been
devised should not discourage future effort.
An ideal system would elect Ex Committee
members from groups of students in close con
tact. Split by Hall and Row residence, they
lose touch with their classmates, belong so
cially and politically only to their living group.
As it now stands, Ex Committee represents no
one but itself. Until some latter-day Plato de
vises a new system, the Committee will con
tinue to discuss student problems about which
they have little first-hand information, and will
reflect a student opinion uncrystallized by any
political groups.
Three new members will sit on Ex Commit
tee tonight, will come with glorious ideas of a
"new deal" in campus politics. In two weeks,
President Killefer will have to ask twice to
hear a second to the motion that Kappa Kappa
Kappa be granted a dance date.—J. S.

"new deal" in campus politics. In two weeks,
President Killefer will have to ask twice to
hear a second to the motion that Kappa Kappa
Kappa be granted a dance date.—J. S.
BY FIVE o'clock this afternoon, three students
will be new members of Executive Com
mittee, will take their places this evening for
their first session on the "nerve center of stu
dent government."
Except for the presence of three new faces
around Ex Committee table, no difference will
be heard in the voice of the students. Presi
dent Killefer will broach new business, mem
bers will pause long, speak little, answer in
apathetic tones to the request, "All in favor
signify by the usual sign."
Through no lack of effort on the part of Presi
dent Killefer to liven the deliberative atmos
phere, Ex Committee members will continue to
act like their less prominent schoolmates, will
show about the same indecision that might be
expected of any student familiar with local
problems through rumor and Daily stories.
Business will crawl on as usual—unless these
three new members approach their task with a
revolutionary change in attitude.
This docility might be simply a matter of in
dividual qualifications for office, about which
nothing can be done after election. More pos
sibly, it springs from the system under which
Ex Committee is chosen.
The Committee is a body of class representa
tives; and the classes themselves represent no
political entity. They are simply convenient di
visions for election. Except for participation in
a few social events, they do nothing as a group.
In electing its representatives, most of the
Stanford proletariat merely chooses names not
connected with any real student organization.
This alone could be the flaw which places mem
bers on the governing body who have no real
interest in their job, have been elected be
cause their names have been prominent on
sports pages, or in connection with minor activ
ity groups.
The attitude of the students themselves to
their government contributes in no small degree
to the apathy of Ex Committee members. Few
students are familiar with Stanford's govern
mental and activity set-up, most pay prac
tically no attention to the actions of those who
represent them and plan campus activities.
Yet the lack of real political constituencies
cannot be discounted in considering the prosaic
character of the Committee. That no other satis
factory method of representation has ever been
devised should not discourage future effort.
An ideal system would elect Ex Committee
members from groups of students in close con
tact. Split by Hall and Row residence, they
lose touch with their classmates, belong so
cially and politically only to their living group.
As it now stands, Ex Committee represents no
one but itself. Until some latter-day Plato de
vises a new system, the Committee will con
tinue to discuss student problems about which
they have little first-hand information, and will
reflect a student opinion uncrystallized by any
political groups.
Three new members will sit on Ex Commit
tee tonight, will come with glorious ideas of a
"new deal" in campus politics. In two weeks,
President Killefer will have to ask twice to
hear a second to the motion that Kappa Kappa
Kappa be granted a dance date.—J. S.
