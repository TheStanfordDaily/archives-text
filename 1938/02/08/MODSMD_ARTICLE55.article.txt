WHEN Roosevelt kept his personal popu
larity through Supreme Court reversals
and caustic criticism of spending policies to
win a landslide election a little over a year
ago, he was acclaimed the greatest politician
of the century.
But when, a few months later, he instituted
his Court program and alienated Congress,
critics reversed their decision, attributed his
early popularity to a toothy smile and the des
peration of the times.
Yet only a couple of days ago the old master
again used the ace in the hole that he has
consistently played to bolster waning confi
dence of the people. He announced an ulti
matum to Japan that she disclose her future
naval building program.
This recent move would mean nothing if it
weie not one of several switches from national

to International affairs. But last fall when the
Supreme Court fight had ended disastrously
and the Roosevelt fortunes were at a low ebb,
the President made the Chicago speech inti
mating that war blame should be placed on
Japan and setting the stage fo* the nine-power
conference at The Hague.
Though the nations met and accomplished
nothing, Roosevelt was again the leader, and
national affairs were shoved out of the spot
light. Peace sentiment crystallized and the
President's stock rose.
The present venture into world affairs may
mean just a little, but it will take minds off the
recession and unproductive conferences with
business men, big and little.
Of course, there was also the Panay inci
dent popping up at just the right time, to take
the play away from the special session of a
rebellious Congress. But the old master really
doesn't need fortuitous international incidents.
If they aren't available, he manufactures them.
