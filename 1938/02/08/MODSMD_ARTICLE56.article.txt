If exchange scholarships are to have any real value,
they must exist between countries which allow a free
interplay of ideas and knowledge. They must not be
hampered by ideological restrictions which hold that
black is white and white is black because Der Fuhrer
or II Duce says it's so. They must not be tied down to
this view of race or that view of war; they must, if they
are to offer anything more than a pleasant expeiience,
be unrestricted in every way.

Germany is not a very unrestricted country;
and it would seem although the possibility of ac
quiring any sort of valid education within its borders
is practically nil. Practically nil in any of the totali
tarian states, for that matter; in any of the countries
whose leaders find it necessary to supress opinion to
keep themselves in power.
Exchange scholarships with Germany have no
value today; probably exchange scholarships with Ja
pan, or Italy, or Russia none either.
Education is not the sort of thing which flourishes
under dictatorship. It is one of the first things to be
controlled and exploited; and any significance it may
have had before is rapidly lost when professorial minds
begin to goose-step.
Therefore, when exchange scholarships are pro
posed and awarded hereafter, it might be well to put
on a little democratic restriction of our own, and send
our students to France, or England, or South America.
They get nothing from Germany today but a realiza
tion of totalitarianism's inadequacy.
Old Heidelberg was a wonderful university—once.
It may be again. But until it is, exchange scholarships
with it, which serve only to keep alive the pitiful rem
nants of a tradition which died five years ago, seem
sad wastes of time and money.—Allen Drury.
