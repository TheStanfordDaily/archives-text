CCREEN Guild sweepstakes opened yesterday with
nominations for the various awards. Following the
Hollywood production scale, the vote of 15,000 mem
bers of the motion picture industry will make the final
choice on March 3, but you can register your bets now.
At the head of the list for best performances stand
Paul Muni, for his work in "Life of Emile Zola," and
Luise Rainex*, in "The Good Earth," defending champ
ions of 1937 and 1936, respectively.
The rest of the list includes Charles Boyer, "Con
quest;" Frederic March and Janet Gaynor, "A Star Is
Born;" Robert Montgomery, "Night Must Fall;" Spen
cer Tracy, "Captains Courageous;" Irene Dunne, "The
Awful Truth;" Greta Garbo, "Camille;" and Barbara
Stanwyck, "Stella Dallas."

The two leaders are of course the outstanding can
didates for honors. Muni's characterization of Zola
was superb; the same may be said of Luise Rainer fof
her portrayal of a Chinese peasant woman. Judged on
an absolute standard, it seems about a toss-up, with
our preference going to Muni.
But on the other hand, we would like to sec Robert
Montgomery get the award for his remarkable work
in "Night Must Fall." The part didn't have the scopc
that Zola had, but as far as Montgomery's handling of
the role, no finer work could be expected. It was the
surprise, and the year's most unusual work in our
opinion. Credit must also be given Montgomery for
attempting a role completely different from the suave
dilettantes he usually portrays.
Except for Luise Rainer, we don't think the women
have much chance. Greta Garbo still carries a lot of
prestige with her work, and her job of "Camille" was
one of the better ones of the year. Irene Dunne,
Janet Gaynor and Barbara Stanwyck seem a little out
of their class, although La Belle Dunne has turned into
a superlative comedienne.
So if it. looks like Muni is in, with Rainer a close
second. But we'd still like to see Montgomery get the
nod

are also given for the best supporting role,
best picture, best direction, best writing, best song.
We pick Joseph Schildkraut, for his characterization of
Dreyfus in "Zola" as the best supporting role. It stood
out sharply as a noteworthy spot in an already fine
picture. Right along with Schildkraut is Claire Trevor,
as Francey in "Dead End." Her minute part is prob
ably one of the most talked about snatches of celluloid
of the year just ended. Dame May Whitty is also in
the running for her part in "Night Must Fall."
There's not room enough to try to pick all the
awards that will be given. Of five tunes from movies,
George and Ira Gershwin's "They Can't Take That
Away From Me" will probably win, for sentimental
reasons.
But it seems to us that instead of wasting their time
and money casting a gold "Oscar" for tunes that are
already half-forgotten, they would do better to honor
the best musical direction, or score of the movie year.
It s high time that the fine work being done in this
connection were being recognized. The music is as
indispensable a part of a picture as Uio direction. Cos
tuming, or properties.—Stone.
