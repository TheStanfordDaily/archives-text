# 'Mannequin' Only Average

### 
"Mannequin," at the Stanford to
day, with Joan Crawford and
Spencer Tracy, uses the old "de
pression brings them together" story,
except that it's a labor strike this
time, to give audiences a good show
for their money. Miss Crawford
acts much as usual, sings a song on
her first wedding night, reminds of
the "tired young man with a cock
tail shaker in 1929.''
She finally falls out of love with
her first husband, who, her mother
hints, is a heel. He sits around,
plans, never does any work, loses
his fighter's contract in a crap game,
thinks up good ways to get some
money out of Tracy, the big ship
ping magnate. Marrying Tracy,
Crawford falls in love with him, the
strikes hit nis business, he finds out

she loves him, and they end in a
clinch.
Tracy plays his usual tough guy
role, boxing before breakfast, etc.
lie talks straight from the shoulder
to his men. With his stooge Ralph
Morgan, he runs a business which
goes on the rocks with the strike.
Everything turns out all right, we
suspect, because Crawford has a lot
of jewels to sell.
The story is a common enough
one, but is is well enough done to
warrant seeing, especially if you
go for Crawford.â€”Alward.
