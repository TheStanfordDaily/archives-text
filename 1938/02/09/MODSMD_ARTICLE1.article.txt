# Excom Launches Study of Drives
## Trio Named To Investigate Methods Of Controlling Campus Campaigns 
### 
Ex Committee last night appointed a special committee of Jack Cal
derwood, Boh Garretson, and John Cobbs to investigate plans for ;» method
whereby the A.S.S.U. can control campus fund drives.
A constitutional flaw, which does not allow for such control was re
vealed when Axe Society conducted an unauthorized fund campaign two

weeks ago, and by the
number of such organization drives. I
Chief plan suggested to remedy
this defcct was the appointment of
a permanent committee of three
students and three faculty members,
whose sole duty would be to pass on
the permissibility of money-raising
projects. All organizations then
would obtain an official okay before
going ahead with a drive.
Other Suggestions
Other suggestions were that Ex
Committee itself would consider and
sanction campus campaigns, or that
it would appoint a special committee
when applications for drives were
received.
It was decided that before any
final decision was made, a Commit
tee should be appointed to study
the problem, make suggestions to
Excom at the next meeting.
Pre-Reg Plans
Because last fall's pre-registration
program developed into a "hurry
up" job. Ex Committee last night
began plans for next fall's orienta
tion program. Although no fault
was found in the program itself, it
was felt that the lack of organization
of the men connected with the pro
gram led to hectic last-minute plan
ning.
A committee of women already
has been appointed by Dean Mary
Yost to begin work on the program,
and it was suggested by Barbara
Murphy, speaking for the women's
committee, that three men be ap
pointed to co-operate on early plan
ning.
Axe Society Request
Second facet to the discussion was
Axe Committee's request that it be
allowed to handle the pre-reg per
iod, either through having a mem
ber at the head of planning, or by
handling it through the entire Axe
Society organization.
It was decided to give the matter
further consideration at future meet
ings.
The question of holding a '"leader
ship institute," such as was conduct
ed last spring, was considered by
Excom. The wdmen, who led in the
institution last year, already are
planning meetings for next spring,
and the question before the com
mittee was whether or not the men
should be included in the institute.
It was felt that lack of participation
of the men last year was largely due
to the fact that they are less organ
ized than the women.
Of Public Interest
It also was suggested that the
opening of the meetings to the cam
pus as a whole was not conducive to
effective discussion. On the other
hand, matters considered at the
meetings the duties of campus lead
ers and campus organizations—were
subjects of interest to the whole
student body, said President Tom
Ki liefer.
The Ex Committee agreed that
the presence of the men would be
desirable at the meetings, and Kille
fcr will appoint three men to work
with the women on institute plans.
Election results were discussed,
and, with the exception of the Men's
Council results, were approved as
submitted by Election Chairman
Dick Riddell.
S.D.X. Request
Dave Botsford, speaking for Sigma
Delta Chi, men's professional journ
alistic fraternity, suggested that the
organization be given the job of
turning out the Handbook. The
task in the past has been given to
one man, and Botsford felt that the
group could put out the Frosh Bible
more efficiently. Main objection
raised was that it would be difficult
to fix responsibility, and the matter
was left for further consideration
until time for the appointment of
handbook editor.
Dates granted were to Hui Hawaii;
Sigma Chi; Graduate Women's Club;
Alpha Phi: Japanese Club; Phi Delta
Theta; A.O.Pi; Cardinals; Encina
Club; Phi-Delt-Zete; and Senior
class.
