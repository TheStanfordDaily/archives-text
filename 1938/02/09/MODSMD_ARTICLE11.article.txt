# Stanford's Peace Dove Wakes Up
## Meeting To Discuss Speakers For Peace Day Is Well Attended 
### 
New life was injected into Stan- |
ford's Peace Dove yesterday after- (
noon, when approximately 35 repre
sentatives from women's living
groups attended a meeting of the I
A.S.S.U. Peace Committee in the
Women's Clubhouse, and discussed j
possible speakers for the assembly |
on April 22.
Previous meetings of the campus |
peace-advocates usually have drawn
only a half-dozen students.
No final choice as to the possible I
peace day assembly speaker was
made at yesterday's meeting, but
Dan McComish, temporary chair
man'of the committee, predicted that
such a decision probably will be
reached .next week.
Speakers Suggested
Among the speakers suggested
yesterday were Frances Lederer,
Kathleen Norris, Nicholas Roosevelt,
John Steinbeck, Senator Gerald
Nye of North Dakota, Representa
tive Maury Maverick of Texas, Sen
ator Hiram Johnson of California,
I and Joseph Connard, of the Insti-
I tute of Pacific Relations.
One of the women delegates
| thought that former President Her
bert Hoover should be asked to
speak, but that suggestion was
turned down when it was pointed out
that Mr. Hoover is leaving in the
near future for a trip to Belgium,
i The possibility of asking Univer-
I sity professors to talk at the main
j assembly was discussed, but was
1 vetoed, since the committee mem
bers and living group delegates
, thought that an outside speaker
would attract a larger student at-
I tendance. Also, it was stated that
faculty members would be asked to
direct the 15 round-table discussions
planned for Peace Day.
"We want a speaker who will ap
peal not to one small group but to
all the campus," McComish said in
explaining the purposes of Peace
Day.
In addition, he urged that the
speaker finally chosen should pre
sent "a definite program as to what
students can do today to help to
preserve peace and to keep Amer
ica out of foreign wars." •
Democratic Practice
Emphasizing that the A.S.S.U.
Peace Committee desires to be guid
ed by "a democratic representation
of student opinion," the chairman
explained that the delegates will
take the names of suggested speak
ers to their living groups for further
discussion during the coming week,
and that the problem will be given
final consideration at a meeting next
Tuesday.
Because of an error in postcards
mailed to men's living groups, Mc-
Comish announced that a« brief
meeting of delegates from halls and
fraternities will be held at 4 o'clock
this afternoon in the downstairs
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.

sentatives from women's living
groups attended a meeting of the I
A.S.S.U. Peace Committee in the
Women's Clubhouse, and discussed j
possible speakers for the assembly |
on April 22.
Previous meetings of the campus |
peace-advocates usually have drawn
only a half-dozen students.
No final choice as to the possible I
peace day assembly speaker was
made at yesterday's meeting, but
Dan McComish, temporary chair
man'of the committee, predicted that
such a decision probably will be
reached .next week.
Speakers Suggested
Among the speakers suggested
yesterday were Frances Lederer,
Kathleen Norris, Nicholas Roosevelt,
John Steinbeck, Senator Gerald
Nye of North Dakota, Representa
tive Maury Maverick of Texas, Sen
ator Hiram Johnson of California,
I and Joseph Connard, of the Insti-
I tute of Pacific Relations.
One of the women delegates
| thought that former President Her
bert Hoover should be asked to
speak, but that suggestion was
turned down when it was pointed out
that Mr. Hoover is leaving in the
near future for a trip to Belgium,
i The possibility of asking Univer-
I sity professors to talk at the main
j assembly was discussed, but was
1 vetoed, since the committee mem
bers and living group delegates
, thought that an outside speaker
would attract a larger student at-
I tendance. Also, it was stated that
faculty members would be asked to
direct the 15 round-table discussions
planned for Peace Day.
"We want a speaker who will ap
peal not to one small group but to
all the campus," McComish said in
explaining the purposes of Peace
Day.
In addition, he urged that the
speaker finally chosen should pre
sent "a definite program as to what
students can do today to help to
preserve peace and to keep Amer
ica out of foreign wars." •
Democratic Practice
Emphasizing that the A.S.S.U.
Peace Committee desires to be guid
ed by "a democratic representation
of student opinion," the chairman
explained that the delegates will
take the names of suggested speak
ers to their living groups for further
discussion during the coming week,
and that the problem will be given
final consideration at a meeting next
Tuesday.
Because of an error in postcards
mailed to men's living groups, Mc-
Comish announced that a« brief
meeting of delegates from halls and
fraternities will be held at 4 o'clock
this afternoon in the downstairs
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
