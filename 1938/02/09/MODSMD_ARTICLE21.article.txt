# Toms 'Retain' Excom Positions
## 
### 
Two El Toros yesterday won seats
on Ex Committee apparently
through that process Stanford legis
lators delight in calling "precedent."
Harry Horton, Toro, takes over
the post of junior man from Jack
Calderwood, Toro, who last year
took over from Chick Franich, Toro.
John Dern, Toro, takes over the
post of graduate member from Jim
McCormick, Toro. For a half-year
the chain was broken by Joe
Weiner, Los Arcos, but Weiner took
over from Jack Hansen, Toro.
