# Putzie Hinrichs Appointed New Relations Head
## Reorganization Plans For Student-Faculty Contacts Considered 
### 
With Putzie Hinrichs as its
newly-appointed chairman, the
Student-Faculty Relations Commit
tee is being reorganized in order to
more fully represent campus living
groups. Jean Bird, who is the out
going chairman, has headed the com
mitee for the last year and ini
tiated the plan of Thursday after
noon and Sunday evening informal
meetings.
Miss Hinrichs transferred last
quarter from the East, where con
tacts between students and faculty
are "much more advanced and in
formal than on the Stanford cam
pus." She is planning to put several
new ideas into practice, including an
expansion of the Student-Faculty
Relations Committee.
The expansion is intended to
make people more conscious of the
opportunity which they have of
becoming acquainted with their
professors— not merely as student to
teacher—but as friend to friend, ac
cording to Miss Hinrichs.
Plans for future meetings of stu
dents and faculty members are pro
gressing, after the first week's trial,
which proved successful, according
to students participating in the
meetings. The next informal meet
ing is scheduled for tomorrow after
noon, in the Nitery.
Among the faculty members who
will be present are Edward Maslin
Hulme *(emeritus), Charles A.
Barker, and David Harris, all of
the history department.
The meeting is not intended mere
ly to help students get acquainted
with their professors, but also will
give the professors a chance to
know their students, according to
Miss Hinrichs. She urges any other
members of the faculty who are in
terested to come.
The "bull session" will begin at 4
o'clock and break up at 6. Re
freshments, consisting of cider and
doughnuts, are to be served.
There is no spot on earth where
moisture, in the form of either rain
or snow, does not fall.
