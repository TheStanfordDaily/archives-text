Selection of an additional 10
speakers to be added to a present
list of 15 will be completed this af

the A.S.S.U. Speakers' Bureau meets

The 10 speakers, when selected,
will be placed on the bureau's list
and will be assigned for
speeches before bay region organi
zations as Stanford speakers are re
quested.
Tryoutees for the 10 unfilled posts
have been required to give short
talks before the Review Board,
which is comprised of Bob Maiden,
as manager; 1). P. McKelvey, spon
sor and instructor in public speak
ing; Ed Kerr, debate manager;
Charles Schafer, former manager of
the bureau; and Onyet Watson, rep
resentative of Women's Council.
Topics for the tryoutee speeches are
chosen from any subjects on which
the tryoutee is qualified by study
and experience to talk on, according
to Maiden.
"The bureau selects only speakers
who have spent time and research
upon specialized subjects so that
When organizations request speak
ers, they are assigned an especially
qualified one," he said, in explain
ing the work of the bureau.
"So far this quarter, we have filled
engagements with about 30 off
campus organizations," he revealed,
"and have a list of approximately

225 Northern California clubs which
from time to time use the bureau's
service."
Future plans for the organization,
he announced yesterday, will also
include a research study into the
extent of use and preference for
| perfumes among Stanford women.
Also planned is an "Open House"
for members of the bureau to be
! held at the home of Mr. McKelvey,
soon after the new speakers have
been selected*
