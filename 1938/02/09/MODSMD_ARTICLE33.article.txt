WE'LL BE HEARING
FROM BRICK MORSE SOON
Now tlrat the groundhog hasn't
been able to find his shadow and
therefore we're going to have an
early spring, track will no doubt be
popping around directly.
The rain is bound to let up some
time, and then the teams in the bay
region will be able to get in some
practice, but until then the annual
period of predictions is in force.
The first general attack on the sit
uation has emanated from Califor
nia—not from Brick Morse, but from
Coach Brutus Hamilton himself.
Morse is still in the throes of bas
ketball, but he'll be around with his
4:12 milers and his 52-foot shotput
ters and George Anderson and Ar
chie Williams before long.
But that's beside the point, really,
for what Coach Hamilton has to say
is much more interesting, as well as
probably more authentic. He looks
forward to having a fairly strong
team this spring, maybe not quite
as good as the "second dual
meet team in the country' he was
blessed with last year, but good.
That "second best" outfit vffis sec
ond best to both U.S.C. and Stan
ford.
THE BROAD JUMP TRIO
IS STILL AROUND
One of Brutus' best selling points
probably will be his broad jump
battery—with Arnold Nutting, Guy
Manuel and George Kido. Nutting
is a sprinter, too, but he is best as
a broad jumper. An injured foot
kept him out of the Big Meet last
year.
Manuel throws a javelin now and
then, and he did it well enough in
the Big Meet last year to take third.
He also won the broad jump, beat
ing out Leo Madlem by something
like six inches. Kido is just a
broad jumper, nothing else. He took
third in the Big Meet.
The 880 will give Coach Hamilton
a fair threat in DeMott«Modisette,
last year's freshman star. Modisette
looked like a lad with the goods
when he did I:SG as a frosh, and un
less he gets hurt he's going to give
a lot of people some competition,
including Stanford's Carl Mahurin.
But that isn't all Cal will have in
the mile. Elton Weiman, third in
the Big Meet half last year, is back
for his final season. Charlie Miller
and Frank Cleary return, to give
Coach Hamilton plenty of depth.
The mile and two mile ought to
be right up Cal's alley, with Lucas
Powe, Charlie Mehlert, Stan Sadaj
and Ted Vollmer in suits Sadaj, the
Polish soph, looks like a threat in
the mile, while Vollmer, another
soph, can run a two mile with the
best on the coast. Ed Burrows of
Stanford can beat any of the bunch
al either distance, but he can't hope
to win both on the same afternoon.
In the sprints Cal is a huge ques
tion mark. There was a lot said
about Bob Frick and John Dowd
akin last year, but neither showed
much. George Anderson is back,
and eligible, but that bad knee is
going to be a stiff handicap. Stan
ford, with Hiserman and Carew and
Kneubuhl, looks at least as good.
Doug Lehman, Big Meet javelin
winner, returns and at this distance
looks like the favorite this year, but
much writer will pass under the
bridge betwen now and Big Meet.
Calvelli and Shaw for Stanford rate
chances.
Shot put and discus are all Stan
ford, the high jump should be Stan
ford. The pole vault can be con
ceded to Cal with Keith Monroe,
unless Bic Boore again does the im
possible for the Farm to win the
thing.
All in all, California will un
doubtedly have something of a
track team. It will probably do
better this spring in relation to its
publicity buildup than last year.
When the metropolitan dailies start
ed screaming all that stuff about
Ciil having a track team that would
knock the ears off any team in the
country but U.S.C., they put the
Bears on the spot.
A few injuries put the Califor
nians back on their heels, and Ihe
buildup was a blowup. Let 'em
start from scratch this year and the
Bears might be able to do a little
belter. It's tough when you have to
defend a reputation that a lot of
armchair coaches have tailored for
you.—Peterson.
