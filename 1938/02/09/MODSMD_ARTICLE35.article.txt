# Bunn's Boys Prepare For Trip South
## Hoopsters Brush Up On Defense Against Zig-Zag Troy Attack 
### 
After featuring a distinctly of
fensive game to knock over last i
week-end's two opponents, the j
Laughing Boys will dig in hard this
week on defensive drill in prepa
ration for U.S.C. *
Sam Barry's Trojans use a type
of offense best described as "zig
zag" plus close blocks—screens, to
be polite.
The guards pass the ball back i
and forth until a forward cuts out
and toward the center. The ball is
passed to him, and then everyone
cuts for an imaginary spot, trying
to draw a defensive man out of
position.
Aided by blocks, a score results
if everything goes as planned. Inci
dentally, Troy has no fast break,
but the system has the guards j
bringing the ball down court lei- j
surely.
Kingpin of the Troy battering J
ram is Ralph Vaughan, sophomore
deadeye, who has two specialties,
follow shots, and long set shots. No
tricky one-handed stuff for Vaugh
an; he prefers to have his feet sol
idly on the floor.
Goodrich Helps
Aiding him is Gail Goodrich, i
blond speedster who plays the left
corner, and tears for the basket at
every opportunity, letting nothing j
stop him.
To break up this seemingly strong
defense, Dr. John Bunn will spend
most of the time this week devising j
ways and means of spotting the 1
Cards in positions which will be in j
the way of the various Trojans.
"The defense has been improving ;
steadily with each game," said Dr.
John. "The first string held Cal to i
13 points in the first half, and the !
same combination tied up U.S.F. j
with seven points for the same ,
length of time," he continued.
