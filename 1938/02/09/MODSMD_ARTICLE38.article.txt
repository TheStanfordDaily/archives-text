Riding «in (he cr<>st of a decisive victory over the Cal frosh. Stanford's
yearling hoop team swings back into action tonight when it tangles will)
San Francisco Junior College on the Pavilion floor at 7:30 o'clock. Ad
mission will he free.
Coach Lotiis "Dutch" Conlan's Rams will he underdogs tonight lo the
high-Hying Papooses, who seem to show better form with each game.

However, the Rams boast victories!
over Fullerton J. C.. Glendale J. C., .
Palo Alto Sports Shop and Westside !
Athletic Club. Just last week-end
they scored two impressive wins 1
over Sacramento Junior College.
Leading the visitors is Alex j
Gjjalinski, center, whose rebound- I
ing and defensive play will carry |
the hopes of the Rams. Offensive
ace of the team is Tracy Slattery, j
forward, a potent shot-maker and
floor-man. Willie Blackwell, lor- j
ward opposite Slattery, is a for- j
mer All-City player from Lowell
High. Bill Phelan, guard, completes i
the starting line-up.
Employing a man-to-man defense, 1
the Rams have shown marked abil
ity to hold down their foes' score. '
Their only worry is to score
enough points themselves to carry
off the ball game.
S.F.J.C. boasts of strong reserve
strength, including Henry James, a
splendid guard; Dave Solomon, for
ward; Bill Fischer, giant center; and j
"Red" Burrows and Tony Manov,
forwards.
Wytze Gorter, youthful Papoose
yearling coach, gave his players a
day of rest Monday but ran them
through offensive drills last night in
order to improve their timing.
Under-the-basket passing was par
ticularly stresed. Gorter is also far
from pleased with the squad's de
fense and gave them a chalk talk
before actual practice began.

The team is back at full strength
again with Bill Masters, guard, out
of the hospital and back in action.
Tilford Denton, a smooth-playing
guard, has been added lo the frosh
team.
Probable line-ups:
S.E.J. C. Stanford
Slattery F Williams
Blackwell F Marshall
Opalinski C Burness
Curcio G Davidson
Phelan G Niecolls
