## Rain May Postpone Greyhound's Match 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team i
is scheduled to play the Pacific 1
Coast Greyhound nine this after- ,
noon at 2:30 o'clock on the Sunken ]
Diamond, but that's as far as it will
get if old man weather acts as he
has for the last three games.
At the beginning of the season
Coach Harry Wolter had a break in
the weather. His squad worked out
for four weeks and played its first
two practice games, winning from
the Athens Club, 5-2, and losing to \
the Gaddini All-Stars, 5-2, without
any interference by rain.
The Indians' next three contests
against the Kenealy Seals, San Fran
cisco Postmen and Alameda Elks,
had to be called off however. Dur- j
ing the 10-day lay-off Wolter has j
kept his pitchers and catchers busy, ;
putting them through light work- j
outs every day to keep them in con- I
dition.
Today's game, if played, will be
Stanford's last chance to tune up
before opening its C.1.8A. schedule
Saturday afternoon at Santa Clara.

bankment was erected, the Thames
River flowed over ground where
