# Frosh Baseball Upset By Rain
## 
### 
Again the weatherman raised
havoc with Coach Harry Shipkey's
freshman baseball schedule as yes
terday's game with Marin J. C. on
the frosh diamond had to be post
poned until a later date because of
rain.
The Papoose nine, with almost
two months of practice behind them,
were slated to open their 1938 sea
son Saturday against the Santa
Clara frosh, but the weatherman had
a different idea.. Yesterday he felt
the same way and again put off the
opening of the Papoose schedule.
If he changes his mind by Satur
day morning, Harry Shipkey's team
will play its first game of the season
against Commerce High School on
the Frosh diamond.
The Port Hospital at Sutton Bridge,
Lincolnshire, England, has had only
one patient in 50 years.
