# Going Around in Circle S's
## 
### 
STANFORD'S most vigorous social climber,
the Ski Club, faifed in another attempt
to crash the haute monde when its petition for
minor sport recognition was barred from yes
terday's ballot. But according to latest reports,
the Ciub has not gone off to sob quietly into
its pillow. Instead it is preparing for a new
putsch. In the meantime, student leaders are
finding their available stock of patience inade
quate to meet the demand.
It is a bit difficult to follow the chain of
cause and effect that lies behind Ski Club's epic
fight for recognition. The main theme is tangled
up with provisions and stipulations; it appears
briefly from behind a petition and then van
ishes into a melee of conflicting opinions. But
one question stands out in the dust of battle
that rises over this "darkling plain where ig
norant armies clash by night." That is, what
does the Ski Club expect to get out of recogni
tion?
And surprisingly, the answer is that the
only thing the skiers stand to gain is a Circle S
tor half a dozen of their best men. The club
has put up a fight for recognition that would
shame a Bengal tigress defending its manhan
dled young. But recognition means nothing
more than a red sweater with white marks on
it. Of course, there is the symbolism, and the
"moral support." But a really Grade A cause
cannot be built on the sand foundation of in
tangibles, no matter how beautiful they are.
Viewed in this light the Ski Club offensive
has the appearance of a cavalry charge on a
scarecrow. Perhaps when all the factors are
weighed, reduced to a common denominator,
and totalled, justice would favor the campaign
ers. But the prize isn't worth the fight. It is
like hauling up the coast artillery to shoot clay
pigeons.
For some years now, rugby has been one of
the most popular sports at Stanford, and it has
managed to bear up nicely without being rec
ognized. In fact, the squad voted last spring
not to accept minor sport status, preferring the
less institutionalized status quo. The rugby
team plays intercollegiate matches, goes on
trips, and gets its teeth kicked out with all
the pleasure of recognized sport.
It is easy to admire the Ski Club's valiant
campaign. It reminds us of knights in simon
ized armor, and causes that go marchin on.
But it is hard to believe that hours of oratory
and pages of petitions could not be invested
in a project that would return something more
than red sweaters. The Club resembles a small
boy storming away from the dinner table be
cause he couldn't get two pieces of pie.
As the first innocent bystander said to the
second, "What's all the shooting about?"â€”J.C.
