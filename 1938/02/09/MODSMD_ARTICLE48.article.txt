YOU may be an All-American fullback and
a member of Ex Committee, but the chances
are that five years from now the grind who sits
next to you in World Politics will be making
twice your salary. Or at least that is the general
conclusion of two studies of the relation of
extra-curricular activities to success after
college.
One study was made by John R. Tunis, in
connection with his "Was College Worth
While?" an investigation of the 25 years after
graduation of the 1911 class at Harvard. The
other is a small paper by two professors at
Wesleyan University, R. E. Thornhill and Car
ney Landis, "Extra-curricular Activity and
Success,"

Evidently, the best insurance for financial
success is not being treasurer of your frater
nity, but having a Bawlout average which quali
fies you for Phi Beta Kappa. Thirty per cent of
the Phi Betes of Harvard class of '11 were listed
in "Who's Who," and the average salary of the
group was over $6,000.
The lowest group on the monetary scale was
that of the athletes, below the club men and
the average, unheard-of men of whom no one
knew anything in college. And it was the lat
ter group which led the field for distinguished
careers after graduation.
An interesting sidelight on campus politics
was brought out by the Thornhill-Landis study
—those who became ministers were those most
active as campus James A. Farleys.
But athletics and politics appear to be dis
tinctly inferior to journalism, drama, and plain
old "hitting the books" when it comes to nick
ing the world for a living.
It all adds up to the fact that you are more
ftkely to be driving a Packard five years from
now if you stay home with your nose to the
grindstone than if you have a block S and
have managed the Convalescent Home Drive.
