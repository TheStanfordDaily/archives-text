FOR WANT OF A NAIL . . .
voted yesterday, such of it as does vote,
but it did not vote on one interesting question. At
the last moment recognition of skiing as a minor sport
was withdrawn from the ballot.
Five hundred people had petitioned Ex Committee
to put the matter before the student body. Five hun
dred people were under the impression that Stanford
democracy is valid to the extent of permitting initia
tive action, long one of the strongest pillars of repre
sentative government.
This was the legal reason for denying the Ski Club
its place on the ballot. This was the thing which
prompted an Ex Committee, hamstrung by the A.S.
S.U.'s faulty constitution, to close the matter, at least
as far as the pi'esent election is concerned.
# * # #
Professors Cottrell and Kirkwood, the A.S.S.U.'s
legal advisers, propose one of two things to break the
deadlock: a constitutional amendment clarifying the
status of skiing or an amendment to provide for initia
tive action to amend A.S.S.U. by-laws.
Of these, the former seems somewhat puzzling, in
asmuch as amendments have to be voted upon by the
student body anyway, and such an amendment would
simply put the skiing question right back on the ballot
where it has been struggling to get for a week. Per
haps the legal angle wouid be a little more valid, but
the waste of time until the next election would, if the
measure were a particularly vital one, obviate its
value.
Therefore, since a change cannot now be proposed
by initiative, but has to come from within, Ex Com
mittee would be wise to draw up a revision of the by
laws for the campus to vote upon in the next election.
Only when initiative is present can democracy func
tion directly and without loss of valuable time.
The occasion may arise in the future, as it has in
the past, when the campus may wish to place some
thing on the ballot, only to find itself blocked by Ex
Committee. Apathy and sabotage have too often
wrecked promising ideas.
A provision for initiative would spike forever the
carpings of critics who feel that an Ex Committe ans
werable only at election time to the campus* as a
whole is a little too independent to be truly repre
sentative. —Allen Drury.

Professors Cottrell and Kirkwood, the A.S.S.U.'s
legal advisers, propose one of two things to break the
deadlock: a constitutional amendment clarifying the
status of skiing or an amendment to provide for initia
tive action to amend A.S.S.U. by-laws.
Of these, the former seems somewhat puzzling, in
asmuch as amendments have to be voted upon by the
student body anyway, and such an amendment would
simply put the skiing question right back on the ballot
where it has been struggling to get for a week. Per
haps the legal angle wouid be a little more valid, but
the waste of time until the next election would, if the
measure were a particularly vital one, obviate its
value.
Therefore, since a change cannot now be proposed
by initiative, but has to come from within, Ex Com
mittee would be wise to draw up a revision of the by
laws for the campus to vote upon in the next election.
Only when initiative is present can democracy func
tion directly and without loss of valuable time.
The occasion may arise in the future, as it has in
the past, when the campus may wish to place some
thing on the ballot, only to find itself blocked by Ex
Committee. Apathy and sabotage have too often
wrecked promising ideas.
A provision for initiative would spike forever the
carpings of critics who feel that an Ex Committe ans
werable only at election time to the campus* as a
whole is a little too independent to be truly repre
sentative. —Allen Drury.
