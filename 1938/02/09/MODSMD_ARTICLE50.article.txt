is swing music?
Well, swing has never been defined to anyone's
satisfaction, least of all to mine. However, since
Fletcher Henderson is going to play at the Prom, and
since he is one of the best colored representatives of
swing, it will be of interest to see and hear what he
has to say about it all.
"Swing," Fletch defined one night, "is produced by
a group of musicians who, given a musical theme, im
provise around the melody, and interpret the tune
with rhythmic variations and trick intonations, as they
soulfully feel it."
That's a pretty definition, but it's all symbolic and
doesn't mean much. Take what he says a little later
on, "If a syncopated pattern moves the listeners to
rhythmic feelings, then it swings.'"
Henderson's best word on swing is, "It's the only
field in music where the soloist is given free rein to
play a melody as he sees fit." Now for one thing, you
must be careful how you interpret these statements.
One person called "Ray De O'Fan," (tricky eh?),'who
writes a radio column for a Los Angeles paper, almost
killed me for fair when he said "If we are to take
swing music as, 'It's the way I think a tune should
go,' (Louis Armstrong's definition), then the Lom
bardos swing it becouse they play the way they think
is best." What a payoff!
Best way of any to recognize swing is just to 1 is—
! ten to bands and records. After a while you'll find
that certain bands and certain tunes make your toes
wiggle, and make your feet start to shuffle. Then
you're going to have a real understanding of what
swing music means.

JJENDERSON has recorded extensively and all of
his stuff is worth listening to very carefully, not
only for the super arrangements, but for the very good
instrumentalists. For a long time he had Buster Bailey,
the only Negro clarinetist worth talking about, in his
band, not to mention Roy Eldridge on trumpet and
Leon "Choo" Berry on tenor.
Most famous of all of Henderson's recordings is his
Vocalion platter of his radio theme song, "Christopher
Columbus." Recent recordings for Victor include "Jig
Town Blues." No. 25739; "Sing Sing Sing," No. 25375;
and for a sample of something lighter, "Until Today,"
No. 25373.
His Decca work includes "Wild Party." "Tidal
Wave," "Down South." "Lime House Blues," Happy
As the Day Is Long." All of these discs are well worth
acquiring, not <Vfily for their danceability, but for their
general all around excellence. And when you listen
to them, don t make the mistake of assuming that he
: has copied Benny Goodman. Instead it is Fletch play
ing and swinging his own arrangements; Benny only
| yets them second-hand from Henderson.

satisfaction, least of all to mine. However, since
Fletcher Henderson is going to play at the Prom, and
since he is one of the best colored representatives of
swing, it will be of interest to see and hear what he
has to say about it all.
"Swing," Fletch defined one night, "is produced by
a group of musicians who, given a musical theme, im
provise around the melody, and interpret the tune
with rhythmic variations and trick intonations, as they
soulfully feel it."
That's a pretty definition, but it's all symbolic and
doesn't mean much. Take what he says a little later
on, "If a syncopated pattern moves the listeners to
rhythmic feelings, then it swings.'"
Henderson's best word on swing is, "It's the only
field in music where the soloist is given free rein to
play a melody as he sees fit." Now for one thing, you
must be careful how you interpret these statements.
One person called "Ray De O'Fan," (tricky eh?),'who
writes a radio column for a Los Angeles paper, almost
killed me for fair when he said "If we are to take
swing music as, 'It's the way I think a tune should
go,' (Louis Armstrong's definition), then the Lom
bardos swing it becouse they play the way they think
is best." What a payoff!
Best way of any to recognize swing is just to 1 is—
! ten to bands and records. After a while you'll find
that certain bands and certain tunes make your toes
wiggle, and make your feet start to shuffle. Then
you're going to have a real understanding of what
swing music means.

JJENDERSON has recorded extensively and all of
his stuff is worth listening to very carefully, not
only for the super arrangements, but for the very good
instrumentalists. For a long time he had Buster Bailey,
the only Negro clarinetist worth talking about, in his
band, not to mention Roy Eldridge on trumpet and
Leon "Choo" Berry on tenor.
Most famous of all of Henderson's recordings is his
Vocalion platter of his radio theme song, "Christopher
Columbus." Recent recordings for Victor include "Jig
Town Blues." No. 25739; "Sing Sing Sing," No. 25375;
and for a sample of something lighter, "Until Today,"
No. 25373.
His Decca work includes "Wild Party." "Tidal
Wave," "Down South." "Lime House Blues," Happy
As the Day Is Long." All of these discs are well worth
acquiring, not <Vfily for their danceability, but for their
general all around excellence. And when you listen
to them, don t make the mistake of assuming that he
: has copied Benny Goodman. Instead it is Fletch play
ing and swinging his own arrangements; Benny only
| yets them second-hand from Henderson.
