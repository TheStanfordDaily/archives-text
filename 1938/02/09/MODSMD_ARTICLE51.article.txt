## OWL ON NAZIS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday's edit entitled An Ex
change for the Better contains sev
eral erroneous statements that I
think should be brought to your at
tention and probably should be
pointed out to the student body as a
whole.
First of all the proposed exchange
scholarship will not be awarded to
the house showing the greatest
scholastic improvement. As was
stated in The Daily several days ago,
it will be given to a house member
nominated by his house and finally
passed by the Interfraternity Board
of Control.
Also, I think that you have over
looked a number of serious disad
vantages in the proposal. The ex
change student will be expected to
pay his own traveling expenses and
will be expected to furnish his own
spending money. This condition will
obviously eliminate many students
dependent on financial aid.
And if one really wants to gripe,
there is no better subject for griping
than that of selecting a university
in Nazi Germany for the first place
to send the Stanford exchange stu
dent. Any person who has visited
Germany recently will assert that
all German universities are directly
controlled by the government. Edu
cation there is being displaced by
Nazi propjaganda. And, of course,
it is very nice to have the Stanford
student live with a German family;
but is everyone aware that this
family will be chosen by Nazi offi
cials?— Sincerely,
Owl.
