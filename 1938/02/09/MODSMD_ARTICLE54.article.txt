# The 						Reviewer Play
## 
### 
When the critics blush—that's
news. Yet you can't blame them
when you see "The Women," which
so frankly shows Park Avenue
tigers (not confined to N. Y.) tear
each other with their expensively
manicured claws.
Claire Boothe's amusing dialogue
lampoons, yet seriously indicts,
what your reviewer had considered
the weaker sex. The play tells the
simple story of a woman who is
forced into divorce by the scandal
monging of her so-called friends.
A revolving stage allowed the 12
scenes to be shifted quickly and
quietly, rapidly moving the action
from boudoir, bathx-oom, and ma
ternity ward to the most public of
places where women sharpen their
claws and air dirty linen—the
beauty parlor, the fitting room, and
the powder room of a night club.
The costumes and sets were mere
seconds to the sparkling dialogue
and action which was aptly acted
by 40 women, no men. Lois Wilson
as a divorce-wracked wife was little
more than ample. Emily Ross, as
the woman the "stork has the In
dian sign on" is capital, as is Doris
Parker as the cynical female nov
elist. In fact, the whole crew of cats
are adequately portrayed with Doris
Kelton and Celeste Holm coming in
for special mention.
The scene where Mary explains to
her daughter that a mother and a
daddy can "fall out of love" is
poignant.
If you want to see hair-pulling,
hear wise-cracking, and watch snap
py situations, get your tickets early,
because at least 20 of the girls are
"pips."
