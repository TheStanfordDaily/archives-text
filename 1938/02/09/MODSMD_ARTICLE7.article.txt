# Prom To Swing Along To Strains Of Saxes
## 
### 
When the baritone saxes start in to chant the low tones of "Chris
topher Columbus" next Friday night in the Pavilion, it will be the signal
that Fletcher Henderson really has arrived and the Junior Prom is under
way.
Leader of what is termed one of America's finest swing bands, Fletcher

Henderson will bring to the
a group whose recordings have rated
many superlatives. The ari'ange
ments of "Shoe Shine Boy," "Lime
House Blues," "Down South," and
"Jig Town Blues" are considered
classics in the realm of swing music
by musicians.
Slower Tempo Promised
The Prom Committee, under the
direction of Andy Shirey, felt that
while students liked to listen to
swing music, and enjoyed it as such,
most of them would rather dance to
slower tempos. So, in the contract
with Henderson, a clause was in
serted providing that the band must
play only one fast number to every
four slow ones.
Tickets for the Prom already have
gone on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
for $3 a couple. It was pointed out
by Shirey that the bids are much
lower this year. So far half the
tickets have been sold.
Chaperones Announced
Chaperones for the dance are Mr.
and Mrs. C. N. Reynolds, William
S. Hopkins, Elmer D. Fagin, and
Theodore H. Boggs.
Correct dress for the Prom, as se
lected by the Junior Executive Com
mittee, will consist of formal dress
for the women and dark suits for
the men.
