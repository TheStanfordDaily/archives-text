# Wind Lashes Farm, Fells Row Trees
## Two Cars Damaged; Traffic On Lasuen Held Up Two Hours 
### 
Traffic on Lasuen was held up for
almost two hours yesterday noon |
when a driving gale swept the cam- j
pus, leveling trees at at least seven I
different places along the Row.
An uprooted tree in front of the
Deegee house compelled Row men
and women returning for lunch to
use the Chi O driveway. Trees were
down and partially blocked traffic
in front of the Post Office, the Union
Alcove, and the Alpha Phi House,
while branches were missing from
almost every large tree on the cam
pus.
Trees Crush
The climax of the destruction,
which came near ending in catas
trophe, was reached about 1 o'clock
when two of the largest trees on the
Row broke loose from their roots
in the Kappa Sig parking-way and
crashed across Lasuen, each striking
a car on its way down.
A Ford coupe driven by Freddie
Baker was dented on the hood and
rear fenders, but Baker was unin
jured. The other cax', a Chevrolet
sedan driven by an unidentified
man, had its rear fender and li
cense plate wrinkled.
A miniature storm was reported
on Lake Lagunita. Dashing waves
and a driving wind broke one of
the diving platforms loose from its
moorings, and caused the evacuation
of the boathouse for some time.
Fences Destroyed
Miscellaneous damage on the
campus included: three large Euca
lyptus trees down on New Gover
nor's Lane, partial destruction of the
high wooden fence surrounding
Woodpecker's Lodge, and the filling
of the basketball courts behind the
B.A.C. with branches and refuse.
Several campus power lines were
down during the afternoon. Lights
were off and on again several times
in Encina, Toyon and Branner, and
were off on the Row until 7 o'clock.
