# Junior Prom To Feature Swing King
## Fletcher Henderson To Offer Variety Of Special Numbers 
### 
Fletcher Henderson, the colored
king ot swing, who will play here
tomorrow night for the Junior Prom,
has helped make "swing music his
tory" through his nightly broadcasts
over the NBC airlanes.
Aside from his national radio re
putation gained through the orches
tra's fine music and their haunting
theme melody, "Christopher Colum
bus," Mr. Henderson has been mak
ing a coast-to-coast personal ap
pearance tour, and, according to re
ports, the reception given the band
has been tremendous.
Recently in St. Paul, he was picked
from a list of 20 of America's "name"
bands, and played to 10,000 dancers
at the annual "Cinderella Ball."
. Aside from being one of the
country's ace exponents of swing
music, Fletcher Henderson and his
orchestra will offer a great variety
of special arrangements and enter
taining novelties. The decorating
committee plans to have the dance
platform high enough so that every
one on the floor can see the special
stunts.
Mr. Henderson has also done a
great deal toward furthering the
career of Benny Goodman, for many
of the popular music arrangements
featured by Benny Goodman have
come from his pen. The Casa Loma
and Jack Hylton are two other name
bands now using Henderson ar
rangements. Recently he turned
down an offer of $300 a week by
Goodman, for which he was to do
all of the Goodman arrangements,
instead of only part of them.
Tickets for the Prom are now on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office for $3 a
couple. It was pointed out by Andy
Shirey, Prom chairman, that the bids
are much lower this year, and that
already over half of the bids have
been sold.
Correct dress for the Prom, as se
lected by the Junior Executive Com
mittee, will consist of formal dress
for the women and dark suits for
the men. The dance will last from
9 to 1 o'clock.
