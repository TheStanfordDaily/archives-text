# RKO Cancels Three Sunday Night Movies
## 
### 
Cancellation of campus showings
of "Roberta," "Top Hat," and "Ci
marron," was announced yesterday
by RKO Studios, which claimed a
misunderstanding of the nature of
Sunday night movies.
"We thought you were just ex
hibiting them in one of the frater
nities for a few of the boys," G.
William Wolf, RKO's San Francisco
manager, told Bill Hovey, campus
film czar.
Hovey had earlier in the day re
ceived a telegram from the Holly
wood studio calling off the three
films' screening here. "Roberta" was
scheduled for next Sunday night,
the other two films for the follow
ing two week-ends.
Mr. Wolf gave Hovey these two
reasons for RKO's cancelling local
showing:
1. The studio "had no idea" that
Stanford's audience was so large,
that Sunday night movies here se
riously competed with Sunday night
movies downtown.
2. RKO felt 15 cents too small an
admission price and that this, too,
was an important factor in the com
petition with commercial houses.
It was believed this last statement
was prompted by pressure from
local' theaters.
These three pictures are the first
ever scheduled from RKO. "All last
quarter we received our films from
Columbia and I think we'll prob
ably be able to get more from them
or perhaps United Artists later on,"
Hovey concluded.
