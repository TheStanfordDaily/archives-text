# Council To Act On Scholarship
## Row Men To Decide On Student Exchange 
### 
Final decision on the Interfrater
nity Board of Control's proposed ex
change scholarship will be made to
night at a meeting of the Interfra
ternity Council in the Phi Kappa
Sigma house.
In a statement yesterday, Don
Moulton, president of the council,
emphasized the fact that if the pro
posal was approved the exchange
scholarship would not necessarily be
made with Heidelberg University in
Germany, but might be made with
any foreign university.
Heidelberg Suggested
Heidelberg was suggested only
because that university is acquainted
with the exchange scholarship sys
tem and a student there has been
nominated who is willing to enter
into an exchange.
Moulton also pointed out that the
scholarship would go to a Stanford
student nominated by his fraternity
