## Row Men To Decide On Student Exchange 
### 
Final decision on the Interfrater
nity Board of Control's proposed ex
change scholarship will be made to
night at a meeting of the Interfra
ternity Council in the Phi Kappa
Sigma house.
In a statement yesterday, Don
Moulton, president of the council,
emphasized the fact that if the pro
posal was approved the exchange
scholarship would not necessarily be
made with Heidelberg University in
Germany, but might be made with
any foreign university.
Heidelberg Suggested
Heidelberg was suggested only
because that university is acquainted
with the exchange scholarship sys
tem and a student there has been
nominated who is willing to enter
into an exchange.
Moulton also pointed out that the
scholarship would go to a Stanford
student nominated by his fraternity
house and approved by the Inter- j
fraternity Board of Control.
The proposed scholarship would
replace the present Bruce Macon [
Tarver Memorial cash award that is
given annually to the house record
ing (he greatest scholastic improve
ment.
Council to Choose
The final selection would be made
on the basis of the Stanford stu
dent's qualifications in scholarship,
improvement in work while at Stan
ford, and other qualifications desig
nated by the Board of Control.
The council also will consider the
proposed competitive interfraternity
sing. At the last meeting of the
council a suggestion was made that
.some definite stimulus be given to
singing in the various fraternity
houses, but no action was taken
other than putting the suggestion up
to the houses.

Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in
as president 13 hours and 21 minutes
after the assassination of McKinley;
Calvin Coolidge was sworn in just
three hours and 17 minutes after
Harding's death.
