# Three Women Star In Drama As Hermione
## 
### 
Frances Farmer, Olive Krauthoff,!
and Kay Campbell, the three Her
miones of the current Speech and
Drama Department production of
"A Winter's Tale" which will be
presented tonight at 8 o'clock in
the Little Theater, each expresses
a different interpretation of the part.
Having voted for double casting
as a means of distributing feminine
roles, all three appear in the same
part on different nights during "A
Winter's Tale" week's run.
"Hcrmione Tough"
To Miss Farmer, who will be fea
tured in the performance Saturday,
a portrayal of the Shakespearean
heroine demands dignity and ma
turity. "For this reason," she says,
"Hermione is the toughest part I
have ever tackled. I find it neces
sary to tone myself down —to throw
off the mannerisms I have picked
up playing hoyden roles like that
in 'Lady Precious Stream'."
Miss Krauthoff, who will make
her debut in Farm dramatics when
she plays Hermione tonight and in
the Saturday matinee, refuses to
take the personality of her character
seriously.
"Hermione personifies all the vir
tues which went out with suffrage
— submissiveness, sweetness, and
light," the actress avers. "I, per
sonally, d'on't consider her very
bright."
Gary Simpson Stars
Miss Campbell, on the other hand,
expresses the opinion that the femi
nine lead is "a deeply intellectual
woman—a woman who feels deeply
and yet restrains her emotions.
"She is," according to the actress
who appears in the role Friday and
the following Monday nights, "every
inch a queen. I have wanted to play
the part ever since I saw the Strat
ford production in England last
summer."
Gary Simpson stars as the male
lead Leontes in all performances
which include evening shows to
night, Friday, Saturday, and the
following Monday with a matinee on
Saturday at 2:30 o'clock.
