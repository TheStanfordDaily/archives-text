Voting in a re-election, Stanford
men yesterday named A1 Horn, Ed
Kerr, and Bob Underwood to Men's
Council.
The re-election was ordered by Ex
Committee, which invalidated Tues
day results because graduate men
mistakenly were barred from voting
for the three offices.
The mistake arose from a mis-in
terpretation of election rules and
the resulting belief that only under
graduate men were eligible to ballot
for the positions.
No Change In Result
On the basis of the impounded re
turns from Tuesday's election, the
re-vote made no change in the out
come. According to the election
committee, Horn, Kerr, and Under
wood received the necessary plurali
ties Tuesday.
