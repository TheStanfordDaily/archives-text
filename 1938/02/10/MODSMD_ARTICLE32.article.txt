# Education With A Punch You Too Can Be A Savage
## 
### 
When John Savage goes to a bas
ketball game, he takes several car
tons of peanuts. When he goes to
a dance, he takes a punch bowl and
glasses.
He doesn't do this because he is
eccentric. He does it because he's
enterprising.
Savage, who is a senior here, takes
the cartons of peanuts to the basket
ball games to sell. He uses the
punch bowl and glasses to sell
punch.
When he graduates June 18, he
will have earned all of his expenses
for four years of college.
Arrived In 19114
He came here in 1934, with the
wolf only a block or so from his
door, looking for an education. An
education, as both Savage and the
wolf know, costs money. John's
first step in getting this necessary
money was to sell punch at Encina
dances.
By submitting lower bids and giv
ing better service, he gradually cor
nered Stanford's punch market and
today he has a monopoly on filling
glasses with the usual mixture of

ginger ale and orange sherbert at
all school danceÂ§.
He earns his meals by working in
Lagunita kitchen. Besides his punch
and peanut concessions, he makes
it possible for Hall men to break
fast in bed. Every morning from 6
to 7 o'clock he delivers milk, orange
juice, and snails to the leisure class
in Encina, Toyon, and Branner.
When asked if he missed his so
life with all his work. Savage
shook his head and laughed, "Huh,
I go to all the dances, and make
money at it!"
Served 100 Dances
After looking through his books,
John, who probably has served more
people than Mrs. Astor, figured he
will have served more than 120,000
! cups of juice at approximately 100
dances by the end of this, his fourth,
year. If all this liquid were as
at one time, it would be
enough to fill the swimming pool in
the gym.
"Any man who really wants to
earn his way through school can do
it," he says. Savage is a chemical
engineering major.
