# Committee Plans International House

### 
In a move to provide campus living accommodations for all foreign
students attending Stanford next year, the A.S.S.U. International Com
-inittee last night considered a plan to house them in either Encina,
Branner, or 'i'ovon.
Committee members plan to contact administration officials this week

to see if they can secure preference#
for the foreigners in one of the i
dorms and I'eceive official comment
on the plan. It was indicated that
the number of accommodations
needed would be about 25 or 30.
This plan was formulated when
committee members reported on
their inability to find an available
house of sufficient size to meet the
requirements of an idea calling for
a separate house to accommodate
them all.
Through contact with J. P. Mit
chell, registrar, it is also planned to
secure complete lists of next year's
foreign students, who would be
aided in finding room accommoda
tions.
"This dormitory plan would be
only a temporary arrangement," said
Mel Jacoby, head of the committee,
"until a more adequate housing can
be worked out, or until we are able
to find the type of living place that
we have been looking ioy.
"The problem is one of first con
tacting the prospective foreign stu
dents and then providing living [
quarters," he said, "and this is what j
we are now trying to do. By means
of these two plans we hope finally
to clarify the situation."
