IF IT ISN'T ONE THING
IT'S ANOTHER —
Tuesday afternoon Varsity Base
ball Coach Harry Wolter was stand
ing around under that leaden sky
just hoping it wouldn't rain that
night so his team could play base
ball the next day, yesterday.
Unfortunately it did rain, and the
sunken diamond would make the
nicest little hog wallow you ever did
see just about now, but that's only
half of it.
Even if it hadn't rained yesterday,
that wind would have been enough
for which to call off any baseball
game. Pitcher Spike Furman, who
throws a mean fast ball anyway,
would have had so much .smoke with
that wind at his back that Catcher
Sid Lewis' glove would have split
on the first catch.
Spike would have been throwing
that ball so fast that the batters
wouldn't have been able to see the
ball, let alone hit it. And if the ball
did happen to hit somebody's bat it
would have broken the bat or flat
tened its'elf out. Joe DiMaggio him
self couldn't have hit a ball against
that wind hard enough to get it
out of the infield.
Well, anyway, the wind was blow
ing pretty hard.
THE RAIN HAS TREATED
STANFORD LIGHTLY
Yesterday's postponement was the
fourth game of the season called off
because of rain, but even at that
Stanford's varsity has practiced as
much as any other team in the C.I.
BA. The team got in four weeks of
workouts and then two games be
fore the rain started in, which is
as much as any other outfit, even the
southern teams, has done.
Santa Clara began practice only
a short time ago, and no sooner had
it started than the rain set in to halt
proceedings. The Broncs have had
no games, virtually no practice, and
they are scheduled to start the con
ference against Stanford Saturday.
In all probability that game, too,
will be called off, but still Justin
Fitzgerald's nine won't get much
chance to practice — league games
will be coming thick and fast, and
they will be played just as soon as
the wet weather lets up.
RAY MALOTT TO GO
TO NEW YORK MEET
At last Ray Malott yesterday
received his entry blank from the
AA.U. for the national indoor meet
in New York Feb. 26, and as soon as
he can get it back to Daniel J. Fer
ris he'll be entered in the champion
ships. He will go east by plane, ac
cording to arrangements being made
by Ferris, sometime after the Pa
cific Association meet in San Fran
cisco Feb. 19.
OIIR "NOW IT CAN
RE TOLI)" DEPARTMENT
A lew items have been accumu
lating in this department, and it's
time they were told. For one, a lead
ing Los Angeles paper had a picture
of Phil Zonne not so long ago—a
beautiful two-column deal showing
him in perfect guarding position,
clear as a bell and all that stuff.
The only thing wrong was that the
caption labeled him Captain Hank
Luisetti. Slight butch.
Also, a columnist in that paper
tried to stir up a little trouble by
saying that one of his operatives
had told him of a split between
Conch Bunn and Luisetti during the
second U.S.C. game this year, that
was responsible for Stanford losing
the game. He came to the conclu
sion, after a chat with Bunn and
Luisetti two weeks ago, that his op
erative was shouting through his
fedora. The rumor was one of the
silliest heard in moons.
And Jack Calderwood, the old
master of the art of how not to shoot
foul throws, created a mild sensation
among sports writers at the U.S.F.
game last Saturday when he sank
three consecutive tosses. Jack

throws them right and everything,
but somehow they don't go through
the hoop. But he's an earnest lad,
and if he keeps trying he'll get the
hang of the thing sooner or later.

IF IT ISN'T ONE THING
IT'S ANOTHER —
Tuesday afternoon Varsity Base
ball Coach Harry Wolter was stand
ing around under that leaden sky
just hoping it wouldn't rain that
night so his team could play base
ball the next day, yesterday.
Unfortunately it did rain, and the
sunken diamond would make the
nicest little hog wallow you ever did
see just about now, but that's only
half of it.
Even if it hadn't rained yesterday,
that wind would have been enough
for which to call off any baseball
game. Pitcher Spike Furman, who
throws a mean fast ball anyway,
would have had so much .smoke with
that wind at his back that Catcher
Sid Lewis' glove would have split
on the first catch.
Spike would have been throwing
that ball so fast that the batters
wouldn't have been able to see the
ball, let alone hit it. And if the ball
did happen to hit somebody's bat it
would have broken the bat or flat
tened its'elf out. Joe DiMaggio him
self couldn't have hit a ball against
that wind hard enough to get it
out of the infield.
Well, anyway, the wind was blow
ing pretty hard.
THE RAIN HAS TREATED
STANFORD LIGHTLY
Yesterday's postponement was the
fourth game of the season called off
because of rain, but even at that
Stanford's varsity has practiced as
much as any other team in the C.I.
BA. The team got in four weeks of
workouts and then two games be
fore the rain started in, which is
as much as any other outfit, even the
southern teams, has done.
Santa Clara began practice only
a short time ago, and no sooner had
it started than the rain set in to halt
proceedings. The Broncs have had
no games, virtually no practice, and
they are scheduled to start the con
ference against Stanford Saturday.
In all probability that game, too,
will be called off, but still Justin
Fitzgerald's nine won't get much
chance to practice — league games
will be coming thick and fast, and
they will be played just as soon as
the wet weather lets up.
RAY MALOTT TO GO

At last Ray Malott yesterday

in New York Feb. 26, and as soon as
he can get it back to Daniel J. Fer
