# Cards Work In Offense For U.S.C.
## Laughing Boys Show Fire Before Leaving On Southern Trek 
### 
Stressing offensive maneuvers in
yesterday's workout,' their last
heavy practice before the U.S.C.
series, the Cardinal varsity w*ll to
day—if they practice—merely in
dulge in a little shooting.
Dr. John Bunn was undecided last
night whether or not to call a
practice for today. The team leaves
tonight for the third and fourth

games of the Trojan series, to be
played in the Los Angeles Pan-
Pacific Auditorium.
Yesterday's practice was one of
the best of the week, the Laughing
Boys showing more fire than they've
shown in many a workout. Both the
first ' and second strings went
through offense drills.
Play after play went for scores,
and then they started making up
ways and means of putting the
ball through the hoop—and still they
worked. The Laughing Boys and
Grinning Kids (second string)
were not to be stopped yesterday.
