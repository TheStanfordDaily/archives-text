## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Frosh Hoopsters Whip S.F.J.C. 40-19 
### 
Piling up another overwhelming victory'. Stanford's powerful frosh
cage team defeated San Francisco Junior College, 40-19, last night in the
local Pavilion.
Tile Rams started a combined second and third string team and as a
consequence found themselves on the short side of a 17-X half-time

j count. <
The Papooses started slowly and
didn't start to really move until the j
first half was well underway. With ;
| the score tied, 3-3, baskets by Don
| Williams, Don Burness and Bill
! Niccolls and a free throw by the
: latter swept the yearlings to a 10-3
i lead and sewed up the game for
them.
j After warming the bench for the
j entire first period, the Jaysee first
j team started the second half. How
j ever, the frosh began to really hit
S their form and literally deluged the
j Rams under a flood of buckets. Led
j by Don Williams, star forward, who
i scored 10 digits in the second half,
they ran the score quickly to 33-14,
■ and then handed it over to the re-
I serves.
Williams was by far the outstand
| ing man on the floor last night, tank
; ing seven field goals for 14 points
and high honors. In addition he
j contributed some brilliant aid to his
j teammates with his accurate pass
ing and alert pass interceptions.
Don Burness, Frosh center, and
Alex Opalinski, Ram pivot-man,
tied for second scoring honors with
six points apiece. However, the out
standing performance on the Jaysee
team was turned in by Henry
James, a second string guard, who
monopolized all the rebounds in the
first half.
Coach Wytze Gorter's neophytes
j displayed a well-balanced scoring
attack, with no less than 10 players
j breaking into the scoring column.
The Papooses, in spite of the im
. prcssive score, were handicapped by
late hours spent studying for mid
i terms and, aside from Williams,
| none of them were playing at top
j form.

Piling up another overwhelming victory'. Stanford's powerful frosh
cage team defeated San Francisco Junior College, 40-19, last night in the
local Pavilion.
Tile Rams started a combined second and third string team and as a
consequence found themselves on the short side of a 17-X half-time

j count. <
The Papooses started slowly and
didn't start to really move until the j
first half was well underway. With ;
| the score tied, 3-3, baskets by Don
| Williams, Don Burness and Bill
! Niccolls and a free throw by the
: latter swept the yearlings to a 10-3
i lead and sewed up the game for
them.
j After warming the bench for the
j entire first period, the Jaysee first
j team started the second half. How
j ever, the frosh began to really hit
S their form and literally deluged the
j Rams under a flood of buckets. Led
j by Don Williams, star forward, who
i scored 10 digits in the second half,
they ran the score quickly to 33-14,
■ and then handed it over to the re-
I serves.
Williams was by far the outstand
| ing man on the floor last night, tank
; ing seven field goals for 14 points
and high honors. In addition he
j contributed some brilliant aid to his
j teammates with his accurate pass
ing and alert pass interceptions.
Don Burness, Frosh center, and
Alex Opalinski, Ram pivot-man,
tied for second scoring honors with
six points apiece. However, the out
standing performance on the Jaysee
team was turned in by Henry
James, a second string guard, who
monopolized all the rebounds in the
first half.
Coach Wytze Gorter's neophytes
j displayed a well-balanced scoring
attack, with no less than 10 players
j breaking into the scoring column.
The Papooses, in spite of the im
. prcssive score, were handicapped by
late hours spent studying for mid
i terms and, aside from Williams,
| none of them were playing at top
j form.
