# Cards To Swim Against Athens Club Tonight
## Rider Leads Team To Oakland; Close Meet Anticipated 
### 
While the Stanford swimming
' team is favored to defeat the Ath- I
! ens Club in Oakland tonight, the
meet might be closer than i.s antici
pated.
The Athens aggregation has
| already been beaten by both Cal
! and San Jose State, but those two
j teams are considered to be the
I strongest in the bay area. Stan
i ford has not yet had a regular
meet. All competition thus far has
j been either in practice or in ajl-
I squad meets.
Win Needham and Captain Dave
Rider should take one-two in both
the 220 and the 440-yard free-style
i events. The two All-American
| twins raced to two unofficial dead
; heats last week-end and seem to
i improve with age.
' Don Towne will have his hands
full with Earl Teasdale of the Club
men. Teasdale is a former Califor
nia freshman who swam 2:34 for
the Bears. Towne's best this year
is nearly nine seconds slower for
the 200-yard event. Teasdale, how
ever, has been out of competition
and might not approach his best
mark.
A diver by the name of Muha is
being groomed to beat or extend
Roy Winkleman. Winkleman was
below form during the hailstorm last
j Saturday in the interclass meet and
is due for another All-American
1 performance. Ray Fremlin and
j Herb Wooley get their first chance
j in varsity competition and should
battle for third place.
If Dick Clarke is hot he should
win both the 50 and the 100 with
Johnny Brahtz trailing him. Either
Marsh Letteau or Hal Weatherbe
might come through in the back
stroke although their times are not
yet in the sensational category.

The number of U. S. cities pro
viding park recreation programs
has more than trebled during the
last 10 years.
