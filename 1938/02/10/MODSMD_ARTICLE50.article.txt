# X for Unknowns

FROM the appearance of ballots in Tues
day's election, more than one voter played
"tit-tat-toe" in marking X's in the appropriate
squares.
When Chairman Dick Riddell's election com
mittee started counting, they were introduced
to what might be termed the "diagonal" voting
system, whereby the voter —when six or sev
en candidates were running for office—started
at the top and marked diagonally across the
column.
This apparent indifference of voters is easily
explainable: voters can hardly be expected to
choose intelligently when they do not know
the candidates.
When the whole campus is called upon to
weigh the respective merits of candidates
chosen from, and representing, only a minor
part of that campus, confusion can be the only
result. It is like cracking nuts with a sledge
hammer.
The system of Ex Committee representation
by classes seems to be based on a fallacy, in
that those classes are not political units. Repre
sentation by such a method is principally a
matter of convenience, maintaining some ap
pearance of validity in the assumption that the
classes are social, if not political, entities.
But the system goes only part of the way
along the path of democracy. Although each
member of Ex Committee speaks for his class,
he is chosen by an electorate of which his
constituency is but a fourth part.
On a large scale, states choose members of
Congress from comparatively compact units.
To give the current system at Stanford a chance
to best fulfill its possibilities of representation,
the example of state governments might be fol
lowed to good advantage.
If it is true that early contacts in Encina and
Roble cement ties which remain unbroken by
later separation in Hall and Row residence, the
class should be allowed to keep its electoral
pi to itself. Too many campus cooks can spoil
the broth of campus representation as easily as
too few.
And when the sophomores set out to elect a
man on Ex Committee, the "diagonal" system
which the freshmen, juniors, and seniors use to
get in their licks, appears like waste of ink.
The placement of class members on Ex Com
mittee boils down to a system of nomination;
being elected by the campus as a whole, they
must represent a sprawling body with which
they have only partial contact.
Four pairs of hands are usually better than
one. But when you're trying to catch a gold
fish in a bowl, they just get in the way.—J. S.
