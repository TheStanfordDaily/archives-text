CLASSES will be dismissed tomorrow morn
ing when Vihlalmur Stefansson lectures
here, which means that Stanford's student body
will have the opportunity to choose between
"Transpolar Commerce by Air" and a cup of
Union coffee.
Similar occasions in the past have not of
fered enough of a fair chance to attract the bets
of sporting gentlemen. The attraction of cof
fee increases with the sguare of the time after
breakfast, and few lectures have been able to
lure the students away from the Cellar.
But this time the old statistics won't stand;
and any decent pari-mutuel system would give
the odds to Mr. Stefansson. Evidently the
Public Exercises Committee has gotten hold of
a good manual of salesmanship, and has boned
up on applied psychology, because in arrang
ing this lecture it showed a skill that would
do credit to the diplomatic corps. It has ob
tained one of the few speakers who could ap
peal to a lecture-shy student body, and it has
given him an educational subject upon which
he is gualified to speak. This is not a particu
larly subtle or complicated act, but it is one
which pitifully few universities ever perform.
One of the favorite traditions that hangs over
the shoulder of American education is the idea
that anything "cultural" is by nature hard to
take. It all goes back to the days when the
teacher kept a length of birch leaning against
his desk and students considered it good sport
to heave rocks through faculty windows. Edu
cation was something to be injected by force.
Today the ghost of that theory can often be
heard moaning gently through the tones of
lecturers. Universities frequently forget that ed
ucaion is now co-operative.
It would have been simple and inexpensive
for the Committee to get a lecturer on polar
ti.uisjXMl who could toll us things that oven

the Eskimos don't know yet. The only trouble
is that the students would not bother to attend
an ordinary speech. The average undergrad
uate hears about three lectures a day as it is,
and when he gets a lay-off, a coke or a short nap
has siren charms for him.
Almost any man who had studied the sub
ject could tell us about the arctic; he could give
us wind velocities, and ice drifts, and could
get us from Nome to Fairbanks in terms of
pemmican per dog-mile. But none t>f us would
be there to hear him.
Stefansson can't tell us much that a flat-chest
ed shoe clerk couldn't find out in a library.
But he can make us listen to him. He has the
explorer appeal that sets any man back on his
heels in these days when we feel proud over
picking the right street-car. Stefansson has
travelled 20,000 miles by dogsled, and that
means that he will have an audience where the
best informed man who uses the Southern Pa
cific would see only on expanse of red plush.
Perhaps the Public Exercises Committee has
kept the Union from declaring an extra divi
dend, but it has arranged a lecture that will put
some wear on the Memorial Hall seats. —J. C.

the Eskimos don't know yet. The only trouble
is that the students would not bother to attend
an ordinary speech. The average undergrad
uate hears about three lectures a day as it is,
and when he gets a lay-off, a coke or a short nap
has siren charms for him.
Almost any man who had studied the sub
ject could tell us about the arctic; he could give
us wind velocities, and ice drifts, and could
get us from Nome to Fairbanks in terms of
pemmican per dog-mile. But none t>f us would
be there to hear him.
Stefansson can't tell us much that a flat-chest
ed shoe clerk couldn't find out in a library.
But he can make us listen to him. He has the
explorer appeal that sets any man back on his
heels in these days when we feel proud over
picking the right street-car. Stefansson has
travelled 20,000 miles by dogsled, and that
means that he will have an audience where the
best informed man who uses the Southern Pa
cific would see only on expanse of red plush.
Perhaps the Public Exercises Committee has
kept the Union from declaring an extra divi

CLASSES will be dismissed tomorrow morn
ing when Vihlalmur Stefansson lectures
here, which means that Stanford's student body
will have the opportunity to choose between
"Transpolar Commerce by Air" and a cup of
Union coffee.
Similar occasions in the past have not of
fered enough of a fair chance to attract the bets
of sporting gentlemen. The attraction of cof
fee increases with the sguare of the time after
breakfast, and few lectures have been able to
lure the students away from the Cellar.
But this time the old statistics won't stand;
and any decent pari-mutuel system would give
the odds to Mr. Stefansson. Evidently the
Public Exercises Committee has gotten hold of
a good manual of salesmanship, and has boned
up on applied psychology, because in arrang
ing this lecture it showed a skill that would
do credit to the diplomatic corps. It has ob
tained one of the few speakers who could ap
peal to a lecture-shy student body, and it has
given him an educational subject upon which
he is gualified to speak. This is not a particu
larly subtle or complicated act, but it is one
which pitifully few universities ever perform.
One of the favorite traditions that hangs over
the shoulder of American education is the idea
that anything "cultural" is by nature hard to
take. It all goes back to the days when the
teacher kept a length of birch leaning against
his desk and students considered it good sport
to heave rocks through faculty windows. Edu
cation was something to be injected by force.
Today the ghost of that theory can often be
heard moaning gently through the tones of
lecturers. Universities frequently forget that ed
ucaion is now co-operative.
