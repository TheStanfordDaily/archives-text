BELLWETHER AND HAIRCUTS
I GOT into a rather interesting discussion with Emery
Bellwether yesterday, and for once it wasn't con
cerned with some deep moral problem. It was about
haircuts.
I hadn't seen the mad philosopher since he told me
about the Cord complex, and when I ran into him on
the Quad I was quite ready to stop and waste a little
time in my usual vain attempt to find out what makes
Bellwether's brain go round.
After we had talked for several moments, I noticed
that he was beginning to get a little annoyed; and in
a moment he broke off short and said, "Well?" in an
annoyed sort.of voice.
"Well what?"
"Don't you see it? Doesn't it hit you in the eye?
Aren't you impressed with it?"
"If you mean that purple shirt, Bellwether—"
"No, you fool. My haircut."
"Oh," I said, surprised. "Have you had a haircut?"
"Have I had a haircut! Just look at it!"
"I am, Bellwether; and it doesn't look much like a
haircut to me. I think you could get the same effect
by combing it a little differently."
"Do you mean it doesn't look like a haircut at all?"
"Well, it may be just that your neck's dirty, I don't
know, but there's cei'tainly something that shouldn't
be if you've had a haircut—"
"That's it. Anything for a bright crack. I'll have
you know I paid good money for this."
"Oh," I said, light beginning to dawn. "Then you
must have gotten it at—"
"I got it at a barber shop."
"No, Bellwether!"
"Yes, and may I ask what's wrong with barber
shops?"
"Oh, nothing, I suppose."
"I think they did a good job on me."
"Well, to be frank, Emery, it looks as though your
barber got called away very suddenly befoie he had
time to get really started."
"So! That's what you think of them, is it?"
"It is indeed. I've put down my 65 cents too often
not to have a deep-seated conviction that all they
do in that precious five minutes of their valuable time
is fix you up so that you'll have to return inside of the
week if you want to keep looking presentable."
"Well, I will admit that 65 cents is a good deal to
pay for what you get—"
"Which isn't much."
"And that their charry use of the scissors does seem
almost calculated at times. Still, they always have
the latest magazines for you to read."
"Bellwether," I said, "I fail to see what reading
matter —"
"And anyway, I'm going to cut my own hair after
this. With a cereal-bowl if necessary."
"You, Bellwether?"
He looked at me in some scorn.
"I refuse to go around any longer looking like John
L. Lewis. If I want to look like John L. Lewis I can
look like John L. Lewis, but I'll be darned if I'm go
ing to pay the barber shop 65 cents to help me look
like John L. Lewis."
"Certainly not, Bellwether," I said, completely
floored by his peculiar type of logic, "certainly not."

"I got it at a barber shop."
"No, Bellwether!"
"Yes, and may I ask what's wrong with barber
shops?"
"Oh, nothing, I suppose."
"I think they did a good job on me."
"Well, to be frank, Emery, it looks as though your
barber got called away very suddenly befoie he had
time to get really started."
"So! That's what you think of them, is it?"
"It is indeed. I've put down my 65 cents too often
not to have a deep-seated conviction that all they
do in that precious five minutes of their valuable time
is fix you up so that you'll have to return inside of the
week if you want to keep looking presentable."
"Well, I will admit that 65 cents is a good deal to
pay for what you get—"
"Which isn't much."
"And that their charry use of the scissors does seem
almost calculated at times. Still, they always have
the latest magazines for you to read."
"Bellwether," I said, "I fail to see what reading
matter —"
"And anyway, I'm going to cut my own hair after
this. With a cereal-bowl if necessary."
"You, Bellwether?"
He looked at me in some scorn.
"I refuse to go around any longer looking like John
L. Lewis. If I want to look like John L. Lewis I can
look like John L. Lewis, but I'll be darned if I'm go
ing to pay the barber shop 65 cents to help me look
like John L. Lewis."
"Certainly not, Bellwether," I said, completely
floored by his peculiar type of logic, "certainly not."

BELLWETHER AND HAIRCUTS
I GOT into a rather interesting discussion with Emery
Bellwether yesterday, and for once it wasn't con
cerned with some deep moral problem. It was about
haircuts.
I hadn't seen the mad philosopher since he told me
about the Cord complex, and when I ran into him on
the Quad I was quite ready to stop and waste a little
time in my usual vain attempt to find out what makes
Bellwether's brain go round.
After we had talked for several moments, I noticed
that he was beginning to get a little annoyed; and in
a moment he broke off short and said, "Well?" in an
annoyed sort.of voice.
"Well what?"
"Don't you see it? Doesn't it hit you in the eye?
Aren't you impressed with it?"
"If you mean that purple shirt, Bellwether—"
"No, you fool. My haircut."
"Oh," I said, surprised. "Have you had a haircut?"
"Have I had a haircut! Just look at it!"
"I am, Bellwether; and it doesn't look much like a
haircut to me. I think you could get the same effect
by combing it a little differently."
"Do you mean it doesn't look like a haircut at all?"
"Well, it may be just that your neck's dirty, I don't
know, but there's cei'tainly something that shouldn't
be if you've had a haircut—"
"That's it. Anything for a bright crack. I'll have
you know I paid good money for this."
"Oh," I said, light beginning to dawn. "Then you
must have gotten it at—"
"I got it at a barber shop."
"No, Bellwether!"
"Yes, and may I ask what's wrong with barber
shops?"
"Oh, nothing, I suppose."
"I think they did a good job on me."
