'yHINGS are lolling right along on San Francisco
stages these days. Headline attraction is Clare
Boothe's "The Women," with an all-female cast biting
into the picture of Park Avenue vixens. The men arc
given a chance to play eves-droppers to what goes on
when their belter halves retire to the privacy of their
own company. It's quite a show in its own way, and
you won't regret seeing this cat-scratch from one wo
man to another. It's at the Geary.
And just ending a two week's run on the Curran
stage is "Suspect," with Pauline Frederick. As the
title indicates, it's a mystery play, and scoi'ed a great
success in London. Which may mean almost anything.
You'll have to hurry if you want to see it, because it
closes Saturday night.
♦ * * *
But the big event is "Porgy and Bess" which fol
lows "Suspect" to the Curran on Monday. This is the
one to get tickets for—that is, if there are any left at
this late date. The late George Gershwin's folk opera
is the outstanding work in his career, and the cast is
the same one that played in New York, with Todd Dun
can, Anne Brown, and Ruth Elzy in the lead roles.
The production is that of Reuben Mammoulian, one
of the perpetual raves since he produced the play sev
eral years ago. It's Catfish Row, with Porgy trundling
around in his little goat-cart, with the clatter and bang
from slatternly tenament houses dinning into your
ears, and Gershwin's music sustaining the atmos
phere continually.
Of course, you've all sung and danced to some of
the songs: "I Got Plenty of Nothin'," "Summer-time,"
"Bess, You Is My Woman Now." and lots more. But
those are only the more singable songs (by amateurs)
of Gershwin's score; the whole thing is a fine piece of
work. All we have to say is, you had better go.

Not that it's important, but we hear that Disney is
doing a cartoon of "Ferdinand." Enough said. Stone.

Of course, you've all sung and danced to some of
the songs: "I Got Plenty of Nothin'," "Summer-time,"
"Bess, You Is My Woman Now." and lots more. But

of Gershwin's score; the whole thing is a fine piece of
work. All we have to say is, you had better go.

Not that it's important, but we hear that Disney is
doing a cartoon of "Ferdinand." Enough said. Stone.
