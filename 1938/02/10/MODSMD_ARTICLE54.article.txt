# CAMPUS OPINION
## DESIRES LIGHT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some students try to study where
there is quiet and a minimum of
distraction. What I would like to
know is how one is expected to
study, in a certain room on the Quad,
where three out of 12 lights are
burned out.
Now nine lights are plenty in any
one's language. But how in H . . .
can one see when the janitor comes
into the room and says he has been
given orders to cut down on the
electric bill, and accordingly turns
out five of the lights leaving only
four little globes burning in the
ceiling which is 18 feet from the
floor.
Sirs, I protest.â€”Dick Salz.
