# AILING SYSTEM
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May a lowly sophomore woman
be so bold as to ask for an inch or
so of your well-informed paper for
the purpose of exposing a "queer"
regulation here.
Girls away from home are sup
posed to be taken care of when ill.
Are they? Let us see.
If we are ill and unable to attend
classes, we must see the doctor per
sonally at the time of our illness at
the women's gymnasium in order to
get permission to go to the rest
home. iWth a cold in our chest,
aching bones, and chills we must
sally forth in sweeping wind and
rain to the gymnasium. After ar
riving there, we stand in line min
utes and sometimes an hour, be
fore we reach the head of the line.
A robot of efficiency asks our
name and we are then headed for
the doctor. Emerging from the in
ner sanctuaxy of the office, an en
velope containing small white pills
—"a remedy for all ailments"—
clutched in our hands, we head for
the rest home. Arriving there with
umbrella, pills, and PNEUMONIA,
we are sent to the hospital.
We have to go through this pro
cedure to get to the rest home.
Standard answers are given to our
questions so we have learned not to
question these regulations.
Why can't we go directly to the
rest home where they will take our
temperature and then worry about
rules?
Toppy
