the Pavilion tonight one of the
country's most famous "name"
bands. Nightly broadcasts from

the NBC airlanes last winter have

radio audiences. His arrangements,
some of which are being used by
Benny Goodman, are considered by
musicians to have a style and a
feeling all their own.
During the evening, on an ele
vated bandstand, the members of
the band will entertain the dancers
with some of their special numbers.
Students from Southern California
