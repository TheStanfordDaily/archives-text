# Big After-Show Dance Will Follow Staging Of 'Blue Jeans" Next Week
## 
### 
When the curtain rings down on
the last act of "Blue Jeans." a week
from tomorrow night, the audience,
for the first time in the history of
Farm dramatics, will head, not for
exits, but to the stage for a big
after-show dance—if plans are ap
proved by Ex Committee.
There will be practically no delay
as the props are swept from the
stage by Gene Callnon and his crew
and placed about to form an artistic
setting for the festivities. Plenty of
dancing room is assured by the fact
that the danceable part of the stage,
measuring 60 by 70 feet, will pro
vide approximately two-thirds as
much room as that used in the wom
en's gym.
A new and prominent peninsula
dance orchestra of 11 pieces, under
the direction of Les Smith has been
selected to provide the music from
the end of the show until university
rules stop dancing at 12 o'clock.
The orchestra, which includes two
vocalists, will play a variety of mu
sic—from the sedate to the "Big
Apple." Clay McDaniel, dramatic
manager, promises that popular de
mand will be ail that is needed to
produce a "Big Apple Session."

Catering to popular thirst will be
a "punch" concession as at other
campus dances, and plans are being
made to have the audience share
with the performers the traditional
after-show party.
No one will be admitted to the
dance who does not have a ticket
for the production.
The play itself will be of special
interest to many Farm theatergo
ers because of the fact that Marvin
Flavin, in writing "Blue Jeans,
which is centered about a lettuce
strike in a small town such as Sa
linas, anticipated the real Salinas
lettuce strike by just one month.
Asked whether or not he foresaw
I he st rike, Mr. Flavin replied, "No,
I didn't—that is not consciously, al
though there may have been some
thing in the air."
The title of the piny, explained Mr.
Flavin, was derived from the char
acteristic dress of the lettuce work
er —blue jeans. The play, itself, is
highly amusing and illustrative,
pointing out what happens when a
wealth of highly idealistic political
theories, such as are taught in many
universities, are subjected to the
one infallible test—practical use.
In the play, Jonathan Kirk, fresh

from a state university and filled to
the brim with ideas and hopes for a
Communistic Utopia for the work
ingman, dons blue jeans and pro
ceeds to inspire his father's lettuce
workers with a feeling of solidarity
and strength through the prolific use
of Marxian quotations. How his
good intentions are received by his
new proletarian comrades and the
inconsistent way he*continually be
moans his weakness for such capi
talistic institutions as chocolate cake,
marriage, and breakfast served in
bed are but some of the high spots
in the humor of the production.
Although the play is humorous
and satiric, it has its serious side in
the lettuce strike where ruthless
vigilantes armed with shotguns and
tear-gas battle the strikers armed
only with sticks and stones. The
satire pokes fun at some of our
farce mediums of law and justice,
and also makes light of some of the
inconsistencies of the New Deal and
"that man in Washington." Crown
ing insults hurled at each other by-
Jonathan and his father in ;» quar
rel: "New Dealer!"
Scats for "Blue Jeans" will go on
sale Monday. Feb. 14. at 9 o'clock
in the A S.S.U. offices.
