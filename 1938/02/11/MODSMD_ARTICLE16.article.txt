# Row Exchange Plan Approved
## Scholarship Replaces Bruce Tarver Award 
### 
Approval of the proposed inter
fraternity exchange scholarship was
unanimous last night at a meeting
of the Interfraternity Council in
the Phi Kappa Sigma house.
As a result of the decision, a Stan
ford fraternity senior will go abroad
next fall for a year's study at the
University of Heidelberg. Nomina
tions for the scholarship will be
made by each fraternity, and the
deadline for these nominations will
be during the first week of March,
according to Don Moulton, presi
dent of Council.
Advantages of Plan
In discussing the advantages of
the new scholarship Moulton said:
"This interfraternity exchange
scholarship should add tremendous
prestige to the fraternities here on
the campus, but the set-up is main
ly experimental and it is within the
power of this body to either amend
or revoke the scholarship."
'"The Bruce Macon Tarver Me
morial cash award that has been
given annually to the house show
ing the greatest scholastic improve
ment has not fulfilled its purpose v of
stimulating scholarship on the Row
and we intend to supplant this
scholarship with the new exchange
idea. However, the cUp that goes
to the house with the highest schol
astic rating will remain in com
petition."
Board to Choose
The Interfraternity Board of
Control will make the final selec
tion of the recipient of the scholar
ship after the houses have made
their nominations. This board is
composed of six students, three
members of the faculty including
Dean Culver, and two alumni. Basis
of the selection will be similar to
that of tiie Rhodes Scholarship.
Bob Adams, chairman of the body
that is considering minor changes in
the fraternity rushing and initiation
systems, requested that house rep
resentatives discuss suggestions at
their next house meetings. Harry
Raiter, Delt, George Farrell, Delta
Chi, and Bill Noll, Phi Kap. are
other members of the group.
