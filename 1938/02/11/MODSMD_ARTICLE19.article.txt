# Hoopsters Face Trojans Tonight
## Week-End Fills Are 'Acid Test'; Cards In Top Shape To Meet S. C. 
### HARRY PRESS 
Tlu-re always has to be an acid test, and it's here now for Stanford's
basket nailers.
There are two parts to this test, one of which is the pair of "crucials"
with U.S.C. tonight and tomorrow night in Los Angeles. The other section

♦has to do with the dual meeting of
1 Cal and JJ.C.L.A. in Berkeley.
John Bunri's Laughing Boys, who
j took a long time to start guffawing,
; scaring the nation's hoop fans half
j to death, are right now at the peak
! of their condition.
In this week's practice sessions,
; the first and second strings have
! been unstoppable in offense, im
i penetrable in defense. Terrific, in
I other words.
Yes, wonderful is the word for
■ the way the Stanford hoopsters have
developed into a team worthy of a
comparison with its two predeces
sors, winners of the Pacific Coast.
Championship crown two years in
a row.
And as for the other half of that
| acid test, which concerns Cal and
j U.C.L.A. In their first two games,
j the Bears slipped through two vic-

Tories by the last few hairs in the end
of their once-bushy tails. The
i scores were 39-37, and 32-27.
Those aren't great margins, even
if you go to Cal. The point is this:
Can the Bruins come through with
a win? If they do, the southern di
vision race will be tied up tighter
| than the proverbial sailor's knot.
Tied up, that is. if the Cards come
through with two wins. There are
J certain outlanders and Indian folks
who doubt the possibility of such a
happening.
Troy Plays Rough
Among such people is the em
j inent Mr. Sam "The Elevator Man"
Barry, who teaches his Trojan bas
' ketball rougher-uppers ballet danc-
I ing, among other things.
Backing Mr. Elevator in his be
liefs are fellows like Ralph Vaughan,
I hot-shot long-shot artist, and fol
low-througher deluxe. And then
| there are gentlemen such as Captain
Bill Remsen, Hal Dornsife, Carl An
derson. and Gail Goodrich, all of
whom are very fast, accurate, and
helpful. Helpful in that if they sec
an opponent falling, they will help
him—fall down.
Not agreeing in any respect with
I this school of thought, the Laughing
! Boys are ready and willing to blast
down the walls of Troy any day in
i the week and twice on Sundays.
Defense Closed
i The Stanford defense, which so
effectively stopped Cal last week,
j has been closed even tighter in
practice this week, the Southern Cal
! team will have a tough time getting
a man free. Offense has already been
I discussed—and the fast break, if it
I works as it did against the Bears,
will pass the Trojan rear guard ev
ery time.
Making the trip will be Captain
Hank Luisctti, Art Stoefen, Phil
j Zonne, Jack Calderwood, Beebs Let,
Darrel Huddleson, Leon Lafaille,
| Tom Siebert, Bob Zonne, Bob Bur
nett. Nellie Heath, and Gil Rahn.

Bill Remsen, Hal Dornsife, Carl An
derson. and Gail Goodrich, all of
whom are very fast, accurate, and
helpful. Helpful in that if they sec
an opponent falling, they will help
him—fall down.
Not agreeing in any respect with
I this school of thought, the Laughing
! Boys are ready and willing to blast
down the walls of Troy any day in
i the week and twice on Sundays.
Defense Closed
i The Stanford defense, which so
effectively stopped Cal last week,
j has been closed even tighter in
practice this week, the Southern Cal
! team will have a tough time getting
a man free. Offense has already been
I discussed—and the fast break, if it
I works as it did against the Bears,
will pass the Trojan rear guard ev
ery time.
Making the trip will be Captain
Hank Luisctti, Art Stoefen, Phil
j Zonne, Jack Calderwood, Beebs Let,
Darrel Huddleson, Leon Lafaille,
| Tom Siebert, Bob Zonne, Bob Bur
nett. Nellie Heath, and Gil Rahn.
Tlu-re always has to be an acid test, and it's here now for Stanford's
basket nailers.
There are two parts to this test, one of which is the pair of "crucials"
with U.S.C. tonight and tomorrow night in Los Angeles. The other section

♦has to do with the dual meeting of
1 Cal and JJ.C.L.A. in Berkeley.
John Bunri's Laughing Boys, who
j took a long time to start guffawing,
; scaring the nation's hoop fans half
j to death, are right now at the peak
! of their condition.
In this week's practice sessions,
; the first and second strings have
! been unstoppable in offense, im
i penetrable in defense. Terrific, in
I other words.
Yes, wonderful is the word for
■ the way the Stanford hoopsters have
developed into a team worthy of a
comparison with its two predeces
sors, winners of the Pacific Coast.
Championship crown two years in
a row.
And as for the other half of that
| acid test, which concerns Cal and
j U.C.L.A. In their first two games,
j the Bears slipped through two vic-

Tories by the last few hairs in the end
of their once-bushy tails. The
i scores were 39-37, and 32-27.
Those aren't great margins, even
if you go to Cal. The point is this:
Can the Bruins come through with
a win? If they do, the southern di
vision race will be tied up tighter
| than the proverbial sailor's knot.
Tied up, that is. if the Cards come
through with two wins. There are
J certain outlanders and Indian folks
who doubt the possibility of such a
happening.
Troy Plays Rough
Among such people is the em
j inent Mr. Sam "The Elevator Man"
Barry, who teaches his Trojan bas
' ketball rougher-uppers ballet danc-
I ing, among other things.
Backing Mr. Elevator in his be
liefs are fellows like Ralph Vaughan,
I hot-shot long-shot artist, and fol
low-througher deluxe. And then
| there are gentlemen such as Captain
Bill Remsen, Hal Dornsife, Carl An
derson. and Gail Goodrich, all of
whom are very fast, accurate, and
helpful. Helpful in that if they sec
an opponent falling, they will help
him—fall down.
