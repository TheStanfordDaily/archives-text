# CAMPUS OPINION
## EXCHANGE STUDENT SPEAKS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have read with interest the
comments made in these columns
the past few days concerning Ger
many and the Interfraternity Schol
arship. As an exchange student last
year in Heidelberg 1 feel that 1 may
be able to mete out a bit of first
hand information concerning the
"swastika-land" and its relationship
with foreign students.
As a prelude to Germany proper
I should like to elucidate one more
point made by Allen Drury in "Bull
Session." He said, "If exchange
scholarships are to have any real
value, they must exist between
countries which allow a free inter
play of ideas and knowledge." This
statement forces into the open the
true purpose of scholarship. If it
is to be purely scholastic, where
the work to be accomplished de
pends upon reliable sources and
investigation, why must the schol
arship be granted for a foreign uni
versity? These requisites would be
well met by a "fifth" year at Stan
ford.
However, I do not believe that
the strictly academic aspect is the
quality most desired by the Inter
fraternity Council as regards this
award.
Change Desirable
If, then, it is not,- I believe that
a complete change of view is a de
sirable thing.
I shall avoid the question of
whether or not Germany's post-war
situation necessitates its present po
litical doctrine, stating only the ob
vious, that contemporary thought
and purpose in Germany differs
from our own. The history-making
episodes in Germany today, govern
mental action and contemporary
thought, all so different, make it
an admirable place for an analyt
ical American college student to
compare notes, to test Germany's
propaganda, and to test our own
reports of happenings in the Vater
land.
Reasons for Praise
If other countries were too hastily
considered by the committee, I say,
"Consider them." Surely France,
England, Switzerland and Holland
are wonderful, but there are rea
sons, other than scholastic, for the
praises sung of Germany and its
universities. The people and the
landschaft and—well —the beer.
But, and more practically, other

than these cliches, I should Wke to
mention the wonderful machinery
built up by the government on be
half of the exchange students. In
most of the universities, having an
appreciable number of foreign stu
dents, a Foreign Students' Club is
organized. These organizations,
which in name and spirit fete the
foreigners, are truly the hub of the
I school activities, so that our ex
change student has an excellent op
portunity to meet and become inti
mately acquainted with Germans.
Beyond this there are marvelous
reductions offered students upon the
trains, planes, the opera, museums.
! etc. Each year the Carl Schurtz
Vereiniging, an organization which
! fosters better German-American
relations, gives the American ex
change students a two weeks' trip
through some parr of Germany, dur
ing which time we Americans were
made to feel more like visiting roy
alty than merely students.
Concept Clarified
Most important is the clarification
| of the prevalent concept that our
, students in Germany are terribly
censored in action, word, and deed.
For me, last year was one of the
1 freest of my life, certainly one of
the best. There was no compulsion
j from any source of any consequence.
Naturally, there was red-tape, but,
in spirit, we wore in no way re
frained from doing anything we
! normally would have considered,
i We chose our lodgings where we
wished. Our discussions and argu
[ ments upon all subjects, including
J politics, were carried on unabated,
j In the universities many of the de
partments teach their subjects with
'an "open-mindedness" that would
do credit to us. In others, a point
of view is taught. I found it inter
esting to hear another so new to
me.
If, as Allen Drury said, nothing
more scholastically is gained in
Germany today than "a realization
of totalitarianism's inadequacy," is
jnot that of value?
But answers whether Germany is
right or wrong, whether or not dic
tatorship is the answer, I think will
not be the most valuable things
learned from a year's stay in Ger
many.
I think the most startling thing to
me was the nearness to true values
I that simplicity can gain, a proxim
' ity not equalled by incomplete edu
cation.

statement forces into the open the
true purpose of scholarship. If it
is to be purely scholastic, where
the work to be accomplished de
pends upon reliable sources and
investigation, why must the schol
arship be granted for a foreign uni
versity? These requisites would be
well met by a "fifth" year at Stan
ford.
However, I do not believe that
the strictly academic aspect is the
quality most desired by the Inter
fraternity Council as regards this
award.
Change Desirable
If, then, it is not,- I believe that
a complete change of view is a de
sirable thing.
I shall avoid the question of
whether or not Germany's post-war
situation necessitates its present po
litical doctrine, stating only the ob
vious, that contemporary thought
and purpose in Germany differs
from our own. The history-making
episodes in Germany today, govern
mental action and contemporary
thought, all so different, make it
an admirable place for an analyt
ical American college student to
compare notes, to test Germany's
propaganda, and to test our own
reports of happenings in the Vater
land.
Reasons for Praise
If other countries were too hastily
considered by the committee, I say,
"Consider them." Surely France,
England, Switzerland and Holland
are wonderful, but there are rea
sons, other than scholastic, for the
praises sung of Germany and its
universities. The people and the
landschaft and—well —the beer.
But, and more practically, other

than these cliches, I should Wke to
mention the wonderful machinery
built up by the government on be
half of the exchange students. In
most of the universities, having an
appreciable number of foreign stu
dents, a Foreign Students' Club is
organized. These organizations,
which in name and spirit fete the
foreigners, are truly the hub of the
I school activities, so that our ex
change student has an excellent op
portunity to meet and become inti
mately acquainted with Germans.
Beyond this there are marvelous
reductions offered students upon the
trains, planes, the opera, museums.
! etc. Each year the Carl Schurtz
Vereiniging, an organization which
! fosters better German-American
relations, gives the American ex
change students a two weeks' trip
through some parr of Germany, dur
ing which time we Americans were
made to feel more like visiting roy
alty than merely students.
Concept Clarified
Most important is the clarification
| of the prevalent concept that our
, students in Germany are terribly
censored in action, word, and deed.
For me, last year was one of the
1 freest of my life, certainly one of
the best. There was no compulsion
j from any source of any consequence.
Naturally, there was red-tape, but,
in spirit, we wore in no way re
frained from doing anything we
! normally would have considered,
i We chose our lodgings where we
wished. Our discussions and argu
[ ments upon all subjects, including
J politics, were carried on unabated,
j In the universities many of the de
partments teach their subjects with
'an "open-mindedness" that would
do credit to us. In others, a point
of view is taught. I found it inter
esting to hear another so new to
me.
If, as Allen Drury said, nothing
more scholastically is gained in
Germany today than "a realization
of totalitarianism's inadequacy," is
jnot that of value?
But answers whether Germany is
right or wrong, whether or not dic
tatorship is the answer, I think will
not be the most valuable things
learned from a year's stay in Ger
many.
I think the most startling thing to
me was the nearness to true values
I that simplicity can gain, a proxim
' ity not equalled by incomplete edu
cation.

whether or not Germany's post-war
situation necessitates its present po
litical doctrine, stating only the ob
vious, that contemporary thought
and purpose in Germany differs
from our own. The history-making
episodes in Germany today, govern
mental action and contemporary
thought, all so different, make it
an admirable place for an analyt
ical American college student to
compare notes, to test Germany's
propaganda, and to test our own
reports of happenings in the Vater
land.
Reasons for Praise
If other countries were too hastily
considered by the committee, I say,
"Consider them." Surely France,
England, Switzerland and Holland
are wonderful, but there are rea
sons, other than scholastic, for the
praises sung of Germany and its
universities. The people and the
landschaft and—well —the beer.
But, and more practically, other

than these cliches, I should Wke to
mention the wonderful machinery
built up by the government on be
half of the exchange students. In
most of the universities, having an
appreciable number of foreign stu
dents, a Foreign Students' Club is
organized. These organizations,
which in name and spirit fete the
foreigners, are truly the hub of the
I school activities, so that our ex
change student has an excellent op
portunity to meet and become inti
mately acquainted with Germans.
Beyond this there are marvelous
reductions offered students upon the
trains, planes, the opera, museums.
! etc. Each year the Carl Schurtz
Vereiniging, an organization which
! fosters better German-American
relations, gives the American ex
change students a two weeks' trip
through some parr of Germany, dur
ing which time we Americans were
made to feel more like visiting roy
alty than merely students.
Concept Clarified
Most important is the clarification
| of the prevalent concept that our
, students in Germany are terribly
censored in action, word, and deed.
For me, last year was one of the
1 freest of my life, certainly one of
the best. There was no compulsion
j from any source of any consequence.
Naturally, there was red-tape, but,
in spirit, we wore in no way re
frained from doing anything we
! normally would have considered,
i We chose our lodgings where we
wished. Our discussions and argu
[ ments upon all subjects, including
J politics, were carried on unabated,
j In the universities many of the de
partments teach their subjects with
'an "open-mindedness" that would
do credit to us. In others, a point
of view is taught. I found it inter
esting to hear another so new to
me.
If, as Allen Drury said, nothing
more scholastically is gained in
Germany today than "a realization
of totalitarianism's inadequacy," is
jnot that of value?
But answers whether Germany is
right or wrong, whether or not dic
tatorship is the answer, I think will
not be the most valuable things
learned from a year's stay in Ger
many.
I think the most startling thing to
me was the nearness to true values
I that simplicity can gain, a proxim
' ity not equalled by incomplete edu
cation.
