students and professors, according

At the discussion yesterday in
the Nitery, about 50 students and
several faculty members talked
about everything but academic sub
jects. Edwin Maslin Hulme,
Charles A. Barker, David Harris,
and Max Savelle were among the
professors taking part in the meet
ing. Dr. Savelle brought with him
Dr. and Mrs. Edwin Earle of Prince
ton University, who became inter
ested participants in the meeting.
Dr. Savelle said the meetings had
his "one hundred per cent approval."
He expressed the opinion that the

more informal they are, the Detter.
According to Savelle, "students
should get to know their profes
sors as individuals, not as lecturers
and 'brain-trusts.' There is no rea
son why only independent-study
students should know their pro
fessors."
According to Putzie Hinrichs,
chairman of the Student - Faculty
Committee, the Thursday afternoon
discussions definitely will be con
tinued. following the success of their
second trial.
