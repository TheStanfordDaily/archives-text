H. H. Hall, chief enginee. of the
Standard Oil Company, will be the
principal speakers.
Also present to outline briefly
their functions will be the four stu

professional societies, A.S.M.E.,
A.1.E.E., A.SG.E., and G. & M. S.
The dinner is being arranged by
Franklin Lindsay, and tickets are
on sale at the A.S.S.U. office for 75
cents. All planning to attend are
urged to buy tickets early because
the supply is limited.
