### BILL MILLIS 
"Europe reminded me of a. mus
eum; it's face was turned to the
past," former Daily Editor Bob
Jones told approximately 25 stu
dents and faculty members at the
Sigma Delta Chi-Theta Sigma Phi
journalism luncheon yesterday noon
in the Union Alcove.
Speaking on the topic of "What
Opportunity for College Journal
ists?", Jones, who is now a mem
ber of the staff of the San Francisco
Chronicle, discussed mainly his ex
periences in Spain as a United Press
reporter and his travels in Europe
and Asia during 1936.
Arriving in Paris just three days
before the Spanish civil war began
18 months ago, Jones said that he
left for Hendaye on the Spanish
frontier despite the advice of Ralph
Hines, Paris manager of the United
Press. Because he couldn't speak
enough French to buy a ticket, on a
Sunday, Mr. Jones, who was cdilor
of Volume 88 of The Daily, had to
wait until Monday when 1 ravel
agencies were open before leaving.
Delayed At Border
Delayed several days at Hendaye,
France, because of the chaotic con
ditions and uncertainty of the open
ing of the Spanish war, Mr. Jones
said that on July 18, five days after
fighting broke out, he started out
with a party of four other news
papermen to get into Spain.
John Eliot, of the New York Her
ald Tribune, and three other British
and American journalists were with
Jones when they started in a taxicab
up a narrow mountain road to the
war.
After driving for 30 miles along
the border to find a place to enter,
Mr. Jones related that the party

was allowed to enter Navarre Prov
ince and then proceed to Pamplona,
in territory at that time and since
held by Insurgent General Franco.
Starts As Courier
"On his own" and not actually
representing any newspaper or press
agency when he first went to Spain,
Jones for several w.eeks was a cour
ier bringing press dispatches back 10
the French border. Later, he was
appointed assistant to United Press
Correspondent Reynolds Packard.
Describing Spain as a "medieval
country" lacking machinery and with
a large percentage of illiteracy, Mr.
Jones emphasized that the Spanish
war "is not a conflict between the
window-dressing labels of Com
munism and Fascism."
Comparing the rebels to extra
legal "law and order" groups in this
country, Mr. Jones declared that
the present war is an outgrowth of
"a conflict between the feudalists
system and modern ways."
After leaving Spain, Mr. Jones was
a correspondent at Geneva, where
he was "impressed by the feeling of
insincerity of the delegates from
large countries to the League of
Nations."
While in Berlin, Mr. Jones said
that he "couldn't see Hitler because
there were so many soldiers in the
way."
From Europe the former Stanford
journalist traveled to Asia and the
Far East, where he reported that
the Dutch colonial officials "are
looking now to the United States,
rather than England, as a 'big bro
ther'."

Urging college journalists to tra
vel, through this country if not
Europe, following graduation, Mr.
Jones concluded by telling of an
experience when traveling from
North China to Manchukuo.
Although officers in Japan con
tinuously questioned him, Jones said
j he didn't expect the question of a
customs inspector at the foot of the
Great Wall.
The officer, a Stanford graduate,
asked:
"How did the Big Game come
out?"
Jones told him.

Although officers in Japan con
tinuously questioned him, Jones said
j he didn't expect the question of a
customs inspector at the foot of the
Great Wall.
The officer, a Stanford graduate,
asked:
"How did the Big Game come
out?"
Jones told him.
"Europe reminded me of a. mus
eum; it's face was turned to the
past," former Daily Editor Bob
Jones told approximately 25 stu
dents and faculty members at the
Sigma Delta Chi-Theta Sigma Phi
journalism luncheon yesterday noon
in the Union Alcove.
Speaking on the topic of "What
Opportunity for College Journal
ists?", Jones, who is now a mem
ber of the staff of the San Francisco
Chronicle, discussed mainly his ex
periences in Spain as a United Press
reporter and his travels in Europe
and Asia during 1936.
Arriving in Paris just three days
before the Spanish civil war began
18 months ago, Jones said that he
left for Hendaye on the Spanish
frontier despite the advice of Ralph
Hines, Paris manager of the United
Press. Because he couldn't speak
enough French to buy a ticket, on a
Sunday, Mr. Jones, who was cdilor
of Volume 88 of The Daily, had to
wait until Monday when 1 ravel
agencies were open before leaving.
Delayed At Border
Delayed several days at Hendaye,
France, because of the chaotic con
ditions and uncertainty of the open
ing of the Spanish war, Mr. Jones
said that on July 18, five days after
fighting broke out, he started out
with a party of four other news
papermen to get into Spain.
John Eliot, of the New York Her
ald Tribune, and three other British
and American journalists were with
Jones when they started in a taxicab
up a narrow mountain road to the
war.
After driving for 30 miles along
the border to find a place to enter,
Mr. Jones related that the party

was allowed to enter Navarre Prov
ince and then proceed to Pamplona,
in territory at that time and since
held by Insurgent General Franco.
Starts As Courier
"On his own" and not actually
representing any newspaper or press
agency when he first went to Spain,
Jones for several w.eeks was a cour
ier bringing press dispatches back 10
the French border. Later, he was
appointed assistant to United Press
Correspondent Reynolds Packard.
Describing Spain as a "medieval
country" lacking machinery and with
a large percentage of illiteracy, Mr.
Jones emphasized that the Spanish
war "is not a conflict between the
window-dressing labels of Com
munism and Fascism."
Comparing the rebels to extra
legal "law and order" groups in this
country, Mr. Jones declared that
the present war is an outgrowth of
"a conflict between the feudalists
system and modern ways."
After leaving Spain, Mr. Jones was
a correspondent at Geneva, where
he was "impressed by the feeling of
insincerity of the delegates from
large countries to the League of
Nations."
While in Berlin, Mr. Jones said
that he "couldn't see Hitler because
there were so many soldiers in the
way."
From Europe the former Stanford
journalist traveled to Asia and the
Far East, where he reported that
the Dutch colonial officials "are
looking now to the United States,
rather than England, as a 'big bro
ther'."

Urging college journalists to tra
vel, through this country if not
Europe, following graduation, Mr.
Jones concluded by telling of an
experience when traveling from
North China to Manchukuo.
