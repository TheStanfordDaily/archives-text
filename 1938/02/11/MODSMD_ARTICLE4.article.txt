### 
"Radio is a small field and a
tough one to get into," M. C. Mor
gan, production manager of radio
station KSFO in San Francisco, told
a group of students assembled at a
Vocational Guidance meeting held
last night at the Nitery.
Mr. Morgan said it is hard to ob
tain a good job evren with talent un
less you have had experience. "One
way to gain it is to work in one of
the smaller stations that trades ex
perience for service with no salary,
while another way is to get a job
around the office and work up,' he
said.
"There is a place in radio for
women if they are willing to make
it a 24-hour job," says Mr. Morgan.
Women produce and direct a few
educational and other sustained
programs.
Salary possibilities a r e limited. As
in other dramatic fields, salaries are
either very low or very high. There
is no middle level. "If you are
really interested in radio work,"
said Mr. Morgan, be persistent and
you will get an opening eventually."
