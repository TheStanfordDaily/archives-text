CATASTROPHE
IS NEAR
At the start of the regular rugbj
season, the California Rugby Unior
established a four-way league, tc
include Stanford and Cal freshmer
and Menlo and Santa Rosa junioi
colleges. A grand trophy was pul
up for the winner, and even now il
reposes in Coach Harry Maloney's
desk in Encina Gym.
There were hopes at the start of
the season that such a league would
be beneficial, and all the schools en
tered into the thing wholeheartedly.
At the present time, three of
the four league members have
lively teams that are getting along
well, just waiting for league play
to start. The Stanford frosh have
almost conked out.
Harry Maloney voiced an appeal
yesterday to all freshmen to come
out and have a try at the game, and
give Stanford a team that can ful
fill its obligation and compete in the
league. Not only is the proposition
one of saving face in respect to
other members of the new league,
but it involves saving face right here
on the campus.
Coach Maloney had 1(5 kids out
for the team—ls make up a start
ing lineup — and he graciously
s.'nt four of them to Bill Elling
ton, frosh track coach, because
he heard they were good weight
men. Coach Bill sent none hack
in return, and the frosh team is
shot in the eye—unless some re
placements come out of (he ranks
or the freshman class.
of freshman football players out for
freshman football players out for
the squad, and if there's anyplace a
football player should be found dur
in."; spring, besides spring grid prac
tice, it's on a rugby field. The sport
ofiers great opportunities to keep in
shape, to learn a lot about ball
hcndling, and to keep sharp on
fundamentals in general.
TIIE SPORT IS
WORTH THE TRY
There are a flock of last fall's
frosh players vvho are just idling
now, as far as sports are concerned.
A lew are out for baseball, a couple
for basketball, maybe some in the
other sports. But there are plenty of
those kids who aren't out for some
thing and really would get a kick
out of rugby if they'd give it a try.
If something isn't done about this
thing right away—immediately, if
not sooner—Stanford is going to fall
down on a bargain. It will be the
first time in a long while that such
a thing has happened.
The Class of '41 looked pretty
tough in football, and its basketball
team recovered from a slump on
nothing but fight—wonder what it
will look like on a rugby field?
THERE MIGHT BE
ROOM FOR ANOTHER
There has been a little talk—not
much, but a little—around the cam
pus lately about establishing some
sort of a 145-pound basketball team.
It has been the small fellows about
the campus, of course, who want
such a team.
There is no doubt that there is
something in what they say, for the
competition is too great on a varsity
team for any kid weighing 145
pounds or less to get by. He might
get along, hut he would have to be
so phenomenal to compete with the
Coast Conference teams that Lui
setti would be pale in comparison. 1
California and U.C.L.A. have the
peewee teams, and the sport is go
ing along very successfully, it
seems. The Bear squad has just
completed a 14-game barnstorming
tour of the state of Florida in which
it was undefeated.
Whether the sport could be as
successful here at Stanford is open
to question. Both U.C.L.A. and Cal
have student bodies considerably
more than twice as large as ours,'
and there is certain to be more in
terest. The argument might be put
that Stanford competes the same;
way in all other sports with these
schools, and always manages to hold
up her head.
At any rate, 145-pound basketball
is worth thinking over.—Peterson.

CATASTROPHE
IS NEAR
At the start of the regular rugbj
season, the California Rugby Unior
established a four-way league, tc
include Stanford and Cal freshmer
and Menlo and Santa Rosa junioi
colleges. A grand trophy was pul
up for the winner, and even now il
reposes in Coach Harry Maloney's
desk in Encina Gym.
There were hopes at the start of
the season that such a league would
be beneficial, and all the schools en
tered into the thing wholeheartedly.
At the present time, three of
the four league members have
lively teams that are getting along
well, just waiting for league play
to start. The Stanford frosh have
almost conked out.
Harry Maloney voiced an appeal
yesterday to all freshmen to come
out and have a try at the game, and
give Stanford a team that can ful
fill its obligation and compete in the
league. Not only is the proposition
one of saving face in respect to
other members of the new league,
but it involves saving face right here
on the campus.
Coach Maloney had 1(5 kids out
for the team—ls make up a start
ing lineup — and he graciously
s.'nt four of them to Bill Elling
ton, frosh track coach, because
he heard they were good weight
men. Coach Bill sent none hack

TIIE SPORT IS
WORTH THE TRY
There are a flock of last fall's
frosh players vvho are just idling
now, as far as sports are concerned.
A lew are out for baseball, a couple
for basketball, maybe some in the
other sports. But there are plenty of
those kids who aren't out for some
thing and really would get a kick
out of rugby if they'd give it a try.
If something isn't done about this
thing right away—immediately, if
not sooner—Stanford is going to fall
down on a bargain. It will be the
first time in a long while that such
a thing has happened.
The Class of '41 looked pretty
tough in football, and its basketball
team recovered from a slump on
nothing but fight—wonder what it
will look like on a rugby field?
THERE MIGHT BE
ROOM FOR ANOTHER
There has been a little talk—not
much, but a little—around the cam
pus lately about establishing some
sort of a 145-pound basketball team.
It has been the small fellows about
the campus, of course, who want
such a team.
There is no doubt that there is
something in what they say, for the
competition is too great on a varsity
team for any kid weighing 145

get along, hut he would have to be
so phenomenal to compete with the
