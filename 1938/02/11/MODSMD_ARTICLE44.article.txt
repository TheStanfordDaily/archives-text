# Frosh To Meet Piedmont Hoopmen
## Prep Team Will Point For Upset Highlander Quintet Will Attempt To End Papoose Win Streak 
### 
Riding on the crest of a winning
j streak, Stanford's frosh clash with
! a strong quintet from Piedmont High
School tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock in the Pavilion.
i Coach Basil Peterson's Highland
; ers are the strongest team in the
Alameda County League and are a
match for any prep team in the Bay
Region. Employing a whirling, fast
moving offense and a dogged de
-1 fense, Piedmont is pointing for an
upset win over the Papooses.
Win 11 Starts
Winners of 11 of their 14 Starts,
I the Papooses continue to improve
with every game. Don Williams,
flashy forward, has been playing
consistent ball in every contest and
every once in a while blossoms out
with a brilliant performance as he
; did against S.F.J.C.
Mike Marshall, the other starting
forward, is out to make up for his
three-point performance against the
Rams. Mike has tallied 20 points in
two games this season. Don Burness
has been playing hot and cold ball '
in the center spot, but he is always i
in there when the going is the tough- !
est.
Defense Strong
Defensively, Kenny Davidson and
Bill Niccolls have been turning in '
workmanlike jobs. Holding the ;
strong S.F.J.C. team to a mere 19 j
points is no mean feat. Davidson
is also an offensive threat, and a J
steady cog in the passing attack.
Niccolls has covered every square
inch of the Pavilion floor with his
wild, but successful, head-long
leaps after stray balls.
Probable lineups:
STANFORD— —PIEDMONT
Williams F Nutting
Marshall F McCann
Burness C Dana
Davidson G Witter
Niccolls G McCaffery
