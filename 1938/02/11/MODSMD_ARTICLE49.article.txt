# Ski Clubbers Head For Yosemite
## 
### 
The Ski Club is not sponsoring
any large trips this week-end. due
to various campus activities. Only
about 30 people have signed up for
Yosemite and other snow trips to
day, although more are expected
to come tomorrow, after the Jun
ior Prom. Those who wish to go
and have not yet signed up at the
A.S.S.U. office should do so by to
night.
The Mount Lassen meet scheduled
for this week-end has been post
poned as the roads are closed by
heavy snows. The Stanford Ski
Team had planned to attend.
The next really important Ski

Club trip will be March 5. There
will be different races and jumps
for both men and women. The club
president, Willy Meyer, expects
about 200 to attend, as the trip
should be of interest to everyone.
Members expecting to take the trip
can sign up now at the A.S.S.U.
office.
At the Ski Club meeting next
Wednesday three movies will be
shown. They will not be longer than
one hour, and should be very in
teresting to all members. Willy
Meyer has seen the pictures before,
and says that they are some of the
best ski pictures he has seen. All
members that can possibly attend
the meeting should do so.
