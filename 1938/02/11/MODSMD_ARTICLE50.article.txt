# Freshmen Nine to Play Commerce High Today
## Sunny Spell Leaves Slopes For Dry field 
### 
It looks very much as if the frosh
baseballers are going to lose their
third inning with the weather.
Third scheduled game of their
season, against Commerce High
School, is supposed to to
day. Whether it will be, depends
much on the elements, and in all
probability another cancellation will
result.
A v/eek ago today the Papooses
were supposed to make their 1938
bow against the yearlings from San
ta Clara. Tuesday, Feb. 8, was sup
posed to see them slugging it out
against Marin J. C. Hard luck kept
them from seeing action both times,
as the rainy season showed 110 de
sire to let up.
It they are able to take the field
against Commerce High today, the
Farm will see a freshman baseball
nine that looks as though it will
stack up well in relation to any other
one Encina hits produced for a long
time. The well rounded squad, one
that is deep in every position, should
go to town this year.
Although the Injun babes have a
record of .000 games played, won.
and lost to date, their record should
lean formidably toward the win
column. However, not playing in
a definite league for a definite
league championship, their three
game series with the Cal Cubs is
the objective to point for, and three
wins there will satisfy them, no
matter how many other encounters
are rained out.
Fifteen games are on tap before
that first tilt with Cal, coming up
on April 8. With nearly two months
of practice behind them now, that
means that the Encina gang will be
missing no tricks when the gong
sounds. Further strength will be
added in the form of the basket
ballers, Marshal, Ditlevson, and
Masters, who plan on turning out
on the diamond as soon as the ca
saba season ends in March.
Today at 3:30 o'clock on the frosh
diamond, the lineup will in all prob
ability be the one that would have
begun the last two mud baths.
Quent Thompson and Herb Atkin
son should be the battery. Ush
Tucker on first, Monte Phyl at sec
ond. Elton Boone on third, and Herb
Bull at short will comprise the in
field.

bow against the yearlings from San
ta Clara. Tuesday, Feb. 8, was sup
posed to see them slugging it out
against Marin J. C. Hard luck kept
them from seeing action both times,
as the rainy season showed 110 de
sire to let up.
It they are able to take the field
against Commerce High today, the
Farm will see a freshman baseball
nine that looks as though it will
stack up well in relation to any other
one Encina hits produced for a long
time. The well rounded squad, one
that is deep in every position, should
go to town this year.
Although the Injun babes have a
record of .000 games played, won.
and lost to date, their record should
lean formidably toward the win
column. However, not playing in
a definite league for a definite
league championship, their three
game series with the Cal Cubs is
the objective to point for, and three
wins there will satisfy them, no
matter how many other encounters
are rained out.
Fifteen games are on tap before
that first tilt with Cal, coming up
on April 8. With nearly two months
of practice behind them now, that
means that the Encina gang will be
missing no tricks when the gong
sounds. Further strength will be
added in the form of the basket
ballers, Marshal, Ditlevson, and
Masters, who plan on turning out
on the diamond as soon as the ca
saba season ends in March.
Today at 3:30 o'clock on the frosh
diamond, the lineup will in all prob
ability be the one that would have
begun the last two mud baths.
Quent Thompson and Herb Atkin
son should be the battery. Ush
Tucker on first, Monte Phyl at sec
ond. Elton Boone on third, and Herb
Bull at short will comprise the in
field.
