Art Doering, who next week will
i lead a host of Stanford contenders
! for the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
, Golf Championship at Pebble Beach,
I yesterday failed to qualify for the
i National Match Play Open by the
' narrow margin of three strokes.
After splashing around the rain
' soaked course in an 8.3 in the open
ing round Tuesday, Doering came
back with a brilliant 78 yesterday
for a total of 161, just three strokes
j over the qualifying mark of 15$.
j Doering's 1(51 was the lowest score
turned in by any amateur in the
tournament.
