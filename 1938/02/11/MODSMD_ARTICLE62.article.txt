Coach Ken Edwards announced
yesterday that the Card gymnastic
team would take on California here
the night of March 4. Workouts are
being held daily in preparation for
the meet.
According to Edwards, Lomax
Turner has looked particularly im

place high in the coming competi

are other standouts rounding into
shape.
