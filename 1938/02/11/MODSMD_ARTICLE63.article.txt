## 
### 
Bob Underweod, captain of the
Card tennis team, was tough, but
not tough enough to knock num
! ber one-seeded John Murio out of
1 the Northern California Indoor Tcn
! nis Tourney in a match on the
courts in the Palace of Fine Arts
Building in San Francisco last
night. Murio, in top form, beat Un-
I derwood 6-4, 6-2 in a third-round
I encounter.
Although idle last night, Under
j wood and Bob Pommel', defending
j champs in the doubles, were still
j the class of a strong field. The pair
have gone through two rounds
I without being extended. If Lloyd
j Gates and Myron Folsom, varsity
| doubles combination, come through
j their brackets, the two teams will
I meet in the next round.

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 10 (UP).

prominent San Francisco family and

Moody Jr., divorced husband of
