WITH "Winter's Tale" playing to a full house,
stock quotations on Speech and Drama En
terprises are rising after the recession days of
"The Governor's Wife."
The success of "Winter's Tale" might be
laid to Shakespeare, to Thomas Woods Stev
en's reputation as a producer, or to the weather.
But audiences are coming to the Little Theater
primarily because they are seeing good the
ater, well done.
Two other productions this year offer strik
ing contrasts in audience appeal. "Murder in
the Cathedral," admittedly a difficult drama
to stage, was effective because of the treat
ment given it. Although it was over the heads
of all but a few of the audience, it was an artis
tic success. "Governor's Wife," likewise, pre
sented enough problems to an amateur cast to
be worth doing from the Division's point of
view; but it failed because the production it
self was unequal to the demands placed upon it.
"Winter's Tale" seems to have hit the happy
medium.
Apparent even in this week's play is the
handicap of too few good actors and tech
nicians. But in almost any play which the Divi
sion chooses to produce, some of the cast will
be out of its class. Yet these, as well as the
rest, must be given opportunity to receive a
dramatic education.
During the last six months, however, the Di
vision has had ample opportunity to test the
quality of its material. In "Murder in the
Cathedral" it has glimpsed its upper artistic
limit. In "Governor's Wife" it has seen the
results of inadequate production.
Audiences should expect good work from
the Division; they are getting it in "Winter's
Tale."
But having found a measuring stick, future
Division flops cannot be called experimenta
tion. Thoy will merely show that the Division
has bitten off more than it can chew.—J. S.
