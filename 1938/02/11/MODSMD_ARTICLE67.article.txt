# Sunday Night Futility
## 
### 
FROM now on, sociology professors who
want a sparkling example to prove the fu
tility of our civilization won't have to go back
to the ancient history of Bechuanaland. RKO's
cancellation of our Sunday night movies pro
vides a beautiful illustration.
Begun last guarter with the double purpose
of providing entertainment and keeping the
students off the streets, the movie series was
shaping into form as one of Stanford's better
traditions. The time was convenient; the films
were well-chosen; and the 15-cent ante com
pared well with the cost of an expedition down
the highway for milkshakes.
But now the jealous gods have struck, and
RKO refuses us the three pictures it contracted
to deliver, saying in explanation that it "mis
understood" the nature of our movies. It thought
the audience was much smaller, "one of the
fraternities." And it felt that 15 cents admis
sion was not enough to permit fair competi
tion with the Palo Alto temples to the goddess
of celluloid.
As a result, Stanford has the choice between
a discussion group and a poker game for Sun
day night entertainment. And this should pro
vide a very neat illustration for any professor
who wants to prove that the machinery of so
ciety is below Model T efficiency.
If the movie series had fallen as flat as a
guestionable joke at a faculty tea, RKO would
have had no objections. It would have cashed
our chccks with guiet efficiency and meditated
upon the wisdom of P. T. Barnum. But when
the audience began to grow like the registra
tion for a new pipe course, the movie moguls
called offside.
We can't have the movies because they are
successful and can charge low rates. If we
could raise the price to 50 cents and persuade
people to stay away, we could continue with
the series. It's all perfectly logical and fair.
And it keeps us from feeling sorry for our be
nighted ancestors who didn't have movies
either.â€”J. C.
