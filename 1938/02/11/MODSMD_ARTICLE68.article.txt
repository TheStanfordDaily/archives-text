# Drip, Drip, Drip . . .

AS ONE of the Greek philosophers remarked,
back in the days before Greece went off
the Golden Age standard, women and weather
are not a good bet for any man's toga. Today
the Acropolis is no longer a hill, but a restau
rant; and Venus is a pencil, not a goddess.
But the words of the sage still hold. You can't
bet on the weather.

Even so, Stanford is going to find itself go
ing down for the third time if the rain which
has dripped down our necks for the past two
weeks doesn't stop. We have it on reliable
authority that despite the Roosevelt ship-build
ing program there are no arks ready, and none
under construction. But the rain goes on, and
Stanford approaches flood conditions with a
speed that even a younger generation going to
the dogs can't equal.
Already the Row has become a river, which,
like Alf of Xanadu, flows down to the sunless
sea that is the Quad. Between the Deke house
and the K.A. manse there is an arm of the sea
which has never been sounded. And in front
of the Theta Delt house there is an ocean which
deserves a fleet.
And still the rain continues. The Lagunita
lifeguards are considering moving their stand
to the Inner Quad expecting to get more busi
ness; and a group of short-legged students are
petitioning the comptroller to buy out the
Golden Gate ferries and bring them down here.
The outlook is a bit depressing; and we can
understand how the men who missed Noah's
boat felt when the tide came in. But there is
one faint chance which we can try before we
start a drive to raise money for the Stanford
floor relief fund. The Hopi Indians give snake
dances to bring rain. The thing for us to do
is to give Buck of the Month Club scholarships
to a dozen or so Indians. Perhaps we could
learn the dance from them, give it in reverse,
and dry things up. It's cheaper than buying
water-wings.â€”J. C.
