INSIDE AMERICA
and devastating, the March of Time's
"Inside Nazi Germany" arrives at the Stanford, a
rational film which shows both sides of everything
and in its quietly damning way leaves Herr Hitler not
a leg to stand on; and would-be Fascists go to ap
plaud, and would-be Communists go to hiss, and the
rest of us, somewhere in the middle, go to congratu
late ourselves on the fact that to date it hasn t hap
pened here.
And yet the Saturday Evening Post has just this
week described the aftermath of a time when it did.
That was the time when the Senator from Louisiana
beat the Government with a one-man filibuster; when
Every Man a King" was something more than a
pleasantly undemocratic vision; when speech, press,
and assembly in Louisiana lay crushed under restric
tions as severe as any abroad; when a stocky man with
the physiognomy of a sardonic pig opened all his radio
addresses with the statement, "Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, this is Huey P. Long talkin', I know
your friends will want to hear what I have to say to
night so if you will just go and telephone your friends
and tell 'em Huey P. Long is on the radio . . ."

'"pHAT was the time when a Federal Government,
seeking some legal way of hamstringing the King
fish, tried in vain to get him on income tax evasion,
stopping of Federal relief funds, anything. That was
the time when a man who had destroyed democracy
in one state of the Union was threatening it seriously
in the other 47; and when political assassination be
came the only way out.
The Senator from Louisiana is dead now, his grave
a shrine, his legend a living force in the state which
he dominated. It will probably never again spread
beyond its borders to endanger the nation's peace of
mind.
But Huey Long dead is not tyranny dead; and smug
rationalizations do not make any less dangerous the
lunatic streak in America which threw Huey to the
top. There are always those who want power and
are strong enough to get it, and the lesson of his death
will be too soon forgotten to have any effect upon
them.
When we see "Inside Nazi Germany," we might re
member that this country whose agony it so blandly
describes was yesterday a country like our own: and
that complacent America again may be whistling past
the graveyard, not remembering that it has happened
here once.—Allen Drury.

'"pHAT was the time when a Federal Government,
seeking some legal way of hamstringing the King
fish, tried in vain to get him on income tax evasion,
stopping of Federal relief funds, anything. That was
the time when a man who had destroyed democracy
in one state of the Union was threatening it seriously
in the other 47; and when political assassination be
came the only way out.
The Senator from Louisiana is dead now, his grave
a shrine, his legend a living force in the state which
he dominated. It will probably never again spread
beyond its borders to endanger the nation's peace of
mind.
But Huey Long dead is not tyranny dead; and smug
rationalizations do not make any less dangerous the
lunatic streak in America which threw Huey to the
top. There are always those who want power and
are strong enough to get it, and the lesson of his death
will be too soon forgotten to have any effect upon
them.
When we see "Inside Nazi Germany," we might re
member that this country whose agony it so blandly
describes was yesterday a country like our own: and
that complacent America again may be whistling past
the graveyard, not remembering that it has happened
here once.—Allen Drury.
INSIDE AMERICA
and devastating, the March of Time's
"Inside Nazi Germany" arrives at the Stanford, a
rational film which shows both sides of everything
and in its quietly damning way leaves Herr Hitler not
a leg to stand on; and would-be Fascists go to ap
plaud, and would-be Communists go to hiss, and the
rest of us, somewhere in the middle, go to congratu
late ourselves on the fact that to date it hasn t hap
pened here.
And yet the Saturday Evening Post has just this
week described the aftermath of a time when it did.
That was the time when the Senator from Louisiana
beat the Government with a one-man filibuster; when
Every Man a King" was something more than a
pleasantly undemocratic vision; when speech, press,
and assembly in Louisiana lay crushed under restric
tions as severe as any abroad; when a stocky man with
the physiognomy of a sardonic pig opened all his radio
addresses with the statement, "Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen, this is Huey P. Long talkin', I know
your friends will want to hear what I have to say to
night so if you will just go and telephone your friends
and tell 'em Huey P. Long is on the radio . . ."
