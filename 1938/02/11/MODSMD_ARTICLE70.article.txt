r |' , HIS is hurricane season. And not. to skip from one
season to another, while Ex Com is considering
curbing drives, they had better leave a clause in the
amendment providing for a Stanford Flood Relief
Campaign.
But it's the day of the big Hollywood wind. We
are already tidying up our storm cellar, laying in a
stock of preservatives in preparation for the mam
moth "Goldwyn Follies" which is being wound up for
a blasting release.
From the pictures in "Life,"'it will be the super
colossal to end super-colossals. The star, Zorina,
however, must not be confused with Zorita, who danced
to "Come Join the Band" at the carnival in Menlo
Park last year.
Some day, Hollywood is going to build a set which
will rival Genesis, and the day is not far off, judging
from the current trend.

IT MAY all be traced back to the old-time "horse
I operas"—Westerns. Photographers got into the
j habit of adjusting their lenses to the inevitable shot
of the heroine, standing silouetted against a setting sun
on the top of a cliff, her horse munching grass at the
foot of a hoary redwood, and the valley stretching
endlessly below. The cameramen were forced to check
their impulses to photograph on a grand scale when
the Western went out with the "continued next week"
stage of movies.
But the malady lingered on. and sprang full-blown
into existence with the rash of back-stage musical pro
ductions. Then they really had a time for themselves.
Angle shots of legs, whirling ballrooms which left the
audience with a permanent case of vertigo, heads re
ceding from the returning to the foreground until
; they filled the screen completely, giving one a nice
insight into the pore system of a chorus girl.
We suppose it all belongs to the American "biggest
in the world complex. You can't get away from it.
But we are delivering an ultimatum: "The ele
i phant style of motion picture production must stop."
Yes. you, Mr. M.O.M Si.-nr.
