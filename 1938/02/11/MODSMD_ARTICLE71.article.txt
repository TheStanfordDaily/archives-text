# Time Marches As Mae West Also Runs
## 
### 
Best tiling about the Mae West ;
bill at the Stanford tonight is the
March of Time review of Nazi Ger
many. Not that Miss West is not her
usual parabola self—far from it in
deed, but fans who race lo the show i
with the good old Puritanical j
naughty-naughty scene of antici- j
pation will be slightly disappointed. !
Story of "Everyday's a Holiday"
revolves around the clever Mae as j
a light-fingered New York gal and j
Edmund Lowe, the equally clever i
and overly-honest New York cop. j
Both, according to the best of Hoi- :
lywood scripts, are in love with j
each other; but duty always has
the unfortunate habit of keeping j
them apart until the end.
Through a series of far too com
plicated moves, "Honest John" j
Quade, the villain and crooked poli- !
tician, is out-witted, beaten in the
election when he flies Lowe from
the force, smacked in the face at his ;
opponent's political rally. All, of
course, in the best of 1890 style,
which by this time has gotten a
little stale.
Dialogue Good
Dialogue between West and But
terworth and West and Winninger
at times approaches the humorous,
but is nowhere near the too fa
mous Ameche-West Garden of Eden
scene.
In the March of Time review, de
spite the editor's comment to the
contrary, propaganda tells its pow
erful story, neatly slaps Der Fuh
rer's face.
Almost a perfect parallel of Sin
clair Lewis' book. "It Can't Happen
Here," this pictorial study shows
only too well the effects of mass
hysteria on an economically and
socially broken nation. Here is a
brilliant study, although a depress
ing one, done by master interpret
ers.
Shots Revealing
Best shots: a Nazi officer collect
ing money saved by family starva
tion one day each week; a series
depicting military training from the
time children are old enough to go
to kindergarten to the time they're
trained to die for the Vaterland.
Of many of the March of Time
reels, this one surpasses any others
released to date, principally be
cause it. deals with one subject, docs
it completely and thoroughly.
"City Girl," with Phyllis Brooks
and Ricardo Cortez, lasts 90 min
utes.

election when he flies Lowe from
the force, smacked in the face at his ;
opponent's political rally. All, of
course, in the best of 1890 style,
which by this time has gotten a
little stale.
Dialogue Good
Dialogue between West and But
terworth and West and Winninger
at times approaches the humorous,
but is nowhere near the too fa
mous Ameche-West Garden of Eden
scene.
In the March of Time review, de
spite the editor's comment to the
contrary, propaganda tells its pow
erful story, neatly slaps Der Fuh
rer's face.
Almost a perfect parallel of Sin
clair Lewis' book. "It Can't Happen
Here," this pictorial study shows
only too well the effects of mass
hysteria on an economically and
socially broken nation. Here is a
brilliant study, although a depress
ing one, done by master interpret
ers.
Shots Revealing
Best shots: a Nazi officer collect
ing money saved by family starva
tion one day each week; a series
depicting military training from the
time children are old enough to go
to kindergarten to the time they're
trained to die for the Vaterland.
Of many of the March of Time
reels, this one surpasses any others
released to date, principally be
cause it. deals with one subject, docs
it completely and thoroughly.
"City Girl," with Phyllis Brooks
and Ricardo Cortez, lasts 90 min
utes.

Best tiling about the Mae West ;
bill at the Stanford tonight is the
March of Time review of Nazi Ger
many. Not that Miss West is not her
usual parabola self—far from it in
deed, but fans who race lo the show i
with the good old Puritanical j
naughty-naughty scene of antici- j
pation will be slightly disappointed. !
Story of "Everyday's a Holiday"
revolves around the clever Mae as j
a light-fingered New York gal and j
Edmund Lowe, the equally clever i
and overly-honest New York cop. j
Both, according to the best of Hoi- :
lywood scripts, are in love with j
each other; but duty always has
the unfortunate habit of keeping j
them apart until the end.
Through a series of far too com
plicated moves, "Honest John" j
Quade, the villain and crooked poli- !
tician, is out-witted, beaten in the
election when he flies Lowe from
the force, smacked in the face at his ;
opponent's political rally. All, of
course, in the best of 1890 style,
which by this time has gotten a
little stale.
