Candid camera shots of "Stanford
at a Ski Party" will be especially
welcome at the Quad office, George
McKenna announced yesterday.
"There is still plenty of time to
get in some pictures of skiing, snow
fights, and other winter sport," Mc-
Kenna said.
Any other pictures of Stanford
students taken on the campus, or in
some activity will be also welcom
ed. McKenna stressed the import
ance of having the pictures handed
into the Quad office as soon as they
are developed.
