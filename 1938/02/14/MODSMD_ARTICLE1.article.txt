Victim of a heart attack, Dr. Hen
ry Rushton Fairclough, 75, emeritus
professor of classical literature and
one of America's outstanding schol
ars, died at his Palo Aito home Sat
urday afternoon.
At Stanford since his appointment
by President David Starr Jordan in

and an LL.D. from Toronto in 1922.
Long-time friends and Univer
sity administrators joined last night
in paying tribute to him as a scholar,
worker, writer, and comrade.
'Distinguished Scholar'
"For more than four decades, he
was one of the distinguished repre
sentatives of Stanford University in
the world of scholars," said Dr.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, acting
president of the University.
'"He rendered outstanding service
in Europe during the Great War.
Since his retirement from active
teaching 10 years ago, he has given
his service in many public enter
prises. We shall miss his gracious
and helpful presence."
"The loss of Dr. Fairclough will
be keenly felt, not only at Stanford,
but wherever classic scholarship is
found," said Professor Raymond
Davis Harriman, head of the De
partment of Classics. "Retirement
from active teaching did not mean
for him retirement from interest
nor cessation from activity in his
chosen work.
"Another of Stanford's fine schol
ars has become one of its great
memories."
Dr. Augustus T. Murray, emeritus
professor of classical literature, who
was a classmate at Johns Hopkins
and was closely associated with him
until their retirement, described Dr.
Fairclough as "one of the outstand
ing scholars of our group, a hard
worker, setting high standards for
himself and others."
Dr. Murray added that Dr. Fair
clough was "a man of large influ
ence in our community because of
his high standards. He was promi
nent in church work and in the dio
cese of California, because of his
standards and earnestness of pur
pose."
Dr. Fairclough was internationally
known for his studies in archaeol
ogy and was an authority on class
ical archaeology. He traveled wide
ly in connection with these studies.
Authority on Virgil
He was considered by authorities
as "unquestionably" America's out
standing Virgil scholar of modern
times and was one of the relatively
few Latinists who were also compe
tent in Greek literature. He was
the author of many books dealing
with classical studies.
During the War, he served with
the American Red Cross in Monte
negro, Serbia, and Belgium and was
honored with decorations by those
countries.
He was a member of Alpha Delta
Phi and, before his retirement, was
frequently at the house here.
Dr. Fairclough married Fredericka
Allen of Ontario in 1888. She died
in 1927 and in September, 1930, he
married Mary Charlotte Holly in
Paris. Besides his widow, he leaves
a daughter, Mrs. Rufus Kimball.
Funeral services will be held in
All Saints Church iti Palo Alto at
11 o'clock tomorrow, with interment
in Cypress Lawn. Bishop Edward L.
Parsons is expected to officiate, with
Rev. Oscar Green of All Saint and
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, University
chaplain, assisting.

At Stanford since his appointment
by President David Starr Jordan in
1893, Dr. Fairclough retired 10 years
ago. He was graduated from John
Hopkins University half a century
ago, and later went to the Univer
sity of Toronto. He received his
Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1896,
and an LL.D. from Toronto in 1922.
Long-time friends and Univer
sity administrators joined last night
in paying tribute to him as a scholar,
worker, writer, and comrade.
'Distinguished Scholar'
"For more than four decades, he
was one of the distinguished repre
sentatives of Stanford University in
the world of scholars," said Dr.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, acting
president of the University.
'"He rendered outstanding service
in Europe during the Great War.
Since his retirement from active
teaching 10 years ago, he has given
his service in many public enter
prises. We shall miss his gracious
and helpful presence."
"The loss of Dr. Fairclough will
be keenly felt, not only at Stanford,
but wherever classic scholarship is
found," said Professor Raymond
Davis Harriman, head of the De
partment of Classics. "Retirement
from active teaching did not mean
for him retirement from interest
nor cessation from activity in his
chosen work.
"Another of Stanford's fine schol
ars has become one of its great
memories."
Dr. Augustus T. Murray, emeritus
professor of classical literature, who
was a classmate at Johns Hopkins
and was closely associated with him
until their retirement, described Dr.
Fairclough as "one of the outstand
ing scholars of our group, a hard
worker, setting high standards for
himself and others."
Dr. Murray added that Dr. Fair
clough was "a man of large influ
ence in our community because of
his high standards. He was promi
nent in church work and in the dio
cese of California, because of his
standards and earnestness of pur
pose."
Dr. Fairclough was internationally
known for his studies in archaeol
ogy and was an authority on class
ical archaeology. He traveled wide
ly in connection with these studies.
Authority on Virgil
He was considered by authorities
as "unquestionably" America's out
standing Virgil scholar of modern
times and was one of the relatively
few Latinists who were also compe
tent in Greek literature. He was
the author of many books dealing
with classical studies.
During the War, he served with
the American Red Cross in Monte
negro, Serbia, and Belgium and was
honored with decorations by those
countries.
He was a member of Alpha Delta
Phi and, before his retirement, was
frequently at the house here.
Dr. Fairclough married Fredericka
Allen of Ontario in 1888. She died
in 1927 and in September, 1930, he
married Mary Charlotte Holly in
Paris. Besides his widow, he leaves
a daughter, Mrs. Rufus Kimball.
Funeral services will be held in
