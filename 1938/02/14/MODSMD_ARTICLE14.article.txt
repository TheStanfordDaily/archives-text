# Stefansson Lauds Polar Air Route
## 
### 
"Why would anyone want to fly
across the Arctic?" asked Vilhjal
mur Stefansson, famed explorer and
scientist, at the all-University As
sembly last Friday in his speech on
"Transpolar Commerce by Air."
"Obviously," he answered his
question. " to get on the other side."
Mr. Stefansson then went on to tell
why anyone would want to get on
the other side.
"We are living in a northern civi
lization," he said, "Nearly all the j
great cities and countries are in the j
north temperate zone. Therefore I
the power and culture of the world
is crammed up at the top of the
world like a tremendous doughnut.
At the very center of the doughnut
is a hole, the Arctic."
Air Travel Over Pole
Mr. Stefansson then discussed air
travel over this world's "doughnut." i
"We all know the earth is round," I
| declared the explorer, "yet nearly
! everybody, including a University '
audience, thinks of the earth as I
flat."
"Ask anybody the shortest way to |

Paris from San Francisco and he
will invariably say, 'Fly across the
country to New York and from there
over the Atlantic'," said Mr. Stef
ansson. "But instead of going a
little north of east," asserted the
Canadian - born Norseman, "the
short route is a little east of north."
"When Lindbergh flew from New
York to Japan an editorial appeared
in an esteemed New York news
paper wondering why 'the Lone
Eagle picked the long route by fly
ing north instead of west' " said Mr.
Stefansson. "In reality Lindbergh
saved 6000 miles by going the way
he did."
Most People Wrong
"Most people are wrong again in
thinking that flying conditions in
the far north are terrible," said Mr.
Stefansson.
"Primarily," he declared, "they
believe it's so awfully cold."
Mr. Stefansson was employed 31
years ago by the Canadian Govern
ment to establish a chain of weather
stations in the Arctic Circle. Dur
ing those 31 years no temperature

has ever been recorded below 52
degrees below zero, he said.
'This may seem cold but right in
the United States it gets much colder
every year. The coldest known spot
on earth is in the Soviet Union,
where it gets down to 95 degrees
below zero, and the U.S.S.R. oper
ates its greatest aviation center with
complete success."
While Mr. Stefansson firmly be
lieves transpolar air travel physi
cally practical, he does not think it
will be put into actual practice for
many years.
'War-Mad World'
"This is a war-mad world," the
lecturer declared, "and it is neces
sary to have the accord and coopera
tion of two nations before any air
line can be instituted over them."
"Right now the world's "dough
nut hole" is surrounded by the capi
talistic United States, Communistic
Russia, Fascist Japan, and the So
cialistic Scandinavian countries,"
Mr. Stefansson declared, adding.
"The world is facing a northern
frontier."

question. " to get on the other side."
Mr. Stefansson then went on to tell
why anyone would want to get on
the other side.
"We are living in a northern civi
lization," he said, "Nearly all the j
great cities and countries are in the j
north temperate zone. Therefore I
the power and culture of the world
is crammed up at the top of the
world like a tremendous doughnut.
At the very center of the doughnut
is a hole, the Arctic."
Air Travel Over Pole
Mr. Stefansson then discussed air
travel over this world's "doughnut." i
"We all know the earth is round," I
| declared the explorer, "yet nearly
! everybody, including a University '
audience, thinks of the earth as I
flat."
"Ask anybody the shortest way to |

Paris from San Francisco and he
will invariably say, 'Fly across the
country to New York and from there
over the Atlantic'," said Mr. Stef
ansson. "But instead of going a
little north of east," asserted the
Canadian - born Norseman, "the
short route is a little east of north."
"When Lindbergh flew from New
York to Japan an editorial appeared
in an esteemed New York news
paper wondering why 'the Lone
Eagle picked the long route by fly
ing north instead of west' " said Mr.
Stefansson. "In reality Lindbergh
saved 6000 miles by going the way
he did."
Most People Wrong
"Most people are wrong again in
thinking that flying conditions in
the far north are terrible," said Mr.
Stefansson.
"Primarily," he declared, "they
believe it's so awfully cold."
Mr. Stefansson was employed 31
years ago by the Canadian Govern
ment to establish a chain of weather
stations in the Arctic Circle. Dur
ing those 31 years no temperature

has ever been recorded below 52
degrees below zero, he said.
'This may seem cold but right in
the United States it gets much colder
every year. The coldest known spot
on earth is in the Soviet Union,
where it gets down to 95 degrees
below zero, and the U.S.S.R. oper
ates its greatest aviation center with
complete success."
While Mr. Stefansson firmly be
lieves transpolar air travel physi
cally practical, he does not think it
will be put into actual practice for
many years.
'War-Mad World'
"This is a war-mad world," the
lecturer declared, "and it is neces
sary to have the accord and coopera
tion of two nations before any air
line can be instituted over them."
"Right now the world's "dough
nut hole" is surrounded by the capi
talistic United States, Communistic
Russia, Fascist Japan, and the So
cialistic Scandinavian countries,"
Mr. Stefansson declared, adding.
"The world is facing a northern
frontier."
"Why would anyone want to fly
across the Arctic?" asked Vilhjal
mur Stefansson, famed explorer and
scientist, at the all-University As
sembly last Friday in his speech on
"Transpolar Commerce by Air."
"Obviously," he answered his
question. " to get on the other side."
