# 'Blue Jeans' Ticket Sale Opens Today
## Last-Minute Change In Cast Announced; Melton Wins Hole 
### 
Tickets for the "Blue Jeans" pro
duction to be given next Saturday
night in Memorial Hall, will go on
sale today from 9 until 3 o'clock at
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Union.
The prices are 50 cents, 75 cents, and
$1, and all seats are reserved.
A last minute change in the cast
has been necessitated by the illness
of Pauline Stevens who will be re
placed by Jeanne Melton in the role
of Mary Kirk, mother of the naive
hero, Jonathan.
Jonathan, whom author Martin
Flavin means to be interpreted as
any high-minded college student
will be portrayed by Jack Dawson,
prominent member of Stagers.
Difficult Role
According to Mr. Flavin, there are
few young men now on the stage
who are ideal for the role of Jona
than. They nearly all lack the right
air, the ability, and the reputation.
'Burgess Meredith could do it,"
he remarked, "but. he's in Holly
wood." Charles Bulottas and Nelson
Wheeler as stooges in the roles of
Nick Grundy, the sheriff, and his as
sistant, Oscar Butts, help Jonathan
carry the comedy load. They sup
ply not only humor, but satire, as
they play "yes men" to the big poli
tical boss, John Kirk.
The police force is described hu
morously, but graphically, as two
officers humbly apologize for ar
resting a "friend of the Patrty" and
then go back to chasing "Reds,"
though they have no idea of what a
"Red" is except that he is supposed
to carry "subversive reading mat
ter" which they decide is "anything
they can't understand."
Deals With Strike
Mr. Flavin, who is now giving a
playwright course at Stanford, has
been a resident of Carmel for 18
years. He wrote his play shortly
before the neighboring Salinas let
tuce strike, laying the setting in lo
cal territory. Jonathan is supposed
to be a University of California stu
dent whose home is in Salinas.
The play deals with the attempt
of a young college student to reform
the world according to the axioms
learned from his university profes
sors, according to the author. "It
was not written in mockery of stand
ing institutions of government, but
in sympathy for the idealism of
youth," he said.
