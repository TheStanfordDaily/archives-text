# Cards Beat Troy In Hough Games
## Laughing Boys Pass Division Hump; 'Football Tactics' Used In Tilts 
### 
Easing over the biggest hump in the 1938 southern division race, the
Stanford haskethallers' two wins. 36-30 and IS-.'}.), over Southern California
this week-end finished the series, the Cards winning, three to one. Tlie
Laughing Boys took some mighty close guarding in the first game. As a
result the number of shots taken was very low. hut the percentage made

♦was mgn. Captain Hank Luisetti,
for instance, took only one shot from
the floor in the second half, not
counting tip-in attempts.
At the same time, the Trojans
flipped the ball toward the basket
every time they had a split-second
chance, but their accuracy was none
too sharp.
Stoefen, "hot as a fox," connected
for 15 points, while Hank, kept busy
by Troy's Hal Dornsife, and still
busier keeping the ball moving,
marked ,up a mere 7.
All Time Hitting
Saturday night found the Indian
five hitting consistently, and were
never behind in the count, except
for a wee bit at the start.
Hankus-Pankus slapped the net
ting for 21 points, while the previous
night's leader, Stoefen, wasn't far
behind with 14.
Four players — three Trojans and
one Card—were whistled out of the
game lor knocking people down or
hacking or something four times
each. The referees' looters were go
ing lull blast all evening, inciden
tally, with 31 fouls being called on
the boys.
Football Tactics
U.S.C. could get under the basket
very seldom, while the Laughing
j Boys had the game pretty much as
they liked it. Except, perhaps, they
i didn't enjoy the physical beating
they took, football tactics being as
; much in order as were hoop meth
! ods, it seems.
Play over the week-lHid left the
southern division with no change in
standings. California defeated U.C.
L A. twice, boring spectators half to
death in the process. In the north
ern division, Idaho slapped down
Oregon in both games. In doing so,
they knocked Oregon out of first
place and into a tie for second with
Idaho. Washington automatically
took over the top spot.
Stanford's two wins makes the
Cal-Stanford game this coming Fri
day the one that will decide whether
or not the Bears stay in the lead.
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. are now com
pletely out of the picture.
