# cooking at Stanford Through the Eyes of Foreign Students
## Visitors Find Farm Cold; International Group Formed 
### 
When Margaret Wolverton, '.'{s, returned from a year at Lingnan Uni
versity as exchange scholar, she brought with her an international con
sciousness which resulted in the foundation of the A.S.S.I'. Committee on
International Relations early last year.
Problems arising from the presence of foreign students at Stanford—

(j1 at present —are mostly those ol
housing and of social absorption by
the campus. With no campus hous
ing facilities available, foreign men
and women must live in Palo Alto,
obtain contact wth the university
only through attendance at classes.
Because of this isolation, and be
cause of language handicaps, such
students are given little opportunity
lo become acquainted with Ameri
cans and with American social life.
Committee Formed
To meet some of these difficulties
of adaptation, Margaret Wolverton
and Betty McClintock. both seniors,
presented plans for the international
group to Ex Committee, were given
sanction and a budget of $50 to carry
on their activities. Under the two
leaders a committee of five spon
sored informal picnics and Sunday
night parties at the homes of faculty
members to which foreign and
American students were invited.
New life was injected ,into the
committee this year when Mel Ja
coby, senior and exchange student
at Lingnan last year, took over ad
ministrative re: ■. Although work
ing under the financial limit of $50
for a year's work, the committee has
continued with bi-quarterly par
ties for foreign students. One of
next quarter's parties will be held
at Berkeley under auspices of Cali
fornia's International House.
Interest Grows
But chief work of the committee
this year has been on the basic
problem facing foreign students —
how to combat their isolation from
living off-campus. Interest aroused
by the work of the group is amply
demonstrated by the increase in
committee members.
Starting with five active members
at the beginning of the year, from
15 to 20 now take part in weekly
meetings at the Alpha Phi house.
General campus interest in the com
mittee was shown when four Ameri
can studuuts approached Jacoby
with requeSs to live in the proposed
International House.
Co-officers with Chairman Ja
coby include Will Lee and Joan
Williamson, secretaries; Bud Hart
zell, treasurer. Regular committee
members are Bob Livingston, Buddy
Iwata, Virginia Thompson, Helen
Oilman, Jean Minetti, Francisco
Davilla, Betty Moscr, and Betty
Lyman.

When Margaret Wolverton, '.'{s, returned from a year at Lingnan Uni
versity as exchange scholar, she brought with her an international con
sciousness which resulted in the foundation of the A.S.S.I'. Committee on
International Relations early last year.
Problems arising from the presence of foreign students at Stanford—

(j1 at present —are mostly those ol
housing and of social absorption by
the campus. With no campus hous
ing facilities available, foreign men
and women must live in Palo Alto,
obtain contact wth the university
only through attendance at classes.
Because of this isolation, and be
cause of language handicaps, such
students are given little opportunity
lo become acquainted with Ameri
cans and with American social life.
Committee Formed
To meet some of these difficulties
of adaptation, Margaret Wolverton
and Betty McClintock. both seniors,
presented plans for the international
group to Ex Committee, were given
sanction and a budget of $50 to carry
on their activities. Under the two
leaders a committee of five spon
sored informal picnics and Sunday
night parties at the homes of faculty
members to which foreign and
American students were invited.
New life was injected ,into the
committee this year when Mel Ja
coby, senior and exchange student
at Lingnan last year, took over ad
ministrative re: ■. Although work
ing under the financial limit of $50
for a year's work, the committee has
continued with bi-quarterly par
ties for foreign students. One of
next quarter's parties will be held
at Berkeley under auspices of Cali
fornia's International House.
Interest Grows
But chief work of the committee
this year has been on the basic
problem facing foreign students —
how to combat their isolation from
living off-campus. Interest aroused
by the work of the group is amply
demonstrated by the increase in
committee members.
Starting with five active members
at the beginning of the year, from
15 to 20 now take part in weekly
meetings at the Alpha Phi house.
General campus interest in the com
mittee was shown when four Ameri
can studuuts approached Jacoby
with requeSs to live in the proposed
International House.
Co-officers with Chairman Ja
coby include Will Lee and Joan
Williamson, secretaries; Bud Hart
zell, treasurer. Regular committee
members are Bob Livingston, Buddy
Iwata, Virginia Thompson, Helen
Oilman, Jean Minetti, Francisco
Davilla, Betty Moscr, and Betty
Lyman.
