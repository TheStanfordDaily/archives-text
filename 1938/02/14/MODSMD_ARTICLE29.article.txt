# Encina Is Latest Plan
## 
### 
Because,, the committee believes,
absorption of foreign students
lunges on their living on campus,
this year's work has been directed
mainly toward starting a new
dormitory, or taking over whole or
part of an old one.
According to the latest proposal
foreigners will room on the top
iloor of Encina Hall next year, if
approval of the plan is granted by
University authorities. The idea is
to give students from other coun
tries preference on fifth floor rooms,
thus concentrating foreign visitors
in a place where they can enter into
campus life and come into contact
vvith representative Americans.
Foreign Problem
The new proposal is the latest at
tempt to solve the problem of pro

viding for students who come here
from foreign countries. The great
majority have been forced to live
ofT campus, and have seen nothing
of the University except from be
hind a text-book. I
Feeling that this existence re
sembled that of a fugitive from a
chain gang rather than of a student,
the committee has worked for over
a year to set up machinery to assist
foreign students in entering the
University community. It started
with a dream of an international
house on the campus, where foreign
students would live with a selected
group of Americans. But the house
proved to be an air-castle. The Uni
versity is already piessed for hous
ing facilities and can spare neither
dormitory nor cottage.
Graduate Dorm
With this dream shelved, the com
mittee started on a new
vestigated the possibility of lodging
foreigners in the proposed gradu
ate dormitory. It was also suggest
ed that arrangements be made with
some couple living on the campus
for foreign students to room with
them. But no adequate housing
facilities could be found.
The committee also considered the
idea of locating foreign students on
the top floor of Sequoia. But Se- [
quoia is not noted for its genteel at- ,
mosphere, and it was feared that the j
strangers might exchange the hell ;
of loneliness for a considerably 1
more realistic hell. Sequoia has'
many virtues, but it is not just the!
place to adjust strangers.
Encina Rooms
And so the committee concluded
that the top floor of Encina would
be the best arrangement. Prelimi
nary talks with University authori
ties indicate that the proposal will
be accepted. Not more than 20
rooms would be taken by foreign !
students, so that there would be no i
considerable upset in campus hous- j
ing arrangements.
The committee also is planning
several projects to smooth the path
of the incoming foreigner. It in- ;
tends to get a list of prospective
students in other countries from '
the Registrar. It then will send ,
them information about the Uni- j
versity and suggestions for fitting j
into the Stanford community. It ,
hopes that this will eliminate much '
of the confusion and uncertainty '
that is found in many of the new j
students.
It also plans to have half a dozen ;
Stanford juniors and seniors in the
Ad Building lobby on registration
day to assist foreigners in entering
the University and in getting set- I
tied.

the committee has worked for over
a year to set up machinery to assist
foreign students in entering the
University community. It started
with a dream of an international
house on the campus, where foreign
students would live with a selected
group of Americans. But the house
proved to be an air-castle. The Uni
versity is already piessed for hous
ing facilities and can spare neither
dormitory nor cottage.
Graduate Dorm
With this dream shelved, the com
mittee started on a new
vestigated the possibility of lodging
foreigners in the proposed gradu
ate dormitory. It was also suggest
ed that arrangements be made with
some couple living on the campus
for foreign students to room with
them. But no adequate housing
facilities could be found.
The committee also considered the
idea of locating foreign students on
the top floor of Sequoia. But Se- [
quoia is not noted for its genteel at- ,
mosphere, and it was feared that the j
strangers might exchange the hell ;
of loneliness for a considerably 1
more realistic hell. Sequoia has'
many virtues, but it is not just the!
place to adjust strangers.
Encina Rooms
And so the committee concluded
that the top floor of Encina would
be the best arrangement. Prelimi
nary talks with University authori
ties indicate that the proposal will
be accepted. Not more than 20
rooms would be taken by foreign !
students, so that there would be no i
considerable upset in campus hous- j
ing arrangements.
The committee also is planning
several projects to smooth the path
of the incoming foreigner. It in- ;
tends to get a list of prospective
students in other countries from '
the Registrar. It then will send ,
them information about the Uni- j
versity and suggestions for fitting j
into the Stanford community. It ,
hopes that this will eliminate much '
of the confusion and uncertainty '
that is found in many of the new j
students.
It also plans to have half a dozen ;
Stanford juniors and seniors in the
Ad Building lobby on registration
day to assist foreigners in entering
the University and in getting set- I
tied.
Because,, the committee believes,
absorption of foreign students
lunges on their living on campus,
this year's work has been directed
mainly toward starting a new
dormitory, or taking over whole or
part of an old one.
According to the latest proposal
foreigners will room on the top
iloor of Encina Hall next year, if
approval of the plan is granted by
University authorities. The idea is
to give students from other coun
tries preference on fifth floor rooms,
thus concentrating foreign visitors
in a place where they can enter into
campus life and come into contact
vvith representative Americans.
Foreign Problem
The new proposal is the latest at
tempt to solve the problem of pro

viding for students who come here
from foreign countries. The great
majority have been forced to live
ofT campus, and have seen nothing
of the University except from be
hind a text-book. I
Feeling that this existence re
sembled that of a fugitive from a
chain gang rather than of a student,
