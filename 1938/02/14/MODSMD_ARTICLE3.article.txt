Storm-beaten Northern Califor
nians, wearied by 18 successive
days of torrential rains, windstorms,
and mountain blizzards, can find
little hope in the U. S. Weather Bu
reau's simple forecast for today:
"Rain."
A new storm arrived yesterday
from off the Coast and made more
difficult the job of repairing
flooded homes, maintaining levees
protecting valley farms, and re
opening broken highways and
railroads.
Two large levees on the San Joa
quin and Stanislaus Rivers were
broken by flood waters that rushed
over thousands of acres of agricul
tural land. Seventy-five families
were evacuated.
Watsonville began to return to
normal life as the Pajaro River,
which had flooded half of the busi
ness district, receded. Red Cross
officials have removed isolated Al
viso families to safety.
During the European • week-end,
Adolf Hitler's peace talks in South
Germany with Austrian Chancellor
Kurt Schuschnigg held the center of
attention, but official announcements
saying that it was "a private talk
between two prominent leaders
who wished to exchange views" did
nothing to clarify the mysterious
Berchtesgaden conference.
Unofficially, it was said that
Benito Mussolini played the major
role in bringing Hitler and
Schuschnigg together.
Illustrative of the current Euro
pean jitters is a Rome rumor that
an attempt was made 'to dynamite
a train en route from Germany to
Italy, which required official denials
of reports that new German Foreign
Minister Joachim Von Ribbentrop
was hurrying to confer with II
Duce.
In Washington a similar "unoffi
cial report from a high administra
tion official" was that the United
States will take the lead in the
greatest naval building race in his
tory as result of Japan's refusal to
reveal her own big navy aspira
tions.
Proposed is the invocation of the
"escalator clause" of the London
Treaty, and enactment of the Vin
son bill providing for the construc
tion of three 45,000-ton dread
naughts armed with 18-inch guns.
