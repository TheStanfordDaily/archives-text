# Problem Real, Says Colombian
## 
### 
Proof that the International Com
mittee isn't merely something to
give a group of Farm people an out
let for excess energy lies with the

foreign students.
One of them, Francis Davila from
Columbia, S. A., who has been here
five years and is now in his last
year in the Business School, justi
fied the committee from the foreign
student view-point in an interview
Friday night.
Many Problems
"Our problems here, naturally,
are numerous," Davila said, "but
they can be remedied very easily, I
think. The two most important are
getting our units properly evaluated
when we come here, and our not
knowing anyone here—and having
little chance of ever knowing any
one well."
The first problem, he thinks, could

♦be solved by having men in the Uni
versity who are familiar with the
grade-point systems of countries
which continually send students
here—men who could determine the
positions in school of the foreign
students much faster and more ac
j curately.
Their problem of not having
! friends here, other than other for
eign students, could be solved more
j easily.
Live Off-Campus
The thing that keeps them from
i making friends is that Stanford's
i social life centers entirely around
Stanford, and as things are now, the
foreign students usually live off the
campus and are left out of school
activities.
Davila thinks it is important for
the foreign students to make friends
here, chiefly because many foreign
students never become adjusted
here.
American Psychology
"We want to become adjusted and
we try to," he said, "but to become
adjusted we have to know the
American psychology, and to know
the American psychology we must
have American friends. The way
things are now it is pretty hard to
have those friends."
Also, aside from making them feel
out-of-place and giving them no
personal feeling for the University,
this non-adjustment makes many of
them dangerously introspective.
Praises Committee
Davila praised the committee for
its "far-seeing move." He thinks
making the foreign students more at
home here builds up good-will in
foreign countries both for the Uni
versity and the country.
Aside fjom the International Com
mittee's plan for moving the for
eign students out on the campus
where they can live with the ma
jority of Stanford students, Davila
has another plan to help these stu
dents make friends here: every fra
ternity might make it a policy to
have two foreign students as guests
for dinnef once a month.
