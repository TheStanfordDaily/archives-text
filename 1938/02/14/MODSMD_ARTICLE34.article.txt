# 25 Countries Represented

According to American members'
! of the International Committee, con
tact between foreign and native stu
dents might be just as valuable to !
the natives as to the outlanders.
One, in the story below, compares
such a contact to a trip abroad.
Permanent dream of college stu
dents is to journey to foreign lands, I
to meet people and customs un
familiar except through travel books.
But these are to be met here on the
Stanford campus where there are
over 60 representatives of these
countries.
Not just ordinary students, most
of these men and women are sent
by their governments to study in ;
America, or are sons and daughters
of prominent officials in their father-
I land.
Not Reluctant
Though their presence is almost
! unrecognized by their Amercan
| classmates, it is not through reluct
[ ance on the part of the foreigners
i to meet Americans. Take the case
of Tay Sadullah or Kenan Manio
glue, who were sent here by the
Turkish government on competitive
scholarships. Both bemoan the fact
that they live off-campus and that
there is no way for a foreign student
to enter into campus life.
Sadullah will say quite frankly
that the isolated lot of foreigners is
all wrong and that he woidd never
attempt to persuade his friends at
home to come here.
"At home it's different," he says.
