# Grad House Further Need
## 
### 
Housing foreign students is only
a small part of the larger problem
caused by the lack of a graduate
dormitory on the campus. Foreign
ers are involved in the problem be
cause the majority of them are
graduates. But their need differs in
degree rather than in kind.
Each year over 800 graduates are
alienated from the security of a
campus living group and forced into
an inferior boarding house or a
housekeeping apartment in Palo
Alto, at a time when they must
maintain a more extensive program
of study.
Recognizing this need of a grad
uate dormitory, Dean Mary Yost

| recommended, in a talk at Lunch
; eon CMub last April, the building of
J a new residence between her house
and Zete house, or across the street
from the Women's Clubhouse.
The house itself would be built in
j the form of an H. with graduate
| women living on one side and grad
uate men on the other. The center
wing could be used for dining and
recreation rooms and possibly apart
ments for married couples.
Such a house would include the
foreign students and give them u
chance to mingle with a group of
their own age and possessing simi
lar interests.
At present 83 per cent of the grad
uate men live in Palo Alto, Menlo
Park, or in homes on the campus;
15 per cent live in fifth floor Eneina
rooms, in Sequoia, and a few in
Toyon and Branner.
