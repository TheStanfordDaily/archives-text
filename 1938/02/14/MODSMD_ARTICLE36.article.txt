STANFORD ANI) CAL
FI(iHT FOR THE THRONE
With the first week-end of the
second half of the southern division
hoop play now winging its way into
history, the standings find two
teams eligible for first place, the
other two rather definitely relegated
to third and fourth.
California, with a pair of color
less wins over U.C.L.A., retains the
lead of the loop. Caddy Works'
poor little Bruins made it eight
straight—eight straight losses—in
helping the Bears to pile up seven
victories against one defeat in con
ference play.
Stanford pushed U.S.C. into an
almost certain third place spot with
two victories over the Trojans. That
puts the Cards in second with six
wins and a pair of losses. Troy has
won three, lost five. And before
league play opened that was the team
that Stanford had to beat for the
title.
EVERYTHING IS
JUST ABOUT EVEN
Now, the race has narrowed down
to a natural, a dogfight between Cal
and Stanford for the southern divi
sion championship. California has
the edge of a whole game lead, but
at the same time Stanford has fin
ished the series with U.S.C., and has
yet to play the downtrodden Bruins.
Cal has finished with U.C.L.A. but
must play two games with the not
quite-so-downtrodden Trojans.
The Bears whipped Troy twice at
Berkeley, by the narrowest of mar
gins, but they might not have much
success when they play Sam Barry's
men in Los Angeles. Stanford should
have a leisurely week-end when
U.C.L.A. comes here for two games.
When you get right down and fig
ure it out, you find that the stand
ings are just about as even as can
he, as far as the Indians and the
Bears are concerned.
THE BIG GAMES
SHOULD BE GOOD
Such a state of affairs means that
the next two Big Games, one this
Friday here and the last March 4 at
Berkeley, will be honeys. They will
be for keeps, as we used to say when
we played marbles years ago.
If Stanford wins Friday night—
which is, of course, what is going
to happen—then the loop will be all
tied up. Suppose that Cal trims
U.S.C. twice the next week-end, and
the Indians murder U.C.L.A. twice
at the same time —wow! That will
leave the conference title hanging
on the outcome of the last Stanford-
Cal game.
And if that happens you couldn't
keep me out of Edwards Gym with
anything less than chains.—Peterson.

history, the standings find two
teams eligible for first place, the
other two rather definitely relegated
to third and fourth.
California, with a pair of color
less wins over U.C.L.A., retains the
lead of the loop. Caddy Works'
poor little Bruins made it eight
straight—eight straight losses—in
helping the Bears to pile up seven
victories against one defeat in con
ference play.
Stanford pushed U.S.C. into an
almost certain third place spot with
two victories over the Trojans. That
puts the Cards in second with six
wins and a pair of losses. Troy has
won three, lost five. And before
league play opened that was the team
that Stanford had to beat for the
title.
EVERYTHING IS
JUST ABOUT EVEN
Now, the race has narrowed down
to a natural, a dogfight between Cal
and Stanford for the southern divi
sion championship. California has
the edge of a whole game lead, but
at the same time Stanford has fin
ished the series with U.S.C., and has
yet to play the downtrodden Bruins.
Cal has finished with U.C.L.A. but
must play two games with the not
quite-so-downtrodden Trojans.
The Bears whipped Troy twice at
Berkeley, by the narrowest of mar
gins, but they might not have much
success when they play Sam Barry's
men in Los Angeles. Stanford should
have a leisurely week-end when
U.C.L.A. comes here for two games.
When you get right down and fig
ure it out, you find that the stand
ings are just about as even as can
he, as far as the Indians and the
Bears are concerned.
THE BIG GAMES
SHOULD BE GOOD
Such a state of affairs means that
the next two Big Games, one this
Friday here and the last March 4 at
Berkeley, will be honeys. They will
be for keeps, as we used to say when
we played marbles years ago.
If Stanford wins Friday night—
which is, of course, what is going
to happen—then the loop will be all
tied up. Suppose that Cal trims
U.S.C. twice the next week-end, and
the Indians murder U.C.L.A. twice
at the same time —wow! That will
leave the conference title hanging
on the outcome of the last Stanford-
Cal game.
And if that happens you couldn't
keep me out of Edwards Gym with
anything less than chains.—Peterson.
