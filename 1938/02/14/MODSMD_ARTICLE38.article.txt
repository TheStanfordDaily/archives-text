# Frosh Victorious In Two Tilts
## Highlanders Fall Easily To Papooses Fast Farm Squad To Meet Santa tiara, Bearcubs This Week 
### 
Following last week's two easy
victories, Stanford's frosh basketball
team is settling down to hard prac
tice in preparation for their hardest
week-end of their schedule, come
February 18-19.
Friday night the Papooses will
tangle with the California Bear Cubs
again and Saturday they oppose the
powerful Santa Clara frosh.
After Wednesday's 40-19 rout of
San Francisco Junior College, the
Stanfords came back last Saturday
to smear Piedmont High to the tune
of 41-29. Coach Basil Peterson's
Highlanders were no match for
Papooses and were trailing 25-10 at
the half.
In the second period, Coach Wytze
Gorter started Stanford's reserves,
and things immediately began to
pop. Led by Jack Dana, lanky cen
ter, who was popping baskets from
all corners of the Pavilion, the preps
started to fight back. However, while
they did outplay the frosh reserves,
they at no time came close to eve
ning the score.
Piedmont got off to an early 3-2
lead, but eight straight points by the
frosh put the latter ahead for good.
Mike Marshall started the spree by
sinking his only field goal of the
evening. Don Burness potted a foul
shot and Marshall did likewise, then
Burness handed the frosh a 10-3 ad
vantage with two quick baskets, one
on a nifty back-handed pivot shot.
From that time on. Piedmont was
sunk, although Dana's one-man
fight in the last period gave him 10
points and helped the preps to out
score the Frosh subs, 19-16.
Burness netted high-point hon
ors with 11 points, made in hardly
one half of playing. Marshall
scored six points on one basket and
four foul shots, while Don Williams,
scoring star of the S.F.J.C. game,
did not score a point.
For the reserves, Bill Rumbley,
Bill Masters, and Stan Graff stood
out. Rumbley tanked six points,
while Masters showed that he was
fully recovered from a bad attack
of fiu by playing an excellent game
at forward, scoring four points.
Graff was all over the court in his
short span of action.
For Piedmont, Dana's 10 points,
all in the second half, gave him
scoring honors, closely followed by
Frank McCann and Oilie Hamlin, a
couple of dead-eye forwards, with
seven each.

ning the score.
Piedmont got off to an early 3-2
lead, but eight straight points by the
frosh put the latter ahead for good.
Mike Marshall started the spree by
sinking his only field goal of the
evening. Don Burness potted a foul
shot and Marshall did likewise, then
Burness handed the frosh a 10-3 ad
vantage with two quick baskets, one
on a nifty back-handed pivot shot.
From that time on. Piedmont was
sunk, although Dana's one-man
fight in the last period gave him 10
points and helped the preps to out
score the Frosh subs, 19-16.
Burness netted high-point hon
ors with 11 points, made in hardly
one half of playing. Marshall
scored six points on one basket and
four foul shots, while Don Williams,
scoring star of the S.F.J.C. game,
did not score a point.
For the reserves, Bill Rumbley,
Bill Masters, and Stan Graff stood
out. Rumbley tanked six points,
while Masters showed that he was
fully recovered from a bad attack
of fiu by playing an excellent game
at forward, scoring four points.
Graff was all over the court in his
short span of action.
For Piedmont, Dana's 10 points,
all in the second half, gave him
scoring honors, closely followed by
Frank McCann and Oilie Hamlin, a
couple of dead-eye forwards, with
seven each.

Following last week's two easy
victories, Stanford's frosh basketball
team is settling down to hard prac
tice in preparation for their hardest
week-end of their schedule, come
February 18-19.
Friday night the Papooses will
tangle with the California Bear Cubs
again and Saturday they oppose the
powerful Santa Clara frosh.
After Wednesday's 40-19 rout of
San Francisco Junior College, the
Stanfords came back last Saturday
to smear Piedmont High to the tune
of 41-29. Coach Basil Peterson's
Highlanders were no match for
Papooses and were trailing 25-10 at
the half.
In the second period, Coach Wytze
Gorter started Stanford's reserves,
and things immediately began to
pop. Led by Jack Dana, lanky cen
ter, who was popping baskets from
all corners of the Pavilion, the preps
started to fight back. However, while
they did outplay the frosh reserves,
they at no time came close to eve
ning the score.
