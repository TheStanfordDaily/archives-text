# Trueblood Speaks On Immortality
## 
### 
Presenting his last sermon of the
academic year, Dr. D. Elton True
-1 blood, University chaplain, spoke
| yesterday morning at Memorial
1 Church on "Divine Worship and
| Sermon."
Because the Founders' Grant pro
vided there should be a place of
worship on the campus in which
immortality would be preached, Dr.
Trueblood's sermon related to the
subject of immortality. He said the
mystery of life after death is no
greater than that of other things
1 usually taken for granted. The
j sermon concluded with arguments
of the well-known American psy
jehologist, William James, a believer
in immortality.
