# Rain Postpones Frosh Baseball
## 
### 
The third game in a row to be
postponed on account of the rain
j was chalked up Friday against the
| Frosh baseballers, when their
i scheduled tilt with Commerce High
went by the boards.
However, the Papooses are not
having quite as hard a time as the
I Bear Cubs over in Berkeley. Be
i ginning their practice period about
a month ago, the Cubs have not been
able to practice enough to even pick
out a tentative starting squad. The
Encina sluggers are comparatively
far ahead.
I A game with Balboa High is on
I tap for tomorrow on the Frosh dia-
I mond. This tilt looks very much as
! if it will follow the rule set by its
three predecessors as the fourth
postponed encounter.
Practice today depends entirely
upon the weather man. If possible,
the squad will get in a workout,
and battery practice will be at
tempted.
