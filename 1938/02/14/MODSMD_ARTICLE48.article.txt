# Where Do We Come In?
## 
### 
FOR some time now the question of where
American universities are going and what
they are trying to do has been bobbing up
in odd places and making itself thoroughly
annoying to people who feel uneasy when
they haven't got a pat explanation for the
universe in one-syllable words.
Last night it came up in a bull session at
about the, time when cigarettes begin to run
low and shadows of great things seem to be
dodging elusively through the strata of smoke.
It wasn't answered, a fact which surprised no
one. But it led to the conclusion that our
universities have taken contradiction for their
compass and are now charging madly in pur
suit of an intellectual mirage.
Universities are founded with one great de
clared purpose—to give knowledge to the stu
dents. They assume that knowledge is worth
giving. They assume that students need it.
They do not question the ultimate good that
comes from possessing it. Every college de
clares that it exists to discover truth and give
it to students.
But somewhere in the course of development
and maturation our universities have lost sight
of the motto carved over their gates. Instead
of working to find truth and teach it, they now
work to "make a better university." On the face
of it, this seems a reasonable aim. It looks like
a means to the avowed primary ends. But sur
face appearance covers an inferential broad
jump that approaches the world's record. In
stead of working toward their declared goals,
the universities now work only toward the
greater glory of the Universities.
They have lost sight of the fact that they
have a function. They have taken over the
idea that there is a "university soul" which is
something more than the parts that make it up.
And they work for the glory of this soul, for
getting their declared purposes.
It all stems from the Hegelian idea that in
a relationship there is something actual. It
springs from the belief, admitted or not, that
when a group of students, a faculty, and a set
of buildings are brought together, something
arises out of the relationship which is greater
than all the parts. This is the idea of the
"spirit of the University"; it is the idea that
something exists which is over and above the
tangible parts of the college, something which
has no function, something which exists for its
own sake.
And so we work for the glory of a concept,
for the betterment of an intangible "essence of
configuration," which we consider to spring
into being when the students, faculty, and
buildings are brought We subordi
nate the other parts to this concept. We work
not to educate students; that is a by-product
of making a "better university." We have
transposed the end and the by-product.
We put up money to crack atoms, not to
discover truth, but to make this a "better uni
versity." Our efforts are directed at the glori
fication of the intangible spirit that is the uni
versity rather than at the education and discov
ery that is the university's avowed reason for
existing.
All of this is not bad in itself. There is no
absolute standard of philosophic values, and
the idea of art for art's sake is, for all we
know, as close to "Truth" as anything else. But
this is a utilitarian age; and our universities
are founded with a utilitarian object. When
they lose sight of this, they fall into a contra
diction; they break with the philosophy of
their civilization. They lose their value to
those who expect them to do what they declare
they will do.
These were the conclusions that the bull ses
sion reached before the cigarettes ran out and
tho boys witli eight o'clocks began to get wor

ried. The conclusions of a bull session are
notoriously fantastic, and it would be a rash
man who would stand back of these. But then
Pontius Pilate's wise crack of two thousand
years ago still remains unanswered. "What is
Truth?"—J. C.

jump that approaches the world's record. In
stead of working toward their declared goals,
the universities now work only toward the
greater glory of the Universities.
They have lost sight of the fact that they
have a function. They have taken over the
idea that there is a "university soul" which is
something more than the parts that make it up.
And they work for the glory of this soul, for
getting their declared purposes.
It all stems from the Hegelian idea that in
a relationship there is something actual. It
springs from the belief, admitted or not, that
when a group of students, a faculty, and a set
of buildings are brought together, something
arises out of the relationship which is greater
than all the parts. This is the idea of the
"spirit of the University"; it is the idea that
something exists which is over and above the
tangible parts of the college, something which
has no function, something which exists for its
own sake.
And so we work for the glory of a concept,
for the betterment of an intangible "essence of
configuration," which we consider to spring
into being when the students, faculty, and
buildings are brought We subordi
nate the other parts to this concept. We work
not to educate students; that is a by-product
of making a "better university." We have
transposed the end and the by-product.
We put up money to crack atoms, not to
discover truth, but to make this a "better uni
versity." Our efforts are directed at the glori
fication of the intangible spirit that is the uni
versity rather than at the education and discov
ery that is the university's avowed reason for
existing.
All of this is not bad in itself. There is no
absolute standard of philosophic values, and
the idea of art for art's sake is, for all we
know, as close to "Truth" as anything else. But
this is a utilitarian age; and our universities
are founded with a utilitarian object. When
they lose sight of this, they fall into a contra
diction; they break with the philosophy of
their civilization. They lose their value to
those who expect them to do what they declare
they will do.
These were the conclusions that the bull ses
sion reached before the cigarettes ran out and
tho boys witli eight o'clocks began to get wor

ried. The conclusions of a bull session are
notoriously fantastic, and it would be a rash
man who would stand back of these. But then
Pontius Pilate's wise crack of two thousand
years ago still remains unanswered. "What is

FOR some time now the question of where
American universities are going and what
they are trying to do has been bobbing up
in odd places and making itself thoroughly
annoying to people who feel uneasy when
they haven't got a pat explanation for the
universe in one-syllable words.
Last night it came up in a bull session at
about the, time when cigarettes begin to run
low and shadows of great things seem to be
dodging elusively through the strata of smoke.
It wasn't answered, a fact which surprised no
one. But it led to the conclusion that our
universities have taken contradiction for their
compass and are now charging madly in pur
suit of an intellectual mirage.
Universities are founded with one great de
clared purpose—to give knowledge to the stu
dents. They assume that knowledge is worth
giving. They assume that students need it.
They do not question the ultimate good that
comes from possessing it. Every college de
clares that it exists to discover truth and give
it to students.
But somewhere in the course of development
and maturation our universities have lost sight
of the motto carved over their gates. Instead
of working to find truth and teach it, they now
work to "make a better university." On the face
of it, this seems a reasonable aim. It looks like
a means to the avowed primary ends. But sur
face appearance covers an inferential broad
jump that approaches the world's record. In

the universities now work only toward the
