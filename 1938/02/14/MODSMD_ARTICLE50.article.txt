STANFORD STOCK
its policy in regard to material—and
on examination it proves a little more reasonable
than one might -at first suppose—the Division of Speech
and Drama is doing one thing which promises much,
not only for Stanford drama, but perhaps for later
enterprise on a larger and more exciting scale.
Stanford is developing a stock company. Out of the
many who perform in its productions it is gradually
weeding out the best and giving them the parts they
merit in the plays they deserve. It is slowly but sure
ly putting on the Stanford stage a competent, well
knit company which accepts with assurance and skill
whatever is offered it.
It had much to do with making "Murder in the
Cathedral" a stirring and valuable production. It was
almost the only thing which made "The Governor's
Wife" even palatable. It contributed its swashbuck
ling gentlemen and gracious ladies to "Don Juan" and
"Winter's Tale," and it is going on in the future to do
Ibsen's "The Vikings."
Various of its members will lend their talents to
the double bill of one-act plays which the division will
offer toward the end of the month; and still others will
take part in Stagers' production of "Blue Jeans" this
coming week-end.
Stanford's stock company does not go in for the
star-system, and the fact that an increasingly small
number of people are being given the leads would
seem to be only proof that its program is doing just
what it should do—developing actors worthy of the
name and placing at their disposal the experience they
must have if they are to do anything of worth in the
acting field.
* * * *
'T'HIS is doubtless contrary to division policy—or,
rather, to the policy which is imposed on the di
vision. Hampered by its obligation to find a part for
everybody, it is trying desperately to keep everybody
happy by an even distribution of roles; and when it
finds itself forced by the sheer worth of its actors into
giving certain of them better parts than it gives the
others, it must sometimes wonder what good the sys
tem is, anyway.
But this is a problem which time and audience re
action will settle; and for the present it is enough that
the actors who deserve starring roles are getting them.
As in any stock company, a supporting cast is neces
sary to counterbalance the tried-and-trues at the top,
and this Stanford is slowly and surely developing.
One could ask no more.
In one regard, at least, the Division of Speech and
Drama is fulfilling its function. It is giving experi
ence to such thespians as Gary Simpson, Frances
Farmer, J. P. Cahn, and their like, and perhaps in the
final analysis this more than excuses any temporary
lapses in the quality of its productions.—Allen Drury.

STANFORD STOCK
its policy in regard to material—and
on examination it proves a little more reasonable
than one might -at first suppose—the Division of Speech
and Drama is doing one thing which promises much,
not only for Stanford drama, but perhaps for later
enterprise on a larger and more exciting scale.
Stanford is developing a stock company. Out of the
many who perform in its productions it is gradually
weeding out the best and giving them the parts they
merit in the plays they deserve. It is slowly but sure
ly putting on the Stanford stage a competent, well
knit company which accepts with assurance and skill
whatever is offered it.
It had much to do with making "Murder in the
Cathedral" a stirring and valuable production. It was
almost the only thing which made "The Governor's
Wife" even palatable. It contributed its swashbuck
ling gentlemen and gracious ladies to "Don Juan" and
"Winter's Tale," and it is going on in the future to do
Ibsen's "The Vikings."
Various of its members will lend their talents to
the double bill of one-act plays which the division will
offer toward the end of the month; and still others will
take part in Stagers' production of "Blue Jeans" this
coming week-end.
Stanford's stock company does not go in for the
star-system, and the fact that an increasingly small
number of people are being given the leads would
seem to be only proof that its program is doing just
what it should do—developing actors worthy of the
name and placing at their disposal the experience they
must have if they are to do anything of worth in the
acting field.

'T'HIS is doubtless contrary to division policy—or,
rather, to the policy which is imposed on the di
vision. Hampered by its obligation to find a part for
everybody, it is trying desperately to keep everybody
happy by an even distribution of roles; and when it
finds itself forced by the sheer worth of its actors into
giving certain of them better parts than it gives the
others, it must sometimes wonder what good the sys
tem is, anyway.
But this is a problem which time and audience re
action will settle; and for the present it is enough that
the actors who deserve starring roles are getting them.
As in any stock company, a supporting cast is neces
sary to counterbalance the tried-and-trues at the top,
and this Stanford is slowly and surely developing.
One could ask no more.
In one regard, at least, the Division of Speech and
Drama is fulfilling its function. It is giving experi
ence to such thespians as Gary Simpson, Frances
Farmer, J. P. Cahn, and their like, and perhaps in the
final analysis this more than excuses any temporary
lapses in the quality of its productions.—Allen Drury.
