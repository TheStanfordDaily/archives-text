# GOIN' MY WAY

JN THIS day of society's rapid disintegi'ation, and the
constant headlong plunge of the younger generaton
towards the lap of the Devil, the matter of proper dress
in proper places shows a trend which must be dis
tressing to sartorial experts.
Attire Saturday night in the Fairmont's Circus
Lounge demonstrates what we're getting at. Starting
with the assumption that a tuxedo would be more in
than out of place, several gentlemen dropped in at
tired in tails —just step on the other side of the tux
edo. Going down the other way from our standard,
the dark suit was popular. Bostonian society would
not tolerate the mixing of the three under any cir
cumstances.
Further, guests of the Circus Lounge, seeing the
relation of the dark suit to the sport coat, joined the
throng in bright checks, thus giving a nice picture of
social camaraderie. The crowning touch—which we
can only trace to the days of the Stanford rough—was
the casual appearance of one gentleman sans tie.
The logical steps are obvious: from an open collar
to a sports jacket is but a step; and with the informal
customs of this day and age, sports coats and dark
suits mix without any trouble. Dark suits and tuxes
can always be found together, and from the tux to the
full dress is no jump at all. Hereafter, we may expect
to see blue jeans at the junior prom, and in reverse re
lationship, starched shirts at jolly-ups.
The man without a tie looked mighty comfortable,
we might add.

j>ERHAPS the informal attire of the gentleman in
question may be laid to the mysterious disappear
ance of one of Emily Post's books from the Fiji house,
a few weeks ago. The brothers were at a loss to un
derstand the motives of the thief—after stealing Emily
Post, what would you have? It seems so futile. Nerv
ous tension of the house—which began having night
mares of committing innumerable faux pas at Sunday
night suppers—was released, however, when after
two weeks, the book was as mysteriously returned.
Brothers remarked that the corners were dog-eared
at a page on "nice girls don't neck."

To CHANGE this rambling discussion, we heard of
a guest conductor at the Philadelphia Symphony,
who was, to say the least, rather over his head. Dur
ing rehearsal, he had a tougher time than a one-armed
wallpaper hanger with poison oak. He did every
thing but jam the baton down the bassoon.
After losing his place countless times, stopping,
starting, ranting, and thoroughly mixing the players
up, he finally got going, and was well on his way to
establish a record of conducting 32 consecutive meas
ures without mistaking a fly speck for a cadenza for
trombone.
The orchestra—still a little confused—stopped for
a grand dramatic pause, only for the tympany player,
who ended up a measure behind and thundered out
with a roll which rivaled the eruption of Vesuvius.
The conductor was furious.
W lio did thathr shrieked. Rehonrsal was railed
iM'cauMc of lain,- Stone.

question may be laid to the mysterious disappear
ance of one of Emily Post's books from the Fiji house,
a few weeks ago. The brothers were at a loss to un
derstand the motives of the thief—after stealing Emily
Post, what would you have? It seems so futile. Nerv
ous tension of the house—which began having night
mares of committing innumerable faux pas at Sunday
night suppers—was released, however, when after
two weeks, the book was as mysteriously returned.
Brothers remarked that the corners were dog-eared
at a page on "nice girls don't neck."

To CHANGE this rambling discussion, we heard of
a guest conductor at the Philadelphia Symphony,
who was, to say the least, rather over his head. Dur
ing rehearsal, he had a tougher time than a one-armed
wallpaper hanger with poison oak. He did every
thing but jam the baton down the bassoon.
After losing his place countless times, stopping,
starting, ranting, and thoroughly mixing the players
up, he finally got going, and was well on his way to
establish a record of conducting 32 consecutive meas
ures without mistaking a fly speck for a cadenza for
trombone.
The orchestra—still a little confused—stopped for
a grand dramatic pause, only for the tympany player,
who ended up a measure behind and thundered out
with a roll which rivaled the eruption of Vesuvius.
The conductor was furious.
W lio did thathr shrieked. Rehonrsal was railed
iM'cauMc of lain,- Stone.
JN THIS day of society's rapid disintegi'ation, and the
constant headlong plunge of the younger generaton
towards the lap of the Devil, the matter of proper dress
in proper places shows a trend which must be dis
tressing to sartorial experts.
Attire Saturday night in the Fairmont's Circus
Lounge demonstrates what we're getting at. Starting
with the assumption that a tuxedo would be more in
than out of place, several gentlemen dropped in at
tired in tails —just step on the other side of the tux
edo. Going down the other way from our standard,
the dark suit was popular. Bostonian society would
not tolerate the mixing of the three under any cir
cumstances.
Further, guests of the Circus Lounge, seeing the
relation of the dark suit to the sport coat, joined the
throng in bright checks, thus giving a nice picture of
social camaraderie. The crowning touch—which we
can only trace to the days of the Stanford rough—was
the casual appearance of one gentleman sans tie.
The logical steps are obvious: from an open collar
to a sports jacket is but a step; and with the informal
customs of this day and age, sports coats and dark
suits mix without any trouble. Dark suits and tuxes
can always be found together, and from the tux to the
full dress is no jump at all. Hereafter, we may expect
to see blue jeans at the junior prom, and in reverse re
lationship, starched shirts at jolly-ups.
The man without a tie looked mighty comfortable,
we might add.
