# March Loses Buccaneer' To Tamiroff
## 
### 
Akim Tamiroff, as Dominique You,
stealing the show from Frederic
March, made "Buccaneer," playing
at the Stanford todav and tomorrow,
a really top-ranking picture. Char
acterizations of General Andrew
"Old Hickory" Jackson and his fur
capped back-woods orderly, Mr.
Peters, add to the story. Francisca
Gaal, in her first appearance on the
screen here, is lovely and possesses
a charming accent.
Frederic March carries off his role
with a good average portrayal of
Jean Laiitte, last of the pirates.
Boastful and sure of himself, he
adopts the title of "Boss," and leads
his thousand men to plundered
riches.
But old Mominique You, the ex
gunner of Napoleon and one of La
fitte's captains, bragging of the es-

teem in which
the Emperor held
him, fails to ex
plain how he hap
pened to leave
the French army.
Calling Gretchen,
Francisca Gaal,
such endearing
names as "my
little crab apple,"
he is disappointed

when she won't marry him. Never
theless, he fits her out in proper
garb for the ball celebrating Ameri
can victory before New Orleans.
Thanking him for it, she raises his
handle-bar mustache, and kisses his
cheek.
Mr. Peters, the orderly, calls his
general, Andy, and makes him take
his pills. His best line is in response
to the frequent "Mistah Peters":
"What's a troublin' ye, Andy?" This
with his rifle held in readiness.
Co-featured is "The Kid Comes
Back," with Wayne Morris who
hasn't improved much. There isn't
enough boxing to keep the audience
interested, and the ill-assorted cast
provides little in the way of enter
tainment for even an uncritical
audience.—Alward.
