"The present plant of the Palo
Alto Hospital is now being taxed to
the utmost of its 80-bed capacity,
even though no epidemic exists,"
the committee's report declared.
Ordinance providing for the bond
election specifies that the bonds, if
authorized, will be issued to bear
interest at a rate not exceeding 4
per cent. Such an interest rate will
be subject to bid prices, however, it
was announced.

City officials have estimated that
the addition will cause no changes
in the present plant's ability to pay
for itself, inasmuch as the present
quarters are over-crowded, and the
addition to the number of patients
will enable the hospital to remain
on a profit basis.
No changes in the present plant,
located on the campus near Palm
Drive and El Camino Real, other
than the addition of the four-floor
wing, will be made, inasmuch as
the kitchen and technical labora
tories were originally built and
equipped to handle larger capaci
ties.
