### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 14 (UP).—O. O. j
Mclntyre, the small-town boy from :
Gallipolis, 0., who won fame and
wealth interpreting the big city,
died today.
His death apparently was caused
by a heart attack. Only his wife
was with him in the apartment.
Mclntyre applied to New York the
principles he learned when he was j
a reporter for the Gallipolis Journal j
in 1902. At his death his column,
"New York Day by Day," was syn
dicated in 380 newspapers, earning
him a huge salary.
Personalized N.Y.
Mclntyre gained his great popu
larity by personalizing New York,
by treating its masses of stone and
steel and its millions of inhabitants
as though they were places and peo
ple whom he knew intimately and (
whom his readers wanted to know, j
He was born in Plattsburg, Mo., 1
Feb. 18, 1884, and was educated at
Bartlett's College in Cincinnati.
From the Gallipolis Journal he went !
to the East Liverpool, 0., Tribune >
as a feature writer and in 1906, j
when he was 22, he became political j
writer and later managing editor of
the Dayton, 0., Herald.
From the Herald he went to the
Cincinnati Post as successively tele- [
graph editor, city editor, and assist- |
ant inanaging editor and became j
also an associate editor of Hamp- I
ton's Magazine.
Illness Brief

Saturday. Following his lifelong
practice, he refused to call a doctor.
He died about 2 a.m. today in his
Park Avenue apartment. Mcln
tyre would have observed his 54th j
birthday on February 18.
In 1912 he took the big leap—he

ary flair brought him the coveted |
job of' drama editor on the New |
York Evening Mail. Not long after
