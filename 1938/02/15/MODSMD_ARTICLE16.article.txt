# Sandburg Speech May Start Lecture Series
## 
### 
Carl Sandburg's lecture in the
Memorial Hall auditorium Thurs
day night may lead to the estab
lishment of a permanent Slanford
Lecture Series, if the plans of Beth
Allen, chairman of the A.S.S.U.
committee on public exercises, prove
successful.
The traditional campus belief that
"there r.re already too many activi
ties" is, in her opinion, the most im
portant factor delaying considera
tion of the Lecture Series idea.
If Lecture Series were organized,
?.liss Allen believes that it should be
operated in conjunction with the
present Concert Series, and that it
should plan to present four out
standing speakers during the school
year, one in the autumn, two in the
winter, and one in the spring quar
ter.
Admitting that a Lecture Series
would require a considerable annual
investment for the A.S.S.U., the
committee chairman believes that

this would be outweighed by "the
ending of Stanford's isolation
through the bringing of good enter
tainment to the campus." Similar
lecture programs have been estab
lished in several Eastern universi
ties. she pointed out.
At the present time plans for a
Lecture Series are entirely tentative
and are dependent upon the attend
ance, particularly of students, at Mr.
Sandburg's lecture, she said. Ex
Committee has approved the presen
tation of Mr. Sandburg as "a test
case," Miss Allen declared.
"If it is a success, we can probably
have a Lecture Series," she con
cluded.
Tickets for Mr. Sandburg's lec
ture, which will include a reading
of several of his poems and singing
of American folk songs, continue on
sale today at the A.S.S.U. office and
at Keeble s, Palo Alto. They are
priced at 50 cents for students and
75 cents for outsiders.
