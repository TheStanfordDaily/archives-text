# Voters To Decide Hospital Bonds
## 
### 
Authorization of a $175,000 bond
issue, to be used to build an 80-bed
addition to the Palo Alto Hospital,
will be voted upon in Palo Alto to
day.
Plans for use of the money call
for construction of a four-story wing
to be added to the present structure,
which is located on the campus near
Palm Drive and El Camino. Need
for the addition was disclosed last
December when a special committee
appointed by the Palo Alto City
Council found the present 80-bed
structure inadequate.
According to the ordinance calling
the issue before the voters, the
bonds, if authorized, will bear in
terest at a rate not exceeding 4 per
cent ancf will be subject to bid.
