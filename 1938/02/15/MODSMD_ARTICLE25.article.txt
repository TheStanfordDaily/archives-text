# Fund Drive Investigation To Continue
## Committee To Report To Excom On Plans To Curb Canvassing 
### 
Campus fund drives will undergo
Ex Commitee's scrutiny again to
night, when members hear the re
port of a committee of three ap
pointed last week by President Tom
Kiliefer to study the situation and
make recommendations.
Members of the committee arc
Bob Garretson, Jack Beman, and
John Cobbs. Last night they plan
ned to meet again today to whip
their report into final shape. Ac
tion on this problem is occasioned
by the increasing number of organ
ization drives for funds and by Axe
Society's recent campaign in par
ticular.
Approval Committee
One solution suggested last week
was that a committee be appointed,
including both students and fac
ulty members, to approve or dis
approve each individual drive. The
committee's sole function would be
passing on money-raising projects.
Its sanction would be necessary be
fore any drive could be organized.
It was also suggested that Ex
Committee itself consider all re
quests for drives, or that it appoint
a special committee every time an
application was received. Other
business will include appointment of
three men to the planning commit
tee for a "leadership institute" to be
held spring quarter. One objection
to last spring's institute was that it
wcis planned and attended mostly by
the women.
Plans Outlined
Last week Ex Committee decided
that men as well as women could
benefit by the program, that one way
to interest the men was to put
some of them on the committee.
Women's committees are already
outlining plans for the institute, but
it has not yet been decided which
of the meetings will be open to the
campus as a whole.
Committee members felt last week
that open meetings on some subjects
would not be conducive to the most
effective discussion. President Tom
Killefer said, however, that topics
considered at the meetings—meth
ods of student organization and du
ties of campus leaders—will be of
interest to the whole student body.
