### 
The ideal summer vacation, a long
sailing trip, around the islands of the
South Seas, was announced in the
offing for 10 college men by Boyd
White, organizer of the recent cam
pus infantile paralysis drive.
Captain Garland Rotch, builder
and skipper of ''Zaca," a San Fran
cisco sailing yacht that has made
numerous scientific expeditions in
tropical waters, is going to charter
an 80-foot, two-masted schooner the
latter part of this coming June and
will take with him as crew 10 men
of college age, most of them from
Stanford.
White, who is representing Cap
tain Rotch at Stanford, says that the
voyagers will man the ship them
selves. The Captain, who has spent
a lifetime on the sea, will direct his
novice crew personally.
The complete voyage will cover
18,000 miles of travel. Stopping
points will include the Fijis, the
Samoans, New Guinea, the Carolyn
Islands, and Pitcairn Island, made

famous by the picture "Mutiny on
the Bounty." As a matter of scien
tific interest the group will visit
Maiden Island, an isolated spot in
the South Atlantic where ancient
archeological specimens have re
cently been found.
In addition to scientific study of
nature and the South Sea Island I
people, the crew of Captain Rotch's j
schooner will take pictures and ;
write accounts of their travels. Wri- j
ters and photographers are there- !
fore wanted.

will take the seafarers down the (
coast of Lower California and Mex
ico, across the Pacific to Maiden J
Island, from Maiden to the Fijis, j

erous other islands in the South !
Atlantic. The return trip will be t
