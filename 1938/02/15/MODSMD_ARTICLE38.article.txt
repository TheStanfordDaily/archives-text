## 
### 
Monroe Smith, national organizer
of American Youth Hostels, and
Frank Duveneck, chairman of the
regional sponsoring committee, met
recently in Palo Alto to discuss
planns for establishing 30 new youth
hostels in. California this summer.
Youth hostels are small hotels run
in private homes for the use of
people who are hiking or bicycling
through the country. The cost for
staying overnight at one of the hos
tels is 25 cents at the most. Guests
cook their own meals, wash their
dishes, and make their own beds.
This informal type of traveling has
proved very popular in Europe and
the eastern United States. Because
of the many attractions of Califor
nia, Smith and Duveneck think the
youth hostels would prove valu
able here.
The new hostels here will be lo
cated in the Sierras, Monterey Bay
area, in the Redwood area, and other
interesting parts of the state. Hidden
Villa, a youth hostel a few miles
from here, first proved that the plan
could be successful in California.
Sponsored by Duveneck, Hidden
Villa has proved very popular to
week-end parties.
The new hostels will be patterned
after this, run by owners of the
homes selected, and sponsored by a
local committee which has full re
sponsibility for the hostel. It is ex
pected that the new hostels will be
chartered by May 1, so they will be
ready for use in the early summer.
