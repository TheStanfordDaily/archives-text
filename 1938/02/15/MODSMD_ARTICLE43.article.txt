TIIE FIRST GAME
IS TOMORROWâ€”MAYBE
In answer 'to the impassioned ap- j
peal of Slants for freshmen rugby j
players last Friday, there came to
Coach Harry Maloney one fresh- j
man. One.
Added to the men already out for
the sport, that player still fails to
bring the total up to 15, the regula- |
lion number for a team.
Even though Coach Maloney still
has hopes of getting enough men j
out for a team, the matter is fast |
approaching a crisis. It seems that |
the team has its first game tomor- j
row.
Something has to be done about 1
it by the freshmen, not tomorrow, J
not next week, but today, Tuesday, !
Feb. 15, 1938.
THE VARSITY MAY
MAKE A TRIP
Also concerning rugby is the news
of the impending trip of the varsity
to New York during spring vacation.
As far as Stanford is concerned a j
team can be sent back, but there |
has been a little trouble promoting [
the games in the east.
New York is rugby-minded, ac- j
cording to Coach Harry Maloney, I
and should be interested in games j
between Stanford and Princeton, [
Harvard, and Yale. These three}
schools have been contacted and are |
willing to play, but the completion |
of arrangements have been held up J
because of financial difficulties at j
that end, not here.
In addition to games with those
three schools, there has been tenta- I
lively scheduled a contest between!
aii all-star team made up of Prince- I
ton, Harvard and Yale players and [
the Indians. While the first three
gimes are to be held on the respect
ive campuses of the eastern schools,
the all-star tilt would be played at
Randall Field, New York. Accord
ing to Coach Maloney it should draw
a good crowd.
In addition to the attraction of the
game itself, Coach Maloney thinks
it possible for him to get his long
time friend Gene Tunney, former |
heavyweight fight champion, to I
make the first kickoff. With the ;
presence of Tunney, the game should '
take on considerable added attract- j
iveness for sports fans.
If finally agreed upon, the games j
will be hold during spring vacation, j
after the completion of the home |
rugby season.
THIS VARSITY WON'T
MAKE A TRIP
Previous to the winter tour taken
by (he basketball team this season
there was a definite possibility that
the Stanford varsity would go to
Hawaii at the completion of the con
ference season.
This was to occur provided the
team did not win the southern di- !
vision, which would necessitate a
playoff with the northern division
winner and hence would conflict '
with a trip to the Islands during I
spring vacation.
However, not long ego it was de- |
cided that the University of Wash- !
ington' team would be invited from
the Coast Conference, and so Stan
ford has had to forget about a
junket to the land of pineapple.
Whether that has had anything to
do with the fall of Washington from
a contending position in the con
ference race up north is something
that will never be decided.
