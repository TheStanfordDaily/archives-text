# Bunn Scouts Watch Cal Trip Bruins
## Coach Gives Squad Offensive Variation For Tilt With Bears 
### HARRY PRESS 
When "Dan'l Boone" Goiter and
"Kit Carson" Winklemar. went a
scouting on the Berkeley frontier
last week-end, they discovered
some mighty potent information in
them thar hills.
They watched the cavemen bur
row out from their little hovels in
Edwards Gym to do battle with the
little B'ar invaders from the south.
And while the cavemen repulsed
the baby B'ars twice, they looked
fairly impotent in doing so. Notic
ing their impotency, the two Injun
scouts scratched down a few notes
on birchbark, to bring home to
Headman John Bunn.
Cards Change Play
Sum total of all this scurrying
around is a slight, but O-so-import
ant change in the Laughing Boys'
type of play, creating especially for
those Cavemen-who-reside-across
the-mudHats.
Headman Bunn gave the new
maneuvers to the second stringers,
whose work looked mighty effec
tive. The varsity was granted a rest
period today, giving their stiffness
and sore spots received in the U.S.C.
series a chance to work out.
Bunn Speaks
Jubilant over the Laughing Boys'
success over the week-end, Head
man Bunn said:
"Although the boys were overly
cautious Friday night, they really
let loose in the second game. Every
man was playing at the peak of his
ability, and consequently the team
played one of its best games of the
season,
"The last time Stanford won both
games from U.S.C., while playing in
Los Angeles, was in 1923. Andy
Kerr was coach here at that time,
and since that year, no Stanford
team has been able to take both
southern tilts. That's why both
teams were so tense in the first
game."
Plan Easy Workouts
The Card coach plans to give the
varsity only light workouts this
week in preparation for the third
game of the Cal-Stanford series, to
be played Friday night in the Pa
vilion. The Indians meet Santa
Clara Saturday night, also in the
Pavilion.
The 1150 tickets for the Cal game,
sold under the new system of only
two to a person, were all gone at
9:10 o'clock yesterday morning. Rea
son for the fast sale, according to
Don Liebendorfer, was that "The
limit on tickets eliminated conges
tion at the, booth, speeding up the
line considerably."'
Approximately 100 standing room
tickets will be available to students
for the game. They will be placed
on sale at 8 o'clock Friday night.

fairly impotent in doing so. Notic
ing their impotency, the two Injun
scouts scratched down a few notes
on birchbark, to bring home to
Headman John Bunn.
Cards Change Play
Sum total of all this scurrying
around is a slight, but O-so-import
ant change in the Laughing Boys'
type of play, creating especially for
those Cavemen-who-reside-across
the-mudHats.
Headman Bunn gave the new
maneuvers to the second stringers,
whose work looked mighty effec
tive. The varsity was granted a rest
period today, giving their stiffness
and sore spots received in the U.S.C.
series a chance to work out.
Bunn Speaks
Jubilant over the Laughing Boys'
success over the week-end, Head
man Bunn said:
"Although the boys were overly
cautious Friday night, they really
let loose in the second game. Every
man was playing at the peak of his
ability, and consequently the team
played one of its best games of the
season,
"The last time Stanford won both
games from U.S.C., while playing in
Los Angeles, was in 1923. Andy
Kerr was coach here at that time,
and since that year, no Stanford
team has been able to take both
southern tilts. That's why both
teams were so tense in the first
game."
Plan Easy Workouts
The Card coach plans to give the
varsity only light workouts this
week in preparation for the third
game of the Cal-Stanford series, to
be played Friday night in the Pa
vilion. The Indians meet Santa
Clara Saturday night, also in the
Pavilion.
The 1150 tickets for the Cal game,
sold under the new system of only
two to a person, were all gone at
9:10 o'clock yesterday morning. Rea
son for the fast sale, according to
Don Liebendorfer, was that "The
limit on tickets eliminated conges
tion at the, booth, speeding up the
line considerably."'
Approximately 100 standing room
tickets will be available to students
for the game. They will be placed
on sale at 8 o'clock Friday night.
When "Dan'l Boone" Goiter and
"Kit Carson" Winklemar. went a
scouting on the Berkeley frontier
last week-end, they discovered
some mighty potent information in
them thar hills.
They watched the cavemen bur
row out from their little hovels in
Edwards Gym to do battle with the
little B'ar invaders from the south.
And while the cavemen repulsed
the baby B'ars twice, they looked
fairly impotent in doing so. Notic
ing their impotency, the two Injun
scouts scratched down a few notes
on birchbark, to bring home to
Headman John Bunn.
