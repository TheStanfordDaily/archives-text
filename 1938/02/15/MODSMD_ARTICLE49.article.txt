Four awards for outstanding baiting by Stanford seniors in the annual
baseball series with California have been offered by Abe Lewis Jr., Ilono
-0
lulu attorney and former Stanford great, in a letter recently received by
Coach Harry Wolter.
Mr. Lewis, who graduated in 1895 and later received his degree in law

from Hastings Law School, San
Francisco, established a three-year
record in Big Games of 16 hits in 27
times at bat, a percentage of .592.
The awards offered by the attor
ney consist of a silver plate, to be
awarded to the first senior whose
average for three years of batting
against California shall equal .400,
and three silver ash trays for the
highest batting seniors graduating
in 1938. 1939. and 1940.
Eligible this year for the silver
plate, as the only men who will have
taken part in California contests for
three years, will be Captain George
Farrell, third base, and Glenn Ham
ilton, center field. Neither as yet
has tin average of .400 for their work
at the plate in Big Games. But each
has the opportunity to bring up his
average in the three games this sea
son.
The trophy will be held until a
graduating senior scales the .400.
However. Farrell and Hamilton will
be eligible for the first of the ash
tray trophies regardless of their
batting averages. The higher of the
two will receive the award.
The donor of the awards was a
member of the Cardinal varsity for
four years, since in that era fresh
men were allowed to play on the
varsity. For his sophomore, junior
and senior year Mr. Lewis clouted
the average of .592 in the Cal series
—his four-year mark was .473.
In addition to his strong record at
the plate, Mr. Lewis established an
enviable record with his base-run
ning. He stole 18 bases in nine Cal
Games and scored 23 runs. Of the
nine games in which he competed.
Stanford won eight.
During his baseball career at
Stanford, Mr. Lewis, played three
different positions. As a freshman
he covered second base, and for his
next two years was shifted to short
stop. As a senior he played at third
base.
