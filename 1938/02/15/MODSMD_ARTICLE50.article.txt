# A.A.U. Contest To Mark Track Debut Of Cards
## Templeton Predicts Malott Will Beat 440 Record This Season 
### 
Led by Captain Ray Malolt, n
select band of Stanford track men
will swing into their opening com
petitive efforts of the season Satur
day night in the Pacific Association
of the A A.U. meet, which will be
held in Civic Auditorium.
Coach Dink Templeton has al- i
ready gone on record as predicting j
that Malott will break the world's
440-yard record this season. He will j
not get a chance to crack it Saturday 1
because he will be running at the I
.catch distance of 600 yards.
A dark-horse in the same event
jis Craig Williamson, an Indian
sophomore who didn't turn out last
I year.
The mile run, featuring Ed Bur
rows of Stanford against Cecil Cole,
ineligible Californian, promises to
I be the most exciting race on the bill,
j although a special four-man mile
| relay race between California and
j Stanford may easily carry off thrill
honors. Malott will run anchor for
Stanford, but the rest of the quartet
i is not decided yet.
Carl Mahurin, half-miler, is out
! of the meet with -a pulled Achilles
tendon. The injury will keep him
on the sidelines only temporarily,
s however.
Coach Templeton expects great
j things of his two shot-putters. Jack
J Montgomery and Jack Lipman,
