# Papoose Mine Faces Fourth Postponement
## Frosh, Ralboa High Will Meet Saturday If Weather Permits 
### 
Definitely postponed, the game
scheduled between the still untried
Farm Frosh and Balboa High for
this afternoon marks the fourth in 1
a successive line of cancellations.
Playing conditions are si ill more
suitable for a water polo tilt than a
diamond encounter, and in the event
the rain gives in by Saturday, the
game has been tentatively sched
uled for that day. "
Yesterday afternoon, although the
field was too muddy for a real
woi'kout, the batteries were tossing
a few to keep kinks from tying up
the hurling arms of the pitchers.
Most of the squad were out keeping
in trim with light practice.
Balboa is an opponent of untried
strength. Hindered from any seri
ous practice by the continued down
pour in the city, their practice ses
sions have been as few and far be
tween as have those of the frosh.
No games have been played be
tween the Card yearlings and Bai
boa for the last few years, and there
fore both will be working doubly
hard to take the proposed game on
Saturdayâ€”weather permitting.
Four games, counting the Balboa
fracas, have been postponed already,
and none has been played. Last
year, according to Hairy Shipkey,
that many games were postponed
during the entire season, which
means that unless the deluge ceases,
the Papooses are going to find them
selves with a season battered with
cancellations.
Unworried by the postponed en
counters, the squad as a whole has
not lost any of their pepper, and it
seems likely that they will be able
to take the field this week-end.
