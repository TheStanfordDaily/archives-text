# Sandburg Sample

AS THE truly native American poetry of Carl
Sandburg is launched into the acoustics of
Memorial Hall Thursday night, Stanford will be
holding a student referendum that won't keep
Election Board up nights or strain the constitu
tion until it bursts a clause. Attendance and
reception of the program will determine wheth
er or not we are to have a lecture series.
If enough students attend to keep the project
off the A.S.S.U. relief rolls, Ex Committee will
consider arrangements for a system of pro
grams of the same type. If the undergraduates
prefer the celluloid gods of Paly theaters, the
project will be buried guietly beneath the plush
seats row on row, and its spirit will be ear
marked for that corner of limbo reserved for
plans that died by explosion.
As a convenient and practical way to sound
the opinion of Stanford's masses, this rates with
the better bits of strategy. It gives us a chance
to get a series of good lectures by noted men,
if we want it. It also keeps us from pledging
our lives, fortunes, and community fees to a
project that possibly may not be a good risk
for a widow's mite. It provides a convenient
and painless way of finding out whether the
students want a lecture series enough to sup
port it.
And student opinion, noted as one of the un
charted seas, needs guite a bit of sounding.
The proposed lecture system would undoubt
edly be a shining addition to Stanford's cul
tural inventory. Three or four talks by men
with certified claims to greatness would put a
nice-looking figure on the asset side of our
educational balance-sheet. But students have
been known to stand the goddess of culture
up on more than one date, and there is no sure
evidence that Emily Post rules will be used in
this case.
After a day crowded with cultural lectures
the undergraduate may find his head spinning
too fast for vesper services. He may be too busy
with other things; or he may find that bankers
can be most unreasonable when accounts are
stretched too far. In short, Stanford may spend
a guiet evening flirting in the library, letting the
proposed lectures perish like a rose cast on
desert sands.
Thursday night we will decide whether or
not we want a lecture series. It's not exactly a
turning point in history; but it's a nice way of
getting mileage out of democracy.â€”J. C.
