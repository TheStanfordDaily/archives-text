# Best of a Bad Bargain

### 
Traditionally The Daily views with
alarm or points with pride at the doings
of the various campus groups and organiza
tions. In general it concerns itself with the busi
ness of others, takes no notice of its own or
ganizational shortcomings. Such was the theme
of an editorial by Editor Frost last volume. The
occasion was The Daily elections, the elevat
ing of one associate editor to Frost's position,
the discarding of the other.
Sunday, The Daily took a look at itself,
considered the proposal that the loser in the
election for editor, admittedly second best man
on the staff, take the second best position â€”
managing editor.
When the scrutiny had ended, The Daily
found itself in much the same position as be
fore. Like governments that strive to be of
laws rather than men, it discovered that its
plan left out the human element. Associate
editors, past and present, were fairly well
agreed that saying that managing editor was as
good as editor wouldn't eliminate disappoint
ment at defeat.
The staff agreed that both men chosen would
have to have alternative gualifications for two
entirely different types of jobs. The nominat
ing procedure would be complicated; getting
the right man in the right job might be less
frequent than at present.
The traditional cycle has been run. The Daily
has pointed the editorial finger. The problem

has been discussed and been found smaller
than pre-election hysteria would make it.
And it was found that changing human na
ture, rather than the forms of organization,
would be the ideal solution.
