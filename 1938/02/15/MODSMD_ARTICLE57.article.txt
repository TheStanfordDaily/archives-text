LAST Monday campus readers looked at the
second page of The Daily, saw four col
umns on scholarships and Edwin Atherton and
wondered what all the excitement was about.

About once a week there seems to occur an
event which cannot be fully explained and put
in its proper background, because of day to

there will be an attempt to choose the most
significant campus event of the week and give
it, in the Monday morning issue, the space and
treatment it deserves.
