ASYLUM IN ENCINA
J>ERHAPS the most interesting suggestion in The
Daily's survey of the foreign student problem in
yesterday's paper—and one which will undoubtedly
win the approval of Encina's sentimental alumni—is
the proposal to house foreign students on the top
floor of the Farm's biggest barn.
Preference will be given them in choice of rooms,
of which 20 will be put at their disposal, and on the
Hall's tender mercies their peace of mind while at
Stanford will to a great extent depend.
Only one major criticism comes to mind, and that
is that segregating foreign students on one floor might
have just the opposite effect from that desii'ed. It
might further rather than destroy their defensive
community feeling, and by more or less isolating them
from their fellow-boarders, remove them from many
of the contacts they need to make if they are to take
their rightful place in the Stanford community.
But considering the state of existence as it is lived
in the freshman zoo, that criticism becomes a straw
man. An inevitable mixing process goes on in Encina,
and rugged individualism, insofar as it applies to any
sort of personal aloofness, has very little chance.
Probably even the language barrier would soon break
down under the influence of water-bags, sponsors,
Commons food, and bull-sessions.

r pHE only other objection even approaching validity
would be that the majority of foreign students are
graduates, while most of Encina's inmates are frosh;
but this, too, becomes unimportant when examined.
If the scheme works out as planned, approximately
half the students on the fifth floor will be American
graduates, possessed of graduate interests and gradu
ate tastes. And even if this were not the case, the fact
that neither foreigner nor freshman knows anything
about his University makes for a friendly and co
operative spirit in meeting the challenge that is Stan
ford.
Encina does much for the great majority of its in
habitants, and it seems right that foreign students
eager to be assimilated should be allowed the benefit
of living in it.
Life at first may seem a little strange, rather like
a madhouse, but the inevitable friendships and good
times will do for the foreign student everything that
they do for the American, and more, for they will give
him the reassuring feeling that he belongs.
