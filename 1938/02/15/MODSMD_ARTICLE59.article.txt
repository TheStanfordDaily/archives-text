# GOIN' MY WAY
## PARILIAS AND PUBS 
### 
each year in San Francisco there was a night
of barbaric revelry. Crazy artists and cosmo
polites painted their bodies exotic colors, put on loin
clothes and sarongs and fantastic home-made head
dresses. The splendoi's of ancient civilizations and
elaborate pageants colored the unrestrained madness
of the night. They shone through an atmosphere
thick with smoke and alcohol and made the Parilia
something to remember.
But every year more college men, more navy petty
officers came to the Art Ball in search of a cardboard
orgy. They had more fun telling their friends about,
how wild it was during the next few days than they
did at the Parilia. It continued to shine as brilliantly
as before, but the artistic spirit was being crushed to
death by something from outside San Francisco, some
thing that did not understand.
So it's gone—the spectacle of that crazy night. The
terraced pyramid covered with lolling Aztecs or Cam
bodians or Romans will not rise in the vast Civic
Auditorium. No Scotch will be sold, but neither will
tom-toms beat out barbaric rhythms while painted
bodies stamp and sway. The Artists' Ball has gone
society.
In the refined atmosphere of old Crete, socialites
and unartistic artists will disport themselves in the
degenerate setting of the Palace Hotel on Feb. 25. Too
much publicity on drunks and scarlet sin at the Parilia
made the San Francisco Art Commission think twice,
made them let the Artists' Ball go smooth this year.
If you've got to go, wear an upper.

the red side of the ledger, the city has two un
usual spots to offer that are really worth while.
For refreshments mixed with a super view, try the
Sky Room of the Hotel Empire (formerly the William
Taylor at the Civic Center). Huge windows on every
side let you look down 25 stories on the lights of San
Francisco and the Bay and the Bridges. T7ne price is
right; the service is Rood; on your next trip up go star
gazing at the Sky Room.
Everybody's talking about the William Tell House.
It s on Clay and Kearny around the corner from the
much-publicized McDonough Brothers offices. But
if you like the old time pre-war spirit of Gemutlich
keit, you 11 like the William Tell House. A German
band oompahs on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday
nights while couples whirl to waltzes, glide to polkas,
and stomp to schottisches.
Bartenders with walrus-mustaches, and blond frau
leins (slightly aged) serve huge steins of beer. You
have to go into the kitchen to help yourself to the free
lunch. The crowd is unselfconsciously happy, singing
and dancing in a Rhinoland selling; bavin;' a wonder
ful time. Livingston.

Bartenders with walrus-mustaches, and blond frau
leins (slightly aged) serve huge steins of beer. You
have to go into the kitchen to help yourself to the free
lunch. The crowd is unselfconsciously happy, singing
and dancing in a Rhinoland selling; bavin;' a wonder
ful time. Livingston.
each year in San Francisco there was a night
of barbaric revelry. Crazy artists and cosmo
polites painted their bodies exotic colors, put on loin
clothes and sarongs and fantastic home-made head
dresses. The splendoi's of ancient civilizations and
elaborate pageants colored the unrestrained madness
of the night. They shone through an atmosphere
thick with smoke and alcohol and made the Parilia
something to remember.
But every year more college men, more navy petty
officers came to the Art Ball in search of a cardboard
orgy. They had more fun telling their friends about,
how wild it was during the next few days than they
did at the Parilia. It continued to shine as brilliantly
as before, but the artistic spirit was being crushed to
death by something from outside San Francisco, some
thing that did not understand.
So it's gone—the spectacle of that crazy night. The
terraced pyramid covered with lolling Aztecs or Cam
bodians or Romans will not rise in the vast Civic
Auditorium. No Scotch will be sold, but neither will
tom-toms beat out barbaric rhythms while painted
bodies stamp and sway. The Artists' Ball has gone
society.
In the refined atmosphere of old Crete, socialites
and unartistic artists will disport themselves in the
degenerate setting of the Palace Hotel on Feb. 25. Too
much publicity on drunks and scarlet sin at the Parilia
made the San Francisco Art Commission think twice,
made them let the Artists' Ball go smooth this year.
If you've got to go, wear an upper.

the red side of the ledger, the city has two un
usual spots to offer that are really worth while.
For refreshments mixed with a super view, try the
Sky Room of the Hotel Empire (formerly the William
Taylor at the Civic Center). Huge windows on every
side let you look down 25 stories on the lights of San
Francisco and the Bay and the Bridges. T7ne price is
right; the service is Rood; on your next trip up go star
gazing at the Sky Room.
Everybody's talking about the William Tell House.
It s on Clay and Kearny around the corner from the
much-publicized McDonough Brothers offices. But
if you like the old time pre-war spirit of Gemutlich
keit, you 11 like the William Tell House. A German
band oompahs on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday
nights while couples whirl to waltzes, glide to polkas,
and stomp to schottisches.
