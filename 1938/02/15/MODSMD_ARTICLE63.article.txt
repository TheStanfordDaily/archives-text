## THOUGHTS OF A STUDENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Ashes! dead cigarette butts clutter
My ash tray, and are as forlorn
As greasy grey dishwater
Or a chewed cob of corn.
My thoughts are all like these
Dead, lifeless, useless, dull
As two soggy unwanted peas
Or a dead, decaying gull!
Oh—Woe!
Oh—hard life!
Oh —insufficiency!
Oh—what the hell!
Good-night, Editor
—J.M.
