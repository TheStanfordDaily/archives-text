# Radio Hour Talk Features Dobbel
## 
### 
Charles A. Dobbet, associate pro
fessor of mining engineering, lec
tured on the Stanford University
Hour over station KGO last evening.
He discussed "Mine Fever vs. Sound
Mining."
"Mining Fever," said Professor
Dobbel in part, "is simply a case of
enthusiasm carried to the point of
self-deeeit. The stability of mining
property is hinged on definite phy
sical, geological, political and social,
historical, legal and financial fac
tors. If sound reason can be ap
plied, the Mark Twain description
that 'a mine is a hole in the ground
owned by a liar, no longer holds
true."
