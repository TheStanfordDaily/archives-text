Can your treasury use $10? What treasury can't? With just a little
leadership on your part, your house may earn $10 cash. Managers, here's all
you have to do.
Get the brothers or sisters to write an ad for the Ad-Writing Contest.
Turn them into the competing stores or the Daily by 5 p.m. on February 23.
For each ad your members write, 5 points will be given to your house. If your
members write one of the 22 winning ads, the house will get 20 points for
each winner. If one of your members writes the best ad submitted (the
writer wins $10 in cash) the house is credited with 40 points.
If your house accumulates the most points—the $10 in cash and a lot of
publicity goes to your house.
Several houses are competing already. Is yours?

Can your treasury use $10? What treasury can't? With just a little
leadership on your part, your house may earn $10 cash. Managers, here's all
you have to do.
Get the brothers or sisters to write an ad for the Ad-Writing Contest.
Turn them into the competing stores or the Daily by 5 p.m. on February 23.
For each ad your members write, 5 points will be given to your house. If your
members write one of the 22 winning ads, the house will get 20 points for
each winner. If one of your members writes the best ad submitted (the
writer wins $10 in cash) the house is credited with 40 points.
If your house accumulates the most points—the $10 in cash and a lot of
publicity goes to your house.
Several houses are competing already. Is yours?
