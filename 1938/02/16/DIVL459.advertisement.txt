HERE ARE A FEW TIPS
Notice the advertiser's past and present style
of advertising.
Study each merchant's specialty, note your own
reactions. What are you looking for in that item?
What interests you most? Ask the merchant lots
of questions; he'll be glad to answer them.
Don't crowd your ads with too much reading
matter, too large type, or too much illustration.
A quiet ad lends dignity, takes away the "Fire
Sale" appearance. Avoid heavy borders and type.
Be brief. Cover the essential points in a few
forceful words.
Be accurate. Don't make misleading or vague
statements. "Truth in Advertising' is more than
just a slogan. It is good business.
Be sure to get the stores name, address, and
telephone number right.
