# Bond Issue For Hospital Carries, 5-1
## Palo Alto Approves Measure To Build $175,000 Addition 
### 
By a majority of almost five to
one, Palo Alto voters yesterday ap
proved a $175,000 bond issue for
construction of an 80-bed addition
to the city-owned hospital.
The vote was: Yes, 1402; no, 308.
Approximately 22 per cent of the
city's 7523 registered voters cast
ballots. A two-thirds majority of
the votes cast was required to carry
the issue.
Building In 6 Weeks
City officials indicated construc
tion of the new wing, which will
double the hospital's capacity, prob
ably will begin late in the spring.
Completion of plans and specifica
tions will take about six weeks, and
bids will be advertised in April.
The proposal to increase the hos
pital's capacity was made in De
cember by a special committee of
city councilmen, headed by E. C.
Thoits. Assisting the council were
Ernest Erwin, assistant comptroller
of Stanford, and L. H. Anderson,
deputy Palo Alto city engineer.
Calls For New Wing
The tentative plans for the new
wing, as presented by the commit
tee and its subcommittee, call for
devoting the first floor, usually con
sidered waste space in a hospital, to
an infirmary for Farm students.
Upper floors would be devoted to
wards, private rooms, and operating
rooms.
In the event that the present floor
plans are carried out, the infirmary
probably would relieve the condi
tions which arise on the campus
about twice a year during the peaks
of respiratory illnesses, according to
administrative officials.
Adequate Facilities
The committee also said the kit
chen, laboratory, x-ray, and laundry
facilities of the present structure are
sufficient to care for the increased
demand which will be made by the
addition of an 80-bed wing.
The wing will be added on the
southwesterly side of the present
building, thereby forming an "L."
II will be four stories, following the
architectural design of the original
wing, which was constructed in 1929.
Taxed By Cases
The present hospital has been
taxed even during so-called "slack"
periods, and during the two peak 3 of
respiratory illness each winter, is
has been difficult to handle patients.
The city council's committee
pointed out the hospital now oper
ates at a profit and that the addi
tion, by lowering per-bed costs,
probably will enable the city to
continue to realize a profit. Stair
ford, under Mr. Erwin's direction,
operates the institution.

devoting the first floor, usually con
sidered waste space in a hospital, to
an infirmary for Farm students.
Upper floors would be devoted to
wards, private rooms, and operating
rooms.
In the event that the present floor
plans are carried out, the infirmary
probably would relieve the condi
tions which arise on the campus
about twice a year during the peaks
of respiratory illnesses, according to
administrative officials.
Adequate Facilities
The committee also said the kit
chen, laboratory, x-ray, and laundry
facilities of the present structure are
sufficient to care for the increased
demand which will be made by the
addition of an 80-bed wing.
The wing will be added on the
southwesterly side of the present
building, thereby forming an "L."
II will be four stories, following the
architectural design of the original
wing, which was constructed in 1929.
Taxed By Cases
The present hospital has been
taxed even during so-called "slack"
periods, and during the two peak 3 of
respiratory illness each winter, is
has been difficult to handle patients.
The city council's committee
pointed out the hospital now oper
ates at a profit and that the addi
tion, by lowering per-bed costs,
probably will enable the city to
continue to realize a profit. Stair
ford, under Mr. Erwin's direction,
operates the institution.
By a majority of almost five to
one, Palo Alto voters yesterday ap
proved a $175,000 bond issue for
construction of an 80-bed addition
to the city-owned hospital.
The vote was: Yes, 1402; no, 308.
Approximately 22 per cent of the
city's 7523 registered voters cast
ballots. A two-thirds majority of
the votes cast was required to carry
the issue.
Building In 6 Weeks
City officials indicated construc
tion of the new wing, which will
double the hospital's capacity, prob
ably will begin late in the spring.
Completion of plans and specifica
tions will take about six weeks, and
bids will be advertised in April.
The proposal to increase the hos
pital's capacity was made in De
cember by a special committee of
city councilmen, headed by E. C.
Thoits. Assisting the council were
Ernest Erwin, assistant comptroller
of Stanford, and L. H. Anderson,
deputy Palo Alto city engineer.
Calls For New Wing
The tentative plans for the new
wing, as presented by the commit
tee and its subcommittee, call for
devoting the first floor, usually con
sidered waste space in a hospital, to
an infirmary for Farm students.

wards, private rooms, and operating
rooms.
