# Democracies Must Unite, Says Hutton
## Journalist Stresses Return To Economic Principles In Talk 
### 
"Democracies must band together
j in a return to nineteenth century
1 economic principles or they will
I tread the rough road like Germany,
I Russia, Italy, and Japan to the
equally rough end of the corporate
} state."
This was the warning note sound
ed by Graham Hutton, British
j journalist and assistant editor of the
) Londan "Economist" as he spoke to
an audience of 800 last night in
Memorial Hall on the topic "Eco
| nomic Problems of Our World."
"Western nations must either be
| come state operated and controlled
| or they must stage a rapid reversal
I from the principles of economics
| that have grown up in the past 25
I years," he added.
Changes Described
j Attributing recent economic de
j velopments to the World War, the
i British authority listed the three
I great changes since 1914:
"The world has become segment
! Ed, both politically and economical-
I ly. The economic trend has changed
to a narrow nationalism unlike
nineteenth century nationalism,
which was broad and contained
many good elements.
"Western nations have developed
widely different capitalistic systems,
though all nations, even Russia, are
essentially capitalistic."
Confine State
"Problem of who will run the eco
nomic machine in Great Britain and
the United States is still undecided.
State activities should be strictly
confined to certain basic fields,
leaving the breadth of economic ac
tivity to free capitalism."
"Germany and Russia," he con
tinued, "have passed each other go
ing in opposite directions'. Germany
is becoming more communistic,
while Russia is becoming more fas
cist."
Mr. Hutton was introduced by
Edgar Eugene Robinson, professor
of American history, and acting
president of- the University.
