### 
Announcement of Ex Committee's
approval of plans to hold a dance on
the Memorial Theater stage after the
presentation of "Blue Jeans" next
Saturday night was made yesterday
by Dramatic Manager Clay Mc-
Daniel.
Approval was also received from
Dean Mary Yost, who termed it an
excellent plan and one which should
add a great deal of pleasure for
theatergoers. It will be the first time
that such a dance has been held on
campus. Music will be furnished by
Les Smith's 11-piece orchestra, a
newcomer to the Farm.
A change in broadcast time of the
Stager's radio presentation of parts
of the first act of "Blue Jeans" from
7 o'clock tonight to 9:30 o'clock to
morrow night also was announced
by McDaniel. The change was
made owing to a conflicting broad
cast.
