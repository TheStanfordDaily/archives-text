# 'Kappa Sig Sleeping Beauty Awakes In Time For Chateau Toyon Formal
## 
### 
The entrance to Chateau Toyon
will be adorned Friday evening with
a semi-nude girl—or, rather, a mar
ble statue of one!
The 600-pound beauty has been
borrowed from the Kappa Sigs ex
pressly for the Toyon-Branner win
ter formal, which is to be held in
the Gold Room of Toyon Friday.
The history of the statue has not
been traced farther back than 15
years, at which time several Kappa
Sigs found it—where, nobody seems
to know. After keeping it under
' their porch for 10 years, probably to
i protect the maiden from strangers'
1 stares, it was brought up into the
I house and has since been kept in a
j closet.
i The girl is draped in ihe style of
I the ancient Greek goddesses—per

haps it has a story comparable to
lhat of the Winged Nike or Apollo
Belvedere. Made of white marble,
the maiden is about 4 feet 5 in
height, and acording to those who
have viewed her in her semi-nudity,
would look very well in a bathing
suit.
The "Marble Mystery" will be
placed in the center of the Toyon
courtyard, with spotlights placed
upon it in order to bring out all the
subtleties of its flowing and grace
ful lines. Friday evening will be
the Grecian maid's first public ap
pearance upon the Stanford campus.
According to recent reports, a move
ment is under way to make her the
Masque Hall Queen.
Adding to the feminine element it
the formal will be the vocalist sing

ing with Neil Bondshu's orchestra.
Although her name has not as yet
been divulged, the singer is reput
edly "the tops."
The "Gold Room" of Chateau
Toyon is being decorated in accord
ance with the theme, "Nobility."
Men will be presented with diplo
mats' scarves and women will be
given gardenia corsages to help
carry out the theme.
The formal Friday evening will at
tempt to bear out the tradition of
Toyon-Branner annual formals,
which, according to old timers on
the campus, are "the best dances of
ihe year. Bids to the dance are
available at the A.S.S.U. office, in
Room 302 of Branner Hall, and in
Room 248 of Toyon Hail. Tickets
are $n each.
