# Excom Plans Money Drive Amendment
## Committee Of Three Proposed To End Farm Fund Problem 
### 
A three-member committee with
a faculty adviser was tentatively set
up last night as Ex Committee's so
lution to the problem of campus
fund drives.
Final action is to be taken next
week after Dean Kirkwood* of the
Law School has had opportunity to
advise regarding phrasing of the
proposed by-law.
Under the proposed set-up, the
committee would approve or reject
all requests for drives. Its decision
would not take effect, however, un
til its minutes had been approved
by Ex Committee. All funds are to
pass through the A.S.S.U. organiza
tion fund.
Chief snag in the evening's discus
sion was the problem of how to
define a fund drive. "Any attempt
on the part of a campus organiza
tion to raise funds," was the sugges
tion of a sub-committee which gave
its report through John Cobbs.
Members Balk
Members balked at this definition
when they saw it included dough
nut sales, Chappie solicitations,
drama ticket sales, and Quad sub
scriptions. They saw themselves
swamped every week by requests
for activities that never have been
questioned.

One suggestion was that approval
would not be needed if the organiza
tion was selling something.
"Then they'd be around selling
Buck Club memberships and giving
you a picture of the football team
for your $s','" said Bob Garretson.
Doughnuts Discussed
According to John Dern, dough
nut sales are actually disguised
charity. Someone objected, holding
that you get value received.
Phil Klauber objected to the dis
cussion. "What are we attacking?"
lie queried. "Doughnut sales? Does
Miss Yost object to them?"
Because Farm hashers are not or
ganized and could not underwrite
their dance, Ex Committee post
poned until next week final decision
on their application for a closed
date April 22.
Plan Scholarship
The hashers are planning the
dance with the object of setting up
a hasher scholarship if they make
money, and of banding the hashers
together.
"They'll disband pretty fast if they
don't make money," said Fontius.
"I don't want to be mercenary about
this thing, but if they lose money
we'd pay the bills and hold the
sack."
Lyle Cook was named to the plan
ning committee for next spring's
leadership institute. Killefer held
up further appointments of men to
this committee until he finds who is
particularly interested.
Cook Named Head
Ex Committee okayed the results
of the second Men's Council elec
tion last Wednesday.
Ten dollars each was appropriated
for band stands, "so musicians won't
drop through next time they are
used."

ning committee for next spring's
leadership institute. Killefer held
up further appointments of men to
this committee until he finds who is
particularly interested.
Cook Named Head
Ex Committee okayed the results
of the second Men's Council elec
tion last Wednesday.
Ten dollars each was appropriated
for band stands, "so musicians won't
drop through next time they are
used."
Dates granted: Dramatic Council,
May 20, closed date, May 21, open
date, Feb. If); Senior class, April 1;
Phi Kappa Sigma. May 21; Fresh
man class, April 22.
A three-member committee with
a faculty adviser was tentatively set
up last night as Ex Committee's so
lution to the problem of campus
fund drives.
Final action is to be taken next
week after Dean Kirkwood* of the
Law School has had opportunity to
advise regarding phrasing of the
proposed by-law.
Under the proposed set-up, the
committee would approve or reject
all requests for drives. Its decision
would not take effect, however, un
til its minutes had been approved
by Ex Committee. All funds are to
pass through the A.S.S.U. organiza
tion fund.
Chief snag in the evening's discus
sion was the problem of how to
define a fund drive. "Any attempt
on the part of a campus organiza
tion to raise funds," was the sugges
tion of a sub-committee which gave
its report through John Cobbs.
Members Balk
Members balked at this definition
when they saw it included dough
nut sales, Chappie solicitations,
drama ticket sales, and Quad sub
scriptions. They saw themselves
swamped every week by requests
for activities that never have been
questioned.

One suggestion was that approval
would not be needed if the organiza
tion was selling something.
"Then they'd be around selling
Buck Club memberships and giving
you a picture of the football team
for your $s','" said Bob Garretson.
Doughnuts Discussed
According to John Dern, dough
nut sales are actually disguised
charity. Someone objected, holding
that you get value received.
Phil Klauber objected to the dis
cussion. "What are we attacking?"
lie queried. "Doughnut sales? Does
Miss Yost object to them?"
Because Farm hashers are not or
ganized and could not underwrite
their dance, Ex Committee post
poned until next week final decision
on their application for a closed
date April 22.
Plan Scholarship
The hashers are planning the
dance with the object of setting up
a hasher scholarship if they make
money, and of banding the hashers
together.
"They'll disband pretty fast if they
don't make money," said Fontius.
"I don't want to be mercenary about
this thing, but if they lose money
we'd pay the bills and hold the
sack."
Lyle Cook was named to the plan
ning committee for next spring's
