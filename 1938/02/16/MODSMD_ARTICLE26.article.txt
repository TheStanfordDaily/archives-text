CHENGCHOW, Feb. 15 (UP). —
Japan's bombing planes spread
death and terror over the Yellow
River Valley today, after bombing
at least one American mission dur
ing a savage drive to smash Chinese
resistance in North China.
Chinese rushed reinforcements up
the Hankow Railroad, pouring men
and munitions into this key point
in a desperate effort to plug the
new Japanese advance which has
switched westward to a direct drive
on Hankow.

It was increasingly evident that
one of the great battles of the war
would be fought in this Honan
countryside.
The Japanese bombing squadron
roared over Chengchow, unloading
tons of explosives on the rail head
and hitting the American Southern
Baptist Mission here. Four Chinese
were injured by shrapnel. The
planes bombed the mission three
times, but no foreigners were hurt.
Reports received at the Chinese
military headquarters here said
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had
dispatched 20,000 additional Chinese
trops to Hofei, on the Hankow rail
road.
New China Force
Other Chinese reports said the
Central Government was organizing
"ten new armies totalling 500,000
Soviet trained men, equipped for
guerilla tactics" and that an "addi
tional 700,000 men, including many
women figh'ters," was in training in
Kwangsi Province, former Red
Army headquarters.
It was believed the Japanese mili
tary command may have abandoned
its effort to capture Suchow, key
city to the east of Chengchow, and
is now concentrating on attacks on
the Peiping-Hankow railroad, pre
sumably to pave the way for a
dire f thrust at Hankow.
Statistics taken by the University
of Wisconsin show that 18 is the
average age at which students en
