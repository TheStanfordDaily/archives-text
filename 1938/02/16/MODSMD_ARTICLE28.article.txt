# Behind The Row Paddle
## 
### DICK DUDMAN 
You may never have heard of
Jules Grittner, but if you're a fra
ternity man chances are you've had
to bend over and be whammed by
one of his paddles.
In his corner of the woodworking
shop in the Corporation Yard, Mr.
Grittner has for 11 years made pad
dles for initiations—3oo per year is
his estimate.
Faced by orders for many types,
he keeps samples on hand and likes
to show them to people. They range
from short, stubby ones to a 30-inch
number. And one year he came out
with a paddle the shape of an
elongated block S.
"They didn't like that one," he
says. "It must mave broken too
easily."
Once he helped out a fellow who
asked for a nice soft paddle.
"I cut one out of lightweight in
sulating material and sent him over
to the paint shop. When it was fin
ished it looked just like the wooden
duplicate we made. I've always
wanted to know what happened—it
probably broke with the first swat

—but he never came around aeain."
Fixing broken University cnairs
is about the only other work Mr.
Grittner does. Every two months
a load of two dozen Encina chairs
are brought to him lor repair, their
legs kicked out, rungs broken, or
backs torn off.
He keeps track of the time and
charges it to the breakage fee un
less they have caught some parti
cular freshman committing the de
struction.
"The Roble girls break quite a
few," says Mr. Grittner, "but there's
no comparison with Encina."
Every year, Encin? Big Game en
thusiasts kick out ballisters to de
fend the bonfire, and this keeps Mr.
Grittner busy for a week or two. He
turns out hundreds of spare up

rights to replace the fragile, ornate
ones that have been broken.
"The turned ones were a fizzle,"
he says proudly, "but with my IV2-
inch oak ballisters they have a hard
time kicking them out."
