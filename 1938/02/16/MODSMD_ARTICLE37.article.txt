Torn Montgomery has been doing
surprising things with the 16-pound
shot these days, and il Dink Temple
ton doesn't look sharp he'll have a
shot putter on his hands who can
really put the shot.
Monty takes plenty of ribbing
about bis beautiful physique antl
stuff, but hist the same he's do
ing all right with the shot. No
body has the laugh 011 him there,
lie has been averaging about 51
feet in practice, and has bad seven
or eight puts over 52 feet. The
last real put he made was Satur
day, at 52-2.
The weightmen are the only track
men who have been able to do any
practicing in the rainy weather of
the past three weeks, but even at
that the season for them is very
young. With Montgomery doing 52
feel now, there is a good chance that
he'll crock 54 before the season is
over.
Jack Lipman is another shot
putter who has been doing things
out of the ordinary, but coming
up from nowhere to threaten him
as second best is the football
comic Jack Walton. Old Binllegs,
not a man you would call frail,
has been able to put some of that
beef into the art of shot-putting
with better than ordinary results.
He's strong enough to put the
thing 60 feet, like lots of other
weightmen, so he has nothing to
worry about on that score. If he
can learn the tricks that Johnny
Lyman knew he'll be o.k. At pres
ent his best mark is allegedly around
48 feet, good enough for any begin
ner.
Coach Dink Templeton has en
tered 35 men in the P.A.A. indoor
meet in San Francisco Saturday
night. Walton and Montgomery
among them. Carl Mahurin, half
miler, is also entered, but it is
doubtful if he will run. He's still
having trouble with his foot.
In a way, this rain might turn out
to be a blessing to Coach Harry
Dolter's baseball team. Since one
conference game (Santa Clara) has
been postponed already, it means
that there will probably be a double
header the next time Stanford and
Santa Clara have a game scheduled.
Now, Stanford, with three pitch
ers who are almost even in ability,
will have the edge over virtually
every other team in the C.1.8.A.,
for none of the others has more
than one good pitcher. For Stan
ford, Furman. Hamilton, and Laz
zarone are almost squared off,
with Furman having only a slight
edge. All other league teams have
but a single strong pitcher, if
they have any at all. None can
boats of a three-strong battery.
In the event of a double header,
Stanford can use one man the first
game, and then have a man to take
his place the next game who is just
as good. The other outfits can have
a good pitcher only one-half of a
double header.
Let's hope for more rain.
Coach John Bunn used just six
men in the U.S.C. series in Los
Angele."—the starting five and
Nellie Heath. Calderwood, Lee.
Zonne, Luisetti, and Stoefen
played the entire first game, and
then played most of the second
without a break.
Calderwood was replaced by
Heath late in the sccond game, and
Coach Bunn says he would have
kept right on using him if il hadn't
been for one thing—Spook went out
on four personals.
In regard to the basketball situ
ation in general, some of the Stan
ford players talked with Trojans
after the game Saturday night, and
found that the U.S.C. team is
champing to get hold of the Cali
fornia Bears again, this time in
Los Angeles.
Cal plays here this week-end, and
next week-end goes south for the
last two games with U.S.C. Troy,
the players claimed, was not so hot
on the* trail of Stanford as might be
expected, but those two slim lick
ings the Barrymen took from Cal
at Berkeley got under their skin.
California is going to have its
hands full next week, while Stan
ford should have a fairly easy time
with U.C.L.A. in the Pavilion. Cal
has by far the tougher schedule for
the last four games, and Stanford,
despite the fact that Cal still leads
by a full game, is at this point in the
commanding position.—Peterson.
