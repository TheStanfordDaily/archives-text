# Varsity Set For Spartan Nine Today
## Indians Will Play Two Practice Games Before Moraga Tilt 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter kept his fin
gers crossed yesterday hoping that
the let-up in the rainy weather
which has forced postponement of
Stanford's last four baseball games
would last long enough for his team
to go through with its two scheduled
practice games this week.
Rained out of their opening C.I.
B.A. game last Saturday against the
Santa Clara Broncos at Santa Clara,
the Indians will play two non-con
ference games, one today cjnd one
Saturday, before tangling with St.
Mary's a week from today on the
Sunken Diamond in their first
league tilt.
Today Coach Gil Bishop brings
a strong aggregation of San Jose
State horsehiders up to the Farm
for their first test of the season.
State Team Strong
The Bulldogs, due to the rainy
weather, haven't been able to show
their potentiality yet this year, but
are looking forward to one of their
best diamond seasons in history
starting today.
Bishop will probably start a vet
eran team composed of lettermen at
every position with the exception of
catcher. Art Carpenter will take the
mound against the Indians and Bill
Gurnea, a sophomore, will receive.
The rest of the team will be Cap
tain Walt McPherson, first base;
Jim Cranford, second base; Jack
Riordan, shortstop; Jim Luque,
third base; Tony Martinez, George
Haney, Haven Smith, outfielders.
Stanford Lineup
Harry Wolter has not named the
opening lineup for the Indians, but
except for Captain George Farrell
at third base, he will probably start
the same team that opened the first
two practice games. Farrell pulled
an abdominal muscle and will be
out for two weeks.
Tom Killefer and Jim Graham will
share the first base spot; Dale Rei
mer and Dick Tam at second; Dick
Shortall at shortstop; Pete Mac-
Arthur probably in place of Far
rell at third. Spike Furman, Glenn
Hamilton, and A1 Lazzarone will
toil three innings apiece on the
mound with Sid Lewis and Bill
Jamison dividing the catching du
ties.
Jimmy Coffis, Wally de Witt, Dick
La Franchi. Norm Juney, Bob Mat
thews, and Bob McGuire should see
service in the outfield.

a strong aggregation of San Jose
State horsehiders up to the Farm
for their first test of the season.
State Team Strong
The Bulldogs, due to the rainy
weather, haven't been able to show
their potentiality yet this year, but
are looking forward to one of their
best diamond seasons in history
starting today.
Bishop will probably start a vet
eran team composed of lettermen at
every position with the exception of
catcher. Art Carpenter will take the
mound against the Indians and Bill
Gurnea, a sophomore, will receive.
The rest of the team will be Cap
tain Walt McPherson, first base;
Jim Cranford, second base; Jack
Riordan, shortstop; Jim Luque,
third base; Tony Martinez, George
Haney, Haven Smith, outfielders.
Stanford Lineup
Harry Wolter has not named the
opening lineup for the Indians, but
except for Captain George Farrell
at third base, he will probably start
the same team that opened the first
two practice games. Farrell pulled
an abdominal muscle and will be
out for two weeks.
Tom Killefer and Jim Graham will
share the first base spot; Dale Rei
mer and Dick Tam at second; Dick
Shortall at shortstop; Pete Mac-
Arthur probably in place of Far
rell at third. Spike Furman, Glenn
Hamilton, and A1 Lazzarone will
toil three innings apiece on the
mound with Sid Lewis and Bill
Jamison dividing the catching du
ties.
Jimmy Coffis, Wally de Witt, Dick
La Franchi. Norm Juney, Bob Mat
thews, and Bob McGuire should see
service in the outfield.
