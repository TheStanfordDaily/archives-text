## 
### 
When old man Sol peered through the clouds yesterday after two
weeks ol seclusion, Stanford's varsity golfers grabbed their clubs and
dashed out to the Stanford Golf Course to put the finishing touches 011
their strokes in preparation for the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Cham
pionships over the week-end at Pebble Beach.
A qualifying round of IS holes will be played Friday morning and the

64 lowest qualifiers will play the*
! first round of match play Friday
! afternoon. Second and third round
matches are scheduled for Saturday
with the 36-hole finals set for Sun-*-
day.
Loyola Favored
Pre-tournament odds favor Loy
ola's Roger Kelly, present title
holder and California state cham
pion, to retain his crown won last
year on the same course. However,
entries include the cream of col
legiate golfers from Canada to Mex
ico and any number of them are
considered capable of lifting Kelly
from the throne.
The leading threats to Kelly's title
i are Carl Jonson of Washington, one
; of the best players in the Northwest;
Sylvester Stimac jf California, and
Bob McGlashan of U.S.F.. both well
known in Northern California
j tournaments.
Many Card Entries
Stanford will present a host of
j entries all of whom will be definite
| threats and may even end up by
playing off the last rounds them
selves, according to the experts.
At the No. 1 spot for the Stanford
ites will be Art Doering, who has
| been turning in low cards in local
I tournaments recently and was
j named for the six-man All-Col
legiate golf team last year. Doering
indicated that he was roady Sunday
j when he loured the last round of
I the National Match Play Open in a
j 68 to take Ihe amateur honors.
Brown Cannon, well-known in
, Rocky Mountain golf circles, Jimmy
Rea and Alan Hyman, semi-finalist
! last year, will also be contenders for
j the Indians. Jack Wallace, medal
ist and runner-up to Kelly last year,
broke a wrist several weeks ago and
will not enter.
