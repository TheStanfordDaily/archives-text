# Bunn Devises New 'Wrinkle'
## Indians Will 'Gang Up' on Bear Defenders 
### 
Coach John Bunn devised a new
wrinkle in the art of penetrating the
stout California defense over the
week-end, and after trying it out on
his seconds Monday afternoon it
loked so good that he gave it to the
first string yesterday.
The new wrinkle is strictly con
fidential, ostensibly, even though
the Pavilion practices are wide open
every day, and Coach Bunn threat
ens mayhem to the "slug" who spills
the dope on how it works.
However, it won't be saying any
thing out of turn by declaring that
the new play is a sort of a double
barrelled affair that ought to be
declared unfair by the hoopster's
union because it constitutes ganging
tip two offensive men on one de
fensive man. If the thing works it's
going to tear the Bear defense
asunder.
Because they are in good physical
condition, Coach Bunn isn't giving
the players any hard work this
week, concentrating on tuning up
the Crusher on the fine points. To
day's workout will be the last be
fore the game Friday night.
Analogously, the Associated Press
announced its all-time All-America
basketball team yesterday, naming
Captain Frank Luisetti dt Stanford
at one forward. With Luisetti were
named Chuck Hyatt, Pittsburg ace
of 10 years ago, forward; Forrest Di-
Bernardi, former Kansas and West
minster College star, center; and
Johnny Wooden, and Don White of
Purdue, guards.
