# Cracking the Shell
## 
### 
TN THE eyes of Dr. D. Elton Trueblood last
1 spring, after one year here, Stanford's great
est defect was the intense provincialism and the
intellectual immaturity of its student body.
Today, as he is making plans for his first
furlough from the campus in two years, the
chaplain has come to the conclusion that Stan
ford's apparent apathy to local and world af
fairs is only surface. What is really lacking,
he believes, is a technique for quickening latent
intellectual curiosity. The exposure of Stanford
to ideas and personalities through his Luncheon
Club is his first effort to develop such a tech
nique.
Yet Luncheon Club entertains only 100 out of
4000; and of those 100, only a small percentage
may really come away with something alto
gether new. To the rest, the meeting will have
brought comments, suggestions, criticisms, but
little in the way of real ideas. We wonder if
Dr. Trueblood is not mistaking the part—the 100
who attend the Wednesday meetings—for the
whole.
Bull-sessions will testify that, individually,
Stanford is capable and willing to consider new
ideas. But collectively, Stanford builds a shell
of provincialism which is almost impossible to
crack.
The philosopher who could solve the secret
of this mass retreat into a turtle-shell of intel
lectual self-sufficiency would be hailed as a
second Plato. If Dr. Trueblood can devise a
technique to convince Stanford that this self
sufficiency springs from a smug unconscious
ness of something outside its mental bounda
ries, he will have a first leg on the award for
such a feat.
Successful as Luncheon Club has been, it is
a small nick on the hard coating of provincial
ism. External prods such as these may sting the
hides of a few Stanford men and women,
but unfortunately it is hardly enough to war
rant even a scratch from the many.—J. S.
