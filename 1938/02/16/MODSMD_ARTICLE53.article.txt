LAST Monday when The Daily made a quick
excursion into the realms of philosophy,
discussing the idea that universities have lost
sight of their purpose, Stanford's reaction curve
looked like the ones psychologists get when
the white rats have an off day.
The editorial in question considered the the
ory that colleges no longer work to educate
students, that instead they work to glorify a
"spirit of the university." It suggested that per
haps we have set up a detached entity, separate
from students, faculty, and campus, which we
consider more important than any of these.
Student reaction to this theory presented an
assortment of variations. Probably the ma
jority of the undergraduates went back to the
cross-word puzzle without thinking anything.
But some of them delayed long enough to ask,
"What gave you that notion?"
First impressions to the contrary, the idea has
a good deal of evidence behind it.
Exhibit A might be the modern stress on
graduate schools. The mass of the student body
consists of undergraduates; and it is undergrad
uate tuition fees that keep dear alma mater
from being put out into the street. But all the

emphasis is placed on graduate schools. They
get the attention and the appropriations. Per
haps this is an indication of growing demand
for more advanced training. Perhaps it results
from the fact that when universities are rated,
graduate schools are one of the most important
factors in putting hated Siwash over our own
dear intellectual step-mother.
There is also the often-remarked tendency to
promote professors according to the number
of times they crash into print, not according to
the number of students they teach. The scarred
veteran of literary wars may mumble into the
blackboard and leave the class blanketed in
fog; but he seems to be the one who gets pro
motion.
Another interesting sidelight comes from
Stanford herself. Last guarter we were told that
the library, the only guiet place on the cam
pus, was not intended to be used for study.
The opinion of many college administrations,
ruffled by undergraduate demands, seems to
be, "God! Is this university being run for the
students?"
This attitude isn't particularly bad in itself.
Perhaps it is better to run an organization for
the glory of a concept than for the good of in
dividuals. Perhaps it is better to make a "finer
university" than it is to turn out a finer group
of graduates.
But it isn't exactly fair to the students to make
the ideal of a finer university something sepa
rate from the ideal of turning out better men.
Undergraduates put in four years of hard work,
and they spend a considerable amount of
money. They don't do it for the glory of a
concept. They do it because they are promised
something out of it.
And our egotism makes it rather hard for us
to subordinate ourselves to an intangible some
thing that we believe doesn't exist.
And so we also ask, "God! Is the university
being run for the students?"—J. C.

The editorial in question considered the the
ory that colleges no longer work to educate
students, that instead they work to glorify a
"spirit of the university." It suggested that per
haps we have set up a detached entity, separate
from students, faculty, and campus, which we
consider more important than any of these.
Student reaction to this theory presented an
assortment of variations. Probably the ma
jority of the undergraduates went back to the
cross-word puzzle without thinking anything.
But some of them delayed long enough to ask,
"What gave you that notion?"
First impressions to the contrary, the idea has
a good deal of evidence behind it.
Exhibit A might be the modern stress on
graduate schools. The mass of the student body
consists of undergraduates; and it is undergrad
uate tuition fees that keep dear alma mater
from being put out into the street. But all the

emphasis is placed on graduate schools. They
get the attention and the appropriations. Per
haps this is an indication of growing demand
for more advanced training. Perhaps it results
from the fact that when universities are rated,
graduate schools are one of the most important
factors in putting hated Siwash over our own
dear intellectual step-mother.
There is also the often-remarked tendency to
promote professors according to the number
of times they crash into print, not according to
the number of students they teach. The scarred
veteran of literary wars may mumble into the
blackboard and leave the class blanketed in
fog; but he seems to be the one who gets pro
motion.
Another interesting sidelight comes from
Stanford herself. Last guarter we were told that
the library, the only guiet place on the cam
pus, was not intended to be used for study.
The opinion of many college administrations,
ruffled by undergraduate demands, seems to
be, "God! Is this university being run for the
students?"
This attitude isn't particularly bad in itself.
Perhaps it is better to run an organization for
the glory of a concept than for the good of in
dividuals. Perhaps it is better to make a "finer
university" than it is to turn out a finer group
of graduates.
But it isn't exactly fair to the students to make
the ideal of a finer university something sepa
rate from the ideal of turning out better men.
Undergraduates put in four years of hard work,
and they spend a considerable amount of
money. They don't do it for the glory of a
concept. They do it because they are promised
something out of it.
And our egotism makes it rather hard for us
to subordinate ourselves to an intangible some
thing that we believe doesn't exist.
And so we also ask, "God! Is the university
being run for the students?"—J. C.
LAST Monday when The Daily made a quick
excursion into the realms of philosophy,
discussing the idea that universities have lost
sight of their purpose, Stanford's reaction curve
looked like the ones psychologists get when
the white rats have an off day.
