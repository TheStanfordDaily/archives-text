# BULL SESSION
## RADIO HOUR 
### 
OEGULARLY each Monday evening Stanford takes
over KGO for 15 minutes and broadcasts to the
world some item of information gleaned from the
minds of its faculty.
One week it is telling us about aboriginal Indians;
the next we are given a lively discussion of the art of
furniture-making. Week in, week out, the University
fulfills its function as a disseminator of knowledge by
disseminating' knowledge of supreme unimportance
to practically everybody.
Not that the Radio Hour does not occasionally pro
duce something worth listening to. Dr. Shepard's talk
on student health service certainly struck close to
home; and there have been a few others which merited
equal attention.
But on the whole, the Stanford Radio Hour has
served only to fill in time, and pretty boring time at
that. Supposedly established to present interesting in
formation, it succeeds only in making most listeners
reach for the dial and switch to something else.
/CONSIDERING the excellence of some university
radio hours, this seems a regrettable state of af
fairs. Those who have listened to Chicago's excellent
professorial bull-sessions on Sunday mornings must
sometimes wonder why the Farm cannot provide some
thing equally as vital, as interesting and as valuable.
It may be that the University cannot afford to buy
the time necessary for a really good three-man dis
cussion of some current problem. But increased lis
tener-response might make possible some arrange
ment with the station whereby some of the time would
be free, or by which the over-all rate would be re
duced.
In any case, some arrangement could undoubtedly
be worked out, and the result would do much for the
University, both in prestige and in its increased ability
to present live-wire slants on current events.
Meaning no disrespect to the many faculty-mem
bers who have made use of the Radio Hour, they do
seem to be talking to exclusive groups on exclusive
subjects rather than to the general public on subjects
of interest to it.
"Flower Arrangement in Old Japan" is probably
very nice; but one doubts whether it could match in
interest a Fagin-Boggs-Stuart discussion of Hitler's
economic policy.—Allen Drury.
