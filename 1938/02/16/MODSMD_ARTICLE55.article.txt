# Another Man's View
## TO AN UNKNOWN JAPANESE 
### 
One of these days I shall kill you. I do not yet
know how it will happen or when. Perhaps it will be
in a muddy diteh in north China with the cold rain
pouring down, a ditch that I shall try to take from you
or you from me—even though neither of us wants it!
Perhaps you will die by a shell, a huge. 2000-pound
shell, which I shall send hurtling from one of our new
$70,000,000 battleships. Perhaps I shall fly over from
our Alaskan air base and blow you to pieces as you
sleep. Perhaps I shall rip out your guts on some south
Pacific island that neither you nor I have ever seen
before.
I do not want to kill you, hut I shall have no choice.
I live with people who are afraid of you, just as you
live with some who are afraid of me. And because
my people are afraid they are building warships and
making rifles and sharpening bayonets and filling
bombs and compounding gas to defend themselves
igainst their fear.
* « * *
When people arc afraid they hate ca.-ily. One day
my people will say out of their hate and fear: "The
Japanese would destroy us. We must destroy them
first." Then I shall be given a gun or a ship or a bomb
and be sent out to kill you.
I must tell von now, while I am still allowed to
write to you, that I shall kill you against my will. So,
when my cold steel slices into your belly, or when my
bullet tears away your face, or when you hear the mid
night drone of my plane above your home, know that
I come not in hatred but in sorrow and that in de
stroying you I am also destroying myself.
I'ntil our meeting. linn. | wish you peace.
