# Gershwin Play Wins First Night Acclaim
## 
### 
The San Francisco opening of the
late George Gershwin's "Poigy and
Bess," at the Curran this week, was
both an artistic and an audience
success. Topped with y curtain
speech by Director Ruben Mamou
lian, it was a tribute to the talent
of the negro race as well as to the
music its lepresentatives sang on
the stage.
Working, with one exception, with
the original New York cast, Mr.
Mamoulian has produced the best
directed production seen in San
Francisco for some time. Tod Dun
can as the crippled Porgy lies on
his back in the middle of the stage
singing a chorus of "I Got Plenty
of Nuttin'" as the curtain comes
down and creates one of the most
effective scenes of the evening.
But you can't say that only one
of them was effective. The actors
never slowed their pace. Though
the audience broke in with applause,
continuity was held on the stage un
til the house was quiet and the
next number started. Rhythmic
scenes, characteristic of the negroes,
were impressive, particularly the
start of an early morning scene in
which sweepers, shoe-shiners, shoe
repairers, knife sharpeners, and
other sound effects were used.
"Summertime" was probably the
most effective song, coming as it did
at the opening of the folk opera.
With members of (he cast grouped
about her and a dark stage behind,
Maria sang this number.
"Bess, You Is My Woman, Now"
and "I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'" re
ceived their share of appreciation
from the first night audience.
Probably most interested of all was
Mr. Mamoulian, who worried
through the whole performance on
the edge of his chair.
As a ti'ibute to Gershwin, the au
dience stood in response to Mr.
Mamoulian's speech for the last
chorus, repeated after the curtain.
