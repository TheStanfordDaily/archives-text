# CAMPUS OPINION
## ALWARD ROASTED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I would like to correct an un
j warranted statement made by your
j movie reviewer. In Monday's re
| view of '"The Kid Comes Back,'' he
: had no justification in saying:
"Wayne Morris hasn't improved
| much."
Morris couldn't have improved in
| this film, because this was his first
; picture except for a few previous
bit parts. It was made over a year
j ago, months before Morris' first big
hit, "Kid Galahad." and then with-
I held from the public because of
: similarity to the then-forthcoming
i "Galahad."
Even so, the New York critics
praised Morris' performance in
i "The Kid Comes Back" wUen it
I opened there last week.
