# ROBLE ON WAYNE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We Roble fans of Wayne Morris
are indignant at the "slam" Alward
cast at Wayne in his review of "The
Kid Comes Back."
How could Morris have improved
in this picture, when he never played
in a picture before this? If Alward
had read Time Magazine this week,
he would have discovered that this
picture was the first one in which
Mr. Morris appeared, and was made
at the beginning of last year, long
before "Kid Galahad," "Submarine
D-l," and "Love, Honor, and Be
have," in each of which Mr. Morris
has at least, shall we say, "improved
considerably"!
In future Mr. Alward had better
read up on his movie stars before
he attempts to criticize them.

Coyotes follow badgers around

squirrels for them.
More disability is caused by rheu
