# Forgotten Pens Cry For Owners
## 
### 
"We are lost!"â€”not, as one would
imagine, the tearful utterances of
the Babes in the Woods, but merely
the pleading caption hung over
'luee forlorn looking fountain pens
in the Cellar. These pens, which
hang dejectedly by their clips from
a shelf behind the counter, repre
sent the dozens of others equally
"lest' which clutter up numerous
diawers and boxes in the Account
ing Department office and in the
A.S.S.U. office.
One would imagine, after pawing
through piles of various and sundry
articles, that the loss of a fountain
pen or wrist watch is a more or less
insignificant matter. Then, there
i-. the person, who may or may not
be making his 8 o'clocks on time,
but whose alarm clock reposes use
lessly with keys, purses, and an
overcoat in the A.S.S.U. office.
