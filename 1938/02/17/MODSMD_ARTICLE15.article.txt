# Officer's Coyots Free From Rabies
## 
### 
Officers Gordy Davis disclosed
that the head of the wild coyote he
killed in front of Professor Cottrell's
home on Coronado Avenue several
days ago had been under examina
tion in a Berkeley laboratory as a
possible case of rabies. The diag
nosis proved that the animal defi
nitely did not have the disease.
According to Davis, he was sum
moned to Professor Cottrell's home
after residents of the neighborhood
had complained that a coyote had
been prowling about for some time.
Davis shot the animal as it emerged
from a clump of bushes near the
home.
