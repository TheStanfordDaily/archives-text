# Women Given Holiday Leaves
## Council Grants Non-Quota 2:30's 
### 
Women's Council will grant all
women on Campus non-quota 2:30
leaves for next Monday night, which
precedes Washington's Birthday, an
all-University holiday. According
to precedent women are always
given special leaves before a Cam
pus holiday.
Women who wish to use the 2:30
as an overnight should apply to a
member of Council. Overnights will
not be granted without a valid ex
cuse, according to Carolyn Hibbard,
council chairman. Seniors with an
average of C or more need not ap
ply for permission to take an over
night Monday night.
Leaves taken Friday and Saturday
nights will be counted on the wom
en's regular quotas. Sophomore,
junior, and senior women may take
overnights Sunday night without
permission, but freshmen must ap
ply to Council. Halls and houses
will close at 10:30 as usual on Tues
i day night, and no special leaves will
j be granted.
Since Monday is not a holiday and
i classes will be held as usual Carolyn
Hibbard, council chairman, asks
I that all women cooperate with the
â–  University by remaining on Campus
i and not applying for special leaves
t unless it is absolutely necessary.
