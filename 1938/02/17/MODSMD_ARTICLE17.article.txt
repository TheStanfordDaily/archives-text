# 'Blue Jeans' Air Preview Cancelled
## KQW Says Play 'Too Controversial' For Radio Audience 
### 
Because they considered it "too
controversial for radio presentat
ion," officials of station KQW in San
Jose yesterday cancelled the broad
cast of the first act of "Blue Jeans,"
which had been scheduled for 9:30
o'clock tonight.
Asked to comment on the station's
refusal to air his play, Martin Flav
in, author and director, remarked,
"You may quote me as saying that
any statement I would care to make
would be unprintable."
The fact that radio stations reach
people of all social and political be
liefs, and must, therefore, be care
ful in the selection of their pro
grams was given by KQW's pro
gram director as reason for the re
fusal. This is especially true where
subjects dealing with strike, Com
munism, and the administration are
concerned.
Furthermore, KQW serves an
audience living near Salinas, sup
posed true locale of the play, mak
ing the possibility of objections from
Salinas Valley residents too gx-eat
to permit broadcast, station spokes
men said.
Originally, the air preview of
"Blue Jeans" was slated for pro
duction last Tuesday night. Studio
officials changed the time to Wednes
day night at 7 o'clock. Phoning
Clay McDaniel, dramatic manager,
station directors transferred the
broadcast to Thursday night, at 9:30
o'clock, requesting a copy of the
script to read. After they had con
sidered the theme of the play, its
lines and situations, they judged it
"too controversial" for release over
local air-lanes.
"Blue Jeans" will receive its pre
miere in Memorial Hall Saturday
night. Following the program, a
dance will be held on stage.
