# Underwood Gets Council Position
## 
### 
Bob Underwood yesterday was
chosen secretary of Men's Council
at the first meeting since the elec
tion. Varsity tennis captain and
member of Phi Phi, senior hon
orary society, he is serving his first
term on council, succeeding Dave
Rider, holdover member, at the
post.
Only routine parking and traffic
tickets came before the meeting
for consideration. The majority of
these parking tickets had been given
for parking at the turning base in
front of Memorial Auditorium.
Twice a member of the council,
Rider yesterday expressed the feel
ings of the council in this matter:
"Although no signs can be put up
warning students against parking in
the turning base, offenders have
been warned time and again about
it. Council, in leaving it up to the
students themselves, must continue
giving tickets until the Auditorium
turning base is free from cars."
