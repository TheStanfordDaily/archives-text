# Tennis Court Money Granted
## B.A.C. Okays Long Beach Track Meet 
### 
Money for three new tennis courts
was appropriated last night by the
Board of Athletic Control. To be
built of reinforced concrete, the
courts will cost an estimated $9000.
Details of construction were left
to Graduate Manager Alfred Mas
ters after he had told the board that
painting difficulties might keep the
courts from use this season.
With the approved type of stain,
Mr. Masters told the board, the
courts could not be used until 90
days after being painted. The board
left to him the problem whether to
use the courts without stain during
spring, or to delay construction en
tirely until after spring quarter.
Stanford's track team will be rep
resented at the Long Beach relays
this spring, the board decided, ap
propriating $500 for the trip.
If other southern universities
agree, Stanford is willing to enter a
four-year round robin football game
agreement with the conference's
frozen-out schools, Idaho and Mon
tana. The arrangement would be
for each of the schools to play at
Palo Alto once in four years. Sched
uled in open dates on projected pro
grams, games would be in alternate
years.
The board appropriated $100 for
a John Elliott memorial trophy,
matching a similar grant from Cali
fornia. Other funds for the trophy,
which will be a perpetual award to
the winner of the annual Big Meet,
are being raised by subscription*
