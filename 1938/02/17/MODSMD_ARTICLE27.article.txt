# All Seats Sold For Concert Series Program
## Anderson To Draw Record Audience For First Sell-Out 
### 
A complete sell-out for the Con
cert Series presentation of Marion i
Anderson, noted Negro contralto, j
was reported last night by Virginia |
Smith, Concert Series manager. J
Seats placed in the orchestra pit to !
enlarge seating capacity of the hall j
were also completely taken, she re- I
ported.
This is the first sell-out which |
Concert Series has had since it j
moved into its new Memorial Hall j
quarters last fall. Records show
that it is also one of the earliest
sell-outs for any Concert Series J
program.
Always a great drawing card since j
she won world recognition by win- !
ning the New York Philharmonic j
contest in 1925, Miks Anderson will j
present a varied program of Negro J
spirituals and Schubert Lieder.
The world-famous contralto will
appear at Stanford on her third
transcontinental tour on Feb. 24.
She Ms sung throughout the United
Stat , and has toured Europe and
South America during the past sev
eral years.
Born in Philadelphia, Miss An
derson first began singing when
Baptist Church parishioners took up j
a collection for lessons from Gui
seppa Boghetti, her teacher at the j
present time.
According to "Virginia Smith, no
standing room tickets will be sold
for the concert.
