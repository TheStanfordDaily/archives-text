## 
### 

PREMIER MUSSOLINI was so impressed by the army goosestep when
he visited Germany recently that he lias had it adopted in moderation
by the Italian Black Shirts. During a review in Rome he leaped from
his horse and himself goosestepped at the head of the column, as
shown. 11 Duce calls it the "passo Romano" or Roman step.
