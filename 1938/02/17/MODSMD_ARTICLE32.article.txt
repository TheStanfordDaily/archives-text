# War Office Honors Farm Army Aviator

Homer Boushey, unlike the usual
Stanford senior, has a commission
in the U. S. Army Air' Corps. Or,
unlike the usual Army Air Corps
commissioned officer, he is a senior
at Stanford.
Exceptional as that double para
dox is, more unusual is the fact
that two weeks ago he got the Dis
tinguished Flying Cross from the
War Department.
"I got it when I was testing new
Army planes for altitude up in
Washington a couple of weeks ago,"
he said.
"I was up in the air about 12,000
feet over Mt. Rainier when the aile
rons of my plane were torn off. That
meant I had control neither over my
direction, nor over the equilibrium
of my wings.
"The radio operator bailed out,
but I figured 12,000 feet was a long
way to fall — particularly when
you're going to land on a bunch of
trees, so I decided to stay with the
plane awhile.
"I got so I could juggle the con
trols enough to go pretty much
tvhere I wanted to, so I went to the
field. On the second try at it, I
made it."
Two planes have crashed back
East recently from the same cause
—ailerons being torn off. Boushey
got the cross for bringing the plane
safely down and enabling the Army
to find out the cause of the mis
haps, to find out that it was the
ailerons causing the wrecks.
"The first I knew about the
award," he said, "was when I read a
small paragraph about it on the
financial page of the Chronicle last
week."
Boushey came here with the class
of "33. He is in his fourth year of
undergraduate engineering work
now. Aside from his work in the
university, he is connected with
Moffet Field.

"It sounds like an old plug," he
says, "but now the Army needs
men in its Air Corps. It's been said
before, but there's a very good
chance for college men to get in
right now, too."
The whole business is that the
Army is building a lot of planes and
if they don't fill up the Air Corps
they'll have more planes than men.
Bouahey is interested in helping
college students get in the corps.
Anyone between the ages of 20 and
27. unmarried* who can pass the
physical exam is eligible.
The men accepted go through a
year of training with pay; then they
get second lieutenant commissions
in the reserve Army Air Corps, and
$200 a month.. At any time when
they have that job, they can try for
a competitive commission in the
regular Air Corps.
"That's how I got in," Boushey
explained. "And anyone interested
in information about entering the
service can get in touch with me
any time at Moffet Field, or at the
Alpha Delt house during lunch."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UP).—

plished the second major objective

trol bill.
