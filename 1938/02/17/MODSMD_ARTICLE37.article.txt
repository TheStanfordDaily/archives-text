—(UP). —Jack Fryc, president of

cial plane will drop 3000 pounds
of food to more than 400 ma
rooned men, women and children
in the snowbound area near Ta
hoe City, Cal.

TAHOE CITY. Feb. 16 (UP).—
An entire settlement of marooned
resort residents and employees at
Glenbrook are subsisting on horse
meat because no other food is
available, it was reported today.
Nearly 400 other persons are ma
rooned at Tahoe City, Tulac, Emer
ald May, and Lake Forest also and
are in dire need of fresh foods.
Many are ill and in desperate need
of medical attention.
Supplies of vegetables, milk, but
ter, fruit, and eggs have been ex
hausted for several days and with
the exception of the people at
Glenbrook everyone in the area is
living on canned foods.
Most are not in desperate need of
food supplies as provisions on hand
will last several days, but there is
the constant danger of illness from
eating too much canned food, or
from exposure. It is bitterly cold,
but there is no prospect of further
snows in the immediate future.
