The varsity basketball team will
stay home next year, instead of
touring East as has been the case
for the past two seasons. That fact
is going to give the team a chance
to get in some games here during
the Christmas season with local tal
ent, and possibly some barnstorm
ing outfits.
Now, while the eastern tours are
very good advertising — when you
have a good team—they lessen the
opportunity to get in practice games
before conference play starts.
That is, it is not possible to play as
many games on a trip as when stay
ing at home.
Next year the team is to
he largely a green squad, as far as
tough, steady big time competition
is concerned. Phil Zonnc will
he the only seasoned player avail
able, although others like Tom
Siebert, Leon Lufaillc, and Derrol
Iluddlcson will have piled up a
little experience this year. It is
going to be necessary next year
to give the new hands as much ex
perience in starting games as pos
sible before the conference drive
starts.
For that reason, staying at home
and playing a fairly heavy practice
season is going to be a help to
next year's varsity.
In regard to the possibilities of in
tersectional tilts with teams travel
ing around, several schools have
been considered that plan to go on
the gravy circuit in 1938-39. Ne
braska and Michigan State are con
sidering sending hoop teams to this
coast. Columbia and Dartmouth are
both very anxious to open recipro
cal basketball competition with Stan
ford. Notre Dame, always popular
in this sector, would be a great at
traction but there is not much hope
that the South Bend squad will be
induced to come out.

The San Francisco fans have done
a lot of howling this season over the
fact that they can't get tickets to
the basketball games to see Hank
Luisetti play. They have been ask
ing through various spokesmen that,
for instance, a Stanford-Cal game
be moved to San Francisco's Civil
Auditorium so that some people be
sides the rooters can see the great
Luisetti play.
Mo.vt of those fans that pretend
they are being given unfair treat
ment are the fans that won't pay
more than four bits to see a bas
ketball game, anyway. They seem
to forget that Stanford played in
the Civic And against U.S.F. last
year, and that the And was just
about half full. To make it worse
that game was played for flood re
lief and should have had a smash
ing crowd.
They also seem to forget that
Stanford played Washington in the
coast title playoff two years ago in
the Civic And, and that place wasn't
filled to capacity then, either. In
both of those games Luisetti played
great ball—he played some of the
finest basketball he has ever shown
in the Washington game.
Not only that, but when Stanford
played U.S.F. a week and a half ago,
was the Pavilion filled to the capa
city that the Stanford-Cal games
show is possible? Not on your night
cap, and what's more Luisetti played
more than half of that game.
The whole thing eventually
comes down at last to the con
clusion that what the fans want to
see is a Stanford-Cal game equal
ly as much as they want to see
Luisetti. There is no doubt that
Luisetti in a Cal game has much
more attraction than he has in a
U.S.F. game, but that isn't because
he plays better basketball—it's
because the Stanford-Cal rivalry
affects the outside fans almost as
much as it gets the students.
Both Stanford and Cal are ob
viously going to make all they can
on gate receipts from their star
players, for it takes money to run
schools, and athletics are the most
popular commodity a school has to
offer to the public in return for that
money. If the fans think they have
a right to see more of Luisetti they
are all wrong, for Stanford is giving
the public all it can without causing
trouble on the campus, which after
all is the place where the whole af
fair starts. If it were possible to let
the public into Stanford-Cal games,
the public would get in, because it
pays bigger money than rooters.

The San Francisco fans have done
a lot of howling this season over the
fact that they can't get tickets to
the basketball games to see Hank
Luisetti play. They have been ask
ing through various spokesmen that,
for instance, a Stanford-Cal game
be moved to San Francisco's Civil
Auditorium so that some people be
sides the rooters can see the great
Luisetti play.
Mo.vt of those fans that pretend
they are being given unfair treat
ment are the fans that won't pay
more than four bits to see a bas
ketball game, anyway. They seem
to forget that Stanford played in
the Civic And against U.S.F. last
year, and that the And was just
about half full. To make it worse
that game was played for flood re
lief and should have had a smash
ing crowd.
They also seem to forget that
Stanford played Washington in the
coast title playoff two years ago in
the Civic And, and that place wasn't
filled to capacity then, either. In
both of those games Luisetti played
great ball—he played some of the
finest basketball he has ever shown
in the Washington game.
Not only that, but when Stanford
played U.S.F. a week and a half ago,
was the Pavilion filled to the capa
city that the Stanford-Cal games
show is possible? Not on your night
cap, and what's more Luisetti played
more than half of that game.
The whole thing eventually
comes down at last to the con
clusion that what the fans want to
see is a Stanford-Cal game equal
ly as much as they want to see
Luisetti. There is no doubt that
Luisetti in a Cal game has much
more attraction than he has in a
U.S.F. game, but that isn't because
he plays better basketball—it's
because the Stanford-Cal rivalry
affects the outside fans almost as
much as it gets the students.
Both Stanford and Cal are ob
viously going to make all they can
on gate receipts from their star
players, for it takes money to run
schools, and athletics are the most
popular commodity a school has to
offer to the public in return for that
money. If the fans think they have
a right to see more of Luisetti they
are all wrong, for Stanford is giving
the public all it can without causing
trouble on the campus, which after
all is the place where the whole af
fair starts. If it were possible to let
the public into Stanford-Cal games,
the public would get in, because it
pays bigger money than rooters.

The varsity basketball team will
stay home next year, instead of
touring East as has been the case
for the past two seasons. That fact
is going to give the team a chance
to get in some games here during
the Christmas season with local tal
ent, and possibly some barnstorm
ing outfits.
Now, while the eastern tours are
very good advertising — when you
have a good team—they lessen the
opportunity to get in practice games
before conference play starts.
That is, it is not possible to play as
many games on a trip as when stay
ing at home.
Next year the team is to
he largely a green squad, as far as
tough, steady big time competition
is concerned. Phil Zonnc will
he the only seasoned player avail
able, although others like Tom
Siebert, Leon Lufaillc, and Derrol
Iluddlcson will have piled up a
little experience this year. It is
going to be necessary next year
to give the new hands as much ex
perience in starting games as pos
sible before the conference drive
starts.
For that reason, staying at home
and playing a fairly heavy practice
season is going to be a help to
next year's varsity.
In regard to the possibilities of in
tersectional tilts with teams travel
ing around, several schools have
been considered that plan to go on
the gravy circuit in 1938-39. Ne
braska and Michigan State are con
sidering sending hoop teams to this
coast. Columbia and Dartmouth are
both very anxious to open recipro
cal basketball competition with Stan
ford. Notre Dame, always popular

city that the Stanford-Cal games
show is possible? Not on your night
cap, and what's more Luisetti played
more than half of that game.
The whole thing eventually
comes down at last to the con
clusion that what the fans want to
see is a Stanford-Cal game equal
ly as much as they want to see
Luisetti. There is no doubt that
Luisetti in a Cal game has much
more attraction than he has in a
U.S.F. game, but that isn't because
he plays better basketball—it's
because the Stanford-Cal rivalry
affects the outside fans almost as
much as it gets the students.
Both Stanford and Cal are ob
viously going to make all they can
on gate receipts from their star
players, for it takes money to run
schools, and athletics are the most
popular commodity a school has to
offer to the public in return for that
money. If the fans think they have
a right to see more of Luisetti they
are all wrong, for Stanford is giving
the public all it can without causing
trouble on the campus, which after
all is the place where the whole af
fair starts. If it were possible to let
the public into Stanford-Cal games,
the public would get in, because it
pays bigger money than rooters.
