# Brock Takes Top Varsity Net Post
## 
### 
Dave Brock scored an overwhelm
ing 6-2. 6-3 victory over Lloyd Gates
yesterday and took the No. 1 spot
on the varsity tennis team. Brock's
win pushed Captain Bob Underwood
down to the four spot and Bob
Braly down to the third position.
This lineup probably will remain in
tact for the opening match of the
year against the Golden Gate Park
Tennis Club here Saturday.
Coach Lockwood announced yes
terday that tentatively he had broken
up the doubles combinations of Gates
and Folsom, and Lanes and Arm
strong in an attempt to balance the
lineup. Test matches will be played
for the remainder of the week to de
termine the starting pairs. Under
wood and Braly, however, are prac
tically certain of holding down the
No. 1 position.
King Phillip's war in 1675-7(5 was
the most serious of the early up
risings of Indians against foreign
invaders of North America.
