# Encina Nine Prepares For Game Tomorrow
## 
### 
Practically certain that their sea
son's debut against St. Ignatius High
tomorrow afternoon will not join
its predecessors and be rained out,
the Encina baseball gang were out
yesterday getting a snappy workout
in preparation for their playing bow.
Set for tomorrow at 3:30 on the
ffosh diamond, the encounter will
find both teams doing their best to
cop the top breaks. Much in the
same position as the frosh, the high
schoolers are seeing their beginning
action in this game. Both teams
have been kept indoors by the rain
for approximately the same length of
time, and any advantage the Farm
team may have had on account of
their longer practice season has
been put to naught on this account.
One change has been made in
the lineup to start the tilt. Glenn
"Cookie" South, showing up well
in the practices since the rains, may
get the starting nod over "Swede"
Johannessen for an outfield post.
A tentative batting order has been
set with first sackcr "Ush" Tucker
occupying the coveted clean-up spot
as fourth batter. Lead-off man will
be Elton Boone, who plays third
base, with Herb Atkinson, catcher,
and Herb Bull, who will start at
short, following as number two and
three.
Monte Pfyl, who plays the key

stone sack at second will follow the
general belief that a pitcher can't
hit. "Cookie" South will come to the
plate next, with outfielders Jim Mc-
Cloud and Howie Ruth following as
eight and nine respectively.
In event that "Swede" Johannes
sen breaks into the beginning nine
before tomorrow's game this bat
ting order may be changed to allow
the hard hitting outfielder a slug
ger's slot on the batting list.
