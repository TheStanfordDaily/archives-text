# Bunn Polishes Fast Breaks For Cal Game
## Team Hopes To Make Better Use Of Newly Inaugurated System 
### 
In the Stanford-California bas
| ketbal! game two weeks ago, Stan
. i'ord, with potentially one of the
: best fast-breaking teams the coast
has seen in years, scored just three
times on .sudden down-court rushes.
Not satisfied that his team can't
score more than three times with
the fast-break weapon against Cali
fornia, Coach John Bunn drilled the
varsity again yesterday with the aim
of polishing that blade to carve out
something like 10 field goals to
morrow night.
New Strategy
Based upon scouting reports from
the California-U.C.L.A. games at
Berkeley last week-end, Coach
Bunn's strategy incorporates a new
I trick —just a simple little maneuver
—that is designed to get an extra
man in the California end of the
court immediately upon recovery of
the ball by the Indians.
In addition to the practice on the
new fast break idea, Coach Bunn di
rected the team through further
drill on his new set-type offense
twist that he has concocted to pene
trate the particular style of defense
used by Cal. Both new maneuvers
are confidential—the persons who
will find them out first will be the
California varsity tomorrow night.
Scrimmage Held
The starting lineup against the
Bears will be just the same as it
has been in every game since the
conference opened — Luisetti and
j Zonne, forwards; Calderwood and
j Lee, guards; and Stoefen, center.
