# Card Nine Loses 12-1 To Spartans
## State Hurler Goes Distance, As Mates Pound Out 14 Hits 
### 
As Coach Harry Wolter watched
his men take a 12-1 shellacking
from San Jose State yesterday, he
probably wished the 19-day deluge
had lasted a day or two longer.
Woiter had one consolation, how
ever. It was only a practice game
and the Indians have one more Sat
urday to get rid of their bad habits
before meeting St. Mary's Wednes
day in their opening C.1.8.A. tilt.
Heavy Hitting Team
San Jose brought a hard-hitting
outfit up to the Farm, and, paced
by Captain Walt Macphevson and
Tony Morati, who collected three
hits out of five times at bat each,
the Spartans turned 14 hits and
three Card errors into 12 runs, to a
single tally for Stanford.
Art Carpenter, veteran Spartan
moundsman, went the distance for
San Jose, allowing one run and six
hits. For eight innings he had the
Indians shut out with four bingles.
The Cards came to life in the final
frame and broke into the scoring
column when Cfoffis doubled, went
to third on an outfield fly and
crossed the plate on a passed ball.
Three Card Pitchers
Spike Furman, Glenn Hamilton
and A1 Lazzarone performed on the
mound for the Indians, toiling three
innings apiece. Furman was touched
for two runs and three hits in the
first inning, but after that he let his
opponents down in order and struck
out the side in the second.
The Spartans did their heavy stick
work off Hamilton, getting to him
for eight runs and nine hits. Laz«-
zarone worked the last three innings
and allowed two runs and three hits.
