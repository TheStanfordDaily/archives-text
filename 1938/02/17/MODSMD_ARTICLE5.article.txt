''In the first place, the Nursery
Maid theme is taken from the mir
acle play type drama of the Middle
Ages, and a modern playwright dips
very seldom into that particular
period," said the actress. "Naturally,
to portray the nun, I must shelve
the free and easy tradition of the
twentieth century feminine player."

don't want to give a wooden per
formance, so I have tried to figure
out a well-rounded, understandable
person—a young girl, morally and
spiritually mature and yet child
like in her faith."
