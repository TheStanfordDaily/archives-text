## 
### 
Only three more weeks remain for
boxers to qualify for (he Gene Tun
ney Awards, according to Harry
Maloney, minor sports director.
Selections will be made from both
freshman and varsity squads by
Mr. Maloney and Clayton Frye,
boxing coach, at the end of this
quarter. President Lyman Wilbur
has been asked to present the medals
for Tunney, who will probably be in
the East at the time of the selection.
"This award is open to all Stan
ford boxers said Maloney, "but
merely possessing boxing ability will
not win it. A Tunney Award win
ner must be a real sportsman as well
as a leader both in and out of the
ring."
The Gene Tunney Award, estab
lished in 1927, is given on the basis

of the character, leadership, sports
manship, scholarship, and boxing
ability, with equal credit given for
each quality, in past years, win
ners have often been men who have
never represented the University in
competition.
Gene Tunney has accepted honor
ary membership in the Circle "S"
Society and had expected to be on
the Farm yesterday to see Mr. Ma
loney and to attend a Circle "S"
meeting but he was obliged to fly
East on urgent business.
The selection of Stanford by Tun
ney as the college to which to make
his boxing award, was due largely
to his regard for Harry Maloney,
who as a captain in the American
Expeditionary Forces had befriend
ed the young Marine private and en
couraged him in his ring career.
