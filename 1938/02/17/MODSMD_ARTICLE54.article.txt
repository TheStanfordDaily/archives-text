# How the Other Half Lives
## 
### 
AT THE dinner table of Alpha Alpha tonight,
two brothers will wax vociferous over Gen
eral Franco's latest military move. After heated
discussion, which will spread, they will ar
rive at the conclusion that this is a hell of a
world anyhow.
Tonight, in a Palo Alto boarding house, a
Spaniard business grad and a Colombia chem
major will discuss Ex Committee's newest sub
committee. The bull-session will end when both
ask, "What the hell is Ex Committee?"
But if both bull-sessions were carried on at
the same time and place, seSsioners might sally
forth to the library with the feeling that the
music had not only gone round and round, but
had come out somewhere. To accomplish such
a joining of forces, Francis Davila, South Amer
ican student at Stanford, suggested that campus
living groups extend occasional dinner invita
tions to foreigners.
Baffled by large classes and the mass con
gregation at the English Corner who are talk
ing about Luisetti — "and what do we know
about Luisetti?" as one foreigner said—Stan
ford's international population is balked in its
attempt to join American campus life without
access to a small group.
Yet the fraternities, as well as other living
groups, are willfully in practically the same
position of isolation. In spite of promises to
prospective pledges, contact of Row-men and
women is often limited to the house. New per
sonalities and viewpoints are as scarce as red
shirts in this "good American" community, but
efforts to develop contacts with an out-group
are even scarcer.
The foreign students aren't asking for pity in
making the suggestion that they be given some
access to campus groups. Modestly, they ne
glect to point out that they have much to offer
in return. They aren't here because they were
evicted from the fatherland for having an
archistic tendencies or halitosis — they have
come as future leaders in their own countries
—the cream of the crop.
One house, spurred by an enthusiastic mem
ber, is already making plans to follow Davila's
suggestion. As well as ordinary meals, ex
change dinners with sorority houses might be
an even better time to extend this fraternal
hand. For, the foreign students hint, they are
as interested in meeting Stanford's 1100 as the
next man.
The extra slice of bread which will be put on
the plate for the ambassador's son from Chile
won't nick the house budget. And the presence
of that visitor will come in handy when the
subject of the Monroe Doctrine pops up.—J. S.

archistic tendencies or halitosis — they have
come as future leaders in their own countries
—the cream of the crop.
One house, spurred by an enthusiastic mem
ber, is already making plans to follow Davila's
suggestion. As well as ordinary meals, ex
change dinners with sorority houses might be
an even better time to extend this fraternal
hand. For, the foreign students hint, they are
as interested in meeting Stanford's 1100 as the
next man.
The extra slice of bread which will be put on
the plate for the ambassador's son from Chile
won't nick the house budget. And the presence
of that visitor will come in handy when the
subject of the Monroe Doctrine pops up.—J. S.
AT THE dinner table of Alpha Alpha tonight,
two brothers will wax vociferous over Gen
eral Franco's latest military move. After heated
discussion, which will spread, they will ar
rive at the conclusion that this is a hell of a
world anyhow.
Tonight, in a Palo Alto boarding house, a
Spaniard business grad and a Colombia chem
major will discuss Ex Committee's newest sub
committee. The bull-session will end when both
ask, "What the hell is Ex Committee?"
But if both bull-sessions were carried on at
the same time and place, seSsioners might sally
forth to the library with the feeling that the
music had not only gone round and round, but
had come out somewhere. To accomplish such
a joining of forces, Francis Davila, South Amer
ican student at Stanford, suggested that campus
living groups extend occasional dinner invita
tions to foreigners.
Baffled by large classes and the mass con
gregation at the English Corner who are talk
ing about Luisetti — "and what do we know
about Luisetti?" as one foreigner said—Stan
ford's international population is balked in its
attempt to join American campus life without
access to a small group.
Yet the fraternities, as well as other living
groups, are willfully in practically the same
position of isolation. In spite of promises to
prospective pledges, contact of Row-men and
women is often limited to the house. New per
sonalities and viewpoints are as scarce as red
shirts in this "good American" community, but
efforts to develop contacts with an out-group
are even scarcer.
The foreign students aren't asking for pity in
making the suggestion that they be given some
access to campus groups. Modestly, they ne
glect to point out that they have much to offer
in return. They aren't here because they were
evicted from the fatherland for having an
archistic tendencies or halitosis — they have
come as future leaders in their own countries
—the cream of the crop.
