# Anchors Aweigh

### 
TEN of Stanford's sons will not start in next
summer learning business from the bottom
up by filling gas tanks. If God permits and
the Treasury quits fooling with the currency,
they will take an 80-foot schooner to the South
Seas, attempting to stock up on golden memo
ries before the filling stations swallow them.
It is not likely that they will get the same
send-off the Normandie does. And unless they
pick a fight with a Japanese battleship, they
probably won't be involved in an international
incident. The trip is not exactly epoch-making.
It won't make a great deal of difference to those
of us who spend our summer in a brisk bout
with the time clock for a punching bag. But it
will provide us with a nice argument the next
time some venerable cynic grabs the best chair
and begins to tell us that this generation has
no spirit.
It is one of the cherished theories of hearth
rug heroes that Romance is dead, that the young
man of today is content to spend his days fit
ting shoes, and his evenings holding hands in
the movies. They fling in our faces stories of
bold pioneers who trod the virgin soil of un
charted wildernesses with the same fine care
lessness that they trod on the redman's sensi
tive feelings. They refer us to the days of
exploration and the days when knights who
couldn't get enough of a workout from the local
dragons rode abroad to pick fights with their
neighbors' pets.

Our valiant library adventurers forget that
this age does not lend itself to exploring. Maps
of most wildernesses are on file at the city hall;
and the government is very nasty when you
start trouble with the Indians. The Indians, in
cidentally, aren't overly pleasant about it.
And those who mourn Romance forget that
the knight who rode forth with his trusty can
opener had a dependable bunch of serfs get
! ting dinner ready at home. They also forget
that if a knight came back to find his castle
foreclosed on, he could drop over to the next
manor some dark night, heave the owner out,
and settle down. Now the law calls that tres
pass, and frowns on it.
But the proposed trip to the South Seas
shows that Romance is not yet ready for wreaths
and eulogies. It also shows that nurse-maiding
a gas pump is not the ideal of American youth.
And mention of it may relieve some of the ten
sion when the sailors of the god ship Arm
Chair navigate around the bar and buttonhole
you.—J. C.

pick a fight with a Japanese battleship, they
probably won't be involved in an international
incident. The trip is not exactly epoch-making.
It won't make a great deal of difference to those
of us who spend our summer in a brisk bout
with the time clock for a punching bag. But it
will provide us with a nice argument the next
time some venerable cynic grabs the best chair
and begins to tell us that this generation has
no spirit.
It is one of the cherished theories of hearth
rug heroes that Romance is dead, that the young
man of today is content to spend his days fit
ting shoes, and his evenings holding hands in
the movies. They fling in our faces stories of
bold pioneers who trod the virgin soil of un
charted wildernesses with the same fine care
lessness that they trod on the redman's sensi
tive feelings. They refer us to the days of
exploration and the days when knights who
couldn't get enough of a workout from the local
dragons rode abroad to pick fights with their
neighbors' pets.

Our valiant library adventurers forget that
this age does not lend itself to exploring. Maps
of most wildernesses are on file at the city hall;
and the government is very nasty when you
start trouble with the Indians. The Indians, in
cidentally, aren't overly pleasant about it.
And those who mourn Romance forget that
the knight who rode forth with his trusty can
opener had a dependable bunch of serfs get
! ting dinner ready at home. They also forget
that if a knight came back to find his castle
foreclosed on, he could drop over to the next
manor some dark night, heave the owner out,
and settle down. Now the law calls that tres
pass, and frowns on it.
But the proposed trip to the South Seas
shows that Romance is not yet ready for wreaths
and eulogies. It also shows that nurse-maiding
a gas pump is not the ideal of American youth.
And mention of it may relieve some of the ten
sion when the sailors of the god ship Arm
Chair navigate around the bar and buttonhole

TEN of Stanford's sons will not start in next
summer learning business from the bottom
up by filling gas tanks. If God permits and
the Treasury quits fooling with the currency,
they will take an 80-foot schooner to the South
Seas, attempting to stock up on golden memo
ries before the filling stations swallow them.
It is not likely that they will get the same
send-off the Normandie does. And unless they
pick a fight with a Japanese battleship, they
probably won't be involved in an international
incident. The trip is not exactly epoch-making.
