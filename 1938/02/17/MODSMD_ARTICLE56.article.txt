DOWN ON TIIE FARM
gVERY once in a while someone rises to remark on
the Farm's provincialism, its lack of interest in
outside affairs, its general disregard of the things which
make the outside go 'round.
The most recent of these commentators on the col
lective Stanford mind is Dr. Trueblood, and although
he has recently announced a change of heart, he has
made the customary reservation: That while the stu
dent body is potentially alive to current issues, its in
tellectual curiosity has very little chance of being
aroused under the present set-up.
With this, no one would disagree. The Farm's
readiness to attend such things as the Tuesday Lec
ture Series—since they have been rejuvenated and
turned over to such speakers as the Secretary-General
of the Institute of Pacific Relations—should be earnest
enough that it will listen when it has something
worthy of attention to listen to.

B UT aside from the Lecture Series and such occa
sional events as the Sandburg and Stefansson lec
tures, Stanford is given little opportunity to keep up
with the world. Now and then a famous figure drifts
through, but he rarely stays long enough to do more
than look at Memorial Chapel. When he does speak,
he gets a royal welcome.
The blame for the Farm's mental dullardry, if any
one can be blamed, seems to lie more with the Ad
ministration, than with the students. True, it did pre
sent a current events course last year, but it stopped
it about the time it was becoming a really good Farm
tradition.
It does give us the Tuesday Lectures, but it leaves
it to the Associated Students to bring Carl Sandburg
to the campus.
If the matter is to be left in the -hands of the stu
dents, then the students should be granted a suffi
cient budget so that they can get as many—and as
good—speakers as they wish. If the University can
not dismiss classes whenever a lecturer manages to
arrive—obviously impossible—then some sort of regu
lar schedule should be arranged. One question of
space has vanished with the building of Memorial Hall;
there remains only the problem of filling it.
If there does exist on this campus, as most of our
authorities agree, a latent desire for knowledge, and a
dormant interest in current affairs, then it is up to the
University to awaken it. Just, as surely as a five-unit
class, that too ranks as education.—Allen Drury.
