JJURING the next few days one of the local theaters
will show Miss Twinkle Toes on ice, and buried
in the midst of the snow scenes will be the Raymond
Scott's Quintet. Discovered on Columbia's Swing Ses
sion, Scott has advanced in an amazing manner.
Strictly speaking, the quintet isn't a swing outfit
because they aren't free to improvise very much. Most
of those things you hear are all written out on paper.
However, the major exception to this is the quintet's
tenor man. And there is really a musician!
For the purposes of the census takers, his name is
Dave Harris, but it seems impossible that a mortal man
could get such ungodly tones and ideas out of a sax.
Scott concurs in the opinion. "I call him Enoch Knox,"
he said, "no man cay play like that with an ordinary
name."
Latest composition of Scott's is "The Penguin" in
which he musically interprets the bird. Other well
known tunes to come from his pen during the last year
are, "The Toy Trumpet," "Powerhouse," "Twilight in
Turkey," and "Minuet in Jazz." In the last Carole
Lombard flicker, during the scene at the night club
where the g;Tls rode horses onto the stage, it was Scott's
music that was doing strange things to the various
national anthems.

JJURING the last few weeks there have been several
tunes set to wax that are well worth listening to.
Connie Boswell's "Martha" takes top vocal honors,
especially since the Johnny Mercer records are getting
a bit worn. Backing Boswell is Bob Crosby and his
Bobcats. Connie is in good voice on this record, but
without the Dixieland background supplied by Crosby,
the platter would only be so-so. Also under the ex
cellent column comes Jimmy Lunceford's "Put on
Your Old Grey Bonnet," but nearly not half as good
as his "Annie Laurie" or "Raggin the Scale."
If you listened in to Benny Goodman Tuesday night,
you heard him swing out on, "The Naughty Waltz."
Now for purposes of the record that was exactly the
two hundred and seventy-sixth arrangement supplied
him by Fletcher Henderson. In a little bull session
after the Prom, Fletch told us that he had been doing
arrangements for Benny for years, and, as far as he
knew, would keep on doing them. I hope that an
swers those letters and comments I received.

I hate to keep disagreeing with my learned con
temporary on the Chappie, but I'm sure if he listens
to Goodman s record of "So Long" he will change his
attitude about Red Norvo's saxes being better than
Goodman s. Right after Helen Ward's vocal, Benny's
saxes take it up, and go into the next chorus with the
smoothest work and tones it has ever been my privi
lege to hear. I don t believe it's possible, but if some
one can find any sweeter sax work (not Lombardo)
than that in So Lorn l ,. 1 wish they'd t«• 11 me about
j it. Pat Mc-Guirk.

cellent column comes Jimmy Lunceford's "Put on
Your Old Grey Bonnet," but nearly not half as good
as his "Annie Laurie" or "Raggin the Scale."
If you listened in to Benny Goodman Tuesday night,
you heard him swing out on, "The Naughty Waltz."
Now for purposes of the record that was exactly the
two hundred and seventy-sixth arrangement supplied
him by Fletcher Henderson. In a little bull session
after the Prom, Fletch told us that he had been doing
arrangements for Benny for years, and, as far as he
knew, would keep on doing them. I hope that an
swers those letters and comments I received.

I hate to keep disagreeing with my learned con
temporary on the Chappie, but I'm sure if he listens
to Goodman s record of "So Long" he will change his
attitude about Red Norvo's saxes being better than
Goodman s. Right after Helen Ward's vocal, Benny's
saxes take it up, and go into the next chorus with the
smoothest work and tones it has ever been my privi
lege to hear. I don t believe it's possible, but if some
one can find any sweeter sax work (not Lombardo)
than that in So Lorn l ,. 1 wish they'd t«• 11 me about
j it. Pat Mc-Guirk.
JJURING the next few days one of the local theaters
will show Miss Twinkle Toes on ice, and buried
in the midst of the snow scenes will be the Raymond
Scott's Quintet. Discovered on Columbia's Swing Ses
sion, Scott has advanced in an amazing manner.
Strictly speaking, the quintet isn't a swing outfit
because they aren't free to improvise very much. Most
of those things you hear are all written out on paper.
However, the major exception to this is the quintet's
tenor man. And there is really a musician!
For the purposes of the census takers, his name is
Dave Harris, but it seems impossible that a mortal man
could get such ungodly tones and ideas out of a sax.
Scott concurs in the opinion. "I call him Enoch Knox,"
he said, "no man cay play like that with an ordinary
name."
Latest composition of Scott's is "The Penguin" in
which he musically interprets the bird. Other well
known tunes to come from his pen during the last year
are, "The Toy Trumpet," "Powerhouse," "Twilight in
Turkey," and "Minuet in Jazz." In the last Carole
Lombard flicker, during the scene at the night club
where the g;Tls rode horses onto the stage, it was Scott's
music that was doing strange things to the various
national anthems.

JJURING the last few weeks there have been several
tunes set to wax that are well worth listening to.
Connie Boswell's "Martha" takes top vocal honors,
especially since the Johnny Mercer records are getting
a bit worn. Backing Boswell is Bob Crosby and his
Bobcats. Connie is in good voice on this record, but
without the Dixieland background supplied by Crosby,
the platter would only be so-so. Also under the ex
cellent column comes Jimmy Lunceford's "Put on
Your Old Grey Bonnet," but nearly not half as good
as his "Annie Laurie" or "Raggin the Scale."
If you listened in to Benny Goodman Tuesday night,
you heard him swing out on, "The Naughty Waltz."
