# CAMPUS OPINION
## DOG GONE! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I sincerely hope you print this, as
it will serve to clear up a bit of
false information printed in the cur
rent number of "Chappie." The
article, one on campus house dogs,
in discussing the Alpha Kappa
Lambda dog, refers to him in sar
castic terms as having "the highly
original name of Buster," and as
"being shunned as a bully by other
campus dogs." So here are some
facts I would like? made public.
1. Buster is a thoroughbred Great
Dane from the Harold Lloyd ken
nels. He was named after the com
edian Buster Keaton, which is his
full name. Buster is good-natured,
and never attacks another dog with
out provocation.
2. The meanest dog on the campus
is one "Siggy," who loves to lurk be
hind bushes and scamper forth to
bite heels or tear trousers of pass
ersby. The article in Chappie
served a use because we learned
that "Siggy" was an abbreviation of
"Sigma III." We had suspected, as
had many, that it was shoiH for 'cig
arette.' Buster himself was the first
to object to these tactics, and on one
occasion knocked "Siggy" down and
sat on him after one of his masters
had been bravely attacked from be
hind by the latter dog. Buster, we
might add, never sneaks out from
bushes to nip other dogs, or people
passing by.
3. It is vaguely possible that the
author of the article, Tom Fleming,
who is an Alpha Sig, might be pre
judiced. "Siggy," the object of a
flattering article on the opposite page
of the Chappie, belongs to the Alpha
Sigs.
A:: Buster is well-known and liked
on the campus, I am sure that this
article will only justify the liking
for him which is generally enter
tained on the campus.—An A.K.L.
