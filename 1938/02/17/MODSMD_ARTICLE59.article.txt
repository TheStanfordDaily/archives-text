# THE 						PEANUTS, YES!

The Editor, Sir:
Pretzels without beer, a moon
without a girl, a rally without
"Doodles" Weaver—these may seem
unbearable, but nothing ciuld be
worse than basketball games with
out peanuts. One well-known head
Stanford basketball coach is on the
verge of banning these morsels of
delight—and they WILL be banned
—unless all peanut imbibers refrain
from carpeting the playing floor
with hulls.
Throw them behind you; especial
ly you ringsiders. Keep our floor
clean!— Peanut Lovers Club.
