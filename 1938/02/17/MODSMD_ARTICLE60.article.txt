### 
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett,
head of the Division of Speech and
Drama, read and interpreted John
Masefield's "Reynard the Fox" be
fore approximately 30 Luncheon
Club members yesterday.
" 'Reynard the Fox' was Ma.% 1 -
field's only war-time poem," said
Professor Bassett. "It was written
to take men's minds from the tra
gedy which surrounded them, by
portraying vividly the excitement of
an old English chase and the beauty
of the English countryside."
Professor Bassett pointed out that
the fox-hunt was Masefield's ideal
medium for portraying early Eng
lish country life, for at these ex
citing times all social distinctions
were forgotten and men of all walks
of life joined in the chase.
