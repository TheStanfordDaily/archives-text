EAGLE ROCK, Feb. 16 (UP).â€”
Mariano Salas, a substitute forward,
was the Frank Meri'iwell hero to
day at Occidental College. He en
tered the Occidental-Pomona game
with less than a minute of play re
maining last night and dropped two
field goals that gave Occidental a
28-26 victory. The score at half
time was deadlocked.

Early Canadian golfers were re
quired to wear red coats and white
flannel trousers with caps of fore
and aft style.
