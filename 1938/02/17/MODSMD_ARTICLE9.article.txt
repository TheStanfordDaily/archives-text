# London And Paris Plan To Protest
## Eden Says Austria Crisis May Lead To Nazi Drive To East 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 16 (UP).â€”Great
Britain and France, fearful that
Nazi penetration in Austria may be
the groundwork of a German in
vasion eastward, agreed tonight to
lodge joint representations in Ber
lin and Vienna asking assurance that
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler intends to
preserve Austrian independence.
The parallel action, supposedly on
French initiative, came after For
eign Secretary Anthony Eden flatly
stated in the House of Commons
that he had "reason to believe" Hit
ler's ambitions in Austria included
more than the mere injection of
Nazis into key cabinet posts.
Hitler's Aims Told
Not since Hitler's march into the
Rhineland on March 7, 1936, in de
fiance of the Versailles Treaty has
a Nazi "fait accompli" stirred such
alarm and bewilderment.
Private advices received in Lon
don tonight, coincident with Vienna
dispatches that fresh demands by
Hitler had upset the Austrian nego
tiations, said Der Fuehrer was in
sisting upon:
1. Closer Austro-German military
co-operation.
2. Austria's adherence to the
Anglo - Italian - Japanese alliance
against Communism.
The British cabinet met twice to
hear latest reports of the situation.
Refuses Comment
House of Commons members sat
in grave silence as Eden announced
that he believed the "reconciliation"
reached by Hitler and Chancellor
Kurt Schuschnigg of Austria last
Saturday at Berchtesgaden included
"undertakings on a variety of sub
jects in addition to the change in the
Austrian cabinet."
"About such understandings, how
ever, I am unable to say more until
the terms of the Berchtesgaden
agreement are published," he added.
