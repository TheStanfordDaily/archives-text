DEALS KINDLY WITH A
Tho? Heath SUIT

Not that the sightliest cloth will not wear out eventually,
j But the point is this: be it ever so worn, a Thos. Heath suit
never loses that air of being born to good society. This
** may account for the tenacity with which a Thos. Heath
wearer clings to his Thos. Heath as long as it will cling to
him. Such is the consequence of so much personal super*
vision, hand work and everlasting fussing with details.
