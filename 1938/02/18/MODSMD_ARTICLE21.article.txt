### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).
The outline of Congressional activ
ity for the next fortnight was map
ped by legislative leaders today as
the House Naval Affairs Committee,
nearing completion of hearings on
the naval expansion bill, heard from
the Navy's chief of construction that
President Roosevelt's naval expan
sion program would cost more than
one billion dollars.
So extensive will be this vast
naval program, Rear Admiral Wil
liam G_ Du√üoise testified, that the
Navy does not have facilities to
build the 47 fighting ships and 22
auxiliaries projected in the pending
Vinson bill.
