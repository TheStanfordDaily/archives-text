# Third Big Came On Tap Tonight
## Cardinal Hoopsters Need Win To Tie For Conference Lead 
### 
Stanford and California meqf in their third game of the basketball
season tonight in the Pavilion, a game that puts at stake Cal's lead in the
conference and Stanford's reputation as a great basketball team.
By trouncing the Bears p.s they did in the second game two weeks ago,
the Cardinals can tie for ihe conference lead with the Berkeley five. A

'oss by Stanford would put Cali
tornia in a strong position on the
road to the title.
All-around confidence character
izes the Indians confidence in
spired by the 29-point lacing over
the Bears and the subsequent pair
of victories over Southern Califor
nia at Los Angeles. The team has
a* last found itself as a unit, with H.
B. Lee and Phil Zotine finally dove
tailing perfectly with the three great
seniors of the first five, Captain
Hank Luisetti, Art Stoefen and Jack
Calderwood.
Defensively, the team, according
to Coach John Bunn, is as near per
fect as he could hope for. With that
in mind he has directed the squad
through offensive workouts almost
entirely this week.
Offensively the outfit is undoubt
edly close to its peak as the two wins
over U.S.C. last week would indi
cate. Coach Bunn also has devised
two new tricks of attack especially
for the Bear defense. If they work,
the team will be that much better
of! I!' they don't, the Cards will
revert to the style that permitted
them to slaughter the Bears 62-33
in iheir last contest.
Bears To Use Strategy
California reportedly will attempt
to slow down the game by careful
ball handling and few positive
shots. Such tactics have been tried
by virtually every team that Stan
lord has ever played. California
nosed out Staniord at Berkeley in
the first game, however, by playing
the fastest ball it knew for 40 min
utes. In the second game the Bear
varsity didn't have a chance to get
started, and now Coach Nibs Pricc
has made an about-face in his strat
egy.
By "irtuc of the fact that Califor
nia still has two games away from
home with U.S.C., a team that is
gunning for them, while Stanford
has two fairly easy battles with
U.C.L.A. next week, the Indians arc
in the commanding position in spite
of Cal's full-game lead. California
has more need to win this game than
Stanford, in a sense, which means
that the Bears will be playing under
more pressure than Stanford.
