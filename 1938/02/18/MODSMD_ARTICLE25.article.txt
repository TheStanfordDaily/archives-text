# Carl Sandburg Voices Spirit Of Pioneer Past
## Poet Presents Own Renditions Of Folk Ballads On Guitar 
### 
A voice crying out of a pioneer
past into a wilderness which has
moved far beyond the times it sings
of, spoke to a polite but frequently
puzzled audience in Memorial Hall
l ist night, in a lecture which was
perhaps the best one-man show ever
presented at Stanford.
Carl Sandburg began his talk by
discussing propaganda, a subject
which led presently to Hugo Black,
rind from there went to the anti
iynching bill. Having reached that
umping-off point, it jumped off,
1 mding squarely in the middle of
. Ir. Sandburg's "The People, Yes."
Once on his home ground, Mr.
r.andburg's footing was a little surer,
nd it became increasingly so as he
r jad selections from his book, chief -
- folk-anecdotes and folk sayings.
A magnificent voice, used somewhat
t Aviously but with great effect, lent
force to these excerpts from the
i ; 'e of the people, and received sym
pathetic and amused response from
h s audience.
Through with "The People, Yes,"
iV •. Sandburg turned to songs from
h i "The American Songbag"—"of
tl'3 16 books I have done the only
eat one, which I didn't write."
/. companying himself on the gui
i •, he presented Negro spirituals,
I • ineer songs, folk songs—melodies
i: :en from the "blood and passion"
! America and given a curiously
riving rendition.
tn all his selections, in everything
lit said, with the exception of the
i; st part of his lecture, Mr. Sandburg
l ove to present not his voice, but
i • voice of the people, yes.
To say that he managed to hold
; audience, that he managed to
I t across to them a little of the
j-'pirit of America, is to pay tribute
( • a man whose love for his coun
l r/r people and their ways is mani
f. it from the time he begins to
1 eak.
