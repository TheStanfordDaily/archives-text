# Canoe Race Drenches Overturned Chi Psis
## 
### BRUCE GRANTIER 
A bunch of the boys were whoop
ing it up, or at least they were hav
ing lunch at the Chi Psi house a
week ago Saturday. Hugh (Trap
per) Grady was bragging of his
skill in shooting white water in the
Wisconsin wilds. Several of the
brothers were unimpressed and
after a few perfunctory raspberries
challenged Grady to race down San
Francisquito Creek.
The challenge was accepted and
the two teams took the Chi Psi
canoes up above the golf course at
Varsity Park and prepared to start.
The Greens, Bert McClintock, Hugh
Grady, and Winton Close were in
the first canoe and the Yellows,
Doug Albert, Gordy Pearson, and
Bert Kane in the second.
Rain Floods Creek
After many days of heavy rain
San Francisquito Creek was slop
ping over its banks, and the venture
began to look a little foolhardy.
However, the valiant crews launch
ed their rickety shells and shot down
the flooded creek.
At the golf course a crowd was
gathered and cheered them as they
sped past desperately trying to stay
right side up.
Just below the golf course the
Greens saw the lip of a five-foot
dam rushing toward them and shot
it before they had time to do any
thing else. The stem went under
with Dauntless Doug Albert and the
half-drowned crew had to pull over
to the bank and empty the canoe.
Two paddles floated past the
Greens and they had visions of
drowned bodies following them, but
they heroically raced on — partly
because they couldn't stop.
Faced Second Dam
A mile farther down, the now
wild-eyed sailors saw they were
coming to a second dam, and barely
had time to grab hold of a tree
which had been blown across the
i creek. Buck Rogers-like, they were
able to hold the canoe with their
feet and climb out, unharmed.
The whole trip was not as fortu
nate, as they turned over four
' times on the way down. The canoe
1 finally came out in the bay near
| the airport and the cold and shaking
| sailors were met by the admiring
j brothers.
An anticlimax was created when
j they found their opponents had
i

' turned over and dropped out after
going 50 yards. The accident was
i naively explained by one of the los
i ers, who said. "I leaned over to
duck a protruding branch and "we"
lost our balance."
The luckless losers were ostra
! cized by the brothers and one of
I them was heard to remark, "Our
White Water men had better stick
to sailing match sticks in the gut
j ter."
However, the shortenders, who
■ were caused some embarrassment
! because their boat was colored yel
low, have asked for a return bout,
valiantly naming the time, next
flood water, to make it harder.

Grady, and Winton Close were in
the first canoe and the Yellows,
Doug Albert, Gordy Pearson, and
Bert Kane in the second.
Rain Floods Creek
After many days of heavy rain
San Francisquito Creek was slop
ping over its banks, and the venture
began to look a little foolhardy.
However, the valiant crews launch
ed their rickety shells and shot down
the flooded creek.
At the golf course a crowd was
gathered and cheered them as they
sped past desperately trying to stay
right side up.
Just below the golf course the
Greens saw the lip of a five-foot
dam rushing toward them and shot
it before they had time to do any
thing else. The stem went under
with Dauntless Doug Albert and the
half-drowned crew had to pull over
to the bank and empty the canoe.
Two paddles floated past the
Greens and they had visions of
drowned bodies following them, but
they heroically raced on — partly
because they couldn't stop.
Faced Second Dam
A mile farther down, the now
wild-eyed sailors saw they were
coming to a second dam, and barely
had time to grab hold of a tree
which had been blown across the
i creek. Buck Rogers-like, they were
able to hold the canoe with their
feet and climb out, unharmed.
The whole trip was not as fortu
nate, as they turned over four
' times on the way down. The canoe
1 finally came out in the bay near
| the airport and the cold and shaking
| sailors were met by the admiring
j brothers.
An anticlimax was created when
j they found their opponents had
i

' turned over and dropped out after
going 50 yards. The accident was
i naively explained by one of the los
i ers, who said. "I leaned over to
duck a protruding branch and "we"
lost our balance."
The luckless losers were ostra
! cized by the brothers and one of
I them was heard to remark, "Our
White Water men had better stick
to sailing match sticks in the gut
j ter."
However, the shortenders, who
■ were caused some embarrassment
! because their boat was colored yel
low, have asked for a return bout,
valiantly naming the time, next
flood water, to make it harder.
A bunch of the boys were whoop
ing it up, or at least they were hav
ing lunch at the Chi Psi house a
week ago Saturday. Hugh (Trap
per) Grady was bragging of his
skill in shooting white water in the
Wisconsin wilds. Several of the
brothers were unimpressed and
after a few perfunctory raspberries
challenged Grady to race down San
Francisquito Creek.
The challenge was accepted and
the two teams took the Chi Psi
canoes up above the golf course at
Varsity Park and prepared to start.
The Greens, Bert McClintock, Hugh
Grady, and Winton Close were in
the first canoe and the Yellows,
Doug Albert, Gordy Pearson, and
Bert Kane in the second.
