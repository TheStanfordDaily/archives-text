# Cards Debate On C.I.O. Trend
## Hays, Moskovics Represent Farm 
### 
Tim Hays and John Moskovics
represented Stanford yesterday alt
ernoon in a debate with the Uni
versity of San Francisco on .the sub
ject "Resolved, that the program of
the C.1.0. is detrimental to the best
interests of labor." On the negative
team were Wallace Gallagher and
Robert Van Houte of San Fran
cisco.
The debate was a non-decision af
fair held for the purpose of prepar
ing the team for their trip to South
ern California on Feb. 25.
Main points against the C.1.0.
brought out by the affirmative* team
were its unfavorable entrance into
politics, its elimination of craft
unions in the United States, and its
adverse effect on the public due to
its communistic associations.
Refuting these arguments, the
negative side declared that the
C.1.0. is the most democratic labor
party in existence, and it has the
only feasible form of labor organiza
tion. A comparison of the A.F.L.
and the C.1.0. was also outstanding.
Plans were made for a return de
bate to be held at the University of
San Francisco at 1 o'clock on Feb.
25. A freshman team composed of
Sidney Terry and Sherman Mellin
koff will represent Stanford on the
negative side of the question: "Re
solved, that the National Labor Re
lations Board shall be empowered
to enforce arbitration of all indus
trial disputes."
