WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP).
President Roosevelt's business ad- j
visory council today recommended a
far-reaching program lor industrial
peace which contemplates drastic J
revision of the embattled National
Labor Relations Act and restriction
of the powers of the Labor Board.
The program was submitted to the |
chief executive by the council's in- :
dust rial relations committee headed
by John D. Biggers, unemployment 1
census director, and Charles R. Hook
of the National Association of Man- !
ufacturers.
The industrial council recorn- j
mended the Labor Relations Act be ,
amended as follows:
1. To ffrovide that neither the act j
nor its administrators shall favor
any particular form of labor organi- ;
zation â€” either industrial or craft, i
Tlie American Federation ol Labor
had charged the board with discrim
inating against its unions in favor of :
Committee for Industrial Organiza- J
tion unions.
2. To insure that employes are l
free in self-organization from inter- j
ference, restraint or coercion from
any source, whether management
or union.
3. To allow employers as well as
employes to invoke the services of
the labor board instead of only em
ployes as now provided.
4. To separate the fact-finding and
judicial duties which at present are
combined in the single labor board.
