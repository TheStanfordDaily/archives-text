' here's a little athletic coaches'
p.. jazine that's called "Scholastic
Cw :ch," and it has some pretty good
df . e in it quite often. But it made
an inference in its current issue that
B<'!> Zonne and some C.C.N.Y. bas
!:vt')all player shouldn't like.
here is contained a short edi
to.ial on a proposal to eliminate
lit backboard in basketball, sus
|:e iding the basket from a pole, so
l iit rebound work won't be so
im lortant as it is now in collegi
ate basketball. It would tend to
mi te the little men better in re-
Ia( on to the big players.

the ball in his hands, with a tall

The editorial reflects an opinion
Hut may eventually come to mean
:;o:: .'thing in basketball. It doesn't
: t, .ort the opinion—far from it, it
l dLules the proposal, which was
] .2 by Paul Mooney, coach of
(. imbia University in New York.
3 Viughingly suggests a catapult
t : t would catch the ball and throw
i - . I uck onto the court after every
j. as a means of solving the "out
().-! ounds nuisance."
robable reason for Mooney's
! uving suggested elimination of
ilk backboard was the fact that
iford was so effective with the
( i>.< -hand shot in New York for
i'.v< seasons. The one-hand shot
t.t ends heavily upon the aid
«. f the backboard, it seems,
; i.u the eastern coaches still like
1:k game played so that the style
ui' play made nationally popular
it Luisetti can't be so effective.
C <ach Nat Holman of C.C.N.Y.,
v i'j is generally considered along i
v. t i Luisetti as one of the greatest ,
p ers the game has ever seen, is j
rc rted as being in favor of the
IV n ney idea. In his day, 20 years
o so ago, much basketball was
played without the use of baek

b< ! letter that way now.

'he Stanford men didn't find
th track at all satisfactory, they j
s«,.'. The turns, they say. are too j

it seems, is too small. That is

in front and skirt the rail very
