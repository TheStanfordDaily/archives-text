## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Papoose Hoopsters To Battle Bearcubs 
### 
A revengeful California Bearcub
and a vicious Santa Clara Colt in
vade the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow evening to battle Stanford's
all - powerful Papoose basketball
team. Both games are preliminary
tilts and will commence at 6:30
o'clock.
Following its 42-20 victory over
the Cubs two weeks ago, the Pa
poose team will be installed as fav
orites tonight, but a much-improved
Cal team faces the opening tip-off.
Coach Bill Higgins has handed his
' team a tight sliding man-to-man
I defense, and hard practice sessions
| have smoothed out the offense,
i Since the last time the two teams
i met, Cal has swamped three straight
opponents, including Poly High, 35-
i 23; Commerce High, 38-16; and
; George Washington High, 39-23, and
i are pointing toward an upset to
night.
i Two new additions to the Cal first
! team, Johnny McGee and Mortie
! Macks, have given the squad the
j height and rebound ability it has
| lacked to date. Macks will start as
i one forward with Captain Freeman
j Dill lining up opposite him. Dill, a
| small dead-eye, was held to three
J foul shots by the Papooses last time
I the teams met and he will be gun
j ning for revenge tonight.*
i McGee will hold down the pivot
spot and it will be up to him to stop
Don Burness tonight. Burness tal
lied 12 points in the first game for
| high-point honors.
Cal guards will be A1 Derian and
Carl Olson, both of whom have es
tablished themselves as impregnable
defensive pillars. Derian turned in
an outstanding game in the first
"Little Big Game."
Tomorrow night the Papooses
tangle with the Santa Clara frosh,
and for the first time in several
weeks will go into a game not fav
ored to win. The Colts, coached by
"Chuck" Bannan, a former Bronc
cage hero, have lost but two games

all season, one to the San Jose State
frosh and another to the St. Mary's
frosh. However, the Colts hold vic
tories over both of their conquerors
and also a 57-28 win over the Cali
fornia frosh.
Leading the Colts is Bruce Hale, a
flashy forward with a deadly shoot
ing eye. The other forward is
Marty Passaglia, active and polished
floor-man.
Bob McCabe, the long-reaching
center, will be one of the tallest men
on the floor, and is Santa Clara's
hope to control the rebounds from
Coach Wytze Gorter's yearlings.
Pete Madler and Bob Feerick form
one of the finest guard combinations
in Santa Clara frosh history. De
fensively they're impenetrable, while
offensively Madler is a hard-driving
powerhouse and Feerick a danger
ous long shot artist.
The usual starting lineup.will start
both games for Stanford, including
Don Williams and Mike Marshall,
forwards; Don Burness, center; and
Ken Davidson and Bill Niccolls,
guards.
