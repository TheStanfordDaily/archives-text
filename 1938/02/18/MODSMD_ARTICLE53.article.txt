# Track Team Ready For Sirs! Meet
## Card Cinder Stars To Open Season In P.A.A. Indoor Test 
### 
Stanford's varsity trackmen, and
a sprinkling of frosh stars, will trek
up to the Civic Auditorium in San
Francisco tomorrow night to tangle
with the pick of the Bay Region ath
letes in the annual Pacific Associa
tion trackfest.
Stanford will be represented in
all events as Coach Dink Temple
ton gets the tracksters ready for a
long season, which will be climaxed
by the Indians traveling East for
1.C.4-A. meet. Stanford's entrance
in the latter meet is tentative, but
all indications point to the Temple
tonmen competing for the first time
in several years.
Mile Is Main Event
The feature event tomorrow night
will be the mile run, which finds Ed
Burrows of Stanford matching
strides with Stan Sadaj of Califor
nia, "Tige" Alexander, former Card
ace now running for the Olympic
Club, and Cecil Cole, ineligible Cali
fornia flyer.
Craig Williamson, sophomore
flash, showed he is in shape for to
morrow's 600-yard run by ripping
through a 50.55. 440 yesterday.
Williamson is also a probable entry
on Stanford's four-ma'n mile relay
team with Captain Ray Maiott and
Carl Mahurin also scheduled to
run. The fourth member of the
quartet hasn't been decided yet.
The Olympic Club outfit, boasting
its usual strong aggregation, is fa
vored to win the championship to
morrow night, but both Brutus
Hamilton, Cal mentor, and Temple
ton are gunning for upset wins.
