# Cards To Play Greyhounds
## Baseballers To Meet Gaels On Wednesday 
### 
After the exhibition they put on
Wednesday afternoon in dropping a
12-1 decision to the San Jose Spar
tans, Stanford's varsity baseballers
welcome the chance to iron out all
their faults tomorrow afternoon.
They play the Pacific Coast Grey
bound nine before tangling with St.
Mary's Wednesday in their first
C.1.8.A. game.
Much of their poor showing
against the Spartans can be attrib
uted to the two weeks layoff they
were forced to take because of rainy
weather. Tomorrow's game against
the Greyhounds, one of the best
nines among local Winter League
teams, should give the Indians the
necessary tuning up before clashing
with the strong Gael outfit.
Coach Harry Wolter hasn't named
his starting team, but will probably
open with the same nine that start
ed against San Jose and substitute
â€¢at every position after the third in
ning.
Tom Killefer pnd Jim Graham
will share the first base spot; Dale
Rcimer and Dick Tam will alternate
at second base with DiHc Shortall
holding down shortstop. With Cap
tin George Farrell and second
stiinger Pete McArthur both out be
cause of injuries, Jim McCormick
will open at third.
Spike Furman. Gl?r,n Hamilton
and Al Laz/arone will toil three in
nings apiece on the mound with
Sid Lewis and Bill Jameson taking
care of the catching, in the outfield
Wally deWitt, Norm Junty, Dick La
Franchi, Jimmy Coffis, and Ben Mc-
Guire should see servicc.
