KQW officials were willing to spend over
half their air time yesterday on sustaining rec
ord programs, interspersed with such advertis
ing hog-wash, but they, like any small station in
their place, have cancelled the scheduled pre
sentation of the first act of "Blue Jeans." "Too
controversial for radio presentation," they said.
"Besides, KQW serves a Salinas audience, lo
cale of Flavin's drama, making the possibilities
of objections from Salinas Valley residents too
great for broadcast."
So instead we'll give 'em a few hours of
clap-trap advertisement spiced with a little
dance music, huh 'fellows? We don't want to
stir them up too much by talking of such nasty
things as strikes, Communism, or college rad
icals. We'll let them get in on the ground floor
of Carter's furniture sale. Give them something
to think about. And besides, the benefit they
will get from old recordings and shady adver
tisements will be so much batter than bringing
up social problems of a controversial nature.
For radio, far from living up to the great ar
tistic potentialities credited to it in the begin
ning, is now little more than a vocal bill-board.
Worst offenders are the small stations, who
fail to offer any real entertainment in return
for their advertising blurbs.
But it is just these stations who could take
the label off their Arrowroot Cure-alls by ven
turing into the realms of topical programs.
Forced into their position of patent-medicine
barkers by an inability to attract big-money
programs, they must cater to small advertisers
and their customers. Yet program ventures, de
nied to larger stations by the size and nature
of their financial backing, would remove the
smell which arises from musty files of phono
graph records and junk advertising. The aroma
around KQW, itself, is nearly pure, for they
have attempted in the past, and will attempt in
the future, such ventures with presentations of
Farm radio drama. Bu their example is unique.
A "Blue Jeans," might stir up radio audiences;
it might even make them think a little—although
the play is hardly rabble-rousing. But it would
justify the hours of Dr. Barker and Bing Crosby
which are sent out on the air for the remainder
of the time.—J. S.

But it is just these stations who could take
the label off their Arrowroot Cure-alls by ven
turing into the realms of topical programs.
Forced into their position of patent-medicine
barkers by an inability to attract big-money
programs, they must cater to small advertisers
and their customers. Yet program ventures, de
nied to larger stations by the size and nature
of their financial backing, would remove the
smell which arises from musty files of phono
graph records and junk advertising. The aroma
around KQW, itself, is nearly pure, for they
have attempted in the past, and will attempt in
the future, such ventures with presentations of
Farm radio drama. Bu their example is unique.
A "Blue Jeans," might stir up radio audiences;
it might even make them think a little—although
the play is hardly rabble-rousing. But it would
justify the hours of Dr. Barker and Bing Crosby
which are sent out on the air for the remainder
of the time.—J. S.
n ND this next recording of 'Little White
jLx. Lies' is brought to you through the
courtesy of Dr. Barker, the only painless den
tist in the bay area. Do you fear to see your
dentist? Just call Occidental 2233 and make an
appointment with Dr. Barker, the only pain
less ..."
KQW officials were willing to spend over
half their air time yesterday on sustaining rec
ord programs, interspersed with such advertis
ing hog-wash, but they, like any small station in
their place, have cancelled the scheduled pre
sentation of the first act of "Blue Jeans." "Too
controversial for radio presentation," they said.
"Besides, KQW serves a Salinas audience, lo
cale of Flavin's drama, making the possibilities
of objections from Salinas Valley residents too
great for broadcast."
So instead we'll give 'em a few hours of
clap-trap advertisement spiced with a little
dance music, huh 'fellows? We don't want to
stir them up too much by talking of such nasty
things as strikes, Communism, or college rad
icals. We'll let them get in on the ground floor
of Carter's furniture sale. Give them something
to think about. And besides, the benefit they
will get from old recordings and shady adver
tisements will be so much batter than bringing
up social problems of a controversial nature.
For radio, far from living up to the great ar
tistic potentialities credited to it in the begin
ning, is now little more than a vocal bill-board.
Worst offenders are the small stations, who
fail to offer any real entertainment in return
for their advertising blurbs.
