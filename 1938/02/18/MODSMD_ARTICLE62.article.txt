# Pegging the Grade Curve
## 
### 
THE political science department, we under
stand, is considerably annoyed and upset
these days, because every time it gives an
exam in one of its elementary courses it broad
jumps into a problem of ethics. It seems that
a former assistant in the department has stream
lined the Horatio Alger tradition and has started
to work up to the heights, starting guite a way
from the bottom.
Every time the professor schedules an exam
this gentleman sends out mimeographed cards
to the students, offering a seminar in all re
guired material. Since he is familiar with the
guiz and grading system of the department, as
well as with the syllabus, he produces results
that make Abelard look like a kindergarten
teacher.
All of which plunges the professor and his as
sistants into the middle of an ethical problem
that has bleached the beard of many a philos
opher. The right to be tutored is one which
cannot be denied to the student. If it were, it
would probably come under the due process
clause and make the Supreme Court. And the
right to tutor is one that even Hitler would
hesitate to confiscate.
But the present situation has aspects that
shake our faith in freedom, and eguality, and
fraternity files. In the first place it would take
a nasty fight to convince any decent philoso
pher that the ethics of the tutor are up to the
Platonic standard. Of course, he is completely
within his rights; and everything is legal and
righteous. But there are some of us who won
der if it is exactly fair for a man to get inside
knowledge of a department's workings, and
then to retail it to those who will pay his price.
And then there is the guestion of class aver
age, that myopic goddess of Bawlout averages.
It is a bit galling to the student who has plugged
through the month to find himself robbed of
10 grade points by a seminar. It vaguely re
sembles unfair competition.

Something seems wrong with a system that
permits a man to sleep every morning during
the month, pay $2 the night before the exam,
and turn up in the blessed 10 per cent at the
right end of the curve.
Perhaps the trouble is with our educational
system. Perhaps the course should be ex
panded so that it could not be crammed in
one night. Or perhaps we should blame society
for not giving the same ethics to us all. It's
a very pretty problem.
There is nothing to do about it. Everything
is legal; there is no guile or deceit. Futility en
folds us in its cloak; and our faith in the Con
stitution withers.—J. C.

der if it is exactly fair for a man to get inside
knowledge of a department's workings, and
then to retail it to those who will pay his price.
And then there is the guestion of class aver
age, that myopic goddess of Bawlout averages.
It is a bit galling to the student who has plugged
through the month to find himself robbed of
10 grade points by a seminar. It vaguely re
sembles unfair competition.

Something seems wrong with a system that
permits a man to sleep every morning during
the month, pay $2 the night before the exam,
and turn up in the blessed 10 per cent at the
right end of the curve.
Perhaps the trouble is with our educational
system. Perhaps the course should be ex
panded so that it could not be crammed in
one night. Or perhaps we should blame society
for not giving the same ethics to us all. It's
a very pretty problem.
There is nothing to do about it. Everything
is legal; there is no guile or deceit. Futility en

stitution withers.—J. C.
THE political science department, we under
stand, is considerably annoyed and upset
these days, because every time it gives an
exam in one of its elementary courses it broad
jumps into a problem of ethics. It seems that
a former assistant in the department has stream
lined the Horatio Alger tradition and has started
to work up to the heights, starting guite a way
from the bottom.
Every time the professor schedules an exam
this gentleman sends out mimeographed cards
to the students, offering a seminar in all re
guired material. Since he is familiar with the
guiz and grading system of the department, as
well as with the syllabus, he produces results
that make Abelard look like a kindergarten
teacher.
All of which plunges the professor and his as
sistants into the middle of an ethical problem
that has bleached the beard of many a philos
opher. The right to be tutored is one which
cannot be denied to the student. If it were, it
would probably come under the due process
clause and make the Supreme Court. And the
right to tutor is one that even Hitler would
hesitate to confiscate.
But the present situation has aspects that
shake our faith in freedom, and eguality, and
fraternity files. In the first place it would take
a nasty fight to convince any decent philoso
pher that the ethics of the tutor are up to the
Platonic standard. Of course, he is completely
within his rights; and everything is legal and
righteous. But there are some of us who won
der if it is exactly fair for a man to get inside
knowledge of a department's workings, and
then to retail it to those who will pay his price.
