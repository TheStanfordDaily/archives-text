THE GENERAL
j i |N TUESDAY next the nation will observe the
j birthday of a man to whom it will probably give
j little more than a passing thought, if it gives him that
much; a man who died in 17f(9 and is deader today
than any other great figure in America's past.
For he was not a very human sort of man, General
George Washington of Mount Vernon and Virginia,
i His personality was not built, to last very long, and
140 years have worn it down until it has become al-<
most as legendary and unreal as the man himself.
Little remains to keep him alive as an individual.
There is the cherry-tree story, pipe-dream of the
| good Parson Weems. There are various odds and
I ends of information —he wore false teeth, but they
j didn't fit, and he always had a good deal of trouble
! with them. He liked to dance, doubtless in a deter-*
j mined sort of way; he loved riding.
He wore a peruke and rarely smiled. He was not
i a good speaker, but managed to convince his listeners
j by his sincerity. He always used the very best fertil
] izer, and cleared a regular profit on his plantations.
He was a gentleman and a farmer, hated public life,
and only entered it to appease his sense of duty.
4 4F HIS public record much more has come down to
us. He fought with Braddock against the Indians.
! He was a Burgess in the Virginia Legislature. He was
i given control of the Revolutionary Army by the Con
tinental Congi'ess, and fought the Cabal to keep it
from being sold out to the British. He defeated Corn
! wallis at Yorktown and won the war. He held the
i presidency for eight years, after which he retired to
I Mount Vernon to die, a thing he did two years later,
I honored and respected, and freed at last from care.
He had few close friends, but numbered among
j them the Marquis de Lafayette. He trusted Hamilton
more than Jefferson, being by nature and upbringing
an aristocrat, but strove with scrupulous honesty to
keep peace between them when they served in his
Cabinet. He never said, "Your people is a beast," nor
did he uphold a revolution every 20 years. He had
been through one revolution, and one was enough.
During his presidency he was more a balance-wheel
than anything else, giving to the government an ele
ment of stability almost as great as though he were
indeed the king his Congress had wanted him to be.
He was an honest, sincere, diligent, and humdrum
man, a brilliant military tactician who won a war and
then knew enough to build a peace. He gave America
an anchor to windward in the days when she desper
ately needed one, and on that more than anything else
his fame rests.
If he could return today he would probably deplore
the fact that his Farewell Address has become only a
sounding-board for jingos, his birthday merely the
opportunity for more political untruths. He might be
proud of his country, he might not; but he probably
would be glad that only the things which he did for it
serve to keep him alive today, and content with the
matter-of-fact veneration in which he is held.
For false teeth are not the things by which a gen
tleman should be remembered; and that is what he
seems to be saying in his portraits. No human in
terest stories for me. My record is enough.
And that is quite true. The Squire of Mount
Vernon is right. Not all the tongues in America can
shake the dignity of the man on the stamp, for he is
General Washington, the Father of His Country.
—Allen Drury.

j i |N TUESDAY next the nation will observe the
j birthday of a man to whom it will probably give
j little more than a passing thought, if it gives him that
much; a man who died in 17f(9 and is deader today
than any other great figure in America's past.
For he was not a very human sort of man, General
George Washington of Mount Vernon and Virginia,
i His personality was not built, to last very long, and
140 years have worn it down until it has become al-<
most as legendary and unreal as the man himself.
Little remains to keep him alive as an individual.
There is the cherry-tree story, pipe-dream of the
| good Parson Weems. There are various odds and
I ends of information —he wore false teeth, but they
j didn't fit, and he always had a good deal of trouble
! with them. He liked to dance, doubtless in a deter-*
j mined sort of way; he loved riding.
He wore a peruke and rarely smiled. He was not
i a good speaker, but managed to convince his listeners
j by his sincerity. He always used the very best fertil
] izer, and cleared a regular profit on his plantations.
He was a gentleman and a farmer, hated public life,
and only entered it to appease his sense of duty.
4 4F HIS public record much more has come down to
us. He fought with Braddock against the Indians.
! He was a Burgess in the Virginia Legislature. He was
i given control of the Revolutionary Army by the Con
tinental Congi'ess, and fought the Cabal to keep it
from being sold out to the British. He defeated Corn
! wallis at Yorktown and won the war. He held the
i presidency for eight years, after which he retired to
I Mount Vernon to die, a thing he did two years later,
I honored and respected, and freed at last from care.
He had few close friends, but numbered among
j them the Marquis de Lafayette. He trusted Hamilton
more than Jefferson, being by nature and upbringing
an aristocrat, but strove with scrupulous honesty to
keep peace between them when they served in his
Cabinet. He never said, "Your people is a beast," nor
did he uphold a revolution every 20 years. He had
been through one revolution, and one was enough.
During his presidency he was more a balance-wheel
than anything else, giving to the government an ele
ment of stability almost as great as though he were
indeed the king his Congress had wanted him to be.
He was an honest, sincere, diligent, and humdrum
man, a brilliant military tactician who won a war and
then knew enough to build a peace. He gave America
an anchor to windward in the days when she desper
ately needed one, and on that more than anything else
his fame rests.
If he could return today he would probably deplore
the fact that his Farewell Address has become only a
sounding-board for jingos, his birthday merely the
opportunity for more political untruths. He might be
proud of his country, he might not; but he probably
would be glad that only the things which he did for it
serve to keep him alive today, and content with the
matter-of-fact veneration in which he is held.
For false teeth are not the things by which a gen
tleman should be remembered; and that is what he
seems to be saying in his portraits. No human in
terest stories for me. My record is enough.
And that is quite true. The Squire of Mount
Vernon is right. Not all the tongues in America can
shake the dignity of the man on the stamp, for he is
General Washington, the Father of His Country.
