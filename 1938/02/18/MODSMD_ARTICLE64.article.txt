# GOIN' MY WAY

HAS nothing to do with the rainy weather we've
just had, and it doesn't prove that I don't want to
go to "Porgy and Bess," or that I'm sorry that I'm
missing "The Women," but, every now and then, I
like to read a book—a good book.
I don't mean something like Fisher's "Capital and
Income," which people tell me is a very good book—
for an economist. I mean a book which Is entertain
ing, entertaining in any of the implied connotations of
the world.
James Thurber, for example, is always good for a
few hours entertainment—even on a rare spring-in
the-middle-of-February day when you want to get
thehellout and go someplace. Best known, possibly,
for his childish-complex drawings in "The New York
er," he has written five of the funniest books published
in America. People have compared him to Robert
Benchley who is very funny in the movies and who
gets some very funny stuff in his books, and the com
parison is complimentary, I believe, to Benchley.
I like Benchley, but after you have read so many
pages of his humor, you laugh at him through reflex
action only—somewhat as you laugh at the funny pa
pers. Your soul stops being stirred. He tries too
hard, and after awhile his comical exaggerations seem
a little stereotyped.
Thurber is not only funnier, he's not tiresome. His
style isn't so conscientiously humorous and his char
acters are more natural; in a word, he's more subtle.
He probably has been thanked silently by many Eng
lish profs because his style is much less easy to imi
tate than Benchley's—and even when it is imitated,
it's not. too bad a style.
nothing that will pick you up in a shorter
time after you have found out that your date for
the night has to spend the evening rubbing ointment
on his (her) grandmother's fallen arches, than a selec
tion or two from his "The Middle Aged Man on the
Flying Trapeze," such as "Everything's Wild." or "The
Topaz Cuff-Links Mvstery."
Ask five people and you'll get five answers on
which of his books is his best. "The Owl in the At
tic. "The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze,"
and his latest, "Let Your Mind Alone," are books of
short sketches, very funny short sketches. There's
nothing quite like them. "My Life and Hard Times,"
Thurber's autobiography, will convince you that life
isn't such a husk after all.
Then you can always borrow the New Yorker and
look at his cartoons every week Jacques.
