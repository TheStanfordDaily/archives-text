"Mayerling," at the Clay Inter
national Theater in San Francisco,
tells the tragic story of a French

Romeo and a Vi
enese Juliet. Dan
ielle Darrieux, as
the Baroness Vit
sura is excellent.
Her features are
of cameo - like
perfection. Charles
Boyer is capital as
the neurotic and
handsome Prince
Rudolph as is the

rest of the cast, especially Suzy
Prim. Their tragic love scene was
persuasively haunting and slightly
reminiscent of the last scene of
"Triston and Isolde."
Anatole Litvak, who did "Tovar
ich" for Warner Brothers, directed
the picture flawlessly. He made
notable use of the pause, slow tim
ing, and sequences without dialogue.
The costumes and settings were ade
quate.
If you like to see romance with
historical background, and if you
wish to see what exquisite work is
being done in the French' studios—
sec "Mayerling." Don't hold back
because it is in French—the sub
titles aid one and the picture is so
expressive that ihc language medi
um is unimportant.—Mack.
