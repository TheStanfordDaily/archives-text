# ALWARD AGAIN

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since this seems to be open season
on Mr Alward, perhaps a few re
marks on his "Porgy and Bess" re
view are in order.
Could it, be that Mr. Alward was
sitting higher than 1 was? Could that
be the reason why he saw and
ieamed nothing more than the in
telligent theatergoer was quite
; ware of before seeing the perform
ance? Mr. Alward's criticism was
reminiscent of the Examiner's re
view which came out just in time to
make the Daily's deadline. Or was
il lifted bodily from the advance
publicity blurbs in Stage Magazine
or Theater Arts? Allen Drury, Lar
ry Livingston and Frances Slater
combined couldn't have written a
less enlightening review!
1 saw the production in New York
several seasons ago, and I must say
that all the New York tabloids con
sidered their drama critics incap
able of reviewing an opera.
On the contrary, The Daily's re
view of "The Women" was concise,
intelligent and gave the impression
that the reviewer wasn't too timid
to give his candid opinion of the
show.—Bud Arnold.
