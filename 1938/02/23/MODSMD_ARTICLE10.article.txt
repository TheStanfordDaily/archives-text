# Military Ball Band Selected
## Dance Will Feature Rhythms Of Don Kay 
### 
Don Kay, colorful band leader
who has recently been making a tour
of middle-western hotels with his
famous orchestra, has been chosen
as maestro for the Military Ball
scheduled for March 4 in the wom
en's gym.
The ball, with its reputation for
color and style, will be the last big
dance to be held on the campus be
fore finals this quarter. Known for
their atmosphere, each has left for
its successor a peak of perfection to
reach. This year's promises to be
one of the best ever given.
Speaking for Scabbard and Blade,
sponsors of the Military Ball, Don
McAusland, head of the dance com
mittee, said yesterday that decora
tions for the occasion would feature
a surprise motif, one never before
seen on the campus. The theme of
decoration will be kept a secret un
til the guests pour in on March 4.
The fact was again emphasized by
McAusland that guests at the mili
tary formal did not have to belong
to the military department. Bids
are available to everyone and are
now on sale at the A.S.S.U. offices
and from members of Scabbard and
Blade for $2.50. This year will be
the first time that bids are sold under
$3.50 a couple.
