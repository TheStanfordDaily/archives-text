### 
I)r. John Edgar Coover, 65, emeritus professor uf psychology, died
Saturday morning at his home on campus following a heart attack suf
fered several days ago.
Private services were held Monday morning at the chapel of Roller
and Hapgood.
I)r. Coover came to the University in 1010, specializing in psychological

research. His studies led him to the*
conclusion that there is no evidence
attesting to the reality of "spooks."
He once stated:
"Man was helpless when he found
that the world was not what it ap- ;
peared to be, and this accounts for
the myths and nature worship. J
There are still mysterious phenom
ena, but science is the official agent
for discovering and explaining j
them."
That the elements of all human
knowledge are based on the five
1 physical senses and an intuitive
| "sixth sense" was one of the beliefs
, held by Dr. Coover after years of
probing into psychological phenom-
I ena.
Born in Remington, Ind., Profes-
I sor Coover received his basic edu-
I cation in Pennsylvania and Kansas.
| Successively he attended McPher
i son College, Colorado State Normal,
! and Stanford in 1899. Having re
-1 ceived his Ph.D. from Stanford in
; 1912, he was appointed assistant
professor of psj'chology and fellow
iin psychical research.
I Dr. Coover perfected a "kinesthe- ]
tic method" of typing and a "note
i script" shorthand, Jthe results of
; early work as typesetter and tele
graph operator.
Professor Coover is survived by
his widow, Mrs. Margaret E. Coover,
! and a son, Calvin Ciay Coover.
