# Graduate's Novel To Be Reprinted
## 
### 
Stanford graduate Albert Guerard
Jr. last year had published in Eng
land his first novel—"The Past Must
Alter." This April will appear its
first United States printing.
"The Past Must Alter" deals with
a gambler, a woman, and a boy. "It
is not autobiographical," says first
novelist Guerard. "My father is not
a gambler." His father is Albert
Guerard Sr., Stanford professor of
literature
Penned to stave off boredom while
its author toiled at Harvard, the
novel gave him a chance to let off
spleen, reflect his moods at the same
time.
"When I got tired of studying Ger
man." be says, "I started to write °n

my book. Writing was a more re
spectable form of procrastination
than going tv a show.
"In the first few chapters, I de
scribed a modern apartment. It was
complete with every modern con
venience—even an elevator. In my
own room at Harvard, the hot water
came out cold—or not at all."
Quiet, reserved Author Guerard,
who has never tramped the streets
or starved in a garret., holds no
truck with the writer who combs
the depths in search of material.
"However, I like to pick up with
strange people," he says.
He spins with comment a yarn of
his past career. "Once I had a story
published in Hound and Horn mag
azine. I) was called "Davos in Win

ter." That year Edward J. O'Brien
gave "Davos in Winter" two stars.
The next year, the story was re
printed in The Stanford English
Club year book. That year, Edward
J. O'Brien gave "Davos in Winter"
three stars. Another reprinting, and
I suppose Edward J. O'Brien would
boost Davos in Winter' to the rank
of a minor classic.
"The idols of my youth." says the
23-year-old writer, "were Heming
way and Sandburg. Now, I try to
pattern my style after James and
Wharton."
At the moment, Guerard plans to
take an instructorship at Harvard
in the fall, write a novel about a
megalomaniac, beuin another about
a decadent Covenanteer familv.
