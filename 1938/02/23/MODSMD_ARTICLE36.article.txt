# Gault Lynn Speaks On Trust-Busting
## 
### 
Gault W. Lynn, instructor in eco
nomics, was the speaker on the
Stanford University Hour over KGO
last Monday evening. His subject
was "Trust-Busting: 1938 Model."
"No doubt the administration
contemplates some changes in the
anti-trust laws," Mr. Lynn de
clared, "but it is reasonably certain
that there will be no vigorous trust
busting campaign such as the one
conducted by Theodore Roosevelt."
