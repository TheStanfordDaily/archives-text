The Editor, Sir:
At the Lloyds of London the odds
are 10 to 1 that our World's Fair
will never open because of war!
It's time we took a deep breath
and steadied ourselves. Where are
we headed?
At first glance the most astound
ing change has taken place in our
ideas of the Chinese people. A year
ago the average citizen pictured the
Chinese as having long drooping
moustaches; and spending their time
between opium dens and gang wars,
and growing extra long fingernails in
their spare moments. Today they
are our poor oppressed brothers
across the sea.
Not that brotherly love is not a
good thing, but what caused this
change? The motion picture of Pearl
Buck's book, "The Good Earth,"
opened the way. The churches, al
ways sti'ong in missionary work, are
doing all kinds of things to assure
the Chinese that we are their
friends. One of the radio stations is
closing every night with a prayer
for "the poor oppresed peoples of
the earth."
And all this has come about be
cause our poor brothers, the Japa
nese, have a black sheep in their
family. A black sheep not unlike our
recent Huey Long. The governor
general of Korea, Jiro Minami, is
the Huey Long of Japan. Only Jiro
is much smarter than Huey, for he
shuns publicity. The emperor is
kept in the public eye. Minami gov
erns by long-distance telephone.
But how can the Japanese dictator
carry on a war if it isn't supported
by the people? (And how did Huey
Long ever manage to set up such a
strong dictatorship in a democratic
nation?) By rigid discipline Minami
has turned thousands of dissatisfied
farmers into a private army. On
February 26, 1936, 1400 of these sol
diers broke the barracks in Tokyo
and took up arms against this fascis
tic "private army." But the fascists
skillfully manipulated the revolt to
their own advantage.
On April 30, 1937, the common
people of Japan turned down the
idea of trying to seize China by an
overwhelming vote. And so they
went to war.
We Americans don't want war.
Let us watch our step, and pray to
God that tve are not the victims of
some forces that do.

the earth."
And all this has come about be
cause our poor brothers, the Japa
nese, have a black sheep in their
family. A black sheep not unlike our
recent Huey Long. The governor
general of Korea, Jiro Minami, is
the Huey Long of Japan. Only Jiro
is much smarter than Huey, for he
shuns publicity. The emperor is
kept in the public eye. Minami gov
erns by long-distance telephone.
But how can the Japanese dictator
carry on a war if it isn't supported
by the people? (And how did Huey
Long ever manage to set up such a
strong dictatorship in a democratic
nation?) By rigid discipline Minami
has turned thousands of dissatisfied
farmers into a private army. On
February 26, 1936, 1400 of these sol
diers broke the barracks in Tokyo
and took up arms against this fascis
tic "private army." But the fascists
skillfully manipulated the revolt to
their own advantage.
On April 30, 1937, the common
people of Japan turned down the
idea of trying to seize China by an
overwhelming vote. And so they
went to war.
We Americans don't want war.
Let us watch our step, and pray to
God that tve are not the victims of
some forces that do.

The Editor, Sir:
At the Lloyds of London the odds
are 10 to 1 that our World's Fair
will never open because of war!
It's time we took a deep breath
and steadied ourselves. Where are
we headed?
At first glance the most astound
ing change has taken place in our
ideas of the Chinese people. A year
ago the average citizen pictured the
Chinese as having long drooping
moustaches; and spending their time
between opium dens and gang wars,
and growing extra long fingernails in
their spare moments. Today they
are our poor oppressed brothers
across the sea.
Not that brotherly love is not a
good thing, but what caused this
change? The motion picture of Pearl
Buck's book, "The Good Earth,"
opened the way. The churches, al
ways sti'ong in missionary work, are
doing all kinds of things to assure
the Chinese that we are their
friends. One of the radio stations is
closing every night with a prayer
for "the poor oppresed peoples of
the earth."
And all this has come about be
cause our poor brothers, the Japa
nese, have a black sheep in their
family. A black sheep not unlike our
