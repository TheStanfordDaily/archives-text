# Stanford Nine To Meet Gaels On Farm Today
## Varsity Will Start Conference Season With Moragan Tilt 
### 
Forced to postpone their game with
I the Pacific Coast Greyhound nine
j Saturday because of wet grounds,
| Stanford's varsity baseballers will
j open their C.1.8.A. season this after
noon at 3 o'clock against St. Mary's
| on the Sunken Diamond.
The Gaels, prospectively one of
the strongest teams in the confer
ence last year, were the victims of
bad breaks all season long, and fin
ished fourth. This year the Mora
gans have the same material much
improved.
Coach Sheely's men expected to
give the favored California Bears
a fight for the title, started off by
| swamping Santa Clara, 10-2, Sun
' day. In four practice tilts the In-
I dians have won only one, and their
j chances in the C.1.8.A. race are
j doubtful.
