for Breakers, runners-up. This year's
meet appears a toss-up, as nearly all
of last year's winners will not com
pete this afternoon because of in
eligibility or graduation.
Today's Events
Today will see finals in the two
mile, javelin, discus, and pole vault,
and trials in low and high hurdles,
100, and 220, where needed. If en
trants in any of these latter events
are six or under, finals will be run
this afternoon.
An eligibility list has been posted
by Phil Klauber, who will be in
charge of the meet, on the Intra
mural Bulletin Board. Truck let
termen from Stanford or other four
year schools, '40 numeral winners,
and last season's J.C. letter winners
are ineligible for any events in the
meet, while some of this year's Stan
ford team have been barred from
their events by way of team mem
bership ruling.
