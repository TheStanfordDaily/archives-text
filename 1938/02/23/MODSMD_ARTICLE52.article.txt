THE LOSS TO STANFORD
WAS EXPENSIVE
The Santa Clara varsity basket
ball team had eyes too big for its
stomach Saturday night, and thereby
hangs a tale.
Coach George Barsi of the Broncs
brought to the Farm what Coach
John Bunn of the Indians calls "the
best-schooled, most efficient Santa
Clara team he has seen since he has
been at Stanford University." With
this team he started out to mop up
the floor with the Cards, and well
nigh did it, as anybody that saw the
game will agree.
However, Coach Barsi made a
mistake in working his first string
so hard Saturday night, because
that same team had to play San
Jose State for the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Basketball
Conference title Monday night,
and it didn't have quite the stuff.
San Jose State calmly and delib
erately butchered the Broncs to
take the title.
Coach Bunn said Monday after
noon, before the N.C.1.8.C. playoff,
that he figured that Stanford had
won the championship for little San
Jose State, by tiring Santa Clara.
WEEK-END VACATIONERS
MISSED SOMETHING
The last week-end in basketball
was the hottest that Stanford fans
have seen in many moons, varsity
and freshmen games included. Fri
day night the frosh came from be
hind with little Mike Marshall at
Ihe controls to nose out the Bears
frosh 51-48 in a sizzler.
The varsity game had the crowd
standing and screaming like mani
acs for the last three minutes as
Jack Calderwood sank the last
goal that gave the Cards a 41-39
win. That Pavilion was no place
for a person with a weak heart.
Saturday night the frosh, slight
ly battered and weary from the
night before, put up a brilliant
battle only to lose 4(5-45 to the
Bronco yearlifcigs. The varsity,
after using two second string men
the first half, came hack in an
overtime game to win 56-55 after
a 9-point deficit. The score at
the end of the regular game was
52-52, with the last three minutes
the wildest sort of basketball.
All in all, Stanford won three of
four basketball games, and there
was a difference of six points in
Stanford's points and opponents'
points. Stanford scored 194, the op
ponents made 188. Two games with
one-point margins, one with a two
point margin and a fourth with a
three-point margin between victor
and vanquished in two nights is the
sort of basketball that is hard on
spectators.—Peterson.

stomach Saturday night, and thereby
hangs a tale.
Coach George Barsi of the Broncs
brought to the Farm what Coach
John Bunn of the Indians calls "the
best-schooled, most efficient Santa
Clara team he has seen since he has
been at Stanford University." With
this team he started out to mop up
the floor with the Cards, and well
nigh did it, as anybody that saw the
game will agree.
However, Coach Barsi made a
mistake in working his first string
so hard Saturday night, because
that same team had to play San
Jose State for the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Basketball
Conference title Monday night,
and it didn't have quite the stuff.
San Jose State calmly and delib
erately butchered the Broncs to
take the title.
Coach Bunn said Monday after
noon, before the N.C.1.8.C. playoff,
that he figured that Stanford had
won the championship for little San
Jose State, by tiring Santa Clara.
WEEK-END VACATIONERS
MISSED SOMETHING
The last week-end in basketball
was the hottest that Stanford fans
have seen in many moons, varsity
and freshmen games included. Fri
day night the frosh came from be
hind with little Mike Marshall at
Ihe controls to nose out the Bears
frosh 51-48 in a sizzler.
The varsity game had the crowd
standing and screaming like mani
acs for the last three minutes as
Jack Calderwood sank the last
goal that gave the Cards a 41-39
win. That Pavilion was no place
for a person with a weak heart.
Saturday night the frosh, slight
ly battered and weary from the
night before, put up a brilliant
battle only to lose 4(5-45 to the
Bronco yearlifcigs. The varsity,
after using two second string men
the first half, came hack in an
overtime game to win 56-55 after
a 9-point deficit. The score at
the end of the regular game was
52-52, with the last three minutes
the wildest sort of basketball.
All in all, Stanford won three of
four basketball games, and there
was a difference of six points in
Stanford's points and opponents'
points. Stanford scored 194, the op
ponents made 188. Two games with
one-point margins, one with a two
point margin and a fourth with a
three-point margin between victor
and vanquished in two nights is the
sort of basketball that is hard on
spectators.—Peterson.
THE LOSS TO STANFORD
WAS EXPENSIVE
The Santa Clara varsity basket
ball team had eyes too big for its
stomach Saturday night, and thereby
hangs a tale.
