## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Cards Overcome Two Tough Week-End Foes 
### WALT PETERSON 
Facing what should be a fairly
easy week-end with U.C.L.A. after
two of the fastest games the Pavilion
has seen in a long while, the varsity
basketball team took a layoff from
practice Monday and Tuesday, and
will work out today.
The first squad, that is, got the
layoff. The seconds drilled against
U.C.L.A. methods. They did little
or no work in the California game,
won by Stanford 41-39 to tie for the
league leadership Friday night, and
the Santa Clara game, won by Stan
ford, 50-55, in an overtime period
Saturday night.
Not out for practice were Luisetti,
Calderwood, Stoefen, Lee, and Phil
Zonne, the first five that stopped a
vicious Bear team Friday and then
had to get in against the Broncos to
stave off defeat Saturday.
Cards Win Seven
In nosing out California the In
dians brought their conference rec
ord up to seven wins and two losses
to match the record of Nibs Price's
team. The two squads will fight it
out for recognition this week-end,
when Cal takes on U.S.C. in Los

Angeles and Stanford jogs along with
the Bruins here. ,
If Cal loses twice and Stanford
wins twice, the title will be the In
dians' for the third straight year.
If Cal splits and Stanford wins,
which is more probable, Cal will
have a chance to snake out a tie by
defeating Stanford next week at
Berkeley.
Hank Needs 42
Hank Luisetti is now only 42
points away from a new national
scoring record of 1532 points, having
scored 13 points in the Cal battle
and 17 in the Santa Clara bruiser.
He tied with Garretson of Cal for
high point honors Friday and then
was high scorer Saturday even
though he played only half the
game.
Phil Zonne caged 11 for second
honors against California, with Cal
derwood hot on his heels with 10.
Against Santa Clara, Calderwood
was second best with 16 points,
while Giannini of the Broncs
whipped in 14. Calderwood made
eight field goals, one more than any
other player.

The first squad, that is, got the
layoff. The seconds drilled against
U.C.L.A. methods. They did little
or no work in the California game,
won by Stanford 41-39 to tie for the
league leadership Friday night, and
the Santa Clara game, won by Stan
ford, 50-55, in an overtime period
Saturday night.
Not out for practice were Luisetti,
Calderwood, Stoefen, Lee, and Phil
Zonne, the first five that stopped a
vicious Bear team Friday and then
had to get in against the Broncos to
stave off defeat Saturday.
Cards Win Seven
In nosing out California the In
dians brought their conference rec
ord up to seven wins and two losses
to match the record of Nibs Price's
team. The two squads will fight it
out for recognition this week-end,
when Cal takes on U.S.C. in Los

Angeles and Stanford jogs along with
the Bruins here. ,
If Cal loses twice and Stanford
wins twice, the title will be the In
dians' for the third straight year.
If Cal splits and Stanford wins,
which is more probable, Cal will
have a chance to snake out a tie by
defeating Stanford next week at
Berkeley.
Hank Needs 42
Hank Luisetti is now only 42
points away from a new national
scoring record of 1532 points, having
scored 13 points in the Cal battle
and 17 in the Santa Clara bruiser.
He tied with Garretson of Cal for
high point honors Friday and then
was high scorer Saturday even
though he played only half the
game.
Phil Zonne caged 11 for second
honors against California, with Cal
derwood hot on his heels with 10.
Against Santa Clara, Calderwood
was second best with 16 points,
while Giannini of the Broncs
whipped in 14. Calderwood made
eight field goals, one more than any
other player.
