# In Spite of Webster

### 
PEACE, according to Webster, is absence of
war—a definition that this year's Peace
Day Committee seems to have taken to heart.
The committee met last week to consider
speakers for the April celebration and ad
journed without setting off any fireworks. This
is strictly against precedent. Last year choice
of speakers precipitated a pitched battle that
was ended only by enforced arbitration. Even
after a San Francisco editor was chosen in
a compromise session, occasional sniping was
reported.
The action of this year's committee of course
will win some backers. There are those who
maintain that peace cannot be fought for, who
see the annual propaganda barrage as worse
than useless, and who believe such a program
to be actually detrimental. Yet we hope that
the committee will cease its disregard of tra
dition.
It probably won't worry the munitions mak
ers much or cause any serious change in Hit
ler's Anschluss program if preparations for the
Stanford celebration involve a series of battles
or not. But if the party goes off as quietly as
any other university assembly, Stanford itself
will do little worrying.
For paradoxical as the annual skirmishes
were in seeming to make peace something to
be fought for, they had a sound psychological
base. Whether a campaign is being carried on
for the eradication of reckless driving, syphilis,
or war, it has to be done dramatically if it is
going to arouse interest.
At least the traditional squabbles, whether
deliberate or not, assured good attendance at
at the Peace Day meetings. And they may have
caused a few to think about peace before they
attended the meetings.
It all boils down to the fact that most human
action is dictated by emotion. We have to get
excited about a situation before we do any
thing about it. If propaganda and intra-commit
tee and committee-Administration fights are nec
essary to pump up the excitement, as the past
seems to show, let's have them. That the energy
may be misdirected later, is a chance that has
to be taken.
Besides, after football in autumn and basket
ball in winter, we have nothing to get excited
about during Spring Quarter. Why not make
it peace?
