# Get Off the Bandwagon

GOVERNMENT economists have stopped
bothering about how they are going to
check the great boom that hasn't come yet,
but Stanford's leaders are still wondering how
they can stop the current inflation in orchestras
for campus dances. More than one prophet
predicted last spring that the Farm was contra
dicting the big-name-band fever, and recently
when the Junior Prom scored over the Soph
Cotillion by getting Fletcher Henderson, the
prophets dusted off their best smug smiles.
And despite their annoying self-satisfaction,
the local oracles aren't turning in a bad batting
average. The Senior Prom now feels honor
bound to top the juniors with a bigger band.
Can the seniors afford to appear in some shabby
little bargain when the juniors have flashed that
Henderson mink coat?
Next spring the Senior Ball will find itself
commissioned to mark up the sands of time
with even more attractive footprints.
The situation has all the earmarks of inflation
ary psychology. We seem fated to go on top
ping big-name-band with glittering bigger
name-band, fated to overshadow bands that
howl like a frustrated wolf-pack with bands that
sound like a lynch riot broken up by the
militia. And for each new orchestra we pay a
higher price. Sooner or later the whole thing
will blow up like an A average meeting a
flunk on the final.
The Junior Prom made a profit that would
bring a glow to the heart of any tax assessor.
Unless the seniors get carried away from read
ing the national budget, they too should have
no reason to borrow red ink. But the number
of couples that can attend a dance is limited;
so is the price students will pay for bids. If
each band must top the last one, there will be
a crack-up somewhere along the line.
Another complication of the big-band fever
is its effect on the small dances. Last week the
Toyon Formal turned up a nasty deficit. It
couldn't compete wtih the brilliance of Fletcher
Henderson, and it couldn't dredge wallets al
ready drained by the cost of Prom bids. Every

time we have a big band, it makes it that much
harder for the small dances to keep afloat.
Sooner or later we will reach the top of the
big-band ladder. Either we will run out of bet
ter orchestras, which is doubtful. Or we will
contract for more than we can handle, step into
a deficit that compares nicely with the national
one, and settle down to watch the small dances
go on the rocks.
But sometime before we reach the top of the
ladder and step off, we might stop climbing.
The best idea would be to set a limit on the
price paid for orchestras, and the number of
big bands permitted during the year. After all,
paying twice as much won't make the rough a
better dancer.â€”J. C.
