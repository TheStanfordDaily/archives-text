# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
YESTERDAY morning I dropped around to see a
professor about a term paper that was getting a bit
mutinous and hard to handle. I toiled up the stairs,
groped down a black corridor, and finally knocked
with becoming. deference on his door, feeling some
thing of the glow that must spread over Dick Tracy
when he runs a man down after a hard chase.
I left almost immediately. The professor was mak
ing out his income tax report.
He looked at me from behind a barricade of papers,
made a noise like a menagerie bear just before feeding
time, and retreated into a thicket of printed forms,
growling softly. I was considerably surprised; I had
thought that no university paid its professors salaries
large enough to be taxable.
* * * *
But after trying to see two other professors I con
cluded that Stanford does pay taxable salaries. And
returning home to brood, like a worried parent, over
the misbehavior of my term paper, I decided that in
its salary system Stanford is missing a golden oppor
tunity. By a perfectly logical train of thought I ar
rived at the conclusion that if Stanford would cut
faculty salaries, all her problems would fade away
like a check from home vanishing through the comp
troller's window.
It's very simple. If we reduce faculty salaries, pro
fessors won't have to spend their time making out in
come tax reports. Then they can get out and be big
brothers to the students—take long walks with them,
discuss the British crisis and the beer at Beltramo's,
ask them up to Sunday night supper when the fra
ternities serve emaciated beans buffet style. Thus in
<?ne move we will solve the problem of student-faculty
relations. Friendship will blossom like a healthy dan
delion. The student-faculty relations committee can
disband and catch up on its studies. Ex Committee
need no longer finance cider and doughnuts for weekly
bull sessions in the nitery.
Ht * * *
AND if the University cuts salaries we will be able
to hire more instructors. Then we can establish
more departments teaching more subjects. Of course,
they won't teach them as well as they used to, but
that will be overshadowed by the fact that we will im
prove our position in the Foganfuss rating of American
colleges.
Besides this, with the money saved we can secure
famous men who don't do any teaching. We can let
them play about in the laboratories, and perhaps they
will discover a new kind of plant louse, or put a new
dent in the atom. Naturally they will name their
achievement after us, and so we will have the Stan
ford Memorial Dent in the Atom, which will reflect
great glory upon us, and permit us to secure more good
football players who will reflect great glory on us.
* * # #
And the presence of the venerable men with famous
names will also reflect great glory.
Quite obviously the only thing to do is cut salaries.
I took this conclusion to an old observer of college
life, and asked what he though of it. He shattered my
dream with one savage sentence. ' Hell, you fool, the
colleges have been doing that for a hundred years."

ternities serve emaciated beans buffet style. Thus in
<?ne move we will solve the problem of student-faculty
relations. Friendship will blossom like a healthy dan
delion. The student-faculty relations committee can
disband and catch up on its studies. Ex Committee
need no longer finance cider and doughnuts for weekly
bull sessions in the nitery.

AND if the University cuts salaries we will be able
to hire more instructors. Then we can establish
more departments teaching more subjects. Of course,
they won't teach them as well as they used to, but
that will be overshadowed by the fact that we will im
prove our position in the Foganfuss rating of American
colleges.
Besides this, with the money saved we can secure
famous men who don't do any teaching. We can let
them play about in the laboratories, and perhaps they
will discover a new kind of plant louse, or put a new
dent in the atom. Naturally they will name their
achievement after us, and so we will have the Stan
ford Memorial Dent in the Atom, which will reflect
great glory upon us, and permit us to secure more good
football players who will reflect great glory on us.

And the presence of the venerable men with famous
names will also reflect great glory.
Quite obviously the only thing to do is cut salaries.
I took this conclusion to an old observer of college
life, and asked what he though of it. He shattered my
dream with one savage sentence. ' Hell, you fool, the
colleges have been doing that for a hundred years."

YESTERDAY morning I dropped around to see a
professor about a term paper that was getting a bit
mutinous and hard to handle. I toiled up the stairs,
groped down a black corridor, and finally knocked
with becoming. deference on his door, feeling some
thing of the glow that must spread over Dick Tracy
when he runs a man down after a hard chase.
I left almost immediately. The professor was mak
ing out his income tax report.
He looked at me from behind a barricade of papers,
made a noise like a menagerie bear just before feeding
time, and retreated into a thicket of printed forms,
growling softly. I was considerably surprised; I had
thought that no university paid its professors salaries
large enough to be taxable.
* * * *
But after trying to see two other professors I con
cluded that Stanford does pay taxable salaries. And
returning home to brood, like a worried parent, over
the misbehavior of my term paper, I decided that in
its salary system Stanford is missing a golden oppor
tunity. By a perfectly logical train of thought I ar
rived at the conclusion that if Stanford would cut
faculty salaries, all her problems would fade away
like a check from home vanishing through the comp
troller's window.
It's very simple. If we reduce faculty salaries, pro
fessors won't have to spend their time making out in
come tax reports. Then they can get out and be big
brothers to the students—take long walks with them,
discuss the British crisis and the beer at Beltramo's,
ask them up to Sunday night supper when the fra
ternities serve emaciated beans buffet style. Thus in
<?ne move we will solve the problem of student-faculty
relations. Friendship will blossom like a healthy dan
delion. The student-faculty relations committee can
disband and catch up on its studies. Ex Committee
