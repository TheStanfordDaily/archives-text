all the boys are having fun sticking out their
tongues at their diplomatic neighbors, and throw
ing around ultimatums right and left, we would like
to get in our licks before it is too late. Briefly, we pro
pose a constitutional amendment to the effect that no
women over 45 or under 25 be allowed inside a theater
without a muzzle. There will be no exceptions made,
even for Wally Simpson or Marge Bailey.
We have come to the conclusion that this is the only
solution to a nasty problem in nuisance abatement
which the San Francisco police department hasn't had
time to look into yet. For after our experience at
"Porgy and Bess" Saturday afternoon, we are in no
mood for half measures.
It was all our fault in the first place for coming to
a matinee performance. From past experience we
know that the audience is made up almost entirely of
women, all speaking words which begin and end with
"s." It's rustle, rustic, rustic, and swish, swish, swish
all afternoon long, until some one says a naughty word
on the stage, and then there is a moment of horrified
silence. But it is only a lull before the storm of tongue
clucking and nervous giggles.
♦ ♦ * *
r J ,, HERE seem to be two types of women who attend
the performances. One is the secretary, oi* tittering
schoolgirl type. These can be counted on to come in
groups of threes and fours, giggling and chattering,
and giving vent to little squeals of "Oh look, there's
Mazie. Hel-lo Maz-ie. Look, didja see? It was Mazie."
They will sigh over the leading man. cat over the lead
ing lady, and trot out over your feet between every
act. Individually, they may be quite lovely. But col
lectively, at a matinee, whoosh!
As for our more elderly crew. No moving around
between acts for them. No sir, once seated, they arc
there to stay, comfortably and solidly, and just try to
get through to your seat. They may even take off their
shoes, for they inevitably have aching feet. They also
mention this in the course of their conversation.
It is from this matronly crew that one may get in
formation on the progress of the play, in case he would
rather do his Poli Sci, or hold hands with the girl in
the next seat. Each development is marked by loud
and complete explanations, and discussed and re
discussed until there is no doubt but that the stranger
Ls really the heroine's husband who was lost 20 years
ago at sea.
Now, about this amendment. We don't want to
appear harsh, ladies, but this sort of thing has got to
stop. Young and old, we love you all. But mend your
theater manners or we'll clamp a gag on you that will
make the Spanish Inquisition look like lnve by l,a
gUnita. . It'll, be the law Stone.
