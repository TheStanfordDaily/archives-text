# Blue Jeans' Described As Weak Drama
## 
### 
"Blue Jeans": To spar critically
with a flyweight drama like "Blue
Jeans," which appeared here Satur-

day night, is both
a little silly and
not quite cricket.
The best thing
all the way around
is to consign
'Blue Jeans" to
the pastel limbo
of mediocrity and
let it go at that.
Its leit-motif of
"lettuce strike in
Salinas sounded
like a rehash of
old news stories.
Its Communist

hero, an incurable bourgeois, began
with nothing but a set of half-baked
ideals, profited not at all from his
exposure to realistic labor methods,
and wound up with nothing to show
but a wife.
However, the audience responded
warmly enough. The fact that it
was made up chiefly of Stagers and
cast relatives is, of course, not at all
relevant.
Other than Hal Kahn's direction
and Gene Callnon's sets, there were
no better features in the show. Jack
Dawson, as the parlor-pink, was a
properly skimmed milk personality.
Geraldine Schreiber, J. P. Cahn,
Nelson Wheeler, and Harry Muheim
deserve mention of one sort or an
other. To the rest may be tossed
the mouldy compliment—"compe
tent."—Slater.
