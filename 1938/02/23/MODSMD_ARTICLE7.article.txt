# 'Bootleg' Crabs Cause Price War
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 22 (UP).
â€”A crab price war continued along
picturesque Fishermen's Wharf to
day.
Fishermen sold to the public at
record low prices to force dealers to
cease "discrimination." Spokesmen
| for the "insurgents" charged the
dealers had refused to buy local
catches but were taking fish from
Seattle and "bootleg" crabs from
Eureka.
