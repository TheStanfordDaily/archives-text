| I AVE airplanes and the supposed
effectiveness of air bombard
ments made battleships of 30,000
tons and more "outmoded"? That
controversy, over which military
theorists have waxed furious in the
past, will again receive national at
tention as Congressional opponents
of President Rosevelt's $800,000,000
navy expansion bill use the anti
battleship argument in an effort to
block the Administration's "pre
paredness" plans.
The Mouse Naval Affairs Com
mittee will he asked to suhpena
aircraft manufacturers for testi
mony, and may decide to investi
gate charges that the Administra
tion is suppressing reports of tests
showing that battleships are vul
nerable to airplane attacks.
Representatives R. E. Church (R.,
111.), and Maury Maverick (D.,
Tex.) are leading the Congressional
opposition to the proposed super

Chinese aviators took their war

hoku, capital of Formosa, and other
towns on that Japanese island and
reportedly destroyed 40 Nipponese

The raid marked the first time
that any territories of the Japan
ese territories of the Japanese
Empire proper have received air
bombardments.
On the other side of the globe, two
Spanish Insurgent cruisers were
seriously damaged in the biggest
aircraft-warship battle of the civil
war, Loyalists asserted.
JT)RITISH Laborite leaders are de
manding that a general election
be called to oust Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain because of
what they term his "dishonorable
surrender to the threats and bully
ing of fascist states," but. there are
as yet no indications that such an
election will be called.
tti unauthenticated London re
port that Adolf Hitler has agreed
to the British plan for the with
drawal of foreign "volunteers"
from Spain can be seen as a con
ciliatory measure preceding the
possible creation of a new four
power alliance of Italy, Germany,
England, and France, with Russia
excluded.
Austrian Nazis opened a political
campaign against Jews and the
"political activities" of priests
(Austria is 95 per cent Catholic),
but at the same time 1,000,000
workers pledged support to Chan
cellor Kurt Schuschnigg if he pro
tects Austria from becoming '"Ger
many's football." Schuschnigg will
give his side of his recent negotia
tions with Hitler in a speech today
which will be broadcast at 9 o'clock
Pacific time this morning by N.B.C.
The supposed political ambitions
of C.1.0. leader John L. Lewis were
hit yesterday by A. F. of L. Presi

ter of the Pennsylvania federation
charter. Four hundred thousand la
bor votes and the gubernatorial
ambitions of U.M.W.A. official
Thomas Kennedy are involved in
Green's action.

Austrian Nazis opened a political
campaign against Jews and the
"political activities" of priests
