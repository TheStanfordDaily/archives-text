# 'The Grizzly' Seeks Trouble At Stanford
## 
### 
To ferret out Farm problems for
an article in their new publication,
members of U.C.'s "Grizzly" staff
yesterday quizzed Stanford organiza
tions.
Designed to air views on current
problems, the "Grizzly" hopes this
month to feature an article by Cali
fornia's President Robert Sproul,
outlining a plan for the general re
organization of college curricula. Dr.
Sproul's point will be that non
professional education should be far
less specialized.
A staff of 30 California students
has signed up under Editor James
Kenny to publish the monthly, fi
nanced by the A.S.U.C. and taking
over the subsidy of the defunct lit
erary magazine, "Occident," ex
plained Richard Hurwitz, manager,
who visited the campus yesterday.
The "Grizzly" will be cut to the
proportions of the "Pelican," will
feature 32 pages, and have a smooth
paper cover.
