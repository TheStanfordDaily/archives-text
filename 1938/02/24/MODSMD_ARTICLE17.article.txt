## 
### 
Y\ ASHIN(» lON, Feb. 2.» (UP). —President Roosevelt today transmitted
to Congress the report of his advisory committee on education, recom
mending new federal school grants to states beginning at $70,000,000 in
1939 and increasing to $199,000,000 by 1944.
The grants would be designed to correct "glaring inequalities" and

I "bring education out of the doldrums.
I The report, based on more than a<
year of exhaustive study of schools I
! throughout the country, said "the
public school system in the United
States greatly needs improvement."
Inequalities Told
"Glaring inequalities characteriz
ed educational opportunities and ex- 1
penditures for schools throughout I
the nation. The level of educational I
service that can be maintained un- J
der the present circumstances in ]
many localities is below the mini- ;
mum necessary for the preservation !
i of democratic institutions," the com
i mittee said.
The report criticized administra
[ tion of federal school funds and j
; recommended that the statutes be j
! "thoroughly revised" to make ex- ;
1 isting grants, now approximating!
! $50,000,000 a year, available for "all
I desirable types of occupational i
preparation."
Increases Urged
Too much federal control is now
exercised over federal vocational j
funds, amounting to approximately
$22,000,000 a year, the committee re
ported. "Pupils in vocational schools
are sometimes exploited for private
| gain," the committee said.
The committee recommended fed
eral school grants to states increas
! ing as follows: $70,000,000 for the
1939-40 fiscal year; $109,000,000 for
1940-41; $139,000,000 for 1941-42;
$159,000,000 for 1942-43; $170,000,-
000 for 1943-44; $199,000,000 for 1944-
45.

mending new federal school grants to states beginning at $70,000,000 in
1939 and increasing to $199,000,000 by 1944.
The grants would be designed to correct "glaring inequalities" and

I "bring education out of the doldrums.
I The report, based on more than a<
year of exhaustive study of schools I
! throughout the country, said "the
public school system in the United
States greatly needs improvement."
Inequalities Told
"Glaring inequalities characteriz
ed educational opportunities and ex- 1
penditures for schools throughout I
the nation. The level of educational I
service that can be maintained un- J
der the present circumstances in ]
many localities is below the mini- ;
mum necessary for the preservation !
i of democratic institutions," the com
i mittee said.
The report criticized administra
[ tion of federal school funds and j
; recommended that the statutes be j
! "thoroughly revised" to make ex- ;
1 isting grants, now approximating!
! $50,000,000 a year, available for "all
I desirable types of occupational i
preparation."
Increases Urged
Too much federal control is now
exercised over federal vocational j
funds, amounting to approximately
$22,000,000 a year, the committee re
ported. "Pupils in vocational schools
are sometimes exploited for private
| gain," the committee said.
The committee recommended fed
eral school grants to states increas
! ing as follows: $70,000,000 for the
1939-40 fiscal year; $109,000,000 for
1940-41; $139,000,000 for 1941-42;
$159,000,000 for 1942-43; $170,000,-
000 for 1943-44; $199,000,000 for 1944-
45.
