# Councilmen Hold Shortest Session
## 
### 
In one of the shortest meetings in
j the memory of those on Men's
j Council, members snapped through a
series of routine cases to finish to- !
day's session without any serious j
business.
Although the majority of the sen
tences handled were traffic cases, i
the trouble experienced for some
time during the past with parking !
in the auditorium turning base ap- j
pears to be over.
