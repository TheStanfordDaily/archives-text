# Gilkey Speaks On Democracy
## Chicago Dean Seeks Students" Support 
### 
An appeal to America's students to
turn their colleges into places where
the democratic method is taught was
made by Dean Charles VV. Gil key of
the University of Chicago before
approximately 60 students and fac
ulty members at the Luncheon Club
yesterday noon.
"The institution of democracy has
never been more widely challenged
or more definitely on the defensive
than it is today," Dean Gilkey said.
"Our forefathers were sure that de
mocracy was the perfect form of
government, but today skepticism is
wide-spread and has penetrated
every phase of American life."
Taking for his subject "The Faiths
That Undergird Democracy," Dean
Gilkey explained the three steps
which he feels democracy has gone
through since its inception: the early
idealistic optimism, greatly influ
enced by the works of Rousseau; the
second reactionary school which
viewed democracy simply as a piece
of government mechanism; and the
current trend which he feels will
soon regard democracy as a method
for life.
"Democracy is an adventure in
faith—faith in undeveloped ca
pacity cf the common man; and faith
in the democratic method, the demo
cratic way of working out our prob
lems," said Dean Gilkey. "This
makes us sensitive to the rights of
minorities and individuals; and it
demands patience in the handling of
our problems for it is the method
of conference, understanding, and
co-operation."
Explaining that he felt the first
shock of recent attacks on democracy
was past, he said that it had produced
one favorable result in the tremen
dous revival of interest, among all
groups, in the basis of our de
mocracy, which he noticed in all
sections of the country.
Dean Gilkey will deliver the ser
mon in the chapel next Sunday and
will hold a special student service on
Sunday afternoon before leaving the
University.
