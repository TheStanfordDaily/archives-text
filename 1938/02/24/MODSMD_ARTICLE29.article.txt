### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 23 (UP).—
Filming, broadcasting, and recording
for news reels of criminal trials and
other court proceedings were op
posed today by the Los Angeles Bar
Association in a resolution sent to all
municipal and superior court judges
in the county.
Such practices, the board of trus
tees contended, "militate against the
dignity of court proceedings" and
often "embarrass and humiliate wit
nesses." It was pointed out similar
resolutions have been adopted by
the American and state bar associa
tions.
ARCADIA, Feb. 23 (UP).—Today,
with a substantial edge in weights,
was favored for today's sixth race
feature as turf fans still talked about
Stagehand's victory yesterday.
