# Journalism Division Plans Five Year Background Course for M. A. Degree
## 
### 
To provide more fully for a pro
gram of education for journalism,
rather than for a training course in i
journalism was given yesterday by j
Dr. Chilton R. Bush as the purpose |
of a recently adopted five-year cur- j
riculum in the Stanford Division of j
Journalism.
Dr. Bush, executive head of the
division, announced the adoption of
the five-year plan Inst week. Un
der it, the master of arts degree in
Social Sciences-Journalism v/ill be
awarded to students who complete,
with a high average, a program
which includes five specific fields in i
the social sciences and 45 units in !
journalism.
Students now majoring in (he di- '
vision will not be affected by the
new plan, Dr. Bush emphasized. The |
bachelor of arts degree in Social
Sciences-Journalism will be given
for the next two years, at least.
Later, students contemplating only
a four-year course may take jour
nalism subjects, but will get their j
bachelor's degree in Social Sciences.
Candidates for the master's degree
will choose five of the following j
fields:
Economic history, money and [
banking, international trade and
finance, public finance, labor prob-r
lems, problems of public utility reg
ulation, social psychology, social j
problems, comparative government, ;
public administration, international
law and relations, public law, po
litical parties and politics, and po
litical and social philosophy.
"The division," Dr. Bush said, "is
interested in supplying good news
papers with well qualified men."

The change, he believes, will en
able the division to provide a wider
background of cultural studies.
Only 15 per cent of the courses will
be in journalism.
One of the criticisms of schools of
journalism, he said, is that they give
too much technical training which
can be more quickly learned in
actual newspaper practice.
The present Stanford Division
gives only 10 to 12 hours of tech
nical training, he pointed out, and
this will not be increased. Rather,
training in technique will be ac

quired through a practice course in
volving work on San Francisco \
newspapers and other actual expe
rience.
An arangement under which stu
dents could Work for a full year
between ►heir fourth and fifth years
may be worked out, Dr. Bush said, i
They would be selected lor the fifth
year work both on their record in
the division and on the newspa
per. In any case, at least three j
months practial experience will be j
required of fifth year candidates.
Some technical training, however, |
is necessary in the college, Dr. Bush
asserted.
Students are given a better start j
when they go to work, if they have
such training, he saiti, and it gives '
the division some basis for judging
the aptitude of the individuals for
journalism. It also stimulates the
student's interest in the profession to
do sbme practical work While
studying the more theoretical as
pects of newspapers.
Two courses and sometimes a sem
inar normally will constitute the
specific fields required outside jour
nalism, Dr. Bush said. The require
ment of certain fields, instead of
courses, insures that the student will
achieve some mastery of his spe
cializations, he believes.
The five-year program is differ
ent from the "graduate school" sys
tem in that the Stanford plan per
mits the department to control the
student's 1 program for the entire five
years, Dr. Bush said.
Juniors who elect journalism for

vised to plan a five-year program,

The present Stanford Division
gives only 10 to 12 hours of tech

this will not be increased. Rather,
training in technique will be ac

quired through a practice course in

newspapers and other actual expe
rience.

may be worked out, Dr. Bush said, i
They would be selected lor the fifth
year work both on their record in
the division and on the newspa
per. In any case, at least three j
months practial experience will be j
required of fifth year candidates.
Some technical training, however, |
is necessary in the college, Dr. Bush
asserted.
Students are given a better start j
when they go to work, if they have
such training, he saiti, and it gives '
the division some basis for judging
the aptitude of the individuals for
journalism. It also stimulates the
student's interest in the profession to
do sbme practical work While
studying the more theoretical as
pects of newspapers.
Two courses and sometimes a sem
inar normally will constitute the
specific fields required outside jour
nalism, Dr. Bush said. The require
ment of certain fields, instead of
courses, insures that the student will
achieve some mastery of his spe
cializations, he believes.
The five-year program is differ
ent from the "graduate school" sys
tem in that the Stanford plan per
mits the department to control the
student's 1 program for the entire five
years, Dr. Bush said.

PROFESSOR CHILTON R. BUSH
He announces a new five-year
curriculum for the Division of
Journalism.
To provide more fully for a pro
gram of education for journalism,
rather than for a training course in i
journalism was given yesterday by j
Dr. Chilton R. Bush as the purpose |
of a recently adopted five-year cur- j
riculum in the Stanford Division of j
Journalism.
Dr. Bush, executive head of the
division, announced the adoption of
the five-year plan Inst week. Un
der it, the master of arts degree in
Social Sciences-Journalism v/ill be
awarded to students who complete,
with a high average, a program
which includes five specific fields in i
the social sciences and 45 units in !
journalism.
Students now majoring in (he di- '
vision will not be affected by the
new plan, Dr. Bush emphasized. The |
bachelor of arts degree in Social
Sciences-Journalism will be given
for the next two years, at least.
Later, students contemplating only
a four-year course may take jour
nalism subjects, but will get their j
bachelor's degree in Social Sciences.
Candidates for the master's degree
will choose five of the following j
fields:
Economic history, money and [
banking, international trade and
finance, public finance, labor prob-r
lems, problems of public utility reg
ulation, social psychology, social j
problems, comparative government, ;
public administration, international
law and relations, public law, po
litical parties and politics, and po
litical and social philosophy.
"The division," Dr. Bush said, "is
interested in supplying good news
papers with well qualified men."

The change, he believes, will en
able the division to provide a wider
background of cultural studies.
Only 15 per cent of the courses will
be in journalism.
One of the criticisms of schools of
journalism, he said, is that they give
too much technical training which
can be more quickly learned in
actual newspaper practice.
