"How are things coming on the
Cubberley Building?"
"Fine, one hundred per cent," was
the answer given by John Levers,
in charge of construction, "the good
weather helps a lot."
"Now that the arches in front are
finished and the stone work in gen
eral is up to the second floor, we
will be able to go much faster. The
stone work is slow, tedious, but.
delicate work requiring time and
skill."
"The terrace next to the libe is
almost finished and ready for the
cement. The ruffing of pipes and
plumbing is done and the laths on
the first two floors ready and wait
ing for plaster."
