BERKELEY, Feb. 23 (UP).—Dis
appearance of the American Feder
ation of Labor, "because of its weak
and anemic spirit," was forecast here
yesterday by Dr. Henry Kendall
Booth, pastor of the First Congre
gational Church of Long Beach.
Speaking to 500 ministers at the
18th inter-denominational pastoral
conference, Rev. Booth said the fed
eration "has become so inci'easingly
cautious and conservative under
Green that the edge of the labor
front struggle has become blunted."
"The vertical rather than horizon
tal, industrial rather than craft un
ionism, is inevitable in labor," Booth
added.
In the U.S., cotton is planted any
where from March 1 to June 1 and
picked from July 10 to late in the
winter depending on locality.
