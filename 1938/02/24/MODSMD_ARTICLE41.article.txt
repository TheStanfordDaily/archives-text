## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 23 (UP).â€”
Automobile traffic on main high
ways of the Sierra Nevadas moved
more freely today as clear weathei
supplanted protracted storms.
The California state highway pa
trol reported the Truekee-Tahoe City
highway open. Tahoe City residents
were isolated for days by moun
tainous snowdrifts. The road was
not officially open to travel, how
ever, because snow plows were on
their way back to Truckee.
The Donner summit nignway was
open to all traffic. Chains were not
mandatory, but signs were posted al
icy points.
