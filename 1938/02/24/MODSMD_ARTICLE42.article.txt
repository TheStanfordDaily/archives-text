With the completion of another
veek-end of basketball in the Big
Tan conference in the Mid-West,
t'.e standings find Northwestern and
! urdue in a tie for the lead, with
: ven victories and two losses
aiiece.
The fact that Stanford and Cali
iarnia are tied for the lead of the
outhern division on the coast
with seven and two immediately
: prings to mind as a direct coin
arison; and a little further in
\ estimation brings to light several
( her comparisons that are inter
c ..ling.
instance, Northwestern in its
nine league games has an offensive
average of 154 points a game. Purdue
h: :> averaged 39 points a game. Now,
S anford in nine games has scored
an average of 52 points which is
jui.t 13 points better than the co
k . der of the Big Ten.
In all fairness, it must he said
iat Purdue doesn't have the best
offensive average of its loop, for
Wisconsin, which is not among the
!!rst three of the Big Ten, has
veraged 42 points for nine con
. sts. Still Stanford has an edge
<.i' 10 points there, having scored
J)' more in the same number of
t ie games than have the Badgers.
Defensively speaking, Michigan
has allowed 30 points per game for
th 3 best average of the Big Ten.
California leads our conference with
an average yield of 35, which gives
the Mid-Westerners a 5-point edge
in that department.
The range between top and bot
tc .1 teams in the Big Ten' as far as
offensive goes is 87 points. That is,
the highest scorer, Wisconsin, has
lie ;red 87 points more than the low
en' scorer.
The southern division shows a re
n. rkable departure here with Stan
■ < ; d having scored 205 points more
Lb.tn U.C.L.A. These two teams are
the highest and lowest scorers, re
spectively.
The defensive range in the
s uthern division of the coast con
ii.rence is- 93 points, between Cal
a .d U.C.L.A., while the Big Ten
his a defensive range of 112 points.
iat speaks a little in favor of the
t >ast from one standpoint, but it
>esn't sound so good when it is
remembered that 10 teams play in
l ie Big Ten, and four in the
: iiithern division.
However, the general conclusion
to be reached from all these statis
ti< sis that the Big Ten shows more
0 iservative play, and hence lower
j ores. The southern division fea
-1 res the most open collegiate bas
1. tball played in the country to
(' y, and the high scoring reflects
i. it mode of play.
Schools of the Mid-West and
I ast are devotees of the standard
..vies of play that basketball
• iarted out with—the close man
l )-man defense and the plodding.
Methodical offense dominated by
(he good old set shot. A set shot
i; the two-handed shot from a
olid two-footed stance anywhere
irom 10 to 40 feet from the basket.
The old style method was con
s rvative—the teams using it were
p i.sitively shocked when Stanford
; rived in New York two years ago
with a wild, reckless offense led by
liinty Moore, Hank Luisetti, and
Lowell Turner, and a peculiar de-
I use that violated all rules of con
: rvatism.
There are probably more thrills
lor the spectator in the coast species
(.!' basketball, which might be given
i ; a reason for the great interest
t.tken in Stanford's basketball team
l.y New York and other Eastern
bins.—Peterson.
