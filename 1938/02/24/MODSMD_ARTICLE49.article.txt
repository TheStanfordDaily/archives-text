# Cards Stress Speed; Bunn Okays defense
## 
### 
Fully satisfied that the Stanford defense is capable at the present time
of stopping anything Caddy Works and El Bruin may offer. Coach John
Bunn yesterday stressed speed—and plenty of it.
The Stanford basketballers, on the crest of their 1938 efficiency wave,
had orders from the Chief to "keep it moving all the time."
And that's the way the practice went —lots of pepper, fast passing,

with an extra dose of "ginger" in the«
ball handling. It was one of the
most ambitious workouts the Pa
vilion has seen in many a day.
Washington Ahead
In the meantime, Don Liebendor
fer, the master statistician, came
forth with news of the northern di
vision teams.
It seems that the race up there
may end in a four-way, three-way,
or two-way tie. It's as close as all
that.
Right now, Washington State is
on top, having lost one game less I
than Oregon and Idaho, who are |
tied for second place. And hanging !
on to the tail-feathers of those two
teams, with just one more loss, is
Washington. Rather a tight race.
Cards Should Win
So it's very much up in the air as j
to the team which will meet the
southern division winner for the j
conference crown.
For that matter, the southern di
vision crystal ball isn't exactly clear.
IF Stanford wins two from U.C.
LA., and Southern California takes
both games from Cal, then the Cards
are in—the last Big Game won't
change the name of the southern
division winning team, even if the
Bears do win. But . . .
Point For U.C.1..A.
IF Stanford wins two from U.C.
LA., and U.S.C. and Cal split their
series, THEN the Bears have a
chance of coming out with a tic—
if they knock over the Laughing
Boys on March 4. Then a play-off
game will be necessary.
That, however, is all in the future.
It's the Bruin games that are in
teresting the Indians now, and when
those are over, there will be plenty
of time to start forecasting.

are in—the last Big Game won't
change the name of the southern
division winning team, even if the
Bears do win. But . . .
Point For U.C.1..A.
IF Stanford wins two from U.C.
LA., and U.S.C. and Cal split their
series, THEN the Bears have a
chance of coming out with a tic—
if they knock over the Laughing
Boys on March 4. Then a play-off
game will be necessary.
That, however, is all in the future.
It's the Bruin games that are in
teresting the Indians now, and when
those are over, there will be plenty
of time to start forecasting.
