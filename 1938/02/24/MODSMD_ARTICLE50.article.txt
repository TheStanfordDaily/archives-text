# Frosh Tracksters Set For Meet
## 
### 
Despite weakness in both sprints
and distance, a small turnout for
more events, and a definite lack of
practice because of recent weeks of
rain, Coach Bill Ellington's frosh
track men will face one of their
strongest opponents of the year
when they meet a San Mateo J. C.
team here Saturday afternoon.
Stanford's hopes rest on a small
group of improved performers, in
cluding Sid Hays in the hurdles,
Allen Grey in the shot, Warner
Clark in the 440, and Jim Lincoln in
the high-jump, as well as on Bill
Ellington's ability to pull something
out of the fire with what at present
seems mediocre material.
