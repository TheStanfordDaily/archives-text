# Frosh Nine Aim For Win Over Castlemonters
## 'Cootie' Thompson Pitches Fine Game With 14 Strike-outs 
### 
Determined to wipe out the mem
ory of Tuesday's defeat at the hands
of Santa Rosa J. C. the frosh nine
will move out on the diamond this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock to tame the
threats of Castlemont Hit>h.
Yesterday's practice was concen
trated on an attempt to smooth over
the intield bobbles that cost them
the first game. A round dozen err
ors, mostly in the infield, kept the
squad from capitalizing on "Cootie"
Thompson's 14-strike-out. pitching
in the J. C. tilt.
In spite ol the heavy stick work
expected of the Cards, only two hits
were gleaned off a pair of jaysee
hurlers. Herb Bull, shortstop and
lead-off man hit safely twice, once
filling the bases and laying the
foundation for the combination that
finally put Howie Ruth across the
plate for the Farm's lone tally.
Stanford's long chance died in the
last half of the third inning when,
with bases full and one out, Jim
Rogers, J. C. hurler, struck out two
Farm batters in a row on nine
pitched balls. Santa Rosa came back
in the first half of the next inning to
mark up three of their runs when
faulty infield handling let a trio of
base runners slip in.
This afternoon's game is liable to
be a very different story. Now that
the flurry of the first game is over,
the nine can settle down- and really
iplay ball. Castlemont High can
boast of no pitchers equal to the
ones that humbled Encina batters
Tuesday, and with more support in
the line of base hits, the Card pitcher
will have more chance to keep the
highschoolers from solving his de
liveries.
A starting lineup is still tentative.
Most of the nine that started the
J. C. game will see beginning action
however. Thompson, who stayed
nine innings in the pitcher's box
during the debut, may not start.
Whether Monte Pfyl will get the
call over rival team mates for the
beginning pitcher honors is not cer
tain, but it seems between him and
Thompson for the post.
