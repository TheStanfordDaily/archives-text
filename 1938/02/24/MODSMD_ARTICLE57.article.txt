# Frosh Cagers Resume Drills
## Burness Will Be Out Until Final Contest 
### 
Following a luxurious two-day
layoff, Stanford's frosh hoop team
swings back into practice this after
noon with a light workout slated.
Coach Wytze Gorter, with only
three games left on his team's 21-
game schedule, put the Papooses
through a half-hour scrimmage
Monday and then gave them Tues
day and yesterday off to lick their
battle wounds, incurred during the
rigors of a tough schedule.
Burncss To Rest
Don Burness, ace center, who has
been troubled with a bad case of
"shin splints," will take things easy
until the final game of the season
with Cal March 5. Burness wasn't
out for Monday's scrimmage and
will limit his activity today to
throwing a few foul, shots. In spite
of his injured foot, he turned in an
outstanding game against the Santa
Clara frosh last Saturday night, re
bounding spectacularly and scoring
10 points.
Friday night the frosh tangle with
Polytechnic High School, and Fresno
High provides Saturday night's
competition. Neither team figures
to beat Stanford and the Gortermen
are leveling for their finale against
the Bearcubs.
Reserves Please
Particularly encouraging to Gor
tcr last Saturday was the play of
three of his reserves. With the first
string tired and battered after Fri
day's tough Cal game, the reserves
had to be called upon to stem the
Colt attack. They not only did this,
but also provided the spark for a
thrilling last-half rally that left
Stanford just short of victory.
Bill Rumbley, Tiff Denton and
John Alltucker were the heroic subs
and between them they accounted
for 10 points. Rumbley will be
playing against his old mates from
Fresno High come Saturday eve
ning.
