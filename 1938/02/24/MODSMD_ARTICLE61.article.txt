# W.A.A. Change Votes Change In Award Plan
## 
### 
A concrete plan for changing the
i award system of women's sports
! was laid before the Board of the
[Women's Athletic Association yes
! terday and was adopted by a two
| thirds majority.
The new plan will make a radi
! cal change in the award system now
|in use. At present, there are three
{ranks of awards, a numeral, a
| blazer, and a red blanket with a
j block S on it. There has been strong
| feeling, however, among * A.A.
i members, that this system is
| bersome and hard to administer.
The new system adopted by the
Board provides for one award only:
j a gold miniature representative of
the sport in which the student has
I been most active.
