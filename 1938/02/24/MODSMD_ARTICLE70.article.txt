# Woods Places Second In Meet
## Card Fencers Ready For Tourney Friday 
### 
Stanford s four man delegation to
the Junior Foils Individual Tourna
ment held in San Francisco Feb. 18,
placed one man second in the entire
meet and reached two semi-final
berths.
Westman, Cal ace, took top honors
for the meet from Ed Woods, Farm
fencer, by the narrow margin of one
point. Herb Wooley and Merton
Davies reached the semis only to
lose there. Dick Meyerhoff, fourth
Card representative did well for his
first year of competition. Consider
ing thai there were 27 entries in all
and that to reach the finals three
rounds of five or six bouts had to be
fenced, the field was fast and close,
and even reaching the semi-finals
difficult.
In placing second in the meet,
Woods became eligible for the Pa
cific Coast finals which will be held
in Los Angeles in April between
Junior Foils winners of the coast
meets.
Friday another Card squad will
go to San Francisco lo enter the
Junior Foils Team competition.
Consisting of Woods, Wooley, De
Benneditti, and Davies as alternate,
the team is rated a good chance to
take the meet.
