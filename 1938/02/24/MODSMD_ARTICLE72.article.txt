# Bucks and the Bawlout
## 
### 
AS spring quarter registration and the in
evitable visit to the cashier's window
draws near, Stanford's athletes are beginning
to wonder what the Buck of the Month Club
scholarship grab-bag is going to bring them.
Of course, the fact that the boys at the gym
are worrying doesn't set them apart from the
rest of the student body. Most of us start wor
rying at about this time of the year, when it
dawns on us that we have to do a quarter's
work in three weeks. But the athletes are not
worrying about studies alone. In fact, our
scholarship set-up may makfc them think it in
advisable to bother too much about class work.
As it is now, the man who works too long on
his studies may stand a chance of losing his
scholarship.
At present Buck of the Month Club funds pay
tuition fees for about 35 of our athletes. Choice
is made entirely on a basis of athletic ability and
financial need. Scholarship is not considered.
The coaches of major sports make up prefer
ence lists, and if candidates prove really in
need, scholarships are distributed from the top
down. Object of making awards in this way is
to keep the best players with us, and encour
age the boys to put forth greater effort.
But the system seems to have other results.
The same emphasis that is placed on athletics
tends to be taken off scholarship. The line
plunging half-back knows that if he stays up
studying he won't be able to hit the dummy
as hard the next day, and so he has a reason
for going to bed.
And there is another way in which our award
system unintentionally crowds studies into the
corner. The Buck Club makes its choices on a
basis of need. If a man is plus in the Bawlout,
he can take out a tuition note, but if he is minus,
the gates of credit are locked against him. A
scholarship, which is free, is much more desir
able than a tuition note, which must be paid
back in legal tender.
This means that for doubtful athletes there
may be an incentive to go minus. Then they
cannot be expected to take out tuition notes.
There is no way of telling how much effect this
influence has. But it must be hard for a sec
ond-string man to resist the temptation, when
he is afraid he can't pull a scholarship on the
basis of ability alone.
Supporters of the present set-up tell us that
if we put any limits on the favors we give our
athletes, the naughty, naughty colleges with no
cthics will take them all away from us. But it
isn't unreasonable to believe that a minimum
scholarship requirement for athletic awards
could improve class-work without undermining
our whole athletic system.
We might lose a couple of disgruntled backs;
and we might drop a few more games. But we
wouldn't find our teams wiped out.
The Buck Club scholarships perform a great
work. But colleges were founded with a schol
astic objective, and it seems a little inconsistent
to make the awards without considering studies
at all. Perhaps if the Club would take scholar
ship into account it could be sure that its awards
serve two purposes.—J. C.

The same emphasis that is placed on athletics
tends to be taken off scholarship. The line
plunging half-back knows that if he stays up
studying he won't be able to hit the dummy
as hard the next day, and so he has a reason
for going to bed.
And there is another way in which our award
system unintentionally crowds studies into the
corner. The Buck Club makes its choices on a
basis of need. If a man is plus in the Bawlout,
he can take out a tuition note, but if he is minus,
the gates of credit are locked against him. A
scholarship, which is free, is much more desir
able than a tuition note, which must be paid
back in legal tender.
This means that for doubtful athletes there
may be an incentive to go minus. Then they
cannot be expected to take out tuition notes.
There is no way of telling how much effect this
influence has. But it must be hard for a sec
ond-string man to resist the temptation, when
he is afraid he can't pull a scholarship on the
basis of ability alone.
Supporters of the present set-up tell us that
if we put any limits on the favors we give our
athletes, the naughty, naughty colleges with no
cthics will take them all away from us. But it
isn't unreasonable to believe that a minimum
scholarship requirement for athletic awards
could improve class-work without undermining
our whole athletic system.
We might lose a couple of disgruntled backs;
and we might drop a few more games. But we
wouldn't find our teams wiped out.
The Buck Club scholarships perform a great
work. But colleges were founded with a schol
astic objective, and it seems a little inconsistent
to make the awards without considering studies
at all. Perhaps if the Club would take scholar
ship into account it could be sure that its awards
serve two purposes.—J. C.
AS spring quarter registration and the in
evitable visit to the cashier's window
draws near, Stanford's athletes are beginning
to wonder what the Buck of the Month Club
scholarship grab-bag is going to bring them.
Of course, the fact that the boys at the gym
are worrying doesn't set them apart from the
rest of the student body. Most of us start wor
rying at about this time of the year, when it
dawns on us that we have to do a quarter's
work in three weeks. But the athletes are not
worrying about studies alone. In fact, our
scholarship set-up may makfc them think it in
advisable to bother too much about class work.
As it is now, the man who works too long on
his studies may stand a chance of losing his
scholarship.
At present Buck of the Month Club funds pay
tuition fees for about 35 of our athletes. Choice
is made entirely on a basis of athletic ability and
financial need. Scholarship is not considered.
The coaches of major sports make up prefer
ence lists, and if candidates prove really in
need, scholarships are distributed from the top
down. Object of making awards in this way is
to keep the best players with us, and encour
age the boys to put forth greater effort.
But the system seems to have other results.
