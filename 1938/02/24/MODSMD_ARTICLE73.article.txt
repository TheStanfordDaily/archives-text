# Fatigue Duty
## 
### 
OF ALL the problems which beset us today,
the one which leaves the most white space
between our eye-brows and hairline is the mat
ter of what to do about "that tired feeling."
And, if we can believe the promises of Uni
versity of Minnesota doctors, relief is in 3ight,
and we can stop this constant worry which
keeps us awake nights. They have launched
an extensive study to determine the causes of
fatigue.
The question seems pretty to the boys,
but there's no doubt in our mind as to why
we're tired. It's just a matter of how much
time elapses between slipping between the
sheets and the rude shock of having the cov
ers pulled off by the wake-up man.
And, from an amateur's viewpoint, the scien
tists seem to be barking up a wrong tree or
Iwo in seeking the answer to their problem.

They have put a few human guinea pigs on
bicycles; after pumping furiously, the subjects
coast while assistants bustle about measuring
the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled.
It's not bicycle riding that gets us down. It's
those 8 o'clocks, stiff typewriter keys, consci
entious gym instructors, and treks from the end
of the Row to the B.A.C, that leave us in a
state of exhaustion. We don't want to appear
sissies, but it seems to us that the professors
should start doing something about all those
attacks on our muscular cells, and leave the
bicycle riding alone.
Finding the cause of fatigue is well enough.
But it's finding out what to do about it that in
terests us. We will await breathlessly the re
sults of the Minnesota study. But while holding
our breath, we think we will continue to follow
our layman's solution and go to bed.—J. S.
