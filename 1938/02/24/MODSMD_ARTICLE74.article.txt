BELLWETHER VS. THE SYSTEM
Vf/'HILE returning to the Quad for a 1 o'clock class
one rainy afternoon last week, I was surprised to
see coming toward me the haphazard figure of my
friend Emery Bellwether, walking sedately along one
of the rows of red tiles. At first I thought he was going
to ignore me altogether, but after a moment he paused
and said, "Hello!" in a somewhat defiant manner.
"Hello," I said. "If it weren't 1 o'clock, I'd swear
you were going home for lunch."
He gave me what he fondly fancies is a disdainful
look.
"It may interest you to know that that is exactly
what I am doing."
"But why? Don't they serve at your place until 17"
"They serve at 12:15. I eat at 1. Does it annoy you?"
"You needn't get touchy, Bellwether. It just makes
me curious, that's all."
"It's very simple."
"Not for me."
"It would be if you had any brains. My day just
runs differently from yours. I start classes at 9 in
stead of 8, I finish them at 1 instead of 12, I cat at 1:15
instead of 12:15. See?"
"Frankly, Bellwether, no. How do you manage
to get classes arranged that way? I don't remember
any classes running from 12 to 1."
"There are plenty of them in the Time Schedule.
They're listed as 11 o'clocks, I believe."
"But if you go at 12 aren't you more or less alone?"
"I regret to say that so far my method of attending
classes has received little popular support. I go at 12.
No one else does."
"In other words, you go one hour late to every
thing?"
"You catch on very quickly."
"But supposing you attend an 8 o'clock in the same
room with what other people think is a 9 o'clock. Then
what do you do?"
"I study for my 8 o'clock. Teachers never bother
me, even when they lecture."
"Well, Emery, I admire your courage, but—"
"I simply decided I wasn't going to get up at 8
o'clock any more during Winter Quarter. It's a bar
barous hour, and I refuse to humor the University
any longer. I had hoped to serve as an encouraging
example to my fellow students, but so far I have
pioneered alone. Hope, however, sustains me. And
now I must be off. It's almost 1:15. Time for lunch."
And he walked sedately away.
I stared after him speechless, quite convinced that
any morning now, while on my way between classes,
I will see in some empty room along the Quad the
lonely figure of Stanford's most rugged individualist,
grimly attending an 8 o'clock at 9, sternly giving his
all in a vain attempt to defy the System.—Allen Drury.
