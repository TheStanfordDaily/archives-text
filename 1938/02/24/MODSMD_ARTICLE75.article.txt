I>ADIO has always been a product of the people,
and its programs arc geared to the least intelligent
and artistic of the mass. But one type of program has
been introduced in the last year or so which is not
slanted to what the people know, but what they don't
know—a good example is Professor Quiz question
and-answer program. As long as the professor can
convince the people that what they don't know won't
hurt them, the program is quite successful. But he
has been developing an arrogant attitude of late which
is very similar to that, of a university test-grader.
It's all very well to sit around and discover that you
don't know four countries whose names start with Z,
but the professor's tone of voice when the poor sucker
before the mike bogs down—just as you have—just
sets your teeth on edge. But even more annoying is
his triumphant "You're ab-so-lute-ly right!" when the
little miss from Pawtucket succeeds in naming the
continents which arc bounded by the Indian Ocean.
When all the time we knew the answer without half
trying. Sounds as if it was the question which was
puzzling philosophers for the last thousand years.
* * * «
! can almost hear the good Professor's trium
phant chuckle when he stumps the contestants, and
the mental pat on the back when one of his proteges
stumbles on the right answer. But all joking aside,
the program all returns to the old fire-side days when
grandma and grandpa and all the neighbors used to
| sit around telling riddles for forfeits. And it's sur-
I prising how much you discover that you don't know.
The program is pretty good fun. But if Professor
Quiz could hear his nasty cracks when he asks an un
fair question, or crushes a wrong answer with a smug,
"No, I'm sorry. That is not correct, Miss Shoebuckle,'
he would pull in his horns a bit. It is especially an
noying when you've made a wrong guess yourself;
and because of the inner nature of mankind which
hates to be wrong, the Professor has received many a
punch on the nose by mental telepathy.

Another program—or rather it is the handling of
the program—which annoys us a little, is the NBC
symphony hour with Toscanini in the chair. We have
no fault with the music or the idea, but it is in dis
tinctly bad taste for NBC 1o blow their own horn
I every time they turn around. You can hear them lift
; ing their hats and fingering a balance sheet every time
j they mention Toscanini. We certainly appreciate the
| expense they have gone to in bringing the orchestra
! and the maestro to us. But their plugs for NBC -
I how they searched the world for great musicians, and
j their cheap publicity on Toscanini himself—is in very
, bad odor. The music is the thing, not how much it cost,
i or what Toscanini says to his wife at breakfast.
NBC has done a fine thing in sponsoring the pro
gram. but the toot of their horn is :i falsi- noli* in 11n*
| symphonic harmony. Stone.

The program is pretty good fun. But if Professor
Quiz could hear his nasty cracks when he asks an un
fair question, or crushes a wrong answer with a smug,
"No, I'm sorry. That is not correct, Miss Shoebuckle,'
he would pull in his horns a bit. It is especially an
noying when you've made a wrong guess yourself;
and because of the inner nature of mankind which
hates to be wrong, the Professor has received many a
punch on the nose by mental telepathy.

Another program—or rather it is the handling of
the program—which annoys us a little, is the NBC
symphony hour with Toscanini in the chair. We have
no fault with the music or the idea, but it is in dis
tinctly bad taste for NBC 1o blow their own horn
I every time they turn around. You can hear them lift
; ing their hats and fingering a balance sheet every time
j they mention Toscanini. We certainly appreciate the
| expense they have gone to in bringing the orchestra
! and the maestro to us. But their plugs for NBC -
I how they searched the world for great musicians, and
j their cheap publicity on Toscanini himself—is in very
, bad odor. The music is the thing, not how much it cost,
i or what Toscanini says to his wife at breakfast.
NBC has done a fine thing in sponsoring the pro
gram. but the toot of their horn is :i falsi- noli* in 11n*
| symphonic harmony. Stone.
I>ADIO has always been a product of the people,
and its programs arc geared to the least intelligent
and artistic of the mass. But one type of program has
been introduced in the last year or so which is not
slanted to what the people know, but what they don't
know—a good example is Professor Quiz question
and-answer program. As long as the professor can
convince the people that what they don't know won't
hurt them, the program is quite successful. But he
has been developing an arrogant attitude of late which
is very similar to that, of a university test-grader.
It's all very well to sit around and discover that you
don't know four countries whose names start with Z,
but the professor's tone of voice when the poor sucker
before the mike bogs down—just as you have—just
sets your teeth on edge. But even more annoying is
his triumphant "You're ab-so-lute-ly right!" when the
little miss from Pawtucket succeeds in naming the
continents which arc bounded by the Indian Ocean.
When all the time we knew the answer without half
trying. Sounds as if it was the question which was
puzzling philosophers for the last thousand years.
