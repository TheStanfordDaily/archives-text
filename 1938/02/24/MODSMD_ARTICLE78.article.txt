# 'UNFAIR' TO STAGERS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We fully appreciate and sanction I
the right of fair criticism and indi
vidual opinion, and realize that it
is entirely up to the discretion of
The Daily who shall comprise the
staff of the dramatic reviewers.
But in fairness to ourselves, we
sincerely request that Frances Sla
ter not be sent' to review any
Stagers' shows. We believe her
thoroughly incompetent to handle
the job. It is not that we object to
her chronic dislike for any and all
shows. Drury, Stone, and Alward
have certainly raked us over the
coals in their time, but in doing so
they at least have shown some power
of observation, ' critical discrimina
tion, appreciation, and understand
ing of wh«it drama is all about.
Slater does not.
A case in point is today's review
of "Blue Jeans." If she believes
"Blue Jeans" was a "toss-up," medi
ocre, weak in story and acting, good
in direction and setting, she is en
titled to that opinion.
But of the six-and-a-half-inch
review, three inches were legitimate
opinion, two-and-a-half inches said
absolutely nothing, and the remain
der—the remark about the audience
— was deliberate and malicious
falsification.
Statements of that kind indicate
neither fairness nor intelligence, and
so we sincerely hope you will abide
by our request. Sincerely,
—Stagers.
