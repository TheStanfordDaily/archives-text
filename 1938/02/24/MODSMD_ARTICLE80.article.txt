# 'Caleb Stone' Tops One-Act Play Program
## 
### 
By two slender one-acts presented
last night by the Division of Speech
and Drama hung a soothing and al-

together unmo
mentous evening.
More stage -
worthy, less talky
than "The Nurs
ery Maid of Heav
en" which pre- {
ceded it, Martin
Flavin's "Caleb
Stone's Death
Watch" Jiad a few
really capital
comedy moments.

In the latler, an old man lies dy- !
j ing, while his greedy kin hang about !
waiting for him to die. Unfortun- I
ately, the promise of this scene in
which the grim reapers clot at his
j bedside dwindles steadily as the play
progresses.
However, at the outset, sparse
! lines and perfect lazy timing eased 1
the audience into an almost em- i
I harassing intimacy with Caleb
| Stone's family. That Kathleen
Campbell, Onyet Watson, Gordon
Williams, and Kay Kloster were
family stereotypes is unmistakable.
But their familiarity was often too
I pointed to breed contempt.
"The Nursery Maid of Heaven,"
i crippled by its long-windedness,
1 nevertheless carried moments of
archaic beauty. Melba Rae Toombs'
| Sister Benvenuta was a touching i
| and lucid portrayal. But more
I sharply defined, and more subtle was
Phyllis Corson's young novice who j
| shies at the ascetic life.
The two plays will be presented
again tomorrow and Saturday nights.
