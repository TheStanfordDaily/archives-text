### 
HOLLYWOOD. Feb. 23 (UP). -
Two robbers staged a panicky finale
to a Hollywood nightclub show early
today by whipping out guns, cow
ing 50 patrons, and shooting the pro
prietor to death because he reached
lor the money too slowly.
Harold A. Thompson, M, was shot
down, a bullet through the Jieart,
behind the bar of his night club on
Northwestern Avenue.
The young bandits posed as pa
trons and had several drinks while
the floor show was in progress. They
appeared intoxicated or under the
influence of drugs.

Insurance statistics show there is
a death by accident every five min
utes.
