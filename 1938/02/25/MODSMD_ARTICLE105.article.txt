## 
### 
Spring is here, almost, unci already
fashion experts in Paris and London
have released new styles for the
coming season. Even for the select
few who still wear hats, the connois
seurs on clothing have indicated the
proper head wear to don on any and
all occasions from rooster fights to
the Artist's Ball.
Society horsemen who expect to
attend (he United Hunts Steeple
Chase at Belmont Park should wear
either a black derby or a black Ty
rolean hat. For n pleasant afternoon
of riding or hunting, experts call for
a black derby, a tall silk hat, a
rider's cap or an old felt hat.
Hunting Hats
Hats for shooting vary according
to the type of hunting. For moose
and deer in the North Woods, a red
cap should be worn for safety. When
tiger shooting in India, the sports
man should wear a pith helmet for
protection from the sun. Grouse arid
partridge hunting in Scotland call
for a Scotch t weed shooting hat, and
trap shooting demands a Tyrolean
hat, preferably in the new shades of

[green, olive, myrtle, and epinard.
t For an afternoon at the Atlantic
j Beach Club, nothing is more fitting
'than a coconut straw hat with pug
garee band, and for sailing at St.
Tropez a knitted blue and white
skullcap or white linen sailor's cap.
j Replacing the Panama hat for spring
and summer wear is the new Jippi-
Jappa straw hat with blue and white
I pleated band.
For Winter Sports
Those intending to take in a few
j winter sports while they last, should
j include among their clothing either
| an authentic Tyrolean hat with cord
' band and rabbit brush or a blue
| gabardine ski cap with earlaps.
For business wear, the Homburg,
I the true Tyrolean or semi-Tyrolean,
the pork pic or the old-fashioned
j derby arc most appropriate, and in
the evening tall silk hats or black
jHomburgs are specified. The only
(occasion for which fashion experts
j have not named a type of hat is
j fishing. For angling, connoisseurs
! say you can wear what you please.
