## Cords, Jeans Dinged, White Shirts Upheld For Campus Wear 
### 
Women, what do you think of the
j clothes worn by Stanford men?"
This was the question asked a
representative group of women in
Roble, Laguniia, and two sorority
houses.
The results were significant, if a
j bit varied. But the majority opinion
j was that great progress has been
made since the day of the Stanford
I "Rough."
Most of the women favored clean
white shirts. They especially hate
sweaters worn without shirts.
One Lagunita woman said she
didn't like blue jeans, "especially
when they fit too well." This opin
ion plus a pet hate for dirty cords
was expressed by the majority.
Some (bought the men's clothes
were fine. As one Deegce expressed
it, "The men's clothes are swell Ik--
cause thev are so informal and
casual-looking." But one of her sis
ters contradicted with, "Too smoolh.
Shades of the Stanford rough!"
Supporting this opinion a Robleite
thought "they try too hard to be
gentlemen. If (hey weren't so in
terested in (heir appearance, Ibey
I might be more like men."
One Chi O evidently doesn't, think
I they arc very smooth, for she asked,
' Don't any of them own business
suits? They are the best for Quad
look at (be Eastern colleges!"
There wasn't much comment about
ties, although one woman remarked,
j "Ties look rather peculiar with
dirty cords and dirty shirts."
The freshmen generally approved
Stanford men's attire. One said that
she likes the sport clothes they
wear, but doesn't like the beards
that go with them.
