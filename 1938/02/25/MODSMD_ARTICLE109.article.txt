# Compose Suit Regains Favor
## 
### 
The compose suit, which includes
contrasting fabrics and colors, is
news this season in both dressmaker
and man-tailored suits of which
an equal number arc being sold.
Paris is wearing scarves of various
kinds with all dressy suits, and so
all the new ones are appearing
without collars which are replaced
by beads, scarfs, or some other
touch of originality. Broad shoul
dered effects are being modified, but
there is still a definite shoulder ac
cent.
A herringbone tweed jacket worn
with a navy gabardine skirt illus
trates the tailored compose suit.
These as well as monotone suits
should be worn with contrasting
accessories so that the result is al
ways a three-tone ensemble.
