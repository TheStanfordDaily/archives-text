the Watteau colored blouses, and
dress up your tailored suit with a

new blues, yellows, pinks, and
purples. Don't be surprised to see
the Gibson style blouses revived in
plain and striped colors. They can be
worn with a skirt to make a dress
or as a plain blouse for a tailored
suit.

with color rampant.

sateen stripes set far apart on a
white broadcloth background, and

handkerchiefs to match the shirt
