# Paris Advises Makeup Blend
## Powder, Lipstick Shades Must Blend 
### 
From Paris (his spring conies the
j ultimatum: Harmonize your make
up! Powder and lipstick shades
! should blend together harmoniously,
and all cosmetics, from the founda
tion through eyeshadow to the final
touch of lipstick should blend with
the colors of your costume.
When Alix Ruby and Blue Moly
neux Grain Yellow and Chalk Blue
were selected at the Paris openings j
i as the four best spring colors for j
| American women, four complete
makeups to match these colors were
1 drawn up.
It is even possible to have nail
i polish to match your personality; at
! Saks, in New York, Peggy Sage will
| select and blend different shades of
polish into a nail varnish that is ex
| clusively and individually yours,
i (hat. blends with your "aura," per
i sonality, and wardrobe.
Eyes are most important; there |
are many new tricks for accentu- j
| ating them. For blondes, a bit of I
I blue or green eyeshadow on the i
I center of (he lids will make them j
I seem almost transparent, as if the 1
i color is shining through. A touch of
! rouge under the eyebrow will give j
! your face a lift.
No matter how many springs I
j you've passed, the annual flare of
| excitement over a new spring dress j
j and a new spring hat never dies
down.
