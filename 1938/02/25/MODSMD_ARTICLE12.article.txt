# F.T.C. Reports Boost In Costs
## Commission Blames Monopolies For Rise 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”
The Federal Trade Commission soon
will inform President Roosevelt that
monopolistic and price-fixing prac
tices have sharply boosted the cost
of living, it was learned tonight.
The commission began a nation
wide investigation of food and cloth
ing prices on Nov. 16 at the request
of Mr. Roosevelt, and will file a
formal report about April 1.
The report, some sections of which
have been drafted, will assert:
1. That price-fixing and monopo
listic practices, against which the
chief executive has ordered a con
certed drive, have hiked living costs
in many lines.
2. That the Miller-Tydings Act
permitting price-fixing contracts be
tween manufacturers and retailers
and between manufacturers and dis
tributors of standard brand goods in
states with fair trade practice arts,
contributed materially to the in
creases.
In asking the inquiry, Mr. Roose
velt cited instances of what he called
"unwholesome methods of competi
tion." In consequence he is expected
to make the report a part of a spe
cial message on business practices.
Administration leaders doubt that
legislation based on the findings can
be prepared before next year be
cause it will take the Department
of Justice considerable time to com
plete its recommendations for re
vision of the anti-trust statutes.
