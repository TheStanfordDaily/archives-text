# Encina Window Blinks 'Welcome'
## 
### 
Encinamen delight in painting
their class numerals about the
hall. Latest innovation is Herbie
Wyman's electric sign, which in
termittently flashes "Welcomeâ€”
'41 from his fourth floor win
dow.
Originally a beer-parlor adver
tisement, the sign was discovered
by Wyman's "Stanford-consci
ous" uncle, who remodeled it
into a striking window display
which alternately forms the
words, "Welcome" and '"41."
