# One-Acters To Repeat Tonight
## Two Performances Slated For Week-End 
### 
Two one-acts, set for repeat per
formances tonight and tomorrow at
8 o'clock in the Little Theater, have
been mourned on the same set.
For Thomas Wood Stevens' miracle
drama, "The Nursery Maid of Heav
en," props are shifted on the stage
to transform a medieval cloister into
a nun's cell.
In Martin Flavin's "Caleb Stone's
Death Watch," two clerks, played by
Quentin Warren and Ralph Parr,
comment from heaven behind a scrim
lowered across one half of the stage.
Directed by H. Miles Heberer,
Flavin's comedy features Hoke Rob
erts as the key character surrounded
by a greedy family which includes
Kay Campbell, Onyet Watson, Kay
Kloster, Dap Holtom, and Gordon
Williams.
The young nun of Steven's drama
is portrayed by Melba Rae Toombs,
supported by Phyllis Corson, Kae
Kalenborn, Elinor Steventon, Janet
Goldstein, and Eloise Lambert.
