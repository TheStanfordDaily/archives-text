# Anderson Captivates Farm Concert Goers
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
A great singer came to Stanford
last night, and when she left, she
left behind an audience profoundly
moved by the most thrilling Concert ;
Series program in many years.
There is very little one can say i
about Marian Anderson, other than !
that she is wonderful, that her voice j
is beautiful, superbly handled, and ;
magnificent. All the technical com- I
ments have been made, all the gen- I
eral compliments have been repeal - !
ed over and over until they have be- |
come mere statements of facts which
no one can refute.
Opens with Schubert
Her program began with a series
of concert numbers, mainly Schu
bert. These progressed through
"Fruhlingstraum" and "Der Tod und ;
das Maechden," reached a climax
in the ever-popular "Ave Maria,"
which may have been sung before,
but certainly has never been sung
with more feeling and beauty.
"O Don Fatale" from Verdi's "Don
Carlos" followed, and after it an
other group of shorter numbers, in
cluding Sadero's "Amuri, Amuri"
and "Finnish Sailor's Song" by Ve
hancn.
Spirituals Featured
The last group, and two of the en
cores, consisted of spirituals: "Peep
River," "Heav'n, Heav'n," "Crucifix- !
ion," and "My Soul's Been Anchored
in the Lord." For a litle while Miss
in the Lord." For a lfttie while Miss
all, but her whole people, singing
their gallant, unhappy songs.
Of the evening there remains the
memory of a wonderful voice and
an artist whose gracious presence
proved that she is not only a great |
singer, but a great person as well. I
