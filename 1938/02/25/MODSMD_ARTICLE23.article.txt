# Indian Squad Favored In Bruin Games
## Uclans Long Shots To Pull Surprise In Conference Tills 
### Harry Press 
Ate the Cards stacked liiÂ«H
enough? C;m the Laughing Boys
tone down El Bruin's challenge to
a mere snarl?
There are thousands of basketball
fans who will laugh raucously at
those questions, but there is one
long chance that the answers to
both queries will be "No!"
And that long shot is based on a
precedent something that should
never be broken, according to both
Ex Committee and John Bunn'.s
boys.
The precedent is this: No south
ern division team has ever gone

through a season without winning
at least one game.
U.C.L.A. has three more games to
play, two of which are against,
Stanford, tonight and tomorrow
night in the Pavilion. Student body
cards will admit students.
To dale, Caddy Works' quintet
hasn't taken a game. Odds are very
much against its changing form this
week-end. If El Bruin reverses his
mind, he may toss the conferencc
race into a terrific tangle. But it's
much easier to say that a team will
win a couple of games than it is ac
tually to win them.
Indians Speed It Up
So, to toss out even this long shot
chance, Coach John Bunn has this
week injected the Laughing Boy.s
with speed and more speed. They
haven't practiced too strenuously,
but the work they have done has
been fast.
In their last workout before the
U.C.L.A. series, the Indians prac
ticed their shooting eye, taking it
easy before the battles.
Hank's Due Tonight
Sometime tonight or tomorrow
night two basketball scoring records
undoubtedly will go the way of all
good records.
Captain Hank Luisetti now has
172 points in 9 conference games.
He needs 37 markers to break his
own record of 208 points for 12
conference tilts, hung up last season.
Toward the national mark of 1531
points, Hank has chalked up 1400
digits, leaving a deficit of 42 to
knock over this mark.
Bruins Just Fair
Mr. Works will make the trip
north with a first .string of five fair
to-middlin' basketballers. The
starters will be Munkers at center
he's a whip at hook-shots; Hays and
Calkins, forwards; Montgomery and
Rafalovich, guards.
The Bruin offense stresses pass
ing, and waiting for an opening. Bill
the main difficulty is that the pass
ing is done mostly in the center of
the court. And that isn't close
enough to the basket to do any good,
as El Bruin's scoreshcet shows.
Troy Mect.s Cal
At the same time. Cal moves down
south to meet U.S.C. The Trojans
have an "awful mad" on, and arc
planning lots of revenge for the bad
time they had in the first pair against
the Bears.
