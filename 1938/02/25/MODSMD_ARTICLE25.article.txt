### 
SHANGHAI, Friday, Feb. 25.
(UP). —Chinese again were thrown
into wild excitement today by re
ports that Chinese planes had
bombed the city of Kagoshima in
Japan proper and had started a ser
ies of fires.
The reports apparently were in
correct, however, as the Japanese
Domei News Agency said that none
of the raiding Chinese planes which
left Central China airports for Japan
yesterday reached their objectives.
The fire in Kagoshima, Domei
said, was of accidental origin and
started in a family home in Ibushi
ward. It spread to 300 other houses
which were destroyed, leaving 800
families homeless.
Another rumor, widely circulated
in Hankow, was that the Chinese
planes merely had flown over Japan
proper to spot locations for future
bombing raids. One Chinese light
bomber was said to have flown over
Tokyo.
All of Southwestern Japan proper
and the southern Japanese island of
Kyushu were kept in "a state of
alarm" following an official Japanese
announcement that 12 mysterious
Chinese planes were located yester
day by air raid detection devices.
The Formosan government general
in Taihoku last night announced
lhat the "all clear'' signal had been
given for that district and that the
Chinese planes apparently had re
turned to their base without at
tempting bombing operations. It
said the planes were last located to
the northeast of Formosa. Air de
fense forces throughout the Japan
ese Empire were on the alert. Air
raid signals were sounded in such
big cities as Nagasaki and Yama
guchi.
