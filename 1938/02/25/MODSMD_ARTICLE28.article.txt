# Models to Display Styles Next Tuesday
## 
### 
To the strains of Freddie Nagel's
orchestra, Betty Hails, the Stanford
bride, will march down the aisle of
the Memorial Hall Tuesday in a
bridal gown wearing a headpiece of
butterfly orchids.
Her attendants, Betty Baker, Dot
Brookman, May 800 La Rue, Peggy
Naylor, and Audrey Brumfield,
dressed in pink, will carry deep red
carnations. The groom and his at
tendantsâ€”well, that must remain a
mystery until the day of the show.
In other words, on Tuesday Stan
ford women will present their first
Spring Fashion Extravaganza schol
arship benefit.
With the Memorial Hall as its
background and leading San Fran
cisco department stores presenting
the fashions, the show will be the
largest Stanford women ever have
attempted.
Climaxed by the complete bridal
scene, the show will feature three
divisions: sport clothes, including
play suits and bathing suits; street
and afternoon; and dinner and eve
ning clothes.
Upon the success of this show de
pends the future of, the Stanford
women's scholarships. This is the
first time a satisfactory way has been
found to raise money for a scholar
ship and if it is a success, it will be
come a tradition at Stanford, ac
cording to Wilina Richardson, com
mittee chairman.
The support of the stores showing
the fashions has been enthusiastic
and they are presenting their very
latest styles, some of which have
not yet arrived from New York.
The stores presenting clothes are
Ransohoff's, Liebes', City of Paris,
and Livingston's, all of San Fran
cisco; and Roos Bros., Carolyn JCel

sey's, and The Clothes Closet of
Palo Alto.
Flowers are being donated by
Sheridan and Bell in San Francisco.
