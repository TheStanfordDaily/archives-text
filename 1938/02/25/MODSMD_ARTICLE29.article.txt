# Women's Gym To Buy Suits
## School To Provide Co-eds' Uniforms 
### 
Having met with President Ray
Lyman Wilbur's approval, plans by
which (he Women's Gym will supply
gym classes with uniforms are now
nearly completed. The new system
will be effective next fall.
"The lack of uniformity of cos
tumes—which usually include a too
wide variety of flowered and striped
playsuits—and the delays which have
been experienced in past quarters in !
having outfit orders filled satisfac- 1
torily and promptly are the main '
reasons for the new plan," said Mrs. \
Maud Knapp, gym director. "In the |
past we have had to wait as long as !
five weeks for dance costumes."
When the plans become effective, 1
students will be charged a fee of $5. '
Of this $2.50 is the regular syllabus I
fee. Upper division students, how
ever, may continue to use their own ;
suits, and pay only the $2.50 syl- i
labus. The suits will be laundered
every second week by the gym, *
which will result in a total saving for
students in spite of the added fee.
President Wilbur has appropriated
funds to execute the new plan. The 1
gym department estimates that it
will require about two years to pay
for the suits, with the laundry bill
alone amounting to $3000 a year. I
Even though the plan was not in- !
troduced to be a money-making
proposition, the department does I
hope to profit by it in the course of
time.
