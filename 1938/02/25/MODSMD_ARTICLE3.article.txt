No Apples Polished

new," he said. "No one will think
it's apple-polishing."

each automobile. Meyer urged those
going to register today or early next
week at the A.S.S.U. office so that
transportation arrangements can be
made satisfactorily.
A full program has been scheduled
to give the two groups a good op
portunity to ski and bull-session to

Program Full

include novice races for prizes, and
instruction by Sigi Engel and Hannes

Meyer predicts optimum skiing
conditions for the week-end. No
crust on the snow and clear weather
should make conditions favorable
for beginners, he said.

$1.25 for members of the Ski Club,
he said. Club membership allows
half rates on upski and rented
equipment and 50 cents for the
