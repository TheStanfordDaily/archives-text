# Card Ruggers Play Olympic Club Tomorrow
## Indians To Defend Cal Rugby Union Championship At 2:30 
### 
Stanford's varsity ruggers start
the final drive in defense of their
Northern California Rugby Union
championship tomorrow when they
meet the Olympic Club at 2:30
o'clock in the Stanford Stadium.
In fourth place behind the Univer
sity Club, California and the Olym
pic Club, respectively, according to
present standings, the Indians need
a victory tomorrow and on succes
sive Saturdays against U.S.F. and
California to remain in the title run.
The Olympic Club, always a strong
contender in the Northern Union,
this year boasts one of the most
powerful teams in recent years. The
Olympians are composed mostly of
former California and Stanford star
ruggers, and their spark plug this
year is Joe Vigna, former Card rug
by captain and football player.
In two starts thus far, the club
team has blanked both opponents,
swamping the Argonauts, 23-0, and
U.S.F., 17-0. Stanford is also de
feated in five games, although tied,
3-3, by the University Club and
U.S.C. while downing the Argo
nauts, 27-0 ! , U.C.L.A., 12-3, and
Santa Barbara State, 9-6.
Coach Jim Wylie, in practice ses
sions this week, stressed getting the
ball out of the scrum in which the
Indians were completely outplayed
by the Trojans last week. The few
times that the fast Card backs did
get the ball they ran for long gains.
Particularly effective in the back
field were Hampton Poole and Buck
Van Dellen, two newcomers to the
squad. Both were spearheads in the
Indian offense aud together with
Fullback Lymie Calkins stemmed
Trojan threats all afternoon.
If the Stanford forwards get the
ball out of the scrum so that the
backs can spring into the open, the
Indians should have little trouble.
In five games they have yet to be
scored on via the ground route.
Every point made against them so
far has been by free kicks.
In a second game, Stanford's un
defeated junior varsity will make its
third start of the season when it
meets the Olympic Club second
team following the varsity main
event.

A vast "scintillating screen" of
metal bangles will add a symphony
of sound and shimmering light to
the Golden Gate International Ex
position in 1939.
