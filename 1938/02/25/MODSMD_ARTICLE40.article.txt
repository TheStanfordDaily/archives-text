The all-southern division basket- |
ball team won't be selected by the
coaches until after the Stanford-
California game March 4, and pos
sibly later than that, if a playoff is
found necessary between the Cards 1
and the Bears.
And when it is selected, there will
be the same old trouble that there
has always been—it will be impos
sible for one school to put four men, |
perhaps even three, on the first
team.
This is a touchy subject, and must
be handled with kid gloves.
To gel down to bedrock., it would
appear that Stanford has at least
three men who arc just about the
best in the southern division this
year, while the other three schools
have players who are very effec
tive but not quite so brilliant.
Captain Luisetti's right to a first
place on the all-loop team must be
unquestioned for the third straight
year. There just isn't or hasn't been
a player like him in these parts.
Phil Zonne, while not quite so high
in the scoring race as Ralph Vaughn
of U.S.C., is a superior floorman, has
the edge in height and therefore on
rebounds, and has shown remarkable
aggressiveness this season. He rates
the call over Dougery and Chal
mers of California, who are good,
very good, but somehow lacking the
potential brilliance of Zonne. May
be this is all wrong—maybe they are
better than Phil, but this is only one
man's opinion.
Jack Calderwood at guard has
shown himself as the finest guard
in the league, notwithstanding the
fine work of Dornsife of L'.S.C. and
Cal's Garetson and Goldenson.
Dornsife would rate the edge over
the Cal stalwarts in Slants' winter
book quotations for the other
guard. Goldenson was boomed as
an ail-American when he suppos
edly stopped Luisetti in the first
Cal game, but he stopped Hank
because Hank wasn't interested in
going past .him. The proof of the
pudding came in the second game,
when Goldenson stood on his heels
countless times and watched Hank
go by.
There will be a big hullabaloo
when it comes to selecting the center
of the team, for Stoefen of Stanford,
Carlisle of California, and Anderson
of U.S.C., three seniors, are eligible.
Stoefen had some lousy basketball
in his system this year, but he also
put on some of the prettiest play in
the loop.
Carlisle is a steady, stubborn
player, his team's leader. Anderson
is possibly more consistently good
than the others, but his persistence
in playing as close to the rules as
possible might well count against
him. There's also this Dale Sears of
Troy, a sophomore who shows
plenty of promise but still doesn't
have quite the class of the vets.
Of the Stanford first five only
Lee is not mentioned in the list of
contenders. For general finesse he
is the best guard in the confer
ence, and Coach Bunn has had
little kick about his mistakes all
year. However, his height has hin
dered him tremendously—it's the
old argument about a good big man
I being better than a good little man .
In the Cal games Garetson and
! Carlisle were too much for Beebs on
1 rebounds. They had the weight and
the height, and that counts. Just
the same, any coach would hesitate
before refusing a player of Lee's
i ability.
This list of general conclusions
I about southern division hoop players
i leaves U.C.L.A. out in the cold, but
then the Bruins have been in the
cold all through the conference any
way, so they shouldn't mind a little
bit later thaw. There'll come a day,
though, when U.C.L.A. will have a
basketball team, too.—Peterson.
