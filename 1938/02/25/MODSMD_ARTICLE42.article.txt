# Two Games On Deck For Frosh Hoopmen
## 
### 
The beginning of the end is near for Stanford's frosli basketball team,
with two of its final three games on tap this week-end. Tonight the Pa
pooses tangle with Polytechnic High School and tomorrow evening Fresno
High furnishes the opposition. Both contests are preliminaries and will
start :>.t 6:30 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Suffering from a bad case of "shin splints," Don Burncss. ace yearling

center, will be held out of both'
games unless the competition gets
too hot. Coach Wytze Gorter hopes
to have Burness in top shape for the
season's finale against Cal next
week-end and has been giving him
the rest cure for his foot.
John Alltucker, 6-foot 2-inch re
serve, will move into Burness's
starting position. Alltucker makes
up for his inexperience with ag
gressiveness and . rebound ability.
He was one of the subs who starred
against the Santa Clara frosh last
week-end.
Tonight Poly invades the Pavilion
with a well-balanced, if not brill
iant, team. Sid Kevicli, center, is
the star of the Parrot quintet with
his all-around shooting and rebound
work. Fred Bacigalupi, a clever for
ward, and Gus Mota, an accurate
shooting guard, are also prominent
threats and are capable of sparking
Poly to an upset win. Bob Kelly, a
fighting forward, and Red Fredson,
a tall guard, complete the visitors'
starting team.
Fresno coached by Irwin
Ginsberg, boasts of a small, inex
perienced team, but in Craig Ken
nedy the valley squad possesses a
cocky dead-eye who is liable to
break up any game.

Grizzly bears are disappearingâ€”
there are only 670 left in the United
States, according to a government
report.
