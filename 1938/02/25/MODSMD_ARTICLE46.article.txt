# Freedom by Intolerance
## 
### 
THERE is one sure method to give a univer
sity professor the colly-wobbles, and that
is to talk about taking away his intellectual
freedom. The recent move in Nazi Germany
to control thought have made scientists and
teachers here, as elsewhere, as jittery as a
bridegroom an hour before the wedding march.
Take Professor Franz Boas, noted anthropol
ogist and professor emeritus at Columbia Uni
versity, who recently voiced this fear. In an
article, "The Death of Freedom," printed in the
Independent lournal of Columbia University,
he said:
"It seems to me that the time has come —and
has come long ago—when we ought to cease
sending students into this unhealthy atmos
phere (Nazi Germany) and we should no long
er extend a helping hand to those German
student emissaries who are sent for the pur
pose of promoting Nazi ideas in our country."
From any scholar, and particularly one as
eminent as Professor Boas, this statement is
shocking to those brought up in an atmosphere
of unrestricted thought. But Professor Boas'
statement only crystallizes the attitude held by
a large group in the United States today.
In the name of intellectual freedom, this
group proposes intolerance. They would give
.he magic gift of such freedom to those already
possessing it, but deprive less fortunate schol
ars from ever breathing its pure air.
Even further, they would break off all con
lact between free and unrestricted intellectual
groups for fear of contamination. This, it seems
to us, is directly opposite to all tenets of inter
national understanding. We have been taught
f hat only contact can break down barriers be
tween nations. But Professor Boas and his ad
herents would sever all communication be
tween those most able to benefit by contact—
the intelligent people.
To those holding Dr. Boas' viewpoint, intel
lectual tyranny is a communicable disease to
which the United States is susceptible. And
rather than attempt to cure the disease by min
istering to it, they would rather isolate that
patient and let him die.
They are like a scientist who refuses to study
the causes of a disease because of a chance
lhat he will fall victim to its dangers.
German scholars in America are accused of
coming here with the implicit purpose of im
planting the germ of Naziism leading to intel
lectual restriction. Yet in advocating shutting
university doors in the face of "those German
emissaries" the lance carriers of intellectual
freedom show a strange lack of confidence in
their armor of unrestricted thought. If the
American freedom is so shaky that it can be
destroyed by a handful of young German stu
dents, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
These complacent countrymen of ours pro
pose to preserve America's "precious treasure
of intellectual freedom" by denying the right
of that freedom to the nation that most needs
it. In so doing, they are playing—on an inter
national scale—the role of a censor of thought,
just as Hitler is doing in Germany.
They wish to add international restrictions of
intellectual endeavor to national ones already
existing in Germany. In so doing they only
aggravate the Nazi disease. Further intolerance
will never bring back lost intellectual free
dom.—J. S.

to us, is directly opposite to all tenets of inter
national understanding. We have been taught
f hat only contact can break down barriers be
tween nations. But Professor Boas and his ad
herents would sever all communication be
tween those most able to benefit by contact—
the intelligent people.
To those holding Dr. Boas' viewpoint, intel
lectual tyranny is a communicable disease to
which the United States is susceptible. And
rather than attempt to cure the disease by min
istering to it, they would rather isolate that
patient and let him die.
They are like a scientist who refuses to study
the causes of a disease because of a chance
lhat he will fall victim to its dangers.
German scholars in America are accused of
coming here with the implicit purpose of im
planting the germ of Naziism leading to intel
lectual restriction. Yet in advocating shutting
university doors in the face of "those German
emissaries" the lance carriers of intellectual
freedom show a strange lack of confidence in
their armor of unrestricted thought. If the
American freedom is so shaky that it can be
destroyed by a handful of young German stu
dents, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
These complacent countrymen of ours pro
pose to preserve America's "precious treasure
of intellectual freedom" by denying the right
of that freedom to the nation that most needs
it. In so doing, they are playing—on an inter
national scale—the role of a censor of thought,
just as Hitler is doing in Germany.
They wish to add international restrictions of
intellectual endeavor to national ones already
existing in Germany. In so doing they only
aggravate the Nazi disease. Further intolerance
will never bring back lost intellectual free
dom.—J. S.
THERE is one sure method to give a univer
sity professor the colly-wobbles, and that
is to talk about taking away his intellectual
freedom. The recent move in Nazi Germany
to control thought have made scientists and
teachers here, as elsewhere, as jittery as a
bridegroom an hour before the wedding march.
Take Professor Franz Boas, noted anthropol
ogist and professor emeritus at Columbia Uni
versity, who recently voiced this fear. In an
article, "The Death of Freedom," printed in the
Independent lournal of Columbia University,
he said:
"It seems to me that the time has come —and
has come long ago—when we ought to cease
sending students into this unhealthy atmos
phere (Nazi Germany) and we should no long
er extend a helping hand to those German
student emissaries who are sent for the pur
pose of promoting Nazi ideas in our country."
From any scholar, and particularly one as
eminent as Professor Boas, this statement is
shocking to those brought up in an atmosphere
of unrestricted thought. But Professor Boas'
statement only crystallizes the attitude held by
a large group in the United States today.
In the name of intellectual freedom, this
group proposes intolerance. They would give
.he magic gift of such freedom to those already
possessing it, but deprive less fortunate schol
ars from ever breathing its pure air.
Even further, they would break off all con
lact between free and unrestricted intellectual
groups for fear of contamination. This, it seems
to us, is directly opposite to all tenets of inter
national understanding. We have been taught
f hat only contact can break down barriers be
tween nations. But Professor Boas and his ad
herents would sever all communication be
tween those most able to benefit by contact—
