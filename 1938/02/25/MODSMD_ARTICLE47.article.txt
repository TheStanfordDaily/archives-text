# Breaking the Mirror
## 
### 
STANFORD'S mid-afternoon doze was dis
turbed the other day, when a dozen or so
Cal men descended upon us and began to ask
questions about the Farm and its mores and
folkways. When Stanford woke up enough to
ask why they wanted to know, the Cal men
answered that they were starting a magazine
of comment on colleges and wanted an article
on Stanford's set-up. Stanford said, "Oh," re
plied to some of the questions, lied out of the
rest, and returned to yogi-like contemplation of
its collective stomach.
But the idea which caused only this small
backwash in our stream of consciousness
seems to be moving the waters mightily at
Berkeley. If advance reports that come out of
the hinterland across the Bay can be trusted,
the new magazine will gather information about

other colleges, comment on the Cal system, and
compare the Berkeley ways with those of other
schools.
Critics who have complained about the insu
larity and introversion of American colleges
will probably frame the first issue and hang it
over the mantle. For the magazine is one of
the first evidences that an American college
can admit that any off-campus event or condi
tion can approach a between-class flirtation in
importance.
Stanford will receive the new magazine with
the same quiet calm with which it hears that
the jellyfish are spoiling the beaches at Ber
muda, or that Hitler has gone in for map de
signing.
And Stanford's reception, typical of the way
it takes all off-campus news, will prove the
critics' point much better than a library full of
biting comments. No national event concerns
us as much as the heavy-handed cut-in tech
nique at jolly-ups. No news from other col
leges bothers us as much as the heavy-headed
conversation on dates.
Rome may burn; so may a couple of thou
sand stupid Chinese who didn't have sense
enough to get out from under an air raid.
And we fiddle wtih empty dreams of how the
basketball game might have turned out.
But when Cal works up enough interest to
send a dozen reporters across the Bay, it proves
that college students don't have to sleep 24
hours a day to keep alive. It proves thai a
Narcissus-complex doesn't have to run on a
full-time basis, and that we can bear up bravely
for a short time without seeing our reflection.
Perhaps Stanford wouldn't waste the time if
it stopped looking in the mirror long enough
to read the new magazine. But it won't; it will
moan sadly about what a dirty name that last
referee was.—J. C.

us as much as the heavy-handed cut-in tech
nique at jolly-ups. No news from other col
leges bothers us as much as the heavy-headed
conversation on dates.
Rome may burn; so may a couple of thou
sand stupid Chinese who didn't have sense
enough to get out from under an air raid.
And we fiddle wtih empty dreams of how the
basketball game might have turned out.
But when Cal works up enough interest to
send a dozen reporters across the Bay, it proves
that college students don't have to sleep 24
hours a day to keep alive. It proves thai a
Narcissus-complex doesn't have to run on a
full-time basis, and that we can bear up bravely
for a short time without seeing our reflection.
Perhaps Stanford wouldn't waste the time if
it stopped looking in the mirror long enough
to read the new magazine. But it won't; it will
moan sadly about what a dirty name that last
referee was.—J. C.
STANFORD'S mid-afternoon doze was dis
turbed the other day, when a dozen or so
Cal men descended upon us and began to ask
questions about the Farm and its mores and
folkways. When Stanford woke up enough to
ask why they wanted to know, the Cal men
answered that they were starting a magazine
of comment on colleges and wanted an article
on Stanford's set-up. Stanford said, "Oh," re
plied to some of the questions, lied out of the
rest, and returned to yogi-like contemplation of
its collective stomach.
But the idea which caused only this small
backwash in our stream of consciousness
seems to be moving the waters mightily at
Berkeley. If advance reports that come out of
the hinterland across the Bay can be trusted,
the new magazine will gather information about

other colleges, comment on the Cal system, and
compare the Berkeley ways with those of other
schools.
Critics who have complained about the insu
larity and introversion of American colleges
will probably frame the first issue and hang it
over the mantle. For the magazine is one of
the first evidences that an American college
can admit that any off-campus event or condi
tion can approach a between-class flirtation in
importance.
Stanford will receive the new magazine with
the same quiet calm with which it hears that
the jellyfish are spoiling the beaches at Ber
muda, or that Hitler has gone in for map de
signing.
And Stanford's reception, typical of the way
it takes all off-campus news, will prove the
critics' point much better than a library full of
biting comments. No national event concerns
us as much as the heavy-handed cut-in tech
nique at jolly-ups. No news from other col
leges bothers us as much as the heavy-headed
conversation on dates.
