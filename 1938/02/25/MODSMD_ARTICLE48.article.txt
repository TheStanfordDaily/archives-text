## THE 						BELLWETHER METHOD 
### 
r pHINKING over my bizarre encounter with Emery
Bellwether, I have come to the conclusion that
while this method of revolting against the time sched
ule may not be a very wise one for the general public
to follow, it does have a pretty good idea behind it.
A winter as deceptively mild as this has been is
apt to dull memories of rushing to every 8 o'clock
for two months through a 26 above zero fog. An eter
nal Indian summer broken by two or three big rain
storms is not a typical Stanford winter, as all who have
been here before will attest, and when the weather gets
as unpleasant as it usually does, there are times when
8 o'clocks lose all their elusive charm, even if attended
at 9.
THEREFORE, since no one can change the weather,
but someone could change the Time Schedule, I
should like to join Bellwether in proposing that, for
Winter Quarter at least, the University realign its
courses to coincide with the Bellwether Method.
This, it seems to me, could be done without very
much trouble. Either the 11 o'clock class could be put
over to 2—since no one likes 1 o'clocks, either—or it
could be held at 12, with lunch at 1. Labs would then
be from 2 to 5, or 6 if necessary—the hardships of
running for a 6 -1 5 supper being considerably less than
those of running for an 8 o'clock class.
' As far as is apparent on the surface, there is no
very good reason why this should not be done. Some
body would have to revise the printing in the Time
Schedule, and people would have to get used to the
idea that something which has existed at Stanford for
40 years has actually been changed, but aside from
that there wouldn't be much that couldn't be easily
adjusted. An extra hour, full in the afternoon and
empty in the morning, could have very little effect on
the smooth functioning of the University.
Perhaps getting up for an 8 o'clock on a bitterly
cold morning is supposed to toughen the student, but
there are plenty of other things to do that; and Winter
Quarter 8 o'clocks, since they seem to stir up more
resentment than manful acceptance of fate, rank more
with major nuisances than with Molders of Men.
