# Another Man's View

In View of The Daily's style edition today, this
masculine view of a phase of women's fashions
seemed timely. It is clipped from the editorial
column of The Minnesota Daily.
IN OUR capacity as official custodian of campus
morals and manners, we must report that the ban
danna (or babushka) craze is definitely on the wane.
True, many young ladies are still seen about the cam
pus with these parti-colored head coverings flapping
in the 8-mile-an-hour breeze, but we are sure the tide
is ebbing.
Most crazes expire from sheer boredom, and the
babushka would undoubtedly have died of its own
accord in due time. But we feel its demise was hastened
by the fact that high school girls and the lower bourge
oisie were so quick to appropriate it. So long as a
bandanna on the head was chronic only among soror
ity members, it was considered a mark of distinction.
But then the younger generation snapped it up. and
the bandanna had lost its only real excuse for exist
ing. Naturally enough, the sorority members sensed
the danger of being mistaken for University High stu
dents, and gave up wearing bandannas. They were in
the same position as the Boy Scout official who quit
smoking when women took it up. He said he was no
sissy.
Future historians may worry about city dwellers
who went out of their way to look like peasants. The
phenomenon is understandable only in the light of the
vogue for affected unaffectedness among a certain
gtoup of our contemporaries. This is the vogue re
sponsible for saddle shoes, high-water pants, odd coats,
sweat socks, and a general air of refined boorishness.
Unfortunately, the vogue does not sound the death
rattle as does the bandanna craze. The high school
students have seized upon it, too, but still it breathes
lustily.
We are at a loss to explain the longevity of ihe
vogue. Probably affected unaffectedness persists while
urban peasantry dies because bandannas all look more
or less alike, whereas sloppy clothes that give one just
the right air of distinction are rather expensive.
