# Dancer To Speak Here Wednesday
## 
### 
Ann Mundstock, well known San
Francisco dancer, will explain meth
ods of "Dance Notation" to a Stan-
I ford audience at 7:30 o'clock Wed-
I nesday in Room 100.
Although the first attempt at
I dance notation occurred some cen
j turies ago, Miss Mundstock says, no
t widespread use of any special system
I followed until the recent formula
â–  tion of a practical method by Ru-
I dolph Von Lohan, European dancer
i and teacher. A variation of his basic
i notation is used by Mary Wigman
j and the Joos ballet. It has also been
| used successfully for folk and tap
j dances. Miss Mundstock. a former
; pupil of Von Lohan, has appeared
j with the group in the southern and
central parts of the state.
