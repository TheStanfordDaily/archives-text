# TIRED OF DUST
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I am not one of those people who
gropes around in dark corners to see
if there is'dust. However, it is bad
enough for anyone to have the en
ergy to look up something in the
reference room without being greet
ed by a shower of dust every time.
It may be that the janitors have no
time to dust out the books. Why
not the members of the reference
staff instead of wearing out their
seats and reading "Saturday Eve
ning Post"? I'm getting plenty tired
of being thoroughly dusted and in
haling bales of dirt.
Yours dustily,
"Dusty Art"
