The Editor, Sir:
This is the "Harvard of the West."
I know that this is true because no
less than five people have told me so.
However, last Friday night I began j
to wonder.
The Junior Prom is supposed to be
the big dance of the year, but all I
saw was a lot of people in dinner
dresses and sack suits milling about
a draughty Pavilion and dancing to !
the swing music of a second-rate !
negro orchestra. When I compared
this with the dances given at Har
vard, I couldn't help feeling that
the above epithet is, to say the
least, flattering to Stanford.
The "clever" advertisement of the
forthcoming play suspended over i
the street by the Cellar, the quaint 1
little stickers on windshields saying, !
"Trip Troy," the delightfully filthy ;
corduroys, and the delightfully ex
pensive Cords, that cheery "hello"
on everyone's lips, that Western in
novation, the "big man on the cam
pus," who knows so many people,
and finally that ever-so-delightful
creature, the Stanford Rough, whose
fascinating conversation consists of
"the girls I've been out with" and
"the time I really got drunk," all
make it seem that Stanford is more
like "the overgrown Exeter of the
West."
Perhaps beneath this Rough ex
terior there lies more than a pot of
gold, but it remains to be pointed
out to me.
Yours truly,
Margaret
