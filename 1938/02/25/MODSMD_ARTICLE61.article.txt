# Pastels, Seaspray Shine As New Spring Colors
## Three New Colors Add Allure To Madames' Garb 
### 
Pastels for Monsieur and seaspray for .Madame—that is the color ver
t of this year's spring style experts. Evening ruffles and informal pleats
lei Indies, and semi-formal and sport attire for men will he slightly toned
[h;,vn this season to give a softer, more artistic effect.
'i 'tree new colors will add to ladies' evening gowns: hyacinth, con-

►fetti, and seaspray. Hyacinth is a
delicate blend of lilac and purple;
confetti is a soft shade between pink
and vermillion; and seaspray, ex- I
pected to be most popular, is a
blue, one tone lighter than turquoise.
For Red Heads
Carolyn Kelsey, in Palo Alto,
suggests the following color scheme
for a city-bound red-head: an eve
ning dress of hyacinth trimmed with
flowers and sash of mulberry red
and sandals to match the sash. Other
colors that are expected to be popu
lar for evening wear are black, hya
cinth, seaspray, confetti, heather
pink, crushed strawberry, navy blue,
and chartreuse green.
For street ensemble blondes will
favor something like this: pleated
skirt and short, boxy jacket in sea
spray, with shoes, bag, and belt in
luggage tan. Brunettes and red
heads can choose from the following
variety of colors: seaspray, navy
blue, rose, French blue, lilac, beige,
heather, and chartreuse green. Gold
| will be in vogue for topcoats.
Sportswear
For sportswear the smart brun
ette might choose chartreuse green
and cinnamon for skirt and blouse,
and russet brown for shoes, bag, and
gloves, with the hat in either cinna
mon or green. Women's sports out
fits will also be in white, French
blue, Chartreuse green, beige, gray
and wine, and seaspray and wine,
although men may prefer their dates
in wine without the seaspray.
To match the fine feathers of
spring's women, Calvin Innman of
Roos Brothers makes the following
suggestions for the dapper young
male:
Formal dress should consist of a
white coat, midnight blue or black
trousers, white shirt, maroon studs
and cuff links, an artificial maroon
flower, light gray hat, and black
shoes.
Semi-Formals Varied
Semi-formal outfits can have more
variance, with grays and light browns
the predominant colors. An ideal
costume would be flannel or bedford
cord suit of light gray, with a Pan
ama hat, solid brown shoes, yellow
tie, and light blue shirt and handker
chief.
A smart sports outfit might con
sist of green gabardine slacks, yel
low polo shirt, burma tan jacket,
green handkdrchielj, short length
yellow wool socks, green foulard
neck piece, and brown and white
shoes. In general, two-toned shoes
will predominate over plain white
ones.
Colors in Slacks
For active sportswear Mr. Inn
man suggests bedford, whip cord,
or gabardine slacks in gray, tan, or
green; sport shirt of raw silk oi
lmen, which is camel-hair tan in
color, and shoes to suit the sport.
English ducks, which are solid white,
will also be popular for active
sportswear.
The newest thing in bathing suits
will be lastex silk in white, royal
blue, and red, or bright Hawaiian
prints.

ette might choose chartreuse green
and cinnamon for skirt and blouse,
and russet brown for shoes, bag, and
gloves, with the hat in either cinna
mon or green. Women's sports out
fits will also be in white, French
blue, Chartreuse green, beige, gray
and wine, and seaspray and wine,
although men may prefer their dates
in wine without the seaspray.
To match the fine feathers of
spring's women, Calvin Innman of
Roos Brothers makes the following
suggestions for the dapper young
male:
Formal dress should consist of a
white coat, midnight blue or black
trousers, white shirt, maroon studs
and cuff links, an artificial maroon
flower, light gray hat, and black
shoes.
Semi-Formals Varied
Semi-formal outfits can have more
variance, with grays and light browns
the predominant colors. An ideal
costume would be flannel or bedford
cord suit of light gray, with a Pan
ama hat, solid brown shoes, yellow
tie, and light blue shirt and handker
chief.
A smart sports outfit might con
sist of green gabardine slacks, yel
low polo shirt, burma tan jacket,
green handkdrchielj, short length
yellow wool socks, green foulard
neck piece, and brown and white
shoes. In general, two-toned shoes
will predominate over plain white
ones.
Colors in Slacks
For active sportswear Mr. Inn
man suggests bedford, whip cord,
or gabardine slacks in gray, tan, or
green; sport shirt of raw silk oi
lmen, which is camel-hair tan in
color, and shoes to suit the sport.
English ducks, which are solid white,
will also be popular for active
sportswear.
The newest thing in bathing suits
will be lastex silk in white, royal
blue, and red, or bright Hawaiian
prints.
Pastels for Monsieur and seaspray for .Madame—that is the color ver
t of this year's spring style experts. Evening ruffles and informal pleats
lei Indies, and semi-formal and sport attire for men will he slightly toned
[h;,vn this season to give a softer, more artistic effect.
'i 'tree new colors will add to ladies' evening gowns: hyacinth, con-

►fetti, and seaspray. Hyacinth is a
delicate blend of lilac and purple;
confetti is a soft shade between pink
and vermillion; and seaspray, ex- I
pected to be most popular, is a
blue, one tone lighter than turquoise.
For Red Heads
Carolyn Kelsey, in Palo Alto,
suggests the following color scheme
for a city-bound red-head: an eve
ning dress of hyacinth trimmed with
flowers and sash of mulberry red
and sandals to match the sash. Other
colors that are expected to be popu
lar for evening wear are black, hya
cinth, seaspray, confetti, heather
pink, crushed strawberry, navy blue,
and chartreuse green.
For street ensemble blondes will
favor something like this: pleated
skirt and short, boxy jacket in sea
spray, with shoes, bag, and belt in
luggage tan. Brunettes and red
heads can choose from the following
variety of colors: seaspray, navy
blue, rose, French blue, lilac, beige,
heather, and chartreuse green. Gold
