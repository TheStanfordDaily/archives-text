# Men Profess Ignorance Of Intimacies Of Women's Wear
## 
### 
It is an established principle of
our society that no man should
comment on women's clothes with
out first reading Emily Pest and
consulting a faccessiul diplomat.
Compared to the perils and pitfalls
(hat lie in a simple remark about
the way a dress looks, an African
jungle complete with black mambas
and unfed tigers is as safe as a
nursery.
If a man says he doesn't know
enough to comment, he is called cal
lous, self-centered, blind, and he is
left with the impression that to re
main in character he must club the
next baby he runs across. If his re
mtrks show a knowledge of the sub
ject, there are suspicious looks; eye
brows arch like an irritated cat; and
somebody asks in a good imitation of
a monk of the Inquisition how he
got to know so much about women's
clothes. Just to call a slip a slip
instead of a "watdyucallit" is enough
to ruin a man's reputation.
"Looks Gorgeous"
And so the wise male will stick to
that ancient remark, "It looks gorge
ous, my dear." This may sound a
bit thin at times, but it is tested and
proved thoroughly safe. There are
no elusive connotations waiting to
spring when your back is turned, no
subtle shades of meaning that may
turn and snap at you. In short, this
is a convenient trap-door that pro
vides escape from that dangerous
question, "What do you think of it?"
Nevertheless, men do have ideas
about women's clothes â€”vague ones
most of which come from reading
the lingerie ads that talk about, the
comforts of cross ventilation and
vertical pull as opposed to air condi
tioning and lateral adjustment.
Change Quickly
The one universal impression
among men is that women's fash
ions change faster and more often
than a politician's platform. One
year, skirts will be sweeping the
ground, and you are-expected to give
a nasty look to the dancer who steps
on them. The next they are half
way up to no-man's land, and you
are expected to give a nasty look
to the man who looks too long at
them. During the last decade the
men waited with badly controlled
nervousness to see what was going
to happen in women's clothes.
Skirts were going up; tops were
going down. Logic indicated that if
the trends continued sooner or later
dresses would be reduced to belts,
and would then vanish completely.

But the tide turned and tops went up
and skirts went down. It was all
good entertainment, but it didn't
make for consistency.
Fluctuating Styles
Outside of the observable fact that
| styles fluctuate, men know little.
Most of them are in the position of
an outsider trying mightily to be
virtuous and not look in. What
I we know we know by hearsay, and
1 any man who can speak authorita
; tively on women's clothes does not
do so in mixed company.
We know that women wear slips,
because that is what shows at the
1 bottom of their dresses. Lingerie
j ads tell us that slips are garments
| something like nightshirts which
j cover most of what is under the
j dress. Beneath the slips, we under
j stand, there may be any number of
| things and again our advertisement
education helps us out.
But beyond this we are ignorant.
! And if we were not, we wouldn't
| mention it. Regardless of what we
know, the only sale thing is to say,
| "It looks gorgeous, my dear."
