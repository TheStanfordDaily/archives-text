I snow this season.
A gabardine ski suit with a con
i trasting top is practically a uniform,
j but someone occasionally comes out
' with a grey or light blue outfit.
The shirts are almost all plaid,
j usually in red or blue. Tyrolean

i For your head a scarf tied peasant
style will do, or use one of those
! caps with the earmuffs.
As a variation from the regular
j ski top try a water-proof hooded
j parka in one of the bright colors. It
j may be warm and sunshiny down
j here, but remember the wind blows
i on the mountain tops, so zip your
I parka up to the neck.
Blunt, square-toed ski boots re
j ceive unanimous approval. The
black ones with the white ankle
j straps are newest. Over these you
i might put a pair of puttees. They
j are good-looking, and keep out the
| snow, too.
