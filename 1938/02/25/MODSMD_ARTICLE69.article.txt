# Stanford Men Go Formal To Keep In Step With Melodramatic Coeds
## Roughs Don Ties; Shun More Comfortable Attire 
### 
Stanford men are dressing up and will continue to do so, if sales of
Inval men's shops can he taken as an indication of trends in men's wear on
the Campus.
While the Stanford men arc becoming more formal in their dress,
American young men as a whole seem to he attracted by looser and more

comfortable, less formal clothing. <
Formal evening wear in particu
lar is coming into its own on the
Farm and Stanford's traditional
"four-year" cords are becoming less
popular. Neck-ties are slowly on
their way back in every day wear.
Demanding Tails
The demand for tails is continu
ally increasing. Tuxes will be ex
clusively double-breasted within a
short time and the trend is to mid
night blue drape models with broad,
grained lapels. Trousers are high
cut with full pleats for both tails
and tuxes.
Tails remain conventional and
they are not losing their pockets
here as they are in some parts of
the country. Indications now arc
that the demand for double-breasted
summer tux coats and trousers will
he unusually large. The coat will be
of white or tan Palm Beach cloth
with a shawl collar and the trousers
will be of the same light material in
midnight blue.
Suits Full at Wait
Suits at semi-formal dances on
the Campus continue to be full in
the waist and largely double
breasted; trousers are being worn
short., with practically ho break.
Palo Alto men's shops are antici
pating a great demand for the three
buttoned herring-bone and diagonal
tweed lounge coats for spring and
summer wear. Conventional gabar
dines, Bedfords, flannels, and wor
steds are expected to continue to
hold their own.
There will be a noticeable swing
to sports coats, both with plain
backs and by-swings, as warmer
weather sets in, and natural-shade
camel hair will probably be popu
lar on the Campus. Styles in slacks
will not change radically, with pres
ent trends anticipating a continued
popularity for pleats.
Palm Beach Suits Seen
Palm Beach suits in whites, tans,
ind greys will probably be numer
ous during the Hummer months.
Other light-weight materials that
ire constantly on the up-swing are
)a.sket-weaves, crashes, and various
jot ton cloths. Trousers as well as
joats v/ill be of these loose weaves
nakin<| for comfort during warm
iveather.
Sweaters on the Campus are giv
ng way somewhat to beer-jackets
n several shades. Rough linens and
jaskct-weaves arc coming into
/ogue at an amazing rate, but the
avishly printed Hawaiian Kahalas
ire losing their popularity.
Shoes and hosiery are remaining

quite conventional but there is a
trend back to the Homberg hat
for dressy wear. More and more
crepe-soles appear and plain colors
still outnumber the loud hosiery
wear.
Stanford men prefer to wear the
conventional everyday black shoe
with their formal evening clothes but
the prescribed tux shoe is coming in
a bit. One novelty has been the ap
pearance of a dull gun-metal fin
ished evening shoe.
The well-undressed young man
at the beach this spring will wear
a new lastex trunk that fits snugly.
Tops will be the exceptional in
stead of the rule where topless bath
ers are permitted.
