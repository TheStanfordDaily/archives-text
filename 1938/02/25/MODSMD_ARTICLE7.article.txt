# Eddy Duchin's Orchestra To Play for Senior Prom
## 
### 
Eddy Duchin, master pianist of
dancedom, and his 14-piece orchestra
were signed last night to play for
the Senior Prom on April 1.
Bids for the prom which, until
last year, was part of senior week
activities, will go on sale next week
for $3.50.
According to Senior President
Bob Mcßoskey the number of bids
will be strictly limited so as to avoid
the overcrowding which has pre
vailed at recent big dances.
Duchin, making his first appear
ance in this vicinity, will come to
Stanford from an extended engage
ment at the Cocoanut Grove in Los
Angeles. He will be accompanied by
two vocalists.
Acknowledged by many as the
most danceable orchestra in the
country, the Duchin band is one of
the best known ever to appear on
the Farm.
With most of Duchin's music
based on twin-piano arrangements,
"the magic fingers of radio," as the
young band leader is often identi
ged, will get plenty of chance to strut
their stuff at the dance.
Prom Chairman A1 Hyman an
nounced last night that the dance,
which is to be semi-formal, will be
held in the Pavilion from 9 to 1
o'clock. Hyman placed special em
phasis on the fact that, though the
prom is a senior function, it is open
to all students.
Committee for the affair will be:
Bill Allen, decorations and lighting;
Bob Garretson, Pavilion and polic
ing; Kay Kloster, patrons and check
ing arrangements; Margaret Loud,
tickets and posters; and John Rice,
publicity and refreshments.
