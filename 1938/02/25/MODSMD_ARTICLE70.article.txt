# Coiffures Will Be Off Face
## 'A Year for Ears' Is New Trend 
### 
Sweeping up off (he face into a
froth of curls or deep .swirls, hair
styles this spring are high and free.
Tired of peering through a forest
of dank locks, sheepdog style, fash
ion has taken the page-hoy bob by
its longest, straggliest ends and car
ried it straight to the top of a head
that will wear it there in a circle
of braids or twisted into a novel
top-knot effect.
If the idea of cutting those shining
locks, which took such a tediously
long time to grow, makes you shrink
inwardly, leave them as long as they
are, but sweep them up off the
temples and fasten them back high
on the head with a pair of the new,
jewelled clips.
Of course, this sky-high trend in
hair-styles makes it also "a year
for ears." And now that they are
out in the open again, make use
of their infinite possibilities. Fasten
bright jewelled clips in them to out
line their natural curves. Clip pearls
on the tops of the cars instead of
the lobes, adding even more height to
the spring head line.
And rememberâ€”pile your hair
high or cut it short; otherwise, you
will find a spring hat that does not
look like a pancake perched on top
of a haystack.
