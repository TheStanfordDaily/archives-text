# Easterners Wear New Cord Uniforms
## 
### 
The uniform of the well dressed
Cantabridgian (Harvard man to
you) this year has a coat of cordu
roy with leather buttons, side vents
and slanting pockets. With this jac
ket, flannel slacks, or bags as they
are quaintly called by the Harvard
boys, are worn, and reversed calf
shoes are also popular with the com
bination.
Princetonians are wearing a new
version of the Tyrolean hat which
comes to a sharper point at the crown
and has a larger cord.
