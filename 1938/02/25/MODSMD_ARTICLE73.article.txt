# Boleros, Full Skirts Remain In Vogue
## 
### 
l or daytime, the curt bolero jackets are on speaking terms by a bare
inch with their skirts. For afternoon, the skirt cuts a wide swath. For eve
ning yards of lace and marquisette drift in a melodramatic haze. Three
city stores have stocked accordingly.
11. Liebcs give Stanfordites credit for sophistication and plenty of

money. Their buyer suggests: A«
burnt wheat wool suit topped by a I
three-quarter length tuxedo coat, |
buried in a red fox fur; a navy I
street dress, sprayed with painted j
white Duco dots, trimmed by pique
peaks in the pocket; a dull black |
crepe street dress with a powder .
blue quilted bolero and sash.

Vintage Tones In
Vintage tones reel drunkenly |
through Liebes's sports department. |
There is a perosa angora sweater j
steamed with a woolen skirt ,
plaided in brown, and pink. Schia
perelli violet, which is not appreci
ably different from any other violet,
has been tailored in wool and !
stitched in suede for sweaters, I
skirts, and belts.
At Livingston's, rocco shades j
and the Spanish point of view pre- |
vail. A foam of marquisette has !
been confined in a smoke-tone for
mal. For afternoon, a funereal black
crepe is trimmed with a cluster of]
rose-quartz and a pink patent j
leather belt fastened with four sil
ver prongs.
A wide Roman striped hem of
grosgrain brings to a bold finish
the skirt of a black georgette din
ner dress. A brief Spanish bolero
tops it.
Lenore Albertson, former Stan
ford coed, now Livingston fashion
adviser, favors their black fishnet
veil, studded with velvet pansies,
violets, and heliotrope, and dripping
from a black Gibson Girl sailor.
Victorian Flowers
In a mathematical moment, Living
ston's picked an all-over sym
metrically pleated afternoon dress,
trimmed with Victorian flowers
undcr-glass buttons.
The White House predicts that
the demure Gibson Girl mode will
come a cropper with the Paris
openings. So with not even a pros-
I pective cliche in their collegiate
I stock, this Grant Avenue store ad
vocates: A navy suit with a skirt
pleated all around, a pique shirt
front, a bolero with scrollwork poc
kets in soutache; dotted and striped
blouses stuffed into silk jumpers
for afternoon wear. These White
House clothes are strictly academic
—a cross in spirit between Castcl
leja and Sarah Lawrence.
