# Men's Trunks Go Native
## Bathers Will Wear Cay Hawaiian Prints 
### 
The trend now in men's beach
posing and swimming apparatus is
taking us westward, across the white
capped waves of the Pacific to the
shores of Hawaii.
There, far from the madding crowd,
today's styles in bathing trunks be
gan. First worn by bronzed Ha
waiians on speeding surfboards,
bathing trunks of bright native flow
ery patterns in cloths ranging from
cotton to silk and rubberized silk
have finally invaded the beaches of
the western and eastern coast.
An adaptation of the informally
draped "malo" or sarong of tapa
cloth, the brightly hued trunks had
trouble at first even crashing the far
from high-hat beach of Waikiki.
Once the beach boys realized the
"gal-amor" of the revamped article
however, the battle was over. Over
coming conservative fears, the article
spread through the islands, and, plus
shirt to match or contrast, became
the entire beach costume of the
well dressed man.
Hollywooders vacationing in Hono
lulu brought it back to the States.
This summer the sands of Balboa
and Carmel as well as those of the
Riviera will echo this trend, and as
a result the patterned trunks will
be in clothing store windows this
spring.
A far cry from the old woolen
article, the fit of the suit will be en
tirely different from the oncc popu
lar "V" effect. Conservative in its
longer hang if in nothing else, this
gay bathing suit of tomorrow will
yield less sunburn space.
Four - buttoned double - breasted
suits with lapels rolled to the lower
button will be one of the more im
j portant styles for men during the
I coming spring.
