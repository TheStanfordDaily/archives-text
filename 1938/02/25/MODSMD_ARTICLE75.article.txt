# Color Is Motif Of Accessories
## Veils Longer, Dresses Discarding Collars 
### 
Springtime is bringing us both en
tirely new and merely modified ex
pressions in the line of accessories.
The short dainty veils of the fall and
winter seasons have taken a sud
den spurt and, instead of going jus 1 !
far enough to tickle the tip of the
nose, they now cover the whole face
and in the back extend almost to
the base of the neck. Some are
even long enough to be caught up
in back in a perky bow or a fancy
knot. Hats arc now commanding
coarser veils with larger dots in
them.
Dresses arc discarding their col
lars—sonic for a low neckline which
is finished by a tuck-in scarf, others
by a simple, high neckline which is
set ofT by an ornament. This orna
ment may be a heavy fold necklace
supplemented by a bracelet of the
same variety, or it may be a cross
cither gold or silver—on a very
hcjivy, twisted chain. Pearls still
hold their charm, and clips arc quite
striking in certain instances. Al
though charm bracelets arc not un
common sights, they are gradually
fading out.
Purses are a great deal larger,
huge in fact, and lighter in weight.
In shining patent leather or soft
suede, colors directly contrasting to
the dress and coat may be used to
set the purse ofT. Gloves match the
purse and may be suede, kid, or silk.
However, their style, a revival of
the gloves of mother's girlhood, Ls
definitely set—long slip-on.
Sport clothes are still being
livened up with brightly-bolored
peasant scarves, belts, and, especi
ally, with sport handkerchiefs gen
erously splashed with color and
design. Color, and plenty of it, is
definitely the keynote of spring ac
cessories.
