# Square Mufflers Used for Sportwear
## 
### 
There is only one major change
taking place in men's scarf-wear,
and this is the increase in the use
of square type mufflers worn with
open neck polo shirts. When the
scarf is worn in this manner, it
should be tied in an Ascot bow. One
should wear highly patterned crea
tions with bright oranges and ycl

lows which can be worn plain or
in combination.
Aside from this new development
in the wearing of scarves there have
ben no changes. As always one
should wear colored silks and pat
terns for informal day and evening
wear. For full dress, the scarf should
be entirely white, and for tuxedo,
black and white should be worn.
