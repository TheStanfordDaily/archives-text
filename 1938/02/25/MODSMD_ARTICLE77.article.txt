# Farm Coed Fashions Discussed by Rough
## 
### 
It's as ridiculous to ask a man what he thinks about women's clothes
a it is to ask him what lie thinks about the weather.
About the weather, he'll sa.v it's hot or it's raining, or maybe that it's
k ikl for the crops, but he won't do any thinking about it. He'll answer
I!.rough reflex action only.
It's the same with women's clothes. In any specific instance he may say

he likes the clothes a woman has
on, or he dosen't like them, but he'll
seldom know why he likes or dis
likes them, unless he thinks it's
because they're blue and he likes
I blue.
Something Subtle
But he does know that he doesn't
think any too highly of the clothes
Stanford women wear on the Quad.
It's not that he doesn't like skirts
or sweaters or low-heeled shoes.
[ it's something subtler than that
j sometimes, sometimes it's just that
I the women don't give a darn what
j they put on when they go to classes,
j or how they put it on.
How do they know it's not the
; skirts and sweaters stuff they don't
like? Because they see some Farm
j women who do look very nice in
that sort of stuff. They look nice
because their skirts aren't awk
wardly long or awkwardly short,
they aren't sloppily loose or, to be
quite frank, too tight.
"Just Ain't Thin"
And to be frank again, if they do
wear low shoes, they let the height
of their heels vary in indirect pro
portion to the thickness of their
ankles. It can't be helped, but some
ankles just ain't thin, and low heels
don't help any.
But high-heeled shoes on the Quad,
no. A Stanford man, in his sloppy
clothes, wants the women ai'ound
him to be neat and attractive, but
he likes them to look comfortable
and not too dignified.
Not Mean Revision
I Stanford men, in other words,
j don't want the women to revise their
whole wardrobes. They just want
them to be a little more scientific
, in the way they put them on, and to
discard a few of the wrong-color,
wrong-length, wrong, etc. things that
jithey persist in wearing sp fre
j quently.
Objections to the clothes women
I wear when they aren't on the Quad
j come only from the particular.
Which proves that women do know
j about their clothes, but most of the
I time they just don't bother about
| them. They know that with four
guys going to Stanford to every one
gal, they can always get a date. It's
not fair.
The stocking question is old stuff.
By now the women have heard
enough about twisted, rolled below
the knee stockings. The Farm male
can at least be thankful that the
women conceal their legs in silk.
| not cotton.
