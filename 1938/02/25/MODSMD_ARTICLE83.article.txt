## Men Wear Sports Coats for Women 
### 
The Stanford Rough says that in '
spite of the Row, Phelps-Terkel, and
Roos Bros., his favorite costume is
still cords, and to heck with anyone
who doesn't like it.
However, he admits that if he
really has to look smooth, he has a '
few little tricks which he uses to j
slay the women.
Prime asset is some kind of a '
tricky sport coat. The Rough says |
this is especially effective in im- j
pressing the women. Shirts aren't
a requisite because a plain white
upper with a small circle around
the neck will do the trick equally
as well.
Herringbones Good
With Spring coming the Rough ad
mits that some of the new styles
are plenty easy on the eye. His fa
vorite patterns are wide herring
bones, diagonal stripes, and for the
very latest, a very small block or
houndstooth check will serve.
Getting around to those things
that cover his usually large feet, the
Rough agrees that to be dressed
properly for the campus, cordovan is
(he thing, especially with crepe
soles. Spring and summer will bring
an increased use of white shoes with
the ever popular hard red rubber
soles, he says.
Dark Shirts
For his sport shirts the Rough ;
thinks that deep tones still look i
best, and advises light gabardine or ;
linen for the materials.
As for swimming trunks the j
Rough is mighty afraid that the j
Hawaiian fabrics will be seen, but |
makes terrible vows to the effect j
that he would rather be found study
ing during Easter vacation than to
be seen in a pair of them.
Short girls will tower on beaches
this season in the tricky new beach j
lane*, als v/ith three-inch soles of
cork or rope.
