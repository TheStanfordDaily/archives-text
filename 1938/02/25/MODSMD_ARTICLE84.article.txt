# Masculine Foot Adorned By Wing-tip Whites
## Two-tone Sports, Perforated Leather Lead Spring Show 
### 
Wing-tip whites will lead the fash
ion parade in men's shoes for spring.
But Leon Doty, of Thoit's, in Palo
Alto, also has more varied sugges
tions as to the kind of leather that
should cover the stylish male foot.
Two-toned sport shoes, expected to
be much more popular than they
were last year, will be offered in
plain-toe saddle style, wing-tip, and
mocassin toe. The saddle type, which
has its band of tan, brown, or black
straight down the middle of the
shoe, is expected to interest more
college men than ordinary mortals.
Crepe or hard rubber soles will
be popular for sportswear, but not
as popular as featherweight leather
soles. For semi-formal attire leather
soled shoes in brown, black, and
tan will be in vogue, with brown
and tan more popular with college
men.
Three out of one hundred custo
mers who ask for a street shoe are
expected to buy perforated leather
ones in gray or brown. Perforated
leather may look rather effeminate
but it keeps "truckin' feet" from
getting too hot, efven to the rhythm
of Benny Goodman.
Other novelties expected to sell
well are natural pigskin for street
wear, and sand-colored buckskin
and tan sueded-leather in sport
shoes.
For formal dress plain black shoes
will carry on as usual.
