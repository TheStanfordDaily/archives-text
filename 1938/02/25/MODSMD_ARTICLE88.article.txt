# Men's Suits Wear Out-- Styles Change
## Haberdashers' Hopes Rise as Farm Rough Hitches Up Trousers 
### 
Men's suits, according to a recent j
announcement made on the Row, ;
are wearing out. This will un- |
doubtedly cause a change in the sta- !
tus of the local haberdasheries.
Car-loadings are up six per cent, |
and men are expected to take an- j
other hitch in their belts, as they !
starve that they may buy new suits
to suit The Daily's fashion edition j
experts, it is expected that this sea
son's latest model garments will in- !
elude vests of approximatly a dozen j
buttons each, and four pockets.
Who's Got The Button?
Coats may run up to as many as
six buttons on the sleeves, but will j
cut down on front buttons, except j
in the well-known case of the
double-breasted. This doubles the j
button manufacturers' business in i
front, as well it might.
Trousers will be hitched up to a !
new high, with suspenders, and !
pleated. But this is nothing new, !
merely a greater extreme of former â€¢
lashion. Experts, nevertheless, be- j
. "ve that this spring's new models 1
will show a great deal of advance in
such conveniences and innovations
as knee-action, shock absorbers for
greater ride comfort, and higher j
water to show off new plaid woolen
socks of varigated color scheme.
Pin Stripe In
The pin-stripe on oxford gray, !
navy blue, and black suits will see
an even greater popularity, particu
larly for those dates that are not of
a too-formal nature. For campus i
wear, suits will be banned as usual
except for the dunce floor and the j
Chapel.
To return to high-water pants, ;
well-substantiated rumor states that;
this move received added impetus
when an Encinaman discovered that
a pair of his 49-cent brown socks
were exactly like those of a friend
who bought his in Australia.
This and other similar causes seem 1
sufficient I'eason for the continued i
hitching movements noted lately, j
not already accounted for by lack of i
suspenders, occasionally called braces
or galluses by sartorial pedants.
Brown And Gray
The brown-coat, gray-trouser i
combination, frequently frowned on I
by the feminine element hereabouts j
and elsewhere, will enjoy its con- ,
tinued popularity, mainly because'
most people have a brown suit and
a pair of gray slacks. Also because j
closets are dark mornings.
And so, with all this in mind, stu- '
dents may well wear last year's j
suits, since this year's will look
about the same, only more pressed.
