# Air Cadet Board To Visit Campus
## 
### 
A special flying cadet board will
visit the Farm Monday to interview
candidates for flying cadet training.
Headed by Lieut.-Col. B. L. Wil
son, the board will examine appli
cants and, upon the basis of their
findings, recommend appointments to
the Air Corps Training Center in San
Antonio. An increase in the au
thorized membership of the base
caused the board's special trip.
The officers will arrive at 9 o'clock
for the day of interviews. Prospec
tive candidates will greatly facili
tate the board's work if they have
ready three letters of reference, cer
tificate of credits, and application in
triplicate form, according to Col.
Wilson.
