# Cruise Clothes Go Mexican
## 
### 
Most outstanding of this year's i
innovations in cruise clothes are
short slacks and thick-soled san
dals. Summer fashions arc showing
the multi-colored and gay influence j
of Mexico and the tropics, with a :
trend towards comfort and freedom. I
For evening excursions and wiener
roasts there is a smartly tailored
three-piece play suit of shorts, shirt, I
and mannish single-breasted jacket |
in wool for cool days or in shark- i
skin for warmer weaher.
Changes Eliminated
Summer sailors will appear in '
various costumes whose primary
advantage is the elimination of un
necessary changes during the day.
One of these is a short coat-dress of J
paisley print, buttoned down the !
front and suitable for wear over a
bathing suit or shorts. Short swag
ger coats wi!h the popular padded
shoulders may also he used for this i
purpose.
Although culottes are not always
flattering to the wearer, they are in
dispensable to (he more conserva
tive sea-goers when climbing up
and down ladders and around ropes, i
To make them more attractive, de- j
signers have fashioned a dress- '

culotte which appears as an ordi
nary sports dress, buttoning down
the front. When unbuttoned, how
ever, the culottes may be seen un
derneath.
Big Hats Shown
Head gear for yachting this season
will be much as it has always been,
featuring big floppy hats matching
the costume in pattern, or in the
ever-popular natural straw. Peas
ant scarfs and bonnets, also match
ing in design, will prevail among the
smartest pleasure seekers.
Striking a note of eccentric orig
inality in footwear this summer, sea
goers will go clopping around the
decks in clogs. These may be made
with cork or wood soles and fish
net or lacing for the top. One spe
cial type of clogs, called "High
Buoy," has* a three-inch cork sole
and a gaily striped band across the
top. *
Any of these costumes made in a
Balinese print or in the new "stucco
crepe," which feels like wet sand,
would be considered chic by Vogue.
If the sailor stays with the perennial
navy theme, or goes peasant with
the rest of the vacationers she will
be in the mode.

Any of these costumes made in a
Balinese print or in the new "stucco
crepe," which feels like wet sand,
would be considered chic by Vogue.
If the sailor stays with the perennial
navy theme, or goes peasant with
the rest of the vacationers she will
be in the mode.
Most outstanding of this year's i
innovations in cruise clothes are
short slacks and thick-soled san
dals. Summer fashions arc showing
the multi-colored and gay influence j
of Mexico and the tropics, with a :
trend towards comfort and freedom. I
For evening excursions and wiener
roasts there is a smartly tailored
three-piece play suit of shorts, shirt, I
and mannish single-breasted jacket |
in wool for cool days or in shark- i
skin for warmer weaher.
Changes Eliminated
Summer sailors will appear in '
various costumes whose primary
advantage is the elimination of un
necessary changes during the day.
One of these is a short coat-dress of J
paisley print, buttoned down the !
front and suitable for wear over a
bathing suit or shorts. Short swag
ger coats wi!h the popular padded
shoulders may also he used for this i
purpose.
Although culottes are not always
flattering to the wearer, they are in
dispensable to (he more conserva
tive sea-goers when climbing up
and down ladders and around ropes, i
To make them more attractive, de- j
signers have fashioned a dress- '

culotte which appears as an ordi
nary sports dress, buttoning down
the front. When unbuttoned, how
ever, the culottes may be seen un
derneath.
Big Hats Shown
Head gear for yachting this season
will be much as it has always been,
featuring big floppy hats matching
the costume in pattern, or in the
ever-popular natural straw. Peas
ant scarfs and bonnets, also match
ing in design, will prevail among the
smartest pleasure seekers.
Striking a note of eccentric orig
inality in footwear this summer, sea
goers will go clopping around the
decks in clogs. These may be made
with cork or wood soles and fish
net or lacing for the top. One spe
cial type of clogs, called "High
Buoy," has* a three-inch cork sole
and a gaily striped band across the
top. *
