# Rough Was Wild, Woolly In 1907, Survey Reveals
## 
### 
The country was still a trifle wild and more than a little woolly in 19(17
when Stanford students bought their clothes.
''Official sombreros" were advertised by J. L. Simpson and boots were
advertised more often than shoes.
Joe Stanford of the time was a weird locking fellow judging by pres-

ent standards. He wore a sombrero"
with the brim turned up to re
semble a Boer war veteran. He
wore a knee length coat which
bulged out behind suggesting a bus
tle. His trousers ended two inches
above the ankle bone and the cuffs
were at least three inches wide.
His snub-nosed .shoes had two buck
les for fasteners, instead of laces
and the übiquitous pipe hung on his
nether lip at a jaunty angle. He
was, in all, a picture of sartorial
splendor.
Huge Turtlenecks
The Stanford Rough was as un
couth then as now—and as proud
of it. Only in 1907 he wore a mon
strous turtle-neck sweater and
moleskins instead of cords and polo
shirts.
The most popular coat on the
campus was a four-button model
which presented the appearance of
a straight jacket and must have had
the Victorian effect of inhibiting ab
solutely all physical activity.
Chesterfields Worn
The well dressed Stanford man
would "go to town" in a cravenette
Chesterfield coat with a black lelt
collar, a tall bowler, and a high
choker collar.
Coat shirts were something new:
"Go on and come off like a coat!"
said one advertiser. Up until then
the boys had had tu wiggle in and
out of them.
The only woman to appear in the
clothing ads of the period was the
date of a well dressed 'man. This
cute thing had a formal with a V
shaped neck displaying a proper ex
panse of bosom, a waspish waist,
and a many-fold skirt modestly hid
ing her feet.
