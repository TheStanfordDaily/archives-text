# Men Prefer Gabardine
## Popular Fabrics Keep Crisp Look 
### 
Among other signs around the
Farm that the Rough is being re
placed by the gentleman, is the
growing tendency of the men to
forsake the baggy britches for
something that will be neat and stay
in press.
Acordingly, gabardines and Bed- 1
ford cords are gaining steadily in I
popularity for their ability to hold !
a crease and to look crisp after the j
most vigorous ordeal.
The ordinary gabardine is con- !
structed with a fine "steep" twill, or
diagonal ribbing. The twill is made
by twisting tightly closely woven j
yarns which impart to the cloth a 1
firm crispness. The name came
originally from a Jewish mantle or ;
cloak of the Middle Ages, and the
cloth first came into general modern
use in raincoats.
Closely related to the gabardine
is the Bedford cord, an all-wool
worsted differing from whipcord in
that the twill runs vertically in
stead of diagonally. Its larger twill
makes it especially suited for in
formal wear.
