# Farm Formals Stick To Tuxes
## Roughs Reject White Tie, Tails 
### 
"East is East and West is West"
in more ways than one—and the old,
old quotation applies to men's for
mal wear as well as to the more deli
cate and original subject. A com
parison of Occident and Orient is
not intended; but merely the East,
that broad expanse indefinitely
bounded by the Mississippi, and the
Pacific Coast, or explicitly, the Farm.
Experts and tailors demand full
dress, but men here, as in former
years, will forget white tie and tails
in the local air of smart informality,
will continue with tux and wing-tip
as their concession to convention.
No turn-down collars will be seen
on the better-informed; few ties
other than conservative black.
Styles tend toward single-breasted*
tuxedos, although few will forsake
broad-shouldered, double-breasted
models on this account. For spring
and summer comfort, cummerbunds,
white tux coats, occasional mess
jackets will remain in perfect style.
Neatest innovation of the year is
the tuxedo-full dress combination,
which consists of interchangeable
coats and vests for the same pair of
pants —but it is hardly a necessary
one for the Farm, where the rough
still has enough influence to keep
tails on the orchestra leader and sel
dom appears more formally than in
a dark suit.
