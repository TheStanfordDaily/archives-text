/JIVIL WAR may break out in the
southern Austrian province of
Styria. Yesterday Chancellor Kurt
Schuschnigg sent regular army
troops to establish virtual martial
law in Graz, provincial capital and
Nazi stronghold, as his answer to
rumors of a local putsch by 40,000
Nazis, to be followed by a "march
on Vienna."
The still-outlawed Nazis al
legedly planned a coup d'etat,
and were boasting that more than
80 per cent of Styria province fed
eral and local ollicialdom were
supporting their plans. The Styr
ian peasants differ from the peas
ants in most other sections of
Austria in being strong National
Socialist partisans.
Vienna was confused by actual
events in Styria, but the govern
ment announced that Dr. Arthur
Von Seyss-Inquart, Nazi minister
of interior in the reconstructed Aus
trian cabinet, will be sent to Graz
in an attempt to pacify the province.
Whether local Nazis, who regard
the minister as a "betrayer," will
accept his mediation efforts is at the
best doubtful.

ceiving an almost unanimous vote

events in Styria, but the govern
