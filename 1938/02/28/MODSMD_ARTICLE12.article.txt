"A Discussion of Modern Poetry" will be the subject of a talk by Will
iam Rose Benet in the Tuesday Evening Series at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow

As a poet, he believes that he is best at telling a story, modern or

ancient, in musical rhythm or lyrical<
style. Percy Hutchinson of the New
York Times said of Mr. Benet's most
recent book, "The source of his wit
is joy in life, joy in people, joy in
all the little daily things which make
up the sum of existence."
He is the author of "Golden
Fleece," "Rip Tide," a "Novel in
Verse," "Starry Harness," and trans
lator of "The East I Know." His
younger brother, Stephen Vincent
Benet is author of the famous "John
Brown's Body."
The speaker graduated from Shef
field Scientific School, after attend
ing Yale University. He later re
ceived an honorary M.A. from Yale.
Mr. Benet is particularly out
standing in the field of narrative
poetry, having used world history as
a background. He has written on
subjects ranging from ancient Egypt
and the Italian Renaissance down
to Jesse James and other tales of
the American West.
Arrangements for a reception in
the Green Room, at which interested
students may meet Mr. Benet after
his lecture, are being made by a
committee composed of Beth Allen,
chairman, Putzie Hinrichs, Walt
Stoessel, and Esther Berry.
