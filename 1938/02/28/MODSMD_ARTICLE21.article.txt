# Camino Signal Lengthened
## 
### 
By removing seven seconds from
the period the "green" light shows
on the highway, and adding them to
the University Avenue, the city of
Palo Alto has answered the com
plaints that traffic from Stanford
was being held up too long at El
Camino Real.
The new 70-second cycle, which is
in the nature of an experiment, will
give "green" on El Camino Real 42
seconds, and on the avenue 28 sec
onds. The former division was 49
and 21 seconds, respectively.
