### 
Captain Hank I.uisctti broke his own southern division scoring record
Saturday night when he split the net with his two hundred tenth point of
the conference season.
Ihe new mark, hung up after 38' u minutes oi play in the second game
of the U.C.L.A. series, tops by two points the 208 record which the Stan-

ford Ail-American made last year.
Making a total of 158 points over
the week-end, Hank came within 4
digits of smashing the national mark
of 1531. And there's another game
this week—to say nothing of the
conference playoffs.
Friday night, a "natural" is sched
uled for the favored few who will
pack the Cal Pavilion to the sky
lights. It's the last basketball Big
Game of 1938.
Nibs' Price-less Bears will be
fighting for a win, and the conse
quent tie in final standings. Right

now, they're gasping for breath after
a terrific workout against Southern
California.
Bears Smashed
Cal split its series with Troy, to
, be sure, but the reversal practically
blasted the Berkeleyites oft" the
court. After winning the first game
! 49-40, the Bears came back the next
I night to play the type of game called
; "Dubbers' Delight." It was a mass-
I acre, pure and simple. Score, 60-27.
In the meantime, Stanford and
i U.C.L.A. toiled through two listless
' waltzes, the Indians knocking ofT
; El Bruin's pitiful excuse for a bas
; ketball team, 53-31 and 50-33.
Low Score—Only 53
One thing can be said for Caddy
Works' quintet. It did the only
thing it could do—hold down the
score. The Bruins managed this by
tearing into their back-court after
every shot they took—no attempt
to get a rebound. As a result, they
slowed down Stanford enough to
keep the score surprisingly low.
Saturday night's game, by a slight
margin the better of the pair, was
aided tremendously by Art Stoefen's
return to form. The "Stork"' was hit
ting from everywhere, with a result
ant high point mark for the evening
—19 markers.

I night to play the type of game called
; "Dubbers' Delight." It was a mass-
I acre, pure and simple. Score, 60-27.
In the meantime, Stanford and
i U.C.L.A. toiled through two listless
' waltzes, the Indians knocking ofT
; El Bruin's pitiful excuse for a bas
; ketball team, 53-31 and 50-33.
Low Score—Only 53
One thing can be said for Caddy
Works' quintet. It did the only
thing it could do—hold down the
score. The Bruins managed this by
tearing into their back-court after
every shot they took—no attempt
to get a rebound. As a result, they
slowed down Stanford enough to
keep the score surprisingly low.
Saturday night's game, by a slight
margin the better of the pair, was
aided tremendously by Art Stoefen's
return to form. The "Stork"' was hit
ting from everywhere, with a result
ant high point mark for the evening
—19 markers.
Captain Hank I.uisctti broke his own southern division scoring record
Saturday night when he split the net with his two hundred tenth point of
the conference season.
Ihe new mark, hung up after 38' u minutes oi play in the second game
of the U.C.L.A. series, tops by two points the 208 record which the Stan-

ford Ail-American made last year.
Making a total of 158 points over
the week-end, Hank came within 4
digits of smashing the national mark
of 1531. And there's another game
this week—to say nothing of the
conference playoffs.
Friday night, a "natural" is sched
uled for the favored few who will
pack the Cal Pavilion to the sky
lights. It's the last basketball Big
Game of 1938.
Nibs' Price-less Bears will be
fighting for a win, and the conse
quent tie in final standings. Right

now, they're gasping for breath after
a terrific workout against Southern
California.
Bears Smashed
Cal split its series with Troy, to
, be sure, but the reversal practically
blasted the Berkeleyites oft" the
court. After winning the first game
! 49-40, the Bears came back the next
