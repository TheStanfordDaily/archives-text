# Cardinals--What, How, and Why
## Critics Attack Group's Self Appointing System 
### 
Three weeks ago Ex Committee sanctioned a series of meetings this
spring to he culled the Leadership Institute, and appointed a committee
to plan for them. Tomorrow night Ex Committee will accept or reject
appointments by a body which drew the greatest criticism from last year's
institute.
Made by the Cardinals, the appointments are to chairmanships of

major committees for the Convales-<
cent Home Drive. They almost cer
tainly will be accepted, because Ex
Committee rarely overrules Card
inals.
But the committee's action in vot
ing to continue the Leadership In
stitute which questioned Cardinals
seems unconsciously indicative of
general sentiment toward Stanford's
unobtrusive but powerful activity
group.
Criticisms Listed
Though this sentiment has not
crystallized into a movement to
change Cardinals, criticism of the
body is on two specific points.
1. It is a self perpetuating body
with old members appointing the
new.
2. The path to high political offices
often leads through jobs whose ap
pointments are controlled by Card
inals.
Opponents claim that the 14 mem
bers of the group could control
campus activities completely, make
Cardinals a Row clique, a Hall
clique, or a Cardinal clique through
their power of appointment.
Election Cumbersome
In rebuttal Mark Hopkins, present
chairman, asserts that only those
who have worked up through the
ranks have a basis for judging the
ability of prospective job holders.
Election, he believes, would be more
cumbersome, less satisfactory than
the present system.
Ex Committee's power of review
of Cardinal action, Hopkins thinks,
is a sufficient check on its activities.
Though one of the big jobs on the
Convalescent Home Drive is a na
tural tryout for A.S.S.U. presidency
(Ihe last two presidents, at least,
have followed this route), Hopkins
does not believe that Cardinal ap
pointments are ever made for poli
tical purposes.
