# Beaubaire Starts Group
## 
### 
Contrary to the general impres
sion, Stanford Cardinals is not an
ancient patriarch in the A.S.S.U.
family of committees. It was not
unti 1 1934 that Stan Beaubaire pro
pose . the new "supervisory body" to
replace the old rally committee of
which he was chairman.
Beaubaire's suggestion was the
final shot of a barrage of criticism
directed at the old rally committee
organization. Until that time, the
committee had consisted of 30 regu
lar members, of whom five to ten

were chosen by the outgoing group.
The rest were appointed by Ex Com
mittee.
Main function of the group was to
assist the yell leader in arranging
rallies, rooting, and tryouts for the
yell leading office. It was also in
structed to welcome and assist visit
ing notables, and to help with cam
pus activities when needed.
System Faulty
But the system proved faulty. The
committee was small. And rumor
asserted that it was really a pork
barrel. Campus cynics maintained
that posts on the committee were
used as rewards for faithful party
henchmen, and that the prestige of
the committee was used to corral
unbranded votes.
And so when Beaubaire made his
suggestion, it was greeted with en
thusiasm. A forum was held on the
plan; popular sentiment approved
it; and Ex Committee chartered the
present Activities Council, consist
ing of Cardinals, Rally Committee,
Woman's Committee, and Tryoutee
Committee. Cardinals was given
appointive power to the two inferior
| committees.
Cardinals Criticized
Thus the present system was born.
Beaubaire was definitely its father,
and old Rally Committee was its
mother. But even so, gossip did not
deal kindly with the new adoption
into the A.S.S.U. family. Most out
spoken of the critics said that it was
a constitutional front for the grow
ing Beaubaire dictatorship. More
conservative commentators said it
was simply putting the gravy train
on a new track.
And when the first members were
named to Cardinals, the critics
smiled smugly. It was an amazing
coincidence, they said, that the ma
jority of the appointees were Beau
baire's close friends. Perhaps the
gravy train had been derailed, but
they thought it was surprising how
Beaubaire got around.
But Ex Committee was happy. It
loved its protege and it got the new
comer off to a healthy and vigorous
start. Despite the criticisms, cur
rent opinion was that with the new
organization, harmony would spread
its cloak over Stanford, and Queens
bury rules would govern all ap
pointments.
Beaubaire himself was optimistic.
Like a proud father he predicted:
"Although the new plan takes the
political appointments away from
Ex Committee, it does so because
the new method should promote a
strictly non-political working com

mittee, not a 'gravy train' in the
slightest sense of the word. It should
be self-sufficient and independent,
handling all activities the Executive
Committee wishes to designate to
their responsibility, but to the cam
pus as a whole."
And with this paternal blessing,
Cardinals set forth to seek its for
tune.

MARK HOPKINS

Contrary to the general impres
sion, Stanford Cardinals is not an
ancient patriarch in the A.S.S.U.
family of committees. It was not
unti 1 1934 that Stan Beaubaire pro
pose . the new "supervisory body" to
replace the old rally committee of
which he was chairman.
Beaubaire's suggestion was the
final shot of a barrage of criticism
directed at the old rally committee
organization. Until that time, the
committee had consisted of 30 regu
lar members, of whom five to ten

were chosen by the outgoing group.
The rest were appointed by Ex Com
mittee.
Main function of the group was to
assist the yell leader in arranging
rallies, rooting, and tryouts for the
yell leading office. It was also in
structed to welcome and assist visit
ing notables, and to help with cam
pus activities when needed.
System Faulty
But the system proved faulty. The
committee was small. And rumor
asserted that it was really a pork
barrel. Campus cynics maintained
that posts on the committee were
used as rewards for faithful party
henchmen, and that the prestige of
the committee was used to corral
unbranded votes.
And so when Beaubaire made his
suggestion, it was greeted with en
thusiasm. A forum was held on the
plan; popular sentiment approved
it; and Ex Committee chartered the
present Activities Council, consist
ing of Cardinals, Rally Committee,
Woman's Committee, and Tryoutee
Committee. Cardinals was given
appointive power to the two inferior
| committees.
Cardinals Criticized
Thus the present system was born.
Beaubaire was definitely its father,
and old Rally Committee was its
mother. But even so, gossip did not
deal kindly with the new adoption
into the A.S.S.U. family. Most out
spoken of the critics said that it was
a constitutional front for the grow
ing Beaubaire dictatorship. More
conservative commentators said it
was simply putting the gravy train
on a new track.
And when the first members were
named to Cardinals, the critics
smiled smugly. It was an amazing
coincidence, they said, that the ma
jority of the appointees were Beau
baire's close friends. Perhaps the
gravy train had been derailed, but
they thought it was surprising how
Beaubaire got around.
But Ex Committee was happy. It
loved its protege and it got the new
comer off to a healthy and vigorous
start. Despite the criticisms, cur
rent opinion was that with the new
organization, harmony would spread
its cloak over Stanford, and Queens
bury rules would govern all ap
pointments.
Beaubaire himself was optimistic.
Like a proud father he predicted:
"Although the new plan takes the
political appointments away from
Ex Committee, it does so because
the new method should promote a
strictly non-political working com

mittee, not a 'gravy train' in the
