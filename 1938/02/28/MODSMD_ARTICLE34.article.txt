# Activity Group Self Appointed
## 
### 
Although Cardinals has a thumb
in almost all campus activity groups,
few students have more than a vague
idea of its purpose and make-up.
Organized to do away with partisan
committee appointments and to re
place old "log-rolling" with new
efficiency, Cardinals is a self-per
petuating body. President and secre
tary of the activity body, heads of
its sub-groups, Rally and Women's
Committee are elected by the body
from its own members. New ap
pointments are made by a majority
vote of Cardinals with the final ap
proval of Ex Committee.
Card Set-up
Cardinals is composed of seven
men and three women, not more
than seven of whom are seniors. In
addition to the ten Cardinals laity,
chairmen of Rally and Women's
Committee, A.S.S.U. president, and
Head Yell Leader are members.
Other than the limit of seven sen
iors or less on Cardinals, no other
qualifications for appointment are
listed constitu' >nally. However, it is
suggested that no less than four jun
ior appointments be made in the
spring. Appointments are to be
based on previous service to the Uni
versity. activities council, and the
A.S.S.U.
Members Chosen
Candidates for appointment are
chosen by Cardinals president and
chairmen of Rally and Women's
Committee from applicants inter
viewed early in May. The three then
reduce the candidates to txyice the
number of vacancies on Cardinals
and submit the list for election by
Cardinals as a whole. The body, in
its spring vote, retains at least
three, and not more than five mem
bers to serve a second term, and
then fills out the required ten by
election of new members.
Rally Committee and Women's
Committee appointments are made
by Cardinals at the same time on the
recommendation of the chairmen of
those two bodies. Each election finds
at least three sophomore members
on each of the two committees
elected to a junior term.
Logical Path
According to the relation which
exists between junior and senior
bodies, the logical path to Cardinals
should lead through Groups I and II
of Rally Committee. But, as one
rally committee member alleged,
prospective Cardinals may arrive not
through merit, but because (in the
case of the women) they "are cute,
and smile at the right people." The
oretically, the constitutional set-up
seems to imply a clear connection
between Rally Committee and Cardi
nals.
Charges of "log-rolling" come
when Cardinals appointments are
made outside the realm of their in
fluence—from other activity groups,
or, as is sometimes claimed, from
fraternity brothers, or politically im
portant leaders.

portant leaders.
Although Cardinals has a thumb
in almost all campus activity groups,
few students have more than a vague
idea of its purpose and make-up.
Organized to do away with partisan
committee appointments and to re
place old "log-rolling" with new
efficiency, Cardinals is a self-per
petuating body. President and secre
tary of the activity body, heads of
its sub-groups, Rally and Women's
Committee are elected by the body
from its own members. New ap
pointments are made by a majority
vote of Cardinals with the final ap
proval of Ex Committee.
Card Set-up
Cardinals is composed of seven
men and three women, not more
than seven of whom are seniors. In
addition to the ten Cardinals laity,
chairmen of Rally and Women's
Committee, A.S.S.U. president, and
Head Yell Leader are members.
Other than the limit of seven sen
iors or less on Cardinals, no other
qualifications for appointment are
listed constitu' >nally. However, it is
suggested that no less than four jun
ior appointments be made in the
spring. Appointments are to be
based on previous service to the Uni
versity. activities council, and the
A.S.S.U.
Members Chosen
Candidates for appointment are
chosen by Cardinals president and
chairmen of Rally and Women's
Committee from applicants inter
viewed early in May. The three then
reduce the candidates to txyice the
number of vacancies on Cardinals
and submit the list for election by
Cardinals as a whole. The body, in
its spring vote, retains at least
three, and not more than five mem
bers to serve a second term, and
then fills out the required ten by
election of new members.
Rally Committee and Women's
Committee appointments are made
by Cardinals at the same time on the
recommendation of the chairmen of
those two bodies. Each election finds
at least three sophomore members
on each of the two committees
elected to a junior term.
Logical Path
According to the relation which
exists between junior and senior
bodies, the logical path to Cardinals
should lead through Groups I and II
of Rally Committee. But, as one
rally committee member alleged,
prospective Cardinals may arrive not
through merit, but because (in the
case of the women) they "are cute,
and smile at the right people." The
oretically, the constitutional set-up
seems to imply a clear connection
between Rally Committee and Cardi
nals.
Charges of "log-rolling" come
when Cardinals appointments are
made outside the realm of their in
fluence—from other activity groups,
or, as is sometimes claimed, from
fraternity brothers, or politically im
portant leaders.
