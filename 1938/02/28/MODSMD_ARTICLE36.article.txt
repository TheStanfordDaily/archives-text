# Committee Is In Key Spot
## 
### 
As Ex Committee's chief work or- ,
ganization, and hub of campus ac- :
tivities, Cardinals controls most stu- |
dent projects. Working as a body of j
a whole, through individual members I
at heads of key committees, and j
through Rally Committee and Wom
en's Committee, the group handles
nearly all A.S.S.U. campus projects,
supervises activities affecting the
campus as a whole.
Cardinals, with Rally and Women's
Committees opens its year's duties
early in the fall with plans for ral
lies, parades, rooting sections, stunts,
and ticket sale promotions for foot- j
ball games. Biggest task is planning '
1 and carrying out the Big Game j
celebration—rally, bonfire, jolly-up, I
and the float parade, innovation of j
Cardinals this year.
In coincidence with game celebra- i
! tions aie Cardinal sponsored dances,
most of which come in fall quarter
after football games but which are j
; also held throughout the year. Head I
of the dance committee may be a j
! member of Cardinals, or may be ap- |
pointed by the body from the stu- I
dent body as a whole.
Cardinals is responsible for the two
most important campus drives — the
Red Cross drive, in the fall, and the
Convalescent Home drive in spring
| quarter. The latter involves the
: largest group engaged in a campus
J enterprise, is co-ordinated under a
j Cardinal member appointed by the
1 body with the approval of Ex Com
mittee. Constitutionally, the Con
valescent Home Drive is considered
an emergency campaign, but in real
ity, it is one of Cardinals' most im
portant prerogatives.
Cardinals is Stanford's official wel
comer. Appointed by the president, a
subcommittee divides among itself
the responsibility of meeting and
welcoming visiting celebrities,
speakers, athletic teams, coaches
This March they will be mustered to
meet and entertain the 300 Smith
College women who will visit
Stanford.
Other than specific duties, Cardi
nals has the general function of pro
moting any campus activity in need
of assistance. In this capacity, they
act as a general co-ordinator of
campus activity committees. ♦
Unofficially, Cardinals may become
a sounding board for student opin
ion, may investigate causes of stu
dent complaints. Last year, after
general feeling that Stanford's band
was something of a failure, Cardi
nals examined existing conditions,
sounded out student and faculty
leaders on the question.
Cardinals acts in special cases at
the instigation of Ex Committee.
They are under control of the gov
erning body in that all appointments
and plans must be approved in the
form of Cardinals minutes before
they become effective.
