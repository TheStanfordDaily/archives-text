## 
###

set by Dave Brock, 1-6, 6-4, 6-1, in
the feature match of the Berkeley
Tennis Club's unofficial 5-4 triumph
over the Indian net team on the
Berkeley courts last Saturday after
noon.

drive bothered Kovacs considerably
after the Card player got over his
nervousness in the opening set. Ko
vacs was erratic largely because
Brock returned so many seemingly
impossible shots.
Among the other winners for
Stanford were Captain Bob Under
wood and Bob Braly in singles and
the team of Laney and Gates in
doubles.
