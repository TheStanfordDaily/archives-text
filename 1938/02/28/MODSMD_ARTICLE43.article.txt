There was some fear felt in cer
tain quarters Friday night for the
safety of the U.C.L.A. basketball
players. It seems that the Bruins
were in danger of being trampled
upon by each other in their mad
rush to get back to their own end of
the court every time one of them
took a shot and missed.
From the very start it was ob
vious that U.C.L.A. wasn't inter
ested in winning the game. All
the Bruins wanted to do was to
keep the score fairly respectable.
They took the best way of going
about it, for they slowed down
Stanford quite well.
They can't take credit for that
slowing down as a demonstration
of their defensive ability, though.
What they do get credit for is damp
ening the Indians' ardor by their
refusal to fight. No team can get
interested in beating another team
if that team won't fight back.
Of all the teams Stanford has
faced in the last three years, this
year's U.C.L.A. varsity is the one
that showed the least amount of
backbone. There's a fundamental
philosophy that should be a part
of any and every team's morale,
and that's "get in there and light
whether or not you have one
chance in a million."
After the Friday game Captain
Hank Luisetti came off the court
and. said not a word to Coach John
Bunn. He only made a wry grimace
of disgust at the sluggish game.
Saturday night the Cards met the
same sort of thing, and Luisetti and
the whole gang played wishy-washy
ball.
All in all, it was a pretty rotten j
exibition on the part of U.C.L.A.
* <> *
Captain Paul Slaughter of the
Bruins certainly must have felt
silly Friday night the first time
Luisetti passed the ball between his
widespread feet, but he certainly
couldn't have felt any sillier than
lie looked when Hank did it the
second time. That's the acme of j
playing the opponent instead of the
ball.
And Will Munkers was slightly
nonplussed Saturday night when
Phil Zonne plucked the ball like a j
ripe cherry from his hands as he I
held it high over his head looking ,
for a receiver. i

Track Coach Dink Templeton
called it on the nose when he said
last Monday, before Ray Malott left
for the National A.A.U. indoor meet
in New York, that he didn't expect;
the captain to do better than fourth j
or fifth in the (500-meter run. Ray j
ran fourth on the boards. He will j
do much better at a quarter mile j
outdoors, for that's his

note that Stanford is still getting j
the shot putters. In the Frosh- I
San Mateo J. C. meet Saturday
A1 Grey led a Card sweep in the
shot with a put of better than 4S
feet. Considering that it was the
first meet of the season, that is j
little short of sensational.
Also. Jpid Hayes' :15 flat in the 120
is remarkable for such an early j
season test. That compares favor- j
ably with the varsity mark turned |
jll in practice a little over a week j
ago by Bill Hawkins, :14.6. Haw- j
kins' time marks him as something |
to behold. At that, he is being
hard pressed by Dick Simpson, j

neck with the experienced Haw
kins throughout the season.

There was some fear felt in cer
tain quarters Friday night for the
safety of the U.C.L.A. basketball
players. It seems that the Bruins
were in danger of being trampled
upon by each other in their mad
rush to get back to their own end of
the court every time one of them
took a shot and missed.
From the very start it was ob
vious that U.C.L.A. wasn't inter
ested in winning the game. All
the Bruins wanted to do was to
keep the score fairly respectable.
They took the best way of going
about it, for they slowed down
Stanford quite well.
They can't take credit for that
slowing down as a demonstration
of their defensive ability, though.
What they do get credit for is damp
ening the Indians' ardor by their
refusal to fight. No team can get
interested in beating another team
if that team won't fight back.
Of all the teams Stanford has
faced in the last three years, this
year's U.C.L.A. varsity is the one
that showed the least amount of
backbone. There's a fundamental
philosophy that should be a part
of any and every team's morale,
and that's "get in there and light
whether or not you have one
chance in a million."
After the Friday game Captain
Hank Luisetti came off the court
and. said not a word to Coach John
Bunn. He only made a wry grimace
of disgust at the sluggish game.
Saturday night the Cards met the
same sort of thing, and Luisetti and
the whole gang played wishy-washy
ball.
All in all, it was a pretty rotten j
exibition on the part of U.C.L.A.

Captain Paul Slaughter of the
Bruins certainly must have felt
silly Friday night the first time
Luisetti passed the ball between his
widespread feet, but he certainly
couldn't have felt any sillier than
lie looked when Hank did it the
second time. That's the acme of j
playing the opponent instead of the
ball.
