# Indian Boxers Lose To Cal
## 
### 
Cal mittmen, who undecisively
took the nod in four of six varsity
boxing bouts at Cal last Thursday,
will climb into the Card ring for an
other try on Thursday for their last
varsity appearance of the season.
In last week's battles, nearly all
Card men lost by eyelash decisions
resulting mostly from cuts. The
two Card victors, Bill Wilbur and
Hugh Gallarneau, had very little
trouble with their men, Gallarneau
bringing distinction to the Farm by
earning the trophy presented for the
most scientific boxing of the eve
ning.
