## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Cardinal Rugbymen Trounce O.C., 14-0 
### 
Stanford's varsity ruggers looked like an entirely different team from
the one that fought U.S.C. to a 3-3 tie the week-end before, as they over
powered one of the strongest Olympic Club fifteens iti years Saturday
afternoon in the Stanford Stadium by a 14-0 score.
By handing the club team its first defeat of (lie season, the Indians

►overcame their greatest obstacle in
their drive to retain their 1937
Northern California Rugby Union
championship. They still need vic
tories over U.S.F. and California on
successive Saturdays to hold on to
their title.
After both teams had failed to
convert numerous scoring oppor
tunities and had fought to a 0-0
standstill in the first half, the Cards
came to life in the second period
and played the best ball they have
all year. Karl Schaupp started the
fireworks by picking up a loose ball
and, on the dead run, dropping a
sensational 25-yard kick for four
points.
A few minutes later, Deane John
son intercepted an Olympic Club
pass and ran 30 yards for a try after
which Wayne Richardson converted.
With five minutes to play, Jack
Wright blocked a club kick and
George Ditz ran 20 yards for an
other try. Richardson converted
again to end the scoring.
In a second game, Stanford's
Junior Varsity kept its undefeated
record clean by downing the Olym
pic Club seconds, 14-0, for their
third straight victory of the season.
