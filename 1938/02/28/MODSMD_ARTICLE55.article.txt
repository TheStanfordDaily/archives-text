# Frosh Swimmers Set Relay Mark
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman swimming
trio came through as expected Sat
urday to set a new national fresh
man intercollegiate mark in the 300-
yard medley relay as the yearlings
trounced San Jose State frosh, 40-
29.
The Indian varsity defeated the
Spartans, 55-22, but lost to the
Olympic Club on Friday night, 43-
32, when Herb Brotman and Buster
Olds of the club upset Stanford's
stars. Roy Vitousek, Bill Weeden
and Chuck Wiper set new na
tional mark of 3:10 which erased the
old standard of 3:11.2 formerly held
by Yale. Vitousek was .2 of a second
slower than the listed world's rec
ord for the first of his 100-yard lap.
Only two first places were taken
by the Spartan varsity men as the
Cards sought a measure of condo
lence after their first defeat of the
season by the still unconquered
Olympians.
