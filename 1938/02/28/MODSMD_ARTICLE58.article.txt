# Frosh Batters Win 9-0 Over Sacramento
## 'Cootie'' Thompson Strikes Out Nineteen For Farm Victory 
### 
Striking out 19 Sacramento High
batters while allowing only one hit,
"Cootie" Thompson, ace frosh pitch
er, led his teammates to a convincing
9-0 victory Saturday morning on
the freshman diamond.
In striking out the imposing array
of batsmen, "Cootie" surpassed his
former mark of 14 strikeouts and at
the same time set a new high for all
time yearling pitching in the strike
out line.
Amassing nine runs, the Papooses
hit safely five times, led by red
headed Monte Pfyl who slammed
out a homer and a three bagger.
"Ush" Tucker aided in the rout of
three Sacramento pitchers by chalk
ing up another triple on a Sacra
mento error.
Backing up Thompson's hurling in
superb form, the frosh infield played
by far their best game to date. Pfyl
and Tucker played their usual
sterling ball, aided by Herb Bull at
short. Bull, still leading the team in
batting honors was held hitless. Fay,
breaking into the beginning lineup
behind the plate, turned in a spark
ling game.
This afternoon the squad will
start their fourth encounter of the
season against Jefferson High School
at 3:30 o'clock on the frosh diamond.
Monte Pfyl will probably get the
starting call to pitch, with either Fay
or Atkinson behind the plate. Start
ing lineups are still tentative.
