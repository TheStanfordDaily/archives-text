# Good Man, Willy
## 
### 
HOSPITALITY brushed the wrinkles out of
her dress and took a curtain call last week
when the Stanford Ski Club invited all inter
ested faculty members to spend a week-end at
Yosemite as guests of the Club. There is no
way of telling how many professors will accept.
Perhaps none will. But the invitation remains
—socially as graceful as a continental bow,
tactically as brilliant as the battle of Austerlitz.
All of which means that Willy Meyer, presi
dent of the Club, is Stanford's number one man
on horseback. Of course, being a man on
horseback is not a new experience to Willy
Meyer. As organizer and leader of the largest
integrated organization in school, he has ac
quired a good deal of experience in riding
managerial chargers. But this latest move pro
vides a nice climax to brilliant exhibition of
organizational horsemanship. It also proves
that strategy and skilled maneuvering are not
confined to the battlefield.
Meyer's record at Stanford is marked by a
list of tactical moves that must have secured
an approving smile from even Napoleon's ego
tistical ghost. When Meyer arrived from Swit
zerland a year and a half ago he found his pas
sionate interest in skiing blocked by the fact
that the only ski club on the campus was a
lethargic dancing class, more interested in
clothes than in skis.
And so Meyer took the club over, fed it with
enthusiasm, dosed it with organizing ability,
ind nursed it into a membership of over 300.
Today the club is the largest closely organized
group on the campus. And Meyer with its back
ing has almost a monopoly on the market for
discreet coups d'etat.
Early this quarter he drove minor sport rec
ognition past Ex Committee, and missed suc
cess only because officialdom interfered.
Checked on that point, Meyer retired from the
field in good order. He was not involved in the
useless barrage of petitions that followed. He
retreated at precisely the right time, which was
a point on which even Napoleon was a bit
weak.
But the latest move tops all for strategy. It
advances student-faculty relations, pet project
of all the powers that be or want to be. It
gives the Club a week-end of good sport. And
it swings the faculty solidly behind the Club.
The whole plan sounds vaguely like an excerpt
from a biography of Bismarck.
And so Willy Meyer moves into the position
of Stanford's man of the hour. It is fortunate
perhaps that he didn't concentrate on politics.
We love our muddling constitutional system,
and it might not stand too much of a shaking.
This question will not arise. Next quarter
Meyer plans to leave Stanford, and so we
won't have to worry about the effect an organ
ized body of 300 enthusiastic voters would have
on our creaking electoral system.
But, before he leaves, the Ski Club moves on
toward minor sport recognition. Carthage had
her Hannibal; France had her Napoleon. Stan
ford has her Meyer. And if this be a boost, we
can trust him to make the most of it.—J. C.
