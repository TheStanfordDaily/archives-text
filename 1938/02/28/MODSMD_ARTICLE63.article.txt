WITH six months of production behind them,
Stagers and the Division of Speech and
Drama seem to have found their niches in
Stanford ■ dramatics. The Division is interested
in putting on good plays, well done; Stagers
are seeking to give the campus what it wants.
So far, Stagers' chief attempt to cater to cam
pus tastes has been the producion of student
written shows. They might assure themselves
of even better service to their dramatic custo
mers by offering a menu from which the stu
dents can order.
A plan to set up such a sounding board was
used a few weeks ago at U.S.C. After drawing
up a list of five plays, Play Productions—coun
terpart of Stagers — left the final choice to the
students themselves. Votes were recorded on
ballots printed in The Daily Trojan.
Aside from the advertising Stagers would
gain, the plan would be a subtle sop to campus
egos. Witli the students choosing productions

—under Stager's guidance—no kick could be
raised that student producers were letting the
campus down with unpopular plays.
Stagers have elected themselves doctor to
treat students who complain that the Division's
diet of art gives them indigestion. With such a
poll as the S.C. group used, they could deter
mine exactly what the patient needs. And if he
complained that he was as bad off as before,
Stagers could say: "Nyaaa, you asked for it
and we gave it to you."—J. S.
