TOLERANCE
"It would be so much simpler if they were all lazy
damned loafers."
Sitting in the Curran Theater Saturday night, that
remark of a friend of mine came to mind again, as it
had frequently since Thursday. It had been made then
in a bull-session following Marian Anderson's concert
in Memorial Hall; and watching "Porgy and Bess," I
was impressed once more with its expression of a cer
tain fundamental attitude which exists in this country,
and in no other where a persecuted minority lives.
I could not imagine that reluctant recognition of
individual worth, that exasperated feeling of help
lessness, in Germany, for instance. No Jewish singer
is applauded while members of her race are being
lynched. With the rationalists of the Rhine it is every
thing or nothing. The Reich js no two-headed Janus
of sadism and sentimentalism, self-congratulatory tol
erance and the most ruthless cruelty.
Nor could I imagine it in France, where black men
come up from the colonies and are accepted by their
masters and no questions asked; nor in England, who,
whatever she feels, obeys the law; nor in any other
land, indeed, but ours, where the heritage of England
and the heritage of the pioneer West have mingled to
produce a curious mixture of enthusiastic good-will
and vicious intolerance.
For this is America, based on the strange principle
of liberty and justice for all; and many things can
happen here which do not happen in other lands whose
philosophies of "power to the strong" and "might makes
right" give them such simple and easily rationalized
points of view.
* * * *
r PHE Negroes can claim—and wc are very quick to
give them credit for it, since the dollar sign has a
miraculous way of banishing race prejudice—a Marian
Anderson, a Paul Robeson, a Julia Peterkin. They
have produced great educators, great humanitarians,
great people. It is not a very nice thing to remember
that they have produced and can claim 90 per cent of
all the mutilated bodies hanging from the trees in
America.
And so I stopped thinking about it, presently, be
cause it was spoiling my evening for me. I asked my
self the usual question: "What good can worrying about
it do?" and went on to something else.
I tried not to remember that an anti-lynching bill
had just been filibustered to a standstill in the United
States Senate; I tried to forget mob justice, and the
racial intolerance which lies like a pall on America.
I turned instead to remembering a gracious woman
who is sending superb voice across the stages of the
nation, bringing happiness and pleasure to many thou
sands of her fellow Americans; I tried to concentrate
on the opera I was seeing, with its friendly, sympa
thetic portrayal of Negro life; I tried to recall the few
instances of actual tolerance I had heard about in this
land of ours.
But presently I stopped that, too, because some
how it seemed rather pointless, and not quite sincere.
"It would be so much simpler if they were all lazy
damned loafers." But they aren't, and there's nothing
to be done about it. So I ended by dismissing the whole
thing from my mind. I was getting nowhere. No one
ever does.
I settled back to watch "Porgy and Bess." All
around me, others were doing the same. Wc were all
so glad we were white.—Allen Drury.

TOLERANCE
"It would be so much simpler if they were all lazy
damned loafers."
Sitting in the Curran Theater Saturday night, that
remark of a friend of mine came to mind again, as it
had frequently since Thursday. It had been made then
in a bull-session following Marian Anderson's concert
in Memorial Hall; and watching "Porgy and Bess," I
was impressed once more with its expression of a cer
tain fundamental attitude which exists in this country,
and in no other where a persecuted minority lives.
I could not imagine that reluctant recognition of
individual worth, that exasperated feeling of help
lessness, in Germany, for instance. No Jewish singer
is applauded while members of her race are being
lynched. With the rationalists of the Rhine it is every
thing or nothing. The Reich js no two-headed Janus
of sadism and sentimentalism, self-congratulatory tol
erance and the most ruthless cruelty.
Nor could I imagine it in France, where black men
come up from the colonies and are accepted by their
masters and no questions asked; nor in England, who,
whatever she feels, obeys the law; nor in any other
land, indeed, but ours, where the heritage of England
and the heritage of the pioneer West have mingled to
produce a curious mixture of enthusiastic good-will
and vicious intolerance.
For this is America, based on the strange principle
of liberty and justice for all; and many things can
happen here which do not happen in other lands whose
philosophies of "power to the strong" and "might makes
right" give them such simple and easily rationalized
points of view.

r PHE Negroes can claim—and wc are very quick to
give them credit for it, since the dollar sign has a
miraculous way of banishing race prejudice—a Marian
Anderson, a Paul Robeson, a Julia Peterkin. They
have produced great educators, great humanitarians,
great people. It is not a very nice thing to remember
that they have produced and can claim 90 per cent of
all the mutilated bodies hanging from the trees in
America.
And so I stopped thinking about it, presently, be
cause it was spoiling my evening for me. I asked my
self the usual question: "What good can worrying about
it do?" and went on to something else.
I tried not to remember that an anti-lynching bill
had just been filibustered to a standstill in the United
States Senate; I tried to forget mob justice, and the
racial intolerance which lies like a pall on America.
I turned instead to remembering a gracious woman
who is sending superb voice across the stages of the
nation, bringing happiness and pleasure to many thou
sands of her fellow Americans; I tried to concentrate
on the opera I was seeing, with its friendly, sympa
thetic portrayal of Negro life; I tried to recall the few
instances of actual tolerance I had heard about in this
land of ours.
