most of Stanford's amateur athletes arc Ret
ting their exercise paddling on the lake these
days and nights, some of them are going ice-skating in
the city.
It's not a bad way of spending a few hours. You
come away feeling very healthy, and while you're
skating, the sensation of sliding gracefully, or not so
gracefully, over the smooth ice is slightly exhilarating.
Of course, if you're something of a beginner, you're
ankles do get pretty tired after the second round, but
you can rest them up in the all women or all men
skating periods. And in spite of what people tell you,
ice isn't so awfully hard nor so awfully wet—if you
fall right. Besides, if you're lucky, it won't cost you
too blarsted much.
There arc two ice-skating rinks in the city. One of
them is on Sutter across the street from the Dream
land Auditorium. The other is at Sutro's out by the
beach. Of the two, we like the place at Sutro's. It is
a little more expensive, but it's larger and close to the
beach. The place closes at 10:30, so it's good to have
some place convenient to go to after you leave there.
Some people tell us it's a good place to take a date,
and we don't doubt it. But then it's also one of the
better places to go stag. Compared to the roller skat
ing rinks, the music they play there is good. Some
times you feel that you are almost skating to the
rhythm of some not-too-fast piece.
After skating, you may want to go to the beach.
You have probably been to amusement parks like it
since you were six years old, and you probably know
all about them. They're all pretty much the same.
There's the roller-coaster, which isn't too good as
roller-coasters go. and the loopo-plane, which is good,
the fun house—if you don't think you're too old for
such things, the dodge 'em, and the surprisingly popu
lar merry-go-round. Of course there are a dozen other
things there, too, which you can spend, or waste, your
money on, but they're lesser things. With the help of
hoarse-voiced barkers, you'll find them all.
The ice-skating-beach combination at least is some
thing different, something not quite like the usual eve
ning in the city. And you may find some unsuspected
Sonja Henie talents in yourself during the night's
skating. Jaquts.
