# THE NEWS IN REVIEW From United Press
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
j lISTORY-MAKING precedents
on the rights of labor organiza
tion may well be the outcome of
three verdicts issued yesterday by
the United States Supreme Court.
ll,v 5-2 votes, the court voided a
Milwaukee fede r a I injunction
against picketing, upheld outlaw
ing "company unions" by the Na
tional Labor Board, and refused
to review a New York case chal
lenging the legality of the "closed
shop."
At the same time the court agreed
to review the legal aspects of one of
the strongest weapons of the labor
board—the power to order the re
instatement of workers found to
have been discharged because of
union activities.
Demonstrations by outlawed Aus
trian National Socialists against the
Fatherland Front dictatorship of
Kurt Schuschnigg spread yesterday
from the southern province of Styria
northward towards the German bor
der, as the government decreed a
state of "semi-alarm."
Indicative that all is not well
in the recently organized Vienna
cabinet, which includes five Nazi
partisans, were reports that Min
ister of Interior Arthur Von
Seyss-Inquart faces the alterna
tive of immediately bringing his
followers under control or being
dismissed from the government.
More than 6000 government troops
are now in control of Graz, Styrian
capital, and about 80 Nazi leaders
were jailed. In Vienna moi'e than
100 monarchists as well as left
wingers were arrested for voicing
opposition to Schuschnigg.
which has had more
than 30 different premiers since
the end of the World War, is now
embroiled in another of its periodic
political crises, which are ended
only by cabinet changes.
Radical Socialist Premier Ca
mille Chauiemps, who several
weeks ago threw out of his cabi
net Socialist ministers headed by
Leon Blum, is threatening to re
sign because of Senate opposition
to the enactment of new labor
arbitration measures.
Although he won a 439 to 2 vote
of confidence Sunday on foreign
policy, the Premier appears deter
mined to force the upper house to
agree to the Chamber's provisions
for compulsory arbitration of labor
disputes.
Unless a compromise is reached
today, a new vote of confidence will
have to be taken, wlpich might be
followed by the establishment of a
"national union" government in
cluding left and center parties.
Renewed congressional battles be
tween supporters of the Administra
tion's rearmament plans and allied
"isolationists" and neutrality advo
cates can be expected to follow the
meeting in London today of naval
experts of the United States, Britain,
and France, who will make joint
plans for building "super battle
ships."
In Washington the House Naval
Affairs Committee concluded four
weeks of testimony on the navy
bill, and heard airplane manu
facturer Glenn L. Martin urge the
building of "the greatest air fleet
in the world" and "a navy second
to none."
