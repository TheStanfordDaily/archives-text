# N.B.C. Considers College Program
## 
### 
Walter Winchell's super
snoop program, giving inter
esting and piquant looks into
the private lives of the elite,
may soon have a godchild on
the air if plans for a collegiate
gossip program are carried out.
The plan, according to its ad
vocate, E. L. Barker of local
N.B.C. studios, is to present in
timate glimpses of the collegiate
life in coast universities from a
typical Winchell angle. Three or
four students, whose identities
would necessarily be kept se
cret, would act as agents on
each campus.
The program, which would
probably appear weekly, would
be calculated to appeal ex
pressly to the collegiate group.
