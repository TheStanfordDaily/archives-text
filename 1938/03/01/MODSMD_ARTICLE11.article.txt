# Lagunitans Ding Change In Elections
## Conferenceâ€”-Selected Committee Would Nominate Under Plan 
### 
Politics began its first spring
rumblings on the campus last night
as Lagunita branded "unfair and in
consistent with Stanford's policy,"
Women's Conference's latest idea for
dealing with the present election
system.
Under the plan now in operation,
nominations are by caucus within
the Hall and Row living groups; un
der a revised system, Conference
would be free to appoint a commit
tee of seven senior women to choose
th nominees for each of the elected
offices on Women's Conference.
This would include the vice presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., class represen
tatives, Women's Council and Con
ference officers.
As planned, the committee will
consist of two members from La
gunita, two from the Row, two from
the Union, and one from Roble. If
the measure is passed at the next
Conference meeting, the committee
will consist of Cis Coonley, Confer
ence president; Barbara Murphy,
A.S.S.U. vice-president; Winnie
Jean Smith, Conference vice-presi
dent; Barbara Bailey, Jean Hemphill,
Jane Tanner, and Jean Bird.
A similar system was tried last
year in which 15 women, who at
the time were holding offices, chose
nominees for their offices. Caucuses
were not barred as the new plan
will attempt. Failure was due to the
unequal representation from the
living groups.
Last week a joint meeting of the
old and new Union excommittees
opposed the plan on the failure of
the system last year.
Objections in Lagunita numbered
four:
1. It would take voting out of the
hands of the women students by
having their candidates chosen for
them.
2. Hall-Row representation on the
committee is not fair but would favor
the Hall.
3. Seven women can hardly tell
the rest of the women on the cam
pus for whom they may vote.
4. The caucus would be eliminat
ed, which is the sole means the
Hall has for boosting their candidate
as they do not exact a fine for fail
ure to vote.
At yesterday's meeting, new
members of Conference from the
Union were presented. They are:
Virginia Cromwell, Union Unit;
Putzie Hinrichs, Union House; Bar
bara Schurmeier, Madrono; Beatrice
Springer, Mariposa; Sammie Rus
sell, Hawthorne; Adel Watkins, Elm;
and Virginia Seerie, Manzanita.
President Coonley, Caroline Hib
bard, and Jean Reynolds will be the
Stanford delegates to the Western
Intercollegiate Association of Wom
en Students convention to be held in
Pullman, Wash., April 13 to 15.
Plans have been completed for the
new course in girl scouting to be
called Education 110. A resolution
was passed requiring women to sign
in from late leaves on the night they
return, instead of the next day.

the Hall and Row living groups; un
der a revised system, Conference
would be free to appoint a commit
tee of seven senior women to choose
th nominees for each of the elected
offices on Women's Conference.
This would include the vice presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., class represen
tatives, Women's Council and Con
ference officers.
As planned, the committee will
consist of two members from La
gunita, two from the Row, two from
the Union, and one from Roble. If
the measure is passed at the next
Conference meeting, the committee
will consist of Cis Coonley, Confer
ence president; Barbara Murphy,
A.S.S.U. vice-president; Winnie
Jean Smith, Conference vice-presi
dent; Barbara Bailey, Jean Hemphill,
Jane Tanner, and Jean Bird.
A similar system was tried last
year in which 15 women, who at
the time were holding offices, chose
nominees for their offices. Caucuses
were not barred as the new plan
will attempt. Failure was due to the
unequal representation from the
living groups.
Last week a joint meeting of the
old and new Union excommittees
opposed the plan on the failure of
the system last year.
Objections in Lagunita numbered
four:
1. It would take voting out of the
hands of the women students by
having their candidates chosen for
them.
2. Hall-Row representation on the
committee is not fair but would favor
the Hall.
3. Seven women can hardly tell
the rest of the women on the cam
pus for whom they may vote.
4. The caucus would be eliminat
ed, which is the sole means the
Hall has for boosting their candidate
as they do not exact a fine for fail
ure to vote.
At yesterday's meeting, new
members of Conference from the
Union were presented. They are:
Virginia Cromwell, Union Unit;
Putzie Hinrichs, Union House; Bar
bara Schurmeier, Madrono; Beatrice
Springer, Mariposa; Sammie Rus
sell, Hawthorne; Adel Watkins, Elm;
and Virginia Seerie, Manzanita.
President Coonley, Caroline Hib
bard, and Jean Reynolds will be the
Stanford delegates to the Western
Intercollegiate Association of Wom
en Students convention to be held in
Pullman, Wash., April 13 to 15.
Plans have been completed for the
new course in girl scouting to be
called Education 110. A resolution
was passed requiring women to sign
in from late leaves on the night they
return, instead of the next day.
Politics began its first spring
rumblings on the campus last night
as Lagunita branded "unfair and in
consistent with Stanford's policy,"
Women's Conference's latest idea for
dealing with the present election
system.
Under the plan now in operation,
nominations are by caucus within
the Hall and Row living groups; un
der a revised system, Conference
would be free to appoint a commit
tee of seven senior women to choose
th nominees for each of the elected
offices on Women's Conference.
