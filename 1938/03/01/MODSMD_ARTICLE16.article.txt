# Drive Heads Face Study By Excom
## Cardinals' Selections Of Chairmen May Be Vetoed At Session 
### 
Cardinals may go under the Ex
Committee microscope tonight
when their minutes, including Con
valescent Home Drive appointments,
come up for approval by the com
mittee.
Widespread rumors last night held
that Ex Committee will question or
possibly throw out some of the ap
pointments. At the root of most ob
jections to Cardinals' choice of
Drive chairmen appeared to be the
iact that nine of the twelve are
members of Cardinals.
Past Objections
Past objections to the drive ap
pointments have included the fol
lowing: 1. Too many of the chairmen
were Cardinals. 2. Too few of the
chairmen were Cardinals. 3. Too
high a percentage of those appoint
ed were juniors. 4. Too low a per
centage of those appointed were
juniors.
The committee chairmen coming
up for approval of their appointments
are Bud Milligan, general chairman;
Pat McMurtry and Betty Davis,
women's co-chairmen; John Rice,
treasurer; Jim Ransohoff and Beth
Allen, off-campus co-chairmen;
Richard Dudman, publicity chair
man; Dave Ryus, Labor Day chair
man; Don Dewar and Jan North,
Masque Ball co-chairmen; Ed Bar
nett and Isabel Goldthwaite, jolly
up co-chairmen. .
Other Problems
Also up for Ex Committee consid
eration will be a proposal that the
constitution be changed to allow
initiative as well as referendum ac
tion by the student body. Occasion
of this move, according to President
Tom Killefer, is Ski Club's recent
unsuccessful attempt to initiate a
ruling making skiing a minor sport
at Stanford.
Final action is expected to be
taken on regulation of campus fund
drives in the form of a by-law. As
it now stands, the tentative plan
would make it necessary for all
drives to have Ex Committee ap
proval before being started.
Same as Dates
Such regulation would be much
the same as the granting of dates.
Certain "drives," such as Quad and
Chaparral sales, will be given au
tomatic approval each year, said
Killefer.
Killefer will announce appoint
ment of three men to the planning
committee for the leadership insti
tute to be held spring quarter. One
of the objections to last year's in
stitute was that women made all
the arrangements and that few men
participated.
The committee also will consider
the tentative visit of the Pomona
College Glee Club to Stanford April
10.
