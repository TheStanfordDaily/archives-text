# Economist Says Nazis Aim for War

A refugee from Communistic
i Russia who first sought academic
I freedom in Fascist Germany, but did
I not find it until he came to the
| United States: That is the story of
j Dr. Naum Jasny who will be an act-
J ing associate economist in Stanford's
| Food Research Institute during the
spring and summer quarters.
Although officially a Soviet citi
zen, Dr. Jasny left Russia in 1921
because he was not allowed the in
tellectual independence necessary to
do research work. In Germany, he
j still found everything "politicized"—
| there was no freedom of teaching
and professors were expelled who
! did not teach the "right" point of
! view.
| The Nobel Prize in the interna-
I tional study of physics was Riven to
I Dr. Jasny, who wrote a book en
i titled "The German Physics." In
11933 hr left Germany to work for

| the Agricultural Adjustment Ad
j ministration in Washington, D. C.,
which he left to come to Stanford.
"Hitler is leading the world to
another war, to much difficulty,
| backward movement, and future
j world confusion, whether we know
it or not.
"In from three to five days, Ger
| many, as far as its food supply is
concerned, could be on a war foot
ing," pointed out Dr. Jasny, formerly
: foreign correspondent of the Food
! Research Institute in Germany and
a member of the staff of the Insti
tute fur Landwirtschaftliche Markt
furschung of Berlin.
"The food difficulties of Germany
.ire greatly exaggerated. The food
I is not always good—but there is no
hunger, no under-nourishment. The
entire food machinery is preparatory
for war.
"This is perhaps the first time in
history of the world that food

[ supplies have been conducted in
times of peace in a manner in which
j it is usual to conduct them in war
; time. Regimentation has been ex
tended as it has never been extended
j before in the history of the world.
"Germany's food resources are
1 better prepared to sustain her now
than they were during the World
l War. She produces all her own fer
tilizers now, and is much less de
' pendent on foreign supplies than
ever before. She would not have to
plunder Rumania or Hungary for
food, as she did during the last war.
i Germany is self-sufficient —to as
i great a degree as it is possible for
any nation to be.
"It would take the United States
probably a year or so of floundering
before her food control would be in
efficient war condition. The Ameri
| can people are not easily put in the
prison-jackets of discipline, con
! eluded Dr. Jasny.
