### 
Right of the State of Calazoma to
exclude persons frcm entering the
state will be argued before a Moot
Court in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall tomorrow night at 7:30
o'clock.
The case is that of the Slate of
Calazoma vs. Montgomery, and is
the last trial in the School of Law's
Moot Court series.
Three-Judge Court
The suit will be argued before
Judge Alden Ames of San Fran
cisco, Judge H. J. Jorgensen of
Salinas, and Judge William F. James
of San Jose, all widely known. The
decision will be based on the man
ner of presentation, validity of
arguments, and on the brief of the
case, rather than on law.
The three-judge bench will ask
questions throughout the trial in
order to maintain audience interest
and prevent the trial from becoming
a debate. A $50 award will be made
to the winning team.
Four Law Students *
Sidney DeGoff and Charles Bart
lett will be counsel for the state,
and Bob Grantier and John McFar
land will be defense attorneys.
Theme for the trial is the action
of Los Angeles in 1935 of sending its
police force to patrol the border of
the state to prevent entry of im
poverished transients. A bill per
mitting the action was introduced
in the state legislature, but was
killed.
Montgomery vs. Calazoma
In the case before the Moot Court,
the State of Calazoma has a law
stating that paupers and diseased
persons may be forbidden entry.
Anyone caught entering may be
given a hearing and is subject to
fine and imprisonment or deporta
tion.
Montgomery, a vagrant, entering
without permission, was found to
have tuberculosis and was to be de
ported. He appeals his cause to the
"Supreme Court" saying the law
violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
The State contends it. is exercising
its police power and protecting the
health and livelihood of its citizens.
