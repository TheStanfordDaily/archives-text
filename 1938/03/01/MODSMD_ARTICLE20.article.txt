# Senior Prom To Be Formal
## Complaints Bring Shift In Plans 
### 
That the Senior Prom will be
formal instead of semi-formal, as
was previously announced, was the
decision last night of Prom Chair
man A1 Hyman.
The change was made after many
complaints on the part of students
who argued that Stanford's "semi
formal tradition" is not fitting for
some of the larger campus dances.
With Eddy Duchin and his 14-
piece orchestra definitely signed for
the prom on April 1 (April Fool's
Day), bids will be put on sale this
week at $3.50 apiece, according to
Hyman.
Duchin will be accompanied by
'wo vocalistsâ€”radio stars Patricia
Norman and Stanley Worth. One
of the youngest top-notch band
leaders, "Society's favorite," Duchin
leads the orchestra with his head,
keeps his hand busy at the key
board.
Working with Hyman on the prom
committee are Bill Allen. Bob Gar
retson, Kay Kloster, Margaret Loud,
and John Rice.
