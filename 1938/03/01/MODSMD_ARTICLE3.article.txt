# Jacobsen To Talk Before Engineers
## 
### 
The regular monthly meeting of
the Structural Engineers Association
will be held at Stanford today. As
sembly will be held at the Hotel
President in Palo Alto, where din
ner will be served at 6 o'clock.
Professor Jacobsen will lecture on
"Experimentally Determined Dy
namic Shears in a 16-story Building
Model." Both before and after the
45-minute lecture, which will be
illustrated with slides, the associa
tion wiil be able to see the actual
experiments on the model. The lec
ture will be given in Room 421 of
the Mechanics of Materials Labora
tory Building, where the models are
located.
Professor Jacobsen has finished a
long investigation of dynamic load
ings on this model with the first
story uniformly rigid, normal, slight
ly flexible, and flexible. The results
are very practical and differ from
current methods in several respects.
