# Cellar Keeps Red Water In Gas Pump
## 
### 
When William Gunther, who is in
charge of the cigarette and candy
counter at the Union, says that the
water in his familiar lighter-fluid
gas pump hasn't been changed for
J eight years, he doesn't mean that the
j container is just a hoax.
The colored fluid in the top of the
! thing is nothing but touched up
water and is a decoy, but he has the
real stuff in a can underneath the
water jar.
"The water was put in th°re when
we dismantled the old Roos store
and had this counter fixed up nearly
| eight years ago by Leon Carley, who
J is now a lawyer in Palo Alto," Mr.
1 Gunther said.
"It hasn't been changed since then.
| All of it that is gone—it is about
I half empty—has evaporated," he
I added. In spite of the metal cage
! around it, the water is in nothing
| but an old jelly glass.
"I thought I had lost it the other
day when it was knocked over on
I the floor," Gunther said. "But I
| hadn't. The metal top just got dent
j ed a little."
Until a few years ago, the fluid
' filler used to be stolen regularly.
"But *1 stopped that," he said.
"Whenever it stolen, I wouldn't
! give matches to anyone until it was
[ brought back. It was never gone
i long."
