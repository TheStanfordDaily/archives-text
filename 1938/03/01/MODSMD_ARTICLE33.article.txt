# Strike Paralyzes Wholesale Grocers
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 28 (UP).
I â€”The wholesale grocery industry of
San Francisco and Oakland faced an
indefinite period of paralysis today
as the result of a controversy be
| tween employers and warehouse
j unionists.
j Affected directly by the labor
| strife were 32 warehouses and 500
i men. Fifteen hundred others were
j affected indirectly. Union officials
i estimated an additional 500 team
] sters might be drawn into the con
| troversy, which arose from the dis-
I charge of a union steward at the
: Magstrom food warehouse in Oak
land last week.
