# Walrus Clubmen To Hear Trueblood
## 
### 
"Are we heading for a barnyard
civilization?" is the question which
will be discussed from opposite
standpoints by Dr. Trueblood and
Marco Thorne at a Walrus Club
panel in the lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse tomorrow night from 7:30
until 9 o'clock.
The meeting, which is the last of
the quarter, is open to students and
faculty who will participate in an
informal discussion following the
main speakers. About 35 people
attended the three cornered discus
sion of the Japanese boycott at the
Walrus Club meeting last Wednes
day.
