## HELP NEEDED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems that last Wednesday I
lost a pair of glasses either in the
History building or on the way to
Encina Hall (see classified ad sec
tion). Also, I have found it necessary
to make daily rounds to about a
dozen lost and found departments
in this University.
First of all, I can't see the neces
sity for so many of these depart
ments. Of course, each one con
cerned has been courteous and will
ing to cooperate in finding my lost
"windows," but the fact still re
mains that I need them for reading
! and finals are near at hand. With my
i name inside of them, someone who
j has found them might surely return
j them by now.
Second of all, since I am not as
j wealthy as I would like to be, the
! cost of buying a new pair is prohi
bitive. Can't someone do something
about unifying Stanford's Lost and
Found system. It. would aid in re
turning many dollars' worth of lost
property to people. Also, will tho
i finder of my glasses be a good fel
! low and return them?
—Marco Thorne.
