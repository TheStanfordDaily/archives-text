# Gen. Pershing Rallies; Hope For Life Seen
## Condition Is Critical As Heart Threatens To End Struggle 
### 
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 28 (UP). — 1
The gods of battles fought on the
side of General John J. Pershing
tonight and death retreated a little
farther from his sick bed.
The most optimistic bulletin that j
has been issued since all hope !
seemed lost Saturday night came j
from the little cottage where the
commander of- the American expe- I
ditionary forces is suffering—in his |
77th year—from a complication of
heart and kidney ailments.
For the first time, Pershing's
physicians mentioned the possibility
that he might rise from his sick
bed. Death still is near the little j
cottage on the grounds of the desert
sanitorium, however.
In Danger Yet
A heart strained by rigorous ex
ercise in old age may give up any
time. But two factors were in favor
of the general. His kidneys are
functioning, although not complete
ly, and the threat of uremic poison
ing is not so great.
Dr. Roland Davison, weary from
long vigils at the general's bedside,
read this bulletin in mid-day:
"General Pershing has improved
considerably since early morning. 1
am distinctly encouraged even i
though I realize his condition still is
critical.
Condition Better
"He is definitely stronger and has
been conscious most of the morning,
and has taken fluids by the mouth
very well. The kidney function ap
parently has been re-established, :
and while blood chemistry studies
show the kidney function is not yet
returned to normal, there is definite
improvement there. If he can con
tinue the progress made this morn- j
ing, the outlook is quite promising.
"However, I definitely realize the
improvement of this morning may
be only temporary and until further
time has elapsed no statement can
be made regarding the probability of
recovery."
