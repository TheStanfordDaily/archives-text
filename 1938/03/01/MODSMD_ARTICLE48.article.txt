some unknown reason Stan
ford ha:Â» had a hard time getting
baseball players who handle the
ball with consistency in the infield
Against Santa Clara Saturday Spike
Furman pitched good ball for eight
innings, and Glenn Hamilton whiffed
three in the ninth to show he's no
soft touch.
However, if it hadn't been for
(lie good results turned in by
pinch hitters in the Card half of
the eighth, Furman would have
had a defeat turned in against
hint, and all on account >t terrible
hall handling.
The outfield i.s very strong, with
Colli.s, Juney, DeWitt, and Hamilton
available. The first three are strong
hitters, and make few mistakes in
the field.
But that infield has something
missing. Ki liefer in the Bronco
game was fine at first base, and
Pete Mac Arthur, subbing for Cap
tain George Farrell at third, didn't
make any mistakes. Dick Tam at
second, though, ran under an in
field fly and he had no excuses.
There was no wind, he was looking
away from the sun, and he had all
the time in the world.
Not that Tam is always making
mistakes, for Coach Ilarry Wolter
has found him steady enough since*
he came here last year to handle
the starting job at second. If it
isn't he who makes the mistake,
though, it's somebody else on the
team, with the result that the
pitcher usually gets in a spot that,
through no fault of his own, causes
him to lose the hall game.
Dick Shortall, the soph who has
stepped into the top spot at short,
threw away the ball once Saturday
on a toss to Killefer, and it turned
out that the man he let get on base
was the Bronco that scored to put
Santa Clara in a 4-3 lead.
That runner came in when Tam
let that pop fly go over his head, and
if it hadn't been for the eighth in
ning batting rally Santa Clara would
likely have gone home with a one
run victory.
Furman allowed very few
soundly hit halls, and he struck
out an average of one man an in
ning. With steady support all
season he can show the rest of the
C.J.B.A. that he's as good a pitch
er as Priest of California, who
won seven and lost two last year.
Al Lazzaronc, too, with his 10-
inning chore against St. Mary's
last wc. k howed he has plenty of
stuff. Hamilton, with a new lease
on life (his season, is liable to turn
out better than any of them.
Regardless of how good Stanford's
pitching stall' is, though, the Cards
will keep right on losing ball games
unless the fielders can settle down
to methodical handling of the ball.
Potentially the Indian club is a
match for any team in the league,
in spite of St. Mary's "$200,000"
infield and Cal's Chapman, Lom
bard!, Priest, Dcvaurs and com
pany. The pitching staff has more
depth than any outfit in the loop,
which should lie a definite ad
vantage sometime before the sea
son closes.
Incidentally, Alt Allen, former
baseball manager and ardent sup
porter of anything in Stanford
baseball, says this kid Qucntin
Thompson, frosh hurler who struck
out 1!) Saturday, can make the old
ball talk. He says "Cootie" is the
best pitcher the old school has seen
since Dan Johnson left in 1931.
Jo'in.'.on could really throw them in,
they say. Peterson.
