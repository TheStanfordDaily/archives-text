# Alice Marble Loses Game To Bob Low
## Freshman Netter Wins 6-5, 6-2; Kovacs Takes Match From Brock 
### 
Alice Marble, national women's
tennis champion in 1936, lost an ex
: hibition match to Bob Low, fresn
man ace, fi-4, 6-2, on the varsity
courts yesterday afternoon. Frank
Kovacs, youthful Davis Cup hope,
defeated Dave Brock of the Indian
varsity, 6-1, 8-6, and Miss Marble
and Captain Bob Underwood edged
out Eleanor Dawson and Kovacs,
6-4, 7-5, in other exhibitions.
It was obvious in the Marble-Low
match that Miss Marble was not at
her best, and only briefly in the
J opening set did she play the tennis
that made her national champion last
year. Low, on the other hand, after
overcoming nervousness in the first
few games, steadied down to play
with a minimum of errors through
the remainder of the encounter.
Low Rallies
Miss Marble held onto a lead in
the opening set after breaking Low's
service in the second game. Low
evened the count at 4-4, took his
opponent's service, and won out on
| his own. Miss Marble held the ad
vantage in the baseline duels, and it
was not until Low began to rush the
net that he was able to have things
his own way.
The woman player faltered notice
ably in the second chapter, and Low
took the net at every opportunity.
| Miss Marble won her opening serv
: ice, but after that she was out of the
j running.
Revenge For Kovacs
Kovacs gained revenge in turning
j the tables on Brock at 6-1, 8-6, for
1 the Stanford sophomore had beaten
! him decisively in the Card-Berke
ley Tennis Club match last Satur
day. Brock couldn't get his touch in
the first set, with Kovacs slamming
over placements from every angle.
Brock displayed remarkable re-
I trieving in the next set, and if Ko
vac's service had not been quite so
damaging, the Indian player might
! have squared the match.
