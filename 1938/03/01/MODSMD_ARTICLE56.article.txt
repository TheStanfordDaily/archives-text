Scoring their second straight up-
I set, Breakers I loomed as an odds
con choice to retain its all-University
| hoop crown following last night's
J quarter-final round play-off games.
Led by Will Ryan, sharpshooting
center, the Breakers defeated a fa
vored Beta quintet, 32-25. Last
Thursday Breakers scored its first
upset with a victory over S.A.E.
Another surprise was Fiji's 34-24
win over the powerful Delta Upsilon
team. Deane Johnson led a balanced
Fiji offensive with 11 digits, while
John Cowan scored 12 for the los-
I ers.
I Phi Delta Phi continued to look
like the smoothest team in the play
offs with its 35-16 win over Kappa
Sigma. Archie Zamloch and Andy
Spears, with 12 and 10 points, re
spectively, led the winners while
Frank Reimer nabbed 11 of the los
ers 16 counters.
The only game tonight will be in
Encina Gym at 7 o'clock between
A.T.O. and Zete 11. This game,
postponed from last night, pits two
of the best shots in the mural league
against each other in Bob Koch of
A.T.O. and Bob Moulton of Zete. In
a recent game Koch scored a 1938
intramural record with 33 points.
Delta Chi, represented by Mervyn

to the finals of the handball bracket
