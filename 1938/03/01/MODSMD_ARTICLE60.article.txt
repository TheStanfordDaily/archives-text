# Hoop Playoff -- If Any--Set For S. F. Court
## Extra Game Saturday In Civic Auditorium May Be Necessary 
### 
If the knowledge brings any solace
j to the thousands of basketball fans
who haven't been able to see the
1938 Stanford varsity hoop squad in
j action, there might be a Stanford-
California game Saturday night in
the San Francisco Civic Audi
j tori am.
I However, John Q. Public might as
! well take it easy, and not take a
chance on bursting a blood vessel in
an attempt to get a ticket, because
it's a pretty good bet that said game
won't be played.
Tie May Result
If the Bears beat the Laughing
Boys Friday night, the two teams
I will be in a tie for first place. And
that will necessitate a play-off game,
I which has been scheduled as noted
| above. Arrangements for the game
i and ticket sale are to be handled by
| Californiaâ€”that was decided by a
j coin flip.
Don't forget, though, that this
I game depends on His Nibs coming
through with a win Friday night in
the last of the scheduled Big Games.
And that's a terrific long shot, espe
cially after the blasting the Bears
j took in their second tilt with U.S.C.
j last week-end. All tickets for the
I game were sold by 0:15 o'clock yes
terday morning.
Hold Easy Practice
In the meantime, worrying not at
| all about the possibility of a play
; off. Coach John Bunn sent his two
j time Coast champs through a light
I workout following a chalking which
j brought out some slight changes in
offense.
Following practice, the squad
watched a showing of pictures of
the last Stanford-Cal game.
