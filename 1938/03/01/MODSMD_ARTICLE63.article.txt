SPARKLING comment on social life in Bay
area colleges will brighten the dark lives of
students every week, if one of our local stores
decides to adopt a radio advertising project it
is now considering.
The idea is to engage three or four con
noisseurs of inconsequentials on each campus,
transmute their reports into refreshingly witty
patter, and broadcast it between impassioned
bursts of oratory on the superiority of the new
sway-back sport coat over all other models.
The company toying with the idea believes that
students would hang breathless over the radio
until the last bit of gossip was delivered, and
would then stampede to buy coats.
Very probably the students would listen;
and possibly they might buy coats. But if the
firm is trying to build up good will and give
the colleges a boost in passing, it could get the
office boy or the delivery man to draft a better
plan. A gossip broadcast will get an audience.
So will a public hanging or a messy divorce
trial. But none of them build up a particularly
friendly spirit. And none of them do a great
deal of good to the people involved.
Gossip broadcasts are great sport for some
people. It gives you a pleasantly inflated feel
ing to hear that you, popular man-about-Quad,
have been seen dancing at the Mark with a
gorgeous blonde, even though you happen to
know that the blonde is not God's blessing for
anybody. And it's nice to know that brother
Smithers has gone off the deep end about that
siren at the Kappa Kappa Kappa house. He
blushes so tormentedly when you mention it.
But gossip broadcasts inevitably concern the
same limited group of people. Out of 4,000
students the three program snoopers will know
possibly 500 and will know something about
100. Which means that the questionable glory
of having one's name distort the ether waves
will be cornered by a fraction of the student
body. The rest will explore the dial's back
woods for a swing orchestra.
More important than that, a gossip broadcast
will bury the colleges under a reputation they
have spent a generation trying to scrape off.
Magazines and movies to the contrary, the uni
versities today are not overgrown playgrounds.
The majority of the students come to study, and
they visit the Mark only over the dead body of
a term paper.
Spicy comment on the mean wiggle Joe
Hotfoot gets into his Big Apple would give the
impression that colleges are back in the coun
try club era. It would hang the garlands around
the narrow shoulders of the professional prom
trotter, and it would forget the man who has
backbone enough to stick to his work. Who
wants to be told that Bill Smith spent the eve
ning chasing an asset through the balance
sheet thickets?
There are plenty of aspects of college life
that would make good broadcasts. Extra-cur
ricular activities are not without their share of
romance. Student problems of living and work
ing in colleges are not all solved.
It is hard to believe that a good advertiser
couldn't think of something more interesting
than the way a professional play-boy sits on a
bar stool.â€”J. C.
