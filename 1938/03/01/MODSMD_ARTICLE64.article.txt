# Time on Our Hands
## 
### 
IN what was probably one of the most signifi
cant outcomes of the week-end, the masses
at Stanford were given seven seconds of that
"leisure time" that modern sociologists are
wondering what to do with. The seven seconds
was a gift of the Palo Alto Council. And
though compared to a life expectancy of 50
years it isn't much, the paltry amount of time
takes on special significance when it is seven
less seconds of "red" at the El Camino Real
crossing.
By some rather complicated juggling of sec
onds, the Palo Alto Council robbed the north
and south bound traffic of this minute period
and gave it to east-west bound cars. This, it
seems to us, was mighty white of them.
After some jaunts into higher calculus, it
turns out that wo will now wait just 42, instead

' of 49 seconds as formerly. But if those 42 sec
onds are like the old 49 that used to make us
fume, they are the longest that old man Time
has in stock. We hardly think that seven less
j is going to do much to stop the heat from crawl
ing up our collar when we are faced with the
; red light.
But still, the Council expects us to make a
profitable use of their gift. With those added
seconds, we should have more time to spend
in cultural pursuits, or in building up the Bawl
out average. It might come in handy, too, when
you're trying to make a 10:30 sign-out, or when
your shoes need tying. But somehow, we can't
quite figure out just what to do with those
! seconds that will really show the Council that
j we appreciate their magnanimity.
I Of course, we might keep track of each
seven seconds saved while staring the red light
in the face, and then late in life add it all up
and declare a holiday. But this would be a
shade complicated.
The best thing to do would be to forget about
it entirely. But we know that we're going to be
haunted at odd hours by the thought that we are
breaking faith with the good burghers of the
Palo Alto Council.â€”J. S.
