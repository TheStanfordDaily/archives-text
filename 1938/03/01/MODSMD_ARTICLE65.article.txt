# BULL SESSION
## CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME 
### 
I \ESPITE agitation anent campaigns to raise funds
for independent organizations on the campus, one
campaign remains untouched by discussion. It prob
ably will remain untouched by Ex Committee, too, if
that august body ever gets around to doing anything
conclusive about the problem.
It is Stanford's oldest charity, its most worthy, its
most satisfying. It brings us Labor Day, and Bean
Day, and the Strawberry Brunch, and half a dozen
other events which serve to keep things lively during
Spring Quarter.
Some people are bored by it, some people resent
being asked to give money to it, some people don't
care; but to most students, and particularly to those
who work on it, the Convalescent Home Drive is an
experience which contributes a good deal to life 011
the Farm.
Working on it, coming into contact with the people
who mn the Home, coming to an understanding of
the sincere purpose which underlies its operation, one
finds his faith in human nature, shaken as it is by
bouts with newspapers bringing their tales of worry
and woe, somewhat restored.

r |' , HE fact that people arc willing to give their time
and efTort to maintaining the Home is not surpris
ing, but what is surprising is the dramatic aspects of
the work it does: the rebuilding of wasted bodies, the
bringing back to health of children who would never
know health again, were it not for the Home and the
work it does.
"Give a Day of Sunshine" has been no idle slogan
in the past. Perhaps the child your money goes to
comes from poor parents who cannot, afford to give it
adequate care, who cannot provide it with any of the
comforts offered by the Home and so necessary to its
health. In that case—and it is the case, more often
than not —you are making an investment which, if
you ever take time to go out to the Home, will repay
you many times over.
So, when the hullabaloo begins, and you find your
self sweating through Labor Day and pestered by
earnest young maidens asking for shekels, don't ask
why Ex Committee doesn't ban drives. It isn't often
the Farm gets a chance to contribute to one so worth
while, so valuable in its contribution to happiness.
