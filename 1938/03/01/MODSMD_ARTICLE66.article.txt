IF THIS were ancient Grcecc, there would be more
than a word for student, ideas on administrative
ideals. If this were ancient Greece, the student who
finished an education without a knowledge of fine arts
would simply be overlooked. It is fortunate that Stan
ford is not ancient Greece.
From the first, Stanford's educational system has
never been particularly concerned with the arts. It
has always emphasiezd the practical and professional
sides of education, and has left the more purely cul
tural aspects almost completely out of the picture.
However, within the last few years, three divisions
have shown signs of life which point the way to a fu
ture School of Fine Arts. With the completion of Me
morial Hall, the Division of Speech and Drama has
been emancipated from its position as a subsidiary to
the English Department, has become a reality with a
burst of activity which has made it something of an
"enfant terrible" in student dramatics.
The two other art divisions, Graphic Arts and
Music have lagged behind. But a glance at time
schedules of today and of 10 years ago will show a
notable increase in music and art courses: In the case
of the music division, especially, the number of courses
and the students enrolled has outrun the teaching staff.
* * * *
|>ERHAPS the greatest cause of this increased in
terest in music and art has been the enlarged en
rollment of women, The orginal 500 were mostly
women who fitted into the professional curriculum of
Stanford. But as the bars have been lowered, more
have appeared who are interested in acquiring a gen
eral "finish." And from time immemorial, artistic ac
complishment has been one of the requisites for the
feminine sex.
Besides the art and music majors it would attract,
a School of Fine Arts would not lack appeal to the
general student body. The success of such courses as
the "History of Opera," given last quarter, demon
strates the fact that "cultural" courses can draw a
full house from engineering majors as well as musi
cians.
At present, there is enough interest in such courses
to warrant the founding of such a school. And once in,
it would be a definite addition to Stanford's curricula.
Administrative officials might even follow the lead of
ancient Greece and make one course in the school a
requisite for Lower Division students—as a sort of sea
soning to professional specilizntion.
When a finaneal wind-fall turns up, Stanford will
have a chance to add one more swip£ to the polishing
process of education. It would naturally cater mostly
to art and music majors attracted by the school. But
it could also fit the casual needs of the average student
who can't tell Bai'h from Draught Stone.

However, within the last few years, three divisions
have shown signs of life which point the way to a fu
ture School of Fine Arts. With the completion of Me
morial Hall, the Division of Speech and Drama has
been emancipated from its position as a subsidiary to
the English Department, has become a reality with a
burst of activity which has made it something of an
"enfant terrible" in student dramatics.
The two other art divisions, Graphic Arts and
Music have lagged behind. But a glance at time
schedules of today and of 10 years ago will show a
notable increase in music and art courses: In the case
of the music division, especially, the number of courses
and the students enrolled has outrun the teaching staff.

|>ERHAPS the greatest cause of this increased in
terest in music and art has been the enlarged en
rollment of women, The orginal 500 were mostly
women who fitted into the professional curriculum of
Stanford. But as the bars have been lowered, more
have appeared who are interested in acquiring a gen
eral "finish." And from time immemorial, artistic ac
complishment has been one of the requisites for the
feminine sex.
Besides the art and music majors it would attract,
a School of Fine Arts would not lack appeal to the
general student body. The success of such courses as
the "History of Opera," given last quarter, demon
strates the fact that "cultural" courses can draw a
full house from engineering majors as well as musi
cians.
At present, there is enough interest in such courses
to warrant the founding of such a school. And once in,
it would be a definite addition to Stanford's curricula.
Administrative officials might even follow the lead of
ancient Greece and make one course in the school a
requisite for Lower Division students—as a sort of sea
soning to professional specilizntion.
When a finaneal wind-fall turns up, Stanford will
have a chance to add one more swip£ to the polishing
process of education. It would naturally cater mostly
to art and music majors attracted by the school. But
it could also fit the casual needs of the average student
who can't tell Bai'h from Draught Stone.
IF THIS were ancient Grcecc, there would be more
than a word for student, ideas on administrative
ideals. If this were ancient Greece, the student who
finished an education without a knowledge of fine arts
would simply be overlooked. It is fortunate that Stan
ford is not ancient Greece.
From the first, Stanford's educational system has
never been particularly concerned with the arts. It
has always emphasiezd the practical and professional
sides of education, and has left the more purely cul
tural aspects almost completely out of the picture.
