### 
"A Yank at Oxford," starring Rob
ert Taylor at the Stanford today,
solves the problems of a swell-head-

Ed American ath
lete who, given a
scholarship at Ox
ford, makes good
there. The prob
lems of finding the
girl he loves,
Maureen O'Sulli
van, and proving
himself a gentle
man .sends Tay
lor, his small-

I own editor father, Lionel Barry
more, and Miss O'Sullivan through
sizable array of adventures, topped
by the athletic supremacy of the
Yankee hero.
High point in the evening's enter
tainment for Stanford students will
be the appearance of Doodles Wea
ver, excitedly shouting the news of
Taylor's victory over a telephone at
the tx*ack.
Smile Charms
Capitalizing on his own charming
smile, Taylor may be able to win
the hearts of a few of Roblc's Wayne
Morris fans. On the whole, he really
does very well, convincingly riding
up the wrong side of the street and
bumping into the dean of his college,
running (and winning) a race
dressed in cap and gown, kissing
Miss O'Sullivan in the middle of the
street, kicking his dean in the seat
of the pants, and generally finding
plenty of trouble for himself.
"Scatters" Scattergood, the "scoul"
in Taylor's dorm, a very kindly old
man, is persuasive enough to keep
the "Yank" in Oxiord when the go
ing is toughest, lifcht at first.
Good Second Feature
When the college widow, bending
over her bicycle with Taylor, says
he's pulling her leg. he replies thai
lie's having difficulty restraining
himself. This same girl provides the
greater part of the trouble by which
Taylor is nearly thrown out of
school, "sent down" as they say over
there. But he stays in, just in time
to row his crew to victory over
Cambridge.
"Patient in Room 18" provides two
real murders, and almost another,
except that the third victim doesn't
die. What with $100,000 worth of
radium, a rich uncle, doctors and
beautiful nurses, it is a truly pass
able second feature. —Alward.

van, and proving
himself a gentle
man .sends Tay
lor, his small-

I own editor father, Lionel Barry
more, and Miss O'Sullivan through
sizable array of adventures, topped
by the athletic supremacy of the
Yankee hero.
High point in the evening's enter
tainment for Stanford students will
be the appearance of Doodles Wea
ver, excitedly shouting the news of
Taylor's victory over a telephone at
the tx*ack.
Smile Charms
Capitalizing on his own charming
smile, Taylor may be able to win
the hearts of a few of Roblc's Wayne
Morris fans. On the whole, he really
does very well, convincingly riding
up the wrong side of the street and
bumping into the dean of his college,
running (and winning) a race
dressed in cap and gown, kissing
Miss O'Sullivan in the middle of the
street, kicking his dean in the seat
of the pants, and generally finding
plenty of trouble for himself.
"Scatters" Scattergood, the "scoul"
in Taylor's dorm, a very kindly old
man, is persuasive enough to keep
the "Yank" in Oxiord when the go
ing is toughest, lifcht at first.
Good Second Feature
When the college widow, bending
over her bicycle with Taylor, says
he's pulling her leg. he replies thai
lie's having difficulty restraining
himself. This same girl provides the
greater part of the trouble by which
Taylor is nearly thrown out of
school, "sent down" as they say over
there. But he stays in, just in time
to row his crew to victory over
Cambridge.
"Patient in Room 18" provides two
real murders, and almost another,
except that the third victim doesn't
die. What with $100,000 worth of
radium, a rich uncle, doctors and
beautiful nurses, it is a truly pass
able second feature. —Alward.
