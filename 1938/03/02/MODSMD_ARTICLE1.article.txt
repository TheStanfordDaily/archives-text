### BILL MILLIS 
ABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO, along
with "Lawrence of Arabia," one
of the few romantic figures who be
came famous during the exceeding
ly unromantic World War, died last
night of a brain hemorrhage in the
fantastic "death room" of his villa
in the foothills of the Italian Alps.
After living what he called "the
life of a superman," D'Annunzio
had said a year ago that he was
determined to dissolve his body
in a powerful chemical bath when
he felt death approaching. Hut
death came too quickly for him
to carry out his exotic plans.
D'Annunzio, who lost an eye as an
aviator in the war, was notorious
for his seizure of the former Austrian
Adriatic seaport of Fiume in "Italia
Irredenta," which he held from Sep
tember, 1919 to the end of 1920 in de
fiance of the Italian government and
the other Allied powers. Fiume was
finally annexed to Italy in 1924.

Austria's unrest seems to have
quieted somewhat, although 20,000
Nazi storm troopers demonstrating
in Graz yesterday, shouted "one
folk, one Reich" in open defiance of
the 6000 army troops enforcing what
amounted to martial law. Peasant
Nazi groups from Styria province
were reported converging on the
city, which Minister Arthur Von
Seyss-Inquart is attempting to
"pacify."
In Vienna Chancellor Kurt
Schuschnigg formed an anti-Nazi
pact with two of his former politi
cal enemies, Prince Ernst Van
Stahrcmberg's Heimwchr and the
Freedom League.
American, British and French
naval experts have started discus
sions in London on plans to build
40,000-ton battleships, and British
Prime Minister will present a white
paper on the government's defense
program to Parliament today.
* * *
has been a pop
ular American political slogan
for 50 years, and indications now are
that President Roosevelt will pre
sent a message attacking "monopo
lies" to Congress within the next 10
days.
After conferences yesterday
with Attorney General Homer S.
Cunimings, Assistant Attorney
General Robert H. Jackson, and
S.E.C. Chairman William Doug
las, the President warned report
ers against any forecasting on the
nature of his speech.
The Administration's new revenue
bill, which modifies the undistribu
ted profits levy, was favorably re
ported yesterday by the House
Ways and Means Committee, which
split 17 to 7 along party lines.

Summary: Physicians of General
John J. Pershing announced in Tuc
son, Ariz., that prospects for his re
covery have improved. — Heavy
storms have flooded lowlying areas
in Venice and Inglewoor, and a new
storm will drench most of the state
today.—New York agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation are
temporarily refraining from inter
fering in the kidnaping of 15-year
old Peter Levine, whose New Ro
chelle father is endeavoring to ne
gotiate the $60,000 ransom demands.
—Japanese troops have routed 200,-
000 Chinese soldiers in southern
Shansi province in their drive to
Hankow, and have forced the mass
flight of 500,000 refugees through the
mountains to Shensi.—WPA is go
ing to add 500,000 unemployed to its
relief rolls.
ABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO, along
with "Lawrence of Arabia," one
of the few romantic figures who be
came famous during the exceeding
ly unromantic World War, died last
night of a brain hemorrhage in the
fantastic "death room" of his villa
in the foothills of the Italian Alps.
After living what he called "the
life of a superman," D'Annunzio
had said a year ago that he was
determined to dissolve his body
in a powerful chemical bath when
he felt death approaching. Hut
death came too quickly for him
to carry out his exotic plans.
D'Annunzio, who lost an eye as an
aviator in the war, was notorious
for his seizure of the former Austrian
Adriatic seaport of Fiume in "Italia
Irredenta," which he held from Sep
tember, 1919 to the end of 1920 in de
fiance of the Italian government and
the other Allied powers. Fiume was
finally annexed to Italy in 1924.
