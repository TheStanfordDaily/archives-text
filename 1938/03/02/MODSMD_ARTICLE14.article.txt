# 700 Attend Co-eds' Show Of Fashions
## Exhibit Climaxed By Bridal Scene; Plans Discussed For 1939 
### 
Before an audience of over 700,
Stanford co-eds presented their
[ spring scholarship fund fashion show
| yesterday afternoon in the Memorial
I theater.
The surprise of the show came
â– during the bridal scene, which cli
maxed the fashion display with the
latest thing in grooms and ushers.
Bob Mangan, the groom, was lent
moral support by his best man,
j Howell Turner, and groomsmen
j Ralph Kingsbury, Barney Smith,
j Bob Forward, and Ty Tyson set oft'
the pink and white of the feminine
I contingent to advantage.
Wilma Richardson, announcer and
'chairman of the presentation an
! nounced yesterday that financial re
i turns bespoke the show a success,
| and the money will be used to pro
; vide a women's scholarship.
Against, the stage background of
a straight black drop, and in step
with the rhythm of Freddie Nagel's
orchestra, the co-ed models walked
from the side aprons of the theater,
across the stage, and down into the
audience aisles.
The style presentation was grouped
in three parts, with five-minute in
tervals between. Sports clothes were
shown first, with afternoon and eve
ning clothes taking the second and
third parts. The briday procession
remained on stage for the finale.
Shirley Jones, campus entertainer,
sang with Nagel's orchestra during
the intermissions.
Clothes modeled were provided by
Ransohoff's, City of Paris, Liebes,
Livingston's, Carolyn Kelsey's,
Clothes Closet, and Roos Bros. The
[ flowers for the bridal scene were by
Sheridan and Bell.
The success of the show will un
doubtedly insure another style pres
entation next year, according to the
committee chairmen.
