# Excom Approves Cardinal Aides
## Activity Organization Undergoes Discussion Of Setup, Appointees 
### 
Ex Committee last night unanimously approved Cardinals' appoint
ments of Convalescent Home Drive committee chairmen—but not before
it had spent (>."> minutes prying the lid off the activity organization, ques
tioning at times its right to exist.
llie appointments have been subject to controversy since their an
nouncement I'eb. 1(», subject to Ex Committee's approval. Nine of the

twelve appointees are members of
Cardinals.
Definite action regarding the pres
ent Cardinals setup was put of!
until next week, when Ex Commit
tee will hear the report of a commit
tee including Chuck Fontius, Presi
dent Tom Killefer, Mark Hopkins,
Chick Franich, Drive Chairman Bud
Milligan, and Jack Calderwood.
Fontius Objects
Discussion of the group started
when Fontius said, "I don't like
'em."
He and Bob Garretson led the at
tack.
"I won't call it political appoint
ments," said Fontius, "but it does
look sometimes as if Cardinals ladle:;
out jobs to make people feel good."
Cardinals Chairman Hopkins dis
agreed. "I really don't believe
there's any patronage in any ap
pointment Cardinals have ever
made," he said.
Critics Classed
Franich, chairman of Cardinals
last year, said members of the or
ganization were not "glory-grab
bers." He classed critics as (1) cru
saders who think the elective sys
tem and democracy better than the
appointive system, and (2) those
who "don't want jobs but just like
to scream."
"Nobody that has ever wanted a
committee position around here ha.i
ever been excluded," he said.
Much of the discussion centered
around John Dern's proposal that a
file be kept in the A.S.S.U. office,
showng ability of students who have
worked on committees.
Winklemann Speaks
"What category would you look
under when you want someone to
take care of 300 Stephens College
women who are coming?" asked
Hopkins.
"Look under 'gigolos'," suggested
Roy Winklemann.
As the discussion closed, Killefer
told Franich, "I'm glad you came up.
All of us like to find out what's
gone on in the past."
The question of Campus fund
drives was settled. According to the
motion adopted, the student man
ager will approve or reject appli
cations, referring those he considers
controversial to a standing commit
tee composed of one man, one
woman, the editor of The Daily, the
student manager, and the Dean of
Men.
The committee is to investigate
and make recommendations to Ex
Committee.
Three Appointed
A.s male members of the planning
committee for this spring's Leader
ship Institute. Killefer named Lyle
Cook, Jim Stone, and Wayland
Leonard.
The committee approved expen
diture for cider served last night in
the Green Room of Memorial Hall,
when students talked with William
Rose Benet after the Tuesday Eve
ning Lecture.
Keys Lost
Because he doesn't want to have
all the locks changed, Fontius asked
that members look sharp for the
keys to the Ex Committee room, his
own office, and Killefer's office. The
keys were missing yesterday from
the A.S.S.U. office.
Discussion of a proposed ruling
allowing initiative action by the
student body was held over until
next week.
