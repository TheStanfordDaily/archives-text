# Pershing Gains In Life Battle
## Doctors Optimistic With New Condition 
### 
TUCSON, Ariz., March 1 (UP).—
The stout heart that carried General
John J. Pershing through two major
wars and countless skirmishes held
the answer tonight to whether the
general of the armies of the United
States ever will rise from his sick
bed.
Physicians were inclined to be
optimistic, citing the fact that Per
shing had marched out of his periods
of coma and was gaining strength by
undisturbed sleep. Before many
more hours, events probably will
take a definite turn toward either
recovery or death in the little cot
tage in the middle of a desert where
a soldier is waging his hardest fight.
Pershing has made a remarkable
l'eturn from the edge of death in the
last 48 hours, but doctors still kept
in mind the possibility that things
can happen suddenly to a man of 77
years.
"The general has slept most of the
morning but remains fully con
scious," Dr. Roland Davison said in
a mid-day bulletin. "The kidney
function in the last 24 hours has
been sufficiently adequate to remove
some of the poisonous substances
which have accumulated in the
blood during the period when elimi
nation by the kidneys had stopped.
Much of the sand used in manu
facturing glass in America is im
ported from Belgium.
