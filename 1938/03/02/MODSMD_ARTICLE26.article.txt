# Better Tune Needed Here, Says Songman

### 
Back in New York there's a man j
who thinks Stanford should have a
better official song.
He says that "Come Join the
Band" is "none other than an old
| band march, to which Stanford has
1 added words."
His name is Thornton W. Allen,
publisher of college songs and song
| books, and he is working on a song
for the Farm. He started it several
j years ago but delayed completing
it until recently, hoping to get a
j student or alumnus to cooperate
i with him.
"Stanford should have a rousing
i football song," says Mr. Allen, "that
will be truly her own and identified
always with the University.
"Moreover, we would like to pub
lish this song as a college number
j and endeavor to popularize it from
coast to coast as such. With the sup
port of the University, students, and
alumni, I am sure we could soon
make this song nationally popular—
: that is, if Stanford really wants a
j new song."
Working with Harlow Rothert,
alumni secretary, Mr. Allen has been
responsible for many of the radio
jand motion picture appearances of
j Farm songs. Among colleges for
which he controls copyrights are
i Cal, Stanford, U.S.C., Oregon State,
St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and Wash
| ington State.
Among the songs he has written
are "On.Wisconsin" and "Washing
! ton and Lee Swing."
Albert Spalding, American vio
linist, made his debut in 1905 in
