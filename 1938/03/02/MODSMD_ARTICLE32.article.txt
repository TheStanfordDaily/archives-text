Final Moot Court of the year will

ing undesirable persons from the
State of Calizona.
Moot Courts are prepared during

tier, and John McFarland, the coun
sels in the case tomorrow, are the
winners of the trials. They will be
competing for the prize of $50 which
is offered by the Law Association.
The case will be judged by Alden
. Ames of San Francisco, H. J. Jor-
I gensen of Salinas, and William F.
i James of San Jose. Two decisions
; will be handed down. The first is
based on the condition of the brief
■ and the manner of presentation of
; the case, for which the prize will be
1 given. The second will be their
! opinion as to the law in the case.
These judges have been instructed
to ask questions throughout the trial
in order to make the case more in
■ teresting for the audience.
In this case, Montgomery, a va
| grant entering without permission.
' was found to have tuberculosis and
■ was to be deported. He appeals his
case to the "Supreme Court," saying
I the law violates the Fourteenth
Amendment. Calizona contends that
she is exercising, her police power
