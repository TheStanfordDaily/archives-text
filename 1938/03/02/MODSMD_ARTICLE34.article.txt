IN AN effort to spur the La Mirada
Limited, otherwise known as Ray
Malott, into a victory at the A.A.U.
indoor championships in New York
last Saturday, Breakers Club sent
him a telegram. The wire said
something inconsequential, but it
was designed to get the captain of
the track team all inspired for the
home folks.
Nicely timed, the epistle got to
Kay just five minutes before the
start of his race, the'(>oo meters.
It certainly didn't do any harm,
because flay ran fourth, four or
five yards hack, as Jimmy Herbert
of New York U. set a new world's
record for the distance.
Incidentally, the Limited admits
lie faded about 600 yards out, the
last GO yards being a little too much
for him. Considering all the cir
cumstances, the fourth place in that
race, fade or no fade, is o.k.

California's track team went
through its first time trials of the
spring Saturday, and came up with
a few indications of where the
strength lies. Captain George An
derson, who is still on the comeback
trail, hustled along with the rest of
the boys and ran second in both
sprints. »
Jerry Trumbly, who was un
placed in the Big Meet last year,
took the 100 and 220 in :10.1 and
:22.(>, respectively. Anderson was
allegedly running fairly easy, and
could have put on more stuff. If
he's in shape this year it will he
a grand thing, for he was given
up for good two years ago and has
made valiant efforts to get hack
(o the form he had as a soph.
Trumbly's marks are no better
than Stanford has to offer, with
Stan Hiserman. What will happen
to the sprints between now and Big
Meet time is slightly in doubt, the
experts say.
Another Bear trying a comeback
is Jim Kitts, shot putter who set a
Little Big Meet record of 48'7 r, s"
couple of years ago and then did
not compete last year because of
arthritis in his wrist. He took
second in the Cal trials at 46'1"
behind Herb Michaels, soph who
won the Little I»ig Meet event last
year. While 461" isn't very good,
the fact that he is able to put the
shot again is significant. There's
no doubt that he can put it far
enough when he gets in shape, if
that wrist doesn't stop him.
Cecil Cole, ineligible transfer, won
the mile in 4:26, and Greg Stout, an
alumnus now, won the low hurdles
in :24.6. Ed Burrows ran a 4:23 mile
in praceice last week, so that on
paper makes him at least three sec
onds better than the best Cal man.

The International Amateur Ath
letic Federation finally got around
to holding its periodical meeting in
Paris last week, and in the course of
its deliberations came to the con
clusion that Ihe Stanford 880 relay
team of Kneubuhl, Malott, Hiserman
and Weiershauser really did set a
new world's record of 1:25 at the
Fresno Relays last year.
That makes everything official.
Also made official was Spec Towns'
:13.7 for 110-meter hurdles, set in
Oslo last year, a record at which
even Towns looked askance. The
Federation decided it was 0.k., so
it's o.k.—Peterson.
