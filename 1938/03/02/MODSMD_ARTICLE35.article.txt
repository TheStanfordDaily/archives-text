# Frosli Nine Tilt Cancelled By Rain
## 
### 
The weatherman frowned again
yesterday, and the Farm yearling
nine was forced to call ofT another
scheduled diamond encounter, this
time their tilt with Jefferson High.
The cancellation was the sixth to
be made so far this season, the first
five games also going by the boards
because of the rain. In the three
encounters the nine has played to
date, they have won two and dropped
one.
Tomorrow, unless the downpour
continues, the Encina team will see
action against the powerful San Jose
High sluggers. Starting pitcher for
the frosh will probably be Monte
Pfyl, with cither Herb Atkinson or
Pete Fay as the other member of the
starting battery.
