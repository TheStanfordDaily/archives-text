# Indian Nine Will Battle Gaels Today
## Varsity May Unseat Conference Leaders On Moraga Diamond 
### 
Weather permitting, Stanford's
second-place baseball team will hike
over to Moraga this afternoon at
2:30 o'clock to try and lift St. Mary's
league-leading Gaels from their
perch at the top of the C.1.8.A.
standings.
The Moragamen, after winning one
game from every team in the north
ern division of the conference, are
at present heading the pack by two
and one-half games and have set
themselves up as the team to beat.
In second place is Stanford with a
.500 average by virtue of one victory
and a single defeat, followed by Cali
fornia and Santa Clara with no
games chalked up in the win col
umn.
Finished Fourth
St. Mary's, potentially one of the
best teams in the league last year,
was the victim of tough breaks all
year long and finished no better than
fourth. With the same material on
hand this year, the Gaels have
formed a hard-hitting and smooth
fielding team that won its Winter
League championship with seven
straight victories and has started the
same way in the C.1.8.A. In the vet
eran Cy Greenlaw and sophomore
Emmet O'Neill they have two pitch
ers that can be counted on for con
sistent victories.
Stanford, with one of the best
mound staffs in the conference, has
failed to click in its fielding or bat
ting as yet. If the pitching per
formances of Spike Furman, A1
Lazzarone, and Glenn Hamilton
were backed up by support in the
field or at the plate, the Indians
would be definite contenders.
Ends Quarter
Today's game will be Stanford's
last conference tilt of the Winter
Quarter. Saturday the Indians wind
up their entire winter schedule with
a practice game against the Gaddini
All-Stars before going south for
conference games with U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. and practice tilts with the
San Diego Marines during spring
vacation.
