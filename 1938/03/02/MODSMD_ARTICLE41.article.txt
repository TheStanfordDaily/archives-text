# B.A.C. To Sell Playoff Tickets-If Cal Wins
## 
### 
There might be a rooters' ticket
sale at the B.A.C. Saturday morn
ing.
It all depends on whether or not-
California's unpredictable Up-and-
Downers can win Friday night's
basketball game, the last of 1938's
Big Games.
There's no telling what His Nibs'
boys will do, but the odds are all
against their coming through with
a win against the Laughing Boys.
Said win will tie up first spot in
southern division, and necessitate
a playoff game.
Tickets May Be Sold
Now, if the Bears should win, the
B.A.C. will be selling rooters' tic
kets, 40 cents each, and a few gen
eral admissions, $1.10 per, on Sat
urday morning from 8:30 o'clock to
12 noon.
The playoff game—this is pure
California wishful thinking — is
scheduled for San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium. Probable starting time
is 8 o'clock, if it starts at all.
In the meantime, the Indians are
taking it easy, practicing mostly on
offensive maneuvers.
Cal Hopeful
Rumor has it that the Bears, also,
are taking it easy, trying their best
to recover from last week-end's
massacre.

Before the week gets around to
! Friday night, though, they'll be dig
ging in hard, because the only way
they can come through with i.
championship is by upsetting Stan
ford's Coast Champs, thus meriting
a playoff game.
Hoop fans shouldn't worry,
though. It's all in the Cards for a
third consecutive Coast Champion
ship Crown for Stanford.
