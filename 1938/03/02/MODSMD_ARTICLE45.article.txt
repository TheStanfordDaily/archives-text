# Ex Committee Was Surprised
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE put on its managerial gym
clothes last night and started a brisk workout
with what it thought was going to be a soft
punching bag. Pegging its discussion on the
Cardinals' Convalescent Home Drive appoint
ments, it guestioned the efficiency of the present
appointing system. Later on, when the dust had
become thick, Ex Committee was surprised to
find itself discussing democracy, ethics, and
popular sovereignty.
But knowing the nature of Cardinals and the
purpose for which it was formed, Ex Committee
appears somewhat naive in its surprise. It
should have known that the Cardinals question
is a punching bag stuffed with bricks.
Cardinals was organized four years ago be
cause the system of direct appointment to
campus administrative offices by Ex Committee
was considered unsuccessful. Backers of the
movement declared that a self - perpetuating
body could make appointments fairly and judi
ciously, uninfluenced by log-rolling lumber
jacks of Hall and Row. The opposition objected
at the time that the new body was simply a
mechanism for routing the gravy traffic through
new channels.
It is hard to tell at this time whether Cardinals
actually was founded to perform the noble
function it professed. But one thing is obvious.
Cardinals was formed and continues to exist
only because the student body at Stanford is
too disinterested in student government to make
a working machine out of pure democracy. If
Cardinals was formed to correct abuses in ap
pointments, it was because the democratic ap
pointing system had failed. If it was formed
for less admirable reasons, it was because the
electorate was too apathetic or too gullible to
stop the project.
Cardinals, then, is rooted in failure of de
mocracy. It is admittedly a compromise mecha
nism designed to hold democracy'* hand at
times when the going gets too rough for her.
It is not admittedly anything more than that;
but if it is, the fault lies with our democratic
system of government fo rpermitting it to exist.
The students are not interested. It does not
bother them that Cardinals is an oligarchic spot
on the democratic robe we display so proudly.
They are much more interested in meeting that
blonde who sits across the aisle in history lec
ture.
Cardinals is designed to be undemocratic. It
was created because the founders thought the
democratic system of appointment had failed.
And the price paid for the undemocratic ap
pointments is: limited field of choice, concentra
tion of prestige, exclusion of men who have no
contact with the appointing group.
Ex Committee should not have been surprised
to find this out. It might have deduced it from
five minutes' consideration of Cardinals' avowe
avowed function.
The problem involves a great deal more than
appointments. It drags in the whole question of
student government and the apathy of the elec
torate. Ex Committee charging the question of
appointment was very much like an innocent
puppy who nips at a horseshoe and is surprised
to find a horse tacked to it.â€”J. C.
