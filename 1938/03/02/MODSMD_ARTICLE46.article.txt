FOR pure idealism it would be hard to find
the equal of the nominating system dis
cussed Monday by Women's Conference. That
it also may have glaring practical defects pos
sibly is beside the point.
Conference proposes to outlaw caucuses as
devices to nominate women for all elective posi
tions. In their place would be set up a nomi
nating committee of seven seniors. Last year
caucuses were allowed, although 15 women
office holders under Conference auspices
picked a slate for the election.
Row women first showed their idealism in
proposing the substitute. Under it committee
membership would be by living groups; last
year the sororities held far more posts than their
population would give them. Through Pan-
Hellenic, they agreed to relinquish this superi
ority.

Conference, not to be outdone, toyed with the
idea and will pass or reject it next week. As
Conference seems to think, the system could
produce a much higher type of office holder,
and cleaner campaigns, than there have been
in the past. The candidates would be picked
after calm consideration by a group of senior
women with nothing to seek for themselves,
rather than by caucuses with their inevitable
log-rolling.
In Utopia it would work that way, and it
might at Stanford. But at Stanford, or anywhere
else in this evil world, the plan is poor, both
in its political theory and as practical politics.
If the offices have any attraction at all, the
committee of seven is going to be subjected to
terrific pressure from the hopefuls. And accu
sations of partisanship from those eliminated
may be even more terrific after the committee
has done its choosing.
Then too, though the committee may work
with the greatest possible fairness, possibly it
will have a little difficulty in picking the best
of the 1100. For instance seniors, even seven
of them, may not know among themselves the
finest timber in the sophomore class.
That the nominating is done only by seven
people and so may heighten the impression
that women's politics is ruled by a select few
is something that only the women have to
worry about.
Caucuses and Row-Hall rivalry may be the
beastly things they are painted. But they seem
to be necessary to collegiate practice of de
mocracy. And at least in college where we
aren't playing for keeps, it seems we could
keep our experiments within democratic lines.

keep our experiments within democratic lines.
FOR pure idealism it would be hard to find
the equal of the nominating system dis
cussed Monday by Women's Conference. That
it also may have glaring practical defects pos
sibly is beside the point.
Conference proposes to outlaw caucuses as
devices to nominate women for all elective posi
tions. In their place would be set up a nomi
nating committee of seven seniors. Last year
caucuses were allowed, although 15 women
office holders under Conference auspices
picked a slate for the election.
Row women first showed their idealism in
proposing the substitute. Under it committee
membership would be by living groups; last
year the sororities held far more posts than their
population would give them. Through Pan-
Hellenic, they agreed to relinquish this superi
ority.

Conference, not to be outdone, toyed with the
idea and will pass or reject it next week. As
Conference seems to think, the system could
produce a much higher type of office holder,
and cleaner campaigns, than there have been
in the past. The candidates would be picked
after calm consideration by a group of senior
women with nothing to seek for themselves,
rather than by caucuses with their inevitable
log-rolling.
In Utopia it would work that way, and it
might at Stanford. But at Stanford, or anywhere
else in this evil world, the plan is poor, both
in its political theory and as practical politics.
If the offices have any attraction at all, the
committee of seven is going to be subjected to
terrific pressure from the hopefuls. And accu
sations of partisanship from those eliminated
may be even more terrific after the committee
has done its choosing.
Then too, though the committee may work
with the greatest possible fairness, possibly it
will have a little difficulty in picking the best
of the 1100. For instance seniors, even seven
of them, may not know among themselves the
finest timber in the sophomore class.
That the nominating is done only by seven
people and so may heighten the impression
that women's politics is ruled by a select few
is something that only the women have to
worry about.
Caucuses and Row-Hall rivalry may be the
beastly things they are painted. But they seem
to be necessary to collegiate practice of de
mocracy. And at least in college where we
aren't playing for keeps, it seems we could
keep our experiments within democratic lines.
