DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM
T AST week the Government of the United States, in
a coldly worded reply to representations from the
Japanese Government, refused to discuss the possi
bility of naval limitation.
Several days later Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Charles Edison refused to disclose the results of
battleship tests which reputedly show that they are
incapable of withstanding air attack.
Yesterday in London the naval officials of France,
Britain, and the United States gathered to discuss the
advisability of building over-size vessels.
In Washington four weeks of testimony before the
House Naval Affairs Committee came to an end with
the remark by witness Glenn L. Martin, an airplane
manufacturer, that the United States should build "the
greatest air fleet in the world," and "a navy second to
none."
* * * *
in all this the earnest advocate of
human rationality ought to be able to find a thread
of reason. There ought to be some justification for
America's action in suddenly throwing overboard a
policy she has followed ever since the War. Some
body ought to know why we are plunging the world
into the greatest naval race in history.
But perhaps one assumes too much. Perhaps some
body does. Perhaps behind the grim facades of the
War and Navy Buildings in Washington a lot of
people know. Perhaps in other seats of power a per
verted logic has been used to l'ationalize the sudden
swing away from peace toward war.
But certainly the people don't know. They don't
even know what they're getting for their money, be
cause the Assistant Secretary of the Navy won't tell
them. Neither will any of the admirals, keeping mum
in what is perhaps the most traitorous and dangerous
hush-hush government officials have so under
taken. <
Mr. Martin has a reason, clear enough. He sells
airplanes, so we know why he wants us to have the
biggest air-fleet in the world.
But we don't know why the government wants us
to. Fear of Japan may be the reason; certainly we
have had provocation enough in that regard. Fear of
Fascism extending to South America undoubtedly
looms large in the demand for a navy big enough to
guard both coasts.
But we don't know. And in a democracy we should
know. But we don't know.
That will be a really justifiable annoyance, about
the time we find ourselves entering another war to
save something.—Allen Drury.

DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM
T AST week the Government of the United States, in
a coldly worded reply to representations from the
Japanese Government, refused to discuss the possi
bility of naval limitation.
Several days later Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Charles Edison refused to disclose the results of
battleship tests which reputedly show that they are
incapable of withstanding air attack.
Yesterday in London the naval officials of France,
Britain, and the United States gathered to discuss the
advisability of building over-size vessels.
In Washington four weeks of testimony before the
House Naval Affairs Committee came to an end with
the remark by witness Glenn L. Martin, an airplane
manufacturer, that the United States should build "the
greatest air fleet in the world," and "a navy second to
none."
* * * *
in all this the earnest advocate of
human rationality ought to be able to find a thread
of reason. There ought to be some justification for
America's action in suddenly throwing overboard a
policy she has followed ever since the War. Some
body ought to know why we are plunging the world
into the greatest naval race in history.
But perhaps one assumes too much. Perhaps some
body does. Perhaps behind the grim facades of the
War and Navy Buildings in Washington a lot of
people know. Perhaps in other seats of power a per
verted logic has been used to l'ationalize the sudden
swing away from peace toward war.
But certainly the people don't know. They don't
even know what they're getting for their money, be
cause the Assistant Secretary of the Navy won't tell
them. Neither will any of the admirals, keeping mum
in what is perhaps the most traitorous and dangerous
hush-hush government officials have so under
taken. <
Mr. Martin has a reason, clear enough. He sells
airplanes, so we know why he wants us to have the
biggest air-fleet in the world.
But we don't know why the government wants us
to. Fear of Japan may be the reason; certainly we
have had provocation enough in that regard. Fear of
Fascism extending to South America undoubtedly
looms large in the demand for a navy big enough to
guard both coasts.
But we don't know. And in a democracy we should
know. But we don't know.
That will be a really justifiable annoyance, about
the time we find ourselves entering another war to
save something.—Allen Drury.
