ITSUALLY wc stay away from record programs like
the plague, unless there is simply nothing else on.
Bui* there are a couple of them worth listening to. One
is KGO's 45-minute program of classical music which
comes at 10 o'clock each night, and it's just about the
nearest to the real thing that comes.
The program has a nice variety from night to night,
and has the addition of program comments which are
unobtrusive but helpful. For instance, Monday night
was played "Scheherazade Suite." Last night was a
venture in the modern field with Grofe's "Grand Can
yon Suite"—which is so popular with the classical
"iekies"—and some songs by Paul Robeson. Tonight,
if we remember correctly, you can hear Rimsky-Kor
sakofl's "Caprice Espanol," and part of the Bruckner's
"Seventh Symphony." One of the little musical tid
bits which is added from time to time to fill out min
utes left after large works, are Chopin's "Preludes.''
played by Alfred Cortot. one of the masters of Chopin
interpretation.
The other record program we like somes on KJBS
from 10 to 11:30 o'clock every "night. This program, too,
features the world's finest music. Every Wednesday
night a specialty—a complete opera—is presented; and
on Saturday night, music of a lighter nature. With an
hour and a half each night, a lot of territory can be
covered, as you may imagine. In fact, by listening to
either of the programs, you can get a nice picture of
better music. And all for nothing—no tickets, no trips
to the city, no fancy dressing up. Pretty soft, we call
it. Whirl the dial to one of the programs one of these
nights while you're studying. It's worth it.

It's here! Or at least within striking distance. Of
course we refer to Disney's "Snow White," which
opens today at the Golden Gate in S. F. You miss it
on pain of social ostracism Stone.
