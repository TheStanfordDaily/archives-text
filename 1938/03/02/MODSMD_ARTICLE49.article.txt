# Mendelowitz Water-colors On Exhibition
## 
### 
On display at the Art Gallery is
a collection of Mexican water colors
by Daniel M. Mendelowitz of the

Stanford Art de
partment.
Mr. Mendelo
witz lias taken
scenes f rom the
Santa Clara Val
ley, New Mexico,
and Old Mexico,
where he traveled
during his sum
mer vacation.
One scene most

typical of the Mexican people is the
"Police Force in the Plaza" in Tax
co. The policemen, without uni
forms, are seated on the benches* in
the plaza doing nothing but enjoy
ing the coolness of the afternoon.
They wear uniforms only for spe
cial occasions.
The scene "Banana Trees," also
taken from Mexican scenery, is a
study iii shadings of green and yel
low in the banana leaves. In con
trast is the picture of "Red Canyon,"
Utah, in which Mr. Mendelowitz has
caught the unique redness of the
canyon rocks.
There are two fine scenes taken
from the market in Mexico City
which are very well done. Another
excellent water color is the one
called "Eucalyptus Branches." The
detail of the leaves and branches is
very fine.
This collection is one which is
well worth seeing.â€”Marquand.
Iligh-grade cement is screened
through a mesh so fine it will hold
water.
