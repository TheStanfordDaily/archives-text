# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE ON MARGARET 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
These remarks are motivated by
the letter written by one "Mar
garet," if there be such, in Friday's
Daily. I heartily concur with her
opinion of the Junior Prom, There
was a prize collection of pseudo
smoothies and feeble-femmes, wrig
gling to the sprains of a far from
first-class band.
But I do wish to correct her on
the matter of the Stanford Rough.
They are a lost race; they disap
peared shortly after the scholastic
requirements were lowered, at the
time the "500" became history. They
were real men, for whom this Uni
versity was founded.
The Founders' Grant provides that
the purpose of this University was
to be a technical school for men
who could not afford an education
elsewhere. The men who entered
within the spirit of the grant gave
Stanford the spirit and educational
reputatoin it is now rapidly losing.
Stanford has become a matrimo
nial bureau for under-nourished,
over-sexed females and a play
ground for pusillanimous Hollywood
boys.
About half of the glorified boy
scouts now registered who call them
selves Stanford Men could not even
have sent in an application blank
six or seven years ago.
Speaking of the clothes worn by
some students here, I have never
recognized any correlation between
general ability and an Esquire ward
robe, but I do know there is a very
definite positive correlation between

clothes and the size of one's
monetary obligations.
As to the Harvard inclinations of
dear Margaret, personal observation
tells me Harvard's principal effect
is to broaden one's A and soften
one's S. The clothes they wear
would make the Beau Brummels of
Stockton's Filipino quarter turn
green with envy.
