## Dinner, Skating Party Are Also Considered By Senior Committee 
### 
Senior Executive Committee yes
terday afternoon narrowed down a
large number of suggestions for a
special senior function to three
probable plans.
Ideas under consideration include
a barbecue, a skating party, or a
senior dinner.
Suggestions discarded by the
committee included a Kid Day, a
Beard Growing contest, and a Ditch
Day. It was decided that these sug
gestions were too reminiscent of
"high school stuff."
Barbecue Best
Although no official vote was
taken, members of the committee
gave the opinion that the barbecue
would probably be the best plan.
"There are some meek little foot
hills back of the campus on which
we can scamper around," said Bill
Hovey as he expressed approval of
the plan.
No Dressing Up
Peg Woodward, senior vice-presi
dent, told the committee that wear
ing any old clothes would be better
than dressing up for the occasion.
"If we had a barbecue," said
George Ditz, Endowment Fund
chairman, "we could have some sort
of entertainment around a large
bonfire; and if necessary, hire a
professional master of ceremonies to
put the thing over and get everyone
in the desired mood."
No Inhibitions
Prize suggestion of the meeting
was offered by Bob Mcßoskey, sen
ior class president, who offered the
idea of having a day of "no inhibi
tions."
"If we had one," said Mcßoskey,
"I'd like to go in the library and
scream."
