# Benet Talks On Modern Poetry
## Discusses Current Trends In America 
### 
'"A Discussion of Modern Poetry"
was the topic of William Rose Be
net's talk last evening in Memorial
Hall. The distinguished poet, critic,
and lecturer spoke on contemporary
poets and poetry, devoting his last
half-hour to a reading from his own
ballads.
He discussed early American poets,
referring to William Cullen Bryant's
English style as "Wordsworth and
water," and calling Walt Whitman
"the father of free verse." He said
that poetry is often confused with
verse, but is really "the best words
in the best order," whether in versi
fied or prose form.
Emphasizes Trend
He spoke of the post-war Renais
sance in American poetry as em
bodied in the works of Erna St. Vin
cent Millay, Robert Frost, Carl
Sandburg, Vachel Lindsay, Amy
Lowell, and many others.
Mr. Benet emphasized that the
American trend is rough, vivid, fre
quently unrhymed poetry revealing
the essentially American scene.
However, he said that he was more
successful in writing in the old bal
lad style.
Ileads Own Works
He read from his poetry "Whale,"
a whimsical ballad of the creation
of the whale, remarking that it was
a symbolical poem whose symbolism
we would have to discover for our
selves because "half the fun of
writing a symbolical poem is to
keep its meaning to yourself."
He also read "Fawn in the Snow,"
and his "Jesse James," a rollicking
saga of the famous outlaw of the
West whom he tried to exaggerate
as much as possible in keeping with
the American myth.
There was a reception immediately
following tho lecture in the Green
Room, under the direction of the
| Committee on Public Exercises.
