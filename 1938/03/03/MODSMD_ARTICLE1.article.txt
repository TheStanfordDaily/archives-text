### BILL MILLIS 
Q ItEAT BRITAIN'S greatest peace
time war budget was announced
yesterday in a government White
Paper calling for the expenditure of
nearly $10,000,000,000 by 1941 to give
"the tight little isle" world air and
naval supremacy.
For the coming year alone, Eng
land's defense budget will total
$1,716,250,000, an increase of 55
per cent from 1937, when a five
year armaments program was
launched.
The program looks to the building
of 12,000 modern fighting planes and
the commissioning of GO new war
ships by the end of 1938, and comes
on the eve of negotiations of the
projected four power "deal" to sat
isfy the expansionist desires of
Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.
The increased tempo of England's
preparedness—as yet not produced
by the fear of a definitely identified
rival nation—is similar to the ever
mounting appropriations produced
by the Anglo-German naval race
during the decade prior to 1914. '

In Berlin the secret trial of the

/ kNE of the 21 former Bolshevik
leaders now on trial in Moscow
yesterday had the courage to deny
his guilt, to turn upon his accusers
and repudiate the confession he had
made while a prisoner of the N.K.
V.D. secret police.
Nicholas Krestinsky, a trembling
old man who for nine years was
the Soviet ambassador to Germany
and now faces a firing squad as a
Jascist spy," entered a denial of
guilt that was almost unprece
dented in the record of the three
year purge that has claimed more
than 1500 lives.
While he answered the charges,
Krestinsky was noticed glancing ap
prehensively to a small, heavily
draped red box above the judges'
stand. Many of the 200 courtroom
spectators believed that Josef Stalin
was behind the curtains, watching
his enemies fall.

San Francisco and Oakland oper
ators of 50 closed grocery ware

Ifcde the Hagstrom Warehouse strike,
