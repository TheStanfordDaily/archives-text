## Army Gives Aid In TWA Search Mary Louise And Jay Tracy Dirlam Of Stanford Are On Missing Ship 
### 
Aimy airplanes overhead and scores of men on skis and
snowshoes plodding overland late yesterday and last night
sought vainly for trace of a missing Transcontinental and
Western Airways passenger plane, missing near Fresno sincc
9:15 o'clock Tuesday night.
Aboard the plane, with five others, were Mary Louise and
Jay Tracy Dirlam, Stanford students, Pilot John Dunbar

Graves, Stanford '25, and Hervey
M. Salisbury, who attended Stan
ford in 1924.
United Press reported search for
the plane and its occupants, three
of them member ; of the crew, cen
tered in the rough Shaver Lake area
after a road maintenance crew re
ported having heard a "crash" Tues
day night at H:3O o'clock. The crew
first thought a tree had fallen, but
notified the airline when they heard
the plane was missing.
Navy To Aid
In addition to the Army Reserve
planes hunting yesterday, 15 Naval
Reserve planes were preparing to
join the search.
Caught in an intense storm over
the Tehachapi Mountains when
weather conditions necessitated a
detour to Los Angeles, ice started
forming on the plane's wings. The
plane radioed it was returning to
Fresno. That was the last heard of
Plane Seen
Last definite news of the crash
came when Mrs. C. G. Landry, at
the Edison Company powerhouse at
liuntington Lake, 45 miles north of
Fresno, reported .seeing the plane's
red and green lights streaking down
the Big Creek Canyon at 9:20 p.m.
The plane itself was visible, Hying at
about 500 teet, and a heavy rain was
falling, she said.
During the early hours of the
search a false report was received
ovet the telephone by TWA at San
Francisco, supposedly from Fresno
and saying the missing plane had
been found "with several passen
gers injured, but everybody alive."
A cheek proved the call a hoax, de
scribed by the airlines as "one of
the cruelest hoaxes ever perpe
trated."
Three airlines had planes ready
to enter the search today. United
Airlines offered all available equip
ment: and TWA prepared planes at
San Francisco, and American Air
line;- and TWA had planes ready at
Los Angeles.

The plane left San Francisco at
6:30 o'clock Tuesday evening, orig
inally scheduled to fly to Winslow,
Ariz., but because of weather con
ditions it was routed to Los Angeles.

oed:
"We are returning to Fresno."
At 8:50. he said:
"Proceeding to Fresno with a 10,-
000-foot ceiling."

10.000 feet. No decision made at
present. We are still on right side of

Aimy airplanes overhead and scores of men on skis and
snowshoes plodding overland late yesterday and last night
sought vainly for trace of a missing Transcontinental and
Western Airways passenger plane, missing near Fresno sincc
9:15 o'clock Tuesday night.
Aboard the plane, with five others, were Mary Louise and
Jay Tracy Dirlam, Stanford students, Pilot John Dunbar

Graves, Stanford '25, and Hervey
M. Salisbury, who attended Stan
ford in 1924.
United Press reported search for
the plane and its occupants, three
of them member ; of the crew, cen
tered in the rough Shaver Lake area
after a road maintenance crew re
ported having heard a "crash" Tues
day night at H:3O o'clock. The crew
first thought a tree had fallen, but
notified the airline when they heard
the plane was missing.
Navy To Aid
In addition to the Army Reserve
planes hunting yesterday, 15 Naval
Reserve planes were preparing to
join the search.
Caught in an intense storm over
the Tehachapi Mountains when
weather conditions necessitated a
detour to Los Angeles, ice started
forming on the plane's wings. The
plane radioed it was returning to
Fresno. That was the last heard of
Plane Seen
Last definite news of the crash
came when Mrs. C. G. Landry, at
the Edison Company powerhouse at
liuntington Lake, 45 miles north of
Fresno, reported .seeing the plane's
red and green lights streaking down
the Big Creek Canyon at 9:20 p.m.
The plane itself was visible, Hying at
about 500 teet, and a heavy rain was
falling, she said.
During the early hours of the
search a false report was received
ovet the telephone by TWA at San
Francisco, supposedly from Fresno
and saying the missing plane had
been found "with several passen
gers injured, but everybody alive."
A cheek proved the call a hoax, de
scribed by the airlines as "one of
the cruelest hoaxes ever perpe
trated."
