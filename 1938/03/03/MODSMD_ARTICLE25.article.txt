## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, March 2 (UP). —A deluge of 10 inches of rain in four
days and more predicted led Los Angeles officials tonight to prepare for
a possible major flood disaster.
At least six persons were reported dead, property damage was esti
mated as high as $5,000,000, five thousand or more persons were homeless
or marooned in flood-bound homes, and additional hundreds were im
periled by the possibility of

giving way.
The movie beach colony at Malibu
was isolated from all communica
tion. A number of motion picture
residents, including Madeline Car
roll, were believed marooned and
a Coast Guard cutter was sent to
their rescue.

LOS ANGELES, March 2
(UP). —Reports that a loaded
passenger bus had been en
gulfed by a landslide near Gor
man, 50 miles north of here,
sent sheriff's deputies and state
highway patrolmen rushing to
the scene tonight. All com
munication lines with the little
mountain hamlet, on the ridge
route to Bakers field, were out
of order, precluding a check on
tl report.

Los Angeles was cut off from all
rail facilities when the Union Pacific,
Southern Pacific, and Santa Fe
systems announced temporary aban
donment of service because of wash
outs and landslides. Officials said all
rail movements probably would be
halted for at leas l 12 hours.
But the gravti.l fears were felt
for residential districts below flood
control dams. Several districts were
evacuated while in others residents
were standing by, prepared to flee.
Tujunga, Pacoima, Santa Anita,
San Dimas, Eadon, New San Gabriel,
Old San Gabriel. Paddingstone, Dev
il's Gate, Saw Pit, and Live Oak

Council, to co-ordinate relief ef
forts. The Council, created after the
Long Beach earthquake, set up
headquarters in Westlake Park.
