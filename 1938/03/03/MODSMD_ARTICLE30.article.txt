/ 'OACH Wytze Gorter—you know,
* the guy that coaches the fresh
man basketball team —took quite a
ribbing from the boys in El Toro
yesterday. It seems that some en
tecprising secretarial school in San
Francisco sent him a postcard ad
vising him to take up stenography
and such.
The card was addressed to Miss
Wytze Gorter, at his Encina room.
Where anybody ever got the infor
mation that women live at Encina,
and that Gorter is a miss, is com
pletely beyond Gorter, of course.

Coach John Bunn—you know,
the man Chat coaches the varsity
basketball team—hasn't been get
ing any ribbings lately that any
body knows about, but he is go
ing to the National Coaches' As
sociation meeting in Chicago April
'1-5. He will stay over a couple of
days more to attend the National
Rules Committee meeting, April
<»-7.

Anyone interested in swimming
meets ought to drop by Encina Pools
this afternoon tp see the freshman-
Menlo Junior College meet. While
the meet itself might not be too in
teresting, the performance of Roy
Vitousek in the 200-yard breast
.viroke should be worth watching.
There is a catch, however—wom
en won't be admitted. It'll be in the
nature of a strip-tease.
Vitousek, who seems to be able
to swim any stroke for any distance,
is going to have a try at the national
collegiate freshman record of 2:57
in the 200-yard breaststroke. The
record is at present held by a
Swarthmore College student, but,
Vitousek has done 2:36 in practice
and swam the race for the first time
less than a month ago.
In his first trial at the distance,
the gangly freshman butterflied
—or butterflew—the first 125
yards, settled down to the ordinary
underwater stroke, and then fin
ished out the last half of the last
lap in butterfly. Anybody that has
ever seen a sailor-style race knows
what if means to butterfly any
distance at all, and Vitousek said
at the time he thought he could
fly the whole'2oo yards.
In addition to being very strong
at the breaststroke race, Vitousek
is one of the best prospects Stan
ford has ever had in freestyle racing,
from 50 to 220 yards.
The freshman medley relay team
will attempt to lower the new 300-
y.ird national frosh record it set
last week at San Jose, which should
be another attraction for tank fans.

The varsity basketball team's
practice session Tuesday afternoon
was a scintillating gem of defensive
work, according to Coach Bunn.
And the scrimmage that- followed,
between first and second outfits,
was a sizzler for fair. Peterson.
