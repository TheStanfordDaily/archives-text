# Rain Prevents Baseball Game
## 
### 
Due to wet grounds, Stanford's
varsity baseball team was forced to
postpone its C.1.8.A. game with St.
Mary's yesterday afternoon at Mo
raga. The new date for the tilt will
be announced later.
Yesterday's game would have
wound up Stanford's winter confer
ence schedule. The Indians have a
practice tilt with the Gaddini All -
Stars Saturday afternoon on the
Sunken Diamond which will end
their winter season.
After final exams, the squad leaves
for the south to open its spring
schedule with games against U.C.
L.A., U.S.C., and the San Diego Ma
rines during vacation.
