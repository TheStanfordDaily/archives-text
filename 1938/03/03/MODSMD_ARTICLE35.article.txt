# Rain Spoils Track At Santa Anita
## 
### 
ARCADIA, March 2 (UP).—Cali
fornia's usually golden skies spilled
over at the edges again tonight and
washed away the last hope of a fast
track for the fourth running of the
Santa Anita handicap Saturday.
Although the eight-race program
was held as usual today, the big
green plant was drenched. The in
field was covered with water. The
track was sluiced with rains which
fell through the night and day and
continued strong again tonight.
As the horses splashed around to
day, Track Superintendent Herman
Rod admitted that even his mechani
cal salamander — an apparatus
equipped with blow torches—would
be useless now in drying the mile
oval before the start of the $100,000
Western classic.
As hopes of form players ebbed
with each additional drop that fell,
the small band of horsemen who
form the usual off-track brigade re
joiced. The chances of Seabiscuit
dropped considerably, but two con
tenders who are not considered chal
lengers for the rich "purse on a fast
track boomed into the consideration
—Amor Brujo and Star Shadow.
Amor Brujo, the South American
love witch, has won only two races
in the United States, and both were
scored in sloppy going on the North
ern California circuit. Star Shadow,
owned by A. A. Baroni, is made to
order for muck and mud.

Sugar cane was introduced into
Europe by the Moors in the eighth
century.
