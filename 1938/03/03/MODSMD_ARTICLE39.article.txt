and the chance to play the winner of
the southern division—either Cal or
, Stanford—for the Coast title. Ore
j gon is a slight favoiite, but things
| will have to go just right for the
Webfeet for them to come out on
top.

Oregon Favorite
Oregon will cinch the title win if
Washington State and Washington
split, or if Washington takes both
; games. Should Washington Slate
i win two from Washington and Ore
