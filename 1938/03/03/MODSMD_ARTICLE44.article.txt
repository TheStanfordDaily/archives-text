NEW YORK, March 2 (UP). â€”
Strong opposition to a change in the
dates of the 1940 Olympic Games in
Tokyo developed in the United
States today.
After receipt of a cable from Avery
Brundage, one of America's three
representatives to next week's Inter
rational Olympic Committee at
Cairo, Egypt, ihe Amateur Athletic
Union, the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association, the Eastern Inter
collegiate Athletic Association, and
many leading athletic authorities
went on record opposing a shift in
dates.
The change was proposed by the
German delegation to the Interna
tional Amateur Athletic Federation
meeting yesterday in Paris. The
question was discussed heatedly by
th* delegates but was ruled one to
be decided at next week's Olympic
meeting in Cairo.
