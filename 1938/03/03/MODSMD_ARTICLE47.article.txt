# Knights of the Water Pitcher
## 
### 
IT is customary in our assembly-line civiliza
tion to regard with pity those romantic souls
who moan the passing of the knightly spirit and
the death of chivalry. But the latest quotations
at Stanford indicate that these vassals to van
ished glory need not throw in the towel just
yet. The evidence, surprisingly, comes from
the debate squad.
It seems that Farm debaters have been work
ing up a record which for knight-errantry and
chivalric spirit compares very well with some
of the Round Table's best stuff. The debate
squad has adopted the grand old technique of
riding abroad looking for a good fight. At
present a team is touring the country, debating
at colleges. Three teams have just returned
from trips to the Northwest and to Southern
California.
And the results have been gratifying enough
to make even Lancelot's nickel-plated chest
swell. The debaters are making knight-errantry
pay off as well as it ever did for any medieval
pug in pants that had to be pressed by a black
smith.
Historians are somewhat divided on the ques
tion of what the advantages of knighthood
were. The more modern suggest that the best
thing it did was to advertise its sponsor. They
point out that when one of Arthur's boys was
out on circuit, he really made the people
Camelot-conscious.
On this count, the debaters are well on the
credit side. Every time they make a trip, they
advertise Stanford. And they do it in a way
that has educational and cultural connotations.
They give the Farm a reputation for intellec
tual superiority, and they call it to the attention
of prospective students who want a school that
will educate as well as wave pennants.
Also like the old knights, the debaters gather
a fair amount of glory and a good deal of train
ing for themselves. The squire of Camelot who
borrowed a tin suit and set out to knock over
l couple of dragons did it because he wanted
axperience. The debater who goes off to tangle
with somebody from another college also gets
experience. And it is exprience that will be of
considerable help later on when he wants to
put an idea over with the boss.
At present most of the debaters are at home.
But the two roving representatives in the East
are sending shields back regularly. And three
of the squad are planning an invasion of that
ogre's castle, San Quentin. There they will
debate a team composed of inmates on the
question, "Resolved: That Modern Civilization
Kills Personality."
The squad is making Stanford better known.
It is improving its own skill. It is doing its part
to encourage thought on the problems that am
bush the college student. That should be
enough to satisfy even the most demanding ad
mirers of knight-errantry.—J. C.

ogre's castle, San Quentin. There they will
debate a team composed of inmates on the
question, "Resolved: That Modern Civilization
Kills Personality."
The squad is making Stanford better known.
It is improving its own skill. It is doing its part
to encourage thought on the problems that am
bush the college student. That should be
enough to satisfy even the most demanding ad
mirers of knight-errantry.—J. C.
IT is customary in our assembly-line civiliza
tion to regard with pity those romantic souls
who moan the passing of the knightly spirit and
the death of chivalry. But the latest quotations
at Stanford indicate that these vassals to van
ished glory need not throw in the towel just
yet. The evidence, surprisingly, comes from
the debate squad.
It seems that Farm debaters have been work
ing up a record which for knight-errantry and
chivalric spirit compares very well with some
of the Round Table's best stuff. The debate
squad has adopted the grand old technique of
riding abroad looking for a good fight. At
present a team is touring the country, debating
at colleges. Three teams have just returned
from trips to the Northwest and to Southern
California.
And the results have been gratifying enough
to make even Lancelot's nickel-plated chest
swell. The debaters are making knight-errantry
pay off as well as it ever did for any medieval
pug in pants that had to be pressed by a black
smith.
Historians are somewhat divided on the ques
tion of what the advantages of knighthood
were. The more modern suggest that the best
thing it did was to advertise its sponsor. They
point out that when one of Arthur's boys was
out on circuit, he really made the people
Camelot-conscious.
On this count, the debaters are well on the
credit side. Every time they make a trip, they
advertise Stanford. And they do it in a way
that has educational and cultural connotations.
They give the Farm a reputation for intellec
tual superiority, and they call it to the attention
of prospective students who want a school that
will educate as well as wave pennants.
Also like the old knights, the debaters gather
a fair amount of glory and a good deal of train
ing for themselves. The squire of Camelot who
borrowed a tin suit and set out to knock over
l couple of dragons did it because he wanted
axperience. The debater who goes off to tangle
with somebody from another college also gets
experience. And it is exprience that will be of
considerable help later on when he wants to
put an idea over with the boss.
At present most of the debaters are at home.
But the two roving representatives in the East
are sending shields back regularly. And three
of the squad are planning an invasion of that
ogre's castle, San Quentin. There they will
debate a team composed of inmates on the
