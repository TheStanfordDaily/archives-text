# Be Yourself

### 
MINOR squalls have ruffled Stanford's
placid disposition recently, centering
around a letter to The Daily which declared
that the Farm is not the "Harvard of the West."
Seething readers flogged their weary Under
woods into bursts of caustic reply. And the
burden of the answers was like a small boy's
retort to an insult, "We are too the Harvard
of the West."
No one, it seems, wondered why we should
be like Harvard, or like any other university.
All took it for granted that to attain the pin
nacle of collegiate glory we must make our
selves over to resemble somebody else. We
rose in wrath not because letter-writing Mar
garet assaulted our sack suits and drafty Pa
vilion, but because she told us we were not like
Harvard. That was the shaft that dented our
armor of apathy.
Almost from the day the horses were herded
out of the pasture and the cornerstone was laid,
Stanford has been cursed with a passion for
imitation. We are not content to be ourselves,
a comfortably fixed university on the up-grade.
When somebody proposes a new course, the
first question is, "What are the other universi
ties doing?" When we give a dance, we don't
rate it according to how much we enjoyed it,
or according to how responsive the girl was;
instead we compare it with our idea of Harvard
dances, and rate it according to the precision
of the imitation*
Stanford is not like Harvard. It is some three
thousand miles away. It is in a different part
of the country, and it is a couple of hundred
years younger.

As a matter of fact, Harvard is not the maid
en's dreamland Margaret pictures it. Sack suits
seli nicely in Cambridge, and the delicate
flower of conversation does not grow without
cultivation.
But Stanford can get along very well regard
less of what Harvard does. We have a well-en
dowed, well-equipped plant, and a capable fac
ulty. Most of our student body has been taught
to use a fork, and not to swear before elderly
ladies and children.
It is a bit incongruous for us to go chasing
after Harvard's customs like a mountain with
an inferiority complex coming at Mohammed's
whistle.â€”J. C.
