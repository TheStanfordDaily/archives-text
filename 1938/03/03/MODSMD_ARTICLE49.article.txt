# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
comes the happy season of vacation, and pres
ently along the Row among the budding trees of
spring will be seen the scurrying figures of Nathan
Van Patten's busy, busy L-Men, once more on their
periodic search for the books which naughty students
have forgotten to return to the Libe.
There must be fully 10 of these, all told, but one
wouldn't know it from the amount of hustle and bustle
that goes on. Each vacation, as surely as the sun rises
and the winds blow, the Flying Squadron travels up
Lasuen, goes through the rooms whose owners, the in
nocent and trusting.nit-wits, have neglected to lock
the doors, and in general conducts itself in a manner a
Moot Court lawyer would label illegal entry.
It may not be illegal entry under the rules of the
University—it reserves the right to enter any house
on the campus—but in the Fourth Article of the Con
stitution of the United States of America, there is one
significant sentence which reads as follows:
"The right of the people to be secure in their per
sons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated. . ."
Now offhand, that would look like a pretty bad
thing for the University. "Houses." "Papers"—in
cluding books. "Searches and seizures."
Furthermore, not only is the Administration acting
in an unconstitutional manner, God forbid, but it runs
the danger of taking things which do not belong to
it as well.
'"J'HERE has been at least one case—and the injured
individual will swear to it on a copy of the Presi
dent's Report, if necessary—in which a student, think
ing he had lost a book, bought a copy of it for the Li
brary. Subsequently he found the original volume.
Being a believer in the Honor Code, he offered to give
it to the University in return for the price of the new
book he had bought. When he met with refusal, he
was annoyed, but rather pleased to think he had got
ten something from the System, if only a worm-eaten
book.
This innocent, however, did not know the Library.
Came vacation, and Mr. Van Patten once more ordered
his minions to hit the trail. Arriving in the room —
let us not ask how—of the injured individual, they
alighted upon the book, as one man gave a joyful cry,
seized it, and added it to the swag. And when the in
jured individual came back from vacation and dis
covered his ravaged room, and went to the Libe for
his book, do you think he got it?
Do you?
So if the Row returns after vacation to find those
long overdue copies of "Middletown" missing, it will
know that once more Detachment D has made the
rounds; that onnce more Mr. Van Patten, sitting in his
office like some earnest Generalissimo, presumably has
given the command which regularly nets him a satis
fying—if rather infinitesmal—shelf of recovered books.
