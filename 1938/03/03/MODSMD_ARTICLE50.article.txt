(In the following clipping from the California
Daily Bruin at U.C.L.A., the editorial department
takes a whirl at a problem of defining terms,
pointed by examples from their own campus.)
O n ? of the favorite campus by-words these days is
the phrase "for the good of the University." Every
body is working for the good of the University; every
one is concerned with the welfare of the University.
This attitude, so long as it is sincere, and is sub
stantiated by the facts, is highly commendable. A
problem arises, however, when facts and activities do
not jibe, when the results do not conform with the ap
parent intentions.
New students, for example, are rushed into activi
ties in which they spend all their valuable time "for
the good of the University." More advanced students,
facing the same problem salve their consciences by
telling themselves that they arc working for the good
of the University.
Even faculty members have not been above employ
ing this phrase as a password into an unreality where
they can divorce themselves completely from the
ethical and social implications of a particular situation.
So long as they can escape with the good-of-the-Uni
versity excuses, their motives are not questioned.
The result is, at present, a muddled conglomeration
of activities, misguided and floundering, all apparently
being carried on for the benefit of this institution, yet
each conflicting with others.
For example: on the one hand, they clamor for
more and better football under bigger and better ath
letic heads. On the other, they shout for less spectator
sports—all the interests of the University.
One group works furiously for a bigger Home
coming (bigger bonfires, longer parades, more Blue
and Gold banners), another group points out—in the
same interests of the University, that Homecoming is
hardly the function of any institution of education.
The same situation holds throughout all the activi
ties of the Associated Students: they arc not planned,
they are just conducted.
Up on the quad, the University is apparently suf
fering from a similar ailment. It can't seem to make
up its mind whether its purpose is to train students for
specific professions or whether it should really educate
them. It is also caught in the conflict between contin
ued expansion and thorough mastery of its present
facilities. It has let itself be carried away by the good
for-the-University attitude without investigating each
particular instance of application.
Individual professors, lost in the whirl, don't know
where to turn. Some try to clamp down—in the in
terests of the University. Others, with the same end in
mind, lurn the other way and see other (nlso desirable)
interests.
On the whole, ihe picture is growing so confused
that it's time to call a temporary halt.
It s time th;it the University—for its own good—
defined more clearly what its aims are and where its
purposes lie. It's time that it said definitely what the
"good of the University" actually is.

pointed by examples from their own campus.)
O n ? of the favorite campus by-words these days is
the phrase "for the good of the University." Every
body is working for the good of the University; every
one is concerned with the welfare of the University.
This attitude, so long as it is sincere, and is sub
stantiated by the facts, is highly commendable. A
problem arises, however, when facts and activities do
not jibe, when the results do not conform with the ap
parent intentions.
New students, for example, are rushed into activi
ties in which they spend all their valuable time "for
the good of the University." More advanced students,
facing the same problem salve their consciences by
telling themselves that they arc working for the good
of the University.
Even faculty members have not been above employ
ing this phrase as a password into an unreality where
they can divorce themselves completely from the
ethical and social implications of a particular situation.
So long as they can escape with the good-of-the-Uni
versity excuses, their motives are not questioned.
The result is, at present, a muddled conglomeration
of activities, misguided and floundering, all apparently
being carried on for the benefit of this institution, yet
each conflicting with others.
For example: on the one hand, they clamor for
more and better football under bigger and better ath
letic heads. On the other, they shout for less spectator
sports—all the interests of the University.
One group works furiously for a bigger Home
coming (bigger bonfires, longer parades, more Blue
and Gold banners), another group points out—in the
same interests of the University, that Homecoming is
hardly the function of any institution of education.
The same situation holds throughout all the activi
ties of the Associated Students: they arc not planned,
they are just conducted.
Up on the quad, the University is apparently suf
fering from a similar ailment. It can't seem to make
up its mind whether its purpose is to train students for
specific professions or whether it should really educate
them. It is also caught in the conflict between contin
ued expansion and thorough mastery of its present
facilities. It has let itself be carried away by the good
for-the-University attitude without investigating each
particular instance of application.
Individual professors, lost in the whirl, don't know
where to turn. Some try to clamp down—in the in
terests of the University. Others, with the same end in
mind, lurn the other way and see other (nlso desirable)
interests.
On the whole, ihe picture is growing so confused
that it's time to call a temporary halt.
It s time th;it the University—for its own good—
defined more clearly what its aims are and where its
purposes lie. It's time that it said definitely what the
"good of the University" actually is.
(In the following clipping from the California
Daily Bruin at U.C.L.A., the editorial department
takes a whirl at a problem of defining terms,
pointed by examples from their own campus.)
