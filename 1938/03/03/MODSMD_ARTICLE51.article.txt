## DEAR IRKED AND MARGARET 
### 
Dear "Irked" and "Margaret":
c/o The Editor, Sir:
While in imminent danger of pro
longing a mock heroic battle of pil
low proportion about the compara
tive modes of dress on the Stanford
and Harvard campuses, I wish to say
that you two children have missed
the cardinal point. "Margaret," I'll
deal with you first. My dear girl, in
demanding that Stanford men dress
as Harvard men at classes, you evi
dently have no understanding of the
chill of an eastern winter, the gen
eral meteorological disparity be
tween New England and California.
These poor boys here are only a few
degrees removed from the sub-tropic
zone. However, concerning occa
sions that demand dressing, I must
confess that Stanford is boorish.
And as for you, "Irked," I must
say that your name should be "Irk"
instead, for that is precisely your
effect. Some day when you have
lecbvered from your reverential
contemplation of the good old days
at Stanford, you might look at a
few of America's leading men in
various walks of life. Find out how
many of them are Harvard men. It
will probably surprise you. And
concerning the Harvard broad "A,"
that is a fallacy of the same general
category as the Oxford-British ac
cent. As for your comparisons of
Harvard and Stockton Filipino
dress, you know that to be false.
And now, goodbye, you two chil
dren. This has been pleasant and.
I trust, instructive. Remember, that,
of all my children, I like to help
most the man animal, which I be
lieve you term "homo sapiens." In
short, you and you.
—Old Mother Nature.
