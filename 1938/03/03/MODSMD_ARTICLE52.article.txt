# SORROW OVER ROUGHS
## 
### 
Dear Miss Margaret
c/o The Editor, Sir:
Stanfoixl men are the Roughs of
the West, the Harvard men arc the
Gentlemen of the East—such a nasty
contrast. That poor misinformed
soul who called Stanford the "Har
vard of the West" will pull his asy
lum bed-covers over his head when
the truth is revealed. Yes, Miss
Margaret, I agree with you, the guy
was all wrong, thank God!
I come from way back East, from
a little backwoods place in the
mountains called West Virginia. I
don't suppose you ever heard of it,
but it can be found on the larger
maps. A few of us luckier guys
manage to defy the laws of nature
and escape from this wilderness.
Some of the fellows I went to school
with are now at Princeton, U. of Vir
ginia, Pennsylvania, and Harvard.
I didn't know what Stanford was
like, so I came here, but not before
I tried my own state university for
three months. No, I wasn't kicked
out.
With all due respect, I can't help
but say that West Virginia Univer
sity is nothing but a cheap imitation
of the hide-bound, half-baked, con
ventional provincialism of the Big
Three. Individualism has about as
much chance as a Chinaman in To
kyo. You do what the rest of the
gentlemen do, or convention will
slap you down.
My first year at Stanford, I
brought three suits and a tux. After
my first two weeks, I bought u pair
of jeans. At the end of the year, I
took inventory. My tux had moth
holes, my suits were rigid with sel
dom-touched creases, and my jeans
were worn out. I hope you follow
my rather poor analogy.
I'm sorry the conversation of the
Stanford Rough is boring, but he
likqs to get drunk and doesn't mind
admitting it. The Harvard gentle
man is also susceptible to inebria
tion, but he would rather tell his
date how cultured he is.—Buss, '40.
The Editor, Sir:
Dear Margaret,
Why don't you go to Harvard?
—Helpful.

My first year at Stanford, I
brought three suits and a tux. After
my first two weeks, I bought u pair
of jeans. At the end of the year, I
took inventory. My tux had moth
holes, my suits were rigid with sel
dom-touched creases, and my jeans
were worn out. I hope you follow
my rather poor analogy.
I'm sorry the conversation of the
Stanford Rough is boring, but he
likqs to get drunk and doesn't mind
admitting it. The Harvard gentle
man is also susceptible to inebria
tion, but he would rather tell his
date how cultured he is.—Buss, '40.
The Editor, Sir:
Dear Margaret,
Why don't you go to Harvard?
—Helpful.
