## Trueblood Suggests Men's Service Club 
### 
In an address before the Luncheon
Club yesterday, D. Elton Trueblood,
University chaplain, briefly ex
plained the four phases of an ideal
university spiritual program: in
struction, fellowship, worship, and
service; and suggested means by
which these could better be applied
to Stanford's present set-up.
"The most important single need,
along this line" said Dr. Trueblood,
"is for a more adequate Christian
service outlet. Stanford is criti
cized by outsiders for its monastic
aspects; they say that we have be
come too comfortable, too easy; out
of swing with the world. We need
a more vital contact with the press
ing problems of our world."
To achieve these aims Dr. True
blood also suggested: an enlarge
ment of the facilities for religious
study at Stanford; a development of
the "student - conducted" service
idea; and the development of more
religious fellowship groups on the
campus, particularly a men's serv
ice club.
As Dr. Trueblood, director of the
club, will be traveling in the East
on leave of absence during next
quarter, members faced the alterna
tive of suspending club i-ctivities un
til next fall or developing a new
organization. By an almost unani
mous vote, it was decided to con
tinue next quarter under the direc
tion of a newly appointed committee
headed by Wilma Baker.
