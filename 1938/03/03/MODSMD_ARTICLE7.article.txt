# Food Shortage Fears Allayed
## Farm Won't Starve According To Ayres 
### 
The campus is in no immediate
danger of a food shortage in spite
of the San Francisco warehouse
strike, Elliot Ayres, head of the Stu
dent Wholesale Commissary, said
yesterday.
The general strike of 46 food !
warehouses in San Francisco and j
Oakland has endangered the food
supply of retail stores in and around
San Francisco. The supply of food
stuffs in these stores is generally
low, because, in view of an expected
price recession, store managers have
refrained from purchasing large
amounts of food.
Staple foods, however, have been
supplied to the University from an
unknown source, supposedly from
a warehouse on the Peninsula.
Although there is no immediate
danger, the situation may become
serious if the combination strike
lockout lasts as long as three weeks,
since the stock in retail stores is
low.
A request for flour was received
by Mr. Ayres from the Palo Alto
Hospital yesterday. With so much
sickness in Palo Alto, the hospital
didn't have enough flour for the nec
essary mustard plasters. The Uni
versity co-operated, and donated the
flour.
The Student Wholesale Commis
sary was forced to borrow 100
pounds of salt from a sausage fac
tory, it was disclosed today. How
ever, enough sugar for two months,
and a supply of flour was received
by Mr. Ayres.
"We may be out of apricot and
pineapple, but I am sure the stu
dents won t mind eating strawberry
jam. We also have lots of pineapple
juice, Mr. Ayres said.
