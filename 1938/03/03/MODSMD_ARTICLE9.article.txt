A luncheon planned for 300 Ste

the campus April 10 was found in
feasible since they will arrive at
7:30 o'clock in the morning.
Dismissing all thoughts of a break
fast for the visitors because of "ir
regularities in fraternity and eating
club hours,"' Cardinals decided on a
tour of the Campus. The women
will leave by noon, it was explained.
A chairman was appointed tenta
tively to head a committee to man
age a tea April 9 for 250 visiting
members of the Northern California

versy that sometimes follows its ap
pointments, Cardinals decided that
choices will not be announced here
after until appointees have accepted.
