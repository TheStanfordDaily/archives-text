## 
### 
Ibsen's saga of the North, "The
Vikings" will play for Stanford audi
ences tonight and tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock in the Memorial Hall
Theater. Thomas Wood Stevens,
Stanford director, heads production.
Gary Simpson, Frances Farmer,
Virginia Rogers, Douglas Bryan, and
J. P. Cahn play the stellar roles in
the Norwegian playwright's tale of
Viking heroes.
Set at the time of Eric Bloodaxe,
the play dramatizes wars, religion,
and passions of primitive peoples.
Simpson appears as Ornulf, stern
patriarch of Iceland who invades the
Norwegian shores to wreak ven
geance on the Vikings who have
borne off his daughters. How he is
reconciled forms the core of the plot.
Between acts for the dress re
hearsal last night, cast members
discussed their final major show of
the year.
"Gosh, that play's tremendous."
said Dan Holtom, who plays Thor
olf, a stripling warrior. "It takes
everything you've got."
Virginia Rogers, who appears as
I docile daughter of Ornulf.
' agreed. "Absolutely," she said. "It's
! pure Wagner in play form."
"But more up-to-date," qualified
! Bryan, the sturdy Viking Sigurd.
1 'I think there's even a little Freud
ian twist in the Third Act—when
i Tjordis is sort of repressed about
loving Sigurd."
"Yeah, there isn't a dull moment,"
put :n Elsier Haile, one of the war
riors. "When it isn't love it's a fight."
