# Indians Sharpen Axe for Bear Scalp
## Cardinals, Cal Battle Tonight Luisetti Aims For National Scoring Mark As Climax To League Career 
### 
For the third time in as inanv years, John Bunn's Stanford basketball -
ers are at the end ot the trail which leads to the southern division title,
and. ultimately, the Pacific Coast Championship.
The Laughing Boys, leading the pack to the finish line of the 193S
season, take 011 California tonight in the Berkeley Pavilion in the year's

.last scheduled game. Starting time
is 8 o'clock.
The Bears, in second place, may bo
playing their lust game. In second
place, one game behind the Indians,
Nibs Price's quintet must win to
stay in the running. A victory for
the boys-,from-|icross-t he-mudflats
will tie final standings for first place,
and necessitate a playoff game.
Should this tie-breaker become a
reality, it will be held in San Fran
cisco's Civic Auditorium tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock, Rooters' tickets
for the game will go on sale at the
B.A.C. tomorrow morning from 8:30
to 12 noon at 40 cents each. There
will be a few general admission tic
kets at $1.10 per. No ducats will be
sold in San Francisco.
Winner of tonight's game—or the
playoff game, if it is needed—will
meet the top northern division team
in a two-out-of-three series next
week-end. This series will be played
one game in the Civic Auditorium,
and the other—and third, if needed—
in the home Pavilion of either Stan
ford or California.
Another Record For Hank
Tonight's game, the last scheduled
Big Game of the year, will be the
one in which Captain Hank Luisetti,
Stanford's Ail-American, will un
doubtedly break the national four
year basketball scoring record of
1531 points.
Hank last week smashed his own
conference mark of 208 for one sea
son of play by scoring 210 points.
The Indian leader now has a total of
1528 markers—just four points short
of a new record.
And tonight's game may be the
one which will bring the Laughing
Boys their third straight southern
division title, and lead to the third
consecutive Coast Championship.
Indians Moving Now
After a slow start, Coach John
Bunn's 1938 Red Machine began
moving ahead steadily, playing the
type of ball which has earned them
the title of the nation's best team.
The Cards are now in the best physi
cal and mental condition they have
hit so far this season.
On the other hand ,the California
team is this year's "unpredictable."
Up and down, the Bears have never
been a sure bet. Making the ma
jority of their points on long shots,
the Pricemen have very often looked
ragged. Take, for example, the 60-
27 massacre administered by South
ern California.
And ail of this has led up to one
of the closest races in many a sea
son, a race which, mentioned at the
start of the year, would have
brought guffaws to hoop fans far
and wide.
But it's here, and all the pre
game predictions in the world can't
stop tonight's tilt from being a hys
teria-producer of the first water.

Hank last week smashed his own
conference mark of 208 for one sea
son of play by scoring 210 points.
The Indian leader now has a total of
1528 markers—just four points short
of a new record.
And tonight's game may be the
one which will bring the Laughing
Boys their third straight southern
division title, and lead to the third
consecutive Coast Championship.
Indians Moving Now
After a slow start, Coach John
Bunn's 1938 Red Machine began
moving ahead steadily, playing the
type of ball which has earned them
the title of the nation's best team.
The Cards are now in the best physi
cal and mental condition they have
hit so far this season.
On the other hand ,the California
team is this year's "unpredictable."
Up and down, the Bears have never
been a sure bet. Making the ma
jority of their points on long shots,
the Pricemen have very often looked
ragged. Take, for example, the 60-
27 massacre administered by South
ern California.
And ail of this has led up to one
of the closest races in many a sea
son, a race which, mentioned at the
start of the year, would have
brought guffaws to hoop fans far
and wide.
But it's here, and all the pre
game predictions in the world can't
stop tonight's tilt from being a hys
teria-producer of the first water.
For the third time in as inanv years, John Bunn's Stanford basketball -
ers are at the end ot the trail which leads to the southern division title,
and. ultimately, the Pacific Coast Championship.
The Laughing Boys, leading the pack to the finish line of the 193S
season, take 011 California tonight in the Berkeley Pavilion in the year's

.last scheduled game. Starting time
is 8 o'clock.
The Bears, in second place, may bo
playing their lust game. In second
place, one game behind the Indians,
Nibs Price's quintet must win to
stay in the running. A victory for
the boys-,from-|icross-t he-mudflats
will tie final standings for first place,
and necessitate a playoff game.
Should this tie-breaker become a
reality, it will be held in San Fran
cisco's Civic Auditorium tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock, Rooters' tickets
for the game will go on sale at the
B.A.C. tomorrow morning from 8:30
to 12 noon at 40 cents each. There
will be a few general admission tic
kets at $1.10 per. No ducats will be
sold in San Francisco.
Winner of tonight's game—or the
playoff game, if it is needed—will
meet the top northern division team
in a two-out-of-three series next
week-end. This series will be played
one game in the Civic Auditorium,
and the other—and third, if needed—
in the home Pavilion of either Stan
ford or California.
Another Record For Hank
Tonight's game, the last scheduled
Big Game of the year, will be the
one in which Captain Hank Luisetti,
Stanford's Ail-American, will un
doubtedly break the national four
year basketball scoring record of
1531 points.
Hank last week smashed his own
conference mark of 208 for one sea
son of play by scoring 210 points.
