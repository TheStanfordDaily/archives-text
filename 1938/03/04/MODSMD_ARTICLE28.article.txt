# Farm-Cal Air Clubs To Hold Dual Meet
## 
### 
The flying 'clubs of Stanford and
California will hold their first air
meet of the 1938 series at the Palo
Alto airport Sunday morning,
weather permitting. The contest will
be for possession of the new Roos
Brothers Perpetual Trophy, which is
to be kept by the winning club un
til the next meet of the series.
The competition will consist of
three events, permission having
been received from Air Commerce
Inspector Mc√üride. These will be
the 360-degree turn approach from
1000 feet and "spot landing, 180-de
gree turn approach from 1000 feet
and "spot" landing, and "bomb"
dropping from 500 feet at.a 50-foot
target.
Ability Tested
"Spot" landings are a test of a
flyer's ability to land in a limited
space in an emergency, while

"bomb" dropping tests the ability to
judge velocity and direction of wind
currents and the exact position of a
plane in relation to the ground.
Johnny Park, veteran of two In
tercollegiate Meets and winner of
the high-point trophy in 1936 at De
troit, and Dick Williams, point-win
ner in the 1937 yational meet at New
York, are the two men on whom the
Stanford Flying Club pins its hopes.
Two Farm coeds, Joan King and
Marion Jackson, are also scheduled
to appear in the meet.
Cal Led By Ace
The California airmen will be led
by Joe Bailey, president of the Uni
versity of California Flying Club
and high-point man in the Bear-
Indian meet last November.
It is reported that the undefeated
Stanford club has been picked to
win easily, adding to their long list
of victories over Cal and U.S.C.
