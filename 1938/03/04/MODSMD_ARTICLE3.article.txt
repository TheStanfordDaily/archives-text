# Six Planes Search For Lost Liner
## Snow Flurries, Rain Hamper Efforts To Find Missing Airship 
### 
Six airplanes made an unsuccess
ful search of the Shaver Lake area
yesterday in attempting to find trace
of Transcontinental and Western
airliner which disappeared Tuesday
night with nine persons aboard.
Passengers included Mary Lou
and Tracy Dirlam, Stanford students,
en route to Mansfield, Ohio, where
their father is seriously ill. The
pilot was Captain J. G. Graves of
North Palo Alto, a graduate of
Stanford. Another pilot aboard was
Hervey M. Salisbury, former Stan
ford student.
Hunt in Mountains
The United Press reported last
night the searching airplanes, ham
pered by snow in the mountains and
rain in the lower foothills, covered
an area of 30 square miles with
Castle Peak, HO miles northeast of
Fresno, as its center. It was in that
area that the plane was last seen
and heard.
Heading the armada of rescue
ships was a tri-motored TWA Doug
las transport ship identical to the lost
airliner. It carried 14 men, includ
ing Bureau of Air Commerce offi
cials, Jack Frye, president of TWA,
and other company officials.
Believe All Dead
Aviators at Fresno feared the lost
plane crashed on a mountainside
during a snowstorm and that its
three crew members and six pas
sengers were killed. TWA officials
still held hope the craft came down
safely with no loss of life on hard
packed, eight-foot snow near Shav
er Lake.
Four hundred ground searchers,
including more than 300 CCC en
rollees, fought through heavy snow
flurries and biting gales without
finding a trace of the giant airliner.
A map sketched by aviation ex
perts on the basis of reports of resi
dents in the Shaver Lake area who
heard the plane Tuesday night
showed that the plane probably went
down in the vicinity of Castle Peak.
Chances of Safety-
Donald Black, spokesman for the
airline, said there was "every possi
bility that the craft landed safely in
a snow-covered mountain meadow."
Mr. Black contended that, because
of the deep snows, it would be dif
ficult for the passengers and crew to
get from the plane to any point of
communication.
Adding to the difficulty of the
search, 11 inches of snow fell yes
terday in the district where the
hunt is centered.
