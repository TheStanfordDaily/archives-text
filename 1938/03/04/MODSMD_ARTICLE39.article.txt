LOS ANGELES, March 3 (By
Mackay Radio to San Francisco).—
The death toll of Southern Califor
nia's worst cloudburst and flood in
(!1 years probably will reach the IUO
mark, authorities said tonight as the
downpour abated and rampaging
rivers began to recede.
Estimates of the death toll, as re
lief workers moved through the
debris of a devastated area 30,000
miles square, ranged from 80 dead
and missing to 90. Fifteen bodies
have been recovered, and 31 other
persons were known definitely to be
missing.
Looting Reported
Looting was added to the horror
of the situation as reports reached
police that prowlers were entering
abandoned homes and stores in the
Santa Monica Canyon, San Fernando
Valley and Venice areas.
Property damage was estimated at
25,000,000 and 10,000 were homeless
after the unprecedented rainfall of
11 inches, during a four-day deluge.
As the sun broke through scud
ding clouds, permitting the start of
reconstruction, this city remained
isolated. Not a train moved, motor
traffic outside the metropolitan area
was crippled by lack of bridges, and
most communication lines were still
down.
Situation Briefly
The situation at a glance:
Los Angeles—Fifteen known dead.
Dayton Avenue and several other
small bridges over Los Angeles
River wrecked. Several hundred
homeless in lowland areas. Outlying
streets littered debris; rail traffic

when dam broke city park west Riv
erside. Communication lines dis

Los Angeles River; witnesses report
boy and two women also perished
in plunge, although police lacked
confirmation. Between 50 and 75
refugees housed in National Guard
armory. Water subsiding in north
and west district and in Walnut and
State area. Four bridges out, two
closed, one open. All schools closed.
Ontario—Mother and two children
drowned when flood of San Antonio
engulfed car, two other children
saved. CCC camp in Cucamonga
Canyon destroyed, 100 enrollees
made flight safely. Transit camp in
San Antonio Canyon destroyed, and
some of 135 occupants feared miss
ing. Camp Baldy Mountain district
isolated but meager reports indicate
no casualties.

LOS ANGELES, March 3 (By
Mackay Radio to San Francisco).—
The death toll of Southern Califor
nia's worst cloudburst and flood in
(!1 years probably will reach the IUO
mark, authorities said tonight as the
downpour abated and rampaging
rivers began to recede.
Estimates of the death toll, as re
lief workers moved through the
debris of a devastated area 30,000
miles square, ranged from 80 dead
and missing to 90. Fifteen bodies
have been recovered, and 31 other
persons were known definitely to be
missing.
Looting Reported
Looting was added to the horror
of the situation as reports reached
police that prowlers were entering
abandoned homes and stores in the
Santa Monica Canyon, San Fernando
Valley and Venice areas.
Property damage was estimated at
25,000,000 and 10,000 were homeless
after the unprecedented rainfall of
11 inches, during a four-day deluge.
As the sun broke through scud
ding clouds, permitting the start of
reconstruction, this city remained
isolated. Not a train moved, motor
traffic outside the metropolitan area
was crippled by lack of bridges, and
most communication lines were still
down.
Situation Briefly
The situation at a glance:
Los Angeles—Fifteen known dead.
Dayton Avenue and several other
small bridges over Los Angeles
River wrecked. Several hundred
homeless in lowland areas. Outlying
streets littered debris; rail traffic
halted. Isolated cases of looting re
ported. Schools closed. Air lines re
sumed operation.
Riverside—Fifteen reported dead
when dam broke city park west Riv
erside. Communication lines dis
rupted.
North Hollywood—Three bodies j
recovered, nine reported missing :

Glendale—Two men and youth •
reported missing; 100 refugees shel- i

into homes. Legionnaires guarded
flooded Ethel Street from looters.
Long Beach—Five known missing
In footbridge collapsed at mouth of
Los Angeles River; witnesses report
boy and two women also perished
in plunge, although police lacked
confirmation. Between 50 and 75
refugees housed in National Guard
armory. Water subsiding in north
and west district and in Walnut and
State area. Four bridges out, two
closed, one open. All schools closed.
Ontario—Mother and two children
drowned when flood of San Antonio
engulfed car, two other children
saved. CCC camp in Cucamonga
Canyon destroyed, 100 enrollees
made flight safely. Transit camp in
San Antonio Canyon destroyed, and
some of 135 occupants feared miss
ing. Camp Baldy Mountain district
isolated but meager reports indicate
no casualties.

evacuated homes flooded to depth as
great as nine feet. Several hundred
residents began returning to homes
