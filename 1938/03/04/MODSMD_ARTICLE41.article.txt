# Farm fries To Contact Marooned L.A. Homes
## 
### 
"All we know is what we read in
i the papers," Los Angeles students
! said of their home town last night.
, With all telegraph and telephone
j wires down and no trains running,
j students tried vainly to contact rela-
I lives in the south.
Students who had not written
home since Washington's birthday
became suddenly solicitous for the
welfare of their families, were able
to learn only that a man had been
arrested on Wilshire Boulevard for
crossing a red light in a kyak, and
that more rain was forecast for the
oLs Angeles area. .
One iLne Through
A Palo Alto telegraph operator
stated early yesterday evening that
[ a line had been put through from
I San Francisco to the stricken city,
! but that there were so many mes
| sages piled up to send that the wires
| could not be cleared for some time.
After more than four hours effort,
| Marion Pfau( Roblcite, is reported
Jby friends to have put through a
telephone call to her parents in Los
Angeles. Her father reassured her
as to her family's safety, telling her
how he had had to be rowed across
the street from the Biltmore Hotel
in a rowboat.
Can't Reach Family
Phyllis Newman, Chi O, put in a
standing call to her home on
Wednesday night, and was called out
of bed at 4:30 the next morning to
receive it.

"I heard a man's voice on the
wire," she related, "and thought it
was my home. Then the operator
cut in and said she was sorry, but
the lines were mixed and I had been
talking to some fire station.
"I told her I wanted Brentwood
Heights, and she said, 'I'm sorry,
but that part of Los Angeles has
been evacuated.' "
No Alarm
Phyllis refuses to be alarmed,
however, as do the majority of the
students from the afflicted region.
"I'm sure nothing could really
happen to our house," she declared,
"Although we do still have a water
mark around the living room from
the New Year's flood a few years
ago."
Bill Woolston, Phi Delt, had a
unique complaint. "Our house used
to be in the 400 block,," he main
tained, "but now it has washed clear
down to the 600 block, and we'll have
to change our address again."
Flies Own Plane
Bill's father flew up from Los An
geles on business in his own plane
last night, and brought the news of
the Woolston's displaced dwelling.
"It's nothing new," Bill added.
"The house started out in the 100
block, and in the New Year's flood
several years ago it floated right
down to the 400's. Each time we just
prop it up with new foundations,
buy another lot, and there we are.
It's a lot cheaper than taking it
back."
