SAN FRANCISCO, March 3 (UP).
Telling stories of streets turned into
lakes, of overturned houses, of up
rooted trees and dramatic rescues,
the first persons to return to San
Francisco from flood-stricken Los
Angeles arrived today by United
Airlines.
Miss Edna Lee said she was at
tempting to drive back to San Fran
cisco with a friend when they were
struck by full force of the storm be
tween Oxnard and Ventura. Trees
crashed across the highways, forc
ing them to turn back. They took a
plane out of Los Angeles.
"All over Los Angeles the streets
into lakes," said Dr. N. S. Housman.
"We saw one house collapse. A
woman and child were killed there.
We saw a man struggling for his
life in the Los Angeles river until
he was rescued when someone threw
him a rope.
"There were only about 2000
people at the Santa Anita races. The
track was so muddy you couldn't
tell who was winning. You couldn't
see anything but flying mud," Dr.
Housman said.
"We heard wild reports that a
tornado was sweeping into Los An
geles, and that everyone should stay
indoors. The radio was thick with
rumors and warnings."
