Sounds fishy maybe but it's true:
At the height of yesterday's storm,
Dorothy Nelson shed a three-inch

perch from the swirling gutter at
the corner of Eleventh and Broad
way streets in the heart of the busi
ness district.
A messenger boy "hooked" an
other at Seventh and Hill streets
while Patricia Pease found a perch
floundering on the "welcome" mat,
when she opened her beauty shop
at Eighth and Hope.
