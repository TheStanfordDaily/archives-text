# IT'S A RIVER NOW

LOS ANGELES, March 3 (UP).â€”
No longer can the Los Angeles river,
oft likened unto the Powder river
(a mile wide and an inch deep), be
made the butt of joke and song for
Byron Summers, a professional en
durance swimmer, admitted today
the river has what it takes.
Summers dived into the stream
from the Los Feliz Boulevard bridge
and nearly an hour later climbed
out four miles downstream, bleed
ing? battered, exhausted but happy.
Recuperating in receiving hospi
tal, he said:
"It was worse than anything I've
ever done."
