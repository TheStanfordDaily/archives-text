ACCOUNT? NO!
The Editor, Sir:
Fellow students, you arc going to
take accounting. You have heard
some place that a knowledge of the
subject will be an invaluable aid to
you when you emerge into the busi
ness world.
Perhaps, what you have heard is
correct. I cannot speak as to the
merits of the subject as it is taught
in other places. I can only tell you
what I have learned during my two
quarters' WORK in it at Stanford.
Full of Zeal
I, too, entered the lecture room
last fall full of zeal and prepared to
crack this supposedly tough course.
So far, I have failed to crack the
course. Through the good services
of a guardian angel, I have managed
to make the required grades. I
have never felt that the course was
presented to me in such a manner
that by dint of hard labor, I could
master it. From the start, a mess of
facts which you have never before
even suspected, will be thrown at
you. You will be treated as a purely
impersonal object, and left to your
own devices, to sink or swim.
In fact, there is a certain famous
attitude throughout the accounting
department which encourages this
treatment. This attitude is the re
sult of a definite belief. The ac
counting department assumes that
all students enrolled are prospective
accountants. By squeezing all but
the most fit out of the course, they
may be sure to have the cream of
the crop left to become certified pub
lic accountants.
Assumption Wrong
Were this assumption correct their
actions would be commendable.
However, the majority of accounting
students are prospective business
men, not prospective accountants.
The department must realize this,
yet they do not act accordingly.
I do not advise you to take ac
counting, fellow student. If a work
able knowledge were the result of
your labor under the unsympathetic
guidance of your instructors — I
would have no reason to advise you.
Ask any normal accounting student
if he feels that he is deriving all he
should from the course. You will
receive only one answer. By nor
mal, I mean a student like yourself,
not a "whip."
Long Exams
If what I have said doesn't con
vince you, let me cite a few ex
amples of how the course is run.
Last quarter an exam was started at
2 o'clock in the afternoon which
most students did not finish until 7 at
night, which some did not finish un
til 2 the next morning. Yesterday,
at least 16 hours of work was as
signed to us, due tomorrow, along
with an important exam to be given

tomorrow. When a complaint was
made, the instructor advised the
students that they didn't know their
accounting, and could drop the
course if they weren't satisfied.
Last week, lab instructors were
suddenly changed. The new instruc
tor has a different method of teach
ing than his predecessor, and lacks
all semblance of humanity. Conse
quently accounting is intolerable, for
the previous instructor at least used
to admit his ignorance and endeav
ored to help as he could. Our new
instructor uses methods which he
could have learned only in the ring,
tosses tremendous quantities of ma
terial at our heads, gets disgusted
and arrogant when we do not un
derstand.
Don't let yourself in for this
worthless torture, fellow student.
The "School of Hard Knocks" will
be play next to it. Learn your ac
counting in that school, and leave
the course here to the geniuses.
