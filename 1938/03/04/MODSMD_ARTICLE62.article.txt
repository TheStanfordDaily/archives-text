# Survey Says Women Lack Imagination
## 
### 
From a short, private, and very
impromptu survey held recently, it
was proved indirectly that while
women are more romantic than men,
they have smaller imaginations.
The survey was held by a Stanford
woman after she had listened to a
discussion on monetary considera
tions in marriage.
She came away from the discus
sion with an important question un
solved.
"Just how much does it cost mar
ried people to live?" she wanted to
know, and that is the question she
asked friends of hers in her survey.
Most of the women, romantic but
unimaginative, answered that a
married couple should be making
from $150 to $175 a month, with
$1000 put away in the bank. The
majority of men, remembering from
experience that you have to buy
two tickets to shows and things,
thought that married people
should be making $175 to $200 a
month, plus the $1000 in the bank.
Neither the men nor women con
sulted their parents for any first
hand information on the subject.
