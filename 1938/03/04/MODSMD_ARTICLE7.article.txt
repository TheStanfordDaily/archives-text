Wilbur To Speak
President Wilbur will give a short

appointed to the Board by Senator
Stanford in 1891 and is still an ac
tive member.
Seniors will have a special sec
tion reserved for them in Memorial
Church on Wednesday, March 9,
for the observance of Founders'
Day.
The reserved section for seniors

stated. Quad clothes will be worn
to the ceremony, he added.
Closing the program, the Univer
sity choir will sing "How Blest Are
They" by Tschaikowsky.
Classes will be dismissed at 9:45
and 10 o'clock classes will meet at
10:15. Bells will be rung in ac
cordance with this schedule.
First Founders' Day ceremony was
held on May 14, 1891, the anniver
sary of the birth of Leland Stanford
Jr. On that occasion the faculty
and students entrained for Monte
rey, where the program was held.
I>ate Shifted
Following year the commemora
tion was held at Santa Cruz. After
Senator Stanford's death in 1893, the
date was shifted to March 9, the
senator's birthday, and this day has
been observed ever since.
In 1894, Former President Penja
min Harrison delivered the address.
The type of program has varied from
year to year, but it has usually taken
the form of a musical concert. Last
year the San Francisco Symphony
orchestra played.
Foundation Laid
Dr. Jordan, in 1822, laid the foun
dation of the Student Union, and,
in 1923, the program was broadcast
over a 400-meter wave length radio
constructed by the Department of
Electrical Engineering.
The only year in which Senator
Stanford's birthday has not been ob
served was 1905 when the date pre
ceded Mrs. Stanford's death by nine
days, and musical services were
held in commemoration of both.
