Undoubtedly the California Band
will come out with some more of
iis positively hysterical tactics to
rn -ht, to lay the Cal rooters in the
; sles as it has done this year at
\; rious times.
One of those various times was
\ hen U.S.C. came to Berkeley
< irly in the season and the Bear
«' •jylers greeted the Troy team as
K came on the floor with an al-
I red interpretation of the U.S.C.
I'./mn. Julie Bescos, former Troy
! sketball great and now coach of
i ; Trohahes, got slight 1> steamed
(he hand for taking his school
<ig in vain, and said so over the
j tlio.
"he whole U.S.C. squad was
htly griped at it, too, and was
I gin wait for the Bears last week
; I IiOS Angeles. It took the Trojans
10 r games to do it, but in their
»«j rth encounter they really unbut-
I i ed the California outfit. The ac
l is of the band didn't do the Cal
i .m any good, it found, when it got
<. I of its own bailiwick.
Another instance of the band's
<:o;:iedy took place at one of the
!•; nes at Berkeley when Referees
j, yd Leith and Ernie Bailly walked
(.n o the floor. The musical Jack

I.fee," an old gag with the Berke
-1 y boys.
Someone saw that there were
( ii!y two refs, and asked Leith
\ ;at had happened to the third.
1 ith, who could hardly he classed

hat band certainly is making it
popular with the Cal student
1 i y with its hilariously funny

t on for sportsmanship up and
< /n the coast. Bescos had a legi

Cut apart from the band, that
f ie tonight ought to be interest

A other or not California can talk

A dnesday was termed by Coach

( ansive drill was perfection itself.
The Stanford varsity, after a
i uple of ups and downs on an

entaily, it couldn't be better,
'erhaps California is in perfect

i win the game tonight. But if
11 ■ y do it will be an upset, even
li. -ugh they play in their own gym
