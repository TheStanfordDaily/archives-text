The Trojans, minus the services
of Pitcher Joe Gonzales, who was
unbeatable for two seasons, boast a
hard-hitting team with an air-tight
defense. In Alex Petrushkin they
have a winning pitcher who also
packs a punch at the plate. If they
find another hurler to help Petrush
kin on the mound, the Trojans are
expected to give the championship
contenders for a battle for the title.
At U.C.L.A. reports from the south
say that Coach Marty Krug is de
veloping one of the strongest teams
in Bruin history. With perhaps the
hardest hitting team in the loop and
a smooth-working infield, the Bruins
are hoping to find two good pitch
ers to hurl them into championship
contention.
