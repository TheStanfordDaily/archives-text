# Frosh Hoopmen Seek Third Win Over Cal
## 
### 
With two victories over the Cali
fornia frosh already under their
belts, Stanford's yearling basket
ballers will invade the Berkeley gym
tonight fighting to give Coach
Wytze Gorter a clean sweep of the
"Little Big Game" hoop series for
the first time in recent years.
After a slow start, Coach Bill
Higgins' Bearcubs have shown tre
mendous improvement and tonight
rule almost even choices to Aid the
famine of Cub victories, if for no
other reason than a natural home
court advantage.
Papooses Win Two
The Papooses won the first game,
42-20, in easy fashion but in the
second contest, after trailing all the
way, the Cubs jumped into a 45-43
lead with only three minutes left to
play. It was at this point that Mike
Marshall went wild to score four
baskets in less than two minutes
and to sew up the game, 51-48.
Coach Higgins has given his team
a new defense that he thinks will
bottle up the Papooses' under-the
basket plays. The extent of the
new defense is merely moving the
center farther back on defense but
Higgins hopes that by this simple
maneuver the Cubs will be able to
stem the flood of Stanford close-in
shots.
Johnny McGee, tall center, will
play the all-important pivot slot to
night for the Cubs. Flanking him
on the defense will be A1 Derian
and Jack Rogers. Derian is one of
the classiest players the Papooses
have come up across all season and
they are expecting no end of trouble
from him tonight. Rogers is a clev
er ball-handler and smooth floor
man.
Dill Is Captain
Starting at forward for Cal will
be Captain Freeman Dill, a dead
eye shot, and Mortie Macks, posses
sor of a deadly right-hand shot. In
the last game bclween the two

teams both rang up 15 points, Dill
with his aggressiveness and Macks
with his uncanny one-handers.
Stanford is at top shape tonight
for the first time in several weeks.
Don Burness has completely recov
ered from a leg injury and Goiter
is counting on him to turn in his
usual spectacular and effective per
formance at the center spot.
Don Williams, floorman and ball
handler de luxe, will open at one
forward, as he has every game this
season, and Mike Marshall will
team up with him on the front line.
Guards will be Bill Niccolls and
Kenny Davidson. Davidson has
been one of the mainsprings of the
team all season with his steady de
fensive and potent offensive playing,
while Niccolls has no superior on
the squad for hustle and spirit.
The Papooses have won all of
their last 12 games and boast of a
winning streak that extended
through nine straight games. Their
season's record is 16 wins and four
losses.

through nine straight games. Their
season's record is 16 wins and four
losses.
With two victories over the Cali
fornia frosh already under their
belts, Stanford's yearling basket
ballers will invade the Berkeley gym
tonight fighting to give Coach
Wytze Gorter a clean sweep of the
"Little Big Game" hoop series for
the first time in recent years.
After a slow start, Coach Bill
Higgins' Bearcubs have shown tre
mendous improvement and tonight
rule almost even choices to Aid the
famine of Cub victories, if for no
other reason than a natural home
court advantage.
Papooses Win Two
The Papooses won the first game,
42-20, in easy fashion but in the
second contest, after trailing all the
way, the Cubs jumped into a 45-43
lead with only three minutes left to
play. It was at this point that Mike
Marshall went wild to score four
baskets in less than two minutes
and to sew up the game, 51-48.
Coach Higgins has given his team
a new defense that he thinks will
bottle up the Papooses' under-the
basket plays. The extent of the
new defense is merely moving the
center farther back on defense but
Higgins hopes that by this simple
maneuver the Cubs will be able to
stem the flood of Stanford close-in
shots.
Johnny McGee, tall center, will
play the all-important pivot slot to
night for the Cubs. Flanking him
on the defense will be A1 Derian
and Jack Rogers. Derian is one of
the classiest players the Papooses
have come up across all season and
they are expecting no end of trouble
from him tonight. Rogers is a clev
er ball-handler and smooth floor
man.
Dill Is Captain
Starting at forward for Cal will
be Captain Freeman Dill, a dead
eye shot, and Mortie Macks, posses
sor of a deadly right-hand shot. In
the last game bclween the two

teams both rang up 15 points, Dill
with his aggressiveness and Macks
with his uncanny one-handers.
Stanford is at top shape tonight
for the first time in several weeks.
Don Burness has completely recov
ered from a leg injury and Goiter
is counting on him to turn in his
usual spectacular and effective per
formance at the center spot.
Don Williams, floorman and ball
handler de luxe, will open at one
forward, as he has every game this
season, and Mike Marshall will
team up with him on the front line.
Guards will be Bill Niccolls and
Kenny Davidson. Davidson has
been one of the mainsprings of the
team all season with his steady de
fensive and potent offensive playing,
while Niccolls has no superior on
the squad for hustle and spirit.
The Papooses have won all of
their last 12 games and boast of a
winning streak that extended
through nine straight games. Their
season's record is 16 wins and four
losses.
