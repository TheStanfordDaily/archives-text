# Ruggers Prep For Cal Game, U.S.F. Match
## Easy Win Over Dons Tomorrow Expected; Point For Bear Tilt 
### 
Pointing toward their all-import
ant game with California next week
over at Berkeley, Stanford's varsity
ruggers will get a breather tomor
row afternoon when they meet
U.S.F. at 2:30 o'clock in the Stan
ford Stadium, and will play only
hard enough to win in order to be in
tip-top shape for their Big Game.
The Indians are expected to have
little trouble from the Dons tomor
row, but must be at their best in
order to beat the Bears next week
end. U.S.F., in its opening game of
Ihe season, held California to a mere
3-0 victory, but since then has been
beaten badly by every team in the
conference apd has not scored a
point in a league game.
Cal Improved
California, however, is much im
proved over the team that last year
was runner-up to the champion In
dians in the Northern California
Union and P.C.C. races. In Char
lie Wheeler, the Bears have a kicker
that is dangerous from anywhere in
scoring territory. He and Stanford's
Wayne Richardson are expected to
wind up in a kicking duel which
might win for either side.
The Stanford-California game is
all-important for both teams as far
as the California Union and the
P.C.C. races are concerned. In the
latter, Stanford and U.S.C. are tied
for the leadership with one victory
and one tie followed by California
and U.C.L.A.
The Trojans are conceded a vic
tory over the Bruins in their game,
meaning that the winner of the In
dian-Bear tilt will tie with U.S.C.
for the championship, for which a
playoff probably will be held.
Tied in Knot
The California Union race is all
tied up in a knot. If Stanford wins
the Bear game, it is assured of at
least a tie with the leading Univer
sity Club and a championship if the
latter foses tomorrow to the Olym
pic Club. A defeat for the Indians
in the California game will put them
out of the running.
Following the varsity game, Stan
ford's frosh will meet Menlo Jaysec
in the third meeting for the two
teams. Menlo won the first and the
second ended in a scoreless tie. The
Papooses will clash with the strong
Bearcubs next week at Berkeley.

in 1859.
