# Stanford Boxers Split Cal Bouts
## 
### 
Card boxers put a happy ending
on their season last night by revers
ing the adverse decisions of last
week's bouts at Cal, while on the
preceding card, Indian matmen
pinned down their half of Bear op
ponents.
The bouts included a T.K.O. by
Bill Wilber over Cal's Juel Droubay,
ind Stanford's Boyd Carleton took
the count in the second round after
giving Cal's captain a good lacing.
Gallarneau and Saunders in heavy
and light heavy divisions, took their
men easily. Stanford's Captain Mac
Pope, in his last varsity bout, lost
the decision in the eyes of the
judges, but not in the eyes of the
gallery, Cal men included. The de
cision was a great surprise. Jack
Rice, welter, won handily over his j
last week's victor, giving him a good j
drubbing.
Steve Kucseff, wrestling heavy
weight, took a lot of overtime to
flatten his man, but showed up well
in doing it.
