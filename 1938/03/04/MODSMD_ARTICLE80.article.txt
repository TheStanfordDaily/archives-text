### 
Sole survivors of a long and thrill
ing season, Breakers and Alpha Tau
Omega will battle for the Univer- !
sity Intramural Basketball Cham- i
pionship next week. The date has
been tentatively set for Wednesday, (
at 9 o'clock in the Pavilion; a defi
nite time will be posted early next j
week on the intramural bulletin
board in the Encina Gym.
Breakers boast a well-coached ag
gregation, the fourth team in five
years that Harlan Carter has guided |
into the finals. Breakers â€¢ will be
fighting to win this game and take
possession of the rotary trophy,
which is permanently awarded to
any team winning three hoop cham

The probable starting line-up for
the title-defending Breakers will be I
Frank Douglas and Harlan Carter at
forwards; Will Ryan, center; and A1
Alustiza and either Jack Kellogg or I
Bill Paulman, guards.
The A.T.O.'s will probably line up
with Bob Koch and Jack Siefert,
forwards; Ed Hyde, center; Neal
Sinclair and Bob Strom, guards. If
he is recovered from injuries, Jack
Haraway will start at guard for the
A.T.O.
