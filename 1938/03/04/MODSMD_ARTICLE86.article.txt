# Women's Sports in Final Round
## 
### 
The junior women's basketball
team beat the sophomore cagers 18-
10 yesterday and are consequently
headed for first place in the final
round of the women's interclass
hoop competitionâ€”unless the fresh
men, who are playing a steadily im
proving brand of ball, do not cause
an upset.
Next week will see the round-up
of the interclass basketball, and the
completion of the ping-pong and
badminton tournaments. The winter
quarter sports season will end with
a W.A.A. tea on Friday, March 11,
in the lounge of the women's gym,
where the women on the first hoop
teams of each class will receive their
numerals, and the winners of the
ping-pong and badminton tourna
ments will be presented with their
awards.
