EVEN in a planned social order the enjoy
ment value couldn't be greater. Even if
Billy Rose were staging it with a few thousand
chorus girls in bathing suits, it couldn't be
better entertainment.
It's had a build-up all season since Stanford
lost two in a row to U.S.C. and Cal. They ve
had to do it the hard way. It's the fourth of the
winter Big Games. And it's really big with Cal
and Stanford battling for the title in the last
game of the regular season.
Luisetti, Stoefen, and Calderwood will be in
there for the last time seeking a perfect record
of three in a row. And no matter how wonder
ful a team may be here next year or the year
after, a unique three-year basketball cycle will
end tonight.
Of course, Stanford could lose and still have
an even chance for the championship.
But the stage is sel perfectly tonight.
