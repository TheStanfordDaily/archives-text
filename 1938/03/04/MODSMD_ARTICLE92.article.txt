LAST November well over 100 students regis
tered in a University experiment now popu
larly known as "sex" or "marriage."
Limited facilities necessitated cutting the
number of applicants who could enroll and next
week 56 of the senior class will finish Social
Science 120 with a somewhat adequate knowl
edge of the trials and triumphs of married life.
Agitation for such a course started during
the administration of A.S.S.U. President Jim
Reynolds. Rather feeble embers were fanned
into existence by the editorial insistence of
Gordy Frost until a committee of Miss Doyle
and Professors Hilgard, Fagan, and Reynolds
was appointed to investigate needs and possi
bilities.
Finding both, and the consent of Dr. Wilbur,
the committee organized the course to include
the physiological and psychological aspects of
marriage, vocational considerations, legal as
pects of the family, budgeting, consumer edu
cation, and parental education and care of off
spring.
Panels on controversial issues such as birth
control and the place of women have been held
by the class itself, and the various members
of the faculty have provided the lectures.
Yesterday committee members Doyle, Hil
gard, Fagan, and Reynolds gathered at Lagu
nila to discuss more needs and possibilities.
That is, should the course be continued.
Deciding to give students a voice, the com
mittee will hand out next Friday forms on which
the class may rate the course.
Early next quarter when grades are in and
when students can look at the course in per
spective, a bull session will be held to further
determine their feelings.
This much is obvious. The course will not
be repeated in the spring quarter. Next winter
perhaps if student interest warrants it, if the
report of the faculty is favorable, and if finan
cial backing is assured, the course will con
tinue.
Well planned, well organized, and well di
rected, the course has been successful from
all standpoints. Already a lap ahead of most
universities, Stanford should maintain the lead
it has taken.
By all standards, Social Science 120 should
be taken out of the experimental stage and
made a definite part of the school curriculum.
