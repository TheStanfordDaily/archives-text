>>"P)RE-INITIATION," that much-criticized pet
JL of the fraternity system, v/ill be muzzled
next year if Interfraternity Council adopts the
proposal it is now considering.
Under the new plan all houses will hold their
pre-initiation activities in the same week, and
will make detailed reports to the Dean of Men.
Penalties will be provided for fraternities that
insist on administering their programs with
more enthusiasm than intelligence.
No one, not even the grad who keeps a shat
tered paddle over the mantel of his den, should
be shocked at the proposed change. It is a
little surprising, in fact, that the fraternities
didn't adopt it at the same time they decided
kidnaping and intimidation were not essential
to rushing.

Pre-Initiation is simply that well-known leop
i ard, Hell Week, with its spots retouched. Most
fraternity men consider it a holdover from the
days when coonskins were in flower. Its ex
istence today provides a nice example of the
way an institution hangs on after its death, like
withered ivy on a wall.
Originally started to strenghen by contrast
the mystic bonds, Hell Week fell in with evil
companions and developed into a juvenile
melee. Sophomores regard it as a lineal de
scendant of the Inquisition. Most fraternity men
consider it boring, distinctly inferior for enter
tainment to a second-feature movie.
In this enlightened age, it is a little incongru
ous to see neophytes sjagger into class looking
like Spartan boys with shirts full of foxes. It
is a little annoying to go home and be swept
off the stairs by a pledge descending like an
express elevator because he lost his feet try
ing to go down backwards.
The new plan is practical and well designed.
Even if it were not, it would be an improve
ment. Hell Week is a nasty sort of a pet. And
in our society only movie stars are privileged
to keep unconventional pets with nasty dis
positions. Fraternity men are not movie stars.
