COURAGE
COUPLE of interesting events occurred Wednes
day, interesting becaasc they happened in Ger
many and Russia, and under a form of government
which docs not usually permit such things to happen.
In Berlin the Rev. Martin Nicmoellcr, severest in
ternal critic of the Nazi regime, was released from
prison upon conclusion of his secret trial at (he hands
of the government.
In Moscow an old man named Nicholas Krestinsky
had the temerity to stand up in Josef Stalin's latest
treason trial and deny that he was guilty.
For nations under dictatorship, both these events
arc quite fantastic. Never yet has anyone—except in
exile—said that. Russia's peculiar form of justice was
wrong; only from Dr. Schacht has there been open
opposition to Hitler, and then only as regards Nazi
economics. In both these countries, very few men are
left, who dare to tell the truth.
But Martin Niemoeller has, and he has carried his
case to the highest, courts in Germany and onto most
of the front pages of the world; and Nicholas Krestin
sky has, and from the sounding-board of the Moscow
courtroom he too has broadcast his message far beyond
ihe borders of his iron-bound land.
Of course, Niemoeller was released "into the hands
of the secret police"; and Krestinsky, evidently giving
way under pressure, yesterday recanted his denial;
and Niemoeller, if the latent fanaticism in his sermons
is any indication, may in time come around to an ac
cord with Nazi theology; and Krestinsky, if he was not
facing a death sentence before, certainly is now.
But as symbols of truth, here and now, in this day
and in this age, no government, no firing squad, can
destroy their significance.
Whatever the future may bring for them, it will be
enough for Martin Niemoeller to know that he has
stood against Hitler; and on Nicholas Krestinsky his
tory will bestow an immortality time cannot erase.
To a world plunging ever deeper into the strange
darkness of dictatorship they have shown a courage
that is rarely matchcd. They have told the truth.
