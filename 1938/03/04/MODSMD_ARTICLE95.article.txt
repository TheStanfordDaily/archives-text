# GOIN' MY WAY

### 
Vt/ITH finals coming up—they arc, you know—most
people aren't too interested in books. In books,
that is, not directly connected with their courses.
But there arc some people who will want to
get away from it all for a few hours before those dras
tic days, and, maybe, read something entertaining.
And there arc people—really there arc—who read
books during Spring Vacation.
Wc like Hemingway's stuff. You have heard things
about Hemingway, for and against him, for years, but
you may or may not have read him. If you don't mind
having your emotions played around with a bit, and
if you don't mind reading, "Breakfast was good. I had
four beers and six scotches. Bill didn't drink," stuff,
try him.
His style is pure and direct, very direct. He fills
his novels with short, clipped sentences of dialogue
and keeps his exposition at a minimum, but the effect
he gives is greater than if he had, by using exposition,
explained everything that was happening to his char
acters. His books arc smooth, and swiftly read, and you
would think that they would be easy to write, that
this smooth stufT would pour from his pen. It doesn't.
Louis Brown, the novelist, says that Hemingway is
the hardest worker he knows. In all the years Hem
ingway has been writing, he has never learned to mas
ter his own style naturally. He has to slave over il,
choosing each word carefully and then crossing it out
and putting in another and better one. Because he
crosses out so many words, his first-draft manuscripts
arc almost impossible to read.
♦ * ♦ *
IN SPITE of the fact that he is an ex-newspaper re
porter and was a war correspondent, in Italy and
Spain during the World War, he never writes his
novels and short stories on a typewriter. He works on
a schedule, trying to finish a chapter a week.
His best and most famous book is, "Farewell to
Arms." It is a war-time story taking place chiefly in
Italy. The plot and style are Hemingway at his best.
The ending should leave you bowled over emotionally
for at least 10 minutes.
His first novel, "The Sun Also Rises," is his next
best, we believe. Stay away from his books about bull
fighting and Africa. They are good for practically
nothing but to show that Hemingway is a lover of
nature-in-the-raw. His short stories, if you don't read
too many of them all at once, are good. If you have
read the stuff he used to write for "Esquire," ignore
it. It wasn t the Hemingway we know and like.
The major criticism of Hemingway has been that,
while he does portray his characters well, he always
writes ?<hout people who haven't very much on the
plus side of the intelligence ledger. This is true par
ticularly of his latest novel, "To Have and Have Not,"
but we recommend it.
The tag-line always applied to Hemingway is. "He's
i realist. But we like to read about things besides the
birds :tfml the bees. <Tat|ues.

IN SPITE of the fact that he is an ex-newspaper re
porter and was a war correspondent, in Italy and
Spain during the World War, he never writes his
novels and short stories on a typewriter. He works on
a schedule, trying to finish a chapter a week.
His best and most famous book is, "Farewell to
Arms." It is a war-time story taking place chiefly in
Italy. The plot and style are Hemingway at his best.
The ending should leave you bowled over emotionally
for at least 10 minutes.
His first novel, "The Sun Also Rises," is his next
best, we believe. Stay away from his books about bull
fighting and Africa. They are good for practically
nothing but to show that Hemingway is a lover of
nature-in-the-raw. His short stories, if you don't read
too many of them all at once, are good. If you have
read the stuff he used to write for "Esquire," ignore
it. It wasn t the Hemingway we know and like.
The major criticism of Hemingway has been that,
while he does portray his characters well, he always
writes ?<hout people who haven't very much on the
plus side of the intelligence ledger. This is true par
ticularly of his latest novel, "To Have and Have Not,"
but we recommend it.
The tag-line always applied to Hemingway is. "He's
i realist. But we like to read about things besides the
birds :tfml the bees. <Tat|ues.
Vt/ITH finals coming up—they arc, you know—most
people aren't too interested in books. In books,
that is, not directly connected with their courses.
But there arc some people who will want to
get away from it all for a few hours before those dras
tic days, and, maybe, read something entertaining.
And there arc people—really there arc—who read
books during Spring Vacation.
Wc like Hemingway's stuff. You have heard things
about Hemingway, for and against him, for years, but
you may or may not have read him. If you don't mind
having your emotions played around with a bit, and
if you don't mind reading, "Breakfast was good. I had
four beers and six scotches. Bill didn't drink," stuff,
try him.
His style is pure and direct, very direct. He fills
his novels with short, clipped sentences of dialogue
and keeps his exposition at a minimum, but the effect
he gives is greater than if he had, by using exposition,
explained everything that was happening to his char
acters. His books arc smooth, and swiftly read, and you
would think that they would be easy to write, that
this smooth stufT would pour from his pen. It doesn't.
Louis Brown, the novelist, says that Hemingway is
the hardest worker he knows. In all the years Hem
ingway has been writing, he has never learned to mas
ter his own style naturally. He has to slave over il,
choosing each word carefully and then crossing it out
and putting in another and better one. Because he
crosses out so many words, his first-draft manuscripts
arc almost impossible to read.
