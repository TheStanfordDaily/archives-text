# CAMPUS OPINION
## MISS MARGARET AGAIN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Apparently Miss Margaret has
judged in favor of Harvard by at- |
tending one of its formals. It is
asked if she has ever attended a j
Harvard football game? And if so,
did she notice the apathy of the stu
dent body, the cultural lack of in- I
terest in the trimming the Yales ]
were giving the Harvards?
But then Harvard is not always so !
cultured and so subdued—once a j
year the majority of the students
have their little riot, tipping over !
trolley cars and overturning auto- I
mobiles in the public square. Such
is an excusable delivery found in ;
cultured gentlemen, even though j
the law fails to excuse 20 or 30 of l
the students from jail.
If during the football week-end,
Miss Margaret heard no conversa
tion of the tremendous "stinker"
the Cabots gave for their niece or
the brawl the boys attended at one
of the fashionable girls' schools
about Boston Common, il is either
because she chose for her friends
the "ultra-cultured" gentlemen who
couldn'l be bothered rehashing just
another week-end debauchery, or she
favored the company whose Puritan
ancestors had for generations never
permitted themselves any excesses.
Thus we cannot understand why
Miss Margaret insists on taking the
part of our weaker Eastern broth
ers who, after four years of wean
ing on orgies, accents, and teas, do
graduate but somewhat emasculinc.
We wish you would give Stanford
another chance.

A notebook with an entire quar
ter's work is a hard thing to lose
before finals. Someone picked up
mine by mistake from a table in
front of the card catalogue in the
library last Tuesday noon. I'm no
average-raiser, but I do have to
pass my courses. Will the finder
take time out to contact me?
