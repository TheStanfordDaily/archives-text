# Fields, Raye Disappointing In Filmusical
## 
### 
"The Big Broadcast of 1938," now
playing at the Stanford Theater, is a
| poor excuse for a musical comedy
! because of the thin plot and inferior
| acting.
W. C. fields, as the millionaire
owner of a new streamlined trans
■ atlantic ship, who knows nothing
! about sailing, continually gets into
j trouble. The things Mr. Fields is
j forced to do are so fantastic that
i they cease to be funny.
Martha Raye as Mr. Fields'
daughter gives a bad performance
i in her own loud way.
However, there are some good
| points about the picture. The
j vaudeville acts intended as enter
tainment on board ship feature Tito
! Guizar, Mexican singer, and Kirsten
Flagstad. Both of them arc excel
! lent.
The act tracing the history of ball
j room dancing from the waltz of
1 1880, through Black Bottom, the
i Charleston, Trucking ahd a modern
1938 version of the waltz is very
I well done. The main theme is the,
| piece, "The Waltz Lives On."
j The vaudeville in the picture was
J excellent but the show is dragged
! down by the low level of plot and
i acting.
There is a first-class Mickey
j Mouse cartoon in technicolor, called
; "Hawaiian Holiday" with Donald
j Duck in a hula-hula skirt and Pluto
! playing hide-and-seek with a
troublesome starfish.
