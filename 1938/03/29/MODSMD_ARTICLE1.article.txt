## Rebels Near Sea 
### BILL MILLIS 
Several pages were turned rap
idly yesterday in what Spanish In
surgent Generalissimo Francisco
Franco has called "the last chapter
of the civil war," as Rebel troops
continued their advance into Cata
lonia along a 130-mile front and
captured Lerida, former general
headquarters for all the Loyalist
armies.
At their most advanced posi
tions, the Rebels are now less
than miles from the sea coast,
and only XI miles from Barce
lona. temporary republican capi
tol of 1.500.000 from which the
United State embassy yesterday
withdrew.
Franco's radio claimed that a mo
torized insurgent army entered Le
rida without firing a shot, a short,
time after Barcelona announced
that all Republican troops and 40.000
civilians had been evacuated. II
Duce has warned the wavering
French Popular Front cabinet of
Leon Blum against sending any aid
to the Loyalists, who now appear to
he more disorganized than a yeqr
ago last November, when Rebels
marched upon but did not enter
Madrid.
