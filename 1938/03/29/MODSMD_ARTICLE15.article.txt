# Spring Play Schedule Given Drastic Slash
## 
### 
Because of too much "tcmpus fußit" in backstage activity last quarter,
the Spcech and Drama Division spring program has been slashed to in
clude two major productions and only one or two Little Theater projects,
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett, division head, said yesterday.
"The student actors and actresses were spending entirely too much
time in our heavy rehearsal and performance schedule," Dr. Bassett said.

♦"And not only that, but the pace of
staging and costuming each play was
pretty strenuous.
'So- Mr. Lange, who returned to
replace Mr. Stevens as director this
spring, agreed with me to ease up
a little."
The mystery melodrama, ''Kind
Lady," which just crawled under the
wire in the winter schedule, has
been definitely set for April 13, 14,
15, and 16, and boosted from work
shop status to the stellar brackets
and production in the Memorial Hall
I theater. It is directed by H. Miles
j Heberer.
Director Gordon C. Lange will
! jockey the dark horse which comes
I down the stretch sometime in May.
I Several plays are now up for con-
I sideration, but no selection has been
I clinched, according to Dr. Bassett.
Dates and scripts for the two mi
] nor fill-ins of the spring seasons
! are also still hanging fire. Dr. Bas
-1 sett said. But the public will be ad-
I mitted free of charge, he thinks.
