# Campus Pooches Banned Fraternity Dogs Sent Home
## 
### 
All Stanford living group dogs
have been forced to leave the cam
pus as a result of an order issued by
the Comptroller's Office.
There were seven fraternity
owned dogs on the campus, and they
have all been sent away. The order
came last quarter during finals week.
Assistant Comptroller A. L. Trow
bridge gave several reasons for ban
ishing the dogs. The main reason
was the continuous risk ol the dogs
getting rabies and biting someone,
and that the dogs were unsanitary
generally.
The more or less continual fight
ing of the dogs around the Quad and
in the Library was given as one of
the reasons for banishing them. And
some of the professors thought they
were being picked on by the dogs,
which would occasionally "molest '
them on the Quad and disrupt their
classes,
Then while the students frequently
found it very diverting when do√üs
would wander into classes, yawn,
and w*T<Hpr out the Administration

j considered that one of the reasons
| ihey should be removed.
The dogs were taken away during
spring vacation. Alpha Sig's "Sig-
which was taken fen Pasadena
by Tom Fleming, was the oldest
canine resident on the Farm. He
had been here three years.
A.T.O.'s "Tammany" was the next
oldest resident, living here for two
years. S.A.E.'s "Napoleon" has been
taken home by Frank Lippman, and
Chi Psi's Irish Setter, "Duke," was
taken to Pasadena by his master,
Foster Markolf. D.U.'s police dog.
"Hester, here for one year, was
taken by his owner, Henry Kaiser,
to Oakland.
The Kappa Alphas sent their Bos
lon bull. "Kappie," to friends in New
Mexico. They had had him for five
months. The Betas' eight-month
"old Great Dane was sent to Altadena.
The rule banning the dogs forbade
any living group, member, or em
ployee of a living group to have a
dog on the campus. None of the
sororities or dormitories owned d' l^.
