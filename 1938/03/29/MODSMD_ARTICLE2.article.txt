# F.R. Plan Wins
## 
### 
Reorganization of the executive
branch of the U. S. government has
been advocated by Presidents for
several decades. Yesterday Presi
dent Roosevelt won a sweeping
Congressional victory when the Sen
ate passed and sent to the House
his government reorganization bill.
The Administration's success,
after a close final vote of 49 to 42,
marked a defeat for the powerful
hi-party coalition that last year
blocked bis Supreme Court en
largement plan.
The Supreme Court yesterday up
held the legality of the registration
and penalty features of the 1935
utility holding company act, but the
decision did not hint at the court's
position on the so-called "death sen
tence" provisions of the act, which
was not an issue.
