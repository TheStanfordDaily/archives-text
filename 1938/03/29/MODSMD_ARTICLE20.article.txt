# Colonel House Dies in Sleep
## Quiet Funeral Planned For Wartime Figure 
### 
NEW YORK. March 28 (UP).—
Col. Edward M. House, one of the
men behind the scenes of American
participation in the World War, died
in his sleep today. He had been ill
of neuritis and pleurisy. He would
have been 80 years old July 26.
Because he wanted no "fuss" at
his funeral, there will be no serv
ices here. A train will take his
body out of New York tomorrow for
burial at Houston, Tex., his birth
place, where the only service will be
a private one at the cemetery. Dr.
Paul E. Sheldon, who attended him,
attributed the Colonel's death to
advanced age.
Col. House's desire for post-mor
tem privacy was typical of his life.
He preferred to operate in secrecy,
with men of world influence, in at
tempting to shape the destinies of
nations.
His reticence left behind many
mysteries, despite publication of his
"private papers." Much of his work
never was committed to paper.
