# Daily Has kittens During Vacation
## 
### 
Stanford Daily writers back
from their vacations yesterday
found that the Daily shack had
been changed last week from
a newspaper office to a mater
nity ward.
A mother cat got into the
space under the floor of the
shack some time last week and
gave birth to six kittens. The
yowling of the strong-lunged,
hungry kittens led to their dis
covery. The mother cat was
dead, but the offspring were all
alive. Their eyes were still
closed.
Two of them were orange,
two grey, and two a nonde
script brown. They were taken
down to the pound. They were
about two days old.
