# Prom Bids Held To 500 Limit
## Tickets Go Fast; Door Sale Unlikely 
### 
With less than half of the bids for
Friday's Senior Prom still available.
Committee Chairman A1 Hyman
announced last night that the self
imposed limit of 500 tickets will not
be exceeded.
Eddie Duchin and his 14-piece
orchestra are scheduled to play for
the dance, which will be formal.
Duchin has made arrangements of
several Gaieties hits and will play
them at the prom.
"The magic piano fingers of ra
dio" will be accompanied by two
vocalistsâ€”"Little" Patricia Norman
and "Song Stylist" Stanley Worth.
Sometimes called "Society's Fa
vorite," Duchin's music is best
known for rhythmic style and
sweet syncopation on the piano.
Bids for the Prom, which will be
held from 1 to 9 o'clock in the Pa
vilion, are on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office for $3.50. Because of heavy
advance sale there is, according to
Hyman, a chance that no tickets will
be sold at the door on Friday night.
Working with Hyman are: Bill
Allen, decorations and lighting; Bob
Garretson, pavilion and policing;
Kay Kloster. 'patrons and checking
arrangements; Margaret Loud, tick
ets and posters; and John Rice, pub
licity.
