# Conference Adopts New Vote Plan
## Nominating Committee For Women Okayed; Caucuses Retained 
### 
Overruling Lagunita Court's
1 strenuous objections,. Women's Con
ference decided at the end of last
quarter, by a vote of 19 to 13, in
favor of a nominating committee to
select women to go on the ballots
in spring elections.
Dinged in Conference's last meet0
ing winter quarter was the plan to
abolish caucuses in women's living
groups. Conference representatives
voted in favor of continuing as at
present, 24 to 4.
Up in February
The plan for a nominating com
mittee, to consist of seven senior
women, was brought before Con
ference on February 28 and was
discussed by women's living groups
in house meetings that night.
j' cause house executive commit
tees in Union and Roble felt that
:ne plan was not yet ready for pres
entation in house meetings, women
in these houses were not informed
of the plan until after it had been
passed by Conference at the next
meeting.
Lagunita Objects
Women in the six Lagunita casas
voted unanimously against the plan.
The vote in those Union units in
which it was presented in house
meeting was split.
j By the time the question of cau
cuses came up women's living
groups were thoroughly aroused,
and Conference decided to continue
them by an overwhelming vote.
Advantages pointed out by the
pro side of the Row-sponsored plan
for a nominating committee were
j that it would assure the best wom
en being nominated for offices and
j that it would help to end the tradi
tional Hall-Row split.
Called Undemocratic
Objections brought out by the
j co.i side were that there was no cer
tainty that seven senior women
would know the best material in the
junior and sophomore classes, that
it was undemocratic, giving women
sponsored by the committee an edge
over those running independently,
and that it would not alleviate the
Hall-Row split where it was most
felt, in the actual voting.
It was also pointed out that the
plan had been passed on before
women had had sufficient time to
discuss it and suggest possible
changes.
As it stands at present there will
be a nominating committee, arid
there will be caucuses.
