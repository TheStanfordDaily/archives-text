## Nominating Committee For Women Okayed; Caucuses Retained 
### 
Overruling Lagunita Court's
1 strenuous objections,. Women's Con
| ference decided at the end of last
I quarter, by a vote of 19 to 13, in
j tavor of a nominating committee to
[select women to go on the ballots
i in spring elections.
Dinged in Conference's last meet
j ing winter quarter was the plan to
| abolish cauci\s°s »n women's living
groups. Conference representatives
I voted in favor of continuing as at
| pro-ent, 24 to 4.
Up in February
The plan for a nominating com
mittee. to consist of seven seni' r
women, was brought before Con
ference on February 28 and was
'lis ussed by women's living groups
in house meetings that night.
j' cause house executive commit
tees in Union and Roble felt that
:ne plan was not yet ready for pres
entation in house meetings, women
in these houses were not informed
of the plan until after it had been
passed by Conference at the next
meeting.
Lagunita Objects
V'omen in the ix Laguni'a cas s
j voted unanimously against the plan.
! The vote in those Union units in
i which it was presented in house
! meeting was split.
j By the time the question of cau
| cuses came up women's living
j;.'ioi.ips were 'horoughly aroused,
and Conference decided to continue
>h°m by an overwhelming vote.
Advantages pointed out by the
pro side of the Row-sponsored plan
j for a nominating r.'-jmittee were
j that it would assure the best wom
en being nominated f or offices and
j that it would help to end the tradi
p.onal Hall-Row split.
Called Unrieru cratic
| Objections brought out by the
j co.i side were that there was no cer
| tainty that seven senior women
I would know the best material in the
junior and sophomore classe, thai
it was undemocratic, giving women
sponsored by the committee an edge
over those running independently,
and that it would not alleviate the
Hall-Row split where it wr»s most
felt, in the actual voting.
It was also pointed out that, the
plan had been passed on b fore
women had had sufficient time to
discuss it and suggest possible
changes.
As it stands at present there will
be a nominating committee, arid
there will be caucuses.
