# Finals Cause Weight Loss Stanford Avoirdupois Drops
## 
### 
Farm .students lost 5848 pounds
during the last finals period, accord
ing to .an estimate made by the Bu
reau of Educational Surveys in New
York.
Cramming for finals was the cause
of this mass loss in weight, but the
causes for the cramming lie as much
with the professors and textbooks
as they do with the students, the
Bureau stated.
It says that professors don't pro
vide their classes with a sufficiently
clear view of the total course or
give them sufficient review, and
that textbooks frequently lack con-

] tinuity or organization and force the
student to cram at finals time in a
desperate attempt to understand
them.
The third reason for cramming,
the Bureau said, is that 52 per cent
of all students can never become
successful students, and would never
pass courses without the use of pre
pared outlines and other aids.
The Bureau arrived at the weight
loss figure by multiplying an average
two-pound loss, reported by a repre
' sentative group, by 90 per cent of
I Stanford students who cram for
i finals.
