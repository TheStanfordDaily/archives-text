# Philosophy Subject Of Radio Talk
## 
### 
Philosophy is one of the most prac
tical of the sciences, Professor Kurt
F. Bernhardt, of the Germanics de
partment of Stanford University, said
today in advance of a radio talk to
be broadcast next Monday evening
at 9:15 o'clock from Station KGO.
Philosophy is practical, he said,
because man by nature is a philoso
pher, a rational or metaphysical ani
mal. Man, he said, cannot escape the
practical implications of his own
thinking, and philosophy as a .sci
ence is necessary to give unity to his
thought.
