Stanford fraternity men recently by
Campus Officer Gordon Davis, fol
lowing the arrest March 13 of a
man charged with stealing from fra
ternity houses.
The following day an alleged im
postc r was arrested at the Sigma
Chi house on the charge of passing
had checks.
.Midnight Chase
The man arrested for burglary
was captured after a midnight chase
across the campus after he had taken
articles from the Sigma Chi, the
Delta Upsilon, and the Delta Chi
houses. He gave his name as Har
old Hanafield.
Discovered in the Delta Chi
bouse by Perry Chissuin, he ex
plained that he was a Sigma Chi
who had mistaken the house and
xhibited a pin of that fraternity
missed earlier in the evening.
Chissum was unconvinced, and
Hanafield bolted out of the house
and across the campus.
Posse Pursues
The Delta Chis called Oflicer Davis,
and forming a posse gave pursuit.
Hanafield was surrounded at the old
aviation field back of Branner Hall
and was captured by Officer Davis.
Just before capture he flung the
stolen articles away from him. A
wrist watch and $15 in cash could
not be found.
Hanafield was sentenced to 30
days in the county jail and two
years probation by the county su
perior court. It, is believd that he
was not connected with other Cam
pus robberies since he arrived re
cently from Texas.
Trapped by Ilitual
The day after the Hanafield chase,
a man arrived at the Sigma Chi
house posing as a member of the
fraternity from a North Carolina
chapter. He persuaded one of the
members to endorse his check for
$5 and cashed it at the bookstore.
Fraternity members became suspi
cious when he showed an ignor
ance of ritual and signs.
Checking with the Berkeley chap
ter they found that a man of simi
lar description had recently passed
a bad check there. Police were
notified and the man, who gave his
name as Larry Gunter, was arrest
ed. The amount of the bad check
was recovered, and the prisoner was
turned over to the Berkeley police
and sentenced to 50 days in the Ber
keley jail.
