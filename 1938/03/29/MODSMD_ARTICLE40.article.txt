# Industrial Meet Held on Campus
## Business Executives Attend 22 Sessions 
### 
Shortly after Lagunita's twitter
ing inmates flew their coop for the
spring holiday, 1-40 business excu
tives from big corporations up and
down the Pacific Coast flocked into
the women's dormitory, bag and
baggage, for a week's stay.
An industrial relations conference,
organized by Director Paul Eliel of
the industiral relations division of
the Graduate School of Business,
brought the visitors to the campus.
First such conference to be held
in the West, the week long seminar
won the unqualified enthusiasm a'
those participating, Mr. Eliel re
ports. It will be held annually here
after.
Sumner H. Slichter, Harvard Bus
iness School professor of business
economics, whose works are known
to Stanford economics undergrad
uates, was one of the principal con
ference leaders and speakers. He
discussed the future of industrial
relations in the light of collective
bargaining. Collective bargaining, he
noted, is having a rigiditying effect
on wages and thus tends to discour
age investment, to the eventual dis
advantage of labor as well as of in
dustry.
In all, 22 sessions of the confer
ence were held, with the place of
labor in industry a paramount topic
in nearly all of them. Professors
E. K. Strong, Jr., and Theodore
Kreps of the Business School, Al
moin E. Roth, former comptroller,
Robert Littler, '25, and Wililam G.
Storie, '26, were Stanford men who
took leading parts in the conference.
