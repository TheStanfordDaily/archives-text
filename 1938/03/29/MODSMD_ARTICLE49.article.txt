ONE0 NE of the greatest teams ever
to represent Stanford in ath
letic fields came to a glorious end
over the vacation period of The
Daily. The varsity basketball team,
of which four of the first five play
ers completed (heir collegiate com
petition, outclassed a fine Oregon
five to win the Coast Conference
for the third straight yeax\
The Webfoot squad came down
here with a reputation for speed—
they reportedly had intentions of
running the Stanford team ragged.
They did very well for the first half
of each game, but their speed was
the cause of their own undoing.
Three sparkling guards—Anet, Jo
hansen, and Pavalunas—kept their
speed throughout the games, but
the center, Wintermute, and For
wards Gale and Silver . couldn't
stick with the fast little guards in
the second halves.
The Cards showed sustained
vpeed throughout both games
that was something worth watch
ing. A team that averaged better
tiian (i-2 at virtually all times,
that varsity was one of the fast
est tilings the coaches of this
country have ever seen. Height
and speed like that tend to win
championships.
The old master, Captain Hank
Lviisetti, cut the same eyebrow that
was injured in the first U.S.C. game
here (when he bumped heads with
Gail Goodrich), in a collision with
an Oregon man in the first contest,
tiut it didn't slow him down. He
was the fastest man on the floor in
the first half of the second game, a
period which included the fastest
basketball Coach Jojm Bunn had
ever seen, he said.
Whether Euisetti's contract with
Paramount will turn into some
thing is entirely problematical.
Angelo plans to go into the movie
business with an .open mind, and
i! he turns into a new Robert Tay
lor it would be slightly difficult to
turn down the sort of cash that
JiHm !il\c Taj lor have earned in
picture.
If Hank just gets by with his first
opus he still has a job at home and
nothing lost. In addition, he'll have
30,000 doughnuts for a nest egg,
which wouldn't break anyone's
hei.rt.
The tentative schedule for pro
duct irn of the picture includes a
three-week period of script-writ
ing, in which Hank will have a part,
and then about a month for the
camera work. Possibility that the
fi'm v ill be released some time
around next basketball season is
Air horn remote, although it might
come out sooner.

r jPIIE football team opens spring
practice today, with a fairly
favorable outlook on tap for next
fall's team. The backfield, to put it
in a breath, should be as dangerous
;:s any on the coast, the only first
string loss b"ing Jim Coffis. At that,
Collis, popularly considered the reg
ular lclt half last fall, played few
er minutes throughout the season
than did Pete Fay, who returns at
the p.'i.'itioii. Coflis had 202 minutes,
Fay 21 a.
'I lie line prospects are not quite
as bright, although there arc great
potentialities, /agar and Ander
sen at tackles, and the returning
Jack Clark. Hill Willard, Bill Mc-
Efroy, Irv Cummings, Andy
Stojkovich and others at end
may tisrsi into something pretty
good. The guard situation is the
toughest obstacle, t ince Matthews
and Ferko have left.. There is
enough material for the jobs, and
what Tl.ornhill can do wiih the
men he has is liable to make or
break the team.
California, having lost the heart
and soul of one of the greatest
teams she ever had, should not be
a threat this fall. U.C.L.A. is just
U.C.L.A., but U.S.C. — now there's
something to worry about. You
can't tell about Oregon up north —
they had a hot and cold soph outfit
last year.
The schedule is very favorable to
Stanford this year, with only three
games away from home, U.C.L.A.,
Oregon. and Cal. The first four
games, three of them conference, are
to be played at home. The final
ga no brings Dartmouth here, No
vember 2(>. The Green is touted as
the best team in the east this year,
which takes in a lot of territory.
