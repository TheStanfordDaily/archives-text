## Chief Tiny Calls Fifty To Practice Preview of '38 Roller Pleases Thornhill; Slow Warm-up Set 
### 
Spring is here, and this afternoon
approximately 50 aspiring candidates
will return to the'football fold to
greet Big Chief Tiny Thornhill in the
first day of spring practice.
"We'll break them in easy," laughs
Tiny, "stiffen 'em up for the first
lew days, and then work them into
good physical shape in about three
weeks."
Intimating that prospects seem
better now than they did last year
for the quarter training period,
Tiny looks pleased over the turn
out. Spring sports such as track and
baseball are still in full swing, and
at least 25 more men, mostly from
the freshman ranks, are expected to
swell the total turnout to nearly 80
by April 25.
Guard, Center Weak
Both guard positions and the cen
ter spot are considered the v/eakest
spots by â–  the coaching faction. At
guard, Leo Ferko leaves a vacancy
that will be hard to fill, while let
terman Bob Matthews also will not
return. Bob Dak.in and Jack Wal
ton look good for these two jpots,
while freshman Jake Thompson may
prove to be the material needed to
aid Tony Calvelli fill the center spot
vacated by Louis Tsoutsouvas.
The key fullback position is espe
cially strong, with two veterans and
three newcomers ready for action.
Bill Paulman, near - hero of this
year's Big Game encounter, will be i
in uniform again, with Jim Groves j
also available. Hampton Poole, who
starred lor the Cal frosh two years
ago, is a third bulwark who should
go places if he lives up to his pre- i
vious record.
Two more big boys who will try j
for this backfield spot are John
Casey, a J.C. transfer, and Norm
Standlee. Casey is strong and fast
and big things are predicted for j
him. Standlee, mainstay of this year's |
edition of the ''little red machine," |
will bear watching, and with the:
added months of experience may'
prove a surprise next fall.
One or more of thetre men will be 1
shifted to fill the holes left at guard i
and center or perhaps to other back- |
field posts, if expected weaknesses in ,
the line hold true, according to pres- I
ent coaching predictions. This would J
leave a still strong contingent at full, j
Clark Returns
Jack Clark, star end of two years '
ago who saw no action last season |
due to an early injury, will be out
to fill the vacancy left by Captain
Grant Stone. Neil Rasmussen and
Irv Cummings, both of whom saw,
plenty of action during the past grid
season, and Hugh Gallarneau, Farm
light-heavy boxing champ, will be
vieing for the other post.
Pete Fay may fill the shoes of the
great Jimmy Coffis capably, if last
year's performances are repeated,
and aiding him in the other.back
field positions will be Al Alustiza,
Bill Kirsch, and frosh Thor Peter
son, among a host of other promising
candidates.
No signal work will be started
until April 25, when the players now
competing in track and baseball will
be free to turn out. From that date
until the end of the practices, Tiny
intends to keep things going strong.
With the longer, more leisurely
training period, the weak and strong
points of the squad can be noted,
according to Tiny, and by the time
the fall season rolls around the!
coaching staff will know exactly how i
things stand.
Assistant Coach Ben Winkelman '
is the only member of the coaching
stafl available for the first few weeks
of practice. Jim Lawson, Bobby
Grayson, and Harry Shipkey, the
remaining men on the staff, will all
report {is soon as the spring sports
are over.
