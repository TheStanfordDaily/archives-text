# Frosh Nine Plays Today
## 
### 
Frosh diamondeers swing into
their opening game of the spring
quarter this afternoon, meeting
Mission High's outfit on the fresh
man diamond at 3 o'clock.
Scheduled to begin for the frosh
in the pitching spot is "Cootie"
Thompson, with a record of one
| defeat and two victories behind him.
The other probable member of the
starting battery will be Purkitt, who
is moving up as a sei'ious first string
threat.
Fighting for the beginning spot at
first are "Ush" Tfleker and Harland
Harbke. Tucker's superior stick

work probably will give him the nod.
The trio of Monte Pl'yl, Elt Boone,
and Herb Bull should break into
the starting nine at second, third,
and short, respectively. "Cookie"
South is a dangerous contender for
any of these positions, however.
The starters in the field are un
decided, with Howie Ruth probably
teaming with "Swede" Johannessen
and Jimmy McCloud.
Practice the last week before the
holidays saw the squad rounding
into crisp form.
Proposed off-schedule games in
tended for the spring vacation were
canceled due to the threat of rain.
