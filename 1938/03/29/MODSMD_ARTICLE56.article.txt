# Hoopmen End Golden Era; Hollywood Signs Luisetti
## Cards Annex Third Straight P.C.C. drown 
### 
Coach John Bunn's Golden Era
of Stanford basketball has ended.
The 1938 combination of Cardinal
hoopsters, led by Captain Hank Lui
setti, the greatest Ail-American ever
to pound a pavilion, first topped
Southern Division standings, then
went on to bring home to Stanford
the third consecutive Coast Cham
pionship.
And in this, the last season for
Captain Hank, the Card All-Ameri
can marked up a new world's rec
ord scoring mark of 1596 points for
four years of play, besides breaking
his own Southern Division one
season scoring record.
New Loop Marks
The old world mark of 1531 was
broken by Luisetti in the third game
of the Cal-Stanford series. Hank's
own record of 208 for one season of
conference play was knocked over
by his new mark of 232 points.
The Golden Era has ended because
Coach Bunn was recently chosen to
succeed retiring Dean of Men George
B. Cuiver, and probably will
riot continue his coaching duties.
No definite decision has been made
as yet, however.
The Cards played a season of bas
ketball which, if placed on a chart,
would resemble steel sales in 1914.
Starting slow, John Bunn's Laugh
ing Boys played under orders to de
liberately "not push." The mentor
was trying to avoid the late-season
slump which hit Stanford last year.
Missed Slump
And that slump was missed. It
appeared as though they were in an
early-season pit, but the strategy
worked. Gaining speed as they went,
the Cards looked better in every
game, and gradually became a unit
that clicked with unfailing regu
larity.
Blasting their way past California's
Bears, who surprised everyone by
leading the league for an amazing
length of time, Stanford's basket
bailers placed themselves on top,
met Oregon for the P.C.C. playofts.
Two Quick Defeats
The Webleet, later acclaimed by
the Indians as the best team they
had played all season, went home
with two straight losses hung around
their tailfeathers. Thus Stanford
took its third consecutive P.C.C.
crown in the same manner as in the
previous years—two fast defeats for
their opponents each time.
The final roundup of the 1938 sea
son brings to light the following in
teresting odds and ends:
For the first time, a team —U.C.
L.A.—failed to win a single game.
. . . Stanford set a new Southern
Division record of 634 points for 12
games. . . . U.S.C., for the third
successive year, was "foul cham
pion, ' with 181 infractions marked
up against them. Cal was next, with
107; U.C.L.A., 147; and Stanford
cleanest with 129. . . . Stanford's
team had the best free throw aver
age— 6S. 3—and Luisetti had the top
individual average—7B.l2.

of the Cal-Stanford series. Hank's
own record of 208 for one season of
conference play was knocked over
by his new mark of 232 points.
The Golden Era has ended because
Coach Bunn was recently chosen to
succeed retiring Dean of Men George
B. Cuiver, and probably will
riot continue his coaching duties.
No definite decision has been made
as yet, however.
The Cards played a season of bas
ketball which, if placed on a chart,
would resemble steel sales in 1914.
Starting slow, John Bunn's Laugh
ing Boys played under orders to de
liberately "not push." The mentor
was trying to avoid the late-season
slump which hit Stanford last year.
Missed Slump
And that slump was missed. It
appeared as though they were in an
early-season pit, but the strategy
worked. Gaining speed as they went,
the Cards looked better in every
game, and gradually became a unit
that clicked with unfailing regu
larity.
Blasting their way past California's
Bears, who surprised everyone by
leading the league for an amazing
length of time, Stanford's basket
bailers placed themselves on top,
met Oregon for the P.C.C. playofts.
Two Quick Defeats
The Webleet, later acclaimed by
the Indians as the best team they
had played all season, went home
with two straight losses hung around
their tailfeathers. Thus Stanford
took its third consecutive P.C.C.
crown in the same manner as in the
previous years—two fast defeats for
their opponents each time.
The final roundup of the 1938 sea
son brings to light the following in
teresting odds and ends:
For the first time, a team —U.C.
L.A.—failed to win a single game.
. . . Stanford set a new Southern
Division record of 634 points for 12
games. . . . U.S.C., for the third
successive year, was "foul cham
pion, ' with 181 infractions marked
up against them. Cal was next, with
107; U.C.L.A., 147; and Stanford
cleanest with 129. . . . Stanford's
team had the best free throw aver
age— 6S. 3—and Luisetti had the top
individual average—7B.l2.
Coach John Bunn's Golden Era
of Stanford basketball has ended.
The 1938 combination of Cardinal
hoopsters, led by Captain Hank Lui
setti, the greatest Ail-American ever
to pound a pavilion, first topped
Southern Division standings, then
went on to bring home to Stanford
the third consecutive Coast Cham
pionship.
And in this, the last season for
Captain Hank, the Card All-Ameri
can marked up a new world's rec
ord scoring mark of 1596 points for
four years of play, besides breaking
his own Southern Division one
season scoring record.
New Loop Marks
The old world mark of 1531 was
broken by Luisetti in the third game
of the Cal-Stanford series. Hank's
own record of 208 for one season of
conference play was knocked over
by his new mark of 232 points.
