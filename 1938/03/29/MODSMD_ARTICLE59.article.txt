# Nine to Meet Gaels Today
## Baseballers Garner Two Wins in South 
### 
Two victories in six starts was
the best Stanford's varsity baseball
ers could do on their annual tour
of Southern California during
spring vacation, from v.hich they re
turned yesterday to engage the St.
Mary's Gaels this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock on the Sunken Diamond.
In four C.1.8.A. games the Indians
were winners only once. Glenn
Hamilton pitched his teammates to
an 8-3 victory over U.C.L.A. in the
opening game of the Bruin series
for their only conference win of the
tour.
In the other three tilts the Cards
failed to connect at the plate and
committed error after error in the
field to fall haplessly before their
opponents. U.C.L.A. took the sec
ond game of their series, 13-1, when
the Indians made eight fielding bob
bles and produced only one run and
two hits.
