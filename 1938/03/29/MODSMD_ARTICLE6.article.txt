## Desmond Opens Series Tonight 
### 
Robert W. Desmond, associate
editor of the Christian Science Mon
itor, will speak this evening on
"Censorship and Propagandaâ€”Twin
Weapons of Modern Statecraft" at
7:30 o'clock in the auditorium, Me
morial Hall. Mr. Desmond's talk
will open the Tuesday Evening Se
ries for the spring quarter.
Dr. Desmond, who has been ap
pointed acting associate professor of
journalism at Stanford for this quar
ter, will discuss the effects of cen
sorship and propaganda in shaping
world opinion and influencing the
course of history. His remarks will
be based in part upon his own ex
perience as a foreign correspondent
in London, Paris, and other Eu
ropean cities.
Dr. Desmond believes that un
adulterated facts, freely available,
are essential to the success and sur
vival of democracy, but that they
are becoming increasingly difficult
to obtain. He is the author of the
recently published "The Press and
World Affairs," a study of the fac
tors affecting the presentation of
the news of international relations.
The speaker is also the author of
"Newspaper Reference Methods,"
and has taught at the Universities of
Michigan and Minnesota, and in
1932 was a member of the Institute
of Politics at Williamstown, Mas
sachusetts. He obtained his Ph.D.
degree from the University of Lon
don. The public is invited to this
lecture.
