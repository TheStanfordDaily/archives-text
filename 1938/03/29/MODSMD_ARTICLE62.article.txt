## Troy, Ucla Trounce Cards by 9-2 Scores 
### 
Stanford's inexperienced tennis
team lost to U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. by
9-2 scores over the past week-end
at Los Angeles to put itself, at least
temporarily, in the Conference cel
lar.
Brock scored the Card's singles
win against U.S.C. and Seaver did
the trick against U.C.L.A. Captain
Underwood's stand against Leavens,
the Trojans' number three man,
was the best tennis of the compe
tition.
The Stanford ace took the first set
at 8-6 and was edged out in the
second after sustaining a severe liga
ment injury to his knee. Under
wood was forced to default when he
was down 3-0 in the final set.
