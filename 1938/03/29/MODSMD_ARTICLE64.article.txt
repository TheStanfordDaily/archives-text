# Track Squad Slays Husky Team, 70-60
## 
### 
With a 70-to-60 triumph over the
| University of Washington Huskies
tucked under their belts, Stanford's
trackmen were yesterday resuming
heavy training in preparation foi
Saturday's meet with F*esno State
College.
Eighteen Indians made the trip to
the Norhwast lor last Friday night'i
meet. The Huskies were also lim
ited to eighteen competitors.
Although the Huskies took eight
wins to Stanford's seven, the Indians'
terrific power in the field events
c;ave them their margin of victory.
They swept the shot put and discus
throw clean, also took one-two in the
pole vault to outscore their foes 37-
l(i in the field events. Washington
had a 44-33 margin in the running
events.
At Disadvantage
Holding the meet in the Washing
ton Pavilion put the Indian runners
at a distinct disadvantage. The Hus
kies, who train in the Pavilion every
day, were complete masters of the
220-yard oval while the Cardinals
were unfamiliar with indoiy com
petition.
Even with this handicap, two
Cards, Captain Ray Malott and Pete
Zagar, hung up new Pavilion rec
ords. Malott won a ten-yard deci
sion from Dick Montgomery, Husky
quarter - miler, in 4!).2'5, erasing
"Blazin' Ben" Eastman's former rec
ord by .2 s. The x-Stanford flyer
made his mark in 1931.
When Zagar spun the discus out
153 feet l'v inches, it was again a
former Indian who was victimized.
Phil Levy established the old mark
of 157 feet 'â€¢> inch last year. Hugh
Gribbin, who took second to team
mate Zagar, also broke Levy's mark
when he heaved the platter 157 feet
7 inches. Stan Andersen completed
the sweep.
Score Clean Sweep
Tom Montgomery, Jack Lipnuin,
and Andersen all tossed the shot
put over 48 feet to score another
sweep for the Farmers. Montgom
ery's winning distance was 48 feet
11% inches.
Ed Burrows, Stanford distance ace,
turned m a double victory in the
mile and two-mile runs. In each race
Burrows waited until the last lap to
run away from his ioes. His time in
the mile, 4:23.3, waf. especially good
considering the small track and lack
of competition.
Other local victories were scored
by Vic Boore and Sumner Gill, who
tied lor first in the pole vault at 13
feet, and Stan Hiserman, who nabbed
the 220 in the good time of 22.75.
Marion Hay, Washington's power
ful sprinter, won the 75-yard dash
from Hiserman but was no match
for the speedy Redskin in the longer
race.
Double Hurdle Win
Captain Art Morgan took indi
vidual honors lor Washington with
a double victory in the hurdles. In
the 80-yard highs, he tied the Pa
vilion record of 9.75, which Stim
Klopstock of Stanford made in 1936.
In the 180-yard low hurdles, Mor
gan and Fred Stutfield completely
outdistanced the Indians' barrier ar
tists to take one-two.
Bill Vandermay leaped 6 feet 3
inches in the high jump to best Russ
Wulff of Stanford. The highest
Wuiff could do under fire was one
inch less than Vandermay, but after
the event was over Wullf cleared the
winning height easily.
Saturday's meet with Fresno wil!
be on the Raisin City team's oval.
