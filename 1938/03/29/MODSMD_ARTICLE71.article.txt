"P)OLITICS are silly, especially women's poli
iT tics.
A small group of women on the Row showed
them up at their very silliest last quarter when
they railroaded a plan for a nominating com
mittee of seven women through Women's Con
ference.
Motives were obscure but perhaps traceable
to the scare Stanford's sorority system got in
last quarter's rushing.
Altruistic in ideal, the plan was designed to
minimize the Hall-Row split. In reality it has
been widened through the antagonism stirred
up.
From last year's politics the idea was resur
rected, sugar-coated, and presented to Con
ference.
Union and Roble never discussed it, Lagu
nita dined it, but the plan was passed.
Pressure was so great that a special meeting
of Conference was called at which a vote on
the right to caucus was passed by an over
whelming majority.
Women now have a nominating committee
plus the right to caucus which makes the nomi
nating committee look rather silly.
Hall women tore their hair, Row women tore
their hair. Actually it doesn't make much dif
ference.
Women's politics are silly.â€”C. C.
