# It's a Doggone Shame
## 
### 
STANFORD'S most vigorous suppressed mi
nority was proscribed at the end of last
quarter when a sudden decree from the Comp
troller's office forbade all living groups to keep
dogs. Sentiment among the dog-owners bore a
strong resemblance to the feeling that moved
the masses in the French Revolution.
No authentic surveys have been made of
opinion among the dogs themselves, but their
masters report that Rin Tin Tin must have turned
over in his grave like a French cabinet in a
crisis. And very probably the shades of Grey
friars Bobby and Lad of Sunnybank snapped
at the ghost of Senator Stanford.
Of course, the Farm without dogs will not
perish from the earth. It will not become a
barren desert, accursed of God. We have tied
a can to our best friend, but we stand a very
good chance of avoiding the lightning.
Even so the prospect of a dogless Stanford
is disheartening. And it is not hard to under
stand the spirit of those dog-owners who com
mented on the situation in sturdy Anglo-Saxon
terms overlooked by the compilers of the dic
tionary. It would seem that there are a great
many things about Stanford that might be at
tended to before we move in on he dog ques
tion.
But the tempests of conflicting opinion would
send even a Solomon to a cyclone cellar. A
second Daniel sitting in judgment would prob
ably find the case appealed over his head to
the Supreme Court. Supporters of the decree
say that the dogs were a nuisance, that they bit
people. The dog-owners say that their pets
were gentle as a mother's touch.

It's all very futile, and it plays hob with our
ideals of comfort. Perhaps it's essential to the
smooth functioning of society, but we can't
get any satisfaction from the prospect of set
tling down to a quiet masculine evening with
book, pipe, slippers, and canary.â€”J. C.
