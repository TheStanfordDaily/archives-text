WHILE ROME BURNS
IT was only natural that I should run into Emery
Bellwether yesterday—Ad Building on Reg Day
being, with the Post Office, one of the two places where
everybody sooner or later sees everybody else. He
wits staring around him in a vaguely thoughtful way,
as though he were either going to say something bril
liant or be violently ill; and when I came up to him
he gave me a pleased smile.
"Well," I said, "you look happy."
"I am," he said. "I am. You know the Accounting
Department?"
"Bellwether," I said, "I go to Stanford."
"Well, you know they won't cash any check over
$2 unless you're paying a bill? Well, I decided I'd
show 'em. I wrote out a $15 check and bought a
Time Schedule with it. They couldn't do a thing
about it."
"Bellwether," I said, "do you realize that while we
blather on about you and the Accounting Department,
the last remnants of a great empire are being ruth
lessly wiped out by the Nazis?"
"Is that a fact. Do you realize that that's a good
looking girl over there?"
"Do you realize that the democracies are being
forced against the wall?"
"How uncomfortable for them. Do you realize
she's kind of cute?"
"And I suppose you know that the Rebels are
winning in Spain, which means that the "Fascist
Bloc" is going to dominate the Mediterranean?"
"Oh, tush. I don't suppose you know what her
name is?"
"Bellwether," I said, "do you realize what is in
store for civilization?"
"Not in the least. I wonder if she'd mind if I
borrowed her fountain-pen or something?"
"Do you realize that within a year or two you may
be out in the trenches killing some poor fool to keep
him from killing you, because neither one of you is
brave enough to admit that the whole business is
silly?"
"Do you really think so? I wonder if she's dated up
for the Reg Dance yet?"
"Bellwether," I said, "I give up."
"Good. I was hoping you would. I dislike people
who cry havoc, because if it's coming it's coming,
and it's far too late now to stop it; and if it isn't it
isn't, and no thanks to us. So cat, drink, and be
merry while you can, I say. You'll have some good
times to remember, anyway, whether they last or
not. I think I will ask her for her fountain-pen.
That's as good an opener as any."
And he walked away, as carefree as they come; a
trifle slap-happy, perhaps, but enjoying himself.
