JpOR years Hhl Kemp's main stock in trade was
Skinny Ennis crooning "Got a Date with an
Angel" and for the past three years Gil Evans has
been Balboa's main asset. The two apparently iso
lated facts tic up now that they have combined their
talents into what should be a winning combination.
The new combo will give some emphasis to sweet
music, but will keep the men who made it one of
the hottest bands on the Coast.

JN the record line, the clarinet of Benny Goodman
has brought forth one of the best instrumental
tunes that it has ever been our privilege to hear.
Entitled "Don't Be That Way," the tunc consists of
one main strain, with a marvelous job of arranging
taking care of the rest of the disk.
For once Benny has competently scotched the
nasty rumor that they don't, play good, only loud.
Toward the end of the record the band takes a three
chorus diminuendo with Jess Stacey's left hand
showing up nicely. Then Krupa takes a drum break
and the brass screech out the ending. You can't
help but like it.
It. seems as if every recorded swing session can't
leave the name of Larry Clinton alone. But then
there is adequate justification, first for his arranging—
it helped put the Casa Loma out of the world a few
year back; second, for his own band; and now for
the vocalist he has discovered. Her name is Bea
Wain and she reminds us of Helen Ward more than
anyone we know. Her voice is not quite as throaty
or heavy as la Ward, but she makes up for it with
her fine phrasing. She does fine with Clinton on
"I Dreamt I Dweit in Marble Halls" and "Martha."
However, Clinton's "Look," Victor 25794, is utterly
useless and so closely patterned after "Posin"" that
even the idea seems stupid.

'JMIE Andrew Sisters come back with another good
job on "It s Easier Said Than Done." You know
they started that "Bei Mir" stuff, and this new record,
Decca 1691, shows that they've got something. It re
minds me of how lousy the Pickens Sisters were.
Mildred Bailey comes back into the record lists
again, this time recording under her own name. She's
been one of our favorites ever since she used to sing
with Paul Wihteman way back when. At that time
her brother was singing with Whiteman with a
couple of other fellows under the name of the
Rhythm Boys. The couple of other fellows were
Harry Barris and Bing Crosby. This time Mildred
whips out with "Lover Come Back to Me" and "The
Land of the Sky Blue Water." Vocalion 3982 and
very fine.
Johnny Mercer takes a crack at Raymond Scott
for the title of the screwiest song-titler with a little
number which he coyly calls "The Week-end of a
Private Secretary." Red Norvo does it on Bruns
wick 8088 coupled with "Please Be Kind," which is a
little icky.
The only amusing thing about the horrible thing
called Ti Pi Tin is the Berkeley announcer who
called it Hank Luisctti's theme song.

JN the record line, the clarinet of Benny Goodman
has brought forth one of the best instrumental
tunes that it has ever been our privilege to hear.
Entitled "Don't Be That Way," the tunc consists of
one main strain, with a marvelous job of arranging
taking care of the rest of the disk.
For once Benny has competently scotched the
nasty rumor that they don't, play good, only loud.
Toward the end of the record the band takes a three
chorus diminuendo with Jess Stacey's left hand
showing up nicely. Then Krupa takes a drum break
and the brass screech out the ending. You can't
help but like it.
It. seems as if every recorded swing session can't
leave the name of Larry Clinton alone. But then
there is adequate justification, first for his arranging—
it helped put the Casa Loma out of the world a few
year back; second, for his own band; and now for
the vocalist he has discovered. Her name is Bea
Wain and she reminds us of Helen Ward more than
anyone we know. Her voice is not quite as throaty
or heavy as la Ward, but she makes up for it with
her fine phrasing. She does fine with Clinton on
"I Dreamt I Dweit in Marble Halls" and "Martha."
However, Clinton's "Look," Victor 25794, is utterly
useless and so closely patterned after "Posin"" that
even the idea seems stupid.

'JMIE Andrew Sisters come back with another good
job on "It s Easier Said Than Done." You know
they started that "Bei Mir" stuff, and this new record,
Decca 1691, shows that they've got something. It re
minds me of how lousy the Pickens Sisters were.
Mildred Bailey comes back into the record lists
again, this time recording under her own name. She's
been one of our favorites ever since she used to sing
with Paul Wihteman way back when. At that time
her brother was singing with Whiteman with a
couple of other fellows under the name of the
Rhythm Boys. The couple of other fellows were
Harry Barris and Bing Crosby. This time Mildred
whips out with "Lover Come Back to Me" and "The
Land of the Sky Blue Water." Vocalion 3982 and
very fine.
Johnny Mercer takes a crack at Raymond Scott
for the title of the screwiest song-titler with a little
number which he coyly calls "The Week-end of a
Private Secretary." Red Norvo does it on Bruns
wick 8088 coupled with "Please Be Kind," which is a
little icky.
The only amusing thing about the horrible thing
called Ti Pi Tin is the Berkeley announcer who
called it Hank Luisctti's theme song.
Pat McGuirk
JpOR years Hhl Kemp's main stock in trade was
Skinny Ennis crooning "Got a Date with an
Angel" and for the past three years Gil Evans has
been Balboa's main asset. The two apparently iso
lated facts tic up now that they have combined their
talents into what should be a winning combination.
The new combo will give some emphasis to sweet
music, but will keep the men who made it one of
the hottest bands on the Coast.
