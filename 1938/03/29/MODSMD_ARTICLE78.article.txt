# Utility Acts Valid By Court Verdict
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 28 (UP).â€”
The Supreme Court today upheld
the legality of the registration and
penalty features of the 1935 Utility
Holding Company Act, but care
fully avoided any hint of its posi
tion on the measure's drastic "death
sentence" provision which was not
at issue.
The decision came in a challenge
brought by the Electric Bond &
Share Company, the largest holding
company in the industry, of lower
New York court rulings that Con
gress has power to force interstate
utility units to register with a Fed
cral agency and to impose penalties
for failure to do so.
