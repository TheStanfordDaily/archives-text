SAN FRANCISCO, March 28
(UP).—Seven hundred and fifty
longshoremen on San Francisco's
Embarcadero today found proof
for the old adage, "gold is where
you find it."
A roughly-dressed man about 50,
wearing prospector's boots, appeared
before the longshoremen and tossed
two handfuls of $20 gold pieces
among them. Not since the gold
rush days had San Francisco heard
of such a stunt.
The result was a near riot. Men
blackened each other's eyes, tore
clothes and fought wildly to re
trieve the coins.
