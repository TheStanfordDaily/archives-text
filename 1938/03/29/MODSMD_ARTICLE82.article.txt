# 'Snow White' Enjoys Self; So Does Critic
## 
### 
"Snow White" is now playing at
j the Varsity, and it's worth any
body's time to go down and watch
i her play. She has such fun. "Snow
i White" is the complete manifesta
| tion of human happiness. "Snow
: White" is the complete manifesta
tion of animal happiness.

"Snow White"
i s trustworthy,
loyal, helpful,
friendly, courte
ous, kind, obedi
e nt, cheerful,
kind, reverent.
''Snow White"
does a good deed
every day, it's
shown.
But the first 10

minutes are still boring. I might
j evn suggest you skip the first 10
minutes, because it borders on the
commonplace. Snow White just
j sings into a well, the Prince Charm
ing acts like Robert Taylor, the
mean old Queen chortles in her dun
geon, and Disney is not utilizing his
medium.
Stock Scene
| Then after a stock Silly Sym-
I phony horror scene, "Snow White"
: whips into something fine. Seven
little dwarfs came marching home
from work. They are singing the
j "Marching Song." They have been
working hard. They are hungry.
And they are happy — supremely
happy.
They march over hills, down hills,
betwen trees, over logs. "Hi ho, hi
ho," they simply sing over and over.
We see them from all sorts of bi
zarre angles. The effect, I'm not
i ashamed to say, is as exhilarating as
. the so-called classics.
"Safe To Sec'
So far I've only come across one
person who didn't like "Snow
White."' He hadn't seen the picture
| yet, didn't intend to see it, and
didn't want to see it, so I'm not
quite sure of how he knew he dis
liked "Snow White." His only rea
son was that h*?'d never liked a
Disney work yet. If you're like that
don't see "Snow White."
Most mortals are pretty safe in
going, however, but please, please
don't leave the theater saying how
marvelous it is that just drawings
could be made to look so life-like.
Don't praise the technical adroit
ness of the Disney Studios. It's only
the means and to laud it is to slap
in the face the really fine end prod
uct. —A1 Zelver
