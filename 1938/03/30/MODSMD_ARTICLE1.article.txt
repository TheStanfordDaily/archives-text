### BILL MILLIS 
WPANISH GENERALS, like gen
erals elsewhere, have been con
sistent braggadocios in exaggerating
their own successes and in mini
mizing the gains of their opponents.
Typical of such an attitude was the j
Insurgent statement of two days ago ,
announcing the entry of Rebel troops j
into the western Catalonian city of!
Lcrida, former Loyalist general
headquarters.
Yesterday, Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco's field headquarters
at Mequinenza, Spain, repudiated
earlier "nationalist" radio reports
that Lcrida had fallen, and
claimed that Rebel troops were
eight miles west of that city,
preparing for a new engagement
eight miles west of that city, which
was reported in flames.
The southernmost of the three In
surgent armies pushing toward Bar
celona and the seacoast was re
ported about to seize an important
hydro-electric plant in the Grosa
mountains which supplies the bulk
of the power to the Loyalists' war
industries. An unconfirmed Insur
gent report asserted that Republican
Generalissimo Sebastian Pozas had
been relieved of his command.

ieo's plans for compensatory

the Roosevelt Administration tight
ened a rope around Mexico's eco
nomic throat by reducing the for
eign silver price from 44 to 43 cents
an ounce, further weakening the
stability of the peso.
"On unimpeachable informa
tion," the United Press reported
that Washington will impose in
creasing economic pressure until
Mexican President Lazaro Carde
nas offers a satisfactory solution
of the oil problem.
Several Congressmen declared
that the Administration's action

neighbor" policy, while others pro

toward expropriating as destroying
the principles of reciprocity in
