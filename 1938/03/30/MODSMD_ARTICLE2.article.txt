# Lost Ice Cream Refuses To Melt
## 
### 
Found: one brick â€”of ice
cream. Well, what is really
found is a slip of paper en
titling the bearer to a quart of
ice cream. If the paper is not
claimed at once, the Lost and
Found Department in the Ad
Building is going to find out
how much it is worth.
The Accounting Department
docs not guarantee to preserve,
indefinitely, anything as elusive
as ice cream.
Eye-glasses, five pairs of
them, have been turned in at
the Accounting Department
and at the A.S.S.U. office.
There are three pairs with
light transparent rims, one
with light metal rims, and one
with dark rims.
Other articles among the
"found" are several glass
cases, keys, check books and
bankbooks.
