# Desmond Talks On Propaganda
## Journalist Says U.S. Press Best in World 
### 
"Censorship and Propaganda â€”
Twin Weapons of Statecraft" was the
subject of a lecture by Dr. Robert W.
Desmond, associate professor of
journalism for the spring quarter, in
Memorial Hall last evening. Dr.
Desmond based his talk on his own
experience as foreign correspondent
in London, Paris, and other Euro
pean cities.
He said that "we in the United
States have the best press the world
has ever known," and that the mod
ern press was free in only three large
countries of the world, the United
States, Great Britain, and France.
He described censorship and propa
ganda as "reverse sides of the same
coin," as a means of spreading na
tional ignorance.
Censorship he defined as "a means
by which certain information is kept
from release," and propaganda as
"information released with deliber
ate intent to create a certain point
of view in the readers."
Dr. Desmond told of the various
means employed by press-restricted
countries to get rid of foreign jour
nalists whose dispatches did not
please the government. Thus, al
though he believes that unadulter
ated facts are essential to the suc
cess and survival of democracy, he
emphasized that they are becoming
I increasingly difficult to obtain.
