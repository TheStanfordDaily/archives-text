# Honor Code Cases Up before Council

### 
First meeting of spring quarter for
Men's Council will be held next

In the final meeting of last quar

student" guilty of a violation of the
honor code. The punishment given
was the addition of 25 units to the
graduation requirements of the stu
dent and a flunking grade in the
course in question.
