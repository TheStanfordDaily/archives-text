issued the following statement at
the inception of the second annual
drive:
'Stanford undergraduates, while
preoccupied with various activities
of student life, think too seldom of
the sacrifices that have been made
to provide them an education at
only a small percentage of its true
cost. As a result of the Stanford
Fund, undergraduates are begin
ning, however, to understand the
necessity of an enlarged endowment
if Stanford is to maintain its posi

A.S.S.U. President Tom Killefer
issued the following statement at
the inception of the second annual
drive:
'Stanford undergraduates, while
preoccupied with various activities
of student life, think too seldom of
the sacrifices that have been made
to provide them an education at
only a small percentage of its true
cost. As a result of the Stanford
Fund, undergraduates are begin
ning, however, to understand the
necessity of an enlarged endowment
if Stanford is to maintain its posi
tion as a leading university."
