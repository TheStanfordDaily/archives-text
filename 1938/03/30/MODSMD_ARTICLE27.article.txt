# File To Eliminate Appointment Gravy'
## 
### 
Equal opportunity for all—no more gravy appointments to "deserving
friends"—all this the result of a new cross-indexed file to contain the
name of every Stanford activity man.
Idea for the file, first proposed by John Dern at last quarter's final
Ex Committee meeting, originated as a plan to cope with Cardinals' ap-

pointment system, which bxcom
believed to be "inefficient and unfair
to unknowns."
Axe Society is in charge of the
filo, on which will be lLsted all men
who have been, are, or are inter
ested in participating in any campus
activity.
As formulated by Axe Society
President Jack Calderwood, final ar
rangements call for a member of the
Society to take charge of gathering
all available information about men
to be listed in the file.
"And then," explained Calder
wood, "we'll hire someone —not a
member of Axe Society—who will
carefully and neatly record, cross
index, and file the names. This file
will enable activity chairmen to
eliminate blind choices— to say
nothing of the way it will help dry
up the gravy train."

The list, which will contain only i
I men's names, is similar to the one
for women which has been main
! tained in the Dean of Women's office
j for over a year.
In its meeting tonight, Axe So
i ciety will decide whether the file, to j
be placed in the A.S.S.U. office, is to
be available to the general student
j body.
