# President Okays Farm Curriculum
## Good Education Must Be Competitive, Says Wilbur in Interview 
### JIM STONE 
Despite recent tempests in the |
educational teapot over too spe
cialized university training, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur is satisfied
with Stanford's present curriculum.
"University education must be
competitive to be good," he said yes
terday.
His statement was made during an
interview concerning a recent sug
gestion made by Professor Joel Hil
debrand of the University of Cali
fornia that courses of study slanted
toward specific training at his uni
versity be abandoned in favor of
general cultural systems.
Abolish 'Majors'
Professor Hildebrand also sug-,
gested the abolition of the "major
system" for the California College of |
Letters and Sciences, and the crea- i
tion of general survey courts given
on a pass-fail system.
His suggestion followed a similar
one made by President Robert Gor
don Sproul of California in a public
address and is in line with criti
cisms made by President Robert
Hutchins of the University of Chi
cago in recent magazine articles.
Discussing the trend as a whole,
Dr. Wilbur expressed the belief that
this recent swing in education is an
"educational cult."
That the end of such a movement
"to teach men and women to use
their minds instead of their memo
ries" —is a go*d to be aimed at, Di.
Wilbur emphasized, but he did not
agree that a relaxation of the edu
cational system would best achieve j
that end. '
Stanford a 'Happy Medium'
As a happy medium between the
strictly specialized curriculum and
the general cultural course of study,
the President points to Stanford s
system. "For the first two years," he
said, "we have created the Lower ■
Division, which allows the student J
to start a broad education.
"Second," he continued, "the uni
versity has been organized into
schools, to spread out the depart
mental training." By this method,
the student pointing to a specific
goal is not forced to confine his study
fo one department to obtain his dc
gree.
"For the advanced work, the de
gree is given in the department, fi
nally allowing specialized work." The
system is completed by the Uni
versity Division, which allows the
student complete freedom for an
individual course of study.
System Satisfies Students
This system, Dr. Wilbur believes,
takes care of the majority of students
who seek a general education, but
with special requirements for final
training.
As for cultural courses given on a
pass-fail basis, Dr. Wilbur said that
he had "no use for them."
"The man with a good mind can
do as well in a course on art and
music as he can on engineering. He
can obtain a good education only
if he approaches his study with a
desire to do as well as he can,' he
said.
He pointed out that cultural tal
ents have never been hampered by
specialized training, citing examples
of the successful doctor who writes
novels, or the engineer who col
lects art objects. His general con- j
elusion was that the job of educa- >
tion must be done as well as possible j
to be worth anything.
Shows Main Fault
The main fault with the current
movement to broaden educational
training, as seen by Dr. Wilbur, was
that it was based on the assumption
that an education could be obtained
from theory rather than from actual i
experience and laboratory - tested I
fact.
He foresees a rising popularity of j
the movement with a rapid subsi
dence, leaving an after-effect of a '
broader education. But this educa
tion, he feels, will be based upon the
latter, factual curriculum.
