# Card Coeds Not So Coy-Forty Years Ago

### DOUG JAQUES 
Newspapermen libeled Cal women 40 years ago by saying that they
were knock-kneed and spavined. Other newspaper men defended them,
saying that they were iust overly modest.
They said all this comparing them to Stanford women. The Farm
lasses had a ha kethall game scheduled with the Berkeley women then,

ana ine coy Calitornians refused#
to play if any men were allowed to
watch them.
Stanford's coeds had no objections
to the male rooters, and therefore
won the support of the newspa
pers, who wrote things about the
shape of the Berkeleyites' knees,
and of the Stanford men.
This all happened in the gay 90's,
when bicycling in bloomers was a
general habit even among the Ber
keley women. But they must have
thought that their knees weren't
being ogled while they were on their
bicycles, and that they would be
while they were playing basketball.
They objected to this ogling.
Stanford women were not so
modest.
More Modest?
Maybe, being so out-numbered on
the Farm, they were more used to
men. Maybe they played better
basketball and had less cause to
object to critical male spectators.
Today both schools would object
to playing basketball in bloomers
before men—for entirely different
reasons. But today the women
don't play basketball. Newspapers
no longer call the Cal women knock- *
