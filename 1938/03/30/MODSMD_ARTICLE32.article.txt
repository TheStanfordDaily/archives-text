Two more days! And the stone
work on the front of the new Cub
berley building will be completed.
With this, the shrill whistle of the
workmen lifting the heavy blocks
into place will go.
"The work is progressing well,"
said Superintendent Leavers. "The
plastering is about 75 per cent done
on the first floor and 50 per cent on
the second and third. This stage is
somewhat of a dead interval, so
when the plastering is finished we
will make even greater progress.
"The last coat of stucco is being
put on the outside and the air-con
ditioning is over 80 per cent com
pleted. The tile work on the inside
is being started and will go much
faster upon the completion of the
plastering."
