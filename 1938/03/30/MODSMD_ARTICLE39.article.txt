# Indians Conquer Gaels in Ninth
## Coffis Stars For Varsity In 6-5 Victory Hamilton Scores Run In Last-Inning Rally Against Moragamen 
### 
Little Jimmy Coffis came through
with a rousing single into center
field, his fourth hit in six turns at
bat yesterday afternoon, to send
Glenn Hamilton across the plate
with the winning run as Stanford's
varsity baseballers staged a two
run rally in the ninth inning of
their game with St. Mary's on the
Sunken Diamond and nosed out the
Gaels, G-5.
After spotting the Moragamen a
5-2 lead in the third inning, the
Indians gradually cut down their
margin in the fourth and seventh
innings and finally beat the Gaels
out with a two-run uprising in the
last stanza.
