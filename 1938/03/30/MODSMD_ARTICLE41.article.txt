had an athlete oncc
who was admii'ed so much bj
the student body that his jersey wa:
forever withdrawn from use in the
sport at which he was proficient.
His name was Ernie Nevers, and
he has often been called the great
est fullback football has ever seen
He was a Stanford man of a type
that has been idealized since they
built the old Farm into a great uni
versity. Time after time Nevers
pulled a mediocre team up from the
depths to the heights. It will be lony
before Stanford forgets him, par
ticularly his showing when, with
two cracked ankles taped so stiff he
couldn't bend them, he made Stan
ford look like a champion in defeat
in the Rose Bowl against Notre
Dame.
Never- was a leader and one of
the most popular athletes in Stan
ford's history, l»ut he was no more
a leader or more popular than
Hank Luisetti. world's champion
captain of the greatest collegiate
basketball team in the United
States.
Stanford saw fit in that golden era
of the Middle Twenties —1925, to be
exact—to enshrine Ernie Nevers'
football suit in the trophy room.
That's why you haven't seen a Stan
ford football player since that time
wearing No. 1.
Stanford should see fit now to
withdraw from future varsity bas
ketball rosters the No. 7 in memo
ry of Luisetti, certainly the greatest
player of the moment and possibly
the greatest of all time. No one has
a better right to the honor than this
champion of champions, who has
been a Stanford man all the way, as
well as a great athlete.

r jpRACK fans might be interested
in seeing San Mateo Junior Col
lege and Pasadena Junior College
battle it out on Angel 1 Field Satur
day afternoon, even though the var
sity is going south to engage Fresno
State that day. The freshmen have
a meet in the morning here, too. '
Coach Hilmer Lodge of San
Mateo, Stanford man, made the
best of the opportunity to give his
boys a chance for competition on a
real track. The Mateans are
slightly handicapped in that they
have no track of their own, and
are permitted to use the Burlin
game High School track, affec
tionately known as the "cement"
track.
The Burlingame track was first
built of oyster shells, the stuff they
make cement from, and the track
was slightly hard. However, they
say it's gravel now, which may or
may not be a step in the right di
rection.
The Pasadena team comes up
here with a pretty fair team, Lodge
says, one that includes a 4:19 miler.
San Mateo has a miler, Marston
Girard, who, while he can't match
that time quite yet, may someday
turn into a fair country distance
man. It's whispered that Girard may
come 1o Stanford.
Incidentally, Dink Templcton
predicted that Ray Malott would
crack the -110 record in his first
outdoor meet of the season, pro
vided the conditions were right,
you may or may not recall. The
Fresno meet will be Ray's first
outdoors, but the Flyer still needs
a little work. He might bring
Templeton's prediction true, but
don't look for it.
At Washington last week. Malott
looked pretty good, considering that
he ran 49.2 and reportedly butcher
ed the turns, of which there were
four. The record this week is not
out of his reach, but he still isn't
quite ready. The rain has slowed
him down.

The Pasadena team comes up
here with a pretty fair team, Lodge
says, one that includes a 4:19 miler.
San Mateo has a miler, Marston
Girard, who, while he can't match
that time quite yet, may someday
turn into a fair country distance
man. It's whispered that Girard may
come 1o Stanford.
Incidentally, Dink Templcton
predicted that Ray Malott would
crack the -110 record in his first
outdoor meet of the season, pro
vided the conditions were right,
you may or may not recall. The
Fresno meet will be Ray's first
outdoors, but the Flyer still needs
a little work. He might bring
Templeton's prediction true, but
don't look for it.
At Washington last week. Malott
looked pretty good, considering that
he ran 49.2 and reportedly butcher
ed the turns, of which there were
four. The record this week is not
out of his reach, but he still isn't
quite ready. The rain has slowed
him down.
—Peterson
had an athlete oncc
who was admii'ed so much bj
the student body that his jersey wa:
forever withdrawn from use in the
sport at which he was proficient.
His name was Ernie Nevers, and
he has often been called the great
est fullback football has ever seen
He was a Stanford man of a type
that has been idealized since they
built the old Farm into a great uni
versity. Time after time Nevers
pulled a mediocre team up from the
depths to the heights. It will be lony
before Stanford forgets him, par
ticularly his showing when, with
two cracked ankles taped so stiff he
couldn't bend them, he made Stan
ford look like a champion in defeat
in the Rose Bowl against Notre
Dame.
Never- was a leader and one of
the most popular athletes in Stan
ford's history, l»ut he was no more
a leader or more popular than
Hank Luisetti. world's champion
captain of the greatest collegiate
basketball team in the United
States.
Stanford saw fit in that golden era
of the Middle Twenties —1925, to be
exact—to enshrine Ernie Nevers'
football suit in the trophy room.
That's why you haven't seen a Stan
ford football player since that time
wearing No. 1.
Stanford should see fit now to
withdraw from future varsity bas
ketball rosters the No. 7 in memo
ry of Luisetti, certainly the greatest
player of the moment and possibly
the greatest of all time. No one has
a better right to the honor than this
champion of champions, who has
been a Stanford man all the way, as
well as a great athlete.

slightly handicapped in that they
