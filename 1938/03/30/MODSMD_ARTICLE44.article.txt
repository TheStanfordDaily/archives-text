# Fifty-Nine Turn Out For Spring Football
## 
### 
The Big Red Machine came out of winter storage yesterday afternoon
as 59 football hopefuls began a two-month siege of spring training on the
i Greys' field.
Coaches Tiny Thornhill, Ben Vvinkleman. and Husky Hunt put the
aggregation through drills which included everything from limbering-up

j exercises to work on fundamental
I plays. Nineteen of the most versa-
J tile backfield men on the Coast
I passed, kicked, and ran as if they
j were in mid-season form. It was
j easy to see that Thornhill is going
to be blessed with a large array of
backs who can perform in triple
| threat style.
Paulman Boots 'Em
Bill Paulman booted a few into
; the wind that went 60 yards and then
| threw a lot - r looping passes with
surprising ability. Hamp Pool and
| Jim Groves were also showing good
form with both their toes and their
J throwing arms.
The linemen spent a good two
| hours working on the tackling dum
mies and then in a bit of miniature
dummy scrimmage. Outstanding in
their absence were Tackles Stan
| Andersen and Pete Zagar, and
! John Casey, the ex-junior college
! back, all of whom are out for track.
Jack Clark and Jack Walton also
| missed the premiere woi-kout, as did
a host of frosh and varsity baseball
| players.
Standlce Fits
Norm Standlee, 207-pound frosh
j fullback sensation, seemed to fit like
! a veteran into several backfield
spots. One quartet which accidental
ly came together when Winkleman
called for four men was composed
I of little Pete Fay, Paulman, Stand-

I lee, and Bill Kirsch. Another had
(Freddie Ledeboer, Pool, Gene Cold
j iron, and Groves in the same line
j up.
The squad works out today and
| tomorrow, then rests again until
; Monday of next week.
