Displaying marked improvement
' in all departments, Stanford's fresh
i man diamond outfit smashed out a
J 6-2 victory over the strong Mission
High aggregation, on a wind-blown
frosh diamond.
Allowing two scattered Hits and
walking three batters, pitcher "Coo
tie" Thompson won his third tilt of
the season out of four starts. His
16 strikeouts kept the Mission boys
off the base paths throughout the
game.
Chalking up a homer and two
J singles, newcomer Thor Peterson led
, the day's batting. Monte Pfyl and
j "Ush" Tucker also showed up well
lon the stick work, while for the
! visitors first sacker Bates drove out
' the two allowed hits.
In the seventh inning the Mission
squad drew close when a hit and
I several miss-plays gave them one
' run. However the Papooses pulled
away in their half of the eighth when
Pfyl, Peterson, Tucker, and Boone
j crossed the plate with the cinching
i tallies.
A short infield practice will be
, held this afternoon in preparation for
I tomorrow's tilt with San Mateo J.C.
