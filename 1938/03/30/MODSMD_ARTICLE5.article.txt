# Cady Has Part In 'Kind Lady'
## Veteran Replaces Simmons in Lead Role 
### 
In the forthcoming production of
"Kind Lady," Bud Cady, veteran
Farm actor, steps into the role
Peter Simmons vacated when he
dropped school this quarter, Dra
ma Director H. Miles Hebrer said
yesterday. Cady plays the romantic
lead.
Slated for production in the Me
morial Hall April 13, 14, 15, and
16, "Kind Lady" rehearsals have
bridged vacation.
Kay Campbell, who portrays the
Kind Lady, victim of a suave crook,
practiced during her week holiday
to perfect the mannerisms of a 45-
year-old lady.
"I learned to walk like an older
woman by watching my mother,"
she said.
Hal Kahn, who plays the crook,
paced the Arizona desert while
learning the lines of his stellar role,
and J. P. Cahn, a lesser figure in the
forthcoming drama, learned his
whiie wallowing in the mudflats of
Stockton.
