# Speaking in General

### 
WHEN Johnny comes marching home from
college, the first guestion which Father,
who builds bridges for a living, asks is, "What
do you know?" Johnny then explains that he's
been acguiring culture rather than soon-forgot
ten facts, that he's been "learning to use his
mind rather than his memory," as Dr. Wilbur
put it yesterday. But when it comes right down
to it, Johnny can't even tell Father what .he
doesn't know.
How come? Why this increasingly popular
trend—led by apostles of the new faith like
Chicago's Robert M. Hutchins—to discard spe
cialized training, to broaden out university cur
riculum? Certainly no one will weep any tears
over the passing of a system which merely
leaves a mind cluttered with facts. But will the
abolishment of the grading system, and the
addition of survey courses make Johnny a truly
educated man? Will the general course really
achieve the end of education—to make Johnny
think clearly?
Dr. Wilbur says no. That is the administra
tive viewpoint, the opinion of a trained educa
tor. For the student's part, a university curricu
lum such as was advocated by Dr. Joel Hilde
brand and President Robert Sproul of California
would be a Nirvana. No grades, no majors, no
specialized work—what could be softer?
And what could be more useless? Educators
are having enough trouble fighting off the
charge that universities are turning into "coun
try clubs." More than a few men and women
are going to college as they would to a summer
resort, and are paying their money to be trained,
not for life in society, but for casual talents in
sports and the Big Apple.
The first loser by the general educational
system is the student who is actually seeking
specialized work. He is forced to hack his way
Ihrough the fat of "general courses" only to
find no meat underneath. He is prevented for
a considerable part of his college career from
actually learning anything by the presence of,
and the catering to, his less interested class
mates.
But the real loser,-for there is still adeguate
opportunity for the specializing student, is the
average man and woman for whom the general
system is designed.
Being lost in the welter of generalities of a
survey course, and confused by the attempt to
fit untested theory into pseudo-scientific terms,
leaves him bewildered, disgusted. He has nei
ther facts, nor the ability to think clearly.
The man who has fought through advanced
physics and tested theory in the laboratory
probably is not going to be confused a few
years later when a demagogue throws up a
smoke-screen of tneory, thinly disguised as
fact. He will be more than likely to fall into his
old university habits and think the thing
through.
He will be an educated man.—J. S.
