# Rough Going
## 
### 
STANFORD has fired her patron saint. She
has desecrated the shrine of the Rough,
and the shade of that honorable ancestor has
gone grumbling to some part of the hereafter
where angels don t have to dress for dinner or
tip their halos to the seraphim.
With the announcement that formal dress
would be compulsory at the Senior Prom, Stan
ford washed the last traces of the Rough off her
social hands.
And despite the fact that we reverence the
tradition as an Irishman reverences St. Patrick,
we are unconcerned at its passing.
The Rough has been shoved back into a dog
eared page of history. The old knights in
shining corduroy ride no more, even in spirit.
Today we dress and fuss in a way that would
have disgraced any one of those sturdy pillars
of impropriety unless he did it for the avowed
purpose of separating his maiden aunt from a
check. But there is no rioting, no march on the
Ad Building, no sniping from the rooftops.
Except for a few scattered grumbles, so rare
tha it would take a plainclothes squad to hunt
them down, we accept the new order quietly.
And still Stanford thinks that she must nurse
with loving tenderness each little sprig of tra
dition that shows itself. We are sensitive about
our traditions. And we pride ourselves on
valuing social life above everything else. We
liko to think that we are the devil-may-care

type of lovable black sheep who are more con
cerned about the next dance than about the
little mix-up in Austria.
And we seem to be getting away with it. No
earthquake has rocked the Quad. Our friends
still speak to us. Our fathers haven't ordered us
out of the house. Tickets to the Prom are prac
tically sold out.
It seems that if Stanford forgets to hold its
breath over social situations it can still find one
or two things to justify its existence. It can
even let a tradition die of neglect without find
ing the sheriff on the doorstep the next morn
ing.
The shade of the Rough is probably a little
annoyed. But we can stand that, too.â€”J. C.
