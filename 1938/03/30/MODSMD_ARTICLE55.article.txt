CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION
i OCCASIONALLY Stanford gets a chance to enjoy
a unique sort of class—a class which everyone at
tends although attendance is not required, a class in
which the student gets a chance to give as well as re
ceive, and which more nearly approaches the ideal
than most on the Farm.
In this sort of class there is no one-way route for
ideas. The professor lectures, but he is perfectly
willing to stop and permit the student to give his
view of things. He invites questions, he encourages
debate. He is willing to clarify obscure points, and if
caught out on some minor mistake in fact, he is quite
ready to admit it, and no hard feelings.
He refuses to be dogmatic. He does not care so
much for pounding minute bits of information home
as he does for presenting a broad and open-minded
picture of his subject. Coming up against many pre
conceived thought-patterns, he sometimes deliber
ately goes against them in order to stir up comment
and controversy.
He knows a lot about his subject, but there are
fields of it in which he is not the world's best authority.
He is the first to admit this, and he is content to give
his students indications of the path along which they
may go to find out more than he can give them.
He sometimes says things with which his students
do not agree, after which he is bombarded from the
floor with questions which he parries with a good-na
tured twinkle. He is apt to get rather impatient when
someone wants to know whether the former Spanish
dictator, De Rivera, was any relation to the present
president of Ireland, De Valera, but questions like
that are comparatively few, and his irritation never
lasts very long.
In a large class he keeps both an air of informality
and the respect of his listeners. He makes friends and
influences people right and left, in a likeable sort of
way which no Dale Carnegie could emulate or im
prove upon. He comes near to being a teacher in the
true sense of the word: one who cares as much for
bringing out your ideas as he does for giving you his.
To Dr. Stuart, in short, whose "World Politics"
course was one of the largest, and probably the most
popular, given at Stanford last quarter, congratula
tions for his application of co-operative education.
Not very often does the Farm have such a good time
being taught.
