# No Sudden Death

CRIPPLED: By RUTH SAWYER
(Reprinted from Atlantic Monthly)
J AM writing on the back of old hospital charts, 1
found this stub of a pencil in my handbag. By prop
ing myself on an elbow I can feel the pencil's way
across the paper in this scant light.
If they knew, the doctors and nurses would not let
me write—they would take away these poor tools.
But I cover them up when the night nurse comes in
and feign drowsiness. This writing tonight is all that
stands between me and sanity.
Across the narrow stretch of room, in his cot, lies
my John Paul, whimpering. For twenty days he has
been whimpering. At rare intervals the whimperings
become words; they break through his stupor, like*
embedded needles working their way to the surface.
"Mummy, I want to get up. Please, Mummy!"
John Paul is four years old. He will never get up
again—that is, never as a whole, free, exultant little
boy. He will never throw back the covers of his cot,
shoot across his room and ours, and drop like a plum
met, stomach down, on our bed, shouting, "Hei*e I
come—Daddy and Mum—Daddy and Mum! It's time
to get up—up —up!" Nor will he take the stairs, down,
at a gallop, chanting, "I'll set the table. Knives and
forks, napkins and spoon, porridge and prunes," and
burst into ecstatic laughter because he has found words
with singing sounds. I have read words with stabs of
agony in them; but I have never written them before.
We think of terrible things always happening to that
mythical "other person," somebody who bears no re
lationship to us—no close relationship. Well, I am
that "other person."
Sometimes John Paul plucks at his chart with his
uninjured hand and says: "Take it off, please, Mummy.
It's so heavy." He is in a plaster cast from his throat
to his thighs; there are casts on his legs and one arm.
There is a metal contrivance around his neck to sup
port his head; it is set into the cast on his body. He
looks like a tiny bird trussed up with a steel girder.
Take wings from a bird, and all power to fly—would
he still be a bird? I say, No! As I say that all child
hood has ended for John Paul at four years of age.
The attributes of childhood are freedom, unlimited
faith, joy unrestrained; take these away and what is
left?
I look at the years that stretch ahead of us and
wonder. For the present John Paul will do his liv
ing on a wheeled stretcher—that much the doctors
know. After that a wheel chair, perhaps; at best, a
brace and crutches.
'I his much I know — John Paul can never
drive a car at sft miles an hour around a corner
and, by so doing, cage another's spirit in a help
less body.
Is there no executive or power to speak for these
50,000 crippled each year by someone's negligence?
Is there no way of arousing the conscience of the
drivers of this nation? For centuries men have writ
ten that we have war because at heart men like to
fight. Well—there have always been battles to be
fought that did not involve killing human beings;
there have always been greater victories to win than
those won by one warring people against another.
Here is a fight worthy of a nation's mettle; is it. not
a better thing to fight to save life than to mutilate it?
The nurse has been in again. I must stop. But. if
there be those who read of my John Paul, pray God
they may think on and For other childhood—the
whole, the able, the free; and may they be stirred
beyond pence of mind or lest of body.
