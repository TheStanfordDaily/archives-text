# Students Settle Suit for Damages
## 
### 
A $31,000 damage suit, filed against
William Martin, Sigma Chi, by Bar
bara Rurup of Santa Ana, for inju
ries received in an automobile acci -
dent on the campus a year and a
half ago, was settled out of court
in San Jose yesterday for a reported
$3,000.
Miss Rurup, a former Stanford
sludent, charged that she suffered
severe back injuries when Martin's
car overturned on Galvez street,
near the football stadium. She said
she and Martin were en route to a
football game in Los Angeles.
Testifying in court Monday, Miss
Rurup declared the accident hap
pened when Martin informed her he
would "show her a skid," while the
car was traveling 50 miles an hour.
The machine swerved and over
turned. Miss Rurup declared she
had told only two close friends the
true cause of the accident, because
she thought it would reflect on Mar
tin among his friends.
The settlement was reached after
a conference among attorneys before
the case resumed in the court of
i Superior Judge Charles Davison.
