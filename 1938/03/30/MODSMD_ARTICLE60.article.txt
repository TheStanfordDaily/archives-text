# Warm Water Brings Grins To Students
## 
### 
'"Come on in! The water's fine."
That, in substance, will soon be
the cry of Stanford students after a j
plunge into the hitherto frigid '
waters of Lagunita. Once again the j
Stanford rough and the Stanford !
woman will use the now-warm
waters of Lagunita to forget sultry
Spring Quarter days. The promise
of such joy is foretold in the an
nouncement of Lifeguards Hal |
Weatherbe, Bill Hatch, and John
Brahtz that the water is now warm j
enough for swimming.
The boathouse will be open daily
from 10 o'clock in the morning until |
10 o'clock in the evening, except on j
Saturdays, when the hours will be j
from 10 until 6 o'clock in the eve- I
ning. The boathouse will be closed 1
from 6 to 7 o'clock every evening, i
Living group canoes are available !
but it is necessary that each canoe i
be equipped with a life preserver, it I
has been announced.
Complaints have been made by
members of living groups that, in
the past, they have been unable to
secure the use of their group canoes.
They have declared that they have
gone to the lake hoping for an hour
or so of canoeing only to find a Paly
High student paddling away in the
desired canoe.
To cope with this situation cer
tain groups have issued orders that
canoes of the group are not to be
presented without the showing of a i
club card.
An example of such action is the I
announcement, yesterday, by of
ficials of the Toyon Club that no ,
canoe belonging to the club shall be
issued without the presentation of a !
Toyon card at the boathouse. Other j
living groups have adopted their <
own individual rules as to use of i
canoes.
