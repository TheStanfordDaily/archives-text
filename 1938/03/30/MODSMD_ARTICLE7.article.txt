# Pest Control Meeting Hears Insect Reports
## 
### 
Spitting ticks, living cells, moths,
! and methods of insect control were
I among the subjects discussed by
â–  prominent entomologists at yester
day's conference of the Pacific Coast
j in Jordan Hall.
i A bug that literally "spits in your
A bug that literally "sipts in your
| eye" was described in the public
i health section of the conference by
Dr. William B. Herms, professor of
parasitology and entomology at the
University of California. The spit
ting tick can strike accurately from
i two or three feet causing severe
j pain in the victim's eyes, the sci
entist said.
Reports on Cell
Problems fundamental to the liv-
I ing cell, the common basis of life,
arc attracting the attention of Stan
j ford biologists, Dr. C. V. Taylor told
| members during the second day of
I the conference. Research in the
Stanford constant temperature lab
oratories indicates that germ cells
| are more susceptible to X-ray ap
plications than living tissue, infor
mation which may prove of definite
i medical value. There is a chance
the old theories of Lamarck,

once in disrepute, may be shown to
have some foundation, according to
Dr. Taylor. The idea is "wild," he
said, but there is some evidence
pointing toward the hereditary
transmission of individual charac
teristics acquired through X-ray
applications.
Stresses Values
Stressing the value of a knowl
edge of insect structure and habits
to pest control operators, Dr. Carl
Duncan of the entomology depart
ment of San Jose State College told
the exterminators that unless oper
ators knew what they were working
with they would fail in their ef
forts to control the pest. Professor
Duncan declared that housewives
spend their time killing the com
mon outside variety of moth while
it is only rarely the real clothes
moth is killed.
Speaking on "Principles of In
sect Control," Dr. J. J. Davis of
Purdue University said the severe
winters are not so hard on insect
iife as most people believe. The pro
fessor explained that methods of
growing, cultivation, and sanitation
are rapidly becoming more import-
Lint in relation to insect control.
