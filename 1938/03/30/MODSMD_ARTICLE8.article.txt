# Thomas Mann Tells Of Europe's Unrest
## 
### FRANCES SLATER 
This is about Dr. Thomas Mann, exile of Germany, citizen of the world.
However, not about the Thomas Mann," greatest writer of the twen
tieth century," who last night gruppled with world problems before a
record audience at the San Opera House.
Instead, about the I)r. Mann of today—the small lean person who with
his genteel manner, round high forehead, mild blue eye... scrubby mous-

tache and sandy hair might be r <
doctor or a lawyer. About the gen
tleman, en famille, who is dressed
simply in a dark pSncil-striped suit
and collegiate suede brogues with
only the stage prop cravat of the
European to give away his origin.
His city hotel room is full of
flowers-»-wilted tulips droop from a
wicker basket; tea roses rise in a
silver vase. These are from Dr.
Mann's venerators.
But here in the morning Dr. Mann
sits smoking, his battered oak humi
dor on the table before him. By
the reverence, he seems oppressed
and mildly startled, by the tea-roses,
depressed.
Only when he talks, can he forget
the gilt Regency furniture in his
suite and begin to scatter ashes.
"Yes," he says, "it is true that in
Germany the youth is fired with
zeal for Naziism." Youth, he thinks,
is easily fascinated by the brass
bands and militarism.
But yet, there is defiance too—es
pecially anions,' students of the uni
vei'sities.
"Do you know, when they exiled
me from Germany," he says, "the
| University of Bonn on the Rhine
j took away my honorary doctor's
I degree. I wrote a letter in reply—
a letter forbidden throughout Ger
many, and with the University stu
dents this dangerous letter became e
passion—yes, copies, hundreds ol
them, were made even on typewrit
ers. So you see, there is strife
within the ranks."
And does America and her dem
ocracy face a similar nemesis?
Dr. Mann smiles. "Well, as foi
the youth, their Socialism and Com-
I munism is not a serious threat tc
Democracy. Youth goes to such ex
tremes— and their plans are such
idealism, you know."
"And for your president—Roose
velt—l have great faith in him. Be
cause of his forceful personality,
people say he is a dictator in the
true sense. That is not so, I think he
is on the right track. No, America
is the bulwark of democracy."
Artistic Freedom
To shift from politics, what about
the freedom of the artist in the dic
tator countries?
"Well, although Italy, like Ger
many, is a totalitarian state, Mus
solini does not really care to stifle
art. Of course, art is a second-rate
matter there but he is very indif
ferent.
But Herr Hitler—ah, that is dif
freent! Hitler, you know, is an art
ist himself—a painter. S.o of course,
He must have personal control of all
writers and painters."
And with this, Dr. Mann, exile of
Germany and world citizen, Nobel
prize winner and "greatest writer of
the twentieth century," winks as he
crushes out his cigarette in an
earthenware dish.
