### BILL MILLIS 
/ I RISIS-WEARIED Europe seems
to be headed towards another
of its periodic diplomatic impasses,
as an aftermath of Benito Musso
lini's address to the Italian puppet-
Senate yesterday, in which II Duce
warned the world that Italy is
ready for war on land, sea, and air
with one of the greatest military
machines in history.
Predicting that a "new victory"
is near for Fascism, Mussolini
said that Italy plans to carry war
~ through the. air because "we must
dominate the skies and weaken
the morale of peoples."
Time worn keynotes of Fascist
doctrine —the dream of "a Fascist
Roman empire," the belief that "a
people's war power" is what counts
in international relations, the as
sertion that "our best defense is to
be an offensive" —were reiterated by
ll Duce, who surprised observers by
not repeating his previous warning
that French aid to the Spanish Loy
alists might lead to war.
Of equal importance in the speech
was its revelation of the extreme de
gree to which all Italian industry is
now operating on a strictly war
time basis.

$91,000,000 naval building program.
In Rumania, King Carol II

of the international preparedness
treadmill.
