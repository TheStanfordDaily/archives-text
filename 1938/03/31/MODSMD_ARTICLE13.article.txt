# Lee Bassett, Drama Head, Will Retire
## Professor Recalls Maxwell Anderson As Undergraduate 
### KATHERINE JOHNSEN 
To watch students with potential
greatness accepting life as a matter- J
of-fact, exerting about 50 per cent
of their abilities, and lacking the
self-appreciation to make their
greatness a reality—that is the real
sting of the teaching profession. But
every once in a while some student
strikes fire—and that is the real joy
of the teaching profession.
With this conclusion, Professor
Lee Emerson Bassett, head of the
Department of Speech and Drama
retiring at the end of this quarter,
recalls with deep pleasure the un
dergraduate years of such of his
students as Maxwell Anderson, Mil
ler McClintock, Bruce Bliven, Jus
tian Miller, Frank Hill, and Glenn
Hughes.
Which students succeed in after
college work?
Top Students Succeed
Usually the best students con
tinue to be the best and the me
diocre continue to be mediocre. But,
failure in college is no indication
that a student cannot or will not
succeed afterward. Very often the
student who does not fit into col
lege regimentation progresses rap
idly when he finds a proper channel
for his energy."
"College students should feel an
obligation to society because of
their advantage in education. Too
often they accept the first road, or
the easiest i*oad open to them," ac
cording to Professor Bassett.
38 Years on Farm
He has spent 38 years teaching at
Stanford, years which he would not
change "for the world"—because he
loves to teach.
As an undergraduate contemplat
ing a medical career, he chose sci
ence courses until in ' an English
class one day he heard the instruc
tor's impressive oral interpretation
of a poem, and realized that here
was a new task: to teach others how
to read poetry with feeling and
meaning.
Speech Courses Open
So, Professor Bassett was prob
ably the first to have a speech
teaching career in California. Insti
tutions did not then offer instruc
tion for the development of speak
ing and dramatic faculties.
"No, development and training,
alone, will not make an actor. The
actor must possess an observing
eye, a gift of imitation, an emotion
al sensitiveness, and an imagina
tion. Sometimes by imagination
alone the actor can transport him
self into his part until he is prac
tically unaware that he is acting."
