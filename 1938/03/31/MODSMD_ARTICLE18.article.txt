# Cardinals Okay Drive Groups
## 131 Women Named To Committees 
### 
Setting some kind of record when
they placed on Convalescent Home
Drive committees every woman who
applied for a position, Cardinals last
night approved 131 appointments
made by committee chairmen.
Selection of the men who applied
for places on the various groups was
not approved because Bud Milligan
was unable to appear at the meeting
with the list of names.
After spending a few minutes in
reminiscent moaning over the lack
of time available for touring the
Campus when the group of Stephens
College women visited Stanford,
Cardinals moved ahead in its usual
efficient manner to execute the fol
lowing business:
The Pomona College Men's Glee
Club, in Palo Alto April 9 and on
the campus April 10 for a concert,
will be entertained by Cardinals at
a luncheon. Roy Thompson is in
charge.
Very irked at Ex Committee for
failing to notify them sooner, Cardi
nals voiced unofficial gripes, then
approved the appearance in several
free exhibitions of Charles Peterson,
world's champion biiliardist.
Mr. Peterson will be here Friday
from 12 o'clock to midnight. Again
Roy Thompson is making arrange
ments. Preliminary plans call for
two exhibitions, one in some frater
nity, and the other in one of the
men's halls. Conditions of the bil
liard tables will determine the lo
cales.
Masque Ball committee will meet
tonight to decide this year's theme.
Co-chairmen are Jan North and Don
Dewar; committeemen are Louise
McChrystal, Gretchen Gillespie,
Howard Naquin, Sid Rasmussen,
Andy Stojkovich, and Andy Shirey.
