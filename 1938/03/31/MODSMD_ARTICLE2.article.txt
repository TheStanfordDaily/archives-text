# 'Old Boy' Admits News Important
## 
### 
Realizing that frivolity and
humor is of but small import
in this day of realism, Bob
Hartmann, local funny-man,
sometimes facetiously called
"The Old Boy," has indirectly
admitted that to be a success
ful editor of Chappie one must
have a knowledge of news
writing.
He is taking a course in that
subject.
Arch foe of The Daily and its
cohorts, Hartmann has long
adopted a supercilious attitude
toward anything coni%*:ted
with newspapers.
However, Hartmann has set
a precedent. He has admitted
that the ability to write an
acceptable news story is not
acquired by clipping jokes
from the files.
The Daily welcomes Hart
mann into the field of jour
nalism.
