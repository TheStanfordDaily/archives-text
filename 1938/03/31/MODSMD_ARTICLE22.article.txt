# Former Stanfordite To Divorce Hindu

### 
Mrs. Frieda Hauswirth Das, for- |
mer Stanford student who wrote
"Marriage to India" as a result of
the culmination of her college ro
mance with Sarangather Das, a Hin
du who was attending Cal while she
was a student on the Farm, plans
actual "Divorce from India."
Her version of Kipling appears to
be, "If the twain shall meet, it shall
not meet for long." Mrs. Das was
married in Hawaii in 1917, at which
time she lost the American citizen
ship which she seeks to have re
stored.
The caste-system and the social
and cultui'al conflict it involves
doomed the marriage, and Mrs. Das
told newspapermen in San Francisco
this week she realized this almost
before her honeymoon was over.
Customs Difficult
Not only was she conspicuous for
appearing without heavy veiling and
for conversing with her husband and
other men, but she could not even
meet her mother-in-law, because
thereby the elder Mrs. Das would
"lose caste," the worst possible fate.
His people were very kind to her
indirectly, but dared go no further
than sending gifts.
Mr. Das was trying to start a su
gar plantation and they had to bribe
a cook to go with them into the
jungles.
It was soon obvious to Mrs. Das
that her presence was the cause of
the economic ruin her husband was
facing. The elders would not lend
him the money he needed to finance
his factory project and sugar plan
tation, and so she left.
Since that time, she has returned
to India several times, visiting her
husband, painting rural scenes, and
studying various problems of In
dia's people.
Both Happy Now
Readjustment for her, she feels,
will present no difficulties, and as
for her husband, she says, "He is
back with his people. The Hindu
law says he can have as many
wives as he can support. I wish
him happiness."
Mrs. Das' unusual romance is not
her only claim to fame. She is
known for her books on India and
is a fresco and portrait painter of
some repute.
