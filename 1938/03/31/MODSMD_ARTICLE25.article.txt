# Students Boost Youth Hostels
## Group Plans Saturday Party 
### 
In order to promote the idea of 1
Youth Hostelry on the campus, a
representative committee of Stan
ford students met yesterday to draw
up plans for a party to be held
Saturday night at the hostel at Hid
den Villa Ranch in Los Altos, oper
ated by Frank Duveneck, professor
of physics at Stanford.
The hostel is one of six which
have been established in Northern
California during the last year, and
is the usual starting point for Palo
Alto members.
The party is invitational and lim
ited to campus leaders and inter
ested students who will be given a
chance to inspect a Youth Hostel at
first hand. Any other Farmites not
already contacted who would be
particularly interested in the move
ment may make reservations by
calling Marion Theobald at Palo
Alto 3362.
Members of the steering committee
are as follows: Lorren Crawford,
Jeannine Latin, John Dern, Virginia
Clausen, Ted Hucklebridge, Gerry
Clift, Flora Martens, Estalyn Kreps,
and George Osborn Wilson, Jr.
This is the first of a series of trips
and hikes to be sponsored by the
Youth Hostel group on the campus,
which has rapidly grown in numbers
since its introduction to Stanfordites
last quarter.
Gerry Clift and John Dern were
appointed co-chairmen for an all
campus meeting to be held in the
near future, at which time colored
movies of Hostel activities in Europe
and America will be shown. A ski
ing trip to the Colfax Hostel over
Easter week-end is also being
planned.
