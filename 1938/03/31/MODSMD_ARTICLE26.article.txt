# Only 25 Tickets Left for Prom
## 
### 
Stanford's Senior Prom, breaking I
both tradition and habitual campus !
lethargy, yesterday was only 25
tickets short of a complete sell-out.
A1 Hyman, prom chairman, an
nounced last night that the 500-bid
limit set last quarter will not be
exceeded. He said that larger
dances in the past have often been
spoiled by over-crowding.
Remaining bids for the prom,
which is to be Friday night, are on
sale at the A.S.S.U office for $3.50.
