# Final Scenery Changes Made In Alumni Play
## 
### 
Surmounting complex technical
difficulties, Waldemar Johansen and
his crew of Memorial Hall techni
cians yesterday completed all scen
ery arrangements for Friday and
Saturday night's production of "Star
Wagon," Alumni dramatic vehicle.
Staging of the play involves ten
scenery shifts of the six complete
sets that have been designed by
Curtis Barnes. One set pictures a 30-
foot cliff, another a bicycle shop, still
another a choir scene with authentic
church organ, and one a "time ma
chine" designed by Mr. Johansen
that swings the action from 1937 to
1902.
On the two nights of the perform
ances, scenery will be moved on
rollers by a crew of 29 back-stage
workers.
Headed by Norman Nathanson, the
Alumni orchestra will go into final
rehearsal tonight for its important
part in the production. Nathanson,
a graduate of Stanford in 1922, has
appeared on NBC hook-ups as "Jess
Norman." First cornetist in the band
will be Charlie Bubb, old-time cam
pus orchestra leader who introduced
rag-time, predecessor of swing, to
Farm jitter-bugs in 1909.
The band has arranged a special
orchestration of song hits from 1902
to the present time. Selections will
include such modern tunes as "Man
hattan Moonlight" and "True Con
fession," such oldies as "Dardanella,"
which was the rage of the Farm in
1919, and "Alexander's Ragtime
Band," the original ditty that started
campusters to swinging about the
turn of the century.
