# Internationally Famed Dancers To Come Here
## Fowler and Tamara To Appear April 5 In Concert Series 
### 
Fowler and Tamara, dance team
which will appear in the Memorial
Theater April 5 as the Stanford Con
cert Series' last presentation of the
season, have appeared in all the
capitals of Europe and danced by
royal command for the kings of
Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Maharajah
of India, and request performances
for the Prince of Wales and Princess
Helena Victoria.
Exotic Dancing
''Mystic Persia," a new exotic ver
sion of modernistic dancing which
they are introducing this season, in
volves the movements of the cobra
and shows the religious beliefs of
oriental peoples.
In contrast is the formal "Gavotte"
which has as its background Ver
sailles and the court life of Fon
tainebleau; and through the music of
Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube
Waltz," they interpret the gaiety of
pre-war Vienna.
Still another angle on the "light
fantastic" is presented in their ter
psichorean satire, "The Debutante."
Critic Lauds Team
After seeing one of the team's
performances, an Eastern critic de
scribed their tangos thus:
"Their tangos were different in
theme. They first presented the
dance as it is danced on the conti
nent, sensuous and graceful. This
was in direct contrast to the tango as
presented in this country with exag
gerated movements, supposedly em
bodying the same steps, but done in
a distinctly American manner.
Tickets at $2.50, $2.00, and $1.50
may be obtained at the Stanford
Concert Office.
