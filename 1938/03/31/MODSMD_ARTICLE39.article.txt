"You Can't Take It with You,"
by George Kaufman and Muss
Hart, at the Geary Theater in San
Francisco.
Life with the Sycamores would
never be dull. Five minutes after
the curtain goes up at the Geary,
any play-goer can see that.
"You Can't Take It with You,"
chronicling the mad existence of the
Sycamore clan, is not a "social"
drama. It has no profound philoso
phy to expound. Rather, it seeks to
entertain, suggesting that the world
is really a pretty good place, if you
live as you please.
Typically Hart-Kaufman
Throughout the play one is con
stantly aware of little inconsisten
cies in the reasoning, but the mind is
too lazy to track them down. At
least, my mind was. But they don't
matter, for the characters continue
to do insane things and the dia
logue continues to crackle in the
inimitable Hart-Kaufman manner.
I'm not quite certain why "You
Can't Take It with You" won the

Pulitzer prize.]
Undoubtedly it is j
good "theater" |
and the lines are j
packed with clev
er quips. But;
why it should be
judged the best
play of 1936-37 is
more than I can
see. Probably its
gx-eatest claim to

fame lies in the sheer comedy of its
situations.
The cast, presenting the farce in
San Francisco is not particularly
noteworthy. Ethel Wilson as Pene
lope, who writes plays because
"someone delivered a typewriter
here by mistake eight years ago,"
submits a strong portrayal.
Clarence Oliver Capable
Old 'Martin Vanderhof is capably
acted by Clarence Oliver, though no
actor could fail with the sure-fire
lines provided the character who
walked out of his office 35 years
ago and never returned because he
wasn't doing what he wanted to do,
and he found "you can't take it j
with you."
Alice, the ingenue, is beautiful, I
and Tony, the young man, is blond
and built like a football player. Jo- j
seph Kallini, playing the role of I
Kolenkhov, the ballet teacher, walks (
away with many a scene. Support- I
ing spots are all adequately filled, ;
though no outstanding work is done. |
