# Plans for Field Day Under Way
## Axe Society Also Discusses Index File 
### 
Preliminary crystallization of plans
for the proposed Student-Faculty
Field Day, April 22, was made by
Axe Society, sponsors of the idea,
last night at the group's first meeting
of the quarter in Toyon lobby.
Also discussed were the plan for
the establishment of a cross-indexed
file of all Stanford activity men, as a
device to help prevent "gravy" ap
pointments, and aims and desires for
Axe Society's part in next fall's
Pre-Registration program.
Barbecue Planned
The Society juggled the Field Day
situation around and came up with
several tentative decisions. It is de
sired to hold the affair in the after
noon and early evening in the area
between the stadium and El Camino
Real. Various games, including soft
ball, three-legged and backwards
races, horseshoes, volleyball, and
others, would precede a barbecue
supper.
Various faculty members in rep
resentative departments will be con
tacted by Axemen to insure their
support of the project. The plan
would create a flexible affair in
which as many faculty members and
students as possible could join in
either games of a more strenuous
nature or in quiet competition, such
as horseshoes.
Second Meeting Set
The idea, according to Committee
Chairman Dick Riddell, is to stage a
get-together in which both sides of
the university can take off their coats
and ties and have some uncon
strained fun.
The society will hold its second
meeting under the new president,
Jack Calderwood, next Wednesday
night at Phi Delta Theta. More com
plete arrangements will be made
then, Chairman Riddell said.
