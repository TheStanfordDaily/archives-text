r track at Washington was a
little different from the surface
the Cards had been running on all
season, the athletes say . . . two
days before the meet the basketball
floor in the pavilion had been re
moved so that the meet could be
held on the track.
Unfortunately, there wasn't
enough time to work the field into
shape after its winter-long sleep
under the maple, and marks suf
fered. Runs' WuIIT couldn't get
much traction on the high jump
take-off, which was hurt worse
by the floor. lie cleared the win
ning height after competition had
closed, and then neither he nor
Vandermay, Husky jumper, could
make it one inch higher. Vander
may was slipping around then,
100. ,
According to Coach Dink Tem
pleton, the track itself was hard as
a brickbat. The runners had trouble
with the clods kicked up every
time somebody lifted his spikes. But
then Washington had to run on the
same track.

V/IRTUALLY nothing is known of
the capabilities of the Fresno
State team, which Stanford meets
in Fresno Saturday, since there have
been no publicity releases of any
sort sent to this region. The fact
t /ut the Fresnans could score only
27 points against U.S.C. may or may
not mean anything, because U.S.C.
is probably so strong that Fresno
wasn't trying.
However, they speak highly of Bev
Gubser, a hurdler, and a colored
sprinter named Nelson. Gubser took
second to Hawkins in the highs and
Weiershauser in the lows in the
meet on Angell Field last year, which
marks him as no slouch.
I lie I* resnaus claim Nelson won
the 100 over Payton Jordan of
Southern Cal last week, but the
judges thought differently. How
ever, it shows he was at least very
close to Jordan, who is assertedly
greatly improved over last year.
He did ail right last year, too,
even though he was just another
one of that myriad of Trojan
sprinters.

Outside of that, the Bulldogs ai'e
a question mark. Whether they
have a quarter miler who can ex
tend Ray Malott would be inter
esting to know, because stiff compe
tition could push him to fast time.
The Fresno track is well-liked by
Coast runners, and if it hasn't had
too much trouble with floods re
cently it should be fairly fast.
Ed Burrows, incidentally, will
probably run the half-mile in ad
dition to one of (he distance races.
The distance race will more like
ly be the mile, because the 880
immediately follows the two-mile.
Besides, Coach Templeton plans to
run Emmanuel and Ganahl as a
team in one of the distances, and
Burrows and March as a team in
the other. Emmanuel and Ganahl
are better at two miles, and March
is a better miler.
