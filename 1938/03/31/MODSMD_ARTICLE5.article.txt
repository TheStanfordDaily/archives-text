# Row Will Not Act On Dog Situation
## 
### 
No plans are being made by any
of the Farm fraternities to get their
dogs back on the campus.
The order from the Comptroller's
office ejecting them came, wisely
enough, during finals when students
were too busy to object strenuously
and just before vacation time. When
the fraternity men came back to the
campus, the dogs had been taken
away.
The order for their removal did
not come in the middle of a quar
ter when their removal would have
been dramatic. Now that the dogs
are gone, according to the Row
presidents, the fraternities intend to
accept the situation.
