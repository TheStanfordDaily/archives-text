# Malott Clocked In Record Time
## One Watch Lists Ace as World's Best 
### 
Giving indications that Dink Tem
pleton wasn't talking through his
hat when he predicted thai Ray Ma
lott would break the world's 440
mark this season, the Stanford flyer
was timed in a sensational 46.3 in
practice yesterday.
Templeton caught Malott at this
world record time, but Merv Wang
enheim, senior manager, clicked his
stopwatch on 48 flat. Captain Ray
beat Ernie Clark of the frosh by 33
yards. Clark was timed at 52.2.
"One of the watches was hay
wire," Templeton said last night,
"but we don't know which one it
was. However, if my time was cor
' rect Ray can break the record any
j lime he feels like it."
The present world mark of 4G.4 is
j held by Ben Eastman, former Farm
: ace, and was made around a single
I turn. Malott ran two turns yester
| day.
Ed Burrows, looking more like a
j champion every day, turned in a
i 4:27 mile and Rusty March did 4:31.
j Burrows is a notoriously poor prac
j tice runner but has been well under
| 4:30 on several occasions already this
â–  season. He won in 4:23.3 on Wash
ington's tiny indoor Pavilion last
week.
Stan Hiserman marked up a 9.9
century against the wind.
