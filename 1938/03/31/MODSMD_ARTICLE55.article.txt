# Alumni Coming of Age
## 
### 
WITH the bursting buds and the blooming
flowers in the field, Stanford's Alumni
Association is responding to the call of spring
with an unprecedented outburst of energy.
Alumni conventions in coast cities (pioneered
six years ago by Stanford), the coming produc
tion of "Star Wagon," the association's stage
debut, and drive upon drive for funds indicate
that the old boys are feeling their oats.
In this new high point of activity, Stanford's
alumni group is demonstrating that it is in the
second of three stages of growth. The first
of these might be called the sentimental, or
do-nothing, stage, followed by the do-something
period, and ending with the do-plenty-and
make-them-like-it era.
Because of small numbers and small incomes,
the first graduating classes can do little more
than hold an annual reunion, sing sentimental
songs, and generally clutter up the campus. The
first signs of life come with a few athletic schol
arships and a good deal of talk in local alumni
associations about "doing something for dear
old alma mater."
However, as the early grads begin to creep
into the upper income tax brackets, the alumni
become a potent factor in the financial set-up
of the university. And that is where Stanford
is today. Not an old university, it has taken
it until now to build up a sufficiently numerous
alumni body to hit the do-something stage.
The present rash of activity has been pre
ceded by the founding of Stanford Associates,
and the beginning of the increasingly impor
lant Stanford Fund. Alumni group membership
has increased rapidly, and with it, contributions
to Stanford finances.
In the first flush of the second stage, the
alumni have shown no signs of advancing on
to old age—the do-plenty-etc. era. That is the
time when enough money has been donated to
put the university under a gentleman's obliga
tion to the old boys, when more and more
strings are attached to the checks which come
in. With increasing numbers and increasing
financial support comes increasing pressure.
In fact, like old men, the old group often has to
dodge the ugly term of "meddler."
So far, the Stanford alumni can display a
clean shield. The athletic scholarship set-up
already has been established. Observers report
a laudable eagerness in the alumni to donate
money, free of limiting provisions, for truly
educational purposes. There has even been
some proselyting of scholars as well as athletes,
and this is definitely looking up.
What with '02 Oldsmobiles and Memorial
Hall productions, the campus, usually isolated
from alumni activities, is more and more feeling
their presence. It cannot help but applaud the
performance the old boys are giving in their
role of stokers to the financial boiler.
And the applause undoubtedly is increased
by the lack of any serious attempts of the
alumni to take the wheel of the Stanford ves
sel.—l. S.

is today. Not an old university, it has taken
it until now to build up a sufficiently numerous
alumni body to hit the do-something stage.
The present rash of activity has been pre
ceded by the founding of Stanford Associates,
and the beginning of the increasingly impor
lant Stanford Fund. Alumni group membership
has increased rapidly, and with it, contributions
to Stanford finances.
In the first flush of the second stage, the
alumni have shown no signs of advancing on
to old age—the do-plenty-etc. era. That is the
time when enough money has been donated to
put the university under a gentleman's obliga
tion to the old boys, when more and more
strings are attached to the checks which come
in. With increasing numbers and increasing
financial support comes increasing pressure.
In fact, like old men, the old group often has to
dodge the ugly term of "meddler."
So far, the Stanford alumni can display a
clean shield. The athletic scholarship set-up
already has been established. Observers report
a laudable eagerness in the alumni to donate
money, free of limiting provisions, for truly
educational purposes. There has even been
some proselyting of scholars as well as athletes,
and this is definitely looking up.
What with '02 Oldsmobiles and Memorial
Hall productions, the campus, usually isolated
from alumni activities, is more and more feeling
their presence. It cannot help but applaud the
performance the old boys are giving in their
role of stokers to the financial boiler.
And the applause undoubtedly is increased
by the lack of any serious attempts of the
alumni to take the wheel of the Stanford ves
sel.—l. S.
WITH the bursting buds and the blooming
flowers in the field, Stanford's Alumni
Association is responding to the call of spring
with an unprecedented outburst of energy.
Alumni conventions in coast cities (pioneered
six years ago by Stanford), the coming produc
tion of "Star Wagon," the association's stage
debut, and drive upon drive for funds indicate
that the old boys are feeling their oats.
In this new high point of activity, Stanford's
alumni group is demonstrating that it is in the
second of three stages of growth. The first
of these might be called the sentimental, or
do-nothing, stage, followed by the do-something
period, and ending with the do-plenty-and
make-them-like-it era.
Because of small numbers and small incomes,
the first graduating classes can do little more
than hold an annual reunion, sing sentimental
songs, and generally clutter up the campus. The
first signs of life come with a few athletic schol
arships and a good deal of talk in local alumni
associations about "doing something for dear
old alma mater."
However, as the early grads begin to creep
into the upper income tax brackets, the alumni
become a potent factor in the financial set-up
of the university. And that is where Stanford
is today. Not an old university, it has taken
it until now to build up a sufficiently numerous
