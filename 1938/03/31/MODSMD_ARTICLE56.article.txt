# Rush 'Em Through
## 
### 
WHENEVER an Interfraternity Council wants
a little indoor exercise it drags out a sub
committee screwdriver and starts to tinker with
the machinery of rushing. In past the enter
prising mechanics have either satisfied them
selves with tightening the bolts on a penalty
clause, or have wound up with a machine that
resembled Frankenstein's playmate.
But this year's Council is considering a plan
that would tune up the rushing system without
tearing it to pieces and letting Red Anarchy
stalk Lasuen. The proposal would reduce the
number of rushing periods in fall guarter to
three. The first would be an open house at all
fraternities. No meals would be served, and
the freshmen would be expected to visit all
houses sending cards, making a short stay at
each. In winter quarter there would be one
rush period, preference night, and pledging.
This will not make next year's rushing a gay
jolly-up. There will still be evenings that drag
by as though each minute had no place to go
and wanted to stay in the present. There will
be dinners as bleak as the Pilgrims' idea of
Heaven. But the proposed changes would make
it possible to run the rushing machine with a
little less cranking.
As it stands now the system is about as
clumsy as the tactics of a high school Casanova.

Comparatively it rates in the top bracket. It
gives the frosh and the houses a chance to meet
each other without giving an imitation of a
wolf pack closing up on a naive deer. But
despite its relative efficiency, our rushing sys
tem wouldn't even rate the approval of the
Rotary club in any decently run Utopia.
Both frosh and fraternity men complain that
the rushees miss houses where they would fit,
because they have to decline the first invitation.
Decreasing the number of rush periods and
instituting the open house for the first day
would take some of the worst sgueaks out of
our rushing machinery. It would leave plenty
of things for posterity to work on. But it would
permit us to pledge posterity without bank
rupting our self-control.—J. C.
