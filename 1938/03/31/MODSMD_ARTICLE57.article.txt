# BULL SESSION
## THE 						EXILE 
### 
'JPHOMAS MANN is a great man, no one will deny
that. He has been called "the greatest man of
letters," a verdict which will have to be passed upon
by history, but should stand without opposition. He
is a Nobel prize-winner. He is a symbol of liberalism
and free expression. And he is a forceful speaker,
even though his accent and excitement at times com
bine to render him unintelligible.
For these reasons he commanded a sizeable audi
ence in San Francisco's Memorial Opera House Tues
day night which received him with obvious sym
pathy, followed him intent/ly, and applauded him en
thusiastically when he hda done. For these reasons
his words have been given much space in the papers,
his picture has been published in many places, and
his ideas have been given every opportunity to circu
late through what he considers "the country which
carries the hope of democracy."
And yet he brought little that was new. He be
lieves in a program for simultaneously raising the
economic level of the masses and educating them in
the responsibilities of a democracy. He suggests a
democratic use of the new means of propaganda de
veloped by the dictatorial powers. He wants a social
readjustment within democratic processes to insure
the world against further encroachment from irre
sponsible force.
He hopes youth will be inspired with the great
ness of democracy. He comments on those aspects of
American life which might make dictatorship easy—
gangsterism, "lynch business," the Ku Klux Klan. He
a'dvocates a determined stand now, and strongly criti
cizes Britain for undermining the chances for peace.
He even upholds an absolute good and an absolute
bad, a theory he can make sound fairly plausible.
But all these things have been said before; and
it was not in them that the audience found the Thomas
Mann it had come to hear.

IT was rather in his aiblity to stand back and look
at his own country without patriotic prejudice;
his honest answer that if Germany had dictated the
peace of 1918 it would have been worse rather than
better; hu epigram on the Jew—"He is persecuted
because of his advantages—and his disadvantages";
his statement that America stood in far less danger
of dictatorship than any other country he had visited;
above all his honesty, his abundant faith in democ
racy, the democratic process liberty, and the ultimate
triumph of liberal thought.
For here, after all, was a man who had been
through the fire. He had been driven from his coun
try, he had been -stripped of his honors by a regime
unacquainted with honor, he had been villified, per
secuted, harried. He was no theorist sitting back in
smug complacency and spinning his webs of logical
illogic unrelated to human nature, but a man whose
books had been burned, whose home and peace had
been destroyed. This was the man, thoughtful, sincere,
and convinced of his message, who got up and said
that democracy was best nad would triumph.
Therein lies the value of Thomas Mann as a lec
turer, a man, and a symbol. Defeated, he has not lost
the will to fight.
