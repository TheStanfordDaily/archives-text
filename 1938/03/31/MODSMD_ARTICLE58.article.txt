r JpHE recent meeting on the campus of entomologists,
and the discussion of pests in conjunction there
with, reminds us that there are a few pests on the
radio which the boys might be able to do something
about.
In the first place, there arc the little people who
ring alarm bells early in the morning. Perhaps there
are lots of people who just toss and turn all night so
that they can spring from the covers at the first bong
of the gong. But not us. However, it is so seldom
that we are awake enough to turn on the radio at
that time in the morning that we aren't too worried
about the whole thing.
But at the same time, some spray might be devised
for the lads in the room below ours who (clever fel
lows) have rigged up an automatic radio-turner-on,
and set it by some demoniacal device so that it picks
up those early morning programs. They claim it
helps them to make 8 o'clocks. There may be some
thing in it. After a few minutes the only thing you
can do is get out of hearing. Of course, you might
turn off the radio. But then it's not our radio, re
member?

W/ r E might mention, en route down the day's pro
grams, those mid-morning soap serials, which con
stantly have old women being chased by gorillas.
But the only time we were really bothered by them
was once when we were sick, and had to listen to
the radio to pass the time.
As for personalities, the comedians who just kill
themselves at their own jokes could stand a good
dose of "Knock-'em-dead" as far as we're concerned.
However, they have to do something to counteract
that awful silence that follows some of their efforts.
But it is usually unnecessary. With the coming
of radio, a new species of mankind was born—pro
fessional stage audiences. They would laugh at their
own funeral. Most of them are women, with high
shrill voices. It is getting so they are forgetting their
place in the social class—they laugh all the time,
thus taking the star role in radio performances. Some
times they get to laughing at their own laughs, thus
confusing the comedians and the unfortunates who
happen to be listening to the program.
Enough of this, but if that woman with the laugh
like a fingernail down a blackboard doesn't stop gum
ming up every radio program we have listened to in
the last year, there is going to be a nasty murder trial
on the front page of the newspapers. Stone.
