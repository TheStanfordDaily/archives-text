# B.A.C. May Pick Bunn's Successor
## Candidates for Job Not Revealed; Gorter Considered Prospect 
### 
With choice of a successor to
Coach John Bunn as a possible item
of business, Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control tonight will hold
its first meeting since the end of
basketball season.
Mr. Bunn's appointment to the post
of Dean of Men, succeeding George
B. Culver, was disclosed last De
cember. At that time it was an
nounced that a director of basket
ball would not be appointed until
the end of the conference schedule.
Although candidates for the posi
tion have not been released, Frosh
Coach Wytze Goiter was mentioned
at the time Bunn's new appointment
was announced.
No Comment
However, Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
Director of the School of Physical
Education and Hygiene, last night
declined to say whether Gorter's
name would come up for discussion
in the meeting.
Admitting that there had been a
number of applicants, he said he had
"no comment" on the coaching situ
ation.
If Goiter is promoted to the var
sity, a man will have to be named to
take over his duties with the frosh.
Last fall, H. B. Lee, guard on this
year's championship team, was
named as a possible candidate for
the job.
Bunn May Advise
Other rumors at that time placed
Mr. Bunn in a general supervisory
capacity over the team next year,
but recent sentiment seems to indi
cate that the new coach will have
full control.
Budget estimates for next year's
sports program at the University will
be up for th<* Board's approval.
