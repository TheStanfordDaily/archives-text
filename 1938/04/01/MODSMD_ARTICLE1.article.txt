TEN DAYS the apparently |
irresistible Insurgent armies of
Spanish Generalisimo Francisco]
Franco advanced across the rugged i
mountains of Aragon, pushing the j
disorganized, demoralized and panic- J
stricken Loyalist troops back to j
Catalonia. It was "the last chapter j
of the war," the general boasted:
the seacoast, Barcelona, and victory
were ahead.
Yesterday the Rebels went too
far. Pushing boldly to the center j
of the smouldering city of Lerida, !
they expected that all Republican j
forces had been evacuated. From j
all sides, 15,00(1 Loyalists suddenly
opened fire and forced a hasty
Rebel retreat westward.
After being driven from the
city, the Insurgents were said, in
Barcelona dispatches, to have begun
a vast encircling operation around I
Lerida. Whether this tactic proves
successful or not, yesterday's vic
torious Loyalist ruse indicates that
morale has revived among the Re
publicans in that sector, that the I
sce-saw of Spain's civil war may I
return to an equilibrium.

|>REPAREDNESS and "absolute
independence" from interna
tional political entanglements were
suggested by former President Her
bert Hoover as "sound" American
foreign policy, in a nationally-broad
cast speech given last night to the
New York ouncil on Foreign Re
lations.
Mr. Hoover, recently returned
from a trip to 14 European na
tions, warned against joining a
democratic front of Britain and
France against Fascist dictator
ships. but at the same time
thought that it would be satisfac
tory to join "in the collective
moral forces to prevent war."
"If the world is to keep the peace
then we must keep peape with dic
tatorships as well as with popular
governments. The forms of govern
ment which other peoples pass
through in working out their desti
nies is not our business," he em
phasized.
Hoover reiterated his belief that
a general European war is not im
minent, since war preparations are
incomplete.

Formal opening of the new naval
race was heralded in an exchange
of notes between Washington and
London, announcing that the esca
lator clause of the 1936 London nav
al treaty will forthwith be invoked
for the construction of 43,000-ton
battleships. Japan has promised to
follow suit.

OECAUSE he had "neither the in
clination nor the qualifications,"
President Roosevelt early yesterday
denied that he aspired to be an
American dictator, in a letter de
fending the government reorganiza
tion bill.
A strife-torn House yesterday
commenced consideration of the
bill, with the President exerting
pressure to aid Administration
leaders in their plans to secure
passage of the bill by tomororw.
Under a one-hour-debate limit, a
Democratic - Republican coalition
opened their attack, upon basis of
a point of order. The possibility of a
lengthy filibuster similar to the one
that buried the anti-lynching bill
was seen by a few observers.

called "recession" exists "in the
minds of people," Chairman Jesse H.

its decline, Jones thought that once

Summary: The United States bat
