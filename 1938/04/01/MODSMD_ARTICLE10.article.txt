# Appeal Made For Senior Endowments
## ’22 Alumnus Outlines Flans, Purposes Of Fund Committee 
### 
Outlining an appeal to seniors for
contributions to the 1938 annual
Stanford Fund, Paul H. Davis, '22,
director of the Fund, stressed three
main sales points in a talk at the
Women's Clubhouse last night to
members of the Senior Endowment i
Committee, headed by George Ditz
Jr. and Rebecca Butts.
Contributions of the 800 members !
of the Senior Class, according to Mr. ;
Davis in sketching the line of appeal, j
will aid Stanford to maintain itself ■
as a private institution; will J
strengthen a tie between the grad- j
uating senior, the University, and
the "Stanford Family"; and will be
an aid to the University in a mate
rial way.
"The annual appeal for contribu- I
tions to the Stanford Fund is now
being conducted by mail among
nearly 30,000 alumni," Mr. Davis told
the group of representatives from
fraternities, sororities, eating clubs,
and dormitories, all of whom were
appointed this week.
"The appeal to the Senior Class is
to be a personal appeal.
"You agents are, after all, sales
men selling a product. That product
lis Stanford. We all agree it's a
| good product; otherwise we wouldn't
have spent four years here.
"In selling Stanford, we don't want
i to use high pressure," he said, in
1 explaining the mechanics of the ap
| peal. "We want every giver contrib
uting to the Stanford Fund to have
! the pleasure of voluntarily giving to
the University. Now the question is,
J why should a senior want to give
money to the Stanford Fund?
For one thing, we all wear the
' Stanford brand; it is an asset and
| we want to keep it an asset. At the
i present time, private universities are
j threatened with economic hardships
that approach disaster. Their earn
j mgs from endowment have decreased
while their cost of operations has in
creased. Stanford is one of these.
Here i.s a chance to help Stanford
stay up in front. Money alone will
keep it there.
"Another reason for participating
in the Stanford Fund is that by do
ing so we maintain a tie with the
University and the Stanford Family.
After graduation, those ties become
important; if no effort is made to
keep in touch, you will find that the
fine associations you have made here
have drifted away.
"A third reason for giving is that
thereby we get our names on the
list of those who are doing things
for Stanford. How much a contribu
tor gives is not published; it is a mat
ter between himself and the account
ing records."

"The appeal to the Senior Class is
to be a personal appeal.
"You agents are, after all, sales
men selling a product. That product
lis Stanford. We all agree it's a
| good product; otherwise we wouldn't
have spent four years here.
"In selling Stanford, we don't want
i to use high pressure," he said, in
1 explaining the mechanics of the ap
| peal. "We want every giver contrib
uting to the Stanford Fund to have
! the pleasure of voluntarily giving to
the University. Now the question is,
J why should a senior want to give
money to the Stanford Fund?
For one thing, we all wear the
' Stanford brand; it is an asset and
| we want to keep it an asset. At the
i present time, private universities are
j threatened with economic hardships
that approach disaster. Their earn
j mgs from endowment have decreased
while their cost of operations has in
creased. Stanford is one of these.
Here i.s a chance to help Stanford
stay up in front. Money alone will
keep it there.
"Another reason for participating
in the Stanford Fund is that by do
ing so we maintain a tie with the
University and the Stanford Family.
After graduation, those ties become
important; if no effort is made to
keep in touch, you will find that the
fine associations you have made here
have drifted away.
"A third reason for giving is that
thereby we get our names on the
list of those who are doing things
for Stanford. How much a contribu
tor gives is not published; it is a mat
ter between himself and the account
ing records."
Davis S. Jacobson, '28, assistant di
rector of the Fund, Ditz, and Miss
Butts were other speakers at the
meeting.
Outlining an appeal to seniors for
contributions to the 1938 annual
Stanford Fund, Paul H. Davis, '22,
director of the Fund, stressed three
main sales points in a talk at the
Women's Clubhouse last night to
members of the Senior Endowment i
Committee, headed by George Ditz
Jr. and Rebecca Butts.
Contributions of the 800 members !
of the Senior Class, according to Mr. ;
Davis in sketching the line of appeal, j
will aid Stanford to maintain itself ■
as a private institution; will J
strengthen a tie between the grad- j
uating senior, the University, and
the "Stanford Family"; and will be
an aid to the University in a mate
rial way.
"The annual appeal for contribu- I
tions to the Stanford Fund is now
being conducted by mail among
nearly 30,000 alumni," Mr. Davis told
the group of representatives from
fraternities, sororities, eating clubs,
and dormitories, all of whom were
appointed this week.
