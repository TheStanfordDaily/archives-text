Women of Stanford have
usurped one more of the tra
ditional rights of the Rough.
In addition to the Rough's los
ing the sole right to the wearing
of the campus trousers (witness
the feminine slacks), the co-eds
have begun to smoke exceed
ingly masculine piptes.
Throughout the halls of Rohle
and Union, wafts of good old
P.A. (adv.) from the best corn
cob pipes are perfuming the
air. One co-ed endorsed the
practice by saying the pipes
give a better smoke than cigar
ettes and, more than that, give
the women a chance to talk
about their latest pipe acces
sories.
"My best pipe is missing,"
muttered one harassed Rough,
"and I strongly suspect the girl
friend." He added bitterly,
"Several other fellows I know
have had the same experience."
