# Farm To See Famed Dancers
## Fowler and Tamara To Appear April 5 
### 
The dance team of Fowler and
Tamara, which last year spent nine
months on the continent, dancing in
Budapest, Copenhagen, Paris, and
many Italian cities, will appear in
the Memorial Theater Tuesday,
April 5.
Their dancing engagements led
them to many lands, giving them
an opportunity to study their
dances from authentic sources. The
gypsy dances come from the caves
of Sacro Monte above Granada and
the interpretation of "La Corrida"
contains characteristic movements
of the Picadors, Banderilleros, and
Matadors whom they observed in
Spain.
Costumes are a vital part of the
dances and are made so that entire
changes may be made in three to
five minutes.
Miss Tamara, who is a native of
San Francisco, was launched in her
dancing career by the advice of her
doctor, who suggested dancing
school because she was a "delicate"
child. After having become the star
of the school she studied with the
Russian Ballet, constantly imitating
Anna Pavlowa, who was her ideal.
When she combined her talents
with Addison Fowler, he became her
husband as well as her dance part
ner.
He developed into a stage per
sonality fairly recently, having be
gun his career as a ballroom dancer.
In addition to recital appearances
Fowler and Tamara have been fea
tured by C. B. Cochran in London
and in stage shows of Paris and
Broadway.
The Stanford Concert Oflice has
j tickets for the performance on sale
for $2.50, $2, and $1.50.
