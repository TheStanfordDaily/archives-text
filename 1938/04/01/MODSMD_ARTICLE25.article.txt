# Drunks To Be Exhibited in Cage
## 
### 

IF YOU GET DRUNK in Woburn, Mass., they put you in this cage
and tow it around the city behind police cruising cars. The new
punishment was designed and is exhibited by Mayor William Kane,
left, who believes public shame will reduce the number of intoxica
tion ca: es.
