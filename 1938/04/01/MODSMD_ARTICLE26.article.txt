# Glee Clubs To Give Operetta in May
## 
### 
The men's and women's glee clubs
I will combine to present an operetta,
j "Coffee Cantata," the second week
jin May. The cast is not complete as
I parts for one soprano, one tenor,
'and one bass are still unclaimed.
Professor Kendall will be in his
office from 1 to 3:30 o'clock this
afternoon to hear all those who
might be interested in trying for
these parts. There are also a few
chorus parts for which students may
try at the same time.
