# Future War Vets Plan Memorials
## 
### 
With the statement. "As Memorial
Day is a day for looking backwards,
Peace Day should be a day for look- 1
ing forward," Marco Thorne, Chap- I
pie funny-man, announced yester
day to The Daily that he thought it
about time that the Collegiate As
sociation for Future Memorials;
emerged from the confusion of his
brain.
Conceived last Washington's Birth
day, the association will be founded
to draw up plans for a memorial to
the college students killed in the
j next war.
So far, the movement has not
1 passed from the stage of a whisper
; ing campaign, but its originator re
. ports that a small group has already
I been brought together in an unoffi
| cial, personal-contact campaign.
"We are not demanding, advocat
ing, or circulating petitions," he said.
"We are only suggesting."
Memorials which have been con
sidered for the future college can
non-fodder include a Memorial Beer
Garden, Memorial Path to Beltra
mo s, and most probably a set of
good, substantial Memorial Gates.
Plans are already being drawn up
for such a memorial by a prominent
architect, Thorne said.
"College students are spending a
good $5,000 preparing themselves for
a life which they will never live.
The least they can do is to die with
the knowledge that they will have
j a fitting memorial."
