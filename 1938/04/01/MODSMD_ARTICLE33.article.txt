# Audiences For 'Kind Lady’ To Be Limited
## Experiment Attempts 'Intimate' Effect By Small Stage 
### 
To accommodate only a small
audience, the Memorial Hall bal
co) y curtain will be dropped to the
lloor for the first time in a major
show for the forthcoming produc
tion of ' Kind Lady," Director H.
Miles Heberer said yesterday.
'"We're doing it as an experiment
to find out if a play of a more in
timate nature can be produced in a
large theater," he said.
"I myself prefer the large stage
for several reasons —it offers more
opportunities for subtle lighting ef
fects so the boys at the board can
get some training."
"Too, a large stage preserves the
illusion of the theater which you
don't get when the actors are prac
tically on top of the audience.
'But, on the other hand, 'Kind
Lady' presents difficulties in pro
jection. In the old days, melodrama
like this was hammed—the villain
leered and twirled his moustaches;
the heroine sighed and quaked. But
Walpole's play takes a more sub
tle, psychological interpretation. Its
characters are psychopathic cases."
'Tn order to take advantage of
the benefits of the large stage and
yet to preserve the atmosphere for
horror, we're using only the first 20
rows of seats."
The play will be presented April
14, 15, and lfi, and stars Kay Camp
bell and Hal Kahn. Tickets, which
must be reserved, according to
Chester Barker, Memorial. Hall sec
retary, will be on sale at 50 cent?
apiece in the office of Memorial Hall
