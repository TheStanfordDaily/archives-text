# Ski Club Plans Week-end Trip To Yosemite
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Ski Club
will continue .spring skiing, which is ,
better than winter skiing, by spend- |
ing this week-end in Yosemite.
The main attraction of the week
end will be the invitational .ski meet '
to he held by the Yosemite Winter
Club, in which the Stanford Club !
will compete. Members of the Cali- i
fornia, Auburn, and Cisco teams will
also participate.
The course for the down-hill sla
lom will be particularly fast and a
new record may be made.
As gui: t of the meet and of spe
cial interest to skiiers is the Bava
rian ski coach against whose team
Stanford competed two weeks ago.
The top skiier of the Bavarian
team won the international down
hill race two weeks ago at Sun Val
ley. He will probably attend Stan
lord next year ori a scholarship do
nated by the Ski Club. If he comcs,
some fit' the fraternities on the cam
pus will help him. His services will
be given to the Ski Club at Yosemite
a.s he will coach the Stanford team.
