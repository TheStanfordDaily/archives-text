# April Fools Find Farm Fun Feeble
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Today is All Fools' Day.
Our ancestors, if you go back far
! enough, believed in April Fools' Day.
| They thought that on the first day
; <>f April you could see, without really
I looking, fools making fools of them
selves.
Later, when they were wiser, they
started helping the fools be obvious,
j They invented cute tricks to make
j them ridiculous. Everyone did it,
j and before the day was over every
| one, excepting the kings perhaps,
| had been proved a fool.
It was democratic. It was jolly.
; Everyone had fun. In grammar
school, kids still believe in April
Fools' Day.
But not on the Farm. Stanford
people are too blase or too lethargic
for anything that takes as much en
ergy as April Fool tricks do. Or
! perhaps it's that they're so self
j conscious; they're too busy waiting
| to have tricks played on them to try
to fool anyone else. That way every
one gets looled—but not in the way
i they expect.
What we need on the Farm is a
really good April Fools' Day. Like
having an earthquake. When it
j comes you can say to the woman
I next you in class (if you don't al
] ready know her it's a good way to
; get acquainted), "Look, the roof's
falling in."
She'll just look at you in scorn
and mutter something about little
boy—until the roof does fall and
hit her. Then you yell, "April fool,"
or something. That's the v/ay it
should be done.
Or the seniors could announce,
sometime otday, that the Eddy Du
chin who's playing at. the prom is a
different Eddy Duchin -and then
prove it. That would fool it lot of
i people.
What we need is something big.
Stanford should be better known for
i its April Fools.
