# Pest Control Operators Hold Final Meeting
## Three Discuss Legal, Chemical, Historical Aspects of Problem 
### 
At the last meeting of the Pacific
Coast Pest Control Operators Con
ference at Jordan Hall yesterday
morning, three .speakers discussed
the chemical, legal, and historical
aspects of the pest control operator's
business.
Dr. Alvin J. Cox, chief of the Di
vision of Chemistry, State Depart
ment of Agriculture, speaking on
"The Economic Poisons Law and Its
Relation to the Pest Control Opera
tor," told the assembled operators
that a pest control operator's license
does not authorize the manufactur
ing or mixing of economic poisons
or the sub-packaging of registered
products.
L. R. Alderman of the Alderman
Company, Pasadena, gave a short
outline of the history of commer
cial pest control in California, and
predicted that in the future pest
control operators will be known as
professional men. He spoke of the
various insect control methods and
told of the recent effective use of
gases in vacuums on insects found
in closed places such as packaged
food.
"Chemistry and Modern Insecti
cides Used in Pest Control" was the
topic discussed by Dr. W. M. Hos
kins, department of entomology,
University of California. Dr. Hos
kins stressed the need of closer co
operation between entomologists and
chemists in the work of pest eradi
cation, stating that men with more
training based on the physical
rather than the chemical side were
needed for the work.
"Although the history of general
commercial control is not more than
20 years old, scientific men are al-
I ready looking on our efforts with
| more appreciation," one of the
j speakers said in speaking of the
progress made in pest control.
