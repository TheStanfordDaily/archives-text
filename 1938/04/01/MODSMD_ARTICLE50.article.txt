jVOT quite correct was the state
ment in yesterday's Daily to the
effect that Roy Vitousek, one of the
most brilliant freshman swimmers
the university has ever had, broke
one university and two freshman
swim records in the San Mateo J. C.
meet Wednesday
t More pertinent is the information
that Vitousek's 2:33.2 in the 200-
yard breaststroke constitutes a new
national intercollegiate freshman
record for the distance. Also, his
24.6 for the 50,-yard free-style is a
new national frosh mark — Yale
claimed a new mark for one of its
freshmen a couple of weeks ago, at
24.7.
The national frosh record for
the breaststroke race formerly
was up around 2:57, acocrding to
Coach Nort Thornton. Vitousek
has broken it several times in
practice, but this was the fir>>t race
he has ever bad in outside compe
tition. When you consider that
Thornton's charge never swam a
200-breast until he came out for
swimming at Stanford, and (hat
be hasn't been out for very long
yet, you can see that this kid is
little short of a nine days' wonder.
There is a distinct possibility that
Thornton could develop this swim
mer into a national champion at the
300-yavd individual medley. If
Vitousek can swim 100 yards back
stroke two-thirds as well as he can
whip out the breaststroke and free
style, he is a potential champion.

'ALIFORNIA, proud possessor of
* a fine 145-pound basketball
team, is now working on the idea
of having a 150-pound football team.
Their major difficulty, outside of
procuring money for equipment and
coaching, is getting competition
lined up.
Desired for membership in a coast
league is, among othe'r leading con
ference schools, Stanford. The Cal
ifornians, though, would be bucking
a lot of tough arguments against the
establishment of the sport here if
they approached B.A.C. officials.
Possibly most important is the
mone.\ matter — equipping a 150
team and sending it on trips would
involve a lot of money, and every
coach has to light to get all the
money he needs now.
A little more fundamental is the
consideration that such a sport
v r o,ild leave Stanford at a distinct
disadvantage, in competing with
schools like California. The ath
letes that come to Stanford are not
men that play on small teams. They
must necessarily be good enough,
big enough to play on varsities.
Stanford, with a student body rough
ly one-third as large as Cal's and
competing in the same varsity ath
letic eompC'ition, cannot afford to
deal with ath'etes for limited sports.
The question of school valor
doesn't enter into the situation—
if Stanford were to put a 150-
pound football team on the field
it wouldn't be a team that could
be accused of cowardice. But it
-would be plain suicide for Stan
lord to it y to compete with schools
possessing twice, thrice, or even
five times the material with which
to work.
There i.s enough athletic activity
on the Farm to occupy virtually all
the actively interested in this fairly
small student body. The few that
happer to have grown into slightly
smaller specimens than are neces
sary tor varsity football competition
or other varsity play are just in a
difficult situation. There isn't much
that can be done about it—through
no fault ol their own they are pro
hibited from certain athletics, but
who is to give a workable solution?
There hasn't been one suggested
yet.
