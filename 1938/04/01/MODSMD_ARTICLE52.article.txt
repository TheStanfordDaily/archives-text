# Cards Make Outdoor Bow Tomorrow
## Question-Mark Squad Will Face First Test Against State Team 
### 
Stanford's question-mark track
team makes i's 1938 outdoor debut ;
tomorrow afternoon when Coach ;
Dink Templeton takes a squad of
28 men to Fresno to meet Coach
Flint Hanner's Fresno State out- ]
fit.
The Indians scored an unofficial
victory in the Pacific Association
meet held earlier in the year, and
last week trounced Washington, 76-
60, in the Huskies' Pavilion. How
ever, both these affairs were indoor
meets. Tomorrow the Cards hit the
w.'de open spaces, competitively
speaking, for the first time.
The Bulldogs, losers to Southern
California's powerful aggregation
last Saturday by an overwhelming !
107-24 score, don't figure seriously
to extend the Injuns, but several in
dividual stars might make it hot for
Stanford in their individual events.
. ommy Nelson, colored sprinter,
is a streak of lightning in the cen
tury and figures to beat Stan Hiser
man at this distance. However,
Hiserman is too powerful for Nel
son in the furlong and if the Farm j
flyer runs the longer race, he should
nab an easy verdict. Hiserman may
run the low hurdles instead of the I
220.
High Jump Battle
John Croson is expected to give
Stanford's Russ Wulff a whale of a
battle in the high jump and the win
ner should bo up around 6 feet, 5
inches.
Bill Gill, a 1:57 half-miler, i.s an
other Bulldog threat, as is Everhard
Jones, who tosses the javelin around
130 feet. Eldridge Rice in the two
mile completes the list of Bulldog
stars.
The spotlight will undoubtedly be
focused on the quarter-mile, in
which Captain Ray Malott takes oft' j
against a poor field. Templeton j
piedicted that Malott would break !
the world record in Stanford's first j
outdoor meet of the season "if con- j
dition were right."
Last Wednesday in practice Ma
lott ran a disputed 46.3, which is j
world record time, and is especially j
sensational considering that he ran
two curves doing it. A second watch
caught him at 48 flat. Yesterday
Malott tried to see what lie could do
running a single turn. Three watches
caught him at .the same time, 48
flat.
Lineup Undecided
Coach Dink Templeton is unde- |
cided as to just what events to run j
his men in, and the lineup for to- I
morrow is highly tentative. For in- j
stance, Hiserman will run the 100 !
and either the 220 or low hurdles; !
Carl Mahurin and Craig William
son may each run either the 440 or j
880; Ed Burrows is a possibility in
either the 880 or the two-mile, be- J
side? his regular mile assignment.
Burrows is another man who will
be watched with interest. He is one
of the biggest question-marks of a
dark-horse team, but he is capable
of beating any distance man on the
Coast, including Stan Sadaj of Cali
fornia, who nipped him by less than
a foot in the Pacific Association
meet, and Louis Zamperini, highly
touted U.S.C. flash.

against a poor field. Templeton j
piedicted that Malott would break !
the world record in Stanford's first j
outdoor meet of the season "if con- j
dition were right."
Last Wednesday in practice Ma
lott ran a disputed 46.3, which is j
world record time, and is especially j
sensational considering that he ran
two curves doing it. A second watch
caught him at 48 flat. Yesterday
Malott tried to see what lie could do
running a single turn. Three watches
caught him at .the same time, 48
flat.
Lineup Undecided
Coach Dink Templeton is unde- |
cided as to just what events to run j
his men in, and the lineup for to- I
morrow is highly tentative. For in- j
stance, Hiserman will run the 100 !
and either the 220 or low hurdles; !
Carl Mahurin and Craig William
son may each run either the 440 or j
880; Ed Burrows is a possibility in
either the 880 or the two-mile, be- J
side? his regular mile assignment.
Burrows is another man who will
be watched with interest. He is one
of the biggest question-marks of a
dark-horse team, but he is capable
of beating any distance man on the
Coast, including Stan Sadaj of Cali
fornia, who nipped him by less than
a foot in the Pacific Association
meet, and Louis Zamperini, highly
touted U.S.C. flash.
Stanford's question-mark track
team makes i's 1938 outdoor debut ;
tomorrow afternoon when Coach ;
Dink Templeton takes a squad of
28 men to Fresno to meet Coach
Flint Hanner's Fresno State out- ]
fit.
The Indians scored an unofficial
victory in the Pacific Association
meet held earlier in the year, and
last week trounced Washington, 76-
60, in the Huskies' Pavilion. How
ever, both these affairs were indoor
meets. Tomorrow the Cards hit the
w.'de open spaces, competitively
speaking, for the first time.
The Bulldogs, losers to Southern
California's powerful aggregation
last Saturday by an overwhelming !
107-24 score, don't figure seriously
to extend the Injuns, but several in
dividual stars might make it hot for
Stanford in their individual events.
. ommy Nelson, colored sprinter,
is a streak of lightning in the cen
tury and figures to beat Stan Hiser
man at this distance. However,
Hiserman is too powerful for Nel
son in the furlong and if the Farm j
flyer runs the longer race, he should
nab an easy verdict. Hiserman may
run the low hurdles instead of the I
220.
High Jump Battle
John Croson is expected to give
Stanford's Russ Wulff a whale of a
battle in the high jump and the win
ner should bo up around 6 feet, 5
inches.
Bill Gill, a 1:57 half-miler, i.s an
other Bulldog threat, as is Everhard
Jones, who tosses the javelin around
130 feet. Eldridge Rice in the two
mile completes the list of Bulldog
stars.
The spotlight will undoubtedly be
focused on the quarter-mile, in
which Captain Ray Malott takes oft' j
against a poor field. Templeton j
piedicted that Malott would break !
