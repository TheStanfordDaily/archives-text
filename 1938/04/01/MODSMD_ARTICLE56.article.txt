### 
Pulling up from behind to barely
nose out a slugging San Mateo J. C.
team, the freshman base bailers won
a 6-5 victory yesterday in a spark
ling game that went three overtime
periods.
Hero of the tilt was Howard 'Babe'
| Ruth, who knocked Boh Ditlevson,
| newly acquired outfielder, across
J the piate with the winning run. The
j tally came late in the last half of
i the eleventh inning after both
! teams had been fighting to gain a
I lead for three cantos.
Thompson Stars
I Also assuming the hero role was
I Pitcher "Cootie" Thompson, who
| took the plate late in the third inn
; in'g when Monte Plyl faltered and
! let five San Mateo runs slip in. With
. a full game Tuesday already under
his - belt, Thompson held the J. C.
i hitters to a few scattered hits.
Pfyl more than redeemed himself,
| however, when late in the eighth
J inning with the bases loaded, his
j two-bagger forced two men across
the plate with the tying markers.
Taking over from Perin Fay in
the third inning, Claude Purkitt
turned in a beautiful game behind
the plate, showing himself as a se
rious threat for a first-string berth
during the series with the Cal Cubs.
Also playing a bang-up game for
I the frosh was Harlan Harbke, lanky
first baseman. Pfyl, who shifted to
• second after his demise in the pitch
, er's box, turned in his usual steady
i game there.
San Mateo Strong
For San Mateo, three pitchers took
the box to allow the frosh nine scat-
I tered hits. Playing steady ball
! throughout the entire game, the
j Jaysee outfit came within an ace of
i copping top honors.
Tomorrow afternoon the frosh
i squad will meet Alameda High
School at 2:30 o'clock on the fresh -
j man diamond.
