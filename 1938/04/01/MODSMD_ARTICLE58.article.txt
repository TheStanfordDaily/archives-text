With no heavy contact work sched

Tiny Thornhill is continuing drill in
fundamentals and plays as spring
football ends its first week.
All the standout members of next
fall's squad have escaped nemesis
by the bawl-out although several
players garnered incompletes which
will hamper their grid workouts.
Jack Clark has been on the absent
list because ol back work but he is
expected to join the squad as soon
as he makes up a course.
Thornhill intends to scrimmage
next week in order to give the minor
lights of the aggregation a chance
to show their wares before a host of
the more established luminaries re
port from baseball and track.
The backfield men especially have
been performing in mid - season
fashion.
