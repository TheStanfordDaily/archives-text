# Varsity Mermen Meet Fullerton J.C. Today
## 
### 
A strong I*ulierton Junior College swimming squad invades Encinu
Pools this afternoon at 1 o'clock for a meet with (lie Stanford varsity.
tomorrow the Indian varsity and frosh will compete in a tri-way battle
with the Athens Club of Oakland in the local pools. The first race is
scheduled for 2:."{() o'clock.
Fullerton J.C. has a formidable aggregation that has already trounced
both U.C.I-.A. and the Los Angeles A.C. They are especially strong in the

medley relay and in the back stroke
with Ken McNichols. Bob Sellars is*
a free style artist who should press
Clarke, Vibert, and Brahtz of Nort
Thornton's squad.
Stanford goes into the two meets
with the strongest squad of the sea
son. With the return to eligibility of
Jack Vibert and Hall Weatherbe's
rejoining of the team, the Indians
stand a fair chance of defeating all
but one of their remaining opponents.
The meet Saturday with the Oak
land squad will probably develop
into a battle between the frosh and
the varsity. Since the clubmen have
already suffered a one-sided defeat
by the varsity men, they are not
being counted upon lo upset either
of the other squads.
If the frosh hadn't lost Chuck Wi
per because of scholarship, they
might comt close to upsetting their
older brothers. Roy Vitousek can
win almost as many races as he
enters and Bill Weeden is a sure
thing in the back stroke, but the
yearlings lack depth.
Vibert is set lor his first meet of
the season. He is capable of :54 flat
in the 100-yard free style when he
is in shape. Captain Dave Rider is
hack from his place-winning race in
the National Intercollegiate cham
pionships and will duel with his All —
American twin. Win Needham, in the
220- and 440-yard free style events.
Another fast event will pit Vitou
sek in the breast stroke against Don
1 owne of tlie varsity. Towne has a
reputation for being one of the fast
est short distance submarine artists
in the conference, but Vitousek has
already erased Towne's records and
will undoubtedly be out to beat him
in person.
Ihe I reshmen could also muster
together relay teams which would
upset the varsity. However, Thorn
ton probably v/ill not exert his two
champions too strenuously.
Both ihe meets are free and open
to the public.

Ihe I reshmen could also muster
together relay teams which would
upset the varsity. However, Thorn
ton probably v/ill not exert his two
champions too strenuously.
Both ihe meets are free and open
to the public.
A strong I*ulierton Junior College swimming squad invades Encinu
Pools this afternoon at 1 o'clock for a meet with (lie Stanford varsity.
tomorrow the Indian varsity and frosh will compete in a tri-way battle
with the Athens Club of Oakland in the local pools. The first race is
scheduled for 2:."{() o'clock.
Fullerton J.C. has a formidable aggregation that has already trounced
both U.C.I-.A. and the Los Angeles A.C. They are especially strong in the

medley relay and in the back stroke
with Ken McNichols. Bob Sellars is*
a free style artist who should press
Clarke, Vibert, and Brahtz of Nort
Thornton's squad.
Stanford goes into the two meets
with the strongest squad of the sea
son. With the return to eligibility of
Jack Vibert and Hall Weatherbe's
rejoining of the team, the Indians
stand a fair chance of defeating all
but one of their remaining opponents.
The meet Saturday with the Oak
land squad will probably develop
into a battle between the frosh and
the varsity. Since the clubmen have
already suffered a one-sided defeat
by the varsity men, they are not
being counted upon lo upset either
of the other squads.
If the frosh hadn't lost Chuck Wi
per because of scholarship, they
might comt close to upsetting their
older brothers. Roy Vitousek can
win almost as many races as he
enters and Bill Weeden is a sure
thing in the back stroke, but the
yearlings lack depth.
Vibert is set lor his first meet of
the season. He is capable of :54 flat
in the 100-yard free style when he
is in shape. Captain Dave Rider is
hack from his place-winning race in
the National Intercollegiate cham
pionships and will duel with his All —
American twin. Win Needham, in the
220- and 440-yard free style events.
Another fast event will pit Vitou
sek in the breast stroke against Don
1 owne of tlie varsity. Towne has a
reputation for being one of the fast
est short distance submarine artists
in the conference, but Vitousek has
already erased Towne's records and
will undoubtedly be out to beat him
in person.
