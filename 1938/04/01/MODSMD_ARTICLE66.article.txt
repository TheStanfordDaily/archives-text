# Classes To Referee At Net Matches
## 
### 
Members of tennis classes 121 and
121 X and the elementary tennis
j class should report to Freshman
Coach Bugge at 1 o'clock today to
officiate at the varsity and frosh
matches, according to Manager Ed
Barnett.
An unexpected change in schedules
finds the varsity and frosh playing
at the same time and Barnett asks
that "every member of these classes
be on hand for the matches today."
