# Move On, Buddy
## 
### 
THERE was a senior fuming around the office
not long ago who wanted somebody's head
on a charger because his soul had just been
seared and his life blighted. It seems that one
night recently he took a charming maiden out
to look at the stars. On the way back he
stopped for a while on a road behind the cactus
garden to talk philosophy and literature.
The conversation was proceeding nicely and
the subtle witchery of the night was working
as though it had just been overhauled, when a
car pulled up. An official voice told the seeth
ing senior to move on—no night parking per
mitted.
The senior was annoyed. He felt that being
moved on was a definite bar to the communion
of kindred souls.
V/e looked into the matter yesterday and
found that the plaintiff had at least told nothing
but the truth. Campus patrolmen have instruc
tions to prevent parking in secluded spots after
dark. Nobody hears much about it, but the rule
has been on the books for as long as the cops
remember.
It saddens us considerably to learn of this
fungus on the tender flower of Romance. But
there doesn't seem to be much to do about it.
Campus officers explain with depressingly
sound logic that the rule is for the students'
good. It prevents the danger of hold ups and
keeps car-thieves from using the campus as a
convenient place to strip their booty. It stops
outsiders from holding a bacchanale in Stan
ford's groves. It's all very logical.
But Romance is illogical. And when two
hearts are beating time to a celestial tune it
doesn't sweeten the interruption to know that
they might be car-thieves. Somehow it doesn't
seem quite fair to open fire on the underworld
when Cupid is an innocent bystander.
But law must prevail and the world must be
kept safe for happily married Babbits who stay
home evenings because the baby has colic. If
Romance happens to get in the way, the Babbits
repaint the no-parking signs. Such is our civili
zation.
There is nothing to do about it but buy a good
road map.—J. C.
