# Boathouse Blues
## 
### 
IT'S not 100 noticeable in springtime around
Lagunita, when girls in bathing suits, and the
hills and flowers attract your attention, but some
time when there's nothing else to do take a look
at the boathouse, a good look. Boy it's awful.
Without the lake to distract your attention, as in
the fall and early winter, you had better not
look at all.
While wandering around the campus, show
ing Stanford off to father, you can point with
pardonable pride at the buildings and the plant
ing. But give him his look at the lake from the
west side, when the glare of the sun makes the
ramshackle barn across the lake a mere haze.
It s certainly not one of the most pressing
construction problems around Stanford, but it is
time that something were done about the prize
campus eyesore. In last year's campaign for a
nitery, one of the reasons for dinging a trial
dance in the boathouse was that it might shake
down. Perhaps that's a little far-fetched; you
can probably go on the assumption that if it has
stood as long as this, it can last just about for
ever.
A modest building, inexpensive and yet ade
guate to the purpose, is far within the bounds
of feasibility. Until plans could be drawn up,
any estimates would be mere shots in the dark,
but rough guesses don't place a figure which
compares very favorably with the war debt.
Still, the problem of financing, even on a small
scale, is a tough nut to crack.
But right now, it's not what is done that is
worrying us as much as the hope that whatever
it is, it will be done soon. Perhaps even a coat
of paint might help.
Because one of these fine fall guarters, the
frosh, building their bonfire in the lake bed,
are going to be a little short of ready fuel.
Someone is going to look absent-mindedly at
the boathouse, and then at the others. After a
short mutual exchange of glances there will be
a general movement to the east which will
result in the biggest pyre ever. And that is as
much a hope as a prophecy. I. S.
