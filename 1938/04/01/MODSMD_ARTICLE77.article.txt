A S : TIME goes on and his program runs into va
rious snags and hindrances, furtive economic roy
alists who have been hiding undox piles of old bonds
show an ungrateful tendency to come out and criti
cize their President in no uncertain terms. Occasion
ally some earnest soul even goes so far as to ask him
outright what he plans to do, thereby breaking all
the rules of the game and throwing the White House
into a metry uproar.
The latest of these direct questions concerned the
President's desire to make himself a dictator: did he
have such a desire, and if so what about it? This is
not a very fair question to ask under any circum
stances of anybody, because it assumes a pretty un
friendly attitude on the part of the questioner and a
rare truthfulness on the part of the questionee; but
Mr. Roosevelt, seizing the opportunity to clarify a
vexing point, answered it.
No, he said, he has no inclination to be a dicta
tor. This showed commendable frankness from the
person who is, after all, the most concerned in the
matter; and coming from the Chief Executive it
should have been enough to answer any such ques
tion.
But he went on, much too modestly. "I have none
of the qualifications which would make me a success
ful dictator." This underestimation of great executive
ability, the best speaking voice in America, and the'
handsomest presence in public office, was unprecedent
ed but nice.
And he concluded by saying, "I have too much,
historical background and too much knowledge of
existing dictatorships to make me desire any form of
dictatorship for a democracy like the United Slates."
This recognition of the tradition of public service
which surrounds his family drove home his final point,
designed to give the lie to those who feel that en
vironment is sometimes stronger than heredity.
that the President's views on the matter come
to an end. From the sounding-board of a letter
to the Senate concerning the Reorganization Bill, they
have reached the press, gone through the land, and
may now be accepted as a definitive statement of
policy.
If the gentleman who asked the question in the first
place feels that there is a little too much use of the
pronoun "I"—"I have no inclination," *'I have none of
the qualifications," "I have too much historical back
ground ... to make me desire any form of dictator
ship for a democracy like the United States"—if he
thinks there is a little too much equivocation, too
much dependence on "my" own personal feelings and
failure -to acknowledge that the people might possibly
have something to say in the matter, that is probably
due to his innate inability to accord the President
any sincerity whatsoever:
Ihe President has closed the discussion, once and
for all, clearly and without quibble. A busy man, he
has given thought and energy to answering a ques
tion whose impertinence would have justified him per
fectly in disregarding it. And in so doing he has given
his country a very reassuring feeling.
It is good to know, in these times of toil and
trouble, these days of worry and woe, that Mr. Roose
velt is graciously pleased to preserve for America her
democratic form of government. It is things like that
which restore one s faith in Groton, Harvard, the
Right Thing, and the humility of the President of the
United States.

Ihe President has closed the discussion, once and
for all, clearly and without quibble. A busy man, he
has given thought and energy to answering a ques

fectly in disregarding it. And in so doing he has given
his country a very reassuring feeling.
It is good to know, in these times of toil and
trouble, these days of worry and woe, that Mr. Roose

democratic form of government. It is things like that
which restore one s faith in Groton, Harvard, the

outright what he plans to do, thereby breaking all
the rules of the game and throwing the White House
into a metry uproar.
The latest of these direct questions concerned the
President's desire to make himself a dictator: did he
have such a desire, and if so what about it? This is
not a very fair question to ask under any circum
stances of anybody, because it assumes a pretty un
friendly attitude on the part of the questioner and a
rare truthfulness on the part of the questionee; but
Mr. Roosevelt, seizing the opportunity to clarify a
vexing point, answered it.
No, he said, he has no inclination to be a dicta
tor. This showed commendable frankness from the
person who is, after all, the most concerned in the
matter; and coming from the Chief Executive it
should have been enough to answer any such ques
tion.
But he went on, much too modestly. "I have none
of the qualifications which would make me a success
ful dictator." This underestimation of great executive
ability, the best speaking voice in America, and the'
handsomest presence in public office, was unprecedent
ed but nice.
And he concluded by saying, "I have too much,
historical background and too much knowledge of
existing dictatorships to make me desire any form of
dictatorship for a democracy like the United Slates."

which surrounds his family drove home his final point,
designed to give the lie to those who feel that en

to the Senate concerning the Reorganization Bill, they
have reached the press, gone through the land, and
may now be accepted as a definitive statement of
policy.
If the gentleman who asked the question in the first
place feels that there is a little too much use of the
pronoun "I"—"I have no inclination," *'I have none of
the qualifications," "I have too much historical back
ground ... to make me desire any form of dictator
ship for a democracy like the United States"—if he
thinks there is a little too much equivocation, too
