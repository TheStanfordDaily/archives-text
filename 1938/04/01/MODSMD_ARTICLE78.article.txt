j ciety of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) Jour
nal, an article by Doron K. Antrim, Editor of "The
Metronome" begins: "If Bach, Beethoven and Brahms
were reincarnated in America today, chances are they
would produce no monuments to music worth men
tioning. They'd probably become second-rfite me
chanics instead of musicians and composers."
The whole trouble, according to Antrim, evolves
from the unsympathetic attitude which American mu
sic lovers have to anything but the "classics"—classics
in the sense that they were written in the past.
Added to this is the lack of governmental pride in the
music of their own nation, a situation different from
most countries where the composers are honored and
even supported financially. The whole idea is lhat
musicians who "have a yen to write anything beyond
32 bars' don t. have a Chinaman's chance.
The article points out that one group of American
musicians such as Ferde Grofe, George Gershwin,
Meredith Willson and Duke Ellington can never get
out from under ihe stigma of Tin Pan Alley. And that
the school which is an off-shoot of the old traditions,
to which belong Deems Taylor, Aaron Copland, Roy
Harris, and Howard Hansen haven't any advantage
over the other group in spite of their relation to the
old masters. According to Antrim, they must struggle
along, composing, but seldom hearing performances
of their works.
jyiUCH is to be said for this side of the picture. Cer
tainly the serious composer who makes a living
Fascist meeting. The only exceptions, as Antrim points
from his music is as scarce as a red shirt at a
out, are men like Sibelius, who is pensioned by the
government. But not in America, except through Ihe
embryonic Federal Music Project.
Composers who are creating serious music often
I must go to enormous personal expense to have their
works played. Symphony orchestras and their con
j ductors shy pretty well away from American music,
| or for that matter, most modern music. There are
I notable exceptions to this, of course. Stravinsky seems
fairly well established, Schoenberg can be heard oc
! casionaliy; but for the most part, modern music, and
; especially modern American music is seldom heard,
j An example of this was the recent concert by the
I Boston Symphony which played an all Hindenmath
; program. The battle fumes are still high in the air.
What's the reason for this fear of modern Amer
| ican music? Well, in the first place, most of it isn't
j really good. Even judged by its own ideals, it isn't
as good as Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms in the opin
i ion of the majority of critics and trained musicians.
; Its chief value, composers usually say. is that it is in
i the American idiom.'' I don't believe it, personally.
American music has hardly even gotten out of the
safety-pin stage: an American idiom could hardly be
expected yet. And I have still to be convinced that
jazz, or even its more worth-while counterpart, swing,
is more than the slang, rather than the real America
talking.

Metronome" begins: "If Bach, Beethoven and Brahms
were reincarnated in America today, chances are they
would produce no monuments to music worth men
tioning. They'd probably become second-rfite me
chanics instead of musicians and composers."
The whole trouble, according to Antrim, evolves
from the unsympathetic attitude which American mu
sic lovers have to anything but the "classics"—classics
in the sense that they were written in the past.
Added to this is the lack of governmental pride in the
music of their own nation, a situation different from
most countries where the composers are honored and
even supported financially. The whole idea is lhat
musicians who "have a yen to write anything beyond
32 bars' don t. have a Chinaman's chance.
The article points out that one group of American
musicians such as Ferde Grofe, George Gershwin,
Meredith Willson and Duke Ellington can never get
out from under ihe stigma of Tin Pan Alley. And that
the school which is an off-shoot of the old traditions,
to which belong Deems Taylor, Aaron Copland, Roy
Harris, and Howard Hansen haven't any advantage
over the other group in spite of their relation to the
old masters. According to Antrim, they must struggle
along, composing, but seldom hearing performances
of their works.
jyiUCH is to be said for this side of the picture. Cer
tainly the serious composer who makes a living
Fascist meeting. The only exceptions, as Antrim points
from his music is as scarce as a red shirt at a
out, are men like Sibelius, who is pensioned by the
government. But not in America, except through Ihe
embryonic Federal Music Project.
Composers who are creating serious music often
I must go to enormous personal expense to have their
works played. Symphony orchestras and their con
j ductors shy pretty well away from American music,
| or for that matter, most modern music. There are
I notable exceptions to this, of course. Stravinsky seems
fairly well established, Schoenberg can be heard oc
! casionaliy; but for the most part, modern music, and
; especially modern American music is seldom heard,
j An example of this was the recent concert by the
I Boston Symphony which played an all Hindenmath

What's the reason for this fear of modern Amer

j really good. Even judged by its own ideals, it isn't
as good as Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms in the opin

American music has hardly even gotten out of the
safety-pin stage: an American idiom could hardly be
expected yet. And I have still to be convinced that
jazz, or even its more worth-while counterpart, swing,
is more than the slang, rather than the real America
talking.
