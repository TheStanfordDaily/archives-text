# Fannie Brice Puts Punch Into Musical
## 
### 
"Everybody Sing." Fox - Stanford,
today and tonight:
In his latest musicomedy about the
life"theatrical and the family balmy,
expert comic keglers Judy Garland
and Fannie Brice bowl a good re
spectable spare.
Miss Brice's peculiar brand of va
cant and expansive affection for the
world at large and Miss Garland's
corn-fed comedy alone, rescue the
play from Bi 1 lie Burke and a plot
which first bloomed in "The Broad
way Melody."
But in spite of the saving graces of
this particular musical, producers
should wise up the fact that THE
SHOW has been having to go on for
a good many movies; that the loco
variety of mad family life has now
pretty well shot its bolt, and Billie
Burke, otie of the charter inmates of
this laughing academy, is rapidly be
ing stranded with it.
The second-string feature, "Love,
Honor and Behave," on the other
hand, is nowhere near as fatuous as
its title indicates.
Priscilla Lane graduates in this
picture from dramatic swaddling
clothes and acts as well as the limi
tations of an incurable cuteness will
allow.
Wayne Morris, too, in the male
lead, is an appealing juvenile.
But more important than any of its
performers, "Love, Honor and Be
have" makes a subtle kind of sense.
Pointing the moral of the .stupidity
of the "good loser" complex, and the
value of shrewdness, the story has )tn
intrinsic, sly wisdom which La Fon
taine recognized long ago in the
fable when he let the fox walk away
with the cheese.â€”Slater.
