### BILL MILLIS 
A LIFELINE only 8 miles wide,
between the Pandos mountains
and the Mediterranean seaport of
Tortosa at the mouth of the Ebro
River, is the "weakest link" today
in Loyalist Spain. A coastal high
way and railroad are the only con
nection between Catalonia and the
remaining Republican territories in
the Valencia-Madrid area.
Yesterday the southern wing of
the Rebel army that in less than
a month has pushed the Loyalists
back SO miles, crossed the last
coastal Sierra, and came within
sight of their goal.
Generalissimo Francisco Franco
could be satisfied with a second ma
jor victory yesterday, the final en- <
try of his center army into Lerida, j
after routing 25,000 "do or die" Loy
alist defenders.
Before ocntinuing their eastward
drive into Catalonia toward Barce
lona, only 84 miles away, the In
surgents probably first will attempt
to break the seacoast "bottleneck"
to the south, which would be a se
vere but not yet final weakening of
Republican resistance.

V ATIONAL ANTAGONISMS set
off by the undeclared Sino-
Japanese war exploded in San
Francisco yesterday, when 23 Chi
nese sailors on the schooner Kwang
Yuan mutinied, and they beat three
of the ship's Japanese officei's.
Anchored off Hunter's Point
since last September, the ship had
been prevented by customs offi
cials from sailing with its cargo
of serapiron to Osaka, Japan, be
cause of complications over a
change in the vessel's registry
from Chinese to Japanese own
ers.
A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and a
San Francisco police boat stood
alongside the schooner after yester
day's outbreak.

Mexico, which is beginning to feel
the pressure of what virtually
amounts to "economic sanctions" by
the United States, which has sus
pended silver purchases, yesterday
considered a plan to compensate
foreign oil companies in oil instead
of cash for their expropriated prop
erties.
An important stumbling block
making difficult any settlement of
the problem is that the companies
value their holdings for indemni
fication purposes at $400,000,000,
while the government wants to
pay compensation upon the basis
of their total tax assessment of
$275,000,000.

PERSONAL COMMAND was tak
en yesterday by President
Roosevelt of the Administration's
fight for early enactment of the
government reorganization bill,
which has been modified in an ap
parently successful effort to split the
bi-party block that last week at
tempted to halt the bill's progress
in the House.
Returning to Washington yes
terday, the President immediate
ly conferred with House Majority-
Leader Samuel Rayburn and
members of the House reorganiza
tion committee. Later, Rayburn
predicted the measure's passage by
Wednesday night.

Summary: An official State De

at least 60 per cent more powerful

power company offiicals and C.1.0.

Summary: An official State De
partment declaration of policy is
sued yesterday by the Senate naval
affairs committee declared that, the
United States must maintain a fleet,
at least 60 per cent more powerful
than that of Japan. Michigan
power company offiicals and C.1.0.
utility union heads will meet in De
troit today with Governor Frank
Murphy in an effort to end the
Saginaw valley strike. Search
for a missing navy bombing plane
was resumed at Honolulu. An
"incident" between Japanese em
bassy sentries and U.S. Marines was
threatened at Peiping, when a mes
senger was halted at bayonet point
and not allowed to deliver an of
ficial message to the Nipponese em
bassy.
A LIFELINE only 8 miles wide,
between the Pandos mountains
and the Mediterranean seaport of
Tortosa at the mouth of the Ebro
River, is the "weakest link" today
in Loyalist Spain. A coastal high
way and railroad are the only con
nection between Catalonia and the
remaining Republican territories in
the Valencia-Madrid area.
Yesterday the southern wing of
the Rebel army that in less than
a month has pushed the Loyalists
back SO miles, crossed the last
coastal Sierra, and came within
sight of their goal.
Generalissimo Francisco Franco
could be satisfied with a second ma
jor victory yesterday, the final en- <
try of his center army into Lerida, j
after routing 25,000 "do or die" Loy
alist defenders.
Before ocntinuing their eastward
drive into Catalonia toward Barce
lona, only 84 miles away, the In
surgents probably first will attempt
to break the seacoast "bottleneck"
to the south, which would be a se
vere but not yet final weakening of
Republican resistance.

Japanese war exploded in San
Francisco yesterday, when 23 Chi

Yuan mutinied, and they beat three
of the ship's Japanese officei's.

been prevented by customs offi

Mexico, which is beginning to feel
the pressure of what virtually
