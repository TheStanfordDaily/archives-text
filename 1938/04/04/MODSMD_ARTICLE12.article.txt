###

mara, who will present an "interna
tional" dance program in the Memo
rial Theater tomorrow night, are

as a native daughter, as it was there
that she first began dancing—for her
health. After becoming the star of
her school, she studied with the
Russian Ballet, always having Anna
Pavlowa as her ideal.
Fowler is also a westerner who be
gan his career as a ballroom dancer.
Since he became Tamara's husband
and dance partner, the, team has
made several European tours and
danced by royal command in vari
ous countries. It is on these tours
that the duo finds authentic sources
from which to study and interpret
their various continental and Asiatic
dances.
Spanish Interests
Fowler is most interested in the
bull-fighting in Spain and the gypsy
dances of Andalusia, which he likes
to contrast with the popular con
temporary tango.
One of the solos on the program
will be Tamara's "Valse Triste," in
which, as a dying dancer, she
i imagines herself rising to soft music
j and beckons the spirits of the dance
to join her in this, her last dance.
' At first weak, she gathers strength
| until, with a swell of the music, she
dances in a mad frenzy. Suddenly,
hearing the call of death, she at
tempts to resist but falls to the stage
floor.
Itull-fight Dance
"La Corrida" interprets the char-
I acteristic movements of the picadors,
! banderilleros, and matadors, and was
created by the terpsichorean team
after witnessing many bull-fights in
Spain.
The Stanford Concert Office still
has tickets for their appearance on
sale at $2.50, $2, and $1.50.
