# Prom Sellout Leaves 29 Behind
## 
### 
Twenty-nine Farm men
found themselves in a slightly
embarrassing situation last
week when the limit of 500 bids
to the Senior Prom had been
sold.
Those 29 men wanted bids,
and most of them had dates,
many of them long-standing,
for the Prom. But they could
n't get them. Five hundred men
had already beat them to the
bids.
Most of them, naturally,
went to the city. Some went
to the St. Francis or th? Mark,
and some went to the Fairmont
where Henry King and the De
Marcos were playing and
dancing for the last time.
But one of these men found
a way of going to the prom.
A friend, a good friend, of his
had a bid. so this man made a
little deal with his friend: one
couple would dance while the
other couple would leave the
prom for a while. Then the
dancing couple would go r>ut
and let the others come in.
