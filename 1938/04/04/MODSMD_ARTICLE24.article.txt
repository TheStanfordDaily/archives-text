# Dark Horse May Head Row Slate
## Pre-Caucus Dope Shows 'Solid' Hall Front, As Greeks Shuffle Choice 
### 
Out of the nowhere a new "dark horse" candidate for A.S.S.U. president
sprang into the limelight last night as Row and llall girded for next week's
spring election battle.
Whisper of Row splits, Ilall splits. Row-Hall spills, Row-Hall coali
tions buzzed around the campus yesterday, ready to burst into full tone
today.
Halls were apparently set on one candidate for president while houses
up and down the Row were immersed in juggling at least half a dozen
prospects into line.
Shortly after the S.A.ii's had called a Row caucus for 7:30 o'clock
tonight, word seeped out that the D.U.'s—unable to decide between their

►own Dave Ryus and Pete Fay—wcr«
| about to swing behind the Phi Delts'
| Bud McDuffie.
Rumor among Row politicos indi
cated that McDuffie came into th*
i election picture quite unexpectedly
j after the Phi Delts had more or
: less settled on Wayland Leonard.
May Be Independent
Meanwhile, one political source
| and another reported that Zete Bill
Hawkins may run on an independent
ticket if ho can't get the Row nomi
j nation; that Harry Horton will carry
\ the Hall banner; that Ryus, long
! considered the "logical" candidate of
I the Row, is no longer considered so
' logical; that the Alpha Delts will try
j to maneuver 11. B. "Beebs" Lee into

candidacy; that the Dekes are quietly
considering Phil Zonne.
On the women's side of the fence,
most of the action thus far has been
taken by Lagunita's casas. Defi
nitely roiled by action of Women's
Conference in approving a nomina
ting committee, the casas have ap
proved a down-the-line slate.
They'll back Rovena Conn for
vice-president, with possible oppo
sition to come from Jean Reynolds,
Kappa; Betty Davis, Tri-Delt; Pat
Skinner, Madrono, who's been sug
gested as a running-mate of Haw
kins on the independent ticket; Didi
Vibert, D.G.; and Jeanne Lehman,
j Alpha Phi.
Upper Ilow 'Weary'
| Rumors of the faintly possible Row
split revolve around reports that Ihe
i Upper Row is weary of the "long
I lean years" in which it has been
I without major office holders and
! would like to get some recognition.
The same reports say that some
Upper Row Houses, rather than sub
mit to continued Lower Row domi
nation of affairs, might consider a
coalition with the Halls, at least on
the presidency, and that undercover
dickerings for such a coalition are
afoot. Hall men say they know
nothing about the plan. However,
the self - designated non - political
S.A.E.'s say both Upper and Lower
Row will attend tonight's caucus.
Ryus, junior class president, is
said to have lost Lower Row support
by "dishing out" committee ap
pointments to Upper Row men.
Zete 'Trust' Broken
Other Row rumors arc that:
The once - famed Zete - Kappa
"trust" has broken up; the Pi Phi'.s
are on political outs with the Tri-
Deits; the Alpha Delts have bucked
the Row caucus on several occasion ;
