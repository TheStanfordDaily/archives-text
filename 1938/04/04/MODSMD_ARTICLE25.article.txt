# UPPER ROW TO CAUCUS
## 
### 
A Row split came nearer
reality late last night when
fairly authoritative rumors in
dicated a pre - caucus of the
Upper Row would be held this
afternoon.
With the Lower Row fairly
definitely set on Phi Delt's
McDuffie, the rumor went, the
Upper Row hoped to gather
enough houses behind one of
their men to get him named by
the regular Row caucus in the
evening. H. B. Lee, Alpha Delt,
was the most prominently
named candidate.
