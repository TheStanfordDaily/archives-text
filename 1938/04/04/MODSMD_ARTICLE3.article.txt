# Wilbur Lists Farm Needs For Year
## Construction To Get Thirteen Million; New Housing Planned 
### 
Approximately $13,000,000 needed
as capital amount for construction
of buildings at Stanford and ap
proximately $525,000 needed to meet
annual expenditures were listed by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in his
report to the Board of Trustees,
which was released today.
Envisaging progressive changes in
housing conditions, the report says
that from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000 is
needed for residence halls as the
largest single item, and that $1,000,-
000 or over is needed for each of
four schools, including the engi
neering school business adminis
tration, law school, and medical
school. For fine arts and geology,
$750,000 is needed, and for natural
history, $500,000.
Annual Needs
Needs listed on an annual basis
comprise an amount approximately
one-twenty-fifth as large as those
listed for construction and are as
follows:
Faculty salaries, $200,000; scholar
ships and fellowships, $50,000 to
$55,000; law library, $20,000; business
library, $5,000; fine arts, $30,000;
medical school, $40,000; medical re
search, $25,000; fluid research funds,
$40,000 to $100,000; main library,
$15,000; Natural History Museum,
$10,000; engineering school, $30,000.
Independent Study
That there is a growing apprecia
tion of advanced studies and that
"independent study at Stanford sug
gests a new hope for liberal educa
tion" are also noted by President
Wilbur.
"The changes in business, indus
try, and the profession all require
more university training for those
who expect to occupy places of re
sponsibility or leadership," he said,
in elaboration of his views on grad
uate study.
Public Schools
"The rapid growth upward of the
public school system including the
junior college is in part a response
to the need for more training and
in part a result of the inability of
boys and girls in their 'teens or early
twenties to find ready employment."
His conclusion on this point is
that the longer period of school work
gives more students a chance to dis
cover their own interests and ca
pacities.
Levels Raised
On the subject of independent
study at Stanford, since 1925, the
president stated his four conclusions
are "encouraging."
As a result of independent study,
the general level of freshman and
sophomore instruction for all stu
dents has been raised, he says.
New Methods
Independent study has also led the
instructing staff to set up new cri
teria and objectives, and has brought
the "vigorous development of teach
ing methods by subject-matter spe
cialists."
Individual teaching of superior
students has proved to be a guide to
reformation in the fields of the hu
manities and social sciences at Stan
ford, particularly political science,
psychology, and history.
Accomplishments
Freed from regimentation and
routine, the independent students
"have not only accomplished more
as undergraduates, but have in
many cases moved on into the realm
of problems and methods usually
deferred until the years of graduate
study," he declared.

Needs listed on an annual basis
comprise an amount approximately
one-twenty-fifth as large as those
listed for construction and are as
follows:
Faculty salaries, $200,000; scholar
ships and fellowships, $50,000 to
$55,000; law library, $20,000; business
library, $5,000; fine arts, $30,000;
medical school, $40,000; medical re
search, $25,000; fluid research funds,
$40,000 to $100,000; main library,
$15,000; Natural History Museum,
$10,000; engineering school, $30,000.
Independent Study
That there is a growing apprecia
tion of advanced studies and that
"independent study at Stanford sug
gests a new hope for liberal educa
tion" are also noted by President
Wilbur.
"The changes in business, indus
try, and the profession all require
more university training for those
who expect to occupy places of re
sponsibility or leadership," he said,
in elaboration of his views on grad
uate study.
Public Schools
"The rapid growth upward of the
public school system including the
junior college is in part a response
to the need for more training and
in part a result of the inability of
boys and girls in their 'teens or early
twenties to find ready employment."
His conclusion on this point is
that the longer period of school work
gives more students a chance to dis
cover their own interests and ca
pacities.
Levels Raised
On the subject of independent
study at Stanford, since 1925, the
president stated his four conclusions
are "encouraging."
As a result of independent study,
the general level of freshman and
sophomore instruction for all stu
dents has been raised, he says.
New Methods
Independent study has also led the
instructing staff to set up new cri
teria and objectives, and has brought
the "vigorous development of teach
ing methods by subject-matter spe
cialists."
Individual teaching of superior
students has proved to be a guide to
reformation in the fields of the hu
manities and social sciences at Stan
ford, particularly political science,
psychology, and history.
Accomplishments
Freed from regimentation and
routine, the independent students
"have not only accomplished more
as undergraduates, but have in
many cases moved on into the realm
of problems and methods usually
deferred until the years of graduate
study," he declared.
Approximately $13,000,000 needed
as capital amount for construction
of buildings at Stanford and ap
proximately $525,000 needed to meet
annual expenditures were listed by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur in his
report to the Board of Trustees,
which was released today.
Envisaging progressive changes in
housing conditions, the report says
that from $1,000,000 to $6,000,000 is
needed for residence halls as the
largest single item, and that $1,000,-
000 or over is needed for each of
four schools, including the engi
neering school business adminis
tration, law school, and medical
school. For fine arts and geology,
$750,000 is needed, and for natural
history, $500,000.
