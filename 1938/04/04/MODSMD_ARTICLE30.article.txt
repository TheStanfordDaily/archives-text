# Cal Women's Council Makes Visit to Farm
## Program Includes Tour of Campus, Discussion Croups 
### 
As a joint project with the
Women's Activity Council from
California, Women's Conference met
on Saturday to promote Stanford-
Cal relations and to discuss prob
lems common to both campuses.
Program for the day included a
tour of the campus from 11 to 12
o'clock, lunch at the various living
groups, discussion groups from 1:30
to 3 o'clock, and tea.
Problems Discussed
Student - faculty relations were
discussed by a committee led by
Putzie Hinrichs, assister by Bar
bara Paine. Both universities felt
that an apathetic feeling pervades
most colleges and a Cal-Stanford
get-together was suggested to make
a survey of other campuses.
Rovena Conn, assisted by Win
nie Jean Smith, led the discussion
on women's activities at which more
ideas for a nominating committee
were brought forth and a suggested
personnel board to counsel women
in activities was mentioned.
Drinking Problem
Under Gretchen Ahlswede and
Barbara Murphy, the problem of
drinking was discussed with the
conclusion that it wasn't really a
difficulty, except at Cal, perhaps,
because of living conditions.
Discussed under the rooming situ
| ation was the necessity for a fresh
man dormitory at Cal and an in-
I ternational house at Stanford. Har
! riet Nash and Sis Coon ley led the
discussion.
