r pHE mile racing situation on the
Coast has taken a couple of flip
flops during the past week or two,
and now any school that hasn't a
miler to start its track team with
just isn't in the swim any more.
For instance, when four Califor
nians ran 4:20 or better against the
Olympic Club a week ago there was
a great howl—Stan Sadaj was in
the low 4:lB's for a new all-time
Cal record, and was a definite
threat for the coast championship.
Wednesday of last week came
along and Marston "Mushy"' Ciir
ard of San Mateo C. ran 4:21.3
in a virtual dead heat with Jerry
Lopes of Sacramento J.C. Girard
had never done better than 4:31 in
liis life before.
As if that wasn't enough, Girard
ran another 4:21 mile Saturday on
Angell Field, against Pasadena J.C.
—the only trouble with that was
that Art Cazares of Pasadena, a
slight, swarthy Mexican lac', beat
him in with a blistering 4:17.6. That
time, incidentally, constitutes the
fastest four-lapper on the Coast this
year.
And then the kid they're all
forgetting, Big Ed Burrows, came
home 70 yards in front against
Fresno State Saturday in 4:18.1—
which is the second fastest coast
mile this season. This, of course,
leaves the Bear galaxy of Sadaj,
Mehlert, Powe, Baker, and maybe
Cooper and Yollmer, to mention
the leaders, not quite so glorious.
The runner who's supposed to
beat them all is Louis Zamperini
of U.S.C., but outside of a 4:26 ef
fort against Fresno Slate, in which
he was allegedly just loafing, he
hasn't been heard from. However,
there should be a few fireworks
when he goes against Cal this Sat
urday.
Just for a point of conversation,
though—Burrows is and will con
tinue to be throughout the season
the Coast's best miler.
>;t «{c >!s
of life's little tragedies took
place Saturday afternoon when
Lopes, aforementioned Sacramento
racer, hied himself down to Angell
Field from his home town to see
Girard and Cazares race. He got
all the way down from the capitol
and inside the gate just in time to
miss the mile, the only race he
wanted to see. Frustrating, to say
the least. He thumbed his way to
S.F., and then hopped a bus the
rest of the way.

RANDOM impressions from the
week-end: Jackie Robinson of
Pasadena J.C., brother of the famous
Mack, was a laugh in the pole vault
... he had never tried the event
before Saturday, but he gave it ev
erything he had, which is plenty
... if he could convert his distance
into height he'd be a world champ
. . . Dick Tam, Card second base
man, put down one of the prettiest
bunts you'd ever want to see
against the Pacific Greyhound nine
Saturday ... it was so good that
the third baseman was so rushed in
fielding he made a bad throw and
Dick beat it out . . . Sid Hayes,
frosh hurdler, doesn't waste any time
getting over the obstacles . . . his
15 flat in the highs puts him right
up with the varsity men . . . A1
Grey, shot-putter of the frosh, did
better than 56 feet with the 12-lb.
shot, which is tremendous, even
though he did foul . . . and if
somebody doesn't work on a boy
named Hogan from Piedmont to get
him to come to Stanford, our
alumni ain't what they used to
was . . . Hogan plodded out the
440 Saturday against the frosh in 50
flat.
