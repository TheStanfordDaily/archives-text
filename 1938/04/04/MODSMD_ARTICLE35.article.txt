# Cinder men Smash Fresno
## Farm Track Team Takes State Squad Stanford Sweeps Three Events, Sets Two Meet Records 
### 
Part of the cloak of mytsery sur
rounding Stanford's 1938 track ag
gregation was lifted last Saturday
when the Indians easily trounced
Fresno State, 91'^-39'j.
Sweeping three events, Coach
Dink Templeton's men cast them
selves into championship conten
tion wtih a handful of spectacular
individual marks. The Cards
walked off with all but three first
places and established two new meet
records. Fresno also chalked up two
new meet marks, and tied another.
Injuns setting new marks were
Captian Ray Malott, as he led a
clean sweep of the 440, adn Ed Bur
rows in the mile.
Malott Misses Record
Malott was unsuccessful by a full
second in his onslaught on Ben
Eastman's world record of 46.4, but
his time of 47.4 is one of the fastest
early season quarter-mile marks in
the country. Later in the day, Ma
lott came back in a special handi
cap race against Burrows and low
ered his time to 47.1.
With no competition, Burrows
rang up a new meet record of 4:18.1
in the mile and then came back to
score the only dual victory of the
day with a sparkling triumph in
the 880.
Winners' Marks
All three Fresno winners figured
in breaking or tying meet records.
Eldridge Rice, two-miler, erased
Burrows' old mark with a 9:42.5 per
formnace; Beverly Gubser nailed up
a new low hurdle standard of 24
flat and Tommy Nelson tied the
century record with a 9.8 win.
After his poor start had cost him
the 100, Stan Hiserman poured on
the steam in the furlong and re
versed the verdict. Hiserman's time
of 21.2 is outstanding for this early
in the season.

Part of the cloak of mytsery sur

when the Indians easily trounced
Fresno State, 91'^-39'j.
Sweeping three events, Coach
Dink Templeton's men cast them
selves into championship conten
tion wtih a handful of spectacular
individual marks. The Cards
walked off with all but three first
places and established two new meet
records. Fresno also chalked up two
new meet marks, and tied another.
Injuns setting new marks were
Captian Ray Malott, as he led a
clean sweep of the 440, adn Ed Bur
rows in the mile.
Malott Misses Record
Malott was unsuccessful by a full
second in his onslaught on Ben
Eastman's world record of 46.4, but
his time of 47.4 is one of the fastest
early season quarter-mile marks in
the country. Later in the day, Ma
lott came back in a special handi
cap race against Burrows and low
ered his time to 47.1.
With no competition, Burrows
rang up a new meet record of 4:18.1
in the mile and then came back to
score the only dual victory of the
day with a sparkling triumph in
the 880.
Winners' Marks
All three Fresno winners figured
in breaking or tying meet records.
Eldridge Rice, two-miler, erased
Burrows' old mark with a 9:42.5 per
formnace; Beverly Gubser nailed up
a new low hurdle standard of 24
flat and Tommy Nelson tied the
century record with a 9.8 win.
After his poor start had cost him
the 100, Stan Hiserman poured on
the steam in the furlong and re
versed the verdict. Hiserman's time
of 21.2 is outstanding for this early
in the season.
