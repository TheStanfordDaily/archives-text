# Frosh Trackmen Down High School All-Stars
## 
### 
As far as affording much real op
position to the yearling trackmen is
concerned, Coach Emil Lamar's
All-stars proved to be somewhat of
a disappointment in the rain
drenched meet on Angell Field Sat
urday morning. The fact that Ala
meda and Contra Costa high-school
stars were able to really stretch El
lington's men in few events, plus a
cold, wet day, brought most times
down to new lows. The final score
was Frosh 75 1 2, All-stars 4(5 4/5.
High point men for the Frosh
were Grant, with firsts in the cen
tury and 220; Hayes, who took both

hurdles with ease; and Lincoln, who
won the high-jump without trouble
and took another surprise first in the
javelin. Outstanding All-stars were
Bob Hogan, who nosed out Ernie
Clark in a :50.5 four-forty, and
Wyne Girclner of Alameda High, who
took the half in 2:04.
