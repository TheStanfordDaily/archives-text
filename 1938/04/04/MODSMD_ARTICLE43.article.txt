# Card Baseballers Whip Greyhounds
## 
### 
Opening with a seven-run bar
rage in the first inning and coasting
the rest of the way, Stanford's var
sity baseballers nabbed themselves
an easy 8-4 triumph over the Pa
cific Coast Greyhound nine Saturday
afternoon on the sunken diamond in
a warm-up tilt for the three con
ference games on their schedule
this week.
A1 Lazzarone, Glenn Hamilton,
and Spike Furman pitched three
innings apiece for the Indians, al
lowing four runs and six scattered
hits â€” while their teammates were
committing four errors in the field.
Stanford combined nine hits from
Pitcher Cash, who went the dis
tance, and five fielding bobbles by
the Greyhounds to send eight runs

across the plate.
In the only C.1.8.A. games over
the week-end, California's Golden
Bears strengthened their hold on
second place behind U.S.C. in the
standings by taking both ends of a
double-header from Santa Clara, 4-1,
and 12-2.
Tomorrow the Indians play the
first of three games scheduled for
this week when they meet Santa
Clara's last place Broncos on the
Sunken Diamond. U.C.L.A. pro
vides the opposition Friday, and.
Saturday the Cards travel to Berke
ley to open their three-game series
with California.
