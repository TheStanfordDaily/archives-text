# Watching the Wheels Go 'Round
## 
### 
WITH spring elections scheduled for next
week Stanford has begun to oil up her
electoral machinery, and Stanford politicians
have begun to oil up the electorate. Potential
candidates are wearing smiles that shine like
toothpaste ads. Reciprocal trade treaties are
being negotiated with impressive mystery
between living groups.
And as in every preceding year annoying
questions pop up amidst the fun of playing poli
tics, like a clump of skunk cabbage in a bed
of daffodils. What does Stanford get out of
student government? How well do we handle
\t? Are we making a success of it?
And as in preceding years no one seems to
know the answers, although the political woods
are full of self-sanctified prophets who will
discuss the questions as long as they think
there is an unbranded vote in the audience.
Stanford doesn t take time to observe her gov
ernment in operation. Most of the students are
considerably more interested in the disposition
of the blonde across the aisle than they are in
ihe qualifications of the architect of air castles
that dreams over the committee tables. They
vote as their hearts or their house presidents
direct, and go off to phone the blonde.
Considered from the outside, our student
government seems to worry along fairly yvell.
At least we manage to elect officers; and the
officers manage to make impressive noises.
We haven't strayed into the abyss of bank
ruptcy. Ex Committee members come and go
openly without jumping at the sound of a
police whistle. But that does not mean that
student government is doing Stanford any good,
or that we are handling it with any more in
telligence than a bunch of grammar school
children tinkering with an elaborate toy.
As critics will point out with carefully culti
vated cynicism, our student government has
aspects that would get a rise out of the Fed
eral Trade Commission if we advertised Stan
ford as the original Shangri-La.
Elections are a field-day for politicians. Back
slapping is often rated as a virtue above com
petency, an ethical judgment that would have
a hard time getting the approval of the philoso
phy department. The majority of the students
seem to pay no attention to government beyond
telling their delegate to the caucus, "For God's
sake get us something decent this time."
Stanford is touchingly proud of her self-gov
ernment. We like the feeling of maturity it
gives us. And undoubtedly we get valuable
experience out of it. Probably ours is a better
than average solution of the problem. But we've
never bothered to see whether it is or not.
In the coming election we will have another
chance to see how much the average student
benefits from participation in government. Any
how it will be a good show.—J. C.

Stanford doesn t take time to observe her gov
ernment in operation. Most of the students are
considerably more interested in the disposition
of the blonde across the aisle than they are in
ihe qualifications of the architect of air castles
that dreams over the committee tables. They
vote as their hearts or their house presidents
direct, and go off to phone the blonde.
Considered from the outside, our student
government seems to worry along fairly yvell.
At least we manage to elect officers; and the
officers manage to make impressive noises.
We haven't strayed into the abyss of bank
ruptcy. Ex Committee members come and go
openly without jumping at the sound of a
police whistle. But that does not mean that
student government is doing Stanford any good,
or that we are handling it with any more in
telligence than a bunch of grammar school
children tinkering with an elaborate toy.
As critics will point out with carefully culti
vated cynicism, our student government has
aspects that would get a rise out of the Fed
eral Trade Commission if we advertised Stan
ford as the original Shangri-La.
Elections are a field-day for politicians. Back
slapping is often rated as a virtue above com
petency, an ethical judgment that would have
a hard time getting the approval of the philoso
phy department. The majority of the students
seem to pay no attention to government beyond
telling their delegate to the caucus, "For God's
sake get us something decent this time."
Stanford is touchingly proud of her self-gov
ernment. We like the feeling of maturity it
gives us. And undoubtedly we get valuable
experience out of it. Probably ours is a better
than average solution of the problem. But we've
never bothered to see whether it is or not.
In the coming election we will have another
chance to see how much the average student
benefits from participation in government. Any
how it will be a good show.—J. C.
WITH spring elections scheduled for next
week Stanford has begun to oil up her
electoral machinery, and Stanford politicians
have begun to oil up the electorate. Potential
candidates are wearing smiles that shine like
toothpaste ads. Reciprocal trade treaties are
being negotiated with impressive mystery
between living groups.
And as in every preceding year annoying
questions pop up amidst the fun of playing poli
tics, like a clump of skunk cabbage in a bed
of daffodils. What does Stanford get out of
student government? How well do we handle
\t? Are we making a success of it?
And as in preceding years no one seems to
know the answers, although the political woods
are full of self-sanctified prophets who will
discuss the questions as long as they think
there is an unbranded vote in the audience.
