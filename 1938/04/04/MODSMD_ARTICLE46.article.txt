# One Side, Paly

MIXoD among the elegant folk at the Senior
Prom last Friday night, I noticed in passing
the eager beaming faces of several Paly High
Casanovas, and a Cal man or two to boot. Now,
hospitality is a jewel on Stanford's regal gar
ment; but, to leap lightly from cliche to cliche,
charity should begin at home.
While the high school socialites were getting
a smooth taste of "real collitch stuff," a half
hundred Stanford couples were sitting dolefully
at home at least, they wern't at the Prom.

There's nothing against Paly High or Cal
dropping in for a touch of Stanford dancing;
they don't add to the occasion; on the other
hand, neither do they detract particularly. But
when, as on this occasion, the number, of bids
is limited, it might be well for dance committees
to require the presentation of student body
cards when the bid is bought, and when it is
handed in at the door. Such a requirement
would make no difference at all in the Stanford
customers' right to enjoy a name-band's dish
of corn, but it would let a few more of them in.
And campus dances are, after all, for the benefit
of Stanford.
There's no personal antipathy against the Paly
or Cal boys implied by this. I got to the dance,
and the presence of a few outlanders made no
difference to me at all. But it did to some other
people who couldn't get that blonde in the next
seat to say "yes" quick enough.—J. S.
