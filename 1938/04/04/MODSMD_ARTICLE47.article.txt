PEOPLE'S CHOICE
| MIGHT have known Emery Bellwether would try to
break into politics. Possessed of a determined, if
somewhat vague, social conscience, which usually boils
down to what is best for Emery Bellwether, he came
up to me on the Quad yesterday and began to harangue
me on what he was going to do after he became presi
dent of the Associated Students.
"President they will call it, at any rate," he said,
"but it will lead to other things."
"President, hm?" I said. "And how do you ex
pect to get elected president? You have to have an
organization, you know—Row, or Hall, or something.
A sufficient number of stooges to get you a passable
number of votes."
"I'm independent."
"Yes, I don't doubt that. But just being independ
ent won't do you any good."
"Certainly. When the Farm hears my program,
it won't be necessary to have party backing. Sheer
worth will be rewarded, as it always is. They won't
say Bellwether got elected by the Beef Trust or the
Barroom Boys."
"They won't say Bellwether got elected. What is
this program of yours, anyway? Will you try to les
sen the Hall-Row split?"
"That thing! Hauled out, of the moth-balls each
election-time, used to stir up feelings which never
exist except in the minds of our Farleys-on-the-make,
the merry caravan on which our embryo pork-barrel
ers ride to glory; it is much too convenient to be true.
Its only result is to arouse artificial animosities which
do far more harm than good. If I had my way, I
should encourage people to jump the traces and vote
for the man they want to vote for."
"Bellwether."
"No, not Bellwether! Anybody."
"You don't expect that idea to catch on."
"Oh, no. So I'm offering some interesting plans to
the electorate. Under the kindly aegis of the Stanford
Axe and the slogan 'K.K.K.'—"
"What?"
"Curse 'em, cuss 'em, and kick 'em when they're
down—l'm going to undertake a unification of the
Pacific Coast. There are any number of suppressed
Stanford minorities, particularly at San Jose State,
and I regard it as my duty to bring them together. If
I could even make One College, One Campus, One
Leader out of the Bay Region, I'd be re-elected. That
would insure victory and eventual anschluss with Cal,
right there."
"And who wants Anschluss with Cal?"
"Part of my mission is bringing enlightenment to
those who don't have it, you know."
"K.K.K., hm? Well, Bellwether—"
"I knew you'd back me. Pass the word along to
your friends, and remember this: what comes after
39?"
"Why, 40, I supp—"
"Life Begins! Goodbye."

I could even make One College, One Campus, One
Leader out of the Bay Region, I'd be re-elected. That
would insure victory and eventual anschluss with Cal,
right there."
"And who wants Anschluss with Cal?"
"Part of my mission is bringing enlightenment to
those who don't have it, you know."
"K.K.K., hm? Well, Bellwether—"
"I knew you'd back me. Pass the word along to
your friends, and remember this: what comes after
39?"
"Why, 40, I supp—"

PEOPLE'S CHOICE
| MIGHT have known Emery Bellwether would try to
break into politics. Possessed of a determined, if
somewhat vague, social conscience, which usually boils
down to what is best for Emery Bellwether, he came
up to me on the Quad yesterday and began to harangue
me on what he was going to do after he became presi
dent of the Associated Students.
"President they will call it, at any rate," he said,
"but it will lead to other things."
"President, hm?" I said. "And how do you ex
pect to get elected president? You have to have an
organization, you know—Row, or Hall, or something.
A sufficient number of stooges to get you a passable
number of votes."
"I'm independent."
"Yes, I don't doubt that. But just being independ
ent won't do you any good."
"Certainly. When the Farm hears my program,
it won't be necessary to have party backing. Sheer
worth will be rewarded, as it always is. They won't
say Bellwether got elected by the Beef Trust or the
Barroom Boys."
"They won't say Bellwether got elected. What is
this program of yours, anyway? Will you try to les
sen the Hall-Row split?"
"That thing! Hauled out, of the moth-balls each
election-time, used to stir up feelings which never
exist except in the minds of our Farleys-on-the-make,
the merry caravan on which our embryo pork-barrel
ers ride to glory; it is much too convenient to be true.
Its only result is to arouse artificial animosities which
do far more harm than good. If I had my way, I
should encourage people to jump the traces and vote
for the man they want to vote for."
"Bellwether."
"No, not Bellwether! Anybody."
"You don't expect that idea to catch on."
"Oh, no. So I'm offering some interesting plans to
the electorate. Under the kindly aegis of the Stanford
Axe and the slogan 'K.K.K.'—"
"What?"
"Curse 'em, cuss 'em, and kick 'em when they're
down—l'm going to undertake a unification of the
Pacific Coast. There are any number of suppressed
Stanford minorities, particularly at San Jose State,
and I regard it as my duty to bring them together. If
I could even make One College, One Campus, One
Leader out of the Bay Region, I'd be re-elected. That
would insure victory and eventual anschluss with Cal,
right there."
