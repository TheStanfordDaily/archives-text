yi THREE-YEAR-OLD friend of mine was telling
me the other clay that he didn't think much of
Shakespeare. Maybe he's right. I thought, and went
on to ask how he liked "Alice in Wonderland." "Confi
dentially," he snapped, "it stinks!"
"Well," I asked, questioning him more closely,
"What sort of literature do you like? Grimm's Fairy
tales, the Bible, Hearst editorials?"
"None," he replied, "it's all completely ridiculous
and doesn't mean a thing. You can't toll me people
really enjoy looking at those quaint little misshapen ink
spots."
"Don't you ever get anything out of reading?" I
queried, astonished.
"Nope," he said quite smuglv, "I dont know how to
re'ad."

There are lots of people far past the age of Ihree
who hate opera, painting, symphonies, poetry, and a
host of other arts just because they don't know how
to read them. Like my three-year-old, they're very
happy and smug in their ignorance, have no desire
to read art, and are extremely dogmatic in their
condemnation of anything they don't understand.
Maybe Van Gogh, Stravinsky, or Keats are no
good, but how can anybody tell any better than my
three-year-old friend could tell "Alice in Wonderland"
stinks.
Certain works in every field of art may say the
wrong thing, or may not say anything at all. It's
sure a good feeling to be able to see that after you've
learned to read. But until you have, you'll be like
my three-year-old friend who thinks that Shake
speare's ink splotches look just as ridiculous as those
in Hearst's editorials. They do, to him all right., but
that's an awful state to be in.
It's true the Hearst edits are even a little more
ludicrous after learning to read, but it's stupid to
condemn all of any one type of art, such as literature.
just because of no knowledge in that field.

What this country needs, besides a recess from the
recession, is a few sets of McGuffey Readers for the
Arts. We could have one on music which would in
clude Richard Wagner and Benny Goodman. An
other on painting with information on Michel Angelo,
Walt Disney and others. The dramatic arts volume
would tell all about "Minder in the Cathedral" (I
need that one) and Charlie McCarthy. We might even
get the University Press to publish them, who knows?
