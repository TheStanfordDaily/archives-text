# 'Star Wagon' Recalls Past's Rosy Romance
## 
### 
Star Wagon, presented last week
end by Stanford alumni:
Bright, one - dimensional, and
faintly glistening is Maxwell An
derson's picture of the past, glazed
on his gingerbread fantasy.
In this, his latest and current
Broadway show, Playwright Ander-

son gives his in
ventor-hero Ste
phen Minch a ma
chine, lets him
hark back to the
days when
"spooning" was a
major moral
breach, and "bus
tle" an iroproper
reference to the
better part of a

lady's skix't.
In last week-end's production,
Phil Brown's Stephen was like an
animated version of a Norman
Rockwell Satevepost cover illus
tration. Bespectacled, diffident, al
together lovable, Mr. Brown's young
Stephen was similarly simple, scru
pulously unaffected. Mr. Brown, in
fact, has probably been put down in
thp book for a number one dressing
room in the thespian's Valhalla.
Janet Dole, as the heroine, Martha
Minch, graced the show with a uni
formly soothing and dainty per
formance. Burnell Gould, as Hanus
Wicks, hauled off with a lion's
share of comic honors, and other
cast members met regulation re
quirements.
Beautifully nostalgic, settings and
costumes called to mind those sepia
photos of the courting couple posed
against a background of phoney
clouds, and showing the girl in a
hat which is an institution—the boy,
in tight checked pants, his hair, and
upright collar both outward bound
from a center part.
Artistically microscopic, often
cloyingly beyond the pale, "Star
Wagon" nevertheless has a shy po
etry, an ornate optimism like the
gilt verses on a moustache cup, and
a paper-lace contention that life is,
perhaps, after all, more rosy ro
mance than sallow realism.—Slater.
