# Diesenroth, Marcus Win 1938 Plaque
## Card Team Defeats Ucla in Debate At Commonwealth Club 
### 
Carl Diesenroth and Gerald Mar
cus won the fourth Commonwealth
Club of California Annual Plaque
Debate last Friday when the Cardi
nal debaters defeated a Uclan team
by the unanimous decision of three
judges.
The two men defended the nega
tive of "Resolved, that the program
of the C.1.0. is detrimental to the
best interests of labor," in defeating
Roy Woolsey and Milton Kramer,
junior Bruin forensic representa
tives.
The decision for Stanford as "the
team making the best presentation,
irrespective of the merits of the
question," was the fourth consecu
tive in favor of Farm debaters. The
first two years they met Cal teams;
this year and last they have met
U.C.L.A.
The determination of the sides was
left to the whim of Wall Street by
agreeing that they should be deter
mined by the total number of shares
sold on the New York Stock Ex
change on March 8, 1938.
"The number being 737,590, and
the third figure from the right being
odd, U.C.L.A. will uphold the affir
mative and Stanford the negative,"
it was decided.
John F. Brady, Chief Deputy Su
perintendent of the San Francisco
Schools; Royal Arch Gunnison, Pa
cific Coast Staff of the Christian
Science Monitor; and Dr. Alexander
C. Robert, President of San Fran
cisco State College, were the judges.
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock in Room
202 a debate will be held with Saint
Mary's. An unannounced Card team
will take the affirmative of the above
C.1.0. question.
The same afternoon two other
debates will be held with the travel
ing women's team from Washington
State. The time and Stanford de
baters have not yet been decided.
The clashes will be held on "Re
solved, that the National Labor Re
lations Board should be empowered
to enforce arbitration of all indus
trial disputes."
