WPANISH INSURGENT troops, led

gades and foreign legionnaires, yes
terday entered the outskirts of Tor
tosa, on the Ebro River delta only
six miles from the Mediterranean,
while Rebel artillery on nearby
mountains halted all tarffic on the
last remaining coast highway be
tween Valencia and the Loyalist
capital, Barcelona.
Frontier reports from Hendaye,
France, Rebel communiques, and
firmed the belief that fear and
even Loyalist statements, eon
panic is spreading among soldiers
and civilians throughout Cata
lonia. The page upon which his
tory will mark "finis" at the end
of "the last chapter of the war"
seems near.
In Barcelona Premier Juan Negrin
reorganized the government cabinet,
taking over the war ministry from
demoted Right Socialist Leader In
dalecio Prieto, and announced that
stern measures would be taken
against "the threat of anarchism."
An eleventh-hour counter-offensive
was begun by Loyalists on the Gua
dalajara front north of Madrid, in
an effort to divert the Rebel pres
sure against Catalonia.
Four Insurgent columns are now
moving eastward in an attempt to
gain control of the Mediterranean
seacoast for a distance of 65 miles,
from Vinaroz on the south to the
Catalonian port of Tarragona. De
spite Loyalist pledges to "resist to
the last cartridge," it is doubtful that
they can hold out for long against
the superior military machine of
"Nationalist" General Franco.
