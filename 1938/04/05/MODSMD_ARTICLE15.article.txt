# Dance Team To Present Recital Here
## Concert Audience To Vote Tonight On Next Season's Series 
### 
The dance team of Addison Fowler !
and Florenz Tamara, which has ap- i
peared in all the capitol cities of j
Europe and danced by royal com- j
mand for the kings of Spain, Den- |
mark, Sweden, and Portugal, the j
Maharajah of India, and at request j
performances for the Prince of Wales |
and Princess Helena Victoria, will j
appear at 8:15 o'clock tonight in
Memorial Hall.
Though both Fowler and Tamara
are Americans, they have studied
every type of dancing in Europe,
spending nine months on the conti
nent last year. Because of Fowler's
interest in bull-fighting much of
their time was spent in Spain, where
they i - eceived their inspiration for
"La Corrida," which will appear on j
tonight's program.

In addition to recital appearances, j
Fowler and Tamara have been fea
tured in stage shows of Paris and
