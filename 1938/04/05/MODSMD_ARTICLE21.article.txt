# Lagunita To Back Women's Nominations
## 
### 
While Row and Hall men still
were dickering over candidates,
Women's Conference's nominating
committee yesterday stole Lagunita
thunder in its approval of candi
dates for women's offices.
Voluntary withdrawal of Kappa
Jean Reynolds from the race for
A.S.S.U. vice-president probably
was the biggest political upset of
the four-hour long nominating ses
sion.
But Lagunita politicos were any
thing but pleased when the nomi
nating committee put its official
O.K. on every Lagunita candidate
and gave Halls an edge in nomina
tions.
Conn, Davis Approved
With the withdrawal of Miss Rey
nolds, the committee picked Rovena
Conn, Lagunita, and Betty Davis,
Tri-Delt, for A.S.S.U. vice - presi
dent. The Row caucus at the S.A.E.
house later accepted Miss Davis as
the Row candidate.
Pat Skinner, earlier suggested as
an independent ticket candidate for
A.S.S.U. vice-president, wound up
as a candidate for senior woman on
Ex Committee. Also approved for
that post were Jayne Copp, Pi Phi;
Barbara Day, Tri-Delt, and Anabel
Simpson, Lagunita.
Four women were sanctioned as
candidates for junior woman on Ex
Committee. They are Annabelle
Clark, Lagunita; Betty Finch, Chi
O; Barbara Gilbert, Mariposa; and
Barbara Riley, Kappa.
Ilihhard, Hinrichs To iVe
Carolyn Hibbard, Mariposa, and
Putzie Rinrichs, Union, both already
past the hurdle of Lagunita's caucus,
were confirmed as opponents for
president of Women's Conference.
Five women were nominated for
the two Women's Council vacancies.
They are: Barbara Goodrich, La
gunita; Mary Catherine Hayes, La
gunita; Betty Jane Hart, Alpha Phi;
Harriet Nash,. Madrono, and Vir
ginia Valentine, Theta.
Mary Sladen, Lagunita, and Jean
Tillotson, Alpha Phi, were okayed
for vice-president of Women's Con
ference, somewhat counterbalancing
the all-Hall selection for the presi
dency.
Up for Conference secretary are
Georgiana Dole, Kappa; Joy Grubbs,
Lagunita; Eleanor Marquand, Chi O,
and Ruth Reynolds and Anne Town
send, freshman and Hall.
Only women vote for the Coun
cil and Conference posts.
Council Split
Council split on affiliation — five
Row, five Hall—in voting on A.S.
S.U. vice-presidency candidates and
on Ex Committee nominations, but
Hall came out ahead on the Council
and Conference slates, having nine
candidates as against five Row nom
inees and with a monopoly on Con
ference president.
Cynthia Coonley, Conference pres
ident, pointed out the nominating
committee's choices are not exclu
sive and that any woman so de
siring may seek office, provided she
has the proper unit requirements.
"We had a hard time choosing,"
she declared. "We know that there
are many other capable women, and
they should realize that the com
mittee's nomination is not absolute.
Anyone who wants to can still run
by submitting a petition."

has the proper unit requirements.
"We had a hard time choosing,"
she declared. "We know that there
are many other capable women, and
they should realize that the com
mittee's nomination is not absolute.
Anyone who wants to can still run
by submitting a petition."
While Row and Hall men still
were dickering over candidates,
Women's Conference's nominating
committee yesterday stole Lagunita
thunder in its approval of candi
dates for women's offices.
Voluntary withdrawal of Kappa
Jean Reynolds from the race for
A.S.S.U. vice-president probably
was the biggest political upset of
the four-hour long nominating ses
sion.
But Lagunita politicos were any
thing but pleased when the nomi
nating committee put its official
O.K. on every Lagunita candidate
and gave Halls an edge in nomina
tions.
Conn, Davis Approved
With the withdrawal of Miss Rey
nolds, the committee picked Rovena
Conn, Lagunita, and Betty Davis,
Tri-Delt, for A.S.S.U. vice - presi
dent. The Row caucus at the S.A.E.
house later accepted Miss Davis as
the Row candidate.
Pat Skinner, earlier suggested as
an independent ticket candidate for
A.S.S.U. vice-president, wound up
as a candidate for senior woman on
Ex Committee. Also approved for
that post were Jayne Copp, Pi Phi;
Barbara Day, Tri-Delt, and Anabel
Simpson, Lagunita.
Four women were sanctioned as
candidates for junior woman on Ex
Committee. They are Annabelle
Clark, Lagunita; Betty Finch, Chi
O; Barbara Gilbert, Mariposa; and
Barbara Riley, Kappa.
Ilihhard, Hinrichs To iVe
Carolyn Hibbard, Mariposa, and
Putzie Rinrichs, Union, both already
past the hurdle of Lagunita's caucus,
were confirmed as opponents for
president of Women's Conference.
Five women were nominated for
the two Women's Council vacancies.
They are: Barbara Goodrich, La
gunita; Mary Catherine Hayes, La
gunita; Betty Jane Hart, Alpha Phi;
Harriet Nash,. Madrono, and Vir
ginia Valentine, Theta.
Mary Sladen, Lagunita, and Jean
Tillotson, Alpha Phi, were okayed
for vice-president of Women's Con
ference, somewhat counterbalancing
the all-Hall selection for the presi
dency.
Up for Conference secretary are
Georgiana Dole, Kappa; Joy Grubbs,
Lagunita; Eleanor Marquand, Chi O,
and Ruth Reynolds and Anne Town
send, freshman and Hall.
Only women vote for the Coun
cil and Conference posts.
Council Split
Council split on affiliation — five
Row, five Hall—in voting on A.S.
S.U. vice-presidency candidates and
on Ex Committee nominations, but
Hall came out ahead on the Council
and Conference slates, having nine
candidates as against five Row nom
inees and with a monopoly on Con
ference president.
Cynthia Coonley, Conference pres
ident, pointed out the nominating
committee's choices are not exclu
sive and that any woman so de
siring may seek office, provided she
has the proper unit requirements.
"We had a hard time choosing,"
she declared. "We know that there
are many other capable women, and
