# Farm Factions Choose Names For President
## 
### 
Private filibuster and official in
decision Ins! night nuzzled Alpha
Delt H. B. "Beebs" Lee into posi
tion as the Row's opponent of Hall
man Harry Horton for the A.S.S.U.
presidency.
Some hours before the Halls more
or less quietly okayed a slate headed
by Horton, the Row caucus at th»
S.A.E. house first plopped for Bud
McDuffie, Phi Delt, then, thanks to
Alpha Delt Jim Newell, who want
ed a proxy vote, and Chairman Col
lie Small, who wasn't sure what he
wanted, switched to Lee.
Caldcnvood Declines
Hall caucusers wanted Jack Cal
derwood as their candidate and his
name was proposed and seconded.
He declined on the ground he will
not be here next year and Horton
then was approved. The 200-odd men
present were strongly behind Cal
derwood.
Late last night, an unconfirmed
report was telephoned to The Daily
that Zete Bill Hawkins would ba
nominated as an independent by a
group "which thinks he's the best,
man." Hawkins informed The Daily
he hasn't made up his mind.
McDuffie Named First
On the first Row caucus ballot, Mc-
Duffie was confirmed, 15-14, as the
Row nominee. But Newell popped
in to announce he had, by telephone,
obtained the A. O. Pi proxy vote
for Lee.
While the caucus voted, 17-11, to
accept the McDuffie vote, Newell
harangued the delegates in a tem
porarily tumultous session while
Small, far from expert in his chair
manship according to opposition
Rowmen, tried to decide whether
Newell or the 17 delegates were
right.
Meanwhile delegates from the A.
O. Pi and Deke houses wandered
in; Small decided a new vote was
in order, and the two additional
votes gave Lee the nomination.
Upper Row Triumph
Lee's selection was a triumph for
the Upper Row, which caucused
yesterday afternoon and selected a
slate for seven offices. It was
slightly unpleasant for seven "small''
houses which, in a pre-caucus ses
sion, voted to "go with" Lower Row,
in return for a cut on committee
jobs next fall.
Five of Upper Row's seven candi
dates waltzed through to official all-
Row sanction. The group had coun
tered Lower Row's acquisition of
the small house support by pulling
in sorority backing. D.G.'s, 20 min
utes before the caucus, sanctioned
the Upper Row choices.
Ryus Named
Dave Ryus, earlier mentioned as
the No. 1 possibility for A.S.S.U.
president, finished with the nomi
nation for senior class president by
a fairly large margin.
The Phi Dolts, who lost the presi
dency by one vote for the second
consecutive year, also lost on a Zete
deal in which they would have sup
ported Bill Hawkins for senior
class president in return for Zete
support of Lee for president.
Opposes Horn
Ryus will oppose the Halls' A!
Horn for the senior class top job.
Halls will support Frank Van
Ackers against the Row's Ken
[ Cuthbertson, Delt, for junior clasi
| presidency. Cuthbertson was pre
j sented by Upper Row, which se
! lected him by a 5-4 vote over Bob
I Richardson, Phi Psi.
For Ex Committee membership,
the Halls will back Stan Zimet for
graduate member; John Partridge
| for member-at-large; Andy Stojko-
