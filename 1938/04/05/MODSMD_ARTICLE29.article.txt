# A.S.U. Opens Drive For Farm Members
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Stanford's American Student Un
ion, which shares the national
A.S.U.'s alleged radical reputation, is
starting a drive this week to pre
vent its fate of late spring: oblivion.
The Farm chapter hopes, in its
program, to .stimulate interest in (a)
i the A.S.U.; (h) Peace Day.
Dubbed at its inception at Stan
lord three years ago as red and
radical, the local chapter has met
passive opposition and proved inef
fectual. To combat this, Mark Hop
kins has instituted a drive to in
crease its membership from the 25
members which it has now, and to
stimulate more general interest.
Purpose ol' the organization, Hop
kins says, is two-fold: to offer edu
cation on current local and national
problems, and to give students with
liberal ideas a chance to put their
ideas into action.
Peace Day Plans
Most spectacular, possibly most
important, jdea the A.S.U. has put
into action on the Farm has been
Peace Day. Begun three years ago
by the A.S.U. and Y.W.C.A.. Peace
Day has been taken over by the
A.S.S.U. But the A.S.U., which give*
peace the foremost place in both its
national and local program, actively
supports the A.S.S.U. peace com
mittee, is holding three meetings on
successive Thursday nights in the
i Women's Clubhouse to promote in
terest in Peace Day.
Meetings will be: (1) San Fran
cisco speakers discussing both sides
of the question of whether Germany
is or is not a menace to peace; (2) a
debate between a local speaker and
Celeste Straek on whether or not
; collective security can keep the
United States out of war; and (3) a
forum of three or four faculty mem
bers on "How 1 Think the United
1 Slates Can Stay Out of War."
Speakers Not Approved
Forced to make most of their meet
i ings closed because of their reputa
tion and because they couldn't get
the Public Exercises Committee to
approve their speakers, according
to Hopkins the A.S.U. has had diffi
culty in attracting attention or
members. Because of lack of in
terest, the A.S.U. died out completely
j at Stanford last spring.
It was revived again fall quarter,
i is being further revived now. Pam
; phlets advertising the A.S.U. by
j stating its purposes are being cir
culated on the campus in an attempt
j to secure new memberships.
Membership fees are one dollar a
year, half of which goes to the na
tional A.S.U., which will be dis
cussed in a later Daily article. Ofli
cers on the Farm are: Mark Hop
: kins, president; Loval Gunter, secre
i tary; Dan McComish, treasurer;
! Georgie Strone. Jean nUivÂ«m:in

Jean Biid, and Beth Allen, members
of its ex committee.
Immediate plans for the Farm
A.S.U. include tours of several Bay
region unions. Peace Day, discussion
forums, and the promotion of a
survey of conditions of off-campus
student workers.
Aside from beginning Peace Day,
members feel most important activi
ties have been lobbying last year for
the California Youth Act in the state
legislature, conducting last year's
tour of the San Francisco strike
areas for GO students, and work in
last year's Farm janitor strike.
The local A.S.U. sprang from the
Farm chapter of the National Stu
dent League for Industrial Democ
racy and other liberal groups ex
isting on the campus at that time.
