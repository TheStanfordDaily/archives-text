# New Rushing Plan Offered To Council
## Revised System Based on Study Of Coast Universities 
### 
A new rushing system, which, it
is hoped, will surpass in efficiency
that of other Pacific Coast universi
ties, will be discussed by Interfra
ternity Council at its dinner meeting
at 6 o'clock tonight in the Alpha
Delt house.
The new plan, proposed in a re
port made by Jay Dirlam the day he
left to board the ill-fated airliner
which was lost near Fresno, was
made after an extensive study of
rushing systems now in use at other
Coast universities.
According to Interfraternity Pres
ident Don Moulton, the plan "will
be a very sensible stand, because it
brings greater concentration and

control to a system which has, up
to now, left Stanford far behind as
to quality of rushing."
Under the proposition, which is to
be considered tonight, definite rush
ing periods are not yet set. However,
the first period will be a general
open house to "pay off debts." Dur
ing-this period the freshmen will
visit from 10 to 12 houses. They will
not be limited to one or two houses,
as they necessarily are by present
regulations.
Less Periods
Also outlined in the plna is a
lessened number of fall quarter
rushing periods. Now five, the new
system will allow only three.
Another section calls for every
house to send letters to the parents
of pledges, so that a better general
knowledge will be had by everyone
concerned.
Other important business of the
evening will bring up discussion of
plans for this fall's initiation week—
plans which the Council hopes will
clean up now-existing bad features.
Three Sections
Three main sections comprise the
new proposal:
1. Initiations during the week after
Thanksgiving—Monday, Nov. 28, to
Sunday, Dec. 4. All or a large part
of the initiations must take place
during this period.
2. Preceding thus period, each
house must make a report to the
office of the Dean of Men on the
type of initiation which it is plan
ning to use.
3. All off-campus initiations are
to be outlawed.
Also to be taken up during the
meeting is the following:
The Council will select a nomi
nating committee for elections to be
held at the next Council meeting.
Plans will be discussed for the in
terfraternity banquet, to be held
sometime in mid-quarter.
At a meeting tomorrow night, the
Interfraternity Board of Control will
announce the winner of the Tarver
Exchange Scholarship.
