### 
'T'HE bowling situation seems tc
have lapsed into an era ol
doldrums. Nobody is challenging
anybody in the University laddei
play, and if you don't have chal
lenges you don't have any action.
The Engineers, a group of mild
mannered gentlemen who have start
lingly little difficulty in getting
those strikes and spares, are still
at the top of the ladder. They have
n't had their superiority questioned
yet this quarter, Leonard Lyon, one
of the Engineers, says.
While he doe. n't think that is
such a tragedy, lie still thinks it
would be nice if the trundling ri
valry took a new lease on life
now that a new quarter has
opened. Eligible to challeifge the
Engineers to a contest for that
first place are the Fijis, in second,
and the Kappa Sigs, third.
Breakers, the fourth place team
now, after having once been in
second place, will have to make
first in two jumps if they plan on
winning. The challenge rule al
lows a team to challenge only two
places above.
While we're on bowling, it might
be well to mention that there is a
Stanford ladder posted in the alleys
at Redwood City. If any Indian
bowlers happen to bob up with a
big score there, they might just as
well gather a little glory and have
their names posted along with the
rest.
Harry Soltero leads the list at
present with a substantial 239 —at
least that's the way it was at last
investigation.

SLANTS was written for
yesterday Louis Zamperini had
n't been heard from except for a
4:2(5 mile, but the U.S.C. cruiser
came home with a 4:14 against
Compton J. C. Saturday, and so
Slants looked slightly silly, to say
the least.
However, that still doesn't rule
out the statement that Burrows is
the candy in Coast miling this year.
Zamperini, incidentally, is fig
ured to be good enough for a double
win against Cal this Saturday. He is
supposed to breeze home in the mile
ahead of Sadaj and Mehlert, which
nobody in his right mind will argue
against, and then win the two-mile.
It might be another story, though,
if Z. np is pressed in the mile by
the two Bears. If there's one thing
Cal has this year it is distance men,
and Cooper and Vollmer in the
two-mile might give the Trojan a
heat if he gets a little tired in that
mile.
Cooper hasn't been playing up
verj much, but Dink Templeton
sayK he's the prettiest runner he has
seen in a long time, and the old
Dink is supposed to know. Vollmer
can run in the 9:3o's any day in the
week, and ii he has to run behind
somebody else for a while he might
g<-t lower than that.
Zamperini must be pretty good,
with all the talk that's going around,
but he hasn't any cinch double this
week. Conservative pickers will
probably have him second in the
two-mile.

'T'HE bowling situation seems tc
have lapsed into an era ol
doldrums. Nobody is challenging
anybody in the University laddei
play, and if you don't have chal
lenges you don't have any action.
The Engineers, a group of mild
mannered gentlemen who have start
lingly little difficulty in getting
those strikes and spares, are still
at the top of the ladder. They have
n't had their superiority questioned
yet this quarter, Leonard Lyon, one
of the Engineers, says.
While he doe. n't think that is
such a tragedy, lie still thinks it
would be nice if the trundling ri
valry took a new lease on life
now that a new quarter has
opened. Eligible to challeifge the
Engineers to a contest for that
first place are the Fijis, in second,
and the Kappa Sigs, third.
Breakers, the fourth place team
now, after having once been in
second place, will have to make
first in two jumps if they plan on
winning. The challenge rule al
lows a team to challenge only two
places above.
While we're on bowling, it might
be well to mention that there is a
Stanford ladder posted in the alleys
at Redwood City. If any Indian
bowlers happen to bob up with a
big score there, they might just as
well gather a little glory and have
their names posted along with the
rest.
Harry Soltero leads the list at
present with a substantial 239 —at
least that's the way it was at last
investigation.

SLANTS was written for
yesterday Louis Zamperini had
n't been heard from except for a
4:2(5 mile, but the U.S.C. cruiser
came home with a 4:14 against
Compton J. C. Saturday, and so
Slants looked slightly silly, to say
the least.
However, that still doesn't rule
out the statement that Burrows is
the candy in Coast miling this year.
Zamperini, incidentally, is fig
ured to be good enough for a double
win against Cal this Saturday. He is
supposed to breeze home in the mile
ahead of Sadaj and Mehlert, which
nobody in his right mind will argue
against, and then win the two-mile.
It might be another story, though,
if Z. np is pressed in the mile by
the two Bears. If there's one thing
Cal has this year it is distance men,
and Cooper and Vollmer in the
two-mile might give the Trojan a
heat if he gets a little tired in that
mile.
Cooper hasn't been playing up
verj much, but Dink Templeton
sayK he's the prettiest runner he has
seen in a long time, and the old
Dink is supposed to know. Vollmer
can run in the 9:3o's any day in the
week, and ii he has to run behind
somebody else for a while he might
g<-t lower than that.
Zamperini must be pretty good,
with all the talk that's going around,
but he hasn't any cinch double this
week. Conservative pickers will
probably have him second in the
two-mile.
