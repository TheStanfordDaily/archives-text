# Alumnus Gives Drop-kick Cup
## Publisher To Revive Football's 'Lost Art' 
### 
To stimulate Farm interest in the
! "lost art" of drop-kicking, Reginald
I Fernald, Santa Barbara publisher
! and Stanford alumnus, has donated
I a cup to the University.
In a letter accompanying the tro-
I phy, he said:
i
| "Even if we only won one game
' from California or U.S.C. by the
-| margin of a drop-kick by one who
j had become more or less interesed
I by reason of the cup, it would not
have been in vain."
The exact method of awarding the
| cup has not yet been determined, but
| it has been decided to present it
j each year after an intramural con-
I test. Minor sports coaches have
j scheduled a tentative meeting foi
! Thursday night to outline details of
| the award.
Harry Wolter, intramural director,
j said yesterday that the cup would
! probably be the permanent posses
j sion of the living group whose repre
sentative wins the competition for
I three successive years.
A strong proponent of drop-kick-
I ing, Mr. Fernald frequently sends to
j Stanford newspaper clippings telling
! feats of great drop-kickers. "1 am
tremendously enthusiastic about the
possibilities of this idea," he said in
a recent letter.
