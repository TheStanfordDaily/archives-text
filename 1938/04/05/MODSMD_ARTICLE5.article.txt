Dr. Kurt F. Bernhardt, associate
professor of German, spoke on "The
Practical Value of Philosophy" on
the Stanford University Radio Hour
yesterday evening.
"Philosophy is the love of wisdom,
a visdom that is creative, not only
to the mind of the possessor but to
his actions as well," said Dr. Rein
hardt.
"Philosophy is practical because
man by nature is a philosopher, a
rational or metaphysical animal.
Man cannot escape the practical im
plications of his own thinking, and
philosophy as a science is necessary
to give unity to his thought."
According to Dr. Reinhardt, phi
losophy is unique and independent
in its own province, and neither faith
not scientific technique can serve as
substitutes. He concludes, if suffi
cient education is provided, philos
ophy can be said to "fulfill its true
function, because then it will have
been restored to its time-honored
! place as the 'Queen of the Sciences'."
