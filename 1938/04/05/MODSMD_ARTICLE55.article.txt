# Take a Letter
## 
### 
BECAUSE only six men on Stanford's cham
pionship basketball squad turned in enough
playing time to earn Block "S"s, Coach John
Bunn has suggested to Ex Committee that it
relax the bars on the award regulations. The
proposal, which most probably will be adopted,
if any change is made, will allow minutes
played in conference play-offs to count toward
the letter.
It would take a mighty hard-hearted person
to say that some of the boys, other than the
lucky six, do not deserve the award. In the
first place, they, just as the magic line-up of
Luisetti, Calderwood, Stoefen, Zonne, and Lee,
were contributory to the team's success. In
the second place, with the original laughing
boys on the floor, some of the rest, good men
all, just didn't get a chance to show their stuff.
On almost any other team, they would have
had ample opportunity to rack up enough min
utes to win a letter in a walk-away.
The solution proposed is the logical one to
fill the bill. It is not going to open wide the
gates to second-rate players—"Oh, well, why
not give him one? He's a good guy." The
award is still based on performance. Restric
tions for an average season and an average
team will be left as they stand. Conference
play-offs come only with a championship team,
and it's during those seasons that the second
string lads lose out.
If Ex Committee passes the proposal, or some
similar one, the boys behind the scenes on this,
and future, wonder teams will get some of their
well-deserved crdit.—J. S.
