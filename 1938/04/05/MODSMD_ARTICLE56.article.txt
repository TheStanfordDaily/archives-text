# Farley Would Laugh
## 
### 
STANFORD held a typical student govern
ment caucus last night. Smoke piled up in
strata toward the ceiling and staggered in sur
realistic patterns toward the windows. Dining
room chairs, pressed into political service,
creaked as our heirs to Jeffersonian democracy
lilted back.
The president of the Alpha Alpha house
drifted around behind the Delta Phi delega
tion with his political axe ready for either
grinding or tomahawking. Consultation was
carried on in a tone carefully regulated to
reach the neighboring Zeta Zeta boys. And then
the Alpha president drifted back to his chair
with the look of a man who has put his foot on
the half-dollar somebody else dropped.
He settled in his chair, tilted it to an angle
that vetoed the law of gravity, and wished that
his girl could see him then.
Probably if that favored maiden could have
seen him she would have been duly impressed.
The whole scene looked like something out of
Lincoln Steffens; and it gave the manipulators
a pleasantly materialistic feeling to think that
the shades of Tweed and Croker were leaning
over their shoulders.
But if the shades of those illustrious pirates
had been anywhere in the house, they would
have been violently sick. Stanford's pocket edi
tions of Farley operate with a touch heavy
enough to stove in a battleship. Their forecast
ing has all the accuracy of those drugstore
scales that tell your fortune along with your
poundage.
But for that we cannot be blamed particularly.
After all we do our best to follow the shining
examples of vote-piracy that our elders set us.
The thing that covers our political sguirmings
with a blanket of comedy is the seriousness
with which the politicians take themselves.
It isn't particularly tragic to see a student
politician plowing through his memories like a
confused explorer through a jungle, looking for
some qualification his candidate possesses. It
is not heartbreaking to watch a politician who
has arrived at a caucus with only a wisp of an
idea as to how the other groups will stand on
his proposition. Nor is it more than slightly
depressing to hear the clumsy vehicle of con
versation by which deals are carried on.
But the gods of Tammany must smile when
the student boss sits down to reflect on his
achievements. It is time to laugh when a man
who could think of nothing in favor of his can
didate except that "He's a hell of a good guy,"
tells himself that he really put that one over.
Stanford's politicians do manage to keep their
noses above the electoral waters. But they don't
cut a dashing figure doing it. Regardless of
what they think, our political helmsmen are
not the greatest thing since the ice age. J. C.

enough to stove in a battleship. Their forecast
ing has all the accuracy of those drugstore
scales that tell your fortune along with your

But for that we cannot be blamed particularly.
After all we do our best to follow the shining
examples of vote-piracy that our elders set us.
The thing that covers our political sguirmings
with a blanket of comedy is the seriousness
with which the politicians take themselves.
It isn't particularly tragic to see a student
politician plowing through his memories like a
confused explorer through a jungle, looking for
some qualification his candidate possesses. It
is not heartbreaking to watch a politician who
has arrived at a caucus with only a wisp of an
idea as to how the other groups will stand on
his proposition. Nor is it more than slightly
depressing to hear the clumsy vehicle of con
versation by which deals are carried on.
But the gods of Tammany must smile when
the student boss sits down to reflect on his
achievements. It is time to laugh when a man
who could think of nothing in favor of his can
didate except that "He's a hell of a good guy,"
tells himself that he really put that one over.
Stanford's politicians do manage to keep their
noses above the electoral waters. But they don't
cut a dashing figure doing it. Regardless of
what they think, our political helmsmen are
not the greatest thing since the ice age. J. C.
STANFORD held a typical student govern
ment caucus last night. Smoke piled up in
strata toward the ceiling and staggered in sur
realistic patterns toward the windows. Dining
room chairs, pressed into political service,
creaked as our heirs to Jeffersonian democracy
lilted back.
The president of the Alpha Alpha house
drifted around behind the Delta Phi delega
tion with his political axe ready for either
grinding or tomahawking. Consultation was
carried on in a tone carefully regulated to
reach the neighboring Zeta Zeta boys. And then
the Alpha president drifted back to his chair
with the look of a man who has put his foot on
the half-dollar somebody else dropped.
He settled in his chair, tilted it to an angle
that vetoed the law of gravity, and wished that
his girl could see him then.
Probably if that favored maiden could have
seen him she would have been duly impressed.
The whole scene looked like something out of
Lincoln Steffens; and it gave the manipulators
a pleasantly materialistic feeling to think that
the shades of Tweed and Croker were leaning
over their shoulders.
But if the shades of those illustrious pirates
had been anywhere in the house, they would
have been violently sick. Stanford's pocket edi
tions of Farley operate with a touch heavy
enough to stove in a battleship. Their forecast
ing has all the accuracy of those drugstore
scales that tell your fortune along with your
poundage.
