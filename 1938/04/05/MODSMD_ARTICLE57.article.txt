# BULL SESSION
## CAUCUS RAUCUS 
### 
JJELLWETHER was around again last night to give
me the latest dope on his one-man campaign for
president of the Associated Students. He blew into the
Shack about 10, a gleam in his eye which bespoke a
certain lack of reverence for Stanford politics.
"Boy, am I going strong!" he said. "You remember
you said I had to have some sort of organized back
ing—Row, or Hall? Well, I want you to know you're
looking at the first candidate ever to have the back
ing of both."
"What?"
"Look me over. The unanimous choice of both
factions —or two caucuses, anyway."
"Oh. I might have known there'd be a catch to it."
"It's nothing to scoff at. Signed, sealed, and deliv
ered on the dotted line. Bellwether for President."
"All right. Go on. Tell what happened."
"Well, you know how it is. Everybody's perfectly
willing to slit everybody else's throat if he thinks he
can get anything out of it. So I went to one of the
Hall caucuses this afternoon, just to see what would
happen."
"And they threw you out?"
"I should say not. I more or less intimated to
them that I was a disgruntled Row man—you know
the sort of approach. The house behind me . . . house
disgruntled too . . . don't intend to fall in line with
all the other sheep . . . thought maylje if we could
work out some sort of a—see what I mean? Well,
they saw right enough, and in no time at all your
old friend Bellwether was passing out patronage right
and left. Of course, I did have to do a little pre
varicating about what house I belonged to, but after
all, you know. Politics."
"And they believed you?"
"Almost without question. But that isn't all."
"No?"
"I should say not. After I got through getting
the Halls behind me, I decided I might as well com
plete the job, so I dropped in on the Row about an
hour ago and gave them the works."
"The same works?"
"Well, practically. I debated for a while whether
I shouldn't give 'em the old hold-up gag. We'd like to
go in with the Row . . . but we can't quite see eye
to eye with Certain People, and so we're seriously
considering lining up with the Halls in this matter
. . . and you know how bad that would look, so
come across, buddy, come across."
"But you decided against that."
"It would have been too easy for them to phone
around and check up on my house, I'm afraid. I fi
nally ended by giving them the same story I gave
the Halls. My club and I ... it seems we couldn't
find anyone we felt like supporting . . . and we
didn't agree with the Hall policies . . . and so we
thought perhaps we could—maybe?"
'And they fell for that?"
"Everyone's a sucker, these days. You may dis
trust your own side like the devil, but you're always
ready to believe that certain groups of the enemy, im
pressed with the worth of your cause, are panting
to come over and support it. It's only sense for me
to take advantage of this trusting faith that people
aren't going to do what they're supposed to do when
the time comes. And it's perfectly logical for both
sides to vote for me; after all, haven't I promised 'em
both everything?"
"And supposing you should have to make good?"
"That, my friend, is something for me to know and
them to find out about."
"Bellwether," I said, "you are a politician!"
He smiled.
'In my way,' he said complacently. "In my own
small way."
