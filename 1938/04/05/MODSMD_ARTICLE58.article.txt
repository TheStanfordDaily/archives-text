THE end of last week we mentioned some of the
difficulties whieh composers in America have
trying to combine creative art with eating three square
meals a day. Most of them must compromise and
either turn their art into a paying, but Jess worth
while business, or seek some other means of support,
using their talents in their ofT time. Either arrange
ment is far from satisfactory. But now, as ever, art
often docs not pay.
I think that we are gradually swinging away from
the great era of materialism and utilitarianism when
art, having no apparent practical value, was looked
down upon. Perhaps one of the reasons for the pres
ent change is the fact that the greatest Phillistine of
them all, the business man, finds that art pays, and
pays in a big way. Hence the new attempts to add
beauty to commercial products, to put shiny labels
and streamlined containers on all articles.

I>ERHAPS this new consciousness of art and beauty
will lead to the time when art, irrespective of its
practical value in a commercial way, will be supported
as an essential part of every civilization. For instance,
governments might (as few do) subsidize their na
tional artists, not as an overgrown chamber of com
merce—to advertise the nation—but simply because
they are artists.
But governments are not very reliable agents for the
fostering of literature, painting, and music. Somehow,
their judgment seems universally bad—perhaps be
cause it really isn't their field.
What would be even better—in the realm of litera
ture, say—would be to have presses, sufficiently well
set up financially 1o publish books which do not have
a great commercial value, but which are perhaps great
er literature than most of the stuff which flood* the
market today. It isn't that the publishing houses are
cold to the work which has a small appeal but is
good literature, but, being first of all business houses,
they just can't take the chance very oflen. Perhaps
some philanthropist could put himself down as a real
friend to struggling writers by endowing a Memorial
Press, able to exist independent of the sales, and
devoted to publishing really good books.
|N AMERICA, at present, a group of musicians have
come together, publishing monthly under the
title, "New Music," their own works. Because of the
small appeal to the general public, much of the music
there published would otherwise go unheard.
But the best solution of all is the MacDowell Col
ony, in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Founded after
the death of Edward MacDowell by his wife, the col
ony maintains a group of artists who work, unham
pered and free from the worries which usually beset
the creative workers in this mechanical and money
mad day. Musicians, writers, painters, sculptors min
gle, each having his own little cottage to work in, un
disturbed, and unrestricted. Admission is obtained by
the applicants sincere interest in creative arts, and
with qualifications attested by two recognized artists.
Contributions and the initial endowment maintain
the colony financially. Here is what we want. And
the sooner that more such projects are realized, the
better it will be. Stone.
