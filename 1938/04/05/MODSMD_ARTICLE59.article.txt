# 'Chicago' Has Life, Lacks Real Power
## 
### 
If one doesn't mind seeing "San
Francisco" done over by a differ
ent studio, with a different cast,
and practically the same story, then
one probably will like "In Old Chi
cago," currently playing at the
Stanford.
If one hasn't seen '"San Francisco,"
then the aforementioned one will

undoubtedly enjoy
"In Old Chicago"
even more. It is a
fast-moving, sure
fire entertainment
show even if it
doesn't quite hit
the pinnacle 20th
Century-Fox set
up for it. For
some reason the
intended power

and sincerity of the picture don't
ring true.
The fault probably lies with the
story, because Don Ameche, Alice
Faye, Tyrone Power and Alice
Brady all turn in top-notch per
formances. Power's multitude of ad
mirers get a chance to see him with
his hair mussed for a change—and
before his palpitating feminine fans
fall dead, let me say that he looks
just as handsome.
Brady Steals Show
Alice Brady, however, steals the
picture with a genuine and appeal
ing portrayal of the very Irish Mrs.
O'Leary, whose cow knocked over
an open lantern, thus precipitating
the great fire, around which the
story is built.
The fire is very interesting, and
all the people run around and make
a lot of noise, but ail it really adds
to the story is that it is the means
of killing Don Ameche (Jack
O'Leary) when everybody in the
house wanted Power (Dion O'Leary)
to die.
Power turns in a role of the mas
ter rat, and everybody was of the
opinion that he should have died,
seeing »show it didn't make much
difference to the price of wheat in
China anyway.
Alice Faye—Aaahhli!
La Belle Faye is just as beautiful
as ever and every man in the house
held his breath when she appeared
in the kind of clothes that are sup
posed to make a man hold his
breath.
The story is very old, that of two
brothers on opposite sides of the
law. As usual the good brother has
to sacrifice to make the undeserving
kin see the error of his ways. How
ever, the story is rapid-moving and
interesting and is decidedly worth
seeing—provided one isn't looking
for an epic.
"In Old Chicago" runs an hour
and 52 minutes. Supporting is a hi
larious Robert Benchley entitled "A
Night at the Movies" that is guar
anteed to make you laugh 'til your
eyes water; completing the bill arc
a news reel and a Walt Disney Silly
Symphony.—Mayer
