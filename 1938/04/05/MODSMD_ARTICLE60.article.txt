The Editor, Sir:
This fellow Marco Thome has the
right idea about a future War Me
morial. Things right now point so
directly to war that such a satire as
he is making may be a very effective
instrument in preventing propa
ganda and pro war feeling. I am
sure that the sentiments of this gen
eration are much more opposed to
war than was the corresponding
generation in 1917, and by such ac
tion as Thorne is taking I believe
that these sentiments can become
manifest. Thus I believe that
Thorne s idea and any other similar
ideas should be encouraged and en
larged upon to further insure peace
to our country.
A Sincere Pacifist
