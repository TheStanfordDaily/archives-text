# Excom Ponders More Hoop Awards Tonight
## 
### 
Because only six varsity basketball players have played enough min
utes this season to be eligible for a Block S, Ex Committee tonight will
consider making an exception to the rules this year to allow several
others to win the awards.
Several requests have been made for such a change, said A.S.S.U.
President Tom Killefer yesterday. In past years these awards have often

•totaled nine or ten.
Eligible for Block S's are Hank
| Luisetti, H. B. Lee, Jack Calder
i wood, Art Stoefen, Phil Zonne, and
j Tom Siebert. One other letter is
| allowed, as the rules now stand, if
| a player is considered exceptional
I by unanimous vote of his coach, the
general manager, and Ex Commit
tee.
i
Also up for consideration tonight
J is the proposal for a constitutional
! amendment allowing initiative ac
' tion. Need for this was seen by
! some after ski enthusiasts' fruitless
j attempt last quarter to have skiing
j recognized as a minor sport. After
| conferring with Dean Kirkwood of
j the Law School, A.S.S.U.'s constitu-
I tional adviser, Killefer considers the
| plan worthy of consideration.
A newly-organized married men's
I association will submit a budget for
!Ex Committee appi'oval. A mar-
I ried women's society has been op
' erating for some time on a budget
J under A.S.S.U. supervision.
