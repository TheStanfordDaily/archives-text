# Character Play In Rehearsal
## 'Kind Lady' Features Psychopathic Roles 
### 
Psychopathic cases run through
the characterizations of "Kind
Lady," the drama department's
forthcoming melodrama to be pre
sented May 14, 15, and 16 under
the direction of H. Miles Heberer.
The leads, an individualistic mid
dle-aged woman and an eccentric
young man, will be played by Kath
leen Campbell and Hal Kahn, prom
inent in Farm dramatics.
The woman is Mary Herries, a
charming independent person who
lives almost alone in her London
home. Financially secure, Miss
Herries pursues what hobbies and
pastimes she likes to fill her almost
friendless life. Traveling, collecting
objects of art, and charitable deeds
occupy most of her time.
The young man is Henry Abbott,
a brilliant but. idle, lazy di'eamer.
Unsuccessful at most trades, Abbott
has even turned to painting, but he
has never sold anything. Complete
ly destitute, he has finally compelled
his wife to support him scrubbing
floors.
When coincidence drops Abbott
into the home of Miss Herries his
shrewd mind works, and he plans to
include himself in on her fortune.
Henry Abbott will be Hal Kahn's
first serious leading role this year.
Besides directing the "Big Game
Gaieties" and appearing in "Mur
der in the Cathedral" last fall, Kahn
played in "A Winter's Tale" last
quarter.
