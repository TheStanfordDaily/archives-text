### BILL MILLIS 
A LMOST a year ago Socialist
Premier Leon Blum was en
deavoring, unsuccessfully, to main
tain the first French Popular Front
cabinet in power.
Yesterday, Blum, who has headed
the French cabinet during the last
three weeks of European crisis,
since the fall of Camille Chautemps,
appeared resigned to the early
overthrow of his own regime.
After a day in which wild bar
tering of insults and threatened
fisticuffs forced the Chamber of
Deputies to suspend consideration
of a series of drastic finance bills
to cope with a treasury crisis, "it
became a certainty"—as the diplo
matic observers put it—that the
government will soon be over
thrown.
Last night the figure of War Min
ister Edouard Daladier, a member
of the Moderate Republican and
completely misnamed Radical So
cialist Party, emerged as the prob
able head of a new stop-gap cab
inet which would have the sole but
difficult purpose of attempting to
hold office until a "national union"
.government patterned after the
World War model could be organ
ized.
In the background is Edouard
Herriot, Radical Socialist boss of
Lyons and a dominant French poli
tician of the post-war years when
France was dominant in Europe. Be
cause of his "neutrality" in the pres
ent conflict, Herriot is in a position
to emerge on top in a national un
ion government.
* Jj« *
•> r jiHE war is won," Insurgent
Generalissimo Franco's Radio
Salamanca broadcast yesterday,
while Rebel troops tightened their
strangulation grip around Catalonia,
which is now virtually isolated from
the rest of Loyalist Spain.
A few Republican "suicide
squads" remained in the Ebro
River seaport of Tortosa, but
Rebel artillery emplacements had
halted all traffic on the Barce
lona-Valencia coast road. Insur
gent warships cruised along the
Mediterranean, ready to join in
the bombardment.
General Franco is considering
sending a "surrender or else" ulti
matum to Barcelona, but there Loy
alist Premier Juan Negrin reorgan
ized his cabinet, took over prac
tically dictatorial powers. All Cata
lonian war industries were halted
for an hour, after Insurgents seized
vital utility plants near the Pyren
nes.
A prime source of international
conflict since its inception, Spain's
civil war in its present agony is
emerging as problem of the day for
the European power-politics diplo
macy by which "peace is to be
maintained" — balanced on bayon
ets.
The Barcelona cabinet, not dis
couraged by previous diplomatic
rebuffs, last night appealed to France
and Great Britain for arms and mu
nitions for a final stand, but there
are no indications that those powers
will lift the policy which they call
"non-intervention."
r jPHE "recession" that is now be
ing recognized as a depression
fully as serious as that commenced
in l!)2f) is becoming the first polit
ical worry plaguing the sixth year
of the New Deal.
Yesterday President Roosevelt
vetoed government subsidies as a
lonic for "sick industries," overr
looking that the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation inaugurated
by former President Herbert Hoo
ver and continued by the present
Administration has done exactly
that.
In the group and sectional rival
ries of American real-politics, busi
ness is now replacing labor and ag
riculture as the first concern of gov
ernment. Mr. Roosevelt's address to
Congress on the plight of the rail
roads, promised for the coming
week, should indicate measures for
Recovery that can be expected under
the newest phase of the New Deal.
I) RITAIN s fear of a combination
<>f other European powers was
an important factor in starting the
world's present navy race, Admiral
William D. Leahy, chief of naval
operations, told the Senate Naval
Affairs Committee yesterday.
Hut the "combinations" which
threaten England do not affect the
United States, Leahy assured the
committee during a closed bear
ing on the $1,121,000,000 naval ex
pansion bill. The building of three
15.000-ton super-battleships, in
stead of three of only 35.00(1 tons,
was urged by the admiral.

Borah mid C. L. McNary refused to

gressional TVA investigation com
mittee named yesterday. Optim
ist -of-t he-day is Bancamerica head
