# Excom Hits At Illegality In Balloting
## Voters Must Present Student Body Clards At Election Polls 
### 
In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places — two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
The following were approved as
election assistants:
Paul Baker, Neil Ballard, Ted
Moreno, Bobbie Mitchell, Jane
Lynch, Martha Benson, Vivian Borr-
man, Bill Leckie, Bill Kimball,
| Yvonne Hazlett, Ann Hodge, Har
i riet Hall, Betty Baker, Nancy Cas
well, Bob Crawford, Greyson Bryan,
Marvin Frank, and Jean McKee.
Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided, there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
quirements.
Seven Hoop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
had been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Killefer, is that often only five
or six players are eligible in cham-
pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
(2) lessening the time required in
conference play-offs to qualify a
player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.
Circle "S" awards granted were as
follows:
GYMNASTICS: Florian Frank,
Bill Grannis, Allan Kittell, Lomax
Turner, and Kenneth Payne, man-
ager.
FENCING: Morton Davies, John
DeBenedetti, Edwin Woods, and
Herbert Woolley.
BOXING: Carlton Boyd, Hugh
Gallarneau, Douglas Grant, Bob
Hovey, McNamara Pope, Wayne
Raley, John B. Rice, Harold Saun-
ders, William Wilber, and Bennett
Raffin, manager.
FROSH BASKETBALL: Don Bur
ness, Kenneth Davidson, Tilford
Denton, Stan Graff, Bill Marshall,
Bill Masters, Bill Niccolls, Bill
Rumbley, James Taylor, and Don
Williams.
I Other business included the fol
lowing:
MARRIED MEN: A budget of $75
was approved for the remainder of
spring quarter. Student Manager
Chuck Fontius explained that the
married men pay just as much in
community fees as other students
but get less return on their money.
"I guess their wives keep them
home, and they don't get into so
many things as we do," he suggested.
JAPANESE VISITORS: A request

250 members of the Northern Culi
-1 fornia Japanese International Col
legiate Advance was denied, because
"they will ve on the Campus for
only two hours and have a very full
program scheduled."

In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places — two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
The following were approved as
election assistants:
Paul Baker, Neil Ballard, Ted
Moreno, Bobbie Mitchell, Jane
Lynch, Martha Benson, Vivian Borr-
man, Bill Leckie, Bill Kimball,
| Yvonne Hazlett, Ann Hodge, Har
i riet Hall, Betty Baker, Nancy Cas
well, Bob Crawford, Greyson Bryan,
Marvin Frank, and Jean McKee.
Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided, there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
quirements.
Seven Hoop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
had been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Killefer, is that often only five
or six players are eligible in cham-
pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
(2) lessening the time required in
conference play-offs to qualify a
player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.
Circle "S" awards granted were as
follows:
GYMNASTICS: Florian Frank,
Bill Grannis, Allan Kittell, Lomax
Turner, and Kenneth Payne, man-
ager.
FENCING: Morton Davies, John
DeBenedetti, Edwin Woods, and
Herbert Woolley.
BOXING: Carlton Boyd, Hugh
Gallarneau, Douglas Grant, Bob
Hovey, McNamara Pope, Wayne
Raley, John B. Rice, Harold Saun-
ders, William Wilber, and Bennett

FROSH BASKETBALL: Don Bur

Williams.
I Other business included the fol
lowing:
MARRIED MEN: A budget of $75
was approved for the remainder of
spring quarter. Student Manager
Chuck Fontius explained that the
married men pay just as much in
community fees as other students
but get less return on their money.
"I guess their wives keep them
home, and they don't get into so
many things as we do," he suggested.
JAPANESE VISITORS: A request

In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places — two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
The following were approved as
election assistants:
Paul Baker, Neil Ballard, Ted
Moreno, Bobbie Mitchell, Jane
Lynch, Martha Benson, Vivian Borr-
man, Bill Leckie, Bill Kimball,
| Yvonne Hazlett, Ann Hodge, Har
i riet Hall, Betty Baker, Nancy Cas
well, Bob Crawford, Greyson Bryan,
Marvin Frank, and Jean McKee.
Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided, there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
quirements.
Seven Hoop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
had been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Killefer, is that often only five
or six players are eligible in cham-
pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
(2) lessening the time required in
conference play-offs to qualify a
player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.
Circle "S" awards granted were as
follows:
GYMNASTICS: Florian Frank,
Bill Grannis, Allan Kittell, Lomax
Turner, and Kenneth Payne, man-
ager.
FENCING: Morton Davies, John
DeBenedetti, Edwin Woods, and
Herbert Woolley.
BOXING: Carlton Boyd, Hugh
Gallarneau, Douglas Grant, Bob
Hovey, McNamara Pope, Wayne
Raley, John B. Rice, Harold Saun-
ders, William Wilber, and Bennett
Raffin, manager.
FROSH BASKETBALL: Don Bur
ness, Kenneth Davidson, Tilford
Denton, Stan Graff, Bill Marshall,
Bill Masters, Bill Niccolls, Bill
Rumbley, James Taylor, and Don
