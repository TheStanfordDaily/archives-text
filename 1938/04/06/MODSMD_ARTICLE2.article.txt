# Excom Hits At Illegality In Balloting
## Voters Must Present Student Body Clards At Election Polls 
### 
j In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
| peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical .student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places—two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
The following were approved as
election assistants:
Paul Baker, Neil Ballard, Ted
Moreno, Bobbie Mitchell, Jane
j Lynch, Martha Benson, Vivian Borr-
I man, Bill Leckie, Bill Kimball,
| Yvonne Hazlett, Ann Hodge, Har
i riet Hall, Betty Baker, Nancy Cas
| well. Bob Crawford, Greyson Bryan,
] Marvin Frank, and Jean McKee.
Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided. there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
| position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
j quirements.
Seven lloop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
j tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
hod been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Kiliefer, is that often only five
j or six players are eligible in cham-
I pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
I He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
; (2) lessening the time required in
i conference play-offs to qualify a
j player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
i Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.
Circle "S" awards granted were as
follows:
GYMNASTICS: Florian Frank,
Bill Grannis, Allan Kittel 1, Lomax
i Turner, and Kenneth Payne, man-
I ager.
FENCING: Morton Davies, John
Deßenedetti, Edwin Woods, and
Herbert Wool ley.
BOXING: Carlton Boyd, Hugh

FROSH BASKETBALL: Don Bur
ness, Kenneth Davidson, Tilford
! Denton, Stan Graff, Bill Marshall,
| Bill Masters, Bill Niccolls, Bill
i Rumbley, James Taylor, and Don
j Williams.
I Other business included the fol
i lowing:
MARRIED MEN: A budget of $75
; was approved for the remainder of
spring quarter. Student Manager
Chuck Fontius explained that the
i married men pay just as much in
I community fees as other students
j but get less return on their money.
"I guess their wives keep them
i home, and they don't get into so
i many things as we do," he suggested.

j In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
| peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical .student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places—two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
The following were approved as
election assistants:
Paul Baker, Neil Ballard, Ted
Moreno, Bobbie Mitchell, Jane
j Lynch, Martha Benson, Vivian Borr-
I man, Bill Leckie, Bill Kimball,
| Yvonne Hazlett, Ann Hodge, Har
i riet Hall, Betty Baker, Nancy Cas
| well. Bob Crawford, Greyson Bryan,
] Marvin Frank, and Jean McKee.
Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided. there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
| position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
j quirements.
Seven lloop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
j tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
hod been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Kiliefer, is that often only five
j or six players are eligible in cham-
I pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
I He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
; (2) lessening the time required in
i conference play-offs to qualify a
j player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
i Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.

Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only

Amendment Sought
On Tuesday's ballot, it was de
cided. there will be an amendment
reducing qualifications for the two
Men's Council members elected win
ter quarter from 120 units to 115
units. Riddell pointed out that the
existing requirement opened the
| position only to seniors who were
planning to return the following
year.
Ex Committee's approval of ath
letic awards ended in a long dis
cussion of the pros and cons of
awarding letters under certain cir
cumstances, although the athletes
have not actually fulfilled the re
j quirements.
Seven lloop Awards
j The committee did, however, ten
j tatively okay the awarding of Block
"S" to seven members of the var
sity basketball team, one of whom
hod been recommended by Coach
John Bunn because of "exceptional
work in the sport during the sea
son."
Chief objection to the present
system of awarding basketball let
ters, according to A.S.S.U. President
Tom Kiliefer, is that often only five
j or six players are eligible in cham-
I pionship years.
Bunn Suggests
I He quoted Mr. Bunn as favoring
legislation either (1) allowing the
coach to grant up to three extra
letters in championship years, or
; (2) lessening the time required in
i conference play-offs to qualify a
j player for a letter.
Members decided to see what
i Coach Bunn has to say about the
problem at some future meeting.
Circle "S" awards granted were as
follows:
GYMNASTICS: Florian Frank,
Bill Grannis, Allan Kittel 1, Lomax
i Turner, and Kenneth Payne, man-
I ager.

; was approved for the remainder of

j In an attempt to curb multiple
voting in next Tuesday's election,
Ex Committee decided last night
that voters must show their student
body cards in order to get ballots.
Overzealous "Farm-Farleys" have
| peeked at the check - list in past
I elections, complained Election Chair
man Dick Riddell, and then have
given the name of a medical .student
or some other person who had not
yet voted.
Four Polling Places
To prevent delay, voters will be
assigned alphabetically to four poll
ing places—two near the Engineering
Corner, two near the Romanic Lan
guages Building — instead of only
two as in past elections.
