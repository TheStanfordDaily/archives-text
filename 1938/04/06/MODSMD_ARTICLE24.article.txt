# Farm Author Writes "Best First Novel"
## 
### 
On display at the bookstore to
day, the scrapbook of Albert J.
Guerard, Jr., Stanford graduate and
son of Stanford Professor Albert
Guerard, Sr., contains nearly 50
newspaper clippings about his book,
"The Past Must Alter," declared by
the author and critic, James Branch
Cabell, the "best first novel ever
written by an American."
Originally published in England
in September. 1937, the novel has
been republished in America, and
35 autographed copies of the first
American edition are now available
at the bookstore.
"I went down early and signed
them allâ€”thank God!" laughed the
harassed 23-year-old author, who
has been kept very busy since the
American publication of his book.
On May 7 Guerard will speak at
the California Writers' Club in Ber
keley, comparing Henry James with
more recent novelists. He refers to
James as one of his favorite writers,
one after whom he likes to pattern
his own works.
He will also speak at Paul Elder's
Gallery in San Francisco on May 3
and is to be interviewed over the
radio on Joseph Henry Jackson's
Sunday night book hour some time
in the near future.
At present an agent of the pub
lisher is going up and down the
coast arranging more dates for the
Stanford author.
