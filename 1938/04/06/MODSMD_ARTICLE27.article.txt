(Editor's Noie: Jerry May.;:'
takes over for Wall Peterson today
as guest columnist for the pur
pose of reviewing the California
(nu k situation.;
I j NIVERSITY of Southern Cali
fornia has ihe greatest track
team in the world today! I don't
say Stanford or California won't
beat the Trojans; oh no, I'm much
too subtle for that. But I do say
that if the Indians and Bears do
come through it will be by the grace
of God.
Next Saturday, while Stanford is
oying with U.C.L.A. on Angeil
Field, the Trojans and Bears will
tangle in Berkeley in what should
be a whopper of a meet. Cal boasts
its finest team in years, Art Rosen
baum in the Chronicle picks S. C.
by a mere half-point, and Berkeley
ites are looking for an upset.
1 hey needn't hotlur. S.C. will
win the meet hands down. How
es er, from the standpoint of indi
vidual performances, every event
should he a thriller and provide
an excellent • time, distance or
height. Which brings us down to
the purpose of this column—to re
view the possibilities of the va
rious standout athletes of Cali
fornia.
At. the moment Arnold Nutting of
Cal looks the class of the sprinters,
but Adrian Talley of S.C., who
cleaned up the Coast last year, isn't
in the best of shape yet. Then
there's Wilbur Miller, Compton J.C.
negro, who beat Payton Jordan and
Talley in 9.8 in a meet with S.C.
last week. In the same meet Miller
rang up a 47.1 quartermile to estab
lish himself as a definite threat to
Ray Malott—if they should ever
meet.
Stan Hiserman doesn't compare
with any of the above in the 100,
but in the 220 it's a different story.
Stanford's Stan turned in a 21.2
performance at Fresno, which is
easily the best on the Coast so far.
Jordan and Nutting, however, are
also potential 21 fiat men.
The quartermile is pretty weak
this year, with only Malott and
Miller looming up as extraordi
nary. Charles Miller of Cal is
above average, but noti n the
class of the above. Erwin Miller,
transfer to S.C. from Chaffey J.C.,
is another pretty good boy al
though he is handicapped at the
present from a recent flu attack.
Until last week the 880 was con
sidered one of S.C.'s weak events,
but then Phil Roulac ran 1:53
against Compton to dispel that fal
lacy. Roulac's improvement is phe
nomenal, considering that his fast
est time last year was 1:58. Cal has
a brigade of capable half-milers, in
cluding Elton Wieman, DeMotte
Modisette, Leonard Spencer, and
Deming Maclise, all of whom can
do around 1:55. Carl Mahurin,
Stanford's injured 880 man, is ca
pable of trouncing the whole mess
—if he can get into shape.
Stan Sadaj, Cal's soldier-man, is
the class of the two-milers, next
to Zainperini and Burrows. Sa
daj's 9.46.!) against U.C.L.A. is
speedy time, but when Zamperini
and Burrows meet, I predict that
the winner will he 20 seconds
lower than that — provided, of
course, that both men start the
race fresh.
S.C., as usual, has the class of the
hurdlers. Jim Humphreys isn't any
Sam Klopstock or Roy Staley, but
he's easily better than the rest of
the Coast's mediocre crop of high
barrier artists. Bill Lacefield, Ucla
sophomore, has possibilities, and Bill
Hawkins and Dick Simpson can give
Humphreys a good race—but that's
about all.
Cal Coach Brutus Hamilton made
a significant change when he shifted
George Anderson to the low hurdles
from the sprints. The former "white
hope" sprinter lost by inches to
U.C.L.A.'s Tom Berkeley, who is no
slouch, and with experience the
Bear might easily become the best
low hurdler on the Coast. Right
now, red-headed Earl Vickery of
Troy enjoys the honor.
