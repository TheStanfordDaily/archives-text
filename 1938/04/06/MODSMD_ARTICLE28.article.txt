# Varsity Loses Bronc Battle 6-3
## Cards Drop Division For First S.C. Win; Ball Hit Out of Lot 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity
basebali team obligingly ended
Santa Clara's losing streak at eight
straight games yesterday alternoon
on the Sunken Diamond when they
dropped a (5-3 decision to the last
place Broncs, giving the C.1.8.A.
tailenders their first conference vic
tory in nine starts.
Broncs Collect 11 Hits
Ed Changala, Bronc centerfielder,
led an 11-hit attack on Glenn Ham
ilton, who went the distance, with
three hits in four trips to the plate.
One of Changala's hits was a long
home run over the left field in the
first inning. It was the second time
in C.1.8.A. history that a ball had
been hit out of the Stanford park,
Red Holman accomplishing the feat
last year for the first time.
Indians Die on Bases
Stanford, paced by Wally deWitt
and Hamilton with three safeties in
four times at bat apiece, collected
nine hits off "Pat" Patterson, who
went the route for Santa Clara. The
Indians failed to make their blows
count, however, leaving ten men
stranded on the base lines.
