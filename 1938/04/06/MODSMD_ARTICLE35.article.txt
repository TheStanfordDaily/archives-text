# Bears Favored In Swim Meet
## Rider, Needham Expected To Win 
### 
For the first time in 20 years,
California's varsity swimming team
will be favored to defeat the Stan
ford squad when they meet this
Saturday afternoon in the Encina
Pools.
The Bears beat Nort Thornton's
favorites in an upset last year to
become the dual meet champs of
the Coast. Stanford later came back
the conference meet to win the
official conference title.
Olympic Club Tops
Only common foe to defeat both
teams this year has been the Olym
pic Club. Cal has also defeated
U.C.L.A. and lost a tight meet to
U.S.C. Stanford meets the two
| southern conference members in
j postponed duels a week after the
J California struggle.
The Indians' only sure bet seems
to be in the 440-yard free-style
j with Captain Dave Rider and Win
j Needham liable to come in together
I in another dead heat.
Rider Takes Second
Since losing to Henry Paris, San
Francisco speedster, the all-Ameri
can twins have improved enough to
be rated the fastest collegiate quar
ter-mile men on the coast. Rider
also recently copped second place
|in the national collegiate 1500-
! meter grind behind John Macionis
| of Yale to demonstrate that he is
back in stride.
Not since Emie Brandsten was
coach at the Berkeley swimming
hole have the Bears been able to
| take two in a row from Stanford,
j Brandsten, head of all local water
activities, and Coach Thornton have
j managed to win every year until
last year's debacle.
