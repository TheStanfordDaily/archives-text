# Frosh Trackmen Set for Meet
## 
### 
Bill Ellington's yearling trackmen
will go into their third meet of the

season next Saturday against the
Peninsula All-Stars, combed from
all peninsula high school cinder
squads.
The frosh will enter this meet with
a clean slate and wins over San Ma
teo J. C. and the Alameda and
Contra Costa all-star team to their
credit. Standouts on the squad, such
as Sid Hays in the hurdles and Al
len Grey in the shot, have yet to be
pressed in competition this year.
According to Ellington, the frosh
have the prospects of a great half
miler in Jim Lincoln, heretofore
high-jumper and javelin tosser.
Lincoln ran away from the field Sun
day afternoon in his first 880 run
since he came to the Farm. All
frosh point-getters are set for the
meet with the exception of Macki,
javelin star, ineligible for the
quarter.
The meet scheduled yesterday
afternoon with Sacred Heart high
from the city has been postponed a
week because of rain fears.
