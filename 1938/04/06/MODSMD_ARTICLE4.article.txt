# Organist To Give Lecture Program
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will give the first of several
lecture programs on "Music in the
Baroque Era" this evening at 7:30
o'clock.
This will be the first of three pro
grams to be devoted to "The Passion
According to St. Matthew," by Jo
hann Sebastian Bach. Bach's work
is chosen because it shows the con
tinuation of so many features of the
Baroque styleâ€”the double chorus
and orchestra, the elaboration of the
Lutheran chorale, and the florid solo
passages.
The recordings used in these pro
grams were made in performance
last year, under the direction of
Serge Koussevitszky. The choral
forces of Harvard University and
Radcliffe College under the leader
ship of Wallace Wood worth were
accompanied by the Boston Sym
phony Orchestra. Later programs
will feature operatic, dance, and
choral styles in Baroque secular
musie.
