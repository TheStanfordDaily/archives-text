# A 						Bird Out of Hand

LAST year, a plan was introduced by Jim
Reynolds, then president of th£ A.S.S.U.,
which v/as going to revolutionize student office
holding. The general spring election was to
be moved up several weeks, winners would
have a training period of at least a month in
their new jobs. The efficiency, it was hoped,
would be terrific.
It was as simple as that, and seemed to fall
into the category of things we should have
thought of before. Proponents said there was
everything to gain and nothing to lose, or as
Dr. Wilbur phrased it at the time, the new office
holders couldn't be any worse.
So Ex Committee changed the date, and we
settled down to wait for Utopia.
At this point, elections are almost here, and
by all precedent our Utopia should be appear
ing as a small cloud on the horizon. But the
clouds these days seem only to indicate rain.
The trouble apparently is that we had some
thing to lose after all. We lost the long spring
build-up for the big election of the year and the
natural winnowing out of candidates that it has
given. In the past week A.S.S.U. presidential
candidates hav6 appeared like rabbits from a
stage magician's hat.
In return we will get the hypothetical value
of an extra three weeks or a month of training
for our newly elected officers. And from this
/ear's officers, who themselves were elected
earlier than their predecessors, there are reports
that the training they got was negligible. Even
doubled that isn't much.
We traded, it seems, a system that would bet
ter select the candidates for a system which
quietly hopes for miracles in three weeks.
