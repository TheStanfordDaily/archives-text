# Of Rats and Men

### 
BACK in the days when only chorus girls
had legs, sentimentality was cultivated like
a hot-house plant, and any editor who wanted
to start trouble could do it by writing on vivi
section. Terrific debates went on fate
of our "poor dumb friends," and emotional ar
guments were pyramided into fantastic struc
tures. But by the second decade of this century,
most people seemed to realize that to trade the
lives of guinea pigs for the lives of human
beings was very good business.
The anti-vivisectionist movement should have
died then, leaving its memories to be buried
with the mustache cup and the celluloid collar.
But it did not. In this enlightened and scientific
year of 1938 California is considering a law to
impede experimental use of animals.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's president,
is leading the fight against the measure. With
him are men like Robert Millikan and Robert
Gordon Sproul. But the pressure groups that
believe men should die so that white rats may
live cannot be convinced that experts in science
know what they are talking about.
It is amazing to think that sentimentalists can
observe the progress of medicine and still
maintain that the use of animals does not con
tribute to society. Such sentimentalists should
have been put away in lavender along with
Grandmother's sampler and her fur muff.
It is easy to become disgusted with men
who think that mice must be protected at all
cost. Unfortunately becoming disgusted with
them does not solve the problem. Instead, doc
tors must waste their time defending actions
which should need no defense.
Probably most anti - vivisectionists carry
around a picture of an appealing dog being
torn to quivering pieces by a wolf-toothed
dragon in a white coat. They do not care to
correct this picture. For something like 50 years
they have clung to it as an old maid clings to
her only love-letter.
It is useless to tell them that we cannot de
liberately starve men to make controlled ex
periments on pellagra. The an*i vivisectionists
do not have pellagra. It does no good to tell
them that animals must be used in experiments
on cancer cure. They are not interested in
cancer.
To bo fair we must give the unli vivisection

ists credit for perseverance. If they were them
selves white rats they couldn't show more de
termination, although as cynics suggests per
haps they would show more intelligence.
But doctors who need experimental animals
are not likely to appreciate that determination.
And sick men who are looking to the doctors
for help won't think much of it.
Evidently the anti-vivisectionists are disgust
ingly healthy, and have plenty of sympathy
to spare. But disgusted doctors may be right
when they suggest that white rats and anti
vivisectionists have more in common than
sympathy.â€”J. C.
