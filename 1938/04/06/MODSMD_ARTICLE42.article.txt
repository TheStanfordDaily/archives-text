PRESSURE POLITICS
I>ELLWETHER stopped by as usual last night with
the latest, looking every inch the campus poli
tician. I was afraid for a moment he was going to
slap me on the back, but he evidently thought better
of it, contenting himself with a piercing stare and what
he probably thought was a vote-getting smile.
"You know," he began, "this business about va
rious people voting various different ways to nominate
various people when they have already nominated
various other people, reminds me very much of one
of those caucuses I was telling you about yesterday,
the one that nominated me."
"I notice your caucuses didn't get your name an
nounced in The Daily," I said.
"A mere detail, a mere detail. I arrived at this
particular caucus, as you remember, all pepped up to
tell them a long cock-and-bull story about how my
backers and I felt that we couldn't conscientiously
support our side, and wanted to come over to theirs.
I think I may have given you the impression that I
was accepted without question."
"I judged that was the impression you wanted to
give me."
"Well, perhaps; but of course it wasn't completely
true. They had to vote on me first; and it is this
voting which reminded me of the story in this morn
ing's Daily. There wouldn't have been any trouble at
all if it hadn't been for Grackle."
"Grackle?"
"An uncouth individual they had already decided on
before I arrived. After a change of chairman, neces
sitated by the fact that the original chairman was due
at another caucus somewhere else, a vote was taken.
Grackle won on the first ballot."
"The first ballot? Then you took more than one?"
"There was considerable pressure on the chairman."
"I see. But of course the second vote "
"Not at all. The vote was much heavier for Grackle
than before, that time, but just before it was con
cluded, a couple of dark horse delegates strolled in.
After I told them I thought I could swing two class
presidencies their way, the tide began to turn.
"We had a series of impassioned speeches, in
which I heard myself lauded to the skies for a good
appearance and a nice car to take visiting celebrities
around the campus in—scarcely a valid reason for
nomination, but flattering and surprisingly effective.
Ideals were made and broken right and left, and
everybody had a grand time, just short of murder in
a couple of cases. After which we settled down and
took a third ballot."
"And you won."
"I did, but not without a struggle. The only thing
that saved me was that the chairman had—or claimed
he had—proxies for two other prominent pressure
groups. At the last moment he remembered them,
cast them for Bellwether, and the deed was done."
"By two votes?"
"By two votes. The chairman didn't want to do
it, but when he saw how things were going—"
"Bellwether," I said, "I hate to question your
honesty, and I certainly don't question the purity of
Farm politics, but do you think I would be insulting
you too much if I asked you who the chairman
was?"
lie gave me a blase and world-weary look.
"I am above insults," he said coolly. "In this
game, one has to be."

"We had a series of impassioned speeches, in
which I heard myself lauded to the skies for a good
appearance and a nice car to take visiting celebrities
around the campus in—scarcely a valid reason for
nomination, but flattering and surprisingly effective.
Ideals were made and broken right and left, and
everybody had a grand time, just short of murder in
a couple of cases. After which we settled down and
took a third ballot."
"And you won."
"I did, but not without a struggle. The only thing
that saved me was that the chairman had—or claimed
he had—proxies for two other prominent pressure
groups. At the last moment he remembered them,
cast them for Bellwether, and the deed was done."
"By two votes?"
"By two votes. The chairman didn't want to do
it, but when he saw how things were going—"
"Bellwether," I said, "I hate to question your
honesty, and I certainly don't question the purity of
Farm politics, but do you think I would be insulting
you too much if I asked you who the chairman
was?"
lie gave me a blase and world-weary look.
"I am above insults," he said coolly. "In this

I>ELLWETHER stopped by as usual last night with
the latest, looking every inch the campus poli
tician. I was afraid for a moment he was going to
slap me on the back, but he evidently thought better
of it, contenting himself with a piercing stare and what
he probably thought was a vote-getting smile.
"You know," he began, "this business about va
rious people voting various different ways to nominate
various people when they have already nominated
various other people, reminds me very much of one
of those caucuses I was telling you about yesterday,
the one that nominated me."
"I notice your caucuses didn't get your name an
nounced in The Daily," I said.
"A mere detail, a mere detail. I arrived at this
particular caucus, as you remember, all pepped up to
tell them a long cock-and-bull story about how my
backers and I felt that we couldn't conscientiously
support our side, and wanted to come over to theirs.
I think I may have given you the impression that I
was accepted without question."
"I judged that was the impression you wanted to
give me."
"Well, perhaps; but of course it wasn't completely
true. They had to vote on me first; and it is this
voting which reminded me of the story in this morn
ing's Daily. There wouldn't have been any trouble at
all if it hadn't been for Grackle."
"Grackle?"
"An uncouth individual they had already decided on
before I arrived. After a change of chairman, neces
sitated by the fact that the original chairman was due
at another caucus somewhere else, a vote was taken.
Grackle won on the first ballot."
"The first ballot? Then you took more than one?"
"There was considerable pressure on the chairman."
"I see. But of course the second vote "
"Not at all. The vote was much heavier for Grackle
than before, that time, but just before it was con
cluded, a couple of dark horse delegates strolled in.
After I told them I thought I could swing two class
presidencies their way, the tide began to turn.
