1 AST week we mentioned a little number entitled
"The Week-end of a Private Secretary." This
tricky job was written by John Mercer, who was re
sponsible for "Jamboree Jones," and "J. P. Marcum Is
Dead," and is heard on Brunswick 8088. The lyrics,
which are sung by Mildred Bailey, tell the sad story of
the secretary who goes to Cuba on her vacation. We
mention it because it won't be long before everyone
will chant "Darn it all" in the appropriate place.
Duke Ellington is back on the record lists with a
thing called "Scrounch" and "If You Were in My
Place." You won't care much for "Scrounch" but the
Elington crew turns in a good job of it. Incidentally,
the Duke has half and hour on the air each Sunday
night from the Cotton Club; unfortunately, he is aired
the same time as Jack Benny, and you know what
that means.

<> N THE radio nightly is Bob Crosby and his Dixie
land music. Most of you have heard his "Ram
part Street Parade" by now. and the broadcasts are as
equally fine, with such men as Ray Bauduc, drums;
Bob Zurke, piano; Eddie Miller, tenor; and Bob Hag
gart, bass, doing the solo work.
"Ti Pi Tin," Decca 1703, gets more than adequate
treatment by the Andrews Sisters. Personally, we
think that the tune is more than somewhat odorifer
ous, but their rendition makes the disk worth col
lecting. The Andrew Sisters don't quite come up to
the Boswell standard, mainly because they don't have
anyone of Connie Boswell's caliber. However, the
musical arrangements are mighty swell, and all-star
group gives the record good backing.
Two good dance tunes now making the rounds are
"The Perfume Counter on the Rue de la Paix" and
"You Couldn't Be Sweeter." These aren't of the swing
variety, but neither are they in the sweet dish—
swoosh category. You can catch them on several
disks on the Decca, Brunswick, and Victor lists.
Tommy Dorsey hits the bell again with "Jezebel,"
another sweet one. It is coupled wtih "Bewildered,"
with Jack Leonard handling the vocals in his capable
manner.
Merely as a matter of personal opinion, we still be
lieve that a little seven-piece combo out at Topsy's
Roost plays the best dance music in the city. Ellis
Kimball, who played down here last year at a jolly-up,
still has the band and we can't too heartily recommend
dropping in there for a night. The music will make up
for the surroundings

Place." You won't care much for "Scrounch" but the
Elington crew turns in a good job of it. Incidentally,
the Duke has half and hour on the air each Sunday
night from the Cotton Club; unfortunately, he is aired
the same time as Jack Benny, and you know what
that means.

<> N THE radio nightly is Bob Crosby and his Dixie
land music. Most of you have heard his "Ram
part Street Parade" by now. and the broadcasts are as
equally fine, with such men as Ray Bauduc, drums;
Bob Zurke, piano; Eddie Miller, tenor; and Bob Hag
gart, bass, doing the solo work.
"Ti Pi Tin," Decca 1703, gets more than adequate
treatment by the Andrews Sisters. Personally, we
think that the tune is more than somewhat odorifer
ous, but their rendition makes the disk worth col
lecting. The Andrew Sisters don't quite come up to
the Boswell standard, mainly because they don't have
anyone of Connie Boswell's caliber. However, the
musical arrangements are mighty swell, and all-star
group gives the record good backing.
Two good dance tunes now making the rounds are
"The Perfume Counter on the Rue de la Paix" and
"You Couldn't Be Sweeter." These aren't of the swing
variety, but neither are they in the sweet dish—
swoosh category. You can catch them on several
disks on the Decca, Brunswick, and Victor lists.
Tommy Dorsey hits the bell again with "Jezebel,"
another sweet one. It is coupled wtih "Bewildered,"
with Jack Leonard handling the vocals in his capable
manner.
Merely as a matter of personal opinion, we still be
lieve that a little seven-piece combo out at Topsy's
Roost plays the best dance music in the city. Ellis
Kimball, who played down here last year at a jolly-up,
still has the band and we can't too heartily recommend
dropping in there for a night. The music will make up
for the surroundings

1 AST week we mentioned a little number entitled
"The Week-end of a Private Secretary." This
tricky job was written by John Mercer, who was re
sponsible for "Jamboree Jones," and "J. P. Marcum Is
Dead," and is heard on Brunswick 8088. The lyrics,
which are sung by Mildred Bailey, tell the sad story of
the secretary who goes to Cuba on her vacation. We
mention it because it won't be long before everyone
will chant "Darn it all" in the appropriate place.
Duke Ellington is back on the record lists with a
thing called "Scrounch" and "If You Were in My
Place." You won't care much for "Scrounch" but the
Elington crew turns in a good job of it. Incidentally,
the Duke has half and hour on the air each Sunday
night from the Cotton Club; unfortunately, he is aired
the same time as Jack Benny, and you know what
