# Tamara Bad, Fowler Foul, Dance Worse
## 
### 
The team of Fowler and Tamara,
last night's Concert Series dancers,
came a cropper, proving again that
it takes more than four depths of
stage and a printed program to make
art out of a third-rate floor show.
Whatever agility shown by Mr.
Addison Fowler was less a matter
of grace than a question of expe
diency—as if Mr. Fowler had spent
the better part of his career dodging
tables in night clubs or tomatoes on
the RKO circuit.
As far as last night's program is
concerned, Mr. Fowler can be dis
posed of quickly and quietly as the
inept foil of Miss Florenz Tamara's
equally inept exhibition.
In the Valse Triste, Miss Tamara
swathed herself in white drapery,
sank to the floor, chilled and numb,
and stayed there. This was quite a
feat because the floor was doubtless
draughty.
In "A Modern Fantasy," the two
danced indecently to "Night and
Day" and "Temptation." A "Mod
ern Fantasy" was termed "a dra
matic interpretation of the temptress
in aboriginal dance movements to a
syncopated beat." A state of un
dress, the two should be informed, is
not the first requisite of aborigin
ality. But with a little misinterpre
tation, they had the right word for
it.
In "Gavotte," the team suggested
nothing so much as an elegant 1830
couple, as conceived on the labels of
after-shaving lotion.
The A.S.S.U. will do better after
this to reserve their series for art
ists.—Slater.
