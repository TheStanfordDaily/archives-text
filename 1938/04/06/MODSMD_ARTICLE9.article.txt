# Interfraternity Council Adopts New Measures
## Pre-Initiation Limited To Specific Week, 'Open House' Accepted 
### 
Moving toward concentration of I
j both fraternity pre-initiation periods ]
and fall rushing, Interfraternity
Council last night adopted two j
measures designed to eliminate ob- I
jectionable faults of the present sys
tems at a dinner meeting in the
i Alpha Delt house.
The new ruling on pre-initiations
will limit such activity to one speci
fied week ior all houses, will tend
to eliminate off-campus pre-initia
tion activities, and will require a
I verbal report of house presidents to
j the Dean of Men and officers of In
terfraternity Council.
The rushing plan as adopted for
next fall quarter was an approval of
the "open house" plan proposed in
a report by Jay Dirlam.
This week-end affair will be fol
lowed by three fall quarter rushing j
week - ends, one winter quarter
week-end, and Preference Week.
Eliminates 'Backwash'
Designed to eliminate "the 'back
wash' of unpleasant publicity" of
initiations and to curtail destruction
of property and disturbance of the
| peace, fraternities will be required
j to outline pre-initiation plans in the
I required personal interview, accord
ing to the ruling.
This interview, to be participated
in by house presidents, the Dean of
Men, and council officers, is a change
in the original proposal which called
j for a written report.
I Also in line with the new ruling,
I a suggestion will be submitted to
| new officers of Interfraternity Coun
cil who will be chosen at the coun
cil's next meeting by retiring offi
cers, that there be an assembly of
I all initiates to all houses at the be
ginning of the pre-initiation period
to acquaint them with the history
and purposes of fraternities on the
Stanford campus.
Calendar Adopted
Rushing calendar adopted last
night for fall rushing is as follows:

I According to details of the "open
house" ruling, each freshman win
visit all houses to which he is in
vited and will stay at each for a time
not to exceed one hour. This is a
change from the present system, un
der which freshmen visit only one

is designed to give both Row and
Frosh a chance to become more
I broadly acquainted.

ence Week will be run as at present.
In order to inform next year's
j freshmen of details of the plan and

! tary - treasurer, to replace Don

j to outline pre-initiation plans in the
I required personal interview, accord
ing to the ruling.
This interview, to be participated
in by house presidents, the Dean of
Men, and council officers, is a change
in the original proposal which called
j for a written report.
I Also in line with the new ruling,
I a suggestion will be submitted to

night for fall rushing is as follows:

i end, Jan. 6, 7; Preference Week,

I According to details of the "open
house" ruling, each freshman win
visit all houses to which he is in
vited and will stay at each for a time
not to exceed one hour. This is a
change from the present system, un
der which freshmen visit only one
house for an extended period, and
is designed to give both Row and
Frosh a chance to become more
I broadly acquainted.
Follow Present Plan
Following week-ends and Prefer
ence Week will be run as at present.
In order to inform next year's
j freshmen of details of the plan and
j the manner in which they are to
; visit from house to house for a
| preliminary impression of all houses
! to which they are eligible, the coun
cil will hold an Encina smoker dur
i ing the first two weeks of the quar
j ter.
At the next meeting of the coun-
I cil, election of president and secre
! tary - treasurer, to replace Don
Moulton and Bud Milligan, will be
j held.
Moving toward concentration of I
j both fraternity pre-initiation periods ]
and fall rushing, Interfraternity
Council last night adopted two j
measures designed to eliminate ob- I
jectionable faults of the present sys
tems at a dinner meeting in the
i Alpha Delt house.
The new ruling on pre-initiations
will limit such activity to one speci
fied week ior all houses, will tend
to eliminate off-campus pre-initia
tion activities, and will require a
I verbal report of house presidents to
j the Dean of Men and officers of In
terfraternity Council.
The rushing plan as adopted for
next fall quarter was an approval of
the "open house" plan proposed in
a report by Jay Dirlam.
This week-end affair will be fol
lowed by three fall quarter rushing j
week - ends, one winter quarter
week-end, and Preference Week.
Eliminates 'Backwash'
Designed to eliminate "the 'back
wash' of unpleasant publicity" of
