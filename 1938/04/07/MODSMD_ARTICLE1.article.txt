### BILL MILLIS 
r years ago Amer
ica capitulated to the not-yet
dead ideal of fighting for democracy,
entered the World War on the side
of the Allied powers.
Yesterday the United States Sen
ate observed the anniversary of that
day by a voice-vote approval of the
$491,225,313 regular army appro
priation bill, bringing the Roosevelt
Administration's total preparedness
expenditures for 1939 to nearly
$2,000,000,000.
The army bill provided for an
appropriation $75,000,000 more
than was granted for the current
fiscal year, and allowed particu
larly for further expansion of
army aviation and sea-coast and
anti-aircraft defense.
* *
Chairman David I. Walsh of the
Senate Naval Affairs Commtitee is
speeding preparations to bring the
$1,121,000,000 navy "expansion"
bill before the Senate in the imme
diate future.
Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary
of War Louis Johnson, in an Army
Day radio address, warned last
night that both North and South
America are endangered by what he
termed the "covetous hands" of na
tions "which believe in the doctrine
of force."
Fearing "piratical designs" that
would violate the Monroe Doc
trine, Johnson asserted that a
vital preparedness measure need
ed at once is the enactment of a
selective service (draft) law.

J AST WEEK Spain's Loyalist army
' withdrew from its general head
quarters at Lerida, and yesterday it
had to fall back again, when the
Insurgent army on the central Cali
fornia front captured Blauguer, tem
porary Republican staff headquar
ters 72 miles west of Barcelona, in
a drive to seize five vital electric
power plants and bring paralysis to
Catalonia's war industries.
The government is rushing
heavy reinforcements to Trernp, in
northern Catalonia and the loca
tion of the most important utility
plants, and elsewhere is forming
new defense lines little more than
60 miles from Barcelona.
Insurgents have delayed their
final entry into Tortosa, Mediter
ranean seaport on the Ebro River
delta, until the right wing of the
Rebel army completes its advance
upon Vinaroz, a coastal town 25
miles south.

pRENCH PREMIER Leon Blum
retained a wavering hold upon
the government yesterday, after the
Chamber of Deputies passed, with a
narrow majority of 311 to 250, the
cabinet's emergency finance bills,
which provide for revalorization of
Bank of France gold reserves, cen
tralized control of foreign exchange
trading, and a heavy capital levy as
an alternative to inflation.
But the measures now go to the
more conservative Senate, where
they seem certain to be defeated,
bringing the downfall of the three
week-old Blum cabinet.
During yesterday's debate, Right
ist ex-Premier Pierre-Etienne Flan
din denounced the bills as contain
ing the "dangers of American credit
inflation" and pointing "toward a
totalitarian economic and political
regime."

Summary: Administration action
at this session of Congress for en
actment of wages and hours legisla
tion appears certain, with a House
labor subcommittee yesterday
breaking a three-month deadlock
and approving a compromise bill—
Violation of the Wagner Act was
charged by the National Labor Re
lations Board against the Chicago
Inland Steel Co., for announcing in
advance of last summer's "Little
Steel" strike that it would not sign
a contract with the C.1.0.
The House agreed to limit debate
on the reorganization bill to three
hours. Wintry blizzards swept
the Middle West. .

pRENCH PREMIER Leon Blum
retained a wavering hold upon
the government yesterday, after the
Chamber of Deputies passed, with a
narrow majority of 311 to 250, the
cabinet's emergency finance bills,
which provide for revalorization of
Bank of France gold reserves, cen
tralized control of foreign exchange
trading, and a heavy capital levy as
an alternative to inflation.
But the measures now go to the
more conservative Senate, where
they seem certain to be defeated,
bringing the downfall of the three
week-old Blum cabinet.
During yesterday's debate, Right
ist ex-Premier Pierre-Etienne Flan

ing the "dangers of American credit
inflation" and pointing "toward a
totalitarian economic and political
regime."

Administration's total preparedness
expenditures for 1939 to nearly
$2,000,000,000.
The army bill provided for an
