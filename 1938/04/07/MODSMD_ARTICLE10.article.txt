This was done at the suggestion of
the report made by last year's com
mittee.
This year's theme, "Trot With the
Tots," will l'eplace last year's time
ly "Coronation." Since the also-tra

banned last year because students
were injured and property destroy
ed, the "Kid" theme is being used
for the ball in an effort to kill two
birds with one stone.
Bids Priced at $2.56
Price of the bids was set at $2.56.
This means that, after expenses are
cleared, every bid sold will support
one child for one day at the home.
Last King and Queen of the
Masque Ball were Hal Kahn and

ticket last April. In the future,
democratic forms will prevail.

Rasmussen, decorations; Andy
Shirey, police; Louise McChrystal,

posters; and Harry Press, publicity.
