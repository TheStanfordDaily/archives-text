# Dance To Feature 'Ox Road' Theme
## 
### 
Four army mules will make the
"old ox road" a reality tomorrow
evening when Sequoia Hall holds its
annual barn dance. Fresh from the
pastures, the mules will journey
through the countryside in the
Farm's best hay wagon between
groups of dance numbers played by
AI Sebring and his orchestra.
Attendance will be limited to 150
couples. Bids, which are now on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office, may be
purchased at the door, provided the
sale limit is not previously reached.
A chute, installed at the entrance,
is the latest innovation in the deco
ration theme, according to Dance
Chairman Earle Fidanque.
