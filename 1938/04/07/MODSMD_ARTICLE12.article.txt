# Hit Plays Reviewed By Beatrice Edmonds
## 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
Beatrice Edmonds played Susan
and the supporting cast of "Susan
and God" convincingly when she
reviewed it among other plays in the
Memorial Theater yesterday after
i noon.
As the character Mike, Miss Ed
monds says, "Susan doesn't change
her mind. She changes her emo
tions." Rachael Crothers' current
success owes its long run to Ger
trude Lawrence in a large degree,
according to the reviewer. The fact
that it i.s a satire on such religious
groups as the Oxford movement and
yet contains no irreverence is also
largely responsible, she explained.
By reading excerpts from the play,
Miss Edmunds, who is a Stanford
j graduate, carried her audience
! through the various situations which
1 Susan Trexall finds, creates, and
' either remedies or ruins.
The Mercury Theater in New York

was described, and its two successes:
"Shoemaker's Holiday" and "Juliu*
Caesar," which has had its longest
run although it i.s being "scrapped
of all acting tradition" and done in
modern dress with no scenery.
"Death is a hit in New York" said
Miss Edmunds, and she went on to
review "On Borrowed Time" and
Thornton Wilder's "Our Town."
"Amphytrion 38," "Of Mice and
Men," "Star Wagon," "Sea Gull,"
"Father Malachy's Miracle," and
"Shadow and Substance" are the
other plays which in Miss Edmunds
estimation kept the season from the
mediocrity which was nearly caused
by the closing and abandoning ol
plays due to the "Roosevelt reces-
I sion."
Cap and Gown presented Miss Ed
munds and the proceeds for her ap
pearance will go to their scholarship
fund which takes care <>l one wom
an's tuition each yr>ar.
