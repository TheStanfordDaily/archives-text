# Sororities Lead Senior Fund Drive
## Theta, Alpha Phi, Theta Delt Houses Head Contributors 
### 
With two sororities already hav
ing contributed 100 per cent, the
women's living groups are leading
in the Senior Fund Drive. Theta
and Alpha Phi are the two high
groups, followed closely by Kappa,
90 per cent; Mariposa, 57 per cent;
and Elm, 33 1-3 per cent.
A check was made on the progress
of the drive by Co-chairmen George
Ditz and Rebecca Butts through the
agents in each living group, and the
Row was shown to be contributing
more than the Halls.
Ditz Optimistic
Only one fraternity, Theta Delt,
has contributed 100 per cent so far.
Others are in order Theta Xi, 40 per
cent; Theta Chi, 37V2 per cent;
A.T.0., 27.2 per cent; and D.U., 25
per cent.
Ditz said that he believed the
seniors would still contribute to the
drive and that he expected the class
of '38 would far surpass the mark
set by last year's class when 42 per
cent of the seniors contributed.
Killefer Seeks Support
The Fund Drve, to which all sen
iors are asked to contribute, proved
valuable last year, the first time the
drive was held. Contributions re
ceived from the seniors and alumni
will go to the Stanford Endowment
Fund.
President Tom Killefer asked that
the .seniors support the drive, as their
contributions are needed to keep
Stanford a leading university.
Agents have been appointed in all
fraternity and sorority houses, eat
ing clubs, dormitories, and also an
off-campus representative. In addi
tion 30,000 alumni have been asked
to aid in the drive.
