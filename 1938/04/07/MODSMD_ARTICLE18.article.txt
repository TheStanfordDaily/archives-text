Menuhin, who is now touring Eu
rope, playing in England, Holland.!
France, Belgium, Switzerland, and'
Italy, appeared here on the Concert '
Series in 1932 and 1933. He has been i
signed for next season by the San ]
Francisco Symphony, as well as the
New York Philharmonic, and Boston
symphony and orchestras of Europe's I
capitals.
Menuhin, long noted as a child j
prodigy, is now 21, and since his
return to recitals has often been [
accompanied by his sister, who is a ;
concert pianist.
Last year he succeeded in getting
permission to play Schumann's Con
certo, which was not to be released
for some years, and he first played
it in St. Louis last fall, nfter much
delay and opposition from Hitler as
well as various musical authorities.
Virginia Smith, Concert Se
ries manager, yesterday expressed;
her appreciation for the co-opera- '
tion of the audience at the last
concert in helping to choose con- 1
cert artists for next year. She added
that even though Charlie McCarthy
and Suzy Q did not poll a majority,
the series appreciates knowing the
public sentiment on the entertain
ments.
