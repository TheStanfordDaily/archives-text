# Cleaners Admit Clothes 'Theft'
## 
### 
A laundry driver found no one
home ;it 536 Alvarado Row, so he
left the clergyman's vestments
hanging on the door. But the ncxl
day they were missing. The police
were notified.
Yesterday another cleaning agency
reported that they had removed the
clothes, thinking they had been left
out to be picked up by their driver
and needed cleaning. A difference
of opinion on what is a good cleaning
job!
