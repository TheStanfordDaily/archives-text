## New Grade Figures Show Halls Hold Lead Over Row 
### 
Women at Stanford lead men in
scholarship, and Hall students are
slightly higher than Row men and
women, grade point ratio figures for
1936-37 show in the annual report of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur to the
Board of Trustees.
An average number of 977 wom
en for three quarters had an aver
age of 2.63, a rise from 2.57 for the
year before; while 1,949 men low
ered their average from 2.44 to 2.41,
a summary of figures prepared by
the Committee on Scholarship
shows.
Phi Beta Kappa, honorary schol
astic organization, led group ratios
with 3.44, and was followed by Tau
Beta Pi, honorary engineering so
ciety, 3.24; Cap and Gown, wom
en's honorary, 3.19; and women's
Hall sponsors, 3.12.
Hall women maintained 2.64 and
non-fraternity men, 2.46. Row
women had a ratio of 2.61 and men,
2.33.
Leading the list of fraternities is
Alpha Tau Omega at 2.60, while
Delta Gamma leads sororities with
2.74.
Conclusions of the Scholarship
Committee on reinstatement of
suspended lower division students
x'eveals that during the past year it
has been necessary to impose more
stringent regulations.
New Rulings
The first of two rulings on this
subject is that automatic reinstate
ment is a "mistake" and under the
new system, "students must place
themselves under the supervision of
a faculty adviser." 4
Secondly, liberality of grade-point
bonuses allowed reinstated students
has been restricted because of "un
due leniency." The new rule places
allowance at sufficient amount to
place the student within probation
limits and in such a position that
"he must make a C average in the
quarter in which he is reinstated,
and a slightly better average during
the succeeding quarters."
Figures on reinstated students
show that of 230 students, 100, or 43
per cent, "have made some prog
ress" and 130, or 57 per cent, "are
either worse off than before or
have stood still."

Women at Stanford lead men in
scholarship, and Hall students are
slightly higher than Row men and
women, grade point ratio figures for
1936-37 show in the annual report of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur to the
Board of Trustees.
An average number of 977 wom
en for three quarters had an aver
age of 2.63, a rise from 2.57 for the
year before; while 1,949 men low
ered their average from 2.44 to 2.41,
a summary of figures prepared by
the Committee on Scholarship
shows.
Phi Beta Kappa, honorary schol
astic organization, led group ratios
with 3.44, and was followed by Tau
Beta Pi, honorary engineering so
ciety, 3.24; Cap and Gown, wom
en's honorary, 3.19; and women's
Hall sponsors, 3.12.
Hall women maintained 2.64 and
non-fraternity men, 2.46. Row
women had a ratio of 2.61 and men,
2.33.
Leading the list of fraternities is
Alpha Tau Omega at 2.60, while
Delta Gamma leads sororities with
2.74.
Conclusions of the Scholarship
Committee on reinstatement of
suspended lower division students
x'eveals that during the past year it
has been necessary to impose more
stringent regulations.
New Rulings
The first of two rulings on this
subject is that automatic reinstate
ment is a "mistake" and under the
new system, "students must place
themselves under the supervision of
a faculty adviser." 4
Secondly, liberality of grade-point
bonuses allowed reinstated students
has been restricted because of "un
due leniency." The new rule places
allowance at sufficient amount to
place the student within probation
limits and in such a position that
"he must make a C average in the
quarter in which he is reinstated,
and a slightly better average during
the succeeding quarters."
Figures on reinstated students
show that of 230 students, 100, or 43
per cent, "have made some prog
ress" and 130, or 57 per cent, "are
either worse off than before or
have stood still."
