# Stanford Grad Scales Yosemite Ice-Cone
## 
### 
When Bill Hewlett, from Stanford
and two of his friends, Raffi Beda
yan and Jack Rieglehuth, climbed
Yosemite's famed ice-cone last
Sunday, it was the first time it had

been climbed by amateur climbers.
John Muir, famous California pio
neer, first climbed the cone which is
formed every winter. According to
Hewlett, it is climbed every year
by rangers, but he said, "I don't
think it has ever been climbed be- j
fore by anyone but Muir and the j
rangers."
Centennial Climb
Hewlett and his friends, who are i
from San Francisco, scaled the 300-
foot peak on the centennial anni
versary of Muir's climbing it.
It took them about half an hour
to climb the zone.
"We were soaking wet when we
got there," Hewlett said. We were '
climbing right next to the falls, and j
a couple of times the wind stopped
blowing the spray from the falls j
away from us, and we got soaked to j
the bone in a minute.
Spray Brings Laughs
"When that would happen, we j
would dig in with our ice axes and
hold onto the ice until the spray |
would be blown away again. We !
would be laughing so hard that we I
thought we would fall off."
Hewlett and his friends have had
considerable experience in moun
tain climbing. Hewlett spent part of
last year climbing in Alaska, while
| Bedayan and Riegelhuth were scal
j ing British Columbia's peaks.
Hewlett, graduated from Stanford
iin 1934. He is now doing independ
! ent research work in electrical en
gineering on the Farm.
