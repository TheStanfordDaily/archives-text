Business sentiment in the East is

"There was a general feeling in
! the East that the present recession
would continue throughout most of
the year even if the government did
i a lot of spending, and much longer
'if the government withheld. The
! general feeling was that the major
| cause was the complete collapse of
I confidence, resulting largely from
j the government attitude on labor
j and tax matters."
