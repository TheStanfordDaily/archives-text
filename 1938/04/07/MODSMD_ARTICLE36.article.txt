# Frosh Crush Menlo J.C. Swimmers
## Vitousek, Weeden Set National, Coast Records in Meet 
### 
The Stanford freshman swimming
team decided to have a warm-up
meet with Menlo' J.C. yesterday af
ternoon before the Little Big Swim
Saturday and Biil Weeden and Roy
Vitousek loafed into two more coast
and national records. Incidentally,
the freshmen won 04-10.
Weeden gave Mason Letteau of
the varsity a five-second start in
addition to racing the junior col
lege men. He breezed in with a new
coast record of 1:41.4, which bet
tered the old mark of Parks of
U.S.C. by a tenth of a second.
Vitousek splashed his way through
a :24.(> 50-yard free-style mark to
tie his own new national freshman
intercollegiate mark.
Fremlin Wins Diving
Ray Fremlin and Herb Woolley,
varsity divers, entered the spring
board competition with the frosh
and Menloites to decide the second
man lor the Cal meet Saturday af
ternoon. Fremlin won by a twist
and will team with Coast Champ Roy
Winkleman in the Bear confab.
Coach Nort Thornton announced
yesterday afternoon that both the
lrosh and varsity meets in Encina
Pools would be held up until 3:30
o'clock so that Spectators can take
in both the U.C.L.A. track meet and
the Big Swim. The order of events
for the water competition will be
the running of alternate varsity and
frosh races.
Fro. 1 h Undefeated
The freshmen are thus far unde
feated by any school team and are
favored to whip the Bearcubs de
spite the loss of Chuck Wiper,
promising in middle distance free
style races, who is ineligible. Much
of the load will fall on Co-captains
Weeden and Vitousek, as well as on
several other coming youngsters.
The possibilities of a varsity vic
tory still appear to hinge on the
ability of every man to do better
than he has all season. If Mason
Letteau and Hal Weatherbe swim
close to 1:46.0 in the back stroke and
if Stanford wins the medley relay,
the meet still probably will be won
in the final event, the free-style re
lay.
Thornton intends to swim Vibert,
Clarke, Brahtz, and possibly Win
Needham or Bill Tench in an ef
fort to win this do-or-die race. If
Needham swims both the 220 and the
440, he will give way to Tench, a
better than average century man.

meet with Menlo' J.C. yesterday af
ternoon before the Little Big Swim
Saturday and Biil Weeden and Roy
Vitousek loafed into two more coast
and national records. Incidentally,
the freshmen won 04-10.
Weeden gave Mason Letteau of
the varsity a five-second start in
addition to racing the junior col
lege men. He breezed in with a new
coast record of 1:41.4, which bet
tered the old mark of Parks of
U.S.C. by a tenth of a second.
Vitousek splashed his way through
a :24.(> 50-yard free-style mark to
tie his own new national freshman
intercollegiate mark.
Fremlin Wins Diving
Ray Fremlin and Herb Woolley,
varsity divers, entered the spring
board competition with the frosh
and Menloites to decide the second
man lor the Cal meet Saturday af

Coach Nort Thornton announced
yesterday afternoon that both the
lrosh and varsity meets in Encina
Pools would be held up until 3:30

in both the U.C.L.A. track meet and
the Big Swim. The order of events
for the water competition will be
the running of alternate varsity and
frosh races.
Fro. 1 h Undefeated
The freshmen are thus far unde
feated by any school team and are
favored to whip the Bearcubs de
spite the loss of Chuck Wiper,
promising in middle distance free
style races, who is ineligible. Much
of the load will fall on Co-captains
Weeden and Vitousek, as well as on
several other coming youngsters.
The possibilities of a varsity vic
tory still appear to hinge on the
ability of every man to do better
than he has all season. If Mason
Letteau and Hal Weatherbe swim
close to 1:46.0 in the back stroke and
if Stanford wins the medley relay,
the meet still probably will be won
in the final event, the free-style re
lay.
Thornton intends to swim Vibert,
Clarke, Brahtz, and possibly Win
Needham or Bill Tench in an ef
fort to win this do-or-die race. If
Needham swims both the 220 and the
440, he will give way to Tench, a
better than average century man.
