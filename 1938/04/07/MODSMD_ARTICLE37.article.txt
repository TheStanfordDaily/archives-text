i disconcerting to Glenn
k Hamilton, varsity pitcher, should
| be the fact that Changala of Santa
Clara, who hit the second home run
1 ever knocked over the sunken dia
mond fence Tuesday, had not had a
[ hit in conference play this season
! until that game.
The Bronco had batted 13 times
prior to that game, and had a large
goose egg on the hit side of the
ledger. Ah, well, there's always a
first time. Only he didn't have to
hit it over the fence.
It's no secret that there is some
thing amiss with that baseball team.
When you take it to pieces the team
looks pretty good—it should have
put up more of a battle in some of
these games than it has, but if it
isn't one thing it's another.
The hitting is nothing to brag
about, since thei'e are just two men
batting over 300 in conference play.
Jim Coffis, the skittery kid who
makes an error now and then but
more than makes up for it with his
batting and his base-running, is the
best hitter on the outfit. Norm
Juney, strong, steady sophomore, is
second best.
Coffis has another year of base
ball competition if he wants to come
back to school, but he probably
won't. Juney is going to be a per
plexing problem to the rest of the
coaches in the C.1.8.A. for the next
two years, or a lot of persons are
going to miss their guesses.
jVELSON CULLENWARD, former
sports editor of the Southern
California Daily Trojan and now a
reporter for the San Francisco Call-
Bulletin, can't see why Earl Vick
ery of U.S.C. isn't getting more of a
build-up.
Vickery, a low hurdler with flam
ing red hair, hasn't lost a 220 ob
stacle race since he has been a Tro
jan varsity man, according to Cul
lenward. As such he has plenty of
color, but who hears about him?
George Anderson of California gets
all the play these days, and Vickery
defeated him. Last year it was Jack
Weiershauser of Stanford, who was
out in front against U.S.C. until he
fell and let Vickery win.
Maybe Cullenward has something
there—although there still is some
doubt whether the redhead is unde
feated in varsity competition.

C.L.A. hasn't a quartermiler
who can hope to press Captain
Ray Malott to a world record in the
440 Saturday, so if the Flyer does it
he will have to do it alone. The
Bruins' best bet is a lad who has
done only :50.3, which isn't enough J
to force Ray into a good sweat.
However, don't let that keep you
away from the meet. Malott is near
ly ready to set a new mark, and this
might be just the day that he will
do it. If the sun continues to shine
until Saturday afternoon, and there
isn't too much wind, he might get
down close to :46 flat. Angell Field
boasts one of the fastest tracks in
the world, and Ray knows how to
run it, so he has things in his favor.
Something else worth watching
Saturday will be Woodrow Wilson
Strode, U.C.L.A.'s colored flash who
is allegedly the best shot-putter in
the Coast Conference this year. If
Tom Montgomery has one of'his bet
ter days he might hand the Bruin a
surprise. At any rate, it should be
a good duel.
