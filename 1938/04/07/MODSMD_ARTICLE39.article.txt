# First Scrimmage Set for Today
## 
### 
First scrimmage of the current
spring football season has been
promised by Coach Tiny Thornhill
for some time this afternoon on the
Grey's Field.
For two weeks, Tiny and his de
pleted staff have been drilling the
three-score recruits on the most
elemental fundamentals. Early in
the week he intimated that all the
lesser lights of the outfit would be
given ample opportunity to give it
and to take it in the initial personal
contact drill.
The coaches have been insistent
in their declaration that the 1938
model Big Red Machine will be
built around speed and deception.
All the backfield aspirants are be
ing injected with liberal portions of
reverses, laterals, laterals from for
wards, and all the other elements j
that go into a clever, deceptive style j
of play.
The linemen thus far have con
tented themselves with dummy
scrimmage and the like, but today
will probably be their chance to get
in a few licks of their own.
DEL MONTE, April 6 (UP).—Play I
will be resumed here today in the |
annual Del Monte 10 - goal polo j
championships. Yesterday the San j
Mateo "A" team defeated Salinas. I
8 to 7, and the San Mateo "B'' team i
won from the Midwicks, 9 to 6. Fi- :
nals will be played this week-end. !
