# Card Track Team to Meet Bruin Squad
## 'Sepia Sensations' To Shine for Bruins In Saturday Meet 
### 
Led by aÂ«lassy contingent o? ne
| gro athletes, U.C.L.A.'s cinderpath
j team invades Angell Field Saturday
jto match times, distances, and
| heights with Stanford's paleface
J Indians.
As a team the Bruins don't figure
to give Coach Dink Templeton's
men much competition, but the
Uclans boast of a handful of bril
liant performers who should make
things interesting in some events
come Saturday.
Negro Athletes
Among the sepia sensations Coach
Harry Trotter will present are
j Woodrow Wilson Strode, Tom Ber
i keley, Bill Lacefield, and Tom Brad
j ley. This quartet, along with Clark
I Shaughnessy and Captain Paul Van
| Alstine, may account for as many
I as eight first places out of 15 events.
Strode has tossed the shot over 51
j feet innumerable times, and has a
j best record in the discuss of 101 feet,
| 10 inches.
Berkeley looms a heavy favorite
in the low hurdles, and also has a
chance in the 100, an event to which
he has recently been switched from
i the high hurdles.
Farm Hurdlers
Lacefield is a cinch in the broad
I jump and should give Dick Simpson
| and Bill Hawkins of the Farm a bat
j tie in the high hurdles. Lacefield has
i leaped upwards of 24 feet several
times already this season.
Clark Shaughnessy, Jr., son of the
University of Chicago football coach,
has been consistent at 200 feet in
the javelin and should win the
event.
Other Bruin potentialities are
John Blaikie, 6-foot, 1-inch high
jumper; Norman Miller, a 13-foot
, pole vaulter who isn't in the best
l of shape at present; Keith France
I and Pat Turner, 23-foot broad-
I jumpers; and Wendell Catlin, a 145-
foot discus thrower.

All of the millions of fingerprints,
j no two of which have been found
to be alike, come under three prin
; cipal classifications: arch, loop, and
i whorl.

The New York City Principals'
Association has passed a resolution
asking that chapters of the American
Student Union be barred from the
city's schools.
