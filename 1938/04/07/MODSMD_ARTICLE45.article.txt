# It's Colossal

THINGS are getting bad! It's Thursday, two
whole days alter nominations opened, and
only a paltry six candidates have had their
names placed on the ballot for A.S.S.U. presi
dent. An election should be a field day for the
exponents of student government who declare
that the secret lies in mass participation; but it
looks as if the proletariat isn't going to have fun
this election wading through a ballot which
resembles a registration booklet.
Where's the Delta Sigma Rho candidate?
Why hasn't the Walrus Club dusted off a saddle
to put on a dark horse? What's the A.S.U. wait
ing for? Come, come, gentlemen, the situation
is rapidly becoming rank. Is there no interest
among you, no desire to make student govern
ment fulfill its purpose?
Or is it possible that the Row and Hall are
remaining true to caucus pledges to stand to
gether, and feel that they cannot, on their gen
tlemen's honor, break the united front? Why
should the moguls stop with only six? Let's give
everybody a chance and print the bawlout for
the ballot—it won't be much more confusing
than the ticket we'll have to paw through any
how.
And why haven't the women gotten into the
spirit of the thing? Don't they realize that they
are prevented from running for A.S.S.U. presi
dent by a constitutional ruling? Now is the
time for all good suffragettes to strike for their
tights and put a rider on the ballot which will
enable them to get into the money next year.
Besides, a few pretty women would add a real
.■:est to the grim political struggle.
Let's not be cheap about the election. Why
not declare an all-University holiday next Tues
day? The candidates may run games, such as
button, button, who's got a vote for me? and
other instructive and healthful recreations. The
day will culminate with dancing on the green,
followed by the grand sweepstakes. Each can
didate's name will be put in the hopper, and
the lucky winner drawn forth by a blindfolded
Convalescent Home kiddie.
A torch-light procession will lead the baccha
nalian revelers down the Row to the A.S.S.U.
building, where the newly elected president
will distribute gold-edged certificates, entitling
the bearer to one gravy-bowl, complete with
contents.—J. S.
