# Looking 20 Million Ahead
## 
### 
WHEN The Daily announced recently that
President Ray Lyman Wilbur wanted about
20 million dollars for Stanford, most of the
drowsy readers decided that the story had got
ten mixed up with one about Roosevelt. Those
who didn't wondered why the well-known wolf
hadn't been seen roaming the Ad Building
steps.
A guick expedition into the President's Re
port reveals that Stanford does need 20 million,
but we won't be thrown out into El Camino if
we don't have it by the end of the month. That
20 million is the Farm's day dream. It is the
statistical eguivalent of the map that hangs in
the Cellar—the map that shows the future law
school and science guad and dormitories. That
sum is the price of improvements we hope to
make some day.
Even a university can dream. And the stu
dents can have no objection. There is no sylla
bus fee for dreaming.—J. C.
