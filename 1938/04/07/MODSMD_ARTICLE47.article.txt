# Fun in the Scrum
## 
### 
MAYBE it's because the politicians are strew
ing dirty linen about like drunken laun
drymen; or perhaps we have been drinking
coffee that is out of date; anyhow we haven't
been able to find much sunshine and gladness
recently.
But yesterday we ran into some information
about the rugby squad that should provide a
nice bracer for hearts bowed down under an
electoral hangover. It is encouraging to see one
organized group that has minded its own busi

ness, and has carried on its activities without
demanding itemized payment.
It seems that the rugby squad consists of 65
varsity and 20 frosh. It has declined minor sport
recognition, and plays purely for the fun of
the game. The coaches contribute their serv
ices voluntarily; the players go through the
season's work without demanding a red sweater
as a bribe.
And the team haa turned in a record that the
major sport coaches are keeping under their
pillows to dream on. In the past six years it
has lost only four games.
No one has ever accused rugby of being a
quiet game of holding hands. It is hard and
fast. Night after night last season the players
limped home looking as though they had flirted
with a prize-fighter's wife.
In these days when rumor keeps arising that
the income tax investigators are going to crack
down on football men, it is encouraging to find
a sport where men play just for the fun of it.â€”
