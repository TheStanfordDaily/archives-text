# BULL SESSION
## BELLWETHER, MARCHING ON 
### 
BELLWETHER, the Sage of Stanford, has
certainly made no secret of his firm determina
tion to wrest the presidency of the Associate Students
from whoever decides to run against him; but so far
he has said very little about his platform. I reminded
him of this yesterday, and was not surprised to hear
he had given it some thought—not very much, but
some.
"Window-dressing is always necessary," he said,
"so I think I'll begin by once more advocating the 9
o'clock starting-hour."
"But "
"Yes, I know it didn't take before. But it may
now. Times change. That'll get me all the lovers of
the more abundant life who object to getting out of
bed at 8 o'clock. Next, I think I should do every
thing in my power to get some of these cow-paths
around here widened so that decent, peace-loving
people could drive along them without too much
trouble."
"You couldn't do much about that."
"No, I know. Merely intimate to the Administra
tion that the students would appreciate it, if it could
be arranged. Then I think I would arrange to have
Ex Committee meetings held in the Little Theater.
Nobody attends now, but just think what you could
do with a little advertising campaign. Big pre-pub
licity stories in The Daily before every meeting—get
in the competition angle. Intimate that the members
secretly hate each other like cats and dogs "
"Well "
"Quiet —that any meeting now somebody is going to
knock somebody else down—encourage heckling from
the floor, urge people to bring dates—because after
all, it is a theater, and I would certainly guarantee a
good show "
"Bellwether," I said, "I have a feeling you're talk
ing through your hat about this."
"I don't know why. Direct democracy, you know.
We operate on a small enough scale so that we can
have it if we want it. It only lacks the porper build
up."
"And what about the Administration?"
"Co-operation, but not submission. No power be
hind the Bellwether throne, I can assure you. Spe
cifically, I think, the establishment of some sort of
joint council to handle publicity for the University.
Stanford makes very little use of her facilities or her
talent in this field. We need a good and intensive
publicity campaign if these appeals for money are
going to get anywhere.
"Also, more activity along the line of student
faculty relations, a field which I think has hardly
been touched."
"Well," I said, "those strike me as fairly good
ideas. Except that there aren't vei'y many of them."
"I haven't given the matter very much thought yet.
I dare say they'll develop. Keep posted, and let me
know if you hear about any more people running. A
few more dark-horse candidates, and I'm a cinch."
And he walked off toward the Row, probably
bound for another of its innumerable caucuses.

Stanford makes very little use of her facilities or her
talent in this field. We need a good and intensive
publicity campaign if these appeals for money are
going to get anywhere.
"Also, more activity along the line of student
faculty relations, a field which I think has hardly
been touched."
"Well," I said, "those strike me as fairly good
ideas. Except that there aren't vei'y many of them."
"I haven't given the matter very much thought yet.
I dare say they'll develop. Keep posted, and let me
know if you hear about any more people running. A
few more dark-horse candidates, and I'm a cinch."

bound for another of its innumerable caucuses.

BELLWETHER, the Sage of Stanford, has
certainly made no secret of his firm determina
tion to wrest the presidency of the Associate Students
from whoever decides to run against him; but so far
he has said very little about his platform. I reminded
him of this yesterday, and was not surprised to hear
he had given it some thought—not very much, but
some.
"Window-dressing is always necessary," he said,
"so I think I'll begin by once more advocating the 9
o'clock starting-hour."
"But "
"Yes, I know it didn't take before. But it may
now. Times change. That'll get me all the lovers of
the more abundant life who object to getting out of
bed at 8 o'clock. Next, I think I should do every
thing in my power to get some of these cow-paths
around here widened so that decent, peace-loving
people could drive along them without too much
trouble."
"You couldn't do much about that."
"No, I know. Merely intimate to the Administra
tion that the students would appreciate it, if it could
be arranged. Then I think I would arrange to have
Ex Committee meetings held in the Little Theater.
Nobody attends now, but just think what you could
do with a little advertising campaign. Big pre-pub
licity stories in The Daily before every meeting—get
in the competition angle. Intimate that the members
secretly hate each other like cats and dogs "
"Well "
"Quiet —that any meeting now somebody is going to
knock somebody else down—encourage heckling from
the floor, urge people to bring dates—because after
all, it is a theater, and I would certainly guarantee a
good show "
"Bellwether," I said, "I have a feeling you're talk
ing through your hat about this."
"I don't know why. Direct democracy, you know.
We operate on a small enough scale so that we can
have it if we want it. It only lacks the porper build
up."
"And what about the Administration?"
"Co-operation, but not submission. No power be
hind the Bellwether throne, I can assure you. Spe
cifically, I think, the establishment of some sort of
joint council to handle publicity for the University.
Stanford makes very little use of her facilities or her
talent in this field. We need a good and intensive
publicity campaign if these appeals for money are
