d of the toughest games to break into is song
writing—professionally, that is. If you haven't a
friend in A.S.C.A.P., or pull somewhere along the line,
you might as well go back to campus politics or hit
ting the books. However, things are looking up, clue
to the influence of such college shows as that of the
Princeton Triangle Club. In fact, a recent article I
was reading tells me that Tin Pan Alley is gradually
waking up to the fact that good music is being turned
out by the collegiate crew.
According to the article, it was Brooks Bowman
with "East of the Sun" and "Love on a Dime" that
ushered in the new era. Hitherto, college shows had
been content to publish the music in souvenir folios
to be sold in the lobby. However, it is our suspicion
that the publishing gentlemen are passing the buck a
little. We have never seen a college song-writer yet
who didn't move Heaven and earth—within his small
powers—to get his music on the market.

It"? anyhow, after the Bowman successes opened
the market, most of the eastern collegiate shows
had a look-in when it comes to getting their music
published. In fact, good or bad, they are getting a
definite break. Since "East of the Sun," nothing as
good has come out, but one might mention "An Apple
a Day" and "Gypsy in My Soul" as better than aver
age tunes.
However, the West Coast doesn't seem to have
gotten on the band wagon as yet. Perhaps we're too
far from the publishers, or perhaps they (the pub
lishers) have still to wake up to the fact that there
are any colleges west of Chicago.
Our own Gaieties takes perhaps the worst beating
from this neglect—though we may be a bit preju
diced. The long reign of Mac Gordon as top-notch
tune writer brought forth more than one song which
could easily have been a winner. Remember his "Wind
and the Rain"?
And this year's show had music in it which was
uniformly above average. Maybe we're wrong, but
two or three like Hoke Robert's "The Things You'll
Do For Love" wouldn't sound too had cm any Hit
Parade. Stone.
