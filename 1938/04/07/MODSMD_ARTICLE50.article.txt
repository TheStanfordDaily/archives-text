# Hervey Allen Pens Answer To Mitchell

### 
"Action at Aquila" by Hervey Allen.
Farrar & Rinehart, publishers.
In "Action at Aquila" Hervey Al
len writes the North's reply to "Gone
With the Wind." While Margaret
Mitchell painted the Civil War from
a southerner's point of view, Hervey
Allen pictures the conflict with
northern eyes. It's pretty safe to
say that "Action at Aquila" will
never seriously rival Mrs. Mitchell's
vast panorama, nor does it come
near touching Allen's minor master
piece, "Anthony Adverse." But
"Action at Aquila" is a good book.
As its title implies, it's full of ac
tion. Colonel Nat Franklin of the

6th Pennsylvania
Cavalry dashes
here and there,
stops now and
then to contem
plate the whole
question of war
and peace, an is
sue upon which
more competent
observers than he
have ''bogged

down." But Allen doesn't allow his
hero to founder in speculation on
the future of mankind. He fills his
book with 50 major characters,
plenty of fighting, hard riding, and
lots of local color that liven the
pages.
Subordinating the justly-famous
descriptive passages that made his
first book notable to a few selected
spots throughout the work, Allen
writes a straight prose adventure
yarn that is thoroughly readable.
He lays the plot in the beautiful
Shenandoah Valley, nestling in the
Blue Ridge Mountains; and he
cooks up just the requisite dash of
romance to hold the reader's in
terest, too.
Since the volume has already re
corded an advance sale of 102.500
copies, it looks as if readers will
once more see a Civil War romance
topping the best-seller lists. Mr.
Allen stuck to the old lucky
"double-A" combination (remember
"Anthony Adverse"), and it seems
to be repeating.
