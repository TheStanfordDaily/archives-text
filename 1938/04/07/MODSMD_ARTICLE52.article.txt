## "GENUINE PEACE" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Being a sincere pacifist, I am com
pletely out of sympathy with such
smart alec publicity seekers as
Marco Thorne. His so-called so
ciety, copied alter similar groups in
other universities, is an affront to
every honest pacifistic effort. I am
surprised at the usually intelligent
editors of The Daily for besmirch
ing the pages of their paper with
pseudo-pacifist Thome's name and
thus realizing the purpose of his
adolescent "satire." May his fol
lowers be few and the end of his
ridiculous group a speedy one.
A Genuine Pacifist
