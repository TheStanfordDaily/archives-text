# NEW WOLF STORY

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I should like to suggest that The
Daily reprint within the next day or
two Dave MellinkofT's Bull Session
of several years ago in which he de
scribed the effects of a fire in En

cina Hall.
This suggestion is occasioned by
the indiscriminate ringing of the fire
alarm system which was installed in
the hall as the result of the uproar
which that particular Session caused.
The freshmen do not seem to realize
that the system was installed for but
one purpose, and was not intended
its a plaything, the use to which it
has been put for the past few days.
Unless the false alarms stop, I
feat that we shall all be barbecued
a golden brown some of these nights
when there really is a fire. The
shepherd boy who cried wolf, you
remember
Respectfully,
T. W. Mitchell
