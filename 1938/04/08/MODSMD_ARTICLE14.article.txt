# Five-Year Harmony Ends Row Split Third in Decade
## 
### 
For the first time in five years
and the third in ten, the Row is
split over the office of A.S.S.U.
president. Bill Hawkins this year
broke the precedent by entering
against H. B. Lee. Row, and Harry
I Horton, Hall.
An unusual situation occurred in
1930 when Dan Calvin, Deke, ran
against Tom Pike, Alpha Delt, afid
Herbert Wenit{, Hall. Calvin tried
to decline but the deadline was past.
In a successful attempt to mend the
split, Calvin expressed the wish in
The Daily that he be given no votes.
Pike won. No less unusual is the fart
! that in all occasions of a Row split.
' the Row has been victorious.
In I?W3 C.erry Trautman. Deke,

ran against "Ike"' Livermore, Alpha
Delt. and John Hunecke. Hall, on an
independent ticket and won by a
large margin.
One candidate only ran for the
presidential position in 1931 when
Bob Brown, Hall, was unopposed.
The same year there was only one
candidate for vice-presidency.
Three times, in 10 years there
have been three candidates for
A.S.S.U. president, each time one
Row man and two Hall men run
ning. The last time three candidates
were listed was in 1936 when Chick
Franich. Hall. Jim Reynolds, Row;
and Boh Bernhard, independent, all
vied for the position, Reynolds be
ing the victor.
