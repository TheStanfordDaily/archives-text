# Sequoia Barn Dance Holds Spot Tonight
## 
### 
Al Sebring and his orchestra will
bring "hot-smooth" music to Se
quoia tonight when doors of the hall
swing open for its annual barn dance
at 9 o'clock. Those who have not
purchased bids at the A.S.S.U. office
may obtain them at the door.
With hayrides, novel decorations,
and specialty numbers arranged for
the occasion, Dance Chairman Earle
Fidanque declared plans to make
this year's dance the "biggest-ever"
had been completed.
Two loud speakers at each end of
the first floor will permit dancing in
the hallways. A chute has been in
stalled at the entrance of the dining
hall.
Sebring's orchestra recently signed
an R.K.O. contract for a tour
throughout the United States this
summer. Specializing in two unique
styles, the band boasts both fast and
slow versions of current numbers.
Those attending should dress ac
cording to the customary barn dance
style, according to Fidanque. Danc
ing will continue until 1 o'clock. '
