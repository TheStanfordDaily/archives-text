The Daily apologizes for an
unintended implication in yes
terday's paper, in which Dick
Stark, Phi Delt, was mention
ed as a suspect in the Frome
murder case.
The story developed because,
in tracing a possible clue, po
lice had been instructed to
question all Bay region men of
that name, and Stanford's
Stalk was interviewed accord
ingly. He was immediately ex
onerated.
Stark had been spending his
time as an ambitious medical
student in the campus physiol
ogy lab. During the two days
police spent searching for him.
four newspaper reporters had
gone to the lab to interview
him
