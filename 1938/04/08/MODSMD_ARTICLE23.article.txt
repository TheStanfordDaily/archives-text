# A.S.U. Told Of German Policy
## Illif, Buck Consider Ways To Stop Hitler 
### 
Professor John W. Illif and Philip
W. Buck spoke at a meeting of the
A.S.U. last night on the question,
"Will accession to Germany stop her
present aggressive; policy?"
Professor Illif said he did not
think there was any way of stop
ping the bluffing, gangster tactics,
which make up the Fascist tech
nique, without some kind of strong
collective action by the other na
tions of the world.
Is Pessimistic
He was pessimistic about being
able to break down the international
racketeering technique of taking
land whenever a dictator wants it
or thinks he needs it.
Professor Buck said:
"Dictators can be killed with
kindness, or could have been earlier,
but I doubt if it can be done at the
present time. If people would have
an economic upturn, they would not
need Hitler so much. However, to
day, even intelligent people say
that no one but a Hitler can de
liver the goods, create an "ansch
luss" with Austria.
Must Know Rea. ons
"We don't want to fight Hitler on
just the issue of dictatorship alone,
we don't want to defend Austria
from Germany; for the German
people will follow Hitler only so
long as he proves that he is giving
them something. If we organize
against Hitler, we must know, what
we are arguing for.
"I don't think that anything Ger
many has seized up to this time of
fers sufficient excuse for our go
ing to war, and rather than war, an
economic readjustment on the map
of Europe is needed.''
