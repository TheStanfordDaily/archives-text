# Hawkins Seeking 'Logical Ticket'
## Jean Reynolds Fails To Decline New Vice-president Nomination 
### 
Kill Hawkins, independent candidate for A.S.S.U. president, last niffht
I was reported seeking to form an independent slate for next Tuesday's
| election.
Ancl> Stojkovich, Hall nominee for senior man on Fx Committee, said
I he was appioachcd yesterday by Hawkins, who was interested in form-

Definite time for the session, in
Memorial Hall, has not yet been
set, but probably will be 10 o'clock,

o'clock this morning, with classes
not to be dismissed, but later was
postponed because of the lack of

Candidates to be presented are
