# Gifts Average $2000 a Day For Last Year
## Wilbur Advocates Adoption of New Plan In President's Report 
### 
Approximately $2000 per day is the
rate of a "steady How of gifts" to
Stanford, according to the annual
report of President Ray Lyman Wil
bur to the Board of Trustees, and a
total amount of $736,775 in gifts and
bequests was received by the Uni
versity during the academic year
ending August 31, 1937.
"This total for the year has been
exceeded only three times in Stan
ford history," comments the report.
"However, the total amount received
in bequests is woefully small com
pared with bequests received by
other major universities."
Roseberry Plan
Possible solution of this problem
is hoped for by means of a plan de
vised under the leadership of Sen
ator L. H. Roseberry of Los An-
I geles and which was experimentally
| installed in Los Angeles County
i during the past year.
Under this plan, services of Stan
| ford lawyers, doctors, and trust of
| ficers were obtained to present to
j possible or potential donors the
I needs and opportunities' of the Uni
; versity.
Early Results Good
j "Although it will require approxi
i mately a year to complete the work,
' the early results were sufficiently
satisfactory ot justify our proceed
ing with the installation of the plan
in San Francisco and Alameda
! counties," says Chairman Morgan A.
I Gunst of the Committee on Special
! Gifts, Trusts, and Bequests in a
i statement to the president.
"It is hoped that within a com
paratively few years the Roseberry
;Plan will correct this weakness. It
| should cause critical comment for
any Stanford man not to have men
tioned Stanford University in his
I will for some appropriate amount,"
j concludes the committee.
Large amounts accepted by the
! University during the year 1936-37
include $208,184 from the American
Relief Administration; $113,500 from
j the Rockefeller Foundation of New
i York to be donated over a period of
years; $73,884 from the National
Youth Administration, State of Cali
fornia; and $50,000 from the estate
iof John M. Switzer to establish a
: loan and scholarship fund.

I for a three-year period was re
ceived in support of an experimental
program in the language arts, and
1535,000 from the same board for

Possible solution of this problem
is hoped for by means of a plan de
vised under the leadership of Sen
ator L. H. Roseberry of Los An-
I geles and which was experimentally
| installed in Los Angeles County
i during the past year.
Under this plan, services of Stan
| ford lawyers, doctors, and trust of
| ficers were obtained to present to
j possible or potential donors the
I needs and opportunities' of the Uni
; versity.
Early Results Good
j "Although it will require approxi
i mately a year to complete the work,
' the early results were sufficiently
satisfactory ot justify our proceed
ing with the installation of the plan
in San Francisco and Alameda
! counties," says Chairman Morgan A.
I Gunst of the Committee on Special
! Gifts, Trusts, and Bequests in a
i statement to the president.
"It is hoped that within a com
paratively few years the Roseberry
;Plan will correct this weakness. It
| should cause critical comment for
any Stanford man not to have men
tioned Stanford University in his
I will for some appropriate amount,"
j concludes the committee.
Large amounts accepted by the
! University during the year 1936-37
include $208,184 from the American
Relief Administration; $113,500 from
j the Rockefeller Foundation of New
i York to be donated over a period of
years; $73,884 from the National
Youth Administration, State of Cali
fornia; and $50,000 from the estate
iof John M. Switzer to establish a
: loan and scholarship fund.
Hopkins Memorial
Also as a gift, Mrs. Timothy flop
kins of San Francisco established
the Timothy Hopkins Memorial Room
j in the main library.
From the General Education Board
i of New York City, a grant of $45,000
I for a three-year period was re
ceived in support of an experimental
program in the language arts, and
1535,000 from the same board for
(.support of a project on independent
j study. Of this latter grant $15,000 is
'to be received during the present
i academic year.
Approximately $2000 per day is the
rate of a "steady How of gifts" to
Stanford, according to the annual
report of President Ray Lyman Wil
bur to the Board of Trustees, and a
total amount of $736,775 in gifts and
bequests was received by the Uni
versity during the academic year
ending August 31, 1937.
"This total for the year has been
exceeded only three times in Stan
ford history," comments the report.
"However, the total amount received
in bequests is woefully small com
pared with bequests received by
other major universities."
