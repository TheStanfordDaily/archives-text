# Purdy To Preach Sunday Sermon
## 
### 
Dr. Alexander C. Purdy, acting
University chaplain, will deliver a
sermon on "The Way of the Cross"
at the regular Sunday morning
service in the Memorial Church.
The cross is the Christian symbol
memorializing an event in history of
supreme significance to the race.
Unless the cross symbolizes also a
way of living today which releases
and heightens personality and trans
forms situations and societies, it may
be merely sentiment or even magic,
said Purdy. The way of the cross
interpreted in terms of concrete
living is the only adequate dynamic
for a better world.
Music will be furnished by the
Pomona College Men's Glee Club.
Ralph Lyman is the director.
