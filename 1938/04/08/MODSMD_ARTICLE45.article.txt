## 
### 
Former President Herbert Hoover returned to his home on the Stanford
campus yesterday morning from his trip to Europe and emphatically
declared that he will not make an attempt to regain the Presidency.
Mr. Hoover's first speaking engagement is scheduled tonight at a recep
tion in the War Memorial Auditorium in San Francisco, from where his

speech will be broadcast locally
Station KPO at 8:30 o'clock.
No Comeback
Upon arrival in San Francisco j
yesterday morning, after denying j
reports that he was planning a po- j
litical comeback, Mr. Hoover reiter- |
ated past criticism of recent New j
Deal action and policy.
In commenting upon the New I
Deal, Mr. Hoover declared that he
believes it is moving the United
States away from democracy, and
said that he is definitely opposed to
(he Administration's reorganization
bill.
"It is the extension of presidential
jx>wer that is the vice of this bill," he
said.
Lists Developments
As regards the political situation
in Europe, Mr. Hoover listed three
outstanding developments. First, he
said, is the rise of authoritarian and
totalitarian types of government.
"The second point is the fact that
• -veryone in Europe is filled with
/car. Nations are on the defensive
and increasing their armaments,
partly because of the dictatorships
and partly because the League of
Nations program of settlement of
disputes by negotiation has broken
down," he said.
Third Point
Third point in the situation is the
"rise of brutality," which the ex-
President believes is due to "eco
nomic misery."
"The danger in our country is in
that direction—the same as that of
any state in Europe that has lost its
democracy, because it has been lost
ad the result ot economic misery,"
he declared.
Longevity of the present dictator
ships in Europe, Mr. Hoover con
cludes, is due to be a Jong one, and
he said that there is little chance
of change back to democracy in the
near future in those countries which
now possess authoritarian forms of
government.
