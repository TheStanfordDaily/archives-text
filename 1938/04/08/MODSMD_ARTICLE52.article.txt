# Track Men Meet Uclans Tomorrow
## Farm Team Makes Local Debut Here; Bruin Squad Tough 
### 
Stanford's dark-horse track-and
field team makes its local competi
tive bow tomorrow afternoon when
U.C.L.A. invades Angell Field for a
Pacific Coast Conference meet. The
shot put and discus throw com
mence at 1:45 o'clock with the first
track event, the mile run, getting
off 15 minutes later.
Usually uninteresting to fans, the
two weight events are liable to turn
into long distance duels today, with
Woodrow Wilson Strode, Negro
Adonis from the southland, putting
in a bid for first places in both
events.
Shot Put Duel on Tap
In the shot, Strode tangles with
Tom Montgomery, Stanford's 6-foot,
6-inch giant, who is capable of beat
ing any collegian in the country
when he is in the mood. The win
ner should be upwards of 51 feet, a
mark each has surpassed several
times.
Pete Zagar and Hugh Gribbin op
pose the lanky Bruin in the discus
and all three will probably put the
platter out of the lot, that is, over
155 feet anyway. Last week at
Fresno, Gribbin pulled an upset and
beat teammate Zagar with a lengthy
heave of 156 feet, 1 inch.
Injuns Favored
Although the Injuns are figured to
easily trounce the Bruins, who took
a 95-36 beating from California last
Saturday, the southerners boast
enough individual strength to be
conceded a possible six first places
and another tie out of a possible 15.
Tom Berkley and Bill Lacefield
are favored in the low and high
hurdles, respectively, and Lacefield
is practically a cinch in the broad
jump also. Clark Shaughnessy
should annex the javelin, and
Strode is the favorite in his two
events, although it would be only
a minor upset if he had to be con
tent with a pair of seconds.
Burrows To Run Twice
Farm fans are looking forward to
the possibility of Edson Burrows
running both the mile and two-mile
tomorrow. Burrows is Stanford's
answer to the challenge of U.S.C.'s
Zamperini and Cal's Sadaj and
Mehlert in the distance races.
Captain Paul Van- Alstine will
run both races for the visitors and
will be out for revenge for the pair
of clean sweeps the Bears pasted on
him last week. Van Alstine was
one of the leading two-milers on the
Coast last season and he should be
able to seriously press Burrows in
the long race. There is a strong
possibility that Ed will run the 880
instead of the two-mile.
Captain Ray Malott will make an
other stab at a world's quarter-mile
record, but lack of competition
makes his goal improbable. The
first time he runs up against some
one who can force him, he should
break the mark.
Dope Sheet Written
Despite the fact that Templeton
hasn't definitely decided upon his
line-up yet and may juggle several
men before the meet, a dope-sheet,
which favors the Cards by an 82-
4!) score, is presented from a gen
eral concensus of Stanford Daily
sports writers:

one of the leading two-milers on the
Coast last season and he should be
able to seriously press Burrows in
the long race. There is a strong
possibility that Ed will run the 880

Captain Ray Malott will make an
other stab at a world's quarter-mile
record, but lack of competition
makes his goal improbable. The
first time he runs up against some
one who can force him, he should
break the mark.
Dope Sheet Written
Despite the fact that Templeton
hasn't definitely decided upon his
line-up yet and may juggle several
men before the meet, a dope-sheet,
which favors the Cards by an 82-
4!) score, is presented from a gen
eral concensus of Stanford Daily
sports writers:
100—Hiserman (S), Berkley (C),
Casey (S).
220—Hiserman (S), Sparling (S),
Casey (S).
440—Malott. (S), Mahurin (S),
Rockwell (S).
880—Williamson (S), Mahurin
(S), Dunning (C).
Mile—Burrows (S), Van Alstine
(C), March (S).
2-mile—Burrows (S), Van Alstine
(C), Ganahl (S).
High hurdles —Lacefield (C),
Simpson (S), Hawkins (S).
Low hurdles—Berkley (C), Simp
son (S), Hawkins (S).
Relay—Stanford.

Stanford's dark-horse track-and
field team makes its local competi
tive bow tomorrow afternoon when
U.C.L.A. invades Angell Field for a
Pacific Coast Conference meet. The
shot put and discus throw com
mence at 1:45 o'clock with the first
track event, the mile run, getting
off 15 minutes later.
Usually uninteresting to fans, the
two weight events are liable to turn
into long distance duels today, with
Woodrow Wilson Strode, Negro
Adonis from the southland, putting
in a bid for first places in both
events.
Shot Put Duel on Tap
In the shot, Strode tangles with
Tom Montgomery, Stanford's 6-foot,
6-inch giant, who is capable of beat
ing any collegian in the country
when he is in the mood. The win
ner should be upwards of 51 feet, a
mark each has surpassed several
times.
Pete Zagar and Hugh Gribbin op
pose the lanky Bruin in the discus
and all three will probably put the
platter out of the lot, that is, over
155 feet anyway. Last week at
Fresno, Gribbin pulled an upset and
beat teammate Zagar with a lengthy
heave of 156 feet, 1 inch.
Injuns Favored
Although the Injuns are figured to
easily trounce the Bruins, who took
a 95-36 beating from California last
Saturday, the southerners boast
enough individual strength to be
conceded a possible six first places
and another tie out of a possible 15.
Tom Berkley and Bill Lacefield
are favored in the low and high
hurdles, respectively, and Lacefield
is practically a cinch in the broad
jump also. Clark Shaughnessy
should annex the javelin, and
Strode is the favorite in his two
events, although it would be only
a minor upset if he had to be con
tent with a pair of seconds.
Burrows To Run Twice
Farm fans are looking forward to
the possibility of Edson Burrows
running both the mile and two-mile
tomorrow. Burrows is Stanford's
answer to the challenge of U.S.C.'s
Zamperini and Cal's Sadaj and
Mehlert in the distance races.
Captain Paul Van- Alstine will
run both races for the visitors and
will be out for revenge for the pair
of clean sweeps the Bears pasted on
him last week. Van Alstine was
one of the leading two-milers on the
Coast last season and he should be
able to seriously press Burrows in
the long race. There is a strong
possibility that Ed will run the 880
