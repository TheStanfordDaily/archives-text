(Walt Peterson again abdicates
today to allow Jerry Mayer to
conclude his review on the Cali- j
fornia track situation.)

Stanford comes into its own in the
weight events. Tom Montgomery
hasn't an opponent to fear on the
Coast this year — except Woodrow
Wilson Strode of U.C.L.A. and his
own inconsistency, which prompts
his puts to fluctuate anywhere from
46 feet to 51. Jack Lipman's 50-
footer last Week establishes him as
a definite comer and Stan Anderson
is doing 48 consistently. Jim Kitts of
Cal, after a year's layoff due to an
injury, is coming back strong and
should be close to 50 feet soon. Bob
Fisher of S.C. isn't anything to write
home about. The man to watch is
W! W. Strode, U.C.L.A.'s negro
Adonis. Strode is a lazy cuss, but
he can throw the shot and discus
out of the lot if he feels like it.
Pete Zagar of Stanford and Phil
Gaspa/ of S.C. are both classy plat
ter heavers, and Hugh Gribbin of
the Farm is moving up.
In the javelin, Chuck Soper is
Troy is essaying a comeback and
looks good. So does Reed Trusel,
S.C.'s javelin tosser. Clark Shaugh
nessy of Ucla is also consistent at
200 feet. Doug Lehman of Cal and
George Shaw of Stanford aren't quite
in the class of the others.
R's the same old story in the
pole vault—all Troy. Loren Day
keeps up the tradition of Southern
Cal's 14-foot bamboo artists.
Kenny Dills and Irving Howe are
also better than any other Coast
vauTters. Vic Roore and Duke
Gill of Stanford are mediocre,
but at least can hold their own
with Norman Miller of Westwood
and Ray McCarthy of Cal.
Delos Thurber, S.C.'s Olympic
Games high jumper, and Russ
Wulff of Stanford should wage
some merry battles this year.
Thurber looks good now but Dink
Templeton has predicted a ceiling of
6 feet 8 inches for the Indian. Rob
ert Law of Cal can also catapult
himself around 6-4.
Bill Lacefield, U.C.L.A. triple
event negro — hurdles and broad
jump—has leaped over 24 feet sev
eral times. Don Skinner of S. C.
isn't too good and Bill Bloomfield,
another Trojan, has surpassed him
several times already this season.
Guy Manuel, Cal veteran, has some
class. Ray Brown, Card soph, is a
comer.
That about rounds up this review.
Its only purpose has been to pre
sent track fans with a brief outline
of the better cinderpathmen in the
southern division of the Pacific
Coast Conference. There are prob
ably many others who will rise and
shine before the season ends, but at
the present those mentioned above
just about represent the class of the
section.

also better than any other Coast
vauTters. Vic Roore and Duke
Gill of Stanford are mediocre,
but at least can hold their own
with Norman Miller of Westwood
and Ray McCarthy of Cal.
Delos Thurber, S.C.'s Olympic
Games high jumper, and Russ
Wulff of Stanford should wage
some merry battles this year.
Thurber looks good now but Dink
Templeton has predicted a ceiling of
6 feet 8 inches for the Indian. Rob
ert Law of Cal can also catapult
himself around 6-4.
Bill Lacefield, U.C.L.A. triple
event negro — hurdles and broad
jump—has leaped over 24 feet sev
eral times. Don Skinner of S. C.
isn't too good and Bill Bloomfield,
another Trojan, has surpassed him
several times already this season.
Guy Manuel, Cal veteran, has some
class. Ray Brown, Card soph, is a
comer.
That about rounds up this review.
Its only purpose has been to pre
sent track fans with a brief outline
of the better cinderpathmen in the
southern division of the Pacific
Coast Conference. There are prob
ably many others who will rise and
shine before the season ends, but at
the present those mentioned above
just about represent the class of the
section.
(Walt Peterson again abdicates
today to allow Jerry Mayer to
conclude his review on the Cali- j
fornia track situation.)

Stanford comes into its own in the
weight events. Tom Montgomery
hasn't an opponent to fear on the
Coast this year — except Woodrow
Wilson Strode of U.C.L.A. and his
own inconsistency, which prompts
his puts to fluctuate anywhere from
46 feet to 51. Jack Lipman's 50-
footer last Week establishes him as
a definite comer and Stan Anderson
is doing 48 consistently. Jim Kitts of
Cal, after a year's layoff due to an
injury, is coming back strong and
should be close to 50 feet soon. Bob
Fisher of S.C. isn't anything to write
home about. The man to watch is
W! W. Strode, U.C.L.A.'s negro
Adonis. Strode is a lazy cuss, but
he can throw the shot and discus
out of the lot if he feels like it.
Pete Zagar of Stanford and Phil
Gaspa/ of S.C. are both classy plat
ter heavers, and Hugh Gribbin of
the Farm is moving up.
In the javelin, Chuck Soper is
Troy is essaying a comeback and
looks good. So does Reed Trusel,
S.C.'s javelin tosser. Clark Shaugh
nessy of Ucla is also consistent at
200 feet. Doug Lehman of Cal and
George Shaw of Stanford aren't quite
in the class of the others.
R's the same old story in the
pole vault—all Troy. Loren Day
keeps up the tradition of Southern
Cal's 14-foot bamboo artists.
Kenny Dills and Irving Howe are
also better than any other Coast
vauTters. Vic Roore and Duke
Gill of Stanford are mediocre,
but at least can hold their own
with Norman Miller of Westwood
and Ray McCarthy of Cal.
