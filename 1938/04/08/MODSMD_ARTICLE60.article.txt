# Bear Mermen Picked To Win Big Swim Meet
## Victory for Cards Possible; Close Final Score Anticipated 
### 
The closest Big Swim meet in re
cent years is expected tomorrow
when California and Stanford re
new a rivalry which, up to this yea-r,
has seen the Indians in the favored
role.
Despite their rise in strength
during the past two weeks, Nort
Thornton's swimmers will open as
underdogs for the first time in 20
years. California won last year, but
they had to upset the odds-on In
dians to do it.
Chances Slim
Many of the swimming hole ex
perts seem to think that Stanford's
chances for victory are hinging on
the abilities of men to come
through in the right races. The two
most crucial tests will be in the
back stroke and the breast stroke.
Jim Werson and Paul Collins of Cal
are the best pair of frog leg ex
perts on the Coast, but Bill Hatch
and Don Towne have improved to a
point where they might cop second
and third in the 200-yard grind.
Hatch turned a 2:38.0 time in prac
tice Wednesday without competi
tion and Towne upset Roy Vitousek
of the frosh last Saturday with an
unexpected last lap punch.
Mason Letteau, the forgotten
back-stroker who couldn't even get
the papers to spell his name cor
rectly, holds a 10-point balance in
his performances tomorrow. If he
wins the back stroke with Weather
be of the Cards behind him in sec
ond place, he will give Stanford a
chance of victory.
Backstroke Close
Letteau also will swim the 100-
yard upside down lap in the medley
relay, and here too victory or de
feat rests on his time. Weatherbe
won the Big Swim back stroke last
year and has been improving enough
to pull a first place surprise.
Jack Vibert, Dick Clarke, and
Johnny Brahtz are the Indian short
distance free-style men who must
beat Barber and Jim Shields of the
Bears to keep Stanford in the swim.
When Clarke and Brahtz warm up
they are capable of :24.6 50-yard
marks and Vibert has swum close to
:54 fiat in the century.
Cal Diver (*ood
Even Roy Winkleman, Stanford's
perennial diving champ, will have
his troubles with Danny Kuhns, an
All-American as a soph, who quit
school for two years and annexed a
wife in addition. The Berkeley
spies report that Kuhns is a cinch
to hand "Wink" his second defeat in
three years.
The meet is scheduled to start at
3:30 o'clock after the U.C.L.A. track
meet with an admisison charge of
25 cents with student body cards.

Even Roy Winkleman, Stanford's
perennial diving champ, will have
his troubles with Danny Kuhns, an
All-American as a soph, who quit
school for two years and annexed a
wife in addition. The Berkeley
spies report that Kuhns is a cinch
to hand "Wink" his second defeat in
three years.
The meet is scheduled to start at
3:30 o'clock after the U.C.L.A. track
meet with an admisison charge of
25 cents with student body cards.
The closest Big Swim meet in re
cent years is expected tomorrow
when California and Stanford re
new a rivalry which, up to this yea-r,
has seen the Indians in the favored
role.
Despite their rise in strength
during the past two weeks, Nort
Thornton's swimmers will open as
underdogs for the first time in 20
years. California won last year, but
they had to upset the odds-on In
dians to do it.
Chances Slim
Many of the swimming hole ex
perts seem to think that Stanford's
chances for victory are hinging on
the abilities of men to come
through in the right races. The two
most crucial tests will be in the
back stroke and the breast stroke.
Jim Werson and Paul Collins of Cal
are the best pair of frog leg ex
perts on the Coast, but Bill Hatch
and Don Towne have improved to a
point where they might cop second
and third in the 200-yard grind.
Hatch turned a 2:38.0 time in prac
tice Wednesday without competi
tion and Towne upset Roy Vitousek
of the frosh last Saturday with an
unexpected last lap punch.
Mason Letteau, the forgotten
back-stroker who couldn't even get
the papers to spell his name cor
rectly, holds a 10-point balance in
his performances tomorrow. If he
wins the back stroke with Weather
be of the Cards behind him in sec
ond place, he will give Stanford a
chance of victory.
Backstroke Close
Letteau also will swim the 100-
yard upside down lap in the medley
relay, and here too victory or de
feat rests on his time. Weatherbe
won the Big Swim back stroke last
year and has been improving enough
to pull a first place surprise.
Jack Vibert, Dick Clarke, and
Johnny Brahtz are the Indian short
distance free-style men who must
beat Barber and Jim Shields of the
Bears to keep Stanford in the swim.
When Clarke and Brahtz warm up
they are capable of :24.6 50-yard
marks and Vibert has swum close to
:54 fiat in the century.
