# Indian Nine To Plan Cal, Bruins
## U.C. Squad Set To Take Farm Team Woltermen Rated At Short Odds For First Game Series 
### 
The University of California, both
branches of it, suppiies all the op
position for Stanford s varsity base
ball team today and tomorrow.
Coach Harry Wolter takes his
boys over to Edward's Field, Ber
keley, tomorrow at 3:30 o'clock to
tangle with the Bears in the first of
the three Big Games played an
nually between the two rivals.
Series Jinx
Stanford hasn't won a Cal series
since 1931, and there are no indica
tions that the Cards will break that
seven-year spell this season, except
that anything can happen in base
ball. The Bears are strongly en
trenched in second place in the C.I.
B.A. standings and are waging a
hot race for the title with U.S.C.'s
Trojans.
The Indians, on the other hand,
can boast no better than next to last
place, with three victories and six
setbacks. California, 1937 champions,
have the same team, except for two
positions, that carried them to last
year's title. They combine a hard
hitting outfit, led by Sam Chapman,
an airtight defense, and the second
best pitcher in the conference in
Bill Priest, who will oppose the In
dians.
Infield Weak
Stanford's main weakness has been
at the plate and in the infield. The
pitching, with a few exceptions, has
been steady, but has lacked support
in the field. The return of Captain
George Farrell to third base and
Dick Shortall to shortstop, moving
Dick Tam back to his regular second
base spot, has helped bolster the in
field this week.
The Card batters have failed to
come through in most games this
season and in the last two games
left ten men or more stranded on
the base paths. Jimmy Coffis and
Norm Juney are the only hitters
over the .300 mark.
Bruins to Play at Farm
Co;ich Marty Krug brings his
hard-hitting Bruins from West wood
to the Farm to engage the Indians
in the "rubber" match for the two
teams today at 3:30 o'clock. In two
tilts down south they broke even,
Stanford winning the first, 8-3, and
losing the second, 13-1.
Harry Wolter has not indicated his
pitching choices as yet, but it is cer
tain that A1 Lazzarone and Spike
J urman will each hurl one game
with Bill Jameson doing the catch
ing. They will be opposed by Car
ter and Ewing of the Bruins and
Priest and Lombardi for Cal.
