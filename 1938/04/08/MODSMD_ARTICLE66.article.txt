# Frosh Nine Set For Cal Opener
## Yearlings Seek First Series in 11 Years 
### 
Tapering off in their last two prac
tice sessions, the Stanford frosh nine
will attempt to break an 11-year
losing streak when they meet the
Cal Cubs tomorrow morning at 10:30
o'clock on Edwards Field in the var
sity opener.
In the three-game series for the
past decade and a year, the frosh
have managed to win only four
games. In 1927 the Cubs took the
first two tilts handily and since then
they have repeated every year ex
cept 29, .'3l, '35, and '37. The third
game of the series only was neces
sary during those years.
Barely Miss
Last year the Papooses came with
in an ace of breaking their jinx when
they waxed the Balay Bears 13-0 on
the Card diamond. The second en
counter at Berkeley found them
trailing by eight tallies in the eighth
inning, but a spurt gave them 11
runs to pull them into the lead, only
to see a heartbreaking Cal rally beat
them in the last inning, 14-11. The
third game, here on their home dia
mond, saw a demoralized Encina
outfit lose, 14-1.
Tomorrow, Coaches Harry Shipke
and Bobby Grayson will put their
big guns into the opening lineup
in an attempt to tuck the opening
game beneath the belt of the Injun.
Big "Cootie" Thompson, with four
victories and one defeat marked up,
will be their starting mound ace.
Catchers Are Toss-up
His battery mate will be a toss-up
between Herb Atkinson and Paul
fay. Herb Bull, .sparkling short
stop, is rounding into shape after
his arm injury sustained Tuesday
and will break into the starting line
up.
Bearcub mentor Joe Gallison has
a strong hurling staff to use against
the Cards. If his port-sided ace,
Mike Koll, is touched by the Stan
ford hitters, he has two more capable
pitchers, Paul Holmes and Frank
Morgan, to back them up.
