# Frosh Tankmen Favored Over Cal Tomorrow
## 'Little Swim' Meet Scheduled Between 'Big Meet' Events 
### 
Hemmed in between the varsity
swimming races tomorrow will be j
the annual Little Swim with the \
Stanford frosh a definite favorite to !
win.
Little publicity has come forth j
about the capabilities of the Bear
cub waterdogs, but they don't boast
of two such versatile men as Roy |
Vitousek and Bill Weeden. Weeden
will be out to crack the Cal-Stanford
frosh back-stroke record tomorrow
as well as any other marks he |
mi gfit annex on the way. In addi
tion he will swim on the free-style j
and the medley relays.
Vitousek Stole
Vitousek suffered a slight bit of j
staleness in three meets last week
but came back Wednesday against
Menlo with a national record in the
50-yard free style of :24_6. He will
swim that event as well as the 200- j
yard breast-stroke and seems likely I
to take first in both. He also swims j
the anchor lap of the 400-yard free
style relay. «
Thus the yearlings seem rather
sure of victories in four events to
talling 29 points. They need 38 for
a victory.
Stein Favored
Don Stein is favored in the diving
with Nichols of Stanford favored in
the runner-up spot. Aston, Morris,
and Kern will carry the Papoose
burden in the 100-yard, and possibly
the 220-yard free-style races. The
440 will probably be a gift to the
Cubs.
Bob Teitjen is a scrappy little
breast stroke man who ought to
win enough points to bring in a
second or third behind Vitousek.
