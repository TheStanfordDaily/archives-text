# How About a Coke?

ONE speaker will miss his cue. Another will
cough, stammer, and say, "I will fulfill
the office to the best of my ability." And when
they get down to the lower offices, where no
one has to speak, there will be confusion, and
some of the candidates won't be there.
That will be on the stage of Memorial Hall,
Monday, and it won't matter much. For out
in front there will be only a handful of students
who have the gueer idea that they'd like to see
the persons they will be voting for the next day.
But Stanford, nevertheless, will be carrying
out the constitutional mandate. The little white
book says an assembly to introduce candidates
shall be held on the Thursday preceding the
election, but arrangements couldn't be made in
time. A little fudging won't make the meeting
any worse or any better.
That's the way it will be. If classs are dis
missed for one morning hour the attendance
will be a little better. Even then the candidates
could speak to a larger house if they spoke in
the Cellar rather than at the theater. If it's held
in the afternoon and evening, nothing short of
Gaieties tryouts will draw a representative
crowd.
Perhaps, if Ex Committee had thought of it,
the rule would have been revoked last Tues
day. It would have saved the bother. But the
rule is in the books and it will be carried out
after a fashion. There will, however, be little
thought of why the rule is in the books.
Yet that little paragraph must have started
out bravely. Some office holder in the past,
more of a student statesman than a politician,
must have realized Stanford had grown beyond
the stage where there was personal contact of
every student with every student. The para
graph is a monument, though a rather futile one,
to his vision.
But he had a good idea there. The campus
will vote Tuesday on rumors and stereotypes
that in no sense are completely true. The jam
packed assembly run off with professional snap,
which this office holder of the past must have
imagined, would eliminate such voting.
In fact it's a good enough idea to justify drag
ging out the band, the glee club, a couple of
one-act plays, or anything alse that will get a
crowd. If not this year, do it next year.
But there probably isn't time between now
and Monday to pep the meeting up. And no
one reads Daily editorials a year later.
Someday, someone may see the futility of it,
and have the little paragraph taken out of the
book.
