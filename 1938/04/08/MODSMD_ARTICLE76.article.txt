# Struck Where It Hurts

### 
UP in San Francisco the Newspaper Guild
and the publishers have taken off their
coats and are talking economics with their jaws
stuck out. Negotiations are secret, but continual
strike rumors show that the situation is well out
of the tea-party class.
Neither the Guild nor the publishers are at
all interested in Stanford. The Farm returns
the complimenl by showing no interest in the
threatened strike. Most of the students seem
to feel that with basketball finished there is
no particular reason for publishing newspapers
anyway.
But even though it cuts the Newspaper Guild
dead, Stanford cannot alter its importance to
college men. Many undergraduates haven't
bothered to notice it, but Guild represents a
kind of union that may be more important to
them than the pull their fathers exert.
The Guild is even more than a white collar
union. It is a sport-collar union. It consists of
men who do skilled intellectual v/ork. Many
of its members are college men. Most of the
others have acquired through experience the
equivalent of a college education.
And Guild members are not low-paid rough
necks whose wages barely clear the zero mark
on the economists' graphs. Some of them make

SIOO a week, or more. If that dream of the
movies, the flash reporter, existed, he would
have to save Guild dues out of the bonus he
spends on binges. And if the movies' glamor
ous sob-sister could be discovered, we would
find her leaving appealing newsboys and aban
doned dogs unnoticed as she hurried to Guild
meeting.
Any college man who goes into newspaper
work will have to face the problem of Guild
membership. And the Guild is only the most
prominent one of a number of "gentlemen's"
unions. If the present trend continues every
young man who enters business will find a
union rushing him; the rushing may not follow
Interfraternity Council rules.
Perhaps the Newspaper Guild's little argu
ment means more to the Stanford Rough than
a possible shortage of comic pages.—J. C.
