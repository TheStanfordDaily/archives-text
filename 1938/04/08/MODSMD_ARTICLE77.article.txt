# BULL SESSION
## IDEA 
### 
OELLWETIIER dropped into the Shack yesterday
afternoon with what was evidently his latest idea
in his campaign for president of the Associated Stu
dents. If rumor is to be believed, he is gathering ad
herents like a wad of gum, and I noted a certain
assurance which seemed to indicate as much.
"It's my theory," he began, "that a lot of the fuss
that arises around here about election-time is due to
the fact that there are entirely too many opportunities
for dirty politics."
"You're not actually intimating that Farm politics
aren't pure, Bellwether?"
"Certainly not. There's just a surprising lack of
honesty, that's all. Therefore, I think if I were presi
dent I'd put through a constitutional change that
would do something about it. To begin with, I'd advo
cate one election in the year, to be held during the
first two weeks of the quarter, each living group to
elect within itself one representative to Ex Committee."
"That idea and its variations have been hashed and
rehashed before, and without results. Besides that,
you'd never get anything done with 48 people on your
Committee.'
"Oh, yes, I would. I'd have a Council of Ten to
handle urgent executive business."
"And how would you select this mythical Council?"
"They'd select themselves, by a very simple proc
ess. The whole 48 would draw for it."
"Oh. Do you give away automobiles, too?"
"I'm trying to be serious about this, if you'd only
co-operate. At first glance it may seem like a rather
haphazard system, but look at it for a moment. If
out of 48 ballots there are 10 marked 'Council,' there
can never be any charges of finagling brought against
the Committee. Everyone will have exactly the same
opportunity, it will rest entirely on an honest draw
ing, and in time every living group will be, or will
have been, represented on the Council."
"And the other 38?"
"In the same way they would select from among
themselves the chairmen for the various boards, dances,
carnivals, and what-nots that are such an integral
part of our college education. In order to eliminate
favoritism there would be a provision that no chair
man could appoint more than two assistants from his
own living group."
"It's almost Utopian, Emery. But what about clas*
affairs—would they come under Ex Committee, too?"
"In my system everything but the offices of A. S.
S. U. president and vice-president, which would re
main as now constituted, would come under Ex Com
mittee.
"The class idea, it seems to me. is definitely horse
and buggy, if not much more prehistoric. It be
longs in high school, where classes mean something.
You come to college and you join a house, or you live
in a hall, and your loyalties inevitably lie with your
organization. Classes as social entities hardly exist, at
all—except when you're a senior and sentimental, per
haps—and I wouldn't be averse to seeing them done
away with altogether.
"My whole idea would be to remove the possibility
of pre-election deals, a Hall-Row split, group jeal
ousies. They only interfere with efficient student gov
ernment, a thing we really need if we are to continue
to enioy the privileges we now have."
"What an idealist!" I said.
"Somebody has to be," he said; and although he
tried to be ironical about it, I got the distinct impres
sion that he was trying hard not to feel noble.
