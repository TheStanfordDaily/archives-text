I UTTING through the dead silcnce of early morn
ing. the Jong mournful notes of (he Firehouse
whistle stirred the sleeping campus. One long blast,
a pause, and then nine more: Encina was on fire.
By the time the fire department could be roused
into action, lower floor Encina crackled as a huge
bonfire. The central staircase was cut off: its four
story draft sucked the roaring flames up to lick the
base of the fifth floor. Side stairways were hopelessly
hot. Like small chimneys, they burned and smoked.
Perhaps it was incendiarism; no one knew.
Down the back walls of Encina's wings, frantic,
screaming freshmen attempted all at. once to crowd
down the too narrow fireladders. But the ladders were
too few, and the frosh were too many, and too anxious.
Heads were bashed; arms and legs broken; it was get
ting hot; they had to get out. Now, as the flames
reached the second, the third, and the fourth floors,
hundreds of freshmen—blinded with smoke, dizzy
with fear—knew that they were trapped. From the
windows they leaped in desperation. Some landed
luckily on the front lawn; more fell dead or uncon
scious on the Bull Pen cement, and the surrounding
roads. The fire department was there, helpless against
the giant furnace that was Encina.
As dawn broke, heaps of dead and mangled bodies
covered the ground. Encina still smoked. The na
tion's press was aghast at the tragedy; someone would
be held responsible. That did not help very much.
Now that may all sound very gruesome and very
fanciful. And someone will say it has never hap
pened. But it can happen. The plain fact is that
Encina Hall and the lives of 560 Farm students are
not adequately protected against fire. The plain fact
is that Fncina Hall does not even fulfill the legal
fire-escape requirements that a city like Palo Alto
demands.
