# Slaps, Cracks Enliven Plot Of 'Bluebeard'
## 
### 
"BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE":
Fox-Stanford:
With the new fad of men and
women battling each other on the
silver screen in full swing, Para
mount Studios issues to the waiting
public "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife," a
psychological as well as hand-to
hand battle between Gary Cooper,

a gallivanting fin
ancier, and Clau
dette Colbert, he
roine whose mind
is bent on true
marriage.
Cracks, the ma
jority of them
good, enliven the
plot, which speeds
on with Miss Col
bert forcing into
subjection her ad
versary and hus
band, Cooper.
An amusing se-

quence falls in the latter half of the
film v/hen Cooper, after reading
"The Taming of the Shrew," marches
to Miss Colbert's separate room in
the hopes of taming her. After hav
ing his slap returned, he leaves to
master more of the Petruchio tech
nique and returns to give Miss Col
bert the spanking of her life.
Sharing honors with Miss Colbert
is David Niven, Cooper's blank
faced secretary, and figuring little
in the plot, but exceedingly able, are
Herman Bing and Edward Everett
Horton. All in all, "Bluebeard's
Eighth Wife" is a lively and well
played movie.
The second feature, "Walking
down Broadway," is a mediocre sob
story concerrmg a year's adventure
of six Broadway chorus girls.
