## CRITICIZE THE CRITICS

The Editor, Sir:
The critical review by Miss Slater
of the performance of Fowler and
Tamara in Wednesday's Daily is
far more susceptible to criticism than
the performance itself. That the
presentation was not of the standard
of Trudi Schoop or the Ballet Russe
was presumably granted ahead of
time; that Mr. Fowler was not so
graceful as his partner was also ap
parent, though his role as a Spaniard
was rather well done.
But since the review is at present
under fire instead of its subject it
can be pointed out that we learn
nothing from it except that Miss
Slater did not like the program or
approve certain of its numbers.
There were many among the au
dience who agree with her, but a few
of us who thought it enjoyable are
still looking for intelligent criticism
and have not found it.
It is manifest that the headlines
were extravagant and in extraordi
narily bad taste. Several inane re
marks merely displayed lack of com
prehension of the mood or idea in
the dances, a delinquency exhibited
at various times by the rest of the
audience. Courtesy is expccted; ef
