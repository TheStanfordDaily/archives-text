The Editor, Sir:
In this day of controversy over
democracy vs. fascism, we have a
homely example on our own campus.
A decision was made to award five
dollars to the house having the high
est percentage of voters in the com
ing election. This not only makes
one wonder about the conditions of
Stanford politics, but would also
raise a question in one's mind about
that time-worn expression "loyalty."
Docs it not seem inconsistent to
believe that if one is not interested
enough in one's house to vote for
its candidate he would be interested
in gaining five dollars for the house
treasury? Of course, this argument
excludes the fact that if this same
plan was used in a public election,
with a slightly larger award, and an
equally "high pressure" political
unit, there would be a technical
term, such as intimidation, involved,
and that it might be known as
"warped politics."
According to the best democratic
standards this whole idea is prepos

terous; however, from the fasclstic
point of view there might be some
thing to say for it.
Sincerely,
â€”Perplexed
