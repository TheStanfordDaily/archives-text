### BILL MILLIS 
several days it has been in
creasingly evident that Japan
has over-reached herself, that her
armies are bogging-down along the
Yellow River front in North China.
Confirmation of this belief came
yesterday from a party of three
Americans, a journalist, explorer,
and marine corps officer, who ac
companied the Chinese forces un
der General Li Tsung-Jen in then
advance into Shantung province.
They reported that the Impe
rial Japanese army has suffered
one of the most humiliating de
feats in its history in a scries of
battles still continuing in South
Shantung province.
The cause of the Nipponese de
feat in the Taierhchwang area, which
is on the Tientsin-Pukow railway
north of Suchow, "unquestionably
was over-confidence," they report
ed. The present Chinese victories
were credited to the successful em
ployment of tactics of guerilla war
fare in cutting Japanese lines of
communication.

ation became more serious over
the week-end, with thousands of
trade unionists, Socialists, and

of Popular Front rule.
In a radio address the new pre

to take forceful measures to deal
with internal dissension and the
growing fear of a new coup by
Adolf Hitler. Aggravating his

ITERANCE'S tenuous political situ
ation became more serious over
the week-end, with thousands of
trade unionists, Socialists, and
Communists demonstrating in the
Paris streets yesterday after Radical
Socialist Edouard Daladier formed a
one-party cabinet, ending two years
of Popular Front rule.
In a radio address the new pre
mier said that he was determined
to take forceful measures to deal
with internal dissension and the
growing fear of a new coup by
Adolf Hitler. Aggravating his
problems was the spread of sit
down strikes until 70.000 workers
in 38 Paris factories arc now in
volved.
All of the key posts in the "lib
eral union" cabinet are held by the
(moderate republican Radical So
cialists, after Leon Blum's Socialists
refused to accept any of the five
posts offered to them. George Bon
net, former ambassador to Washing
ton who several weeks ago failed to
form a French cabinet, succeeds
pro - League of Nations Joseph
Paul-Boncour as foreign minister.
* * *
/ I LIMAXING what has been
4 termed the greatest propaganda
fanfare in modern times, Austria's
people rallied to the catch-words of
"One Reich, One People, One
Fuehrer" and yesterday voted 99.75
per cent endorsement of Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler's annexation of their
homeland.
Only one out of every 400 vot
ers risked putting a cross in the
"ncin" (no) circle of their bal
lots.
In a Berlin radio speech, Hitler
said "the results in Austria as well
as in the rest of the Reich surpass
all my expectations."
* Hi *
.'Demands for governmental econ
omy were voiced yesterday by Sen
ator Harry F. Byrd, of Virginia,
leader of the conservative Demo
cratic bloc, who denounced Presi
dent Roosevelt's tentative plans for
new priming of the arid business
"pump." Byrd protested against in
cxoa.s.'ng the federal deficit to an es
timated $0,000,000,000 for the coming
year, which he asserted would result
from the administration's plans to
pour another $4,000,000,000 into re
covery and relief projects.
House Republican Leader
liertrand 11. Snell. of New York,
also demanded that "run-away
federal spending" be stopped.

Summary — Administration lead
ers deniedrrepo ts that demands for
wages - hours legislation will be
abandoned at this session of Con
gress. Insurgent Navarrese col-
U'yns were reported to have crossed
the Segrc River on the central Cata
lan front and cut the main highways
leading to France and Barcelona.
Light earth tremors were reported
south of Toledo and Ciudad Real in
Loyalist Spain, but there were no
injuries.
several days it has been in
creasingly evident that Japan
has over-reached herself, that her
armies are bogging-down along the
Yellow River front in North China.
Confirmation of this belief came
yesterday from a party of three
Americans, a journalist, explorer,
and marine corps officer, who ac
companied the Chinese forces un
der General Li Tsung-Jen in then
advance into Shantung province.
They reported that the Impe
rial Japanese army has suffered
one of the most humiliating de
feats in its history in a scries of
battles still continuing in South
Shantung province.
The cause of the Nipponese de
feat in the Taierhchwang area, which
is on the Tientsin-Pukow railway
north of Suchow, "unquestionably
was over-confidence," they report
ed. The present Chinese victories
were credited to the successful em
ployment of tactics of guerilla war
fare in cutting Japanese lines of
communication.
