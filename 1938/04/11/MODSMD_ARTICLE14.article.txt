# Gallery Displays Willis Sketches
## 
### 
Sketches of scenes taken from all
over the world mark the exhibition
of water colors by Dr. Bailey Willis
of the University faculty, now on
display at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Since 1904, Dr. Willis has visited
in the Orient and Near East, and
has brought back a pictorial ac
count of his trips in his sketches.
Motor trips in this country have
furnished him with many ideas for
canvasses, as have scenes in and
around Stanford. Among the latter
is the painting of the Stanford
Woodpecker Oak, loaned by Mrs.
David Starr Jordan.
The watercolor work of Dr. Willis
is of a type known as aquarelle, a
process by which color is mixed by
diffusion on the paper rather than
by previous mixture. The exhibi
tion will remain at the gallery dur
ing the present month.
