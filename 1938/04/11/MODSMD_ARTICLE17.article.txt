## 
### 
Students and faculty men will
take off their coats and have an
afternoon of sports and bull-ses
sioning April 22, according to Dick
Riddell, whose committee of Axe
Society members is making arrange
ments for the student-faculty field
day to be held that afternoon on
the new intramural sports field.
Starting at 3:30 o'clock, the day's
program will include such active
games as sol'tball between various
teams of students and professors,
volley ball, and horseshoes.
Also such sedentary and semi
sedentary activities as checkers and
ping-pong will be offered.
Winding up the day will be a
barbecue, to be held at about 6
o'clock. Curt Eaton is in charge of
arrangements for the meal. '
It has been many years since an
affair of this kind was undertaken,
and it is being hailed as the begin
ning of a return of the traditional
informality between student and
professor.
