# Sick Opera Star Trills in Hospital
## 
### 
Patients at the Palo Alto
Hospital are Retting grand op
era along wtih their hypoder
mics and hot water bottles at
no extra charge this season.
Martin Lilienfeld, who has been
in the hospital since he suffered
several fractures when the
Salzburg Opera Guild was
presenting "Cosi Fan Tutte"
in the Memorial Theater, has
had to keep in practice by air
ing his lungs frequently.
At first he would, thanks to
his wheel chair, make these
personal appearances out on
the porch. Other inmates said,
however, that quality of voice
meant nothing to them. Good
tone or not, it was all just a
big racket to them. So now he
confines his recitals to the
ward where he furnishes class
ical. semi-classical, and request
numbers for his fellow inval
ids. He may continue to do so
for the rest of the year be
cause, while his injuries are
not serious, they arc slow in
healing.
