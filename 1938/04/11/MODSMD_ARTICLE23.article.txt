# Austria Heartily Endorses Union
## 
### 
VIENNA, April 10 (UP). â€”Aus-
tria's people today voted 99.75 per
cent endorsement of Fuehrer Adolf
Hitler's annexation of their home
land in a "reunion" plebiscite cli
maxing the greatest propaganda fan
fare in modern times.
Regardless of how many of them
might have felt at heart, only one
out of every 400 Austrians chose to
denounce Hitler's bloodless con
quest by putting a cross in the
"nein" (no) circle of their ballots.
After final returns were announced
shortly before midnight wild cele
brations turned Vienna's streets into
a bedlam.
