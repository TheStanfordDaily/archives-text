Amendment on Ballot
Riddell yesterday again called
attention to a constitutional amend
ment on Men's Council member
ship, to be voted on tomorrow. Th<?
amendment must receive a two
thirds majority of affirmative votes
to pass.
According to Riddell, the amend
ment is designed to open winter
quarter elections to competition
among juniors.
As now worded, the constitution,
by requiring a 120-unit qualification,
permits only seniors who are re

time to spare to seek council posts
at the mid-year election. The
amendment, by providing that mid
year candidates need only 105 units
at time of taking office, will open
the field to juniors.
Change Proposed
The present wording of the Men's
Council article is:
"Article 111, Section 2 — Men's
Council, Paragraph a—Membership:
'"The Men's Council shall consist
of five men who have completed 120
hours of University work at the time
of taking office."
On the ballot, the question will be:
"Shall Article 111, Section 2, Para
graph a of the A.S.S.U. constitution

"Section 2—Men's Council, a—
Membership:
"The Men's Council shall consist of
five men who shall, at the time of
taking office, have completed 120
units of University work if elected
