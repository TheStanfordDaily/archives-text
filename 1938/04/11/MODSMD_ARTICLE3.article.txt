# Excom Sets Home Drive Week Ahead
## Conflicting Dates Cause Change; Rice Resigns Post 
### 
Because of date conflicts, the an
nual Convalescent Home Drive was
set ahead one week by Ex Commit
tee late Friday when members were
polled by telephone. The main body
oi the drive will be held May 2
to G.
A second surprise announcement
relating to the drive was John Rice's
resignation yesterday from the post
of treasurer. Another appointment
has been made, according to Chair
man Bud Milligan, but this choice
is subject to Ex Committee's ap
proval.
Rice's Statement
Explaining his resignation, Rice
said last night:
"I have so much else to do this
quarter that I couldn't have given
the job my best efforts. It'd be bet
ter to give it to somebody who can
put in the work it deserves."
The revised schedule of events is
as follows:
April 22, Soph Carnival; May 2,
On-Campus Drive begins; May 3,
Labor Day, Barbecue; May 4, Bean
Day, Strawberry Brunch, Jolly-Up;
May 5, Tag Dyy; May 6, Junior
Water Carnival, Masque Ball.
Dates Conflict
Chief reason for the change of
drive dates, according to President
Tom Killefer, was that Peace Day
is April 27â€”the same date for
which Labor Day had been slated.
Since the Masque Ball was post
poned to May 6, it was necessary to
shift the Roble Formal, previously
scheduled for that date, to April 29.
The new schedule will be more
convenient for the Convalescent
Home, Killefer explained, since it
now comes at the first of the month
instead of the last.
Meanwhile, plans were made for
heads of all Drive committees to be
conducted through the Home to
morrow and Wednesday from 3 to 4
o'clock. Milligan stressed the ne
cessity for all chairmen to visit the
Home on one of these days.
