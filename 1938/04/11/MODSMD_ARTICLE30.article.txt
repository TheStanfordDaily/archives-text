# The 						Row Holds Its Pre-Election Caucus
## The 						A.O.Pis Were in House Meeting When the Phone Rang 
### 
The A.O. Pi's were in house meeting. They were in house meeting
because it was Monday night, though other houses on the Row had con
cluded their meetings early, dispatched delegates to the Ilow caucus being
held at the S.A.E. house.
The phone rang and one of the A.O. Pi's answered it. A voice on the
other end said:
"Are you for Lee or MtDuffle? If you're for Lee, send a delegate down
quick, or give me your proxy."
The message was relayed into the meeting. The president asked:

"Are we for Lee or are we for
McDuffie?"
"Some of us were for Lee and
some of us were lor McDuffie,' one
of the girls said the next day. "We
didn't think of having a show of
hands. But anyway we decided we
were for Lee and .sent a girl down."
A.O. Pi's Swing It
When the girl got there, Chairman
Collie Small, after a 15-14 McDuffie
vote, was trying and failing to con
vince vociferous Lee delegates that
there shouldn't be another vote. The
delegates filed up to the chairman's
desk to ballot again, the A.O. Pi's
presumably voting for Lee.
Secretary Powell Humphrey totted
up the X's with a worried look, then
shook his head, turned to Small and
said:
"Boy, this is bad."
Small announced the vote—Lee
IG, McDuffie 15.
Another Ilow Caucus
So, to all practical purposes, ended
another Row caucus, a little sloppier
than most, but fairly typical. Only
other high point was George Ditz's
nomination of Bill Hawkins for sen
ior class president.
"We had a hard time talking him
out of running for president," he said.
Behind the caucus were the usual
deals, somewhat more apparent than
usual; after it were quite unusual
developments.
Ahead was Bill Hawkins' dissatis
faction with the caucus, and his de
cision to run independently. Be
hind was the "Upper Row Caucus,"
the small house coalition, and the
Lower Row's decision to stick to
gether, including the temporary
healing of the Zete-Phi Delt schism.

The phone rang and one of the A.O. Pi's answered it. A voice on the
other end said:
"Are you for Lee or MtDuffle? If you're for Lee, send a delegate down
quick, or give me your proxy."
The message was relayed into the meeting. The president asked:

"Are we for Lee or are we for
McDuffie?"
"Some of us were for Lee and
some of us were lor McDuffie,' one
of the girls said the next day. "We
didn't think of having a show of
hands. But anyway we decided we
were for Lee and .sent a girl down."
A.O. Pi's Swing It
When the girl got there, Chairman
Collie Small, after a 15-14 McDuffie
vote, was trying and failing to con
vince vociferous Lee delegates that
there shouldn't be another vote. The
delegates filed up to the chairman's
desk to ballot again, the A.O. Pi's
presumably voting for Lee.
Secretary Powell Humphrey totted
up the X's with a worried look, then
shook his head, turned to Small and
said:
"Boy, this is bad."
Small announced the vote—Lee
IG, McDuffie 15.
Another Ilow Caucus
So, to all practical purposes, ended
another Row caucus, a little sloppier
than most, but fairly typical. Only
other high point was George Ditz's
nomination of Bill Hawkins for sen
ior class president.
"We had a hard time talking him
out of running for president," he said.
Behind the caucus were the usual
deals, somewhat more apparent than
usual; after it were quite unusual
developments.
Ahead was Bill Hawkins' dissatis
faction with the caucus, and his de
cision to run independently. Be
hind was the "Upper Row Caucus,"
the small house coalition, and the
Lower Row's decision to stick to
gether, including the temporary
healing of the Zete-Phi Delt schism.
