# Hope Binds Upper Row
## 
### 
Hanging tight to one end of the
see-saw was the so-called Upper
Row, a loose confederation held to
gether by geography, discontent, and
hope.
Consolidation of the Upper Row
front came late this year. Until
the day of the caucus there had
been no arrangement except be
tween individual houses, although
self - appointed politicians had
been circulating about trying to look
like the third conspirator in a Shake
spearean play.
Action finally came on the day
before the main caucus, when it be- ,
came obvious that the Lower Row
was going to back Phi Delt McDuffie,
and that Alpha Delt "Beebs" Lee was
to be scratched at the post.
Determined not to miss the gravy
train without at least running for it, i
the Alpha Delts called an Upper
Row caucus, and so Monday after- j
noon found some 50 men in the
Alpha Delt living room, throwing
cigarette stubs at the fireplace, and
trying to look either important or
disinterested.
Also present were observers from
half a dozen of the sororities. Roll
I call eliminated the sororities and
I several delegates who "couldn't
j speak for the house." There re
mained nine "official" delegations,
Phi Psi, Theta Xi, Fiji, A.T.0., Kappa
Sigma, Delt, Theta Chi, Delta Chi,
Alpha Delt.
After the traditional dramatic
whispering and weighted looks, the
caucus got under way in the best
musical comedy manner. Lee was
suggested for A.S.S.U. president
which amazed no one. Eyebrows
soared histrionically when Bud Mil

ligan had sent up a trial balloon, and
the nomination. Snickers showed
puzzled relief when Lee won by a
unanimous vote and the show got
back into the script.
Ryus Put Up
Another sudden departure from
the form-book marred the camara
derie of the caucus on the next bal
lot. The Delt delegation put up Dave
Ryus, D.U., for senior class presi
dent, indicating that the Delt-D.U.
axis was still in good working order.
Opposing Ryus was Roy Thomp
son, white hope of Kappa Sigma and
the listed price of Kappa Sigma sup
port. Vote was five to four for
Thompson, with worried Alpha Delts
throwing the deciding ballot.
Caucus Hobbles On
After that the caucus hobbled on,
operating with all the precision of a
roulette wheel. As each job came up,
two houses named their ball-car
riers, whispered their promises, and
crossed their fingers. Decisions de
pended largely on how much each
house thought it could trust each
other house. Nominations were
forged on an anvil of suspicion with
a hammer faith. Typical of the con
versations was, "You back our man
for junior class, and we'll stand with
you on Ex Committee."
Occasionally some delegation
would jump the trolley to vote the
wrong way, and hurt looks would
show that one more politician had
lost his faith in humanity.
Delegates Depart
As final selections came up, the
caucus gradually faded into nothing.
Delegations departed, having gotten
what they wanted and fulfilled their
voting obligations. On the last bal
lot interest rivaled that in an econ
lecture.
The caucus marked the point of
crystallization of the Upper Row

front. It created no marching army,
but it did succeed in forming a loose
entente. A delegate was sent to the
"small houses" caucus to offer gifts
and make deals. Negotiations were
opened with sororities and with
doubtful fraternities.
And so the Upper Row. went into
the caucus prepared to camp solidly
on one end of the see-saw. Each in
dividual house went in praying that
its allies would stand with it, and
wondering how in a world that made
pretensions to sanity it manager to
accumulate such allies.
