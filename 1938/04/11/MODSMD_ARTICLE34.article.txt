# Small Houses Seek Jobs
## 
### 
In preparation for the official How
caucus, six "small" houses joined
together in a pre-caucus meeting to
consider offers from both Lower and
Upper Row. Theirs was not so much
a hope for elective positions as for
appointments from the men whom
they would support.
Houses which .sent representatives

to the Alpha Sig house immediately
preceding 'he regular Row caucus
were Phi Kap, A.K.L., Theta Chi,
K.A., A.T.0., and the Alpha Sig. j
* Their support went eventually to i
the Jiower Row because it offered |
the srtiall houses more in appointive
positions, and for the same reason
that Collie Small was chairman of
the caucus —that it was held in the
S.A.E. house this year instead of
the Chi Psi house.
For, though Collie says that he
and his house were non-partisan,
more credible statements place him
as the go-between for the small
houses. He would deliver them for
the Lower Row in return for the
prominence of being chairman of the
caucus, and for one of the good ap
pointive jobs next year, or perhaps,
support for Interfraternity president.
Signed, Sealed
So they were signed, sealed, and
delivered. It was their support to
the Lower Row which made the vote
for A.S.S.U. presidential nominee go
first to McDuffie by balancing the
Upper Row force of the sororities.
But the Lower Row seemingly
forgot the sororities, or perhaps it
thought it had them sewed up. Up
per Row strategists, still amazed at
the effectiveness of their own meet
ing, went to work in the afternoon.
. Their way with the women also
was effective. The Dee Gee vote is
said to have switched twenty min
utes before the caucus began. And
the A.O. Pi got there in time.
"Boy, This Is Had!"
When she arrived, all the factors
in the situation coalesced. Had she
not arrived, the vote could have gone
the other way. Had the Upper Row
forgotten the sororities, it might have
gone the other way. Had McDuffie
been nominated probably the Zetes
