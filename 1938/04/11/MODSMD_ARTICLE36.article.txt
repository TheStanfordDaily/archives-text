# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### 
/ 'ERTAIN developments over the
week-end make necessary the
retraction of a certain statement in
Sideline Slants, and the substitu
tion of another.
The difference in the two state
ments is only a mile, and what's a
mile between friends? The first
statement named Ed Burrows the
best miier on the coast this year—a
prophecy that was in the realm of
possibility until Louis Zamperini of
U.S.C. toddled off a 4:13 mile at Cal
Saturday.
As far as that goes, it's still pos
sible that Burrows can heat the
Trojan, but there are conditioning
factors in the problem in addition
to the fact that 4:i:{ is slightly
fast.
For instance. Burrows ran a 9:32
two-mile Saturday, which puts
him right up there as at least an
even bet for the coast champion
ship in that event. Yes, yes, Sadaj
of Cal ran 9:29 Saturday, but he
didn't run a mile earlier in the
afternoon. And Burrows looked so
much like his old self who was a
sensation as a sophomore that he
earns a little extra consideration.
Zamperini might be better at the
two-mile than either the Card or
the Bear, but he's so good at the
mile that there's little chance Dean
Cromwell will throw away the op
portunity to take that event in the
conference meet by withdrawing
him in favor of the two-mile. Even
Zamperini couldn't hope to win both
events in the same afternoon, when
Burrows and Sadaj are around.
Burrows, incidentally, tore off
the grandest kick in that two-mile
that you'd ever want to see. His
last 220 yards was a perfect ex
ample of how to finish a two-mile
—he came in like. Old Dobbin go
ing to a fire, and Van Alstine of the
Bruins just stayed behind and
watched in awe.
Ed's time constitutes a new school
record, breaking the mark of 9:35.1
set by Hank Coe 10 years ago. He'll
do even better before the year is
out. t
Therefore, let it be said that Bur
rows may not be the best miler on
the coast, but when the season's over
(he general opinion will be that Bur
rows is the coast's best two-miler.
* * *
Stanford kid that look- j
ed pretty good Saturday was
Carl Mahurin, timed in 1:56.7 in the
880. Mahurin is far from the best I
of condition, but a bad foot slowed i
him down physically and mentally '
earlier in the season.
If he'll only get it in his head
that all he needs now to get his j
time down to something hot is a !
lot of work, he'll be pressing the
best of them before the season is j
over, llis is the prettiest stride j
you can imagine, and labels him !
as a potentially great half-miler.
Coach Templeton was slightly dis- !
appointed at his team's showing—he J
ihought the boys should have done ]
better, but he's not particularly I
broken-hearted about it. Zagar, who j
went unplaced in a meet for the j
first time in a long while, will get !
better, and Tom Montgomery is ca- ;
pable of better than 49 feet on most }
days. Stanford will have a track
team when it really counts this I
season.

pARL VICKERY of U.S.C., who
J allegedly had never lost a 220 !
low hurdle race in college varsity j
competition, can say he has lost one |
now. Old George Anderson of Cal. |
the champ they gave up for lost two i
years ago, showed there's some life |
in the old boy yet by beating the i
redhead in 23.7. It was Anderson's I
second hurdle race in competition, j
and Cal fans went slightly nutty over j
his showing.
On that criterion Stanford fans
should go a little nutty themselves, i
for Stan Hiserman ran his first hur- 1
die race in competition Saturday and I
was timed in 23.5. Stan has plenty j
to learn about hurdling yet, too—it |
begins to look as though he'll turn j
into a second Jack Weiershauser.

ship in that event. Yes, yes, Sadaj
of Cal ran 9:29 Saturday, but he
didn't run a mile earlier in the
afternoon. And Burrows looked so
much like his old self who was a
sensation as a sophomore that he
earns a little extra consideration.
Zamperini might be better at the
two-mile than either the Card or
the Bear, but he's so good at the
mile that there's little chance Dean
Cromwell will throw away the op
portunity to take that event in the
conference meet by withdrawing
him in favor of the two-mile. Even
Zamperini couldn't hope to win both
events in the same afternoon, when
Burrows and Sadaj are around.
Burrows, incidentally, tore off
the grandest kick in that two-mile
that you'd ever want to see. His
last 220 yards was a perfect ex
ample of how to finish a two-mile
—he came in like. Old Dobbin go
ing to a fire, and Van Alstine of the
Bruins just stayed behind and
watched in awe.
Ed's time constitutes a new school
record, breaking the mark of 9:35.1
set by Hank Coe 10 years ago. He'll
do even better before the year is
out. t
Therefore, let it be said that Bur
rows may not be the best miler on
the coast, but when the season's over
(he general opinion will be that Bur
rows is the coast's best two-miler.

earlier in the season.

Bruins just stayed behind and
watched in awe.
Ed's time constitutes a new school
record, breaking the mark of 9:35.1
set by Hank Coe 10 years ago. He'll
do even better before the year is
out. t
Therefore, let it be said that Bur
rows may not be the best miler on
the coast, but when the season's over
(he general opinion will be that Bur
rows is the coast's best two-miler.

Stanford kid that look- j
ed pretty good Saturday was
Carl Mahurin, timed in 1:56.7 in the
880. Mahurin is far from the best I
of condition, but a bad foot slowed i
him down physically and mentally '
earlier in the season.
If he'll only get it in his head
that all he needs now to get his j
time down to something hot is a !
lot of work, he'll be pressing the
best of them before the season is j
over, llis is the prettiest stride j
you can imagine, and labels him !
as a potentially great half-miler.
Coach Templeton was slightly dis- !
appointed at his team's showing—he J
ihought the boys should have done ]
better, but he's not particularly I
broken-hearted about it. Zagar, who j
went unplaced in a meet for the j
first time in a long while, will get !
better, and Tom Montgomery is ca- ;
pable of better than 49 feet on most }
days. Stanford will have a track
team when it really counts this I
season.

pARL VICKERY of U.S.C., who
J allegedly had never lost a 220 !
low hurdle race in college varsity j
competition, can say he has lost one |
now. Old George Anderson of Cal. |
the champ they gave up for lost two i
years ago, showed there's some life |
in the old boy yet by beating the i
redhead in 23.7. It was Anderson's I
second hurdle race in competition, j
and Cal fans went slightly nutty over j
his showing.
On that criterion Stanford fans
should go a little nutty themselves, i
for Stan Hiserman ran his first hur- 1
die race in competition Saturday and I
was timed in 23.5. Stan has plenty j
to learn about hurdling yet, too—it |
begins to look as though he'll turn j
into a second Jack Weiershauser.
