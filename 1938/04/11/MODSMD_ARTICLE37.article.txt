# Card Track Hopes Rise After Week-End
## Burrows Sets Mew School Two-mile Record as Indians Defeat U.C.L.A. 
### JERRY MAYER 
The Pacific Coast Conference southern division track situation is con
siderably clarified today- following last Saturday's- activities—Southern
California's overwhelming to 56 :1 4 victory over Gal, and Stanford's
77-54 »in over U.C.L.A.
This much seems certain, that Stanford has a good chance to defeat the
Hears in the Big Meet two weeks hence and that U.S.C. should shellack

►the Cards easily. However, the In
dians shouldn't have much troubli
with the Olympic Club next Satur
day on Angell Field.
Captain Ray Malott, Edson Bur
rows and "Stanford Stan" Hiser
man were the focal points of th<
Card attack last Saturday. Eucl
one of these men is counted oi
for two events against Cal, and the:
got in some practice against th<
Bruins.
Malott Wins
Malott romped through 47.3 an<
21.4 victories in the quarter-mil*
and furlong, respectively; Hisermai
won the 100 in 9.8 from Ucla's col
oi'ed Tom Berkley and then cam<
back to be timed in a 23.5 flight o;
low hurdles behind Berkley.
Considering the fact that "Stanforc
Stan" has only recently taken tc
the barrier event, his time wai
highly satisfactory to Coach Dink
Templeton. Berkley's winning time
of 23.3 is the best on the Coast this
season.
However, it was the lanky Bur
rows who stole the show for the
Cards. He coasted into an easy sec
ond place in the mile run behinei
teammate Rusty March, who won
in the slow time of 4:31.4, then came
back to set a new school mark in
the two-mile of 9:32.7.
Burrows Comes Through
The old mark of 9:35.1 was made
in 1928 by Hank Coe. Burrows was
running against Paul Van Alstine
Bruin captain and one of the lead
ing distance men on the coast last
yeai\ Ed stayed well behind the
Bruin for seven laps, but when the
gun sounded signifying the last lap
he really poured it on. Running fu
riously, he caught Van Alstine mid
way on the backstretch and won
going away by about 35 yards.
The only major upset of the day
occurred in the discus, when Pete
Zagar, Farm ace, fouled himself
out on the majority of his tosses and
failed to place. Woodrow Wilson
Strode, he of the Aelonic physique,
won the platter heave at 157 feet,
7% inches, but Hugh Gribbin of
Stanford, who is improving steadily,
was only a bare three inches be
hind him.
Strode Takes Shot
Strode also nabbed the shot with
a put of 51 feet, 4 inches, and Jack
Lipman beat Tom Montgomery for
the second straight week to take sec
ond. Lipman got off a 50-foot, 7-inch
toss.
Other standouts for Stanford were
Carl Mahurin, who won the 880 in
1:56.7 and Dick Simpson, who lost
to Bill Lacefield of the Bruin sepia
contingent by a mere six inches in
the speedy time of 14.7 in the high
hurdles. Simpson came over the
last hurdle even with Lacefield, but
the bespectacled Bruin just barely
beat him in a wild dash for the tape.
Vic Boore's 13 feet in the pole
vault and Russ Wulff's 6 feet, 3%
inches in the high jump completed
the list of Card winners.
