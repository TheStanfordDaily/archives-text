# Library Exhibits Opera Pictures
## 
### 
The Library is now exhibiting the
famous illustrations of the operas
collected by Morgan Gunst, who at
tended Stanford in 1905-06. Mr.
Gunst recently donated his entire
collection of pictures to the Univer
sity, together with three very rare
books of music, printed by private
subscription.
The pictures, printed in the last
part of the 19th century, when many
of the greatest composers were still
living, portray the composes' own
ideas of what the characters of their
operas should look like.
There are illustrations of scenes
from famous French, Italian, and
German operas, including Meyer
beers L Africaine" and Wagner's
"Ring."
