# Varsity Nine Upsets Cal In Series Opener
## 
### 
Facing California for the first time
this season Saturday on Edwards
Field, Berkeley, Stanford's varsity
horsehiders forgot all about past
records and previous performances
to play heads-up defensive ball and
come through in the pinches with
their stickwork as they set the high
i ly-touted Bears back on their heels
I with a 6-3 upset victory.
AI Lazzarone pitched brilliantly
I for the Indians, keeping ten Cali
| fornia hits well scattered, issuing no
j walks, and fanning three Bears.
| Lazzarone had the Bears shut out
with five bingles up to the seventh
inning when Cal scored its first run,
then added one in the eighth and
ninth.
The Indians went to work in the
second frame. DeWitt was safe on
Pitcher McNeil's error. Farrell
singled and Tam walked to fill the
bases. Bill Jameson slapped a single
through short to score deWitt and
! little Jimmy Coffis drove another
! timely one-base shot through the

same spot to send two more runs
across the plate.
Lazzarone helped win his own j
game in the next stanza when he I
singled, advanced to third on two I
fielder's choices and tallied on Tom
Killefer's hit to center. Dick Short
all slammed one of Priest's slants for
a triple to right field in the eighth,
scoring deWitt and Farrell with the
Cards' last two runs.
Friday, the stoi'y was a bit dif
ferent. "Lefty" John Carter of;
U.C.L.A. personally haneled the In-r
dians a 5-2 setback, letting them j
down with six scattered hits and
contributing a double and triple to j
lead the Bruins at bat.

States is the highest in the world.
