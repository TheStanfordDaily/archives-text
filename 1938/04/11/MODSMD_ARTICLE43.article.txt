# Farm Frosh Drop Opener To Cub Nine
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball team '
had an off-day Saturday over at !
Edwards Field, Berkeley,, and con- i
sequently dropped the opening;
game of the Cal series by an Bt2 j
count.
The Papooses didn't look like the I
same team that had previously taken
seven straight games, including four
via the shut-out route. "Cootie"
Thompson, hitherto unbeatable on
the mound, hit a wild streak and J
was touched for ten hits, and the i
usually dependable Papoose inlield i
committed five costly fielding bob
bles to spell defeat. '
The way Stanford started out, it I
looked like a rout for the Bearcubs. I
In the first inning, Elton Boone led j
off with a single and Monte Pl'yl j
sent him home with a triple. Thor
Peterson came through with a two- i
base blow to score Pfyl and give
the Papooses a 2-0 lead.
"Lefty'' Mike Koll handcuffed
them thereafter, however. For sev
en innings, he set the Papooses
down with no runs and no hits. In
the last frame, Pfyl and Peterson
hit successive singles to break the
ice, but they were left stranded on
the base lines.
