# Year 'Round Peace
## 
### 
ON April 27, Stanford will sit down and think
very hard about peace. It will think about
peace and economic boycotts, peace and arma
ments, peace and fascism, peace at any price,
peace as a flower that blooms in the spring,
tra-la. To make Stanford do all this, the mem
bers of the Peace Committee have been work
ing like little beavers to plan speeches, round
table forums, and anti-war posters on the
English corner.
But in spite of all their hard work, someone
is going to reward them by asking why the
committee doesn't get off the dime and do
something. Even if an accountant's record is
laid before them, showing in minutes and sec
onds the time spent on planning Peace Day,
they will still ask, "So what?"
That will be too bad, because the Peace Com
mittee may not deserve this slap in the face.
It is trying hard. But still someone will ask:
"So what?"
The fact is that one day is not enough to get
excited abot anything, not even such a nice
thing as peace. Even Darlene, the strip-tease
artist, knows that it takes a build-up to put her
act across.
Following this line of thought, Peace Day
should be the culmination, not the beginning
and the end of a peace movement. As it is,
Ihe work of the Committee, good or bad, just
doesn't make any difference. It is put in this
futile position by Stanford, itself.
Somehow the idea of a peace movement gets
tied up in conservative minds with street fights,
colored shirts, and long-haired idealists; and
that frightens Stanford. A Peace Day sounds
good on the records; it's safe, it's altruistic, and
best of all, it accomplishes nothing. And that
is precisely the distance which Stanford wants
io go.
But some day, when the campus really wants
'o buckle down to thinking about peace, the
Committee will find an all-year, instead of a
one-day, job on its hand.
Yet the Committee was created to promote
peace at Stanford, not to reflect campus apathy.
It might follow on its own the example of politi
cal parties (if it does not like that of Darlene),
which spread the good word between elections
by clam-bakes, dances, raffles, and games for
little people.
Instead of being content with a single day
of activity, it might schedule a round of clam
bakes, dances, raffles, and games for little
people. If Stanford's peace pill, administered
once a year, has no effects, perhaps a little
sugar coating will induce us to take it oftener.
If the Committee sincerely wishes to further
peace, such a year-'round program is inevitable.
Perhaps, even to justify doing their useless
best, the Committee should forget idealism for
a while and take a leaf from Tammany Hall.â€”
