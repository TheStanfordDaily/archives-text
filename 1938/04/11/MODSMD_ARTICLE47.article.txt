# Just Relax, Bud

IN the Campus Opinion column this morning,
a tearfully angry freshman sobs on the edi
tor's shoulder, frightened by that nasty beast,
Stanford politics.
His dreams lie at'his feet in brittle fragments
because he has found that we have politics
which differ from the shining ideal of his civics
text-book. He speaks of his non-fraternity
friends as though they were about to be exe
cuted, because he has discovered that Hall and
Row take opposite sides in elections.
And in his tantrums our freshman manages
lo look very foolish. Everybody knows that
Stanford politics are inefficient on an absolute
scale. Everybody knows that our elections do
not always pick the best men, and that the pre
election deals would be frowned on by the boy
scouts.
But our freshman will find that in comparison
with the wicked, vicious world where politics
are really dirty, Stanford is a fountain of virtue.
Ours is'a practical system. It is not the dream
of a luncheon club. It works.
At that Stanford politics is a game where we
don't play for keeps. Except for two weeks out
of the year tennis is more interesting.
And so we don't get excited or tearful. We
do what we can to improve the system, and
when we can't do anything we go canoeing.
Freshmen who take our little game seriously
make themselves miserable; and their agitated
squalls sound rather silly. We would suggest
that our freshman go take a stiff scotch and
soda. But we feel sure that he doesn't drink.â€”
