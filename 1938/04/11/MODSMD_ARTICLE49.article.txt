# BULL SESSION

### 
STATEMENT OF POLICY
Vt/HEN I read in The Daily that someone had of
fered $5 to the house which got the biggest vot
ing turnout Tuesday, I had a sinking feeling that it
might be Bellwether, forced at last to stoop to con
quer. The fact that I saw the next president of the
Associated Students—so he says—in Chapel yester
day trying hard to look saintly did nothing to make
me feel any better; but when I began to talk to him
after the service I realized at once I had done him a
great injustice. He seemed to be as annoyed as I
was.
"Of all the dirty businesses," he snapped, "that
takes the cake! It isn't enough to bring all sorts of
pressure to bear and pass out patronage, it's gotten to
the point where we actually bribe people!"
"It isn't as though people wree being bribed to
vote for a particular person, Bellwether."
"Come, come come! Don't be naive. Furthermore,
I'm willing to wager that, sort of thing is going on all
over this campus. It's a fine thing when all our noble
upholders of Stanford democracy start toadying around
passing out $5 bills, a fine thing indeed, I don't
think!"
"Well, I wouldn't stew about it too much, if I
were you. How's your campaign coming?"
"Much better than I ever dared think it would,
from what I hear. People are falling into line behind
me by the tens of thousands, and a new day for the
University is just around the corner."
"Are you going to the assembly tomorrow morn
ing?"
"I don't think I'll be able to make it."
"What? But you know what that means, don't you?
Non-appearance, automatic declination."
"Is that right?"
"It certainly is, Bellwether. What are you going to
do about it?"
"I told you. I'm not going."
"Then your name will be taken of! the ballot."
"It can be written in."
"But "
"If Election Board thinks it can throw me out
simply because I am unable to attend an assembly "
"It has a perfect right to, Emery. It's constitutional.
And you haven't any excuse."
"Hah! Constitutional! Appealing to the law be
cause they're scared to death of me! And as for not
having an excuse, I'd like to know who has a better
one. I shall consider it a distinctly shady piece of po
litical lollygagging if it's done; I might even demand
an investigation."
"No, Bellwether."
"Well, I don't see why not. The way I look at it,
I'm the only candidate running whose election would
n't make anybody unhappy. I like people to be happy,
therefore why should I withdi'aw? Besides, since I
couldn't serve anyway "
"You couldn't! But I thought ■"
" There are Reasons—my vote, if I got one,
would be either a gag or a good-natured protest
against whatever it is people want to protest against
—in this case the whole political racket, I suppose—
and certainly would have no effect on the ultimate
outcome. It all seems very logical to me."
"Yes, I suppose it would. But I doubt if it'll ap
peal to Election Board when you don't show up in
assembly."
"Oh, I know what they'll say. Bellwether doesn't
care. Bellwether doesn't think enough of Stanford
University to give one hour of his time to his fellow
students. Well, that isn't true. I warn you I shall
refuse to consider myself out of the running. And I
won't have to go around passing out $5 bills to get a
vote, either!"
With which confident statement he gave me a
hearty handshake, a brilliant if somewhat mechanical
smile, and hurried away.
