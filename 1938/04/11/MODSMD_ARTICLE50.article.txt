# GOIN' MY WAY

JOEFORE I ever came to Stanford the University
sent lots of bulletins, announcements, and just
plain publicity plugging the place. Particularly did
they play up the physical plant—with pictures, artists'
sketches, and architects' plans.
The whole thing seemed very delightful and photo
genic. I expected to be impressed after high school.
I thought it was going to be like a 9,000-acre garden.
Every ten minutes or so I expected to stop short what
ever I was doing, inhale deeply the salty peninsula air,
look all around with care and deliberation, then say
to myself, "This is the Stanfords' dream for their
children of the West. Lookie," I thought I'd continue
to myself, "There arc the rolling foothills. And here
are the 'more than twenty-four tennis courts.' My,
the polo team is picturesque. It's just like the movies.
And Memorial Hall with the amphitheater back of it.
Ah-h-h-h! What a quaint little green Daily Shack.
(Just like a kennel)."
It was like that all during the Pre-Reg period. It
was really a 9,000-acre garden. Then I *got so busy
working and playing and becoming part of the Uni
versity I never thought about it objectively any more.
The Farm was just as much of a garden as it's ever
been, but I wasn't artist enough to see it.
Then I happened to notice those etchings of the
Chapel on display with Albert Guerard's book in the
bookstore window last week. The Chapel never looked
that way to me before and it had been a long, long
time since it even approached looking like it.
The etchings of our sandstone and mosaic were to
someone looking at them in England, say, what etch
ings of Oxford's ivy and oak are to someone not in
England.
It's the old story about the grass being greener.
When we're here we look at the beauty through a haze
of winter quarter rain or spring quarter dust. Most
of the time we dog-trot through the Inner Quad wor
ried so stiff about an econ ex that we never even see
the clock towers.
We might try and see our garden through the maze
of petty, daily grievances as though we were going to
paint or describe it. We could all play artist just a
little more and notice, for instance, what an interest
ing jagged line those tall trees make out by Palm
Drive. The world is really awful pretty, and it's fun
to watch.
Only for Clod's sake let's stick to shorter hair-cuts.
