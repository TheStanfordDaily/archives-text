## '41 LOOKS AT FARM POLITICS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I'm just one of those little insig
nificant freshmen here 'and do not
know yet just how you all run
things around this school. During
the last few days, however, thexe
has been a lot of noise about elec
tions and after seeing what some
people have been doing to get their
man into office, I must say that
Stanford has the worst political set
up that I know of.
In other words, it STINKS. I came
to this school with a lot of high
ideas about the good fellowship that
a guy gets at Stanford and "if you '
see a Stanford man on the corner,
why pick him up and take him
where he wants to go."
'Harvard of West'
Stanford was the Harvard of the
West. That kind of gave me the idea
that at Stanford everything was more
or less reserved and stately. Living
in Encina cured me of all that but I
still had hopes until elections rolled
around.
Now I do not know what to think.
As far as politics are concerned I
do not have much U> look forward
to. In the first place, why should
there be a split between the Row
and the Halls? I have pledged one
of the houses and I do not see why
that should change my views toward
the fellows who are going Hall. I've
lived with them for almost three
quarters now and I get along swell
with them.
Out of Trenches
Does the fact that I have gone
Row and they have gone Hall mean
that we must get into a trench and
start firing away as soon as we
come back to school in the fall? As
far as we freshmen are concerned,
and I am talking for the whole
class of '41, we want to see the
best and most capable man put
into office—but no, we cannot, we
are di'awn into a feud that was
stalled by our fathei's and has grown
so old and dirty that after we get a
glimpse of it we would like to have
nothing to do with it.
We ax'e being dictated to by the
actives in our respective houses as
to whom to vote fox - , whether we
think he is the best man or not. No
matter what we think we must vote
Row, because we have been told
that the Hall men are a bunch of—
and all the time we know that they
are not because we are living with
them right now and we like them.
Wants Reform
I for one, and remember thex-e are
a lot of fellows who think as I do
on this point, want to see Stanfoi-d
politics lifted out of the mire and
put on a decent plane—a plane that
is clean enough for Stanford, and
not like the rest of the schools in
the counti*y have elections that are
just as dirty and as crooked as the
ones that we have here at Stanfoi'd.
To Hell with that 1 ai'gument! I,
like the rest of the students, came
here because I thought it was the
best school in the country, and be
cause I thought it would be dif—

ferent and on the plane above the
other colleges.
If we are like the other schools in
the courltry, as far as elections go,
let's get out of it- and clean the
thing up because it most certainly is
not to our credit. Let us take in the
good ideas that the schools have to
offer but for Heaven's sake keep
away from any new ideas ot
get a bunch of men to vote for*your
candidate!
