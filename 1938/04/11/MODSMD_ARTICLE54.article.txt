# Stanfordites Hear Pomona Glee Club
## 
### 
Under the vigorous direction *of
"Prof" Ralph Lyman, the Pomona
Glee Club turned in » sparkling,
masterly and colorful performance
Saturday night, fully worthy of their

position as South
west Champions.
Poised equilibri
um of parts, pur
ity of tone, smooth
transitions, rhyth
mic surety and
precise shadings j
all combined into j
a whole that was
en th usiastically
received by all 1

who attended.
The bass section was especially
full-toned and resonant, while the j
tenors, sharing honors, gave one the i
impression of mellow silver. The |
program was varied, selections |
ranging anywhere from thirteenth I
century plain song to such moderns j
as Oley Speaks and Palmgren.
Singing, partly with accompani- j
ment and partly "a capella,' the
Glee Club proved its versatility by
rendering with equal artistry the
serious numbers and the droll, witty
ones.
Sung with footlights lowered,
"Round-up Lullaby" captured all
the carefree, swinging abandon of
the life of the range rider. "The
Lord's Prayer" set to music by
Malotte-Deis was an example of
well-blended harmony and flowing
crescendo. "Sylvia" by Speaks
showed depth of feeling, while
"Northern Lights" by Palmgren was
unusual in its realistic discord.
"Tarantella," based on an ironic
poem by Hillaire Belloc, contrasted
the haunting, gypsy gayety of Spain
before the Revolution, with the
desolate ruin and ghostly relic of
the country as it is today.
A fitting conclusion to the pro
gram was several Pomona College
songs. The most notable was
"Torchbearers" by Bissell, exciting in
its aboriginal rhythm and wealth of
tradition. ,—Hiler.
