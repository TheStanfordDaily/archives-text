battle for New Deal objectives di

Y"ESTERDAY the President deliv
ered his long-awaited special
message to Congress on the sagging
railroad industry, urged that em
ergency financial relief be granted,
but expressed his opposition to
either federal subsidies or govern
ment ownership and operation of the

preventing serious bankruptcies
among a large number of railroad
companies, great and small," he
said.
Later, the President conferred
with Secretary of the Treasury
Henry Morgenthau, Jr., who, re
neging on his New York speech of
last November against further fed
eral pump priming, stressed the
gravity of the present crisis in this
country, and said:
"The situation is much worse
now than in February. It is such
that it calls for some kind of gov
ernment aid—but how it is going
to be done is up to the White
House to say."

idly-spreading strike wave has af
fected more than 150.000 workers,
shut down half of the heavy indus
tries in the Paris region, and para
lyzed the government's arms pre
paredness program on the very day
when Premier Edouard Daladier's
new "salvation" government took
office.
Franco's largest factory, the Re
nault plant, was closed when
35,000 workers struck. Three
other important armaments plants
were also affected by the wave of
sit-down strikes, which arc caus
ed more by political than eco
nomic aims. j

labor, conferred with trade union
leaders, while a cabinet "spokes
man said that ihe government is
seeking a peaceful evacuation "but
other measures will be considered
if negotiations fail."
