# 'Kind Lady' Props Lend Authenticity
## Peninsula Combed For Trees, Babies, Old English Furniture 
### AL ZELVER 
''We had an awful time getting
the stuff," was the wail of Prop
erty Manager Valerie Duane's staff
when asked about the props for the
Division of Speech and Drama's
forthcoming melodrama, "Kind
Lady," to be presented Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday in Memorial
Hall.
The property staff's job included
locating and collecting such ran
dom objects as a Christmas tree,
quantities of old English furniture,
and a baby.
Spring Christmas Tree
The Christmas tree presented the
biggest problem. The nearest tree
to be found in spring was in San
Francisco, so the staff had to go up,
trim the tree, and walk down the
street while august San Franciscans
looked on dismayed.
For the last Stanford play the
property staff furnished only an old
bundle of rags for a baby. This
time, however, special effort was
made to secure a Di-Dee doll of the
proper size and type to fill the ju
venile character's part.
Copies of El Greco and Whistler
have been made which are, accord
ing to members of the prop staff,
"much better than the originals."
They were made by projecting lan
tern slides and filling in the outlines
with crayons.
The White Horse Problem
A white horse meeting all requi
sites of the white horse called for in
"Kind Lady" was easily found, but
then it was feared it might be rec
ognized on the staff as a well
known whiskey. It took a whole
day to find another suitable horse.
"As you know," one of the prop
erty staff members declared, "all the
furniture had to be old English to
fit in with the set which is sup
posed to represent a paneled London
living-room. We spent a lot of time
looking around in 'Long Ago Land,'
a little antique shop in Mayfield."
The old fender that goes around
the fireplace "is supposed to have
come from some castle in England,
or Scotland, or someplace."
