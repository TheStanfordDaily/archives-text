# Trowbridge Grants Lot Improvement
## Date Set for Grading Of Encina Commons 
### 
Responding to requests of Inter
club Council, Assistant Comptroller
Alfred L. Trowbridge has announced
that improvements will be made on
the lot in front of Encina Commons.
Limited funds permit only scrap
ing and grading of the lot, according
to Mr. Trowbridge. But it will also
be possible to block off the area with
road barriers and signs to prevent
automobiles from cutting across the
ground.
This will permit the members of
the clubs located in the Commons to
use the field for baseball and other
games. The lot has been improved
several times in the past, but auto
mobiles have torn it up, making
games impossible. Clubmen have
repeatedly asked improvement.
The successful request of Interclub
representatives preceded that of Bill
Hawkins, candidate for the A.S.S.U.
presidency, by some two hours, ac
cording to Mr. Trowbridge. The club
delegates, he said, anlled on him,
asked his help, and secured his
promise to make improvements and
block off the field.
Hawkins, he says, called shortly
afterward, and left an almost identi
cal request with the secretary.
