SHANGHAI, April 11 (UP). â€”
Chinese troops, driving with all their
power to consolidate the greatest
military victory in their history, as
serted today that the fall of Vihsien,
on the central front, was imminent
and that Japanese troops were
withdrawing from their great base
at Tsinan 170 miles to the north.
Chinese field commanders report
ed that Japanese fleeing from Taier
hchow, just to the south, had joined
the Yihsien garrison and had barri
caded themselves in the walled town
for a death fight, despairing of es
cape or rescue because their lines of
communication to the north were
hopelessly cut.
