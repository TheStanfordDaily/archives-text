statements on their candidacies,
plans, and hopes in the event of
j election today.
The statements, alphabetically,
i are:
Hawkins, Zcte, independent ticket:
"My platform will be constructive
jin whatever is undertaken. I will
j endeavor to help the University in
I any way I can. In the conduct of
the various functions of the office I
; shall endeavor to do as in the past
| everything to pick the best man for
any job, regardless of political affil
iations; in general to give the Uni
versity a non-partisan effort in the
deportment of the office; and, in
particular, to see if a better lighting
system could not be initiated in the
reserve book room and to see if
the land directly in front of Encina
Commons could not be fenced off by
the University, so as to permit the
j club members the opportunity of
playing ball before and after lunch
without the difficulty of having au
tomobiles pass through the field."
Ilorton, Toro, Hall candidate:
"I believe that no one will dis
; pute my word when I say that the
! interest of the students in Stanford
j itself is nil. nl the old horse and
j buggy days, it was no trouble at all
to keep the students on the campus
and make them like it. In our ma
chine age, we find that we have the
daily or nightly race to the city,
highway, or by-way. What is the
! result to our University? Alumni
j activity and donations, the life
! blood of our campus, are constantly
declining. Maybe some day the
Stanford Farm will become a poor
i farm. The interest of the students
must be revived. For this I pro
pose a back-to-the-Farm move
ment, a new Stanford, based on the
structure of the old and activities
of the new."

in the light of future events, as
they occur."

Ilorton, Toro, Hall candidate:
"I believe that no one will dis
; pute my word when I say that the
! interest of the students in Stanford
j itself is nil. nl the old horse and
j buggy days, it was no trouble at all
to keep the students on the campus
and make them like it. In our ma
chine age, we find that we have the
daily or nightly race to the city,
highway, or by-way. What is the
! result to our University? Alumni
j activity and donations, the life
! blood of our campus, are constantly
declining. Maybe some day the
Stanford Farm will become a poor
i farm. The interest of the students
must be revived. For this I pro
pose a back-to-the-Farm move
ment, a new Stanford, based on the
structure of the old and activities
of the new."
Lee, Alpha Dclt, Row candidate:
"I don't believe in making defi
nite statements of policy at this

enough acquainted with the job to
make any such statements.
"I just hope, if elected, to carry
out a program which would be to
the best interests of the school. That,
program will have to be determined
in the light of future events, as
they occur."
