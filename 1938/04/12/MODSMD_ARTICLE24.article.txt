Rests on Women
Outcome of the election last night
generally was conceded to rest upon
the ballots cast by women voters,
particularly those of the Halls, who

have been "keyed up" over the
spring election for several weeks.
Polls will be open from 8:30 until
2 o'clock. The four balloting places
will be at the two corners of the
Engineering Building and the two
corners of the Romanic Languages
Building and, starting at Ihe upper
box, will be lettered A. B. C, and D.
Students whose names begin with
letters A through F will ballot at
Poll A; those with names beginning
with letters G through M will vote
at Poll B; those with names begin
ning N to S will vote at Poll C; and
others at Poll D.
"P R." Used
The preferential ballot will bo
used. Where two candidates are
seeking an office, first and second
choices can be made. Where more
than two are running, there must b<*
one less number of choices than the
number of candidates. However,
Election Chairman Dick Riddel 1
points out it is not compulsory to
make more than one choice.
At yesterday's assembly, Hawkins
explained why he entered the field
against a Row candidate, and al
though he is a Zete, seeking to suc
ceed two other Zetes, and said hi.s
aims will be to improve lighting in
the reserve hook room and to fence
the field in front of Encina Com
mons.
Horton asked for support of th"
Hall ticket as a whole, stressing that
.point rather than individual candi
dacy. Lee declared that he has not
been in politics, therefore has no
debts to pay.
