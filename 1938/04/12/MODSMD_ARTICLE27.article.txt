# AND THE HALL CAUCUS
## Hall Machine Goes Smoothly 
### 
In comparison with the Row, the
Halls last week ran their caucus
with well-greased smoothness.
In reality, there was no Hall cau
cus in the sense there was a Row
caucus. Instead there was a machine
into which names were fed by the
Interclub Council and from which
came the same names with the offi
cial Hall stamp.
The machine clanked only slightly
when Ed Darnett objected to the
presidential candidacy of Harry Hor
ton, declaring that there were only
two logical choices â€”John Dern and
Jack Calderwood. And that clank
was silenced by the oil of Jack Cal
derwood's declination.
Dern Nominated
Dern's name did not come up at
that time; it did come up two days
later to constitute the only threat to
the Hall's solid front.
From the time Toyon President
and Caucus Chairman Bill Lambert
rapped for order till the boys lined
up for the ice cream, Barnett's was
the only challenge to the pre-ar
ranged slate. Only a minor office
declination marred the near-perfect
score of Interclub Council.
Credit for this feat the Hallmen
give to these factors.
Interclub Council
1. There is no politically con
scious organization on the Row com
parable to Interclub Council. The
Council is made up of two men from
each eating club, one each from
Toyon and Branner independents,
four from Sequoia.
2. The Halls realized there was an
election coming sooner than did the
Row.
3. They had fewer available can
didates.
Elections came up in an Interclub
meeting last quarter when the boys
were discussing last night's exchange
dinner with Lagunita. The dinner
was made a frank part of the cam
paign and it was agreed to pick a
tentative slate at the first meeting
of this quarter.
Gripes Ironed Out
Small differences were ironed out
in informal bull sessions before the
meeting, but Hallmen swear the
ticket shaped up almost by itself,
and that disagreements were negli
gible.
Harmony may have been achieved
partly by the success of Harvey
Rothschild in getting some of his in
dependents (non-club members) on
the slate. Rothschild perennially
pleads this suppressed minority, usu
ally without success. This year there
are three independents receiving
Hall backing.
The caucus closed joyfully as ru
mens began to seep in that Bill Haw
kins was going to run independently.
