Dern Speaks
At G o'clock, after it had been
j confirmed that the nomination had
i been turned in, Dern told The Daily
ihe would announce later whether
; he was in or out.
At 7:30 o'clock, in a second-floor

■ Caldex-wood met with Lagunita and
Union leaders who expressed pref

i ton would retire.
Dern Declines
At 11:45 o'clock, Klauber and
Calderwood announced that Dern
I would decline.
Friends who believed Dern would
( be a stronger candidate than Hort
ton, especially with Hawkins making
a strong bid for Hall support, caused
f the day-long confusion, it was found
I later. Harvey Rothschild started the
nominating petition on its way,
others spent the day and most of
the night trying to convince Dem
he should run.
His decision to retire, friends say,
was based on these points:
Why He Declined
1. As a second-year grad he had
too much school work, and was not
so interested as when he ran a vear
ago.
2. At such a late date, he felt he
; had no better chance than Horton.
Perhaps also a deciding factor was
I the personal friendship of Dern and
Horton.

office who had, Hallmen say. agreed
