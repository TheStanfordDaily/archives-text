# Deanna Clicks In New Show
## 'Mud About Music' Has Tuneful Songs 
### 
The light and airy story of "Mad
About Music," the fine work of the
supporting cast, and the tuneful
songs make a splendid background
for the vital personality of Deanna
Durbin. She romps through the pic
ture so naturally that I could forget
that I was watching acting and give
myself up to the pleasure of watch
ing Deanna triumph over her jealous
and spiteful schoolmate.
The young singer portrays the
daughter of a movie actress. She
hits been sent to a school in Switzer
land in order that her mother's fans
may not know that their glamorous
heroine is the mother of an almost
grown daughter. Being in need of
parental love, yet not being able to
talk about her mother, the young
girl invents a father who is an ex
plorer.
When it comes to a show-down
and she must produce a father, she
chooses the nicest-looking man to
debark from the continental express
when it stops at the local station.
The resulting events are sometimes
humorous, sometimes pathetic, and
always entertaining.
Deanna sing:; with her usual vi
vacity and beauty "I Love to Whis
tle," il Chapel Bells," and "Serenade
to the Stars." Herbert Marshall
makes an excellent "surprise fa
ther," entering into the spirit of
light comedy with great aplomb.
Marcia Mae Jones adds another to
her list of excellent portrayals, while
Jackie Moran gives an outstanding
performance as Deanna's bashful
young admirer.
Sharing the bill this week at the
Stanford is "Midnight Intruder,"
which is an above-average "pro
gram" picture. It concerns the plight
of a young man who breaks into a
house and is mistaken for the way
ward son of the absent family.
