# Student Work Below Capacity Cautions Dean
## Women's Head Says Activities Detract From Development 
### 
"In too many individual cases the
record of undergraduate students at
Stanford does not correspond to the
student's capacity," warns Dean ol
Women Mary Yost in her annual
report to President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and the Board of Trustees.
Primary reasons for "poor and
mediocre work'' are listed by Dean
Yost as poor preparation for work
here in respect to methods of study
and ability to read rapidly and ef
fectively, vague ideas of why stu
dents want a college education, and
what they expect to get from it.
Poor criteria for the selection of
/courses, "too much emphasis on
the social values of college life," and
"too much time and energy spent
on so-called student activities," are
also listed as major causes by the
dean of women.
"That these findings in large
measure are correct for the men as
well as for the women makes them
a serious concern of the Univer
sity," she says.
Activities Detract
Miss Yost finds that student activ
ities detract from "full intellectual
development" of the student, and
therefore advocates restriction of
such activity.
"While we have been able, through
our work with the individual stu
dents, to have many understand
[themselves and their adjustment to
(he academic and environmental
life of the campus better and, there
lore to improve their work, we have
come to realize, the group pressures
I hey are subject to, especially from
the organized activities of the stu
dents, which definitely detract from
the probability of their gaining their
most fruitful intellectual develop
imerit.' is her conclusion.

"Although we appreciate the po
tential educational value of many
I student enterprises, we believe the
I time has come when their rapid in
j crease in numbers and the growing
tendency to extend their interests
and activities beyond the campus
should be taken note of.
"We may offer the most fruitful
curriculum, we may use the most
I intelligent methods in our teaching,
but these may be counteracted in an
appreciable measure by influences
in the environment," Miss Yost de
clares.

today.
"In too many individual cases the
record of undergraduate students at
Stanford does not correspond to the
student's capacity," warns Dean ol
Women Mary Yost in her annual
report to President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and the Board of Trustees.
Primary reasons for "poor and
mediocre work'' are listed by Dean
Yost as poor preparation for work
here in respect to methods of study
and ability to read rapidly and ef
fectively, vague ideas of why stu
dents want a college education, and
what they expect to get from it.
Poor criteria for the selection of
/courses, "too much emphasis on
the social values of college life," and
"too much time and energy spent
on so-called student activities," are
also listed as major causes by the
dean of women.
"That these findings in large
measure are correct for the men as
well as for the women makes them
a serious concern of the Univer
sity," she says.
Activities Detract
Miss Yost finds that student activ
ities detract from "full intellectual
development" of the student, and
therefore advocates restriction of
such activity.
"While we have been able, through
our work with the individual stu
dents, to have many understand
[themselves and their adjustment to
(he academic and environmental
life of the campus better and, there
lore to improve their work, we have
come to realize, the group pressures
I hey are subject to, especially from
the organized activities of the stu
dents, which definitely detract from
the probability of their gaining their
most fruitful intellectual develop
imerit.' is her conclusion.
Appreciates Value
"Although we appreciate the po
tential educational value of many
I student enterprises, we believe the
I time has come when their rapid in
j crease in numbers and the growing
tendency to extend their interests
and activities beyond the campus
should be taken note of.
"We may offer the most fruitful
curriculum, we may use the most
I intelligent methods in our teaching,
but these may be counteracted in an
appreciable measure by influences
in the environment," Miss Yost de
clares.
