r JPHE freshman golf team lost a
match Saturday, and thereby
hangs something of profound inter
est.
It seems that Menlo J. C. golfers,
paced by a lad who knows his golf
courses, Charles "Bud" Finger,
nosed out the frosh, 5-4, even
though they won only one of three
matches. The point scoring gives
three points per match, and the
Menlans won one match 3-0 and got
a point in each of the others.
Hut that's not the story. The
loss by the frosh is the first in at
least five years, and possibly more.
H.A.C. records go back to 1933-34,
and then sulTer a lap-.e of two
years. To that time, however, the
records show that in 1935-36 the
Stanford freshmen tied the Cal
frosh and Monterey High School,
and San Mateo Junior College in
1934-35.
There were no defeats recorded
in that period beginning with the
records of 1933-34. There were 17
matches played previous to this
year, and there have been three or
four played this season.
All in all, Coach Eddie Twiggs has
been doing pretty well with the golf
squad. Maybe Stanford has some
thing there.

JZEEPING a baseball scorebook is
all right in its way, but you have
1o be careful in a diplomatic way
about how you credit or discredit
ihe players.
For instance, Jimmy CofFis was
credited with a home run in the
U.C.L.A. game last Friday—he slam
med one to deep center field and
Hal Hirshon, husky Bruin, made a
dive for it and came up with a
mouthful of grass and little else.
From where the scorer was sitting
it looked as though Hirshon had
failed to reach the ball altogether,
but those higher in the stands
thought he had deflected the ball
slightly.
The scorer had to decide wheth
er it was one-base hit and a home
run on an error, or a straight home
run. The smart thing to do, it
turned out, was for the scorer to
call it as he saw it and give CofTis
a homer and Hirshon no error. In
that way everybody is happy and
the game doe.-n't look too bad on
the records—except for the pitcher
who yielded the hit.
But there was another case that
was just turnabout, in the same
game. Glenn Hamilton came to bat
for Spike Furman in the ninth inn
ing, and he grooved a fast one to
Shortstop Kenny Washington.
There was a man on second, and
by the time Washington had fielded
the ball, deep in the shorlpatch, the
man on second had reached third
and threatened to score. Hamilton,
meanwhile, was fanning the dust
down to first.
Washington, a nifty fielder in
any man's league, incidentally,
came up with the ball without any
trouble, but he was afraid to
throw to first in a try for Hamil
ton for fear the man on third
would go home. So he just held
the ball, Hamilton was safe, and
the man stayed on third.
The scorer gave Washington an
error for failing to complete the
play, and in that he erred diplo
matically, for it deprived Hamilton
of a hit and didn't do Washington's
reputation any good.
There is a big point in dispute
there—some scorers say lhat while
Ihe error was one of omission,
rather than one of commission, there
is no place in the book for an error
of omission, and Washington should
be exonerated in the play. How
ever, there is another school of
thought which argues that Washing
ton failed to take advantage of an
opportunity to put a man out at
first and possibly score a double
play, first to home.
In line with this is the argu
ment that if it is no error to catch
a ball and then fail to complete a
play, a player could field a ball
and then let everyone on base
score, without harm to his repu
tation as a baseball player; as far
as the scorebook is concerned.
It's all very involved, but that
doesn't take anything away from the
fact that Hamilton, a pinch-hitter,
hit the ball soundly and that Wash
ington fielded it nicely. Only the
scorer wasn't diplomatic.

records show that in 1935-36 the

frosh and Monterey High School,

1934-35.
There were no defeats recorded

JZEEPING a baseball scorebook is
all right in its way, but you have
1o be careful in a diplomatic way
about how you credit or discredit
ihe players.
For instance, Jimmy CofFis was
credited with a home run in the
U.C.L.A. game last Friday—he slam
med one to deep center field and
Hal Hirshon, husky Bruin, made a
dive for it and came up with a
mouthful of grass and little else.
From where the scorer was sitting
it looked as though Hirshon had
failed to reach the ball altogether,
but those higher in the stands
thought he had deflected the ball
slightly.
The scorer had to decide wheth
er it was one-base hit and a home
run on an error, or a straight home
run. The smart thing to do, it
turned out, was for the scorer to
call it as he saw it and give CofTis
a homer and Hirshon no error. In
that way everybody is happy and
the game doe.-n't look too bad on
the records—except for the pitcher
who yielded the hit.
But there was another case that
was just turnabout, in the same
game. Glenn Hamilton came to bat
for Spike Furman in the ninth inn
ing, and he grooved a fast one to
Shortstop Kenny Washington.
There was a man on second, and
by the time Washington had fielded
the ball, deep in the shorlpatch, the
man on second had reached third
and threatened to score. Hamilton,
meanwhile, was fanning the dust
down to first.
Washington, a nifty fielder in
any man's league, incidentally,
came up with the ball without any
trouble, but he was afraid to
throw to first in a try for Hamil
ton for fear the man on third
would go home. So he just held
the ball, Hamilton was safe, and
the man stayed on third.
The scorer gave Washington an
error for failing to complete the
play, and in that he erred diplo
matically, for it deprived Hamilton
of a hit and didn't do Washington's
reputation any good.
There is a big point in dispute
there—some scorers say lhat while
Ihe error was one of omission,
rather than one of commission, there
is no place in the book for an error
of omission, and Washington should
be exonerated in the play. How
ever, there is another school of
thought which argues that Washing
ton failed to take advantage of an
opportunity to put a man out at
first and possibly score a double
play, first to home.
In line with this is the argu
ment that if it is no error to catch
a ball and then fail to complete a
play, a player could field a ball
and then let everyone on base
score, without harm to his repu
tation as a baseball player; as far
as the scorebook is concerned.
It's all very involved, but that
doesn't take anything away from the
fact that Hamilton, a pinch-hitter,
hit the ball soundly and that Wash
ington fielded it nicely. Only the
scorer wasn't diplomatic.

been doing pretty well with the golf
squad. Maybe Stanford has some
thing there.

JZEEPING a baseball scorebook is
all right in its way, but you have
1o be careful in a diplomatic way
about how you credit or discredit
ihe players.
For instance, Jimmy CofFis was
credited with a home run in the
U.C.L.A. game last Friday—he slam
med one to deep center field and
Hal Hirshon, husky Bruin, made a
dive for it and came up with a
mouthful of grass and little else.
From where the scorer was sitting
it looked as though Hirshon had
failed to reach the ball altogether,
but those higher in the stands
thought he had deflected the ball
slightly.
The scorer had to decide wheth
er it was one-base hit and a home
run on an error, or a straight home
run. The smart thing to do, it
turned out, was for the scorer to
call it as he saw it and give CofTis
a homer and Hirshon no error. In
that way everybody is happy and
the game doe.-n't look too bad on
the records—except for the pitcher
who yielded the hit.
But there was another case that
was just turnabout, in the same
game. Glenn Hamilton came to bat
for Spike Furman in the ninth inn
ing, and he grooved a fast one to
Shortstop Kenny Washington.
There was a man on second, and
by the time Washington had fielded
the ball, deep in the shorlpatch, the
man on second had reached third
and threatened to score. Hamilton,
meanwhile, was fanning the dust
down to first.
Washington, a nifty fielder in
any man's league, incidentally,
came up with the ball without any
trouble, but he was afraid to
throw to first in a try for Hamil
ton for fear the man on third
would go home. So he just held
the ball, Hamilton was safe, and
the man stayed on third.
The scorer gave Washington an
error for failing to complete the
play, and in that he erred diplo
matically, for it deprived Hamilton
of a hit and didn't do Washington's
reputation any good.
There is a big point in dispute
there—some scorers say lhat while
Ihe error was one of omission,
rather than one of commission, there
is no place in the book for an error
of omission, and Washington should
be exonerated in the play. How
ever, there is another school of
thought which argues that Washing
ton failed to take advantage of an
opportunity to put a man out at
first and possibly score a double
play, first to home.
In line with this is the argu
ment that if it is no error to catch
a ball and then fail to complete a
play, a player could field a ball
and then let everyone on base
score, without harm to his repu
tation as a baseball player; as far
as the scorebook is concerned.
It's all very involved, but that
doesn't take anything away from the
fact that Hamilton, a pinch-hitter,
hit the ball soundly and that Wash
ington fielded it nicely. Only the
scorer wasn't diplomatic.
