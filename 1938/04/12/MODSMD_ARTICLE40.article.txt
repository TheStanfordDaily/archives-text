Santa Clara 01020010 0— 4
Stanford's varsity baseballers
went on their first hitting spree of
the season yesterday at Santa Clara
as they pOunded four Bronco pitch
ers for 16 hits to take the rubber
game of the Bronc series by a 1(3-4
count.
Glenn Hamilton, pitching the full
game for the Indians, kept ten
Santa Clara hits well scattered al
lowing four runs and fanning eight
Bronc batters. Hamilton also led
the team at the plate, collecting
three hits, including a triple and a
home run.
Opens with Hurst
Stanford opened up in the first
inning with a five-run outburst
that sent starting pitcher Ruddy of
Santa Clara to the showers before
he had retired one man. The Cards
added five more tallies in the sixth
frame, and staged three-run ral
lies in the fourth and eighth to ac
count for all their scoring.
Bill Clark slammed a homer in
the fourth inning with three mates
aboard and Case of Santa Clara
collected a round tripper with the
bases empty. Dick Tam, with two
triples in five trips to the plate, sent
four Stanford runs across the plate.
