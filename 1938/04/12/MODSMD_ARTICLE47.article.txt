## 
### 
Freddie Van Dyke, the Stockton Olympic Club's great little hack
stroke swimmer, defeated Stanford's Bill Weeden in a special match race
yesterday in record-breaking time to hand the Indian frosh his first
defeat of his short collegiate career.
Van Dyke swam the 150-yard distance in 1:41 (lat to capture Weeden's
(coast and pool records. Weeden was swimming as an added entry in

j the regular Stockton-Stanford var
sity meet which Stanford won 51-24.
The Wright brothers and Van
Dyke surprised by making a fast
I meet out of what looked to be a
dull hangover from the Big Swim
of last Saturday. Dick Clarke won
the 50-yard free-style in the good
time of :24.8 and won the hundred
; in 56.5 to become the only double
| winner of the day. Jack Vibert,
> Card sprint ace, failed to put in an
J appearance.
Win Needham and Dave Rider al
ternated first and second in the 220
and 440 coasting in to victories in
both events.
Weeden was coming up strong at
! the end of the back-stroke grind,
I but caught an arm in the ropes in
the last five yards. As it was, Van
Dyke won by an eyelash.
