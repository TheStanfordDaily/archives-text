## Thornhill Forms Two Squads; Dozen Men Still Due on Field 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Despite the fact that over a dozen
:of Tiny Thornhill's best prospects
have yet to report for spring train-
I ing, at least two teams have already
; been fashioned which, on paper,
| iook to be stronger than anything
| developed on the Farm since the
j reign of the Vowing Sophs.
In a short scrimmage yesterday,
I most of the men who saw action
j last Thursday were held out to al
low two other elevens a chance to I
perform. What could easily be a
first string has a line composed of j
Higginbotham and McElroy at ends, i
By West and Corky Donahue at |
tackles, Bob Dakan and Dick Sutton '
at guards, and Tony Calvelli at ;
center.
Higginbotham is playing left end i
at present, but Jack Clark hasn't j
come out yet and Bill Willard has j
been jogging around for a week ■
trying to shake a slight leg injury.
Pete Zagar and Stan Anderson are
the incumbent first-str-ing tackles
now juggling the weights for Dink
Templeton, but the defensive work
of Donahue and West in practice
will make it extremely difficult for
them to get back into the line-up.
The dream backfield of Pete Fay
at left half, Jim Groves at right
half, Norm Standlce at full, and
Freddie Ledeboer at quarter hasn't
a noticeable advantage over one
composed of Gene Coldiron at
quarter, Bill Kirsch at right half,
Ledeboer at full, and Moon Mullins
at left half. And these leave out
Hamp Pool and Bill Paulman.
