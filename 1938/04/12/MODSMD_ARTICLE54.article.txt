# Say It with Flowers
## 
### 
AN interesting announcement came from Of
ficer George Burns of the University police
force yesterday. Picking campus flowers, Burns
said, is prohibited.
On election day, it seems to us, that an
nouncement is particularly pertinent. On elec
tion day, there is nothing that one's soul yearns
for so much as a quiet afternoon of flower
picking.
And now that is taken away from us. Of
course, we may never have had the right to
pick flowers on the campus; in fact, we never
tried to pick flowers on the campus. But we
were saving that for election day. So that sense
of loss, justified or not, still remains.
We should write an editorial about the elec
tion today. The campus populace should be
exhorted to get out there and vote. It should
be told about the duties of citizenship and the
intricacies of marking the preferential ballot.
Democracy, we should say, must be maintained
at all costs, even to the extent of taking one's
student body card with him, finding at which
poll one may vote, and using a pen, not a pencil,
to mark the ticket.
Or perhaps there should be an editorial on
ihe campaign itself. Caucuses, we might thun
der fairly loudly, must go. Or, caucuses must
have definite rules of procedure.
Or we might remark that distributing hand
bills for a single candidate is bad taste according
the Frosh Handbook. Yet there is no stigma
attached to distributing party tickets, and one
man party might qualify. Or we might say there
is nothing much can be done by an A.S.S.U.
president about the city - ward trend of the
younger generation. Or that no planned pro
gram would seem to indicate a lack of interest
:n an administrative position.
But that would require long and deep thought,
and we can't spare time from our grief about
ihe flowers. There is only one thing that con
soles us. Even on election day, we believe it
is still permitted to smell the flowers.
Move over, Ferdinand.
