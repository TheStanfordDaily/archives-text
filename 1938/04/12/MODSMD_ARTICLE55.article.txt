# Don't You Like Games?

### 
YESTERDAY we dismissed a bit curtly the
sad little wail of a freshman terrified by his
first glimpse of Stanford politics. This morning
a knightly champion for the dolorous frosh rides
through the Campus Opinion column.
We are not surprised. There are many like
the champion who feel that when a thing isn't
perfect we should swear at it with all the
nasty words we learned in the alley, congratu
late ourselves for being so forceful, and refuse
thereafter to dirty our hands with it.
The champion says, "If politics is only a
'game,' why don't we do away with the whole
business?" Well, why don't we?
If there were no politics, life at Stanford would
be a beautiful fairy tale. There would be no
elections to bruise the tender ideals of fresh
men. There would be no politicians slithering
about, trying to hold halos over their heads
without letting their hands show.
There would be no Ex Committee blundering
and thundering on Tuesday nights. The faculty
would run the University quietly, efficiently,
cleanly.
We could make all that come true simply by
abolishing politics. We could make Stanford
government into a benevolent despotism that
would rival the Kingdom of Heaven.
And we would turn out graduates fitted, as
far as practical experience goes, to live only in
the Kingdom of Heaven.
Our present system has appallingly bad fea
tures. It also has one great virtue. It is realistic.
It makes no attempt to paint over the ugly spots
of democracy.
And because of that, it manages to give us a
slight idea of what democracy is like in practice,
not what it is like lovingly enshrined in a
text-book. Our system permits us to experi
ment with a democratic self-government that

resembles somewhat the government we will
find when we get out of college.
We can improve the system. We are doing
that, and because it is a discouraging business,
we refuse to take it so seriously that it upsets
our digestion.
And if the disillusioned don't like it, there
is nothing they can do but wait patiently for
their turn to go to Heaven.â€”J. C.
