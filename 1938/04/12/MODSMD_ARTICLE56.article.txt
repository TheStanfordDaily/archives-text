GREAT DAY
| HAVE been expecting Emery Bellwether to an
nounce his withdrawal as a candidate for presi
dent of the Associated Students any day now, but
when he came into the Shack last night I saw that
my hopes had been groundless. He had never looked
more the happy office-seeker.
"Look me over," he said expansively. '"Look me
over!"
"I am," I said. "I am, and I can't say I'm exactly
impressed."
"You ought to be. The next pi'esident of the Asso
ciated Students, standing right before you."
"No, Bellwether."
"Nonsense! I'm a cinch. Of course, I will admit
I'm going to be running under somewhat of a handi
cap, but I'm not letting it bother me."
"Well, that shows something, I suppose. Gall,
probably."
"Of course, I realize I might just possibly "
"What?"
"I mean —it happens to the best of men occasionally,
you know. It's not a disgrace to be beaten—exactly.
I mean, I always say somebody has to be, don't you?"
"If you had any brains you'd withdraw."
"Well, to tell the truth, I have considered it, but
it's really too late now. My campaign seems to have
gotten a little out of hand. I couldn't withdraw with
out looking rather silly."
"Without! This false pride is scarcely like you,
Bellwether."
"I know, I know. Either I'm convinced I'm right,
or I know I'm wrong; and I always act accordingly.
As though I were right, that is. But this is a special
case. I have a certain prestige to maintain. But, as I
say, if I should—er—fail to come through, I don't
know that I'd mind so much. After all. Politics.
What are they?"
"Frankly, Bellwether, I think this is rationaliza
tion."
"What I say is, what difference does it make, so
long as people vote? Perhaps they won't elect the
best man—that's me—but at least they'll be voting,
and not acting like a bunch of dead-heads the way
they usually do."
"Well, Bellwether, I'm disappointed. I thought
you'd stick to your game. The only really independ
ent candidate in the race, and now you want to
chicken out."
He leaped to his feet and started pacing up and
down, waving his arms as though he were haranguing
a revival meeting.
"Listen, you!" he said. "I'll have you know I'm in
this race to the bitter end, see, the bitter end! You
don't get Bellwether out until you blast him out with
dynamite! I was just telling you I could take it if I
got beaten, but I'll have you know I'm in this thing
for the duration of the war!"
He had the grace to look sheepish when we all
cheered.
