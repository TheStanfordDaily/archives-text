# GOIN' MY WAY

1 WAS reminded by the crowd on the Row about 2:30
Saturday night that this was open season in San
Francisco. If you go up, you might find something
to interest you in the following round-up of current
entertainment.
The theaters are in full swing with "You Can't Take
It With You" playing its third, and probably last,
week at the Geary Theater. This Kaufman-Hart win
ner, as you probably know alx-eady, is about as crazy
and lovable a family as has gi'aced this earth in these
perilous times. In fact, we have seriously consid
ered moving in with them, like Mr. De Pinna, who
just dropped in one day and is still there. We might
help Mr. Sycamore with his fire-works, or just go
around with Grandpa to commencement exercises.
Anyhow, if you haven't laughed at, and with, the
Sycamores, you had better drop in.
At the Curran, Clifford Odet's latest, "Golden Boy,"
is playing with Francis Lederer and Betty Furness in
the leads. It's not another "Waiting for Lefty" or a
second "Awake and Sing," but it's one of the best he's
done since then. It's propaganda stuff, and if you've
always had a sneaking inclination to side with the
underdogs this may satisfy you.
And at the Alcazar, the Federal Theater is putting
on Elmer Rice's anti-Fascist play, "Judgement Day."
Moi'e propaganda, but of the obvious sort which, from
reports, doesn't quite come off.
And "Snow White" is playing at the St. Francis;
it's worth a trip to the city any time.
* * ♦ *.
AS FAR as the hotels go, there is no really out
standing band to attract you. But on the other
hand, none which absolutely is obnoxious. For pure
danceability—the swing fans, incidentally, are com
pletely excluded from our discussion —we like Roger
Pryor, at the St. Francis about the best of all. He's
got a nice beat to move around with, but with hot
weather coming on, he won't make you melt to keep
up with him.
Then old Joe "Pagliacci" Reichman is still jump
ing up and down on the piano. Until Anson Weeks
comes back, which is pretty soon, the Mark will con
tinue to lose some of Stanford's patronage.
At the Fairmont, Nat Brandwynne has replaced
Henry King. This, we feel, is too bad, because we
liked Henry King, and McGuirk and Collie Small
can just sit out this number.
And at the Sir Francis Drake, Carl Ravazza, who
took over Tom Coakley's band a while back, is hold
ing sway. He's not too sharp. For sentimental reasons,
we mention that Carvel Craig, an 'old campus band,
is working out at the Hotel Whitcomb. But don't
break a leg to get there.
* * ♦ * '
For something a little different, try the William
Tell, with schottiches and polkas. It's good fun. For
after theater moments, we like the Sky Room in the
Empire Hotel. Then there's the Tahiti Hut, the Seven
Seas, and the South Seas (one of which is closed right
now for rrtlecoration), and the Plantation if you're
feeling in the mood.
This ought to hold you for a while, and if not. we
give up.—Stone.

AS FAR as the hotels go, there is no really out
standing band to attract you. But on the other
hand, none which absolutely is obnoxious. For pure
danceability—the swing fans, incidentally, are com
pletely excluded from our discussion —we like Roger
Pryor, at the St. Francis about the best of all. He's
got a nice beat to move around with, but with hot
weather coming on, he won't make you melt to keep
up with him.
Then old Joe "Pagliacci" Reichman is still jump
ing up and down on the piano. Until Anson Weeks
comes back, which is pretty soon, the Mark will con
tinue to lose some of Stanford's patronage.
At the Fairmont, Nat Brandwynne has replaced
Henry King. This, we feel, is too bad, because we
liked Henry King, and McGuirk and Collie Small
can just sit out this number.
And at the Sir Francis Drake, Carl Ravazza, who
took over Tom Coakley's band a while back, is hold
ing sway. He's not too sharp. For sentimental reasons,
we mention that Carvel Craig, an 'old campus band,
is working out at the Hotel Whitcomb. But don't
break a leg to get there.

For something a little different, try the William
Tell, with schottiches and polkas. It's good fun. For
after theater moments, we like the Sky Room in the
Empire Hotel. Then there's the Tahiti Hut, the Seven
Seas, and the South Seas (one of which is closed right
now for rrtlecoration), and the Plantation if you're
feeling in the mood.
This ought to hold you for a while, and if not. we
give up.—Stone.
1 WAS reminded by the crowd on the Row about 2:30
Saturday night that this was open season in San
Francisco. If you go up, you might find something
to interest you in the following round-up of current
entertainment.
The theaters are in full swing with "You Can't Take
It With You" playing its third, and probably last,
week at the Geary Theater. This Kaufman-Hart win
ner, as you probably know alx-eady, is about as crazy
and lovable a family as has gi'aced this earth in these
perilous times. In fact, we have seriously consid
ered moving in with them, like Mr. De Pinna, who
just dropped in one day and is still there. We might
help Mr. Sycamore with his fire-works, or just go
around with Grandpa to commencement exercises.
Anyhow, if you haven't laughed at, and with, the
Sycamores, you had better drop in.
At the Curran, Clifford Odet's latest, "Golden Boy,"
is playing with Francis Lederer and Betty Furness in
the leads. It's not another "Waiting for Lefty" or a
second "Awake and Sing," but it's one of the best he's
done since then. It's propaganda stuff, and if you've
always had a sneaking inclination to side with the
underdogs this may satisfy you.
And at the Alcazar, the Federal Theater is putting
on Elmer Rice's anti-Fascist play, "Judgement Day."
Moi'e propaganda, but of the obvious sort which, from
reports, doesn't quite come off.
And "Snow White" is playing at the St. Francis;
it's worth a trip to the city any time.
