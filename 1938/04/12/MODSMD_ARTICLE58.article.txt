## BRAVO FOR THORNE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Here's a gripe against last Thurs
day's "Genuine Pacifist" and a bravo
for Marco Thome's "Future War
Memorial Society."
First, it's reasonably probable
that "Genuine Pacifist" has sincere
aspirations toward eternal peace,
but he may or may not know how
this is to be accomplished (which
can be said of various other people
throughout history).
If "Genuine Pacifist" has the
"cold dope" on this sticker, it would
be good of him to spread it about.
As for what "Genuine Pacifist"'
calls "Thome's adolescent satire," I
must contend that it's a bit silly.
Many of us are convinced that war
is ridiculous, but according to his
tory, convictions are usually for
gotten when the drums begin to roll.
We know that war is a horrible
mess, but when the bugles start in,
most of us are swept to the recruit
ing station as fast as patriotism can
sweep.
Why shouldn't we be made to re
member war as the comical thing it
really is, so that it's mention any
time will bring a snort of laughter?
Maybe "silly" things like Thome's
"Future War Memorial Society'
would be a good things, and help to
make the thought of being a soldier
as funny as that of being a fresh
man coming home to Roble some
night and finding seven dwarfs in
her room.

Buck
