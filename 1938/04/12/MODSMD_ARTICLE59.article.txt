# WHERE IS IT?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Stone is right; peace docs de
serve at least a little more attention
than a day in the spring. Even
conservative students will admit
that.
But please, Mr. Stone, must you |
slap the Peace Committee in the face, j
In our beaverish little way, we de- I
cided to form a permanent peace ;
council two months ago. Right
now our immediate concern is to
complete the program for Peace
Day, which was the original purpose
of the committee.
