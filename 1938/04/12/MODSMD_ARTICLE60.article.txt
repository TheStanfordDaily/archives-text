# SCORN ON COBBS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Surprised and shocked was I
when I read the editorial of our
little intellectual genius, one John
Cobbs.
John, my lad, there can be no
doubt that '41 is an idealist. But I
there is no name for your evident
self-satisfaction. I am inclined to
think the former is the lesser evil.
It is in the power of editorial writ
ers to help raise the standards of a
university, and much is to be done
to eradicate the enmity and coercion
which make Stanford anything but
a "fountain of virtue." If our poli
tics is nothing more than a "game,"
why don't we do away with the
whole business? May I suggest that
these writers put their influence to
better use in the future?
Irate
