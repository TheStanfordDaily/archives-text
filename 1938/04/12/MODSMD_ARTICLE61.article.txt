## 
### 
When H. Pettus Randall pub
lished his "Who's Who Among
Students in American Univer
sities and Colleges in Amer
ica' this year, he included the
names of 19 Stanford students,
misspelled eight of them.
Most flagrant butch was 011
the much publicized name of
Stanford's basketball captain,
which was spelled Loisette.
The other seven approxima
tions to Farm names are:
Betty Kellyer, James Caffis,
Donald Malton, Barbara Viviah
Murphy, Arthur Stofen, Tom
Killiefer.
The spelling is remarkable
all the way through. According
to the book, Oregon State Uni
versity is at Corvallise, Oregon.
