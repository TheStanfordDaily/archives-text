### BILL MILLIS 
r |MIE long-brewing political split
between pro - Administration
New Dealers and Conservative Dem
ocrats has now reached the stage in
which attempts are being made to
smother it under a barrage of de
nials, counter-charges, and "every
thing is lovely" statements.
Yesterday President Roosevelt
contributed his share by sharply de
nying earlier newspaper reports
that he and Vice-President John
Nance Garner were at odds over
liberalizing New Deal spending pol
icies. The President said that noth
ing had arisen in their conference to
mar his friendship with the Vice-
President, and added that Garner
also denied the reports.
Despite these assurances, the
talk in Washington last night was
that Garner had expostulated
against the Administration's pro
posed new multi-billion dollar
spending program.
It became evident that a new
vitriolic battle is ahead in Con
gress, where rebellious Demo
crats will light the good Repub
lican fight to "ear-mark the pro
posed expenditures and thus pre
vent granting to the Administra
tion a free hand to direct spend
ing the nation out of depression.

A BROAD, the most important
news was from France. Pre
mier Edouard Daladier's self-styled
"national defense" government
wrung from the Chamber of Depu
ties a 508 to 12 approval of requests
for power to govern France by
emergency government decrees for
three months.
At the same time, the backbone
of the strike wave threatening
France's preparedness program
appeared to be broken after Min
ister of Labor Paul Ramadier an
nounced that strikers in the na
tionalized aviation factories will
return to work today.
A government announcement said
that the trade unions involved
agreed to a 45-hour, instead of a 40-
hour week "if necessary to insure
adequate national defense."

New difficulties for France have
arisen in Tunis, North Africa, scene
_of recent nationalist rioting, which
may make Daladier think twice be
fore following Britain's lead in
bringing about a friendship pact
with Premier Benito Mussolini.
An Italian newspaper charged
France with poor colonial adminis
tration and said that Italy is inter
ested in "restoration of justicc
among the inhabitants of Tunisia, a
majority of whom arc Italians."

A propaganda "trial balloon" was
released in Washington yesterday,
when high Navy officials asserted
that Japan is constructing a new
"hit and run" fleet of super cruis

the most powerful offensive sea
weapon in existence." Official cir
cles said that if the reports proved
true, the United States may be
forced to increase the size of her
new cruisers.
