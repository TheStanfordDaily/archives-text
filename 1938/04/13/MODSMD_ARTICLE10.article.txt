# Morros Talks On Film Music
## Ralph Rainger Plays Own Compositions 
### 
Boris Morros, musical director at
Paramount Studios in Hollywood,
talked on "Music in Films" last eve
ning in Memorial Hall. His lecture \
was illustrated by piano selections by j
Ralph Rainger, composer of popular ,
music.
Mr. Morros" was introduced by
Professor Warren D. Allen, head of
the music department here, who sur
veyed the lecturer's career before
his arrival in Hollywood. He is es
pecially noted for founding the I
"Chauve Souris" and writing the i
"March of the Wooden Soldiers" as
the finale to the program.
Mr. Morros defined music as some- j
thing which "expresses the inexpres- i
sible," and added that "the greatest j
significance of music is in its rela
tion to life itself." It is an integral
part of human emotion; "no revo
lution could get along without it."
Mr. Morros further stated that
music is the inseparable companion
of moving pictures. Even in the
days of silent movies, pictures were
accompanied in the individual the
aters by piano players who picked 1
their own selections to fit the mood !
of the action. Thus began stock j
pieces always used to illustrate ro- j
mance, action, sadness, etc., and j
1 which later came to be synchronized j
with the film in the first "talkies." j
"Birth of a Nation" was the first I
j picture to use an original score com- i
posed especially for the picture in the I
modern manner of creating "shades
lof moods." The score is now con
; sidcred the psychological back
ground for the action.
Mr. Morros believes that opera
! will succeed on the screen only
| when a median is found between op
: era and musical films as they are ]
; today. He also said that, through
1 movies, "the music of tomorrow will
be universal."
Ralph Rainger played a number of
his own compositions after the lec
ture to an enthusiastic audience.
Among them were, "A Rendezvous
with a Dream,' "You Took the
i Words Right Out of My Heart," and
"Thanks for the Memory," in addi
tion to a new cowboy song written
for a moving picture now in pro
duction.

Mr. Morros further stated that
music is the inseparable companion
of moving pictures. Even in the
days of silent movies, pictures were
accompanied in the individual the
aters by piano players who picked 1
their own selections to fit the mood !
of the action. Thus began stock j
pieces always used to illustrate ro- j
mance, action, sadness, etc., and j
1 which later came to be synchronized j
with the film in the first "talkies." j
"Birth of a Nation" was the first I
j picture to use an original score com- i
posed especially for the picture in the I
modern manner of creating "shades
lof moods." The score is now con
; sidcred the psychological back
ground for the action.
Mr. Morros believes that opera
! will succeed on the screen only
| when a median is found between op
: era and musical films as they are ]
; today. He also said that, through
1 movies, "the music of tomorrow will
be universal."
Ralph Rainger played a number of
his own compositions after the lec
ture to an enthusiastic audience.
Among them were, "A Rendezvous
with a Dream,' "You Took the
i Words Right Out of My Heart," and
"Thanks for the Memory," in addi
tion to a new cowboy song written
for a moving picture now in pro
duction.
