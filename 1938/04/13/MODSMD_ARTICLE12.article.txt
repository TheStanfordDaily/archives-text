# Scholarship Considered By Excom
## Crary and McDaniel Speak in Favor Of $500 Stagers' Fund 
### 
Discussing a proposed $500 Sta
gers' scholarship for a technical stu
dent, Ex Committee last night sched
uled final action for next week.
Harry Horton asked that members
be given a week "to think it over."
He was appointed committee of one
to report at next meeting.
Speaking in favor of the scholar
ship were President Paul Crary of
Stagers and Clay McDaniel, chair
man of Dramatic Council.
"Selection will be made on the
basis of ability, need, and scholar
ship," said McDaniels.
Crary emphasized the point that
the scholarship is needed in order
to bring technical students to Stan
ford, because "almost everyone here
now wants to act."
Among other subjects of Ex Com
mittee deliberation were the fol
lowing:
ACTIVITIES CARD FILE: For
weeks, Ed Barnett has been gather- ,
ing facts about a file from which all |
student committees can be selected.
Last night he reported, advocating a
$55 cross-file with space for 590
names, and a series of interviews to
get names of students and the ac
tivities they want to get into.
Harry Horton objected. "It has no
possibilities—l'll be frank," he said.
Approving purchase of the file, Ex
Committee left details to Barnett and
John Dern, who are to report next
week.
ELECTION RETURNS: Chairman
Dick Riddell's report was accepted
without objection.
The new election system, with its
four polls and with voters required
to present student body cards, was
a success, said Riddell, recommend
ing its continuance. If there was any
multiple voting, it was with the
other person's approval, he said.
FREE QUADS: In recent years,
Ex Committee has bought 50 Quads
each summer, sending them out to
high schools of the state to interest
students in Stanford.
Phil Klauber favored the expense.
"I used to read them when I was a
little kid," he said.
The committee authorized pur
chase of the 50 Quads at cost, in
spite of Business Manager Minthorne
Tompkins' suggestion that they pay
full price for his book.
BASKETBALL AWARD: Ap
proving Coach John Bunn's selection
last week of Dale Huff for a special
Block "S" for outstanding work, Ex
Committee decided the choice was
justified by his consistent practice
and work in scouting other teams.
Nellie Heath, also considered for
the award, received it last year, it
was pointed out, and Huff was
thought most deserving of the sen
iors.

Discussing a proposed $500 Sta
gers' scholarship for a technical stu
dent, Ex Committee last night sched
uled final action for next week.
Harry Horton asked that members
be given a week "to think it over."
He was appointed committee of one
to report at next meeting.
Speaking in favor of the scholar
ship were President Paul Crary of
Stagers and Clay McDaniel, chair
man of Dramatic Council.
"Selection will be made on the
basis of ability, need, and scholar
ship," said McDaniels.
Crary emphasized the point that
the scholarship is needed in order
to bring technical students to Stan
ford, because "almost everyone here
now wants to act."
Among other subjects of Ex Com
mittee deliberation were the fol
lowing:
ACTIVITIES CARD FILE: For
weeks, Ed Barnett has been gather- ,
ing facts about a file from which all |
student committees can be selected.
Last night he reported, advocating a
$55 cross-file with space for 590
names, and a series of interviews to
get names of students and the ac
tivities they want to get into.
Harry Horton objected. "It has no
possibilities—l'll be frank," he said.
Approving purchase of the file, Ex
Committee left details to Barnett and
John Dern, who are to report next
week.

The new election system, with its

multiple voting, it was with the
other person's approval, he said.
