# H. B. Lee Elected On Second Count
## Hall Women Elect Major Part of Slate Row Candidates Dominate Entire Class Office List 
### 
The phenomenon of a Lagunita-
Union uprising yesterday overshad
owed most features of an election
f/hich moved Alpha Delt 11. B. Lee
and Tri-Delt Betty Davis into the
A.S.S.U. presidency and vice-presi
dency.
An all-time high of 2033 votes were
cast yesterday, according to un
official estimates. That was nearly
300 votes over last year's total, and
exceeded the previous high by 200
votes.
Still spurred by an election fever
which started when Women's Con
ference approved a nominating com
mittee, Lagunita and Union turned
out a 91 per cent vote, swept Hitll
women into 7 out of 11 major offices
sought, helped elect 4 of 13 men
backed by Halls.
92 Per Cent Vote
Out of 252 women residing in La
gunita, 92 per coat, or 2G9, voted;
out of 160 Union women, 95 per cent,
or 152, cast ballots.
Exclusive of W.A.A. posts, Row
elected 13 candidates and Halls cap
tured 11—an almost unprecedented
Hall performance in a spring quar
ter election.
Row could claim only seven major
victories — A.S.S.U. president and
vice-president, graduate member of
Ex Committee, sophomore man on
Ex Committee, two Men's Council
jobs, and senior and junior class
presidencies. The other six were
distributed among class offices.
How Takes Class Jobs
Halls lost out completely in class
elections, dropping every contest,
but the Lagunita-Union combine
made up for that by sweeping Wom
en's Conference and Women's Coun
cil posts.
Recounts and second-choice counts
last night elected Row-backed Bob
Mangan graduate member of Ex
Committee over Stan Zimet, 994-975;
named Jack Partridge, Hall candi
date, member-at-alrge, on Excom
over Boz Zellcr, Beta, and Tom R.
Felt, Sequoia, 999-950-216 and Hall
sponsored Anna belle Clark junior
woman over the Row's Barbara Ri
ley and Betty Finch. 957-906-503.
Ilali Majority
The outcome gives Halls a six-to
five majority on Ex Committee for
next fall.

| Simpson, Hall candidate, 10 of her
j original 259 \otes, and election as
j vice-president of the Class of '39,

. and election over Jean Fox, who

of 251.
