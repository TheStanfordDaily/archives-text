ment committee chairman.
Five sororities and six fraternities j
turned in a 100 per cent showing,
each senior in those living groups !
having contributed to the Fund.

In general percentages, sororities j
led, followed by Row men, Hall i

Two hundred forty-five out of 800 j
Stanford seniors yesterday had ral- j
lied to the 1938 annual appeal for j
the Stanford Fund to the extent of !
contributing $657.70, according to a I
report by George Ditz, senior endow- J
ment committee chairman.
Five sororities and six fraternities j
turned in a 100 per cent showing,
each senior in those living groups !
having contributed to the Fund.
Sororities Lead
In general percentages, sororities j
led, followed by Row men, Hall i
women, Hall men, and off-campus j
residents.
With 15 living groups yet to be
heard from, senior class this year
stands considerably behind the rec- j
ord set by the Class of 1937 in the '
first annual appeal for the Fund last !
spring. A contribution record of 42 1
per cent was set by '37, whereas '38
has to date only a 30 per cent show
ing in this regard.
