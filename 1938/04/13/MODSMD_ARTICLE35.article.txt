### 
This morning is the last time that
25-cent tickets will be sold to stu
dents on the Engineering Corner for
the Division of Speech and Drama's
forthcoming melodrama, "Kind
Lady,' to be presented tomorrow,
Friday, and Saturday in Memorial
Hall.
All seats are on reserve and may
be purchased anytime in Room 202
of Memorial Hall by those who fail
to get them on the Quad. General
admission is 50 cents, but students
will be admitted for 25 cents upon
presentation of their student body
cards.
"Kind Lady" was adapted from the
"Silver Mask," a short story by the
famed English writer, Hugh Wal
pole. First presented in London, it
was brought to the New York stage
in 1935. The following year the play
was made into a motion picture,
starring Basil Rathbone.
The Stanford production is under
the direction of H. Miles Heberer,
who is temporarily on the faculty
here while on leave from Kansas
State College, where he has been
director of drama for the past 13
years. A graduate of the Univer
sity of Illinois, Heberer has done
some writing, producing, and di
recting for the National Broadcast
ing Company and had a play pro
duced at Pasadena Community
Playhouse.
