r R ITERS who cover the Holly
wood front spend a great deal
of their very valuable time guessing
the screen-life-span of newcomers
to the land of cold, glory, and guff.
One of the latest prognostications
to come from the southland con
cerns the Farm's current contribu
tion to the athletic Hall of Fame, bas
ketball's greatest Ail-American,
Captain Hank Luisetti.
It seems that there's an axiom Jjy
which all the Hollywood faithfuls
abide: sports stars do not make movie
stars. However, this rule, as is every
rule, is tied down by the law of
averages, and 'he wisenheimers see
a jack pot in the crystal ball. If
so, maybe Hank will grab it.
In case you've misplaced the
sports files, the Card captain is
signed, sealed, and delivered to
Paramount. The moguls there saw
a box office name in Luisetti, the
gent who chalked up (1) a new
world's four-year scoring mark;
(2) a new conference one-season
record, which lie broke the fol
lowing season; and (.'{) a record
number of points for one game.
So they contracted Hank for a
possible seven years. It'll be $10,-
000 for liini, as the star of one
film, before he and his bosses
learn whether he has what it
takes.
But Luisetti's present views may
stymie Paramount, even if he does
have "what it takes." Right now,
Hank is definite in his plans: one
picture, and then to work in the
business world.
And maybe he's right because
only one out of dozens of sports
headliners has so far hit the jack
pot.
Sonja Henie is the winner, and
appropriately enough, her first film
was "One in a Million."
Going back for a glance at the
ones who didn't quite score, John
ny Mack Brown comes to mind.
As a football hero, after winning
the 192t> Rose Bowl classic for Ala
bama, he started off right fine, but
it was, apparently, a quick flash.
He's in the serials now.
Swimmers did okay for a while,
but didn't last. Johnny Weissmuller
dragged down fame and $25,000 per
annum as Tarzan, but Mr. M-G-M
doesn't make any more flickies in
volving the apeman.
Moving over to the diamond, it
is a well-known fact that base
ball's breakfast food hero, Lou
Gehrig, is playing hard and long
at the game of bats and horsehide.
The western he made will be most
likely bis one and only contribu
tion to the motion picture art.
And there are other one-timers,
such as Babe Ruth, Gene Tunney,
Max Baer, Jack Dempsey, and
Glenn Morris.
It's going to be a tough row to hoe,
in case Hank changes his mind and
decides to stay in Hollywoodâ€”pro
vided his first opus has enough box
office to help pay Mr. Paramount's
income tax. And that remains to be
seen.
