# Cards To Meet U.S.C. Nine Today
## Farm Team May Upset Southerners Game Will Be Last Between Teams; S.C. Victor in First Two 
### JERRY HAWLEY 
Coach Sam Barry's U.S.C. base
ballers, touring Northern California
baseball circles this week, stop off
at the Farm today to meet Harry
Wolter's revamped Indians at 3:30
o'clock on the Sunken Diamond in
the third and last game of the sea
son for the two teams.
The Trojans have already taken
the thre-egame series with the In
dians by winning the first two tilts
in Los Angeles, 12-5 and 9-3. The
best the Cards can do now is pre
vent the Trojans from clean-sweep
ing the series by annexing this
afternoon's tilt.
Conference competition last week
saw changes in the first three places
in C.1.8.A. standings. U.S.C., lead
ing the loop until Monday, was
dropped to third place when St.
Mary's pulled a surprise victory over
the Trojans, 6-4. *
Although beaten by Stanford Sat
urday, California replaced Troy in
the league leadership and the Bear-
Trojan game yesterday was to have
decided first place ownership. St.
Mary's, by winning its last five
games in a row, jumped from third
to second place, and is now a defi
nite contender.
C.1.8.A. standings until yester
day:
Won Lost Pet.
California 9 3 .850
St. Mary's 8 3 .727
U.S.C 5 2 .714
U.C.L.A 5 5 .500
Stanford 5 7 .416
Santa Clara 1 13 .071
Harry Wolter has not named his
pitching choice, but most likely it
will be Fred Furman with Bill
Jameson doing the catching. For
U.S.C., Lou Crosby probably will
take the mound with Roy Engle be
hind the plate.

Coach Sam Barry's U.S.C. base
ballers, touring Northern California
baseball circles this week, stop off
at the Farm today to meet Harry
Wolter's revamped Indians at 3:30
o'clock on the Sunken Diamond in
the third and last game of the sea
son for the two teams.
The Trojans have already taken
the thre-egame series with the In
dians by winning the first two tilts
in Los Angeles, 12-5 and 9-3. The
best the Cards can do now is pre
vent the Trojans from clean-sweep
ing the series by annexing this
afternoon's tilt.
Conference competition last week
saw changes in the first three places
in C.1.8.A. standings. U.S.C., lead
ing the loop until Monday, was
dropped to third place when St.
Mary's pulled a surprise victory over
the Trojans, 6-4. *
Although beaten by Stanford Sat
urday, California replaced Troy in
the league leadership and the Bear-
Trojan game yesterday was to have
decided first place ownership. St.
Mary's, by winning its last five
games in a row, jumped from third
to second place, and is now a defi
nite contender.
C.1.8.A. standings until yester
day:
Won Lost Pet.
California 9 3 .850
St. Mary's 8 3 .727
U.S.C 5 2 .714
U.C.L.A 5 5 .500
Stanford 5 7 .416
Santa Clara 1 13 .071
Harry Wolter has not named his
pitching choice, but most likely it
will be Fred Furman with Bill
Jameson doing the catching. For
U.S.C., Lou Crosby probably will
take the mound with Roy Engle be
hind the plate.
