# Farm Skiers Plan Easter Week-end
## 
### 
Stanford skiers are making plans
for a big Easter week-end. The
spring snow is the best, but there
are only about three weeks of good
skiing left, as the snow is melting
rapidly. Reservations can be made
at the A.S.S.U. office in the Union
and should be made before Thurs
day as there are only a few left,
according to Jaync Copp, club vice
president.
On Friday, April 15, a downhill
rope race, a potato race, and a nov
ice slalom race for all who have
not competed in a meet recognized
by the C.S.S.A. will be held; on
Saturday, April 16, a May Spring
Challenger Trophy and Straight
Race for men and women; and on
Easter Sunday, April 17, an Easter
Egg slalom for men and women and
a giant slalom for men and women,
boys and girls. â€¢
