# Templeton Books S.J. Practice Meet
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
Preparing for the Olympic Club
meet next Saturday, Coach Robert
Lyman Templeton has scheduled an
informal practice meet with San
Jose State tomorrow on Angell
Field.
Despite the fact that the strong
"Winged-O" tracksters from the
Olympic Club trounced the Spartans
last week, 90-41, the San Joseans
boast several individual perform
ers who are capable of affording the
Cards some competition:
Lowell Todd, a 190-foot javelin
tosser; A1 Parr, who goes well over
23 feet in the broad jump; Henry
and Ed Vasconcellos, who are right
behind Parr in the broad jump; and
Len Herman, a 1:59.1 half-miler.
'Winged-O' Strong
Coach Charley Hunter's Olym
pians have been bolstered by some
of the standout athletes in the Bay
Region since their early season de
faet, 83-48, by California. The
clubmen turned in some splendid
times in their rout over the Spar
tans.
Some former Farm greats will be
out leveling against their alma
mater Saturday, including A1
Blackman, 440; Chuck Nimmo, mile;
Phil Levy, shot and discus; Johnny
Mottram, javelin; and Humbert
Smith, high jump. Along with Del
Fishback and Tom Moore, former
Bear hurdlers; Elroy Robinson,
world record holder in the 880; Ed
Waterbury, 200-foot javelin tosser;
and Cornelius Warmerdam, now
just about the classiest pole vaulter
in the country with the retiring of
Sefton and Meadows of U.S.C., the
clubmen figure to give the Indians a
whale of a battle.
Discus Workout
Templeton worked especially on
his discus heavers at yesterday's
practice. Pete Zagar went unplaced
in the U.C.L.A. meet, which prac
tically constituted a major upset,
and Dink wants to make sure that
big Pete gets out of his rut. Tom
Montgomery, shot-putter, is another
weight veteran who is having
trouble. Montgomery is capable of
51 feet, but last Saturday was the
second straight meet that he has
failed to reach even 50 feet.
Luckily for Stanford, a couple of
unsung athletes have come through
to fill the breach. Hugh Gribbin,
perhaps the most under-rated man
on the team, is improving steadily
and should be close to 165 feet by
the end of the year. Jack Lipman,
just another shot-putter last year,

has now beaten Montgomery twice
following the latter's last two per
formances.
Simpson Better
Dick Simpson, sophomore hurdler,
is another boy who is getting good
in a hurry. Winner of last year's
"Little Big Meet" high hurdles,
Simpson is now Number one tim
bertopper on the Farm. Last Sat
urday he lost by a nose to Bill
Lacefield of U.C.L.A. in 14.7.
"Stanford Stan" Hiserman, who
might run the. low hurdles instead
of the furlong against the Bears two
weeks henCe, ran several flights of
120-yard low hurdles yesterday, his
best time being, 13 flat. "Stanford
Stan" has tremendous speed be
tween the hurdles and if he ever
develops his form he should be the
best low barrier man on the Coast.
In his first competitive test last Sat
urday. he t.ook second in the speedy
time of 23.5.
Mahurin Improving
Carl Mahurin continues to show
improvement in the middle dis
tances and seenis well on his way
to recovery from a leg injury. He
and Craig Williamson, diminutive
440 and 880 man, ran the quarter in
49.5 and 49.7, respectively, yes
terday.
Barney Ferguson, half-miler,
sprang into notice last week with
his strong second to Mahurin in the
880. Ferguson, although he lost by
six yards, was closing fast at the
finish.

of the furlong against the Bears two
weeks henCe, ran several flights of
120-yard low hurdles yesterday, his
best time being, 13 flat. "Stanford
Stan" has tremendous speed be
tween the hurdles and if he ever
develops his form he should be the
best low barrier man on the Coast.
In his first competitive test last Sat
urday. he t.ook second in the speedy
time of 23.5.
Mahurin Improving
Carl Mahurin continues to show
improvement in the middle dis
tances and seenis well on his way
to recovery from a leg injury. He
and Craig Williamson, diminutive
440 and 880 man, ran the quarter in
49.5 and 49.7, respectively, yes
terday.
Barney Ferguson, half-miler,
sprang into notice last week with
his strong second to Mahurin in the
880. Ferguson, although he lost by
six yards, was closing fast at the
finish.
Preparing for the Olympic Club
meet next Saturday, Coach Robert
Lyman Templeton has scheduled an
informal practice meet with San
Jose State tomorrow on Angell
Field.
Despite the fact that the strong
"Winged-O" tracksters from the
Olympic Club trounced the Spartans
last week, 90-41, the San Joseans
boast several individual perform
ers who are capable of affording the
Cards some competition:
Lowell Todd, a 190-foot javelin
tosser; A1 Parr, who goes well over
23 feet in the broad jump; Henry
and Ed Vasconcellos, who are right
behind Parr in the broad jump; and
Len Herman, a 1:59.1 half-miler.
'Winged-O' Strong
Coach Charley Hunter's Olym
pians have been bolstered by some
of the standout athletes in the Bay
Region since their early season de
faet, 83-48, by California. The
clubmen turned in some splendid
times in their rout over the Spar
tans.
Some former Farm greats will be
out leveling against their alma
mater Saturday, including A1
Blackman, 440; Chuck Nimmo, mile;
Phil Levy, shot and discus; Johnny
Mottram, javelin; and Humbert
Smith, high jump. Along with Del
Fishback and Tom Moore, former
Bear hurdlers; Elroy Robinson,
world record holder in the 880; Ed
Waterbury, 200-foot javelin tosser;
and Cornelius Warmerdam, now
just about the classiest pole vaulter
in the country with the retiring of
Sefton and Meadows of U.S.C., the
clubmen figure to give the Indians a
whale of a battle.
Discus Workout
Templeton worked especially on
his discus heavers at yesterday's
practice. Pete Zagar went unplaced
in the U.C.L.A. meet, which prac
tically constituted a major upset,
and Dink wants to make sure that
big Pete gets out of his rut. Tom
Montgomery, shot-putter, is another
weight veteran who is having
trouble. Montgomery is capable of
51 feet, but last Saturday was the
second straight meet that he has
failed to reach even 50 feet.
Luckily for Stanford, a couple of
unsung athletes have come through
to fill the breach. Hugh Gribbin,
perhaps the most under-rated man
on the team, is improving steadily
and should be close to 165 feet by
the end of the year. Jack Lipman,
just another shot-putter last year,

has now beaten Montgomery twice
following the latter's last two per
formances.
Simpson Better
Dick Simpson, sophomore hurdler,
is another boy who is getting good
in a hurry. Winner of last year's
"Little Big Meet" high hurdles,
Simpson is now Number one tim
bertopper on the Farm. Last Sat
urday he lost by a nose to Bill
Lacefield of U.C.L.A. in 14.7.
"Stanford Stan" Hiserman, who
might run the. low hurdles instead
of the furlong against the Bears two
weeks henCe, ran several flights of
