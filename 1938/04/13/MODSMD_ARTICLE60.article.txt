# Card Golfers Down Trojans, Stay Unbeaten
## Decisive Victory Makes Stanford Choice for Title 
### 
Paced by Art Doering with a par
smashing afternoon round of 69,
Stanford's undefeated varsity golf
team swamped U.S.C.'s Trojan con
tingent in convincing style yesterday
on the Stanford course, 18',j-4 , /i.
By trouncing Troy, the Cards ex
tended their winning streak to four
straight matchers, including a pre
vious victory over the Trojans. Their
convincing victory established the
Indians as definite favorites to down
California when the two teams meet
April 22 and 29 to decide the P.C.C.
dual meet championship. The Bears
ended S.C.'s winning streak at three
straight Monday, but their margin of
victory was not as large.
Stanford's chances of going east
for the national intercollegiate cham
pionship will hinge on the team's
showing against the Bears. Tuesday
the Cards play host to Oklahoma
University's traveling divot diggers.
