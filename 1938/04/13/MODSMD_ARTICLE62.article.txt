ballers 4-3 in a nip-and-tuck seven
inning game yesterday on the frosh

route for the frosh, allowing eight 1
hits and striking out five men be
tween them. Pfyl and Herb Atkin
son comprised the battery for the
first four innings, with Bill Masters

walk and sent eight batters away
from the plate via the strike-out
route.
In the fourth inning the frosh,
behind 3 to 1, pulled up to a tie,
only to have the Santa Cruz outfit

outfielder, Jed ofi' with a triple.

inning when with one out, another
three-bagger landed a man on I
third. This rally ended when Fay !
tagged the base runner on an at- |
tempted steal home, and a pop fly
to Pfyl made the third out.
