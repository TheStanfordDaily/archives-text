# Miss Yost Is Reasonable
## 
### 
WE are annoyed with Dean Mary Yost. She
is entirely too reasonable.
Yesterday we read a statement in which
she said that extra-curricular activities were one
of the causes of poor scholastic work, and that
they should be investigated. It sounded as
though activities were going to be made to
walk the plank because students liked them.
All of which appeared contrary to the pioneer
principles of Washington, Jefferson, and Leland
Stanford. And so we crowded on sail and made
for Miss Yost's office.
But Miss Yost is reasonable. It seems that
Stanford's activities are still good for any in
surance company's money, and do not need
a champion. That spoils a good editorial.
Activities, said Miss Yost, are valuable. They
provide on-campus recreation, practical expe
rience, fellowship, training. But, she pointed
out, some of the students who think college is
a good asylum from work use activities as an
excuse to keep from studying. Thus, a few
students do all the extra-curricular work, while
the others loaf their way through four activity
years of vegetating prominence.
Miss Yost wants to have the activity situation
investigated. She hopes that if the set-up can
be analyzed students can be inspired to take
better advantage of the system.
A faculty corrfmittee has been appointed to
look into the matter.
If the committee wants to crawfish out of
facing the problem, it will find it easy to do.
It can damn the present system like an Old
Testament prophet, and can demand changes.
It can then settle down to distributing guiet
inspiration among the students.
And if the committee stops there, it will miss
half the problem. There remains the guestion
of why students are so entranced with activities.
A few students take refuge in extra-curricular
organizations because they are afraid to study.
But the rest are sincere. They prefer activities
to study because they find activities more in
teresting, or because they feel they are getting
more out of them.
If the committee is to do its job, it must find
out why students consider activities a better
investment than study.
But that is up to the committee. Miss Yost
asks nothing more than an investigation. Jour
nalistically speaking, she is entirely too rea
sonable.—J. C.

excuse to keep from studying. Thus, a few
students do all the extra-curricular work, while
the others loaf their way through four activity
years of vegetating prominence.
Miss Yost wants to have the activity situation
investigated. She hopes that if the set-up can
be analyzed students can be inspired to take
better advantage of the system.
A faculty corrfmittee has been appointed to
look into the matter.
If the committee wants to crawfish out of
facing the problem, it will find it easy to do.
It can damn the present system like an Old
Testament prophet, and can demand changes.
It can then settle down to distributing guiet
inspiration among the students.
And if the committee stops there, it will miss
half the problem. There remains the guestion
of why students are so entranced with activities.
A few students take refuge in extra-curricular
organizations because they are afraid to study.
But the rest are sincere. They prefer activities
to study because they find activities more in
teresting, or because they feel they are getting
more out of them.
If the committee is to do its job, it must find
out why students consider activities a better
investment than study.
But that is up to the committee. Miss Yost
asks nothing more than an investigation. Jour
nalistically speaking, she is entirely too rea
sonable.—J. C.
