# Ex Committee Is Stymied
## 
### 
ONLY seven men were awarded letters for
varsity basketball play this season. The
Daily believes that is too few, it has said so.
It still believes it is too few.
But we don't know whom to blame. Ex Com
mittee has the power to give more awards, but
to do that it would have to abandon its own
criterion minutes played in the Cal games—
would have no criterion left. Such action also
would destroy whatever balance there exists
among all sports. Ex Committee, rather, is being
sensible, is making a general survey of the
letter situation.
John Bunn hardly can be blamed. He can
only recommend the men who have played
enough minutes plus one man for exceptional
service. The man he recommended was not the
top man in playing time among those left out
That man was given the exceptional award lasi
year. Coach Bunn nominated the next highest
senior for the letter.
Still seven letters are too few. This year, there
is no one to blame. Next year, if the same
thing occurs, there will be.
