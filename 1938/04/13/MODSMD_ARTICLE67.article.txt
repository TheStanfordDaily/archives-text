# Conference Is Subtle
## 
### 
FROM the dust of yesterday's election there
arise some statistics which might interest
Women's Conference. Of the 292 women who
live in Lagunita Court, only 23 did not vote. Of
the 160 women in the Union unit, 8 did net
vote. In other words, more women voted yes
terday than have ever appeared before in any
Stanford election.
A cross section of opinion reveals that the
women did not tuin out yesterday because they

were interested in candidates or platforms. They
voted because they had been aroused by the
compulsory nominating committee established
this year. Women say that the decision to form
the nominating committee angered them so
much that they took an interest in politics for
the first time.
The result of the nominating committee wasn't
bad. But it wasn't the golden dream of a result
Women's Conference predicted. The committee
simply rubber-stamped nominations by living
groups.
By coincidence the committee made the
women turn out. Maybe subtle Women's Con
ference foresaw this result. If it didn't, why do
we have the nominating committee?
We never could understand women.â€”J. C.
