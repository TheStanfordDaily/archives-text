FRANTIC FROSH
t'OR two days now, while votes have been bartered
right and left, and fine speeches meaning little or
nothing have been splashed across the front page of
The Daily, its editorial columns have been largely de
voted to blasting the daylights out of one trusting
freshman and his one earnest supporter.
They have been officially consigned to purgatory,
with a side trip through the Kingdom of Heaven, and
many words have been used to prove what innocent
sheep they are in a world of wolves.
To a certain extent, this is a justifiable attitude.
It is true that nothing can be done about Stanford
politics, unsavory though they are, by writing ex
clamatory letters to The Daily. The Daily wavers
between a policy of making exclamatory statements
itself, or cracking down on exclamatory statements
made by somebody else; and neither policy, pursued
over a great many years, has done any good.
The reform of Stanford politics is not something
for frantic freshmen to undertake; nor is it, perhaps,
something for The Daily to undertake through its edi
torial columns. But it is something which needs
doing; and it does not seem altogether right for the
chief organ of student opinion on the campus to decry
every sincere effort made in that direction.
The chief impression of The Daily's attitude which
emerges from the hullaballoo would seem to be this:
We are pretty bad, but we can't do much about it,
and therefore we might just as well forget the whole
business. With this psychology behind it, The Daily
runs excellent exposes of the Row machine, and then
refuses to support the general disgust it has aroused
by doing so.
Crusades cannot do for people what they will not
do for themselves; public sentiment must start with
the public. When it does start, it must be allowed to
grow. It must not be sat upon because in its early
stages it does not offer much more than a naively
enthusiastic desire for change.
The Daily should not start a crusade; that would
do no good. But on the other hand, neither should
it criticize a sincere plea for reform. It might con
cede to the frantic frosh the courage of his convictions,
and not be too harsh with what is, after all, a step
in the right direction.

refuses to support the general disgust it has aroused
by doing so.
Crusades cannot do for people what they will not
do for themselves; public sentiment must start with
the public. When it does start, it must be allowed to
grow. It must not be sat upon because in its early
stages it does not offer much more than a naively
enthusiastic desire for change.
The Daily should not start a crusade; that would
do no good. But on the other hand, neither should
it criticize a sincere plea for reform. It might con
cede to the frantic frosh the courage of his convictions,
and not be too harsh with what is, after all, a step
in the right direction.
