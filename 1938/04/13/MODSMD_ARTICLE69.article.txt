of hotels and hotel dancing, a recent
survey conducted by the business staff of The
Daily throws some interesting light on the subject.
The set-up: questions asked were on hotel prefer
ence, reason for preference, favorite orchestra now
playing, orchestra which Stanford would most like to
see back, whether swing music hit the spot, what
mid-week feature nights went over best, and the fa
vorite orchesrta of the nation. Both men and women
were asked.
First, of all, about a third of the men, and nearly
one-half the women liked the Mark best of all S.F.
hotels, with the St. Francis second, and the Palace a
fairly close third. Since the survey was made a month
or two back, we cannot say what effect the presence
of Reichman has had on the Stanford clientele. We
have our suspicions, though.
In all but one case, no matter which hotel was
chosen, "atmosphere" was given as the reason, by a
huge majority. Apparently the orchestra makes very
little difference, especially to the women. Habit plays
some part, while space, service, and "no reason" barely
feature at all.
However, percentages show that some hotels rank
higher than others in these lesser considerations. For
instance, the men who like the Palace give space as the
reason, with "orchestra" a close second. We also note
that none of the Stanford men have the habit of going
to the St. Francis. However, 6.2 per cent of the women
who prefer the Frantic put down habit as the prime
consideration. Which proves that the ladies wield
more power behind the throne than one might suspect.
Only one hotel, the Claremont, scored 100 per cent
for any reason—and thatwwats t space. No comment.
* * * *
favorite orchestra was, as you might
suspect, Henry King, but not by a very large ma
jority. Ranking close behind were Sterling Young,
and, to make liars out of us, Joe Reichman. Down
at the bottom of the women's preference was Eddie
Duchin. So it looks like the gentlemen were the
only ones who enjoyed the Senior Prom. • Marvelous
how these women dissimulate, isn't it?
For second choice, Henry King was again at the
top, followed by Joe Reichman and Sterling Young.
The preferences of the men and women tallied pretty
closely.
But we see that the Stanford men are guilty of a
rather curious anomaly in placing King and Young
in top spot, because 54 per cent of them claimcd to
prefer swing music. However, the women voted 55
per cent against it. With those perforated sandals Ihey
have taken to wearing lately, no wonder.
As a note to hotels, 79 per cent of the! men, and 90
per cent of the women abhor feature nights at the
hotels. This shows excellent powers of discrimination,
it. seems to us, and Stanford is to be congratulated.
As for the band Stanford would like back most of
all. Rood old Griff Williams leads the list. Paul Pen
darvis is second. This far the men and women agree,
but from ihere on. differences of opinion abound.
And Stanford men choose Tommy Dorsey as their
favorite band of the nation, while the women—in spite
of voting against swing music—stick to Benny Good
man. Right behind, in both eases, is Hal Kemp. We
were distressed, however, to find the men putting Guy
Lombardo, Sammy Kay, and Kay Kaiser high up on
the list. The women were much better about it.

one-half the women liked the Mark best of all S.F.
hotels, with the St. Francis second, and the Palace a
fairly close third. Since the survey was made a month
or two back, we cannot say what effect the presence
of Reichman has had on the Stanford clientele. We
have our suspicions, though.
In all but one case, no matter which hotel was
chosen, "atmosphere" was given as the reason, by a
huge majority. Apparently the orchestra makes very
little difference, especially to the women. Habit plays
some part, while space, service, and "no reason" barely
feature at all.
However, percentages show that some hotels rank
higher than others in these lesser considerations. For
instance, the men who like the Palace give space as the
reason, with "orchestra" a close second. We also note
that none of the Stanford men have the habit of going
to the St. Francis. However, 6.2 per cent of the women
who prefer the Frantic put down habit as the prime
consideration. Which proves that the ladies wield
more power behind the throne than one might suspect.
Only one hotel, the Claremont, scored 100 per cent
for any reason—and thatwwats t space. No comment.
* * * *
favorite orchestra was, as you might
suspect, Henry King, but not by a very large ma
jority. Ranking close behind were Sterling Young,
and, to make liars out of us, Joe Reichman. Down
at the bottom of the women's preference was Eddie
Duchin. So it looks like the gentlemen were the
only ones who enjoyed the Senior Prom. • Marvelous
how these women dissimulate, isn't it?
For second choice, Henry King was again at the
top, followed by Joe Reichman and Sterling Young.
The preferences of the men and women tallied pretty
closely.
But we see that the Stanford men are guilty of a
rather curious anomaly in placing King and Young
in top spot, because 54 per cent of them claimcd to
prefer swing music. However, the women voted 55
per cent against it. With those perforated sandals Ihey
have taken to wearing lately, no wonder.
As a note to hotels, 79 per cent of the! men, and 90
per cent of the women abhor feature nights at the
hotels. This shows excellent powers of discrimination,
it. seems to us, and Stanford is to be congratulated.
As for the band Stanford would like back most of
all. Rood old Griff Williams leads the list. Paul Pen
darvis is second. This far the men and women agree,
but from ihere on. differences of opinion abound.
And Stanford men choose Tommy Dorsey as their
favorite band of the nation, while the women—in spite
of voting against swing music—stick to Benny Good
man. Right behind, in both eases, is Hal Kemp. We
were distressed, however, to find the men putting Guy
Lombardo, Sammy Kay, and Kay Kaiser high up on
the list. The women were much better about it.
We don't know what this all proves, but it's inter
est itu' anyhow. Sloiio
of hotels and hotel dancing, a recent
survey conducted by the business staff of The
Daily throws some interesting light on the subject.
The set-up: questions asked were on hotel prefer
ence, reason for preference, favorite orchestra now
playing, orchestra which Stanford would most like to
see back, whether swing music hit the spot, what
mid-week feature nights went over best, and the fa
vorite orchesrta of the nation. Both men and women
were asked.
First, of all, about a third of the men, and nearly
one-half the women liked the Mark best of all S.F.
hotels, with the St. Francis second, and the Palace a
fairly close third. Since the survey was made a month
or two back, we cannot say what effect the presence
