# Authenticity Adds Charm To 'Victoria'
## 
### 
"Victoria the Great," currently
playing at the Clay International
Theater, S.F.:
Accuracy, that Janus of virtue and
vice in a historical film, reared its
double head in this latest Victorian
revival from England.
To its authenticity may be laid a
not inconsiderable part of its very
great artistry as cinema. Its fidel
ity in recreating the manners, modes,

and morals of a
famous era make
it an important
document. As for
costumes and
sets—the produc
ers went on rec
ord as "grateful"
for the use of five
or six of Eng
land's best castles

and everything else from the period
but the Queen's virtue itself.
On the other hand, history hap
pens not to fall in convenient sce
nario sequence. To this fact may
be credited the scrappy intrusion of
several episodes which broke the
unity of action, watered the fade
out, and generally bore no more
affinity for the plot than a feather
for a piece of scrap iron. Several
shots in very bad technicolor trailed
irrelevantly up the rear revealing
Victoria at her Diamond Jubilee or
Victoria taking India over from Dis
raeli or Victoria at this or that
ceremony.
The picture should rightly have
ended with Albert's death. The
film's worth lay only in the un
folding of royal marriage against the
pattern of the age, not in its func
tion as an animated lecture on
British policy. How Albert was
summoned by the court from Saxe-
Coburg, how Victoria proposed to
him, how her authority opened a
rift between them, and how finally
their romance deepened into great
devotion was wrought as richly and
fully as a human relationship in a
Tolstoi novel.
Those who put Prince Albert in
a class with the Smith Brothers as a
silent partner on a tobacco-can
trade-mark, will gain from Anton
Walbrook's performance a new slant
—will see Albert as a man of re
flection, intelligence, and quiet hu
mor. Carrying Victoria from an
imperious young girl through dod
dering old widowhood, Anna Neagle
was most apt in her portrayal of the
Queen in her middle age as a cock
sure matron with the slightly out
raged dignity of pouter pigeon. At
all times marked by gravity, both
interpretations were nevertheless no
more conscientious than human.
Free from dime-store glitter and
Zanuck ballyhoo, "Victoria the
Great," all told, is the most thought
fully produced and worthy biogra
phy from England since "Henry the
Eighth."—Slater.

folding of royal marriage against the
pattern of the age, not in its func
tion as an animated lecture on
British policy. How Albert was
summoned by the court from Saxe-
Coburg, how Victoria proposed to
him, how her authority opened a
rift between them, and how finally
their romance deepened into great
devotion was wrought as richly and
fully as a human relationship in a
Tolstoi novel.
Those who put Prince Albert in
a class with the Smith Brothers as a
silent partner on a tobacco-can
trade-mark, will gain from Anton
Walbrook's performance a new slant
—will see Albert as a man of re
flection, intelligence, and quiet hu
mor. Carrying Victoria from an
imperious young girl through dod
dering old widowhood, Anna Neagle
was most apt in her portrayal of the
Queen in her middle age as a cock
sure matron with the slightly out
raged dignity of pouter pigeon. At
all times marked by gravity, both
interpretations were nevertheless no
more conscientious than human.
Free from dime-store glitter and
Zanuck ballyhoo, "Victoria the
Great," all told, is the most thought
fully produced and worthy biogra
phy from England since "Henry the
Eighth."—Slater.


Thumbs Up
"Victoria the Great," currently
playing at the Clay International
Theater, S.F.:
Accuracy, that Janus of virtue and
vice in a historical film, reared its
double head in this latest Victorian
revival from England.
To its authenticity may be laid a
not inconsiderable part of its very
great artistry as cinema. Its fidel
ity in recreating the manners, modes,

and morals of a
famous era make
it an important
document. As for
costumes and
sets—the produc
ers went on rec
ord as "grateful"
for the use of five
or six of Eng
land's best castles

and everything else from the period
but the Queen's virtue itself.
On the other hand, history hap
pens not to fall in convenient sce
nario sequence. To this fact may
be credited the scrappy intrusion of
several episodes which broke the
unity of action, watered the fade
out, and generally bore no more
affinity for the plot than a feather
for a piece of scrap iron. Several
shots in very bad technicolor trailed
irrelevantly up the rear revealing
Victoria at her Diamond Jubilee or
Victoria taking India over from Dis
raeli or Victoria at this or that
ceremony.
The picture should rightly have
ended with Albert's death. The
film's worth lay only in the un
folding of royal marriage against the
pattern of the age, not in its func
tion as an animated lecture on
British policy. How Albert was
summoned by the court from Saxe-
Coburg, how Victoria proposed to
him, how her authority opened a
