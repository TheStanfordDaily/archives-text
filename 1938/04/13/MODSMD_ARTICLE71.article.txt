# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The $250,000 "balance available
for appropriations" which President
Wilbur's report to the Board of
Trustees revealed (Stanford Daily,
i April 11) seems rather odd in the
| light of an incident which occurred
1 late in February of this year. Or
i perhaps it isn't so strange when one
I reads a further statement in the re
port concerning the policy of "care
ful planning and control of expendi
tures" which the University insti
tuted to acquire this balance.
The incident to which I refer took
place late in February when our
| estimable administration, perhaps
j trying to maintain the above-men
i tioned balance, fired more than 25
j university workmen (carpenters,
painters, gardeners, etc.) on less
i than a day's notice. One particular
| employee whom I know said that
! he was unable to gather together his
[ tools before closing time, the notice
having been so short—and this par
ticular employee has been on the
' University payroll for over ten
years.
Of course if the University were
| in desperate financial condition, such
! curt firing could be considered de
| plorable but understandable. But in
the light of the presidential report,
one can only think that the firing of
these employees on such short no
! tice showed a remarkable lack of
fair-mindedness on the part of our
j administration. At least these Uni
! versity employees could have been

given, let us say, two weeks' notice.
Naturally, we have few—if any—
unionized employees here in our
so-called "liberal" university. One
wonders how long it will be before
University workmen will be organ
ized when our administration con
tinues ( its policy of "control of ex
penditures," using methods such a. c
employed late last February.
Lest this opinion be one-sided, I
should like personally to invite some
explanation in these columns of the
above-mentioned apparently unrea
sonable act of the University admin
istration. To date I have not been
able to find any answer to this
strange action in a university which
reports a quarter - million dollar
balance.

| estimable administration, perhaps
j trying to maintain the above-men
i tioned balance, fired more than 25
j university workmen (carpenters,
painters, gardeners, etc.) on less
i than a day's notice. One particular
| employee whom I know said that
! he was unable to gather together his
[ tools before closing time, the notice
having been so short—and this par
ticular employee has been on the
' University payroll for over ten
years.
Of course if the University were
| in desperate financial condition, such
! curt firing could be considered de
| plorable but understandable. But in
the light of the presidential report,
one can only think that the firing of
these employees on such short no
! tice showed a remarkable lack of
fair-mindedness on the part of our
j administration. At least these Uni
! versity employees could have been

given, let us say, two weeks' notice.
Naturally, we have few—if any—
unionized employees here in our
so-called "liberal" university. One
wonders how long it will be before
University workmen will be organ
ized when our administration con
tinues ( its policy of "control of ex
penditures," using methods such a. c
employed late last February.
Lest this opinion be one-sided, I
should like personally to invite some
explanation in these columns of the
above-mentioned apparently unrea
sonable act of the University admin
istration. To date I have not been
able to find any answer to this
strange action in a university which
reports a quarter - million dollar
balance.
Respectfully,
