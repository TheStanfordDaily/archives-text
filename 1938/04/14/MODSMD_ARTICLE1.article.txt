### BILL MILLIS 
TQHN L. LEWIS declared "open
season" upon the Roosevelt Ad
ministration yesterday for its fail
ure "to liquidate its campaign
promises" for the enactment of
wages and hours legislation, but of
more historic significance than that
political jockeying was his simul
taneous announcement that the first
constitutional convention of the
Committee for Industrial Organi
zation will be held early next fall.
When asked if the establishment
of a permanent organization
would make peace with the Amer
ican Federation of Labor more dif
ficult, the C.1.0. chieftain said
that he didn't want to talk about
the federation.
Philip Murray, of the Steel Work
ers Organizing Committee, and Sid
ney Hillman, president of the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers, will
set the time and place for the con
vention, which will adopt a consti
tution, elect officers, and probably
change the C.1.0.'s name. Lewis
added that "I don't know whether
the symbols will be changed. The
C.1.0. has come to mean something
in this alphabetical world."

While the House Labor Commit
tee continued work on two versions
of wage-hour legislation, which
may be reported out today, Lewis
pushed through a Washington
meeting of subordinates a resolu
tion saying that the C.1.0.'s "4,000,-
000 members will consider it a der
eliction of duty and a betrayal of
labor if Congress adjourns without
enacting a corhplete legislative re
covery program."
Work relief appropriation,
housing, and minimum wage and
hour regulations were put on the
C.1.0.'s legislative "must" list.
At the same time, Lewis de
nounced numerous government
agencies for making 80 per cent of
their purchases from firms "which
flagrantly violated the labor rela
tions act." Douglas Aircraft, Beth
lehem Steel, Electric Boat Co., New
York Shipbuilding Co., and Rem
ington-Rand were specifically
named in his blanket-statement that
nearly "every sweatshop employer
in the United States is the recipi
ent of substantial government con
tracts."
Significance of yesterday's de
velopments on the labor front is
not that the C.1.0. is planning in
dependent political action. For the
present, Lewis will continue to
exert pressure upon the New Deal.
In the future, he may return by
devious means to the Republican
party, whose ranks he left only
after 1932.

SPECULATION increased in
v Washington yesterday on the
probable contents of President Roo
sevelt's recovery-relief message to
Congress today and his national
"fireside chat." tonight (heard lo
cally on all chain radio stations at
7:45 o'clock).
One intimation, coming from
Congressional leaders after a two
hour conference wtih the Presi
dent. was that at least a portion
of the New Deal's proposed four
billion-dollar pump priming at
tack on the depression will be
financed through freeing part of
the government's sterilized gold
reserve.
Chairman Marriner S. Eccles of
the Federal Reserve Board argued
for such a plan before a Congres
sional committee yesterday, saying
that it. would not result in an in
creased public debt while creating
an inflationary psychology neces
sary to combat recession-born defla
tionary policies.

While the President signed a bill
increasing the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation's leading pow
ers, his demand that Congress re
tain the principles of the undivided
profits tax and high capital gains
levies in the new tax bill stirred
new revolt among Conservative
Democrats.
Senate leaders including Chair
man I*at Harrison of the finance
committee condemned the "amaz
ing procedure" of a letter from
the President which termed the
Senate's elimination of the prof
its tax and reduction in the capital
gains tax as "striking at the root
of fundamental principles of tax
ation."
