# Taxi-Dancing Considered For Carnival
## Kappas May Aid Phi Delt Concession 
### 
Taxi-dancing has appeared as the
latest idea under consideration for
the Sophomore Carnival, to be held
April 22, according to Stan Swaf
ford, publicity director.
Kappa sophomores, planning to
discontinue the ringing-a-live-duck
booth they ran last year, are re
ported considering a deal with the
Phi Delts. The latter house again is
featuring its dance concession of last
year, and the idea is for the women
to act as taxi-dancers, at a dime per
dance.
Plans at present, however, are
proceeding at a rather indefinite
rate, as Kappa seniors are reputed
not to favor the plan.
Theta Xi pledges will contribute
to the Convalescent Home cause
with their annual ducking at the
carnival. Repeating the house's per
formance last year, one of the frosh
brothers will be precipitated into an
icy pool each time baseballs hurled
by Farm marksmen strike a target
in the Theta Xi booth.
Among other concessions are
Manzanita's fortune telling, Gamma
Phi's bowling alley, Union's hot-dog
stand, and Tri-Delt's sale of can
died apples.
