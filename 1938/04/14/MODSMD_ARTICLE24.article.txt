# 'Kind Lady' To Open Run Tonight
## Kahn, Campbell Carry Leads in Melodrama Heberer Will Direct 
### 
"Kind Lady," the Division of
Speech and Drama's first production
this quarter, will open tonight at 8
o'clock for a three-day run.
Commenting on the forthcoming
melodrama, Director H. Miles Heb
erer yesterday declared, "This is tlx l
division's first modern presentation
this year, and it will be a popular
rather than a literary play."
Adapted from a Hugh Walpolw
short story, "Kind Lady" has been
presented on the London and New
York stages and in the motion pic
tures during recent seasons. The
plot reveals what happens when a
well-to-do, middle-aged lady asks a
young beggar in out of the London
cold on Christmas Eve.

Popular Melodrama
"Beneath the well-bred quiet of
the acting, a story of subdued hor
ror is told with agonizing suspense,"
is the way Brooks Atkinson, drama
ctitic for the New York Times,
termed the popular melodrama when
it was running on Broadway.
For the first time since Memorial
Hall has been opened the big cur
tain in the back of the main audi
torium will be dropped in order to
cut the house down to 16 rows. It
was announced that a small theater
is desirable for psychological drama,
but a big enough stage is not avail
able in the Little Theater, therefore
the dropped curtain is being util
ized.
All seats are on reserve and may
be secured in Room 202 of Memo
rial Hall or at the box office for 25
cents upon presentation of a student
body card. Regular admission with
out a card is 50 cents.

Commenting on the forthcoming
melodrama, Director H. Miles Heb
erer yesterday declared, "This is tlx l
division's first modern presentation
this year, and it will be a popular
rather than a literary play."
Adapted from a Hugh Walpolw
short story, "Kind Lady" has been
presented on the London and New
York stages and in the motion pic
tures during recent seasons. The
plot reveals what happens when a
well-to-do, middle-aged lady asks a
young beggar in out of the London
cold on Christmas Eve.

Popular Melodrama
"Beneath the well-bred quiet of
the acting, a story of subdued hor
ror is told with agonizing suspense,"
is the way Brooks Atkinson, drama
ctitic for the New York Times,
termed the popular melodrama when
it was running on Broadway.
For the first time since Memorial
Hall has been opened the big cur
tain in the back of the main audi
torium will be dropped in order to
cut the house down to 16 rows. It
was announced that a small theater
is desirable for psychological drama,
but a big enough stage is not avail
able in the Little Theater, therefore
the dropped curtain is being util
ized.
All seats are on reserve and may
be secured in Room 202 of Memo
rial Hall or at the box office for 25
cents upon presentation of a student
body card. Regular admission with
out a card is 50 cents.
