### 
Bob Mason, manager of the
Speaker's Bureau, announced yes
terday that all those interested in
becoming tryoutees for positions on
the bureau should see him in his
office between the hours of 9-10
o'clock and 4-6 o'clock today.
All tryoutees will be trying for
eventual managership of the bu
reau. It is fairly certain, Mason said,
that starting next year, members
will be given the same University
credits as are given for debating.
The bureau is making out a new
list of speakers for fall, and try
outees will go before a review
board to try out for places on the
list. This speakers' list is sent to 225
other speaking clubs with pictures
and descriptions of the abilities of
those speakers selected for the list.
Speakers are chosen from this list
to be sent out to speak for service
clubs and business organizations.
According to Mason, the Speak
ers' Bureau offers the opportunity
for students to make contacts with
business men by speaking before
business groups.
