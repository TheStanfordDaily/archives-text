# Peace Advocate Airs 'Collective Security'
## 
### 
Editor's Note: America's peace
advocates divide rather evenly in
to two camps, and their opposing
stands probably will be a feature
of the discussions on Peace Day,
April -7.
One side agitates for "Collective
Security," joint action by United
States and other democracies to
crack down on the belligerent na
tions with economic and. if neces
sary. military pressure. The other
says, "Stay out of it."
Today, Otis Bruhaker, political
science assistant, is pitching for
Collective Security; tomorrow.
Hill Millis will take (he mound for
the other side.
