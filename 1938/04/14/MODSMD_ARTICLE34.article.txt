"We, the people of today's world,
in order to form a more perfect
union, to establish justice, and to
secure the blessings of Peace for
ourselves and posterity, do hereby
set forth on a course of collective
endeavor to achieve these goals."
So might we state the only logical
course of action open to the nations
in the crisis which they now face
and will continue to face until they
make such action a permanent fea
ture of their inescapable bargaining
for power.
It seems needless to point out that
our world cannot be an isolated one.
Techniques, invention, communica
tion, human need, ideologies know
no national boundaries. Economic
self-sufficiency can be bought only
at the price of uneconomic produc
tion, of more uneconomic division of
that product, of a decided lower
mass standard of living. It is to
this retreat that isolationism on
both the political and economic
front would inevitably lead us.
Isolation Impossible
Even so, say our isolationists,
"war is the supreme folly of all. It
settles nothing; it breeds only war."
The choice today is not between iso
lation and war. It lies between col
lective action to stop war, to make
the economic readjustment necessary
for any sort of peace in a nationalist
world—this on the one hand—or an
impossible national isolation, on the
other hand, which would inevitably
lead to war.
A policy of isolation has two
glaring fallacies: First, it fails to
remove any of the economic causes
of war, i.e., improper distribution of
natural resources, closed world mar
kets, and high tariff walls.
Second, it tries to avoid the po
litical foupt of war. To elucidate:
Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese
militarists are pursuing a policy
which can lead only to war. They
have mobilized industry and their

people. And for what? To take ad
vantage of a world that is unorgan
ized, to seize land by the use of the
Fascist technique of undeclared
war, to bluff the world into making
concessions which would strengthen
the dictatorships, and finally to de
stroy democracy under cover of
making a holy war on Communism.
Neutrality Futile
It is from those three nations that
comes the threat of international
conflagrations. They are not isola
tionist, nor will they long let Amer
ica remain that way.
No war referendum, peace pledge,
or so-called neutrality act can keep
us out of war. The aggression comes
from the other side. Our only sal
vation lies in collective action, in
sanctions, in counter-bluffing which
will destroy politically and econom
ically those same dictatorships.
Policy Required
Today collective security means
denial of loans to aggressors, help to
Spain and China in their struggle
against the attacks of dictators, and
i economic embargoes against Ger
many, Italy, and Japan if they per
sist in their threat to peace. Think
| not that we can kill dictators with
' kindness.
Collective security may seem
idealistic to some; it is not. It is a
realistic attempt to bring world pol
itics into line with world economic
conditions and needs, to apply an
intelligent social technique to a
problem whose immensity has hith
erto led us to stumble blindly from
war to war.
May Prevent War
True, this may (and, again, may
not) lead to war, but an unintelli
gent, uneconomic policy of isolation
! can lead to nothing except war, for
it attempts not to change conditions
but to defy them and deny their
existence.
It will help us little to turn os
trich and bury our heads in the
sands because the winds of war are
blowing; for the wind will blow
away the sand, disclosing our nak
edness and cowardice and leaving
us with only a barren world in
which to live unless we try—at least
try—to stop the wind before it de
velops hurricane proportions.
