# Burrows Runs Mile in 4:18.3; Malott Wins
## Quarter-miler Ties 300-yard Record In Practice Run 
### 
Captain Ray Malott and Edson
Burrows poured a little extra
"urnph" into their workouts yester
day on Angell Field and both set
Coach Dink Templeton's eyes agog.
Malott won a special 300-yard dash
from Stan Hiserman by seven yards
in 30.6, a time which set Don Lieb
endorfer, news service director,
delving through the record books.
He came up with the information
that Malott had tied the world rec
ord set by Bernie Wefers way back
in 189(5.
His record book only carried
through 1934, the question being
whether 30.G has been broken in the
past four years. Malott's race was
just a practice run and was strictly
unofficial.
It was really Burrows who pro
vided yesterday's thrill. Lanky Ed
raced Norm Bright, Chuck Nimmo,
former Farm great; and Marton
Girard, San Mateo J.C.'s speedy
distance man, in a practice mile
spin.
Burrows took an immediate lead,
followed by Bright, Girard, and
Nimmo in that order. For three
laps the positions remained un
changed, but Nimmo dropped out
after the third lap as the remaining
men sprinted for the tape. Coming
into the home stretch. Bright put on
a tremendous sprint, but a last
lunge at the tape by red-headed Ed
gave him a schnozzle victory. Time,
a mere 4:18.3, which lacks .2 of
being' Burrows' best time.
Jerry Sparling beat Dick Carew
in a 100-yard practice heat in 10.2.
Today San Jose State will work
out with Stanford. No points will be
