r pHE California track squad has j
been falling for the same old
psychology for so many years you'd 1
think they'd get wise to it, and if j
you'd think so it might seem you j
are right this time.
Year after year the metropolitan
dailies have built up the Cal outfit, j
and each year the Bears are not i
around when Big Meet comes. If
you'll look back to last year you will i
remember that the California cin- .
der team was the second best col- ,
lege dual meet team in the country, ]
until Stanford knocked her ears 1
down, as usual.
But this spring they started the
same thing all over again, and
even now there are those who are I
still picking California to whip
Stanford a little more than a week
hence.
Wally Fredericks, the Bear pub- J
licity man, is doing a little to dis
sipate the feeling that Stanford
might just as well concede the Meet
—his office sent out a dLspatch this
week in which a coldly logical dope
sheet shows how Stanford can score
71 points.
Since this is the first effort within
memory's span to bring California
into the underdog role foi the Meet,
it's worth squinting at.
Fredericks gives Stanford nine
first places—loo, 220, 440, high
and low hurdles, shot, discus, pole
vault, and high jump. lie no doubt
is hoping for upsets in the low
hurdles, with George Anderson
over Stan Hiserman; in the high
jump, with l aw or Canning over
Wullf; and in the pole vault, with
Monroe over Boore.
There is a great chance for ties in
two jumps, but as for Anderson
beating Hiserman — well, he has
I made a remarkable comeback, but
! Hiserman has made as remarkable
j an original rise and still has better
! time.
The Bear drum-beater makes
' what we might consider one mis
| take, in giving Ed Burrows only sec
! onds in the mile and two-mile. Fol
! lowing his reasoning, if Burrows is
J going to be able to run second in
! the two-mile after running the mile,
! then Big Ed will score a first and
| second. Burrows has better winning
J time in the mile than any Bear
I available, and he's running with
confidence this season.
In addition to the two distance
grinds, Fredericks gives Stanford
seconds in the highs, 880, shot,
javelin, discus, and broad jump.
Here again he can't hope for up
sets in some, but he surely must
be praying for places in the 880,
highs, javelin, and broad jump.
Incidentally, this sheet is made out
with the consideration that Arnold
I Nutting, injured Bear sprinter, will
J not be able to win either sprint
j event. Coach Hamilton labels him a
doubtful starter.
Hawkins should be able to take
| care of himself in the hurdles, and
i you never can tell about Grant
I Stone in the javelin. He might not
place and he might win the thing,
j Ray Brown ought to get out a fair
; leap in the broad jump for second—
I on his past performances we know
I that he is capable of a victory, if
| he'd only hit his stride.
Carl Mahurin is given second in
j the 880, between YVieman and
I Modisette. Last year Carl got up
oIT a Rest Home cot and handed
i Weiinan a trimming in the half.
He has a better chance this year,,
not being sick at present, but he
still isn't in shape and Weiinan
has improved mightily.
; Stanford has some men that Fred
: ericks hasn't and can't very well
consider in his dope sheet, since
I they haven't done much, but they'll
|be around, and something might
j happen. Stan Andersen in the
I weights, Sumner Gill in the pole
I vault, and others may surprise.
We might just as well call the Big
I Meet the toss-up that is ,and let it
I go at that.

! Hiserman has made as remarkable
j an original rise and still has better

' what we might consider one mis

! lowing his reasoning, if Burrows is
J going to be able to run second in

J not be able to win either sprint
j event. Coach Hamilton labels him a

I on his past performances we know

Carl Mahurin is given second in

He has a better chance this year,,

sipate the feeling that Stanford

71 points.

into the underdog role foi the Meet,
it's worth squinting at.

and low hurdles, shot, discus, pole
vault, and high jump. lie no doubt
is hoping for upsets in the low
hurdles, with George Anderson
over Stan Hiserman; in the high

Carl Mahurin is given second in
j the 880, between YVieman and
I Modisette. Last year Carl got up
oIT a Rest Home cot and handed
i Weiinan a trimming in the half.
He has a better chance this year,,
not being sick at present, but he
still isn't in shape and Weiinan
has improved mightily.
; Stanford has some men that Fred
: ericks hasn't and can't very well
consider in his dope sheet, since
I they haven't done much, but they'll
|be around, and something might
j happen. Stan Andersen in the
I weights, Sumner Gill in the pole
I vault, and others may surprise.
We might just as well call the Big
I Meet the toss-up that is ,and let it
I go at that.
