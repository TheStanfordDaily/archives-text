## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Trojan Nine Trips Indians S.C. Ekes Out Win on Error In Ninth Inning 
### JERRY HAWLEY 
An error by First Baseman Tom
Kiliefer in the ninth inning allowed
Pitcher Lou Crosby of U.S.C. to
score from second base with the
winning run yesterday, as Sam Bar
ry's Trojans nosed out Stanford's
baseballers, 6-5, on the Sunken
Diamond.
Trailing 5-1 in the seventh inn
ing, the Indians rallied to tie the
count when Tom Farrell and Dick
Tam walked and Bill Jameson
doubled to score Farrell. Wally de-
Witt, batting for Fred Furman,
singled to send Tam across the
plate, and successive singles by Jim
my Coffis and Bob Matthews tallied
Jameson and Dale Reimer, who ran
for deWitt.
The Cards took the lead in the
first inning when Bill Clark slashed
a single to left, scoring Bob Mat
thews, who had singled and ad
vanced to second when Killefer
walked.
Stanford filled the bases in the
final frame with no one out, but
Jack Brewer, who relieved starting
pitcher Lou Crosby, set Killefer,
Clark, and Farrell down in order to
squelch the rally.
