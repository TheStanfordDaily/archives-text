# Dramatic Possibilities

AROUND a university, "proselyte" usually is
considered a very nasty word. But Tues
day night, Stagers gave the term a twist which
almost qualifies it to be included in the Boy
Scout oath.
In order to prepare for possible lean years
ahead on the technical end of dramatics, Stagers
proposed to offer a $500 scholarship from their
own pocket to a student majoring in the Division
of Speech and Drama. In return for the gift, he
will be expected to spend a goodly amount of
lime pitching ball for Stanford dramatics. Fair
onough.
Besides buttering its own bread, Stagers'
proposition looks like a good deal for Stanford
n the publicity it will bring, in better dramatics,
and in value received for profits on student
shows.
But more important are the potential results
of a scholarship for specially talented students
whose virtues do not include booting a football
30 yards. Coming from the students as it does,
Stagers' step to put the specially talented stu
dent on the pay-rolls is an especially good one.
It would not distress us at all to hear that
ihey were accused of stealing a second Guthrie
McClintock from S.C. by promising him their
'at scholarship. Nor would it pain us to hear that
ihe glee clubs had just signed up a tenor who
can hit high C.
Much of Stanford's publicity and all of its
campus activities depend upon such specially
talented students as Stagers hopes to import.
A little proselyting to bring them here is more
>han logical—it is a paying proposition.—l. S.
