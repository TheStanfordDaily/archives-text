# What Hall-Row Split?
## 
### 
WHEN A.S.S.U. President Tom Killefer told
his Luncheon Club audience that the fa
mous Hall-Row split was unimportant except in
politics, he shocked no one. Stanford hasn't
iaken the distinction between Row and Hall
seriously since the days when bustles were in
flower.
But Killefer's statement may be relieving to
a few harassed freshmen who still think that
bayonets are issued with every fraternity pin.
And it may be annoying to some of those
knights of the pasteboards who have spent their
college lives in the back rooms of fraternity
houses.
The Hall-Row split has no social significance.
It is a useful political mechanism, but after
election week it is put back onto the shelf,
marked "not to be opened until next year."
We have to have some sort of a division in
the student body because we are fond of our
toy, self-government; and our government can
not work without parties. Division by living
groups is the simplest, most natural, and easiest
method.
But the best student officers are those who
ignore Hall or Row affiliations. History shows
this. Killefer himself showed it in the last elec
tion by refusing to touch politics. The worst at
tack we can make on an officer is that he is
distributing jobs according to affiliation.
And socially there is no split. While Killefer
was speaking, Hall and Row men in his audi
ence were trading ham sandwiches for cheese.
Freshmen who are worried about having to
join a guerilla war next year can relax and
enjoy the canoeing. The feud is just a Fred
Allen-Jack Benny gag.—J. C.
