SUBTLETY, it seems, is not our strongest point,
though we try so hard. We were found out
by a couple of fine brains who told us we had
supported Bill Hawkins for A.S.S.U. president

election.
A number of refusals to damn caucuses or
to play up the "Row Split."
That was hard; the other was easy. For every
one knows that The Daily has always written
its own Campus Opinions.
