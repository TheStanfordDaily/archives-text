# Three-fold Peace
## 
### 
PEACE, today, is right on top of us. On page
two Otis Brubaker is expounding his kind
of peace. In "Another Man's View" a U.C.L.A.
editorial writer wonders about it all. In the
Campus Opinion column, Chuck Schafer tells
Marco Thome about some improvements he
could add to the War Memorial idea.
Maybe we won't get anywhere, but v/e're
sure trying.
