SIDELINE ANNOYANCE
NOVVING Bellwether's capacity for rationalization,
I was not surprised to have him hail me cheerily
in front of the Libe yesterday morning, apparently not
at all upset by the collapse of his determined and un
precedented bid for the presidency of the Associated
Students.
"It was a great fight," he began at once, "a great
fight, The people have once more shown themselves
aware of the high responsibility which is theirs, have
once more stated their firm resolve to uphold democ
racy and—do they still elect a Masque Ball King?"
"No, Bellwether!" I said, "and thank heaven they
don't. I suppose you were surprised at the result?"
He shrugged.
"Somebody has to win. I suppose in the end it all
works out for the best. As a matter of fact, I was a
good deal taken aback to learn that I had gotten any
votes at all."
"That's a fine thing to say after the way you worked
for them. All those caucuses —those campaign prom
ises "
"Mere twaddle. Child's play. Caucuses go for 5
cents a dozen before election, and campaign promises
are traditional but not much more. You don't think I
really wanted the office, do you?"
"Well, maybe you didn't, but you certainly dem
onstrated a pretty frantic aloofness."
"I'm afraid you misinterpreted my actions, a fate
which sooner or later befalls all great men. On the
whole, I thought the election turned out very well.
A fairly even balance of success on both sides, which
should result in a more or less equal control of gov
ernment and patronage. About all one can hope for,
I suppose, under our set-up; and perhaps not too
bad."
"So you have no regrets?"
"None. It was a great fight, to repeat."
"And Lee was perhaps a little more solid, as a
candidate?"
"And as a man, as a matter of fact. A good man.
All good men. None the equal of Bellwether, of
course, but—you know how it is. And now I must be
off. I haven't studied since a week ago Monday.
That's what politics does to you."
"Well, I hope you take the lesson to heart, and
don't enter anything else of a competitive nature. It's
all I can do to keep up with you under ordinary con
ditions, let alone in the middle of a campaign."
"I'll take the matter under advisement. The only
thing in the whole affair that bothered me in the
least was The Daily's reference to 'sideline annoy
ance.' That went deep. Goodbye, and remember
this: What comes after 53?"
"Fifty-four."
"Forty or fight! Adios."
