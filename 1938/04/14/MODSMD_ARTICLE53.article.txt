(Like Stanford, U.S.C. seems to be looking at
the coming Peace Day with a speculative eye.
The following is extracted from the editorial col
umn of the Daily Trojan.)

W/HILE most of the world talks of war, the trend of
conversation in the United States is peace—and
how to maintain it. This speaks well for the civilized
futurd of our nation, and is an apparent indication
that this country has had its fill of organized blood
shed. It is satisfying to realize that our national group
is, generally speaking, pacifistic in character.
But, actually, just how pacifistic are we? Is the
cry for peace actually a manifestation of a sincere
craving, or of a popular craze?
This writer believes that three-fourths of the sheep
like people who are exhorting the glory of peace are
doing so because, like operations, peace now comes
in the category of "the thing to talk about." Peace
has reached the too-loud point of popularity.
A "peace poll" taken on the U.S.C. campus dur
ing the past few days showed a large number of
voters who indicated that they would "never" fight
in any war, under any possible circumstances. The
sincerity of these individuals is not doubted—only
their ability to adhere to their idealistic principles.
Many of them have jumped on the band-wagon of
peace for the simple reason that they do not want to
be considered different from their fellows. If the
bandwagon is converted into a battlewagon, and that,
too, is popular, they will not bother to jump off.
The real danger of this present popularity of
peace, as this writer sees it, is its fad-like aspects. Is
the Pacifistic Way to be doomed by a sudden rush to
popularity, and an even more giddy descent into con
versational oblivion? Anything which becomes a fad
must run the risk of short life, for fads are spon
sored by the short-sighted, easily-changed portion of
the group. That faction is composed of the same per
sons who flocked to mah-jong parties in the '20s, and
miniature golf courses in the early '30s.
In order to preserve the real ideals behind the
pacifistic movement, this hysterical side of its pro
motion must be cut short. Will the sane-thinking
portion of the populace realize this necessity of cor
rectly approaching the problem of maintaining peace,
or will the butterfiy-minded faction swerve the na
tion away from its objective, to chase, half-rocked, in
pursuit of a new mode of insanity?

shed. It is satisfying to realize that our national group
is, generally speaking, pacifistic in character.
But, actually, just how pacifistic are we? Is the
cry for peace actually a manifestation of a sincere
craving, or of a popular craze?
This writer believes that three-fourths of the sheep
like people who are exhorting the glory of peace are
doing so because, like operations, peace now comes
in the category of "the thing to talk about." Peace
has reached the too-loud point of popularity.
A "peace poll" taken on the U.S.C. campus dur
ing the past few days showed a large number of
voters who indicated that they would "never" fight
in any war, under any possible circumstances. The
sincerity of these individuals is not doubted—only
their ability to adhere to their idealistic principles.
Many of them have jumped on the band-wagon of
peace for the simple reason that they do not want to
be considered different from their fellows. If the
bandwagon is converted into a battlewagon, and that,
too, is popular, they will not bother to jump off.
The real danger of this present popularity of
peace, as this writer sees it, is its fad-like aspects. Is
the Pacifistic Way to be doomed by a sudden rush to
popularity, and an even more giddy descent into con
versational oblivion? Anything which becomes a fad
must run the risk of short life, for fads are spon
sored by the short-sighted, easily-changed portion of
the group. That faction is composed of the same per
sons who flocked to mah-jong parties in the '20s, and
miniature golf courses in the early '30s.
In order to preserve the real ideals behind the
pacifistic movement, this hysterical side of its pro
motion must be cut short. Will the sane-thinking
portion of the populace realize this necessity of cor
rectly approaching the problem of maintaining peace,
or will the butterfiy-minded faction swerve the na
tion away from its objective, to chase, half-rocked, in
pursuit of a new mode of insanity?
(Like Stanford, U.S.C. seems to be looking at
the coming Peace Day with a speculative eye.
The following is extracted from the editorial col
umn of the Daily Trojan.)

W/HILE most of the world talks of war, the trend of
conversation in the United States is peace—and
how to maintain it. This speaks well for the civilized
futurd of our nation, and is an apparent indication
that this country has had its fill of organized blood
shed. It is satisfying to realize that our national group
is, generally speaking, pacifistic in character.
But, actually, just how pacifistic are we? Is the
