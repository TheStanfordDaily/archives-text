# Odets' Play 'Golden Boy' Scores Hit
## 
### 
"Gulden Boy," currently play
ing at San Francisco's Curran:
Like a two-fisted poet from some
grimy Twentieth Century Parnas
sus, Clifford Odets this week hits the
San Francisco stage with the most
brilliant theater of the season.
Granted that the Bronx, in which
"Golden Boy" is set, is no pastoral

paradise, granted
that its denizens,
about whom Mr.
Odets writes, are
coarse, smutty,
and profane. Yet
slammed down in
the lurid idiom of
the day, "Golden
Boy's" every line
has grandeur, ca-

dence, poetry. Its theme is a gritty
Bronx lyric.
"Golden Boy's" story takes up
the career of Joe Bonaparte, young
Italian from the Bronx. Joe has big
musical ambitions. But there's no
money in art these days—Joe knows
that. After all, he figures if he has
a flashy car and a big name, nobody
can laugh at him any more.
So to square his grudge against
the world, Joe goes into the fight
game. Pretty soon he cracks his
knuckles so he can't play the violin
any more. After that, he kills a
man in the ring. But Joe wins the
championship crown, all right. And
he buys himself a snappy Dusen
berg. That's all there is to it—the
old stuff about self-betrayal and
bitter frustration.
But in this far-fetched and slight
ly absurd story, every character
glitters like a diamond in a Third
Street pawn shop. Francis Lederer,
as the tragic and stormy young
fighter, Betty Furness, as his sweet
heart, the tender, tough little
"tramp from Newark," Lee J. Cobb
as Joe's pathetic old peddler father,
and Sam White, as the back-scratch
ing, sniggering joker in the pack,
wring out of "Golden Boy" all its
pathos and humour.
For its compassion, its dramatic
impact, and its alert production,
"Golden Boy" is a great show.
