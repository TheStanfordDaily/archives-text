(Editor's Note: Rigid spacc lim
itations have made it necessary in
the past to select Campus Opinion
letters for length (or lack of it)
rather than interest. Writers
wishing to see their brain children
in print would do well in the fu
ture to keep their letters below
250 words.)
The Editor, Sir:
The weak point in Cobbs' logic
about this game of politics is that
he holds politics as practiced in a
democracy as his standard. Nat
urally such a comparison makes us
well pleased with the way things go
here on the Farm. The point at is
sue is that a university should be
the breeding place of ideas which
make for improvements over what is
found in our democracy. Cobbs
says we are doing what is possible
to improve the system; in truth, at
present we are only preparing fight
ers to carry on in the same manner
as their fathers have.
It is possible to have ideals. They
are not the possession of only im
practical people. Even some gi-cat
thinkers have had them. Think of
Plato.
Yours Truly
The Editor, Sir:
It's absurd, silly, and useless, this
war memorial that Marco Thome,
"Veteran of Future War," proposes.
Its location, where only wandering
lovers out behind Lagunita will ever
see it, makes it even less desirable.
Maybe his idea was to get some
thing as useless as war itself. Most
of them are.
But as long as we, the living, are
all going to get our names inscribed
on its face in two-foot lettering, I'd
like to see the thing put out where
people could see and admire — out
under the shade of a new apple
tree. And let its massive monolithic
wall cast their shadows on an in
terror decorated to be of some use
to the living.
Beer Parlor
I propose that the tribute be made
to accommodate a beer parlor; or if

you can't stomach that, how about
the place being fitted as a real nit
ery, with all the atmosphere that
Franich or Bill Ward could hope
for? As long as it's a war memorial
let's have shining glass cases filled
with mummies, bloody bayonets,
grimy daggers, grisley pictures from
the front line trenches, and several
statues of dying soldiers hanging on
barbed wire with their guts falling
out.
These cases and tables should
have plenty of places for one to set
beer glasses, and the card tables
should have their surfaces covered
with more pictures, all protected
under glass.
Rendezvous
Sammy Simoes has some dandies
taken in the International Settle
ment last summer—a platform cov
ered with parts of arms and hands is
the neatest and he'd be glad to do
nate some of the feet.
This little rendezvous would be
just the place to go to get cheered
up after watching the parade of the
angels in the library, and a new
sort of place to take a date. If the
displays were really good, it would
be the nuts at night with a few low
lights.
So let's have a useful memorial
and get it now, not after we're push
ing up daisies.
Laughingly yours,
Chuck Shafer
