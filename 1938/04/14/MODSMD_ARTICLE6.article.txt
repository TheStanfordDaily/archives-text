# Cardinals Shift Drive Schedule
## R.O.T.C. Inspection Advanced One Week 
### 
Shifting Convalescent Home Drive
dates into what they consider the
final schedule, Cardinals last night
moved Labor Day to Wednesday,
May 4.
The change was made possible by
R.O.T.C. officials' decision to hold
their general inspection, which had
conflicted, a week earlier.
Schedule of drive activities is as
follows:
Soph Carnival, April 22; Tag Day,
May 2; Bean Day, Strawberry
Brunch, May 3; Labor Day, Jolly-up,
Barbecue, ping-pong finals, May 4;
bowling finals (tentative), May 5;
Junic# Water Carnival, Masque Ball,
May 6.
Don Mulford is being considered
as Masque Ball orchestra, said Chair
man Jan North. Investigation of his
reported union difficulties was de
cided necessary, although some
members asked "Who cares?" and
"What can they do to him?" Ed Bar
net suggested that it would be em
barrassing to have orchestra plans
fall through the night before the
dance.
Jan North reported that the
Masque Ball's kid party theme had
been sanctioned on condition that
no obscene costumes be worn. Con
sensus about costumes worn to for
mer kid parties was "they weren't
obscene—they were cute."
Because Ex Committee Tuesday
refused to grant $15 for a tea for
250 members of the Northern Cali
fornia Japanese International Col
legiate Advance, who visited the
campus Saturday, it looked for a
while as if they would have no tea.
Cardinals last night passed a vote
of thanks to faculty wives who filled
the breach, serving tea to the N.C.J.
I.C.A. They are Mrs. J. W. Mcßain,
Mrs. Payson Treat, Mrs. W. L.
Schwartz, and Mrs. Hobart Young.
