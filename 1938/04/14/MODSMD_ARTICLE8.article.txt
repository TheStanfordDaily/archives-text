# Branner, Toyon Hold Sale of 'Antiques'
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
Need any pipes, chairs, books, or
phonograph records today?
There is plenty of everything for
everybody in Branner's dining hall,
where a gigantic rummage sale is
going on.
For sale are articles of all types
and sizes which have been accumu
lating dust and cobwebs in Toyon
and Branner storerooms.
If your eating club or fraternity
needs an intramural baseball plaque
in very good shape, there's one
waiting for an offer.
Prices Reasonable
Although most articles arc priced,
any reasonable offer will be ac
cepted— subject to concerted hag
gling, though — according to Ray
Sullivan, Branner student custod
ian, and Ed Hinkle, Toyon student
custodian, who are managing the
sale.
Oldest st or aged article on sale
was a solid walnut, brass-bound
linen chest -put away in 1924. It
went for $5.
The book department has the
honor of containing the most ancient
piece of goods. It's a two-volume
1 edition of Prescott's "Conquest of

| Peru," published in 1857.
"No sale on that, one, though," j
J commented Sullivan. "We're going i
j to give it to the library."
Other books, which are priced j
from 10 cents to $1, include many j
language, fiction, and humorous
tomes. There is a first edition, too. |
It's Wigmore's "Evidence," publish- I
cd in 1904.
This rummage, Sullivan believes,)
is the first since 1924. Up to that
lime it was an annual affair.
Out of nine phonographs offered, j
j there arc now two left. One of those
sold had an original cost of $375 —it
was bought in 1920, according to a
bill found inside. Yesterday, it
brought $5.
