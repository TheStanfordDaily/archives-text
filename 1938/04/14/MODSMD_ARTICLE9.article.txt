# Former Comptroller Talks at Union Dinner

### KATHERINE JOHNSEN 
Speaking on "Waterfront Beefs" (rows), Ahnon E. Roth, former Uni
versity Comptroller, returned to the campus last night to tell the Union
women and members of the faculty attending the Club's annual formal
dinner of his experiences its "front" man for the San Francisco shipowners.
Mr. Roth remarked that probably the only difference between water
front men and himself was that he got an athletic scholarship, and they

didn't; so he went to college,
they didn't.
Turning to the serious aspects of
the strike situation, Mr. Roth cited
figures which showed the cost of the
last 98-day strike equivalent to the
cast of the construction of the Bay
Bridge plus the Golden Gate Bridge
plus the "Hoover" Dam (which is
still the "Hoover" Dam to him).
"If the strike could have been
settled 10 days sooner," he said, "the
public would have been saved
enough money to build the Golden
Gate Bridge.
"The hope of the shipowners is
that laborers will see that the same
goose lays the golden egg for both
the employers and the employees.
The most disheartening factor is that
labor leaders are chosen, not be
cause they are good at arbitrating
troubles, but because they ai'e good
at making trouble â€” getting bacon
from the shipowners and bringing it
home to the boys."
Mr. Roth was first popularized
along the front as the "Son of the
Stanford 'Reds'," after he had ex
pressed several anti - communistic
ideas. Later, in cartoons he was pic
tured as a matronly woman with a
sunbonnet and careworn expression,
tending to several babies (the ship
owners).
