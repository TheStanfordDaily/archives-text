### BILL MILLIS 
"YK/E MUST sail, not lie at an
chor; sail, not drift" towards
"a greater, stable, more tolerant
America," President Roosevelt de
clared in a nationally-broadcast ra
dio "fireside chat"delivered last
night. His address was the opening
of a battle for popular support for
the New Deal's three to four billion
dollar lending-spending drive on
depression.
Foreseeing a "long steady up
ward incline in national income,
the President admitted that "it is
going to cast something to get out
of this depression." lie urged
avoidance of overproduction and
overs peculation, which he termed
"the pitfalls and extremes of 1!)29."
Increased government spending
was likened to a "trigger" that would
set off private business activity.
Warning that "government cannot
afford to wait until it has lost the
power to act," Mr. Roosevelt con
cluded that "we need a united na
tional will" to deal with the eco
nomic depression confronting the
nation.

Yesterday was a full work day
for the President, since during the
morning he delivered a Pan-Amer
ican day address and later read a
message to Congress outlining his
business pump-priming plans. The
former speech warned "aggressor"
nations that the United States is de
termined to keep the peace in both
Americas and will not allow any
attacks upon the principles of
"democratic liberty" in this hemis
phere.
With a probable eye to the future,
he said that the peoples of North
and South America must be pre
pared to sacrifice even their lives to
preserve hard-won democracy and
independence.

WHILE the Treasury freed $1,391,-
000.000 in sterilized gold towards
the initiation of the Administra
tion's $4,512,000,000 recovery-relief
program, heated criticism of New
Deal plans developed among the
same powerful Congressional co
alition of conservatives from both
parties that lately scuttled the gov
ernment reorganization bill. They
assailed "further unbridled federal
spending" and lack of satisfactory
reassurances to business.
General objective of Mr. Roose
velt's plan is to increase national
income from 50 to around SO bil
lion dollars annually, through
maintenance of relief, expansion
of credit, and revival of public
works and increased funds for
present New Deal recovery agen
cies.
Administration leaders in the
House are basing their hopes for
early legislative enactment of this
program upon Congress' past sup
port of "heavy spending," and the
desire of members to adjourn well
ahead of the approaching mid-term
elections.
