# Thompson Named Drive Treasurer
## Cardinals' Selection Of Rice's Successor Needs Excom's Okay 
### 
Appointment of Roy Thompson as
treasurer of the Convalescent Home
Drive was anounced yesterday by
Mark Hopkins, president of Cardi
nals. The selection is subject to Ex
Committee approval.
Cardinals made the appointment
Wednesday night to fill the position
left by John Rice, who resigned last
week because of insufficient time.
Thompson said yesterday he is
ready to go forward with plans for
the campaign as soon as he has been
approved as treasurer.
Meanwhile, Beth Allen and Jim
Ransohoff, co-chairmen of the off
campus drive, announced approxi
mately half of the students who will
work on their committee.
These solicitors, working in pairs,
will canvass Palo Alto residents and
also faculty members living on cam
pus, Ransohoff explained. Their
campaign is to last from May 2 to 5.
"Our soliciting will all be done in
the evenings, from 7 to 9 o'clock,"
Ransohoff said. "We plan to have
a dinner for the committee the first
night to start things off."
Next week he plans to arrange
with Palo Alto police for solicitors'
permits. "It's more to assure the
people we visit than to protect our
selves from any city ordinance," he
explained.
John Wicket has undertaken the
job of zoning the city, laying out an
area of about four blocks square
for each pair of canvassers.
The following couples have al
ready been named to the committee:
