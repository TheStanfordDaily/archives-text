With the suggestion that it be
used to establish a scholarship, a
balance of approximately $500 to
$600 made from the recent alumni
production of Maxwell Anderson's
"Star Wagon" in Memorial Hall will
be given to the Division"' of Speech
and Drama, it was announced by
the Alumni Play Committee yes
terday.
Approximately $800 was cleared
on the production. "The use to
which this money will be put is en
tirely up to the division," said Nor
ris James, member of the commit
tee and editor of the Stanford Illus
trated Review, in announcing the
gift. "The committee's recommenda
tion is in no way a regulation as to
its expenditure."
Plans for establishment of a Na
tional Alumni Play Committee to
aid in the annual production of
plays similar to this year's produc
tion April 1 and 2 were also re
vealed. Members of this committee

prominent in radio and drama work,

be able to secure rights to produc
tions in the future which are of the
same quality as "Star Wagon."
