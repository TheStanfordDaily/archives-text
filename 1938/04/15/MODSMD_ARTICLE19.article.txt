## Novel Races, Floats Will Be Featured 
### 
Plans made by the Junior Execu
| live Committee last night for the
j Water Carnival will include more
! prizes than have ever been offered
: before, new contest ideas, novelty
j races, and will feature some differ
j ent float ideas.
"We wanted something new and
i different," Dave Ryus, junior class
I president, told the committee mem
bers, "and we've got it."
Among the features to be offered
will be Roy Winkleman's diving
i exhibition from the high platform,
J comic dives by Ken Cuthbertson and
j Bob Coffin, a trick balloon race for
I women only, and a nightgown race.
40 Prizes Offered
Posibility of having a log-rdlling
contest was dismissed when Ryus
wanted to know what they were
going to use for logs.
Barbara Day and Chappie Stearns,
I tio-chairmen of the prize committee,
J reported that they had approxi-
I mately 40 prizes which would be
given to the contest winners.
"Gosh," said Ryus upon hearing
| the information, "maybe we ought
j tests; then we could have enough
j prizes left over so that each mem
! ber of the committee could have
one."
Junior Day Planned
| The idea of having a Junior Day
| was bi'ought up before the com
< mittee and was received favorably,
j Members thought it would be a good
| idea to have some function that
; would make the junior class con-
I scious of its entity, and decided that
> it would be best to have the sug
! gested function around the last part
| of May.
Bicycle rides, barbecue, hay rides
| were offered as possible suggestions
| for the day. Jack Laney, Delt, was
! appointed by Ryus to see about an
J open date.
Flat Tires
The bicycle idea and the hay ride
I were rejected in favor of the barbe
j cue, especially when it was discov
i ered that the number of available
I machines was limited and that one
j of the D.G. bikes had a flat tire.
"Then, too," commented Ryus a*
! he closed the meeting, "we can't
I ride three high verv well."
