WASHINGTON. April 14 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt warned aggres
sor nations today that the United
States is resolved to maintain peace
in North and South America and
will not tolerate attacks on the prin
j ciples of "democratic liberty" link
ing the two continents.
In one of his most significant ad
dresses on American foreign policy,
! delivered before the governing
board of the Pan American Union
jand broadcast throughout the world,
j the President said that the peoples of
J the Western Hemisphere must be
prepared to sacrifice their lives to
preserve hard-won democracy and
independence.
J His speech was considered doubly
i significant in that he spoke at a time
| when alien doctrines are filtering in
j to the western hemisphere, especially
! in South America, where German
i nationals and Italians have sought to
! entrench themselves in Brazil.
