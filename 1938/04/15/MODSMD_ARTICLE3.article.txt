# Wilbur Gives Peace Drive Discussion
## Urges Year-'Round Plan; Faculty Set For Group Talks 
### 
"Peace is not a one-day affair and
Stanford's Peace Day must be the
focus of a peace drive on the campus
lasting 365 days each year," Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur said yester
day in discussing the current pro
gram of the A.S.S.U. committee for
Peace Day, April 27.
"In some places," he said, "a peace
day is just a method of attracting
attention, but there is no substan
tial gain in just yelling about peace."

A Peace Day committee, chair
manned by Gerry Marcus, has been
making arrangements to have a
prominent speaker discuss the peace
problem in an all-University assem
bly and plans are under way to
conduct 15 round tables under mem
bers of the faculty and widely rec
ognized non-Stanford men.
Commenting further on the pro
gram, President Wilbur said that
Stanford's Peace Day has been con
structive in the past and the com
bination of a main speaker and the
round table discussions is a means
of getting groups of students to
think intelligently about peace.
"The great mass of students," he
said, "have no contact with the
faculty, and these round tables are
an excellent opportunity for stu
dents to become acquainted with
members of the faculty."
Lunchcon Planned
In addition to plans for the as
sembly and the round tables, the
committee has arranged to serve a
buffet luncheon accompanied by an
"international festival" in Union
Court.
Bob Livingston, committee mem
ber in charge of the essay contest
on "What the Student Can Do to
Further Peace," sponsored by the

suggested.

winner of the competition. No pa
pers will be accepted later than next
Monday and they must be confined
to 1000 words. Entries may be sub
