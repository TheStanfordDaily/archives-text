# Flames Frighten Pi Phis
## Firemen Elude Robleites 
### 
Nero fiddled while Rome burned,
but that grey-beard event that his
torians periodically drag from the
dusty tomes can't compare with the
Pi Phi's screaming while the back
wood-pile burns.
Last night, about 7:30 o'clock,
something touched off an accumu
lated pile of trash, rags, dust, and
wood that had been under the back
porch so long that it was almost as
old as the aforementioned Nero, and
the sisters began to think that an
Encina smoker had moved pipe, sto
gey, and Bull Durham right smack
into the dining room.
Unfortunately, however, this was
not the case and one of the brave
lassies called the laddies at the fire
house to come and substitute. In
such a hurry to accept that they de
cided to bring along their three fire
trucks, the laddies were hard at
work within the minute, had the
smoldering pile out in less than a
minute, and found that the Pi Phi's
had disappeared with the 20 car
loads of cut-ins that had come along
with them.

There was a fire on the campus
last night—somewhere. And three
freshman women left Roble to look
for it. They drove straight to En
cina; no other possibility entered
their minds. But there wasn't a fire
at Encina.
Driving aimlessly around the
building, they decided the next most
vulnerable fire-trap would be the
Daily Shack—but it wasn't there
either.
Back to the now empty fire house
went the three women. A worried
looking fellow was standing outside,
and it was to him that they shouted,
"Where's the fire?" But he only
looked at them blankly and said, "1
don't know. Fire?"
The women were irritated, and the
fire house was empty. "The trucks
are gone. What's happened to them?"
Scratching his head, the fellow an
swered, "Gosh, I don't kn<nv. They
left a. few minutes ago but they
didn't say where they were going"
—and, helpfully, "They ought to be
back soon."
