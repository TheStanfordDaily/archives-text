# Aviators To Honor Wright Brothers
## 
### 
DEARBORN. Mich., April 14
(UP). —Great names of aviation —
Igor Sikorsky, Jimmy Doolittle, A 1
Williams, and scores of others—will
assemble tomorrow to honor Orville
and Wilbur Wright whose tinkering
in a Dayton, 0., bicycle shop gave
the world the flying machine.
The Wrights' workshop and the
home where Orville was born and
where Wilbur died in 1912 have
been reconstructed in Henry Ford's
Greenfield Village.
