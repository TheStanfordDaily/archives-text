# Farm debaters Attend Pacific Forensic Meet
## Celeste Struck, III, Cancels Scheduled Speech at Stanford 
### 
Climaxing a week of concentrated
debate activity at the Pacific Fo
rensic League meeting at Reno,
Stanford debaters met representa
tives from the University of Wash
ington mid U.S.C. yesterday after
noon and evening respectively.
Meanwhile other debates were
conducted here. "Resolved, that the
United States should co-operate
with other nations to prevent further
encroachments on democracy" was
the subject debated by Bob Carpen
ter and Bob Hartmann of Stanford
and Sterling Livingston and Maurice
Atkinson of U.S.C. in the Women's
Clubhouse at an A.S.U. meeting.
Miss Celeste Strack, originally
scheduled to speak, was unable to
appear because of an illness which
confines her to the hospital in Ber
keley.
Kerr Places
Ed Kerr, who entered the after
dinner speaking division of the con
tests at Reno last week, won second
place. With him on the trip were
John Moskovies, who entered in ex
temporaneous speaking, and debaters
Armen Hampar and Bob Curtis.
No decisions were rendered on de
bates at the convention, as it was
experimental on variations of the
Washington symposium plan. The
debaters were attempting to find
suitable versions of the system fox
use in tournament and audience de
bating, and in their debates pre
sented three speeches on each side
as follows: analysis, solution, and
evaluation. The first two speeches
are supposed to be unbiased talks
on both sides.
Debate Coach Russell R. Hohnston
accompanied the speakers on the
trip.
The Washington debate was also
decisionless. Curtis and Hempar de
bated Lynus King and Mr. Cheno
wethe, using their system and in
cluding a questioning period.
