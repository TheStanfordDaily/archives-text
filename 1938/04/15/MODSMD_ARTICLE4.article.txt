WASHINGTON, April 14 (UP).—
Hope for pcace in organized labor's
civil war appeared even more re
mote today following the Committee
for Industrial Organization's call for
its first constitutional convention.
C.I.O. Chairman John L. Lewis
stressed the words '"permanent or
ganization" in annouhcing that
leaders of the 39 C.I.O. unions had
voted unanimously to set up a per
mament rival organization to the
American Federation of Labor. The
convention, he said, probably will
be held in September.
The action appeared to be the
j C.I.O.'s last step in severing all
I connections with the A. F. of L.
j This belief was strengthened by
i Lewis' refusal to discuss whether it
j would make peace more difficult.
