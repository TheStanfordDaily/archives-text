# Thorne Reveals Plans For ‘Future Memorial’
## 
### 
Announcing that plans are fin
ished for his proposed perpetual 75-
foot memorial for future wars,
Marco Thorne yesterday revealed
the purpose of the structure.
"We men that are going to get
killed off in the next war want to
see our memorial now. We want to
be sure it will be a decent memorial,
not just some old atrocity."
Meanwhile, the architect, Henry
Hughes, '38, has completed prelim
inary sketches. He hopes it will be
erected beside the Frost Memorial
Amphitheater on the side toward
the Museum.
Other sites that have been pro
posed, according to Thorne, are be
hind Lagunita and near the Ryan
high voltage laboratory.
Asked how much the edifice will
cost, Thorne set the figure at any
where from $25,000 to $50,000. "It all
revolves around whether we use
marble, granite, or only re-enforced
concrete," he said.
Thorne conceded the point that
the memorial "can't really be erect
ed until the next war occurs, be
cause we have to wait to see what

names to inscribe on its smooth,
white surface."
Among various plans for paying
for construction, Thorne thinks the
most feasible will be to rent out the
back of the memorial for cigarette
advertisements.
"At $10,000 a year, we can pay for
the thing in five years—that is, if we
use marble. Made out of cement, it
can be paid for in two and one-half
years," he mused.
Thorne wants it understood this is
an original idea, not copied after
anything else. Someone proposed a
memorial fountain in 1919 to com
memorate the World War, but he
didn't like the idea. And then, of
course, there was the suggestion
that an underground campus be
built.
A hot denial was ail the answer
Marco would give to current rumors
that he has been writing all the let
ters to The Daily editor about his
project.
