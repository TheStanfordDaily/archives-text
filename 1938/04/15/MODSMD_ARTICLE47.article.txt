# “Collective Security" For U.S. Attacked
## 
### BILL MILLIS 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond of two articles on peace by
collective security.)

The greatest danger before our
world is that retreat from reason,
that "mass drunkenness," as Thomas
Mann has called it, of the popular
mind which sends men and nations
chasing after the chimeras of Hit
ler's national socialism, Mussolini's
fascism, or Stalin's mockery of a
socialist society.
In the democratic nations of the
West the greatest hypnosis of all is
the doctrine of "collective secur
ity," which is actually a new ver
sion of the ancient theory that the
only way to preserve peace is
throuh the political and military al
liance of the most recently victorious
nations.
Popular Appeal
With its appeal to "protect" our
own "superior" institutions, collec
tive Security has a growing popu
larity in the United States, as evi
denced in the current poll on for
eign policy conducted by "The Na
tion."
The most ominous example of the
old story of preparing, for war be
hind slogans for peace was the Chi
cago speech last October of Presi
dent Roosevelt, which ringed with
fine generalizations about how the
"peace-loving 90 per cent of the
world" should "quarantine" the "10
per cent" who were "war-makers."
New Road to War
Collective security, it cannot be
said too emphatically, is simply a
smokescreen disguising the new
road to -war. It is based entirely up
on the fallacy that world politics are
determined by ideals rather than by
the economic rivalries of national
states. It is guided by the false as
sumption that the only threat to in
ternational peace comes from the
"war-making" "aggressive" dicta
tors of Italy, Germany, and Japan.
This is the purest nonsense, but it
is important nonsense, because it
has the purpose of winning the
people of the world—who, as op
posed to the military brass hats,
politicians ,and "intellectuals," have
never had much except artificial en
thusiasm for war, since they would
have to wage it—to fight again to
protect the wealth of natural re
sources that the democracies grab
bed throughout the world during the
past 150 years.

Because of the fundamental social
conflicts of the post-war years, it is
far too simple to divide the world
into the democratic forces of light
and the fascist forces of darkness.
If war comes, it will arise because
the "have-not" powers must seek
now sources of economic strength
while the "satiated" powers — vic
tors in the last war—will be fighting
to defend, not democracy, but the
wealth and lands which they already
control.
False Alternative
For America the alternative to
collective security, despite the as
sertions of Mr. Brubaker, is not one
of "ostrich-like isolation."
We must recognize that the only
way to keep out of war is to pre
pare for peace.
Immediately, that involves the en
forcement of the Neutrality Act,
halting war shipments abroad; the
withdrawal of all American armed
iorces overseas; and unfailing oppo
sition to military preparedness bills
and to all draft laws that would de
stroy our remaining civil liberties.
At the same time, keeping out of
war requires legislation, of prob
ably only temporary value, dealing
with such domestic social problems
as unemployment, child labor, old
age security, housing, soil and flood
control, and other public works.
'No Good War'
Modern war is not caused by any
natural pugnacious "instinct," for
armies would not have to be draft
ed. War is a recurrent feature of
the competitive capitalist system
that has made the world one. Ul
timately, the people of America must
join with the peoples— not the gov
ernments—of the world in working
out some sane revision of a society
characterized by war, unemploy
ment, and poverty of body and mind
which few persons at Stanford can
appreciate.
"There has never been a good war
or a sound peace," Benjamin Frank
lin once said. We should remember
that when our present-day war
mongers and militarists—who are to
be found as much on the left as on
the right—urge us to fight again un
der the tattered banner of making
the world safe for democracy.
Our generation may march off to
Armageddon, but upon returning
home we will find firmly established
all those institutions of dictatorship
—the suppression of all free and
democratic rights — which we sup
posedly had halted.

The greatest danger before our
world is that retreat from reason,
that "mass drunkenness," as Thomas
Mann has called it, of the popular
mind which sends men and nations
chasing after the chimeras of Hit
ler's national socialism, Mussolini's
fascism, or Stalin's mockery of a
socialist society.
In the democratic nations of the
West the greatest hypnosis of all is
the doctrine of "collective secur
ity," which is actually a new ver
sion of the ancient theory that the
only way to preserve peace is
throuh the political and military al
liance of the most recently victorious
nations.
Popular Appeal
With its appeal to "protect" our
own "superior" institutions, collec
tive Security has a growing popu
larity in the United States, as evi
denced in the current poll on for
eign policy conducted by "The Na
tion."
The most ominous example of the
old story of preparing, for war be
hind slogans for peace was the Chi
cago speech last October of Presi
dent Roosevelt, which ringed with
fine generalizations about how the
"peace-loving 90 per cent of the
world" should "quarantine" the "10
per cent" who were "war-makers."
New Road to War
Collective security, it cannot be
said too emphatically, is simply a
smokescreen disguising the new
road to -war. It is based entirely up
on the fallacy that world politics are
determined by ideals rather than by
the economic rivalries of national
states. It is guided by the false as
sumption that the only threat to in
ternational peace comes from the
"war-making" "aggressive" dicta
tors of Italy, Germany, and Japan.
This is the purest nonsense, but it
is important nonsense, because it
has the purpose of winning the
people of the world—who, as op
posed to the military brass hats,
politicians ,and "intellectuals," have
never had much except artificial en
thusiasm for war, since they would
have to wage it—to fight again to
protect the wealth of natural re
sources that the democracies grab
bed throughout the world during the
past 150 years.

Because of the fundamental social
conflicts of the post-war years, it is
far too simple to divide the world
into the democratic forces of light
and the fascist forces of darkness.
If war comes, it will arise because
the "have-not" powers must seek
now sources of economic strength
while the "satiated" powers — vic
tors in the last war—will be fighting
to defend, not democracy, but the
wealth and lands which they already
control.
False Alternative
For America the alternative to
collective security, despite the as
sertions of Mr. Brubaker, is not one
of "ostrich-like isolation."
We must recognize that the only
way to keep out of war is to pre
pare for peace.
Immediately, that involves the en
forcement of the Neutrality Act,
halting war shipments abroad; the
withdrawal of all American armed
iorces overseas; and unfailing oppo
sition to military preparedness bills
and to all draft laws that would de
stroy our remaining civil liberties.
At the same time, keeping out of
war requires legislation, of prob
ably only temporary value, dealing
with such domestic social problems
as unemployment, child labor, old
age security, housing, soil and flood
control, and other public works.
'No Good War'
Modern war is not caused by any
natural pugnacious "instinct," for
armies would not have to be draft
ed. War is a recurrent feature of
the competitive capitalist system
that has made the world one. Ul
timately, the people of America must
join with the peoples— not the gov
ernments—of the world in working
out some sane revision of a society
characterized by war, unemploy
ment, and poverty of body and mind
which few persons at Stanford can
appreciate.
"There has never been a good war
or a sound peace," Benjamin Frank
lin once said. We should remember
that when our present-day war
mongers and militarists—who are to
be found as much on the left as on
the right—urge us to fight again un
der the tattered banner of making
the world safe for democracy.
Our generation may march off to
Armageddon, but upon returning
home we will find firmly established
all those institutions of dictatorship
—the suppression of all free and
democratic rights — which we sup
posedly had halted.

world is that retreat from reason,
that "mass drunkenness," as Thomas
Mann has called it, of the popular
mind which sends men and nations
chasing after the chimeras of Hit
ler's national socialism, Mussolini's
fascism, or Stalin's mockery of a
socialist society.
In the democratic nations of the
West the greatest hypnosis of all is
the doctrine of "collective secur
ity," which is actually a new ver
sion of the ancient theory that the
only way to preserve peace is
throuh the political and military al
liance of the most recently victorious
nations.
Popular Appeal
With its appeal to "protect" our
own "superior" institutions, collec
tive Security has a growing popu
larity in the United States, as evi
denced in the current poll on for
eign policy conducted by "The Na
tion."
The most ominous example of the
old story of preparing, for war be
hind slogans for peace was the Chi
cago speech last October of Presi
dent Roosevelt, which ringed with
fine generalizations about how the
"peace-loving 90 per cent of the
world" should "quarantine" the "10
per cent" who were "war-makers."
New Road to War
Collective security, it cannot be
said too emphatically, is simply a
smokescreen disguising the new
road to -war. It is based entirely up
on the fallacy that world politics are
determined by ideals rather than by
the economic rivalries of national
states. It is guided by the false as
sumption that the only threat to in
ternational peace comes from the
"war-making" "aggressive" dicta
tors of Italy, Germany, and Japan.
This is the purest nonsense, but it
is important nonsense, because it
has the purpose of winning the
people of the world—who, as op
posed to the military brass hats,
politicians ,and "intellectuals," have
never had much except artificial en
thusiasm for war, since they would
have to wage it—to fight again to
protect the wealth of natural re
sources that the democracies grab
bed throughout the world during the
past 150 years.

Because of the fundamental social
conflicts of the post-war years, it is
far too simple to divide the world
into the democratic forces of light
and the fascist forces of darkness.
If war comes, it will arise because
the "have-not" powers must seek
now sources of economic strength
while the "satiated" powers — vic
tors in the last war—will be fighting
to defend, not democracy, but the
wealth and lands which they already
control.
False Alternative
For America the alternative to
collective security, despite the as
sertions of Mr. Brubaker, is not one
of "ostrich-like isolation."
We must recognize that the only
way to keep out of war is to pre
pare for peace.
Immediately, that involves the en
forcement of the Neutrality Act,
halting war shipments abroad; the
withdrawal of all American armed
iorces overseas; and unfailing oppo
sition to military preparedness bills
and to all draft laws that would de
stroy our remaining civil liberties.
At the same time, keeping out of
war requires legislation, of prob
ably only temporary value, dealing
with such domestic social problems
as unemployment, child labor, old
age security, housing, soil and flood
control, and other public works.
'No Good War'
Modern war is not caused by any
natural pugnacious "instinct," for
armies would not have to be draft
ed. War is a recurrent feature of
the competitive capitalist system
that has made the world one. Ul
timately, the people of America must
join with the peoples— not the gov
ernments—of the world in working
out some sane revision of a society
characterized by war, unemploy
ment, and poverty of body and mind
which few persons at Stanford can
appreciate.
"There has never been a good war
or a sound peace," Benjamin Frank
lin once said. We should remember
that when our present-day war
mongers and militarists—who are to
be found as much on the left as on
the right—urge us to fight again un
der the tattered banner of making
the world safe for democracy.
Our generation may march off to
Armageddon, but upon returning
home we will find firmly established
all those institutions of dictatorship
—the suppression of all free and
democratic rights — which we sup
posedly had halted.
