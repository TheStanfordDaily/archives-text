HPHAT scorching 30.6 turned in by
Ray Malott for 300 yards the
other day brought to light a long
forgotten world record.
Malott's ,mark, made in a special
race with Stan Hiserman, ties the
world record set by Bernie Wefers
nearly half a century ago—lB96, to
accurately spoil a good phrase.
That is, there is very good reason
to believe it ties the record. Don
Liebendorfer's history book covers
only through 1934, and the 30.6
mark may have been broken in the
past four years.
Nevertheless, that's right fine time
in any league, and we'll hold it as a
world record until proof to the con
trary appears.
Having his refcord books open,
Liebendorfer flipped to a well
thumbed page, smiled proudly—on
it was Stanford's track records.
"I don't believe there's another
school in the country that can show
a better group of marks," he said.
"Of course, individual marks will
stand out here and there, but an
aggregate of records like these would
be hard to find."
Having started off with a six
trumpet fanfare, Liebendorfer then
justified his claims.
As a result, here are Stanford's
track records:
100 —9.8 —Hec Dyer, 1931
Morris Kirskey, 1921
220—20.8—Hec Dyer, 1930
440—46.4 —Ben Eastman, 1932
880 —1.50.7 —Ben Eastman, 1932
(1.49.9 was chalked up by East
man after graduation in 1934.)
Mi1e—4.16.1 Tiger Alexander,
1937
Two-mile —9.32.7 —Burrows, 1938
Hicg hurdles —14.1 Klopstock
1935. (This mark was made by
Klopstock while a senior; however,
he was competing for the Olympic
Club in the National A.A.U. meet.)
Low hurdles—23.2 Sam Klop
stock, 1934
Jack Weiershauser, 1937
Shotput—sl ft. 1 in.—John Lyman,
1934. (At the National A.A.U. meet,
competing for the Olympic Club, Ly
man hit a mark of 52 ft. 914 in.).

High jump—6 ft. 7 in.—George I

(The former mark was set on the !
old standards—the bar rested on a
peg; the latter mark was made on
the new standards, where the bar
rests on top of the uprights, and is
much easier to knock off.)
Broad jump—24 ft. 10 in.—Fred

Mottram, 1934
Mile relay 3.12.6/10 Maynor

HPHAT scorching 30.6 turned in by
Ray Malott for 300 yards the
other day brought to light a long
forgotten world record.
Malott's ,mark, made in a special
race with Stan Hiserman, ties the
world record set by Bernie Wefers
nearly half a century ago—lB96, to
accurately spoil a good phrase.
That is, there is very good reason
to believe it ties the record. Don
Liebendorfer's history book covers
only through 1934, and the 30.6
mark may have been broken in the
past four years.
Nevertheless, that's right fine time
in any league, and we'll hold it as a
world record until proof to the con
trary appears.
Having his refcord books open,
Liebendorfer flipped to a well
thumbed page, smiled proudly—on
it was Stanford's track records.
"I don't believe there's another
school in the country that can show
a better group of marks," he said.
"Of course, individual marks will
stand out here and there, but an
aggregate of records like these would
be hard to find."
Having started off with a six
trumpet fanfare, Liebendorfer then
justified his claims.
As a result, here are Stanford's
track records:
100 —9.8 —Hec Dyer, 1931
Morris Kirskey, 1921
