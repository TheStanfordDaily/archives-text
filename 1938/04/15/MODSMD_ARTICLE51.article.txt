# Stanford Skiers To Enter Meet
## 
### 
Bill Janss and Lloyd Davis,
members of the Stanford Ski Club,
will go to Norden to enter the meet
there this week-end. The rest of
the club will go to Yosemite for the
Easter activities, according to
Jayne Copp.
At Yosemite on Saturday, there
will be a straight race for men and
women competing for the May
Spring Challenger Trophy; and on
Easter Sunday, a Giant Slalom race
for men and women, boys and girls
and an Easter Egg Slalom for men
and women will be held in -the
morning.
The spring snow is supposed to be
best for skiing. Also, the time of
year enables the skiers to go with
out shirts, which in turn gives them
a tan that, according to reports, is
better than sea-shore tan. The
snow, which is much less danger
ous at this time of year, will last
until the end of May or the first of
June, according to Jayne Copp, sec
retary of the Ski Club.
