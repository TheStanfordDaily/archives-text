## 
### 
KILGORE, Tex., April 14-(UP).
The 25,000 th oil well in the East
Texas field was completed today.
The well is located within the Kil
gore city limits.
Eight years ago C. M. ("Dad")
Joiner discovered the East Texas
fieldâ€”less than a week after a group
of geologists announced that there
could be no oil under East Texas,
and passed a resolution to that ef
fect. Since then the field has been
developed into the greatest known
oil pool in the world.
