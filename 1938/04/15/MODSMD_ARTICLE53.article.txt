# Card Tracksters To Face Olympic Club
## Winged O's Picked Over Farm Stars Cards Fear Stiff Competition From 'Business Men' Aces 
### 
Stanford's track and field team is
looking its first defeat of the season
straight in the eye when Coach Dink
Templeton's men tangle with the
Olympic Club outfit tomorrow af
tbrnoon on Angell Field. No admis
sion v/ill be charged to Stanfordites
with student body cards.
If all of the Winged-O's myriad of
stars appear for the meet, Stanford
should find itself snowed under. The
Olympians are the only team to
have defeated U.S.C. in the past sev
eral years. However, no one ever
seems to" know if or when Coach
Charley Hunter's "business men"
athletes are going to show up, least
of all Hunter himself.
San Jose Swamped
Earlier in the season, Cal swamp
ed the clubmen, 83-48, when half of
the latter's competitors were absent.
Last Saturday, San Jose State went
down before the Huntermen, 90-41.
If all the visitors show up, Stan
ford will face such as the follow
ing: sprints, Ray Dean, Vincent
Reel; 440, Bob Young, A1 Blackman;
880, Vic Palmason; distances, Chuck
Nimmo, Norm Bright; hurdles, Del
Fishback, Tom Moore; weights, Phil
Levy, Ray Allee; javelin, Ed Water
bury, Johntiy Mottram; pole vault,
Cornelius Warmerdam; high jump,
Humbert Smith.
Malott Challenged
Coach Templeton welcomes this
top-notch competition, though, be
cause for the first time this season
Captain Ray Malott will have some
one capable of extending him to his
world record in the quarter-mile.
Young was a member of the U.S.'s
1600-meter relay team in the last
Olympics and Blackman is a former
Farm ace.
Burrows, too, will get all the com-
I petition his heart desires when he
tangles with Bright and Nimmo. The
mile is the first event on the pro
gram, 2:00 o'clock, and lanky Ed
will be forced to put his all into
this race. It will be interesting to
see if Burrows can shake off the ef
fects of this first jaunt and come
back at his best in the two-mile 40
rpinutes later. *
Hurdles To Thrill
The low hurdles should also be a
thriller. Del Fishback, former Cal
barrier artist, will face off against
Stanford's Stan Hiserman, made
over Farm sprinter. Fishback won
in 23.4 against San Jose last week,
while Hiserman took second in 23.5
in the U.C.L.A. meej„
San Jose State, coached by "Tiny"
Hartranftt, former Stanford shot
putter, worked out with the Indians
yesterday. The best performance
was turned in by Owen Collins,
Spartan quartermiler, who was
timed in 48.6.
Carl Mahurin did 1:58.6 in a
practice 880 trial.
Bill Hawkins finally broke his
losing streak to Dick Simpson and
nosed him out in both the high and
low hurdles. The times were 15.2
and 25 flat, respectively.
Winged-O's Challenge
Captain Ray Malott trounced Stan
Hiserman by a yard in a 100-yard
dash in 9.9.
History repeats itself, so agajn we
say that [Stanford faces its first de
feat today—if the Olympic Club gets
a representative turnout. However,
chances are that most of the Winged-
O tracksters won't answer roll
when Hunter counts noses,, and
Stanford should win by' a fairly
close score.
