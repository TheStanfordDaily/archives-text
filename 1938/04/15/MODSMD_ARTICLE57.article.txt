# Tankmen Meet U.S.C., Uclans
## Varsity Competes Today, Tomorrow 
### 
Thirteen varsity swimmers and
two managers departed with Coach
ISTort Thornton last night for Los An
geles, where the squad competes to
day and tomorrow against U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. Both meets were
originally scheduled for winter
quarter, but' flood conditions forced
a postponement until this week-end.
California has already met both
I the southern teams, decisively beat
ing U.C.L.A. and losing to the Tro
jans in the last relay event. The In
dians' surprise victory over the
Bears last Saturday makes them fa
vorites over both opponents.
The Trojans have shown little
power and should not provide much
competition, but they have not yet
reached their peak and may be tops
today.
Apparently the Trojan meet vic
tory will hinge on the abilities of
Captain Dave Rider and Win Need
ham to win both the 220- and 440-
yard free-style events. Bob Boales
of U.S.C. beat them in both grinds
last year, but thus far this season he
has been swimming slower than
either of the All-American twins.
Roger Hatch of the Trojans looks
like a sure bet in the 50- and 100-
yard free-style and Paul Wolfe,
Olympic team luminary, is better
than the Cards in almost any event
he enters.
Both relay events and 12 vital
points also look like Trojan prop
erty.
