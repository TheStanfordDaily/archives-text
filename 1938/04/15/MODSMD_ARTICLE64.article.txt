# Yearling Nine Plays Cal Cubs On Farm Today
## Cards Out for Win In Second Meeting; Pfyl Elected Captain 
### 
Under the leadership of their
newly elected captain, JVlonte Pfyl,
the Papoose baseball nine will be out
for revenge when they meet the Cal
cubs here this afternoon in the
second tilt of the annual three-game
series. The game will start at 3
o'clock on the frosh diamond.
Pfyl, elected _ to the leadership of
the squad yesterday, is leading the
team's hitting with a phenomenal
batting average of well over .500.
Doubling as second base and pitcher,
he has turned-in two victories and
one defeat on the mound and has
played almost errorless ball in the
infield. Other candidates for the
captaincy included Quentin Thomp
son, ace frosh hurler, and Ush Tuck
er, first sacker.
Starting on the mound for Stan
ford will be "Coptie" Thompson, En
cina's number one piteher. Thomp
son has a record of four wins and
two defeats behind him and is due
for a top-notch performance today.
Some of the Card hopes-went glim
mering two days ago when Claude
Purkitt, who went the entire frames
behind the plate in the last Cal en
counter, broke the index finger of
his right hand in a practice session.
At first base, lanky Harlan Harbke
has shown marked improvement
during the last week and is picked
as the cinch starter there over Ush
Tucker. Monte Pfyl will fill the bill
at second unless he is picked to
pitch, in which case Marty Bains
will take over the keystone sack.
Elton Boone, who has been on the
starting sheet at third base for every
game, will open in his regular spot.
At short, Herb Bull, now completely
recovered from an elbow injury,
will see action in the beginning line
up.
In the outfield, the combination of
Cookie" South, Jim McCloud, and
Thor Peterson will continue as first
string starters. These three have
been looking good in recent batting
practice and may provide the bat
ting punch necessary to break up the
old ball game.
