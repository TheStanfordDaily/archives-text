# Varsity Nine Meets California Tomorrow
## One Game Lead Held By Indians Ace Stanford Hurler Will Start on Mound Against Bill Priest 
### 
With a chance to clinch the first
California series since 1931, Stan
ford's varsity baseballers will meet
the Bears tomorrow at 3:30 o'clock
on Edwards Field, Berkeley, in the
second of the three annual Big
Games.
By scoring a G-3 upset over Cal,
last Saturday, the Indians took a
one-game lead, and a victory to
morrow would give them the first
series in seven years. A win for the
Bears will mean that the final game
here a week from tomorrow will be
the "rubber" match.
Indians Win in 1931
In 1931, Stanford took all three
games for the first time since 1893
that either team had accomplished
the feat and the first time since
192(5 that the Indians had won the
series.
A 1 Lazzarone, who pitched bril
liantly to upset the Bears Saturday,
is Coach Harry Wblter's choice to
take the mound again tomorrow.
Taking no chances on another pos
sible defeat, Clint Evans will send
his ace, Bill Priest, against the Cards.
Changes in Outfield
The only changes in the Indian
line-up will probably be in the out
field. In order to add more punch
at the plate. Wolter is expected to
start Bob Matthews in right field
and Bill Clark in center in place of
Norm Juney and Wally deWitt, who
started the first Cal game.
As far as Stanford is concerned,
tomorrow's game will not have
much bearing on the C.1.8.A. stand
ings. The Cards are out of the cham
pionship running, but a victory
might move them into fourth spot in
place of U.C.L.A. The Bears are
heading the loop at present, and a
win for them would strengthen their
hold on first place over the threat
ening U.S.C. Trojans and St. Mary's
Gaels.
