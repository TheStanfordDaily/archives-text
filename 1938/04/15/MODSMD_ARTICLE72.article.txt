# Surprise for U.S.C.'s Trojans

### 

THE BIGGEST SURPRISE of the track meet in which U.S.C. defeated
the Golden e√üars last week at Berkeley was the performance
of Caiman George Anderson, who defeated N.C.A.A. Champion Earl
Vickery in the low hurdles. They are shown here clearing one of
the barriers.
