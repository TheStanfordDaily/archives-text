# 'Kind Lady' Impresses Playgoers
## Kay Campbell Stars In Mystery Drama 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
One hundred and fifty people suf- i
fered through an eerie, terrifying'
nightmare in Memorial Hall last
night.
And despite previous productions
of the Division of Speech and Drama,
last night's bad dream was not be- i
cause "Kind Lady" was so bad— |
but because "Kind Lady" was so |
good.
If you've ever awakened in the
middle of the night in a cold sweat,
overwhelmingly relieved that you've
regained whatever sanity you had,
you know exactly how the audience
reacted to the final curtain of Mr.
Heberer's production.
Psychological Play
"Kind Lady," dramatized from a
Hugh Walpole short story, was, like
"Night Must Fall," a psychological
melodrama tracing the disintegration
of a kind old lady through the wiles
of a suave yet implacable young vil
lain.
The play s success lay, it seems to
me, in its hypnotic effect upon the
audience. As the action progressed,
as the band of imperturbable ras
cals unhurriedly usurped the vic
tims lreedom and authority, a feel
ing of helplessness and horror
gripped the spectators. Every per
son in the house felt the terror of
Mary Herries—played with surpris
ing dignity and depth by Kay Camp
bell.
Kahn Convincing
Hal Kahn, usually the country
bumpkin or someone equally in
nocuous, was smoothly convincing
as the assured and insolent villain
who begs tea on Christmas Eve,
completely controls his benefactor
a month later.
The freshness of Virginia Sharpe,
as the quite sane friend who would
shake Mary from the gang's clutches
(alas, too late), and of Bud Cadv,
as the American playboy relative
in-law, brought into horrifying con
trast the tormenting and nerve
wracking incredibility of the Kind
Lady's situation.
Mr. Heberer's direction, calmly
bringing the piece to its punch
climaxes, created a mood of help
less nightmarishness that will not
soon wear off last night's audience.
I am really not captious enough to
criticize "Kind Lady."
