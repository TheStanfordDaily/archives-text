# Lady, Be Kind
## 
### 
WE won't know unitl we see it, of course,
but we have the feeling that "Kind Lady"
ought to be pretty good. At least it has all the
elements in its favor. I haven't read the play,
but from advance notices I gather that it's not
the type which made the campus exclaim last
fall that the Division was sacrificing the audience
on the altar of art. On the other hand, so they
tell me anyhow, it's far from another "June
Moon."
The cast is experienced almost to the point
of triteness, and some of the members say
that "Kind Lady" is among the best things
they've done this year.
Besides, Direcior Heberer is going to have a
chance to play around with one of the finest
stages on a college campus without having to
worry about his actors' voices carrying to the
far reaches of the balcony. The curtain which
will be dropped to shut off about half the hall
will give the intimacy and practicality of the
Little Theater, and still allow the cast to work
on a stage without falling off every time it gets
excited.
As far as the audience goes, the lowered
prices alone should give "Kind Lady" an edge
over the Paly theaters. In fact, the gods have
been remarkably kind to the madame.
We will know tonight whether she can live
up to her name 01 whether she is really as much
of a liar about herself as the huge advertising
poster on the Engineering Corner suggests. â€”
