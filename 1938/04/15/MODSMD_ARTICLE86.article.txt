# Marco's Monument
## 
### 
NOW THAT Marco Thorne of the Chappie
staff has a good idea behind his Future War
Memorial Association. As I understand it, all
Marco wants to do is to arouse a little interest
in Peace â€”spelled with a capital "P" and to be
celebrated here April 27.
The Peace Day Committee itself had some
thing the same plan in its efforts to get movie
star Francis Lederer to speak at the all-Uni
versity assembly part of the program. Their
thought was to get an audience by any digni
fied means. Whatever the purpose of the ma
jority of persons in attending, they all will listen
to the same discussion of peace. By the law
of averages, it will be effective in making some
of them think about peace.
Marco is using the same psychology; by
burlesguing future war, he seeks interest in
how to stop it. And that purpose is good enough
for me.
Where do I make my contribution?
