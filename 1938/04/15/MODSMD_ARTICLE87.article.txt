# Bah, Bah, Black Sheep
## 
### 
SOME time before the recent elections Wom
en's Conference sent out its favorite pro
tege, the nominating committee, to seek its
fortune. When Conference meets Monday night
the committee will return home to report.
According to Cynthia Coonley, Conference
president, the new system of nominations will
be studied. Changes will be suggested and
will be submitted to the living groups for rati
fication.
This means that Conference will be able to
junk the experiment, if it decides that its adopted
darling is a black sheep.
We hope Conference will admit that the ex
periment has failed, and will give it up. We
know that the chances aren't blindingly bright.
But still we hope.
In the last elections Ihe nominating commit
tee was about as useful as an eyeshade to a
blind man. All it could do was see that no
candidate was morally unfit, and since Stanford,
by hypothesis, has no such candidates, that
function was a bit useless. The committee sim
ply gave its gracious approval to the choices of
the living groups.
Conference seems to think the women liked
the idea during the elections. It is impossible,
of course, to see all the women, but the ones we
talked to gave the impression that they thought
the committee about as satisfactory as the sales
tax.
After all there isn't any practical way of
grafting oligarchy onto democracy. Conference
tried it; and its system hasn't worked. It ex
pected the nominating committee to put more
women into politics. But what need is there for
this when any woman with 15 friends can run?
It expected to eliminate caucuses. But what does
it call the living-group assemblies that picked
their nominees?
