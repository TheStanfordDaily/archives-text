# WAR AND PEACE
## 
### 
|>EGULARLY each April the Farm's idealists get
together and have their little war about the best
: way to keep the peace. The collective security group
| presents its broad generalities and the rabid isolation
| ists present their selfish and short-sighted policy; and
they talk and they talk, and presently we have Peace
Day to calm them down, and then the fever vanishes
and we go back to reading headlines about blood in
Spain, chaos in China, reunion in Vienna . . .
The opening gun in this year's campaign was fired
yesterday by Otis Brubaker, whose article in The
Daily repeated most of what Stuart Chase would
term the "blab words" of collective security. Wc live
in an interlocking world; we must co-operate to cor
rect economic abuses; we must not refuse to help
solve the economic problems which confuse us today.
This is Mr. Brubaker's answer to the isolationists,
who also recognize economic problems, but feel that
they should be solved within nations before being
! solved between nations.
Granting the sincerity and idealism of both groups,
| both are being left behind by events which move too
I fast for Peace Day orators. Their ideas already seem
j rather oldrfashioned, impotent, somehow not what
' we need in an age in which power is on the march
j and justice in retreat.
I We can no longer afford to stop, look, and listen;
| we have no time. To solve problems which would take
I 100 years to solve, we are called upon to ignore a
I threat which is present here and now. We are urged
I to blunder headlong into alilance on the one hand, or
turn tail and retire to our mountain-top on the
other. We are belabored with the word "economic,"
which used to mean something before Dr. Schachl
began playing hob with it, but is now only a cant
word obscuring an issue far too vital to be lost in a
welter of partisan discussion.
True, economic maladjustments are the bases of
our world problems; true, they must be solved if civ
ilization is to survive; true, they can only be solved
within and between nations. But they cannot be
solved with a murderer coming in through the front
door and a maniac through the back.
Somewhere, the line against international anarchy
must be drawn. It cannot be drawn in co-operation
with Britain and France, because they refuse to do
anything which might possibly do some good. It can
not be drawn around the three-mile limit of the
United States, because that would only serve to
strengthen the very thing it is supposed to prevent.
But it can be drawn, it seems to me, on the line
of unilateral action—not unilateral action proposed by
Britain and France, but unilateral action proposed by
the United States. There is no reason why we should
always wait for Britain and France. We are under
no obligation to tag along after Neville Chamberlain.
They tell us, all these visitors from abroad, that we
are the most powerful force for peace anywhere in
the world. We are either arrant cowards, which we
are not, or stupid dunderheads, which we have often
been, if we do not take them seriously enough to
propose a program of our own.
It might be a revived League of Nations, with the
United States a member; it might be a Pan-American
League of Nations; it might be any one of a hundred
things; but it would be—it must be—something new.
positive, and striking enough to win support.
It must not be a policy of co-operating with pow
ers who will not co-operate; it must not be a policy
of hiding under the bed to escape the lightning. It
must, in the last analysis, be a policy of making the
most of our enormous potentialities for peace—by our
selves, on our own initiative, and with confidence in
our own success.
