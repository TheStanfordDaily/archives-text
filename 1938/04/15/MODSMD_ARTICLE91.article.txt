£ JItOBABLY the most disheartening thing at the as
sembly Monday morning was not the vapid cam
paign speeches of the nominees, but the combined
glee clubs which sang afterwards. We are not taking
a blanket crack at either the personnel of the clubs,
who tried hard, or at Mr. Kendall, who has groomed
them. To him goes much credit for his work in the
last few years, which has made it possible to have a
glee club at all. When he arrived, there had been
seven lean years when no club at all graced Stanford's
campus.
But the gripe goes to Stanford for not giving a
damn. For a university of this size and prestige, our
campus music, outside of the Gaieties, is disgraceful.
Because of lack of interest, the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra died from starvation a few years back, after
once being a fairly creditable organization. And ihe
band is not what you would call finished. The answer
seems to lie in the fact that Stanford does not have any
sort of music department. Were there one, musical
enterprises would develop naturally from the pres
ence of music students. But more vital, we think, is
the importance of such a department in the interest
it arouses for music in the general run of students.
Our acquaintance with other universities seems to
indicate that glee clubs are not made up in large part
of men and women studying singing, but that they
draw their membership from the student body as a
whole. We simply cannot believe that among 4000
men and women, there are no voices better than most
of those who sing in the glee club at present. We will
probably be told categorically that we're wrong, by
Mr. Kendall, who has listened 1o the tryoutees for
the club. He will tell us thai if there are people here
who can really sing, he has never met them. As we
have said, no one gives a damn. And Mr. Kendall is
just over a barrel.
Of course we realize that there is no vital reason
why Stanford should care. The school won't go to rack
;tnd ruin because the tenors in the glee club can't hit a
high C or even a good G. for that matter.
But with the clubs taking an increasing part in
idvertising Stanford with radio broadcasts and off
campus concerts, our critical ear tells us that the adver
tisement is not paying too well.
The only singing that is important, apparently, is
that which makes Beltramo's walls ring late at night.
But if some of tin- lads down there who can hold a
nice tenor on "Sweet Adeline" read this. Stanford, and
Mr. Kendall, would appreciate a moment of their
time. - Stone

Our acquaintance with other universities seems to
indicate that glee clubs are not made up in large part
of men and women studying singing, but that they
draw their membership from the student body as a
whole. We simply cannot believe that among 4000
men and women, there are no voices better than most
of those who sing in the glee club at present. We will
probably be told categorically that we're wrong, by
Mr. Kendall, who has listened 1o the tryoutees for
the club. He will tell us thai if there are people here
who can really sing, he has never met them. As we
have said, no one gives a damn. And Mr. Kendall is
just over a barrel.
Of course we realize that there is no vital reason
why Stanford should care. The school won't go to rack
;tnd ruin because the tenors in the glee club can't hit a
high C or even a good G. for that matter.
But with the clubs taking an increasing part in
idvertising Stanford with radio broadcasts and off
campus concerts, our critical ear tells us that the adver
tisement is not paying too well.
The only singing that is important, apparently, is
that which makes Beltramo's walls ring late at night.
But if some of tin- lads down there who can hold a
nice tenor on "Sweet Adeline" read this. Stanford, and
Mr. Kendall, would appreciate a moment of their
time. - Stone
£ JItOBABLY the most disheartening thing at the as
sembly Monday morning was not the vapid cam
paign speeches of the nominees, but the combined
glee clubs which sang afterwards. We are not taking
a blanket crack at either the personnel of the clubs,
who tried hard, or at Mr. Kendall, who has groomed
them. To him goes much credit for his work in the
last few years, which has made it possible to have a
glee club at all. When he arrived, there had been
seven lean years when no club at all graced Stanford's
campus.
But the gripe goes to Stanford for not giving a
damn. For a university of this size and prestige, our
campus music, outside of the Gaieties, is disgraceful.
Because of lack of interest, the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra died from starvation a few years back, after
once being a fairly creditable organization. And ihe
band is not what you would call finished. The answer
seems to lie in the fact that Stanford does not have any
sort of music department. Were there one, musical
enterprises would develop naturally from the pres
ence of music students. But more vital, we think, is
the importance of such a department in the interest
it arouses for music in the general run of students.
