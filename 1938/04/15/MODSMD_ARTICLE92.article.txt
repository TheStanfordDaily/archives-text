# The 						River' Considered Disappointing
## 
### 
"The River," currently flowing at!
the Stanford, is a saddening attempt
of some agriculture office of the
government to show the story of a
River, the Mississippi, where it be
gins, how it ends, what it has meant
to us, what it has cost us.
Pare Lorenz, who also made "The
Plow That Broke the Plains," the
j government's other experimental
! documentary, is an extremely pow
erful photographer. His, like all
wonderful photography, can't be
talked about to advantage; it's meant !
to be seen in the same way that
wonderful music is meant to be
heard. >
Unusual Photography
There are close-ups, and long |
shots, and angle shots, and cloud
shots. Pare Lorenz takes things
lower than the commonplace, pho
tographs them and makes it thrilling.
He takes just plain dirt and gives
each dust particle a personality that
sets it ofT from every other dust
grain.
But Pare Lorenz should never have
been given the job of writing and
I directing "The River." (I really don't
know exactly how closely Lorenz
was allied to the photography com
pared to the writing and directing in
his movies and, therefore, may be
going ofT half primed, but in the
two I've seen the same weaknesses
and strong points have been ex
hibited.) He doesn't seem to start
making his movies with any very
strong convictions, or, I'm afraid,
even any preconceived ideas of how
they're going to end.
Touch of Insincerity
There's almost a touch of the in
sincere, for he isn't nearly so moved
by what the River has meant to us
as what it looks like. He uses his,
subject as an excuse for photograph- 1
ing what he loves: stark realism
but with a complete lack of pro
fundity or even simple understand- >
ing.
The dialog and music are awful.
The music is pling-pling, simple- '
home-folks-of-the-plains, "Oh Su
zanasie" stuff. The dialog is absurd. !
redundant, and demonstrates very I
clearly the Lorenz concept of what j
he makes films. For instance, i
someone told Lorenz that there were |
lots of tributaries flowing into the j
Mississippi. So he showed beautiful j
river shots and had the narrator re- |
peat over and over, "Down comes
the Ohio, down comes the Wabash,
down comes the Missouri, etc.," until
almost down comes the house.
Work Commendable
I don't want to belittle Mr. Lo- j
renz. He is doing a commendable, j
experimental work still in the infant
stage, and his films are worth see- !
ing for the photography alone, but
I can't help feel that he starts oft to I
make a film of what the River has J
meant to us without its having meant
very much to him personally.
Also playing on the same bill is
"Merrily We Live" which the Stan- j
ford management's ads would have
you believe Ls the important feature
where in everybody lives merrily
and amusingly but not too con
vincingly.
