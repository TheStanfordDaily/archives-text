A hen is not supposed to have much common sense or tact, 5
Yet every time she lays an egg she cackles forth the fact.
A rooster hasn't got a lot of intellect to show,
But none the less most roosters have enough good sense to crow.
The mule, the most despised of beasts, has a persistent way
Of letting folks know he's around by his insistent bray.
I The busy little bees they buzz, bulls bellow and cows moo.
The watchdogs bark, and ganders guack, and doves and pigeons
coo.
The peacock spreads his tail and sguawks, pigs sgueal and robins
sing,
And even serpents know enough to hiss before they sting.
But man, the greatest masterpiece that nature could devise,
Will often stop and hesitate before he'll advertise.
