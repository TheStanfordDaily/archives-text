I DYNAMITE BLASTS rocked
Palestine yesterday, while a
world journeying between wars ob
served the day of the Prince of
Peace. Machine gun blasts from
British patrol planes rattled in re

—provoked by rival but similar
nationalisms — between Arabs and
Jews.

<>3 dead and at least 100 wounded.
Yesterday's fighting occurred in
the hills north of Jerusalem.

2000 armed police, aided by bomb

ting an armed uprising against the

(REPUBLICANS opened their ex
pected attack yesterday upon
Presdient Roosevelt's $4,512,000,000
pump-priming recovery program
with National Committee Chairman
John D. M. Hamilton and Michigan
Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg —
who is hopeful about 1940—repre
senting the Administration's plans
as a major campaign issue.
In their radio addresses, both
G.O.P. leaders bristled with de
mands for cessation of what they
called "profligate" New Deal
spending and immediate measures
to "reassure" frightened indus
trialists.
"Business cannot flourish with
the strangling hold of the tax col
lector around its neck," Hamilton
declared. "What is needed is to in
still confidence in the future in the
minds of men and that cannot be
clone by the admission that inflation
and spending are the only answer
to our economic ailments," he said.
While both Vandenberg and Ham
ilton agreed with the President that
Ihe present situation necessitates a
"united front" shorn of personal re
criminations, the party chairman de
manded Congressional "independ
ence"—i.e., rejection —of pump
priming proposals and predicted that
this would "reassure" business.

Spain's twenty-second month of
civil war opened yesterday, with In
surgent and Loyalist commanders
rushing veteran troops ot front line
positions, in preparation for the su
preme test of Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco's awaited "victory
blow" at Barcelona, Republican
capital now separated from direct
connection with the Valencia-Ma
th id-Cartagena triangular area.
Rebel troops extended their grip
on an 18-mile strip of Mediter
ranean seacoast near Bcnicarlo,
and pushed northward to within
seven miles of Tortosa. Loyalists
concentrated the remnants of their
Catalonian armies for a new
counter-attack upon Lerida.
Frontier observers see scant
chance of peace through a victory
for Franco before mid-summer, and
believe that both armies lack suf
ficient planes, artillery and muni
lions, and new reserves to launch
any offensive in the near future.
