# Beta Exonerated In Auto Crash
## 
### 
Arthur Macrates, Stanford junior |
: and a member of Beta Theta Pi fra- I
ternity, was questioned Saturday by J
authorities concerning an accident I
early that morning on the Bay- !
shore Highway in which Charles j
Durkee, 34, of Menlo Park, was
killed and the Packard coupe driven
by Macrates consumed by flames.
The Farm student was completely |
exonerated from all blame when in- 1
vestigation reports showed that he
i was proceeding in the slow lane
, when Durkee's car, approaching
1 from the opposite direction, swerved
; across the road, striking head-on.
Durkee, badly hurt, was rushed
!to an emergency hospital in San
| Carlos, where first aid was admin
istered. His injuries were too se
' vere, however, and he died in the
| hospital early yesterday morning.
Macrates' car, sprayed with gasoline
from a broken fuel linGe, burst into
flames after the crash, but he was
I thrown clear and uninjured.
