# Eager Eggers Disrupt Roble
## 
### 
Easter Sunday picnickers
and church-goers had to halt
their Easter parades yesterday
morning while their Roblc
dates hunted frantically for
candy eggs, and played will
ing nursemaids to a white rab
bit on the Roble lawn. Some
what hindered in their egg
gathering activities by several
candid camera fiends, almost
100 women searched the Roble
underbrush and ivy for approx
imately 30 minutes.
Despite laundry bags in
which to carry the loot, the
hunt ended in a tie between
Mary E. Smith and Jane Guc
rena. A solution was found in
an overtime period, with Jane
Guerena winning the grand
prize of a box of scented soaps
and powders. The consensus
of opinion seemed to be that
the hunt was great sport.
