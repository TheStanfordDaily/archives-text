## 
### 
All joy and ecstasy was Old Boy
Bob Hartmann yesterday as he de
scribed his "big beauu-tiff-al spring
Chappie" which will blossom all over
the Quad on Wednesday morn at
the balmy peep of dawn.
"First," the wrinkled-up petite
one said, "the readers will see the
cover of this issue. It will be a
beautiful cover by Bob Gillespie."
"That Shirley Temple thing is very
special," is all he would reveal about
"that Shirley Temple thing."
Pat Bosqui has done some repu
tedly beautiful tintype caricatures,
and the Awful Old Boy has written
a great story entitled "April Awa
kening."
There will be just lots of poems,
as befits the season. There will be
poems by Mellinkoff and there will
be poems by Overturf.
Ed Kerr has contributed an April
number called "Ermintrude and the
Little Bad." It will be about Er
mintrude and the little Bad. In
commenting on the beautiful spring
theme of this issue Hartman de
clared, "The theme will be spring
and beautiful."
