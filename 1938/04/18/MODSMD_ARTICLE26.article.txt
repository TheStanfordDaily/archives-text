# Committee Plans Farm Parliament
## Three-Party System For Political Union Adopted for Farm 
### 
Stanford Political Union will be
come a reality a week from Thurs
day if plans formulated at a meeting
Friday afternoon materialize. Orifii
.nator oi ' ie Union at Stanford is
Gerald Marcus, chairman of the
Peace Committee, who brought back
the idea from Yale on his recent
debate tour.
As he described the Union at Yale,
the organization is founded to fur
ther training in "practical demo
cratic procedure." Actually, it is
organized like the English House of
Parliament, consisting of Conserva
tive, Liberal, and Labor parties.
Members participate in debate from
the floor.
Membership Limited
Meetings are held every two
weeks, with discussion revolving
around questions of national and
international interest. Floor leaders
of the parties lead the debate, with
the rest of the members speaking as
they are recognized from the chair.
"At Yale," Marcus said, "the or
ganization has grown so in popu
larity that there is a large waiting
list of those applying for member
ship." Numbers representing all
three parties are limited to insure
a fairly equal balance of power be
tween them.
Meet April 28
Plans for a similar Union at Stan
ford were considered by a self
appointed committee brought to
gether by Marcus, and including
Mark Hopkins, president of the
Stanford A.S.U., Dick Riddell. elec
tion chairman, and Ed Kerr, de
bate manager.
With a few minor changes to lit
conditions here, the constitution of
the Yale Union will be presented to
i members at the first meeting to be
held on April 28. Applications for
membership will be placed at the
A.S.S.U. office. Applicants will be
given an opportunity to state their
party leanings, and, if possible, to
contactÂ«the heads of the parties,
Marcus said.
Initial party leaders will be Rid
dell, Conservative; Kerr, Liberal;
and Hopkins, Labor. Marcus will
preside at the first meeting, to be
held either in the Women's Club
house or in the Little Theater, and
will at that time describe the Union
and present the constitution for ap
| proval.
'Lot of Fun'
Although the primary purpose of
the Union is to give training in
parliamentary procedure and to
stimulate discussion on national and
international questions, Marcus
stressed the fact that, above all, "it
| is a lot of fun."
"At Yale,"he said, "the whole
I campus gets excited over the de
j bates, and discussions always have
I the authentic air of heated discus
| sion and confusion."
| Applications may be turned in
(throughout the early part of the
week. Near the end, party leaders
i and the organizing committee will
; elect the first members from the
| applicants.
