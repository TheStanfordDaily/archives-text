# History Repeats Itself—-Forty-fifth Time
## Card, Cal Track Teams Meet in Annual Classic 
### 
For the forty-fifth time since 1893, Stanford and California track teams
will face each other this Saturday.
Behind that string of 44 classic battles between two schools, consist
ently two of the greatest in American track, lies a grand story of come
through and victory, of heart-break and slaughter.
In only one year since the first annual Ilijj Meet in 1893 have the
schools failed to meet—in April, Mother Nature bestirred herself

in the Bay Region, and because of*
the disturbance the Big Meet had to j
be called off.
Stanford and California have piled
up 31 straight track and field bat
tles since that time without a miss, !
and they're going to make it 32 this
Saturday, unless we have another
earthquake.
California Picked
The consensus of pickers about :
the Bay Region this year concedes i
California the meet—California be- j
cause it has such depth on the track i
that it can afford to miss in the
weights and still be good enough to
win.
Should the Bears win, it will be
their eighteenth victory in the
c hain. Stanford has won 25, includ
ing 13 of the last 14. Two meets re
sulted in ties—in 1896 and 1922. The
present system of scoring, 15 events
totalling 131 points, was put into ef
fect in 1920. The 1922 tie was 65Va
-65 '/a.
Highest Score
Only once in the history of the
rivalry has one of the teams scored
more than 100 points. You don't
have to be such an old timer to re
member back to 1931, when Ben
Eastman, the Hables boys, Hector
Dyer, Here Laborde, Bob Jones and
a bunch of others mutilated the Ber
keley outfit 101 2-3 to 29 1-3. Cali
fornia had a couple of little triumphs
in that meet herself, even though
Stanford won 10 first places. Spud
Mossman tied the Big Meet record
for the two-mile at 9:38.2, and Ken
Churchill winged the javelin 220 ft.
9 inches for a new mark.
There have been some freak scores
along the line, one of the most un
usual being the 1912 final. Stanford

lost, 41 16-21 to 80 5-21. There was
a three-way tie for third in the high
jump, a two-way tie for first in the
pole vault, and a seven-way tie for
third in the pole vault. That was
one day when the Phi Bete had his
innings at a track meet.
Record Breaker
Interesting to note in that year
was the fact that eGorge Horine of
Stanford, winner of the Big Meet
high jump at 6 ft. 3% in., had
broken the world record in the
event less than a month before.
Against U.S.C. on March 29, 1912,
Horine jumped G ft. 6'/« inches, which
is still a tough height to reach.
Narrowest margin between the
two teams occurred in the next
meet, 1913, when Stanford won 61
1-5 to 60 4-5. The Daily Palo Alto,
more commonly known today as The
Stanford Daily, called the meet "the
most sensational ever held between
the Cardinal nad the Blue and Gold
and probably the closest athletic
competition ever staged in this
country."
The meet was decided by a run
off for second place in the 220, after

Paul McKee, Stanford, and "Fui"
Wood of Cal had run to a dead heat
behind Captain E. P. Campbell. It
was on McKee's suggestion that the
race be run over, and he beat Wood
by three yards to win for dear old
Stanford.
To quote the D.PA. (from which
originated the name "Dippy," inci
dentally): "The partisans on oppo
site sides waited intently as the two
runners came to the mark. Wood
was very nervous but McKee re
mained as cool as a cucumber."
The D.P.A. story on the meet was
equal to about three columns in the
present Stanford Daily.

ton soon gained their respect with
track teams that always seemed to
be around when the real racing be
gan. In 1930 they began to call him
a veteran, with a facetious averral
now and then to the old "Boy
Coach" nickname.
Templeton turned back one of the
greatest men in California athletic
history with his ninth straight de
-1 teat in Big Meets in 1932, when
venerable Walter Christie closed his
career with the Bears. Not from
i 1924 to his retirement in 1932 could
j "Old Walt" beat out Templeton's
j men. Dink dropped his first two
Big Meets to the beloved veteran,
| but from then on Stanford was
slightly tough to beat.
Big Names
A few of the names in Stanford's
track history of that period were
Biff Hoffman, Harlow Rothert, Herb
Fleischacker, Bill Richardson, Les
and Ike Hables, Gus Meier and
Cotto Herbert, George Grey and
"Nellie" Gray, "Tiny" Hartranft, Ted
Miller, Bob King, and "Swede"
Leistner. There were plenty of
others, world champions among
j them.
I To go back to that final Big Meet
{ of Walter Christie's, there are plenty
j who remember Bullet Bob Kiesel,
I and the two sprint records he set
! that day. The blond streamliner,
I who never was quite sure whether
he liked to sprint or not, was timed
in :9.0 for the 100 and:21.1 for the
220. George Anderson, the cripple
who seems to be making a brilliant
comeback this year, took Kiesel's 100
mark in 1935 with a sizzling :9.5, but
the Bullet still holds the record in
the furlong.
It was largely because of Kiesel
that Christie's team scored 51 5-6
points in 1932—previous to the meet
the Bears had been conceded a
chance for 33 points, with 40 an ab
solute maximum.
