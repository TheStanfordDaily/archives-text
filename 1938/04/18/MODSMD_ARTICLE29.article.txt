This week with no elections
and no politics, there is only
one pressing problem to be
solved on the Farm â€” Who is
going to win the Big Meet?
Walt Peterson, sports editor
of The Daily and dean of coast
college sport:; writers, tries to
find the answer in history.
And he finds the history of one
of the oldest sports rivalries in
the West a very interesting one
indeed.
