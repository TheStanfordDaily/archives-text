# Meet Stymies 'Blazing' Ben
## 
### 
While talkin over Big Meet rec- j
ords, there are some interesting j
sidelights that aren't often men- j
tioned. For instance, Big Ben East
man, who still holds the record for
the fastest 440 yards ever timed, at
:46.4, doesn't hold the Big Meet rec
ord for the quarter.
Bud Spencer, a Stanford world
champion who never held the
world's record, ran the Big Meet
quarter of 1928 in :48 flat. Archie
Williams, California's Olympic
champion Negro, bustled home in
the same time in 1936. The Blazer

i never got below :48.3 in a Big Meet
■ —that is explainable because of the
j fact that Ben ran those races to win,
j and not for time. He always had to
run the 880 and the relay on the
same afternoon.
Bill Richardson, one of the finest
| half-milers Stanford ever had. holds
the Big Meet record in the 880 at
1:53.8, but he, too, wasn't in East-
J man's class. Richardson's record
constitutes a great personal triumph
—he beat Elmer Boyden of Cal to
set the mark of 1926, after losing to
Boyden in 1925. In the 1925 duel
Boyden had set the Big Meet rec
ord of 1:54.1, a mark which also
I stood as the California standard un
j til Charlie Miller of the Bears ran
1:53.6 Saturday against Washington.
There is a distinct possibility that
both the 440 and 880 Big Meet rec
! ords will be broken this Saturday.
Captain Ray Malott of Stanford is
almost certain to run better than
:48, and the surprising Carl Ma
hurin may press and even beat Mil
. ler of Cal in better than 1:53.8.
Mile Mark Stands
How the mile record has with
stood Big Meet challengers since
1914 is one of the marvels of the
rivalry. Skin Wilson got dowp to
4:20.2, four seconds better than he
had ever done before, on that April
17. Since then no Stanford or Cali
fornia miler has been able to better
that record in a Big Meet. Wilson
had previously held the record at
4:2(i.(i.
Shotput Record
One more interesting record is
that set by John Lyman in the shot
put in 1934, 54 ft. 1 in. The put by
Lyman was his first of the afternoon,
and sent the Cards off to a flying
stall to win 81-50, when the meet
was supposed to be very close.
! His put made Lyman world rec
| ord holder, but he wasn't that way
i for long. The next day, in the Drake
Relays, Jack Torrance, Louisiana
j State's giant, pushed one out 55 ft.
1 1 i> in. to take over. Lyman still
I stands second only to Torrance in
i the history of shotputting.

Williams, California's Olympic
champion Negro, bustled home in
the same time in 1936. The Blazer

i never got below :48.3 in a Big Meet
■ —that is explainable because of the
j fact that Ben ran those races to win,
j and not for time. He always had to
run the 880 and the relay on the
same afternoon.
Bill Richardson, one of the finest
| half-milers Stanford ever had. holds
the Big Meet record in the 880 at
1:53.8, but he, too, wasn't in East-
J man's class. Richardson's record
constitutes a great personal triumph
—he beat Elmer Boyden of Cal to
set the mark of 1926, after losing to
Boyden in 1925. In the 1925 duel
Boyden had set the Big Meet rec
ord of 1:54.1, a mark which also
I stood as the California standard un
j til Charlie Miller of the Bears ran
1:53.6 Saturday against Washington.
There is a distinct possibility that
both the 440 and 880 Big Meet rec
! ords will be broken this Saturday.
Captain Ray Malott of Stanford is
almost certain to run better than
:48, and the surprising Carl Ma
hurin may press and even beat Mil
. ler of Cal in better than 1:53.8.
Mile Mark Stands
How the mile record has with
stood Big Meet challengers since
1914 is one of the marvels of the
rivalry. Skin Wilson got dowp to
4:20.2, four seconds better than he
had ever done before, on that April
17. Since then no Stanford or Cali
fornia miler has been able to better
that record in a Big Meet. Wilson
had previously held the record at
4:2(i.(i.
Shotput Record
One more interesting record is
that set by John Lyman in the shot
put in 1934, 54 ft. 1 in. The put by
Lyman was his first of the afternoon,
and sent the Cards off to a flying
stall to win 81-50, when the meet
was supposed to be very close.
! His put made Lyman world rec
| ord holder, but he wasn't that way
i for long. The next day, in the Drake
Relays, Jack Torrance, Louisiana
j State's giant, pushed one out 55 ft.
1 1 i> in. to take over. Lyman still
I stands second only to Torrance in
i the history of shotputting.
While talkin over Big Meet rec- j
ords, there are some interesting j
sidelights that aren't often men- j
tioned. For instance, Big Ben East
man, who still holds the record for
the fastest 440 yards ever timed, at
:46.4, doesn't hold the Big Meet rec
ord for the quarter.
Bud Spencer, a Stanford world
champion who never held the
world's record, ran the Big Meet
quarter of 1928 in :48 flat. Archie
Williams, California's Olympic
champion Negro, bustled home in
the same time in 1936. The Blazer
