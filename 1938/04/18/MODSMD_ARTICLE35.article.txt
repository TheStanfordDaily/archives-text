Editor's Note: This is the sec

ford's honorary fraternities.

Stanford's traditional bronze
block, symbolic of each year's grad
uating class, is now being prepared
in the school foundry by the Amer
ican Society of Mechanical Engi
neers. The huge plate, which weighs
220 pounds, was cast in the double
furnace last fall and will be worked
on until June.
History of the bronze numerals,
which stretch side by side in front
of Memorial Church, dates back to
the early 1900's. The first few grad
uating classes did not start the cus
tom, but afterwards inserted their
class numerals in order to complete
the series.
Beneath each polished plate is an

airtight lead box containing a Quad,
parchment listing graduates, and
class history. Blocks were first made
in San Francisco. During the past
few years, however, the A. S. M. E.
has undertaken the task, reducing
the cost more than S100.
The American Society of Me
chanical Engineers is an honorary
society open to all students major
ing in mechanical engineering. Only
upper division students are eli
gible. At present, there are 32
members in the society.
Albert Clarence Gulikson, assist
ant professor of mechanical engi
neering, is honorary chairman of
the group. Each year, a new fac
ulty sponsor is elected by members.
Student chairman is elected twice
a year. Bob Krupp is now chair
man. Other officers are Hugh Mac
pherson, treasurer, and Jack Hata,
I secretary.
