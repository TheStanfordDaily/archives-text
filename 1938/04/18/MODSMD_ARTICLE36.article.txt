# Winged 'O' Stars Rout Cardinal Trackmen
## Cards Bow As Olympics Win, 77-54 Varsity Meets First Defeat of Season; Burrows Wins Mile 
### JERRY MAYER 
Charley Hunter's Olympic Club
pulled a very dirty trick on Stanford
last Saturday on Angell Field. Sev
eral weeks ago the Winged O met
Cal and very obligingly showed up
with a team that represented about
half strength. Thereupon Cal pro
ceeded to swamp the clubmen.
However, Mr. Hunter then brings
a lull team down to Stanford — a
team that could trounce Cal easily
and even extend U.S.C. seriously.
Of course, the result is obvious—
Stanford met its first defeat of the
season by a 77-54 score.
Malott 111
Even then the score might have
been somewhat closer if Captain Ray
Malott hadn't shown up with a sore
throat. He ran second to Stan Hiser
man in the century and then felt so
miserable that he left for the hos
pital. He should be in shape for the
Big Meet Saturday.
Willi Malott out of the quarter
mile, Bob Young of the Club nab
bed the one-lap race in 48.9. Young
won by a couple of steps from game
Craig Williamson, who passed A 1
Blackman, Olympian, in his final
lunge for the finish mark.
The question as to whether Ed
Burrows can run a fast mile and
then come back in the two-mile is
still up in the air, because Ed got
duped last Saturday. In the mile,
Ed trailed Norm Bright all the way
until the stretch. Once they lev
eled out for the sprint to the tape
lanky Ed left the red-headed Olym
pic Games star eating his dust. Chuck
Nimmo, running for the club, ran
third all the way in a three-man
race.
Burrows Loses Two-mile
Burrows should have realized that
Bright wasn't in top shape after the
way he passed him in the mile.
However, lanky Ed entered the two
mile thinking Bright was still the
man to beat. He wasn't. While Bur
rows trailed Bright for six laps,
Johnny Wall, leather-lunged Winged
O star, was setting a tremendous
pace. Burrows finally passed Bright
and set out after Wall but he had
spotted him too much ground.
Wall won easily in 9:25.3, fastest
two-mile time on the Coast this
year. Burrows was second far
back and Bright had to sprint to
nose out Paul Ganahl of the Farm
for third.
Hiserman rang up the only double
triumph of the day when he added
the 220 to his win in the century.
In the highs Tom Moore snagged a
14.6 victory of the clubmen. Bill
Hawkins gave Moore a race for his
money but lost by two yards.
XXO Won by Mahurin
Carl Mahurin continued to lower
his competitive best mark in the
HBO when he nosed out Chuck Nim
mo by two feet in 1:55.8. Rusty
March, erstwhile miler, set the
pace for the first 6GO yards, but then
faded to take a poor third.
Indian broad jumpers retaliated
for Olympic Club sweeps in the low
hurdles and javelin by cleaning up
their event. Ray Brown missed hit
ting 23 feet by three-quarters of an
inch for his best mark of the season
Leo Madlem pulled the big surprise.
Without one day of practice behind
him this season, he unexpectedly
came out and catapulted himself 22
feet 3 inches for second place.
Russ WulfT, bespectacled Card
high jumper, reached G feet 6 inches
in his favorite event but had to be
satisfied with a tie as Humbert
Smith also reached that height for
the club.
