### 
SHANGHAI, Monday, April 18
(UP). â€” China's rejuvenated armies
battered more deeply into Japanese
lines in South Shansi Province to
day while to the east their comrades
stopped a series of Japanese sorties
northeast of Suchow-Fu and contin
ued their efforts to fight their way
into Yi-Hsien, where a Japanese
column is trapped.
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
China's supreme commander,
sought to cause the Japanese so
much trouble in Shansi and around
Shanghai and Peiping that they
would not dare to send major re
inforcements to the Suchow-Fu
front.
His guerillas were raiding near
Shanghai and Peiping and his Shansi
offensive was rolling steadily for
ward toward Japan's sector head
quarters in Changten, on the Pei
ping-Hankow Railway north of the
Yellow River.
