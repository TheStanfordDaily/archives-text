# Cards Commit Seven Errors; Cal Wins 12-1
## Bill Priest Fans Nine While Yielding Two Singles for Victory 
### 
Exhibiting a complete reversal of
I the heads-up brand of ball that car
ried them to victory in the first Big
Game a week ago, Stanford's var
sity baseballers booted their way to
a 12-1 walloping at the hands of
California's Bears at Berkeley Sat
urday, and lost a chance to clinch
the first Cal series in seven years
right then and there.
All told, the Bears collected 12 hits
off A 1 Lazzarone in seven innings
and Stanford committed seven er
rors in the field to account for Cal's
12 runs, only five of which were
earned. Take out the first, second,
and seventh innings, and the game
would have been closer than the
seore indicates.
From the third through the sixth
stanzas, Lazzarone set the Bears
down with no runs and two hits.
Glenn Hamilton, who pitched the
eighth frame, allowed no runs and
no safeties. Meanwhile, Bill Priest,
Cal mound ace, pitched two-hit ball
for the Bears, allowing one run,
which was unearned, while striking
out nine Indians and walking one.
Jimmy Coflfis led off the first
frame with a clean single, but died
on the base paths. In the ninth,
Glenn Hamilton collected a scratch
[hit to score Bill Jameson with
1 Stanford's lone tally. Between those
two stanzas, Priest shut the Cards
out with no hits, and set 21 men
down in order.
With the series tied up at one
game all, Stanford still has a chance
to break that seven-year jinx by
I taking the "rubber" game, next
Saturday on the Sunken Diamond.
