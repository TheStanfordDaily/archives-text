# Freshmen Lose Ball Game 9-0 To Cal Cubs
## Thompson Allows 15 Hits, Strikes 9; Hears Take Series 
### 
| Behind a barrage of short infield
hits, the Cal Cubs spanked the Card \
frosh baseball nine to the devastat
ing tune of nine runs to nothing, j
Friday on the freshman diamond, to!
continue the Bear winning streak in i
the freshman diamond tilts to 12
years in a row.
The Cal batting line-up had a
gala day at the plate, banging out
15 hits off the offerings of the Card
ace, "Cootie" Thompson, who walk- j
\ ed two men while striking out nine, j
"Lefty" Mike Koll, on the mound ;
for the Cubs, allowed but six scat- j
tered hits and walked none, while j
amassing eight strikeouts.
Bid in Fourth
The only scoring bid of the Pap
poses came in the fourth inning,
j with the score thr«e to nothing
j against them. With Pfyl out at first
on a close decision, Thor Peterson
| knocked a hot one to short and was
! safe on a bad throw. Har Harbke
came through with a grounder
through third base that landed Pet
j erson on second and himself on
I first. Both advanced one base on
Bull's sacrifice bunt but the threat
ended there when Jimmy McCloud's
j long fly was gathered in by the Bear
| centerfielder to retire the side.
The Cubs turned on the heat from
; the very start when the first man
I up in the first half of the first inning
met the second pitched ball for a
■ two-bagger and added a base when
the throw in was muffed at second.
! The second man up whiffed at three
strikes and the third man knocked
! out a long fly to score the base run- ,
| ner after the catch.
One in First
Only one run came in for the
J Cubs in the first inning, but capi- |
talizing on fluke hits that came when j
I they counted most, they added two j
j in the fourth, four in the fifth, and j
went on to score a run in the sixth
and the eighth.
< In spite of the 15 base hits marked !
' against him, Quentin Thompson of I
the frosh was only touched for two |
I real hits. The remainder were j
looping flies that barely cleared the j
infield to land safe. Still the score- i
j board showed that these pop hits!
| were better than no Stanford hits '
' at all.
In addition to the pitcher's duel
: between Thompson and Koll, it |
j turned out to be a fight between the |
| two for batting honors. Thompson :
hit safely three times out of three
; to lead the batting averages for the
1 day. Koll struck out once, got a one- !
| bagger, and lifted a fast one to right !
j field for an eighth inning homer.
