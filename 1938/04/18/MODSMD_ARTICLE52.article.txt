# A 						Couple of Good Ideas— On Peace
## 
### 
IN these days when war seems to be the most
popular outdoor sport, it is not surprising to
find that the elimination of war is the favorite
subject of conversation. In drawing-room small
talk, it leads sex by a good length. Magazines
run pictures of battle fields that make you won
der if you can keep your lunch under control.
Last fall The Daily commented on the courses
in war and its causes being given by several
New York universities. A letter in the Campus
Opinion column this morning demands the
same thing for Stanford.
If we had a course in the origins of war, we
could hold our own in any man's parlor. But
Stanford can give us something much better
than that. It can give us a course in practical
peace.
In all of our talk about war the word "peace"
is shouldered and shoved around like a midget
in a football crowd. The shouting and arguing
are done in the name of peace. The pictures
that veto the laws of digestion are justified as
peace propaganda.
But no one seems to have any idea of what
peace is or how we can get it. Most of us think
of peace as a vague state of affairs where you
have a reasonable chance of waking up in the
morning without finding the street full of shat
tered bodies like that retouched photo in the
Hearst rotogravure. Beyond that most of our
ideas on peace run along stained-glass window
lines.
The talking and the pictures have done their
part. They have made us interested in peace.
But they have taught us nothing about it. If
we are to gain anything from the entuhisasm
we have worked up, we must learn how to
apply it.
Stanford could give us a course that would
teach what peace is. It could present a pattern
of cause and effect to replace our misty picture.
It could teach us to think of peace as a dynamic
relationship instead of a feeble dove with a
mouthful of olive branch.
In doing this Stanford would do more to es
tablish peace than all the pictures that ever
stampeded a man's stomach.
All of us want peace. The trouble is that
we don't know what it is or how we can get it.
A course in peace would give us a blue print
to work with instead of a childish drawing.
In organization the course would present no
difficulties. Probably it would work best as a
symposium. Professors in Political Science,
Economics, and Sociology could lecture. Sylla
bus and bibliography would not be hard to ar
range.
There is no reason why we could not have
such a course. We have men qualified to teach
it; we have the interest and the need for it.
A course in practical peace would not cause
any overnight boom in the sword-into-plough
sharc industry. But it might give us an idea of
what we can do to create peace. Then perhaps
the draft would not find us sitting, talk
ing about how ghastly war is.—J. C.
