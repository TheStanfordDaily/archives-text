# ... and Political Union
## 
### 
WHEN Gerald Marcus took a quarter off to
go debating across the country, he kept his
eyes open. Consequently, he succeeded in
picking up the most original idea to come to
Stanford in a long while.
It was at Yale that he was introduced to the
Political Union idea, saw it in action, and re
turned with an enthusiasm which is soon to give
Stanford its first whack at practical political pro
cedure. Like Yale's, Stanford's Union will be
patterned after the English House of Parliament.
Debate on national and international questions
will be led by party leaders, with members join
ing in as recognized from the chair.
On the face of it, the Union looks like a glori
fied bull session. But it has an air of authenticity
which keeps the Yale campus in an uproar
before Union metings. And provincial as Stan
ford is, it shouldn't be long before people will
be dropping books and dates at the word: "Po
litical Union tonight."
Theoretically, the idea has enough merits to
make one wonder why it hasn't been started
before. Its major benefit is that it arouses the
campus to an interest in, and a knowledge of,
national problems. Though results are no more
conclusive than those which emerge from a
second-floor room at three-thirty in the morning,
the actual process of studying and discussing

important problems is worth an evening off
any time.
For, according to Marcus, Yale Unionites get
more excited during debates than a kid on his
first date. Collars melt, voices grow hoarse,
smoke rises, and the party's on.
Perhaps the Political Union will be greeted
on the campus as Stanford welcomes most new
ideas —with a shrug of the shoulders and a
return to more important problems—like a date
to the house formal. But somehow we're enthu
siastic enough about the thing to think that here,
too, collars will melt, and voices grow hoarse.
Line forms on the right.—J. S.
