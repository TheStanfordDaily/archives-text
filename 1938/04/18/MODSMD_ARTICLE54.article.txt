REALISM
OEALISTICALLY, Prime Minister Chamberlain
forced Anthony Eden the idealist out of his Cabi
net; realistically, he permitted Adolf Hitler to enter
Vienna; realistically, he avoided pledging British .sup
port to Czechoslovakia; realistically, he exchanged
consular agents with Francisco Franco; and now, for a
realistic Easter present to his people and the world, he
has had signed the long-awaited, highly-touted Anglo-
Italian accord, which recognizes in a very realistic
manner that ideals are nice, but not quite so import
ant as realism.
What the results of this policy will be for Mr.
Chamberlain and his empire, no one can say. He has
stipulated in the treaty that it shall not become oper
ative until the last Italian troops is withdrawn from
Spanish soil, but since the war is practically over
anyway, that clause begins to look like merely a gra
cious recognition of an almost-accomplished fact.
He has agreed to get the League of Nations to
recognize the conquest of Ethiopia, but since it is
composed of many highly individual states, most of
whom hate II Duce and all his works with a classic
hatred, that clause begins to look like a rather larger
piece of boloney than he is prepared to chew.
He has agreed to recognize Italian interests in the
Mediterranean, in return for Italian recognition of
Britain's life-line through that sea, but since "inter
ests" and "life-line" mean nothing at all when the
moment for imperative action arrives, that clause be
gins to look like a rather sorry attempt to be very
friendly about a conflict which is inevitable by its
very nature.
He has agreed to safeguard Italy's interests in
Palestine if Britain withdraws from that mandate,
but since nothing is said about the cessation of anti-
British broadcasts from Rome, that clause begins to
look like a very clever Italian way of having your
pie and eating it too.
About the only constructive things Mr. Chamber
lain has got from his realistic treaty are the Italian
promise to take no Spanish territory in Africa, and
the Italian promise to call a halt to further fortification
and strengthening of Mediterranean bases.
Backed by a rubber-stamp Parliament, secure in a
position to which he rose by seniority rather than
election, adamant in his refusal to take his policy to
the country, Mr. Chamberlain has an attitude toward
his people much like that of Mussolini, with whom he
has just become so friendly. For his sake, one hopes
he can manage to convince them that he is right. One
hopes that nothing happens to destroy his treaty be
fore it can be made to work.
For if it does, Mr. Chamberlain will probably have
realismed himself right out of office; and if that
should happen, world opinion might show an ungrate
fully realistic tendency to be sincerely and devoutly
glad.
