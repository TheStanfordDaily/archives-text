# GOIN' MY WAY

IT'S till over now, but this last week-end was a mile
stone in eampus dramatics. "Kind Lady," to put it
as categorically as I can, was the finest work I have
seen done here, and I have been going to campus plays
ofT and on for the past ten years. It was as nearly per
fect as any work of art can be.
The cast, made up of old stand-bys, played far
above anything that they have yet attempted. Not
only were the leading roles handled incredibly well,
but the minor parts became nearly equal to any of the
tops by the fine work of their actors.
Perhaps "Kind Lady" isn't the greatest play ever
written. But as far as effectiveness goes, as it was
achieved last week-end, you will go a long way before
you find a better play. However, done in an average
way, it could be a miserable failure. It's power comes
from long, sustained action, not sudden outbursts of
theatrical stage technique. But handled as it was by
H. Miles Heberer, the director, it affected the audience
in a way which is unique in my experience.

r JPO Mr. Heberer go first honors. It was he who was
responsible, as director, for a slow tempo which,
necessary to the play, would have been suicide if his
actors could not meet the requirements. It was his
performance, played on a responsive and thoroughly
adequate instrument—the combination of "Kind Lady"
and the cast. By him, the show was lifted far above
the usual plane of college dramatics.
For the cast, an armful of bouquets all round.
Kay Campbell, who put the clincher on the suspicion
we have been having this year that she is Stanford's
most accomplished actress, must be spoken of first.
Her characterization of Mary Herries set the mood of
the whole performance by the time the curtain had
dropped on the short prologue. But it would take a
week or two to do adequate justice to her work.
Next in line should come Hal Kahn, with his work
as Henry Abbott. Without raising his voice above a
speaking tone, without a sinister gesture or ominous
leer, he dominated the whole stage. Without you quite
realizing how, he integrated every motion, innocent
enough apparently, into a whole which was almost
terrifying in its quietness.
But in spite of these two remarkable jobs, we will
pick out Melba Rae Toombs for the work which will
be remembered longest. Her Mrs. Edwards was the
real thing, not an actor's impression of a low-class,
rheumatic woman. Of course, saying this is an even
higher tribute to the actor than is usually given, be
cause it takes an actor to make the real thing effective.
We haven't enough room to go on any further. We
will have to be content with acclaiming the rest of the
cast, from J. P. Kahn to Kay Kalenborn, as superla
tive.
In fact, superlative seems to cover the whole thing.
From the setting to the most minute detail of the ac
tor's characterization, it was superlative. I saw the
performance twice, and am considering circulating a
petition to have it played the rest of the quarter.
