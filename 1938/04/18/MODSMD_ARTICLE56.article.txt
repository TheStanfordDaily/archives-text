# CAMPUS OPINION
## COURSE ON PEACE? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What with Peace Day coming up,
and all this talk of peace and the
evils of war permeating the air at
this time of the year; and what with '
people thinking more of spring (and
rightfully so) than of worldly prob
lems, why should not this business
of educating people in the means and
methods of war be done more sys
tematically?
At present Peace and the efforts
of Peace Day committees and what
not are mere playthings given to the
students to keep them quiet. It is
well known that students' rash ideas
of solving the question are not tak
en seriously by either their fellow
students or anyone else. Therefore,
why not place the problem where
it will be taken seriously, and done
properly without the prevalent rash
ness?
War Course
What could be better than a good,
sober, objective, symposium course
under the sociology department on
the subject of "War: its agencies,
causes, methods and effects." It
could be conducted by having a
principal teacher, aided by lectures
from historians, economists and oth
ers who would give objective talks
on different subjects relating to the
course.
This would not involve all per
sonal opinion; Lord knows we get
that too much — that's the trouble
now. So dignified and helpful could
such a course be that Stanford
would earn a name for leading the
educational field in taking this im
portant subject and conducting it on j
the level upon which it belongs.
Fields Opened
Research fields would be opened ,
for the historian in social history, !
the economics student, the sociology
major and others. All would be cor
related into making this course sue- '
cessful and helpful. After all, re- '
search and knowledge are useless i
unless disseminated for the public j
good, which, after all, is the object 1
of education.
Perhaps the Carnegie Peace
Foundation would aid financially in j
such a project; the Stanford student
would have a course that would aid
his cultural outlook upon the world. I
It would harmonize with Dr. Wil
bur's idea for year-around peace
activity.
I say that this is a field wide open
in all ways, and one that clamors i
for proper treatment. We must 1
reconcile ourselves to the fact that |
unless this whole problem is done I
properly it will never be done at all,
and surely our amateur efforts are j
at present no good at all.

lems, why should not this business
of educating people in the means and
methods of war be done more sys
tematically?
At present Peace and the efforts
of Peace Day committees and what
not are mere playthings given to the
students to keep them quiet. It is
well known that students' rash ideas
of solving the question are not tak
en seriously by either their fellow
students or anyone else. Therefore,
why not place the problem where
it will be taken seriously, and done
properly without the prevalent rash
ness?
War Course
What could be better than a good,
sober, objective, symposium course
under the sociology department on
the subject of "War: its agencies,
causes, methods and effects." It
could be conducted by having a
principal teacher, aided by lectures
from historians, economists and oth
ers who would give objective talks
on different subjects relating to the
course.
This would not involve all per
sonal opinion; Lord knows we get
that too much — that's the trouble
now. So dignified and helpful could
such a course be that Stanford
would earn a name for leading the
educational field in taking this im
portant subject and conducting it on j
the level upon which it belongs.
Fields Opened
Research fields would be opened ,
for the historian in social history, !
the economics student, the sociology
major and others. All would be cor
related into making this course sue- '
cessful and helpful. After all, re- '
search and knowledge are useless i
unless disseminated for the public j
good, which, after all, is the object 1
of education.
Perhaps the Carnegie Peace
Foundation would aid financially in j
such a project; the Stanford student
would have a course that would aid
his cultural outlook upon the world. I
It would harmonize with Dr. Wil
bur's idea for year-around peace
activity.
I say that this is a field wide open
in all ways, and one that clamors i
for proper treatment. We must 1
reconcile ourselves to the fact that |
unless this whole problem is done I
properly it will never be done at all,
and surely our amateur efforts are j
at present no good at all.

The Editor, Sir:
What with Peace Day coming up,
and all this talk of peace and the
evils of war permeating the air at
this time of the year; and what with '
people thinking more of spring (and
rightfully so) than of worldly prob
lems, why should not this business
of educating people in the means and
methods of war be done more sys
tematically?
At present Peace and the efforts
of Peace Day committees and what

of solving the question are not tak
en seriously by either their fellow
