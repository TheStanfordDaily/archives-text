# Temple Fails In 'Rebecca,' Reviewer Says
## 
### 
"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,"
currently playing at the Fox-Stan
ford: Making mighty free with Kate
Douglas Wiggin's calico bucolic,
Hollywood producers hamstring a

juvenile favorite
with this late ver
sion of "Rebecca."
Not that a cer
tain license with a
maudlin old yarn
is in itself objec
tionable. But be
yond skeletonizing
the original to a
mere title, this
sloppy jumble of
52nd Street patter,

New York radio, and life on the
farm has neither point nor consist
ency.
It develops that the sponsors of
"Crackly Corn Flakes" are searching
frantically lor a child star when
Shirley Temple pops handily up.
But, through a prank of fate, on
the very brink of fame Miss Temple
drops from sight when her penniless
step-father foists her off on Aunt
Mirandy of Sunnybrook Farm.
Aunt Mirandy has a firm predi
lection against show business, puts
her foot down when Shirley Li re
discovered by the producer of the
"Crackly Corn Flakes" program who
dwells conveniently next door.
Through all this, it is Miss Tem

| pie's frequent assertion that she is
, "vewy self-reliant." Figure out the
! rest for yourselves.
In this conscienceless hodgepodge,
jit becomes increasingly clear that
though Miss Temple may still fool
| the kiddies, her baby antics have
I begun to curdle, that her acting has
| become self-conscious, and her smile
| a trade-mark.
The producers of "Rebecca of
j Sunny brook Farm" shot wide of the
clay pigeon from every angle.
