rivalries of "the two Har
ry's" of Pacific Coast maritime
trade unionism, Bridges of the long
shoremen and the Committee for
Industrial Organization, and Lund
berg of the independent Sailors Un
ion, has long been confined to vio
lent but harmless verbal pyrotech
nics.
Yesterday this rivalry was ex
pressed not on the union rostrum
but near Embarcadero docks, and
resulted in one of the most serious
jurisdictional brawls in the recent
history of American labor.
Hundreds of sailors and long
shoremen pumineled and clubbed
each other in front of San Fran
cisco's Pier 41, before poliee broke
up the battle which brought in
juries to .'55.
Cause of the outbreak was that
longshoremen attempted to go
through a picket line of 20 sailors,
thrown around the Shcpard Line
freighter Sea Thrush. Sailors'
spokesmen charged that the com
pany bad violated its contracts by
hiring a crew from the National
Maritime Union, eastern C.1.0. af
filiate headed by Bridges' friend,
Joseph Curran.
Both the company and the long
shoreman rejoined that the National
Labor Relations Board had desig
nated the N.M.U. as bargaining
agent for Shepard Line deck work
ers. Before yesterday's battle,
which was the first outbreak in a
dispute that began last week in Se
al tie and Portland, longshoremen
asked the sailors to submit the dis
pute to the Maritime Federation of
the Pacific for settlement.
An early settlement is not predict
ed, since Lundberg has threatened
to pull all 8000 of his union's mem
bers off "every ship on the Pacific
Coast."

Reports from Shanghai were that
the biggest battle in modern Oriental
history is near. China was believed
to be rushing 1.000,000 troops into
Southern Shantung province, where
500,000 Japanese await them.
Chinese asserted that Japanese
have abandoned hundreds of
square miles of previously con
quered territory in Shansi and
tlonan provinces and have with
drawn to positions threatening
Suchow, at the junction of the
Lunghai and Tientsin - Nanking
railroads.
Summary: Insurgents claim that
<20,000 Loyalists, including American
International Brigade members,
have been trapped near the sub
urbs of Tortosa. Loyalist planes
failed to halt landing of Rebel
troops at Vinaroz from the Balearic
Islands. Dr. Francis E. Town
send s hope to become an impris
oned martyr for his old age pension
movement was ended by a Presi
dential pardon releasing him from a
uO-day sentence.

expansion bill.

Reports from Shanghai were that
the biggest battle in modern Oriental
history is near. China was believed
to be rushing 1.000,000 troops into
Southern Shantung province, where
500,000 Japanese await them.
Chinese asserted that Japanese
have abandoned hundreds of
square miles of previously con
quered territory in Shansi and
tlonan provinces and have with
drawn to positions threatening
Suchow, at the junction of the
Lunghai and Tientsin - Nanking
railroads.
Summary: Insurgents claim that
<20,000 Loyalists, including American
International Brigade members,
have been trapped near the sub
urbs of Tortosa. Loyalist planes
failed to halt landing of Rebel
troops at Vinaroz from the Balearic
Islands. Dr. Francis E. Town
