# Professors Okay Peace, War Course
## Robinson, Hilgard, Buck, Savelle See Value in Proposal 
### 
"A course in the causes of war and
the methods of avoiding it could be
taught in American universities and
would definitely be beneficial."
This was the reply which Dr. Er
nest Hilgard, associate professor of
psychology and education, made yes
terday when asked to state his
opinion of the proposal that Stan
ford offer such a course. Of the
four other faculty members ques
tioned, two agreed strongly with Dr.
Hilgard; two agreed with reserva
tions.
Dr. Hilgard's comments referred
to the possibility of presenting a
course in causes of war, the pro
posed remedies, and the methods of
prevention.
Vital Issue
All of the professors -questioned
agreed that the subject was vitally
important and should be studied.
Dr Max Savelle, associate
professor of history, summed up
opinion when he said, '"War is one
of the most important of institutions
all over the world. A great part of
our political and economic organi
zation revolves around it. A study
of it would have as much or more
value than the study of any other
institution."
Dr. Hilgard, Dr. Savelle, and Dr.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, professor
of history, felt that a course in the
factors causing war could be given
without great difficulty and would
produce "very beneficial" effects.
Sees Dilliculty
Dr. Theodore Boggs, professor of
economics, agreed that the course
was practicable, but felt that there
were difficulties in organization. He
suggested that it be given for a
quarter without credit to provide an
indication of interest and to facili
tate choice of material and presen
tation.
Dr. Philip Buck, assistant profes
sor of political science, was more
pessimistic. The course, he said,
would be "extremely interesting if
it could be organized." But he
thought that it would be almost im
possible to present any integrated
material on the subject without fall
ing into vague generalizations. He
preferred to approach the problem
through specific studies of the va
rious angles.
Jordan's Course
Dr. Robinson did not agree. "This
course on one of the outstanding
problems of the human race should
be given." He pointed to a similar
course, given by David Starr Jordan
as an example of successful experi
mentation in the field.
Such a course, he said, must not
pretend to know all the answers and
must not urge some particular pro
gram. It must approach the theories
of war and its causes and remedies
from a standpoint of critical evalua
tion.
If this were done, he said, it might
not help the cause of peace directly,
but it would give an understanding
and knowledge that is always help
ful. It would be "much more satis
fying than attempting to deal with
the pi'oblem by sudden mustering of
opinion."
Promote Peace Study
Dr. Hilgard and Dr. Savelle also
stressed the value the course would
have in promoting objective and in
telligent consideration of the prob
lems of peace and war. "It would
tend," said Dr. Savelle, "to put the
cause of peace on a much more ob
jective and cool-hcaded basis than
it now is. It would lead to sound
reasoning."
"A properly designed course," said
Dr. Hilgard, "would create more in
telligent attitudes. And people cer
tainly must be made to think more
intelligently about the problem.
Anything the course could do here
would be tremendously valuable."
