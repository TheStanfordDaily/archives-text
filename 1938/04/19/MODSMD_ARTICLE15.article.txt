# R.O.T.C. To Hold Review Monday
## 
### 
With mounted and unmounted
troops parading to the music of the
band, the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit
will present its eighteenth anual
field review on the polo field Mon
day, April 25, at 1:30 o'clock before
Miyor General Bowley, commander
of the Ninth Corps Area.
For the first time in several years
the entire unit, consisting of both
the field artillery and ordnance di
visions, will participate in the re
view. In the past the ordnance de
partment has not had a hand in the
maneuvers, but next Monday it will
form one of the unmounted batteries
in the company battalion.
Commanded entirely by student
officers, the battalion will go
through a series of parade forma
tions, followed by a realistic war
maneuver consisting or three field
artillery batteries going into action
and simulating actual fire.
Awards for conspicuous work in
various departments of the Reserve
Corps will be presented by General
Bowley to juniors and seniors who,
in the opinion of the faculty judges,
have best lived up to the ideals and
spirit of the military unit. Award
winners are as yet unannounced.
Faculty officers in charge of the
maneuvers are Colonel Peyton, Ma
jor Allen, Captain Bird, and Cap
tain Grubbs.
