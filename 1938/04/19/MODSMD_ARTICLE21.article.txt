# Farm To Have Political Union Based On Oxford, Yale Clubs
## 
### 
From Oxford and Cambridge,
through Yale, to Stanford.
That is the history of the Polit
ical Union which will be introduced
to Stanford a week from Thursday
by self-appointed Co-chairmen Ger
ald Marcus, Ed Kerr, Mark Hopkins,
and Dick Riddell.
Marcus is responsible for bring
ing the idea to Stanford. On his re
cent debate tour, he saw the Yale
Political Union in action, set to work
on his return to establish such an
organization at Stanford.
Favored in England
The Unions originally founded at
Oxford and Cambridge, and copied
by Yale, have a basic purpose of
training students for an active life
in democracy. By practical applica
tion of theory in actual debate, its
founders believed that the Union
would supplement the teaching of
the university by giving prepara
tion in political and public forum.
In practice, according to Marcus,
the organization is not quite so aca
demic as the prospectus of the Un
ion would have one believe. Instead,
it turns into more fun than politics,
In' says. But because he believes in
the value of the training the Union
ran give, plus the entertainment,
Stanford will have a Political Union.
Reproduces Parliament
Yale's Union, constructed as it is
like the English House of Parlia
ment, carries out the air of authen
licity even more by holding its
meetings in a miniature reproduc
tion of the actual English House.
The building was donated by some
philanthropic alumnus. Stanford
will be content with Memorial Hall
Little Theater, or the Women's
Clubhouse.
Backbone of the Union is its divi
sion into three major parties, con
servative, liberal, and labor. The
three temporary leaders of Stan
ford's parties will be Dick Riddell,
Ed Kerr, and Mark Hopkins, respec
tively. The leaders open debate with
10-minute speeches, and then the
meeting is thrown open by the
chairman to discussion from the
door. To prevent debate from be
coming too involved, a limit is placed
on length of speeches, and on the
number of amendments which may
be made to the original proposition.
Applications Due
Membership to Stanford's Union
may be had by application at the
A.S.S.U. Requests for admission
should be turned in by April 25, at
which time party leaders elect the
first members. By the constitution,
which will be presented for adoption
at the first meeting, this function is
carried on by a Committee of Elec
tions, chosen by the House.
Other committees which keep
House machinery in order are the
Standing Committee, which calls
meetings, and chooses debate top
ics; and the House Committee,
which makes necessary arrange
ments for meetings.
Yale Union also has a Board of
Trustees, whose main purpose is to
handle investments of Union funds.
The planning committee concluded
that Stanford could get along with
out such a board, since, as Marcus
said, ''We won't be worrying about
money for a while yet."
Members follow parliamentary
procedure during meetings. The
gallery is open to visitors for ob
servation, but not for actual debate.

ran give, plus the entertainment,
Stanford will have a Political Union.
Reproduces Parliament
Yale's Union, constructed as it is
like the English House of Parlia
ment, carries out the air of authen
licity even more by holding its
meetings in a miniature reproduc
tion of the actual English House.
The building was donated by some
philanthropic alumnus. Stanford
will be content with Memorial Hall
Little Theater, or the Women's
Clubhouse.
Backbone of the Union is its divi
sion into three major parties, con
servative, liberal, and labor. The
three temporary leaders of Stan
ford's parties will be Dick Riddell,
Ed Kerr, and Mark Hopkins, respec
tively. The leaders open debate with
10-minute speeches, and then the
meeting is thrown open by the
chairman to discussion from the
door. To prevent debate from be
coming too involved, a limit is placed
on length of speeches, and on the
number of amendments which may
be made to the original proposition.
Applications Due
Membership to Stanford's Union
may be had by application at the
A.S.S.U. Requests for admission
should be turned in by April 25, at
which time party leaders elect the
first members. By the constitution,
which will be presented for adoption
at the first meeting, this function is
carried on by a Committee of Elec
tions, chosen by the House.
Other committees which keep
House machinery in order are the
Standing Committee, which calls
meetings, and chooses debate top
ics; and the House Committee,
which makes necessary arrange
ments for meetings.
Yale Union also has a Board of
Trustees, whose main purpose is to
handle investments of Union funds.
The planning committee concluded
that Stanford could get along with
out such a board, since, as Marcus
said, ''We won't be worrying about
money for a while yet."
Members follow parliamentary
procedure during meetings. The
gallery is open to visitors for ob
servation, but not for actual debate.
From Oxford and Cambridge,
through Yale, to Stanford.
That is the history of the Polit
ical Union which will be introduced
to Stanford a week from Thursday
by self-appointed Co-chairmen Ger
ald Marcus, Ed Kerr, Mark Hopkins,
and Dick Riddell.
Marcus is responsible for bring
ing the idea to Stanford. On his re
cent debate tour, he saw the Yale
Political Union in action, set to work
on his return to establish such an
organization at Stanford.
Favored in England
The Unions originally founded at
Oxford and Cambridge, and copied
by Yale, have a basic purpose of
training students for an active life
in democracy. By practical applica
tion of theory in actual debate, its
founders believed that the Union
would supplement the teaching of
the university by giving prepara
tion in political and public forum.
In practice, according to Marcus,
the organization is not quite so aca
demic as the prospectus of the Un
ion would have one believe. Instead,
it turns into more fun than politics,
In' says. But because he believes in
the value of the training the Union
ran give, plus the entertainment,
Stanford will have a Political Union.
