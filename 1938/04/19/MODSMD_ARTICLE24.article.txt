# Professor Criticizes Requirement System
## 
### 
"Let the freshmen loaf . . . then
place before him thoroughly at
tractive courses, and the same ap
petite which brought him to college
will not allow him to abstain from
consuming as many new ideas as he
is capable of digesting."
Thus, Professor Harry Beal Tor
rey, who left Stanford last week to
travel east and resume medical
practice, diametrically opposes the
college-requirement system.
"When students use five days
spent at college studies as an excuse
for spending two days in 'running
away' from studies, there is an in
dication that the essential purposes
of a university are not functioning.
Talent May Appear
"I like to think that universities
spread before us limitless fields for
imaginative exploration. Now, as we
work in these fields, intent upon
their problems, there may flash out
in us — as has often happened in
others—the sudden realization of a
taste, an ambition, a recognition of
new values, that we have never ex
perienced before."
Professor Torrey continued:
"New-found capacities emerge as
though they had just been created,
genes come into action that have
hitherto been obscured."
Therefore, the elective system, in
as full a play as might be possible
in institutional education, Professor
Torrey believes should be the aim
of the university; this, and not the
straight-jacket regimentation of re
quired courses. Also, mutual group
interest should bring together stu
dents and students, faculty and stu
dents, faculty and faculty.
More Sociability
"Get-together machinery of Stan
ford needs oiling," remarked Pro
fessor Torrey.
As one of the founders of the Biol
ogy Seminar at Stanford he ex
pressed his opinion along this line:
"I am greatly interested in the
Biology Seminar not only for the
work done by individual speakers
but as a group activity, bringing to
gether all the biological-science in
terests.
"And I am for the same reason in
terested in the Stanford chapter of
the American Association of Uni
versity Professors which is making
the first effective attempt to connect
the segregated links of Stanford's
departmentalized faculty, and to
give it a united voice as the faculty
of the University interested in the
University administration as well as
research problems. This association
recently has done more than any
other device on the campus to help

the faculty become 'group-con
scious' and to ferment ideas and ac
tivities."
Concluding, Dr. Torrey added:
"After 10 years of knowing Stanford
people—both students and faculty—
1 think they are a fine bunch."
