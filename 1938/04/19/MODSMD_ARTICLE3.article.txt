### 
Members of next year's Ex Com
mittee, elected last Tuesday, are ex
pected to attend tonight's meeting
at 7:15 o'clock, President Tom Kil
lefer has announced.
"Elections were held earlier than
usual this year so new members can
learn the ropes before they take of
fice," Killefer said yesterday.
Students who will take over Ex
Committee posts next year are H. B.
Lee, Betty Davis, Bob Mangan, John
Partridge, Andy Stojkovich, Pat
Skinner, Annabelle Clark, and Wil
liam Turner.
Now that A.S.S.U.'s new filing
cabinet for student activities has
been bought, Ed Barnett and John
Dern will report tonight on how
they think the file should be oper
ated.
Final action is expected to be taken
on Stagers' $500 scholarship for a
technical student in the Division of
Speech and Drama. The subject was
introduced last week by Clay Mc-
Daniel, dramatic manager, and Paul
Crary, president of Stagers.
To help committeemen decide
whether or not wrestling should be
made a minor sport at Stanford,
Harry Maloney probably will appear
at the meeting tonight, Killefer said.
Marvin Larson advocated such a
move last week.
