the end of the baseball sea
son hieing itself upon us, there
comes the opportunity to pick all
league teams and think what your
school could do with a team like
that.
Jim Lawson, assistant to Harry
Wolter in coaching the Stanford
varsity, has come up with an all
star team that looks pretty good. He
takes issue with the team selected
by Coach Earl Sheely of St. Mary's,
but that's another story for another
time.
Lawson, popularly known as the
Adonis of the coaching stall (an
honor strongly protested by Tiny
Thornhill), gives U.S.C. the bal
ance of power in his mythical
nine. Excluding pitchers, his
team would have live U.S.C.
players.
The entire infield playing for Sam
Barry looks like the berries to Law
son. Murdock at first, Lilly at sec
ond, Tanner at third and Soiling at
shortstop are his selections, of
which Seiling, an Ail-American
from 'way back, is the shining
light.
AI Lingua, St. Mary's, is the best
catcher in the loop, surpassing such
as Lombardi of Cal and Jameson of
Stanford, Lawson thinks. Already
signed with Boston, Lingua is a
great prospect for major league
brilliance.
The outfield selected by Blond
Jim posts llook DeVaurs of Cal,
Alex Pctrushkin of U.S.C., and
John Carter of U.C.L.A. The first
is Lawson's idea of the classiest
ball player, regardless of position,
in the C.1.8.A. He can hit and he
can lield, like nobody's business,
and lie's no slouch when lie gets
on base, which is often.
Petrushkin's ability stands un
questioned, after two fine years in
the field and on the mound for the
Trojans. John Carter is another fine
fielder who pitches now and then.
Both Carter and Petrushkin are
strong- hitters, the latter probably a
little better.
One possible weakness, depending
upon how you look at it, is the fact
that the entire outfield is left
handed.
The list of pitchers mentions
Brewer of U.S.C., Priest of Cal,
Greenlaw of St. Mary's, and Laz
zarone of Stanford. The first
three were touted before the sea
son opened, and they have lived up
to their reputations. Lazzarone,
pretty much of a dark horse as
lar as the rest of the league was
concerned, turned up some good,
if not brilliant, work and earns a
place with the first four liurlers in
the association, Lawson thinks.
Ah, yes—the omission of Ken
Washington, U.C.L.A. Negro short
stop and leading hitter in the league,
is intentional on the part of Law
son.
Even though he recognizes Wash
ington's record at bat, Lawson can't
understand how he's up there so
high when a curve-ball pitcher is
'way over his head. According to
Lawson, Glenn Hamilton was so far
ahead of Washington in Los Angeles
as long as he kept throwing curves
that it wasn't even funny.
Besides that, Lawson claims the
Negro doesn't cover enough terri
tory. He says he refuses to try for
balls that are a little out of range.
There's much to be said for both
sides of the Washington question, is
the general attitude. Lawson takes
one of 'em.
