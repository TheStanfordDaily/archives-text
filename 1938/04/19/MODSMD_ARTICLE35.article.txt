# Cards Grind In Big Meet Preparation
## Burrows Beats Own 440 Mark; Zagar Heaves Discus 158 ft. 
### 
Working hard in preparation for
Saturday's crucial meet with Cali
fornia, the Indian cinderpathmen are
gearing themselves daily for their
big effort of the season.
Captain Ray Malott spent the
week-end shaking off the effects of
a sore throat. Ray took it easy in
a quarter-mile trial yesterday and
romped to the tape in 49.3, beating
Carl Mahurin by two yards.
Edson Burrows broke another
record yesterday when he ran the
440 in 51.3 to set a new personal
mark. Last year Ed couldn't break
54 in the quarter.
Rusty March, who has returned
to his first love, the 880, turned in a
1:57 .4 performance. March had been
running the mile up to last week's
Olympic Club meet.
The big news of yesterday's work
out, however, was Pete Zagar. Petie
was so engrossed in showing a couple
of freshmen how to toss the discus
that he completely forgot about his
slump and heaved the platter out
158 feet.
Stanford's possibilities for a clean
sweep in this event Saturday look
blight, with Hugh Gribbin throwing
in the 150's and Ted Hucklebridge
improving steadily. Hucklebridge's
152 feet for third last Saturday was
by several feet his best mark of the
season.
Ray Dean, ex-Farm sprinter who
now runs for the Olympic Club,
handed Stan Hiserman and Ray
Malott a decisive defeat in a prac
tice sprint yesterday. Dean won by
three yards in 10.1.
Paul Ganahl marke'd up a 10:05
two-mile effort over Johnny Ema-
