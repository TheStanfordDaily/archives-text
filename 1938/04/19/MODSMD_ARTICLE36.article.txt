# Yankees Open Without Di Mag
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 (UP).
â€”Joe DiMaggio, erstwhile slugging
outfielder of the New York Yankees,
loafed at home today while his team
mates were opening the season in
Boston with the Red Sox.
Annoyed at being reminded that
Colonel Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees'
owner, was waiting for him to sign
a $25,000 contract, Joe reiterated his
oft-announced statement:
"Forty thousand or I'll stay home."
Under league rules, he will be
automatically suspended for 10 days
at midnight tonight unless he signs,
and if there is no agreement within
the 10 days, he could be reinstated
only by order of Commissioner K. M.
Landis or American League Presi
dent William Harridge.
