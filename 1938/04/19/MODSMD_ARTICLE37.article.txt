# YANKEES DEFEATED IN OPENING GAME
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 18 (UP).—The
world champion New York Yankees
are a superstitious ball club—they
won't walk under a ladder, light
three on a match, or cross the path
of a black cat. Maybe that's why
they lost the opening game of* the
1938 American League season tb
the Red Sox today at Boston, 8-4.
They lost the opening game in
1936 and went on to win the Ameri
can League pennant and the world
title. They did the same thing last
year. Now that they've lost their
opening day game, they can settle
down for the next 153 games and
prove their right to rule the base
ball world.
