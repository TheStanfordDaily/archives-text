With a (lock of liis best men still out for spring sports and several
more prospects bruised and limping from early scrimmages. Coach Tiny
Thornhill yesterday started the third week of spring football in easy
fashion.
Varsity and freshman baseball ends this week-end, but a few of Tiny's
outstanding veteran.. including Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen, w ill be

heaving weights for Dink Temple- <
ton for some time to come. Thorn
hill is cutting down on the injection
of new plays and styles so that the
absentees won't miss out on too
much ground work.
Shining Lights
The few scrimmages thus far have
brought out several shining lights
who may keep their posts even after
the regulars come back to work.
Howard Higginbotham has surprised
everyone including himself with
his work at left end. Bill Willard,
the regular last fall, is nursing a
lame leg and Jack Clark still hasn't
started practice, but "Handsome
Harry" is fast and big and catches
passes with uncanny regularity.
The prospects of anyone remov
ing Dick Sutton and Bob Dakan
from the guard posts is remote at
present. Although the weather is
anything but conducive to tough line
play, Dakan and Sutton seem to
dote on scrimmage.
Scrimmage Friday
By West and Corky Donahue also
are acting like old residents at tackle
and will open next fall with a de
cided edge in condition over Zagar
and Andersen.
Thornhill intimated yesterday that
he would wait until Friday before
dishing up another scrimmage, al
though he might call for contact
work before that time.
Willard, Bill Paulman, Hamp
Pool, and Freddie Ledeboer are the
more prominent cripples whom Tiny
plans to keep out of action until
Friday.
