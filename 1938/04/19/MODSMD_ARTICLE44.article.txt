# Arizona Poloists Beat Cards, 6-4
## 
### 
An aggressive University of Ari
zona polo squad rode the Cards to
a hard-fought 6-4 victory in the first
of a two-game series to be played
here on the highway polo field. The
sudden heat particularly affected the
Indians, but they showed well
against the top-notch Wildcat team,
last year's Pacific coast champions.
High man for the game was Gay
nor Hathaway, riding at No. 2 for
the southern squad, with 3 goals, and
Steve Downey for the Cards with 2
markers. The loss of Downey for
three chukkers was fell heavily by
the Farm four. Captain Bob Fuller
ton and Bert McClintock brought in
the other two points for the Indians,
while Charlie Mosse garnered two
more goals and Bowd Branson one
for the Wildcats.
The last match of the series will be
played tomorrow afternoon at 3,
o'clock on the highway field.
