# Peace to Excom
## 
### 
AN idea crawled out of the melee of peace
movements yesterday. At the start it was
not impressively big—just a suggestion that
Stanford offer a course in peace and the factors
that influence it. But the idea has grown like
a Phi Bete's Bawlout average. Today it is a
good deal more than a feebly innocent by
stander caught in the street-fight of peace phi
losophies.
And tonight Ex Committee will meet. This
is not a phenomenon that will of itself do much
to advance the cause of peace. But it will pro
vide an opportunity for starting the proposed
peace course on a Stanford career.
Ex Committee can arrange for a group of
students to investigate the possibility of estab
lishing such a course. And if the report is
favorable, it can ask the administration to give
us the course.
A.S.S.U. President Tom Killefer has suggested
that the Student-Faculty Relations Committee
handle the study, and the suggestion sounds
like a superior bit of executive forethought. The
proposed course falls into the committee's field.
Organization of a new course is as much a sub
ject of student-faculty relations as are bull
sessions in the Nitery or cookies and small talk
in a professor's living room.
If Ex Committee would delegate investiga
tion of the proposed course to the Student-Fac
ulty Relations Committee, we could keep the
idea alive and lusty instead of letting it die
quietly in a forgotten corner. Eventually we
should be able to design a practical course that
would meet the demand for information about
peace and war.
Three faculty members have declared in favor
of the course. Two others have said that it was
worth investigation. Students and professors
could co-operate in working out the material
and organization.
And so when Ex Committee drapes itself
around the table tonight, it will have a chance
to do something about peace without leaving
its sensitive chin open to a swing from either
the administration or the A.S.U.
We don't suggest decorating the room with
olive branches. But we hope that Ex Committee
has a pleasant day and a good dinner, and feels
very peaceful tonight.—J. C.
