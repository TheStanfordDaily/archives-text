# Hitched to a Star Wagon

WE are rubbing our eyes.
When Stagers came forth, recently, with
their offer of a S5OO scholarship for a student
in the Division of Speech and Drama, we were
pleasantly surprised. This, we said, is almost
enough to constitute a trend. We fondly con
sidered the benefits which would be derived
for Stanford dramatics, with potential McClin
tocks and Bernhardts proselyted for the good
of art.
That was enough to make us rub our eyes.
But when the alumni announced that the profits

they made from "Star Wagon"—s7oo—were
turned over to the Division with no strings at
tached, we really had to sit up. From an early
age we had been taught that the alumni were
the boogy-boogy men about a university. We
understood that their financial overtures to their
alma mater were made with the ulterior motive
of running her business.
Our early suspicions had been somewhat
allayed by the do-what-you-want-with-it contri
butions raised by the Stanford Associates, and
by the increasing number of donations which
have been coming in from alumni with the
same detached spirit of aid.
But the alumni association's last offering
makes us believe in fairy godmothers. Seven
hundred dollars laid in the Division's lap with
nothing but a recommendation that it be used
for a scholarship.
The Division has not yet decided how to
spend their out-of-season Christmas gift, but
the scholarship idea will almost undoubtedly
be followed. Money left over probably will go
into the tiny production fund which the Uni
versity has established for them.
At any rate, the Division won't have too
tough a time figuring out what to do with their
gift. With this and the Stagers' scholarship, re
cruiting for the back-stage hands will be a much
easier job. And with the left-over money, the
red wolf will be backed farther from the door
of unsuccessful productions. Everything is
lovely.
But we are still rubbing our eyes.—J. S.
