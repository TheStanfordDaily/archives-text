FIELD DAY
FRIDAY afternoon Axe Society will hold what
it hopes will be the first in a new series of student
faculty lield days, a revival of a tradition which harks
back to the early days of the University, and a new
and constructive step toward the Utopia all such move
ments are headed for.
Braving the jinx which seems to dog most efforts
in that direction, the Society has taken over the new
intramural field for the afternoon, has planned a bar
becue, games ranging from ping-pong to a three-legged
race, and a general get-together which should do
much to solve what is admittedly one of the Farm's
most pressing problems.
The Society probably realizes what it is up against.
It probably knows full well that Stanford is possessed
of a vast and deadly inertia which hamstrings almost
everything of a constructive nature, however good it
may be It probably realizes that it is behind the
eight-ball of a tradition which has slaughtered many
fine ideas.
But it has hopes. It hopes its field day will be
supported by the student-body. It hopes that out of
4000 students there may be enough interested in a
good time.to turn out. It hopes its revival of a val
uable Farm tradition will be sufficiently popular to
make it something more than just another idealistic
flash in the pan.
And for Axe Society's sake, and the sake of stu
dent-faculty friendship, one hopes with it that it will
succeed in its plan. Few proposals have been as in
teresting, few have possessed so many attractive fea
tures.
Both as good time and as rebirth of an excellent
custom, the Society's idea will be well worth Stan
ford's time. Not only will it tend to bring faculty and
students closer together, it will do it in one of the
most enjoyable ways open to a university. It will have
all the best aspects of the student-faculty bull-session,
which at the moment is lying dormant, and it will
give them the added fillip of friendly competition, al
ways a good way to create good feeling.
To Axe Society, then, congratulations on a good
idea; and best wishes for the welfare of something
which, if successful, will mark the beginning of a new
era in Farm history.

Both as good time and as rebirth of an excellent
custom, the Society's idea will be well worth Stan
ford's time. Not only will it tend to bring faculty and
students closer together, it will do it in one of the
most enjoyable ways open to a university. It will have
all the best aspects of the student-faculty bull-session,
which at the moment is lying dormant, and it will
give them the added fillip of friendly competition, al
ways a good way to create good feeling.
To Axe Society, then, congratulations on a good
idea; and best wishes for the welfare of something
which, if successful, will mark the beginning of a new
era in Farm history.
