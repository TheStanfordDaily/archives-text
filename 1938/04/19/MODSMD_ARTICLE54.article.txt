I OOKING for some place to have a light supper
which would fit in with our spring fancy, we sud
denly realized, after traveling several miles, that there
weren't any—good ones, that is. Of course there arc
plenty of places to eat, but not many that have any
thing special about them this side of San Francisco.
About our favorite, when you are feeling in the
mood for it, is Woods' little shack north of Redwood
City. You can get wonderful pancakes there —if you
like pancakes. But in this kind of weather, no.
Then L'Omelette is an old stand-by. But we some
how associate that with late hours, and not a light
evening meal. However, you can do a lot worse. Fox
Shoppe is about in the same class, but it's usually
too crowded to get in. Dinah's is too expensive for
what you get, in our opinion, though it has its points
when you are looking for a chicken dinner. Also
there's Cafe de Paris, but we've never been there.
We've heard good comments, though.
From here, you have to take a big drop in quality
unless you want to end up in Paly. There you can
choose between Wilson's and Motley's, or just sit on a
stool in a creamery.
Understand, we're not out looking for a good meal,
but just a snack—cold plates and fresh salads and iced
drinks. And we find ourselves somewhat frustrated.
Perhaps we've missed some of the places which might
suit our rather particular tastes, but we don't think
so.
If we have, we are open to suggestions.

BRIEF word will suffice to mention the latest
Stanford success story. It concerns Tro Harper,
who will be remembered as the campus ace photog
rapher last year. Sunday, his fine picture of the in
side of the Chapel was printed, half-page size, in the
Chronicle Rotogravure section.
But we bring up his name—printed "Troll" by the
Chron on Sunday- for his rapid rise in radio. After
starting on an early morning record and news pro
gram for KSFO, he has been working an afternoon
jam session, with enough finesse to merit comments
by Herb Caen, and the News radio columnist. His
program of records is given a good deal of originality
by his own comments and line-up of records. With a
good radio personality, it looks like tin- lad is doing

there's Cafe de Paris, but we've never been there.
We've heard good comments, though.
From here, you have to take a big drop in quality
unless you want to end up in Paly. There you can
choose between Wilson's and Motley's, or just sit on a
stool in a creamery.
Understand, we're not out looking for a good meal,
but just a snack—cold plates and fresh salads and iced
drinks. And we find ourselves somewhat frustrated.
Perhaps we've missed some of the places which might
suit our rather particular tastes, but we don't think
so.
If we have, we are open to suggestions.

BRIEF word will suffice to mention the latest
Stanford success story. It concerns Tro Harper,
who will be remembered as the campus ace photog
rapher last year. Sunday, his fine picture of the in
side of the Chapel was printed, half-page size, in the
Chronicle Rotogravure section.
But we bring up his name—printed "Troll" by the
Chron on Sunday- for his rapid rise in radio. After
starting on an early morning record and news pro
gram for KSFO, he has been working an afternoon
jam session, with enough finesse to merit comments
by Herb Caen, and the News radio columnist. His
program of records is given a good deal of originality
by his own comments and line-up of records. With a
good radio personality, it looks like tin- lad is doing
all rieht..- Stone,
I OOKING for some place to have a light supper
which would fit in with our spring fancy, we sud
denly realized, after traveling several miles, that there
weren't any—good ones, that is. Of course there arc
plenty of places to eat, but not many that have any
thing special about them this side of San Francisco.
About our favorite, when you are feeling in the
mood for it, is Woods' little shack north of Redwood
City. You can get wonderful pancakes there —if you
like pancakes. But in this kind of weather, no.
Then L'Omelette is an old stand-by. But we some
how associate that with late hours, and not a light
evening meal. However, you can do a lot worse. Fox
Shoppe is about in the same class, but it's usually
too crowded to get in. Dinah's is too expensive for
what you get, in our opinion, though it has its points
when you are looking for a chicken dinner. Also
there's Cafe de Paris, but we've never been there.
