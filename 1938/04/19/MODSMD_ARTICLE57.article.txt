### 
"Jezebel," wjth Bette Davis, Henry
Fonda, and George Brent, with its
negroes, mint juleps, and yellow
fever, comes to the Stanford Theater
Sunday.
Not worth four stars or even
three, quite, pre - civil war New

Orleans "Jezebel"
has three things in
its favor: (a) Bette
Davis as Julie, (b)
George Brent do
ing nothing and
doing it very com
petently as Buck
Cantrell, rich, pis
tol-dueling aristo
crat who can loaf
more thoroughly
and drink more
mint juleps than
a Stanford senior
who knows he's

going to flunk anyway.
(c) The photography and cutting
in the street scenes during the yel
low fever epidemic. But this well
cut, pictorial photography is cut no
better, is no more pictorial than
scenes that you find in a score of
pictures a year.
Bette Davis, who has the luck to
be cast in good pictures and the
ability to make them popular pic
tures, has made just a popular pic
ture thus time. She did her best with
the picture, and she will make some
audiences think they have scene a
great picture in '"Jezebel." They
haven't.
The picture isn't good because the
story isn't good. It's pretty poor.
Even Warner Brothers thought so
until "Gone with the Wind" came
out. They realized, then, that the
public wanted Southern stufT about
a frisky woman and plantations and
negroes, and took "Jezebel" off their
shelves, where it had rested for a
year and a half, dressed it up with
a cast that was over the head of the
story, and graciously gave it to the
public.'
