# Convalescents Hunt Eggs Chi O's Play Bunny for Tots
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Four-hundred and twelve eggs,
40 boys, and 40 girls participated in
an Easter egg hunt Sunday at the
Convalescent Home.
All 80 of the kids ran around the
Convalescent Home lawn for about
an hour looking all over for colored
eggs to put in their big Easter bon
nets. All 80 of them found the hunt
an easy way to help get back their
strength and to get well again.
The Chi O's had donated and hid
den the eggs for them. They put on
their Easter Parade clothes and hid
the eggs around the Home at about
9 o'clock.
Bonnets for Baskest
Some of the kids were so small
that their bonnets, as they carried
them in their hands, dragged along
the ground. The oldest was no
more than 12.
Dick Dudman, Daily staff pho
tographer, was there taking pictures
of them. Some of them would pose
willingly and would come back to
pose again, and then would run
around telling the other kids, "He
took me twice!"
Others didn't like to have their
pictures taken, and wouldn't turn
their faces to the camera. We would
go over to them and try to get a
picture when they weren't noticing
the camera.
Eggs Counted
"How many eggs do you have?"
we would ask.
"Five," they would answer tim
idly.
"And a little chick, too." The Chi
O's, who were watching them and
sometimes helping them find eggs,
gave them all little yellow chickens
from time to time.
"What's your name?"
"Betty." At about that time
Dudman would take his picture, and
we would ask, "Did you know your
picture was taken."
"Yes," Betty or Ethel or Mary
would answer, and stare shyjy at
the eggs in their bonnets.
Undernourished hut Happy
Some of the kids were small and
undernourished - looking, but they
were all happy and having a good
time. Many of them had never been
on Easter egg hunts before. Some
of them thought they had, but they
couldn't remember for sure. "But
we'll remember this one," they said.
After they had been out in the hot
sun for about an hour and had
found all of the eggs, the kids were
sent back to bed again by Mrs. Ruth
At wood, head of the Convalescent
Home.
Their beds were outdoors in the
shade. They sat in them picking off
the "Made in Japan" stickers which
were on the little chickens. Some of
them had picked the tags off as soon
as they noticed them, even while
they were still hunting.
They were waiting for dinner.

waiting for the chicken dinner that
had been promised them by the Aux
iliary Board. Dudman wanted to
get some pictures of them in their
beds, so we went over to the boys'
section.
We had just gone up the steps to
the porch where their beds were
when he realized he was going to
have trouble. About 30 of the boys
were there, and immediately most
of them began yelling, "Take my
picture first." And then, "Are we
going to be in the movies?"
He had to start at one end of the
porch and take or pretend to take
pictures of all of them. At one time
he wrote something on a piece of
paper, and that started them yelling,
"You didn't take down my name.
You don't know my name." They
kept it up the whole time. We did
n't go to the girls' section to take
pictures.
None of the kids, either during or
after the hunt, would say whether
they believed the Easter Bunny had
hidden the eggs they found.
