# NEWS IN REVIEW From United Press

### BILL MILLIS 
Vjf/HAT is the foreign policy of the
United States? According to a
law enacted by Congress but left
unenforced in the Orient, it is one
of neutrality. According to a dec
laration of President Roosevelt last
October, it should become one of
"quarantining aggressor nations."
Yesterday there were indications
that this foreign policy is in the
process of changing. Evidence was
a formal statement delivered by the
President at the end of a press con
ference, in which he placed his ap
proval upon the recently-signed
Anglo-Italian pact—a "deal" which
may soon become a four-power pact
also involving France and Ger
many.
"This government has seen in
the conclusion of an agreement a
sympathetic interest because it is
proof of the value of peaceful ne
gotiations," the President said.
He emphasized, however, that
he confined his approval to friend
ly means of economic "appease
ment" and was not attempting to
pass on anything in the treaty
which might be in the nature of a
political rapprochment,

Despite hopeful tub thumping of
late about "increasing Congressional
independence" and "mounting revolt
against the executive," the Adminis
tration yesterday secured approval
for two details of its recovery-relief
program, with the House adding
$101,000,000 for highway construc
tion to the agricultural appropria
tion bill and the Senate adding $51,-
000.000 to the Civilian Conservation
Corps bill.
Once Congress appropriates the
funds, there will be no delay in
starting operation of the $4,512,-
000,000 anti-depression program,
the President said last night.
Early negotiation of a truce be
tween the government and the

In San Francisco, Raymond Moley,
soured former braintruster-in-chief,
sharply criticized the pump-priming
program, and said that "fear of
President Roosevelt will lessen as
his popularity lessens."
Of the recovery program, he said:
"It is a very questionable piece of
artificial stimulation, and like the
taking of narcotics, it will be in
jurious in the long run."
