# Stagers To Cast More Tryoutees
## 
### 
Stagers are once more calling for
all new campus talent to tryout for
a new production, this time to be
three one-act readings to be pre
sented Friday, April 29. Tryouts
are tomorrow from 2 to 6 o'clock
in the Little Theater.
New tryoutees will have an un
usually good opportunity to win
spots in the cast of one or more of
readings owing to the fact that many
of the regular Farm players arc al
ready cast and rehearsing for the
coming Spring Show, "Is Europe?"
and for "Johnny Johnson." However,
players having minor roles in the
two latter productions are also urged
to tryout. Men, especially, are need
ed for the readings.
The readings chosen are: Maxwell
Anderson's "Second Overture," a
tragedy; Eugene O'Neill's "Where
the Cross Is Made", a powerful melo
drama; and A. A. Milne's comedy,
"Miss Marlowe at Play."
