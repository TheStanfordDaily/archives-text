"It's a good idea."
This was the way seven campus
leaders yesterday endorsed the new
ly proposed course in the the causes
of war and the methods of avoiding
it.
When asked by The Daily their
opinion as to the practicality of a
peace-war survey course, six prom
inent Cards gave their unqualified
approval, one raised difficulties.
A.S.S.U. President Tom Kilefer
stated:
'"Th.sis one of the best proposals
for a new course that I've heard of
in a long time. Personally I think
it could be handled adequately
through the Student-Faculty rela
tions committee of the A.S.S.U.. I'm
convinced that it's an excellent idea."
Barbara Murphy, vice-presidnt of
the student body continued:
"This course is something that
Stanford needs. However, its suc
cess depends on who gives it. It's
something that can't be niched into

without a great deal of thought and
work."
Gerald Marcus, varsity debater,
organizer of the proposed Stanford
Political Union, and chairman of
Peace Day stated:
"It's an excellent idea, and a cer- '
tain way to insure an interest in j
peace durng the entire year."
Putzie Hinrichs, president of Union I
unit and chairman of the A.S.S.U.
Student Faculty Relations Commit
tee raised a note of doubt in her re
ply to The Daily questioners when !
she said:
"I think it's a good idea, but I'm
afraid it's too idealistic. The ques
tion offers too large a scope for one j
course. Then, too, I think it should
be a study for student faculty dis
cussion. not one given by the Uni
: versity for units."
Averring that she, too. thought it
a "good idea," Jean Hemphill, prcsi
i dent of Cap and Gown, former ch.iir
| man of Women's Council, and form- I
' er president of Women's Conference '

added:
"War upsets the whole world and
this study would undoubtedly bring
about a better understanding of the
present world situation and the
means to end strife."
Chairman of Cardinals and A.S.U.
head, Mark Hopkins emphasized the
peace issue by remarking, "There is
a definite need for a permanent
peace program at Stanford. This
course would be an integral part of
such a program."
Jackie Brown, outgoing president
of Y.W.C.A.. continued this theme
by adding, "Peace is a vital thing
that affects every person. A course in
its study would be extremely useful,
of real practical value to the student
body."
Interviewed by Daily reporters,
Professors Buck, Savellc, Hilgard
and Robinson were divided in partial
and strong recommendation of the
proposal that Stanford offer its stu
dents a course in the factors in

Chairman of Cardinals and A.S.U.
head, Mark Hopkins emphasized the
peace issue by remarking, "There is
a definite need for a permanent
peace program at Stanford. This
course would be an integral part of
such a program."
Jackie Brown, outgoing president
of Y.W.C.A.. continued this theme
by adding, "Peace is a vital thing
that affects every person. A course in
its study would be extremely useful,
of real practical value to the student
body."
Interviewed by Daily reporters,
Professors Buck, Savellc, Hilgard
and Robinson were divided in partial
and strong recommendation of the
proposal that Stanford offer its stu
dents a course in the factors in
v"!vpH in thp v'sv-jvftrr i^sue
"It's a good idea."
This was the way seven campus
leaders yesterday endorsed the new
ly proposed course in the the causes
of war and the methods of avoiding
it.
When asked by The Daily their
opinion as to the practicality of a
peace-war survey course, six prom
inent Cards gave their unqualified
approval, one raised difficulties.
A.S.S.U. President Tom Kilefer
stated:
'"Th.sis one of the best proposals
for a new course that I've heard of
in a long time. Personally I think
it could be handled adequately
through the Student-Faculty rela
tions committee of the A.S.S.U.. I'm
convinced that it's an excellent idea."
Barbara Murphy, vice-presidnt of
the student body continued:
"This course is something that
Stanford needs. However, its suc
cess depends on who gives it. It's
something that can't be niched into

without a great deal of thought and
work."
Gerald Marcus, varsity debater,
organizer of the proposed Stanford
Political Union, and chairman of
Peace Day stated:
"It's an excellent idea, and a cer- '
tain way to insure an interest in j
peace durng the entire year."
Putzie Hinrichs, president of Union I
unit and chairman of the A.S.S.U.
Student Faculty Relations Commit
tee raised a note of doubt in her re
ply to The Daily questioners when !
she said:
"I think it's a good idea, but I'm
afraid it's too idealistic. The ques
tion offers too large a scope for one j
course. Then, too, I think it should
be a study for student faculty dis
cussion. not one given by the Uni
: versity for units."
Averring that she, too. thought it
a "good idea," Jean Hemphill, prcsi
i dent of Cap and Gown, former ch.iir
| man of Women's Council, and form- I
' er president of Women's Conference '

added:
"War upsets the whole world and
this study would undoubtedly bring
about a better understanding of the
present world situation and the
means to end strife."
