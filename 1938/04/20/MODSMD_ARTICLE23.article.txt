# Living Groups Nearly Lose Pay Phone
## Brainier Club Causes Current Bill Deficit 
### 
Because they have continued their
old habit of being coy about paying
up their phone bills, Farm men near
ly lost their pay phones Saturday
when the telephone company made
its strongest threat to take them out.
Representatives from the telephone
company came to the campus Satur
day to take all pay-phones out,
stopped to tell Assistant Comptroller
Ernest Erwin about their action.
Erwin temporarily saved the phones
by promising that the current tele
phone deficit would be paid up.
Offended this time was Branner
Club, which owed the company $19
from bills run up by some of its
members. The club will pay the de
ficit.
This trouble with the telephone
company is not just a recent thing.
On and off during the past it has
had trouble with Farm men and
Farm phones.
Trickiest way Stanford men have
gotten out of paying the toll has
been substituting frozen ice coins
lor nickles, while more conventional
has been their use of slugs. Most
exasperating trick to the telephone
company has been the men's habit
of walking away without paying
over-time long-distance calls.
The telephone company has had
trouble with other colleges, too, and
has recently taken all of the out
phones out of Saint Mary's college,
according to Chuck Fontius, Stu
dent Manager.
