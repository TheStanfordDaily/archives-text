# $500 Drama Scholarship Given Okay
## Excom Says Stagers Must Pay Own $25 Administration Cost 
### 
Stagers can have their $500
scholarship, but they must pay the
cost of administering the fund them
selves, Ex Committee decided last
night.
Held over from last week, the
scholarship was okaved by com
mitteemen after they heard the re
port of Harry Horton, who had been
delegated to study the proposal.
Bud Cady, "president of Stagers,
told the commttee that the $25 ne
cessary for administering the schol
arship should be paid by Dramatics
Council, which is directly under the
A.S.S.U.
Shock Fund
"The first reading I gave last
quarter lost two dollars and a
halt," Cady said, "and one of them
lost $14. We have to have some re
serve."
Student Manager Chuck Fontius'
chief objection was that one of the
objects of this scholarship "is, I
happen to know, to give Stagers a
lot of national publicity." He sug
gested that the fund be named for
Dramatic Council if that body is
to pay the expenses.
Name Colorful
To this Clay McDaniel replied
that the word "Stagers" sounds more
colorful in publicity than "Dramatic
Council."
Frosh Debaters
With the scholarship safely ap
proved. Ex Committee turned its
attention to frosh debaters, who
had a story about their experiences
on their recent trip to Stockton.
Sherm Mellinkoff explained that
a meager fund allotment left the six
debaters only $16 to live for three
days in Stockton. They took one of
the cheaper hotels, he said.
"We're only frosh and we don't
know about the money end of it,"
he said, "but we think something
ought to lie done to avoid a situa
tion next year.
Fontius explained that it was a
problem for De bate Council to
handle. Increased activity of frosh
debaters this year possibly has made
necessary an increase in thier pro
portion of the total allotment for
debating, he said.
Other business included the fol
lowing items;
CONCERT SERIES: Virginia
Smith's suggestion of 1938-39 officers
was acceptedâ€”Delphine Joy for
manager, Virginia Scott and Carl
Hansen for assistants.
INITIATIVE AMENDMENT: Ex
Committee voted unanimously to
submit to the student body a con
stitutional amendment allowing in
itiative machinery to apply to by
laws instead of only to amendments.
No date was set for the special elec
tion that will be necessary, and the
motion was made subject to Dr.
Wilbur's approval.
WAR-PEACE COURSE: Thought a
good idea, the matter was referred
to the committee considered ad
ministration the chief problem in
setting up such a course.
FUND DRIVES: "What ever hap
pened to our regulation of fund
drives?" asked Martha Jane Knecht.
"Junior women are being forced to
contribute to a scholarship, and Ex
Committee never approved the
drive."
Quickly replied Sis Coonley: "It's
not a drive. No one has to contribute.
It's only voluntary.
Barbara Murphy pointed out that
no drive is necessarily compulsory.
Action was delayed until members
find in the minutes book just what
happened to their elaborate regula
tory machinery, set up when people
protested to Axe Society's Buck-of
the Month Club drive last quarter.
