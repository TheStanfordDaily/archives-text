# Sellards Shows Prof's Can Still Be Versatile
## 
### HARRY SHELDON AND HARRY PRESS 
Despite the fictional idea of the
! college French professor, Dr. John
Armstrong Sellards has gone far
to show that it's the exception that
I proves the rule.
I Member of the French Legion of
| Honor . . . personal assist ant to
| Secretary of Commerce Herbert
I Hoover ... an executive officer in
; t he American Relief Administration
| in Russia and Austria ... a lieu
| tenant in the intelligence Service of
i the United States Navy . . . and, at
| all times, a scholar and educator.
Stresses Scholarship
Of these, Dr. Sellards seemingly
| values the last most of all.
During an interrupted career of
1 22 years at Stanford, which he will
terminate next fall when he goes to
| the University of Washington as
professor of Romanic languages, Dr.
I Sellards has been director of sum
| mer quarter for 10 years as well as
[associate professor in French and
! European literature.
Culmination of a long visualiza
j tion of living centers for foreign
j language students is Stanford's
â– French House for women, which he
j promoted in fall quarter of 1936.
"It is my belief," he said, yester
j day, "that the time is coming when
i American universities will maintain !
' dormitories, in each wing of which |
students of the various foreign lan- I
jguages will live/ An ideal living]
i hall would be smaller in physical '
plant than Toyon Hal.
Founds French House
This is similar, he explained, to the
: plan now in effect at Columbia
University. There, in addition to such
dormitories, during the summer the
university arranges tours to coun
tries in whose languages students are
interested.
Stanford's French House, acord
ing to Dr. Sellards, was so success- i
ful last year that the administration
has increased its size so that it now
accomodates 16 women and a direc
tress.
French is spoken entirely in sit
ting-room gatherings, and when the
women are studying French. Only
requisite for entrance is the desire
to "think" French, as well as pro
ficiency in reading and speaking.
Study Useful
In response to student criticisms
of foreign language requirements,
Dr. Sellards says, "At some time,
this study will be of definite use
even though it appears to be drudg

ery at present and even though it
takes a long time for this use to ap
pear."
After receiving his A. B. at the
University of Illinois, Dr. Sellards
took his master's degree at Stan
ford in 1916.
At the outbreak of the War he en
listed in the United States Navy.
He is no relation to the present Ad
miral Sellers. During this time, he
was on the staff of Admiral Henry
B. Wilson.
Studies Abroad
In 1919, he received a fellowship
and studied at the Universities of
Brussels and Ghent, following which
he joined the American Relief Ad
ministration in Russia and Austria
under General William Haskell.
Dr. Sellards in 1921 again was at
Stanford for a year as instructor.
Next interruption in his Stanford
career was the acceptance of a post
as personal assistant to Ex-Presi
dent Herbert Hoover when the latter
was secretary of commerce.
Back to Farm
Recalled to Stanford in 1925, Dr.
Sellards became the first one-man
director of summer quarter. Previ
ously, a group of professors had
handled the task.
His doctorate was taken at the
University of Paris in 1933.
Then, following a year at U.C.L.A.,
he returned to Stanford once again,
this time as an associate professor
of Romanic languages and director
of summer quarter.
Dr. Sellards emphasized that he
will remain at Stanford until next
fall, and will, not take up his duties
as a full professor at the northern
university until summer quarter is
completed. In the fall of 1939, he will
become head of Washington's ro
manic language department.
