Forty frosh in their under
wear, brandishing buckets of
water, yesterday caused many
members of the Stanford
Mothers' Club to make a de
tour as they drove to Toyon
Hall for their last meeting this
year.
Standing on either side of the
road at the east end of Encina,
the frosh and some eatng club
members were throwing buck
ets-full of water at passing
cars. They took particularly
careful aim each time an open
car came past.
