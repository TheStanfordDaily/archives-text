# Soph Carnival To Get Fishy S.A.E. Booth
## 
### 
Horatius Odyssius Aeneas Xerxes
was won last year at the Sophomore
! Carnival and this year he's going
back.
Horatius is a pet goldfish, and his
friends call him "Hoax" for short.
His owner, Doris Wiseman, A.0.P.,
caught him at last year's carnival in
the S.A.E. goldfish booth.
This year she expects to acquire a
I companion for Hoax, as the S.A.E.'s
are continuing their concession at
the carnival to be held Friday night
! at 7 o'clock in the Pavilion.
A number of goldfish will be
turned loose in tubs, and .customers
J will be allowed to angle ofr them
with paper netsâ€”all for the sake of
charity and the Convalescent Home
Drive.
At the Delt's carnival concession,
customers will toss rocks at bottles
| guaranteeing a sure cure for inhibi
' tions. The Thetas are going to spon
sor nail driving, and the A.O. Pis
! will run a snappy dog racing booth.
Pitching pennies at saucers will be
the Theta Delts contribution to the
evennig's festivities. The old trick
of sitting on a barrel, trying to light
a cigarette and keeping your bal
ance at the same time will attract El
j Cuadro's customers.
