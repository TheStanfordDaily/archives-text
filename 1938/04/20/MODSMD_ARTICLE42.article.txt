Stanford's varsity golfer, indicated that tliev are all set to take on Cali
fornia in the first Big Match. Friday, as they tapered off this week's prac
tice with a decisive 13-5 victory over Oklahoma University's touring
divot-digging squad yesterday on the Stanford course.
Dropping only one singles match while winning the other three and
sweeping both doubles matches, the Cards brought their practice sessions

to u successful climax in their
competitive tune-up before the Cal
meet.
Berkeley Bound
Friday, Coach Eddie Twigs takes
his varsity and freshman squads
over to Berkeley to meet the Bears
in the first of the two annual Big
Matches. A week from Friday, Cal
plays on the Stanford course in the
return match.
The Big Match this year will de
cide the P.C.C. dual meet champion
ship. Stanford and California have
both gone through their dual meet
seasons undefeated, both having
downed U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. twice.
The Indians extended their winning
streak to five straight by downing
the Sooners yesterday.
Toss-up
Stanford's chances of sending a
six-man squad back East for the
National Intercollegiate singles and
team championships will depend
largely on its showing against Cal.
On the basis of past performances
this season, the Big Match rates as
« toss-up.
Both teams have beaten U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. twice, but in every
match Stanford's margin of victory
has been greater than California's.
Against the same Oklahoma squad,
however, the Bears won, 14-5, while
the Cards won, 13-5.
In the words of Coach Bruce
Drake of Oklahoma, "Stanford has
the greatest team that our Sooner
squad has met on this tour and
should make a strong showing if it's
sent East for the National Intercol
legiates."

Art Doering, Brown Cannon and
Bill Boyd all went around in 73's,
two over par, while Jack Wallace

of Ihe season with a broken wrist, by
going out in a blazing 33 and loafing
