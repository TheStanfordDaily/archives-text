# Papoose Nine Win 8-5 Game
## Santa Clara Loses On Local Diamond 
### 
j Chalking up 10 hits and 8 runs
in the seventh and eighth innings,
the Papooses, behind the capable
five-hit pitching of Bill Masters,
crushed the Santa Clara High nine
12-5.
Hero of the day was Marty Bains,
' in at second for Pfyl in the sixth
inning, who lifted an offering of
Pitcher Bellerino over the left field
lence for a homer with two men on
| base. Bains' four-bagger came
when the Cards were leading 4-3 in
. the seventh and put the win on ice
j for the fro.sh.
Game on Ice
Two pitchers went the rounds for
; the visitors, with eight strikeouts
| and five walks chalked up for
I them. The high school team made
! a strong bid in the third inning
when they capitalized on one hit,
i two walks, and an error to bring
1 three runs across the plate, but the N
i Farm nine pulled even in the next
inning and were never headed af
j terwards.
With the game safely tucked be
' neath their belts, the frosh went
out in the eighth to add four more
.tallies. With one out, Thompson
| bounced one over the fence to score
| Pfyl and Peterson. Ditlevson, who
j played heads-up ball at short, sin
; gled to bring in "Cootie" and Catch
j c-r Fay repeated to score Dit.
Masters Looks Good
Masters' victory was strengthen
j ed by the fact that the Santa Cruz
| boys had recently tallied a win over
i Santa Clara's frosh by the wide
margin of 8-2. Paul Fay, his bat
tery mate, was impressive with his
work behind the plate and gave
strong evidence that he will be
right in the running for a starting
berth against Cal this Friday.
Today, with their season's exit
â–  against Cal scheduled at Berkeley
this Friday, the Papooses will work
out with the intention of upsetting
the strong Bear frosh outfit.
