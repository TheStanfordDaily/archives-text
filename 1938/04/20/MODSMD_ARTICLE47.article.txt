Dick Bancroft, slugging Kappa
Alpha third baseman, played the
feature role in yesterday's Intra
mural program when he pounded
out three homers and a double in
five trips to the plate as the K.A.'s
defeated El Cuadro, 12-7.
All of today's battles figure to be
sizzlers with the Phi Psi-D.U. game
in the spotlight. Both teams are
undefeated to date. Encina 4W,
strongest freshman outfit in the
school, tangles with Theta Chi in
what should be a slugging duel.
Sigma Chi's undefeated outfit fig
ures to barrel over Alpha Sig.
The Intramural tennis tourna
ment is progressing rapidly with
second-round results due the first
of next week.
