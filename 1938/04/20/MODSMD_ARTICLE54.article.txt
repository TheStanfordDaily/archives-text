# Card Swimmers Favored Over Cal
## 
### 
Although t+ie Stanford swimming
team suffered a one-point defeat by
U.S.C. last Friday in Los Angeles,
the Indians will be better than an
even choice to retain their confer
ence championship at Berkeley next
Sautrday afternoon and evening.
If Captain Dave Rider hadn't suf
fered an unexpected bad day against
the Trojans with no better than
two-thirds to show for his efforts,
the Thorntonmen would have be
come the dual meet coast champs.
Rider will undoubtedly come back

in the four-school meet and ought to
swim stroke for stroke with Win
Need ham, who won firsts in the 221),
and 440-yard free-style in the
Southern Cal affair.
Stanford likewise was unable to
win either relay down south and the
dopesters are giving the Trojans 12
cinch points in those events.
