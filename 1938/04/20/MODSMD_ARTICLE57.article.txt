# Playing Around

### 
ENTHUSIASTIC happiness circulated through
the air-conditioning system of Memorial Hall
last week when the Division of Speech and
Drama discovered that in "Kind Lady" it had
finally picked a champion.
But this week, even before the run is finished,
the Division is looking around for new moun
tains that it can teach to come when it whistles.
Several of the students in dramatics have sug
gested that Stanford arrange a road-show. Oth
ers have suggested more freguent and daring
expeditions into the hinterland of drama.
Both proposals are worth considering. But
there is another idea that is better. Stanford
could arrange to trade plays with the University
of California.
When the Division puts out something like
"Kind Lady" that is undoubtedly a ten-strike, it
could give it at Cal the next week-end. Then,
later in the season when the California players
hit the dramatic jack-pot, they could bring their
show here.
All of this fits in beautifully with the very best
grade of economic theory. Under the present
set-up the Division has to spend most of its time
planning and rehearsing. It then gives a two
night run and slinks or bows back into its office
to start over again.
If we exchanged plays with Cal we would
have productions to fill in the gap while our
home talent is rehearsing in slacks behind
locked doors.
And an exchange of plays would do very
nice things to the box office receipts. If planned
ahead, our productions should collect enough
in Berkeley to leave a surplus over costs of
transportation that would make an accountant
shout with touching joy.
There are other advantages, such as promot
ing better spirit and helping education on its
road toward finer things. But primarily an
exchange with Cal would permit us to get the
most out of our successes. Perhaps we can
use it to get a corner on some of the gold in
the golden bear.â€”J. C.
