# It's a Full Week
## 
### 
PEACE and war in their Stanford counterparts
have been playing tag in the last month or
so, with war finally finishing two days in the
lead. That is, next week the R.O.T.C. will hold
its annual review on Monday, Peace Day will
be Wednesday.
At one time the two events were planned for
the same day, at another, they were a week
apart, with peace leading.
It makes no particular difference how they
came out and there is no doubt that the com
mittees concerned did their best to iron out the
conflict. We only will be asked on one ddy
to admire the potential contribution of Stanford
to the next war, and two days later, to consider
ways and means of obviating that war. This
might be a good object lesson.
The situation also might be a prime example
for the sociologists to use in describing cultural
lag. They couldn't have a better paradox than
the seeming necessity to maintain military units
in those institutions which supposedly lead the
peace movement.
But right now it's only one of those embar
rassing little things the peace committee will
have to pretend it doesn't see.
