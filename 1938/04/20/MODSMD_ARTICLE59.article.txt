# Honest Injun
## 
### 
THERE is a lot of talk these days about the
way we are jettisoning all the pioneer virtues
that kept the wolves and the Indians off the
pioneers' doorsteps.
Ordinarily we don't pay much attention to it.
But recently we have been getting little object
lessons that wake us up considerably more than
the laments of the oldsters trying to get their
liqueurs past their beards. Stanford finds itself
in the midst of a nasty epidemic of stealing.
Books disappear from the Quad; coin tele
phones are despoiled even beyond the patience
of the sensitive holding companies. Coats and
sweaters vanish.

There isn't much we can do about it. Our
system isn't designed for vigilante activities.
And shouting about the crime of it all never
stopped a thief.
But we observe it with sadness, because
much of Stanford life is based on the principle
of honesty.
And we wonder what the modern counterpart
of the wolves and the Indians are going to do
about it.â€”J. C.
