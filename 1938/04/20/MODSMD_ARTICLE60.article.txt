THE INVINCIBLES
r | , HE dictators arc winning their war in Spain. Fran
cisco Franco stands today at the gates of Tortosa,
his holy war to drive out the Communists, given offi
cial blessing by the Pope not three days ago, almost
over. Throughout Europe bland diplomats are getting
ready to recognize, coldly and without emotion, a
fait accompli which has left Spain in ruins; and along
the Riviera a wave of excitement is sweeping the dons
and grandees as they prepare for the not-too-distant
day when they may return to ravaged fields, shat
tered castles, a weary land.
But in Asia the story is not quite the same. Along
the Grand Canal the Chinese are coming back. Out of
the interior in unumbered thousands they are pressing
forward, gradually but inexorably recapturing from
the Japanese territory taken at great cost and with
much loss of life. Twice within 24 hours, spoils of a
nine-month's war have been lost to their original
owners. First Hanchwang, spearhead of the drive to
the south; and then 20 miles of the Grand Canal; and
tomorrow, perhaps, 20 more miles; and then 20 miles
after that; and finally, if all goes well, back to the
waiting sea. . .
It may be that this set-back to the Japanese is only
temporary; it may be that tomorrow's headlines will
once more find them pressing forward, Hanchwang and
the Grand Canal again theirs to command. It may be
that in spite of everything the "invincible" legend can
be resuscitated to prevent its complete collapse.
But for the moment, Japan is in retreat; and it is
significant that it is a retreat extending not only to
a military upset in China, but to defeat in bringing the
war to a quick close, defeat in winning world sym
pathy, defeat in Tokyo, when the Cabinet may soon
have to resign under pressure from an angry Diet.
* * * *
pains have been taken to create the myth
that Japan is invincible. Becuase she defeated a
miserably-equipped Russian Army in 1905, because she
overwhelmed a vastly inferior German Asiatic Fleet
in 1915, becuase she has consistently crushed poorly
armed, poorly-managed Chinese and Manchurian
armies, she has been hailed as a soil of super war
machine, at whose irresistible hands defeat is hardly
a disgrace at all, but rather something to be expected
and accepted, almost with pride. About her has been
placed an aura of excellence, a halo which already is
beginning to tarnish.
For Japan is not invincible, and time is certainly
proving that. A war which was due to be finished in
side a month has dragged on for nine; a conquest
which was to subjugate China has only served to unify
400,000,000 people in enthusiastic opposition to a com
mon foe; the fine excuses which were to have justified
an unjustifiable war have been flung back in the teeth
of those who wait until the noon-hour rush is well
under way before dropping their bombs along Shang
hai's main streets, who deliberately and ruthlessly
abandon military objectives in order to murder inno
cent civilians.
Time works for China in the present Asiatic crisis;
and perhaps time, which may soon be bringing the
grandees back to Spain, will continue to hold out for
her the hope that in justice and decency there is yet
sufficient strength to defeat the enemy.
