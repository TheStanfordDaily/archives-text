D° band leaders ever make comebacks? This isn't
a startling question, but it does have quite a bit
of interest surrounding it. Not long ago Paul White
man was headed for the weed patch but "swing" as it
is known today pulled him back. Perhaps having Jack
Teagarden and Frankie Trombauer in his band had
more than a little to do with it. Anyway, this started
out to be a plug for Ray Noble and the way he has
handled his last waxing "I Hadn't Anyone Till You"
on Brunswick 8079.
Noble made his reputation on slow, sweet music,
arranged in a characteristic manner. In fact, he first
came to notice by winning an arranging contest, held
by the British Broadcasting Company. This latest re
cord has only two choruses, one of them instrumental
with a lot of piano, and the other a Tony 'Martin vocal,
and that's all. However, it is so ably handled in all de
partments that we can't help recommending it as a
must if you haven't already got it.

the really fast stuff we've got the Duke and
Count Basie back on the list. Ellington pops forth
with a little number which he aptly calls "Braggin'
the Brass," Brunswick 8099. and it gives out plenty of
trombone. The slip horns are the fastest we've heard
since the old Casa Loma "Wild Goose Chase."
Basie's little epic is entitled "Every Tub." Don't
ask me why! (apologies to Dwight Fiske). It starts with
a lot of tenor drive, Lester Young, we believe, and
then goes into Basie's piano which is something to listen
to with amazement. These two arc the best of the race
records on the lists.
Larry Clinton, who has been swinging the classics
with wild abandon, does it again with "The Gavotte"
and "The Dance of the Hours". You'll find it on Victor
25805 with a Bea Wain vocal on the Gavotte side.
These arc musically good, but aside from the unique
ness of the arrangements, they haven't much to offer.
But you'll like them as well as you liked his "I Dreamt
I Dwelt in Marble Halls" and "Martha".

Tommy Dorsey's offerings are from the files and
they include the oldies "Yearning" and Deed I Do" on
Victor 25815. These are only fair, and since the Dorscy
aggregation is showing signs of disintegration the de
cline is not unexpected. They have never equalled the
peak they set when they waxed "Marie." And now
that Bud Freeman on tenor and Dave Tough on drums
have gone over to Benny Goodman, the band is going
to be hard put to come up to its previous reputation.
For something that is a little old now, we offer
"Memories of You" by the Casa Loma crew. Sonny
Dunham is featured on trumpet and it is one of the
best examples we know of "white swing." We're not
including Bunny Berrigan or Harry James because wo
feel that they stand beyond all other comparison.
