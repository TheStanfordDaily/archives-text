# Purdy Discusses Religious Trends
## 
### 
' Man, lacking instincts, possesses
a questioning attitude. Religion must
always fill a need in man's life."
With these words, Acting Universi
ty Chaplain Alexander C. Purdy
answered the question "Is Religion
Dying Out?" in an informal discus
sion before Luncheon Club yesterday
noon in the Women's Clubhouse. He
traced the growth of the "new re
ligion of Nationalism" as evidenced
in Germany. Russia, and Mexico.
Dr. Purdy, the Hosmer Professor
of New Testament at Hartford Theo
logical Seminary, is replacing Dr.
Elton Trueblood as Chaplain during
Spring Quarter. Arrangements for
the discussion were made through a
student committee headed by Wil
ma Baker and Vaughn Raymond.
