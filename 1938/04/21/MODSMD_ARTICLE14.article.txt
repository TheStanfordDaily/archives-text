# Jordan Syllabus Gives Peace Course Outline
## 
### HARRY SHELDON 
Best reply to those who wonder just exactly how a course in peace
as has been under discussion in The Daily and elsewhere on the campus
for the last few days, would be given and organized is contained in a
syllabus prepared by Dr. David Starr Jordan and Dr. E. J. Krchbiel for
a similar course given from 1909 to 1916.

This course on "International
ciliation" primarily treated its subject
as a social institution in its attempt j
to remove the intangibilities of the j
ideal.
Tomany, the general outline of j
the course sounds dull, because the
subject matter is concealed behind
general phrases. Thirty years ago,
however, it became one of the most
popular at Stanford.
Critics maintain that it obviously
did no good since students im
mediately chose war over peace in
1916.
Conclusions of the course as to !
the best means of promoting peace |
hinged upon education — education
particularly through the school sys
tems of the world.
'Peace ideals may be inculcated
by the method of teaching or by
the emphasis placed upon special
subjects," the syllabus maintained.
Guard Against Romanticism
As practical suggestions, Dr. Jor- '
dan and Dr. Krehbiel suggested !
that educators guard against the ro
mantic element in literature and dis
tortion in considering war, stress
the economic independence and unity
of the world, and international ethics
—in other words, education for peace
by calm, careful methods.
History, particularly, they felt i
should be taught with especial care. |
"History should try to teach the |
truth," they said. "The truth about !
the past will deprive war of much
glamour."
This truth, they felt, should ex
tend to the exposition of "service
in the army as a private, the fruits
of war, war slogans and their role, j
and the underlying causes of war." i
Course Has Eight Subjects
Plans of the couse divided it in
to eight subjects.
These included "History of War- '
fare,' Evils of War," "Historical
Background of the Peace Movement,"
"Beginnings of a World Legislature,"
"Beginnings of a World Judiciary,"
"Case For and Against War," "Con
ditions Tending to Promote Inter
national Amity," and "Means of
Promotings Peace."
