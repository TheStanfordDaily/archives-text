# Political Union Chains Members
## Liberals Lead Labor, Conservative Groups 
### 
After a day and a half, 30 appli
cations have already been turned in
for membership in Stanford Politi
cal Union, Ed Kerr, liberal party
leader, reported yesterday.
Of this group, applicants for mem
bership for the liberal party were
in a plurality, with the conserva
tive and labor parties trailing in
that order. Applications, now on file
at the A.S.S.U. office, may be turned
in until April 26, when party leaders
Kerr, Mark Hopkins, and Dick Rid
dell will officially elect permanent
members.
Kerr emphasized the fact that ap
plications are necessary in order to
establish a voting constituency for
the first meeting. Only those who
have applied by next Tuesday will
be allowed to vote at the meeting
Thursday, he said.
At that time, Gerald Marcus, or
iginator of the Union at Stanford,
will explain the purposes and set
up of the organization, and present
a constitution for approval by the
members. Party leaders will have
contacted members and organized
them for future discussion.
Although only members will be
allowed to take part in debate, any
others interested will be admitted as
spectators, and may apply to the
Election Board for membership,
Kerr said.
