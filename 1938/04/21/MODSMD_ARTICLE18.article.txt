"In case of controversy, neither the
Stanford Union or the Stanford Uni
versity Library assumes any respon
sibility for the books returned
through this channel.

"It should be kept in mind that
only one collection will be made
each day, and that books turned in
after 8 o'clock, or 2 o'clock will
not be collected until the following
day, and the usual fines will accrue."
Mr. Van Patten especially em
phasized the fact that only reserved
books were to be turned in to the
Union. "We don't want this to turn
into a trucking business," he said.
Both Miss Christine Rieker, di
rector of the Union, and John Gun
j ther, manager of the cigar counter,
are cooperating with Mr. Van Patten
|in this arrangement. Mr. Gunther
promises safe keeping of the books
turned in. Van Patten reported. "So
there should be no complaints about
I books being lost,'' he said.
