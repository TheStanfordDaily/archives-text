added sidelight on the Big
Meet coming up this Saturday is
contained in a little deal emanating
from the B.A.C. publicity office,
manned by Don Liebendorfer.
It has to do with one of the Pa
cific Coast's grandest veterans ever
in track and field, the late John Elli
ott, to v/hose memory the annual
P.A.A. meet is now dedicated. "Auld-
Jawn" was for almost half a century
a beloved track official on the Coast,
and he'll not be soon forgotten.
But to leave the story in the hands
of the B.A.C. news dispenser:
"Stanford and California ath
letes of the future will have an
addi'd incentive to out-do them
selves in their annual clash. The
winning team in Saturday's Big
Meet will he the first to have its
name engraved on the new John
Elliott Memorial Troph.
"The giant cup, which stands for
ty inches high, weighs sixty pounds,
and cost $1000, was made possible
through subscriptions of friends of
the late John Elliott, 'Grand Old
Man' of track and field athletics on
the Pacific Coast. It will be a per
petual trophy, to be awarded each
year to the winner of the California-
Stanford meet, and there is space on
the base for 300 plates with the win
ner and score for each year.
" 'John,' as he was familiarly
known to thousands of athletes and
lans officiated at the first Stanford-
California meet in 1893, and at every
other Big Meet prior to last year,
when he died. For many years he was
referee and was more like a father
to 'his boys' than an official.
"In 1930, with fourteen other
men he helped to form 'The Old
Time Athletics' Association,' an or
ganization composed of men who
had been out of active competi
tion for at least thirty years. Elli
ott was president of this organ
ization at the time of his passing.
"After his death, a committee of
four men was selected to secure
the trophy for which Stanford and
California athletes will vie Satur
day. Members of the committee are:
Wm. A. Magee, California '87; Wm.
F. Humphrey, President of the Olym
pic Club; Charles M. Yates of the
Old Time Athletes' Association; and
I). E. Brown, Stanford '97.
"The trophy will be dedicated
formally at a ceremony on the turf
of the Stanford Stadium Saturday
afternoon just before the first track
ev'ent. Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Presi
dent of Stanford University; and Dr.
Kobert Gordon Sproul, President
of the Univeristy of California, will
participate in the dedication. Max
L. Rosenfeldt of the Old Time Ath
letes' Association will make the pre-*
sentation speech."
