# Cards Ready To Meet Cal On Saturday
## Burrows Confined With Sore Throat; Ailment Not Serious 
### JERRY MAYER 
Panic struck the Stanford camp
lor a few brief moments yesterday
afternoon when it was discovered
j that Ed Burrows, lanky distance ace,
had been confined to the Rest Home
| with a sore throat. However, his
| ailment is not serious and he is ex
j pected to be in top shape for Satur
day's Big Meet with Cal in the
j Stanford Stadium.
An interesting sidelight to the
meet is the fact that Stanford will
! have II men competing who between
i them accounted tor 41 points of last
! year's winning total of 77 1-3 to
)53 2-3. These men are Dick Carew,
! thirds in each sprint; Ray Malott,
! firsts in the 220 ;ind 440 and a lap
!in the winning relay team; Carl
j Mahurin, second in the 880; Rusty
March, third in the mile; Ed Bur
rows, third in the two-mile.
Three Firsts
Tom Montgomery, first in the
J shot; Hugh Gribbin and Pete Zagar,
I first and second in the discus; Leo
! Madlem, second in the broad jump;
j and Vic Boore and Duke Gill, first
and third in the pole vault.
Cal will have 29points return
ing. It would seem that if the Stan-
I ford point scorers of '37 could re
| peat their performances and new
j comers came through that the Cardi
; nals might upset the favored Bears.
This much is certain, that hopes
j are steadily rising on the Farm for a
i victory. Coach Robert Lyman Tem
pleton hasn't nearly the material
; to work with that Brutus Hamilton
j has at Cal, but Dink is noted for
his ability to juggle his men and get
: the maximum amount of points.
Cards in Good Shape
With the Cards in top shape, with
I the possible exception of Burrows,
[ the question marks are all on the
j California side of the fence. Several
: crucial men on the Bear squad are
! handicapped by various ills at pres
! ent and although they are all ex
! pected to compete, the question is
i whether they can perform up to
1 standard.
On the Bear doubtful list are
i Doug Lehman, javelin thrower and
broad-jumper; Bob Law, high
i jumper and javelin thrower; Don
: Watts, quarter-miler; and Arnold
I Nutting, ace sprinter and broad
j jumper.

Panic struck the Stanford camp
lor a few brief moments yesterday
afternoon when it was discovered
j that Ed Burrows, lanky distance ace,
had been confined to the Rest Home
| with a sore throat. However, his
| ailment is not serious and he is ex
j pected to be in top shape for Satur
day's Big Meet with Cal in the
j Stanford Stadium.
An interesting sidelight to the
meet is the fact that Stanford will
! have II men competing who between
i them accounted tor 41 points of last
! year's winning total of 77 1-3 to
)53 2-3. These men are Dick Carew,
! thirds in each sprint; Ray Malott,
! firsts in the 220 ;ind 440 and a lap
!in the winning relay team; Carl
j Mahurin, second in the 880; Rusty
March, third in the mile; Ed Bur
rows, third in the two-mile.
Three Firsts
Tom Montgomery, first in the
J shot; Hugh Gribbin and Pete Zagar,
I first and second in the discus; Leo
! Madlem, second in the broad jump;
j and Vic Boore and Duke Gill, first
and third in the pole vault.
Cal will have 29points return
ing. It would seem that if the Stan-
I ford point scorers of '37 could re
| peat their performances and new
j comers came through that the Cardi
; nals might upset the favored Bears.
This much is certain, that hopes
j are steadily rising on the Farm for a
i victory. Coach Robert Lyman Tem
pleton hasn't nearly the material
; to work with that Brutus Hamilton
j has at Cal, but Dink is noted for
his ability to juggle his men and get
: the maximum amount of points.
Cards in Good Shape
With the Cards in top shape, with
I the possible exception of Burrows,
[ the question marks are all on the
j California side of the fence. Several
: crucial men on the Bear squad are
! handicapped by various ills at pres
! ent and although they are all ex
! pected to compete, the question is
i whether they can perform up to
1 standard.
On the Bear doubtful list are
i Doug Lehman, javelin thrower and
broad-jumper; Bob Law, high
i jumper and javelin thrower; Don
: Watts, quarter-miler; and Arnold
I Nutting, ace sprinter and broad
j jumper.
