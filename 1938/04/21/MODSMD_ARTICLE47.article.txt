# Four Card Golfers Shine On Cal Course
## 
### 
Farm golfers threw a shadow across Cal's hopes for winning the Big
Match and the P.C.C. title tomorrow when they played on the Clairmont
Country Club course, Cal's home course, yesterday.
Playing brilliantly on the short hut tricky course, all four of Coach
Eddie Twigg's varsity men turned in exceptional scores.

All-University champion. Jack.
Wallace seared the Clairmont course
with a blazing 69, while A1 Hyman
carded a 70, Brown Cannon a 71,
and Bill Boyd a 71, aLso.
Tomorrow they go back across the
bay again, this time to play with
and against Cal. This time they will
be playing when low scores will
count for more than predictions.
They will be playing to make their
predictions true.
Along with the varsity golfers,
Coach Twiggs will be taking his
frosh squad over to play the Bear
frosh. Then a week from tomororw,
Cal sends its teams over here for
the second and last Big Match of
the year.
There will be more at stake in
these matches this year than just a
dual meet title. Cal and Stanford
will be playing for the P.C.C. champ
ionship, both teams having defeated
U. S. C.. and U. C. L. A., their only
opponents, twice.
At stake, also, will be Stanford's
chances for sending a six-man team
back East for the National Inter
collegiate team championships. The
boys will or will not go, depending
on how they show against Cal.
