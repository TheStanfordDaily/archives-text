On the new varsity courts for the
first time yesterday afternoon, Stan
ford's netmen were in anything but
top form while preparing the Cal
match coming up Saturday.
According to Coach Sherm Lock
wood. the players will need sever
al days to accustom themselves to
the new surface, which produces a
much slower and lower bounce.
Captain Bob Underwood did not
take part in the workouts, but there
is a possibility that he will be in
shape before Saturday.
Bob Braly was way off when
Freshman Bob Low took him in
straight sets. Braly's ground strokes
were erratic and his service ineffec
tive.
Dave Brock, No. 3 man on the
varsity, displayed some good ten
nis but wasn't steady enough for
Jack Lynch, veteran of last year's
team, who won at (5-2 in the third
set.
Lloyd Gates was the only varsity
man playing up to par and he gave
Coach Lockwood plenty of fun in
a couple of practice sessions.

man team to the annual invitation
tournament at Ojai the weekend of
April 29. Flayers reaching the
round of 16 in the tourney will au
