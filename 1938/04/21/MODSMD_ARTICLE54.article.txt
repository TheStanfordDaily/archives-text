## Indian Defeat Closes Polo Series; Downey, Mosse Star in Match 
### 
Stanford saw collegiate polo at its j
best yesterday afternoon on the |
I Highway Field when the Arizona |
! squad, after a slow start, fought |
its way to a G-4 victory over a per- j
i sistent and hard-riding Indian quaiv i
tet.
The Cards held the edge for the !
. first two chukkers, but the Wild- I
cats hit their stride by running in j
! two goals in the third, after which I
| they kept the lead. Both teams
| played fast, clean, heads-up ball
i throughout and it was a real fight
j to the finish.
Outstanding man on the field was
| diminutive Charlie Mosse, riding
| No. 1 for Arizona, whose powerful
drives and clever riding paved the 1
| way for his team mates. Steven j
Downey, an aggressive and steady i
! rider, lead the Indian attack with
I two goals. Bert McClintock and Don
McAusland brought in the other two
1 markers for the Cards.
Charlie Mosse, Gay nor Hathaway,
iand Wiiiam Dent shared honors for
j the Wildcats with two goals each.
Completing the rosters were Cap
l tain Jim Fullerton, number one for
| the Farm, and Bob Branson, at num
j ber three for Arizona.
The victory was a repeat for the
Wildcats of the 6-4 game played
here Monday, and marks the close
I of the series.
