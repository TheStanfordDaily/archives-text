# Thornton Predicts Championship Win
## 
### 
Nort Thornton predicted yester
day that U.S.C. would win the con
ference swimming championship
this Saturday in Berkeley by one
point. He also exhibited a form
sheet wherein Stanford and Cali
fornia would likely be lied in sec
ond place, a single digit behind.
Thornton's dope sheet gave the
Cards only one reasonably sure
first-place, in the 440-yard free
style where either Win Needham
or Capt. Dave Rider's favored. Need
ham won twice last week-end against
the Bears earlier in the quarter.
The New York City board of edu
cation has ruled that aliens may not
be admitted free to the city's col
leges.
