# Going Over to the Enemy
## 
### 
IF the shades of former freshmen don t hover
over Enema Friday night, I'm going to quit
believing in this ghost business. They at least
should tear the place down.
For at Encina Saturday night there will be 300
freshmen from that institution across the bay,
called the University of California at best, at
worst unprintable words. They will be on the
t campus all afternoon, mingling with the Stanford
freshmen, canoeing together, eating together,
dancing together.
It's a bad business, because before the day
is over I'm afraid that the frosh are going to
find that the Cal frosh as a species is a pretty
good kid, who washes behind his ears and
minds his manners in the company of women.
And that runs counter to most of Stanford
tradition.
Cal people, we say in our peculiar patois,
are all toads. Of course we may say that be
cause we want to make ourselves seem supe
rior and because we are secretly proud of pay
ing for our education. But we have grown up
on that theory, and it's going to hurt us to
change it.
One of the things that may happen is the
cessation of the bitter athletic rivalry between
the two schools. We might continue to compete
in the various sports, and shout and cheer for
our teams. But we no longer could think that
sheer dishonesty kept us from winning.
Luckily, so far this is being done only by
one class. If we're careful we may be able to
keep our shame from the class of '42. Next
year, '41 will be safely in the sophomore group,
and the traditional hotbed of the hate Cal spirit
■s in Encina. But if it becomes a custom, the
University will surely go to pot.
For instance, freshmen, deceived by appear
ances, might cease their annual raids on the
Cal campus during Big Game week. There have
been efforts to achieve this in the past, but we
really didn't mean it. If those raids cease, some
of the Game week spirit will go, and pretty
soon we will end up with nothing but a foot
ball game.
Worst of all, however, is the chance that we
might lose our sense of superiority. It may be
false, but we have lived with it for years. Cut
adrift from it, there is no telling where we would
end up.
The frosh definitely are playing with fire.

For instance, freshmen, deceived by appear
ances, might cease their annual raids on the
Cal campus during Big Game week. There have
been efforts to achieve this in the past, but we
really didn't mean it. If those raids cease, some
of the Game week spirit will go, and pretty
soon we will end up with nothing but a foot
ball game.
Worst of all, however, is the chance that we
might lose our sense of superiority. It may be
false, but we have lived with it for years. Cut
adrift from it, there is no telling where we would
end up.
The frosh definitely are playing with fire.
IF the shades of former freshmen don t hover
over Enema Friday night, I'm going to quit
believing in this ghost business. They at least
should tear the place down.
For at Encina Saturday night there will be 300
freshmen from that institution across the bay,
called the University of California at best, at
worst unprintable words. They will be on the
t campus all afternoon, mingling with the Stanford
freshmen, canoeing together, eating together,
dancing together.
It's a bad business, because before the day
is over I'm afraid that the frosh are going to
find that the Cal frosh as a species is a pretty
good kid, who washes behind his ears and
minds his manners in the company of women.
And that runs counter to most of Stanford
tradition.
Cal people, we say in our peculiar patois,
are all toads. Of course we may say that be
cause we want to make ourselves seem supe
rior and because we are secretly proud of pay
ing for our education. But we have grown up
on that theory, and it's going to hurt us to
change it.
One of the things that may happen is the
cessation of the bitter athletic rivalry between
the two schools. We might continue to compete
in the various sports, and shout and cheer for
our teams. But we no longer could think that
sheer dishonesty kept us from winning.
Luckily, so far this is being done only by
one class. If we're careful we may be able to
keep our shame from the class of '42. Next
year, '41 will be safely in the sophomore group,
and the traditional hotbed of the hate Cal spirit
■s in Encina. But if it becomes a custom, the
University will surely go to pot.
