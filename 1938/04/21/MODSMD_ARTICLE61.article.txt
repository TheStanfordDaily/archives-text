CHECKS and balances moved creaking along
their constitutional paths Tuesday night
when Ex Committee deliberated on Stagers' re
quest for 525 to administer their new scholar
ship.
When the mists cleared away, Ex Committee
found that it had refused the request. This was
undoubtedly good government, and it was prob
ably good finance—with a slightly Republican
twist. But it wasn't exactly fair to Stagers, and
it didn't mix well with the gently benevolent
spirit in which the Committee had granted the
scholarship.
In opposing the request Student Manager
Chuck Fontius did his job in a way that would
brighten the heart of any business tycoon. He
is paid to keep the A.S.S.U. funds from wan
dering out of the A.S.S.U. back yard. And in
asking for the money Stagers showed that it
hadn't been cutting its econ classes during
rehearsals.
Stagers had S6O in its adolescent treasury.
Dramatic Council account stood at $1700. In
situations like this, it isn't hard to believe that
Marx wasn't such a dumbbell after all.
Fontius won, because Ex Committee can't
distrust its Manager any more than a prisoner
can distrust his lawyer. But it looks as though
Stagers were treated with a rugged individual
ism that doesn't go too well in these days of
social security and progressive taxation.
If Ex Committee was going to contribute $500
for a scholarship it might have kept up the
Santa Claus pretense long enough to grant
administrative exponses. Instead, after being
very paternal and jolly, it suddenly pulled off

its beard and said, "Now it's your turn to
pay up."
The Dramatic Council account could stand
the expense without feeling it. To Stagers it
means pouring half their capital down the drain.
The scholarship was a nice piece of work.
But the quibbling about administrative expense
spoils the effect. If Ex Committee has aspira
tions toward philanthropy, it should get a good
publicity agent. —J. C.
