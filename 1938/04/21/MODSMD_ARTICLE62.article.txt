WITH Nathan Van Patten's announcement
of his new "little library" at the Union
cigar counter, we learn that the library, sirs,
marches on. From now on, the boys with 8 and
9 o'clock classes on the far side of the Quad
won't have to break their necks making the
dead-line for reserved books. As they pass the
Union on their way down the Row, they can
turn in their books and forget about it.
Mr. Van Patten's scheme has several merits.
(1) It saves time.
(2) It saves shoe-leather.
(3) Every library we ever saw has a place
to return books in off hours.
(4) Mr. Van Patten thought of it himself,
thereby beating campus gripers to the draw.
In fact, we are quite happy about the whole
thing.—J. S.
