PEACE AND THE OLD BOY
]VOW THAT Old Boy is to be heartily congratulated
on his full page campaigns against war in that pecu
liar institution which blossoms like some sickly liver
wort on the Quad each month, claiming to be a funny
mag. Such idealism is highly to be commended, and the
Old Boy and his invaluable assistant, Art Lites, de
serve many thanks for making a good point and making
it well.
But the Old Boy should not become flushed with
his success to the extent of forgetting that variety
is the spice of life. He should not feel that just because
he has published some excellent broadsides his pub
lic is willing to take the same idea in unending varia
tion, effective though each succeeding presentation
may be.
The Old Boy must remember that the horrors of
war are being pounded into us all day and every day,
through such visual mediums as the picture-magazines
and the screen, the periodicals and the press. America
knows that she does not want war. She knows what
the price of war is. She is determined not to let herself
be dragged into it again. She is aware of the blood, the
agony, the horror. But it is possible that she may some
day get tired of hearing about them.
Beyond a certain point, man loses all ability to
feel, becomes dulled to pain, skeptical to terror, un
willing to believe that such things can be and not
caring so very much if they are.
America has not reached that point yet, but some
day she may. And when she does, the Old Boy will be
as much to blame as anyone if we have lost the ability
to rebel against needless Armageddon. He has told us,
now about the man who refused to support war, about
the $5000 spent on a college education which may be
blown to bits within the year, about the various other
negative aspects of the greatest, racket on earth. We
appreciate these things, and applaud the Old Boy; but
we cannot help but feel that such harpings on an oft
repeated theme are beginning to lose their punch.
Repetition is a treacherous weapon, at once the
most effective and most deadly we possess; and lest in
in the Old Boy's hands it become as vicious as in those
of the munitions makers or the Hearst press, we would
urge that his campaign, having been against war long
enough, turn now toward peace.
