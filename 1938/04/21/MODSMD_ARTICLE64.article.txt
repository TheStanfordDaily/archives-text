# GOIN' MY WAY

### 
AS SISTER McGonigle said in Chappie yesterday,
there isn't, much use in our telling you where to go
these lovely Spring evenings, but just for future refer
ence, there has been a turnover in bands at the city.
Anson Weeks opened last night at the Mark, replacing
Joe Reichman. Judging by his popularity in the past,
this should please a good many people. It has been a
long time since old Anson swung his baton in the
Frantic.
And to the St. Francis, following Roger Pryor's suc
ccsful stay, comes Harry Owens, with his Hawaiian
music. Though it won't get a tumble from the swing
fans, his music somehow hits the spot during this, the
most romantic of seasons.
As you probably know, Carl Ravazza at the Sir
Francis Drake is giving Stanford a tumble with his
Stanford Nights, the first of which came off yester
day. Besides featuring campus entertainers, he will
be playing many of the Gaieties songs of this year.
If things keep up, Stanford's song-writers many finally
break into the big money. By this time, there are about
four bands with arrangements of some of the best of
them.
* * * *
HAVEN'T said anything about radio for quite
a long time. But there ins't much to say really.
Tilings just go along about as usual—Benny is good,
Benny is lousy. Charlie McCarthy is still the top man
on the air, and the Manhattan Merry-go-round the
stinker. Crosby and Burns manage to hit a casual
consistency which is little short of phenomenal. But
the prize of them all for consistant fine entertainment
is the Radio City Music Hall, on Sundays. This program
is always way above the batting average. It has variety,
interest, and genuine worth. RCA deserves all the
credit there is to give for their program.
# * * *
In the city, Friday afternoon and Saturday marks
the close of the San Francisco Symphony ocncerts.
With an organization that is as spotty in make-up as
he has. Pierre Monteux is doing a mighty good job.
But we are hoping that some day they will find a brass
section that, doesn't sound like part of a high school
band. Perhaps the most interesting part of the season
was the amazing array of guest stars. When such people
as Heifetz, Elmann. Schnable, Hoftnann, and, of all
people, Brian Ahorne turn up in the concerts, you can
be pretty sure of getting your money's worth. All in
all, the season was pretty fine.

But we have really just been filling this column for
one purpose, and that is to say:

Joe Reichman. Judging by his popularity in the past,
this should please a good many people. It has been a
long time since old Anson swung his baton in the
Frantic.
And to the St. Francis, following Roger Pryor's suc
ccsful stay, comes Harry Owens, with his Hawaiian
music. Though it won't get a tumble from the swing
fans, his music somehow hits the spot during this, the
most romantic of seasons.
As you probably know, Carl Ravazza at the Sir
Francis Drake is giving Stanford a tumble with his
Stanford Nights, the first of which came off yester
day. Besides featuring campus entertainers, he will
be playing many of the Gaieties songs of this year.
If things keep up, Stanford's song-writers many finally
break into the big money. By this time, there are about
four bands with arrangements of some of the best of
them.

HAVEN'T said anything about radio for quite

Tilings just go along about as usual—Benny is good,
Benny is lousy. Charlie McCarthy is still the top man
on the air, and the Manhattan Merry-go-round the
stinker. Crosby and Burns manage to hit a casual
consistency which is little short of phenomenal. But
the prize of them all for consistant fine entertainment
is the Radio City Music Hall, on Sundays. This program
is always way above the batting average. It has variety,
interest, and genuine worth. RCA deserves all the
credit there is to give for their program.

In the city, Friday afternoon and Saturday marks
the close of the San Francisco Symphony ocncerts.
With an organization that is as spotty in make-up as
he has. Pierre Monteux is doing a mighty good job.
But we are hoping that some day they will find a brass
section that, doesn't sound like part of a high school
band. Perhaps the most interesting part of the season
was the amazing array of guest stars. When such people
as Heifetz, Elmann. Schnable, Hoftnann, and, of all
people, Brian Ahorne turn up in the concerts, you can
be pretty sure of getting your money's worth. All in
all, the season was pretty fine.

AS SISTER McGonigle said in Chappie yesterday,
there isn't, much use in our telling you where to go
these lovely Spring evenings, but just for future refer
ence, there has been a turnover in bands at the city.
Anson Weeks opened last night at the Mark, replacing
Joe Reichman. Judging by his popularity in the past,
this should please a good many people. It has been a
long time since old Anson swung his baton in the
