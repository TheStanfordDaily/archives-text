# Billy The Kid Hits Ringer At Stanford
## 
### 
"Billy the Kid," revived yesterday
at the Fox-Stanford:
In these days when a Western is
either a slick saga for the carriage
trade or an excuse for passing out
free china, "Billy the Kid" turns
up to remind us of the death of one
of the lively arts.
The type of thriller which forms
cover-to-cover grist for the pulps,
'Billy the Kid" nevertheless has a
degree of artistry and a modicum
of sincerity which has fallen by the
wayside with the sort of cold-blooded
routine ground out today for con
sumption in Menlo and points north.
No Blushes
Charles McArthur didn't blush to
write dialogue for "Billy the Kid",
Wallace Beery to act in it, or King
Vidor to direct it. When Johnny
Mack Brown, as the terror of New
Mexico, whipped out his .38 and
plugged the villain and his hench
men, he did it with some gusto, not
like a tired old Thespian whose
conception of the prairie is based
on a familiarity with life in Flat
bush.
On the other hand, "Billy the Kid"
was no snobby spectacle of the sort
which now gets billing in the up
town theaters. It's blood-and-thun
der was not pawned off as the history
of the West. No 50-piece symphony
struck up in the big moments. No
body christened a railroad nor
erected a transcontinental telegraph
system. The heroine's dress was no
Adrian adaptation of the sun-bonnet
girl.
Remember?
To all those who remember buy
ing peanuts next door to the theater
at the confectionery where the win
dows were full of dirty rock candy
and colored paper soda concoctions
—to those who remember the peel
ing poster of Tom Mix on his charg
er—and to those who remember get
ting in for a dime after the age of
twelve, was dedicated the revival of
"Billy the Kid."—Slater
