The Editor, Sir:
One of the advantages of a rela
tively small University such as
Stanford should be the personal con
tacts and asosciations between fac
ulty and students. Surely no one will
deny that this advantage has not
been enjoyed by enough of us stu
dents.
The Axe Society field day this
Friday afternoon, April 22nd gives
us, the students, a bridge on which
to span that gap between the faculty
and ourselves that exists at Stan
ford. Here is a splendid opportun
ity to catch the faculty down on
the student's level; it gives the
students and faculty a chance to
th row away the old books, forget
about the shiny apple, and have
some fun together.
It is interesting to note how anxi
ous the faculty is to get into the
spirit of this field day. Its success
now depends upon us, the students of
Stanford. Here is thrown upon the
students themselves the responsibil
ity—for it is a responsibility, if not
even an obligation— to bring them
selves, and men who are as Stan
ford-conscious as the students them
selves, and as interested in knowing
their students as the students are
in knowing their faculty. But the
beauty of the field day is that the
gap is to be bridged in a swell, en
joyable, back-to-Nature fashion.
The Axe Society has touched upon
one of the most pertinent problems
of our campus life. The faculty will
be out there to solve it; it's now up
to us, the students.
