# Soph Barbecue Set for April 30
## 
### 
Contrary to announcement Mon
day in The Daily, the Sophomore
Barbecue has been definitely set
for April 30, according to Class
President Don Berger, because no
other events are scheduled on that
day.
Tickets are 25 cents, including food
and round trip bus fare. They will
be on sale at the A.S.S.U. only until
tomorrow, Berger said, because
buses must be arranged for at that
time.
Asking again that the whole class
come together in buses rather than
taking private cars, Berger said that
although the affair is no-date, wo
men are to come too. The barbecue
will be held at Half Moon Bay, and
will last from 1 to 7 o'clock.
