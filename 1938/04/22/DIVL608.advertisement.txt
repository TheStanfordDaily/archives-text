\ ~ - \ LIFETIME TO GO
Once graduated from college, it may be years before you have the
time or as good an opportunity to see Europe as now. And, perhaps,
in later years, the happy, carefree days you spend crossing the Atlantic
on a ship of Hapag or Lloyd may be hard to match. In Cabin, Tourist,
or Third Class you'll find scores of other college men and women who—
like you—chose Hapag-Lloyd for their hospitality, comfort and service.
