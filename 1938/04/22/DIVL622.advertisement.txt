1. Tt W horsepower of one type of electric clock motor is
eleven millionths H.P. A dynamometer made in the
Westinghouse Research Dept. has accurately meas
ured and plotted this fact.
The first officially scheduled radio broadcast was that
of the Harding-Cox presidential election returns, sent
out over Westinghouse Station KDKA, P ttsburgh,
Pa., on Nov. 2, 192C.
Modern high-efficiency Westinghouse-equipped gener
ating stations produce a KWH of electricity on 1 lb.
of coal, base load. The national average for 1037 was
1.43 lbs. In 1922 the figure was 2.5: in 1927, 1.75; in
1932, 1.5.
Some of the Westinghouse elevators in Radio City,
believed to be the fastest in the world, travel at the
speed of 1400 ft. per second.
The largest all-electric-welded building ftonnage and
floor space) is the 12-story Central Engineering Labo
ratory building of the Westinghouse Electric & Mfg.
Co. at East Pittsburgh, Pa.
The greatest advantage of alternating current, as
recognized by Geo. Westinghouse more than 50 years
ago, is the facility with which its voltages can be
stepped up or down for various needs of transmission
or use. /
*2 m Oliver B. Shallenberger, a young engineer with the
Westinghouse Electric Co., discovered the principle
in 1888 and developed the first A.C. watt hour meter.
It has been basically unchanged to this day.
0 b Micarta is a laminated synthetic resin material, devel
oped by Westinghouse and having many desirable
electrical and mechanical characteristics. It is used
for insulation, bearings, bushings and many industrial
purposes, as well as for decorative work of all kinds.
Electricity } $ less today per KWH, on
the national average, than it did in 1913. It is one of
the few commodities that has steadily decreased in
cost during these 25 years.
10. Hydrogen has been found to be a better cooling
medium than air, and 10 out of the last 14 large 2-pole
3600 r.p.m. generators use it. Westinghouse pioneer
ing led to this improvement.

The greatest advantage of alternating current, as
recognized by Geo. Westinghouse more than 50 years
ago, is the facility with which its voltages can be
stepped up or down for various needs of transmission
or use. /

Westinghouse Electric Co., discovered the principle
in 1888 and developed the first A.C. watt hour meter.
It has been basically unchanged to this day.
0 b Micarta is a laminated synthetic resin material, devel
oped by Westinghouse and having many desirable
electrical and mechanical characteristics. It is used
for insulation, bearings, bushings and many industrial
purposes, as well as for decorative work of all kinds.
Electricity } $ less today per KWH, on
the national average, than it did in 1913. It is one of
the few commodities that has steadily decreased in
cost during these 25 years.
10. Hydrogen has been found to be a better cooling
medium than air, and 10 out of the last 14 large 2-pole
3600 r.p.m. generators use it. Westinghouse pioneer
ing led to this improvement.

coming issue of your college publication. Electricity is the
greatest single force in this modern age. Learn more about
it — and about the companies, like Westinghouse, that
put it to doing the world's work.

1. Tt W horsepower of one type of electric clock motor is
eleven millionths H.P. A dynamometer made in the
Westinghouse Research Dept. has accurately meas

The first officially scheduled radio broadcast was that
of the Harding-Cox presidential election returns, sent
out over Westinghouse Station KDKA, P ttsburgh,
Pa., on Nov. 2, 192C.
Modern high-efficiency Westinghouse-equipped gener
ating stations produce a KWH of electricity on 1 lb.
of coal, base load. The national average for 1037 was
1.43 lbs. In 1922 the figure was 2.5: in 1927, 1.75; in
1932, 1.5.
