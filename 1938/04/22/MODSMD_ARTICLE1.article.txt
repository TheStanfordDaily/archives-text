### BILL MILLIS 
the history of our times an im
portant but little discussed fac
tor is the strenuous effort which
governments of all nations are mak
ing to secure the entire co-operation
of labor in supporting the military
preparations for war.
Such co-operation requires that
trade unions, particularly those in i
the basic heavy industries, modify j
their wage demands, accept longer ;
work hours, and gradually relin- ]
quish reliance upon strikes in favor j
of governmental promises of arbi- I
tration.
This issue, which for many months [
has plagued the former Popular j
Front and now moderate govern- j
ments in France and the Tory cab- i
inet in England, will in coming I
weeks secure attention throughout I
the United States, as result of a sig- j
nificant decision issued in Washing
ton yesterday by the National Labor
Relations Board.
The board, in its second major
decision on the legality of sit
down strikes, found that the Doug
las Aircraft Co. of Santa Monica
was guilty of violating the Wag;-
ner Act for refusing to reinstate
15 of the 250 workers, who in Feb
ruary, 1937, occupied the com
pany's plant for three days.
The board ordered the re-employ
ment of the ousted strikers, all of
whom were members of the United
Automobile Workers of America,
and 11 of whom had been convicted
on conspiracy charges.

Fascism has been likened to many
things by many men. Yesterday
President Roosevelt found it a con
venient phrase to use in an address
to delegates to the Daughters of the
American Revolution convening in
Washington, urging that American
youth be educated in the same fun
damentals that impelled "our revo
lutionary ancestors to throw off the
Fascist yoke."
"We cannot overestimate the
importance of keeping alive the
spirit of American democracy and
the spirit of opportunity, the kind
of spirit that has led us as a na
tion to meet the great problems of
the past," he said.

Madrid front yesterday, as
Spanish Insurgents, striking from
the ruined University City suburb
on the western outskirts, reportedly
were driving a salient to within a
mile and a half of Puerto del Sol,
the center of the city.
General Franco's immediate
purpose appears ot be one of ex
tending his "starvation grip" on
the beleaguered metropolis, and
thus to force General Miaia, "the
defender of Madrid," to bring up
reinforcements from the already
divided Loyalist east coast.
Loyalists, who at least have press
agents, described the day's events in
Madrid as "insignificant and not ex
ceeding normal."

From Washington the news was
that President Roosevelt may retain
the undivided profits tax in the new
revenue bill at the cost of sharp re
ductions in capital gains levies.
In Congress opponents of the
$4,512,000,000 recovery program
opened their attack, with Rep.
John Taber (R.. N.Y.), charging
that the plan "unquestionably will
result in inflation."
Federal subsidies to the railroad
industry "are out the window,"
Chairman Burton K. Wheeler (D.,

press for emergency legislation at
this session.
