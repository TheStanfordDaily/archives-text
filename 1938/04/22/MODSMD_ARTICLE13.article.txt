SHANGHAI, April 21 (UP).—
Thousands of Japanese reinforce
ments poured into Shantung prov
ince today for the beginning of what
foreign military observers regarded
as a major push to end the war
without a costly drive on Hankow.
With the collapse of the powerful
Chinese defenses at Linyi and the
recapture by the Japanese of Han
chwang, the Japanese simultaneously
began a drive northward from the
southern Tientsin-Pukow front.
Many observers believed the Jap
anese military authorities had de
cided on an immediate campaign to
take over all of the area along the
Tientsin-Pukow railway and make
no further attempt to advance into
China, which probably would prove
costly in man-power and money.
