# Tracksters Plan To Ambush Bears
## Big Meet Finds Cards Underdogs Templeton Stakes Indians' Chances On Strategic Snitches in Squad 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's Stadium tomorrow will be the scene of the strangest track
and field meet in the history of a rivalry that goes back 15 years.
In that time Stanford and California have met 14 times, but not one
of the previous encounters has packed the suspense and drama that the
1938 resumption of the Big Meet series seems to have in store.

The drama in tomorrow's meet is
merely that it is the Big Meet, where
[he unpredictable always happens.
Cal Strong
The suspense is something more
tangible. It involves two coaches,
Dink Templeton of Stanford and
Brutus Hamilton of California, one
i)f whom has material galore; the
other has the task of juggling a
handful of men to get his victory
margin.

Hamilton is the one with the ma
terial, and yet his position is fai
from secure because on his injury
list is one man who holds the meet
in the palm of his hand, or should
we say on the toes of his Hying feet?
That man is Arnold Nutting, sprint
er and broad jumper.
Two weeks ago. Nutting pulled a
muscle in his leg that put him on
the sidelines. Tomorrow he will run
because he is a senior and this will
be his last Big Meet. But the man
who two weeks ago was almost a
cinch to score at least 11 points mc.y
not even score—or he may come
through and give the Bears the
meet.
May Take Javelin
That's only part of the suspense
from the Bear angle. Doug Lehman
and Bob Law, ace Bear javelin
throwers who Hamilton figures could
take one-two both have sore arms.
Whether their arms are sore
enough to keep them from placing
ahead of Stanford's mediocre George
Shaw and Grant Stone is another
part of the suspense act.
The last doubtful man on the
i Bear ledger is Don Watts, a capable
! 140 man who in shape is practically
j a cinch to nab a second in his event.
| However, an anti-tetanus shot taken
several days ago is liable to keep
him out of the meet.
Dink Worries
But if you were to ask Hamilton
honestly, he would probably tell you
j that his own worries are insignifi
j cant as compared to those of Robert
Lyman Templeton, the "Fox of the
j Farm." Templeton is the one who
has to juggle a handful of brilliant
; individual performers and run men
in two and three events if the In
| dians are to beat their cross-Bay ad
j versaries.
Just how the Dink is going to jug
gle his team is a question that has
kept track fans on edge all week. Ed
j Burrows will run the mile, but the
question is whether he will also run
the two-mile or the 880.
Malott To Be Shifted
Captain Ray Malott is another
question mark. Ray can win his
quarter-mile assignment in a breeze
j and should run one-two with Stan
i Hiserman in the furlong. However,
j Templeton, fighting for every point,
