# Tracksters Plan To Ambush Bears
## Big Meet Finds Cards Underdogs Templeton Stakes Indians' Chances On Strategic Snitches in Squad 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's Stadium tomorrow will be the scene of the strangest track
and field meet in the history of a rivalry that goes back 15 years.
In that time Stanford and California have met 14 times, but not one
of the previous encounters has packed the suspense and drama that the
1938 resumption of the Big Meet series seems to have in store.

The drama in tomorrow's meet is
merely that it is the Big Meet, where
[he unpredictable always happens.
Cal Strong
The suspense is something more
tangible. It involves two coaches,
Dink Templeton of Stanford and
Brutus Hamilton of California, one
i)f whom has material galore; the
other has the task of juggling a
handful of men to get his victory
margin.

Hamilton is the one with the ma
terial, and yet his position is fai
from secure because on his injury
list is one man who holds the meet
in the palm of his hand, or should
we say on the toes of his Hying feet?
That man is Arnold Nutting, sprint
er and broad jumper.
Two weeks ago. Nutting pulled a
muscle in his leg that put him on
the sidelines. Tomorrow he will run
because he is a senior and this will
be his last Big Meet. But the man
who two weeks ago was almost a
cinch to score at least 11 points mc.y
not even score—or he may come
through and give the Bears the
meet.
May Take Javelin
That's only part of the suspense
from the Bear angle. Doug Lehman
and Bob Law, ace Bear javelin
throwers who Hamilton figures could
take one-two both have sore arms.
Whether their arms are sore
enough to keep them from placing
ahead of Stanford's mediocre George
Shaw and Grant Stone is another
part of the suspense act.
The last doubtful man on the
i Bear ledger is Don Watts, a capable
! 140 man who in shape is practically
j a cinch to nab a second in his event.
| However, an anti-tetanus shot taken
several days ago is liable to keep
him out of the meet.
Dink Worries
But if you were to ask Hamilton
honestly, he would probably tell you
j that his own worries are insignifi
j cant as compared to those of Robert
Lyman Templeton, the "Fox of the
j Farm." Templeton is the one who
has to juggle a handful of brilliant
; individual performers and run men
in two and three events if the In
| dians are to beat their cross-Bay ad
j versaries.
Just how the Dink is going to jug
gle his team is a question that has
kept track fans on edge all week. Ed
j Burrows will run the mile, but the
question is whether he will also run
the two-mile or the 880.
Malott To Be Shifted
Captain Ray Malott is another
question mark. Ray can win his
quarter-mile assignment in a breeze
j and should run one-two with Stan
i Hiserman in the furlong. However,
j Templeton, fighting for every point,
may shift him also into a third
race, the 100.
Or the wily Dink may keep Craig
Williamson out of the 440, run Ma
lott in only the 440 and make a stab
at winning the relay. Stanford is
conceded virtually no chance in this
event, but the Cardinals haven't
dropped a baton-passing race to the
Bears since 1922 and Dink is anxious
to keep that record clean.
Stan Hiserman will run the 100-
yard dash and what? Stan isn't
strong enough to triple up in the
220 and low hurdles because the lat
ter two events are run consecutive
ly. The question* is, which race is he
going to run? The concensus of
opinion is that Hiserman can't beat
George Anderson, Bear great, in the
hurdles and he ought to be run in

vhc long sprint.
The juggling ends there, but not
the suspense. Stanford has a num
j her of men who have it in their
I power to cinch—or lose—tomorrow's
I meet.
Ed Burrows is a Card with the
spotlight on him. If Ed should lose
to Cal's Charley Mehlert in the mile,
1 the opening race, Stanford would be
dealt a tremendous blow. It would
! n't be the points he'd lose as much
as the drop in morale of the team.
However, Ed is the original come
through artist and he is primed
for tomorrow.
It is just the other way around in
the broad jump. Cal, with C.uy
; Manuel, who looms a cinch win-
I nei, Rex Heap and George Kido
I could easily nab nine points.
