# War Play Rides New Peace Wave
## 
### 
Hiding the crest of the cur
rent peace wave will be the Di
vision of Speech and Drama's
production of "Johnny John
son," a war satire, to be pre
sented Â«in Memorial Hall on May
6 and 7.
Under the direction of Gor
don C. Lange, "Johnny John
son" will unfold the story of a
natural man in a sick world.
Fourteen scenes will include a
hilltop, an office, a trench, a
graveyard, a hospital, and a
street corner.
Written by Paul Green with
music by Kurt Weill, American
playwright and composer,
"Johnny Johnson" last year
was a Broadway hit produced
by the Group Theater. It won
the Critic's Award and was
named by many as possible Pu
litzer I i ize choice.
