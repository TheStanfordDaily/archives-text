right to intervene in behalf of Brit
ish interests in Mexico.
Following up its original protest

reply thereto with a new note, de
livered by the first secretary of the
British legation. Britain rejected the
government's contention that the
Mexican Eagle Oil Company, "being
a national (Mexican) company, is le

Mexican Eagle Oil, a subsidiary of
Royal Dutch Shell, was incorporated
under the laws of Mexico in 1908. A
