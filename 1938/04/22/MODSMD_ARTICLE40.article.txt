# Sophomore Carnival Scheduled Tonight
## Farm Group Concessions Fill Pavilion Proceeds from Forty Booths To Increase Home Drive Fund 
### 
King Carnival will reign on the
Farm tonight.
Forty concessions will fill the Pa
vilion and the area around it from
7 to 11 o'clock to please the most
discriminating carnival-goer and to
till the coffers of the Convalescent
Home.
Every living group on the campus
is running a booth at the 1938 edi
tion of the fair, which is the first
event on the annual Home Drive.
No cash will be used at the Carnival;
script may be purchased at 10 cents
a ticket.

mates, Sequoia will sponsor a
water-bag concession instead of egg
throwing which proved to be too
dangerous last year.
