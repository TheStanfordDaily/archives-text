# Ghosts Settle In Sequoia Playful Pixies Pound Piano
## 
### BOB CARPENTER 
Sequoia Hall is infested with
ghosts — mysterious creatures tap
ping walls, whispering between
books, playing the lobby piano!
At least that is the opinion of sev
eral inmates of the Barn who de
clare they have ample proof of this
fact.
It started early this quarter with
radiator and pipe tappings, at first
believed to be steam, now accepted
as messages sent from ghost to
ghost. One student has deciphered
their code and revealed intimate se
cret'} of the mysterious ones.
The piano, long an instrument for
modern swing, has turned to sinis
ter melodies. Such music has wak
ened many a Sequoian in the early
hours, who upon glaring down the
hallway has seen no one—although
the music continues unmolested!

Since the Barn Dance two weeks
ago, an increased disturbance has
been noted. Windows have been
broken in greater numbers. Lights
inevitably switch off, with raucous
laughter startling those yet unaccus
tomed to ghost pranks.
Yesterday, two skull and cross
bone insignias were found pinned to
the bulletin board. Rumblings of
pipes and radiators have become
more heated. Code interpretations
reveal that ghosts are unionizing.
Strangely, no Sequoian has yet
moved. Often the ghosts are friend
ly, helping harassed students find
their shoes; aiding with occasional
bits of philosophical wisdom.
Alarm clocks are now in disre
pute. Many a student, has been saved
from tardiness by friendly admoni
tions or gentle shoves.
