# Administration Favors Peace Course Plan
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
Stanford's peace course I
is certainly worth investigation,!
even though there are a lot of bar
riers between it and the Time Sched
ule. This is the opinion of three of
the heads of the University admin
istration.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Dean of Women Mary Yost, and
Dean of Men George B. Culver say
that the idea is "very interesting,"
and that if it is properly organized
the course might meet a pressing
need of education.
Wilbur's Statement
Dr. Wilbur stated that he had not
had time to consider the possibili
ties of establishing the course, but
that it might be worked out if there
is sufficient interest. Its chances of
success, he said, depend on the at
titude of the faculty. If the pro
fessors are interested and would be
willing to take part in teaching,
many of the difficulties would be re
moved.
"An important thing," Dr. Wilbur
said, "would be to see that the
course does not pretend to give all
the answers. It would have to be
cautious, critical, and fair."
He also stressed the amount of
work that would be necessary to or
ganize the course, pointing out that
it would involve study and plan
ning as well as preparation for in
struction.
Benefits Possible
Great benefits might come from
such a course, he said. Properly
taught it would promote a saner
and mora reasonable approach to the
problems of peace. It could serve as

a guide to intelligent work for j
peace.
Miss Yost was enthusiastic. "This
is an excellent thing," she said. "It
would be a course that would in
tegrate and apply information that
specific courses give."
She pointed out that the course
would also help to meet the demand
for general "cultural" courses.
Miss Yost, too, stressed the work
involved in arranging the course.
Interest and enthusiasm would be
needed, she said.
Culver Interested
Dean Culver felt that the course
would be a valuable one.
"There is a tremendous need for
knowledge of facts instead of hys
teria," he said. "The course could
present facts that would be useful
in judging peace movements and
suggestions. The subject of peace
today is one on which any self
appointed oracle can speak whether
he knows anything about it or not.
And most of the people don't know
enough about it to contradict him."
The three administrators agreed
that the proposed course would have
to be approached cautiously and ex
perimentally. Its chances of success
would depend largely on the inter
est displayed by faculty and stu
dents. Organizational difficulties
might prevent its establishment. But
if it could be given, it would carry
great benefits.
The West Indies are the highest
points on a great submarine ridge
that is all that remains of a land
that has vanished.

cautious, critical, and fair."
He also stressed the amount of
work that would be necessary to or
ganize the course, pointing out that
it would involve study and plan
ning as well as preparation for in
struction.
Benefits Possible
Great benefits might come from
such a course, he said. Properly
taught it would promote a saner
and mora reasonable approach to the
problems of peace. It could serve as

a guide to intelligent work for j
peace.
Miss Yost was enthusiastic. "This
is an excellent thing," she said. "It
would be a course that would in
tegrate and apply information that
specific courses give."
She pointed out that the course
would also help to meet the demand
for general "cultural" courses.
Miss Yost, too, stressed the work
involved in arranging the course.
Interest and enthusiasm would be
needed, she said.
Culver Interested
Dean Culver felt that the course
would be a valuable one.
"There is a tremendous need for
knowledge of facts instead of hys
teria," he said. "The course could
present facts that would be useful
in judging peace movements and
suggestions. The subject of peace
today is one on which any self
appointed oracle can speak whether
he knows anything about it or not.
And most of the people don't know
enough about it to contradict him."
The three administrators agreed
that the proposed course would have
to be approached cautiously and ex
perimentally. Its chances of success
would depend largely on the inter
est displayed by faculty and stu
dents. Organizational difficulties
might prevent its establishment. But
if it could be given, it would carry
great benefits.
The West Indies are the highest
points on a great submarine ridge
that is all that remains of a land
that has vanished.
Stanford's peace course I
is certainly worth investigation,!
even though there are a lot of bar
riers between it and the Time Sched
ule. This is the opinion of three of
the heads of the University admin
istration.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Dean of Women Mary Yost, and
Dean of Men George B. Culver say
that the idea is "very interesting,"
and that if it is properly organized
the course might meet a pressing
need of education.
Wilbur's Statement
Dr. Wilbur stated that he had not
had time to consider the possibili
ties of establishing the course, but
that it might be worked out if there
is sufficient interest. Its chances of
success, he said, depend on the at
titude of the faculty. If the pro
fessors are interested and would be
willing to take part in teaching,
many of the difficulties would be re
moved.
"An important thing," Dr. Wilbur
said, "would be to see that the
course does not pretend to give all
the answers. It would have to be
cautious, critical, and fair."
He also stressed the amount of
work that would be necessary to or
ganize the course, pointing out that
it would involve study and plan
ning as well as preparation for in
struction.
