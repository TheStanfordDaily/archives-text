SAN FRANCISCO, April 21 (UP).
! â€” Almon E. Roth, president of the
j Pacific Coast Waterfront Employers
i Association and former Stanford
University Comptroller, said today
the association was considering
closing the port of Tacoma, Wash.,
unless American Federation of La
i bor longshoremen go through Sail
ors Union of the Pacific picket lines
j and handle cargo for the Shepard
Line freighter Timber Rush.
Roth called the entire coast asso
| ciation into a meeting here at 3 p.m.
| while port employers met at Se
j attle.
It was to be decided whether to
! suspend the contract with Tacoma
| longshoremen and close the port un
; less they handle the cargo, he said,
j The Timber Rush has been tied
; up at Tacoma since last week. Sail
j ors picketed it because it was man
| ned by National Maritime Union
I seamen.
