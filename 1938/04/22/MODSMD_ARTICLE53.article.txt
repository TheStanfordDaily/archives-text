# Cardinal Nine To Meet Bears Tomorrow
## Series Deadlock To Be Broken 
### 
With their 1938 series all tied up
at one game apiece, Stanford and
California varsity baseball teams
will clash tomorrow at 3:30 o'clock
on the Sunken Diamond in the third
and deciding tilt of their annual Big
Games.
Playing heads-up defensive ball
behind the steady pitching of Al
Lazzarone and coming through in
the pinches with their stick-work,
the Indians took the lead in the se
ries by copping the opening tilt, 6-3.
Card Errors
In the second game, the Cards
went to the opposite extreme. They
committed seven errors in the field
and collected a mere two hits from
the offerings of Bill Priest to boot
their way to a 12-1 trouncing the
hands of the Bears, tieing the count
at one game apiece.
If Stanford should win tomorrow,
it would mark the first time in seven
years that the Indians have taken a
series from California.
Last Game of Season
Tomorrow the Cards ring down the
curtain on their 1938 conference
season. Their record has not been
impressive. They have won five
games and dropped nine to land in
fifth place in the standings.
A victory won't mean a thing
either way as far as their C.1.8.A.
record goes, but a win will bring to
an end seven successive series that
they have lost to their rivals from
Berkeley.
Cal Needs Win
California, on the other hand,
needs a victory tomorrow to cinch
its second straight C.1.8.A. cham
pionship. Leading the loop at pres
ent by two games, the Bears could
clinch the pennant with a win,
while a set-back would place U.S.C.
and St. Mary's in threatening posi
tions.
The two teams will open with the

same nines that started the last
game. A1 Lazzarone on the mound
and Bill Jameson behind the plate
are Harry Wolter's choices for bat
tery mates, and for California it
will be Bill Priest and Tony Lom
bards
