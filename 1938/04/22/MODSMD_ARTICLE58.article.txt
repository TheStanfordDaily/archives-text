# Frosh Trackmen Face Cal Cubs Today
## Farm Squad Given Slight Hope for Win Cub Team Strongest In Recent Years; Hayes Set for Win 
### 
Conceded only the slightest chance
jof winning, Coach Bill Ellington's
J Stanlord freshman track team trav
j els to Edwards Field in Berkeley
j today to meet the strongest Califor
nia Bearcub outfit in recent years.
J The meet will start at 3:15 o'clock.
| With a team of less than 30, Stan
| ford's chief handicap today will be
lack of depth. Coach A1 Ragan at
1 Cal has a frosh cinderpath squad of
i9O men. However, the handful of
j brilliant individual performers on
the Papoose team figure to keep the
i score within respectable bounds.
Card Prospects
I Sid Hayes, newly elected captain
| of the Cards, and one of the great
est hurdle prospects ever to run for
! the Farm, will be leveling for the
I "Little Big Meet" records in the
| high and low hurdles. Sam Klop-
I stock, former Stanford ace, holds
j both marks at 15 flat and 24.5, re
j spectively.
Bob Downey, who hasn't bowed to
anyone except Hayes this season.
| will make his most threatening bid
! in the low hurdles.
Alan Grey, giant shot-putter, will
j be a heavy favorite today. Grey has
heaved the iron pellet over 48 feet
j already this season and might get
' clo'se to 50 with Art Fraisse of the
j Cubs pushing him.
Lincoln Favored
Jim Lincoln, high jumper,
; has ascended 6 feet 4 inches and is
j a slight favorite over Cal's Mcl Long,
j who handed Russ Wulff of the Stan-
I ford varsity a defeat in the P.A.A.
i indoor meet earlier in the year.
Long has been suffering from a bad
leg. Lewis McKinnon is favored to
annex the broad jump for the El
lington men over the Cubs' weak
crew of jumpers. Other first-place
j possibilities for the Papooses are
I Ernie Clark, who will duel with
i Cal's Hamilton Lowe in the quar
| ter-mile, and Johnny Grant, sprinter.
Bill Bostwick, a game miler who
has trimmed his time down to 4:36,
and Walt McKenzie, who consist
ently pole vaults 12 feet 6 inches,
complete the list of Papoose leaders.
Arrayed against this handful of
| men, Cal will present Luther Nich
j ols, who vaults 13 feet; Barney
I Wolfe, who has tossed the discus 148
j feet; Bob Van Court, who has con
sistently done around 1:59 in the
| 880; Arnold Stamps, 4:23.9 miler, who
jis expected to run the two-mile
today.
