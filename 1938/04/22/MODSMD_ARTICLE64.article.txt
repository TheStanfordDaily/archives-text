# Frosh Nine Set to Meet Bear Cubs
## 
### 
In a last attempt to wrest a vie- !
tory from the Cal frosh nine, the
| Papooses will ride over to Berkeley j
this afternoon to meet the Cubs at I
3:30 o'clock on Edwards Field.
All chances for the first Cal-Card
I dual victory in 11 years went glim
mering last Friday when the Bears
wrecked the "little red roller" by the
lopsided score of 9 to 0. The first i
tilt of the three-game series also '
went to the Cal boys, 8 to 2.
Slated to start on the mound this
; afternoon for the Encina team is'
Captain Monte Pfyl, who played sec
-1 ond base during the first two Cal |
encounters. Coaching strategy moved \
I Pfyl to the mound to see if his side- ,
arm slants can handcuff the Berke- j
ley batters who hit 22 times off 1
Quentin Thompson in two games.
Atkinson to Catch
Herb Atkinson, who caught I
| Thompson in the last tilt, will start j
1 behind the plate. However, if Bill !
; Masters gets into the game, and Bob j
i Grayson gives him a good chance, j
i Paul Fay will go in as his battery |
I mate.
Glenn South, erstwhile fielder,
I turned in a top-notch game at first j
| base against Santa Clara high, Tues- ;
' day, and is rated as a sure starter in j
' this spot. Marty Bains, sub second !
baseman who hit the ball for a
| homer to cinch the Santa Clara win,
; will open at second, while at third
j base Elton Boon will continue his
100 per cent streak as first-string
starter.
Frosh May Win
Somewhat of an upset is the choice
of Bob Ditlevson over Herb Bull at
short. Ditlevson's speed and batting
eye have earned him this berth, as :
Bull has not recovered from a late- 1
season slump.
In the outfield, Grayson places Jim
| McCloud, Thor Peterson, and "Coo- .
tie" Thompson as the opening trio, i
The first two have been first-string- j
ers during the past four or five tilts, |
and "Cootie" is taking over for j
"Cookie" South in hopes that he will
continue his Cal batting spree
against their ace hurler, Mike Koll.
NEW YORK, April 21 (UP).â€”Paul j
Derringer continued his mastery j
over the Cubs by pitching the Reds !
to their first triumph today. He al- j
j lowed only four hits. Ken O'Dea's i
; homer following a walk to Lazzeri \
accounted for the Cubs' only runs, j
1 With the bases loaded in the sev- |
enth McCormick and Lombardi sin- i
i gled off Tex Carleton to account for :
' three runs which broke a 2-2 tie. j
