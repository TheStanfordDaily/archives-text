# Behind the Picture

### 
OVER on a wall in the Men's Faculty Club
is a large, age-browned picture. It is a
photograph taken on the day of a faculty-stu
dent baseball game. Old Doctor Jordan is up to
bat; his stance is perfect. His coat is off, his
sleeves rolled up; he is set to clout the ball out
of the lot.
That is all the photographer caught. But be
hind the picture, Axe Society found an inspira
tion for the student-faculty picnic today. Behind
Doctor Jordan, behind the crouching catcher,
they saw an atmosphere. Perhaps it was only
an atmosphere of things as they were.
But more than that, they saw a picture of
relaxation, of informality, of absorb - the - sun
shine, of climb-out-of-the-rut. They saw a pic
ture of men, separated 364 days of the year by
a grade-book, breaking down the barriers and
laughing.
Perhaps the boys were just being nostalgic
when they saw the picture. But perhaps with
their nostalgia came a glimpse of what "Stan
ford spirit" used to mean.
They saw a flash of the days when the Uni
versity was democratic in practice as well as
theory, when the "hello" tradition was a tradi
tidon, not a paragraph in the frosh handbook.
They remembered the days Professor Hulme
used to tell about when people walked to class,
when football was played for the fun of it, when
students and professors broke down the bars
of age over a cup of coffee, late at night. They
saw a spirit of genuine friendship. They saw
what was meant by the words "Stanford
spirit."
For long years, that spirit has lived only in
the age-browned picture on the' Faculty Club
wall. But this afternoon, it may return for a few
brief hours.
This afternoon, as on that day years ago, a
photographer will take a picture. It may show
two men, laughing, grotesquely hobbling along
in a three-legged race. When you look at the
picture that is all you may see.
But if you look behind the picture, you will
see Doctor Jordan, standing at home plate, ready
to clout the ball out of the lot.
And ho will be smiling.â€”J. S.
