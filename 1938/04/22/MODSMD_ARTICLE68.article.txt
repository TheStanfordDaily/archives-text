# Godfathers for Peace

IN the last few days proposals for a peace
course at Stanford have begun to look less
like intellectual ectoplasm and more like a pros
pective blessed event for the Announcement
of Courses.
The Student-Faculty Relations Committee is
out with an Ex Committee search warrant, track
ing elusive ways and means to their lairs. Pres
ident Wilbur, Miss Yost, and Mr. Culver have
shown interest.
General opinion, filtered and distilled, seems
to be that it would be a lot of work to organize
the course, but that it could be extremely valu
able. At the moment it looks as though the
career of the course will depend on whether or
not the faculty likes its looks. If the professors
are antagonistic, it will be exiled to that corner
of the ether reserved for dreams that blew a
fuse.
But if the professors like it, and are willing to
help in organizing and teaching it, the course
will be launched on a Horatio Alger career just
like the office boy who wins the president's
daughter.
The help of the faculty is essential. The pro
fessors will have to teach the course. If they
feel that it isn't worth the time and worry, it is
best put back on the shelf. For the course taught
by a disinterested professor would be worse
than nothing.
But if the faculty is willing to pitch for us, we
can make something out of the proposal that
will help to fill up one of those ragged holes
in our educational system.
It will bo n lot of work No one denies that.

! It wouldn't be worth anything if we didn't put
a lot of work into it. But everything else that
has any value takes a lot of work. The question
is whether or not the results would be worth
the effort.
That's the question the faculty will have to
decide. We are asking a favor of them, and we
can't bludgeon them into it. But we can't see
liow anyone couid think that a course that
! would help to clear up the problem of peace
| wouldn't be worth the effort.
And so we bring forth our little protege. And
; we hope the faculty will like his looks. He
I needs a good fairy godfather.â€”J. C.
