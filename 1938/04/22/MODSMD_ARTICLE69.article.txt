# After This, the Deluge
## 
### 
ONE day out of the year, and one day only,
the editor of The Daily can sneer at the
people who waylay him on the Quad and keep
his telephone hot with complaints about the
notice that didn't get in, what that edit meant,
why was the time of our meeting wrong, and
why didn't you spell my name right.
One day of the year, the frosh put the paper
out, and the editor disclaims all responsibility.
The day is Sunday and I'm going picnicking.
