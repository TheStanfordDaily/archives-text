# BULL SESSION
## THE 						CARNIVAL KID 
### 
VkT/HEN I almost literally ran into Emery Bellwether
up on the lake yesterday afternoon, it was the first
time I had seen him since the peoplq gave him their
smashing mandate to stay home and shut up; and the
fact that I came close to scuttling him did nothing to in
crease the cordiality of his greeting.
"Will you look out!" he said. "I'm not here to swim.
I'm trying to study, if you'll only stop playing battle
ship."
"I'm sorry," I said. "Don't tell me you're actually
reading a Daily?
"I said I was studying, didn't I? I've just been
counting up the number of things I'm going to win at
the Soph Carnival."
"Oh, yes. Winning things again. I seem to remem
ber—"
"Never mind what you remember. I can see myself
already, loaded down with kewpie-dolls, or whatever
it is our charity-mad concessionaires are going to give
walknig out of the Pavilion in triumph like some con
quering Roman Emperor, happy in the knowledge
that I have given my all for Stanford's annual extrava
ganza of paternalism and good will "
"Yes, Bellwether, yes. Calm down. You sound as
though you don't think the Carnival is such a good
idea."
"I'd like to know where you get that impression.
I most certainly do. Soph Carnival, Water Carnival,
Bean Day—the whole kit and kaboodle are worth any
body's money. Those kids out there need help to be
healthy; it's the least we can do to get in and pitch
for them once a year. Give a day of sunshine, you
know."
"Yes, I know. I'm afriad you're a sentimentalist at
heart. So you're going to clean out the sophomores,
hm?"
"That's no word for it. That Pavilion will look as
though it had strayed through Spain by the time I
get through with it. As a destructive force, Hitler will
have nothing on me. Not a prize will remain un
claimed by E. Bellwether, whether it be won by throw
ing darts at cigarettes—a prospect which frankly stumps
me a little; throwing eggs at the Sequoia boys—some
thing I can understand a little better; sitting in with Ihe
swing band—l play a mean brass lampshade; or weight
guessing, or duck-ringing, or anyone of the many, many
ways of wasting time and spilling sunshine we are
going to be offered."
"Well, Emery," I said, "I hope you're not being too
much of an optimist."
"Don't worry. No one has a keener eye or a dead
lier aim than Bellwether. The champion of champions,
the ace of aces, ihe envy of all, and the life of Ihe
party, that's mo. And now I think I'll go in. It's begin
ning to get a little chilly. I'd advise you to give some
sort of warning after this when you want to ram some
one. This business of sinking without warning may be
fun, but it wouldn't stand in international law."
And he began to paddle slowly toward the Boat
house, obviously sure of where he wanted to go, but
having some difficulty in imparting the knowledge to
his canoe.

"Don't worry. No one has a keener eye or a dead
lier aim than Bellwether. The champion of champions,
the ace of aces, ihe envy of all, and the life of Ihe
party, that's mo. And now I think I'll go in. It's begin
ning to get a little chilly. I'd advise you to give some
sort of warning after this when you want to ram some
one. This business of sinking without warning may be
fun, but it wouldn't stand in international law."
And he began to paddle slowly toward the Boat
house, obviously sure of where he wanted to go, but
having some difficulty in imparting the knowledge to
his canoe.

VkT/HEN I almost literally ran into Emery Bellwether
up on the lake yesterday afternoon, it was the first
time I had seen him since the peoplq gave him their
smashing mandate to stay home and shut up; and the
fact that I came close to scuttling him did nothing to in
crease the cordiality of his greeting.
"Will you look out!" he said. "I'm not here to swim.
I'm trying to study, if you'll only stop playing battle
ship."
"I'm sorry," I said. "Don't tell me you're actually
reading a Daily?
"I said I was studying, didn't I? I've just been
counting up the number of things I'm going to win at
the Soph Carnival."
"Oh, yes. Winning things again. I seem to remem
ber—"
"Never mind what you remember. I can see myself
already, loaded down with kewpie-dolls, or whatever
it is our charity-mad concessionaires are going to give
walknig out of the Pavilion in triumph like some con
quering Roman Emperor, happy in the knowledge
that I have given my all for Stanford's annual extrava
ganza of paternalism and good will "
"Yes, Bellwether, yes. Calm down. You sound as
though you don't think the Carnival is such a good
idea."
"I'd like to know where you get that impression.
I most certainly do. Soph Carnival, Water Carnival,
Bean Day—the whole kit and kaboodle are worth any
body's money. Those kids out there need help to be
healthy; it's the least we can do to get in and pitch
for them once a year. Give a day of sunshine, you
know."
"Yes, I know. I'm afriad you're a sentimentalist at
heart. So you're going to clean out the sophomores,
hm?"
"That's no word for it. That Pavilion will look as
though it had strayed through Spain by the time I
get through with it. As a destructive force, Hitler will
have nothing on me. Not a prize will remain un
claimed by E. Bellwether, whether it be won by throw
ing darts at cigarettes—a prospect which frankly stumps
me a little; throwing eggs at the Sequoia boys—some
thing I can understand a little better; sitting in with Ihe
swing band—l play a mean brass lampshade; or weight
guessing, or duck-ringing, or anyone of the many, many
ways of wasting time and spilling sunshine we are
going to be offered."
"Well, Emery," I said, "I hope you're not being too
much of an optimist."
"Don't worry. No one has a keener eye or a dead
lier aim than Bellwether. The champion of champions,
the ace of aces, ihe envy of all, and the life of Ihe
