(The Daily Cnlifornian's editor, awhile hack, read
his exchanges, and had the following few things to say
about students and war.)
' J 'HE Duke Chronicle, newspaper of Duke University,
has just revealed results of a survey of student atti
tudes towards war and international relations with
the following results:
I—Duke students will refuse to fight or support a
war abroad. They voted six to one on this issue.
2—They are not sure as to whether students should
support an "international decency" program by en
gaging in boycotts and economic measures. Voting
was evenly divided.
•» —They agreed, by a two to one majority, that
American isolationism is impossible.
This poll, taken from a student body of exceptionally
high income attending an aristocratic and heavily en
dowed Southern university, should represent the opin
ions of a very conservative portion of U. S. college
students.
• * * »
of RO.T.C. and the pro-military por
k tion of our daily press may well wonder <it the strik
ing similarity of pacifistic opinionexpressed in this poll
when compared with R O.T.C. polls taken by The Cali
fornian and the A.S.U.C. at various times.
Does the Duke questionaire, demonstrating as it
does that Duke men and women would refuse to fight
or support a war abroad, indicate that those students
are "dangerous Communists" or that "subversive influ
ences" have undermined their morale?
Or does the questionaire indicate that college stu
dents realize the futility, uselessness, and horror of war
and are determined to keep their country at peace?
The Duke poll showed what college students think
of war. The California!! poll on R.O.T.C. showed what
students think of war preparation.
No. American college students aren't "going soft."
They're just Incoming sensilile
