## WELL, YES

The Editor, Sir:
No sane person wants war. The
abolition of war is the world's most
urgent problem — but Stanford stu
dents are not going to solve the prob
lem by printing full page editorials
in the Chaparral nor by building
memorials to the future war dead
nor by holding peace day meetings.
The next war will start in Eu
rope, and it will be difficult to drag
the American people into it. Euro
pean nations are completely mili
tarized—they have no peace propa
ganda. We are not a militaristic
people, and we have all the paci
fists. Europe is full of dynamite, and
the United States is full of self
styled fire extinguishers.
I have a more practical plan for
permanent world peace. Build up
our army and navy second to none.
Let Europe go to war, and when
European nations are exhausted and
tottering, send in our forces. Having
conquered the world we can pro
ceed to disband every army, sink
every warship, scrap every rifle and
artillery piece, destroy every fort
and burn every military textbook—
except our own. We can reduce out
own forces to the minimum required
for the preservation of world peace.
We can support our forces by taxing
the world—and that tax you can be
sure would be one-tenth of what the
people of the world are paying to
day to support military establish
ments in every country.
Having established peace in the
world—peace by force — we could
freeze the boundaries of the world
and let every country rule itself as
it saw fit.
I honestly believe we will come to
this—and if we don't do it Russia
will. Therefore, every piece of paci
fist propaganda issued in the United
States is a blow at our opportunity
to insure lasting world peace. Since
our peace boys are disturbed most
by the loss of human life in modern
warfare — may I suggest that they
could more profitably invest their
time in writing editorials about auto
deaths, erecting monuments to fu
ture victims of careless drivers, and
holding safety meetings. After all,
many more Americans have been
killed by automobiles than were
killed during the World War—and I
believe they could get as much pub
licity as they now get out of the
peace drive.
