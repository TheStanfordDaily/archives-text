I "'The Goldwyn Follies," currently
playing at the Fox-Stanford
When Producer Oliver Merlin
| (Adolphe Menjou) eavesdrops on
| the comment of a country girl (An
drea Leeds), he learns that movies
J are "not true to life." Struck with

the profundity of
this observation,
he whisks her off
forthwith to Hol
lywood, dubs her
"Miss Humanity,"
and cloisters her
from the shams of
Ihe City. Thence
forth, "Miss Hu
manity" sits in
judgment on the

productions of Oliver Merlin. Her
advice, not particularly intelligent
in the first place, is blithely disre
garded in the second, serving merely
; as a pivot on which to spin a series
of unrelated musicomedy features.
We have it on pretty good author
j ity that the speculation on life and
art in "The Goldwyn Follies" airs
i the producer's own viewpoint—that
Oliver Merlin is Goldwyn himself.
| But whether or not Mr. Goldwyn's
i artistic catechisms are canceled by
the Cash gospel ho follows, this set
j up itself looks a genesis in the void
: after the usual backstage formula
for musicals. And beyond the origi
nality of theme, the acts themselves
; represent a gilt-edge investment for
Mr. Goldwyn.
Besides the Metropolitan Ballet,
he has recruited Vera Zorina, who
I dances with the suppleness of suede
and the creamy, resistless grace of
| perfect control.
Helen Jepson, Charlie McCarthy
! and stooge, Kenny and Phil Baker,
and the Ritz Brothers complete the
; worthy aggregate.
Of these, only the last - named
| founder, proving that their particu
lar brand of apoplectic action palls
with overplay. However, like a
centipede with water on one knee,
; the picture still has ninety-nine legs
j to stand on.
