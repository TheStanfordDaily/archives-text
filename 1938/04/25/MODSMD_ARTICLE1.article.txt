JJECENT newspaper reports from
Europe have indicated that the
international crisis caused by Hit
ler's seizure of Austria has passed,
at least temporarily. Yesterday the
focus of the world's attention again
dwelled on Europe. From Rome
came further hopes that peace ef
forts by the leading powers would
culminate in something definitely |
constructive within the next few
days. But from Carlsbad, Czecho
slovakia another scare was cast over
Europe when Hitler's leader of some
3,500,000 Sudetan Germans, Konrad
Henlein demanded in a speech that ,
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy as j
regards Germany be revised im
mediately.
Ever since the Peace treaty of
1919, and especially since the rise of
Hitler of Germany, European diplo
mats have had cause to worry about
the status of the peoples who were
denied self - determination. The
plight of the Sudetan Germans was
a particularly difficult one, for a
natural barrier in the form of high
mountains exists between them and
greater Germany.
With lienlein's defiant remarks
coming only several days after a
visit with Hitler, many feared that
Czechoslovakia was in danger of
undergoing the same fate that
Austria suffered weeks ago.
The entire European situation
again seemingly might rest in the
hands of Hitler, for in Rome Musso
lini was reported to have informed
British Diplomat Leslie Hore-
Belisha of his desire that Hitler be
invited to take part in the current
discussion of European problems
that is going on between Britain and
Italy.
During the conference, favorable
reports have been issued concerning
discussion of the situation in Spain
and the League of Nations. The
tension in Europe has been lessened
considerably by the Anglo-Italian
pact of friendship and the proposed
ltalo-French pact.

/ OPPOSITION to President Roose
velt's new pump-priming plan
increased over the weekend with
condemnation of the spending pro
gram coming mostly from anti-New
Deal members of Congress. A mi
nority report from Republican mem
bers of the Senate Unemployment
Committee demanded that the Ad
ministration stop making "extrava
gant utterances, in which whole
classes of people are insulted and
nameless individuals lambasted over
the radio ..."
This statement is believed to have
been directed at the President's fre
quent allusions to the "selfish few"
whom he has condemned but has
failed to identify with any specific
group.
Other suggestions offered by
minority leaders included a gen
eral tax reduction wherever at all
possible, an unemployment census
as a basis of treatment of wage
and hour questions, and reorgani
zation of the relief and unemploy
ment agencies.
While in this country the pump
priming program drew no more than
cxpected criticism, in London Sir
George Paish, noted economist and
wartime adviser to the Lloyd
George cabinet, said that this same
pump-priming program would save
the world temporarily from almost
complete collapse. His reputation
gained through making such pre
dictions as the crash of 1929 and the
bank failures that followed, Sir
George said the releasing of the
enormous sum of frozen gold assets
would aid recovery tremendously.

In Spain the Insurgent forces con
tinued along the Mediterranean
coast to within a little more than 20
miles of the important seaport of
Castellon. General reports indicated
that the Loyalist government would
be able to resist no longer than
through the summer.
