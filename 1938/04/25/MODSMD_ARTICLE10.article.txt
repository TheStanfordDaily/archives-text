# Burnt, 'Beebs' Triumph In Three-Legged Race
## 
### 
With baseball, volleyball, horseshoes, and a three-legged race absorb
ing their afternoon, Stanford's faculty and students got together for their
first field day last Friday on intramural field and found each other to be
pretty good guys after all.
Three baseball games playing at once, in different parts of the field,

created plenty ot excitement as nrsn
a professor would prove his super- J
ior wisdom, and then a student j
would put one over on the profes- j
sor. News of the games' progres- j
sions was relayed via automobile to j
J. P. Cahn, announcer and master of |
ceremonies for the event, who then j
broadcast it to the crowd.
Wilbur Makes Ringer
A stir was created when Farm j
dignitaries, President Ray Lyman |
Wilbur. Acting Comptroller J. Hugh |
Jackson, and Dean George B. Culver !
appeared on the scene and President
Wilbur announced his readiness for
a game of horseshoes. While stu
dents, faculty members, and photog
raphers gathered around, Dr. Wilbur j
proceeded to prove his prowess by j
making his first shot a ringer.
Probably most hilarious of all the
events was the three-legged race in
which about. 15 student-professor
units traversed the ground in record
time with Coach John Bunn and
"Beebs" Lee putting their leg over
first. Awards presented by Dr. Wil
bur were medals of sufficient size
to please even the most vainglori
ous. Other judges were Dean Cul
ver and Dean Jackson.
Picnic Dinner Served
Faculty wives found diversion in
playing volleyball, ping-pong, and
in cheering their hubbies.
