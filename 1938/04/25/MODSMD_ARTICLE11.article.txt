# SNAKES GET HOSPITAL
## 
### 
BOMBAY (UP). â€” A "nursing
home" for snakes, the first of its
kind in India, is being prepared by
the Haffkine Institute here. The idea
is to keep snakes in a healthy condi
tion so that the venom extracted from
them in the institute's laboratories
may retain its power.
