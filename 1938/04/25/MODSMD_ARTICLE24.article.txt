# Bear Trackmen Defeat Indians
## Burrows Breaks Two Record Captain Malott Double Winner 
### 
A fighting ( alitornia track team that made its own breaks won the
Big Meet, 75-56 from Stanford last Saturday in the local Stadium..
Stanford s track.-ters fought their hearts out and need not be ashamed
of their 1!)-point defeat, because before they went down l>efore the gold
and blue horde, the Cardinals had the Bears biting their finger nails.

1 Towering even in defeat was C.
Edson Burrows of Seattle, Washing
ton, a lanky red-head whom you
perhaps have heard of slightly. Mr.
Burrows all by himself accounted
for 10 points and two new meet rec
ords, and besides committed the un
pardonable sin of running Cal's Mr.
Stan Sadaj into the ground in both
races.
Catches Sadaj
The ungracious Mr. Burrows
started the last lap of the mile a
good 10 yards behind Sadaj and it
didn't seem possible for him to catch
the tiny Bear star. But he did, and
with plenty to spare. His tremen
dous strides gobbling up ground
yards at a time, Burrows passed
Sadaj about 50 yards from the finish
tape and won going away. The
time of 4:17.9 broke a record that
had stood for 24 years. The old mark
of 4:20.2 was established by Stan
ford's Skin Wilson in 1914.
The thrill-packed two-mile was
almost a repetition of the mile. For
live laps Ed hung back in the pack
while Ted Vollmer and Frank Law
rence of California wore each other
out fighting for the lead. At the
start of the sixth lap Ed started
moving up and Sadaj started moving
back.
Same Position
As the eighth and final lap tsarted,
Burrows was in the same position as
he had been in the mile, 10 yards
beh i n d Lawrence. Sadaj had
dropped out. Again it seemed im
possible for Burrows to make up the
deficit, especially because Law
rence was fresh and running his
first race of the day. But again he
did the impossible, catching Law
rence as they straightened out in
the sprint for the tape.
Burrows' time was 9:37.2, which
clipped a full second off the old
mark made in 1928 by Hank Coe of
Stanford and tied in 1931 by Spud
Mossman of Cal.
Malott Wins Two
Captain Ray Malott also wound
up his Big Meet competitive efforts
with a pair of slashing victories.
Captain Ray pranced through the
440 in 48.1 to win as he pleased by
10 yards.
Later in the day, Malott ran a
spectacular 21.4 220 in nosing out
Cal's Arnold Nutting. Nutting held
a wide lead over Malott in the early
i stages of the race, but once the lat
j tor poured on his powerful finish,
Nutting didn't have a chance.
Stanford can boast of three great
come-through performances in the
field events by Stan Andersen, Bill
I Braheny and Vic Boore. Boorc, a
! senior pole vaulter, climbed to the
! highest height in his life when he
J tied for first at 13 feet 6 inches with
j Ray McCarthy and Keith Monroe
of Berkeley.
Andersen Takes Shot
Andersen pushed out the shot 49
I feet 10 7 n inches to take first.. The
I highest place Stan had ever taken
before yesterday was third. Jack
Lipman got the ball out to 49 feet
19% inches to annex second. Tom
| Montgomery, the favorite, was
handicapped by an injured wrist
and failed to place.
Braheny's second place in the
javelin was a major upset in an
event Cal expected to sweep.

A fighting ( alitornia track team that made its own breaks won the
Big Meet, 75-56 from Stanford last Saturday in the local Stadium..
Stanford s track.-ters fought their hearts out and need not be ashamed
of their 1!)-point defeat, because before they went down l>efore the gold
and blue horde, the Cardinals had the Bears biting their finger nails.

1 Towering even in defeat was C.
Edson Burrows of Seattle, Washing
ton, a lanky red-head whom you
perhaps have heard of slightly. Mr.
Burrows all by himself accounted
for 10 points and two new meet rec
ords, and besides committed the un
pardonable sin of running Cal's Mr.
Stan Sadaj into the ground in both
races.
Catches Sadaj
The ungracious Mr. Burrows
started the last lap of the mile a
good 10 yards behind Sadaj and it
didn't seem possible for him to catch
the tiny Bear star. But he did, and
with plenty to spare. His tremen
dous strides gobbling up ground
yards at a time, Burrows passed
Sadaj about 50 yards from the finish
tape and won going away. The
time of 4:17.9 broke a record that
had stood for 24 years. The old mark
of 4:20.2 was established by Stan
ford's Skin Wilson in 1914.
The thrill-packed two-mile was
almost a repetition of the mile. For
live laps Ed hung back in the pack
while Ted Vollmer and Frank Law
rence of California wore each other
out fighting for the lead. At the
start of the sixth lap Ed started
moving up and Sadaj started moving
back.
Same Position
As the eighth and final lap tsarted,
Burrows was in the same position as
he had been in the mile, 10 yards
beh i n d Lawrence. Sadaj had
dropped out. Again it seemed im
possible for Burrows to make up the
deficit, especially because Law
rence was fresh and running his
first race of the day. But again he
did the impossible, catching Law
rence as they straightened out in
the sprint for the tape.
Burrows' time was 9:37.2, which
clipped a full second off the old
mark made in 1928 by Hank Coe of
Stanford and tied in 1931 by Spud
Mossman of Cal.
Malott Wins Two
Captain Ray Malott also wound
up his Big Meet competitive efforts
with a pair of slashing victories.
Captain Ray pranced through the
440 in 48.1 to win as he pleased by
10 yards.
Later in the day, Malott ran a

A fighting ( alitornia track team that made its own breaks won the
Big Meet, 75-56 from Stanford last Saturday in the local Stadium..
Stanford s track.-ters fought their hearts out and need not be ashamed
of their 1!)-point defeat, because before they went down l>efore the gold
and blue horde, the Cardinals had the Bears biting their finger nails.

1 Towering even in defeat was C.
Edson Burrows of Seattle, Washing
ton, a lanky red-head whom you
perhaps have heard of slightly. Mr.
Burrows all by himself accounted
for 10 points and two new meet rec
ords, and besides committed the un
pardonable sin of running Cal's Mr.
Stan Sadaj into the ground in both
races.
Catches Sadaj
The ungracious Mr. Burrows
started the last lap of the mile a
good 10 yards behind Sadaj and it
didn't seem possible for him to catch
the tiny Bear star. But he did, and
with plenty to spare. His tremen
dous strides gobbling up ground
yards at a time, Burrows passed
Sadaj about 50 yards from the finish
tape and won going away. The
time of 4:17.9 broke a record that
had stood for 24 years. The old mark
of 4:20.2 was established by Stan
ford's Skin Wilson in 1914.
The thrill-packed two-mile was
almost a repetition of the mile. For
live laps Ed hung back in the pack
while Ted Vollmer and Frank Law
rence of California wore each other
out fighting for the lead. At the
start of the sixth lap Ed started
moving up and Sadaj started moving
back.
Same Position
As the eighth and final lap tsarted,
Burrows was in the same position as
he had been in the mile, 10 yards
beh i n d Lawrence. Sadaj had
dropped out. Again it seemed im
possible for Burrows to make up the
deficit, especially because Law
rence was fresh and running his
first race of the day. But again he
did the impossible, catching Law
rence as they straightened out in
the sprint for the tape.
Burrows' time was 9:37.2, which
clipped a full second off the old
mark made in 1928 by Hank Coe of
Stanford and tied in 1931 by Spud
Mossman of Cal.
Malott Wins Two
Captain Ray Malott also wound
up his Big Meet competitive efforts
with a pair of slashing victories.
Captain Ray pranced through the
440 in 48.1 to win as he pleased by
10 yards.
Later in the day, Malott ran a
spectacular 21.4 220 in nosing out
Cal's Arnold Nutting. Nutting held
a wide lead over Malott in the early
i stages of the race, but once the lat
j tor poured on his powerful finish,
Nutting didn't have a chance.
Stanford can boast of three great
come-through performances in the
field events by Stan Andersen, Bill
I Braheny and Vic Boore. Boorc, a
! senior pole vaulter, climbed to the
! highest height in his life when he
J tied for first at 13 feet 6 inches with
j Ray McCarthy and Keith Monroe
of Berkeley.
Andersen Takes Shot
Andersen pushed out the shot 49
I feet 10 7 n inches to take first.. The
I highest place Stan had ever taken
before yesterday was third. Jack
Lipman got the ball out to 49 feet
19% inches to annex second. Tom
| Montgomery, the favorite, was
handicapped by an injured wrist
and failed to place.
Braheny's second place in the
javelin was a major upset in an
event Cal expected to sweep.
