# Crowds Jam Concessions At Carnival
## Proceeds Believed Largest in History; Booths Are Popular 
### 
King Carnival reigned wisely and
well Friday night at the Sophomore
Carnival. Althnugh the actual fig
ures will not be available until this
afternoon, the gross proceeds are
thought to be about $1000, which
exceeds last year's amount, Lloyd
Wilson, who is in charge of finances,
said.
The Fiji's used 600 pies in their
booth and ended with about 20 left
over which the irate pledges threw at
the actives. During the evening two
fellows came to take a picture, but
instead of throwing the pie at the
pledge the photographer threw it
at the manager of the booth, and
took out at a run through the crowd.
McCarthy Popular
El Captan's ring-the-duck was an
other of the popular booths, but they
had a hard time keeping supplied
with ducks. Several winners sold
their prizes back to the booth for
small amounts around a dime.
Duck-the-nigger was also well
patronized and the Theta Xi pledges
took a good many duckings in the
cold tank. One of them was so cold
that an active member was forced to
take his place and be ducked.
The Charlie McCarthy booth was
a hard one to win at and one per
son was heard to remark that she
would win or bust. The S.A.E. gold
fish went well but they still had some
of the fish left at closing time.
Balance Needed
El Cuadro's lighting-a-cigarette
while on a barrel tempted many of
the fellows who smoked, but most of
them did not have the intricate bal
ance needed to pick up the match
and cigarette.
Bill Kimball, Encina, and Arthur
Nathen, Toyon, won the two raf
fles with Kimball winning the Phi
Psi flivver and Nathen the Lagunita
radio.
Pink lemonade, candied apples, and
hot dogs were sold by the Dee Gees,
Tri Delts, and the Union, respec
tively. The Alpha Delts hawked the
ice cream and orange juice from a
big brown barrel.
