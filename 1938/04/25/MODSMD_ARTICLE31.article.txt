Applications for the proposed Poli
tical Union have increased to 65 at
the last count Friday afternoon, ac
cording to Gerald Marcus, origina
tor of the plan. The Liberal party

Conservative and Labor parties have
20 and 15 applicants respectively, j
Final date for applications is tomor- j'
row and all those who wish to apply
may do so at the A.S.S.U. office.
Working with Marcus as tentative
leaders are Ed Kerr, Liberal; Dick
Riddell, Conservative; and Mark '
Hopkins, Labor. Also serving upon 1
the committee is Don Crawford. The
four men will act only as temporary
leaders at the first meeting to be

The idea of a Stanford Political
Union was brought back by Marcus
from his contact with the Yale Poli
tical Union in a debate tour during
Winter Quarter. As organized at
Yale, meetings of the Union are held
every two weeks. Floor leaders take
charge of the main part of the debate
with open discussion from the floor
following.
Caucuses of the individual parties
are held before the meetings and it,
is at this time that party actions are
mapped. The Union, as organized at
Yale is housed in a home modeled
after England's Parliament building; |
but for the first periods of Stanford ,
Union's political existence the Little '
Theater or the Women's Clubhouse j
will serve as the meeting place.
Whales are extinct in the waters
surrounding Newfoundland, Green
land, and Spitzbergen, where they
were very numerous at one time.
