# Frosh Bury Axe With Cal In Lake Frolic
## 
### 
Stanford "roughs" of old would
have stuttered and fumed violently
Saturday night hud they been here to
see the tradition-breaking "Frosh
doings" that swept over the campus
from Lagunita Lake, heralded Farm
romance spot, to Enclna, traditional
seat of rabid anti-Cal sentiment. The
most shocking "sight" of all to the
oldsters would have, been that of
i seven hundred rollicking frolickers
from the frosh classes of the Farm
and of Cal stuffing themselves with
food, singing (school songs discour
aged), tipping over canoes, and gen
erally raising cain -on the hay-cov
ered hills above Lagunita. This co
lossus of "scandalous" entertainment
was passed through the Excom un
der the imposing handle, "Annual (?)
Cal-Stanford Freshmen Frolic."
When the last trackster slipped on
his pants in Stadium Saturday af
ternoon and the Big Meet was defi
nitely history, the show was over for
most upper-classmen but for the
1 frosh of both schools it had barely
begun. Festivities got off to a good
j start on the lake at 4:30 o'clock when
j the visitors were given a sample shot
of Stanford's lake-life in boats loan
ed by all living-groups.
Lunches were passed out to the
waiting hundreds by Robleites head
ed by Pat Smith from 5:30 to 6:30
o'clock with "seconds" on hand for
the ambitious until 7 o'clock.
Following a remarkable burst of
song from the well-fed frosh, the
party swung North to Encina where
A1 Sebring's band held forth for four
hours. The Cal-babes swung home
ward by car and special train during
the late hours, some lake-soaked, all
tired, filled to the brim and sputter
ing vague but encouraging promises
about "big soph doings for every
body next year at Cal."
The California delegation was led
by Bob Williams, frosh president, and
included 150 merry-makers. Origi
! nator of the "frolic" idea and gen
eral chairman of all activities was
Art Gore, the Farm's frosh leader.
Minor highlights of the evening's
show included Walt Stoessel and his
Encina chorus in a follies perform
ance in Encina lobby, and some ani
mated song-leading by Jim Far
quharson and Bill Turner on the
lake shore.
