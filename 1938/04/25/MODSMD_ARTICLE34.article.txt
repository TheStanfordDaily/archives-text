Just in case you didn't know what
kind of a guy this Robert Lyman
Templeton is, there is a story about
the Dink that goes back to his col
lage days at Stanford.
Dink, besides being a Farm foot
ball hero and one of the greatest
punters in Coast history, was also a
leading high jumper. He made the
trip back East in 1920 to try out for
the Olympic Games team and was
one of the favorites to represent the
United States at Amsterdam.
However, the officials decided
that his "western roll" style of
jumping was illegal and declared
him ineligible to compete. Dink
was broken-hearted. Downcast, he
walked toward the shower room—
his golden opportunity for fame
shattered.
He passed by the bread jump pit
and suddenly a w;la idea hit him.
He had done some broad jumping
at the Farm but had never excelled
in the event. However, now des
peration added wings to his feet.
He dashed madly down the run
way and catapulted himself out far
enough to take third place and
make the trip to Amsterdam. Of
course, nowadays such a feat would
be impossible, what with so much
red tape attached to a simple little
affair like athletics.
If someone had tried to do the
same thing in 1936 he would have
had to wade through official's, show
Lis birth certificate, and get the
timekeeper a date with his girl
friend's sister.

Dick Toner, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, made out a dope
sheet in last Friday's edition. Every
tl ing was as it should have been
except—he picked Johnny Hewitt
to place in the hurdles. We don't
doubt that Johnny could have
placed, Mr. Toner, if only he was
on the team this year. At that, the
way things turned out in the
hurdles, picking Hewitt wasn't such
a terrible mistake.

Thor Peterson, frosh football ace,
pulled a fast one on the Bearcubs
last Friday at Berkeley. Thor was
scheduled to play ball for the Pa
poose horsehide team and at the
s; me time he was needed on the
track team, which was competing on
an adjacent field.
The baseball game and track meet
were scheduled to start at the same
time, but Thor coaxed a couple of
ollicials out to the broad jump pit
long before the event was scheduled
to start, took four jumps and then
ran over to play nine innings of
basebdi. Incidentally, one of his
leaps carried him out over 22 feet
and gave him first place.
Thor is the only three-sport let
term;.n in the school at the present
time.—Mayer.

track team, which was competing on
an adjacent field.
The baseball game and track meet
were scheduled to start at the same
time, but Thor coaxed a couple of
ollicials out to the broad jump pit
long before the event was scheduled
to start, took four jumps and then
ran over to play nine innings of
basebdi. Incidentally, one of his
leaps carried him out over 22 feet
and gave him first place.

Just in case you didn't know what
kind of a guy this Robert Lyman
Templeton is, there is a story about
the Dink that goes back to his col
lage days at Stanford.
Dink, besides being a Farm foot
ball hero and one of the greatest
punters in Coast history, was also a
leading high jumper. He made the
trip back East in 1920 to try out for
the Olympic Games team and was
one of the favorites to represent the
United States at Amsterdam.
However, the officials decided
that his "western roll" style of
jumping was illegal and declared
him ineligible to compete. Dink
was broken-hearted. Downcast, he
walked toward the shower room—
his golden opportunity for fame
shattered.
He passed by the bread jump pit
and suddenly a w;la idea hit him.
He had done some broad jumping
at the Farm but had never excelled
in the event. However, now des
peration added wings to his feet.
He dashed madly down the run
way and catapulted himself out far
enough to take third place and
make the trip to Amsterdam. Of
course, nowadays such a feat would
be impossible, what with so much
red tape attached to a simple little
affair like athletics.
If someone had tried to do the
same thing in 1936 he would have
had to wade through official's, show
Lis birth certificate, and get the
timekeeper a date with his girl
friend's sister.

Dick Toner, sports editor of the
Daily Californian, made out a dope
sheet in last Friday's edition. Every
tl ing was as it should have been
except—he picked Johnny Hewitt
to place in the hurdles. We don't
doubt that Johnny could have
placed, Mr. Toner, if only he was
on the team this year. At that, the
way things turned out in the
hurdles, picking Hewitt wasn't such
a terrible mistake.

Thor Peterson, frosh football ace,
pulled a fast one on the Bearcubs
last Friday at Berkeley. Thor was
scheduled to play ball for the Pa
poose horsehide team and at the

an adjacent field.
