# Card Golfers Trounce Cal
## Varsity, Freshmen Win 24½ -2½ % 17-10 
### 
California this year boasted one
j of its strongest golf teams in years,
; but it still wasn't strong enough to
beat Stanford's divoteers Friday,
when the Cards trounced the Bears,
24Va to 2 1 u, at Berkeley in the first
Big Match.
Pointing toward participation in
the National Intercollegiates, the
j Indians not only trimmed the Bears,
j but gave old man par a beating too.
I Art Doering and Brown Cannon led
the onslaught on par with a pair of
J 66's. Bill Boyd carded a 67, and
I Jack Wallace went around in a 09
jas the Indians dropped only one
| match out of nine.
Stanford's freshmen also had little
trouble in downing the Bearcubs,
Jl7-10, losing only two matches out
I of nine.
