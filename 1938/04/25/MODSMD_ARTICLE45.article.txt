# You Can't Take It With You
## 
### 
A RATHER ordinary looking freshman with
big ears and a short hair-cut had last quar
ter been invited in for a chat with Miss Fast,
Secretary to the Committee on Independent
Study. She wasn't scolding, she said, but why
hadn't this fellow been getting as good grades
as he did the first quarter.
"Because, Miss Fast," the freshman replied
truthfully, "I'm not taking subjects in which I'm
a little bit interested."
"What are you taking?" astonished Miss Fast
logically asked.
"Oh, biology, French, Western Civ, English
—the regular Lower Division curricula, and it
bores me silly." Miss Fast was shocked and
she made no attempt to hide it. It was easy to
see that she thought the poor freshman was
away off on the wrong foot.
"What does interest you," she inquired po
litely.
"The Daily," was the frosh's enthusiastic re
ply. Miss Fast sent him away, shook her head,
and retained few hopes for the best.
The Daily, the Daily—of all things. Why any
body should choose to slave in a smelly green
shack in place of watching the romance of an
amoeba, or track down nice variable French
verbs through their Latin derivations was
something hard to believe. Maybe this par
ticular freshman was sorta dumb.
He wasn't really, though. He was extraordi
narily normal. He wanted to get an education,
win friends and influence people, and be a
good guy, but studying French verbs or amoe
ba s romances didn't seem to help achieve his
objectives. The Daily did.
Meanwhile the freshman's grades went
down. He learned less and less about Civ and
more and more about the Daily. Miss Fast
disapproved strenuously. She seemed to feel
that it wouldn't be a bad idea just to accept
what the University was offering as best. She
felt that it would be good training to discipline
oneself into studying and working even though
ihere was no interest. But this freshman could
n t swallow that. He was going to discipline
himself against disciplining himself. It was hard
to believe the University, Miss Fast, or Irv
lorgensen, when he wrote in the Frosh Bible,
that Greeks and Romans would someday fit
into the picture with a bang, bang. The Daily
was fitting into the picture now with a bang,
bang, bang.
I hen one day the freshman noticed he was
n t learning as much as he used to at the Daily.
Instead of getting something new he merely
used the old knowledge for repetitious labor. It
became stooge work. New ojcperiences no long
er popped up the way they did at first.
The frosh tried to kid himself into thinking
that he wasn't really lorsing interest in the
Daily. He blamed it on the spring weather, on
himself, and on the business recession. He
was in a rut. The rut wevs deep and narrow, and
even though there no obvious objective
at rut's end to compare with the green pastures
on either side he clung tenaciously to the con
fining groove. He remembered the good old
days 011 the Daily and got nostalgic.
But was this the same freshman who was go
ing to discipline himself against disciplining
himself and stay out of uninspiring, uneduca
tional ruts? Wcis this the same frosh who had
stalked out in the middle of an independent Civ
meeting, Grandpa-Sycamore-fashion, never to
return, because he thought he'd get more out
of section arid found he did?
We re only here four short, expensive years,
and whenever interest palls or inspiration wans
so that things are controlling the individual
instead of vice versa the logical thing to do is
go on to something else we'd get more out of.
I or those who came to Stanford to find some
philosophy suitable to the world at the other
end of Palm Drive, this philosophy sounds okay.
If there s any virtue in this case history of
one particular freshman, it's in the chance that
there are others like him who see trecmendous

possibilities in their college years—who don't
want to waste a minute getting the most out
of them.
The University assumes no responsibility in
interesting people in its subjects or activities.
It leaves it up to a bewildered lot of students
to ferret out the truth for themselves. If they're
going to do this they'll have to overstep con
ventions. Above all else they'll have to keep
free. For when anything—activity, subject, or
pastime—gets to the stage where it's dictating
the student's life, it's time to walk out.
And so the editor of the Daily's Frosh Edi
tion is going to kick over his traces and hereby
tender his resignation as insignificant copy
reader on the regular Daily to take effect after
this issue is put to bed.
He's not quite sure, but he's going to spend
his new-found time learning some Civ, on the
lake, talking to more of his profs, playing with
yo-yos on the Inner Quad, and a hundred other
ways. At any rate, he wants to feel "the winds
of freedom blow."
So long, Lap, it's been fun working for you.
