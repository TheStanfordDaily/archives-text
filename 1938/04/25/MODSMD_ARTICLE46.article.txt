# I'll Say You Can't

THE edit above sounds very pretty and ideal
istic. But it shouldn't be taken too serious
ly. I'm not really going to quit the Daily even
though I'm completely convinced of every word
in that edit.
People don't do that sort of thing, and I won
der why.
Maybe it proves that not only can't you take
it with you, but you can't even have it while
you're here.
