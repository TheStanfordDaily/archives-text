BACK TO THE LAND
I HANDED the mechanic a chcck for my new fender
and dropped a remark about getting rid of the
darned car.
"Nooooo, you don't want to get rid of it," says he,
rubbing his hands together, "Everybody should have
a car!"
I still didn't agree, and when I picked up Allen
Drury's friend, Emery Bellwether, at the railroad
tracks, I mentioned the situation to him. He agreed
with me, and after a long chat we came to the con
clusion that not only would I be better off without a
car—but so would the whole campus.
What real need is there for a car on the Farm?
Such is the Farm's unique compactness, that no two
parts of the campus proper should be over 15 minutes
of easy walking apart.
Ah, then you'll be late for class? You'll be later by
lingering that extra minute over a cup of coffee and
depending on a last-minute dash by car, than if you
were prodded to a timely start by the prospect of a
walk; and for health, walking is—well, just ask any
doctor!
Stanford's mythical blue-book seemingly defines a
date as an evening off the Farm. Net x-esult: Farm en
tertainments -of the past several years have taken some
beautiful financial flops. But still the Farm migrates
to the cities, the mountains, and the ocean in its Cadil
lacs, LaSalles, and weatherbeaten hacks, leaving Farm
activities to go down for the third time. Incidentally,
the chipmonks, sparrows, and Phi Betes are nesting
very comfortably, thank you, in our own campus hot
spot—The Nitery.
Even v.'ithout cars, Stanford wouid find ways to
amuse it.^aelf; and a car-less campus social life would
be a big move toward overcoming the "rich" man
"poor" man stigma. Moreover, bringing campus life
back to the campus would mean a more thorough uni
fication of living groups through exchange of enter
tainments. Entertainment in general would get away
from its "social gradations"; and many (may we call
them hypocrites) would not be ashamed to admit that
a coke at the Cellar is a close runner-up for a Daiquiri
at the Mark.
Of course, depriving the campus of cars would be
detrimental to learnin'; for one could no longer go far
back into the hills to study. But there is always the
Quad. —Park Kimball.
