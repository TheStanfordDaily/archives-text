Every spring American students start talking about
making trips to Europe during the summer vacation.
Because most of us know so little about the costs and
arrangements for these trips, few of us ever reach
Europe.
This year The Open Road is again conducting num
erous tours abroad for college students. Sponsored by
the A.S.U. and other college organizations, The Open
Road really succeeds in giving the student a good time
as well as a tremendously valuable trip.

Almost anyone can afford to make one of the trips,
and they're certainly worth more than a summer loaf
ing on the beach.
For instance, you can leave New York late in June
with a bunch of other college kids and make a bicycle
tour of England and Wales that won't cost you much
more than the cost of a quarter at college.

Other trips arc more extensive but all are carefully
planned to give you something worthwhile. The Road
is a non-profit organization, headed by an advisory
board of which President Wilbur is a member, and it
can secure better itineraries for less money than almost
any ordinary travel bureau.
When traveling in Russia or Sweden, for example
two countries experimenting with radically different
governments and social setups—The Road provides
numerous opportunities to sec at first hand just what
is going on. Discussions for the specific purpose of
explaining the various systems are arranged with stu
dents and officials of the various countries.
And, incidentally, with all the peace and war talk
buzzing around the campus, it's not a bad idea getting
to know and to like some of the people whom we may
be told to hate tomorrow. Here's something construc
tive for all the peace committees to work on.
