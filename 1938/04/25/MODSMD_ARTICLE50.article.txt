# 'Tom Sawyer' Shows Two Coming Stars
## 
### 
In David O. Selznick's screen
version of "Tom Sawyer," now ap
pearing at the United Artists Theater
in San Francisco and scheduled soon
for a run at the Fox-Stanford, two

actors make a de
but that foreshad
ows stardom for
both. Tommy
Kelly's perform
ance as Tom and
Anne Gillis' Becky
Thatcher are ren
ditions worthy of
many a now-fam
ous trooper. The
two appear to best

advantage in the cave scene, whore
young Kelly displays a well-panto
mimed reaction to the dangers of
Injun Jim, and Anne Gillis hajidles
a supporting role superbly.
Technicolor Good
The technicolor photography adds
strength and vivacity to the plot set
ting and to James Wong Howe, a
newcomer to the technicolor ranks,
much credit must go as chief pho
tographer. Norman Tarog's crisp
ness of direction and his ability in
handling these screen newcomers is
clearly evident throughout and a real
feather in his directing bonnet.
Slight choppiness is the single
cirticism that may be aimed at "Tom
Sawyer." Unevenness and a slight
tendency toward wandering on the
part of those who handled the cut
ting is barely evident throughout the
sequence.
May Robson's Role
May Robson's appearing in her
first large role since her perform
ance in "Night Must Fall," proves a
superb Aunt Polly. Raging like a
tempest when Tom misbehaves, she
turns in a rendition of pathos as he
prodigally returns from the dead,
which tops by far the most capable
among the supporting roles.
Huck Finn appears a trifle 100
dainty in his handling of the "Peck's
Bad Boy" role but this is eclipsed by
the remaining supporting roles with
David Holt as Tom's brother Sid,
Walter Brennan as the weakling
Muff Potter, Marcia Mae Jones as
Mary Sawyer, Donald Meek as the
Sunday school teacher, and Mickey
Rentschler as Joe Harper.
All who have read Mark Twain's
beloved child-saga of life along the
Mississippi in the 1840's will find this
lovable screen version well worth
attending. —Perry
The largest forest in Europe is
said to be the great forest at Bialo
wieza, in Poland, where the trees
cover 2G0.000 acres.

Slight choppiness is the single
cirticism that may be aimed at "Tom
Sawyer." Unevenness and a slight
tendency toward wandering on the
part of those who handled the cut
ting is barely evident throughout the
sequence.
May Robson's Role
May Robson's appearing in her
first large role since her perform
ance in "Night Must Fall," proves a
superb Aunt Polly. Raging like a
tempest when Tom misbehaves, she
turns in a rendition of pathos as he
prodigally returns from the dead,
which tops by far the most capable
among the supporting roles.
Huck Finn appears a trifle 100
dainty in his handling of the "Peck's
Bad Boy" role but this is eclipsed by
the remaining supporting roles with
David Holt as Tom's brother Sid,
Walter Brennan as the weakling
Muff Potter, Marcia Mae Jones as
Mary Sawyer, Donald Meek as the
Sunday school teacher, and Mickey
Rentschler as Joe Harper.
All who have read Mark Twain's
beloved child-saga of life along the
Mississippi in the 1840's will find this
lovable screen version well worth
attending. —Perry

Thumbs Up
In David O. Selznick's screen
version of "Tom Sawyer," now ap
pearing at the United Artists Theater
in San Francisco and scheduled soon
for a run at the Fox-Stanford, two

actors make a de
but that foreshad
ows stardom for
both. Tommy
Kelly's perform
ance as Tom and
Anne Gillis' Becky
Thatcher are ren
ditions worthy of
many a now-fam
ous trooper. The
two appear to best

advantage in the cave scene, whore
young Kelly displays a well-panto
mimed reaction to the dangers of
Injun Jim, and Anne Gillis hajidles
a supporting role superbly.
Technicolor Good
The technicolor photography adds
strength and vivacity to the plot set
ting and to James Wong Howe, a
newcomer to the technicolor ranks,
much credit must go as chief pho
tographer. Norman Tarog's crisp
ness of direction and his ability in
handling these screen newcomers is
clearly evident throughout and a real
feather in his directing bonnet.
