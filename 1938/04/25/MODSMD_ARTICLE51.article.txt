## FROSH FROLIC 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Having always in my own mind
classified those who write letters to
the editor as belonging to one of two
groups, either mere publicity seek
ers, or those sincere in recommenda
tion or eulogy, I wish to make my
initial appearance in your columns
as a member of the latter category.
It's all about the Frosh Frolic
field last Saturday afternoon and
evening here on the Stanford campus.
When the idea was first introduced
in an Encina Council meeting, there
was some opposition to the plan; but
before the Council adjourned, a joint
frolic for Cal and Farm frosh had
been labeled as a great idea.
Then the real action started.
Art Gore, who was determined to
make the freshman class presidency
into something more than an hon
orary office, went to work on our
campus. Previously he had been in
touch with Bob Williams, Cal Frosh
president, about a get-together, and
he had found Bob in a very recep
tive frame of mind.
After fellows like Bob Low, Walt
Stoessel, and Sherm Mellinkoff went
to work, the Frolic was practically a
success. 1 think, as every person I
have talked to does, that this prece
dent-setting Frolic is tops to date as
a social function for the Class of '41.
Here's to bigger and better (if it's
possible) frolics for future fresh
men.
Sincerely,
A. Frosh, Esq.
