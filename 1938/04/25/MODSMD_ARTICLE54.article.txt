# Lawyers Pitch Pennies
## 
### GEORGE HISLOP 
"I'll buy from you" is the cry of
the law student between classes as
he pitches pennies at the bottom of
his honored steps. This seems to be
their relaxation from briefs and
cases, and, as they say, a good way
to waste an hour.
The object of the game is to put a
penny as near the back of the first
step as possible, and the proper tech
nique is to bounce it once about
eight inches up on the stone block in
front of the steps. The bounce must
be flat so that the penny lands flat
and doesn't spin or roll off.
The hardest part of the game, they
say, is finding the coppers after they
have thrown them; so when the win
ner shouts, "I'm shy," all the play
ers rush up to help him search.
But usually there is plenty of help
from the ever-present audience.
The pots go as high as 40 cents
when five or six are pitching because
they toss until someone gets a penny
on the lower step, and they may pitch
two or three times each; but gener
ally the pots run from 10 to 25 cents.
The greater the number playing, the
more the fun. However, the most fun
is had when a person who doesn't
know all the rules gets in the game.
Draw your own conclusions; your
Daily reporter found out when he
tried to satisfy his curiosity.
Two things that halt the play are

people seeing an old friend and pick
ing that spot to greet him and a co
ed walking down the law step:-
When the latter happens, they sto|
and clap long and loud.
On Saturday, however, the player
move to the first steps on the othe
side of the gate, where the bounce i
so good that they throw two pen
nies instead of once each time.
