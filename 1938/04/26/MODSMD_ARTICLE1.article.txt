base" of the Federal government,
President Roosevelt yesterday
asked Congress to immediately
enact legislation ending the ex
emption of receivers of federal
and state bond interest and sal
aries from income taxes, while at
the same time he blamed Supreme
Court decisions for creating this
"menace" and "threat" to the na
tion's fiscal system.
In a special message to Congress,
the President declared that under
the sixteenth amendment Congress
has powers to end present tax-ex
emption on government bonds.

drastic revision of foreign policy and
the granting of full autonomy rights
to the Sudeten Germans.

ports from Berlin that Hitler is
prepared to use all his influence
in support of Heinlein's demands.
