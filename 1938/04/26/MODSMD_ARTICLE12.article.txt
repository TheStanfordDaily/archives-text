## 
### 
With nearly 100 applications already in, the deadline for applying for
membership in Stanford Political Union is today, announced Gerald Mar
cus, temporary chairman of the organization.. Applications are on file at
the A.S.S.U. office and will be taken up after today to form the initial
membership of the Union.

> As interesting as the number of
applications to self-appointed or
ganizers Marcus, Dick Riddell, Ed
Kerr, and Mark Hopkins, are the
reasons applicants give for joining
(|ne of the three parties. For in
stance, they reported, one man
.signed up for the liberal party be
cause, "I just love to straddle
fences."
1 Another joined the same party be
cause he was a Democrat.
More Liberals
According to the applications,
there are more liberals on Stanford
campus than either laborites or con
servatives. Many who applied
launched into long dissertations on
the present governmental setup, or
into diatribes against evils of mod
ern society. Others were content,
as was one future conservative, to
say, "I am satisfied with present
conditions," or, like one laborite,
"There are fewer signed up in the
party."
However, the party chairmen
promise a sufficient balance of pow
er to make meetings lively. Main
I business before the house on the
I first meeting Thursday night will
be the adoption of the constitution.
■ It has been drawn up with th 6 Yale
I Union document for a model, with
I minor changes to fit Stanford con
! ditions.
Set
Key committees at the meeting
will also be chosen. Three such
I bodies are integral cogs in the Union
j machine—the Committee on Elec
! tions, which will from time to time
J elect new members; the Standing
Committee, which calls meetings
and proposes debate topics; and the
House Committee which takes care
j of mechanical details connected with
| the meetings.
