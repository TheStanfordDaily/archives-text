# Excom Meets New Members
## Incoming Officers To Attend Sessions 
### 
Newly elected members of Ex
Committee will be expected to at
tend tonight's meeting at 7:15 o'clock,
President Tom Killefer announced
yesterday.
Elections were held earlier this
year so new members would have a
chance to sit in on some of the meet
ings and watch the committee handle
its business from week to week.
Students who will take over Ex
Committee posts next year are H. B.
Lee, Betty Davis, Bob Mangan, John
Partridge, Andy Stojkovieh, Pat
Skinner, Annabelle Clark, and Wil
liam Turner.
It is expected that Harry Maloney,
minor sports director, will attend the
meeting to help in discussion of a re
cent proposal to grant wrestling rec
ognition as a minor sport.
Marvin Larson proposed such a
move at the meeting two weeks ago,
but action was postponed until
members had discussed the question.
When they acted hastily in recogniz
ing skiing last quarter, they found
retraction necessary at the next
meeting.
