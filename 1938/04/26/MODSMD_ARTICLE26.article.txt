# Dean Jackson To Discuss U.S. Business
## 
### 
Dean J. Hugh Jackson will speak
at a meeting of the San Jose Stan
ford Club and the Junior Chamber
oi Commerce at San Jose on the
subject: "What's Ahead for Business
in 19158," in which he will compare
present business conditions to those
of 1932 before the Roosevelt regime.
"In spite of loose opinions to the
contrary," remarked Dean Jackson,
"conditions are not as bad now as
they were then."
"Unemployment, it is true, is as
great as it was at that time (if not
greater), whether one believes the
Roosevelt or the Hoover figures.
But, a consideration of steel opera
tions, prices, and business failures
clearly shows that the country is in
much better shape."
Dean Jackson concluded "Be
cause of public funds which will be
spent during the year, business will
see a reasonable amount of pick-up.
Whether it is to be permanent or
not depends to a great extent upon
the election. If conservatives are in
office, things will progress, but if
extreme New Dealers with social
reform policies are in, there will be
a decided slump."
