# R.O.T.C. Holds Annual Review
## War Maneuvers Held For General Bowley 
### 
"You gentlemen are being trained
as possible future officers in the
United States Army. I hope you will
never be called upon to use this
training in actual war. But in the
event of war, it is of supreme im
portance that our officers are men
of merit and ability, and not political
appointees given 'jobs' as rewards for
campaign soliciting."
With these words and praise for
their fine showing, Major General
Albert J. Bowley, speaking before
the R.O.T.C. regiment at the Polo
Field, brought the Stanford Reserve
Corps' 18th annual Field Day Re
view to a close.
Coming to attention at. 2:30 o'clock,
the Battalion marched in military
formation across the grass field in a
series of battery movements, cli
maxed by a parade review before
General Bowley in which the one
mounted Field Artillery battery and
three dismounted batteries passed at
parade dress, while the band played
the Field Artillery March.
One of the features of the review
was the simulation of actual fire by
the third Field Artillery Battery.
With four gun sections participating,
this event proved one of the most
impressive of the day.
R.O.T.C. students Cameron Hall,
commander of the battalion, Franklin
Linsay, Robert H. Garretson, Spen
cer Lehman, John C. Scales, and
Hampton Poole were decorated dur
ing the review by General Bowley
for outstanding work in the depart
ment.
