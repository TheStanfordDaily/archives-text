# Hula Leads Over Swing in Islands
## 
### 
In Hawaii the men students a
well as the women learn to do the
hula as part of their social training,
according to Art Chun, ex-student
body president of the University of
Hawaii, wfio will lead the Hawaiian
Hulapale Troupe to entertain at the
International Festival and Luncheon
tomorrow in the Union Court.
Just as American youths aspire to
master the technique of ball room
dancing, so Hawaiian students, na
tive and American, are trained early
to play stringed Hawaiian instru
ments. sing native ballads, and sway
to island dances, notably the hula.
The Hawaiian Hulapale Troupe,
organized by Arthur Chun, a grad
uate student here and a native
islander, is composed of Stanford

students who have lived in Hawaii
most of their lives. Freddie Vitou
sek, Letitia Fleming. Edith Erwin
and Margaret Greenwell, who will
dance tomorrow, have been taught
the hula by authentic teachers.
Wilson Cannon, also a member ol
the troupe, represented Hawaii at
the National Boy Scout Jamboree in
Washington last year, playing with a
group of islanders before President
and Mrs. Roosevelt and taking part
in ten radio broadcasts.
Included among the numbers t<
be presented at the Festival tomor
row will be "Song of the Islands,'
"Hula Breeze," "Hui-E," and "Little
Brown Girl." Climaxing the program
will be a native Hawaiian song, "Ma
hala Pua," which typifies the island
flower and is semi-operatic in style
