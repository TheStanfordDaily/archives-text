And when he said before the
Big Meet that Burrows could hand
Stan Sadaj a real lacing, and that
Charley Mehlert wouldn't even be
in the race, he was laughed at
again. That continual guffawing
caused him to pull in his horns a
litlle at least, and agree that Har
row.'; couldn't win both Big Meet
distance races.
That was one time when the old
conductor should have gone over
board for fair, in spite of comment.
Burrows not only ran the greatest
pair of distance races on the same
afternoon that the Big Meet has
ever seen, but he did it so decisively
that once again the optimists are
conceding him a grand chance
against the Trojan flyer, Zamperini.
Slants would like to get a little
credit for two solid years of boost
ing one of the greatest competitors
Stanford has ever had.
* * *
Yt/HEN you look back upon Bur
rows' history at Stafford you
get. a little better picture of what
that double victory meant to him.
As a sophomore he ran only the two
mile in the Big Meet, and barely
beat out Chuck Nimmo after the
Chucker had won the mile in a
breeze.
Ed's time for that eight-lapper
was 9:48.3, and while everybody
thought it was fine for Big Ed to
win, he was, after all, supposed to
and it really wasn't much to howl
with glee about.
And then Ed broke that ankle
the next fall, and when spring of
1937 came around he was afraid to
run on it. It plagued him all sea
son. partly because it hurt him
and partly because he couldn't
escape thinking that it was really
going to start hurting again.
Ed took plenty of dirty cracks last
spring about his attitude, and then
he was boobed after the Big Meet
for the stupid way he ran the mile.
With plenty of stuff left, he felt so
good that he stepped out too fast in
the last lap and couldn't hold the
lead he took. The critics didn't look
back and think, "Well, that's the
first time this year he has really
run, and maybe he was a little too
enthusiastic."
They thought he hutched the race
—that's what he did, all right, but
it's a good man that doesn't make
any mistakes, even when he has an
excuse like Burrows had.
The gangling runner who wants
to do something in journalism—
<ind will, too—had his opportunity
<o come hack this year, and make
those critics cat every little prep
osition they uttered. He has done
it, and if he never runs another
race it will he a long time before
Stanford forgets the way he came
Mazing home in that two-mile in
Ihe l!):iS Big Meet.
The teal Stanford people who saw
Ihe race aie going to remember what
he did in that mite, and how their
hearts were beating a little faster
when Ed came from far back to com
plete the rout of the great California
distance corps with that two-mile
victory Peterson.

Yt/HEN you look back upon Bur
rows' history at Stafford you
get. a little better picture of what
that double victory meant to him.
As a sophomore he ran only the two
mile in the Big Meet, and barely
beat out Chuck Nimmo after the
Chucker had won the mile in a
breeze.
Ed's time for that eight-lapper
was 9:48.3, and while everybody
thought it was fine for Big Ed to
win, he was, after all, supposed to
and it really wasn't much to howl
with glee about.
And then Ed broke that ankle
the next fall, and when spring of
1937 came around he was afraid to
run on it. It plagued him all sea
son. partly because it hurt him
and partly because he couldn't
escape thinking that it was really
going to start hurting again.
Ed took plenty of dirty cracks last
spring about his attitude, and then
he was boobed after the Big Meet
for the stupid way he ran the mile.
With plenty of stuff left, he felt so
good that he stepped out too fast in
the last lap and couldn't hold the
lead he took. The critics didn't look
back and think, "Well, that's the
first time this year he has really
run, and maybe he was a little too
enthusiastic."
They thought he hutched the race
—that's what he did, all right, but
it's a good man that doesn't make
any mistakes, even when he has an
excuse like Burrows had.

he was boobed after the Big Meet
for the stupid way he ran the mile.
With plenty of stuff left, he felt so
good that he stepped out too fast in
the last lap and couldn't hold the
lead he took. The critics didn't look
back and think, "Well, that's the
first time this year he has really
run, and maybe he was a little too
enthusiastic."
They thought he hutched the race
—that's what he did, all right, but
it's a good man that doesn't make
any mistakes, even when he has an
excuse like Burrows had.

HPHERE can be no question of the
fact that California did a beauti
ful job Saturday — the Bears had
their day, they had a better team,
and they deserve to be congratu
lated. The Daily looks back upm
that dope sheet that left out all con
sideration of Nutting with regret,
but at the same time it thinks Nut
ting has the good. c ;.
Stanford did fairly well in a lot
of ways, though, and on one aspect
ol Stanford's triumphs Slants is go
nig to grab a little hard-earned sati >-
! act ion.
For two track seasons now the

And when he said before the
Big Meet that Burrows could hand
Stan Sadaj a real lacing, and that
Charley Mehlert wouldn't even be
in the race, he was laughed at
again. That continual guffawing
caused him to pull in his horns a
litlle at least, and agree that Har
row.'; couldn't win both Big Meet
distance races.
That was one time when the old
conductor should have gone over
board for fair, in spite of comment.
Burrows not only ran the greatest
pair of distance races on the same
afternoon that the Big Meet has
ever seen, but he did it so decisively
that once again the optimists are
conceding him a grand chance
against the Trojan flyer, Zamperini.
Slants would like to get a little
credit for two solid years of boost
ing one of the greatest competitors
Stanford has ever had.

Yt/HEN you look back upon Bur
rows' history at Stafford you
get. a little better picture of what
that double victory meant to him.
As a sophomore he ran only the two
mile in the Big Meet, and barely
beat out Chuck Nimmo after the
Chucker had won the mile in a
breeze.
Ed's time for that eight-lapper
was 9:48.3, and while everybody
thought it was fine for Big Ed to
win, he was, after all, supposed to
and it really wasn't much to howl
with glee about.
And then Ed broke that ankle
the next fall, and when spring of
1937 came around he was afraid to
run on it. It plagued him all sea
son. partly because it hurt him
and partly because he couldn't
escape thinking that it was really
going to start hurting again.
Ed took plenty of dirty cracks last
spring about his attitude, and then
he was boobed after the Big Meet
for the stupid way he ran the mile.
With plenty of stuff left, he felt so
good that he stepped out too fast in
the last lap and couldn't hold the
lead he took. The critics didn't look
back and think, "Well, that's the
first time this year he has really
run, and maybe he was a little too
