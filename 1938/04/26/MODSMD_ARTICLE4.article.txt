# Stagers To Read O'Neill Drama
## 
### 
Of interest to lovers of Eugene
O'Neill plays will be the reading of
"Where the Cross Is Made," one of
three one-act readings to be present
ed by Stagers in the Little Theater
next Friday.
With a treasure hunt in the South
Seas and a shipwreck as background
for the play, O'Neill's experience as
a sailor has enabled him to produce
a powerful portrayal of sea life and
adventure. According to critics, his
several sea plays "are rendered with
a lifelikeness and convincing power
never before achieved in American
drama."
O'Neill's adventures as a sailor
took him wandering for several
years around the globe, during
which time he prospected briefly for
gold in Spanish Honduras and acted
as ordinary seaman on a South
African cattle-boat. Among his well
known plays are "Emperor Jones,"
"Anna Christie," "Count of Monte
Cristo," and "Strange Interlude."
