eluding "Cootie" Thompson, Thor |
Peterson, Claude Purkitt, and Glen !
South were mainstays of the year- i
ling grid team last fall, but some of j
them will undoubtedly stay out of j
varsity competition. Purkitt, a 220-
pound tackle and guard, broke a I
finger a week ago and has been ad
vised against practicing for a month.
South and Peterson, both halfbacks,
are turning out, while Thompson
hasn't yet definitely made up his
mind.
The end of freshman track as
sured Coach Tiny Thornhill of an
option on the services of his boom
ing fullback. Norm Standlee, erst
while shot putter. Varsity track
still has a tight grip on Pete Zagar
and Stan Andersen, last year's first
string tackles, and Johnny Casey,
touted junior college back.
A scrimmage last Friday for the
benefit of a large crowd of alumni
and students saw Bill Willard and
Hamp Pool in action for the first
lime this year. Willard was back at
left end, and Pool warmed up at
right half. Pool, heaviest and fast
est man on the squad, carried the
ball only once on a shovel pass from
Pete Fay, but he showed enough de
ception and broken field shiftiness
to make a 12-yard gain in his initial
effort.
Vassar college was founded in
