# Cal Still Tops C.I.B.A. List; Stanford Fifth
## Trojans May Tit Cal In Series; Cards Take One One Clean Slate 
### 
Although Stanford and California i
wound up their conference baseball
seasons Saturday, there still remain j
three games on the C.1.8.A. schedule
; that may decide the final 1938 stand-
I ings.
At the end of last week's play, j
j California still led the loop with 12
! victories and three defeats. In sec- '
! ond place was U.S.C. with nine wins
and three setbacks. The Trojans,
i however, still have three games to
j play with their cross-town rivals,
the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Trojans May Tie
A clean sweep of the three-game
series would give the Trojans a tie
with Cal for the pennant. One de
ieat would give the Bears undis
j puted possession of the champion
j ship for the second year in a row.

lost two.
To California, Stanford lost its
eighth series in a row. The Indians
looked as though they would break
the Cal jinx this year when they
won the opening tilt, 6-3. The Bears
came back, however, and took the
last two, 12-1 and 10-2 to stretch
their streak to eight straight.
SOCCER TEAMS TIE
LOS ANGELES, April 25 (UP).—
The Douglas soccer team of Santa
Monica held the highly regarded
Corinthians of London to a scoreless
tie yesterday at Memorial Coliseum.
The English team pressed the match
and gained most of the scoring
chances, but the Americans held dog
gedly. The game ended in a heavy
downpour.
Although Stanford and California i
wound up their conference baseball
seasons Saturday, there still remain j
three games on the C.1.8.A. schedule
; that may decide the final 1938 stand-
I ings.
At the end of last week's play, j
j California still led the loop with 12
! victories and three defeats. In sec- '
! ond place was U.S.C. with nine wins
and three setbacks. The Trojans,
i however, still have three games to
j play with their cross-town rivals,
the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Trojans May Tie
A clean sweep of the three-game
series would give the Trojans a tie
with Cal for the pennant. One de
ieat would give the Bears undis
j puted possession of the champion
j ship for the second year in a row.
