# TULARE LEVEE BREAKS
## 
### 
FRESNO, April 25 (UP). â€”Water
today was pouring through a break
in the Tulare Lake levee over 3500
acres of cultivated farm land in the
Tulare Lake bottom west of Han
ford. The levee gave way last night
beneath the pounding of waves
whipped up by u week-end wind
and rain storm.
