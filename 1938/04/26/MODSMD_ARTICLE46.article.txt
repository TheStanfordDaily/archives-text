# In the Name of Spirit

### 
DINK TEMPLETON, the old master of applied
psychology, took a little workout last week.
His aim apparently was to put Stanford in the
underdog position for the Big Meet, a position
justified by later events.
His methods, on the other hand, would be
hard to justify by anybody's ethics book.
Stanford was going to lose the track meet,
Dink moaned to the city papers, because:
1. Hank Luisetti had decided to have fun in
his last quarter, when he could have earned the
winning points in the high jump.
2. Edson Burrows had decided to study jour
nalism in San Francisco two days a week, when
he should be working out, getting himself in
shape to earn the points to win the meet.
3. Gamier and Rasmussen, and a lot of other
fellows were apparently under the Luisetti in
fluence and weren't going to win the points.
Worse than that, they were going to graduate
rather than come back for football next year.
If I understand Dink correctly, these meas
ures were necessary because the "old Stan
ford spirit" is a thing of the past. The love of
competition, the desire to excel was dying,
and since student opinion no longer was suffi
ciently harsh to coerce athletes to compete,
more general public opinion should be tried.
I'll grant Dink his point that school spirit is
dying, though I wonder if spirit isn't one of
those things that ain't as good as they was
and never were. I have a suspicion Dink's sort
of spirit is something most people acquire in
their alumni years and apply to their under
graduate memories.
But I wonder if Dink's own attitude isn't a
contributing factor to the decline of this price
less possession. Putting these men in an un
favorable light to a large section of the public
hardly does Stanford any good, is hardly an
example of loyalty to Stanford worthy of emu
lation.
And I wonder if the athletic scholarships
might not have something to do with the situa
tion. Not just one coach, but also a large sec
tion of the athletic minded public seems to
think the boys should give full value received
in return for tuition.
On the other hand, you can hardly blame the
athletes with proficiency in several sports for
thinking that they should get off as easily as
the man who is a specialist. And certainly you
can't say that Luisetti hasn't given value re
ceived for his 5345 a year.
But these scholarships, which seem to go
on a more matter-of-fact, business-like plane
every year, may be only a symptom of the de
cline which I grant Dink. Perhaps the hand
has been overplayed, and the fierce competi
tion for players is killing athletics. Perhaps, in
the future, intercollegiate sports will be left to
the smaller and nouveau riche among the col
leges.
And if that decline is in progress, Dink's
methods aren't going to stop it.
