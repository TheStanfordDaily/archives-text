# Another Card Stunt
## 
### 
ORGANIZATION of the activities card file is
nearly finished. Student government has
a new gadget; committee chairmen have a new
toy; Axe Society, guardian of the file, has a
new job. Everybody seems very happy.
Designed to provide guick and impartial in
formation on applicants for committee work, the
file starts its career with an assortment of
blessings that would buck up any fairy story
hero setting out to seek his fortune. Ex Com
mittee praises it; Axe Society has sworn to
cherish and protect it.
But it will take more than blessings to make
the new syste ma success. If it is to be any
thing more than an expensive plaything, the
file must be used by committee heads.
The system is designed to assist student lead
ers in choosing their helpers. That means that
unless it is used it will become a useless ex
pense item in the A.S.S.U. budget. It wouldn't
be the first time Stanford let a good idea die
guietly in a corner for lack of attention.
If committee heads don't use the file, it will
gather dust unobtrusively. Axe Society will
brood over it, and touch up its cross index, and
wonder why it doesn't work. And committees
will still be picked with all the justice of a
slot machine and the efficiency of a sewing
circle.- J. C.
