TWENTY-EIGHT years ago, a lecture series
was started at Stanford in memory of a stu
dent who died before completing his education
here. Today, that memorial bears fruit in the
three-day series of lectures by Dr. James Row
land Angell, president emeritus of Yale.
He has come at a time when Stanford is more
concerned with Peace Day, Convalescent Home
Drive, and Spring than with a lecture. But when
accounts are totalled up, his contributions to
the quarter will amount —in relative intellectual
values—to no insignificant sum.
Stanford should not feel obliged to break a
canoeing date to hear Dr. Angell just because
the new system a success. If it is to be any
should it necessarily crowd the hall merely to
take in a bout with philosophy.
But Stanford should take the opportunity to
enrich its experience by contact with its most
distinguished visitor this year. Culturally
speaking, such contacts are a necessary part of
the full life. Educationally speaking, they are
a good deal more important than a Western
Civ lecture.
And, in the bargain, a good deal pleasanter.
