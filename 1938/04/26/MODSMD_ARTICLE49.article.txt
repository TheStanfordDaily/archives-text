THE CAR QUESTION
WHEN I read in the Frosh Edition yesterday that
Bellwether had gone on record as favoring a car
less campus, I was rather startled. Knowing his aver
sion to the sort of social attitude which the Cord com
plex is fostering, I knew he did not favor over-large or
over-expensive cars; but I did not think he would go
quite so far as to advocate the complete abandonment
of all vehicular traffic.
I asked him about this yesterday afternoon when he
dropped into the Shack for one of his frequent visits.
"I see we've taken up the back-to-nature move
ment," I said, pointing to the paper.
"Oh, that," he said. "I thought that'd catch your
eye. Yes, I decided I'd be iconoclastic for the day and
kick over the traces. My natural agreeability, plus a
slight bitterness at not winning the Phi Psi flivver—l
didn't, you know—"
"Yes," I said, "I know. So you decided you'd say
you favored no cars at all on the campus?"
"Well, more or less. There are times when they're
annoying; and also rather useless. And then too, I'm
only being consistent when I uphold the proposal, be
cause nothing would destroy the Cord complex more
completely, or solve the problem of the ride-to-Paly
more neatly. If there were no cars, there would ob
viously be no obligation to pick people up, because
there wouldn't be any place to put them if you did.
It's all rather logical."
"It sounds it, all right. I thought Kimball's point
that cars serve to increase the rich man-poor man
stigma was a good one."
"So did I, if there is any stigma—which I doubt—
and if they are used as indices of social position. As
useful conveyances, they have a very definite place,
particularly in relation to the City. Leave out the
hotels and the hot-spots, there are still plenty of things
which cannot possibly be equalled on-campus, and in
that regard cars are a necessity few would criticize.
It is only when they begin to be used as a means of
asserting papa's pocketbook that they enter the realm
of inexcusable extravagance. This is a tendency which
is unfortunately growing, and anything which tries to
discourage it deserves every credit."
"And you don't think there is anything to the plea
that a lack of cars would concentrate social life on the
campus?"
"I do, certainly. But until the entertainment on the
campus equals that in the City, I fear me it's only
wishful thinking to talk about it. The Nitery in par
ticular—although I realize its decline and fall is due
chiefly to the attitude of the Administration—is a
good case in point."
"Then you really favor cars on the campus after
all?"
"As a matter of fact," he said, "I really don't give
a darn."—Allen Drury.

I asked him about this yesterday afternoon when he
dropped into the Shack for one of his frequent visits.
"I see we've taken up the back-to-nature move
ment," I said, pointing to the paper.
"Oh, that," he said. "I thought that'd catch your
eye. Yes, I decided I'd be iconoclastic for the day and
kick over the traces. My natural agreeability, plus a
slight bitterness at not winning the Phi Psi flivver—l
didn't, you know—"
"Yes," I said, "I know. So you decided you'd say
you favored no cars at all on the campus?"
"Well, more or less. There are times when they're
annoying; and also rather useless. And then too, I'm
only being consistent when I uphold the proposal, be
cause nothing would destroy the Cord complex more
completely, or solve the problem of the ride-to-Paly
more neatly. If there were no cars, there would ob
viously be no obligation to pick people up, because
there wouldn't be any place to put them if you did.
It's all rather logical."
"It sounds it, all right. I thought Kimball's point
that cars serve to increase the rich man-poor man
stigma was a good one."
"So did I, if there is any stigma—which I doubt—
and if they are used as indices of social position. As
useful conveyances, they have a very definite place,
particularly in relation to the City. Leave out the
hotels and the hot-spots, there are still plenty of things
which cannot possibly be equalled on-campus, and in
that regard cars are a necessity few would criticize.
It is only when they begin to be used as a means of
asserting papa's pocketbook that they enter the realm
of inexcusable extravagance. This is a tendency which
is unfortunately growing, and anything which tries to
discourage it deserves every credit."
"And you don't think there is anything to the plea
that a lack of cars would concentrate social life on the
campus?"
"I do, certainly. But until the entertainment on the
campus equals that in the City, I fear me it's only
wishful thinking to talk about it. The Nitery in par
ticular—although I realize its decline and fall is due
chiefly to the attitude of the Administration—is a
good case in point."
"Then you really favor cars on the campus after
all?"
"As a matter of fact," he said, "I really don't give
a darn."—Allen Drury.
THE CAR QUESTION
WHEN I read in the Frosh Edition yesterday that
Bellwether had gone on record as favoring a car
less campus, I was rather startled. Knowing his aver
sion to the sort of social attitude which the Cord com
plex is fostering, I knew he did not favor over-large or
over-expensive cars; but I did not think he would go
quite so far as to advocate the complete abandonment
of all vehicular traffic.
