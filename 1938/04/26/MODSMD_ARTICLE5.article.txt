# Bradbury Speaks On Radio Hour
## 
### 
"Exploring the Upper Atmo
sphere" was the subject of the Stan
ford University Radio Hour program
I yesterday evening over KGO. Dr.
j N. E. Bradbury, associate professor
I of physics, was the speaker.
"Most of us take the air which we
I breathe very much for granted. Yet
! ihe atmosphere above our earth has
j by no means the same balmy char
acteristics which we commonly as
sociate with springtime in Califor
ria," said Dr. Bradbury. "As we
take our departure from the earth,
j the first things to impress us will
| be the fall in temperature and the
! decrease in air pressure."
| As a means of exploration, Dr.
j Bradbury described an imaginary
I trip to the upper air. "At about
|35,000 feet, the temperature will
cense to drop and our thermometer
will indicate almost 80 degrees be
low zero. And 30 miles above the
I earth the temperature rises to zero."
