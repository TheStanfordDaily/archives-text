ll EV now, with spring fever churning through our
veins, Messrs. A1 G. Barnes, and Selis-Floto gi
gantic five-ring circus today comes at just about the
right time. How it docs take us back to our youth.
We remember, as who doesn't, how we waited al
most breathlessly days before the circus for the an
nouncement from the powers that be that school would
be dismissed early for the afternoon show. And there
is something about the smell of a circus that brings
back the early morning treks down to the tracks, to
watch them unload. And then the march over to the
Old Community Center playgrounds, where they used
to have the show. We never got tired of watching
them drive stakes. There is something about the
mathematical precision of a half-dozen men swinging
mauls in timed succession that can't be beat.
And then the show itself, of course. Our favorite
item on the program was the great opening pageant.
In former years, it used to be a presentation of the stir
ring love affair of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith,
with a great war dance of the Indians to cap the drama.
I think now. though, they have gone in for oriental
stuff—sort of Marco Polo glorified. We also went big
for the bucking automobile that the clowns drove
around.

As "'e remember, A1 G. Barnes used to have a
specialty of fine horse acts—dancing, and that sort of
thing. And Sclls-Floto has. or used to have, one of the
best aggregations of animals in the business. Depres
sion years hit the sawdust trails as hard as the rest of
the entertainment business, and they had to get rid of
some of their animals. Besides, they never quite re
covered from a disastrous fire in their winter quarters
in Indiana.

But, after all, a circus is a circus. If you can stand
those narrow boards they make you sit on, and can
enter into the spirit of it all. it's Rood stuff. Person
ally. however, circuses have left us a little cold in past
years. This is a sign of something, but we are not
quite sure what. Probably that circuses, in past years,
have left us a little cold.
Or maybe it's just that after three years of our
own Stanford five-ringer, enough i.« enough.—St«>ne.

ll EV now, with spring fever churning through our
veins, Messrs. A1 G. Barnes, and Selis-Floto gi
gantic five-ring circus today comes at just about the
right time. How it docs take us back to our youth.
We remember, as who doesn't, how we waited al
most breathlessly days before the circus for the an
nouncement from the powers that be that school would
be dismissed early for the afternoon show. And there
is something about the smell of a circus that brings
back the early morning treks down to the tracks, to
watch them unload. And then the march over to the
Old Community Center playgrounds, where they used
to have the show. We never got tired of watching
them drive stakes. There is something about the
mathematical precision of a half-dozen men swinging
mauls in timed succession that can't be beat.
And then the show itself, of course. Our favorite
item on the program was the great opening pageant.
In former years, it used to be a presentation of the stir
ring love affair of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith,
with a great war dance of the Indians to cap the drama.
I think now. though, they have gone in for oriental
stuff—sort of Marco Polo glorified. We also went big
for the bucking automobile that the clowns drove
around.

As "'e remember, A1 G. Barnes used to have a
specialty of fine horse acts—dancing, and that sort of
thing. And Sclls-Floto has. or used to have, one of the
best aggregations of animals in the business. Depres
sion years hit the sawdust trails as hard as the rest of
the entertainment business, and they had to get rid of
some of their animals. Besides, they never quite re
covered from a disastrous fire in their winter quarters
in Indiana.

But, after all, a circus is a circus. If you can stand
those narrow boards they make you sit on, and can
enter into the spirit of it all. it's Rood stuff. Person
ally. however, circuses have left us a little cold in past
years. This is a sign of something, but we are not
quite sure what. Probably that circuses, in past years,
have left us a little cold.
Or maybe it's just that after three years of our
own Stanford five-ringer, enough i.« enough.—St«>ne.
