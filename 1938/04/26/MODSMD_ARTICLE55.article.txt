Tau Beta Pi is a national col
lege honorary technical fraternity,
whose object is to mark in a fitting
manner those who have maintained
a high grade of scholarship as un
dergraduates, or distinguished them
selves by their attainments as alum
ni, and to foster a spirit of liberal
culture in the technical and scien
tific schools of America.

Lehigh University in 1855 in order
I to compete with Phi Beta Kappa,
| which left out engineering and simi
i lar studies. To become a member of
| Tau Beta Pi a student must be in
the upper eighth of his engineering
! class as a junior, or in the upper
I fourth as a senior. He also has to
- have certain personal qualifications
and be voted in by the members.
