### 
Twenty-five per cent of the pro- 1
fits of "Johnny Johnson," which

Division of Speech and Drama, will
go to the Convalescent Home Fund, j
Gordon Lange, director of the [
production, announced the plan to I
turn over that share of the profits |
yesterday.
Given a World War setting, "John
ny Johnson" is a brilliant comedy
utilizing much singing, was an out
standing success when presented on <
Broadway by the Group Theater last
season, and was selected for presen
tation here especially because it was \
felt it would appeal particularly to
Stanford students, according to
Lange.
The play won the Critics' Prize last .
year and was mentioned for the [
Pulitzer Prize.
Paul Green, the playwright, is .
best known for "The House of Con- |
nelly," and his folk drama has been
a significant contribution to the
American stage. He now is a pro- j
fessor of philosophy at the Univer
sity of North Carolina, from which
he was graduated in 1921.
Bud Cady will play the title role of
Johnny Johnson, who is described as
"a sane person in an insane world."
An interesting part of the produc
tion will be the inclusion of a scene,
not in the publishing script of the
New York show, which indicates
what a man goes through in drilling.
