# Council Stresses Parking Rules
## 
### 
At yesterday's meeting of Men's
Council, only x-outine traffic cases
were brought before the board. The
single remaining Honor Code viola
tion is still pending and will be
brought before consideration at an
eaily meeting.
Students are asked again by coun
cil to park according to general traf
fic regulations while in front of the
campus post office. Cars are still
being parked on the left hand side
of the street in spite of numerous
council warnings, according to Al
vah Horn, council member.
Those who disregard a summons
to council meetings will have their
fines increased, Horn said. Stu
dents who have been given tickets
for offences should appear before
council during the fo 1 lowing meet
ing. Horn added.
