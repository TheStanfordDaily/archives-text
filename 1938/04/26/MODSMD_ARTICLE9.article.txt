LOS ANGELES, April 25 (UP) â€”
Three pretty Mexican women today
testified against Earle Kynette, sus
pended police captain, and his two
aides, Fred A. Browne and Roy J.
Allen, accused of the Harry J. Ray
mond bombing.
The women definitely placed the
police officers in and about the po
lice "spy house" stringing telephone
wires, boring holes in the house,
and talking over a telephone in the
house which all officers have denied
was there.
