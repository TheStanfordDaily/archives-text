# NEWS IN REVIEW From United Press

### BILL MILLIS 
r rWENTY-FOUR years ago, on an
August bank holiday in 1914,
Britain's Foreign Minister Sir Ed
ward Grey, faced with the collapse
of England's balance-of-power di
plomacy, said that "the lamps are
going out all over Europe. . . I feel
like a man that has wasted his life."
Although the lamps of Europe and
of the world have sputtered fre
quently of late, they have not yet
gone out. Today, for the fifth suc
cessive year, students in universi
ties and high schools throughout
Ihc United States will meet, deter
mined that war shall not waste their
lives, that they shall not become a
new "lost generation."

Abroad the news was of wars
going on and of wars forseen,
with the most important reports
coming from England, which yes
terday was told the price that it
must pay for military prepara
tions to give weight to the Cham
berlain government's diplomacy
of "appeasement."
Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir
John Simon, in introducing to the
House of Commons the nation's
first $5,000,000,000 budget since
1022, told England that it must
pay income tax levies of 27Va per
cent—amounting to $1.37 out of
every $5 earned—in order to meet
a deficit of 8150,000,000 resulting
from Britain's greatest peace-time
armaments campaign.
All told, armaments expenditures
of $1,800,000,000, three times what
was spent in 1934-35, were foreseen
by Simon. Because the budget calls
for higher levies in upper income
brackets and increases in oil, gaso
line. and tea duties, it was criticized
in Parliament as one that would
"soak the middle class."

I>RESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S ap
peal in his most recent radio
"fireside chat" for "a united national
will" to support governmental mea
sures attempting to deal with the
depression appears to be winning
results, with 16 prominent business
men, including Owen D. Young and
Winthrop Aldrich, offering to co
operate with the Administration in
its drive to revive lagging business
and industry.
The President's hopes for a
truce with business will be fur
thered by the relaxation of capi
tal gain levies provided for in the
compromise $5,300,000,000 revenue
bill, which congressional conferees
completed work upon yesterday.
Chairman Pat Harrison (D., Miss.)
of the Senate Finance Committee
predicted that the measure "should
result in the release of billions of
frozen securities to be invested in
private enterprise," but G.O.P. sen
ators said that his revenue provi
sions would not "remotely ap
proach" the funds needed for a "bal
anced budget."

Renewed criticism was directed
against the New Deal yesterday by
ex-President Herbert Hoover, who
said at a Fresno meeting of women
Republicans that the United States
is gripped by a "moral recession"
which he likened to that surrender
of freedom which preceded the rise
of Europe's dictators.
Pointing out that "people speak
less today of the greatness of Ameri
ca," he concluded that "we can fight
for and we can restore the national
morals of hard work, self-reliance,
intellectual and working honesty and
honor. Then the greatness of Amer
ica will shine again."

WAR brings stories of
J "lost divisions." Yesterday such
a report came from Spain, where the
Loyalist forty-third division, which
the Insurgents had claimed to have
exterminated, swept down from the
Pineta valley high in Pyrennes near
Andorra and delivered an apparent
ly successful attack upon the rear on
a Rebel army advancing eastward
along the French border.
Although they are outnumbered
5 to I. the Republican maneuver
has forced the Insurgents to divert
reserve columns and additional
planes from more important fronts.
In the south, Insurgents reported
breaking government lines at three
points near Montalban, threatening
encirclement of 15,000 Loyalists, and
opening the way for the present
drive of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco to cut the railroad and high
way "lifelines" between Valencia
and long-beseigcd Madrid.
