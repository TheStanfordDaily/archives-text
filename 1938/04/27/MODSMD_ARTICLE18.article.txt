# Members To Be Chosen For Political Union
## 
### 
Exceeding what the temporary
: committee claims were their wildest
| hopes, 150 applications were turned
in by the deadline yesterday for
! membership in Stanford Political
i Union.
The organizing committee of Ger
ald Marcus, originator of the idea at
Stanford, Ed Kerr, Dick Riddell, and
Mark Hopkins will consider the ap-
I plications and elect members to the
Union by tomorrow night, the first
meeting. Of the 150 applicants, ap
proximately 125 will be chosen,
Marcus said.
Though potential liberals led the
,lirld for most of the time applica
tions were open, the three parties,
liberal, conservative, and labor stand
; ibout 5-5-4, in that order. The par-
Mies will be led by Kerr. Riddell, and
Hopkins respectively.
The opening meeting of the Union
tomorrow night will be held in
Room 214 at 7:45 o'clock. Only mem
bers who have been notified of their
acceptance through the mails may
vote, but anyone interested may at-
I tend, Milieus stated.
Initial business before the house

will be the adoption of a constitu
tion modeled after that of the Yale
Union. At the same time, a question
for debate will be chosen for the
second meeting. After the brief
business session, the parties will
hold caucuses to nominate mem
bers for three key committees of
the Union. Members so named for
the House, Standing, and Election
Committees will be elected at the
second meting, tentatively called for
May 11.
Inspiration for Stanford's newest
activity was the Oxford Political
Union, which was copied at Yale.
Marcus, touring the country to de
bate, saw the Union in action at
Yale, returned to bring the idea to
realization at Stanford.
Purpose of the Union is to give
training in democratic procedure,
and tp bring the students in im
mediate contact with national and
international affairs.
Although the membership is
closed for the first meeting, those
desirous of joining the Union may
apply through the regular channels
of the Election Committee, after it
hnv been rhnsen Marr'is repor^'-d.
