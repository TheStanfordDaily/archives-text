# Dr. Angell Opens West Memorials
## Yale Speaker Traces Material, Problems Of Modern Person 
### 
Tracing the "thread of ruthless
patriotism that threatens the peace
of the world," Dr. James Rowland
Angell, president emeritus of Yale
University, last night opened the
thirteenth series of the West Memo
rial Lectures.
Specific topic of Dr. Angell's dis
cussion was "The Individual—Mate
rial and Problems."
"Modern man has Cached heights
of mass brutality never approached
by his brute ancestors," he com
mented upon the present status of
the evolutionary development of
man.
Traces Biology of Man
In approaching the understanding
of the emotional expression of mod
ern "showmanistic nationalism," Dr.
Angell turned to the biological his
tory of man and the social develop
ment of the individual in society,
to sketch the background for his
lectures tomorrow and Wednesday
nights.
"The drive of society lies in the
emotional behavior of the indivi
dual," he said, in prefacing his first
consideration.
"What is true of the evolutionary
development of the physical side of
man as to inherent responses, is also
more or less true on the mental and
emotional side."
Tells Social Development
On the subject of social develop
ment, Dr. Angell said, "The stupen
dous geneology of man has left tend
encies to which he must respond."
These responses, however, are not
always recognized as environmental
influences under a society of indi
vidual liberty, he declared.
The main stages of "The Higher
Patriotism," as outlined by Dr. An
gell, include the inspection of the
individual, which he developed last
night; the institutions of society and
how they mold the individual, to be
developed tonight; and the "con
flict of loyalties which issue from
the nature of the individual and the
society in which he lives," on
Thursday night.
"These stages," he said, "are the
moral crises with which our gen
eration is confronted."
Lectures Tonight and Tomorrow
In his next lectures, he will de
velop the latter two points under
the topics of "The Social Order—
Media Through Which Ends Are Re
alized" and "The Realm of Loyalties
—Human and Spiritual."
The series, given in Memorial Hall
at 7:30 o'clock, is presented by the
Committee of Public Exercises
through money provided by the Ray
mond Fred West Memorial Fund and
is open to the general public.

Tells Social Development
On the subject of social develop
ment, Dr. Angell said, "The stupen
dous geneology of man has left tend
encies to which he must respond."
These responses, however, are not
always recognized as environmental
influences under a society of indi
vidual liberty, he declared.
The main stages of "The Higher
Patriotism," as outlined by Dr. An
gell, include the inspection of the
individual, which he developed last
night; the institutions of society and
how they mold the individual, to be
developed tonight; and the "con
flict of loyalties which issue from
the nature of the individual and the
society in which he lives," on
Thursday night.
"These stages," he said, "are the
moral crises with which our gen
eration is confronted."
Lectures Tonight and Tomorrow
In his next lectures, he will de
velop the latter two points under
the topics of "The Social Order—
Media Through Which Ends Are Re
alized" and "The Realm of Loyalties
—Human and Spiritual."
The series, given in Memorial Hall
at 7:30 o'clock, is presented by the
Committee of Public Exercises
through money provided by the Ray
mond Fred West Memorial Fund and
is open to the general public.
Tracing the "thread of ruthless
patriotism that threatens the peace
of the world," Dr. James Rowland
Angell, president emeritus of Yale
University, last night opened the
thirteenth series of the West Memo
rial Lectures.
Specific topic of Dr. Angell's dis
cussion was "The Individual—Mate
rial and Problems."
"Modern man has Cached heights
of mass brutality never approached
by his brute ancestors," he com
mented upon the present status of
the evolutionary development of
man.
Traces Biology of Man
In approaching the understanding
of the emotional expression of mod
ern "showmanistic nationalism," Dr.
Angell turned to the biological his
tory of man and the social develop
ment of the individual in society,
to sketch the background for his
lectures tomorrow and Wednesday
nights.
"The drive of society lies in the
emotional behavior of the indivi
dual," he said, in prefacing his first
consideration.
"What is true of the evolutionary
development of the physical side of
man as to inherent responses, is also
more or less true on the mental and
emotional side."
