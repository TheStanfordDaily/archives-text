# Golfers Practice For Tournament
## 
### 
Preparing for the Northern Cali
fornia Amateur Golf Tournament,
Brown Cannon, Jack Wallace, Bob
Rous, Art Doering, and Dick Wright
played practice rounds at the Pasa
tiempo Golf Course yesterday.
Doering led the golfers with a 71,
two strokes below par. Roos shot a
74, while Wallace. Wright, and Can
non were grouped at 76. These scores
indicate that these varsity men are
in good form for the tournament.
The course, which has long narrow
fairways, offers an excellent test of
golf and is difficult to play.
Coach Eddie Twiggs expects a re
peat of last year's victory when Don
Edwards of the Farm won the tour
ney. The tournament will be held
this week-end at Ihe Pasatiempo
course.
