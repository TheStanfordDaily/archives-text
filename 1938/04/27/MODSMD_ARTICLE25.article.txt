# Wilbur Investigates Peace Course Project
## 
### 
Several of the faculty favor the
idea of a peace course for Stanford,
but it is too early to tell whether or
not the course is possible, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur announced yes
terday.
During the past wee kDr. Wilbur
has talked with a number of pro
fessors about the proposed course in
factors influencing peace and war.
Acting at the request of A.S.S.U.
President Tom Killefer, he has un
dertaken to investigate the possi
bility of establishing the course.
Dr. Wilbur stated that the profes
sors he has seen consider the pro
posal worth complete investigation,
nad would like ot see it adopted if
possible. The great difficulty, he
said would be in finding a man to
take charge of organization and ad
ministration.

lthough the lectures could be
given by a number of different pro
fessors, one man must assume re
sponsibility for organizing the
course. It will be difficult, Dr. Wil
bur stated, to find a man yualified
to manage the project who has the
time to do it.
It is the opinion of the faculty, Dr.
Wilbur said, that it will not be pos
sible to give lectures only. The
course, if it is given, must be backed
by extensive reading. This, profes
sors agree, is the only way to offer
a rounded and critical presentation
of the material.
Dr. Wilbur said that he planned to
continue his convensations with
faculty members, and would be able
to tell more about the chances of
establishing the course when these
talks were completed.
The Student Faculty Relations
Committee, to which consideration
of the course was referred by Ex
Committee, has postponed work on
the matter until Dr. Wilbur has fin
ished his investigation. If he con
siders it feasible, the committee will
confer with faculty members on the
organization of the course.
