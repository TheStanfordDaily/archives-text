# Hoover Attacks Administration
## 
### 
FRESNO, April 27 (UP).—Former
President Herbert Hoover tonight
described the United States as in the
grip of a "moral recession," which,
he said, had been so far as Europe
was concerned the precursor of the
surrender of freedom and the rise
of dictatorships.
With praise for the America that
had been, with fears for the America
of the future unless the course of
her administration is turned, Mr.
Hoover in his speech here deliver
ed the second of his attacks on the
New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt
since his return to California from a
European tour.
Taking as his theme "Morals in
Government," Mr. Hoover outlined
eight principles of government mor
ality and asked in question form
what was going on in the United
! States with respect to them.
In each case he indirectly accused
the government — through its poli
cies, its officials, its boards or through
state and municipal governmental
units—of violating in one or more
I cases the principles he had out
' lined.

The Washington Monument, in
Washington, D.C., is 555 feet high.
