"The system seems to be working
satisfactorily," said Niithen Van Pat
ten. director of University libraries,
yesterday concerning the new
policy of allowing reserved books to
be returned at the Union Cigar
Counter.
He reported that the number of
books returned there had been in
creasing during the four days the
new system has been in operation.
Eighteen boks were turned in at
the counter on Sunday morning.
Only one case of failure to com
ply with the regulations of the sys
tem has occurred, and that "was not
serious," he said.
