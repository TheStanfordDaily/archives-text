r | A HAT mention in Sideline Slants
some time ago about putting
Hank Luisetti's jersey, No. 7, into
the trophy case for ever and ever (
seems to have passed into oblivion, i
but there's nothing like reviving an
old cause, especially when it has such
merits as this one.
Luisetti was for three years with
out an equal in national collegiate ;
basketball. It is more than barely ,
possible that there never was an- j
other like him in any kind of basket- |
ball, college or pro.
lie brought to Stanford Univer
sity as much, if not more, athletic |
fame than any athlete you can
name—and thai includes Big Ben
Lastman, Ernie Nevers, and the
rest of a long line of world cham
pions who performed for Stan
ford.
Nevers, probably the finest full- j
back Stanford ever had, was deemed :
worthy of having his jersey with- [
drawn from competition and placed |
in the trophy case. Since 1925 j
there hasn't been a No. 1 on Stan- I
lord's football teams.
Executive Committee ruled that
the Nevers shirt was never to be
used again at a meeting Tuesday, j
November 24, 1925. Stanford j
really loved Blond Ernie that
year—he brought them the first
victory Stanford had scored over
California in American football in I
21) years, and that meant some- j
thing in the roaring '20's.
Now, here is Luisetti, every bit |
the champion that Nevers was, and j
ncbody wants to make the move that ;
will give him the same honor. Ex j
Committee has the power to fix ;
things up, so why not indicate to I
Hank that all that hand-clapping in
his last games for the old school was !
not just a passing show? If any man j
ever deserved to have his jersey ;
taken out of use, it's Luisetti.

But that isn't all they could do for j
the basketball team. While Luisetti i
was the greatest individual star in
Ihe three-years' play, it will be I
pretty hard for Stanford basketball
fans to forget the rest of the men I
that gave us the Coast Conference
championship for three years run- j
ning. a feat never turned before.
There were six others that de
serve recognition, along with the
master of them all. Dinty Moore,
twi c e captain during Hank's
competition; Howell Turner, great
running-mate to the Italian for
two years; Jack Calderwood and
Art Stoefen, three-year mates with
Hank on the title squad and as
good as Stanford ever had. and
Phil Zonne and 11. B. Lee, great
regulars this past season.
If you'll look back a year you'll
remember seeing in the showcase
of the Union Cellar a bronze plaque
with the names of the Vowing
Sophs, that great football bunch
that took us to the Rose Bowl for
three straight years.
Why can't Ex Committee, which
f ave that plaque to the University
in honor of Grayson, Hamilton,
Alustiza and the boys, give a dupli
cate plaque for the. perpetuation of
the esteem in which we all held the
Crimson Giants, greatest college bas
ketball team the nation has ever
seen? It could, if it would, and it
should.—Peterson.

Slates, Mt. Lassen, will not erupt
