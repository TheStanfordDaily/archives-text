# Getting Outside
## 
### 
STANFORD is holding a curious sort of cele
bration today. It's called Peace Day, but
actual accomplishments which will be made
toward peace seem hardly as important as
other accomplishments the day signalizes.
Stanford, the introverted campus, today will
devote one of its biggest programs of the year
to an international problem, to an intangible
thing. For one day at least we will forget about
our local drives and dances, our dates and
sports, and get outside this articial, four-year
environment which seems so real.
To those who worry about Stanford's soul and
its addiction to seaside fleshpots, this should
make up for other disappointments the day
may hold. For peace is not going to be han
dled too gently tomorrow.
There is going to be factionalism and a great
display of opposing viewpoints. Collective se
curists and isolationists will meet and retire
to their respective camps. There will be no fu
sion of viewpoints into an organized youth
program for peace.
And haunting the whole program will be the
spectre of change. Collective security and iso
lationism may be debated and understood only
to be replaced in the fashions of peace as were
international agreement and disarmament.
Yet while we are learning the prevailing
styles in peace, we may progress a little fur
ther toward an ultimate solution. And most en
couraging of all we will sink our teeth into
one of the world's toughest problems, one that
we ducked nonchalantly until four years ago.
For the day, Stanford will cease to admire it
self in the mirror.
