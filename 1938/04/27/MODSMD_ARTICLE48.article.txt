LAST year, the Row took a look at its grade
point ratio, saw it was a good deal below
that of the campus average, and kicked itself
off the dime with an Interfraternity Council rul
ing. The new regulation, which affected men
only, reguired freshmen to have a C average
before they could be initiated.
Monday, Pan-Hell gave its Row charges a
tentative shove off the coin with a similar rul
ing for the women pledges.
All this is very fine. But it is to be doubted if
it will have very much effect. In spite of In
terfraternity Council's ruling, fraternity ratios
of this and last year vary only a small fraction
of a per cent. And it may be assumed that
such will be the case with the sororities.
Just where the answer lies to the problem
that puts the Row below the grade-point stand
ings of other living groups is debatable. Per
haps the trouble comes because the Row is
made up of that part of the campus which la
bors under the term of "play-boy" (or girl).
Perhaps it is due mostly to the wretched study
conditions that exist in the houses. Perhaps the
added money on the Row pays off in added
flunks.
Qr, perhaps the Row just doesn't care.
Anyhow, Interfraternity Council's swing last
year, and Pan-Hell's this week look a little wide
of the mark. Their measures are doomed from
the start to be characterized as nice gestures
only. But, on the other hand, they will make
the freshmen work a little harder before ini
tiations. Though perhaps only to play a little
more later.—J. S.
