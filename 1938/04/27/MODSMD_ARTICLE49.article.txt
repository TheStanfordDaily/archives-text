# The 						Good Neighbor Policy

### 
Every so often we run into a modern ex
ample of one of the great virtues that our
ancestors used whe.i they were out conquer
ing wildernesses. This time our admiration
goes to the Student-Faculty Relations Commit
tee for demonstrating a perseverance that
would ao credit to the best pioneer who ever
hewed a home out of the wilds.

The Committee has taken over the job of
making navigable streams out of the troubled
waters of student-faculty relations, and for the
past year it has progressed from discourage
ment to more discouragement. Now at last it
has turned up an idea that looks like a success.
The new scheme is to have various living
groups play host at the weekly student-faculty
"bull sessions" in the Nitery. It looks like the
best idea that has come up.
The bull sessions started off laden with faith
and hope. And after a while they faded out
guetly like the last scene of a movie. The pro
fessors complained about publicity — said it
made them feel like freaks. The publicity stop
ped; so did the students. Another hope van
ished.
This didn't mean that Stanford immediately
started on the road to dissolution. Compara
tively speaking our student-faculty relations are
not too bad. We have no guerilla warfare or
sniping from the rooftops. But the failure of
the bull sessions meant that one more of the
few bridges between undergraduates and pro
fessors had collapsed.
With the revived bull sessions the committee
stands a good chance of scoring. When living
groups play host, a certain number of students
are sure to come. Professors no longer will
feel like freaks, because publicity won't have to
play them up. From all angles the plan seems
the best way to get students and faculty to
gether without a desk between them.
It looks like the Committee is getting some
where.—J. C.
