# Students Urged To Order Quads
## 
### 
Students are again urged to order
their 1938 Quads as soon as possible,
according to Editor George McKen
na, who says that sales this year
are ahead of last year.
When the final order for the
printer was sent in winter quarter,
the number of books to be printed
was increased by 15 per cent over
1937. Since then, however, sales
have increased over 30 per cent, and
it is very likely that the Quad will
be sold out at an early date, Mc-
Kenna says.
This week 500 letters have been
sent out to interested alumni who
have asked for an opportunity to
order copies of the 1938 Quad. This
has been done every year, and past
figures show that a large percentage
of the people have written to send in
orders for Quads. At the present time
approximately 70 per cent of the
number of Quads to be sold have
been ordered, leaving only a few
more available.
