# BULL SESSION
## TOT TROT 
### 
of the awesome caverns of some fertile mind
there has recently sprung full-grown the brilliant
idea of turning the Masque Ball into a "Kid Party."
"Trot With the Tots," we are advised with cloying
coyness, and our dreams of romance are rudely shat
tered by visions of the Farm's leading figures, too, too
cute in sun-bonnets and shorts, their pails in one hand,
their sand-shovels in the other, tousled curls a-toss
and knees bared to a juvenile breeze, as they romp in
childish abandon through the intricacies of "Drop the
Handkerchief" and "Run, Sheep, Run."
Somehow, this forbidding prospect does not in
trigue. At any other time, perhaps; but not at the
Masque Ball.
Committee members will assure that "Kid Party" is
"only the theme; it doesn't mean you have to come
dressed as a kid." But upon examination this state
ment becomes rather puzzling, and not very valid.
If no one comes dressed as a kid, then what be
comes of your theme? Do you use kids as decorations,
in that case? Do you display them, skewered on
canoe-paddles, around the walls? Does someone get
up and say, "This is a Kid Party; we are trotting with
the Tots?" Just where and when and why do you
bother to have a "kid theme" if nobody comes dressed
as a kid? Do you have a kid quartet to sing for you?
Will Shirley Temple be the guest of honor?
The thing, you see, has possibilities, all right; but if,
as the committee earnestly assures us, we can still
come dressed as knights of yore and heroes of old, the
"kid theme" becomes even more fascinating in its in
finite ramifications.
Charlemagne at seven, perhaps? Nero just turned
three-and-a-half? Queen Bess in rompers? The Iron
Duke, marbles king of the British Isles? Good Queen
Anne in the middle of the mud-pie stage?
Obviously, the things one can do with a "kid theme"
at the Masque Ball arc endless. Of course it won't be
the old Masq%e Ball of pomp and glamor, the old
Masque Ball which appealed to everyone's secret de
sire to play king, and was therefore one of the most
successful functions of the year. But it will be a "Kid
Party," and we can "Trot with the Tots," so probably
we should stop fussing and join in the fun.
Forward, my jolly juveniles!—Allen Drury.

tered by visions of the Farm's leading figures, too, too
cute in sun-bonnets and shorts, their pails in one hand,
their sand-shovels in the other, tousled curls a-toss
and knees bared to a juvenile breeze, as they romp in
childish abandon through the intricacies of "Drop the
Handkerchief" and "Run, Sheep, Run."
Somehow, this forbidding prospect does not in
trigue. At any other time, perhaps; but not at the
Masque Ball.
Committee members will assure that "Kid Party" is
"only the theme; it doesn't mean you have to come
dressed as a kid." But upon examination this state
ment becomes rather puzzling, and not very valid.
If no one comes dressed as a kid, then what be
comes of your theme? Do you use kids as decorations,
in that case? Do you display them, skewered on
canoe-paddles, around the walls? Does someone get
up and say, "This is a Kid Party; we are trotting with
the Tots?" Just where and when and why do you
bother to have a "kid theme" if nobody comes dressed
as a kid? Do you have a kid quartet to sing for you?
Will Shirley Temple be the guest of honor?
The thing, you see, has possibilities, all right; but if,
as the committee earnestly assures us, we can still
come dressed as knights of yore and heroes of old, the
"kid theme" becomes even more fascinating in its in
finite ramifications.
Charlemagne at seven, perhaps? Nero just turned
three-and-a-half? Queen Bess in rompers? The Iron
Duke, marbles king of the British Isles? Good Queen
Anne in the middle of the mud-pie stage?
Obviously, the things one can do with a "kid theme"
at the Masque Ball arc endless. Of course it won't be
the old Masq%e Ball of pomp and glamor, the old
Masque Ball which appealed to everyone's secret de
sire to play king, and was therefore one of the most
successful functions of the year. But it will be a "Kid
Party," and we can "Trot with the Tots," so probably
we should stop fussing and join in the fun.
Forward, my jolly juveniles!—Allen Drury.
