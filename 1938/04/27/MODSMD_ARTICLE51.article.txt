(The editor of the Minnesota Daily got to looking
over a psychological report the other clay; it seemed
to worry him.)

A PROBLEM which worries most psychologists is:
* "What do male and female university freshmen
worry about?"
Psychologist James Page of the University of
Rochester, not content to brood endlessly on thi.s poser,
sought to bring an end to distraction by discovering
the truth. Last week, before the eastern division of
the American Psychological Association, he announced
the results of a conscientious and relentless investiga
tion into the mental travails of college freshmen.
As was to be expected Dr. Page found that girls
worried most over whether or not they were popular.
Boys, on the other hand confessed fear of being under
weight worried them, as did the suspicion that they
were not taking sufficient interest in their work.
About 10 per cent of each sex was afraid of impending
death.
In one respect, at least, university freshmen worry
less than do their upperclass fellows. With pitiful
naivete, merely 3 per cent of the freshmen feared going
insane enough to worry about it. Although academic
investigation has yet to cast any light upon the point,
academic experience would lead one to believe that
seniors worry not so much as to "whether" but as 1o
how soon they will bo reduced to madness.

/ kNE assertion in Dr. Page's report, however, makes
the whole study suspect. He maintains that "the
less intelligent worry more than their mental super
iors -a pnlpably invalid conclusion. Take football
coaches, for example. The worrying of our most suc
cessful mentors is a permanent feature of the national
scene. Yet would you call a man who, by infinite cun
ning and clever strategy, is able to build powerful
point-getting machines a moron? And on the other
hand, there is ( harlie McCarthy, the classic example
of the chronic unworrier. Is McCarthy an intellectual
giant. And graduate students- we all know their
propensity for brooding amongst the library stacks.
No. Dr. P;igi\ we cannot grant you thi.s point.
The effort to thrash out the problem is commend
able Just this one thing worries us: What do psy
chologists worry about when they don't worry about
other people's worries','
