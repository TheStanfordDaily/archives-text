# CAMPUS OPINION
## YOU'RE TELLING US? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There seem to be a lot of people
who write to The Daily to express
minor gripes, but here us a real one.
Stanford as a whole is a great school,
but there is one thing really wrong
with it:
The telephone service, if it can be j
called scrvice. I was prompted to
write this letter because I feel that
it is a quicker way to get in touch l
with my date than the 3121 or 5171
way. Suzy, I went to the telephone j
at 9:45 o'clock to try and phone you I
about our date Friday.
Progress Report
At 10:05 o'clock I got the operator,
and at 10:20 o'clock after telling him
that I wanted 5171 I got the Palo
Alto Hospital. At 10:25 o'clock I
got the operator and I was at last;
connected with Roble but the Roble
operator had retired and I came
here to write you what I wanted j
to say over the telephone. "I'll meet
you at Topsy's Roost at 8:45 on Fri- ,
day night."
Well, dear editor and Walter Gif- i
ford, I finally got my message to 1
Suzy Garcia, but Garcia was it a
lot of trouble. I'd sure appreciate l
ii if $50 of the $32,000,000 Stanford
endowment were diverted towards
the improvement of the Encina- i
Toyon telephone system which also 1
includes the Union. I don't belong
to the Union but I sure advocate
shorter hours for one switch.
Naughty Talk
I have called the operator all sorts j
of bad words, but I can see that he |
has no influence. I (and about 700
other people) would like to see the
power of the press diverted towards
promoting the general welfare.
Lots of love, ,
—Perturbed.
P. S.—This might be an old gripe, i
but how can you expect to gef rid j
of automobiles on the campus if,
you can't even telephone. See Bull
Session April 25, 1938 Maybe if
there is enough sentiment (which I
am sure there is) to back this gripe !
of ancient vintage, my grandchil- j
Hren can enjoy a decent conversa
tion.
