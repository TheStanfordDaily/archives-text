The Editor, Sir:
One week-end last summer a
friend and I drove up to Yosemite.
We explored the valley floor the
first afternoon, and that night we
watched the fire tumble over the
cliff.
The next morning—clear as only
a morning in the Sierras can be—l
asked my friend if he would climb
the trail with me up to Glacier Point.
I told him that we would be able to
|ee north almost to Mt. Lassen,
south past Mt. Whitney, east clear
to the Utah wastelands, and west
over the San Joaquin Valley to the
Coast Range.
"No," he said. "I think I'll just
sit here in the sun. It's a rotten
trail up to the Point, and I can sec
the Falls and El Capitan from here."
So I left my friend sititng in the
sun.
Late in the afternoon I returned
to the valley. The sun had gone
down, but my friend was still sit
ting where I'd left him. He was
asleep.
My friend might have been the
freshman editor.
