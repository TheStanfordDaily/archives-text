The Editor, Sir:
I would like to pass on to Stan
ford the advice that Robert Bcnchley
gave New Yorkers on the opening
night of "Johnny Johnson."
"My GOD, if we don't grab on to
something really big when it comes
along, even if it does have its flaws,
the theater may go right, on as it
started this year. Makes you laugh,
cry, and boil. The first anti-war
play to use laughing gas in its at
tack on mankind, and to my mind
the most effective of all satires in
it. c class."
I am prompted to write this com
ment because Stanford students arc
prone to miss some of (he attractions
which play here. Paul Green's
"Johnny Johnson" is the finest.
Broadway success that we have put
on in many a season.
Not only is it "seriously funny,"

| but in its high moments it recalls
"the quality of Charlie Chaplin's
greatest comedy, 'Shoulder Arms'."
—Melville Mack.
