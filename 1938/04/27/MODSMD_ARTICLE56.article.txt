The Editor, Sir:
Referring to Mr. Park Kimball's
"Back to the Land" Bull Session on j
Monday, I would like to take violent
exception to his statement that there
might exist now someone who is
ashamed to admit that a Cellar coke
is a close runner-up for a Mark
Daiquiri.
Perhaps his real shame would be
in even mentioning a Mark cocktail
—or for that matter any other that j
the S. F. hotels offer. The only de
scription I have is the time I spilled
fly spray in my strawberries.
All in all, the Cellar cokes are far
superior to anything the Mark turns
out. Of course, Andre's is another
story. Love,
—Keno. |
