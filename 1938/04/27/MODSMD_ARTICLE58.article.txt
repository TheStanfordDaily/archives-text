# Slaters To Give Three Readings
## 
### 
A. A. Milne's whimsical "Miss
Marlowe at Play" will round out a
well-balanced program of three one
act readings to be presented by
Stagers in the Little Theater next
Friday.
The play, which involves a famous
actress who is caught in an amus
ing and compromising situation, is
another example of the author's skill
in producing the charming, airy
comedy for which he is famous. For
some years Milne was assistant edi
tor of "Punch," English humor mag
azine, and had gained considerable
recognition through his magazine
writing before he began writing
plays, which have been often de
scribed as having the "essential basis
of excitement over which is froth,
wit, and romance."
Most of his works can best he

described as "amiable," having little
to ruffle the emotions other than to
create a deep feeling of satisfaction.
Other typical works of his are:
"When We Were Very Young,"
"Winnie the Pooh," "The House at
Pooh Corner," and "Now We Are
Six." The reading will be directed
by Melba Mae Toombes.
