Stanford will have another chance |
| to see its senior hoopmen in action.
May 12 they will play next year's 1
tentative varsity squad in the Pa
j vilion, proceeds to go to the Con
valescent Home Drive.
It was feared for a while that Hank i
Luisetti would not be eligible be
cause he has accepted a movie con
tract. The American Athletic Un
j ion has sanctioned his amateur
S status, however, it was learned yes
! terday.
j Plans for the game were com
pleted last night by H. B. Lee, whom
! Cardinals put in charge of ar
' range men ts.
! "We expect a packed house," he
I declared. "At 50 cents a seat for
i students and general public, it should
| made a lot of money for the Home
| Drive.

"The B.A.C. has donated the $20
rental fee for the Pavilion, so what
we take in will be almost clear
profit."
Lee and General Chairman Bud
Milligan decided against holding the
game next week during the main
part of the Drive. They feared they
would be packing the week too full
and encountered difficulties in ar
ranging for the use of the Pavilion.
Advance ticket sales will start
next week at the A.S.S.U. office. Lee
announced. He said students would
have three days to buy tickets be
fore th ey are put on public sale.
Cardinals scheduled a meeting for
tonight to make further Convales
cent Home Drive plans. They will
meet at 7:15 o'clock in Room in. Old
