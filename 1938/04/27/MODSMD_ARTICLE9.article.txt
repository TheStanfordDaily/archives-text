# Wrestlers Recognized By Ex Com
## Thompson Appointed Member Of Union Board Of Governors 
### 
Acting on the precedent set last
year, Ex Committee last night
granted four Circle S's for winners
in the Cal-Stanford wrestling match.
The letters were granted with the
provision, however, that wrestling
should continue without minor sport
recognition.
This move was in accordance with
the opinion of Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports, who spoke to
Ex Committee on the question of the
awards. In justice to the boys com
peting, but still allowing for the un
stable condition of the sport, he be
lieved the committee should grant
the awards.
"I am somewhat lukewarm about
the idea," he admitted. But, he felt,
the competitors should have some
recognition for the work they have
done.
Flyers Ask Awards
Following the trend of thought on
awards, Bob Townsend, president
of Stanford Flying Club, suggested
that some form of university award
be made to winners in the Pacific
Coast Flying meet, the first of which
was held last week here. He out
lined the past successes of the club,
and desired that any such awards be
made through the A.S.S.U.. although
members and the club would pay for
them.
"It isn't quite the same as an of
ficial award if we just go down to
Roos Bros, and buy them our
selves," he said. Ex Committee was
faVorable to the idea, and will take
action when some specific plan for
awards is presented to them.
Union Appointment
Roy Thompson was appointed by
the body to the Union Board of
Governors.
Quarterly report of the Speaker's
Bureau was submitted to the Com
mittee. In summing up the report,
President Tom Killefer said that the
bureau's fame had spread as far as
Modesto. Chuck Fontius added that
with the fame, traveling expenses
were expanding, and the body grant
ed authorization to take care of
added expenses as they came up.
Discuss Lecture Series
On the Lecture Series which was
proposed after the trial Call Sand
burg lecture, Killefer reported that
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, chair
man of the Public Exercises Com
mittee, feared that a large line-up of
lectures would crowd the calendar
too much, and cut down attendance
at these and other events. He sug
gested that only two or three out
standing men be invited during the
year. Killefer said that committee
men were needed to plan the series
if it is to be established.
On the question of Sunday night
movies, Fontius reported that they
had been discontinued this quarter
because the movie companies had
tightened up when they learned that
the feature was competing with Palo
Alto theaters.
Drive Action Promised
Admitting that he had slipped up,
Killefer promised that action would
be taken by the Drives Committee
on the matter of the junior class
drive now in progress.
Dates granted were: Stagers, May
1; Convalescent Home Drive, May 4
and 12; Theta Xi, May 13; Senior
Class, May 18; and Deegeo, May 27.

mittee. In summing up the report,
President Tom Killefer said that the
bureau's fame had spread as far as
Modesto. Chuck Fontius added that
with the fame, traveling expenses
were expanding, and the body grant
ed authorization to take care of
added expenses as they came up.
Discuss Lecture Series
On the Lecture Series which was
proposed after the trial Call Sand
burg lecture, Killefer reported that
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, chair
man of the Public Exercises Com
mittee, feared that a large line-up of
lectures would crowd the calendar
too much, and cut down attendance
at these and other events. He sug
gested that only two or three out
standing men be invited during the
year. Killefer said that committee
men were needed to plan the series
if it is to be established.
On the question of Sunday night
movies, Fontius reported that they
had been discontinued this quarter
because the movie companies had
tightened up when they learned that
the feature was competing with Palo
Alto theaters.
Drive Action Promised
Admitting that he had slipped up,
Killefer promised that action would
be taken by the Drives Committee
on the matter of the junior class
drive now in progress.
Dates granted were: Stagers, May
1; Convalescent Home Drive, May 4
and 12; Theta Xi, May 13; Senior
Class, May 18; and Deegeo, May 27.
Acting on the precedent set last
year, Ex Committee last night
granted four Circle S's for winners
in the Cal-Stanford wrestling match.
The letters were granted with the
provision, however, that wrestling
should continue without minor sport
recognition.
This move was in accordance with
the opinion of Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports, who spoke to
Ex Committee on the question of the
awards. In justice to the boys com
peting, but still allowing for the un
stable condition of the sport, he be
lieved the committee should grant
the awards.
"I am somewhat lukewarm about
the idea," he admitted. But, he felt,
the competitors should have some
recognition for the work they have
done.
Flyers Ask Awards
Following the trend of thought on
awards, Bob Townsend, president
of Stanford Flying Club, suggested
that some form of university award
be made to winners in the Pacific
Coast Flying meet, the first of which
was held last week here. He out
lined the past successes of the club,
and desired that any such awards be
made through the A.S.S.U.. although
members and the club would pay for
them.
"It isn't quite the same as an of
ficial award if we just go down to
Roos Bros, and buy them our
selves," he said. Ex Committee was
faVorable to the idea, and will take
action when some specific plan for
awards is presented to them.
Union Appointment
Roy Thompson was appointed by
the body to the Union Board of
Governors.
Quarterly report of the Speaker's
Bureau was submitted to the Com
mittee. In summing up the report,
President Tom Killefer said that the
