### BILL MILLIS 
() NE of the most effective ways to
preserve peace is to be prepared
for war."
Remember that statement of Sen.
Key Pittman, made by the Nevada
chairman of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee yesterday, when
you wonder why the foreign policy
of the United States requires a total
armaments appropriation for the
coming year of more than $1,800,-
000.000.
Sen. Pittman's declaration was
made to a veterans' delegation which
presented to Congress petitions
signed by 4,000,000 persons demand
ing that the government "keep
America out of war."
Ilis pronouncement adds weight
to the "statement of policy" at
tached to the navy bill a few
weeks ago, which made clear that
defense of the United States in
volved protection of American
interests or citizens wherever they
might he endangered.
Emphasizing that the administra
tion is "striving seriously and sin
cerely to maintain actual neutral
ity," Pittman advocated govern
ment control of munitions plants
and legislation designed to prohibit
war-time profiteering.

A Senate bloc including one
fourth of the members yesterday in
troduced such a measure. Steeply
graduated taxation is the main fea
ture of the bill.
While President Roosevelt was
signing the $546,866,494 navy appro
priation bill, debate continued in
the Senate on the separate naval
expansion bill. Sen. Arthur H.
Vandenberg (R., Mich.) condemned
the proposed building of 45,000-ton
battleships, and said that the United
States remains "morally bound" by
the 35,000-ton provisions of the 1936
London naval treaty.

HAT President Roosevelt and
Henry Ford, who has in the
past violently opposed New Deal
labor legislation, ac'ually discussed
during their two-hour conference in
Washington yesterday will probably
remain in the Apocrypha of Ameri
can politics.
Afterward, Mr. Ford said that
their luncheon conversation was
of "a general nature" and it
did not include discussions of
methods of dealing with the eco
nomic crisis.
"The country is all right" and it
will "continue to be all right as
long as the people continue to
think," so he declared.

As a method to finance Germany's
four-year plan for economic self
sufficiency, Field Marshall Hermann
Wilhelm Goering, Hitler's first as
sistant, yesterday authorized a de
cree empowering him to utilize and
confiscate Jewish-held properties
('.mounting to nearly $3,000,000,000.
European Zionists said that the
decree, which applies both to
Jews in foreign countries holding
properties in Germany and to
those still remaining in the Third
Iteich, will result in "the economic
extinction of Germany's Jews."
A German official spokesman said
that the main purpose of the decree
is "to obtain a record of Jewish
property in Germany and Austria,
especially the latter, to prevent
shady transactions."
