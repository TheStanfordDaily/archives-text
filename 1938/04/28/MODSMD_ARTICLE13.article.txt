j instinct and social pressure into

-1 ily to the present family, which

extreme nationalisms, with their dog
matic teachings that the individual
1 is nothing as compared to the state,
1 which have issued a type of relig
ion that involves aggressive con
! tempt for other nations and govern
! ments.

"In these times of chaos, men who
I express sympathy for other govern

ing such evaluations that are doing
democracy a great service."
