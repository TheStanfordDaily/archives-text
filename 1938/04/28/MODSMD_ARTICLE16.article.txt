Round table discussions on con- [
troversial aspects of peace and war
closed Stanford's Peace Day pro- i
gram yesterday. The talks were i
lead both by faculty members and
by authorities not connected with
the University.
The Luncheon Club also devoted 1
its meeting yesterday to a talk on
peace by Dr. Albert Guerard, pro
fessor of literature.
Security Discussed
Guiding the discussion of "Col
lective Security vs. Isolation," Hil- j
den Gibson, instructor in political
science, said that collective security
is the way to check aggressive Fas
cist nations and preserve peace.
Speaking on "Can Economic Co
operation Prevent War," Theodore i
Kreps, associate professor of busi- ;
ness economics, stressed the bene- |
fits of trade agreements. "Our most j
urgent problem is to reduce trade j
barriers. The world's economic 1
troubles center in the breakdown of j
trade."
Speaks on Defense
Lt. Com. Stewart Bryant, U.S.N. '
rt., lead the discussion on "National
Defense: Why, Where, How?" He I
stressed the danger of wars result
ing from imperialism, and pointed
out that our chance for safety lies j
in "ideas, not bullets."
Discussing "Propaganda and War," j
Robert Desmond, acting associate 1
professor of journalism, outlined the
history of censorship and propagan
da during war times. He warned
that both will continue to be used, !
and that the public must consciously i
guard against them.
Labor and War
Commenting on "Labor Organi- i
zation and War," George Hedley, of !
the University of California, said |
that recent polls show labor in favor
of nationalization of munitions in
dustries, the Ludlow Amendment, a
boycott of Japan, and the Roosevelt
Big Navy Program. Organized labor,
he said, tends toward nationalism
and realism.
John Brown Mason, of Santa Ana
Junior College, discussed "Nazi Ger
many in European Politics." He fore
saw danger of war when Hitler
clashes with a country that will not
be bluffed. But, he said, the union
with Austria will establish a bal
ance of power between Germany and
Italy in the Balkans that may pre
vent conflict.
British Policy Topic
Philip Buck, assistant professor o<"
political science, spoke on "British
Foreign Policy â€” Peace at Any
Pricer" "Chamberlain's policy," he
said, "is about the best short-run
policy possible, because collective
security, given a sporting chance in
1935, failed."
Frank S. Gaines, for 10 years head
of International Relations Commit
tee of Commonwealth Club, dis
cussed "Undeclared War in the Far
East." The great question here, he
said, is what action shall the Unit
ed States take. A recent poll by the
Club shows that we tend to favor an
isolationist policy.
Max Savelle, associate professor of
history, lead the discussion on "The
Spanish Crisis: What If the Fascists
Win?" He pointed out that Franco
advocates authoritarianism, strong
nationalisms, and totalitarianism in
economic life. These policies will be
put into effect if the Fascists win.
