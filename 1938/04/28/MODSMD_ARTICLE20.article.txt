### 
Efforts to "egg on" a speaker en
livened the off-campus University
of California peace demonstration
held at Sather Gate, Berkeley, yes
terday, the United Press reported.
While an estimated 1000 students
attended the strike meeting, nearly
5000 others heard Dr. Paul F. Cad
man, director of the American Re
search Foundation, speak at a Uni
versity-sponsored assembly held at
the same time.
Target of the egg-throwers was

wires of the public address sys
