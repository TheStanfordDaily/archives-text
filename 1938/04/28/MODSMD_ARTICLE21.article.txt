# Speakers Urge Positive Action For America
## 
### 
Stanford held high mass for the
Goddess of Peace yesterday with an
all-University assembly where three
speakers sang the praises of a peace
that occasionally passed the under
standing of the audience.
Owen Lattimore, lecturer, author,
and authority on world affairs,
sounded the key-note of the meet
ing, calling lor "active peace meas
ures." Chappie Editor Bob Hart
mann and Celeste Strack of the
A.S.U. followed with discussions of
the problem of working for peace.
'Positive Action'
"Active peace measures, such as
boycott, do not lead to war but re
move causes of war," Mr. Lattimore
told his audience of 700 students,
dismissed from 11 o'clock classes.
"The whole problem boils down to
this: Are we to seek peace by nega
tive actio;, or by positive action?"
Passive measures, he said, have
failed, and will lend only to a con
tinuation of the present chaos.
"We are conscious," Lattimore con
tinued. "of a sinking despair among
the peoples around us when they
see the policies America follows."
"The Chinese," he said, "have
been reduced to war as a last des
perate resort. They are astounded
to see us let the situation grow
worse through failure to strengthen
the forces of peace."
Ilartmann Talks
In his opinion only strong meas
ures such as boycott and embargo
can check the rise of war. But he
pointed out that it is important to
judge the problem objectively. "If
you can arrive at a satisfactory in
tellectual view, then put emotion be
hind it. But emotion wrongly ap
plied to peace can be as dangerous
as war emotion."
Following Lattimore's talk, Bob
Ilartmann stressed the possibility of
achieving results in the drive for
peace. "The attitude of futility is
the greatest barrier we have to
face," he said.
Individual Influence
"Each individual," he said, "has
some influence. We can announce
that we will resist war, and that we
will try in every way to stay out of
the next one."
He also pointed out that peace
groups must co-operate and com
promise, smoothing out small dif
ferences for the sake of their goal.
"There must be more peace among
the peace-makers."
Active Peace Necdd
Celeste Strack, peace discussion
leader of the A.S.U.. closed the meet
ing with the suggestion that student
peace groups could bring pressure to
bear on Congress. She advocated
amendment of the neutrality act to
permit penalties for aggressor nations
and support for defending coun
tries.
She declared that there is an im
mediate need for strong and active
peace measures. "At present China
and Spain are carrying the military
burden of the struggle against ag
gressive Fascists. But if we refuse
to act today, we will have to carry
the military burden later on."
