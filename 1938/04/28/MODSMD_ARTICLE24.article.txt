# Jimmy Wilson Will Give Up Playing
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 26 (UP).â€”From
now on it'll be just Manager Jimmy
Wilson. After 15 years in the catch
er's box with the Cardinals and
Phillies, Wilson has decided it's time
to hang up his mitt, mask and
breast protector for good.
"I'm through. When it comes time
to cut down on May 15, I'm taking
my name off the active player list.
My job from now on will be to
manage the Phillies."
