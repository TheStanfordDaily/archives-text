# Don Berger Named To Head Drive Clean-Up
## Failure To Get Rates Causes Cancellation Of Bowling Matches 
### 
Don Berger last night was named
chairman of the Convalescent Home
Drive clean-up committee at Cardi
nals' meeting.
He will replace Paul Slattcry, who
has been out of school following an
injury received recently while ski
ing.
Following the appointment, Cardi
nals heard reports on progress of
various committees of the Drive.
Bowling Cancelled
The bowling tournament has been
cancelled, according to Bud Mil
ligan. who presided in the absence
of Chairman Mark Hopkins.
"It was impossible to get rates,"
he explained. "Since there's no way
to make a profit on the tourna
ment, it was decided best to drop it
completely, rather than have a flop."
Game Dinged
Offered by Thurlow's was a game
with all profits to go to the Home.
Winners would be given prizes by
Thurlow's according to the sugges
tion. This idea, however, was ding
ed by the Administration.
Prepared to give total net returns
to the Home, Nipa Hut proposed to
sell apple cider all Labor Day. The
offer was taken under considera
tion by Cardinals.
After completion of regular busi
ness, the committee made final ar
rangements for its sailing party this
Saturday, to be given by Beth Allen.
