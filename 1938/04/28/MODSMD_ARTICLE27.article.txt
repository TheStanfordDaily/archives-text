# Home Ends 'Sob' Stories

"Sob stuff? Don't write any of it
about this Convalescent Home.''
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, director of
Stanford's Convalescent Home, was
ruffled out of her usual cheerful
ness and became slightly irritated for
a moment one afternoon last week
when we were out at the Home.
''If you write any sob stuff, you'll
be making it up," she warned.
We found that Mrs. Atwood was
right. Pitiful stories don't begin at
the Convalescent Home. They end
there. Children come there seriously
ill or in run-down conditions, come
there as a result of situations which
are tragic, sometimes. But whatever
amount of tragedy they bring with
them has gone when they go home
again.
Dorothy Gilbert came to the Home
about three years ago. She had re
ceived third degree burns in a Hal
lowe'en fire and San Francisco doc
tors said her case was hopeless. She
was sure to die.
But she didn't die. She came to
the Home with her body seared all
over, and with her arms and legs
nearly as thin as her bones. In 32

months she had completely recov
ered.
The Convalescent Home is neces
sarily a happy place. The kids have
fun there. They have come there to
be made well physically, but they
must be happyâ€”mentally.
You find that from talking to
them and watching them, but you
find it even more from their let
ters. Every Tuesday is letter-writ
ing day. All of the kids write home
then, or to their friends.
Mrs. Atwood keeps copies of all
the letters they write, as well as of
the letters they write back to the
Home after they have left, and we
went through her files of them.
Their letters showed that living in
the Convalescent Home has been or
is one of the bright spots in their
lives. The kids know more kids
than they have ever been able to
know before. They do things that
they have never been able to do
before.
