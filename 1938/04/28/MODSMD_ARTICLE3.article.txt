# Fourteen 'Lost' Offices Stagnate
## 
### 
A pair of bifocals and noth
ing more â€”is the total collec
tion in the Lost and Found de
partment of the A.S.S.U. office.
Business is lax. Lost things
are not being found, in spite of
the fact that Stanford has 14
Lost and Found departments.
They are in the accounting of
fice in the Ad Building, the
women's and men's gyms, the
Cellar cigar counter, and in the
various school offices.
A few textbooks have, ad
mittedly been turned in at the
reserve book desk and the loan
book desk in the Libe. How
ever, owners of books bearing
names ire notified by card.
