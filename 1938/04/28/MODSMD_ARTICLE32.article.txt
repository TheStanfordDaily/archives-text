THfcRE are a lot of conjectures
heard here and there about what
Ed Burrows is going to do in the
U.S.C. meet a week from Saturday
—on what races he's going to run
as well as where he's going to place.
It seems fairly certain that he is
going to run the mile, but there still
remains a choice between the two
mile and the half. Louis Zamperini
of Troy is capable of great racing at
any of the three distances, and he's
a cinch to run the mile first.
The fine showing turned in by
Paul Ganahl against Cal last week,
when he took third in the two
mile ahead of Vollmer in !):42.8,
gives him at least an even break
against Portanova of U.S.C'., so if
Zamperini doesn't run the two
mile Burrows may stay out and
see what he can do against the
Trojan flash in the 880.
Incidentally, Gamihl must have de
rived no small amount of pleasure
in beating out Cal's Ted Vollmer.
In the Little Big Meet last year
Vollmer ran away from Paul to set
a new two-mile record. By nothing
but hard work Ganahl got himself
into good enough condition this year
to turn the tables and earn his let
ter. He did a nice job.
The Trojans have a threat in
the 880 who calls himself Phil
Roil lac, and on past performances
he's capable of beating the best
Stanford has at (he distance by at
least 15 yards. However, he was
in no condition to run against Cal
this year, and thafs why Zamper
ini was put in the 880.
Whether he will be in shape
against Stanford is another question,
but even if there is a chance of his
not being able to go, that probably
won't be decided up until meet
time and Templeton will have to
worry about him.
Carl Mahurin, hampered this year
by a strained Achilles tendon, and
then a very severe burn on which
he trained against doctor's orders,
has a bad leg now and it begins to
look as though he's not going to have
a square chance to get in condition.
He can't be considered a match for
Roulac if the French boy is in any
kind of shape at all.
Zamperini could probably run
away with the race if he entered,
but Dean Cromwell might let him
in the two-mile if he figures Rou
lac feels good enough to enter the
880.
Burrows, in the final reckoning,
will likely enter the two longer
races. It should be interesting to
note, if both he and Zamperini run
the mile and two-mile, just how
much endurance the two have. Ed
might be able to beat Zamperini in
the two after they have clipped off
the mile, and then again he might
not.
Two things about the meet seem
fairly certain, anyway—Burrows and
Zamperini will meet in the mile in
what should be a wingding duel,
and Stanford is going to lose the
meet—Peterson.
