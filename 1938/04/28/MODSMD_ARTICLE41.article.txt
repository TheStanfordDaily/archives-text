## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 27 (UP).â€”The
New York Giants moved into a tie
for the National League lead today
when they swept both ends of a
double-header from the Philadelphia
Phillies to extend their winning
streak to seven straight.
The 7-3 and 11-6 killings dead
locked them at the top of the stand
ings with the Pittsburgh Pirates who
also won. Harry Gumbert went the
route for the Giants in the first game,
scattering six hits while his mates
clubbed Mulcahy and Sivess for 12,
including a home run by Jim Whip
ple. Chuck Klein homered for
Philadelphia. A six-run rally in the
seventh inning won the nightcap for
the New Yorkers.
The Pirates remained on top by
nosing the Chicago Cubs 6-5. After
being held scoreless for five inn
ings by Larry French, the Bucs went
berserk with a five-run splurge
topped by Arky Vaughan's four
bagger with the bases crowded.
Marty homered for Chicago.
