# Two Associate Editors Look at Peace Day
## 
### 
Editor's note. —Jimmie and Johnnie covered
Peace Day yesterday and found the theme to
be bewilderment. Their surprisingly similar
reactions are below.
A CLEAR solution solution to world prob
lems —to a layman like myself—is difficult
enough to arrive at, even by the simple process
of prejudice arising from ignorance, but when
I see two well-informed, clear thinkers logically
uphold directly opposite sides of a question, I
am indeed left at a loss.
Yesterday I attended a round-table discussion
which turned into an informal debate between
Associate Professor Philip Buck, a supporter of
the Chamberlain foreign policy of concession,
and Celeste Strack, ardent upholder of col
lective security.
Both knew facts, figures, names, and numbers
of all the players. Both had a wide, penetrat
ing, statistical understanding of what had been
happening on the international front in the past
several years. Both agreed on the whys in the
failure of collective policies in relation to Italy
and Ethiopia, and both agreed upon the disas
trous results of allowing militaristic countries
to take all they can get. Both agreed that in
taking such concessions (as Japan grabbing
Manchuria, Italy snatching Ethiopia, and Ger
many assimilating Austria), the aggressors
failed to justify their militarism by alleviating
internal needs—supposed causes of expansion.
But Mr. Buck concluded that collectivism had
been given as sporting a chance as it would
ever get back in 1935. It failed. Therefore, con
cession — or collective bargaining — was the
only solution. Miss Strack, starting, remember,
from the same factual foundation that Mr. Buck
used, maintained that concession would only
increase militaristic activity, would eventually
plunge the world in war.
Now it might be supposed that one of the two
would fail to convince a detached observer;
that, as such, I would today join forces with
either Buck or Strack. But with two people,
equally informed, equally logical, and equally
"right" as far as their reasoning from fact to
theory, such a decision on my part is impos
sible.
If I had heard only one side, I could not fail
to be convinced. But hearing both sides, pre
sented in a thoroughly logical, reasonable man
ner, I am baffled. So what? Of course, it only
means that I still don't know what the score is.
That doesn't bother me. But what does, and
what should bother every one of us, is the
fact that no one, reasoning clearly, can know
the answer.
Which puts me, acting by prejudice rather
than by reasoning, in as good a position as
those who know what they are talking about.
I suppose, in such a position, I should feel
pretty Napoleonic—delusions of grandeur and
all that. But, in fact, it just scares me stiff.—J. S.
W'E had a bad time with Peace Day. It was
all very educational and informative, and
it was doubtless good for the soul. But it ap
palled us to see the confusion of opinions. It
was discouraging to watch one doctrine grap
pling with another without having any way of
judging which was better. The whole thing
made us wish that Stanford's proposed course
in peace were being given now.
Yesterday's program proved the need for a
peace course better than a carload of the grand
est burst of oratory that ever mixed a metaphor.
The air was full of flying opinions. Doctrines
were handed out free like handbills. And Stan
ford students found that they had no way to
judge the opinions, that they didn't know
enough about the factors influencing peace to
attempt to make up their minds.
The doctrines that popped in and out of yes
terday's talks obviously couldn't all be true. At
the assembly we were told that boycott and
embargo were the only way to prevent war.
At the round tables we found that economic
experts agree that trade barriers lead to de
prssion and war.
The opinions were strong, and well pre
sented. But no evidence was given. Each
speaker talked like an inspired oracle, and the
most convincing was the one who had taken
elocution. It was simply a case of dogma eat
dogma.
But we didn't want dogma. We can ge* that
from any knight of the brazen rail who solves
the problems of the world between (drinks
We want a workable plan. And we want

evidence to show that it has a chance of success.
A course in peace wouldn't give us that
much. But it could do the next best thing. It
could give us a basis for judging doctrines. It
could tell us which ones have failed, and it
could give us an idea of which ones may suc
ceed.
As it is now, we don't know enough about
peace and war to make any decision that a
backward grammar school boy couldn't equal.
But if the University could give us a critical
evaluation of the factors influencing peace, per
haps we would have a few tools to use in
thinking.
Until we get some trustworthy information
we will have to remain baffled, like a small
dog who hears a dozen people whistle from
different directions.—J. C.

Editor's note. —Jimmie and Johnnie covered
Peace Day yesterday and found the theme to
be bewilderment. Their surprisingly similar
reactions are below.
A CLEAR solution solution to world prob
lems —to a layman like myself—is difficult
enough to arrive at, even by the simple process
of prejudice arising from ignorance, but when
I see two well-informed, clear thinkers logically
uphold directly opposite sides of a question, I
am indeed left at a loss.
Yesterday I attended a round-table discussion
which turned into an informal debate between
Associate Professor Philip Buck, a supporter of
the Chamberlain foreign policy of concession,
and Celeste Strack, ardent upholder of col
lective security.
Both knew facts, figures, names, and numbers
of all the players. Both had a wide, penetrat
ing, statistical understanding of what had been
happening on the international front in the past
several years. Both agreed on the whys in the
failure of collective policies in relation to Italy
and Ethiopia, and both agreed upon the disas
trous results of allowing militaristic countries
to take all they can get. Both agreed that in
taking such concessions (as Japan grabbing
Manchuria, Italy snatching Ethiopia, and Ger
many assimilating Austria), the aggressors
failed to justify their militarism by alleviating
internal needs—supposed causes of expansion.
But Mr. Buck concluded that collectivism had
been given as sporting a chance as it would
ever get back in 1935. It failed. Therefore, con
cession — or collective bargaining — was the
only solution. Miss Strack, starting, remember,
from the same factual foundation that Mr. Buck
used, maintained that concession would only
increase militaristic activity, would eventually
plunge the world in war.
Now it might be supposed that one of the two
would fail to convince a detached observer;
that, as such, I would today join forces with
either Buck or Strack. But with two people,
equally informed, equally logical, and equally
"right" as far as their reasoning from fact to
theory, such a decision on my part is impos
sible.

Editor's note. —Jimmie and Johnnie covered
Peace Day yesterday and found the theme to
be bewilderment. Their surprisingly similar
reactions are below.
A CLEAR solution solution to world prob
lems —to a layman like myself—is difficult
enough to arrive at, even by the simple process
of prejudice arising from ignorance, but when
I see two well-informed, clear thinkers logically
uphold directly opposite sides of a question, I
am indeed left at a loss.
Yesterday I attended a round-table discussion
which turned into an informal debate between
Associate Professor Philip Buck, a supporter of
the Chamberlain foreign policy of concession,
and Celeste Strack, ardent upholder of col
lective security.
Both knew facts, figures, names, and numbers
of all the players. Both had a wide, penetrat
ing, statistical understanding of what had been
happening on the international front in the past
several years. Both agreed on the whys in the
failure of collective policies in relation to Italy
and Ethiopia, and both agreed upon the disas
trous results of allowing militaristic countries
to take all they can get. Both agreed that in
taking such concessions (as Japan grabbing
Manchuria, Italy snatching Ethiopia, and Ger
many assimilating Austria), the aggressors
failed to justify their militarism by alleviating
internal needs—supposed causes of expansion.
But Mr. Buck concluded that collectivism had
been given as sporting a chance as it would
ever get back in 1935. It failed. Therefore, con
cession — or collective bargaining — was the
only solution. Miss Strack, starting, remember,
from the same factual foundation that Mr. Buck
used, maintained that concession would only
increase militaristic activity, would eventually
plunge the world in war.
Now it might be supposed that one of the two
would fail to convince a detached observer;
that, as such, I would today join forces with
either Buck or Strack. But with two people,
equally informed, equally logical, and equally
"right" as far as their reasoning from fact to
theory, such a decision on my part is impos
sible.
If I had heard only one side, I could not fail
to be convinced. But hearing both sides, pre
sented in a thoroughly logical, reasonable man
ner, I am baffled. So what? Of course, it only
means that I still don't know what the score is.
That doesn't bother me. But what does, and
what should bother every one of us, is the
fact that no one, reasoning clearly, can know
the answer.
Which puts me, acting by prejudice rather
than by reasoning, in as good a position as
those who know what they are talking about.
I suppose, in such a position, I should feel
pretty Napoleonic—delusions of grandeur and
all that. But, in fact, it just scares me stiff.—J. S.
W'E had a bad time with Peace Day. It was
all very educational and informative, and
it was doubtless good for the soul. But it ap
palled us to see the confusion of opinions. It
was discouraging to watch one doctrine grap
pling with another without having any way of
judging which was better. The whole thing
made us wish that Stanford's proposed course
in peace were being given now.
Yesterday's program proved the need for a
peace course better than a carload of the grand
est burst of oratory that ever mixed a metaphor.
The air was full of flying opinions. Doctrines
were handed out free like handbills. And Stan
ford students found that they had no way to
judge the opinions, that they didn't know
enough about the factors influencing peace to
attempt to make up their minds.
The doctrines that popped in and out of yes
terday's talks obviously couldn't all be true. At
the assembly we were told that boycott and
embargo were the only way to prevent war.
At the round tables we found that economic
experts agree that trade barriers lead to de
prssion and war.
The opinions were strong, and well pre
sented. But no evidence was given. Each
speaker talked like an inspired oracle, and the
most convincing was the one who had taken
elocution. It was simply a case of dogma eat
