# Political Union Suits
## 
### 
WHEN Stanford Political Union is called to
order tonight by Gerald Marcus, tempo
rary chairman and originator of the idea here,
observers will be able to draw several favor
able conclusions.
First, tonight marks the coming to Stanford
of a new idea, and a good one. That Marcus
brought it, and that the campus accepted it with
a surprising amount of enthusiasm, is favorable
conclusion No. 1.
Second, it will bring its members into active
contact with actual democratic procedure. The
party system, the debate topics in the form of
bills, the committee organization all have an
authentic air. Up to now Stanford has gotten
its practical politics behind the scenes of stu
dent-body elections, with dubious benefits.
Now they can whet their taste for politics on
something which more nearly approaches the
real thing.
Third, it is one of the best ideas for a profi
table good time that has hit the campus in a
long time. For, though Stanford may sleep in
political problems courses, it goes for a bull
session in a good-sized way. And with discus
sion groups crystallized into three parties, each
with a definite policy to maintain, the Union
should turn into the best bull-session of them
all.
And fourth, the Union will finally bring to the
campus an incentive to take an interest in na
tional affairs. Stanford is woefully provincial.
Courses which bring the campus into contact
with the problems to be faced after graduation
have an academic tinge to them that is not con
clusive to more thought than it takes to get a
grade.
By getting away from the class-room into the
good, old - fashioned, round - robin discussion,
plus the atmosphere which smacks of the real
thing, the Union should be able to wake up
part of the campus, at least, to what is going on
outside the boundaries.
This awakening is, after all, the goal of a
university, modern educators tell us. And the
Union looks like about the most painless way of
realizing it. So, tonight, Stanford will begin
a practical course in world affairs, sans grades,
sans professors, and sans boredom accruing
from these. And it will have a whale of a good
time doing it. â€”J. S.
