RIFTS IN THE LUTE
ALREADY Britain is beginning to find out that her
Prime Minister's agreement with Italy is not all
he evidently hoped it would be; already she is begin
ning to realize the bad effect it has had on world
opinion, particularly in the United States; and in many
of her leading journals a strain of uncomfortable dis
turbance unfamiliar to the English is beginning to
appear.
Now comes the government's levy of 27per cent
on incomes, and middle-class Britain is beginning to
appreciate even more the effects of a which
makes treaties with an ally nobody can trust and then
desperately increases armaments in order to make
the treaties stick.
The British middle-class is not the ordinary middle
class, and the revolution which has come through dis
satisfied middle-classes elsewhere will probably not
come through it. A thousand years of self-hypnosis
can not. be overthrown in a day; and the British
middle-class, carefully protected by a paternalistic
press from any contact with the outer world, prob
ably would not dream of being so vulgar as to unseat
the government.
But there are signs that a change is coming. In a
recent by-election ihe labor candidate was returned to
Parliament with more than a 100-vote lead over his
Conservative opponent. A general spirit of criticism
is beginning to creep almost imperceptibly into British
discussions of British policy; and Anthony Eden, broad
casting from London on Tuesday, informs us that the
policy of non-recognition and maintenance of League
principles is not dead.
So it may be that Mr. Chamberlain's days in No.
10 are numbered, that his cabinet, long rent by in
ternal dissension which has several times come close
to the breaking point, will soon be either out of office
or re-shuffled under some more progressive Prime
Minister.
Mr. Chamberlain's policy, harking as it does to an
age when "balance of power" was a workable policy—
when agreements could be m.idc with some certainty
that they would be kept, when international decency
meant something, might have been effective then; it
is not now.
For England's sake, the sake of the Empire, the
world, and peace, it is to be hoped that there occurs
either a shift in Mr. Chamberlain's policy- a political
impossibility-*— or <1 new man in office. Only then will
Britain be able to re-assume the place of leadership
which hns so long been hers —Allon Drury.
