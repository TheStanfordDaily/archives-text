# New Realism Permeates Cain Novel
## 
### 
When I had finished reading "Ser
enade" by James M. Cain, I laid the
book down with a strange feeling.
I wondered whether contemporary
readers of Guy de Maupassant, Hon
ore Balzac, Voltaire and Zola had the
same feeling after reading their
works a feeling that what they had
just read was good, but that the smut
and excessive illicit relations smoth-

ered the power of
the book.
Then I realized
that the readers
of that time prob
ably didn't feel
that way about it;
I realized that I
was merely the
product of an un
natural age which
doesn't allow our

inner thoughts and commonplace
actions and words to be printed.
Realism Vented
The "Gulliver's Travels" we read
in grammar school is very pleasant,
but the unabridged "Gulliver's
Travels" is the one that has come
down through history, because the
pen that invented the work was
motivated by a mind unrestricted by
the present trend toward suppres
sion of realism.
The reason why John Steinbeck's
"Of Mice and Men" packed so much
power was its realistic characters
and their realistic words and
thoughts and emotions. James M.
Cain's "Serenade" is on the style of
the Steinbeck novel.
Treats Delicate Subject
Cain, who also wrote "The Post
man Always Rings Twice," puts into
his latest book all the realism of
Steinbeck and he turns out a work
manlike job on a delicate subject.
"Serenade" is about John Howard
Sharp, an opera singer who has lost
his singing voice. His engagements
become fewer and farther between
until he finally finds himself in
Mexico, where he falls in love with
Juana, an Indian girl.
Meets Juana
From the time he takes up with
Juana, "Serenade" is the story of
Sharp's rise to the top again. In his
rise Sharp makes a great name for
himself in pictures and then breaks
his contract for a chance to go on
the radio. The studios blacklist him
and his beloved opera refuses to
take him back, even though he has
regained his voice.
Perhaps the most unusual and
bizarre section of the book is the
part which takes place in an eerie
Mexican church during a driving
rainstorm. Here the conflict of hu
man emotions and yearnings, engi
neered by Cain's superb story-tell
ing, reaches its peak.—Mayer.

works a feeling that what they had
just read was good, but that the smut
and excessive illicit relations smoth-

ered the power of
the book.
Then I realized
that the readers
of that time prob
ably didn't feel
that way about it;
I realized that I
was merely the
product of an un
natural age which
doesn't allow our

inner thoughts and commonplace
actions and words to be printed.
Realism Vented
The "Gulliver's Travels" we read
in grammar school is very pleasant,
but the unabridged "Gulliver's
Travels" is the one that has come
down through history, because the
pen that invented the work was
motivated by a mind unrestricted by
the present trend toward suppres
sion of realism.
The reason why John Steinbeck's
"Of Mice and Men" packed so much
power was its realistic characters
and their realistic words and
thoughts and emotions. James M.
Cain's "Serenade" is on the style of
the Steinbeck novel.
Treats Delicate Subject
Cain, who also wrote "The Post
man Always Rings Twice," puts into
his latest book all the realism of
Steinbeck and he turns out a work
manlike job on a delicate subject.
"Serenade" is about John Howard
Sharp, an opera singer who has lost
his singing voice. His engagements
become fewer and farther between
until he finally finds himself in
Mexico, where he falls in love with
Juana, an Indian girl.
Meets Juana
From the time he takes up with
Juana, "Serenade" is the story of
Sharp's rise to the top again. In his
rise Sharp makes a great name for
himself in pictures and then breaks
his contract for a chance to go on
the radio. The studios blacklist him
and his beloved opera refuses to
take him back, even though he has
regained his voice.
Perhaps the most unusual and
bizarre section of the book is the
part which takes place in an eerie
Mexican church during a driving
rainstorm. Here the conflict of hu
man emotions and yearnings, engi
neered by Cain's superb story-tell
ing, reaches its peak.—Mayer.


Thumbs Up
When I had finished reading "Ser
enade" by James M. Cain, I laid the
book down with a strange feeling.
I wondered whether contemporary
readers of Guy de Maupassant, Hon
ore Balzac, Voltaire and Zola had the
same feeling after reading their
works a feeling that what they had
just read was good, but that the smut
and excessive illicit relations smoth-

ered the power of
the book.

that the readers
of that time prob
ably didn't feel
that way about it;
I realized that I
was merely the
