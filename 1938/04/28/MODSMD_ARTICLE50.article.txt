# CAMPUS OPINION
## ANALOGYUS SCREWYUS

Dave Botsford:
c/o The Stanford Daily's Editor:
Dear Dave,
Thanks for your Campus Opinion
yesterday. The point was well
taken, inspiring, and without it I
undoubtedly would have slept away
my four years here —in which case
everybody, including myself mostly,
vtould have thought me a mighty
ratty guy after having poured gooey
j gobs of idealism up and down Mon
day's edit columns. Yours,
—A1 Zelver.
P.S.—BUT Dave, old man, your
j letter is shot through with what
more ardent scholars than I would
call analogyus screwyus because:
1) As I recall, and I recall very
well, there was absolutely no ref
i erence in the edit to my sleeping at
! all.
2) While you were busy climbing
| some little old ant-hill your friend,
| had he wanted to, might conceivably

have tacklcd bigger, more import
ant, mountains whose summits
weren't even visible from the Val
ley's floor.
3) A little sleeping in the sun is
fun, anyhow.
4) Say hello to Eleanor.
And incidentally, Bots, you might
he inteiested to know Sage John
CoLbj' reaction to the edit who, by
way ot fatherly advice, drawled bit
terly, in the best "Noth Calina"
drawl that ever came out of "Noth
Calina," "There's no such thing as
freedom in the abstrac ." Then he
made sornt funny li<tie cynical sound
like "Baaaa!"
To which I now reply, GARB
AGE. Who cares whether or not
there's freedom in the abstract.
I'm not living in the abstract.
Titers'.* plenty of freedom to en
joy th» birds, the bees, and Beet
hoven, tha:'s good enough for
me.
A little freedom in the handy jon

| Crete i- worth twice as much as in
the bushy abstract. •
