# Political Union Meets Tonight
## Marcus To Preside At Charter Session 
### 
Stanford Political Union will re
ceive its baptism tonight when it
holds its first meeting in Room 214
at 7:45 o'clock. Presiding will be
Gerald Marcus, who brought the
Union idea back from Yale, where
he saw a similar organization in
action.
Over 150 applications were turned
in by the deadline Tuesday for mem
bership in the Union, and approxi
mately 125 of the applicants have
been accepted. Marcus explained
that a few were rejected because
they were not students registered in
the university.
Members Chosen
The charter members were chos
en by a temporary steering and or
ganization committee of Marcus, Dick
Riddell. Ed Kerr, and Mark Hop
kins. The last three will also act as
temporary leaders of the conserva
tive, liberal, and labor parties, re
spectively.
Marcus said that the business
meeting tonight would be brief, with
the adoption of a constitution the
primary business before the house.
The constitution, he explained, was
simple, and modeled after that of
the Yale Political Union.
Caucus Meetings
Also tonight, a debate topic sug
gested by the temporary committee
will be chosen for the second meet
ing, tentatively set for May 11. Af
ter the business session, the three
parties will hold caucuses, and will
choose nominees for the House,
Election, and Standing Committees
These three bodies are the key cogs
in the Union machinery, electing
members, and arranging all details
for meetings.
The meeting will be open to all
those interested in the Union, al
though only members will be allow
ed to vote or take part in discus
sion, Marcus said.
