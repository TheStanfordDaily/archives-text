### BILL MILLIS 
jVOW is the time for "farmers to I
raise less corn and more hell."
That statement, credited originally
to a leader of Kansas agrarian Pop- j
ulists in the 1880's, gives a good clue j
to the history of talk for third par- !
ties in American politics.
When farm prices are going down, I
when city workers are unemployed, I
when small business men are going j
broke—in periods of economic de
pression—we can look for revived
hope among liberals that a realign
ment of American parties will at last
be achieved.
Since the World War, 1920 and j
1932 were years in which third
party advocates were optimistic and
unsuccessful. Also unsuccessful
was the Progressive Party in 1924.
Nevertheless, its presidential candi
date, "Old Bob" LaFollette, won
nearly 5,000.000 votes.

Hopes for another "third party
that will become the first party"
are again on the ascendancy, as
signified by the announcement is
sued at a Madison, Wis., confer
ence of 5000 mid-West liberals
yesterday by Gov. Philip F. La-
Follette—younger son of the late
senator — of the formation of a
new political party, "the National
Progressives of America" which
lie described as a party of new
capital and new capitalism.
"We are launching the party of
our time" he said, explaining that
it will avoid old fashioned capital
ism as well as fascism, socialism and
communism. Its purposes will be
to preserve the "right of a free
people to work, and by their work to
add to the wealth of the country."
The chief factor limiting effective
organization of a national third
party at the present time is that
since the 193G campaign large sec
tions of progressives and of or
ganized labor in both the AFL and
CIO have shelved any former ob
jections to the Democratic party be
cause of their acceptance of the New
Deal.

( 'ZECHOSLOVAKIA, "the bastion
' of Europe's freedom," is the one
stumbling block that has developed
in the British and French conversa
tions now taking place in London.
While the two powers yesterday
agreed on a plan to transform their
"entente cordiale" into a virtual
military alliance, England was re
ported cool to the proposal of
French Premier Edouard Daladier
and Foreign Minister Georges
ISonnct to stand by Czechoslovakia
in any emergency.
A "high official source" said
that the answer of the Chamber
lain government would he to "wait
and see"—which was the same
answer England gave France be
fore 1914.

rival American trade union federa

America. •

UMWA.
