# Angell Cites Conflicting Allegiances
## 'Higher Patriotism' Lectures Concluded 
### 
Declaring that it is necessary for
man today to adopt an intelligent
system of nationalism and humanism,
Dr. James Rowland Angell, presi
dent emeritus of Yale University,
last night concluded the 13th series
of the West Memorial Lectures on
"The Higher Patriotism."
"Such a program of patriotism may
call for sacrifice, patience, tolerance
of the other peoples of the world,"
he said, "and it means command of
the highest elements of conflict in
the individual."
Describes Conflicts
Leading to these conclusions, Dr.
Angell cited the more minor con
flicting loyalties of the individual to
the family, to the community, to the
state, and to the section.
In a prefatory statement of the
"ruthless chaos of the world to
day," he pointed out that "one can
not help but notice that the political
movement of the last six years in
this country, with its regimentation
ol the plain citizen, follows the road
of the dictatorships abroad.
Effects Unpredictable
"One cannot tell what the effects
of the anxiety abroad on our own
land will be."
Background for tonight's lecture
was sketched by Dr. Angell in his
talks Tuesday and Wednesday nights,
when he spoke on "The Individual—
Material and Problems" and "The
Social Order — Media through
which Ends Arc Realized." Specific
subject of last night's talk was "The
Realm of Loyalties — Human and
Spiritual."
