The statue of Louis Agassiz
that stands on the front of Jor
dan Hall looked bright and col
orful yesterday in spite of the
rain that pelted down.
A red-tasseled stocking cap
was stuck at a jaunty angle over
his eyebrow. A big, black cigar
was stuck in his mouth. A blue
shirt was draped around his
neck, and a pair of slacks was
hanging from his hand.
The drooping cigar wouldn't
stay lit, the brown slacks had a
long rip in the seat, and the
shirt was all washed-out, nev
ertheless the statue seemed to
look self-satisfied.
Campus historians recalled
another adventure of the statue
when it fell off its pedestal and
stuck head-first in the sidewalk
below during the earthquake of
190t). Dr. David Starr Jordan,
then University president, on
seeing the statue, remarked, "I
always have admired Dr. Agas
siz in the abstract: now I can
admire him in the concrete."
