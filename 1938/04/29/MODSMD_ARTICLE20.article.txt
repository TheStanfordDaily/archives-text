# 'Oscar' Insults Damsel In Libe
## 
### 
"Oscar" stuck out his tongue
at a lady in the Libc last night.
The lady screeched.
"Oscar" was then severely
threatened by a crowd of on
lookers who threw down the
gauntlet and offered to avenge
the insult at 20 paces.
At that Oscar fixed his beady
eye on all assembled, wither
ing them in scorn.
"I'm bored," he yawned at
length, coiling up in the jacket
of Bruce Bork who took him
home. "Oscar" is a pet gopher
snake.
