## Gridder to Perform With Don Mulford 
### 
Pete Fay, popular campus tenor,
will be guest soloist with Don Mill
ford's orchestra at the Masque Ball.
This was the surprise announce
ment made yesterday by Jan North
and Don Dewar, co-chairmen of the
! climax to the annual Convalescent
Home Drive, to be held May (J in the
Pavilion from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Persuaded To Sing
"We had planned to have no sched
uled entertainment at all, because
the theme, 'Kid Party,' will furnish
more than enough fun," Miss North
said. "However, repeated demands
from those who have heard Pete Fay
sing have led us to persuade him to
appear with the band."
Don Mulford, whose band recently
was voted the most popular on the
Cal campus, was formerly master of
ceremonies for the Golden State
theater circuit.
Bid Price
Bids for the Masque Ball, which
are $2.56, are now on sale at the
