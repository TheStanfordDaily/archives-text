# Cal Chimes Will Ring Adieu to Bell-Master
## 
### JOHN RICK 
Twice a year for 12 years, Uni
versity of California students have
momentarily dropped their studies
to hear Chimes-master Charles D.
Weikel bemoan the coming of final
examinations by playing "They'll
Be Hanging Danny Deever."
It's a sad song—almost a dirge!
But it'll be sadder still tomorrow
when Mr. Weikel plays it for the
last time before retirement.
Nobody knows Mr. Weikel's age.
He won't tell. But he brags that
everyone takes him for 15 years
younger than he really is—and good
guessers tend to agree on the 65
mark.
Vigorous, healthy, with only u

smattering of white hair, Mr. Wei
kel loves to tell stories about his
youth. He stalled in with music at
the age of 12 and soon became ex
pert with both the flute and the vio
lin.
Proudest moment of his life, he
says, was when, sitting quietly
back-stage, he and his flute pro
vided atmosphere for "Hamlet" —
as performed by Edwin Boothe.
He has a nice singing voice, too.
For many years he has given vocal
lessons and sometimes he even com
poses in this medium.
And now, after 12 years, Mr. Wei
kel is retiring. Pie will play tomor
row, and then no more.
But on May 20, at the conclusion
of the annual senior pilgrimage, he
will be summoned to Sather Gate
and will there be presented with a
special citation voted by the Coun
cil of the California Alumni Associ
ation.
And, after retirement, he will still
be with his beloved chimes. For he
will travel around the country as
representative for a largo European
bell company.
