# Vision of Governor Stanford Neared at Convalescent Home
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Governor Leland Stanford stood in
his living room looking out the wide
window of his home to the
green lawns that stretched out be
fore it.
Something about the peace and
freedom and the bright California
sun cheering the view he saw im
pressed him somehow.
He turned to his wife and said,
"Jane, we should make the children
of California our children." He vi
sioned California's children taken
out of crowded cities, out of squalid
neighborhoods and brought to a
place like his farm.
Gardner Comes
When Dr. D. Charles Gardner
came to Stanford as chaplain years
later, he saw the same vision. The
farm had changed, but he saw a
place for California's children on it
still. He saw a way to help them.
He began in 1917 by organizing the
"Campus Auxiliary to the Stanford
Clinics." The auxiliary gave month
ly donations of money, clothes, and
personal service by Farm students
to unfortunate children.
Rents Kappa House
That summer and the next, the
auxiliary moved a little nearer to
Dr. Gardner's vision. He rented the
old Kappa house on the campus, and
held a summer camp there for crip
pled children. Both years, 120 kids
came in groups of 20.
In 1919 he started the Convalescent
Home. Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Hop
kins and others had seen the possi
bilities of his auxiliary, saw the po
tentialities of a Convalescent Home.
Mr. Hopkins gave what was left
of the old Stanford home, the home
in which Governor Stanford had
spoken his idea of helping the chil
dren of California, to Dr. Gardner
for his Convalescent Home.
Room was constructed for 15 pa

tients. Arrangements were made
with the University Board of Trus
tees to lease the 27-acre plot sur
rounding the residence for $1 a year.
The Convalescent Home grew. A
few years later the $50,000 McLaugh
lin Unit was given in honor of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin. Twenty
mofe children could be taken care
of.
Then in 1928 the Babcock Unit
was added. In 1929 the erection of
the Auxiliary Board Unit complet
ed the immediate building program.
With the opening in 1932 of the Bab
cock Unit, which had been idle for
four years due to lack of funds, the
Home was running at full capacity.
Aid Given Home
Many people have helped keep it
in existence. The Auxiliary Board,
the San Francisco Community Chest,
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. and Mrs.

Payson J. Treat, and many others
have aided the Home.
Stanford students have helped
too. But they are in an obvious po
sition to help. They have inherited,
in part, Dr. Gardner's 21-year vision
of helping the ill and undernour
ished of California's children.
Number Increases
The Home started by caring for 15
children, increased to 35, then to 72
last year, and now it cares for 80
children. It has a permanent staff of
23—11 graduate nurses, 2 house
mothers, 6 nurse helpers, 3 teachers,
and a superintendent.
Helping these permanent staff
members, students from Stanford's
Graduate School of Nursing come to
the Home to work.
The vision seen by Governor Stan
ford and Dr. Gardner is approaching
reality.

farm had changed, but he saw a
place for California's children on it
still. He saw a way to help them.
He began in 1917 by organizing the
"Campus Auxiliary to the Stanford
Clinics." The auxiliary gave month
ly donations of money, clothes, and
personal service by Farm students
to unfortunate children.
Rents Kappa House
That summer and the next, the
auxiliary moved a little nearer to
Dr. Gardner's vision. He rented the
old Kappa house on the campus, and
held a summer camp there for crip
pled children. Both years, 120 kids
came in groups of 20.
In 1919 he started the Convalescent
Home. Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Hop
kins and others had seen the possi
bilities of his auxiliary, saw the po
tentialities of a Convalescent Home.
Mr. Hopkins gave what was left
of the old Stanford home, the home
in which Governor Stanford had
spoken his idea of helping the chil
dren of California, to Dr. Gardner
for his Convalescent Home.
Room was constructed for 15 pa

tients. Arrangements were made
with the University Board of Trus
tees to lease the 27-acre plot sur
rounding the residence for $1 a year.
The Convalescent Home grew. A
few years later the $50,000 McLaugh
lin Unit was given in honor of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin. Twenty
mofe children could be taken care
of.
Then in 1928 the Babcock Unit
was added. In 1929 the erection of
the Auxiliary Board Unit complet
ed the immediate building program.
With the opening in 1932 of the Bab
cock Unit, which had been idle for
four years due to lack of funds, the
Home was running at full capacity.
Aid Given Home
Many people have helped keep it
in existence. The Auxiliary Board,
the San Francisco Community Chest,
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins, Mr. and Mrs.

Payson J. Treat, and many others
have aided the Home.
Stanford students have helped
too. But they are in an obvious po
sition to help. They have inherited,
in part, Dr. Gardner's 21-year vision
of helping the ill and undernour
ished of California's children.
Number Increases
The Home started by caring for 15
children, increased to 35, then to 72
last year, and now it cares for 80
children. It has a permanent staff of
23—11 graduate nurses, 2 house
mothers, 6 nurse helpers, 3 teachers,
and a superintendent.
Helping these permanent staff
members, students from Stanford's
Graduate School of Nursing come to
the Home to work.
The vision seen by Governor Stan
ford and Dr. Gardner is approaching
reality.
Governor Leland Stanford stood in
his living room looking out the wide
window of his home to the
green lawns that stretched out be
fore it.
Something about the peace and
freedom and the bright California
sun cheering the view he saw im
pressed him somehow.
He turned to his wife and said,
"Jane, we should make the children
of California our children." He vi
sioned California's children taken
out of crowded cities, out of squalid
neighborhoods and brought to a
place like his farm.

came to Stanford as chaplain years
later, he saw the same vision. The
