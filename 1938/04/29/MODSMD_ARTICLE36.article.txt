That conference swimming cham
pionship which Nort Thornton's
squad brought home last Saturday
wasn't exactly a novel accomplish
ment.
A glance at the record hooks
brought out thfc startling informa
tion that it was the nineteenth win
in 22 Coast meets for the Indians,
and the fourth in seven years for
Thornton. The same record sheet
divulged that Indian water polo
teams went 1!) years without a
loss to a college squad. The first
defeat tame in 1!).'12. Since then,
Thornton's watcrdogs have won
the conference four times, have
come in second twice, and third
once.
There may be some doubt as to
whether Coast swimmers are the
equal of those at Michigan, Yale, or
Ohio State. Since Stanford usually
sends only one or two men back for
the N.C.A.A. or A.A.U. meets every
year while the eastern schools are
always represented by full teams,
it isn't exactly fair to compare po
tentialities.
But look at the champs who have
worked under Thornton in his
short seven-year stretch.
There's Austin Clapp and Frank
Booth of Olympic Games fame;
Ted Wiget, N.C.A.A. champ in the
220 and 440 free style; Capt. Fred
Tebbet, American record holder in
the 50 and 400-meter hack stroke;
Johnny McKelvey, another N.C.
A.A. winner in \"{2. Incidentally,
Johnny held world's records in
the 40 and 50-yard free style,
swimming the 50 in :22.5. And
there was Capt. Boh Foster in '35
who held an American 440 breast
stroke mark, and Boh Clark, N. C.
A.A. .'lOO-yard medley titlest.
The list doesn't stop there, either.
This year Win Needham and Dave
Rider were All-Americans in the
440, with Rider swimming second
to Johnny Macionis of Yale for two
years in the N.C.A.A. 1500 meters.
Roy Winkleman has won the Coast
diving title for two years running
and is only a junior. Down on the
l'rosh squad you can find Bill Weed
en and Roy Vitousek who are a
cinch to break all the back stroke
and breast stroke marks in the con
ference books in another year.
So it looks like Thornton is a
fair sort of a coach. He was a
member of the 1928 intercollegiate
water polo champions as a Stan
ford undergrad, and started coach
ing in when Ernie Brandsten
became general director of water
activities and diving coach. M -h
of the credit necessarily f .-s to
Brandsten, who developeu Wink
and still advises Pete Desjardines,
the I!>2X Olympic springboard
champion.
Talk about your boy coaches all
you want, but the most boyish of
(hem all is Thornton. He's still go
ing to school with the rest of us five
mornings a week, and worries about
an ex as much as any of his squad
does.
Nort showed up at the Big Swim
with a flashy new suit and a fashion
able fedora and everybody thought
he was growing up. Then halfway
through the meet he disappeared,
showed up later in an old sweat
suit, that familiar white eyeshade,
and the Roos Brothers' megaphone.
He may be a kid and an easy go
ing guy, but we'll wager he's turned
out more champs and champion
ships for the size of his school than
any mentor on the Coast.
