## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Burrows Set For Mile Race In P.A. Meet Card Aces to Enter Berkeley Competition Tomorrow, 2 O'clock 
### 
Ed Burrows, biding his time until
he tangles with S.C.'s Louis Zam
perini a week from Saturday, will
in all probability enter the mile run
of the Pacific Association meet to
morrow at Berkeley.
Burrows will have against him
Jerry Lopes of Sacramento Junior
College, Marston "Mush" Girard of
San Mateo Junior College, Stan Sa
daj, who came to Cal from the
Honolulu army; and Charley Meh
lert, another Bear ace.
Dick Simpson and Bill Hawkins,
Farm timbertoppers, get a rematch
with Norman Hickerson and Tom
Moore, Cal and Olympic Club high
hurdlers, respectively, who have
each won victories from the Farm
duo.
Miller May Run
The possibility loomed today that
Coach Brutus Hamilton, Cal mentor,
might run Charley Miller, Bear half
miler, in the 440 Saturday. Miller is
the only runner in northern Califor
nia capable of extending Captain
Ray Malott in the one-lap sprint.
Stan Hiserman, Stanford sprinter,
has been working on his starts this
week and is gunning for another
match with Cal's Arnold Nutting.
However, Nutting might be kept out
of action in order to allow his al
leged injured leg to heal further.
Coach Templeton expects great
things of Stan Andersen, sophomore
football player and shot putter. An
dersen won in the Big Meet with a
heave just short of 50 feet and
should be consistently over the 50-
foot mark by the end of the season.
Ganahl in Two-Mile
Paul Ganahl will get a chance to
show that his third place in the two
mile over Cal's myriad of distance
stars was no fluke. Ganahl has
been improving steadily and with
the added confidence gained in his
great race last Saturday should be
among the best by the time of the
Pacific Coast Conference meet.
The team will make the trip to
Berkeley by bus. The meet will get
underway at 2 o'clock.
