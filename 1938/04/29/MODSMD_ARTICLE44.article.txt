# Frosh Golfers Find Pay-Dirt
## 
### 
Two frosh women stepped
wearily up to the tee of one of
the holes in the last nine on
the Stanford golf course yes
terday afternoon. They were
finding the game discouraging.
The first woman made her
usual weak, rolling drive. The
second Robleite began her
back-swing, expecting to do the
same. But this time she swung
harder than usual.
Her ball soared into the air,
for a change, and landed more
than a hundred yards away in a
clump of briers and bushes.
They both went off to look for
the lost ball and found it nestled
in between two stones with a
drifting of leaves over it. But it
wasn't alone. There were four
other balls hidden with it.
The women stopped playing
their depressing game of golf
then, started hunting, and came
home with 18 balls in good con
dition. seven more which could
still be used, and four—souve
nirs.
