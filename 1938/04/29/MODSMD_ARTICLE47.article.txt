# Grid Hopes Shine Brighter For Tiny
## 
### 
If Jakie Thompson, 164-pound center, continues to display the brand
of football he lias been showing in spring practice, Coach Tiny Thornhill
may not be so gloomy about the pivot post any more.
Tony Calvclli has been holding down the first string job and looks
like an All-American on defense, hut even the toughest linemen seem

to get hurt once in a while. Thomp
son is small and compact, looks
equally good on offense and defense,
and may win the second string job.
The end situation also brightened
considerably with the return of Jack
Clark and Neil Rasmussen. Clark
is still training in a sweat suit and
probably won't start heavy drills
until next week.
John Casey, the ex-J. C. flash,
finally broke away from track and
is now trying to angle himself into
a backfield berth. Yet what the
squad gained in Casey was lost in
Bill Paulman, whose game leg has
been giving him trouble again. It
is the second time in three weeks
that Paulman has been forced out by
a leg injury.
Two of the linemen, Dick Sutton,
guard, and Claude Purkitt, frosh
tackle, are nursing broken hand
bones. Both are continuing to run
signals and work in dummy scrim
mage although they are being kept
out of live contact drills.
Only other major change in the
lineup has been the shifting of Ilamp
Pool to right half from full and
quarter.
