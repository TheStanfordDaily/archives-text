# How the Other Half Lives

WITH this issue The Daily will print 24,000
copies which will be mailed to Stanford
alumni. That means the boys in the back shop
will use language they didn't learn in Sunday
school. But it also means that Students and
alumni will find out a little about each other.
If it can do anything to cultivate understand
ing between undergraduate and old grad, this
issue will be worth all the scorchingly Rab
elaisian comments that pressmen and circula
tion staff can think up. For until a few years
ago that understanding was a sort of legendary
dream, like stories about fairy godmothers, or
American government as taught in the seventh
grade. Even today the room for improvement
is large enough to jolt the astronomy profes
sors.
Relations between students and alumni have
been pleasant enough in most universities. But
until the last few years they were enveloped
in a cloud of confusion and misunderstanding
like something out of a modern psychological
novel.
As the sociology textbooks poini out, the
world is changing rapidly these days. And
there is always a difference between the col
lege the alumni knew and the one the students
are trying to shake loose from a diploma.
By the time the graduate gets settled in busi
ness and has made the down payment on a
house in the suburbs, a new generation is
whittling its initials beside his on the class
room desks. And so when the alumnus comes
back to see if the sandstone walls are holding
together properly, he finds different attitudes
and customs.
It isn't hard for the returning grad to get the
idea that modern students are fugitives from a
home for the feeble minded. And it often looks
as though undergraduates are treating the Uni
versity like a vending machine, putting in their
money and dispasisonately taking out their
education.
In th>s same way the student may see the
alumni as originals of the seven dwarfs—round
little men with nasty dispositions and beards
they tuck inside their vests. And many stu
dents get the impression that graduates do
nothing but complain about how the younger
generation is heading for damnation.
Recently these ideas have been breaking
down. Publicity services and University let
ters to alumni have helped. Personal contacts
between graduates and students have done
even more good. .
Alumni are finding that undergraduates may
differ from the old-timers, but that they are
fairly intelligent just the same. They are also
finding that red roofs, brown sandstone, and
arches receding into the distance have the same
emotional load for the student they have for
the graduate.
The students have discovered that the alumni
are not pickle-faced moralists with sidewhis
kers and spats. They find that the old boys
know what to do with a glass of beer, and that
they can swear at Econ I as though they had
flunked it yesterday.
With this to work on, students and alumni
are beginning to understand each other. An
encouraging thought like that should take some
of the heat out of the pressmen's comments
