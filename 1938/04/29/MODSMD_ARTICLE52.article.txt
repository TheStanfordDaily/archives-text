# Buck Up, Old Man

### 
WHEN Editor-for-a-day Zelver wrote his lit
tle essay in futility the other day, we were
a little mixed up as we tried to grasp his point.
Then campus-opinioner Botsford's counter-at
tack was just subtle enough to lead us further
astray. And "Johnny's" rebuttal to Botsford yes
terday got us completely off Zelver's trail.
Nor were we brought back by Zelver's re
turn to his cause on the same day. In fact, we
suspect that he, too, is a little confused by this
time. Since we'd like to clear up the whole

thing, the best we can do is to return to his
initial statement.
Evidently, Zelver, like the rest of us, hit a
slump. And, unlike the rest of us, he had a
chance to say something about it, and, in a
rather histrionic fashion, to do something about
it. As he warned us, he has quit The Daily in
favor of his birds, bees, and Beethoven.
This almost amounts to something noble.
Probably more than one of us envies his ini
tial attempt to kick over the traces and live his
own life, unbound by environment. But we
feel that should take a firm attitude. We
should say, as has been said to every bored
youth since the Ice Age, "Where would the
world be if everyone acted like that?"
The answer, unfortunately, is too obvious to
make the question valid. The world would get
along just fine.
But we can say this. Mr. Zelver seems to be
lieve that these "four, short expensive years"
are just an idyllic interlude between the first
shave and the first pay-check. They aren't. Or
if they are, Mr. Zelver should not be going to
Stanford, he should be spending his time va
cationing alternately at Lake Tahoe and Palm
Springs.
Stanford, academic as it necessarily is, does
have the purpose of training him for the rest of
his life. This training comes only partially from
the class-room; the rest is obtained from just
living and working with other people. The job
which Zelver had on The Daily- is, in a small
scale, like the job he will be spending the rest
of his life working at—whether it is plugging
away behind an office desk, or grinding out
novels for an unappreciative public.
He will become just as bored by these jobs
as he is with the studies he is forced into, and
his work on a college paper. But some day he
will have to learn that every rut is only as lim
ited as the capabilities of the man in it. If he
will step down from his Olympian perch for a
minute, he will find that he is not bored with
his university work as much as he is bored
with himself.
Certainly it is not worth-while wasting his
time here if he isn't getting anything in return.
But the point is that when the job becomes a
blind alley, he must rely on himself, on his
own powers, to open up that job into new po
tentialities. It can be done.
Evidently he hasn't yet learned this little
trick of lifting himself by his bootstraps. If not,
the university is the most painless place to
learn it. If he waits, as he seems to plan to do,
he'll find the rest of the world far less lenient
on the bored man than Stanford is.
Think it over, Zelver. And come on back.
All is forgiven.—J. S.
