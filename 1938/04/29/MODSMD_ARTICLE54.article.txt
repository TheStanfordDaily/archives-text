### 
KUDOS FOR THE OLD BOY
that Pcacc Day is over, and everyone has turned
to the absorbing problem of the exact identity of
The Man on the Valley Floor, it is perhaps too late to
re-awaken interest in the assembly on Wednesday, and
more particularly in the address of Old Boy Bob Hart
mann. Interstate cut-ups have monopolized attention,
and in the flurry of charge and counter-charge as to
just who went to sleep and refused to climb to Glacier
Point, the idealism of that earnest statement has by
now been long forgotten.
Nonetheless, the Old Boy's spccch deserved praise,
and praise it will get.
It suffered from the supposed weakness of not hav
ing anything "constructive" to offer. It made no at
tempt to present with robot-like emphasis a program
of boycott and sanction. It refrained from wandering
with embarrassing slowness from hither to yon and
back again. It was direct, to the point, idealistic, and
sincere. It was one man's opinion, and it had the enor
mous advantage of being presented with all the force
a heartfelt expression of personal belief can have.
The Old Boy did not bother with programs; he ad
mitted that he did not know the best way to achieve
peace. He asked for "peace among the peace-makers,"
and strongly criticized futility, even though he himself
forgot so far as to refer matter-of-factly to "the next
war." He stressed the most important fact of all, a fact
overlooked by so many: it is up to the individual. He
has the power; if he will say, "We shall have peace,"
then we shall have peace, and no amount of scare-talk
can ever bring about another war.
Every time one of its links gives in to the propa
ganda of the war-mongers, the chain of human freedom
grows that much weaker; every time "the next war"
appears with frightening calmness in the press, that
much nearer draws the day of an Armageddon that
could be stopped if the individual only had the guts
to stop it.
There were many who felt that the Old Boy "wasn't
very deep." Overlooking the fact that every concept,
political, moral, or economic, is dominated by and de
pendent upon the human factor, they preferred the
pyrotechnic "Now then's" of the dynamic Miss Strack.
They wanted blueprints for Utopia. They wanted
someone to tell them what to do. They were afraid to
think for themselves. They lacked the courage to make
the personal decision necessary for peace.
But they did, most of them, grant the Old Boy his
sincerity, and most of them liked and were impressed
by his speech. Rome burns, indeed; but the Old Boy
may rest assured that long after the Yosemite Snooze
has passed into the pages of history, his speech will be
remembered.
It may never do any good; but it will be there, a
fact; one of the finest facts in Farm history.â€”Allen
Drury.
