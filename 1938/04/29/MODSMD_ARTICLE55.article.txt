# CAMPUS OPINION
## PEACE OF COURSE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For at least one day, Peace Day,
StanfordHes were Exposed to the
fact that there is no single, sure
fire method of obtaining world
peace. In the words of your Asso
ciate Editors, "It appalled us to see
the confusion of opinions," and "No
one, reasoning clearly, can know the
answer." The gold-fish-bowl was
disturbed ever so little for ever so
short a while.
Today, nations and individuals of
the- world are being forced to make
decisions, the magnitude of* whose
good or error may not be recognized
in our generation. As Stanford stu
dents, our personal ability to eval
uate the psychological, political, and
economic elements influencing peace
would be greatly increased if the
gold-fish bowl were disturbed, not
one day in the year, but MWF 10
[sections dhrj (Staff) |s|.
A course in peace would give us a
better understanding of a matter
which is intensely vital and serious
to every one of us. The University
has the staff; the Hoover War Li
brary has an almost unparalleled
collection of significant material; and
surely such a course would be both
well-received and educationally ef
fective.
