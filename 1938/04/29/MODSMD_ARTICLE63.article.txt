# 'Old Timers' Meet Tops Homecoming
## Classes of Generation Ago Meet; '13 Holds 25th Anniversary 
### 
"Reminiscence, sociability and
heart-warming huddles" were the
three-fold objectives of Dr. Thomas
A. Storey in organizing the Old
Timers' Reunion, one of the high
light of last Saturday's University
Day.
Nearly 200 members of the classes
from 1802 to 1905 turned out for the
reunion in response to invitations
that had been sent to more than 2500
in the Old Timers' group. An "old
timer"is one whose class graduated
,iL least one generation—33 years —
ago.
I.'! Has Elaborate Time
Celebrating its 25th reunion, the
class of 1913 had an elaborately or
ganized good time which began with
an overnight stay at Francis Price's
hacienda in Santa Barbara and rolled
on to the campus by automobile and
special railroad car. Adopting white
tropical hats with the "13" numeral
painted both fore and aft, the '13-ers
kept their identity no secret from
the rest of the Stanford Family.
Third group to make a campus
date for University Day were the
c lasses of '22, '23, '24 and '25, mem
bers of which lunched together in
the Pavilion before the Big Meet.
And '()(» and '33
Classes of 190(5 and 1933, the latter
experiencing "that feeling" of hav
ing been five years oft the Quad,
were others holding organized re
unions.
Since the annual meeting of the
Alumni Association was held this
year in the comfortable Little Thea
ter of the new Memorial Hall, the
Union Court lost its former charac
ter as gathering place for all classes.
Instead, it was given over largely to
the Old Timers.
