## Lesley Investigates Tandem Propellers 
### 
Investigation of the characteristics j
of airplane propellers, stalled at 1
Stanford in 1916, has been carried J
on with practically no interruption I
since that time.
In 19.16-37 Professor E. P. Lesley ,
completed an extended research on
the performance of two-blade tan- !
dem propellers with opposite direc- j
tions of rotation as compared with
performance of a four-blade pro
peller. The results have been pub- |
lished as a confidential technical re- j
port by the National Advisory Com- ;
mittee for Aeronautics.
This year two further propeller re- j
searches are in progress. One is upon i
three-blade tandem propellers in ]
comparison with a six-blade pro- !
peller, and the other upon the effect j
of total blade area distribution be- I
tween two, three and four blades. In
addition to structural research by j
Professor A. S. Niles, work upon the |
torsional failure in columns of un
symmetrical cross-section is in pros- I
pect.
Besides research by members of
the laboratory staff, several investi- I
gations of interest and value have !
been carried out by graduate stu
dents. Among the most noteworthy
of these is "Air Propellers in Yaw"
by Stanley Moy and George F. Wor
lcv.
