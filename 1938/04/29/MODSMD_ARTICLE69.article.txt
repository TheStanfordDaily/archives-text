# Device Attempts Brain Wave Measurement

Measuring "brain - waves" by
means of delicate mechanisms that
capture and record electrical im
pulses given off by the brain is a
field of scientific investigation now
receiving some attention at Stanford.
The machine which Stanford in
vestigators are using in their work is
called an "electro-encephalograph."
Two such instruments have been
constructed in the electrical engi
neering laboratory under direction
of Professor F. E. Terman, head of
the electrical engineering depart
ment. William Hewlett, '34, a Stan
ford and M.I.T. graduate, built the
equipment.
Psychological Work
One electro-encephalograph is set
up in the psychology department for
experiments that are being con
ducted by Dr. John L. Kennedy, '34.
Dr. Kennedy is the Thomas Welton
Stanford Fellow in Psychic Research,
successor to the late Dr. John Edgar
Coover, who held the fellowship for
many years. .His experiments arc di
rected toward finding a possible re
lationship between the brain-waves
and attempted thought transference.
The electro-encephalograph am
plifies many millions of times the
electric impulses given off by the
brain when it is active. These ampli-

fied impulses register on a cathode
ray oscillograph as a flickering blue
line. This oscillating blue line is in
turn photographed on a strip of re
cording film. Result: Dr. Kennedy
can read the photographic record of
one's brain activity just as a stock
! broker reads the market chart.
Confusing Waves
Confusing to scientists is the fact
J that the brain during sleep appar
ently gives off stronger electrical
I impulses than it does during waking
j periods.
A subject for brain-wave measure
j ment Ls seated in a reclining chair,
i electrodes are adjusted to the head,
j and other electrodes are placed in
l the hands, in order to ground the
| circuit. The harnessed brain, now
| working for science and Dr. Ken
-1 r.edy, gives off electrical vibrations
| which the appartus amplifies a mil
i lion times in voltage. So great is the
amplification of power that it would
| be represented by 10 followed by 12
j zeros.
Work Difficult
"It is difficult," says Professor
Terman, "to construct an instrument
J that will amplify currents as low as
| those coming from the brain. They
j arc almost at the minimum strength
!of amplification. It is necessary to
remove everything that will obscure
the small vibrations. Low, random
noises must be eliminated. The am-
I plifiers have to go to low frequencies
I of one-quarter cycle per second."
The most recent electro-encep
| halograph built in the electrical en
gineering laboratory has been deliv
ered to Drs. Melvin R. Somers, '23,
and Pearl S. Pouppirt, '21, of San
Francisco. It is to be used for clin
ical investigations of brain tumors
1 and of brain behavior in epileptics.
