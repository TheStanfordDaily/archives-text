# Pre-Depression Pace Resumes
## Lower Division Has Long Waiting List 
### 
Stanford is resuming the pace of
the days before the depression.
The salary roll of the faculty is
still on a 95 per cent basis and the
income of the University markedly
reduced, but the increasing number
of students applying for admission
to the Lower Division has led to a
long waiting list, and the academic
spirit and activity is keener than
it has been for several years.
For the first time since 1932, the
admission of Lower Division stu
dents was on a competitive basis in
1936.
In 1933 and 1934-35, all qualified
candidates were admitted. This con
dition is reflected in a decrease of
the number "surviving" in the Uni
versity after two years. During these
years, an average of only about 56
per cent of entering freshmen was
still registered in the University at
the end of the sophomore year.
Contrasted with this, at the be
ginning of 1933 (up to which time
the competitive basis of entrance had
been maintained by the University)
there was a "survival" of 70 per cent
of the entering freshmen at the end
of the sophomore year.
But for 1936 and 1937 many more
applicants have met entrance re
quirements than could be admitted,
thus restoring the competitive basis
of entrance and again raising the
"survival" percentage of students.
Of the class entering the University
in 1935, only 20 per cent have
dropped from the University.
Reasons for dropping out are per
sonal, health and financial as well
as scholastic.
