# Wilbur Tells Problems Of University
## Future of Private Colleges Is Subject Of President's Speech 
### RAY LYMAN WILBUR 
The future of the privately en- !
dowed university was the subject of I
a talk by President Wilbur before a I
meeting of Stanford alumni at Bak- '
crsfield, April 19. Following is a I
summary of his remarks prepared i
by Dr. Wilbur for this edition of
The Daily.—Editor.

We are inclined 1o take our great
universities more or less for grant
ed. Wc find them as established in
stitutions occupying a high position
in the life about us. Their very size
and their great activity have made
them sensitive t<* the remarkable
changes that have been going on in
the last few decades.
While the university has a long
life it turns over fast. The ordinary
university generation lasts about
four years.
This makes it necessary for the
university to respond to everything j
that is going on in the environment!
and to prepare those who come to it
for the uncertain years ahead.
Conserve Knowledge
Universities have great demands
upon them to conserve all accredited
knowledge, to build up great libra
ries. museums and laboratories, and
to transmit the accumulated knowl
edge of the human race to succes
sive generations of students. The
university must rely upon the
"voice of experience" although it. is
constantly, through research, seek
ing new facts and new methods.
Insofar as the student is con
j cerned, its real responsibility is to
I develop in him what can be called
a usable mind, that is, a trained mind
that can respond to the inevitable
changes that come with life and that
| are now coming faster than ever bc
| fore.
| Al the very time when the calls
i on the university arc the greatest in
its history, when longer training is
required to meet the needs of our
civilization, the productive funds of
the universities have decreased in
value, the income has diminished
materially, and the costs have in
creased. Stanford University has
suffered as have the others. Our
income from endowment has been
reduced about $:500,000.
I am one of those who believe that
the support of such institutions as
Stanford, a great, privately endowed
university, is of vital significance in
a period in which the influence of
government is becoming more dom
inating and imperious.
Center For Thought
The university is a testing and
germinating center for new thought
and new facts, and an instrument for
carrying over from one generation to
the next the accumulated informa
tion of the world.
To do this, its faculty must have
freedom of thought, freedom of re
search, and freedom of expression.
We must have centers of thought
and progress that arc outside of any
possible political domination. The
benefits obtained from such a foun
dation as Stanford depend more
upon freedom and elasticity than
upon the actual amount of the en
dowment funds.
Stop for a moment and think what
California would be without its
universities and colleges, or what
I the United States would be without
its institutions of higher learning.
Yet all of these institutions are ex
pensive, and they require a con
stant increase in the funds for their
support.
Every privately endowed institu
tion must grow, or it becomes more
lor less defunct and ineffective. The
requirement of steady growth for
universities is as essential as it is for
a child.
This constant growth is necessary
so that universities may undergo
evolution in their constant services
to the present and in their constant
preparations for the future.
Nearly all men and women of
capacity develop margins which they
can use for the public good. This
can t.'ike the form of either funds or
services. The support of the pri
vately endowed universities is one
of the best ways to use these mar
gins for public good.
Stanford, like other similar insti
tutions is gaining the support of
the public. We have been averaging
between $1000 to $2000 a day from
our friends for all sorts of university
activities.
We get some comfort from the
play "You Can't Take It With You."
We realize that many of our
thoughtful citizens will leave their
funds for charitable or educalional
purposes and that the privately en
dowed university will be helped in
this way.
We feel justified in bringing the
claims of oui universities to public
attention, since more and better edu
cation i.' being demanded by the
way in which our nation and our
state are being developed.
Without, more adequate funds we
cannot, play our full part and do
what we consider our full duty. We
would like 1.0 have as many as pos
sible of our citizens join in the effort
to help the universities to maintain
leadership ir the changes that are
constantly going on in sociology,
finance, science, literature, and art.

vately endowed universities is one
of the best ways to use these mar
gins for public good.
Stanford, like other similar insti
tutions is gaining the support of
the public. We have been averaging
between $1000 to $2000 a day from
our friends for all sorts of university
activities.
We get some comfort from the
play "You Can't Take It With You."
We realize that many of our
thoughtful citizens will leave their
funds for charitable or educalional
purposes and that the privately en
dowed university will be helped in
this way.
We feel justified in bringing the
claims of oui universities to public
attention, since more and better edu
cation i.' being demanded by the
way in which our nation and our
state are being developed.
Without, more adequate funds we
cannot, play our full part and do
what we consider our full duty. We
would like 1.0 have as many as pos
sible of our citizens join in the effort
to help the universities to maintain
leadership ir the changes that are
constantly going on in sociology,
finance, science, literature, and art.
The future of the privately en- !
dowed university was the subject of I
a talk by President Wilbur before a I
meeting of Stanford alumni at Bak- '
crsfield, April 19. Following is a I
summary of his remarks prepared i
by Dr. Wilbur for this edition of
The Daily.—Editor.

We are inclined 1o take our great
universities more or less for grant
ed. Wc find them as established in
stitutions occupying a high position
in the life about us. Their very size
and their great activity have made
them sensitive t<* the remarkable
changes that have been going on in
the last few decades.
While the university has a long
life it turns over fast. The ordinary
university generation lasts about
four years.
This makes it necessary for the
university to respond to everything j
that is going on in the environment!
and to prepare those who come to it
for the uncertain years ahead.
Conserve Knowledge
Universities have great demands
upon them to conserve all accredited
knowledge, to build up great libra
ries. museums and laboratories, and
to transmit the accumulated knowl
edge of the human race to succes
sive generations of students. The
university must rely upon the
"voice of experience" although it. is
constantly, through research, seek
ing new facts and new methods.
Insofar as the student is con
j cerned, its real responsibility is to
I develop in him what can be called
a usable mind, that is, a trained mind
that can respond to the inevitable
changes that come with life and that
| are now coming faster than ever bc
| fore.
| Al the very time when the calls
i on the university arc the greatest in
its history, when longer training is
required to meet the needs of our
civilization, the productive funds of
the universities have decreased in
value, the income has diminished
materially, and the costs have in
creased. Stanford University has
suffered as have the others. Our
income from endowment has been
reduced about $:500,000.
I am one of those who believe that
the support of such institutions as
Stanford, a great, privately endowed
university, is of vital significance in
a period in which the influence of
government is becoming more dom
inating and imperious.
Center For Thought
The university is a testing and
germinating center for new thought
and new facts, and an instrument for
carrying over from one generation to
the next the accumulated informa
tion of the world.
To do this, its faculty must have
freedom of thought, freedom of re
search, and freedom of expression.
We must have centers of thought
and progress that arc outside of any
possible political domination. The
benefits obtained from such a foun
dation as Stanford depend more
upon freedom and elasticity than
upon the actual amount of the en
dowment funds.
Stop for a moment and think what
California would be without its
universities and colleges, or what
I the United States would be without
its institutions of higher learning.
Yet all of these institutions are ex
pensive, and they require a con
stant increase in the funds for their
support.
Every privately endowed institu
tion must grow, or it becomes more
lor less defunct and ineffective. The
requirement of steady growth for
universities is as essential as it is for
a child.
This constant growth is necessary
so that universities may undergo
evolution in their constant services
to the present and in their constant
preparations for the future.
Nearly all men and women of
capacity develop margins which they
can use for the public good. This
can t.'ike the form of either funds or
services. The support of the pri
vately endowed universities is one
of the best ways to use these mar

search, and freedom of expression.
We must have centers of thought
and progress that arc outside of any
possible political domination. The
benefits obtained from such a foun
dation as Stanford depend more
upon freedom and elasticity than
upon the actual amount of the en
dowment funds.
Stop for a moment and think what
California would be without its
universities and colleges, or what
I the United States would be without
its institutions of higher learning.
Yet all of these institutions are ex
pensive, and they require a con
stant increase in the funds for their
support.
Every privately endowed institu
tion must grow, or it becomes more
lor less defunct and ineffective. The
requirement of steady growth for
universities is as essential as it is for
a child.
This constant growth is necessary
so that universities may undergo
evolution in their constant services
to the present and in their constant
preparations for the future.
Nearly all men and women of
capacity develop margins which they
can use for the public good. This
can t.'ike the form of either funds or
services. The support of the pri
vately endowed universities is one
of the best ways to use these mar
gins for public good.
Stanford, like other similar insti
tutions is gaining the support of
the public. We have been averaging
between $1000 to $2000 a day from
our friends for all sorts of university
activities.
We get some comfort from the
play "You Can't Take It With You."
We realize that many of our
thoughtful citizens will leave their
funds for charitable or educalional
purposes and that the privately en
dowed university will be helped in
this way.
We feel justified in bringing the
claims of oui universities to public
attention, since more and better edu
cation i.' being demanded by the
way in which our nation and our
state are being developed.
Without, more adequate funds we
cannot, play our full part and do
what we consider our full duty. We
would like 1.0 have as many as pos
sible of our citizens join in the effort
to help the universities to maintain
leadership ir the changes that are
constantly going on in sociology,
finance, science, literature, and art.
The future of the privately en- !
dowed university was the subject of I
a talk by President Wilbur before a I
meeting of Stanford alumni at Bak- '
crsfield, April 19. Following is a I
summary of his remarks prepared i
by Dr. Wilbur for this edition of
The Daily.—Editor.

We are inclined 1o take our great
universities more or less for grant
ed. Wc find them as established in
stitutions occupying a high position
in the life about us. Their very size
and their great activity have made
them sensitive t<* the remarkable
changes that have been going on in
the last few decades.
While the university has a long
life it turns over fast. The ordinary
university generation lasts about
four years.
This makes it necessary for the
university to respond to everything j
that is going on in the environment!
and to prepare those who come to it
for the uncertain years ahead.
Conserve Knowledge
Universities have great demands
upon them to conserve all accredited
knowledge, to build up great libra
ries. museums and laboratories, and
to transmit the accumulated knowl
edge of the human race to succes
sive generations of students. The
university must rely upon the
"voice of experience" although it. is
constantly, through research, seek
ing new facts and new methods.
Insofar as the student is con
j cerned, its real responsibility is to
I develop in him what can be called
a usable mind, that is, a trained mind
that can respond to the inevitable
changes that come with life and that
| are now coming faster than ever bc
| fore.
| Al the very time when the calls
i on the university arc the greatest in
its history, when longer training is
required to meet the needs of our
civilization, the productive funds of
the universities have decreased in
value, the income has diminished
materially, and the costs have in
creased. Stanford University has
suffered as have the others. Our
income from endowment has been
reduced about $:500,000.
I am one of those who believe that
the support of such institutions as
Stanford, a great, privately endowed
university, is of vital significance in
a period in which the influence of
government is becoming more dom
inating and imperious.
Center For Thought
The university is a testing and
germinating center for new thought
and new facts, and an instrument for
carrying over from one generation to
the next the accumulated informa
tion of the world.
To do this, its faculty must have
freedom of thought, freedom of re
search, and freedom of expression.
We must have centers of thought
and progress that arc outside of any
possible political domination. The
benefits obtained from such a foun
dation as Stanford depend more
upon freedom and elasticity than
upon the actual amount of the en
dowment funds.
Stop for a moment and think what
