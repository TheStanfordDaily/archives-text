# Wilbur Tells Problems Of University
## Future of Private Colleges Is Subject Of President's Speech 
### RAY LYMAN WILBUR 
The future of the privately en- !
dowed university was the subject of I
a talk by President Wilbur before a I
meeting of Stanford alumni at Bak- '
crsfield, April 19. Following is a I
summary of his remarks prepared i
by Dr. Wilbur for this edition of
The Daily.—Editor.

We are inclined 1o take our great
universities more or less for grant
ed. Wc find them as established in
stitutions occupying a high position
in the life about us. Their very size
and their great activity have made
them sensitive t<* the remarkable
changes that have been going on in
the last few decades.
While the university has a long
life it turns over fast. The ordinary
university generation lasts about
four years.
This makes it necessary for the
university to respond to everything j
that is going on in the environment!
and to prepare those who come to it
for the uncertain years ahead.
Conserve Knowledge
Universities have great demands
upon them to conserve all accredited
knowledge, to build up great libra
ries. museums and laboratories, and
to transmit the accumulated knowl
edge of the human race to succes
sive generations of students. The
university must rely upon the
"voice of experience" although it. is
constantly, through research, seek
ing new facts and new methods.
Insofar as the student is con
j cerned, its real responsibility is to
I develop in him what can be called
a usable mind, that is, a trained mind
that can respond to the inevitable
changes that come with life and that
| are now coming faster than ever bc
| fore.
| Al the very time when the calls
i on the university arc the greatest in
its history, when longer training is
required to meet the needs of our
civilization, the productive funds of
the universities have decreased in
value, the income has diminished
materially, and the costs have in
creased. Stanford University has
suffered as have the others. Our
income from endowment has been
reduced about $:500,000.
I am one of those who believe that
the support of such institutions as
Stanford, a great, privately endowed
university, is of vital significance in
a period in which the influence of
government is becoming more dom
inating and imperious.
Center For Thought
The university is a testing and
germinating center for new thought
and new facts, and an instrument for
carrying over from one generation to
the next the accumulated informa
tion of the world.
To do this, its faculty must have
freedom of thought, freedom of re
search, and freedom of expression.
We must have centers of thought
and progress that arc outside of any
possible political domination. The
benefits obtained from such a foun
dation as Stanford depend more
upon freedom and elasticity than
upon the actual amount of the en
dowment funds.
Stop for a moment and think what
California would be without its
universities and colleges, or what
I the United States would be without
its institutions of higher learning.
Yet all of these institutions are ex
pensive, and they require a con
stant increase in the funds for their
support.
Every privately endowed institu
tion must grow, or it becomes more
lor less defunct and ineffective. The
requirement of steady growth for
universities is as essential as it is for
a child.
