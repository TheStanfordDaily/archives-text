## Constitution Permits Wider Participation 
### 
Adoption of a new constitution and
an "assembly plan" of representa
tion for Stanford's 90 alumni clubs
throughout the world, will enable
graduates and former students to
embark on an ambitious activity
program which should reach its
height by 1941—Stanford's Golden
Anniversary—according to Robert A.
Hamilton, secretary of the Alumni
Association.
The constitution was adopted of
ficially at the annual meeting of the
association held on University Day,
Saturday, April 23. It provides for
direct representation of clubs and
classes through an Alumni Assem
bly which will meet on the campus
at least once a year.
Representation
Classes from 1892 to 1938 and each
succeeding year thereafter will auto
matically be allowed one represen
tative *in the Assembly while or
ganized groups, including the 90
clubs throughout the world, the
Stanford Law and Medical Societies
and Stanford Associates, will be per
mitted from one to three represen
tatives, depending upon the number
of Alumni Association members in
each organization.
The new constitution was pre
pared after more than two years of
deliberation by Judge Homer L.
Spence, '13, chairman, and a com
mittee consisting of Francis V. Kces
ling, '98; Henry L. Loud, '13; Her
bert Silvius, '2(>; Mrs. Minerva Mur
ray Skclton, '20; Ford M. Tussing,
'23; Dean Mary Yost; and Clifford

Hamilton Optimistic
'The Assembly will be composed
of approximately 150 men and wom
en," Secretary Hamilton pointed out.
"It will be representative of every
geographical area and every Stan
ford generation and wc arc most op
timistic in our belief that it will give
us a genuine sounding board for
alumni opinion and alumni planning,
The present growth of the Alumni
Association to a membership of more
than 8.000 has been highly gratify
ing, for it has proven to us that, by
putting 'old grads' to work for the
growth and betterment of our Uni
versity, we can make this phrase
'Stanford Loyalty' signify more than
a flourishing gesture."
The first meeting of the assembly
will be held on the campus on Uni
versity Day, 1939. Meantime, ac
cording to Hamilton, every club
throughout the United States will
plan its representation and the poli
cies it proposes to put before the
new legislative body.

'The Assembly will be composed
of approximately 150 men and wom
en," Secretary Hamilton pointed out.
"It will be representative of every
geographical area and every Stan
ford generation and wc arc most op
timistic in our belief that it will give
us a genuine sounding board for
alumni opinion and alumni planning,
The present growth of the Alumni
Association to a membership of more
than 8.000 has been highly gratify
ing, for it has proven to us that, by
putting 'old grads' to work for the
growth and betterment of our Uni
versity, we can make this phrase
'Stanford Loyalty' signify more than
a flourishing gesture."
The first meeting of the assembly
will be held on the campus on Uni
versity Day, 1939. Meantime, ac
cording to Hamilton, every club
throughout the United States will
plan its representation and the poli
cies it proposes to put before the
new legislative body.
Adoption of a new constitution and
an "assembly plan" of representa
tion for Stanford's 90 alumni clubs
throughout the world, will enable
graduates and former students to
embark on an ambitious activity
program which should reach its
height by 1941—Stanford's Golden
Anniversary—according to Robert A.
Hamilton, secretary of the Alumni
Association.
The constitution was adopted of
ficially at the annual meeting of the
association held on University Day,
Saturday, April 23. It provides for
direct representation of clubs and
classes through an Alumni Assem
bly which will meet on the campus
at least once a year.
Representation
Classes from 1892 to 1938 and each
succeeding year thereafter will auto
matically be allowed one represen
tative *in the Assembly while or
ganized groups, including the 90
clubs throughout the world, the
Stanford Law and Medical Societies
and Stanford Associates, will be per
mitted from one to three represen
tatives, depending upon the number
of Alumni Association members in
each organization.
The new constitution was pre
pared after more than two years of
deliberation by Judge Homer L.
Spence, '13, chairman, and a com
mittee consisting of Francis V. Kces
ling, '98; Henry L. Loud, '13; Her
bert Silvius, '2(>; Mrs. Minerva Mur
ray Skclton, '20; Ford M. Tussing,
'23; Dean Mary Yost; and Clifford
Burnhill, '29, president of the Alum
ni Association.
