# Stanford Grows--Three Buildings Constructed in Last Five Years
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
Progress on the Farm in the build
l ing and construction line has been
i particularly heavy in the past half
| decade. Three entirely new and
, complete structures have been
i erected, including Lagunita Court,
! the Memorial Hall, and the Cftbber
ley Building. The old Assembly Hall
was completely remodeled; work on
I the physical education facilities was
j undertaken, and considerable other
work went on.
Construction of the Cubbcrley
Building, the newest of them all, is
| still in progress. To house the edu
; cation department, the three-floor
! structure has forged ahead in spite
| of last quarter's rainy spell.
Cubbcrley Gives Funds
Donated by Dr. and Mrs. Ellwood
! P. Cubberley, funds for the build
| ing, including furniture and equip
j ment, are expected to run close to
$600,000. Dr. Cubberley, with the
' faculty for nearly 30 years, is former
dean of the Stanford School of Edu
cation.
Final touches on the building are
cxpected sometime during the early
summer, but actual dedication date
I is to be June G, Dr. Cubberley's
! birthday.
Another of the major campus con
! structions of the last half decade is
I the mecca of all Hall women, La-
I gunita Court. Work on this assign
ment was perhaps the fastest of all

[ recent construction. Ground was
! broken in January of 1934, and with
weather and building conditions per
fect, the court was ready for occu
pancy in October of the same year.
Two more courts were added in the
! summer of 1937.
Theater Completed
Memorial Hall, home of Western
Civ lectures, met with considerable
delay in the process of building.
| Construction lasted more than a year,
j was hailed several times by bad
weather and steel strikes.
In June of 1937 the building was
; near enough to completion to allow
its use during the summer session.
Final touches were added during off
periods of occupancy.
By making the new Memorial Hall
I available for student use, the old
i Assembly Hall on the main quad
„was left vacant for reconstruction,
j Work was opened on June 9, 1937,
and the completed edifice was ready
| for use by fall quarter.
The balcony that had held so many
| pleasant memories for the one-time
Stanford rough was torn out com
pletely. The main floor followed its
; upstairs neighbor, and a structural
! .steel frame was laid. Today the
| entire Graduate School of Business
I is housed in the structure.
Largest construction job outside of
1 (he quad was the building of the
i Lawrence Frost Memorial Amphi
• theater, donated by Mr. and Mrs.

Howard Frost in memory of their
son, once a Stanford student.
Construction began in the fall of
'36, and through the spring of the
following year developed into a race
to get it ready for the Commence
ment services of that year.
Construction and improvement of
athletic facilities in the near pasl is
climaxed by the entire rebuilding of
Angel 1 Field in 1935 at a cost of ap
proximately $25,000. Another major
bit of construction was the replace
ment of the seats in the stadium in
1036.
During the past year the varsity
tennis courts have been resurfaced,
and three new intramural fields have
been completed.

Cubbcrley Gives Funds
Donated by Dr. and Mrs. Ellwood

$600,000. Dr. Cubberley, with the
' faculty for nearly 30 years, is former
dean of the Stanford School of Edu

Final touches on the building are

Another of the major campus con

I the mecca of all Hall women, La-
I gunita Court. Work on this assign

[ recent construction. Ground was

weather and building conditions per
fect, the court was ready for occu
pancy in October of the same year.
Two more courts were added in the
! summer of 1937.
Theater Completed
Memorial Hall, home of Western
Civ lectures, met with considerable
delay in the process of building.
| Construction lasted more than a year,
j was hailed several times by bad
weather and steel strikes.
In June of 1937 the building was
; near enough to completion to allow
its use during the summer session.
Final touches were added during off
periods of occupancy.
By making the new Memorial Hall
I available for student use, the old
i Assembly Hall on the main quad
„was left vacant for reconstruction,
j Work was opened on June 9, 1937,
and the completed edifice was ready

The balcony that had held so many
| pleasant memories for the one-time
Stanford rough was torn out com
pletely. The main floor followed its
; upstairs neighbor, and a structural

I is housed in the structure.
Largest construction job outside of

Construction began in the fall of

following year developed into a race
to get it ready for the Commence

Construction and improvement of
athletic facilities in the near pasl is

1036.
During the past year the varsity
tennis courts have been resurfaced,
and three new intramural fields have
been completed.
Progress on the Farm in the build
l ing and construction line has been
