# Stanford Men Fight Against Poliomyelitis
## Four Researchers Find New Paralysis Immunity Method 
### 
Stanford's bacteriologists, under
the leadership of Dr. Edwin W.
Schultz, have for years been in the
vanguard of an army of American
researchers waging war on infantile
paralysis. Within the past two weeks
has came news which, when lully
spelled out, may signal a substantia
victory over the disease that scourges
and withers childhood, youth, and
manhood.
If the new discovery bears out its
promise, it will mean that crowded
cities in which infantile paralysis
outbreaks occur will no longer be the
prey of dread.
Four Carry on Research
The discovery which foreshadows
this hopeful possibility is the work
ol four researchers at the Stanford
medical school, Doctors Lee Shahin
itin, J. A. Bacher, R. C. McNaught,
and R. R. Newell.
What the four men have found is
a simple, thorough method of intro
ducing a 1 per cent solution of zinc
sulphate into the nostrils of a child
or adult so that it finds its way far
up in the nasal passage of the olfac
tory area.
The olfactory area is the portal
through which the invisible poli
omyelitis virus enters the human
nervous system to do its deadly
work. It finds its way into the little,
hair-like olfactory processes that lie
in the nasal mucosa. â€¢
From these nerve-ends, the virus
travels from one level of the nervous
system to another, probably inside
of the neurons themselves, "like a
mouse scurrying along inside a
drainpipe," in Dr. Schultz' phrase.
Because this is the route the virus
takes, immunity built up in the blood
stream by the introduction of serum
cannot be effective, for the anti
bodies in the blood do not have a
chance to combat the virus. They
are, as Dr. Schultz expresses it, like
the eat that cannot follow the mouse
through the drain pipe.
First Trials Fail
Having turned reluctantly from
their hope of obtaining an immuniz
ing agent through which persons
could be protected against infantile
paralysis as they are against small
pox, Dr. Schultz and his assistant,
Dr. L. P. Gebhardt, learned about a
year ago that zinc sulphate would
confer a temporary protection on
monkeys against poliomyelitis in
fection.
Their news was excitedly received
by the medical world, and last sum
j mer, during an outbreak of the
J disease in the province of Ontario,
I Canada, attempts were made on a
| large scale to establish whether zinc
! sulphate would ward ofT the disease
1 from 5000 Toronto school children to
j whom it was administered. Al
! though the best-known techniques
were used for administering the zinc
sulphate solution to the olfactory
j area, the experiment fell short ol
I proving or disproving the worth of

Dr. Schultz' discovery.
This was due, as the Stanford
Medical School researchers later j
reasoned, to the fact that the solu
tion was not reaching the olfactory
area in all the children to whom it
was administered.

What the Stanford Medical group
found is that by placing the child's
(or adult's) head straight down, the
solution can be effectively introduced
by a medicine dropper through the
nostrils so that it completely covers
the olfactory area.
