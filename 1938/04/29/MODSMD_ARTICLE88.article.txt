# Leo Had for Music, Farnsworth Finds
## 
### 
Because he plays the violin and
was born on the 15th of August, un
cle! - the zodiacal sign of Leo, the Lion,
Professor Paul R. Farnsworth of the
psychology department became in
terested in a problem.
The problem, scientifically stated,
was: "Is there any validity to the
claim that certain signs cif the zodiac
are especially propitious for the birth
of persons with marked esthetic ca
pacities?"
Into Astrology
In search of an answer to his own
question, Professor Farnsworth made
an excursion into the lield of astrol
ogy, that ancient science which is no
longer admitted to the universities
of the world, but which still brings
profitable book, newspaper and
magazine loyalties and lecture fees
to its modern practitioners.
Six books on astrology were con
sulted. They agreed, fairly generally,
that Libra (September 24 to Octo
ber 23) is an artistic sign. Five of
the books went on to insist that it
was a musical sign.
We'll Check
"All right,' said Professor Farns
worth, possibly a bit miffed because
his own sign, Leo the Lion, had been
mentioned as musical by only one
astrological textbook, "we'll check
up."

lie and his assistants, Miss Eleanor |
Jansen, Mi.-s Betty Davis and C. Hor
ton, turned to Pierre Key's "Musical j
Who's Who." They chose the names ;
of 1498 bona fide musicians and ar- i
ranged them according to the signs '
of the zodiac under which they were '
born. The keen edge of statistics!
never cut a theory or claim more j
thoroughly to ribbons: instead of be
ing out in front, Libra was in a tie ,
with Scorpio (the Scorpion) for last
place.
Behind Eight Ball
That is, fewer musicians were born i
under Libra (and Scorpio) than un- !
der any of the other sign of the,
zodiac. Musically speaking, to be j
born under Libra is practically to be 1
born under the eight-ball.
The greatest proportion of the mu- j
sicians, 9.9 per cent, were born un- ]
der Capricorn (December 22-Janu- !
ary 21), and only 7.2 per cent were,
born under Libra. Statistically and !
neatly arranged, the zodiacal-musical!
correlation looks like this:

"The data of this study," concludes â– 
Professor Farnsworth, "give no sup- j
port to the astrological claims as they I
refer to musical capacities. In fact, I
the astrologers played into bad luck
in agreeing on a most unmusical '
sign."
