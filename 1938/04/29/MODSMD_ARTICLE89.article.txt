Prolessor Ernest R. Hilgard of the j
psychology department, assisted by
Lloyd G. Humphreys, Abraham
Rosenberg research fellow in psy- |
chology, has recently conducted ex- |
periments in conditioned reflexes in
human beings.
A subject is seated at an apparatus j
which blows a puff of air at the eye
and at the same time flashes a light. !
This causes an eyelid reflex, which j
is measured to the thousandth of a
second by an instrument called a j
"pendulum - photochronograph." In
the course of time, the Stanford re
searches have shown, the flashing :
of the light alone, without the annoy- [
ing puff of air, will cause the reflex j
in the subject's eyelid.
