# Doctors Go Down Old Oxygen Road With Ed
## 
### 
Edson Burrows can run the mile
and two-mile in record time, as he
proved last Saturday, but his per
formance can be explained by physi
ologists in scientific terms.
In fact, the Stanford physiology
department is so much interested in
what makes Burrows a runner that
it is preparing a series of experi
ments fox* testing from 50 to 100
Stanford athletes to determine their
capacity for work.
"Work" is used in the physiolog
ical, not the Dink Templeton, sense.
Burrows, as Craig Taylor, graduate
student in physiology, explains, is a
great runner because his "steady
stale" work-capacity is high. He is
physiologically able to reach and re
main in a "steady state" which is a
bit beyond the capacity of most ath
letes to achieve.
Goes Into 'Debt'
In the sprint to the tape, he in
creases his stride and goes into
"debt" for the difference between
the amount of oxygen he is able to
breathe in and the amount demand
ed by his increased effort. If the final
sprint is correctly gauged, he will
reach the tape at the point when his
oxygen "debt" reaches the maximum.
The debt is then repaid after the
race is over.
Taylor, although he has never run
the two-mile himself, has his own
theories of long-distance running
ability.
"It seems to be true of these long
distance runners," he says, "that ox
ygen consumption is one of the big
factors in their ability. What deter
mines their success on the track is
not just muscular condition, but
what I call 'organic fitness'—vital or

' gans working together, heart,, res
piration. chemistry of the cells, and
the blood all functioning in harmony
I —this is what permits one individ
; ual, like Burrows, to sustain a higher
work output than another indivi
dual."
All of these speculations about the
; distance races will perhaps be proved
or disproved in the course of time.
Taylor has plans for bringing ath
letes into his laboratory and giving
them workouts on one of the Uni
versity's oddest looking contraptions
' —the bicycle "ergometer." This ap
paratus consists of a bicycle frame
with driving chain connected to a
] sprocket which turns a dynamome
! ter, or electric brake. The dynamom-
I eter registers how much horsepower
| is being put into the pedals by the
I man on the bicycle.
Ergometer Test
Over the bicycle rider's head is
placed a copper helmet looking
something like a diver's helmet. A
flow of air through the helmet sup
plies the bicyclist, and the exhausted
air from his lungs is piped away,
measured for oxygen depletion and
carbon dioxide production. Results of
a 45-minute pedaling test on the
j bicycle ergometer, performed by
Robert Morris, graduate student
headed for an M.A. in physiology,
i show the following:
Air breathed, 20 gallons per min
i ute; heart rate, 195 beats per minute;
blood flow, 7'4 gallons through the
heart per minute; work output, 8000
| foot pounds per minute, or ' 4 horse
power.
The physiology people think that's
I a pretty good mark for Burrows to
! try to beat.

Ergometer Test
Over the bicycle rider's head is
placed a copper helmet looking
something like a diver's helmet. A
flow of air through the helmet sup
plies the bicyclist, and the exhausted
air from his lungs is piped away,
measured for oxygen depletion and
carbon dioxide production. Results of
a 45-minute pedaling test on the
j bicycle ergometer, performed by
Robert Morris, graduate student
headed for an M.A. in physiology,
i show the following:
Air breathed, 20 gallons per min
i ute; heart rate, 195 beats per minute;
blood flow, 7'4 gallons through the
heart per minute; work output, 8000
| foot pounds per minute, or ' 4 horse
power.
The physiology people think that's
I a pretty good mark for Burrows to
! try to beat.
Edson Burrows can run the mile
and two-mile in record time, as he
proved last Saturday, but his per
formance can be explained by physi
ologists in scientific terms.
In fact, the Stanford physiology
department is so much interested in
what makes Burrows a runner that
it is preparing a series of experi
ments fox* testing from 50 to 100
Stanford athletes to determine their
capacity for work.
"Work" is used in the physiolog
ical, not the Dink Templeton, sense.
Burrows, as Craig Taylor, graduate
student in physiology, explains, is a
great runner because his "steady
stale" work-capacity is high. He is
physiologically able to reach and re
main in a "steady state" which is a
bit beyond the capacity of most ath
letes to achieve.
Goes Into 'Debt'
In the sprint to the tape, he in
creases his stride and goes into
"debt" for the difference between
the amount of oxygen he is able to
breathe in and the amount demand
ed by his increased effort. If the final
sprint is correctly gauged, he will
reach the tape at the point when his
oxygen "debt" reaches the maximum.
The debt is then repaid after the
race is over.
Taylor, although he has never run
the two-mile himself, has his own
theories of long-distance running
ability.
"It seems to be true of these long
distance runners," he says, "that ox
ygen consumption is one of the big
factors in their ability. What deter
mines their success on the track is
not just muscular condition, but
what I call 'organic fitness'—vital or

' gans working together, heart,, res
piration. chemistry of the cells, and
the blood all functioning in harmony
I —this is what permits one individ
; ual, like Burrows, to sustain a higher
work output than another indivi
dual."
All of these speculations about the
; distance races will perhaps be proved
or disproved in the course of time.

letes into his laboratory and giving
