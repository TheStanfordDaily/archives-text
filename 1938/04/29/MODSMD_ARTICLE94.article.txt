# Conference Slated On Photochemistry
## 
### 
Photochemistry, the .study of
chemical reactions produced by
light, is a field of science so vast and
complex that admittedly no one man
understands all its implications and
ramifications. This is the reason for
holding a Stanford Summer Re
search Conference in Chemistry on
the campus, August 8 to 12, at which
a dozen or more of the leading pho
tochemists in the country will
gather for an exchange of research
ideas.
Announcement of the Summer Re
search Conference is made by Dr.
Robert E. Swain, head of the chem
istry department. This year's is
the first conference, and it is hoped
to make it an annual one.
"The objective of the conference,"
says Dr. P. A. Leighton of the chem
istry department, "is to bring to
gether for discussions a group of
scientists so chosen that every im
portant phase of photochemistry is
represented by a specialist.'*
Heading the visiting scientists will
be James Franck, Nobel Prize win
ner in physics and professor of phy
sics at John Hopkins. Fluorescence
and related phenomena will be one
of his topics.
Other visitors are to be: Farring
ton Daniels, professor of chemistry,
University of Wisconsin: W. A.
Noyes Jr., professor of chemistry,

Brown University; Edward Teller,
professor of physics, George Wash
ington University; Gerard Herzberg,
professor of physics, University of
Saskatchewan; G. R. Rollefson, pro
fessor of chemistry, University of
California, and Dr. H. W. Thompson,
lecturer in chemistry, Oxford Uni
versity.
Stanford men taking part will in
clude Dr. R. E. Emerson, of the Car
negie Institution plant laboratory,
who will discuss the highly import
ant related field of photosynthesis
in plants; Professor Leighton and
Assistant Professors Paul C. Cross
and Richard A. Ogg Jr. of the chem
istry department.
