# NEWS IN REVIEW From United Press

### BILL MILLIS 
i a government wants to
embark upon a new course in
foreign policy, it releases a "trial
balloon" to the press outlining the
policy which it wants to follow.
Such a declaration, of course, is en
tirely "unofficial"—so that the gov
ernment can, for the moment, re
pudiate it if it is not well received
by the "phantom public."
Yesterday's "trial balloon" was
set-free in London, where unidenti
fied "persons close to the Foreign
Office" announced that Great Brit
ain hopes, within a few weeks, to
mediate the 10-months-old unde
clared war between China and Ja
pan.
England, which until after the
World War was in close military
and diplomatic alliance with Ja
pan, wants to "smooth out ten
sions in the Far East" once it has,
to use a picturesque phrase,
"smoothed out" present conflicts
in Europe by merging the present
Italo-Gcrman, Anglo-Italian, and
Anglo-French pacts into a new
Four Power Pact of the democra
cies and the dictatorships.
According to "a veteran diplo
matic observer"—i.e., an official of
the British Foreign Office—the Ne
ville Chamberlain government could
then be instrumental in securing a
peace which would "humiliate"
neither Japan nor China, and would
at the same time assure a minimum
of damage to England's position as
the leading investing power in
China.
Proof that "the perfidy of Al
bion's" balance-of-power diplomacy
is still as involved as ever can be
seen in "the infoi-mant's understand
ing" that England is encouraging
the Soviet Union to send munitions,
airplanes,.and aviators to China un
til Japan with her military and eco
nomic structure tottering, would be
forced to welcome British mediation.
At the same time, it was hinted
that England would grant finan
cial credits to China if the latter
acquiesces in the impending Brit
ish move for League of Nations
recognition of Italy's conquest of
Ethiopia.

|JENEWED demands from Busi
ness for "tax relief to insure an
adequate flow of capital to industry"
were issued yesterday by the United
States Chamber of Commerce, as it
opened its twenty-sixth annual
meeting.
Its statement asserted that local,
state, and national taxes now ab
sorb nearly 25 cents of every dol
lar of national income.
Meanwhile, administration leaders
hoped to open house debate by next
Monday on the $5,000,000 anti-de
pression program. Today a sub
committee on appropriations will
hold final hearings on the bill, which
will be reported late this week.
Because of a new Supreme Court
decision on quasi-judicial agency
procedure, the National Labor Re
lations Board has tentatively de
cided to withdraw its decisions
against the Ford Motor Co., the Re
public Steel Corp., and the Inland
Steel Co.
Board officials estimated that
98 per cent of its cases would not
he affected by the court's ruling,
in the Kansas City stockyard case,
that trial examiner's reports must
he provided in major cases in or
der to allow defendant corpora
tions to file exceptions.
