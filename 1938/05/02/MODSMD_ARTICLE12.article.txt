# Betas Wine, Dine, Confine Southerner
## 
### 
"We should show more hospitality
around here," the Betas were told in
their house meeting last Monday.
"When some brother from another
school or an alumnus comes around,
ti'eat him right."
So when a brother from South
Carolina came to visit them Friday,
they treated him right. They were
more hospitable than a mint-julep
drinking southerner.
They took him out that night, and
gave him their best bed when they
got home. They loaned him clothes
because he said his trunk had been
delayed. Saturday afternoon one of
the brothers took him to a show.
New Angle
But something was fishy. The
brothers discovered that some of
their money was missing—s26 was
gone.
They searched the room where
the brother from South Carolina
had been staying. They found his
pin there—and two other pins. All
of them had different names in
scribed on their backs; none of them
were the names he had given them
as his.
The Betas called in Campus Cop
Gordy Davis, and waited for the
brother from South Carolina
Dragged Away
When he came back from the
show, Davis took him off to jail. He
was still wearing the clothes of one
of the brothers.
But as Gordy dragged him off, the
pseudo-brother yelled back, "Oh
well, I'm almost a brother. I was a
Beta pledge when I left South Caro
lina."
The Sigma Chis had a similar im
postor last finals period. But their
faker came from North Carolina.
Both the South Carolina Beta and
North Carolina Sigma Chi stopped
unsuspected at Cal before they came
to Stanford.
The visitor, John Dickson, 22, who
was known here as E. G. Hess, was
returned to Berkeley where he is
charged with burglary. He alleged
ly robbed the Beta house at U.C. o'f
fraternity pins, cigaret cases, and
jewelry before he came to Stanford.
