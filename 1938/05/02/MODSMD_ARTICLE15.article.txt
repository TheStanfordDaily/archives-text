# Deadline Set For Senior Programs
## Friday Last Chance To File Orders For Announcements 
### JOHN RICE 
There was a circus barker in Palo
Alto last week. He was good. If
he had come to Stanford, and if he
were a. senior he probably would
have been enlisted to sell programs
and announcements in the A.S.S.U.
offices.
However, he didn't come.
So Stevie and Aten are in charge
of sales. They could copy his tech
nique, but they don't go for that.
Instead, they just sell the programs
and announcements to students who
come to their office in a buying
mood.
Deadline Friday
There is a deadline approaching.
Definite orders must be sent to the
printers by this coming week-end,
so Friday has been set as the last
day for buying senior programs and
commencement announcements, ac
cording to Isabel Goldthwaite, co
chairman of the committee.
With pictures by Horace Bristol,
the leather-bound programs which
contain lists of graduating students
and senior committees, as well as a
Senior Week program, cost $1 a
copy. Some students have already
bought four or five of these to send
to friends and relatives as souvenirs.
'Life' Photographer Illustrates
Bristol, who is one of the highest
paid photographers on the Coast, is
familiar to most Stanfordites through
his work on "Life." Last spring he
took several lectures of the Fai'm
which later appeared in the college
issue of that magazine.
Until this year the programs have
been illustrated by students.
Meanwhile 1700 of the engraved
announcements have been sold for
10 cents each. Stanford tradition
says they're good gift gettersâ€”and
Emily Post thinks they're "quite the
proper thing."
Come Envelope Equipped
Equipped with envelopes, but
wilhout the personal calling cards
with which Miss Post says they
must be accompanied, the programs
and announcements will be here by
the end of the month, according to
Miss Goldthwaite.
Orders will be taken in the A.S.
S.U. offices or by committee mem
bers. Cash payment is necessary
when orders are made.
On the committee are Allen Od
die, co-chairman, Sallee Wilson,
Jean Hemphill, Elaine Seevers,
Midge Roth, Virginia Smith, Dave
Botsford, Harry Cragin, John Mor
rill, Curt Eaton, and Dave Rider.
