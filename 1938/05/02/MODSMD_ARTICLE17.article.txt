# It's Fun To Provide 'A Day of Sunshine'
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
It takes a lot of work and a lot of
fuji to raise money—s6l44 this year
—for the Convalescent Home Drive.
Mrs. Ruth Atwood has 80 kids in
the Home, and Farm students sup
post them for one month each year.
They raise most of this money in
one concentrated week.
The sophomores had their carnival
a week ago, and a week and a half
from now Luisetti and the rest of
the out-going basketballers will play
a benefit game with next year's
team, but most of the money comes
in this week.
The ways Stanford will make
money for the Home and have fun
doing it are numerous. There's Tag
Daj' and Bean Day and the Straw
berry Brunch, for instance. But
what are these things, actually?
Tag Day is the first money-push
and comes today. Forty-five frosh
women, young and beautiful of
course, will be all over the Quad
today selling tags which will show
that you have given towards the
drive.
On the tags will be printed, "A
dime will do it." You can buy one
of these tags for a dime, the sign
will mean, but pay as much as you
can.
Tomorrow you will eat beans and

more beans and more beans, and
then an apple, maybe. Tomorrow is
Bean Day. All eating groups serve
inexpensive, desscrtless lunches, and
give the money they save by buying
these cheap lunches to the Home
Drive.
Then after lunch you will go to
the Union Court for dessert—if you
want dessert. The frosh women,
still young and beautiful, will be
; there, too. They will serve straw
berry shortcake, which will cost 25
I cents.
This is called the Strawberry
j Brunch, and everything that goes
into it will be donated by the Y.W.
C.A. and the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee, everything but
the biscuits and the strawberries,
| which will be bought at a greatly
! reduced price. The Brunch lasts
! most of the afternoon.
Wednesday is the big day. It's
Labor Day. All Farm men—well,
j most of them —will go out to the
: Convalescent Home that afternoon
j and work. They clean up the
S grounds, hoe the weeds and stuff,
forget al labout studies, and gen
erally enjoy themselves.
Then when that work's done, they
devote themselves entirely to pleas
i ure. A barbecue is held near the
Home, and a program of entertain
ment follows it.
Cardinals appoint a committee
each year to handle this barbecue.
Clint Olson is in charge of it this
year, and he and his committee will
get things ready and the Roble
lasses, again, will be called in, this
time to help serve.
Most of the food for the barbe
cue will be donated by Palo Alto
stores. The Convalescent kids have
their entertainment that day, too.
While the grounds are being cleaned
up in the afternoon, the Stanford
band comes over to play for them.
Ping pong and golf finals matches
will be played ' Wednesday. These
tournaments will have gone on dur
ing last week-end, today, and to
morrow. Entry fees paid to enter
these competitions go to the Drive,
naturally.
With the Junior Water Carnival
and the Masque Ball, Friday is an
other big day. The Water Carnival
will be held that afternoon on La
gunita. It is not primarily a money
making event. It just adds spirit.
Fraternities and sororities will en
ter decorated floats, and prizes will
be given the best and most original
ones. There will be canoe races,
diving exhibitions, swimming.
Then that night, the Masque Ball
—a baby party this year. Syllabus
fee for that is $2.56 —the amount it
costs to keep one kid in the Home
for a day. Net profit for this dance
goes to the Home.
All of these events will bew ork
and fun, but the motto for the Drive
helps explain the reason for the time
and money which will be given. It
says, "Give a Day of Sunshine." So
Stanford gives up one week to give
them 30 days of sunshine.
