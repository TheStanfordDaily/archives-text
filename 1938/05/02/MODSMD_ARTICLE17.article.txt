# It's Fun To Provide 'A Day of Sunshine'

### DOUG JAQUES 
It takes a lot of work and a lot of
fuji to raise money—s6l44 this year
—for the Convalescent Home Drive.
Mrs. Ruth Atwood has 80 kids in
the Home, and Farm students sup
post them for one month each year.
They raise most of this money in
one concentrated week.
The sophomores had their carnival
a week ago, and a week and a half
from now Luisetti and the rest of
the out-going basketballers will play
a benefit game with next year's
team, but most of the money comes
in this week.
The ways Stanford will make
money for the Home and have fun
doing it are numerous. There's Tag
Daj' and Bean Day and the Straw
berry Brunch, for instance. But
what are these things, actually?
Tag Day is the first money-push
and comes today. Forty-five frosh
women, young and beautiful of
course, will be all over the Quad
today selling tags which will show
that you have given towards the
drive.
On the tags will be printed, "A
dime will do it." You can buy one
of these tags for a dime, the sign
will mean, but pay as much as you
can.
Tomorrow you will eat beans and

more beans and more beans, and
then an apple, maybe. Tomorrow is
Bean Day. All eating groups serve
inexpensive, desscrtless lunches, and
give the money they save by buying
these cheap lunches to the Home
Drive.
Then after lunch you will go to
the Union Court for dessert—if you
want dessert. The frosh women,
still young and beautiful, will be
; there, too. They will serve straw
berry shortcake, which will cost 25
I cents.
This is called the Strawberry
j Brunch, and everything that goes
into it will be donated by the Y.W.
C.A. and the Convalescent Home
Drive Committee, everything but
the biscuits and the strawberries,
| which will be bought at a greatly
! reduced price. The Brunch lasts
! most of the afternoon.
Wednesday is the big day. It's
Labor Day. All Farm men—well,
j most of them —will go out to the
: Convalescent Home that afternoon
j and work. They clean up the
S grounds, hoe the weeds and stuff,
forget al labout studies, and gen
erally enjoy themselves.
Then when that work's done, they
devote themselves entirely to pleas
i ure. A barbecue is held near the
