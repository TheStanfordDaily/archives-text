# Tag Day First Event of Home Fund Campaign
## 
### 
With Tag Day as its opening act,
the week of Stanford's annual Con
valescent Home Drive opens today,
aiming at the highest quota ever
set—s6l44.
As contributions accumulate, the
current total each day will bo regis
tered on a 15-foot thermometer in
front of the Library. Rising mercury
will show how many days the Home
could run on the amount given to
date.
Tag Day will contribute heavily
to the drive total, if the 37 frosh sales

girls succeed in selling all of their
3000 red and white tags.
"You're a heel if you don't buy a
tag today," says Mary Cowles, Tag
Day chairman.
She stressed the fact that 10 cents
is only the minimum amount—more
money can he paid, although "A
Dime Does It" is printed on each
tag.
