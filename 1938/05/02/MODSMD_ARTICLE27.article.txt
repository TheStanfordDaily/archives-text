## LO, THE POOR SPIRIT 
### 
Dear Editor:
If you want Stanford accelerated
on its road toward the situation
where nothing is left but a marriage
bureau of pampered powder puffs,
pseudo-sophisticated sex machines,
green gabardines, and fancy cars
that disillusioned fathers have fur
nished, then go ahead, and push
Stanford Spirit off the brink.
If you want these things, then
write us more, because your edi
torial was a good exhibit and fur
therance of the don't-give-a-damn
attitude that has occasioned the
Spirit's decline. If you write more,
though, do this: put in some nota
tion that you voice the views of the
editor, and not of the student body.
There is a considerable group of us
that doesn't want to be considered
behind your efforts, as Leiser's col
umn pictured us.
Athletics Foundation
Athletics, portrayed either by a
tiring two-miler, or by a faculty
member pitching horseshoes, are the
very foundation of Stanford Spirit.
Stanford Spirit, difficult though it
is to define, is a creed, a belief in, a
passion for, a love of, the heritage of
fine ideals that began when the
Founding Grant was first set down.
The thousands of young people
that have become imbued with the
Spirit have only helped to magnify
it, raise it to an even higher posi
tion of reverence than it occupied in
the early days.
Multi-Ring Circus
Stanford Spirit is on the decline
not becausP the present generation
is purposely quenching it, but be
cause the world has become such a
multi-ring circus that undergradu
ates don't take time to notice it.
And they cannot harshly be
blamed for that. But when The
Stanford Daily, straying from what
its course should be, one of teaching
Stanford Spirit, solidly ridicules it
and weakens it in the course of a
personal disagreement between the
editor and the track coach, a grave
injustice is done. Injustice to those
many who have really lived Stan
ford in their stays here, injustice to
those whose beliefs are distinctly
opposite and whose beliefs are
wrongly assumed to be portrayed.
