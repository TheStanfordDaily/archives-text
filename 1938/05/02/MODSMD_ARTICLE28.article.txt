# 'CHEER-UP, DINK'

### 
Dear Dink—and the rest of the
world:
Do not take alarm at the words of
the "official representative of the
Associated Students." There is still
a "Stanford Spirit," contrary to Lap
ham's words.
The trouble with you Dink is that
you expect others to love the old
school as much as you do. But you
are the best champion of school
spirit that Stanford has produced.
Because you competed in every
sport that you could, just to put
Stanford on top, remember that the
rest of us can only try to measure
up to your standard. Because the
applied psychology of school spirit
that you taught enabled the under
manned teams of Stanford to beat
I he mass dominance of stronger foes,
we can only wonder at your ex
ample.
No, Dink, continue to be the fiery

leader and magician that you always
have been. 1 assure you that one
man as sold as you have me on
Stanford tradition is worth a dozen
or more of the Lapham variety who
feel that an athlete comes to the
school that pays him the highest
price and not the school that he
loves the most.
—I also run.
