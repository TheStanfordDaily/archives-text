# JUNK THE EDITOR?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Today we find bantered on sheets
outside the campus the fact that
Stanford Spirit is at a low ebb. A
fine advertisement for our school!
Who'll come to a school without any
school spirit? At the same time we
see that our genius editor, Lapham,
has finally managed to make a big
time sheet with Dink as subject
matter. Of course, the least work
of Templeton makes the sport world
prick up its ears and rates in the
best newspapers as first class news,
so we can't give all the credit to
Lapham.
"Spirit Lags"
We must face the situation
squarely, for we know that Stanford
Spirit is lagging. There was a time
when it was not necessary to speak
of school spirit, but the word has
long been unused. The majority of
students have forgotten it exists, or
are afraid to mention it above a
whisper, for fear of ridicule from
listeners, or even from our campus
newspaper. However, Dink is not
a man to back down from ridicule
when there is a point to be brought
forward. It's darn lucky there are
a few men left like him.
The thing that hurts worst is the
fact that it is taken for granted by
the public that Lapham has ex
pressed "campus opinion."
Cites Ovation
To qoute the Chronicle, '"The
Daily presumably expresses the of
ficial attitude of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University." We
must question this assumption. Were
we hearing things during that ova
tion Saturday after President Wil
bur said that the cup was gone for
this year but he knew it would
spend most of its life at Stanford?
I wonder if the editor is not put
ting the whole University in un
favorable light by blowing off at
the mouth and using the school
paper to catch the overflow.
Should a. college paper be used
to fight the editor's battles? They
must, in this case, be the editor's;
they certainly are not those of the
student body. If the editor doubts
the veracity of this statement, let
the question be put to the students.
We might even end up with a new
editor.

spend most of its life at Stanford?
I wonder if the editor is not put
ting the whole University in un
favorable light by blowing off at
the mouth and using the school
paper to catch the overflow.
Should a. college paper be used
to fight the editor's battles? They
must, in this case, be the editor's;
they certainly are not those of the
student body. If the editor doubts
the veracity of this statement, let
the question be put to the students.
We might even end up with a new
editor.
