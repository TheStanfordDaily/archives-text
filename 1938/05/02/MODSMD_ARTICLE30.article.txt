# REALLY LOVES STANFORD

j Lap, Old Boy: •
Do ou realize that you are a big
I shot at Stanford now? There you |
are, sitting at your editor's desk, and ;
: you can write anything you want in j
i your editorials. Your paper reaches j
some thousands of students around !
; (he campus. You help them formu- '
late then' ideas. Actually, who else i
has such powers at Stanford but (
you?
With your power, why in the hell !
don't you do something constructive j
; for the University instead of de- \
j structive? You hit on a touchy sub- !
ject last week in your editorial about !
Stanford Spirit. You say you won- j
j der if spirit isn't a thing of the past, j
or if it even was anything then. You '
| are rubbing the wrong way.
Why do students yell their heads j
off at every game? Why am I writ- j
j ing you this letter? Because I have 1
[that old Stanford Spirit, and those!
of us that have it. abhor and look
down upon all who try to separate!
us from it.
After your article, I could have !
gotten enough students for a good
audience and hanging crew, if we
really wanted to string you up on
one of those trees outside the Daily
office. But we were afraid the !
trees would kick about it.
—A Stanford Lover.
