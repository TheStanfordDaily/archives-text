Final arrangements for decora
tions and lighting of this Friday's
Masque Ball were completed yester

lights, will form a backdrop for Don
Mulford's orchestra. Rainbow-col

while immense toyland figures will
be placed at various points along the
walls.
Bids, priced at $2.56, are being
sold at the A.S.S.U. office. No tic
