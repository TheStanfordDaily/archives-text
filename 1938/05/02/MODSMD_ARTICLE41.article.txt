LRAL things of interest oc
curred in the sporting world over
the week-end—Joe DiMaggio crack
ed his noggin against Joe Gordon's
in his 19.18 debut, Tanforan opened,
and Ed Burrows erased a little more
oi the confidence of Cal followers
in the Sadaj-Mehlert mile duo.
I here was a time this season
when Estimable Edson wasn't
Riven much of a look-in against
the Bear boys, but it must be
rather definite now in the minds
ol even the Cal alumni that the
Bear boys haven't much of a look
in against our Mr. Burrows.
I' or a while Burrows was worry
ing about how he was going to be
able to run in the P.A. meet Satur
day and still make it back to the
campus in time for initiation into
Sigma Delt Chi, journalistic fra
ternity, at 4 o'clock, but things were
ironed out so that he could stick
around Berkeley. Of course, the
fraternity would have had to deal
with Dink Templeton as well, if it
had insisted upon Ed's being back
in time, but that question didn't
come up, believe it or not.
* * *
jVOW this basketball game that's
coming up May 12, between the
graduating team and next year's
varsity, should be something inter
esting to. see, even though it might
not show too much in the way of
fast basketball.
'1 he boys, even though they do
get in a little work now and then
these balmy afternoons, are not
in the best of hape. They won't
be walking off the floor on their
toes when the game is over, but
that's all right. What will be in
teresting will be the slant at the
next-year's-team roster.
While it won't be complete, it
will include such as Don Burness,
Tom Siebert, Derrol Hucldleson,
Phil Zonne and Lafaille are proven
quartities. Burness and Davidson
were brilliant on the frosh, and on
their performance as varsity men
next year will hinge much of the
team's strength.
The graduates' outfit will be the
same old team, of course, with
Luisctti, Lee, Caldcrwood, Stoe
fen, and Heath as the probable
starters. There won't be many re
placements, so the oldsters will
probably slow down in the second
half. The coming varsity has a
lot of material, which should be a
distinct advantage in the game.
It doesn't take much courage,
though, to predict that Luisetti and
the boys will win. Incidentally,
Hank will coach one team and John
Bunn will coach the other.
Bunn's successor is supposed to
be named this week at B.A.C.
meeting—it was rumored to come
last week, but the meeting was
postponed. There are plenty of
wild conjectures going around
about Genial John's successor, and
some even think there won't be
any successor, that John will
keep on.
Take it from an old guesser of
rare ability that Bunn won't be
coach next year—either as head or
advisory. He's going to have a job
of his own next year that will keep
him busy enough for any man.
Bill Hubbard of San Jose State, a
former Stanford athlete, is men
tioned in some quarters as a possi
bility. A quiet, sofe-spoken gentle
man, Hubbard is okay from a lot of
standpoints. But what that 8.A.C.,
one of the closest-mouthed groups
ever, is thinking is still a huge se
cret.-—Peterson.

oi the confidence of Cal followers
in the Sadaj-Mehlert mile duo.
I here was a time this season
when Estimable Edson wasn't
Riven much of a look-in against
the Bear boys, but it must be
rather definite now in the minds
ol even the Cal alumni that the
Bear boys haven't much of a look
in against our Mr. Burrows.
I' or a while Burrows was worry
ing about how he was going to be
able to run in the P.A. meet Satur
day and still make it back to the
campus in time for initiation into
Sigma Delt Chi, journalistic fra
ternity, at 4 o'clock, but things were
ironed out so that he could stick
around Berkeley. Of course, the
fraternity would have had to deal
with Dink Templeton as well, if it
had insisted upon Ed's being back
in time, but that question didn't
come up, believe it or not.

jVOW this basketball game that's
coming up May 12, between the
graduating team and next year's
varsity, should be something inter
esting to. see, even though it might
not show too much in the way of
fast basketball.
'1 he boys, even though they do
get in a little work now and then
these balmy afternoons, are not
in the best of hape. They won't
be walking off the floor on their
toes when the game is over, but
that's all right. What will be in
teresting will be the slant at the
next-year's-team roster.
While it won't be complete, it
will include such as Don Burness,
Tom Siebert, Derrol Hucldleson,
Phil Zonne and Lafaille are proven
quartities. Burness and Davidson
were brilliant on the frosh, and on
their performance as varsity men
next year will hinge much of the
team's strength.
The graduates' outfit will be the
same old team, of course, with
Luisctti, Lee, Caldcrwood, Stoe
fen, and Heath as the probable
starters. There won't be many re
placements, so the oldsters will
probably slow down in the second
half. The coming varsity has a
lot of material, which should be a
distinct advantage in the game.
It doesn't take much courage,
though, to predict that Luisetti and
the boys will win. Incidentally,
Hank will coach one team and John
Bunn will coach the other.
Bunn's successor is supposed to
be named this week at B.A.C.
meeting—it was rumored to come
last week, but the meeting was
postponed. There are plenty of
wild conjectures going around
about Genial John's successor, and
some even think there won't be
any successor, that John will
keep on.
Take it from an old guesser of
rare ability that Bunn won't be
coach next year—either as head or
advisory. He's going to have a job
of his own next year that will keep
him busy enough for any man.
Bill Hubbard of San Jose State, a
former Stanford athlete, is men
tioned in some quarters as a possi
bility. A quiet, sofe-spoken gentle
man, Hubbard is okay from a lot of
standpoints. But what that 8.A.C.,
one of the closest-mouthed groups
ever, is thinking is still a huge se
cret.-—Peterson.
