The last game on the frosh ball
team s schedule was over a week
and three days ago and upon look
ing over the results and averages
made, several interesting facts come

games scheduled at the beginning of
the season, but a streak of bad
weather at the start and one or two
more rainy spells cut down the
games played to only 12.
Out of these 12 games, the frosh
won 7 and lost 5. The surprise data
reveals that in this schedule the
Papooses amassed 85 runs to a
total opponent score of 46, or a dif
ference of 39 runs in favor of the
Farm squad.
Calcuhs Hold Frosh
Only once did an opposing team,
the Calcubs, manage to hold the
frosh scoreless. In their turn, the
Cards chalked up three shut-outs,
one to the tune of 21-0 against Menlo
Jaysee. In addition to this advan
tage in runs scored, the Papooses
also have an edge on the number of
errors committed. Opposing teams
committed 51 bobbles, while the
Farm nine has 42 misplays against
it for a fielding average of 3.5 errors
per tilt.
Coach Harry Shipkey used three
pitchers . during the season who
turned in an average of 7.84 strike
outs per performance. Big Quentin
"Cootie" Thompson pitched seven
games, winning four and losing
three. In addition he leads the
strikeout list with a phenomenal
average of 12.57 strikeouts per game.

up against Sacramento High should
be a mark for frosh hurlers to shoot
at for some time. Monte Pfyl has
two wins and two losses to his
credit, while Bill Masters, a late
comer to the squad, turned in one
win. Eighty-eight hits were col

' itcted off this trio of hurlers, or an
I average of 7.333 hits per game.
Leading the team's batting
prowess was Captain Monte Pfyl,
woh had a batting average of over
.525. Second to him is Thor Peter
| son, who came into the lineup late
ito score an average of .41(5, while
i "Cookie" South, redheaded out
-1 fielder and first sacker, is close be
hind.
Pfyl leads again with home runs

Peterson, and Marty Bains each hit
i one foursacker for the Cards.
; Strangely enough, "Lefty" Koll, the
Cal pitcher who handcuffed the
liosh in tluee games, hit the only
two home runs banged off the Card
j hurlers the entire season.
7 Wins, 1 Loss
Records up to the Cal encounters

Cards chalked up three shut-outs,
one to the tune of 21-0 against Menlo
Jaysee. In addition to this advan
tage in runs scored, the Papooses
also have an edge on the number of
errors committed. Opposing teams
committed 51 bobbles, while the
Farm nine has 42 misplays against
it for a fielding average of 3.5 errors
per tilt.
Coach Harry Shipkey used three
pitchers . during the season who
turned in an average of 7.84 strike
outs per performance. Big Quentin
"Cootie" Thompson pitched seven
games, winning four and losing
three. In addition he leads the
strikeout list with a phenomenal
average of 12.57 strikeouts per game.
His record of 19 strikeouts hung
up against Sacramento High should
be a mark for frosh hurlers to shoot
at for some time. Monte Pfyl has
two wins and two losses to his
credit, while Bill Masters, a late
comer to the squad, turned in one
win. Eighty-eight hits were col

' itcted off this trio of hurlers, or an
I average of 7.333 hits per game.
Leading the team's batting
prowess was Captain Monte Pfyl,
woh had a batting average of over
.525. Second to him is Thor Peter
| son, who came into the lineup late
ito score an average of .41(5, while
i "Cookie" South, redheaded out
-1 fielder and first sacker, is close be
hind.
Pfyl leads again with home runs
hit, marking three up for the season.
Peterson, and Marty Bains each hit
i one foursacker for the Cards.
; Strangely enough, "Lefty" Koll, the
Cal pitcher who handcuffed the
liosh in tluee games, hit the only
two home runs banged off the Card
j hurlers the entire season.
7 Wins, 1 Loss
Records up to the Cal encounters
show the Papooses ahead of the
schedule with 7 wins and 1 loss.
I In the three-game series the Cards
| only collected 4 runs against 24 for
the Cubs, and lost the frosh series
; for the 12th consecutive year.
Definite varsity material for next

I look good on second; Thompson,
! who is expected to fill a vacancy in
: hurling strength; Thor Peterson with
his batting strength; Cookie South,
Elton Boone, Ditlevson, McCloud,
Masters, and the catching trio of
iPurkitt, Fay and Atkinson.
The last game on the frosh ball
team s schedule was over a week
and three days ago and upon look
ing over the results and averages
made, several interesting facts come
to light.
In the first place there were 20
games scheduled at the beginning of
the season, but a streak of bad
weather at the start and one or two
more rainy spells cut down the
games played to only 12.
Out of these 12 games, the frosh
won 7 and lost 5. The surprise data
reveals that in this schedule the
Papooses amassed 85 runs to a
total opponent score of 46, or a dif
ference of 39 runs in favor of the
Farm squad.
