# Stanford Spirit, No. 2
## 
### 
ON the second page are letters from four
Stanford students who take themselves
and the sports pages too seriously. I hope
that is an error into which this column will
not fall today.
Instead, the column is intended as a little
amplification of the dispute. First this official
voice of the Associated Students of Stanford
University stuff should be gotten out of the
way. Daily editorials are the opinion of one
person, a fact that Bill Leiser should have picked
up when he was editor of The Daily.
Second, if large sections of the student body
disagree with this editorial policy, they should
know it without being told. I refer to the lack
of vociferous condemnation in the interval be
tween publication of the editorial and reprint
ing in the Chronicle. This means, I suppose,
that the large sections of the student body did
not think the editorial was bad until they found
that Mr. Leiser thought it was bad.
Third, let's make it clear just what the boys
are complaining about. If I understand them,
they are contesting the statement that "spirit"
is declining, not the ethics of Coach Temple
ton's statements to the papers, nor the contri
butions that athletic scholarships have made to
that decline.
The trouble there is that I am not the only
one who thinks that spirit is declining. It is
also Dink's if I understand his private state
ments, and those public ones to which the edi
torial in question referred. Perhaps the boys
should do their arguing on this point with him.
Personally, I would view the decline of
spirit with just as much alarm as the four letter
writers would. But I would define spirit dif
ferently. Loyalty to Stanford as an educational
institution would be the main plank in my
platform. Competition in athletic events would
not be absolutely necessary.
One way that loyalty, and appreciation, is
shown is by gifts to the university. The Presi
dent's report shows a gain rather than a decline
here.
A way not to show it, in my opinion, is to
advocate that athletics be held in higher regard
than scholarship at Stanford.
And on this point I'll argue all day.
