# Fun for the Kiddies

AFTER a trial run at the Soph Carnival, Stan
ford really takes off today on the Conval
escent Home Drive. For one week, Stanford
participates in the only genuine "back to the
Farm" movement of the year. It manages to
dig up enough money to finance the Home for
a considerable length of time. It has a lot of
good, clean fun. It is brave, cheerful, obedient,
kind, etc., etc.
For one week, Stanford indulges its weak
ness for playing, but this time it plays with a
purpose. It forgets its pose of pseudo-sophis
tication to buy little tags, eat beans and straw
berry shortcake, raise blisters on its hands, and
act absurd in baby clothes. And while it is
shelling out for its fun, it can comfort an out
raged pocketbook with the thought that, for
once, it is actually doing something worth
while.
All in all, the Drive makes amends for a good
many of Stanford's besetting sins, like unsym
pathetic attitudes to good causes, little inter
est in campus affairs, and hangnails. Since
these sins are pretty numerous, it is lucky that
Stanford makes the most of the chance the
Drive gives it to clean the slate. Of course, I
only have to work for the fun of it.
But anyhow, just in case, somebody give me
a shovel quick.—J. S.
