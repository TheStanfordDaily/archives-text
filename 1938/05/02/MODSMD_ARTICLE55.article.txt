I AST Friday's issue of The Daily carried a
j good deal of information on scientific re
search at Stanford, which may have surprised
some of the undergraduates who think pro
fessors use laboratories only to avoid unhappy
home lives.
It also would surprise many of the self-sanc
tified critics of American universities. And it
would upset all the arguments of that breed of
self-made man who declares that colleges are
nothing but play-pens for wastrels.
Critics think they are displaying piercing in
sight when they state that research in colleges
is worthless, and that the campus is only a
refuge for children afraid to face the world.
They say that piofessois spc'nd their time tiack

ing down useless facts, which are then en
tombed in a thesis dryer than a bale of blotting
paper.
But Friday's paper reported the most suc
cessful attempt yet made to check infantile
paralysis. It reported a study of "brain waves,"
an investigation of oxygen consumption, and a
study in astrology.
It would be hard to deny that control of polio
myelitis is impractical. And with all the cur
rent shouting about thought transference by
brain waves, work on that can't be called use
less. Dr. Farnsworth may not have saved him
self from a horrible fate when he blew up one
of astrology's pet theories, but he put another
dent in a superstition that has misguided men
since the days when the pyramids were an
Egyptian WPA project.
And the same critic who objects to useless re
search howls like a wolf pack when the ath
lete he has picked gets mixed up in his oxygen
consumption.
And there is an interesting field for research,
probably by the abnormal psych professors.
