# BULL SESSION
## WILLIE 
### 
I~|EATH came a little closer Saturday to a man who
hates death, and the shortening span of his years
brought with it the realization that the course of one
of America's pet bugaboos is almost run.
Willie Hearst is 75; and in a nation whose press he
has dominated for 40 years and more, the news stirs
a wave of speculative interest which would make his
blood run cold—or colder—if he knew about it.
For he has few friends, has Willie. The majority of
his profession dislike him intensely; he is anathema to
liberals everywhere; he has no friends in the Congress
he is always advising; he has no friends in the Holly
wood from which his circle of sycophants is drawn; he
has been kicked out of France and frowned upon in
England. Only his family and one or two dictators
have warm spots in their hearts for Willie Hearst.
In a way he is much to be pitied for this. It must be
very lonely sometimes, to be so rich, so powerful, able
to command a nation's public opinion and unable to
command its affection.
But personal success, in this America of ours is, after
all, not the only success, or even the most desirable
success. And materially, no one can say Willie Hearst
is a failure. It is easy to minimize his success, it is
easy to say he could not help but be a success, starting
out with a couple of millions; but those who say that
don't give him very much credit.
Too many have started out with a couple of millions
and gone smash; but not he. His money doubled 10
times over, his properties increased by half the largest
papei's in the country, he could scarcely be called a
failure today.
Nor can it be said that he has not sincerely tried to
win public affection. He has warned the United States
against more dangers, disclosed for her safety more dark
plots against the state, than any other man. Her in
terests have always animated him. For her sake he
fought a war with Spain almost single-handed, until
the country finally awoke to its responsibilities and
helped him out. In return for that aid he gave her the
Philippines, and Puero Rico, and Guam, and the Pacific
Islands which have lately become so important in the
Pacific-Asiatic air-route.
For his country's sake he tried to keep her out of the
war with Germany. He did evei'ything he could to stop
her entry, using the full force of his papers in the first
generally unpopular act he ever undertook. Because
he has always wanted her to have the best government
possible, he has often volunteered to assume the presi
dency, and no one can say it was his fault that this un
grateful nation did not give it to him.
So, in the long run, Willie Hearst cannot be called a
a failure on any count, personal or material. He knows
that he has always worked for the good of his fellow
men, even if they have not always been able to see it
that way. And that is probably his satisfaction, as he
enters his seventy-fifth year, satisfaction which the
death he hates cannot obscure.
He has done the best he could for his country; and
the fact that it has coincided pleasantly with the best
he could do for himself probably does not shake his
faith in it. The Lord of San Simeon knows he has dis
charged well his guardianship of the people.

he has always wanted her to have the best government
possible, he has often volunteered to assume the presi
dency, and no one can say it was his fault that this un
grateful nation did not give it to him.
So, in the long run, Willie Hearst cannot be called a
a failure on any count, personal or material. He knows
that he has always worked for the good of his fellow
men, even if they have not always been able to see it
that way. And that is probably his satisfaction, as he
enters his seventy-fifth year, satisfaction which the
death he hates cannot obscure.
He has done the best he could for his country; and
the fact that it has coincided pleasantly with the best
he could do for himself probably does not shake his
faith in it. The Lord of San Simeon knows he has dis
charged well his guardianship of the people.
—Allen Drury,
I~|EATH came a little closer Saturday to a man who
hates death, and the shortening span of his years
brought with it the realization that the course of one
of America's pet bugaboos is almost run.
Willie Hearst is 75; and in a nation whose press he
has dominated for 40 years and more, the news stirs
a wave of speculative interest which would make his
blood run cold—or colder—if he knew about it.
For he has few friends, has Willie. The majority of
his profession dislike him intensely; he is anathema to
liberals everywhere; he has no friends in the Congress
he is always advising; he has no friends in the Holly
wood from which his circle of sycophants is drawn; he
has been kicked out of France and frowned upon in
England. Only his family and one or two dictators
have warm spots in their hearts for Willie Hearst.
In a way he is much to be pitied for this. It must be
very lonely sometimes, to be so rich, so powerful, able
to command a nation's public opinion and unable to
command its affection.
But personal success, in this America of ours is, after
all, not the only success, or even the most desirable
success. And materially, no one can say Willie Hearst
is a failure. It is easy to minimize his success, it is
easy to say he could not help but be a success, starting
out with a couple of millions; but those who say that
don't give him very much credit.
Too many have started out with a couple of millions
and gone smash; but not he. His money doubled 10
times over, his properties increased by half the largest
papei's in the country, he could scarcely be called a
failure today.
Nor can it be said that he has not sincerely tried to
win public affection. He has warned the United States
against more dangers, disclosed for her safety more dark
plots against the state, than any other man. Her in
terests have always animated him. For her sake he
fought a war with Spain almost single-handed, until
the country finally awoke to its responsibilities and
helped him out. In return for that aid he gave her the
Philippines, and Puero Rico, and Guam, and the Pacific
Islands which have lately become so important in the
Pacific-Asiatic air-route.
For his country's sake he tried to keep her out of the
war with Germany. He did evei'ything he could to stop
her entry, using the full force of his papers in the first
generally unpopular act he ever undertook. Because
he has always wanted her to have the best government
possible, he has often volunteered to assume the presi
dency, and no one can say it was his fault that this un
grateful nation did not give it to him.
So, in the long run, Willie Hearst cannot be called a
