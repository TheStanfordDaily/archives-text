'T'HOUGH you might not believe it right off hand,
considering the over-cast sky, this is picnic wea
ther. In fact, the situation is almost as bad as it is
in winter, when the whole campus digs out for the
week-end; but this quarter the campus goes west in
stead of cast.
The most obvious, and popular picnicking spots are,
of course, the beaches. Carmcl is our favorite. It's
not too far away, but still you can shake the dust of
Stanford off. The swimming is good, the beach — ex
cept that everybody and his dog is usually there —is
attractive, and all in all, it's a good deal.
For a short run, Santa Cruz, or even better, Rio del
Mar is a likely spot. The swimming is about as good
there as anywhere, and, if you can get in, the country
club is a good place to dine, dance, and what rhymes
with the last word.
San Gregorio used to be pretty good—we haven't
been there this year—though the swimming isn't too
sharp. However, there are lots of caves and things to
climb around in. Quite adventurous.
But beaches are beaches anywhere, and about all
you need is sun, sand, and water. And they all have
them.

AS for dry-land picnics, you can't go wrong any
where in the hills back of the campus. There's
Searsville Lake, for swimming, boating, and room to
play baseball in. There are also some good rocks to
climb around on, but we couldn't find them last time
we were there.
Felt Lake, back of the campus, is okay too, though
you mustn't go into the water because someone—maybe
you—drinks it. Or you can just browse around as
your little heart dictates, and you'll manage somehow.
But our favorite deal is to go up Mount Hamilton,
starting late in the afternoon, and stopping about half
way up for supper. You can watch the sun go down
over the valley below, and then go up, if it's Saturday
night, to peer at the stars through the telescope at the
Lick Observatory. Stone.
