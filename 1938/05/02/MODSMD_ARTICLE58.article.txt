Stagers' Week-End Readings:
Stagers, who have so far been
pampered like a bunch* of sixth
graders doing a health playlet for

indulgent ma
mas of the P.-
"T.A. last Friday
hopped off the
dime with the
adult realization
that there is an
audience out front
to whom they owe
some respect.
Certainly not an
elaborate pro-

gram, Friday's brace of one-acts was
intelligently chosen, well done, and,
what is more important, indicative
of things to come. As the twig is
bent, so, we venture to predict, is
the tree inclined.
Milne's "Miss Marlowe at Play,"
that scrap of arch lunacy in which
a frisky actress who wheedles an
old fuddy-duddy into her boudoir,
is unwittingly compromised, was
clearly the best of the lot. Not only
is the play compact and perennially
tickling, but Jane Clary maneuvered
the title role with just the right
turn of wise insousciance and hig
gldy-piggldy deviltx-y.
Miss Clary is probably the only
actress on the campus who can take
a crack at the tactics of Ina Claire
without suggesting an ingenue whose
sophistication has been practised in
front of a mirror with frequent ref
erence to the poses of the models in
•'Vogue."
The remotely motivated and ma
cabre case of D.T.'s with which
O'Neil grapples in "Where the Cross
Is Made" has nowhere a better place
than in the theater. Its story about
a sea captain and his son obsessed
with the idea of buried treasure is
on the same plane as the fable about
the pickled hand.
And with the economy of both a
thumping good one-act and a
cracker-jack of a ghost story, its
build-up to madness produces the
same sort of shudder. Joe Lawry's
demoniacal gurgle, Melba Rae
Toombs' despair, and Paul Clary's
rabid frothing at the mouth, which
might have been merely funny,
were not only artfully stepped up
but done so with the proper occa
sional flick of a tongue in a cheek.
The sensation of smacking into
Maxwell Anderson's editorializing
under his camouflage of melodrama
is akin to that of getting stuck on a
wad of gum under a plush seat.

Such is the case with "Second
Overture" in which a group of noble
prisoners escape a Red firing squad
meanwhile giving Mr. Anderson an
excuse to spout his philosophy of
justice. Beyond this irritating snag
in the action the scene was difficult
to visualize, the situation hard to
grasp from a reading—all of which
was not helped by a lamentable and
unwieldy supporting cast.
Pauline Stevens, especially, should
be tipped off to the fact that a prin
cess does not greet the news of her
husband's execution at the same
emotional pitch in which a commit
tee chairman reacts to a shortage of
crackers for a Lagunita tea.—Slater.
