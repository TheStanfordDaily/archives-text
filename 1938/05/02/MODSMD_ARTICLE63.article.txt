# Desmond To Speak Oil KGO Tonight
## 
### 
'Censorship and Propaganda as
Weapons of Statecraft" will be dis
cussed by Robert W. Desmond, act
ing associate professor of journalism
and associate editor of the Christian
Science Monitor, tonight at 9:15
o'clock over KGO on the Stanford
Radio Hour.
Dr. Desmond will describe the
forces which have lead to the seizure
of the control of the press and to
the forces which will ultimately free
it again. He declares that the agen
cies for the dissemination of current
information, by the techniques of
censorship and by propaganda, at
tempt to shape opinions to the exclu
sion of the opposite points of view.

Some meteorites arc so cold when
they strike the earth that they are
covered with frost.
