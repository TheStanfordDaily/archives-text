# Water Carnival Plans Outlined
## Aquacade To Feature Eleven Novel Events 
### 
Originality will be the keynote of
next Friday's annual Junior Water
Carnival, according to Chairman
Walt Meyer.
Among the 11 individual events,
the "greased pole" race for men,
the women's "balloon-bursting"
race, the four-man canoe race, the
men's underwater balloon race, the
canoe-filling and the canoe turn
over races are innovations this
year.
In addition an ice-cream conces
sion will be operated, the profits of
which arc to be donated to the Con
valescent Home Drive fund.
In the "greased pole" race the en
trants arc to run out on a greased
horizontal pole, suspended from the
middle diving platform, 15 feet above
the water, and try to grab a flag
attached to the end.
"We guarantee the spills in this
event to equal the number of tries,"
said Phil Griffith, chairman of the
day's events.
The women's "balloon-bursting"
race will supplant the usual night
gown handicap. Racing to a float,
lined with extra-sized balloons, the
feminine entrants are to blow them
up until they disintegrate, and then
swim back to shore.
Interspersed with the diving exhi
bitions by Roy Winkelmann, three
comic divers, Aubrey Austin, Ken
Cuthbertson and Bob Coffin will
clown and frolic.
The usual float competition with
prizes for the most beautiful float
and the cleverest canoe jousting,
and straight racing events will com
plete the program. All those who
wish to enter the various events are
asked to notify Phil Griffith or Walt
Meyer as soon as possible.
