### BILL MILLIS 
jp'Oß a decade Benito Mussolini
enjoyed the monopoly of being
the world's only Fascist ruler. De
spite the fact that he could never
live down responsibility for the mur
der of Matteotti, the democratic
leader, II Duce consolidated his
power in the years after 1922, large
ly upon the basis of British and
American loans, and was able to
rationalize his "revolution" by de
veloping the doctrines of the Cor
porate State.
In those same years he could af
ford to be contemptuous of a minor I
political character in the German
Weimar Republic, Adolf Hitler, the
Austrian-born fuehrer of the Na
tional Socialist German Workers
party, who during the later 1920's
was endeavoring to live down his
imprisonment following the failure
of the comic opera Munich "beer
hall putsch" in 1923.

Since 1934 it lias been a differ
ent story, as Mussolini lias stead
ily lost his once exclusive position
in world politics, while the star of
Adolf Hitler, now dictator of the
Third Reich, has as steadily as
cended.
Today the now-contiguous Ger
many and Italy are the "axis pow
ers," joined in diplomatic and mili
tary alliance, but it is Adolf Hitler—
who rules the much larger, stronger
state—that can, if he wishes, look
down upon the "Sawdust Caesar"
to the south.
Late this afternoon a train will
arrive in Rome from Berlin; aboard
will be Hitler and his most impor
tant aids, including Minister of
Propaganda Joseph GoebbcLs, For
eign Minister Joachim von Ribben
trop, General William Keitel, and
Gestapo-chief Heinrich Himmler.
For the next six days "the two
greatest men of the century," as
Field Marshal Wilhclm Goering
yesterday called Hitler and Mus
solini, will discuss the Anglo-
Jtalian pact and the Anglo-French
unwritten military alliances, both
developments which have occurred
since the visit of II Duce to Berlin
last September.
Dominating the week's conversa
tions will be the German annexa
tion of Austria, which has under
mined Italy's past hopes for domina
tion of the Balkans. However, con
fident Nazi "spokesmen" in Berlin
predicted that Mussolini would pre
sent Germany with a "token" Afri
can colony, as demonstration of the
continued solidarity of the Rome-
Berlin axis.

yiCTORY for the British foreign
policy of "appeasement was se
cured yesterday by Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain, when the
House of Commons, by a vote of
316 to 108, approved the recently
negotiated "pact of friendship" with
Italy.
The result demonstrates that the
resignation of pro-League of Na
tions Anthony Eden has not
brought a lasting split to the Con
servative party.
Before the treaty was approved
it was assailed by wartime Prime
Minister David Lloyd George and
by Labor Party Leader Herbert
Morrison as containing "illusory
promises heightening the danger
of war."
