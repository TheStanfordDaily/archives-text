Mulford To Play
Playing for the Masque Ball is
Don Mulford's orchestra, recently
voted the most popular band on the i
Cal campus. Mulford was formerly
master of ceremonies for the Golden
State theater circuit, and his band
has appeared at the Hotel Claremont
and the Claremont Country Club.
Pete Fay, Stanfox-d tenor and grid
der, will sing at the ball as guest
artist, along with Henry Lightfoot,
Mulford's i-egular vocalist. Light
foot was formerly with Freddie Na
gel. Fay will sing a number, writ
ten by Bob Forbes, which was first
introduced on a l'ecent Stanford
Night at the Sir Francis Drake.
Mulford has arranged to have the
members of his band dress in cos
tumes appropriate to the theme, and,
as added entertainment, will lead a
gargantuan Big Apple.
Special Design
Decorations, designed especially
for the occasion by Arturo Trem
bley, interior decorator, will center
around a 16-foot circle of glittering
white, which, as a background for
the orchestra, will be brilliantly illu
minated.
Vari-colored drapes will com
pletely enclose the dance floor, while
the ceiling will have the appearance
of a tent. In addition to this, there
will be toyland figures placed at in
-1 tervals along the walls. To enliven
the fun, a shower of balloons will
be released at some time during the
evening.
Patrons and patronesses are Mr.
and Mrs. William Bark, Mr. and
