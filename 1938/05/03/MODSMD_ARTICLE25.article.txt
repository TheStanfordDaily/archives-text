# Excom To Be Taken Literally--By Machine
## 
### 
All the inane little side-remarks
that fills the smoky atmosphere in
Ex Committee's meeting room every
Tuesday night will be recorded per
manently for the rest of the quarter.
A verbatum report of each meet
ing will be kept by Miss Louise
Price, director of the Union Unit, as
part of her study of student govern
ment and formation of student
opinion.
To handle the job, she has hired
Lawrence Winter, a student who
has spent the last few years at court
reporting in Kansas. He takes down
everything said on a machine called
the Stenotype, which looks much
like an adding machine.
One syllable at a time is the way
he takes things down, and he has
had so much practice that he has no
trouble catching up if he takes a
moment to light a cigarette.
Making a study for a doctorate
dissertation for Columbia Univer
sity, Miss Price says much of her
research centers around campus
traditions.
She considers student democracy
and a high standard of personal in
tegrity, as is evidenced by the Honor
Cefde, Stanford's most significant |
traditions. '

This summer, if things go as
planned, Miss Price will go back
to Columbia and put her dissertation
into final shape.
Other student groups whose meet
ings have been recorded verbatim
by Miss Price are Union Club and
Women's Conference last year.
"I decided that Ex Committee
went a little too fast for short hand,"
she said. "That's why I arranged
for a Stenotype expert."
