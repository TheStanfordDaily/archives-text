# Estimate Sets Senior Week Cost at $25
## Ball To Be Largest Single Item of Class Of '38 Expenses List 
### 
Twenty-five dollars is the least
seniors will pay when they take over
the campus for Senior Week this
year.
This is the conservative estimate
of Stevie, mentor of the A.S.S.U.
office, and it takes into account only
such necessities as a cap and gown,
the Senior Ball, programs and an
nouncements.
Biggest item on the list will be
the Senior Ball, whose price has not
been set as yet, but will be either
$8 or $10. Flowers will probably
cost accordingly, averaging around
$3—meaning that a sizeable slice of
the $25 minimum will go for this
crowning social event of the year.
Caps, Gowns Figure
Next will come caps and gowns,
hireable at the Bookstore for a de
posit of $5, a rental fee of $2. This
investment, not so fruitless as some,
will net graduates a $3 refund when
they return their garments following
exercises.
Programs and announcements take
varying amounts, depending on the
individual student. At 10 cents each,
announcement purchases will prob
ably run around 20 to 30 per stu
dent; and programs, leather-bound
mementos of graduation, will be $1
each.
(JO-Cent Luncheon
Smallest in price, but probably
not in value received, will be the
Senior Luncheon in Union Court,
one of the two informal gatherings
of the class during the week. Tickets
for this will be 60 cents. The Senior
Barbecue, a similar, affair, will be
free.
Thus, the $25 minimum, which
does not include entertainment of
friends and family, farewell tours of
the city, and various other senti
mental diversions, all of which take
money. The senior who comes
through with his pocket-book un
scathed will be noble — and non
existent.
