# CAMPUS OPINION
## TAGGED: ONE HEEL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last year, when the chairman of
the Tag Day Committee, in an ef
fort to sell more tags to support the
Convalescent Home, insulted the
campus by calling each student a
"heel" if he didn't purchase a tag,
I dismissed the distasteful remark
with a feeling that there would be
no repetition of the incident. There
fore, when I read a similar state
ment this year in Monday's Daily, I
could not let it go by without a
protest.
It would seem that the Tag Day
Committee in its zeal to raise money
has forgotten the essential charit
able nature of the institution that it
represents. If its charity were meas
ured by the insulting appeal that
characterizes Tag Day, no self re
specting donor would be moved to
contribute one cent to so unworthy
an object. But the fact is that the
Home is not responsible for the ill
considered acts of such agents.
The Tag Day Committee has also
forgotten that from 65 to 72 per cent
of the Stanford student body is self
supporting in whole or in part.
From the foregoing fact it is easy
to see that many students who would
wquld be only too glad to give, just
can't afford to do so. To insult and
embarrass such students reflects
only upon the character of the Tag
Day Committee and chairman. li
the members of the committee have
bepn successful in their mass in
timidation of students who can't af
ford to contribute, and have thereby
collected the amount they set as
their goal, there is no doubt in my
mind as to whom the term "heel"
most aptly fits. If, on the other
hand, proceeds from Tag Day have
fallen short of meeting the expecta
tions of its sponsors, I recommend
to the committee in the future a
more sympathetic and charitable ap
peal which will do justice to the
fine institution it seeks to support.
