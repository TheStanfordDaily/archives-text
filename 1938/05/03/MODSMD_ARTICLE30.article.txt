The Editor, Sir:
My humble compliments for your |
fine work in upholding the real
Stanford spirit. So one of the
coaches is hollering because some
boys who are athletes, and good
ones too, have taken to studying? '
What did they come here for? To
run around the track and lose four
years of opportunity so said coach
could get a raise in pay? Does the j
coach get them a job when they are
through? No. Does the coach ,
worry about his own job? Yes.
Then why should not the athletes
worry about themselves?
This farce about school spirit is
really funny; in fact, it is pitiful.
Hei-e our coy administration says
that football commercialism is bad, j
very bad; and then the old boys ;
sneak away and count un the re- i
ceipts for the last football game.
And how about that brain-boy,
A1 Masters. Stanford is run for
Stanford students. Hooey. Comes
■i basketball game and Masters' eyes
gleam. To hell with Stanford stu
dents; the less tickets they buy the
more the general public will buy at
twice the price.
Why is it, may I ask, that our
sports program does not allow of all
sports to be participated in? Why
did wrestling have such a hard time
getting in? Why don't Jerry Maloney
and so-called "sportsmen" let cer
tain sports be fully participated in?
Because 'they arc afraid Stanford
might lose a match. Real sport, I
tell you, is the fun of getting into
competition; of meeting another in
some game or match and win or
lose, have a good time doing it. It
is idealistic; it teaches a little sports
manship that this world is sorely in
need of. No, Stanford can't have
sportsmen; it must have winning
teams or nothing. Why? To make
money. Why deny it; it's the truth.
Those poor guys that do go out for
the sport of it are to be admired—
they are really all right—but the
attitude of commercialism behind
them is a disgrace. -'Thirty-nine.
