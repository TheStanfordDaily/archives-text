"Horse sense and sincerity" char
acterize Johnny Johnson, according
to Budy Cady who plays that part
in the Division of Speech and
Drama's production of Paul Green's
play to be given on May G and 7 in
Memorial Hall.
Cady says, "It is the best male
character since Hamlet, but I don't
mean to compare them in any way."
According to theme, the play is
anti-war, but the critics consensus
is that the lesson is subordinated to
hilarity and action. Brock Pember
ton wrote, "I had a better time at
"Johnny Johnson" than at anything
I had seen in a long time."

ny Johnson' is a hilarious show
with melodies you can't forget."
Fourteen scenes will be used in
the play and a cast of 60 people is
under the direction of Gordon Lange
and Phil Brown.
