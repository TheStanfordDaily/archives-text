O MATTER how you dope it, if
you ie anywhere near honest with
yourself you can't find Stanford
winning the meet with U.S.C. this
Saturday. While it may not be
pal i iotic to concede your opponent
victory before you start, it is also
just common sense in this case to do
SO.
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. infor
mation tycoon, can stretch his
imagination to a maximum of 58
points for Stanford, he says; his
minimum is somewhere ii} the
middle 30 s, with the most likely
total somewhere between 40 and 50.
With what might be termed a
good performance in the face of
the tremendous odds they fate,
the Cards might reach 50 points.
II they score anything more they
can claim a moral victory. With
an ordinary performance the score
is liable to be closer to 40 than
to 50.
The Trojans have so many stars
this year again 4 hat they are in a
class by themselves. And not only
that, but anyone making out a dope
sheet who doesn't know about a lot
of the unheard-of athletes at U.S.C.
can find himself missing a lot of
third places, which add up little by
little.
For instance, as far as is known
U.S.C. has two line men in the
sprints, and one who is far from
slow. Tally and Jordan can handle
most ol the regular run of college
spl inters, and Mickey Anderson will
at least stick with the regular run.
Maybe they have someone else, but
even il they don't that trio is enough
to win a majority of the points in
the sprints against Stanford.
Stan Iliscrman may win the
100, he may run third. Malott
looks like a cinch in the 220, but
Jordan and Talley can beat any
thing else we have for the places.
Ileiscrman will probably stick to
the low hurdles, in an attempt to
beat Viekery. He has at least an
even chance there, but Lafond
should take the third. At best
Stanford can get little better than
an even break in the points.
J he high hurdles must be doped
for U.S.C,, with Humphreys, former
Sacramento J.C. ace. Hawkins and
Simpson are at least second and
third, and one of them may sneak
home ahead of Humphreys. How,
nobody knows.
'1 he 440 is Stanford's with Ma
lott, but U.S.C. gets second and
third on almost any dope sheet.
Miller ol Troy is capable of giving
Malott a heat anytime, they say.
The 880 may be a sweep for Troy,
or we might get third. Mahurin
probably won't he able to compete,
with (hat bad ankle: but even with
him we can't hope to beat Roulac
and maybe Zampcrini.
The mile must be conceded to
Zamperini over Burrows, on past
performances, but Burrows could
surprise a lot of people. He rates
even with Zamperini in the two
mile, if they both run and have both
run the mile earlier. Jensen should
pick up the third for Troy in the
mile, and Ganahl should be in there
lor third in the two-mile. Stanford
is pretty close to even in the two
distances.
Stanford will be hard pressed to
sweep the shot, and may not even
get first in the discus, with Gaspar
having tossed 157 recently. Give us
third, possibly second, in the javelin;
(he same in the broad jump; at least
an even break in the high jump, and
nothing in the pole vault, and what
do we have?
Well, we have something around
50 points, that's what we have.

little.
For instance, as far as is known
U.S.C. has two line men in the
sprints, and one who is far from
slow. Tally and Jordan can handle
most ol the regular run of college
spl inters, and Mickey Anderson will
at least stick with the regular run.
Maybe they have someone else, but
even il they don't that trio is enough
to win a majority of the points in
the sprints against Stanford.
Stan Iliscrman may win the
100, he may run third. Malott
looks like a cinch in the 220, but
Jordan and Talley can beat any
thing else we have for the places.
Ileiscrman will probably stick to
the low hurdles, in an attempt to
beat Viekery. He has at least an
even chance there, but Lafond
should take the third. At best
Stanford can get little better than
an even break in the points.
J he high hurdles must be doped
for U.S.C,, with Humphreys, former
Sacramento J.C. ace. Hawkins and
Simpson are at least second and
third, and one of them may sneak
home ahead of Humphreys. How,
nobody knows.
'1 he 440 is Stanford's with Ma
lott, but U.S.C. gets second and
third on almost any dope sheet.
Miller ol Troy is capable of giving
Malott a heat anytime, they say.
The 880 may be a sweep for Troy,
or we might get third. Mahurin
probably won't he able to compete,
with (hat bad ankle: but even with
him we can't hope to beat Roulac
and maybe Zampcrini.
The mile must be conceded to
Zamperini over Burrows, on past
performances, but Burrows could
surprise a lot of people. He rates
even with Zamperini in the two
mile, if they both run and have both
run the mile earlier. Jensen should
pick up the third for Troy in the
mile, and Ganahl should be in there
lor third in the two-mile. Stanford
is pretty close to even in the two
distances.
Stanford will be hard pressed to
sweep the shot, and may not even
get first in the discus, with Gaspar
having tossed 157 recently. Give us
third, possibly second, in the javelin;
(he same in the broad jump; at least
an even break in the high jump, and
nothing in the pole vault, and what
do we have?
Well, we have something around
50 points, that's what we have.
—Peterson.
O MATTER how you dope it, if
you ie anywhere near honest with
yourself you can't find Stanford
winning the meet with U.S.C. this
Saturday. While it may not be
pal i iotic to concede your opponent
victory before you start, it is also
just common sense in this case to do
SO.
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. infor
mation tycoon, can stretch his
imagination to a maximum of 58
points for Stanford, he says; his
minimum is somewhere ii} the
middle 30 s, with the most likely
total somewhere between 40 and 50.
With what might be termed a
good performance in the face of
the tremendous odds they fate,
the Cards might reach 50 points.
II they score anything more they
can claim a moral victory. With
an ordinary performance the score
is liable to be closer to 40 than
to 50.
The Trojans have so many stars
this year again 4 hat they are in a
class by themselves. And not only
that, but anyone making out a dope

of the unheard-of athletes at U.S.C.
can find himself missing a lot of
