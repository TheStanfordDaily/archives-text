# Tiny Discovers Able Prospects In Scrimmage
## Mentor Chooses Four New Squads As Athletes Return 
### 
Heavy scrimmage and the return j
of nearly all the prospects from
other spring sports have enabled '
Coach Tiny Thornhill and the rest !
of his coaching staff to determine
the potentialities of the spring foot- j
ball squad well enough to form four J
teams.
In most of the scrimmages Tiny |
has been running a first string of j
Norm Standlee at quarter, Pete Fay ,
at left half, Jim Groves at right half. !
and Bill Paulman at full. But Paul
man has been out with a sore knee •
and Sophomore Rod Parker has
been performing very capably at ;
both full and quarter.
Paulman, however, looks to be the '
most polished back on the potential i
first team when he is in shape. If j
Jack Clark comes through as ex- ;
pected, he will take up where he left)
off two years ago at end. Bill Mc- j
Elroy is being groomed for his run- '
ning mate. Stan Andersen and Pete
Zagar are the incumbent first team i
tackles.
Dick Sutton and Bob Dakan are '
in at guard with plenty of compe- i
tition from Paul Ugrin, transfer, j
Steve Keusseff, and Frosh Chick j
Orme and John Kerman.
Tony Calvelli still is far and away j
the best defensive center of a sparse (
crew with little Jakie Thompson, i
Wally DeWitt, and John Haffner ;
aiming for the understudy role.!
Claude Purkitt and Ed Johannessen ■
are two frosh who can fill in either '
at guard or tackle.
