# Stanford Spirit, No. 3
## 
### 
STANFORD spirit yesterday was defined in
this column as loyalty to the University as
an educational institution. Help, in the form
of gifts to the University, was mentioned as one
way such loyalty is shown.
Under this definition, others to the con
trary, I said I doubted if spirit really were de
clining among undergraduates.
Concrete confirmation of this opinion is con
tained in a news story on page 2 of this issue.
In the Stanford Fund drive, the Class of '38
tops all 47 others in number of contributors,
in percentage of total members contributing,
and is fourth in the total amount contributed.
This in spite of the comparative advantage in
personal wealth other classes may have.
President Wilbur, himself, has recommend
ed the Fund gifts as the most useful type of
aid the University could receive. The money
is not earmarked, may be used for the most
pressing needs as they arise.
Of course there are other ways of showing
spirit. But this way calls for a sacrifice where
it hurts the most right nowâ€”in the pocketbook.
That such sacrifices were made in this skep
tical age is good enough evidence for me.
