IF LABOR DAY plans go according to sched
ule tomorrow, faculty members and students
will stand shoulder to shoulder in the war
against v/eeds.
We don't expect that the pick and shovel ac
tivities of professors will run per capita output
off the graph. But it will give the Student-
Faculty Relations Committee a nice feeling to
see faculty and undergraduates fighting a com
mon cause against poison ivy. Besides that, a
>guad of uninhibited professors will help the
party along nicely.
We discovered at the Axe Society field day
that the faculty can come out from behind its
desk without trailing clouds of textbooks. To
morrow, with luck, we can cash in on some of
the talents that have been wasted in the dark
caverns under the Quad.
When we stop to dig the splinters out of
our hands, it will be encouraging to see our
aeon lecturer with his collar in rebellion and
his Phi Bete key flying as he assaults the wood
pile. And when we swear at the way dande
lions cling to the sod, it will be comforting to
hear some English professor fall back on
Shakespeare's robust Anglo-Saxon.
Of course, the presence of professors won't
bring sparkling merriment where otherwise
there would have been only blisters and sore
backs. But if the faculty members join in, they
can contribute more than physical work.
And that is saying a guite a bit, because
professors are known to be good men with
shovels.—J. C.
