# Getting Stagers Straight
## 
### 
Al EW weeks back, when Stagers' scholar
ship was up for okay by Ex Committee, a
rather curious state of affairs came to light
when it appeared that Stagers, supposedly the
official dramatic organization of the campus,
was still bound financially to the apron-strings
of Dramatic Council.
The basis for the misunderstanding comes
from the impression built up when Stagers
was hastily organized, that it was different
from the independent bodies that made it up.
It is not. Like old Ram's Head, or Sword and
Sandals, it is just another honorary society on
the campus. It does not represent the A.S.S.U.
in the dramatic field any more than Sigma
Delta Chi represents it in the journalistic field.
Because its membership includes the greater
percentage of acting talent on the campus,
Stagers has a practical whip hand on student
dramatics. But it is prevented from being a
closed dramatic corporation on the campus by
the fact that it is still under the financial thumb
of the Council.
It does not lose by this set-up; rather it gains.
In the first place, a certain amount of admin
istration is necessary for any group which
draws its funds from campus sources at large.
In the second place, its activities are not ham
pered by the arrangement. Although most
Stagers productions (Gaieties and Spring
Show) are successful, its less popular produc
tions, like readings, are cramped by the lack
of a fund to absorb losses. Since such minor
activities aie definitely part of the A.S.S.U. dra
matic activities, the students, through Dramatic

Council, should take on this burden in the name
of "onward and upward" for Stanford dra
matics.
The complaint sometimes heard that Dra
matic Council lacks initiative in building up
student dramatics is negated, in this case, by
the fact that Stagers has a majority on the
Council. In fact, for an honorary society, it has
more than the usual share of power.
While there is no definite crisis at hand, signs
of impending friction indicate that parties con
cerned do not know exactly where -they stand.
A little definition of position by Ex Committee,
or some other administrative source, may do a
good deal to keep student dramatics on even
keel in the future.â€”J. S.
