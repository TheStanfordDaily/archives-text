# BULL SESSION
## RAH! RAH! 
### 
"I OOK at that!"
I had been trying for half an hour to bring Bull
Session out of the everywhere into the here, but when
Bellwether accompanied his disgusted remark with a
grandiose gesture which spread yesterday's Daily all
over my typewriter, I gave up.
"All right, Bellwether," I said, "what now?"
"The Sob-Sisters' Singstunde," he said, "The Ro
manticists' Round-Table, The Gripers' Get-Together.
In short, this extravaganza of emotion and blab dis
played by our earnest defenders of the Stanford spirit.
Frankly, it nauseates me. All our professional pa
triots, out making the Circle S scream."
"But Emery," I said, "don't you believe in Stanford
spirit?"
"Certainly I believe in Stanford spirit, but I don't
see that that obligates me to make a fool out of myself
about something which automatically evaporates the
moment people start trying to define it. I'm as fond
of Stanford as anyone; there's no better place; but that
doesn't mean I have to indulge my penchant for un
mitigated guff about it." ,
"Stanford spirit isn't anything you can manufacture
by writing letters to The Daily; it isn't anything The
Daily can manufacture, except by a long-term policy
of working for the good of the students and the Uni
versity. It isn't anything that can be turned on with
a switch. It isn't anything you can create with a lot
of talk. It's there, all right, but it can't be put down
in neat little words—if one can call the things we've
been seeing lately 'neat little words'—it can't be cut,
dried, and placed on exhibit as 'Stanford spirit.' It
ain't that sort of animal."
"I think the idea behind all the furor is Stanford
spirit as it exists in a practical, material form; in
people's actions, the things they write. How do you
justify your stand in that regard?"
"I don't know, exactly. I suppose if I were to get
a little high-sounding myself, I would say spirit con
sists in supporting Stanfoi-d activities, Stanford ideas
and ideals, when they are worth supporting, and when
one can support them with a clear conscience. This
'My country right or wrong' idea is stupid; if one of
our officials or coaches does something wrong, some
thing we know is wrong, I can see no justification,
sentimental or otherwise, for giving him a pat on the
back and telling him he's a good boy.
"Stanford deserves loyalty, or its attitude, or its
administration becomes obviously wrong and unworthy
of the University, and when those actions are indica
tive of a wider evil, then I say hit 'em over the head
with the biggest club you've got.
"Stanford spirit doesn't lie in a lot of fine words and
empty phrases; it lies in so conducting yourself while
you're here that you represent in yourself the best
things in ihe Stanford tradition. Stanford spirit can
take care of itself, providing it has the right material
to work with. Do I make myself clear?"
"Well, Emery," I said, "aside from a strong tendency
to use fine words and empty phrases yourself—"
"Yes, I know, I know. And not the least of these is
'Stanford spirit.' But I'm fighting fire with fire, so to
speak. Go on?"
"Then I think you do."

of talk. It's there, all right, but it can't be put down
in neat little words—if one can call the things we've
been seeing lately 'neat little words'—it can't be cut,
dried, and placed on exhibit as 'Stanford spirit.' It
ain't that sort of animal."
"I think the idea behind all the furor is Stanford
spirit as it exists in a practical, material form; in
people's actions, the things they write. How do you
justify your stand in that regard?"
"I don't know, exactly. I suppose if I were to get
a little high-sounding myself, I would say spirit con
sists in supporting Stanfoi-d activities, Stanford ideas
and ideals, when they are worth supporting, and when
one can support them with a clear conscience. This
'My country right or wrong' idea is stupid; if one of
our officials or coaches does something wrong, some
thing we know is wrong, I can see no justification,
sentimental or otherwise, for giving him a pat on the
back and telling him he's a good boy.
"Stanford deserves loyalty, or its attitude, or its
administration becomes obviously wrong and unworthy
of the University, and when those actions are indica
tive of a wider evil, then I say hit 'em over the head
with the biggest club you've got.
"Stanford spirit doesn't lie in a lot of fine words and
empty phrases; it lies in so conducting yourself while
you're here that you represent in yourself the best
things in ihe Stanford tradition. Stanford spirit can
take care of itself, providing it has the right material
to work with. Do I make myself clear?"
"Well, Emery," I said, "aside from a strong tendency
to use fine words and empty phrases yourself—"
"Yes, I know, I know. And not the least of these is
'Stanford spirit.' But I'm fighting fire with fire, so to
speak. Go on?"
"Then I think you do."
—Allen Drury.
"I OOK at that!"
I had been trying for half an hour to bring Bull
Session out of the everywhere into the here, but when
Bellwether accompanied his disgusted remark with a
grandiose gesture which spread yesterday's Daily all
over my typewriter, I gave up.
"All right, Bellwether," I said, "what now?"
"The Sob-Sisters' Singstunde," he said, "The Ro
manticists' Round-Table, The Gripers' Get-Together.
In short, this extravaganza of emotion and blab dis
played by our earnest defenders of the Stanford spirit.
Frankly, it nauseates me. All our professional pa
triots, out making the Circle S scream."
"But Emery," I said, "don't you believe in Stanford
spirit?"
"Certainly I believe in Stanford spirit, but I don't
see that that obligates me to make a fool out of myself
about something which automatically evaporates the
moment people start trying to define it. I'm as fond
of Stanford as anyone; there's no better place; but that
doesn't mean I have to indulge my penchant for un
mitigated guff about it." ,
"Stanford spirit isn't anything you can manufacture
by writing letters to The Daily; it isn't anything The
Daily can manufacture, except by a long-term policy
of working for the good of the students and the Uni
versity. It isn't anything that can be turned on with
a switch. It isn't anything you can create with a lot
of talk. It's there, all right, but it can't be put down
in neat little words—if one can call the things we've
been seeing lately 'neat little words'—it can't be cut,
