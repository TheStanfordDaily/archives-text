# GOIN' MY WAY
## BACK TO CHICAGO 
### 
|>Y NOW most of the fuss attendant to Gene Krupa's
leaving Benny Goodman has died down, and
through the welter of the cat's moans, the beating
drumsticks, and clarinet takeoffs it is beginning to
appear (hat Benny will be the winner of the batlle.
Benny, a positive master of the public pulse, has
felt that the repetitious drum breaks, the too loud
brass choruses, and just blare, blare, blare without due
regard to the possibilities of the sax choir were things
that the public was beginning to consider bad taste.
He felt that a return to the style that was responsible
for his success would be better for the band. After
all, "Sing Sing Sing"' was just about the ultimate goal
for any recording drummer.
So when Bonny asked the band to soften down,
Gene, who was too easily "sent" by the psuedo-sophis
ticated observers, was unable to accede to Benny's re
quest. So—the parting of the ways.
Now, Gene has left Goodman and been replaced
with Tommy Dorsey's drummer, Dave Tough. When
Tough, a mean drummer in his own right, went over
to Goodman, Tommy Dorsey's tenor man, Bud Free
man, felt that he couldn't swing out unless he had
Tough backing him up, so ho, too, wont over to Good
man. And then Tommy Dorsey's guitarist went over.

CO NOW it looks like we are in for an era of softer
music from Benny, more on the order of his "Blue
Skies." Krupa, who has organized his own band, will
be beating out the loud, torrid tempos, and Dorsey
will In* si-arching fur more replacements.
