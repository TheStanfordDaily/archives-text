# TRANSFERS ATTENTION

### 
To Ex Committee and
The Daily Staff:
The lack of Stanford training
which Lloyd Lapham showed in his
editorial of yesterday is, I believe,
sufficient grounds upon which to
bar junior transfers from positions
as editors of The Daily.
It is obvious that Lapham under
stands little of the sentiment at
tached to this institution. To him,
this University is nothing more than
a place to get an education, and it
is impossible for one who has been

at Stanford as short a time as he
(1 Vis years) to realize that when we
say that word Stanford, we mean
something which cannot be defined
in terms of a political platform.
Everything that is Stanford's, a
true Stanford man believes in.
whether it be showing loyalty on the
Stadium Green, adding to Stanford's
wealth by scholastic awards from
without, or painting toys in the Con
valescent Home Drive in order to
do one's share in putting this integ
ral portion of the Stanford dish on
the menu for another year. But, ac
cording to the sentiment of Lapham,
one should do only that which will
better himself and to hell with Stan
ford.
As though this junior transfer had
not done enough harm already by
openly admitting he was at Stanford
to get all he could, he proceeds to
tell (and thereby prove to) Bill
Leiser—founder of the Buck-of-the-
Month-Club—that he is using his
position as editor not to represent
the Associated Students, as he has
been chosen to do, but to represent
Lloyd Lapham. He tells Dink
Templeton, who has lived at Stan
ford since he was 10 years old that
Stanford is nothing more than an
educational institution, and he de
nounces true Stanford men as tak
ing the sport pages too seriously.
Lap, you don't know what Stan
ford is all about. Next time, give
the editorship to a Stanford man.
A Stanford Man of Two Generations.
