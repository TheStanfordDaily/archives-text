# Yearbook Sales Continue Today
## 
### 
Quads will be on sale in front of
the Post Office today and tomorrow
from 8 to 12 o'clock, according to
Quentin Birchard, circulation man
ager.
Orders have been already placed
for over 75 per cent of the total num
ber of Quads to be printed, Birchard
announced, and all seniors are ad
vised to place their orders as soon
as possible. Sales so far this year
indicate that the Quad will be sold
out earlier than last year.
Earlier delivery will be made to
those students who have ordered
their Quads with their name on the
cover, it was stated by Birchard.
