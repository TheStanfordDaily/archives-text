### BILL MILLIS 
r JMIE ROOSEVELT RECESSION,"
as it has developed up to now,
has been most serious in its effects
upon wage standards and the num
ber of unemployed. In the past
nine months the downward sweep
of American business hit wages first
of all, then brought slight reductions
in the cost of living, and has yet to
result in significant declines in cor
poration dividends.
In this situation labor is turning
from political to economic, particu
larly strike, action in order to safe
guard gains already secured. In
dications of past weeks have point
ed to a new wave of strikes, which
would be of more importance than
the continued warfare between the
American Federation of Labor and
the Committee for Industrial Or
ganization.

From Washington and from the
Pacific Northwest yesterday came
news confirming such predictions.
In the national capital, representa
tives of self-styled "independent
unions," with an asserted mem
bership of 200,000 in major corpo
rations, significantly urged Con
gress to so amend the Wagner
Labor Relations Act as to place a
Federal ban on strikes for higher
wages and to abolish the present
National Labor Relations Board.
Frank Bow, counsel for the cen
tral council of Tom M. Girdler's
Republic Steel Corp., presented a
petition to Congress blaming the
Wagner Act for "doing more to dig
this pit of depression and bury labor
in it, than anything else." He pre
dicted early establishment of a "Na
tional Council of Independent Labor
Unions."
Most of the "independent un
ions" have been described by the
NLRJt as "company-dominated"
organizations.

THE SAME time, immediate
curtailment of Federal arbitra
tion of industrial disputes, coupled
with an investigation of the opera
tion of the Wagner Act, were de
manded in a resolution passed un
animously at the annual convention
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Th e businessmen applauded
when Sen. Edward R. Burke (D.,
Nebr.) urged that NLRB mem
bers resign, but remained silent
when C. S. Ching, U. S. Rubber
Products Inc. "labor specialist,"
told them that "we haven't had
much sense in this situation."
Protesting against the use of in
dustrial spies, he said that "we bet
ter begin to get acquainted with or
ganized labor."

In Tacoma, Mayor George A.
Smitley telegraphed former-Stan
ford comptroller Almon E. Roth,
secretary of the Waterfront Em
ployers Assc., demanding immediate
reopening of that port, which was
closed by shippers following a CIO
AFL dispute.
Meanwhile, the northwest dis
pute involving independent sailors
and AFL longshoremen, on one
side, and CIO longshoremen, on
the other, may spread to other
Pacific Coast ports if the AFL can
enforce its boycott on all cargo
diverted from Tacoma.
