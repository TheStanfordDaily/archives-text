# Comedy Depicts Insane Asylum
## Half-Prices Available For 'Johnny Johnson' 
### 
"To get Stanford students to act
crazy is a more difficult job than
you might imagine" says Gordon
Lange, who is directing the Division
of Speech and Drama's forthcoming
[production of "Johnny Johnson,"
scheduled for May 6 and 7.
"One of the most interesting
stories in the play takes place in an
insane asylum where Hal Kahn,
Phil Brown, Bill Goetze, and Bud
Cady, as inmates must sing silly
songs, dance dizzy dances, and act
like so many children drunk with
joy," continued the director.
Weill Writes Score
The music in this and other scenes
is described as full of dissonances
and strange harmonics with a jazz
note.
Kurt Weill, t+ie composer, like
Gershwin, is a leader of the bizarre
school and invariably' ties the satiric
and comic into his peculiar modern
rhythms. He is a German exile,
former child prodigy, composer of
symphonies and at present is work
ing for Paramount Studios.
Raymond Kendall of the Music
Division is directing the two piano
and organ arrangements which he
finds "exciting" in such scenes as
the High Command where 15 gen
erals go berserk with laughing gas
and race madly about a 20-foot
table, Johnny upon their shoulders
—the saviour of the world.
