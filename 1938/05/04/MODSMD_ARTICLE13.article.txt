Canoe Races
Replacing last year's two-man j
canoe race will be a similar four
man contest this year. Meyer ex
plained the change by pointing out. j
that "the canoes will float lower and
move faster to provide more thrills j
and spills all around."
In the canoe turn-over event, con- j
testants will paddle to a marker, I
turn over their canoes, right them |
again, and paddle back.
