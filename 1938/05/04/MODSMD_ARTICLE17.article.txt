# Brunch Profits Set New High
## Strawberries Run Out As 1300 Fill Court 
### 
Shooting the Convalescent Drive
thermometer up to the tune of $225
clear profit, 1300 Stanford men and
women "brunched" on Roble-fed
strawberry-shortcake and coffee in
the Union court at noon yesterday.
Total receipts were $235.85, ac
cording to Ticket Chairman Ken
Koch, compared with $248.66 gross
'and $165.61 net for last year's
Brunch, making this year's turn-out
by far the largest on record. Caught
short by the unprecedented demand,
the Brunch Committee exhausted
all strawberry sources in Palo Alto
during the afternoon and served
strawberry ice cream on cake from
3:30 o'clock on.
Ravazza Sings
As planned, the fountain played,
Carl Ravazza sang songs, and the
Robleites in red and white wait
resses' costumes circulated freely
among the groups of relaxing
brunchers, handing out the wel
come desserts.
Co-chairmen of the lawn-lunch
eon were Mary Kay Horton and
Stan Swafford. All supplies were
donated by Palo Alto merchants.
Meanwhile plans went forward for
the Flying Club's air show, to be
held tomorrow afternoon at the Palo
Alto Airport. Six to 10 airplanes
will parade over the campus at 12:45
o'clock tomorrow, it was announced
last night.
Tickets on Sale
Tickets are to be sold today and
tomorrow on the Quad and at the

Another drive money-maker is
contribution by Nipa Hut of all its
profits tomorrow. The Hut is on El
Camino Real, just south of Redwood
City.
Contribution boxes have been
placed at strategic spots around the
campus by George Concannon, so
donors will have no trouble finding
what to do with extra changc.
