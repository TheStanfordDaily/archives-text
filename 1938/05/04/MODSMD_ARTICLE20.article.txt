# Faculty Men Join Students In Home Work
## 
### 
Today is Labor Day—one time of
the year when Stanford remember 3
it really is a "Farm" after all.
All afternoon classes will be dis
missed, it was announced yesterday
by the Committee on Public Exer
cises.
High point of the annual Conva
lescent Home Drive, Labor Day is
the day when a horde of studehts—
professors also, this year—converges
on the Home and spends the after
noon cutting weeds, painting and re
pairing toys, spading flower beds,
piling wood.
While clean-up work is in prog
ress, the Stanford Band will give
two concerts for the Convalescent
Home children, who watch the pro
ceedings from the porch.
Then at 5 o'clock, after the work
is finished, laborers sit down to a
barbecue, at which will be served
| all the chops off 30 lambs — 925
pounds altogether.
An all-Universit; jolly-up will
be held in the Pavilion from 7 to 9
o'clock, with music by A1 Sebring.
Ping-pong final are scheduled for
9 o'clock, immediately after the
Jolly-up, in the Pavilion.
"Judging from the way the weeds
have been growing lately, the work
at the Home this year is going to be
a big problem in organization," says
Labor Day Chairman Dave Ryus.
He asks that cars enter the Home
grounds by the main gate on El Ca
mino Real. Parking facilities will
j not be available lor those entering
! through the Cactus Gardens, ho
j says.
So everyone can find something
to do, Labor Chairman Way Leon
ard this year has instituted a central
casting bureau, to be located on the
grass circle between the two main
buildings.
"To complete this job," says Leon
ard, "we'll all have to pull together
for three and one-half hours."
He asks all workers to report at
1 o'clock to Art Gore at the casting
bureau, emphasizing the necessity
for participation by the frosh.
To remind people that they are
needed at the Home, Ben McGuire
will spend the afternoon bellowing
through a public address system, as
Jack Kessel drives him around in a
sound truck.
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, superintend
ent of the Home, said yesterday
students will not be allowed in the
buildings during Labor Day as a
precaution against spread of colds.
Medical attention in case of any
injuries, she says, can be obtained
at the superintendent's office.
Entertainment during the barbe
cue has been arranged by Hoke
Roberts. The informal program is
scheduled to begin as soon as work
ers have been served their shares of
the 1700 sandwiches, 40 gallons of
potato salad, and 10 square yards of
beans.
"Maybe we'll wait till everyone
has finished eating," said Roberts
yesterday, "so they won't have any
thing left to throw."
Singers on his program are to lx*
Shirley oJnes, Owen Clark, Yvonne
Hazlett, and Pete Fay. The A.K.L.
orchestra plans to play.
Presenting his "latest findings in
child psychology," Walt Wickett
will appear, as will Roberts, with the
accordion and bass fiddle, Harrison
Stephens with the guitar, and Art
! McHugh. Bud Cady will be mas
i ter of ceremonies.
Meat carvers for the barbecue are
! Roy Adamson, Ed Gaylord, Hank
! Houser, Don McCodder, Elton Boone,
j Chuck Maher, Haken Bush, Frank
Wooden, Max Moore, Ed Chirk, and
Rodge Aston.
