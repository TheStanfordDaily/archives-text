# Speaker Shows Movies of Hunt For Fossils
## Process of Mounting Dinosaur Remains Described in Lecture 
### 
Ancient dinosaurs roamed on the
Farm last nightâ€”but they roamed
across a screen to the jerky pace of
Memorial Hall's 90-feet-a-minute
motion picture equipment.
Arthur Sterry Coggeshall, archeol
ogist and paleontologist, was the man
who brought the saurians to Stan
ford, in a Tuesday evening lecture
entitled, "Exploring for Dinosaurs."
Movies of a geological expedition in
Northeastern Utah, descriptive slides,
and one reel of "Lost World" illus
trated his address.
Process Described
Mr. Coggeshall began his lecture
by describing in detail the process
of discovering, unearthing, and
mounting dinosaur bones. He illus
trated this by stills of the animals
as they once looked, and by movies
of the exploring party, of which he
was a member.
The fossils were found mainly in
the Devil's Playground in Utah,
which is now being made into a
"Dinosaur Monument" under the
United States National Park system.
'Lost World' Shown
One reel of "Lost World" was then
shown by Mr. Coggeshall, giving a
vivid picture of dinosaurs in their
native haunts as they lived eons
ago. The movies were made by
photographing plastic clay models in
different positions with appropriately
scaled-down backgrounds. Mr.
Coggeshall said that if the existence
of the earth were compared with a
24-hour day, dinosaurs evolved in
the late afternoon, and man has ex
isted for about one minute.
