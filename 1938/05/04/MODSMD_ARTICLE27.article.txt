# Savants Plan To Save Life of Famed Tree
## 
### 
In order to save the life of El
Palo Alto, historic redwood from
which the city gets its name, a screen
may be erected at the bridge to
shield the tree from the clouds of
locomotive smoke.
Dr. George J. Pierce' and Dr.
James McMurphy, professors emeri
tus of botany at Stanford, have sug
gested a complete plan to preserve
the tree, which is being considered
by the city engineer.
Conditions Bad
According to the Farm specialists,
the condition of the Palo Alto has
for years been so evidently bad that
widespread interest has been ex
pressed in its preservation and, if
possible, its improvement. The ef
forts already made have amelio
rated its condition, but the city
gardener has been wise to plant
young redwoods near-by, to suc
ceed the old trees when it falls ol
dies standing.
Since the tree is old, there is less
chance of its adjusting to changing
conditions but in order to help it
survive the Professors McMurphy
and Pierce have suggested a six
point procedure.
Cement at Base Needed
"First, that the small amount of
cement work at the base of the tree
be repaired by a competent tree
surgeon so that the baxk will have a
chance to overgrow an inlay instead
of rotting under plaster.
"Second, that the dead limbs
overhanging the railroad right-of
way, recording and displaying the
damaging effects of locomotive
smoke, be removed.
"Third, that the tangles of small
branches at various heights along
the trunk be thinned, so that the
foliage of those left may have more
light and air.

"Fourth, that liberal watering of
the surrounding soil be continued
throughout the dry season.
"Fifth, that the Southern Pacific be
consulted with a view of lessening
the smoking of the tree if possible.
"Sixth, that it be recognized that
any further interference with the
roots of the old tree, such as cutting
a subway to connect the upper end
of Alma Street with the Mission
Highway would be serious if not
fatal."
