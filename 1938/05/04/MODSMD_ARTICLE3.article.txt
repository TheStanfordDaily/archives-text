# Ryus Named Chairman Of Pre-Reg
## Axe Society Status Discussed by Excom; Awards Granted 
### 
After clearing routine business off
the slate, Ex Committee last night
settled down to a round-robin dis
cussion of Axe Society. The subject
was broached by Lloyd Lapham
when he asked the Committee to
consider what might be interpreted
as a general trend in making Axe
Society a "second Cardinals."
Chief bone of contention in the
discussion that followed was that
Axe had jumped the gun on pre
registration program by organizing
a committee to offer suggestions to
Ex Committee and the steering body
on pre-reg plans.
It was pointed out by Tom Kille
fer that Axe was by no means in
charge of the program, but was
merely offering its aid when needed.
Mention was made of the fact that,
like any other organization, Axe was
founded as a service organization.
Said Chuck Fontius:
"If they arc actually interested in
doing something, we should not be
the ones to squelch them."
It was held by some members that
duties taken over by Axe this year
(field day, pre-reg aid) should be
done by Cardinals, as the admini
strative body was formed specifical
ly to be the sole agent of Ex Com
mittee policy.
Pre-reg Chairman: Dave Ryus was
appointed chairman of the freshman
orientation period, with the Steering
Committee under him to be desig

ing the program.

gestions were made that the letter
be more emphatic.

strative body was formed specifical
ly to be the sole agent of Ex Com
mittee policy.

After clearing routine business off
the slate, Ex Committee last night
settled down to a round-robin dis
cussion of Axe Society. The subject
was broached by Lloyd Lapham
when he asked the Committee to
consider what might be interpreted
as a general trend in making Axe
Society a "second Cardinals."
Chief bone of contention in the
discussion that followed was that
Axe had jumped the gun on pre
registration program by organizing
a committee to offer suggestions to
Ex Committee and the steering body
on pre-reg plans.
It was pointed out by Tom Kille
fer that Axe was by no means in
charge of the program, but was
