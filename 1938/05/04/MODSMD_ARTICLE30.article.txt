Stanford spirit controversy
goes on and on. The editor seems
to have put his foot in it, by taking
a crack at something he thought
wasn't quite right. Everybody and
his brother has his oar in, now.
1 hose interested probably read
Campus Opinion yesterday, and
they also probably read the edi
lotiul in re a Campus Op. .Now,
the sports editor has done his best
lo keep lus highly fragile nose out
of a highly violent controversy,
but this is too much. That Cam
|iu.\ Op. strikes a tender spot, and
nose or 110 nose, a guy has to light
back once in a while.
The Stanford gentleman who
wrote that letter is no doubt an old
whip from way back, who is so
thoroughly steeped in Stanford dye
thai he'll never leave the place. But
most Stanford gentlemen are not so
glued to their love that they can't
recognize the right of a comparative
outsider to come to love the old in
stitution, too.
It that Stanford gentleman was
raised I rom a tadpole with one of
his cardinal aims in life the accom
plishment ol a Stanford education,
like some, and then couldn't get the
whole four years, he wouldn't sound
oil. There are man> students at
Stanford who were born and raised
to Stanford spirit, but they couldn't
handle the financial angle when they
came of entrance age.
It s a iunny school that would
bar anyone from becoming an ar
dent supporter, just because he
couhln ) tiiifl means to come to the
school for his entire college edu
cation.
To drive home the point, let's
not forget that the present track
captain, Ray Malott, a great competi
tor every time he's out there run
ning for Stanford, is a junior col
lege transfer. Why, say. since he's j
a transfer, he's not capable of hold- I
ing in his heart the old feeling that
makes a man singularly Stanfordish,
according to the logic of the Cam
pus Opinionator. Just the same, he
won't be dropped as captain on that
ground, for a while.
To take some more instances, how
about Tony Calvelli, Bill Jameson,
Al Lazzarone, Stan Hiserman, Carl
Mahurin, and Jack Weiershauser, to
mention just a very few of transfer
athletes who have a reputation for
loving the old school.—Peterson.

nose or 110 nose, a guy has to light
back once in a while.
The Stanford gentleman who
wrote that letter is no doubt an old
whip from way back, who is so
thoroughly steeped in Stanford dye
thai he'll never leave the place. But
most Stanford gentlemen are not so
glued to their love that they can't
recognize the right of a comparative
outsider to come to love the old in
stitution, too.
It that Stanford gentleman was
raised I rom a tadpole with one of
his cardinal aims in life the accom
plishment ol a Stanford education,
like some, and then couldn't get the
whole four years, he wouldn't sound
oil. There are man> students at
Stanford who were born and raised
to Stanford spirit, but they couldn't
handle the financial angle when they
came of entrance age.
It s a iunny school that would
bar anyone from becoming an ar
dent supporter, just because he
couhln ) tiiifl means to come to the
school for his entire college edu
cation.
To drive home the point, let's
not forget that the present track
captain, Ray Malott, a great competi
tor every time he's out there run
ning for Stanford, is a junior col
lege transfer. Why, say. since he's j
a transfer, he's not capable of hold- I
ing in his heart the old feeling that
makes a man singularly Stanfordish,
according to the logic of the Cam
pus Opinionator. Just the same, he
won't be dropped as captain on that
ground, for a while.
To take some more instances, how
about Tony Calvelli, Bill Jameson,
Al Lazzarone, Stan Hiserman, Carl
Mahurin, and Jack Weiershauser, to
mention just a very few of transfer
athletes who have a reputation for
loving the old school.—Peterson.
Stanford spirit controversy
goes on and on. The editor seems
to have put his foot in it, by taking
a crack at something he thought
wasn't quite right. Everybody and
his brother has his oar in, now.
1 hose interested probably read
Campus Opinion yesterday, and
they also probably read the edi
lotiul in re a Campus Op. .Now,
the sports editor has done his best
lo keep lus highly fragile nose out
of a highly violent controversy,
but this is too much. That Cam
|iu.\ Op. strikes a tender spot, and
nose or 110 nose, a guy has to light
back once in a while.
