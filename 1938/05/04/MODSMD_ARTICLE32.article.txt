## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Card Trackmen Meet Trojans Next Saturday L.S.C. Team Alleged Strongest in Country; Favored Over Indians 
### 
Scheduled to depart Friday night
for the Southland, Stanford's track
men are working out daily on An
gell Field in preparation for next
Saturday's meet with Coach Dean
Cromwell's Trojan horde from
Southern California.
Yesterday, the annual inter.squad
meet was held, with the Indians
turning in several good times against
a stiff wind. Captain Ray Malott
won the 660-yard run in 1:21, which
is splendid time.
Trojans Favored
Bill Hawkins led Sid Hayes, frosh
phenom, and Dick Simpson to the
tape in the 120-yard high hurdles.
Time was 14.9 against a burst of
wind.
r l he Cardinals aren't considered
to have a chance against the Tro
jans, who boast the strongest track*
team, club or collegiate, in the
country today. The men of Troy
swamped Cal earlier in the season
when they were far from top shape.
However, S.C. is now rounding i
out in all events and all of the 1
Cromwell stars will be ready to go
against the Injuns. Nevertheless,
Coach Dink Templeton will have
some surprises for Cromwell. In al
most every event except the 880
and pole vault, Stanford has men
capable of winning if they perform
at their peak. Of course, it is ex
pecting too much of a team for every 1
man to come through, but if just a
handful do sneak into winning spots
the meet will be interesting.
Mile Thrills Seen
The mile and two-mile are ex
pected to overshadow all other 1
events. Edson Burrows, conqueror i
of all he surveys in the Bay Region ;
college circles, will meet Louis Zam
perini, who experts predict will be
the greatest distance man in the his- 1
tory of the United States before he !
graduates.
The two men are sure to meet in â– 
the mile, and it is probable that each 1
will run the two-mile also. Zam- |
perini has the better time at each (
distance but Burrows never runs for !
anything more than victory.
Captain Ray Malott should be a
sure winner for the Stanfordites in
the 440, but Erwin Miller, who was
a flash at jaysee, may extend him 1
for the Trojans.
In the furlong Malott may not
have it so easy. Adrian Talley a.nd 1
Payton Jordan are two of the best
college sprinters in the country and
each has run the 220 close to 21
flat. They could easily place one
two if Malott is too tired from his
quarter-mile effort.
Stan Hiserman will have to face J
the same men in the 100. and un- i
less he can stay with them on the i
start he is liable to be subjected to
a rude defeat.
