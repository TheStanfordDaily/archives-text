ONE trouble with being a brilliant young col
lege editor is that there always is a chance
that somebody is going to come to your sup
port. Opposing Campus Opinions can be»
shrugged off, but someone always appears,
tells you he is all for you, then tries to tie
a tail of half-baked ideas onto your private
little kite.
Such is Thirty-nine, who said he was agreeing
with me in yesterday's Daily. In the course of
a tirade against the athletic set-up he loosed a
barrage at Graduate Manager A1 Masters:
"And how about that brain boy, A1 Masters.
Stanford is run for Stanford students. Hooey.
Come a basketball game and Masters' eyes
gleam. To hell with Stanford students; the less
tickets they buy the more the general public
will buy at twice the price."
There Thirty-nine bit on one of those old
ones we save for sophomores around The
Daily. Each winter some lower member of the
staff bursts into the editor's office and cries:
"The basketball tickets are all sold out al
ready and they couldn't have sold them all.
I'll bet they're saving a big wad for general
sale. You know Masters has the power to
hold out up to 500."
And the editor wearily lifts the phone, or
more often goes over to the 8.A.C., and gets
the exact figures—so many to the students, so
many comps, so many to the visiting school, so
many reserved by Block S men. Usually he
goes away admiring A1 for shaving it so close,
for figuring so exactly as to get the Pavilion
full and so eliminate complaints. Or, at an
other time, for seeing that some of the best
seats in the stadium aren't empty at game
time.
All I tried to do a week ago was trace a
future trend from present observable factors.
But Thirty-nine would turn it into a means of
airing his personal, misconceived gripes.
And so I agree with the sage who said, "God
save a man from his friends."
