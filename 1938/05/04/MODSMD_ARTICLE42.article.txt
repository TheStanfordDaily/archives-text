REMOVED from the hysteria of election time,
Stanford will sit down sanely to consider
its student government at the Leadership In
stitute next week. It will forget the grandiose
promises of candidates for reform, and will
settle down to the real problem of Stanford's
student administration—making a good system
work better.
Rather than tilt the windmills which attract
the attention of vote-seeking candidates, the In
stitute will attack the fundamental fault of our
system — that the administrators of Stanford
government simply do not know their business.
The Institute will give them a chance to learn
it, or at least get a first leg on finding out what
their job is before they move on. If prospec
tive officers only learn how to conduct a com
mittee properly, something will be gained.
Perhaps the biggest problem the Institute will
face is that of spreading jobs. Certain mech
anisms like the card files already in existence
will help to cure our major evil. But they are
not used. Future committee leaders will be
taught to take advantage of these, and other
devices to spread appointments, and will be
given hints on how to go a little farther on the
path to greater activities participation.

The Institute will also attempt to bridge the
gap which is formed by the yearly turnover in
committees. Continuity in activities will do
more to clear up the Stanford muddle than a
dozen suggestions for sweeping reform by dis
contented politicians.
And third, the Institute will attempt to make
honor code instruction more complete and more
effective than it is now. This instruction will
only concern sponsors, but it is perhaps the
most important duty of the Institute.
The whole structure of student government at
Stanford rests on the code. Unless it works,
the students fail to show an ability to govern
themselves, either educationally or politically.
Since the judicial councils report that most in
fractions of the code are through ignorance,
sponsors and other leaders will do well to pay
heed to the Institute's suggestions.
Campus reformers will scream that the Insti
tute is paying all its attention to trifles, with
out stopping to think that on these trifles every
administrative system is built. It is obvious,
they will say, that any fool can handle a com
mittee properly.
Granted. But the Institute's answer is that a
fool who has learned his job can do it a lot
better.—J. S.
