HIGH PRESSURE
ONE who knows anything about it, or has had
anything to do with it, will criticize the Conva
lescent Home's objectives l management, or purpose.
It has the advantage of being the sort of institution
which does not—in itself—go out of its way to seek
charity.
It welcomes contributions; but it does not demand
them. It realizes that some cannot give so freely as
others, and it takes what it can get with gracious
thanks. There can be no justified criticism of the
Home as such.
But there is one thing everyone can criticize, and
that with good reason. The student Convalescent
Home Drive, as it is now conducted, is becoming more
and more to be nothing but a concerted and tiresome
grab for every penny it can possibly bludgeon out of
the student-body.
The Tag Day chairman's remark that, "Anyone who
doesn't buy one is a heel," was probably not meant with
any such intent as was later placed upon it. It was
still too typical to be passed over lightly. More and
more every year the attitude it represents is creeping
into the Drive; more and more every year Stanford's
leading charity is becoming a competitive enterprise,
rather than a generous contribution to the welfare of
a fine institution.
There is a great deal of pleasure to be derived from
giving; but it evaporates in a great hurry when it be
comes as organized, as matter-of-fact and mechanical,
as the Convalescent Home Drive now makes it.
Sales-girls for such things as Tag Day and the
Strawberry Brunch, not content to lassoo their unsus
pecting victims along the Quad, even go so far as to
invade classrooms and the Libe. Various chairmen
with more vim and vigor than tact and imagination let
loose upon the students a horde of eager solicitors,
each with her tag or her ticket or her bright idea, each
with her inevitable propensity for getting underfoot.
Such things may be done in sweet charity's name, but
they're extremely annoying, for all that.
Nor are committees and sale-girls the only things
deserving of criticism. The whole timing of the Drive
has been at fault this year, indicative of an increasing
tendency to get the whole bothersome business over
with as soon as possible. Lumped into two weeks are
more events than are either worthwhile or necessary,
the campus is kept constantly excited about its great
opportunity to kick in another $2.56 every time it turns
around; nobody is given time to relax and catch his
breath. Charity is a business, and every little worker
is in it to make as much as possible in as short a time
as he or she possibly can.
It is too late now to make any change in this year's
Drive; but it might be a Rood idea for Drive heads
next year to go just a little easier on their suffering
victims. No one minds giving in a good cause, but
patience wears a little thin when subjected to the con
stant strain it has been under this week.—Allen Drury.
