"JAWING, but soft."
K In three small words, that is the formula for
what the public likes as seen by Carl Ravezza.
Yesterday we mentioned that there is an apparent
trend from the brass band type of swing to the softer,
more melodic types as characterized by the old Benny
Goodman records, Red Norvo's records and the better
Casa Loma waxings.
Confirmation of the trend by Ravazza, who has the
best band in the S;ui Francisco hotels at present for
our money, proves the young maestro has discerning
eyes as well as an excellent voice.
Carl, as most of you know, was the vocalist in Tom
Coakley's band when it was the rage in S. F. When
Coakley gave up the music game to go into law, Pa
vezza took over the band and under his name. Feeling
that perhaps he could do better, he changed his name
to Ravel, and started out on a lour after the manner
of Tom Gorun who used to be Tom Gerunovich. The
tour taught him one thing; he found out that the name
Ravazza was better known to dancers than Ravel.
<« * * *
jV'OVV he's back ;it the Persian Room in the Sir Fran
cis Drake but not with the same group with which
he began. There is only one man, Lyle Bcrdo, trum
pet, who is left from the original Coakley band. His
present instrumentation is four saxes, two trombones,
one trumpet, violins, and the regular rhythm section.
"In our present set up," Ravazza says, "we've a
black velvet drop in back of the band. We've found
that to get the best results over the air. and on the
floor we've had to do some experimenting with the
vibr.itos of the brass horns. Now that we've got them
figured out, we sound much better."
As for the style of the band, it is our opinion that
he is putting out the best dance music in the hotels.
His arrangements, which are by Frank Flynn, the
drummer, Lyle Berdo, and the guitarist who also
doubles on accordion, aren't tricky nor sophisti
cated nor loud, but good.
"People want peppy music," he says, "and if you
play it too loud, you drive them off the floor. What
they wiint is swing, but soft!" Pat McGurk.

"People want peppy music," he says, "and if you
play it too loud, you drive them off the floor. What
they wiint is swing, but soft!" Pat McGurk.
"JAWING, but soft."
K In three small words, that is the formula for
what the public likes as seen by Carl Ravezza.
Yesterday we mentioned that there is an apparent
trend from the brass band type of swing to the softer,
more melodic types as characterized by the old Benny
Goodman records, Red Norvo's records and the better
Casa Loma waxings.
Confirmation of the trend by Ravazza, who has the
best band in the S;ui Francisco hotels at present for
our money, proves the young maestro has discerning
eyes as well as an excellent voice.
Carl, as most of you know, was the vocalist in Tom
Coakley's band when it was the rage in S. F. When
Coakley gave up the music game to go into law, Pa
vezza took over the band and under his name. Feeling
that perhaps he could do better, he changed his name
to Ravel, and started out on a lour after the manner
of Tom Gorun who used to be Tom Gerunovich. The
tour taught him one thing; he found out that the name
Ravazza was better known to dancers than Ravel.

jV'OVV he's back ;it the Persian Room in the Sir Fran
cis Drake but not with the same group with which
he began. There is only one man, Lyle Bcrdo, trum
pet, who is left from the original Coakley band. His
present instrumentation is four saxes, two trombones,
one trumpet, violins, and the regular rhythm section.
"In our present set up," Ravazza says, "we've a
black velvet drop in back of the band. We've found
that to get the best results over the air. and on the
floor we've had to do some experimenting with the
vibr.itos of the brass horns. Now that we've got them
figured out, we sound much better."
As for the style of the band, it is our opinion that
he is putting out the best dance music in the hotels.
His arrangements, which are by Frank Flynn, the
drummer, Lyle Berdo, and the guitarist who also
doubles on accordion, aren't tricky nor sophisti
cated nor loud, but good.
