# CAMPUS OPINION
## IDEA 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Well, Tag Day is finally over. Af
ter spending all yesterday dodging
beautiful young freshwomen and
looking as though I had forgotten
to take the price tag off my new
coat, it's a relief to stroll down the
Quad and have people say "Hello,"
instead of "Hello—won't you buy a
tag?"
Not that I mind having cute young
Robleites dash up and speak to me
when, under normal conditions, they
are as frigid as they can be. . Noth
ing of the kind!
However, if we must have Tag
Day (which is debatable), let's do
it thoroughly. Instead of receiving
a tag for our dime, why not make
it a kiss. Upon first glance, this
would seem rather hard on the
Robleites, but think of all the money
that would be taken! We could also
use some Encinamen as salesmen.
Instead of merely, hoping for a
total of $300 at the end of the day's
work ,they could take in that much
in a few hours. Under my plan, we
could have Tag Day for a week and
with the proceeds derived thereof,
support the Convalescent Home for
a month without need of any other
drives.
Of course, the name should remain
'Tag Day" in deference to any par
ents or other people who might read
The Daily. But the spirit of the
thing would be greatly improved and
it might be one means of reviving
the Stanford tradition of informality.
Sincerely,
—W.M.
P.S.—lnstead of calling people who
don's buy tags "heels," we could
have them psychoanalyzed.

The Editor, Sir:
Many of us have been transfers
and have tried at least, although we
haven't been Stanford men of two
generations, to understand Stanford
and the life lived at Stanford.
The Stanford Man of Two Gen
erations has a good deal more grace
than you have. I think this is
beautifully indicated by your entire
ly unnecessary editorial with the
caption "Six Little Aliens," and the
"Transfers Attention'' heading to
his letter, intimating that what he
meant directly at you was directed
elsewhere as well. Shrugging it off,
as it were. What's the matter? A
little ashamed? Crawling, I thought.
The few with whom I have spok
en on the matter and I distinctly
agree that anyone as mercenary as
you openly are has no business rep
resenting a school as fine as Stan
ford in any kind of position, let
alone one as responsible as the one
you are misusing.
—L. B. Boyer.
