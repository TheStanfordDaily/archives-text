The Editor, Sir:
Now that everybody has made ,
nasty cracks at each other and stuck ;
their tongues out and made hideous ,
sounds all about "Stanford spirit" |
maybe it's best to stop all that stuff ;
now.
"Stanford spirit," my, my. When J
the time comes that we have to have |
arguments or even bring up and try
to put in tangible terms the phrase, |
"Stanford spirit," it surely is a
sign of some sort of decadence.
"Stanford spirit," dear readers is i
not a material thing, nor is it some- {
thing that you put into a bottle, 1
cither literally or figuratively.
"Stanford spirit" is an attitude, a
point of view, an outlook on one's
whole life at the University.
Stanford is a university and com
munity that still holds the old fron- ;

tier outlook that kept true Ameri
can individualism going; the reflec
tion of the days when democracy
was really something.
It started as a collection of indi
viduals who came here for an edu
cation and a cultural outlook on
life.
Today, thank the lucky stars,
Stanford is one of those rare demo
cratic universities in which one may
still have that outlook of individual
ism and not be an outcast. But the
outlook and attitude is one of demo
cratic individualism, not one of
"rugged individualism."
Each student comes here with a
different attitude. If he be prepar
ing for a profession he might have
one outlook. A girl here for cul
ture and a husband may have an
other. Each has his own point of
view as to his university life. Col
lectively, that is called "Stanford
spirit."
It is intangible, and when the time
comes that we argue and say silly
things over it, that's bad. So sup
pose we stop being foolish and just
have our own attitudes and do them
well and stop worrying about what
other people think.
