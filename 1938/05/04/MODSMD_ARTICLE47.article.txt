# MORE HO HUM

The Editor, Sir:
You may say that loyalty to Stan
ford as an educational institution is
the main plank on your platform;
that spirit can be measured in terms
of money bags donated to that end.
But you can't expect anyone to be
lieve such a statement.
Otherwise, you wouldn't spend
night after night burning the oil in
The Daily shack. Instead, you
would hide yourself in some dusty
corner and feverishly pour over
musty manuscripts and your tat
tered textbooks.
Come, come, Mr. Editor, surely
you must think there is more to
college life than grade points. If
not, why do you waste away valu
able hours for such pointless pur
poses, as padding an edit column
every 24 hours. Why. not leave it
to someone who has the honesty to
live his own testament?
â€”One four-thousandth.
