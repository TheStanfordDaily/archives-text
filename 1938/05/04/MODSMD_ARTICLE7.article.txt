# Kids' Letters Praise Convalescent Home
## 
### 
It was raining last Thursday when
seven boys came to the Convales
cent Home to stay. They were small
boys and they weren't used to being
that far away from home without
their parents and it was raining.
They weren't very happy. They
were ill, and they were in a strange j
place. But they were boys, and in ;
a little while it was time for lunch j
and they began to forget that they i
were lonesome.
With the rest of the Convalescent 1
Home kids who didn't have to eat j
in bed, they went into the Home's !
little dining room. They looked I
around the room at Wolo's drawings, j
trying to avoid the eyes of the rest i
of the kids.
Wouldn't Eat
When their food came in they ;
started to eat, but soon Mrs. At- \
wood noticed that they had all ■
stopped. She asked them what was j
the matter.
'"What's that stuff?" one of them j
said, pointing to his asparagus.
She told them what it was. j
"Haven't you ever had asparagus?" |
None of them ever had. "Why don't j
you eat it?"
"How do you eat it?" they asked. !
They didn't even know how to eat J
it, and she had to show them.
They liked asparagus. "When are j
we going to have it again?" they j
wanted to know. Already they were '
beginning to feel at home.
It never takes the kids long to |
feel at home there. They are having j
new experiences. They're in a '
happy atmosphere. They go to the
Home to get well, and they have fun |
doing it.
Likes the Home
You can get that from their let- j
ters. Jennie wrote to her mother, i
"Boy, this Convalescent Home is j
swell. Yesterday we saw a mamma ;
quail and a papa quail with a whole |
bunch of tiny baby quail. And there I
are rabbits and squirrels and two j
big ducks and seven baby ducks*." |
It's the first time that most of the j
kids have been able to get outdoors!
and away from town. Even the com- [
mon birds around the Home amaze
some of the kids.
The kids like Mrs. Atwood, and j
that helps make the Convalescent j
Home pleasant . to them. Lillian j
wrote to her mother:
"Mrs. Atwood, oh she is very j
pretty, I like her very much. I like !
the nurses too. But nobody is very I
pretty like Mrs. Atwood." .
Some of the letters have a touch '
of pathos, of course, but that's na- |
tural. So do letters written by j
first quarter freshmen.
Mike wrote to his parents. "Dear j
Ma and Pa, I was sad because you !
went away sad. Next Sunday when
you come don't be sad be happy and
gay, I am happy and gay so you be

happy and gay too."
Then some of their letters are
funny—when they don't mean them
to be. They don't have much con
nection in showing what the home
is like, but they're interesting to
read.
This one written by Mary, for in
stance, sounds a little like some
thing by Dos Passos. She writes,
"Ma, what shall I get for Christmas
if I am here, a Shirley Temple doll
or a doll that wets its pants. If I
get a Shirley Temple doll or a doll
that wets its pants. If I get a Shir
ley Temple doll will you promise
me that you'll get me a doll that
wets its pants.
"I asked Miss Hope what shall I
get and she said a doll that wets its
pants. Because I always wanted a
doll that wets its pants. I would
like a doll that wets its pants best
of all. I never wanted a Shirley
Temple doll, so I left it up to you."
And sometimes when you think
that $6144 is a lot of money for Stan
ford people to be giving to a Con
valescent Home every year, go out
to the Home and read some of the
grateful letters that parents have
written in.
Just go out and read them.

They didn't even know how to eat J
it, and she had to show them.
They liked asparagus. "When are j
