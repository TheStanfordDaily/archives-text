The New Palm Beach Suits
Men arc talking about ''soft tailoring"
...but Palm Beach deserves credit for
inventing comfortable, unlined, un
padded clothes. The new lounge models
are masterpieces of the British Drape
school...with broader shoulders, slim
mer waists, a trimmer look, a smarter
air than ever before. You can choose
from plain or sport back models...in
whites, Airtones or deep shades of blue,
gray and brown. All easily cleaned or
washed, wrinkle-resisting — and the
answer to "what'll I wear"—now, and
all next summer. See them today at
your favorite clothier.
And be sure to look over the new Palm
Beach slacks at $5.50
