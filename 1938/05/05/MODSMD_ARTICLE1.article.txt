### BILL MILLIS 
FOOKING OUT upon a Rome em
blazoned with thousands of brown
and white Nazi swastikas for the
"friendly visit" of German Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler with Premier Benito
Mussolini, Pope Pius XI yesterday
told a delegation of 500 newly mar
ried couples that the swastikas "cer
tainly are not Christ's cross."
The Pontiff's declaration was
ignored in all Rome newspapers
—ju tas the Vatican organ, Ob
servatoro Romano, made no men
tion of the arrival of Hitler—ex
cept the Catholic Avenire, which
reported it under a headline read
ing "heart-breaking warning of
the Pope!" (
Pius' statement again makes clear
that all is not well between the Ro
man Catholic Church and the fas
cist regimes of Italy and Germany,
and that the church has little hope
for an early settlement with the
Third Reich over religious and edu
cational rights for Catholics.
m lis *
Meanwhile, Der Fuehrer, in his
first public address since his arrival
in Rome, reminded an audience of
06,000 German residents of Italy that
their first loyalty must be to "the'
Fatherland." II Duce, who attended
the the meeting unexpectedly, stood
by silently while he spoke.
Predictions that the Rome-
Bcrlin axis is cracking should gain
in insistence, since "associates"
of Mussolini said that he had re
jected Hitler's offer of a new Ger
man-Italian military pact and
had, in its place, urged German
acceptance of the "realistic pro
posal" of the Neville Chamberlain
government for a Four Power Pact
involving Germany, Italy, France,
and Great Britain.
"Informants who were in a posi
tion to know" reported that at their
two-hour conference yesterday,
Mussolini told Hitler that he wishes
to serve as an "honest broker" in
the present European diplomatic
negotiations.
These reports signify no funda
mental "break" in the Italo-Ger
nian alliance, hut rather than II
Duce, probably only for the mo
ment, is again desirous of "friend
ship" with England and its diplo
matic dependency, France.

/GOVERNMENT CONTROL of
banking is a "live" possibility,
Chairman Jesse Jones of the Re
construction Finance Corp. predict
ed at yesterday's sessions of the U.
S. Chamber of Commerce annual
convention.
Declaring that hanking is a
franchise which carries responsi
bility and "not merely privilege,"
Jones condemned "cautions and
antiquated lending policies" and
reminded the business men of
pending legislation providing for
government absorption of Federal
Reserve hanks.
He said that RFC loans of $20,-
400,000 to business since February
indicate the magnitude of American
credit needs.

Upon the basis of New Deal vic
tories in the Florida primary elec
tion, the administration believes that
it will now be able to force congres
sional enactment of the long-pending
wage-hour bill.
...Proponents of the bill were en-,
.couraged by the overwhelming,
.victory of Sen. Claude Pepper af-.
.ter a campaign in which his ap-.
.proval of the bill was an impor-.
tant issue.
The fight will come to a head to
morrow, when Rep. Mary Norton,
New Jersey Democratic chairman
of the House Labor Committee, files
a petition, which will require 218
signatures, to discharge the bill from
the deadlocked Rules Committee.

by silently while he spoke.
Predictions that the Rome-

of Mussolini said that he had re

acceptance of the "realistic pro

"Informants who were in a posi

Mussolini told Hitler that he wishes

the present European diplomatic
negotiations.
