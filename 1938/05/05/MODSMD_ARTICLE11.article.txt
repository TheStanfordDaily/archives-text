# Hostel Manager Discusses Work
## 
### 
Experiences with the youth hostel
movement were related to the lunch
eon Club yesterday by Warren
Blodgett, California field worker for
the American Youth Hostel Asso
ciation.
Mr. Blodgett told how the idea
was started by a German school
teacher to enable his pupils to take
longer hikes. He also recounted ex
periences he had while managing a
hostel in Massachusetts last year.
Over-night and week-end visitors
showed extraordinarily willing
spirit, he said, in helping to furnish
his hostel. The empty house do
nated to the A.Y.H. was entirely
furnished and decorated by hikers.
Even the plumbing was installed by
sympathizers with the movement.
