# Labor Day Program Puts Farm To Work
## Stanford Prepares for Carnival After Cleaning up Home Grounds 
### 
Stanford rolled up its shirt-sleeves yesterday, worked all afternoon at
the Convalescent Home, ate barbecued meat as it listened to an informal
program, and danced at a iolly-up in the Pavilion.
It was Labor Day—high point of the annual Convalescent Home Drive,
which closes this week with an air show today and the Junior Water Car-

•nival tomorrow.
Approximately 500 students
worked throughout the afternoon,
according to an estimate by Labor
Day Chairman Dave Ryus, while
about 1200 attended the barbecue.
Successful Day
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, Hbme's super
intendent, commented last night on
the day's success. She was particu
larly pleased, she said, to have the
Home's El Camino Real gateway
cleaned up. About 50 men worked
thei*e, cutting weeds and spading
around shrubbery.
The day's schedule for children at
the Home was shifted so they could
watch the students at work and lis
ten to several concerts by the Stan
ford Band.
"They're better than they were at
Easter," said one little girl.
High points of Hoke Roberts' pro
gram given during the barbecue
were Pete Fay, who sang mostly,
and Bob Mallett, who made a sur
prise appearance, giving imitations
as Nelson Eddy, Bing Crosby, Wal
ter Winchell, and Franklin D. Roose
velt.
Roberts Draw, Laughs
Roberts drew laughs and applause
with his bass fiddle, accordion, t and
"dead-pan" side vo-narks.
Meanwhile floats are being con
structed for the Junior Water Car
nival, to be held at Lake Lagunita
tomorrow afternoon.
Prizes will be awarded for most
beautiful and most humoi-ous floats,
judges being Professors Elmer D.
Fagan, Theodore H. Boggs, and Ber
nard F. Haley.
