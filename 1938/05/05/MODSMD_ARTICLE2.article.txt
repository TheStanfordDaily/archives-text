# New 3121 Era? Just Date Jam
## 
### 
When VV. D. Dillinger, mana
ger of the Palo Alto phone com
pany. and William Ridden, head
of Toyon exchange conferred yes
terday, the campus had hopes
(hat 3121 was being ushered into
a new era of better service.
But it turns out that the con
ference was called only because
Hall men arc in too much of a
.hurry to get their dialing over
and their girl on the phone.
Callers attempt to force the dial
back after they have dialed one
figure, thus getting wrong num
bers and slightly damaging the
phones.
Warning signs have been put
up in the booths, and Mr. Rigden
believes that no further difficulty
will arise.
