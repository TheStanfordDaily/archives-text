# Remaining Delta Sigs Hold Two-Man Meet
## 
### LYMAN WEAR 
Gerald Marcus and Boh Hartmann are today the last student members
of Delta Sigma Rho, national forensic fraternity.
Marcus, who is the society's president, and Hartmann, Chappie editor,
| held their first meeting this year recently when they met on the lawn in
front of the Administration Building to lay plans for an annual after-

omner speaking contest.
The membership is relative to the
ability of the debaters as a whole,
Marcus said. Those elected are an
nounced each year at the annual
debate dinner during the last of
Spring Quarter.
The fraternity itself is largely in
active, the two members added,
however, it is the oldest known de
bate fraternity in the country, hav
ing chapters at the larger universi
ties.
There are several alumni of the
fraternity among the faculty here,
according to Hartmann. Professors
Leland Chapin, faculty debate ad
viser who is now on leave, James
Gordon Emerson, and Edgar Eugene-
Robinson, were members.
