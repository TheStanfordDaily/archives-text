# Farm Tankmen Drill For Next Year's Tilt
## 
### 
A month's spring practice in water polo is helping to fill the sports
lull that usually comes around May 1.
Out at Encina Pools, Nort Thornton is drilling a squad of over two dozen
hopefuls in all the techniques of the water game, and from the looks of
the men iiÂ» action, Stanford might have another championship crew next
fall.

Back from last year's third place ;
team is Capt. Johnny Lamb, All- j
Coast forward, and host of other 1
first string players. Guards Bill j
Hatch and Dick Hoover were first '
string last fall and Bob Plate showed j
great prospects at center back and |
sprint. He is tentatively slated to '
keep the sprint post, according to j
Thornton.
' Veterans Come Back
Then there is Harvey Rothschild, j
another veteran who ended the sea- i
son at guard, and Lloyd Wilson, al
ternate goalie.
Jack Loupe, a potential first
stringer two years ago who left j
school, is back and is teamed with |
Lamb at the forward post. Big Roy
Vitousek of the frosh is leading the
goalies at present and Thornton pre
dicted a great future for him in the
net.
Prospects Good
At least a dozen other promising
freshmen and experienced players
offer Thornton prospects for a sec
ond team that should prove capable.
First game of the spring season
will be an alumni-squad affair on
May 19. Starting on May 25 the en
lire squad will begin the annual in- ;
terclass championships. Each team j
will meet every other team in a |
round robin ending on June 2.
