## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Laughing Boys To Take Floor For Last Time Hoopsters Schedule Convalescent Home Benefit on May 12 
### 
| It's Stanford's last chance to see
the world's greatest basketball
: player.
What's more, it's Stanford's last
chance to see the third and final
edition of John Bunn's "Golden Era"
of hoop teams.
The occasion is a benefit game—
j all proceeds, at four-bits- a head—
I going to the Convalescent Home.
Time and place of this gigantic na
tural is 8 o'clock, Thursday evening,
; May 12, in the Pavilion.
Hank Heads List
Heading the list of all-star per
-1 formers is Stanford's all-time All—
: American £>f the hardwood, Angelo
Henry Luisetti.
He will captain and coach the
senior team, which will be opposed
by those basketballers who have
one or more years of competition
[ yet to come.
; Aiding and abetting the senior
; cause will be the gentlemen who
have boomed for such a long time
! to carry Stanford to the top as the
| nation's basketball teams.
Play Last Game
There'll be Art Stoefen, Jack Cal
derwood, Beebs Lee, Nellie Heath,
i and Bill Rapp—every one of 'em
| going out on the floor here for the
j last time in a full-length game.
Under the other basket will be
the gentlemen who are scheduled
I to carry on for dear old Stanford on
! the country's basketball floors come
next season. They'll be coached by
j John Bunn.
Daring to oppose the famed
j Laughing Boys will be Phil Zonne
; (he laughs, but he's a junior), Tom
Siebert, Darrell Huddleson, Leon
i Lafaille, Don Burness, Gil Rahn,
j Wilbur Anderson, Ken Davidson,
j and Mike Marshall.
Bunn Takes Bow
Incidentally, it may be the last
game for John Bunn as an active
coach. He's been appointed Dear
of Men, and will take office this fall.
His successor has not been named.
Tickets for the game, at 50 cents
each, are now on sale at the A.S.S.U.
' office.
In the meantime, spring practice
jis going on as usual. Fundamen
tals are being stressed above every
thing, the thought being, most of
I all, to keep in shape. Occasional
j scrimmages help to coordinate the
i fundamentals with actual work.
All work, though, is leading up to
j this tilt, which will be the final event
j in this year's drive to help out Stan
i ford's most active activity — the
| Convalescent Home.
