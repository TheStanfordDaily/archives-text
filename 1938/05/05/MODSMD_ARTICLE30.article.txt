He will captain and coach the
senior team, which will be opposed
by those basketballers who have
one or more years of competition
[ yet to come.
; Aiding and abetting the senior
; cause will be the gentlemen who
have boomed for such a long time
! to carry Stanford to the top as the
| nation's basketball teams.
Play Last Game
There'll be Art Stoefen, Jack Cal
derwood, Beebs Lee, Nellie Heath,
i and Bill Rapp—every one of 'em
| going out on the floor here for the
j last time in a full-length game.
Under the other basket will be

i fundamentals with actual work.
All work, though, is leading up to
j this tilt, which will be the final event
j in this year's drive to help out Stan
i ford's most active activity — the
| Convalescent Home.
