'"pHERE are several things of in
terest happening in the basket
-1 ball world these days, even though
| the next season is still something j
more than six months away. First j
of all, John Bunn will attend a
southern division coaches' meeting'
in Los Angeles Saturday, as report- !
ed elsewhere in The Daily today.
I Also of importance is the offer ;
by Referees Ernie Bailly and
Lloyd Leith to referee the Con- \
valescent Home basketball game j
between the graduating team and
next year's varsity. May 12. The
two veteran bay region arbiters
will contribute their services as j
part of the Drive.
Tying in with that is the fact that
the game will be played under the
new rules laid down by the national
| rules committee early this year in
; Chicago. Although there were no
fundamental changes made, there
were two of fair significance that
| should interest fans who attend the
I game.
i Most significant of the two is the
| decision that permits a player not
1 in possession or control of the ball
I to remain in the outer half of the
i free throw circle for any length of
time. % Previously the three-second
j rule held for the entire free throw
i area, but that was found unneces
-1 sary as well as bothersome.
In connection with this, John
Bunn will present to the P.C.C.
coaches the proposal of the na
tional committee tbat the "slot"
under the basket be widened to 12
feet, or the width of the free throw
circle, and thai the oblong area
thus created by those boundaries
j and the free throw line be con
' sidered the three-second area,
j Phog Allen of Kansas wants to try
it in his conference, the Big Six, as
! well. The national body particular
| ly asked the P.C.C. to try it inas
| much as it had been a fine proving
| ground for the center jump elimi
| nation restriction.
Of second importance in the
| changes of significance made this
j year is the rule permitting the es
tablishment of out-of-bounds lines
I at the ends of the court four feet
! beyond the backstop. This is made
| optional, so that courts that have the
r acilities may use it if they like.
[ What this means is that a ball
that hits the backstop and falls
1 over the back without hitting a
support remains in play so long
as it doesn't go more than four
feet past the backstop line. It
also permits the use of much more
j playing space under the basket,
which might not be valuable from
the scoring standpoint but which
should allow the execution of a
wider range of plays.
There were a group of minor
| changes that were put in to allay
j fears that the game was becoming
' too strenuous, also. The national
rules body has absolutely no evi-
I dence, according to John Bunn, that
j the game is becoming too strenuous,
| but it felt that the adoption of cer
tain restrictions which wouldn't
: hamper the game would tend to
make the game more popular with
i the fearful ones.â€”Peterson.
