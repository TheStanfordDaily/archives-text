# Zamperini May Meet Burrows Twice Saturday
## Trojan Ace Desires Double Test Against Card Distance Star 
### 
Determined to extend the power- |
ful Southern California Trojans to j
the limit Saturday, Coach Dink j
Templeton's cinderpath men are '
preparing to pack their traveling j
bags for their little excursion into
the wilds of Southern California. '
The Indians will depart tomorrow
evening.
Word has seeped out of the south- j
land that Troy's Louis Zamperini I
will run whatever races lanky Ed
son Burrows competes in. That is,!
the Zamp wants to tangle twice with j
Burrows if his coach, Dean Crom- j
well, will let him. They are sure to •
meet in the mile. The question is
whether Zamperini will run the
two-mile also or the 880.
Hurdles Crucial
The hurdles loom as crucial events
Saturday. In the high barriers, S.C.
has in Jim Humphrey, Ivy Bledsoe
and Lloyd Olson, a crew of men
capable of sweeping all nine points.
However, Bill Hawkins, Stanford's
in-and-out timber-topper, has been
showing up well lately.
Earl Vickery, S.C.'s red-headed
low hurdler, is favored in his event
and only Stan Hiserman seems a
possibility to defeat the Trojan.
Hiserman has been improving this
season, and may be the best college
hurdler on the Coast before the
present track campaign closes.
Loring "Bud" Day and Kenny
Dills, the southern school's success

feet last Saturday when the Trojans
swamped U.C.L.A. Day climbed to
14-7 and barely missed a new world
mark of 15 feet, while Dills con
tented himself with second at 14-4.
Irving Howe, the third Trojan pole
j vaulter, is also capable of 14 feet.

Determined to extend the power- |
ful Southern California Trojans to j
the limit Saturday, Coach Dink j
Templeton's cinderpath men are '
preparing to pack their traveling j
bags for their little excursion into
the wilds of Southern California. '
The Indians will depart tomorrow
evening.
Word has seeped out of the south- j
land that Troy's Louis Zamperini I
will run whatever races lanky Ed
son Burrows competes in. That is,!
the Zamp wants to tangle twice with j
Burrows if his coach, Dean Crom- j
well, will let him. They are sure to •
meet in the mile. The question is
whether Zamperini will run the
two-mile also or the 880.
Hurdles Crucial
The hurdles loom as crucial events
Saturday. In the high barriers, S.C.
has in Jim Humphrey, Ivy Bledsoe
and Lloyd Olson, a crew of men
capable of sweeping all nine points.
However, Bill Hawkins, Stanford's
in-and-out timber-topper, has been
showing up well lately.
Earl Vickery, S.C.'s red-headed
low hurdler, is favored in his event
and only Stan Hiserman seems a
possibility to defeat the Trojan.
Hiserman has been improving this
season, and may be the best college
hurdler on the Coast before the
present track campaign closes.

Dills, the southern school's success

"Heavenly Twins," both hit over 14
feet last Saturday when the Trojans
swamped U.C.L.A. Day climbed to
14-7 and barely missed a new world
mark of 15 feet, while Dills con
tented himself with second at 14-4.
Irving Howe, the third Trojan pole
j vaulter, is also capable of 14 feet.
Coach Templeton hasn't announc
ed who will make the trip for Stan

is as follows:
