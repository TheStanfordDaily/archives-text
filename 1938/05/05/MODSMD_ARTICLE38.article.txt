# Priming the Senior Pump

### 
Dear mother
This letter is going to be about money
and banks, which you won't consider unusual.
But three years in the wilds of the econ de
partment have left their marks on me, and I
am now using a new technique.
I want to know the name of your savings
bank—the one you use to pile up that fund for
Christmas presents. I am planning to start
building an account that will keep the wolves
of spring quarter expenses from fighting for
room on my doorstep next year when I am a
senior.
I have just seen my roommate go down for
the third time in a financial whirlpool, and his
experience has frightened me.
When he came to school this quarter he
thought he could get along on his usual budget
without having to do a Roosevelt. But he is a
senior, and spring quarter is open season on
seniors' bank accounts. Last night he figured
up expenses, and now he is in the market for
a cheap course that teaches safe cracking.
First he has to contribute to the Endowment
Fund. Then there are commencement an
nouncements and programs, caps and gowns,
and a couple of other items. After that he
joins the alumni association. Finally he buys a
bid to the Senior Ball, orders a corsage, and
sits back to wait for a nasty note from the
bank.
To a Tnan going through school on a slim
budget that combination looks like the na
tional debt. And when he adds in the Senior
Prom, the day of sunshine, and various other
renderings to assorted Caesars, he finds bankr
ruptcy breathing down his neck.
Of course, there's no law that makes him
stand for all the extra expense. But there's that
favorite of the psychologists, "social pressure."
And then, too, if he doesn't, he misses most of
the fun of graduating.
There is nothing we can do about it, unless
we want to wait for the Revolution to take the
profit motive out of our capitalistic system.
But I think I'll begin now, and take refuge
in the laws of compound interest. Then next
spring I won't have to mortgage the old home
stead to get out of here.—Love—J. C.
