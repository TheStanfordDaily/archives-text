# Mercy Without Straining

WITH every added organization which at
tempts to ride successfully through a proj
ect on Convalescent Home Drive publicity,
outcries from beaten purses mount higher. The
complaint that the purpose of the Drive is be
ing obscured by too many activities in too short
a time is becoming increasingly valid.
But the gripe which is often voiced at the
same time, "Why should we keep on shelling
out when Stanford is already giving enough
to keep the Home going?" deserves some cor
rection.
Stanford's contribution each year only
amounts to that raised by the Drive, enough to
keep the Home running for one month. No
other university or student funds are added to
the single contribution.
For the other eleven months, the Home de
pends upon such bodies as the S. F. Com
munity Chest, senior and junior auxiliaries,
Rotary Club, parents and friends, and its own
endowment funds.
Like these other organizations, Stanford is
under no obligation to contribute. It is no more
related, other than by tradition, to the Home
than other independent bodies. And, when ac
tual figures are compared, Stanford is doing
less than many other contributors to the Home.
So, though hard-touched Stanfordites com
plain that enough is rapidly becoming too
much, the campus contribution is really only
one splash in the Home bucket.â€”J. S.
