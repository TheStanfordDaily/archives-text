# It Can Happen Here
## 
### 
STANFORD'S branch of the A.S.U. will spon
sor a talk on "Where Is the Truth about
Russia?" tonight. The meeting is open to the
public.
This doesn't mean that after tonight we can
throw away our poli sci books. But it does
mean that we can put away some of our wor
ries about free speech and discussion at Stan
ford.
Undor our present system, no public meet

ing can be held on the campus without the
consent of the Public Exercises Committee.
The first and great commandment of the Com
mittee is a trustees' by-law which states that no
partisan meeting shall be sanctioned. This is
interpreted to mean that no public discussion
shall be permitted which does not present
both sides.
No one has a quarrel with the theory. A
university must present all aspects of problems
if it is to be anything more than institutional
ized propaganda machine.
But thwarted organizations have gotten into
the habit of complaining that the rule is used
to prevent free speech. They picture it as a
convenient muzzle which the Committee uses
to silence discussion on troublesome topics.
When the A.S.U. was denied a partisan
speaker last spring at Peace Day, it issued a
pamphlet which read like an obituary for
democracy. Similar howls have greeted every
application of the rule that partisan meetings
must be limited to the members of the spon
soring groups.
But tonight we will hear discussion on a sub
ject that is controversial in every sense the dic
tionary permits. The only provision is that soap
boxes be left at home.
That doesn't look like muzzling to us.â€”J. C.
