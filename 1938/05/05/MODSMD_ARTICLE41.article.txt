"JOIINNY JOHNSON"
' § I HERE was a time not so long ago when the Division
of Speech and Drama suffered beneath the slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune in the guise of nasty
comments from The Daily. This went for quite a
while, everybody with an idea or a new angle jumping
in with both feet. Anschluss between student journal
ism and student drama, never very close, grew re
moter than ever.
Whether this had any definite effect on the Division,
no one can say; but a certain willingness to consider
public opinion and public taste has of late crept into
the Division's selection of plays; and this concession—
at lease in the case of "Kind Lady"—has paid ample
dividends.
Now comes "Johnny Johnson," second popular ex
periment since the purge, and one which discusses a»
vital topic in so humorous and witty a way that it
should be as big a success as its predecessor.
Johnny Johnson is in a war; but he is no ordinary
recruit in a war. He tries to be sane; and one can't
be sane in a war. Once a war is begun the only sanity
lies in fighting to win; but Johnny doesn't know this.
In a vain attempt to restore his kind of sanity, he starts
out to convert the world to peace.
He tries to convert his fellow soldiers, he tries to
convert the enemy, he tries to convert the statesmen
and the generals and the munitions men. He uses
ordinary vocal persuasion, he uses laughing gas. a
troubador obsessed by a lost cause, he wanders
through the world on a hopeless mission.
And finally, when the play is over, he has ac
complished nothing. His one-man attempt to remain
sane in an insane world—or be insane in a sane world,
whichever way you look at it —has netted him nothing
but defeat; peace is no nearer, war no less demanding.
Thus "Johnny Johnson," which, accompanied by
the brillifnt modernisms of Kurt Weill's music, goes
on Memorial Hall stage tomorrow and Saturday nights.
And thus the Division of Speech and Drama, which is
finding out that it can do good experimental work and
still have it popular; that it can take into account the
tastes of its audience and still achieve valuable and
constructive experience for its actors.
"Johnny Johnson" may not be another "Kind
Lady"; or it may be worth 10 "Kind Ladys." In any
case, it will be a good play; an indication of what the
Division can do when it forgets its duty to be artistic
and concentrates on presenting good entertainment.

' § I HERE was a time not so long ago when the Division
of Speech and Drama suffered beneath the slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune in the guise of nasty
comments from The Daily. This went for quite a
while, everybody with an idea or a new angle jumping
in with both feet. Anschluss between student journal
ism and student drama, never very close, grew re
moter than ever.
Whether this had any definite effect on the Division,
no one can say; but a certain willingness to consider
public opinion and public taste has of late crept into
the Division's selection of plays; and this concession—
at lease in the case of "Kind Lady"—has paid ample
dividends.
Now comes "Johnny Johnson," second popular ex
periment since the purge, and one which discusses a»
vital topic in so humorous and witty a way that it
should be as big a success as its predecessor.
Johnny Johnson is in a war; but he is no ordinary
recruit in a war. He tries to be sane; and one can't
be sane in a war. Once a war is begun the only sanity
lies in fighting to win; but Johnny doesn't know this.
In a vain attempt to restore his kind of sanity, he starts
out to convert the world to peace.
He tries to convert his fellow soldiers, he tries to
convert the enemy, he tries to convert the statesmen
and the generals and the munitions men. He uses
ordinary vocal persuasion, he uses laughing gas. a
troubador obsessed by a lost cause, he wanders
through the world on a hopeless mission.
And finally, when the play is over, he has ac
complished nothing. His one-man attempt to remain
sane in an insane world—or be insane in a sane world,
whichever way you look at it —has netted him nothing
but defeat; peace is no nearer, war no less demanding.
Thus "Johnny Johnson," which, accompanied by
the brillifnt modernisms of Kurt Weill's music, goes
on Memorial Hall stage tomorrow and Saturday nights.
And thus the Division of Speech and Drama, which is
finding out that it can do good experimental work and
still have it popular; that it can take into account the
tastes of its audience and still achieve valuable and
constructive experience for its actors.
"Johnny Johnson" may not be another "Kind
Lady"; or it may be worth 10 "Kind Ladys." In any
case, it will be a good play; an indication of what the
Division can do when it forgets its duty to be artistic
and concentrates on presenting good entertainment.
