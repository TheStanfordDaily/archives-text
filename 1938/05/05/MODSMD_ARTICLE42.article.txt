(The editor of the Minnesota Daily discovered
that the funny papers were leaving him cold, and
began to ask why.)
JUDGING by the popularity of the "mayhem, murder,
•J and arson" type of comic strip, the reading public's
demand for humor is on the decline. The currently
most popular strip features a stone-faced super
detective who is never funny in any sense of the word,
although he appears in the comic sections of the news
papers. Indeed, he is never moved to smile except
when he dispatches three criminals with one shot or,
at most, two. Day after day this poker-faced nemesis
ferrets out murderers, smugglers and just plain rats,
whom he either bdats to a bloody pulp or promptly
shoots.
Another beloved strip has been criticized for spread
ing propaganda. Another discouragingly explains how
future mass killings will be executed with more fin
esse. Still another specializes in describing the terrors
of gang warfare. Many have been cited as objection
able for children.
To a lesser degree, the swing to tragedy is found in
the animated cartoon, "Snow White, etc." Disney
used to specialize in the side-splitting antics of Mickey
Mouse and his troupe, but in the opus magnificent we
see a very unappealing witch fall off a cliff to provide
a feast for vultures, a poor wretch who died of thirst
in a dungeon with a jug of water just beyond his
reach —all in addition to a plot concerned with the
poisoning of an adolescent.

r pHE evidence of a trend toward tragedy may be
more apparent than real, however. It seems more
plausible to blame the disappearance of the humorous
comic upon the scarcity of good cartoonists who are
also humorists. Comic strips depending upon nar
rative and dramatic incident for their appeal are good
at holding the reader's interest, and newspapers value
them highly for this reason. And the laugh, a delight
ful addition to anybody's day, is a fleeting thing, dif
ficult to find and more difficult to hold.
We refuse to believe that the public does not ap
preciate humor. We arc sure, however, that it prefers
an exciting story of death and despair rather than a
bad attempt to be funny. It is poor, delightful Dopey
and the lagging turtle that people talk about after
seeing "Snow White," not the dehydrated skeleton.
And much of the public is more eager to read of Dag
wood's troubles than to find out how the gangster's
moll got hung up by her thumbs.
Is there ,t cartoonist with an A-l sense of humor
