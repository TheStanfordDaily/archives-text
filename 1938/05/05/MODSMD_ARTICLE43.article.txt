# CAMPUS OPINION
## TWO GENERATIONS 
### 
Dear Stanford Man of Two Genera
tions:
Being also a Stanford student of
two generations and not a member
of The Daily staff, my opinion about
the Editorship of The Daily is as
good as, if not better than yours,
which seems to be biased because
Lloyd Lapham won't conform to
such petty politics as those of the
Buck-of-the-Month-Club in run
ning the paper.
If you were a real Stanford man
you would think as I do that Lloyd
is one of the most honest and non
partisan editors The Daily has had
in a long time. He has nerve enough
to try and run The Daily as a real
newspaper should be run instead of
as another activity run by the poli
cies of a partisan campus group.
As far as the Buck-of-the-Month-
Club goes, where is there any real
Stanford sportsmanlike spirit in
paying athletes to come to Stanford
which is obviously its purpose and
against all inter-collegiate rules? If
more students had the spunk to show
them up, we wouldn't support such
things. Lloyd has more real Stan
ford spirit and has been more truly
trained not only in journalism but
as a real Stanford man, the kind we
are prouder of, than the whole Buck
of-the-Month-Club put together.
You apparently don't know and
haven't tried to know Lloyd very
or you wouldn't make such
statements. If you really have a
true Stanford heritage, I don't see
how you can look at the Editorship
of The Daily in such an obviously
biased manner. As another Stanford
student of two generations, I am
heartily ashamed of your attitude.
