# THREE GENERATIONS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the interest of fair play, if noth- |
ing else, why don't some of you !
"outraged patriots" read Lap's orig- 1
inal, comment-provoking editorial,!
printed in The Daily of April 26, ;
rather than Leiser's garbled version? !
Particularly is this directed to the
kid who signed "A Stanford Man I
of Two Generations" to his letter in
yesterday's Daily.
That original editorial criticized
Templeton's ethics when Dink con- I
demned Luisetti, Burrows, Gamier, 1
and Rasmussen, on entirely un- j
tenable grounds, for lacking "true!
Stanford spirit." Lap's fundamental j
criticism was certainly sound — j
Dink's comments to the papers were j
;'°oidedly unethical. :
'li> sentiment, spirit and reputa- I
tion which attach to Stanford are
based fundanu ntally on the char- '
acter and true worth of the men and

women who graduate from this in- |
stitution. Football and track en
thusiasm is just the overt expression
of that spirit and *not the real basis
for it. It is not the duty of a "true
Stanford Man" to "believe in every
thing that is Stanford's" — but,
rather, to help and to criticize v/hen j
he feels it is in the school's best in- I
terests.
Contrary to the opinions of that
"Second Generation" screamer,
Stanford has always been willing to
recognize and reward merit among
transfers as well as four-year men.
Malott, Lapham, Kerr, and Calder
wood are all transfers, but all are |
as outstanding and as full of true !
school spirit as any man in or out of ;
Stanford.
The original edit was not offensive
to "true Stanford spirit — read it j
before you scream again!
Dick Riddell,
—A Stanford Man of Three
Generations, j
