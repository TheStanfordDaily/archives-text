The shortest time clement in engineering is probably
that encountered in short wave radio tube design
an allowance of 1 600,000,000 second for an electron
to travel a fraction of an inch.
2. A Wt tinghousc steel mill motor of this type can be
reversed from full ahead to full back in 5 seconds.
3. The West ing!louse-equipped streamliner "City of
San Francisco" is one of the two most powerful
Diesel-electric locomotives in use at this writing
5400 horsepower. Three years ago, the most powerful
train of this type was powered by a 1200 H.P. unit.
The purchase and development of the Gaulard &
Gibbs transformer patents by Geo. Westinghouse in
1885 led to our present widespread use of alternat ing
current, the foundation of electricity's universal
availability.
The lumens per watt of various types of electric lights
are as fol'ows: (a) Mazda lamp, (60 watt size) 13.9
lumens per watt; (b) mercury lamp (250 watt size)
30 lumens per watt; (c) Neon lamp, (average tube
and gas) approximately 19 lumens per watt.
The "De-ion" principle is one which breaks arcs into
segments 4>y passing them through a series of grids.
It has completely revolutionized the construction of
. such arc carrying devices as lightning arresters,
circuit breakers, motor starters, and safety switches.
"7 m The "De-ion" principle was discovered and put into
practice by Dr. Josej>h Slepian of the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories.
The "Spencer Disc" is a type of thermostat which
acts on the bi-metallic expansion and contraction
principle to give a rifle-like make-and-break in elec
trical contacts. It is an exclusive Westinghouse
elcctric iron feature, and is also used to protect
Westinghouse motors from heat damage.
The initials "P.C.C." in connection with the new
streamlined streetcars stand for "Presidents' Con
feren e Committee," a committee appointed by the
American Transit Association to design these cars.
By invitation, Westinghouse engineers worked with
this committee, and more than half of the cars of
this type now in use are completely equipped with
Westinghouse electrical apparatus.
10. The initials KDKA, representing the Westinghouse
pioneer station at Pittsburgh, Pa., mean "broadcast
ing" in the Eskimo tongue.

The shortest time clement in engineering is probably
that encountered in short wave radio tube design
an allowance of 1 600,000,000 second for an electron
to travel a fraction of an inch.
2. A Wt tinghousc steel mill motor of this type can be
reversed from full ahead to full back in 5 seconds.
3. The West ing!louse-equipped streamliner "City of
San Francisco" is one of the two most powerful
Diesel-electric locomotives in use at this writing
5400 horsepower. Three years ago, the most powerful
train of this type was powered by a 1200 H.P. unit.
The purchase and development of the Gaulard &
Gibbs transformer patents by Geo. Westinghouse in
1885 led to our present widespread use of alternat ing
current, the foundation of electricity's universal
availability.
The lumens per watt of various types of electric lights
are as fol'ows: (a) Mazda lamp, (60 watt size) 13.9
lumens per watt; (b) mercury lamp (250 watt size)
30 lumens per watt; (c) Neon lamp, (average tube
and gas) approximately 19 lumens per watt.
The "De-ion" principle is one which breaks arcs into
segments 4>y passing them through a series of grids.
It has completely revolutionized the construction of
. such arc carrying devices as lightning arresters,
circuit breakers, motor starters, and safety switches.
"7 m The "De-ion" principle was discovered and put into
practice by Dr. Josej>h Slepian of the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories.
The "Spencer Disc" is a type of thermostat which
acts on the bi-metallic expansion and contraction
principle to give a rifle-like make-and-break in elec
trical contacts. It is an exclusive Westinghouse
elcctric iron feature, and is also used to protect
Westinghouse motors from heat damage.
The initials "P.C.C." in connection with the new
streamlined streetcars stand for "Presidents' Con
feren e Committee," a committee appointed by the
American Transit Association to design these cars.
By invitation, Westinghouse engineers worked with
this committee, and more than half of the cars of
this type now in use are completely equipped with
Westinghouse electrical apparatus.
