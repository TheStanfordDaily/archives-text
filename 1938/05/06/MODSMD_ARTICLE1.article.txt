r PIIE most ingenious argument now
being advanced by the Repub
licans in their attack upon Roose
velt is that the New Deal "leads to
fascism."
Such a contention does not mean
that the Grand Old Party—which
wants a return to the traditional
prosperity of the Coolidge or pre-
War eras—is necessarily concerned,
because of any conviction of the
value of democratic social and poli
tical liberties, with the spread of
totalitarian dictatorships.
Rather, it is an example of wise
political sail-trimming, of adopt
ing a slogan based upon wide
spread popular sentiment and util
izing it for immediate partisan
ends.

Ex-President Herbert Hoover, in
a speech repetitious of addresses in
New York and San Francisco since
his recent return from Europe, pre
sented much the same argument
yesterday before a Republican
"grass roots" convention in Okla
homa City, saying that this country
is traveling a "dangerous road"
which ultimately ieads to fascism.
At the same time he asserted
that "despite every alibi, this de
pression is the direct result of the
Roosevelt Administration," and
proposed an 11-point program to
•'re-establish faith that ours is
going to continue as a system of
free men and private enterprise."
Reviving an old argument, Mr.
Hoover said that government
"manipulations" in 1933 stifled a re
covery that began a year earlier, and
later produced "an artificial and
distorted appearance of recovery"
climaxed in 1936-37.

days ago President Roose
velt placed his approval upon the
Anglo-Italian "friendship pact" as
an example of "the value of peace
ful negotiations." Yesterday this
hint of a new foreign policy for
America was made clearer by Sen.
Key Pittman (D„ NeV.), chairman of
the important Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee, who told the
United Press that. European and
World pcace depends upon the out
come ot the present conversations
of Adolf Hitler and Benito Musso
lini.
Echoing the British argument
that a "splendid opportunity" now
exists for realistic world under
standing, Pittman foresaw en
forced consolidation of recent
gains for Germany and no inter
vention in Czechoslovakia, if II
Duce stands by his recently con
eluded treaty with England and
refuses to sign a military alliance
with the Third Reich.

Meanwhile, the conferring Ger
man and Italian rulers halted nego
liations, and journeyed from Rome
to Naples to inspect what the gov
ernment proclaimed was "the big
gest naval review since the World
War."
Afterwards, military and police
reserves were required to calm
5(10,(100 riotous Neapolitans, who
had to wait six hours before giv
ing Der Fuehrer the most en
thusiastic welcome of his Italian
visit in Plcbiscito Square, where
(lie March on Rome, which Musso
lini safely followed in a railroad
train, was organized a decade
and-a-half ago.

In Washington the U. S. Chamber
of Commerce adopted terms for any
business- truce with the New Deal,
promising to co-operate with the
administration's recovery program
il it either scraps or revises such
measures as the Wagner Labor Re
lations Act.
"The business men of the coun-
Irv continue ready and eager to
utilize every opportunity to de
vole their best efforts to advance
these (recovery) purposes, their
unanimously adopted program
said.
