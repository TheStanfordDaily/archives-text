# 'Johnny Johnson' Play To Be Staged Tonight
## 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
The Division of Speech and Drama will present ''Johnny Johnson,"
Paul Green's Critic's Award winner, in the Memorial Hall at 8:15 o'clock
tonight and tomorrow night.
The play and its cast of 50 are under the direction of Gordon Lange
j who is assisted by Phil Brown.

â–º Robert Benchley says '"Johnny
' Johnson,' makes you laugh, cry,
boil. The first anti-war play to use
laughing gas in its attack on the
stupidity of mankind; the most ef
fective war satire I have ever wit
i nessed."
Phil Brown, in addition to dii'ect
ing and supervising the lighting, will
j play two parts in the play. One of
his characterizations is a seemingly
normal psychiatrist who in truth is
I not "all there." He condemns John
! Ny, who is very sane but misinter
j preted, to the insane asylum. He
is supported in this scene by Kay
Kalenborn who portrays the part of
his secretary.
Another member of the faculty,
H. Miles Heberer, will be seen in
the character of Brother Hiram and
| as an American priest.
Much of the dramatic appeal of
! the production is due to the com
plementary music which creates the
1 atmosphere to suit the action. It
was written by Kurt Weil who also
wrote the music for the songs in the
show.
Reserved seats for the play are
available in Memorial Hall from
Chester W. Barker. Presentation of
\ student body cards entitle students
to half-prices which are 50, 40. and
' 25 cents.
