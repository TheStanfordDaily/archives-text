j The Editor, Sir:
Being interested as much as Mr.
tW. M. in the Convalescent Home
Drive, we made a small survey to
estimate the value of his glorious
suggestion. The scheme is truly
touching, but, delightful and pleas
ant as it seems, like so many quick
ly conceived theories, it lacks only
the ability to pay dividends in prac
| tice.
Monday's drive grossed $251.55,
| representing dimes from somewhere
j near 2511 people. Mr. W. M.'s plan
i rests on the tacit assumption that
! Stanford men consider the privilege
j of kissing the beautiful Roble women
to be worth 10 cents. It is well
known that the male has outgrown
; this tendency at social age 15. From
! this it is fair to suppose that only
• the freshmen still consider this
' familiarity with the Roble inmates
!to be worth anything at all. There
| are less than 400 freshmen. Of these,
I six are members of the Oxford
| group, and don't kiss. Four don't
' know how to kiss. Thirty-eight
j wouldn't have a dime anyway.
[ Sixty-two have entirely too horrible
j a hangover to be out on Monday
| morning. And 120 have been around
' enough before coming to Stanford
jto know that Roble women aren't
| worth a dime. This leaves 170 and,
I forgetting the number of freshmen
! who might be in the rest home or
out of town, we can now expect to
| gross $17.
—J.B. & R.C.
P- S.—For the edification and re-
I habilitation of W. M. we have lo
j cated a reputable psychoanalyst in
| San Francisco who will be glad to
i see him for one hour three days a
! week.
