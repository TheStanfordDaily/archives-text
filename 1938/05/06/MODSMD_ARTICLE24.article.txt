| The Editor, Sir:
There has been an awful lot of
i fuss lately about whether Stanford
1 has "school spirit" or not. The read
ers of The Daily are too dumb to
j realize that they are playing into
jthe campus newspaper's hands by
: writing half the sheet. The Daily
! has to think up three or four edi
; torials five days a week, and it is
j apparently too much for them be
cause when they run out of ideas on
wlfct to pan or praise (seldom the
j latter), they dig up some age-old
question and get everyone all ex
j cited over nothing. Letters pour
i into the Dippy office, and the edi
torials are all the editor's efforts to
i back up his statements or back down
| on them as Mr. Lapham is politely
I doing now.
Define School Spirit
But the fact that The Daily is
| smart enough to make the readers
: put out half of each edition is beside
j the point which we shall assume to
be Stanford's lack of school spirit.
| Mr. Lapham evidently doesn't be
i lieve that an educational institu
' tion can have school spirit, but he
| thinks Stanford should be an edu
cational institution, and he deplores
the lack of school spirit. It's all
too confusing for me, but perhaps
if Mr. Lapham could define school
spirit that would help. Mr. Lapham
probably can't without reference to
Webster, which isn't much help.
Does anybody know what school
spirit actually is?
It all depends on how you look at
it. The fellows on the football field
think school spirit is getting the pig
skin between the goal posts. The
guys that make money off the foot
ball game Ihink school spirit is the

number of people yelling in the
stands. What is Mr. Lapham's def
inition of school spirit? Maybe if
we don't have it, it is something we
wouldn't want anyway.
All Yell Stanford
But if Mr. Lapham thinks the stu
dents of Stanford aren't 100% be
hind their University (whatever it
means to the individual), he is sadly
mistaken. There is plenty of proof,
and if you don't believe it, ask any
student on the campus which is the
best college in the country. They'll
all yell Stanford. What more do you
want, Mr. Lapham? Tell them you
don't think so, and you'll find your
self resting peaceably under the
pansies—or dandelions if the Stan
ford students have anything to say
about what will adorn the sod over
your somewhat empty cranium.
I don't agree with Stanford Man
of Two Generations. We should
have more junior transfer editors
like Mr. Lapham. It makes us more
appreciative of our school and the
sort of students it turns out.

| The Editor, Sir:
There has been an awful lot of
i fuss lately about whether Stanford
1 has "school spirit" or not. The read
ers of The Daily are too dumb to
j realize that they are playing into
jthe campus newspaper's hands by
: writing half the sheet. The Daily
! has to think up three or four edi
; torials five days a week, and it is
j apparently too much for them be
cause when they run out of ideas on
wlfct to pan or praise (seldom the
j latter), they dig up some age-old
question and get everyone all ex
j cited over nothing. Letters pour
i into the Dippy office, and the edi
torials are all the editor's efforts to
i back up his statements or back down
| on them as Mr. Lapham is politely
I doing now.
Define School Spirit
But the fact that The Daily is
| smart enough to make the readers
: put out half of each edition is beside
j the point which we shall assume to
be Stanford's lack of school spirit.
| Mr. Lapham evidently doesn't be
i lieve that an educational institu
' tion can have school spirit, but he
| thinks Stanford should be an edu
cational institution, and he deplores
the lack of school spirit. It's all
too confusing for me, but perhaps
if Mr. Lapham could define school
spirit that would help. Mr. Lapham
probably can't without reference to
Webster, which isn't much help.
Does anybody know what school
spirit actually is?
It all depends on how you look at
it. The fellows on the football field
think school spirit is getting the pig
skin between the goal posts. The
guys that make money off the foot
ball game Ihink school spirit is the

number of people yelling in the
stands. What is Mr. Lapham's def
inition of school spirit? Maybe if
we don't have it, it is something we
wouldn't want anyway.
All Yell Stanford
But if Mr. Lapham thinks the stu
dents of Stanford aren't 100% be
hind their University (whatever it
means to the individual), he is sadly
mistaken. There is plenty of proof,
and if you don't believe it, ask any
student on the campus which is the
best college in the country. They'll
all yell Stanford. What more do you
want, Mr. Lapham? Tell them you
don't think so, and you'll find your
self resting peaceably under the
pansies—or dandelions if the Stan
ford students have anything to say
about what will adorn the sod over
your somewhat empty cranium.
I don't agree with Stanford Man
of Two Generations. We should
have more junior transfer editors
like Mr. Lapham. It makes us more
appreciative of our school and the
sort of students it turns out.
