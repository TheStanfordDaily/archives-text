# THERE ARE HEELS AND HEELS
## 
### 
Dear Mr. DeGoff:
There are lots of varieties of
heels. Some are on shoes, some
need to be on shoes, some don't buy
tags on Tag Day, and some are like
you.
You are a bigger heel, I dare say,
than all other garden varieties be
cause you don't think people who
don't buy tags on Tag Day are heels.
If there is anybody at Stanford who
exists for a whole quarter on 10
cents, let me meet him. I should
like to know him, because I can't do
it on four hundred bucks.
Despite the fact that Stanford is,
in part, self-supporting, does not
mean people can't pay ten cents for
a tag, and usually it is people with
the least money who buy the most
tags. There isn't anyone at Stanford
who can't afford to spend a dime
for a good cause. They all spend
dimes in the Cellar for good causes
like stomachs; the Convalescent
Home has stomachs in it, too. Let
me meet anybody that has to be a
heel because he hasn't 10 cents.
The person who made the state
ment is a nice litle girl who could
n't intimidate anybody—much less
by calling them a heel. She figured
no one on the campus would want
to be a heel like you;"so she warned
them. It was very decent of her to
do so. I had to buy a tag to pre
vent me from being a heel like you.
It is too bad you expended the
large sum of ten cents not to be a
heel. It is wasted; you are a heel,
anyway—a nasty, nasty heel.

P.S.: Under sepai*ate cover I re
turn your filthy lucre (ten cents).
We found it was a slug, anyway.
