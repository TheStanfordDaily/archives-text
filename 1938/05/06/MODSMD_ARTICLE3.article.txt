# Farm Cindermen To Invade Troy
## Burrows, Zamperini To Tangle In Mile at U.S.C. Tomorrow 
### JERRY MAYER 
Way back 8.C.. a hardy band of Greeks endeavored to wipe out the
city of Troy and all its inhabitants. History books say that they did a
pretty fair iob of it—that the city was leveled to the ground and all of
its inhabitants destroyed.
But history is wrong. A small and intrepid band of Trojan survivors
settled down in Southern California and raised a mighty band of giants

to roam throughout the land andf
swell the mighty chorus of the
Cardinal—(you know).
Tonight a stealthy band of Indians
depart to put the finishing touches
on a job the Greeks didn't quite ac
complish a few centuries ago.
Not Expected To Win
Of course, no one expects the
Stanford track team to defeat South
ern California's Trojans tomorrow in
the Los Angeles Coliseum, but
there are several events scheduled
that should be thrillers.
For instance, there are the distance
runs, the mile and two-mile, in
which two of the premier college
leather-lungers of the country will
tangle. Louis Zamperini, Troy's (
great sophomore, has run the mile
in 4:13, and the two-mile in ap
proximately 9:19 already this year,
times which Stanford's EcLson Bur- i
rows hasn't come near, but the lanky
Cardinal red-head never runs for
better time than necessary to win.
Pole Vault To Be Interesting
Next to the distances, the pole
vault should hold most interest for
the spectators. S.C. has in Loring
Day, a worthy successor to Earl
Meadows and Bill Sefton, last year's
bamboo aviators. Day will attempt
to shadow the latter pair's world
mark of 14-11, made against Stan
ford last year.
The sprints tomorrow will be a
tangled-up affair. S.C. has Adrian
Talley and Payton Jordan, against
whom Dink Templeton will pit Stan
Hiserman in the century and Ray
Malott in the furlong. In both events,
any of the above men could win,
although Malott will be handicap- |
ped by having a quarter mile as
signment to handle before the
sprint.
Fast Track
Running on one of the fastest
tracks in America, Captain Malott
will have a real chance to take a j
bite out of Ben Eastman's world rec
ord of 46.4 in the one-lap race. Er
win Miller of S.C. will furnish Ma
lott with enough competition at least
to extent him.
An interesting sidelight on tomor
row's 440-yard race is the fact that
Malott and Miller both come from
ChafTey Junior College and Harold
Lang, their jaysee mentor, has as
serted that Miller is the better run
ner of the two. He has been ill
most of this season with a flu at
tack, but is now in good shape.
Grid Men Will Vie
Pete Zagar, Hugh Gribbin and Ted
Hucklebridge, Stanford's trio of dis
cus spinners, will have their hands
full with Phil Gaspar, who clashed j
with Zagar on the grid last year i
and now resumes hostilities with the
platter. Gaspar is consistent at 155'
feet and could win if the Cards have '
one of their bad days.
Bill Braheny staved off what I
loomed a sure Cal clean sweep in l
the javelin, but its doubtful if he or!
any other Stanford wand-wafter can I
prevent Troy's spearing all nine '>
points, with Chuck Soper, Reed :
Trusel, and Bob Ehrhorn snagging
the places in that order.
Indians making the trip are as
follows:
Hiserman, Carew, Sparling, Haw- \
kins, Simpson, Malott, Mahurin, 1
Williamson, Rockwell, Ferguson,!
March, Burrows, Montgomery, Gan
ahl, Lippman, Andersen, Zagar, i
Gribbin, Hucklebridge, Braheny,'
Stone, Wulff, Bernhauer, Boore,;
Gill, Brown, and Siefert.
