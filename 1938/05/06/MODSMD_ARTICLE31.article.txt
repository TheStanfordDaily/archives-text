# Chinese Forces Hold Japanese In Major Battle
## Strategic Rail Base Sought by Nipponese In Five-Day Clash 
### 
YUNHO, Shantung-Kiangsu Bor
der, May 5 (UP) —A battle of great
er proportions than that at Taierh
chwang, where last month the Chi
nese won their greatest victory
against the Japanese, has been rag
ing for the past five days around this
shell-scarred town east of Suchow-
Fu.
Casualties have reached the thou
sands and appear about equally di
vided between the Chinese and
Japanese.
The*forces involved are a Chinese
division commanded by Gen. Fan
Sung-Fu, a hard-fighting, hard
drinking commander who literally
drives his men into the fray, and a
Japanese unit headed by Col. Saka
hara. The Japanese are trying to
break through and clear the Grand I
Canal so that they can follow it
southeast to the point where it
crosses the fortified Lung-Hai Rail
way and carry out their plan to en
circle Chinese general headquarters !
in Suchow-Fu.
Outcome Uncertain
The outcome of the battle was un
certain as this dispatch was filed.
The correspondent reached this
city early this week after a hazard- j
ous journey form Taierhchwang, j
which still was in Chinese hands, j
to witness some of the bloodiest
fighting he has seen in covering the
war on a dozen fronts.
There can be no question of the i
morale of the Chinese forces, which
exhibit the utmost heroism.
Chinese Attack
Last night, for example, the cor
respondent saw Chinese detach
ments rush from ruined houses in
the village of Peilao and attack ,
Japanese detachments barricaded in j
houses. The Chinese threw fire- i
brands on the Japanese positions !
and finally, near dawn, the Japanese
retreated.
There was one awful exhibition of
courage. Patrols of Chinese, carrying
big torches made of kaoliang (kind
■of kaffir corn) stalks, swarmed
| around one house in which a Japa
! nese group was barricade dand triedi
to set fire to it. Eventually it burst*
into flames and a Japanese battery
some distance away attempted to
cover the retreat of their fleeing
I country men with a barrage of phos
phorous shells.
