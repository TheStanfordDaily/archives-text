r ff , HE Board of Athletic Control
meeting was postponed from last
week to this week because Art
Stoefen, student member, was off
campus and couldn't attend.
It, was postponed again this week
until May 11 because Prof. W. B.
Owen, faculty conference repre
sentative, is ill and was unable to
attend.
I he fact that the meeting is be
ing postponed until the entire
membership is able to he present
presages something of importance.
Although it is getting to be com
mon gossip that the hoard will
>elect the new basketball coach
when they finally get the whole
group together, it still is officially
none of anybody's business what
the board will consider when it
meets.
However, it is reported that there
ire about 50 applications in (he
nands of the 13.A.C. now for (be job
of basketball coach next winter, and
;omcthing is going to be done fair
ly soon, it is reasonably certain.
As far as is known, there have
been no applications received from
Coach Bill Hubbard of San .lose
State and Coach Everett Dean of
Indiana, who are allegedly the most
lik<-ly prospects. Of course, an ap
plication is not necessary in any
sense. If the B.A.C. thinks it wants
a man it won't hesitate to ask him
and state its price, whether the man
has .slated his desire to come to
Stanford or no.
There have been applications
received from quite a few high
school coaches as well as college
coaches, reports would have it.
Nothing has been said about any
application by Benny Neff, I.owcll
High School mentor, who was
loudly mentioned in some quar
ters as a possible successor to
liunn three instants after the an
nouncement was made.
Coaches have applied from all
i.ver the country, it is said, includ
lg Oregon, Kansas, the East Coast,
; .id the South. Here's one name
. Kit has distinct possibilities Slats
Gill, of Oregon State.

' PI IE senior basketball team may
not know it yet, but it is liable
! :> have its hands full trying to beat
;c.e coming varsity whep they tangle
r the benefit of the Convalescent
1 ome.
Old W'ytzc Gortcr, erstwhile
rosh hoop coach, has concocted
couple of new little plays to con
use the old-timersw ith, John
Sunn says, and they might he able
o swing something fancy against
he has-beens before the game is
>vcr.
The varsity has been working
i lough so that it is in fair shape,
i..j a whole. The seniors won't be
; i bad, with Luisetti having been
■> orking quite a bit, Stoefen in
: lape from a hard tennis season,
; nd Calderwood getting in lots of
i jks on the golf course. Lee and
. sath, other senior headliners, are
i ill not heard from.—Peterson.
