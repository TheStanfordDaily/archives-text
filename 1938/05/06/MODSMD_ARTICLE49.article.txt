In the events that both Wallace
and Doering come through Stanford

these two Indians fighting it out in
a semi-final engagement in the
afternoon.
Carli and Palacio were made
slight tournament favorites when
they turned in low qualifying scores
for co-medalist honors.
Tournament finals will be staged
Sunday with 18 holes both in the
morning and afternoon. The semi
finals will be 18-hole assignments.
Stanford's Don Edwards, winner
of the tournament last year, was
eliminated last Sunday by Drier on
the last hole of their first-round
match when Drier came within
inches of shocking a hole-in-one.
