# Ledeboer Tops Grid Passers In Scrimmage
## Coldiron, Thompson Show Defense Skill; Dark Horse Appears 
### 
Freddie Ledeboer has just about
established himself as the deadliest
passer on the spring grid squad.
No one ever has denied Ledeboer's
proficiency but last night's scrim
mage erased all doubts about him.
Freddie was teamed up in a second
string backfield with Gene Coldiron,
quarter, Bob Olden, right half, and
Benny McGuire, right half, against
a mixture of third and fourth team
men.
Mis. es Once
The mock game lasted over an
hour, yet Ledeboer only missed his
target once when he led Andy Stoj
kovich too far. In the interim, he
lofted a short one down the middle
to Stoke for a touchdown and then
hit McGuire from 30 yards out for
another. A third, to Bill Willard
over the goal line, was a beautifully
timed effort which Willard lost in
the sun. The rest of the hour was
similarly a one-man show with
Ledeboer making yardage off the
tackles in between his spotting
work.
Coldiron and Jake Thompson at
center were backing up the second
string line well enough to limit their
opposition to feeble gains of two and
three yards all afternoon. For all
his 1()4 pounds, Thompson seems to
hit as hard and as often as any man
on the field.
Brenner Returns Punt
A dark horse named Johnny
Brenner, an Annapolis transfer
rambled off a 35-yard punt return
to establish himself as a prospective
broken field runner. Moon Mullins,
backbone of the Greys' squad last
fall, likewise showed possibilities as
a passer, but lacked the blocking
that Ledeboer had.
Among the linemen, two second
team guards of Roy Adamson and
Paul Ugrin, showed up well while
Frosh Ed Johannesson and Claude
Purkitt kept the tackle holes pretty
well filled most of the time.
â€¢Biil Paulman, game leg and all,
stayed around after practice long
enough to boot several 65 to 70-yard
place-kicks and a few punts that
spiralled almost as far.
