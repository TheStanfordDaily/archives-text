# All-U Handball Match Revived
## 
### 
One of Stanford's oldest tourna
ments will come back to life next
week when the all-University hand
ball doubles competition begins.
The two-man play has been an in-
spring activity for nearly 14
years, according to Myron Sprague.
Places on the elimination chart are
open to all registered students and
faculty members.
Signups will be accepted on the
Encina Gym bulletin board until
Monday night and the first match
must be played before the end of
next week, Sprague asserted last
night.
A new set of champions is as
sured inasmuch as John Silliman
and Sprague himself, the winners
last spring, will not be among those
I present.
