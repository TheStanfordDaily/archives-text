# Stagehand May Not Enter Kentucky Race
## Brokers Cut Odds On Fighting Fox; Sande Places Bet on Chief

LOUISVILLE, Ky„ May 5 (UP). |
—There is only one chance in a mil
lion that Stagehand, favorite in the
Kentucky D<»rby winter books, will I
be in there when the bugle blows
on Saturday. To all practical pur
poses, the conqueror of Seabiscuit
is out of it.
That's what Maxwell Howard,
owner of Stagehand, said tonight
after an anxious day of conferences
over the condition of the horse that
is running a fever in a stable at
Churchill Downs.
The one thin chance that Stage
hand will be in there is that he will
made a miraculous recovery. No
one believes he will, and Howard
was reconciled to putting all his
chances on Stagehand's stablemate,
The Chief.
The answer must be "yes" or
"no" by 10:30 a.m. tomorrow when
the official entries drop in the box
in the little white office of the racing
secretary.
If Stagehand is going, his name
must be in that box, although Sande
could enter him and then scratch
him. The present plan is to watch
and wait through the night and see
whether the fever stays down and,
unless there is a definite turn for the
better or worse, make the decision
after sunrise.
If Stagehand can't go, Sande will
have everything riding on the back
of The Chief, which won the Derby >
trial race here Tuesday in a heart- '
stopping finish with Lawrin.
