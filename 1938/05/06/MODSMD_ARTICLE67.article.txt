# Hope Short-Circuited

### 
BRIGHT hopes lightened the dusty corners
of Farm telephone booths when it was an
nounced that the head of 3121 exchange was
conferring with the local manager. The hopes
went out as though they had blown a fuse
when the Lords of the Switchboard reported
that they had not discussed improving service.
Instead they pondered the evils of dialing
too fast. For it seems that Hall men have been
forcing the dial back after each number, thus
giving the mechanical operator hysterics.
Warning signs have been posted. No more
trouble is anticipated, and the Lords are happy.
The students are not.
And the students have a lot on their side.
When the chronic complaining about the pres
ent telephone system flared into bitter re
proach last winter, authorities promised to in
vestigate chances of improvement. Since then
there has been no improvement. We have it on
reliable authority that the only way to get in
touch with a Hall man is to swear out a war
rant and call in the G-men.
Every day brings in a new story of broken
hearts and shattered dreams arising from
wrong numbers and broken connections along
the Toyon-Roble axis.
And with this last blow the Hall men feel
the iron entering their hearts. Forcing the dials
back was the one element of speed in the
whole system. It was the only outlet left to
frustrated victims of the machine.
The last safety valve has been removed. The
investigation of chances of improvement is the
white hope of weary Hall men. And to judge
from its speed, that investigation is being con
ducted over the 3121 exchange.â€”J. C.
