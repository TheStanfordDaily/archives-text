# How To Win Friends...

JUDGING by the letter Mr. Lange wrote to
plug "Johnny Johnson," he is under the im
pression that there is a feud on between the
campus and the Division. He probably has
picked up this idea from the criticisms of pro
ductions which have come in, off and on.
However, it can be fairly safely assumed that
any attacks have come as the campus' rights
as a critic, and not out of some ancient grudge
against the Division itself.
But no matter what prompted Mr. Lange's let
ter, it looks as if he were going about patching
up the rift he seems to see in exactly the wrong
way. We were doing all right before he wrote
his little come-on letter. After "Kind Lady,"
we were set to enjoy what should be a good
show.
But now Mr. Lange has called out the worst
in us. He has practically dared us to find any
thing wrong with his play by promising that
all he needs to make the production a success
is an audience. After outlining the claims to
fame of the author and composer, describing
expensive scenery and costuming, he seems to
assume that, whether they are combined into
a good show or not, the audience is at fault if
the play does not suit campus tastes.
His tactics may draw the crowd he wants.
But he might do well to consult his handbooks
of good taste and advertising psychology be
fore he writes another letter.â€”J. S.
