IN the last few days Convalescent Home
Drive machinery has been turning over at
top speed, shuttling across Palo Alto like a
vacuum cleaner. And in its wake have risen
objections and complaints.
The burden of the grouching is that the cam
paign is too intensive, that it asks too much.
The objectors point sourly to the intensive
house-to-house solicitation, and the tactlessly
enthusiastic statement of a chairman that any
body who doesn't buy a tag is a heel.
In some respects the objections are valid. In
the past week enthusiasm has certainly over

shadowed consideration. But despite that, gen
eral complaints are unjustified.
The Home Drive is Stanford's pet project. We
have taken it on voluntarily, and we get a great
deal of righteous pride out of our benevolence.
Once we have assumed the obligation, it is
only fair to go through with it.
It is a bit unpleasant in spots. Nobody ever
enjoyed handing out money. But if we are to
take credit for the job, we will have to do it.
The house-to-house solicitation is the most
annoying part of the Drive. But contributions
from individuals and from living groups make
up the bulk of the fund. The rest of the Drive
consists of parties which are intended more to
work up spirit than to make money. The real
drive is the house-to-house work.
It isn't nearly as much fun to write checks as
it is to paddle canoes or dodge balloons. But
we contracted for that when we took on the
Drive. By definition you can't be a philanthro
pist without giving something.—J. C.
