# Living Groups Aid Home Drive
## Chairmen Predict Reaching of Quota 
### 
Predicting that their $6144 quota
will be reached, Convalescent Home
Drive heads yesterday released
individual contributions to date
from various living groups.
"The mercury may look pretty
low right now," said General Chair
man Bud Milligan, "but the basket
ball game next Thursday and the
Soph Carnival are two big items not
yet taken into account."
Exact profits of the carnival,
which netted over $800 last year,
should be known within a day or
two, he said.
Money Comes In
Treasurer Roy Thompson, com
paring present contributions with
last year's drive, said yesterday that
money is coming in normally.
"If we keep on the way we're go
ing now," he said, "we'll go over the
top."
Working every night from 7 to 9
o'clock, forty couples on the Off-
Campus Drive have taken in $798.10
to date. Every night after they have
finished soliciting, they jolly-up in
the Nitery.
Labor Day concessions netted
$51.22, it was announced yesterday
by Thompson.
George Concannon, who has placed
contribution boxes around the cam
pus, complained yesterday he had
found only $3.50 in making the
rounds. Over $20 was taken in this
way last year, he pointed out.
Boxes have been placed in the Li
brary, Book Store, Union, Post Of
fice, and Men's Rest Home.
