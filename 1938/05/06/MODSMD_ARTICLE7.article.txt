low right now," said General Chair

ball game next Thursday and the
Soph Carnival are two big items not
yet taken into account."
Exact profits of the carnival,
which netted over $800 last year,
should be known within a day or
two, he said.
Money Comes In

paring present contributions with

ing now," he said, "we'll go over the
top."
