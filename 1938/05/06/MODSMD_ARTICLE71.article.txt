probably the best campus entertainment program
takes place once a year at the Labor Day barbecue.
Al least the two. years I've seen it makes me think so.
It's probably because the program is distilled, with
only tlie best that Stanford has to offer doing their
stuff. And Stanford has some good ones by any stand
a ids.
Arranged by campus A-l funny-man Hoke Roberts,
the program brought out two things which weren't
established before to Stanford at large. The first is
that Pete Fay has the best male singing voice we've
heard about these parts, and that Yvonne Hazlett is
Riving Shirley Jones a run for her money. And no
one is prouder than Shirley, I hear. Seems that when
she was singing a summer or so back with Freddie
Nagel at Russian River, Yvonne popped up out of a
melee of hill-billy singers on a weekly amateur night.
So she is something of a discovery of Shirley's, if not
a protegee.
Anyhow, she has a throaty quality about her voice
which makes it unusually distinctive. Combined with
a good range, and a natural sense of rhythm, she
should go a long way, at least at Stanford.

then Bob Mallet came back. Which is all that
need be said. You'll be hearing people talk for a
long time about his imitations of Dickie Powell, Nelson
Eddie, and. best of all. our friend, F.D.R.
But about the best of them all is Hoke, who does
nothing at all but fiddle around with accordion and
smoke a pipe. It may not be a compliment, but his
dead-pan is the deadest in the business, and the fun
niest.
Ail these bouquets makes me look like I'm figur
ing on trying out for the lead in the Gaieties next year.
But I don't thing think they'll have any trouble get
ting some of the lu st talent there is around here.
Yvonne Hazlett will fie here to carry on after Shirley
Jones. And there's Fay and Owen Clarke who can
sing, even if he can't act. Which makes the prospects
pretty fair for next year, in spite of the fact that most

probably the best campus entertainment program
probably the best campus entertainment program
takes place once a year at the Labor Day barbecue.
Al least the two. years I've seen it makes me think so.
It's probably because the program is distilled, with
only tlie best that Stanford has to offer doing their
stuff. And Stanford has some good ones by any stand
a ids.
Arranged by campus A-l funny-man Hoke Roberts,
the program brought out two things which weren't
established before to Stanford at large. The first is
that Pete Fay has the best male singing voice we've
heard about these parts, and that Yvonne Hazlett is
Riving Shirley Jones a run for her money. And no
one is prouder than Shirley, I hear. Seems that when
she was singing a summer or so back with Freddie
Nagel at Russian River, Yvonne popped up out of a
melee of hill-billy singers on a weekly amateur night.
So she is something of a discovery of Shirley's, if not
a protegee.
Anyhow, she has a throaty quality about her voice
which makes it unusually distinctive. Combined with
a good range, and a natural sense of rhythm, she
should go a long way, at least at Stanford.

then Bob Mallet came back. Which is all that
need be said. You'll be hearing people talk for a
long time about his imitations of Dickie Powell, Nelson
Eddie, and. best of all. our friend, F.D.R.
But about the best of them all is Hoke, who does
nothing at all but fiddle around with accordion and
smoke a pipe. It may not be a compliment, but his
dead-pan is the deadest in the business, and the fun
niest.
Ail these bouquets makes me look like I'm figur
ing on trying out for the lead in the Gaieties next year.
