# Deval's New French Movie Called 'Great'
## 
### 
"Club des Fortunes." currently
playing at the Clay International
Theater, S. F.:

At the risk of
conjuring up vis
ions of De Mille's
bathtubs, the the
atergoer has
nonetheless no
' alternative but
to tag this film
"great." But in
stead of straining
towards the mil
lenium or strad-

dling an era in one Belascan swoop,
"Club des Femmes" delves profound
ly into human motives. And with
consummate acting, directing, and
writing, the picture beats the thicket
after a covey of relationships which
have not been touched since the
Hays Office hung out the "No Tres
passing" sign.
Set in a glorified Y.W.C.A. dedi
cated to sheltering the working girls
of Paris from the perils of the city,
"Club de Femmes" propounds the
theme that life beats down the gates
of even a citadel. Danielle Dar
rieux, a flip little dancer, disguises
her lover in girl's clothes and slips
him past the directress.
Elsa Argal, as a grave young medi
cal student, is drawn into a tragic
devotion for a little secretary. Junie
Astor, treacherous switchboard op
erator, snares the girls into liaisons
with city slickers. And with dra
matic persuasion and a Gallic re
finement of detail, the psychology of
these women and their sisters is ex
posed in the intimate atmosphere of
a women's residence.
Known to American audiences for
his "Tovarich," Jacques Devals,
writer and director of "Club des
Femmes" hurdles the two-dimen
sional limitations of the screen to
establish that communion between
player and audience which is usual
ly the mainstay of the stage. Dan
ielle Darrieux, in this picture a
superlative version of Ginger Rog
ers, is nonetheless eclipsed by Miss
Argal with her exquisite perform
ance in a more demanding role.
