All good children should go to the

It is easy to go to the Masque
Ball. Good children will give $2.56
to the man at the door and they can
walk right in. They can pay at the
door because so many people forgot
jto pay ahead of time. Isn't this a
; nice plan? They will have fun. And
I the kiddies at the Convalescent
; Home will be happy, because that
i money is for them.
Little Musicians
Donald Mulford and several of his
little friends will attend. They have
been taking music lessons. They
will give a recital.
Donald and his friends will wear
I their new baby clothes. Donald will
be very entertaining. One of his
pals, Henry Lightfoot, is going to
sing.

,He is a guest. He will sing a lulla
by. It is,, called "Yes." It was writ
ten by Bobbie Forbes and Dickie
I Kraemer. It is even played over
the radio by Carl Ravazza.
The Pavilion will be very pretty.
| There will be beautiful drapes and
. lots of colored lights and lots of
j balloons and lots of statues and

! There is a dance tonight. It is a
i big dance. It is the Masque Ball.
I It is in the Pavilion.
All good children should go to the
dance. They should wear nice
clothes, like all children wear. That
i is because it is a Kid Party.
It is easy to go to the Masque
Ball. Good children will give $2.56
to the man at the door and they can
walk right in. They can pay at the
door because so many people forgot
jto pay ahead of time. Isn't this a
; nice plan? They will have fun. And
I the kiddies at the Convalescent
; Home will be happy, because that
i money is for them.
Little Musicians
Donald Mulford and several of his
little friends will attend. They have
been taking music lessons. They
will give a recital.
Donald and his friends will wear
I their new baby clothes. Donald will
be very entertaining. One of his
pals, Henry Lightfoot, is going to
sing.
Fay To Hum
Peter Fay is also going to sing.
,He is a guest. He will sing a lulla
by. It is,, called "Yes." It was writ
ten by Bobbie Forbes and Dickie
I Kraemer. It is even played over
the radio by Carl Ravazza.
The Pavilion will be very pretty.
| There will be beautiful drapes and
. lots of colored lights and lots of
j balloons and lots of statues and
maybe even a grekt big slide.
A shiny thing which is awful big
will make the orchestra stand out
i real pretty. It is in back of the or
-1 chestra.
