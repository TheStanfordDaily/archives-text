### BILL MILLIS 
"JERSEY JUSTICE," as adminis
tered by Mayor Frank Hague of
Jersey City, gives rise to the ques
tion of how, in the present world,
to distinguish arbitrary denials of
civil rights from fascism.
One thing can be said, and that is
that the causes of infringements of
civil liberties in democratic nations
lie in social crises and social con
flicts which under certain condi
tions result in the establishment of
totalitarian rule.
Those who find it convenient to
identify all limitations of free
speech—as when Mayor Hague's
police repeatedly eject AFL and
CIO organizers, or prevent Social
ist leader Norman Thomas from
speaking—with fascism, act much
as did the legendary hoy who cried '
"wolf" until none would believe
him when the real danger came.
By confusing the popular mind,
they serve to increase the tasks
of those hard-pressed few who be
lieve that "eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty."
Last Saturday night 50,000 Hague
supporters, including Catholic war
veterans reputedly armed with five
foot. lengths of rubber hose, gathered
in downtown Journal Square, pre
pared "to receive" Congressmen Jer
ry O'Connell (D., Mont.) and John
T. Bernard (F-L., Minn.), who were
determined to pi-otest the city's poli
cies.
At the last moment, the Congress
men, apparently deciding that "he
who fights and runs away lives to
fight another day," abandoned their
plans to speak because of fear that
bloodshed might ensue.
Yesterday, after returning to
Washington, O'Connell asked
President Roosevelt to remove
Hague as vice-chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
and urged the Senate Civil Lib
erties Committee to investigate
Hague's activities. Sen. Robert M.
La Follette, head of the commit
tee, said that he would give
O'Connell's request "serious con
sideration."

of the opposition of
China, the Soviet Union, and of
Latin American nations, Great Brit
ain has been forced to abandon its
plan to seek from the League of Na
tions council today a resolution ap
proving general recognition of
recognition of Italy's conquest of
Ethiopia.
The world's leading "missing
man," Haile Selassie, deposed Negus
of Ethiopia, sent representatives
headed by economist Sir Norman
Angel 1 to Geneva to defeat the plans
of Viscount Halifax, British foreign
secretary.
Since the necessary unanimous
council vote absolving League
states from their 1936 pledge not
to recognize II Duce's Ethiopian
venture cannot be obtained, Eng
land, it was reported, will be satis
fied with a statement by the coun
cil "summarizing the viewpoints
of those nations favoring recog
nition."
Once this is obtained, the Cham
berlain government, it was predict
ed, will go ahead anyway with its
recognition plans, which were
pledged in the recently concluded
Anglo-Italian "treaty of friendship."

For once Chinese and Japanese
military dispatches were in agree

that the long-awaited Nipponese
"big push" on the vital Lunghai
railroad line was underway.
Japanese flying columns cap
tured a dozen towns on a semi
circular front around Suchow-fu,
at the junction of the cast-west
Lunghai and the north-south
Tientsin-Nanking railroads. At
the same time, new Japanese
naval movements were reported
off South China.

enactment of the wage-hour bill,

Last Saturday night 50,000 Hague
supporters, including Catholic war
veterans reputedly armed with five
foot. lengths of rubber hose, gathered
in downtown Journal Square, pre
pared "to receive" Congressmen Jer

T. Bernard (F-L., Minn.), who were
determined to pi-otest the city's poli
cies.
At the last moment, the Congress
men, apparently deciding that "he
who fights and runs away lives to
fight another day," abandoned their
plans to speak because of fear that
bloodshed might ensue.
Yesterday, after returning to
Washington, O'Connell asked
President Roosevelt to remove
Hague as vice-chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
and urged the Senate Civil Lib

Hague's activities. Sen. Robert M.

Ethiopia.
The world's leading "missing
man," Haile Selassie, deposed Negus
of Ethiopia, sent representatives
headed by economist Sir Norman

of Viscount Halifax, British foreign

to recognize II Duce's Ethiopian
venture cannot be obtained, Eng

Once this is obtained, the Cham
