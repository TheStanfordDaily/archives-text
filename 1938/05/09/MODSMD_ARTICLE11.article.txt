Seek Big Profit
Meanwhile, Milligan and other
1 drive heads were placing most of
l their hopes for an over-the-top drive
i on heavy profits from the basketball
I game.
With individual and living group
j contributions lagging behind last
year's records, with Masque Ball
profits estimated at slightly over $15,
and with only a meager amount re
ported as the Drive's one-fourth of
i the profits from "Johnny Johnson,'
I the basketball game assumed even
! greater importance in making the
| drive a success. ,

eaters at the Junior Water Carnival
put another $16.13 into the drive

ning for themselves the 11-inch sil
ver perpetual trophy they had do
nated a few days before.
Kappa and D.U. made eight points
