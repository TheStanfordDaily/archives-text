"That is Cathcart, and there I
am," remarked President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, pointing to a picture of the
Euphronia Literary Society mem
bers in the '96 Quad. "It has been a
lonsj time since I looked at it."
Recalling undergraduate days with
Professor Arthur. M. Cathcart, who
will retire at the end of the spring
quarter, Dr. Wilbur continued, "He
was an intercollegiate debater, a
successful student, and vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U.
"From his first days as a freshman
until he becomes an emeritus pro
fessor, he has always run true. That
is the kind of people who should
make up a university, and the kind
of people who should make up the
world." ,
Professor Cathcart was approached
by Dr. Jordan in 1904, while prac-
I ticing law in Colorado Springs, with
an offer to teach and accepted.
As a teacher of teachers, Profes
sor Cathcart has Stanford Professors
; William Ow«nis. Harry Rathbun,
James Brenner, and Dean Marion
Kirk wood to attest to hi? success.

! "Professor Cathcart is retiring after
34 years of teaching at Stanford, dur
ing which time a host of students
has come under his influence. Few
men enjoy the respect and affection
of their former students to the de
gree that he does," says Dean Kirk
wood.
Continued Dean Kirkwood:
"He is remembered by them
throughout the years for his clarity
of thought, his skill as a teacher, and,
above all. his great friendliness. For
30 years I have been associated with
him, first as one of his students and
later as his colleague. I join with
Stanford lawyers generally, and re
gret that he is giving up active work
[ of teaching."
Professor Cathcart's chief interest
J outside of teaching is in public serv
ice. He was, for 18 years, a member
of the City Council of Palo Alto and
is now chairman of the Board of
Public Safety.
He was mayor of Palo Alto and
was active in the pioneer work of
the city in zoning and set-back line
methods—which methods have made
; Palo Alto an unusually attractive

city.
What makes a successful lawyer?
Answered Professor Cathcart:
"There is no numerical evaluation
for success. Opportunity and cir
cumstances are deterministic fac
tors.
"There is a constant correlation
between work in the Law School
and later success. But it is the
capacity for hard work and a good
character which make for the suc
cessful lawyer."
Is it possible to be honest, and be
in politics?
"It is possible to be in politics, to
succeed in politics—and be honest.
Although there is a tendency toward
dishonesty, political corruption is, I
think, greatly exaggerated.
"It pleases me to see law students
up for election, well-trained, able,
and with the ability to look forward.
"One might also be a success po
litically without being elected,"
i added Professor Cathcart. "The civil
service offers an opportunity for get
ting a start, but there is no assur
ance, at present, of promotion on a
Hnr;is of merit."

"It pleases me to see law students
up for election, well-trained, able,
and with the ability to look forward.
"One might also be a success po
litically without being elected,"
i added Professor Cathcart. "The civil
service offers an opportunity for get
ting a start, but there is no assur
ance, at present, of promotion on a
Hnr;is of merit."
"That is Cathcart, and there I
am," remarked President Ray Lyman
Wilbur, pointing to a picture of the
Euphronia Literary Society mem
bers in the '96 Quad. "It has been a
lonsj time since I looked at it."
Recalling undergraduate days with
Professor Arthur. M. Cathcart, who
will retire at the end of the spring
quarter, Dr. Wilbur continued, "He
was an intercollegiate debater, a
successful student, and vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U.
"From his first days as a freshman
until he becomes an emeritus pro
fessor, he has always run true. That
is the kind of people who should
make up a university, and the kind
of people who should make up the
world." ,
Professor Cathcart was approached
by Dr. Jordan in 1904, while prac-
I ticing law in Colorado Springs, with
an offer to teach and accepted.
As a teacher of teachers, Profes
sor Cathcart has Stanford Professors
; William Ow«nis. Harry Rathbun,
James Brenner, and Dean Marion
Kirk wood to attest to hi? success.

! "Professor Cathcart is retiring after
34 years of teaching at Stanford, dur
ing which time a host of students
has come under his influence. Few
men enjoy the respect and affection
of their former students to the de
gree that he does," says Dean Kirk
wood.
Continued Dean Kirkwood:
"He is remembered by them
throughout the years for his clarity
of thought, his skill as a teacher, and,
above all. his great friendliness. For
30 years I have been associated with
him, first as one of his students and
later as his colleague. I join with
Stanford lawyers generally, and re
gret that he is giving up active work
[ of teaching."
Professor Cathcart's chief interest
J outside of teaching is in public serv
ice. He was, for 18 years, a member
of the City Council of Palo Alto and
is now chairman of the Board of
Public Safety.
He was mayor of Palo Alto and
was active in the pioneer work of
the city in zoning and set-back line
methods—which methods have made
; Palo Alto an unusually attractive

city.
What makes a successful lawyer?
Answered Professor Cathcart:
"There is no numerical evaluation
for success. Opportunity and cir
cumstances are deterministic fac
tors.
"There is a constant correlation
between work in the Law School
and later success. But it is the
capacity for hard work and a good
character which make for the suc
cessful lawyer."
Is it possible to be honest, and be
in politics?
"It is possible to be in politics, to
succeed in politics—and be honest.
Although there is a tendency toward
dishonesty, political corruption is, I
think, greatly exaggerated.
"It pleases me to see law students
up for election, well-trained, able,
and with the ability to look forward.
