Stanford students have been ab
solved by residents of "picturesque"
Carmel of responsibility for what Po
lice Commissioner Frederick Bech
dolt, in an official report, called
"widespread lewd, intoxicating, and
disgraceful occurrences on Ocean
Avenue," the town's main street,
during recent week-ends.
Instead, it was learned that Car
melites are dii'ecting baleful glares
toward University of California and
Mills College students, who are j
blamed by W. K. Bassett, editor of :
the weekly Carmel Cymbal, for'
"depredations which seem almost
unspeakable."
Stagers Win Okay
When a double-decked bus load of
members of Stagers, dramatic so
ciety, arrived in Carmel a week ago,
they were welcomed at the city lim
its by Police Chief Robert Norton,
who reportedly said that "Carmel
doesn't mind Stanford students at
all," and even guided them to the
best beach picnic spot. Later, Stag
ers' president, Paul Crary wrote him
a letter of thanks which was pub
lished last Friday in the Pine Cone,
another weekly newspaper.
However, sterner receptions are
planned in the future, for any over
exuberant student, by the newly
elected city council, which was ired
by having to pay for the hauling of
three truck loads of empty beer cans
off the beach after a recent Sunday.
(Besides Bechdolt, who writes for
the Saturday Evening Post, new
members of the council are poet
Herbert Herron and Gordon Camp
bell, one-time Stanford football Ail-
American.)
Discard Jail Idea
At first Bechdolt recommended
that Carmel forget a 40-year-old tra
dition and build a city jail. That
idea was discarded in favor of a
plan to employ two additional police
ijust to take care of students and
j other vacationers. Also, tap-room
! operators are going to be required
1 to observe age restrictions set up by
the State Board of Equalization.
So far Carmel's uproar over "the
invasion of college students" may be
just another tempest-in-a-teapot, for
it has yet to make the front pages
of San Francisco newspapers. But it
may be something more serious, for
deans of women from Northern Cali
fornia universities and junior col
leges, who were meeting last week
at nearby Asilomar, sent a delega
tion over to find out what it was all
about.

Avenue," the town's main street,
during recent week-ends.
Instead, it was learned that Car
melites are dii'ecting baleful glares
toward University of California and
Mills College students, who are j
blamed by W. K. Bassett, editor of :
the weekly Carmel Cymbal, for'
"depredations which seem almost
unspeakable."
Stagers Win Okay
When a double-decked bus load of
members of Stagers, dramatic so
ciety, arrived in Carmel a week ago,
they were welcomed at the city lim
its by Police Chief Robert Norton,
who reportedly said that "Carmel
doesn't mind Stanford students at
all," and even guided them to the
best beach picnic spot. Later, Stag
ers' president, Paul Crary wrote him
a letter of thanks which was pub
lished last Friday in the Pine Cone,
another weekly newspaper.
However, sterner receptions are
planned in the future, for any over
exuberant student, by the newly
elected city council, which was ired
by having to pay for the hauling of
three truck loads of empty beer cans
off the beach after a recent Sunday.
(Besides Bechdolt, who writes for
the Saturday Evening Post, new
members of the council are poet
Herbert Herron and Gordon Camp
bell, one-time Stanford football Ail-
American.)
Discard Jail Idea
At first Bechdolt recommended
that Carmel forget a 40-year-old tra
dition and build a city jail. That
idea was discarded in favor of a
plan to employ two additional police
ijust to take care of students and
j other vacationers. Also, tap-room
! operators are going to be required
1 to observe age restrictions set up by
the State Board of Equalization.
So far Carmel's uproar over "the
invasion of college students" may be
just another tempest-in-a-teapot, for
it has yet to make the front pages
of San Francisco newspapers. But it
may be something more serious, for
deans of women from Northern Cali
fornia universities and junior col
leges, who were meeting last week
at nearby Asilomar, sent a delega
tion over to find out what it was all
about.
Stanford students have been ab
solved by residents of "picturesque"
Carmel of responsibility for what Po
lice Commissioner Frederick Bech
dolt, in an official report, called
"widespread lewd, intoxicating, and
disgraceful occurrences on Ocean
Avenue," the town's main street,
during recent week-ends.
