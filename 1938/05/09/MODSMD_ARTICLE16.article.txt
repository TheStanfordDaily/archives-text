# Atlantic City Bids For Film Industry

### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.. May 8
(UP). â€”This gay resort city, which
regards itself as the capital of the
American bathing beauty industry,
tonight joined the list of cities trying
to lure California's lucrative motion
picture colony away from Holly
wood.
Mayor Charles D. White and
Frank Gravatt, president of the
Steel Pier, the immense semi-carni
val waterfront project here, wired
joint invitations to major motion pic
ture companies, offering them free
land and "co-operation" if they
would pack up and move to New
Jersey.
