# Gordy Plays Rescue Role; Books Mystic
## 
### 
Stanford nearly had a new teacher
yesterday, an expert on biology,
mysticism, astrology, and social psy
chology; but Officer Gordy Davis,
after interviewing him on the second I
floor of the Union, decided that he j
had come to the wrong institution '
and booked him at the Palo Alto jail
for investigation.
Early yesterday afternoon, Joseph
Raminerez, self-styled actor, imper
sonator, and professor of astrology,
burst into the office of Clay McDan
iel, dramatic manager, and after
running his hands through McDan
iel's hair, flopped on a couch, and
announced that he wished to try out |
for the Spring Show.

Soon he was offering to interpret
his conception of dramatic art as in
spired by the planets. As he flut
tered his red bandana he explained:
"I am in a dream so I cannot act; I
but I understand all—and you would
understand all too if you understood
the planets!"
At this moment Park Kimball en
tered and Raminerez dropped on the
couch in abject despair, murmuring:
"Now the lovely spell is broken."
Raminerez could not be certain if
yesterday were tomorrow 01* the day
before, but, as he was a spirit and
only there in a dream, it did not
make much difference. Furthermore,
he had decided to devote himself to
saving the souls of Kimball and Mc-
Daniel instead of trying out for the
show.
Situation Is Tense
The situation became tense when
he announced his intention of tak
ing over the dramatic office after
McDaniel asked:
"But where will you stay 011 cam
pus if you live here?"
"Here in the dramatic office!" an
swered Joseph unconcernedly.
"But you can't do that."
"How could you be so cruel to me
when I am dying every minute? I
don't want to live if it will be mid
afternoon for me for eternity."
1 Davis arrived then and took over.
