# Dodds Will Speak On KGO Tonight
## 
### 
"Those Quaint Victorians" is the
title of this week's Stanford Univer
sity Radio Hour program to be given
over KGO tonight by Dr. John W.
Dodds. associate professor of Eng
lish. The talk is to be presented at
8:30 o'clock this week, the regular
Stanford Hour at 9:15 o'clock giving
way to a special transcontinental
program.
Dr. Dodds says, "Gradually, we
are seeing the age of our grand
fathers in true perspective and are
beginning to realize that something
of the same social problems which
we face today also confronted the
Victorians. Even we, in all our
twentieth century wisdom, have
been unable to solve these prob
lems."
"It is interesting, therefore, to sec
how provocative are some of the
things which the great literary
minds of the ageâ€”Thomas Carlyle
and Matthew Arnold, for instance
have for us."
