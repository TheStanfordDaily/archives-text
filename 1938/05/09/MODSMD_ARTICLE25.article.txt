vJOMETHING must have happened
in Los Angeles over the week
end.
Said one innocent bystander, in
sympathy with the cause of Stan
ford, "All I know is that I walked
into the Coliseum, and then—bam!
Here it is Sunday. What hap
pened?"
Just offhand, it seems as though
ihe place was swarming with Tro
jans. Stanford was in the same spot
as the guy that went hunting bear
with a 88-gun.

A LL things considered, today is a
fine day to talk about almost
anything but track and field. .For
instance, take football.
The way things are shaping up
now, the Card baekfield is going to
look something like the old days of
1933-34-35. Bill Paulman is working
at full in spring practice, with Jim
Groves at right half, Pete Fay at
left half, and Norm Standlee at up
man. When you figure that none
of those boys has any cinch on his
job, you can see Thornhill has
something there.
Fred Lcdeboer is as good a pros
pect for one of the halves as
Groves and Fay, especially on his
performance in practice Thursday
afternoon. A good blocker, fine
passer, and one of the hardest
hitting hacks on the team despite
his lack of weight, he might play
first string all next fall.
Standlee seems to be holding that
reputation he made as a frosh last
season, and, still uninitiated into
varsity competition, rates higher
than Coldiron and Alustiza. He's
another who they say can block.
If Thornhill can field two block
ers—good ones, that is, on the type
of Bones Hamilton—in the baekfield
this coming season, the Indians are
all set. However, blockers are hard
to get. To put in the words of
Thornhill himself, "Blocking is an
unnatural act, and one of the hard-,
est in football to learn."
The natural inclination, which
is tremendously difficult to break
without using all semblance of
fine. se, is to go after an opponent
with your hands. When you have
to block without using your hands,
you're at a loss. Most players
have a difficult time learning.
In blocking lies the secret of suc
cess of great football teams. It's an
art that must be acquired by every
man on the team, to a certain extent.
If every man on any team was as
capable at blacking as Hamilton, or
the former Santa Clara great, Nello
Falaschi, or California's John Meek,
that team could win a national
championship hands down. It could
let the water boy carry the ball and
still score touchdowns.
Stanford has running backs ga
lore for next fall, and half of them
can pass well. All the Cards will need
is good blocking—downfield, defens
ive, and offensive —to win the P.C.C.
At last reports, Thornhill still
hasn't found any All-Americans for
the guard jobs.—Peterson. .
