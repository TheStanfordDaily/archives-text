## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Trojans Trounce Card Track Team 
### 
Southern California's powerful track team defeated Stanford 94 1 G
-3ft 4 'ft Saturday iu the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Falling down all along the line, the Indians won only 3 events out of
15 and tied another. Bad link also dogged the Cardinal trail. First it was
Craig Williamson, tiny quarter-milcr, who was accidentally tripped b\ a

U.S.C. runner. As he fell to the turf,'
another Trojan, who was right be
hind him, spiked him on the heel
and arm,
Hiserman Injured
Stan Hiserman was the other
Stanford casualty. He struck a bar
rier while he was running second in
the 220-yard low hurdles and sus
tained a badly twisted knee when
he slid along the cinderpath.
Louis Zamperini, Troy's marvel
ous runner, proved without doubt
that all the adjectives painted about
him are true. Ed Burrows followed
Zamperini all the way, but when
the latter put on a burning last lap
sprint, Stanford's game red-head
just wasn't equal to it.
New Meet Record
Zamperini won by 25 yards in a
new meet record time of 4:1(5. The
old mark was held by Stanford's
Bob Alexander, who ran 4:20 last
year. Ned Jensen of S. C. also
passed Burrows in the last lap, but
Ed put on enough steam to finally
nip the second Trojan by two yards.
Captain Ray Malott, Stanford's
old dependable, won an easy verdict
i in the 440 over Erwin Miller of S.C.,
I who every track expert in Southern
I California thought had a good chance
of upsetting the Indian leader.
Miller made a bid 180 yards from
' the tape, but he never came closer
than three yards to Malott ,who
; finally won by live yards in 48.3,
Two Other Wins
j Stanford's two other wins came in
i the discus and shot put. In the lat
| ter event, Tom Montgomery finally
] returned to something like his pi'e
i season form to push the iron ball 50
! feet even and nose out Trojan Bob
j Fisher by three-quarters of an inch.
1 Stan Andersen was third at 40 feet,
6'£ inches.
Pete Zagar annexed the discus for
I Stanford with a toss of 152 feet,
inches. Phil Gaspar took second for
S.C. at 149 feet, 9 1 ,:> inches, just an

PETE ZAGAR
Southern California's powerful track team defeated Stanford 94 1 G
-3ft 4 'ft Saturday iu the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Falling down all along the line, the Indians won only 3 events out of
15 and tied another. Bad link also dogged the Cardinal trail. First it was
Craig Williamson, tiny quarter-milcr, who was accidentally tripped b\ a

U.S.C. runner. As he fell to the turf,'
another Trojan, who was right be
hind him, spiked him on the heel
and arm,
Hiserman Injured
Stan Hiserman was the other
Stanford casualty. He struck a bar
rier while he was running second in
the 220-yard low hurdles and sus
tained a badly twisted knee when
he slid along the cinderpath.
Louis Zamperini, Troy's marvel
ous runner, proved without doubt
that all the adjectives painted about
him are true. Ed Burrows followed
Zamperini all the way, but when
the latter put on a burning last lap
sprint, Stanford's game red-head
just wasn't equal to it.
New Meet Record
Zamperini won by 25 yards in a
new meet record time of 4:1(5. The
old mark was held by Stanford's
Bob Alexander, who ran 4:20 last
year. Ned Jensen of S. C. also
passed Burrows in the last lap, but
Ed put on enough steam to finally
nip the second Trojan by two yards.
Captain Ray Malott, Stanford's
old dependable, won an easy verdict
i in the 440 over Erwin Miller of S.C.,
I who every track expert in Southern
I California thought had a good chance
of upsetting the Indian leader.

PETE ZAGAR
Southern California's powerful track team defeated Stanford 94 1 G
-3ft 4 'ft Saturday iu the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Falling down all along the line, the Indians won only 3 events out of
15 and tied another. Bad link also dogged the Cardinal trail. First it was
Craig Williamson, tiny quarter-milcr, who was accidentally tripped b\ a

U.S.C. runner. As he fell to the turf,'
another Trojan, who was right be
hind him, spiked him on the heel
and arm,
Hiserman Injured
Stan Hiserman was the other
Stanford casualty. He struck a bar
rier while he was running second in
the 220-yard low hurdles and sus
tained a badly twisted knee when
he slid along the cinderpath.
Louis Zamperini, Troy's marvel
ous runner, proved without doubt
that all the adjectives painted about
him are true. Ed Burrows followed
Zamperini all the way, but when
the latter put on a burning last lap
sprint, Stanford's game red-head
just wasn't equal to it.
New Meet Record
Zamperini won by 25 yards in a
new meet record time of 4:1(5. The
old mark was held by Stanford's
Bob Alexander, who ran 4:20 last
year. Ned Jensen of S. C. also
passed Burrows in the last lap, but
Ed put on enough steam to finally
nip the second Trojan by two yards.
Captain Ray Malott, Stanford's
old dependable, won an easy verdict
i in the 440 over Erwin Miller of S.C.,
I who every track expert in Southern
I California thought had a good chance
of upsetting the Indian leader.
Miller made a bid 180 yards from
' the tape, but he never came closer
than three yards to Malott ,who
; finally won by live yards in 48.3,
Two Other Wins
j Stanford's two other wins came in
i the discus and shot put. In the lat
| ter event, Tom Montgomery finally
] returned to something like his pi'e
i season form to push the iron ball 50
! feet even and nose out Trojan Bob
j Fisher by three-quarters of an inch.
1 Stan Andersen was third at 40 feet,
6'£ inches.
Pete Zagar annexed the discus for
I Stanford with a toss of 152 feet,
inches. Phil Gaspar took second for
S.C. at 149 feet, 9 1 ,:> inches, just an
inch and a half better than Cardinal
Hugh Gribbin.
Russ Wulff speared a tie with De
; los Thurber, Troy's Olympic Games
veteran, in the high jump when
both cleared (j feet, 4 inches.
