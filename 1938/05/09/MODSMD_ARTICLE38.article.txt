# Tear It Down
## 
### 
STANFORD got off lucky Saturday after
noon when part of the boat-house col
lapsed. What might have been a tragedy
ended by pointing out in terms of bruises and
fright that Stanford must have a new boat
house.
There is little use in saying, "I told you so,"
by pointing to past Daily editorials condemn
ing the present structure on the basis of aes
thetics and safety. The accident has occurred,
and presumably something will be done about
it. James McDonnell, superintendent of build
ings and grounds, already has said that the
logical thing is to tear the boat-house down.
It is almost out of the question to think of do
ing anything else. Administration funds are
scarce, it is true, but it was made clear Satur
day that the house has long since passed the
margin of safety. Any attempts to patch the
damage would only put off the inevitable day
when a new structure must be built. In the
meantime, Stanford would have to cross its fin
gers and hope that no other collapse would
occur.
It is of no avail to accuse the Administration
of almost criminal negligence. Part of the blame
must be laid to those handling the Carnival for
allowing the house to be over-crowded. How
over, that the Administration was aware of
the doubtful conditions of safety was shown
last year when Nitery advocates were denied
trial use of the boat-house on the grounds that
jt might give way under the crowd.
The negligence has been paid for in unfa
vorable publicity and in injuries to victims of
the accident. Nothing more can be done about
what has happened. But the Administration
will be the rightful butt of strong condemna
tion if nothing is done about a structure that
long ago should have been part of a Big Game
bonfire.â€”J. S.
