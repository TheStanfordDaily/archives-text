ACCORDING to all financial barometers, the
senior class is going to find itself the proud
father of a husky surplus when June arrives.
There are still plenty of expense items lurk
ing in the accounting underbrush, but the bud
get predicts an excess, probably of about S5OO.
A surplus is a dangerous thing to keep lying
nround loose. It arouses the predatory instinct;
nnd since there is no closed season on sur
pluses, it is likely to be assaulted.
As soon as the senior balance made its ap
pearance, rumors about its fate began to circu
late. The most popular of these is the story
J hat it will be used to pay part of the com
mencement expense.
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, head of the
Public Exercises Committee, has denied the
rumor. The University, he says, has provided
for all necessary expenses of commencement.
The senior class may contribute if it likes, but
there is no particular reason why it should.
The story, he suggests, arose because last year
the seniors paid part of the costs of amphi
theater dedication which coincided with grad
uation.
And so the rumor passes quietly back into
the ether. But that does not solve the problem
of what should be done with the surplus. The
University may not want it, but other organiza
tions will. It is a safe rule of finance that wher
ever there is a surplus, there is some needy
organization stalking it.
The senior class executive committee is left,
then, with two problems. It must find a satis
factory way of disposing of the balance so that
it won't be given away carelessly at the end
of the year. And the committee must also
find a way of convincing next year's class that
it should reduce its charges and thus avoid
a surplus.
There is no reason why an excess should
exist. If a class needs money, it can raise it for
a stated purpose. A surplus indicates that the
class is bearing an unnecessary burden.
A surplus is a pretty financial plaything, but
it isn't needed. And as the seniors are find
ing, it is much easier to avoid than it is to
protect.â€”J. C.
