ACCORDING to what I believe is San Fran
cisco's best read sports column, the track

However careful checking proved that up
to a late hour last night Pacific Coast Confer
ence officials had not moved to suspend Stan
ford from track competition. Another survey
showed that local athletic officials had not yet
decided to abandon Angell Field.
And since there were no indications that
tiddledy-winks was to be made the major sport
at the University, it must be concluded that the
columnist's statement was meant in a more
abstract sense.
Which means that for Stanford to be in the
same league with U.S.C. must be an end in
itself, or that the result simply would be that
Stanford would be in the same league with
U.S.C., which is very abstract indeed.
