EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW
\IAYOR HAGUE is the law, in Jersey City at least,
and few dare to deny it—in Jersey City. Those
who do are summarily turned out of the city, as was
Norman Thomas, and those who plan to arc threatened
with such warm receptions that they decide to forego
the pleasure of the visit, as did two Representatives oi
the United States on Saturday last.
John T. Barnard of Minnesota and Jerry O'Connell
of Montana are probably rather harmless people, at
least as far as their ability to harm the Mayor in his
own citadel is concerned. The first is a Farmer-Labor
ite from Minnesota, the second a Democrat from Mon
tana; neither represents a particularly blood-thirsty
creed; neither plots revolution. But when they an
nounced their decision to speak in Jersey City as a
protest against the recent expulsion of Norman
Thomas, the outcry in that enlightened hamlet was
something to stagger the imagination—and the Repre
sentatives.
Eight hundred truculent American Legionnaires,
ever quick to defend democracy, announced their in
tention of "running the Reds out.' The police, long
accustomed io taking steps against enemies of Hague
happiness, got ready to meet the foe; various civic
groups, hastening to jump on the band-wagon, gave
notice that they looked with disfavor upon this attempt
to exercise freedom of speech; and the city began to
assume the aspect of a metropolis under siege.
Then the Representatives announced their decision
to stay home; and an interesting change came over the
city. Not only were the officers of the law and the
Mayor overjoyed, but the people themselves, if news
reports are to be believed, danced in joy in the streets.
* * *
r PHERE are many content to dismiss Frank Hague as
"not the first of the new bosses, but the last of the
old." As far as he personally is concerned, this may
be true; but the machine he has built up, the control
he exercises, and the position popular opinion and the
press have given him in the American scene, point to
a significance much wider than that neat phrase sug
gests.
If the papers are to be believed, the reaction of the
people of Jersey City was almost hysterical in its re
lief. Almost as though a great catastrophe had been
averted; as though something they hated and feared
had been valiantly kept, from the gates.
Whatever Hague's hold on his fellow-citizens, it is
certainly not conventional if it can make them stand
in such terror of free speech. It would almost seem to
point to the same sort of control as exists abroad; it
may point to a lime when history records that in days
of deepening depression and growing unrest, some
thing more than two Representatives were turned back
from the gates of Frank Hague's kingdom.

\IAYOR HAGUE is the law, in Jersey City at least,
and few dare to deny it—in Jersey City. Those
who do are summarily turned out of the city, as was
Norman Thomas, and those who plan to arc threatened
with such warm receptions that they decide to forego
the pleasure of the visit, as did two Representatives oi
the United States on Saturday last.
John T. Barnard of Minnesota and Jerry O'Connell
of Montana are probably rather harmless people, at
least as far as their ability to harm the Mayor in his
own citadel is concerned. The first is a Farmer-Labor
ite from Minnesota, the second a Democrat from Mon
tana; neither represents a particularly blood-thirsty
creed; neither plots revolution. But when they an
nounced their decision to speak in Jersey City as a
protest against the recent expulsion of Norman
Thomas, the outcry in that enlightened hamlet was
something to stagger the imagination—and the Repre
sentatives.
Eight hundred truculent American Legionnaires,
ever quick to defend democracy, announced their in
tention of "running the Reds out.' The police, long
accustomed io taking steps against enemies of Hague
happiness, got ready to meet the foe; various civic
groups, hastening to jump on the band-wagon, gave
notice that they looked with disfavor upon this attempt
to exercise freedom of speech; and the city began to
assume the aspect of a metropolis under siege.
Then the Representatives announced their decision
to stay home; and an interesting change came over the
city. Not only were the officers of the law and the
Mayor overjoyed, but the people themselves, if news
reports are to be believed, danced in joy in the streets.

r PHERE are many content to dismiss Frank Hague as
"not the first of the new bosses, but the last of the
old." As far as he personally is concerned, this may
be true; but the machine he has built up, the control
he exercises, and the position popular opinion and the
press have given him in the American scene, point to
a significance much wider than that neat phrase sug
gests.
If the papers are to be believed, the reaction of the
people of Jersey City was almost hysterical in its re
lief. Almost as though a great catastrophe had been
averted; as though something they hated and feared
had been valiantly kept, from the gates.
Whatever Hague's hold on his fellow-citizens, it is
certainly not conventional if it can make them stand
in such terror of free speech. It would almost seem to
point to the same sort of control as exists abroad; it
may point to a lime when history records that in days
of deepening depression and growing unrest, some
thing more than two Representatives were turned back
from the gates of Frank Hague's kingdom.
