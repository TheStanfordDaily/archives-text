URT WEILL, who wrote the music for Paul Green's
"Johnny Johnson," is another example of the
European situation where they lose and we gain.
Exiled from Germany because his music does not
find favor with the authorities, he is working in Para
mount Studios, writing background music for the
movies. Although still a young man, he has three
operas, two symphonies, and music for a half-dozen
plays and movies to his credit.
The operas were performed several years ago in
Berlin, under the direction of Dr. Otto Klempcrer,
conductor of the Los Angeles Symphony. Like a good
deal of modern music in Europe, he found his music
booed and hissed, and attacked from every side by the
critics. And like most jnusic exiles from Germany, he
is in disfavor because his music is too disonant.
It seems, I am told, the the Germans associate any
thing disonant with Communism, largely because of
the influence of Stravinsky. Hence the exile of such
men as Schoenberg.
One wonders how Richard Strauss has escaped of
ficial banishment, but he has been safely out of the
way in Austria for the last several years. Even Wag
ner is under suspicion, but maintains his top position
because of the subject matter of his operas, German
legend.
Of course, the fact that Hitler, personally, is a great
admirer of Wagner, makes it impossible for anyone to
do much in their effort to fit German music to Nazi
regime.

r JMIIS business of tying art into sociology and politics
is something that no musician can see. It is under
standable how certain music can be converted to na
tionalistic purposes. "Finlandia" for instance, turned
out to be the musical impetus to nationalize Finland.
But it is fallacious to presume that good music can
be written with the sole purpose in the mind of the
composer of creating propaganda. If good music is
produced, you can be sure that, the composer was
thinking of nothing at the time but music.
If Germany insists that all music must be "Nazi"
music—that is, pleasing to the Nazi big-wigs--one can
be pretty sure that it will not be much good. And
since they insist upon reading anti-Naziism into most
modern music, Germany is going to find itself on the
short end of the horn when they begin to count up
I their musical claims to immortality come L'O years.
