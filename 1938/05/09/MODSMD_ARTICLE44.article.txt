# Green's Play Successful, Cady Scores

### 
"Johnny Johnson," produced over
the week-end by the Division of
Speech and Drama:

For a produc-!
tion which would
have left Demos

his tunic for his!
own inadequacy,
the critic can
only stammer an i
eulogy. On the
whole, "Johnny
Johnson" was that
sort of produc-

tion.
The play's lumping together of
thick farce, grim satire, pathos, moral
indignation, and melodrama may be
dubious dramaturgy. But by rea
soning that life itself is just such an
irrational compound, the critic can
justify Playwright Paul Green's fail
ure to trim his dramatic wick. And
"Johnny Johnson" lashes opportune
ly out at the futility of war with a
vitality of dialogue and situation
which would have toppled the
Sphinx.
Cady Lives Part
However, the fact that Bud Cady
in the title role not only tussled suc
cessfully with a tough part but
achieved a perfect identity with it
—even put into it more than was
intrinsically there —dawned on the
playgoer early in the game.
In his purely incidental command
alone of Johnny's qualities—a com
bination of the loveable yokel and
the bedraggled sweet pathos of Dis
ney's Dopey—Mr. Cady goes Green
one better. But his final heart
breaking spectacle of the stubborn
nobility in man holding out againsl
gruelling forces for his ideal, should
be laid not to accident but to artistry
And if Cady in this struck no deepei
than the lines in the script, "The
Week-End of a Private Secretary'
is an aria from "Carmen."
We would also cut in on the hau
Bill Goetze, Hal Kahn, Dan Holtom
and Phil Brown; Goetze for his rick
ety Civil War vet; Kahn for his Li
onel Stander rasp as a tough recruit
ing officer; Holtom for his brief bi
as Clemenceau; and Brown for hi:
version of a balmy psychiatrist. Ex
cellent in small parts were Virginh
Sharpe, Kae Kalenborn, Richard Mc-
Carty, and Gerry Schreiber.
Some Uncvenncss
For direction perhaps any uneven
ness noted in Saturday's productioi
may be attributed partly to Green':
script. But if Director Gordoi
Lange had taken another week t<
iron out the discrepancies in pacing
if he had cut a few scenes in thi
first act, and if he had coordinate(
the whole a little more smoothly
the play might have neared techni
cal perfection—the only point 01
which it tottered at all. Howevei
Mr. Lange, in common with his cas
and the playwright, threw inti
"Johnny Johnson" all the weight o
a fine energy.
Kurt Weill's score was well keyei
to the mood, and, in several of th
minor themes, independently goot
—Slater.
