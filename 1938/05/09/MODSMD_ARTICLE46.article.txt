# CAMPUS OPINION
## I AND OTHERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have just read with much inter
est an editorial in a recent issue of
the Stanford Daily on the subject of
the "Lack of School Spirit at Stan
ford."
I have wanted to write to you for
some time on this subject but re
frained from doing so hoping you
would see the light and the matter
would correct itself.
I and many others in Los Angeles,
who are at present subscribers to
The Daily, have been wondering how
much longer you would tolerate your
sports editor and his "lousy" at
tempt to give out sports news on the
various athletic activities at Stan
ford, at this moment track.
I can not understand how you can
expect to have school spirit when
your own paper appears daily with
sarcastic cracks at the men on the
team. Get a sports writer who
thinks and writes sports. Make your
paper interesting to read and your
! school spirit will take care of itself.
Yours in all sincerity,
A Los Angeles Subscriber.
