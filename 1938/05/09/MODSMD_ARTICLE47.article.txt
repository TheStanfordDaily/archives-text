# POSITION UNDERSTOOD

### 
The Editor, Sir:
1 can very well understand the
I position taken by "Council for the
; Defense of Committee Chairwomen."
Anyone who finds it impossible to
attend Stanford on a mere $400 a
quarter can never appreciate the
! problems that confront a student less
fortunately situated.
Tag Day has merit for a certain
type of individual. It gives that per
son an opportunity to ostentatiously
display a badge of "virtue." Such
virtue must be cheap indeed wher
it can be purchased for 10 cents.
Undoubtedly the Convalescenl
Home is a very fine charity. Bui
there are many other very fine
! charities. Unfortunately, we can'l
I contribute to all.
some can contribute t(
none. Therefore, if every charity
drive committee took the attitude o
the Convalescent Home Committee
Chairwoman and her Council foi
Defense, there would be no escap<
; from the conclusion that everyont
iis a heel. I am charitable enougl
to believe this is not true.
i For that reason, I suggest again
as I did before, that a more success
j ful and more fitting appeal for char
ity is one that practices what i
preaches.
—Sidney F. De Goff.
