Theta Sigma Phis? Oh, they're the
women who hold the doughnut sales!
Good doughnuts, too.
There is more to Theta Sigma Phi
than doughnut sales, however. It is ,
the women's national honorary jour
nalistic fraternity, and it has an ac
tive chapter on the campus. It meets
once a week, and also holds weekly j
luncheon meetings with Sigma Delta |
Chi, men's professional journalistic :
fraternity. At these meetings, speak
ers prominent in the field of jour
nalism are featured.
Garden Party Planned
Present plans of the organization |
include a garden party to be held
during the last week of this month.
A national convention, to be held in
| Los Angeles, is scheduled for the j
summer.
Theta Sigma Phi was founded at I
the University of Washington on
April 8, 1909, and has 42 active
chapters in the United States. The 1
local chapter was discontinued in
1 1932 because of the small member
ship, but in 1936 it again became ac
tive. Annalee Whitmore, former
| Daily managing editor, was the first
president of the revived organiza
tion.
Journalistic Exchange
The purpose of the fraternity is to
enable college women interested in
any form of journalism to meet and

attempt to raise the standards of the
field of journalism and the place of
women in the profession.
Members are elected by the wom
en in the society for their interest in
journalism and their achievement in
scholarship. After initiation, held at
the beginning of the quarter, the
local roster reached a total of 30.

president; Jean Halliburton, secre
tary; Eunice Emry, treasurer; and
