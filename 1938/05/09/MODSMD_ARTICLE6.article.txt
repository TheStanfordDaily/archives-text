# The 						Daily And The Heels Go 'Round: No Suit
## Tag Day 'Opinions' Tagged Out at Home 
### JOHN COBBS 
In last Friday's issue. The Daily ;
printed a letter to the editor which j
charged Sidney DeGoff, law stu- 1
dent, with: 1) being a heel, 2) pay- I
ing for a Tag Day tag with a slug.
For these statements there is no
proof, and The Daily disclaims any j
intent of implying that they were j
true. In the column of definitions
which Webster allots the term
"heel" there is no meaning which i
could be proved to apply to DeGoff. i
And to single one slug out of $251.55
in small change, and lay it at Dc-
Goffs' door is hardly sound logic.
Suit Rumored
Word reached The Daily yester- ;
day that DeGoff had reached these
conclusions and was planning to
bring suit against the editor and
against the writer of the letter. It
also was rumored that he would sue
the editor for opening mail addressed
to DeGoff personally.
The reports were denied by De-
Goff. "Technically it's libel," he
said, "but I intend to let the whole
thing drop. If I did plan to sue The
Daily, which I do not, it could be
held for the statements, even though
they were published innocently.
Part of the crime was publishing it."
"The whole thing is foolish," he
added.
Legal Points
Amateur lawyers pointed out that
a suit by DeGoff would raise a
"pretty" legal question. DeGoff as
a member of Associated Students of
Stanford University is one of the
publishers of The Daily. Amateur
law broke down at that point and
fought with itself as to whether or
not that would wreck the suit.
Dean Marion Kirkwood of the
law school said that it wouldn't
make any difference.
"Probably The Daily couldn't be
sued," he said, "because it has no
legal organization. But the editor
could be sued."
The Daily has decided that it will
not censure DeGoff for failing to
stand up for his legal rights.
