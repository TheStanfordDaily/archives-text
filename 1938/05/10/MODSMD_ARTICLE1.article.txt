### BILL MILLIS 
jVOW THAT Adolf Hitler and
Benito Mussolini have concluded
their seven-day conversations, it has
become the job of diplomatic "ob
servers" and of "persons close to
the Berlin Foreign Office" to quiet
the speculations of the world over
what actually happened in Rome
with a barrage of official declara
tions of purposes.
Hardly had Der Fuehrer given II
Duce a final handshake and embrace
in Florence, Italy last night, before
Berlin officials announced the con
ditions which Germany and Italy
have agreed upon as pre-requisites
for negotiations for a "New Lo
carno."
These conditions, as announced
unofficially, can give little hope to
those "realistic" English and
French statesmen who believe
that a diplomacy of appeasement
will cause the axis-powers to
modify their demands for reor
ganization of the Europe estab
lished at Versailles.
In addition to renewing their old
plea that the Franco-Soviet "mu
tual assistance" alliance must be
abandoned, Hitler and Mussolini
also decided that the western pow
ers must recognize "the mutual
Italo-German interests and the
service of the Rome-Berlin axis,"
and—which is by far the most im
portant—that Britain and France
must withdraw all promised aid to
Czechoslovakia and x-efuse to limit
Germany's reborn dream of "the
March to the East."
Although conceding that "many
obstacles" remain to be overcome,
German diplomats were reported
ly convinced that a Four Power
Pact upon the basis of their de
mands can ultimately be achieved.
In Geneva rumors were prevalent
that deposed Emperor Haile Selassie
is ready for a spectacular airplane
flight from England, in order to
plead with the League of Nations
council for his Ethiopian throne.
Earlier, the council agreed at a
secret session to admit Ethiopian
delegates "without prejudice to
any principles and without rais
ing any question of credentials."

INURING recent weeks a most
powerful political battle has de
veloped in Washington over efforts
to modify the neutrality act insofar
a.s it affects the Spanish and Sino-
Japanese wars.
Yesterday such efforts "appeared
to be doomed to failure, at least dur
ing this session of Congress, after
a conference of President Roosevelt
with Secretary of State Cordell Hull
and with congressional leaders.
While the President did not an
nounce his views, House Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn was em
phatically opposed to "monkey
ing with the neutrality law at
this time."

In Spain Loyalist dispatches
claimed that reorganized Canadian
brigades had driven a new salient
20 miles in the rear of the Insurgent
troops advancing down the coast to
wards Castellon.
Insurgents, however, reported
that they were merely "holding
up their advance until they can
straighten out their front near
Teruel."

The "mysterious case" of Mrs.
Ruth Marie Rubens, American pris
oner of the Soviet government, will
again be investigated by the United
States embassy at Moscow. Nothing
has been heard of Mrs. Rubens, ar
rested on "counter-revolutionary"
charges, since she refused offers of
American aid when interviewed by
embassy officials several weeks ago.
