## 
### 
A Boston attorney, who received
! a University Graduate Fellowship j
I in 1921-22, this week sent to Presi
| dent Ray Lyman Wilbur a check for
the equivalent sum accompanied by j
a request to establish the fellowship
as a "re-issue."
The donor is Edwin W. Hadley,
| A.B. '20 and J.D. '23, of the firm of
j Galluu and Hadley, and a faculty |
j member of a Boston school of law.
| Mr. Hadley is suggesting to two
I other holders of University Grad
! uate Fellowships of the same year j
{that they also establish new fellow- i
I ships.
The Committee on Scholarships is |
now engaged in selecting an appro- I
priate name for the fellowship.
