### 
"There are signs that the word
'Victorian' is again becoming almost
respectable!"
This was the keynote of "Those
Quaint Victorians," a talk given
yesterday evening on the Stanford
University Radio Hour by Dr. John
W. Dodds. associate professor of
English.
"Gradually, we are seeing the past
century in better perspective, said
Dr. Dodds. "For better or worse,
i modern industry and modern de
| mocracy as England knows them
! are the product of the Victorian
! age.
"These men. confronted by a com
plete social revolution for the solv
ing of which they had no precedents,
were grappling with problems which
we, in all our twentieth-century
wisdom, have been unable to solve.
And it is just here that the Victor
ian age has so many affinities with
our own."
Dr. Dodds continued with some of
the ideas of Thomas Carlyle and
Matthew Arnold who, he said, "have
surprisingly provocative and timely
things to tell us.
"It mighl be worth our while,"
he concluded, "to examine our pres
ent political and intellectual fash
ions in the light cast by (hose men
who faced, almost a century ago,
problems surprisingly the same as
our own. and whose earnest clear
sightedness age cannot wither nor
custom entirely stale."
