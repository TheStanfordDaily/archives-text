# 'Peace' Near Full Status As Subject
## Stuart Will Teach New Course; Result Of Popular Demand 
### 
A course on peace "very prob
ably" will be given at Stanford next
year, President Ray Lyman Wilbur
announced yesterday. Dr. Graham
Stuart, professor of political science,
will conduct it.
The course, which will be called
International Organization for
Peace, is designed to meet the recent
requests by students for a general
study 1 of the factors that enter into
peace and war. According to Dr.
Stuart, it will 'synthesize the whole
field of efforts toward world peace."
Compact Course
"It will be an effort to integrals
into one general course the informa
tion which is now offered separately
by a number of departments," he
said.
Tentative plans for a syllabus in
clude consideration of the causes of
war, the efforts for peace, the pres
ent situation, and the possibility of
peaceful change of the status-quo.
The last topic, peaceful change,
will include redistribution of raw
materials, alleviation of population
pressure, revision of oppressive
treaties, Dr. Stuart said.
For Co-operation
The course will also give attention
to non-political means of interna
tional co-operation such as the
postal union, the sanitation projects,
and to existing international organ
izations.
Dr. Stuart will be in complete
charge of the course. No attempt
will be made to distribute the work
among various departments.
"There must be centralization,"
Dr. Stuart said. "If responsibility is
divided among departments, the
course is likely to get oat of hand
and become disintegrated."
To Synthesize Fields
According to the present'plan thr
course will remain in the political
science departing.but will attempt
[ to synthesize the information of
fered by other fields.
"It will be entirely possible to
cover in one course the material
where economics, history, political
science, and sociology overlap," Dr.
Stuart said.
Based on History
The course, he said, will not at
tempt to make any emotional appeal
of pacifism. "It will be based on
historical development, and will seek
to study the various factors that en
ter into peace. It will evaluate these,
and show how they affect the
chances of obtaining permanent
peace. Possible solutions of thr
problem will be studied and eval
uated."
Economics Stressed
"Economic aspects will receive
i considerable stress," he said.
Dr. Stuart's ideas of what a peace
course should contain coincide with
the conclusions reached at a reccnt
conference of teachers of interna
tional law and relations and of the
American Society of International
Law, held at Washington. Dr.
Stuart, a delegate to the meeting,
brought up the question of peace
courses in American colleges. His
action, he said, was prompted by the
recent agitation for such a course at
Stanford.
At Other Colleges
The course which Dr. Stuart is
now planning is modeled on the con
| elusions reached at the conference
debate. A number of other colleges,
he reports, are planning similar
courses. Most of the delegates, he
said, concluded that a course in
peace should be given in American
J colleges.
Dr. Stuart believes that the course
! lie is planning will be of consider
i able benefit to the students. In his
opinion, it will give an idea of the
importance of the problem, and it
will evaluate the effort that has al
ready been put into it. It will point
the way to individual research on
specific problems, and may help to
bring about a "saner" attitude
toward peace.
To Eliminate War
He hopes that this and similar
courses may help to shape the move
ment for peace.
"I don't see why the elimination
of war should not be possible, just
as the elimination of slavery was
possible," he said.
Neither Dr. Stuart nor President
Wilbur were sure what part the
ideas of the students would play in
the organization of the new course.
Their suggestions are always wel
come, Dr. Stuart said. According to
Dr. Wilbur, the students' role in
shaping the course will be deter
mined by personal contact.
Popular Request
Student requests for organization
of the course were first presented
to Ex Committee which referred the
matter to the Student Faculty Rela
tions Committee. Dr. Wilbur offered
to investigate the possibility of or
ganizing the course, and it was he
who placed it in Dr. Stuart's hands.
