# Chemistry Honorary Aids Investigations
## 
### BOB SUMNER 
Phi Lambda Upsilon, honorary
chemistry fraternity, was established

at the University of Illinois in 1899
to serve in the field of chemistry
much as Phi Beta Kappa and Tau
Beta Pi serve in their respective
fields.
The purpose of the fraternity is to
promote high scholarship and orig
inal investigation, hence members
are chosen with an eye to initiative
and character as well as to scholar
ship.
There is no set limit as to the
grades which must be made before
admission to the fraternity, but the
grade records of the candidates for
membership are considered before
the individuals are voted upon.
Graduates are voted into the fra
ternity upon recommendation of
faculty members without considera
tion of scholastic averages. Many
•men already outstanding in the
field of chemistry are elected into
the fraternity as honorary rather
than active members.
At present there are 36 chapters
in Phi Lambda Upsilon and its mem
bership totals well over 7000. In
the Stanford chapter there are now
17 faculty members, 25 graduate
students, and 7 undergraduates,
making a total of 49 members.
The present officers of the local
chapter incude Simon Kinsman,
president; Robert Urner, vice-presi
dent; Warren Buell, secretary; Mar
tin Synerholm; and John Gates,
alumni secretary.
Flies live only 48 hours.
