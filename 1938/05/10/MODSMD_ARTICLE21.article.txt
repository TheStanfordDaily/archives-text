Two changes in the cast of the
Spring Show "Is Europe?" to be

nounced today by Co-director J. P.
Cahn.
Yvonne Hazlett, new and popular
campus singer was unable to re

Martin, Stager member.
Campbell Substitute
Role of Miss Ponkey, old maid
school teacher in charge of a group
of American college students on tour,
will be played by Virginia Sharpe,
substituting for Kay Campbell, who
was recently awarded the lead in
Edith Wharton's "The Old Maid."
"Is Europe?" was written by Hal
Kahn and Ed Kerr during spring
vacation. The authors stated that
Warner Brothers studios are inter
ested in the show as future movie
material, and the script is now in
their hands. Kahn has been affiliat
ed with a Warner Bros, play-writing
school.
In answer to queries concerning
the origin of the title, the authors
had only this to say:
Title Ambiguous
"The title is ambiguousâ€”and so
'is Europe'."
Music for"Is Europe?" has been
written by well-known Farm song
teams including Jim Stone and Bar
bara Rosenblatt who have compos
ed, "Strange As It Seems" which is
predicted to be the hit song of the
show; and Hank Rhodes, Bud Cady,
J. P. Cahn, and Hoke Roberts who
have swelled the number of new
pieces to nine. Several of these
songs will be previewed tomorrow
night at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel
by the leads of the show, Owen
Clarke and Shirley Jones, accom
panied by Carl Ravazza's orchestra.
