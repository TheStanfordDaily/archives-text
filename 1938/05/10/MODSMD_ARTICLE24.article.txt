Between 700 and 800 alumni will ]
return to the campus on May 14 and
15 for two afternoons of lectures and !
conferences on all phases of modern !
learning, according to Robert Hamil
ton, chairman of the sixth annual j
Stanford Alumni Conference. Reser
vations for the meetings and the ;
banquet which follows them are
coming in "very nicely," Hamilton
said yesterday.
Climax of the conference will be
an address by James M. Landis,
dean of the Harvard Law School and ;
former chairman of the Security Ex- j
change Commission, on "The Role of j
Law in Regulation," to be delivered
at the alumni banquet Sunday eve
ning. Landis will also speak at an
all-University Assembly on Mon
day.
Among the twenty-odd Stanford
professors who will lecture or par
ticipate in round-table discusisons
during the conference are Edgar E.
Robinson, Paul Eliel. Raymond Ken
dall, Paul E. Holden, Philip W.
Buck, Joseph S. Davis, Graham Stu
art, Reginald Bell, Norman Fenton,
Ernest Hilgard, William S. Hopkins,
Margery Bailey, William F. Durand,
George W. Dowrie, -Helen Green,
Samuel B. Morris, and Ralph H.
Lutz. Outside speakers and panel
leaders include Lowry Howard,
president of Menlo Junior College,
and James De Voss of San Jose State
College.
The opening address of the con
ference will be delivered by Edgar
E. Robinson, professor of history,
Saturday afternoon on "Democracy
â€”Then and Now." William F. Du
rand, mechanical engineering pro
fessor emeritus and a national figure
in the engineering and aeronautical
fields, will lecture on "Power and
Civilization" Sunday afternoon.
The purpose of the Alumni Con
ference, first held in 1930, is to give
graduates a chance to return to the
detached atmosphere of their Uni

versity and reeheck and supplement
their academic training according to
the light of their contact with the
world.
In the West, Stanford has taken
the lead in offering its alumni this
opportunity, and has tried to give
them the most objective and "up
to-date" views of its outstanding
faculty members on current eco
nomic, political, and social trends.
The first conference in 1930 was at
tended by 255 graduates and since
then the number has steadily in
creased.
