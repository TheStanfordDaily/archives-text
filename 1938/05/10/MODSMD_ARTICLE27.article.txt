# Sales Deadline Set For Special Quads
## 
### 
Min Tompkins, Quad business
manager, announced yesterday that
all those who want their Quads this
year with names engraved, must
have their orders in immediately.
Because the progress of the print
ing is indefinite, date for book orders
with names cannot be set, but an
early delivery is expected. Regular
post office sales will be held for
Quads this week.
