JJEHIND all that stewing around
that occurred in the U.S.C. meet
Saturday, over the question of tape
and shotputting and pole vaulting,
lies an interesting anecdote.
Tom Montgomery, giant shotput
ter, started to compete with the
same tape bandage on his wrist that
he s had for the past few meets. He
has been having plenty of trouble
with a sprained wrist, which is one
reason he hasn't been hitting that
. r )0-foot mark as he should.
But anyway, the judge in charge
of the shot competition took a look
at the bandage before Tom started
to put, and, according to John
Bunn. decided it was legal. Kunii
decided it was legal. Bunn was
one of the officials at the meet.
Later in the competition U.S.C.
protested the bandage, and the shot
put judge, who must go unnamed,
changed hi.s mind and told Mont
gomery to take it off. Tom argued,
and Bunn argued, but it didn't do
any good. It didn't even do any
good to show the judge the official
rule—all he had to say, according to
Bunn, was, "I don't care what the
rule says, I'm the boss here."
Lest there be any question about
the rule, here it is. It is listed in
the olficial N.C.A.A. rule book as
No. 32, entitled, "Putting the Shot":
"... The use of a harness or
any mechanical device attached
to the hand or arm shall not he
allowed. This shall not he con
strued as prohibiting the use of
tape or cloth bandages."
II any rule was any clearer, or
applied more closely to a situation
in question, John Bunn would like
to hear oj' it. Tom Montgomery
might be interested, too.
At any rate, Monty had to put
without the tape, and took a chance i
on ruining his wrist for good. The
argument's outcome made him just
angry enough to win the event, and
perhaps it will have restored some
of the confidence he lost when he
went into his slump some time ago.

JJANK LUISETTI is a valuable
cargo to the Convalescent Home
Drive brass hats these days,, since
he will be the feature attraction at
the benefit basketball game Thurs
day night. The Drive almost lost
its prize package when The Angel
and his automobile came to grief
Saturday morning.
However, he showed up this morn
ing with little more than a sore
thumb to bother him. and so he
ought to be able to go.
The second Oregon game last
quarter was supposed to be the !
very last time Hank would appear
as a Stanford player and as an
amateur, but Coach Bunn has a
special letter from somebody or
other in the amateur G.H.Q. which
says the old maestro can compete
with the rest of the Cards without
endangering anyone's standing.
However, outside of the moving
pictures this is liable to be the last
time the world will have a chance
l< see Luisetti play basketball, since
he has declared his intention to quit
the game altogether. Take it from
ar old hand who goes nutty every
time he sees Hank play, he's worth#
four bits of anybody's money.
Besides, that four bits you speiad
to get in Thursday night goes a
good cause, Stanford's pet charity for
years, those happy kids over the
Home.—Peterson. /
