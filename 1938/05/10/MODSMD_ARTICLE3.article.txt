# Excom Plans To Continue Axe Probe
## Junior Scholarship May Be Abandoned; Amendment Given 
### 
With last week's discussion of Axe '
Society—what and why—still sim- {
mering, Ex Committee tonight will ,
continue consideration of the
service organization.
Main point of dissension between
the members last week was the
question of whether or not Axe was
taking over duties which should
rightfully be handled by Cardinals.
Tonight, suggestions as to making a
dividing line between the two
groups will be aired.
Informal meetings by members
with President Tom Killefer have
brought out suggestions that Axe be
allowed to handle any new activities
which they wish to sponsor. Cardi
nals will, as in the past, handle all
established A.S.S.U. functions.
Opinions as to the proper place of
Axe in the A.S.S.U. set-up to be
considered tonight include:
That it be put back into the place
of a purely honorary society; that
its duties, on the basis of its service
this year, be extended further.
Pre-Rcg Committee
Second job to be handled by the
body tonight will be the appointment
of the pre-reg Steering Committee,
to work under Chairman Dave Ryus.
To calm rumors that Axe, rather
than Cardinals will be running the
affair, it has been suggested that the
members be appointed from the
latter body.
Meeting yesterday afternoon, Ex
Committee's Drives Committee de
cided to recommend tonight that the
Junior Class drive be abandoned.
Reasons given for their recommend- j
ation were: "The drive has failed in
its purpose to unite the class, and j
any further activity would result in j
direct solicitation."

editing the Freshman Handbook I

An assistant to Bob Maiden, head
of the Speakers' Bureau will be
chosen tonight. Political Union con
stitution, which was submitted last
week, will also be up. for ap
proval by Ex Committee.
As a preliminary to the meeting,
the group will meet at the home
of Dean Mary Yost, at 532 Lasuen,
for dessert.

With last week's discussion of Axe '
Society—what and why—still sim- {
mering, Ex Committee tonight will ,
continue consideration of the
service organization.
Main point of dissension between
the members last week was the
question of whether or not Axe was
taking over duties which should
rightfully be handled by Cardinals.
Tonight, suggestions as to making a
dividing line between the two
groups will be aired.
Informal meetings by members
with President Tom Killefer have
brought out suggestions that Axe be
allowed to handle any new activities
which they wish to sponsor. Cardi
nals will, as in the past, handle all
established A.S.S.U. functions.
Opinions as to the proper place of
Axe in the A.S.S.U. set-up to be
considered tonight include:
That it be put back into the place
of a purely honorary society; that
its duties, on the basis of its service
this year, be extended further.
Pre-Rcg Committee
Second job to be handled by the
body tonight will be the appointment
of the pre-reg Steering Committee,
to work under Chairman Dave Ryus.
To calm rumors that Axe, rather
than Cardinals will be running the
affair, it has been suggested that the
members be appointed from the
latter body.
Meeting yesterday afternoon, Ex
Committee's Drives Committee de
cided to recommend tonight that the
Junior Class drive be abandoned.
Reasons given for their recommend- j
ation were: "The drive has failed in
its purpose to unite the class, and j
any further activity would result in j
direct solicitation."

With last week's discussion of Axe '
Society—what and why—still sim- {
mering, Ex Committee tonight will ,
continue consideration of the
service organization.
Main point of dissension between
the members last week was the
question of whether or not Axe was
taking over duties which should
rightfully be handled by Cardinals.
Tonight, suggestions as to making a
dividing line between the two
groups will be aired.
Informal meetings by members
with President Tom Killefer have
brought out suggestions that Axe be
allowed to handle any new activities
which they wish to sponsor. Cardi
nals will, as in the past, handle all
established A.S.S.U. functions.
Opinions as to the proper place of
Axe in the A.S.S.U. set-up to be
considered tonight include:
That it be put back into the place
of a purely honorary society; that
its duties, on the basis of its service
this year, be extended further.
Pre-Rcg Committee
Second job to be handled by the
body tonight will be the appointment
of the pre-reg Steering Committee,
to work under Chairman Dave Ryus.
To calm rumors that Axe, rather
than Cardinals will be running the
affair, it has been suggested that the
members be appointed from the
latter body.
Meeting yesterday afternoon, Ex
Committee's Drives Committee de
cided to recommend tonight that the
Junior Class drive be abandoned.
Reasons given for their recommend- j
ation were: "The drive has failed in
its purpose to unite the class, and j
any further activity would result in j
direct solicitation."

editing the Freshman Handbook I

may be turned in to Killefer until |
