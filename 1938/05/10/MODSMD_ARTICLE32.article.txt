### 
j With Fresno's Relays scheduled to
; be the next competitive otfori of the
!season, Coach Dink Templet* n ran
j his trackmen through a stiff work
] out yesterday on Angell Field.
Stanford's team, as a wholt, un
doubtedly had an off-day {"gainst
the Trojans last Saturday and Tem
i pleton hopes that they have jotten
I it out of their system.
However, there were several shin
j ing performances turned vi by Farm
i cinderpathmen. Sumrvr "Duke"
| Gill boosted himself t' the greatest
height of his career -vhen he tied for
third at 13 feet G inches.
Poor Stan for Ray
Kay Maiott didnt look as bad as
his third place in the furlong would
indicate. Captair Ray got off to a
poor start and ,vas running fourth
midway throug.i the race. How
ever, once he put on his power-drive
finish, he started making up ground
feet at a strid;.
He passed Mickey Anderson of
S.C. and barely was nipped by Troy's
Payton Jordtn for second place.
Adrian Talley won the event.
Tom Montgomery's 50-I'oot shot
put heave, v/hich won the event for
him last Saturday, seems to have
started the lanky giant out of his
slump. Yesterday he was flipping
the shot consistently over the 50-
foot mark in practice.
Stan on Side-Lines
Stan Hiserman, ace Farm sprinter
hurdler, who nabbed a second in the
century and then spilled while he
was running second in the low hur
dles, watched yesterday's practice
from the side-lines. Hiserman sus
tained a bruised knee and has been
ordered to rest for a couple of days.
Terr.pleton spent most of practice
giving his hurdlers. Bill Hawkins
and Dick Simpson, a few fine points
on barrier form.
Zagar Races
With the dual meet season now
finished, the Cardinal mentor is
working on his individual stars in
an effort to have them at top shape
fou" the coming all-star meets, such
as) the 1.C.4-A., N.C.A.A., Pacific
Cjpast Conference collegiate and the
P|p.C.-Big Ten meet.
• 'The classic of yesterday's drill was
a! 100-yard dash between Pete Zagar
aAd Stan Andersen. The two be
hemoths thundered down the
mraightaway to the tune of flying
cinders and pounding hooves until
Petey pulled up with a strained
'muscle.
Andersen triumphantly an
nounced after his sterling quest th-.t
he was now gunning for a wrestling
match with the speedy Zagar.
