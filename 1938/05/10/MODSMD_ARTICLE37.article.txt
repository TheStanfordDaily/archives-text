# Red Machine To Be Heavy
## Next Fall's Team May Average 193 
### 
If Tiny Thornhill slicks to the
same first-string line-up that ho has
been using in spring practice, the
! Big Red Machine next fall will aver
age at least 193 pounds per man.
This average would necessarily in
clude Stan Andersen and Pete Za
j gar, last year's first string tackles, in
i place of Corky Donahue and By
j West. Donahue weighs a scant 200
| while West tips the beam at 190.
j Zagar and Andersen, however, will
have to make up a lot of ground to
I catch up with the improved second
j string men.
Lightest man on the potential first
team is Pete Fay, 174-pound right
I half. Fay could pass easily for 150
|or less, but football weights are us
ually deceiving. The heaviest is
I Zagar at 221, followed by Andersen
at 210.
A backfield of Fay, Jim Groves,
i Norm Standlee, and Bill Paulman
hits a mean of 191 and still possesses
J unusual speed afoot. The best line
; will average at least 195. This would
| include Jack Clark and Bill McElroy
lat ends. Zagar and Andersen at
i tackles. Bob Dakan and Dick Sutton
at guards and Tony Calvelli at cen
ter. McElroy is the "midget" of the
forward wall at 175.
Among the other outstanding pros
pects come Hamp Pool at a trifling
1 225, guards Ed Johannessen and
| Claude Purkitt at 210 and 220 re
spectively among the heavy men,
, and Jakie Thompson around 1(54,
Bill Kirsch at 170, and Freddie Lede
! Boer at 173 in the lightweight divi
' sion.
The sixth week of spring training
I got under way yesterday wit h prac
tice on plays and work on the tack
; ling dummies. Bill Paulman was
j back in suit again, but Thornhill de
layed scrimmages until later in the
I week.
