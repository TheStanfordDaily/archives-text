# Hoop Tilt To Match 'Upstarts,' '5 Old Men'
## 
### 
They're called The Upstarts, these
basketballers who will meet the
Laughing Boys Thursday night.
The game, with opening whistle
scheduled lor 8 o'clock Thursday
night in the Pavilion, is being played
for the benefit of the Convalescent
Home. Tickets, at 50 cents each,
are now on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice.
Coached by John Bunn and Wytze
Gorter, approximately 30 hogpsters
—all of whom will be back next year
—are working out daily for their
first big test.
The graduating seniors, who will
oppose them, call them The Up
starts. And The Upstarts, not to be
outdone, call their rivals The Five
Old Men.
Yesterday, Mentors Bunn and
Gorter literally scrimmaged the
shoes from the feet of their proteges,
with every man seeing action at one
time or another.
Bunn and Gorter refused to re
lease The Upstarts' opening quintet,
commenting, "We're not going to
give those guys anything to work
on."
Looking good for them, however,
were Don Burness, Leon Lafaille,
Darrell Huddleson, Bob Burnett,
and Gil Rahn. Phil Zonne, just
named next year's captain, will not
play. He has pneumonia, and is in
the hospital.
Although injured slightly in an
auto accident last Saturday, Hank
Luisetti will be ready to play, along

! with helpmates Art Stoefen, Jack
| Calderwood, Beebs Lee, Dak Hull,
and Nellie Heath.
Despite their claims of unfair
court hogging on the part of the op»
position, in that they never get a
chance to work out. The Five Old
Men did all right by themselves yes-
J terday in a fast scrimmage.
After piling up a IG-2 lead against
a pick-up team led by Bunn, the
Old Boys tired and their lead
dropped to 20-1(5. But, according
|to Calderwood, "Bunn couldn't
j stand our terrific speed," and the
I pick-ups were finally beaten. 32-20.
