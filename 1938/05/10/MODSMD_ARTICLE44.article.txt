# A 						Speedy Peace
## 
### 
YESTERDAY when President Wilbur an
nounced that Dr. Graham Stuart was or
ganizing a peace course for next year, he set
an all-time record for administrative response
and reflex.
First mention of the proposed course ap
peared in The Daily just three weeks ago. A
week later Dr. Wilbur undertook to investigate
the chances of establishing it. Today the course
has a godfather, a name, and a career.
The time on that reaction was certainly the
the fastest ever clocked in this conference. And
it is particularly impressive when we remem
ber the god-like slowness with which the Uni
versity mills sometimes grind.
It is possible that the machinery cut in the
overdrive on thrs job because it has been over
hauled. Or perhaps the speed was due to co
incidence—finding the right man on the first
1 rial. But neither explanation is probable.
If we can depend on the laws of administra
tive mechanics, we can assume that the real
reason for the abnormally fast handling of the
peace course was that students and faculty
wanted it. If the faculty had been apathetic and
disinterested, the project would have withered
quietly in a pigeon-hole catacomb. If the stu
dents hadn't shown interest, the faculty would
not have bothered to consider the course.
The project is still a long way from the Time
Schedule. And it can perish along the way,
either from neglect or from well-meant mauling.
But the fact that it has come as far as it has
shows that it is wanted. No course could reach
the point of organization unless students and
faculty wanted it and felt that it was needed.
Our peace course may have a hard time
working out its career, but at least it has started
in the best Dale Carnegie tradition.—J. C.
