# Give 'Em the Axe
## 
### 
ONE Tuesday evening of last May, four or
five well known campus figures filed into
Ex Committee's sanctum, asked its sanction
for a new campus group, the Axe Society.
It's purpose, Dern, Franich, Milligan, Halaby
and others explained, was "to heal the Hall-
Row split," and "wield its influence behind
other campus problems."
Ex Committee, somewhat impressed, granted
its approval. Tonight it will tackle the unique
problem of what to do with an Axe Society that
has become too efficient, and too willing to
make up for Cardinals' lethargy.
■ For Ex Committee has found the Society a
very willing worker, prepared to take on new
and old jobs in campus activities, and to do
them well. The trouble is that Ex Committee
already has Cardinals equipped and specifical
ly directed to be an activities center.
The problem didn't arise until quite recently,
when the Society asked to handle the Pre
registration program. Before that it had worked
only on new affairs, without traditional Asso
ciated Students activity status.
Members participated as individuals in last
year's pre-reg program, and then in the fall
he Society engineered an agreement between
Hall and Row, safeguarding clubs from frater
nity raids on their members. Since then the
society has been content to fulfill its original
purpose by keeping its own membership split
between Hall and Row.
' A well organized and successful drive for
'our Buck-of-the-Month Club scholarships fol
lowed but adverse criticism drove the Society
somewhat under cover. Nevertheless it staged
the well-attended student-faculty field day, and
has charge of the A.S.S.U. activities file.
Looking for fresh worlds to conquer it asked
for Pre-Reg, succeeded in having the chairman
of the program chosen from its members.
Just what course Ex Committee should take
tonight to keep from having two organizations
doing the same sorts of jobs is not clear. On
Ihe point of efficiency it might switch its favor
to the new organization. It might stay on the
same side of the fence by appointing the sub
committee chairmen of Pre-Reg from Cardinals'
ranks; the chairman belongs both to Cardinals
and Axe. Or it might try to distiftguish between
new and continuing activities, and hold the Axe
to the new ones.
But if Ex Committee continues on its present
course of giving Axe Society all it believes it
an handle, the set-up should be changed. There
ay be no danger of the Society getting out of

hand, because the Committee can .stop any
project through control of dates and funds. Y«>l
the Committee is able to determine Cardinals'
policy through review of minutes and indirect
control of membership, and no such control can
be exercised over Axe Society.
Whatever course the Committee takes to
night, its greatest problem is going to be
straightening out its activities snarl without dis
couraging Axe Society.
For organizations with initiative and willing
ness to take responsibility are hard to find. And
Axe Society's greatest service may be in show
ing up Cardinals' faults.
