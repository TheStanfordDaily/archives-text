# BULL SESSION
## THE 						EMPERORS 
### 
forgotten men have been in the news together
for the past week, one in Rome, and one in Geneva;
more in the news than either has been since an omni
potent Italian Duce declared one of them out of a job
and proclaimed the other in.
One represents one of Europe's youngest royal
families, the House of Savoy; the other is an earnest
tribal chieftain who pulled himself up by his boot
straps and a little judicious murder to the leadership
of his country. Each is Emperor of Ethiopia.
Victor Emmanuel's prominence has come in con
nection with Adolf Hitler's visit to Rome. During the
week—too brief for a puppet monarch suddenly given
the spotlight—he has received more official recogni
tion, more attention from photographers, mor» courtesy
from his Prime Minister than at any time since the
close of the Ethiopian conflict.
Hitler's first act in Rome was to visit the King; and
the King has been on hand ever since, at this parade
and that review, posing for picture after picture in
which he has stood like a wistfully grateful little
sparrow in the shadow of Europe's strong men.
And the pictures show that he has enjoyed it, even
if it has made him rather nervous. He gives an im
pression of hoping so much that his two friends will
get along well together; his very pose and expression
are conciliatory, as though he were about to say,
"Gentlemen, gentlemen!" in a tone of mild and de
precating reproach he also looks as though he could
never quite get up enough nerve to say it. Now that
Hitler has gone home to Berlin, he will probably re
tire to the obscurity of his palace with a pleased feeling
that he has had some hand, however small, in the suc
cessful conclusion of negotiations.

LJAILE SELASSIE'S contribution to world affairs,
on the other hand, is something far more signifi
cant and vital, far more of a triumph, than mere ap
pearance at parades.
He has defeated Britain on her own ground, the
League of Nations, and in getting the League Council
to refuse recognition of the Italian conquest he has put
a sizeable stumbling-block in the way of successful
completion of the Anglo-Italian treaty, and at the same
time greatly increased his already sizeable nuisance
value.
He is fighting with ail the craft he possesses—and
that is no small amount—to save his country, or at
least seriously embarass its conqueror; and tempo
rarily, at least, he seems to be succeeding. If his eyes
look more and more bitter, more and more lavage in
their angry contempt, it is only because he realizes
that eventually, like some hunted beast, he will be
cornered, his plans at last brought to naught, his
country forever gone.
Ethiopia is conquered, now; the war which came
so close to tipping over the apple-cart of European
peace has long since been relegated to the category of
guerilla warfare and "colonial pacification." The tri
umph—magnificent though inconclusive—of sanctions
has gone by the board these two years and more in
favor of "sturm und drang" and the conquest by propa
ganda.
But the Emperors of Ethiopia go on as though noth
ing had happened, Victor Emmanuel with another title
after his name, appearing at parades and reviews with
his Duce; Haile Selassie hurrying around Europe like
a dark-visaged ghost of the chancellories, wasting time
and money in a hopeless attempt to regain his throne.

on in a world which has no further place for the
things they represent.—Allen Drury,

which he has stood like a wistfully grateful little
sparrow in the shadow of Europe's strong men.
And the pictures show that he has enjoyed it, even
if it has made him rather nervous. He gives an im
pression of hoping so much that his two friends will
get along well together; his very pose and expression
are conciliatory, as though he were about to say,
"Gentlemen, gentlemen!" in a tone of mild and de
precating reproach he also looks as though he could
never quite get up enough nerve to say it. Now that
Hitler has gone home to Berlin, he will probably re

LJAILE SELASSIE'S contribution to world affairs,
on the other hand, is something far more signifi
cant and vital, far more of a triumph, than mere ap
pearance at parades.
He has defeated Britain on her own ground, the
League of Nations, and in getting the League Council
to refuse recognition of the Italian conquest he has put
a sizeable stumbling-block in the way of successful
completion of the Anglo-Italian treaty, and at the same
time greatly increased his already sizeable nuisance
value.
He is fighting with ail the craft he possesses—and
that is no small amount—to save his country, or at
least seriously embarass its conqueror; and tempo
rarily, at least, he seems to be succeeding. If his eyes
look more and more bitter, more and more lavage in
their angry contempt, it is only because he realizes
that eventually, like some hunted beast, he will be
cornered, his plans at last brought to naught, his
country forever gone.
Ethiopia is conquered, now; the war which came
so close to tipping over the apple-cart of European
peace has long since been relegated to the category of
guerilla warfare and "colonial pacification." The tri
umph—magnificent though inconclusive—of sanctions
has gone by the board these two years and more in
favor of "sturm und drang" and the conquest by propa
ganda.
But the Emperors of Ethiopia go on as though noth
ing had happened, Victor Emmanuel with another title
after his name, appearing at parades and reviews with
his Duce; Haile Selassie hurrying around Europe like
a dark-visaged ghost of the chancellories, wasting time
and money in a hopeless attempt to regain his throne.
Two royal derelicts of the Fascist advance, they linger
on in a world which has no further place for the
things they represent.—Allen Drury,
forgotten men have been in the news together
for the past week, one in Rome, and one in Geneva;
more in the news than either has been since an omni
potent Italian Duce declared one of them out of a job
and proclaimed the other in.
One represents one of Europe's youngest royal
families, the House of Savoy; the other is an earnest
tribal chieftain who pulled himself up by his boot
straps and a little judicious murder to the leadership
of his country. Each is Emperor of Ethiopia.
Victor Emmanuel's prominence has come in con
nection with Adolf Hitler's visit to Rome. During the
week—too brief for a puppet monarch suddenly given
the spotlight—he has received more official recogni
tion, more attention from photographers, mor» courtesy
from his Prime Minister than at any time since the
close of the Ethiopian conflict.
Hitler's first act in Rome was to visit the King; and
the King has been on hand ever since, at this parade
and that review, posing for picture after picture in
which he has stood like a wistfully grateful little
sparrow in the shadow of Europe's strong men.
And the pictures show that he has enjoyed it, even
if it has made him rather nervous. He gives an im
