### 
Vt/lIEN loud and long applause Saturday night sig
naled the conclusion of the Speech and Drama
Division's second hit running, it also marked the close
of the first year of the Division's existence. With an
enlarged curriculum, expanded production schedule,
and Memorial Hall to play around in, the year may be
considered as one of experiment.
From the campus point of view, the Division has
shown itself capable of producing, at its worst, pretty
bad stuff, but at its best, excellent drama. From the
point of vie\V of the Division, several things should
have come out to point the way to future policy.
Not much can be done about choosing plays. Di
rectors must steer between satisfying the campus, and
answering their own purposes of production—training
acting and technical staffs. By actual count, this year's
successes far outnumbered ttfc flups, and that is about
as much as can be expected of any producing organ
ization.
The second problem which the Division must strug
gle with during the year is what to do with the enorm
ous Memorial Hall stage. The added work necessary
to prepare a show for the large hall often makes it
more trouble than it is worth. Hence, the use of the
Little Theater.
♦ * #
OROBABLY part of the Division's difficulty in hit
ting the jack-pot each time came from its large
production schedule. If completely different casts
j worked on each play, the short time necessary to pre
\ pare a show will be no burden on the actors. But when
! the casts finish one play only to start work immodiate
j ly on another, the necessary speed cannot help but
J have some effecl on the quality of the production. The
j Division will have to work its schedule out for itself.
I taking the scarcity of actors at Stanford into account.
1 From the outsider's viewport, a little less haste might
I add to the success of each production.
Yet taking everything into consideration, the Divi
| sion can point to a successful first, year. The few
hutches were more than balanced by the success of
, the last two productions. Little Theater shows, with
their long runs, proved a worth-while addition to the
i dramatic schedule.

rectors must steer between satisfying the campus, and
answering their own purposes of production—training
acting and technical staffs. By actual count, this year's
successes far outnumbered ttfc flups, and that is about
as much as can be expected of any producing organ
ization.
The second problem which the Division must strug
gle with during the year is what to do with the enorm
ous Memorial Hall stage. The added work necessary
to prepare a show for the large hall often makes it
more trouble than it is worth. Hence, the use of the
Little Theater.

OROBABLY part of the Division's difficulty in hit
ting the jack-pot each time came from its large
production schedule. If completely different casts
j worked on each play, the short time necessary to pre
\ pare a show will be no burden on the actors. But when
! the casts finish one play only to start work immodiate
j ly on another, the necessary speed cannot help but
J have some effecl on the quality of the production. The
j Division will have to work its schedule out for itself.
I taking the scarcity of actors at Stanford into account.
1 From the outsider's viewport, a little less haste might
I add to the success of each production.
Yet taking everything into consideration, the Divi
| sion can point to a successful first, year. The few
hutches were more than balanced by the success of
, the last two productions. Little Theater shows, with
their long runs, proved a worth-while addition to the
i dramatic schedule.
, In fact, the season augurs well for the prospect of
I the Division living up to us sumptuous housing.
