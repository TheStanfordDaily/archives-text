# Sky Thriller 'Test Pilot' Gets Okay
## 
### 
Realistic portrayal of characters
by Clark Gable, My rna Loy, and
Spencer Tracy, thrilling scenes of

(diving airplanes,
and a new twist
given to aviation
pictures makes
Metro - Goldwyn-
Mayer's "Test Pi
lot," now playing
at the Fox-Stan
ford, a splendid l
picture.
Of prime im
portance of the
above - mentioned

factors is the realistic acting of
Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and Spen
cer Tracy. Gable, as Jim Lane, a
plucky aviator who tests the break- |
ing point of airplanes, is grand.!
Rougher than most of the heart
throbbers, he is able to look hand- ,
some while getting his hair mussed
in some really exciting flying
scenes.
Myrna Loy, as his faithful wife
who fears for his safety yet knows |
no way to bring him down to earth, j
is all right throughout every part in i
the story except when she pours
forth, "With every tick of the clock, j
still living, still living, still living,
still living, still living." It sounds i
as false as the diamond in "Snow ,
White." Spencer Tracy, as the Gun
ner, a true pal who dies a tragic
death in the end, lives up to his
standard as an "Oscar" winner.
Best of the flying scenes is the
testing of an army pursuit plane by
Clark Gable. Screaming down from
above the clouds at maximum speed,
Clark succeeds in breaking the \
wings off, and, after an extremely
long wait, bails out with the speed
ometer. In the end he drives a
huge bomber down from 28,000 feet
alone and crashes the huge bird. He
comes out with a broken arm and a
face cut but the Gunner is killed. j
Pictures about the air mail, war in
the air, and navy flying have been |
made, but never one about test
piloting. After a lay-off from the i
production of aviation pictures,)
Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer presents
this epic of the clouds. Because of
this it should have much boxoffice i
popularity.
Having only one feature, the Fox- 1
Stanford gives an excellent "March !
of Time," a fair Donald Duck car- |
toon, and the regular newsreel. The
"March of Time" presents, in stark '
realization, the conditions in our
penal system and the political con
ditions in Austria since its annexa- 1
tion to Germany.—Perry.

this epic of the clouds. Because of
this it should have much boxoffice i
popularity.
Having only one feature, the Fox- 1
Stanford gives an excellent "March !
of Time," a fair Donald Duck car- |
toon, and the regular newsreel. The
"March of Time" presents, in stark '
realization, the conditions in our
penal system and the political con
ditions in Austria since its annexa- 1
tion to Germany.—Perry.


Thumbs Up
Realistic portrayal of characters
by Clark Gable, My rna Loy, and
Spencer Tracy, thrilling scenes of

(diving airplanes,
and a new twist
given to aviation
pictures makes
Metro - Goldwyn-
Mayer's "Test Pi
lot," now playing
at the Fox-Stan
ford, a splendid l
picture.
Of prime im
portance of the
above - mentioned

factors is the realistic acting of
Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, and Spen
cer Tracy. Gable, as Jim Lane, a
plucky aviator who tests the break- |
ing point of airplanes, is grand.!
Rougher than most of the heart
throbbers, he is able to look hand- ,
some while getting his hair mussed
in some really exciting flying
scenes.
Myrna Loy, as his faithful wife
who fears for his safety yet knows |
no way to bring him down to earth, j
is all right throughout every part in i
the story except when she pours
forth, "With every tick of the clock, j
still living, still living, still living,
still living, still living." It sounds i
as false as the diamond in "Snow ,
White." Spencer Tracy, as the Gun
ner, a true pal who dies a tragic
death in the end, lives up to his
standard as an "Oscar" winner.
Best of the flying scenes is the
testing of an army pursuit plane by
Clark Gable. Screaming down from
above the clouds at maximum speed,
Clark succeeds in breaking the \
wings off, and, after an extremely
long wait, bails out with the speed
ometer. In the end he drives a
huge bomber down from 28,000 feet
alone and crashes the huge bird. He
comes out with a broken arm and a
face cut but the Gunner is killed. j
Pictures about the air mail, war in
the air, and navy flying have been |
made, but never one about test
piloting. After a lay-off from the i
production of aviation pictures,)
