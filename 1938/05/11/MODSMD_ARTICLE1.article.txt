against Japanese invasion, three
powerful Japanese armies perpe
trated what was described by mili

Gradually impaling more than
200.000 Chinese soldiers 011 a great |
central China railway cross, the j

kow area and the Shantung prov

spread over a wide front along
the Yellow River to cut off Chi

Meanwhile, Haile Selassie's ru
mored flight to Geneva materialized
yesterday when the deposed Em
peror left London by train for
Geneva, planning to arrive there late
today. This blocked Great Britain's
plan to obtain speedy League of
Nations approval for recognition of
Italy's Ethiopian conquest, since the
League Council has postponed a
showdown on the question until
Selassie's arrival.'
In Berlin, Germany's No. 2 Nazi,
Field Marshal Goering, welcomed
Reiclifuehrer Adolf Hitler from
his state visit to Italy, from which
he bears new pledges considered
by the Nazi press as tantamount
to an unwritten military alliance.
Almost every newspaper stressed
that relations between the two
countries could not be closer than
they now are.
The Franco-Spanish frontier wit
nessed the Navarrese trap of nearly
12,000 Loyalists entrenched in the
fountain fastness along the main
road from Teruel to the Mediter
ranean seacoast, while border refu
