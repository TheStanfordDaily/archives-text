Paul Martin's band is to play. Dur
ing the evening, refreshments will
be served on the front lawn.
When asked what he thought
about the dance, Walt Stoessel, En
cina president, said, "This is really
going to be the big frosh dance of
the year. With the little price and
big moon it's a cinch to be a killer
diller."
Stoessel has appointed Bob Park
as chairman of the dance, and he is
making all arrangements. Dress
for the dance is formal, and bids at
50 cents a couple go on sale this
morning at the A.S.S.U.office.
