# The 						Daily Presents Stanford Women's Activities
## Women Active In Farm Life Since 1899 
### 
That women are a vital force in
the life of Stanford University is
proved by their participation in al
most all campus activities now.
Even as early as 1899 the Daily
reports a Girl's Glee Club, and a
Ladies Mandolin Club which per
formed for the street improvement
fund that year. The Y.W.C.A. was
in operation, Roble Club held a re
ception for the Cal Women, and
women served on the Sophomore
Cotillion Committee.
Eneina Open House
Social event of the season was an
open house in Encina when the Club
"put on its best bib and tucker" for
the occasion and for one evening
the women of the University ex
perimented with the billiard tables,
inspected the team's pictures, and
explored the boudoirs "to their
hearts' content."
By 1912 a Women's League was in
operation which welcomed the fresh
men into the University. With the
advent of more stable organization,
though, the women seemed to fall
into disrepute, for in an editorial in
the Daily, "queening" was held re
sponsible for the decline in men's
scholarship and the failure of ath
letes to turn out for sports.
Sponsors Inaugurated
In 1924, just a few years after
Dean Mary Yost came to occupy her
office in the Administration Build- i
ing, we hear of a permanent spon
sor system.
The group of six women pic- 1
Lured on this page illustrates cer- 1
tainly that since that time there has
been no slack in the activities of the
.vomen on the campus. During the
7 years that Dean Yost has served,
Ihe women have taken their places
is members of the student body.
They have inaugurated ideas, they
'lave pushed them through to a suc
cessful finish, and they have shared
ihem with the men of the Univer
sity.
Enter the Brunch
The May Brunch was originally
the property of the women as was
Peace Day, a Y.W.CA. activity.
Leadership Institute grew out of
Clearing House, a meeting of the
leaders in activities to discuss their
problems.
And these activities as well as the
sharing of ideas and responsibilities
are based on the belief that activi
ties are a democratic means for ob
taining democratic ends.
On this page, we have attempted
to delve into the history of the acti
vities, into their objectives and per
sonalities and perhaps a small pre
diction for the future. No longer are
women ornaments or blotsâ€”the fol
lowing paragraphs should prove
that:
