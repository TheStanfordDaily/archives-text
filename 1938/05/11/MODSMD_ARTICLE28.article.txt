# Conference
## 
### 
Launched in its present form four
years ago to take over the legisla
tive functions of the Associated
Women Students, Women's Confer
ence is now the supreme authority
in feminine affairs at Stanford. It
Handles the making of rules and
regulations for all campus activities
in which women are especially con
cerned.
According to Cynthia Coonley,
present chairman, Conference exists
"to promote the happiness and well
being of every woman at Stanford."
In addition to its purely legislative
functions, it awards one scholarship
for women each year, chooses the
sponsors for Roble, Union, and La
gunita, and has this year sponsored
the first annual Conference Fashion
Show.
The membership consists of the'
chairman, vice-chairman, secretary,
and treasurer of Conference, and
the president of each sorority and
campus living group. The vice
president of the Associated Stu
dents, the presidents of Pan-Hellenic
and the Y.W.C.A., the chairman of
Women's Council, and the Women's
Editor of the Daily are ex-officio
members.
