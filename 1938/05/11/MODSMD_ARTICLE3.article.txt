# Males Barred As Women Edit Daily
## 
### 
This is the Women's Edition of
The Dailyâ€”an annual occur
rance.
Women, and women alone,
have done all the news-gather
ing, writing, copyreading, editing,
reviewing, and commenting in
this issue, from intramural sports
to Bull Session.
One Stanford gentleman en
tered The Daily shack and paid
Ihe imposed fine of 10 cents. All
other Stanford roughs gave their
messages through the window,
thereby avoiding payment of the
fine.
