# Y. W. C. A.
## 
### 
As old as the University itself, the
Y.W.C.A. was founded in 1891 by a
group of students in the first class.
When national charters were re
leased in 190G, the Stanford "Y" be
came one of the first charter mem
bers of the "National Student Y.W.
C.A.
Today the Stanford "Y" has 450
student members. Its official status
is that of an independent organiza
tion, unaffiliated with the Univer
sity. There is, however, an unoffi
cial connection with the Administra
tion through Dean Mary Yost, a
member of the Advisory Board.
Major responsibility for economic
maintenance? of the "Y" rests with
the Advisory Board, a group of
Palo Alto women and faculty mem
bers. The Student Finance Drive,
headed next year by Virginia Claus
en, supplements the bulk of the bud
get supplied by the Board.
Next year's president is Mary
Kay Horton, who will succeed Jack
ie Brown. Other officers are: Vir
ginia Sterry, vice-president; Bar
bara Templeton, secretary; Olive
Freeman, treasurer; Angela Gates,
national representative; Wilma Ba
wer, personal philosophy; Gerry
Clift, activities, and Gene Glasmann,
public affairs.
"Y" activities include freshmen
discussions, personal problems, Wal
rus Club, youth hostels, social serv
ice, Christmas pageant, and Straw
berry Brunch.
A number of campus institutions
which the "Y" has begun are Peace
Day, group meeting A.S.S.U. Com
mittee on International Relations,
istudent-faculty relations, Klahoya
Club, and in cooperation with Dean
Yost, the social service and marriage
relations courses.
