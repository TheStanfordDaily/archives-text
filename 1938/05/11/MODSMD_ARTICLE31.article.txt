Organized a few years ago to as
sist women in their choice of a voca
tion, the Vocational Guidance Com

rnittee this year has fulfilled its pur
pose through presentation of lec
tures by authorities in various fields,
followed by group discussion.
Throughout the year, the commit
tee sponsored a series of seven meet
ings which brought to the campus
prominent workers in nursing, mer
chandising, radio, civil service, so
cial service, deaning, and commer
cial art.
Members of the committee are
selected each year by the outgoing

Conference and the Dean of Wom

This year's group was headed by
Georgia Pettibone and advised by
Assistant Dean of Women Ellen
Tutton. Members were Kathleen
McMurtry, secretary, Lee Lewis,
treasurer, Sally Harwood, Janice
Mclntyre, Gretchen Reinemund,
Marjorie Segerstrom, Ann Stewart,
and Elizabeth Verheyen.
