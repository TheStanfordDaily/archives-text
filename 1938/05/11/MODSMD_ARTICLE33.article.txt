# Dramatics
## 
### 
Potential Farm Bernhardts and
Duses were given an even greater
opportunity to develop their talents
with the formation of the Division of
Speech and Drama this year.
Presented with a new theater
which gave them fine equipment
with which to work, and ample
dressing room space—a real boon
after the cramped quarters of the
Assembly Hall—not to mention cos
tume, make-up and stage-craft
facilities, the women lost no time in
building up all phases of dramatics.
Work under Directors Thomas
Wood Stevens, Gordon C. Lange,
and H. Miles Heberer has brought
forth such talented actresses as Kay
Campbell, Fran Farmer, Melba Rae
Toombs. Gerry Schreiber, Phyllis
Lakin, Shirley Jones, Jane Clary,
Kay Kalenborn and many others.
Costume design has taken an im
portant place in the theater under
the direction of Mrs. Helen Green,
and Stanford women now make al
most all the costumes worn in Farm
productions.
Stage-craft and design is a rela

tively new field for women—facili
ties in the Assembly Hall were not
exactly conducive to participation in
such activity—but now women de
sign and help construct sets under
the able direction of Waldemar Jo
hansen.
