IN THE height of (he track season,
with figures having to do with
jumps both high and broad flooding
the 8.A.C., the Liebendorfer pub
licity office is practically floating in
ideas for football posters. Don is
considering program covers and
ticket designs. He goes around as
suring people that they have only
170 days left to buy their programs!
Meanwhile life at the B.A.C.
proceeds to survey Dink Temple
ton's activities since 1921 when he
lirst came to the coaching position.
Dink himself made neat-looking
marks in hotli track and football.
Many know him as the greatest
kicker of Pacific • Coast history,
most of which was in rugby.
(America chucked football for a
time, you know. From 19(16 to
1918 Stanford along with other
colleges played its intercollegiate
sports in knee pants and sox. In
MM!) we went back to football).
Story has it that Dink loved track,
but best of all he loved the high
jump. In 1920 he went East to try
out for the Olympics, doped by
sports writers everywhere as a
cinch to make it, and very happy
about the whole situation. But
Dink made a mistake. He made use
of the Western roll in clearing the
bar, an accepted and much used
method now, but then looked upon
as an innovation. He was ruled out
on account of the officials' objection
to his head going over before his
feet.
One visions a broken-hearted
Dink walking sadly to the dressing
rooms. On his way he had to pass
(lie broad jump pit. Suddenly he
stopped, gave the thing the once
over. Muttering something about
liking the broad-jump, too, he took
one crack al it. One leap was all
he needed. He qualified for the
American Olympic team!
/ kUT of Dink's 18 years Stanford
has fared pretty well in dual
meets against its two greatest rivals,
Cal and U.S.C. From Cal we've
taken 13 wins, lost 4, and tied 1.
When we've met the boys from Troy
more than once in one year the re
sults have been like this: won 12,
lost 10.
Twelve of Dink's boys have hit
the American Olympics. In 1932
the Indian tribe scored 29V2 points,
more than was scored by any other
one university for that series. One
was Bill Miller, who set an Olympic
pole vault record of 14 feet 1 7/8
inches. Also once there was John
Lyman who was the first man to
ever put the shot a distance of 54
feet.
In 1937 a new world's l'ecord for
the half-mile relay was set by Dink's
boys at Fresno. The question is
will it be broken at the meet down
in the hot country?
Under that deluge of track re
ports the B.A.C. came to the top
with another out-of-season report:
The twice-postponed meeting to take
up the question of who is and who
isn't to be next year's basketball
coach is actually coming off tonight.
"It may be decided and then again
it may not," Liebendorfer says, and
that's maybe if perhaps probably
they might on a chance decide some
thing! Ho, hum.—Mike Drury.
