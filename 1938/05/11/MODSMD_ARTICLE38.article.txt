# Women Fliers' Future Bright, Says Aviatrix
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
That flying will eventually be a J
field as open to women as any other
is the opinion of Marian Jackson, 1
campus aviatrix, one of seven wom
en members of the Stanford Flying j
Club.
"Right now women flyers are re
garded somewhat like women doc- j
tors," she says. "The public doesn't
quite trust them. I think it's mostly
because people just haven't been
educated to them."
Miss Jackson, who has held a
pilot's license since 1936, transferred
here as a sophomore this year from i
Stephens College. Enthusiastic over 1
Stanford, she states it is "just what |
I was looking for."
Her home-town is Cleveland, she
explained, and although there was
no flying club at Stephens, her in- i
terest in flying was originally stimu
lated by the National Air Races,
which are held in Cleveland.
Miss Jackson intends to enter
aviation either as an instructor or
as the pilot of a private plane.
She further outlined the attitude
towards women in aviation with a
side-light on women's flying clothes.
"Men around the flying fields have
the reputation of being extra criti-

cal about the women's clothes," she
laughed. "They have a tendency to
think of women learning to fly as a
joke. If you wear riding clothes
they're sure to ask 'Where's the
horse?' "
Slacks or regular skirts are usual
ly worn by the women, she said.
Skirts are inconvenient in some
types of planes, where the control
stick comes up between the pilot's
knees. Regulation flying clothes are
only for cold weather, extra high
altitudes, or open cockpits, she de
clared, as they add a good deal of
warmth.
The young aviatrix, who thinks
stunting is "fun," sees no reason
why women flyers should be con
sidered inferior to men in nerves,
skill, or practically any qualities
except "in individual cases, per
haps," endurance. But she thinks
in the case of men and women alike
that those who will go into the fly
ing profession will be the ones who
are fitted for it.
Miss Jackson, whose interests take
in many more things than flying,
professes a taste for athletics, music
(she used to play the flute), reading,
and "pretty nearly anything."
