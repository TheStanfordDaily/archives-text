### KAY JOHNSEN 
Lloyd Leith and Ernie Bailly,
regular Conference game officials,
will donate their service at the Con
valescent Home Drive game — the
last competitive performance of
"Hank" Luisetti—tomorrow night at
8 o'clock in the Pavilion, according
to Don Liebendorfer.
Tickets are on sale at the A. S.
S. U. offices for 50 cents. Sales at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon amount
ed to $68, every cent of which will
go to the Home Fund. Tax exemp
tion on the benefit tickets has been
obtained from Washington.
Upstarts Meet Team
The Upstarts who are this year's
varsity squad, and will be next
year's hoop team will meet the
Five Old Men who have won three
successive Pacific Coast champion
ships and are graduating in June.
"If the Laughing Boys should j
win—and they have had much more
experience, and are taller—l .still say
that there are swell kids on the
other team. In fact, Burness and
Davidson are the finest freshman
prospects since Luisetti," remarked
Liebendorfer.
According to Luisetti, the Old Men
will practice only twice before the
game, while the Upstarts have been
practicing right along.
"The team," Luisetti remarked,
"looks forward to giving the kids a
terrific beating, anyway."
Favoring the next year's team are
Mentors Bunn and Goiter, who
have been literally scrimmaging the
shoes from the feet of their pro
teges. They have the advantage of
numbers and their hope lies in run
ning the Five Old Men—as they dub
them — off their feet by strategic
line-ups which az - e a secret.
Refusing to release The Upstarts'
opening quintet, Mentors Bunn and
Gorter commented:
Upstart Line-up Withered
"We've not going to give those
guys anything to work on."
On the team are Luisetti and Lee
(forwards), Stoeffen (center), Cal
derwood and Health (guards), and
Huff (substitute)—making the sixth
"Old Man." Captain Phil Zonne, in
the hospital with pneumonia, will
not play.
On the varsity squad are Huddle
son, Lafaille, Marshall, Williams
(forwards); Burness, Anderson, But
ler (centers), Davidson, Barnett,
Lyon, Rapp, Rahn.
No Ticket Limit
Acording to a statement made last
night by H. B. Lee there is no lim
it on the number of tickets which
one person may buy, and student
body cards need not be presented
for admission.
"Students should buy their tick
ets beforehand at the A.S.S.U. of
lice," Lee said, "as there will prob
ably be a large outside crowd, and
everybody may not be able to
get in.'
Starting line-ups will be pub
lished in tomorrow's Daily.
