# The 						Women's Angle
## 
### 
THIS is the women's edition.
Traditionally it is met with guffaws from
the men on the staff.
Traditionally, likewise, the women's editor
harpoons with a hat-pin one of three estab
lished topics: the lack of business training for
women; the late leave system; and what dogs
the Stanford men are getting to be.
This year we will bye the business; it lacks
savor. Advocating unlimited late-leaves for
seniors would arouse irate parents to make it
known that college seniors are as infants still
and unable to find their way home past ten
o'clock more than three nights a week.
Come we to the men. Well, we have no
grievance there, either. In fact, we consid
ered writing an open letter to Hank Luisetti,
but this is too conspicuous a place for corre
spondence other than letters received from
breast-beating Campus Opinioners.
Anyway, we've tried to make this issue re
flect something of the women's angle with
out going too contrary to the usual. Up on
the front page somewhere, you'll find pictures
of two women who are going through college
as leaders, as well as a story about our most
distinguished alumnae, to whom we bow.
Page two should illuminate some campus
activities, and if you get to the sports page,
you'll find out how a woman pinned Lieben
dorfer in a corner and got the cold dope on
Dink.
Immediately below you will find an off
season observation on the sorority system, plus
what a famous woman in the theater has to
say about dramatics.
We've tried hard and if the sports lack their
usual male vigor it must be remembered that
women see only the "ducky red pants on the
polo players" andâ€”well, that's the woman's
angle.
