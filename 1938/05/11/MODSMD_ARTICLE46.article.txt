# Round Two

### 
SINCE time has no doubt healed the broken
hearts among the Robleites who were not
pledged in the recent Hall-Row debacle, the
subject of sororities may be dealt with reason
ably, without rush-period hysteria or deep
emotion.
Sororities were originated with a definite idea
in mind. They were to provide all the women
students congenial living quarters, congenial
companions, and a bond of unity through
which they might work for the betterment of
their Alma Mater. Simple arithmetic will dem
onstrate the impossibility of getting 1100 wom
en into nine houses which accommodate an
average of 30.
Arguments are advanced in defense of the
sororities: They afford attractive, home-like
places to live. The older women contribute
much to the social development of their young
er sisters. Attention is paid to the matter of
Bawlout averages.
But—what of the extremely dubious method
it is necessary to use in the selection of pros
pective pledges, a plan which leaves much to
chance? What of the selecting of one woman
from a group of friends, leaving the others?
What of the fact that some women attach to
themselves the over-importance which sorori
ties hold for them?
What, more particularly, of the ideal behind
Ihe founding of sororities? That women shall
live in small groups, learn to adjust, learn
co-operation, learn to give precedence to the
common good? Factional considerations have
usurped much of that common good to the
detriment of the remainder of the University.
The Halls, being in essence more democratic,
could create within themselves an organization
which would over-shadow the Row, and in tim*
give thinking Row women good reason for
making changes in their system.
But, they wail, what to do about the alumnae?
They subscribe their money, their daughters,
and their support to the houses. How can they

be persuaded that college has changed since
they were part of a much more sentimental
generation? The present generation has as
many loves as the old, but along with the
water that has run under the bridge since 1925
or so has departed the "rah-rah" type of col
lege spirit, the type so neatly satirized by Hol
lywood.
The Row women, if free to make up their
minds without outside pressure, could possibly
come around to the view that the present sys
tem is inconsistent with Stanford ideals, and,
by so being, must be changed.
There is remarkable democracy in the ma
jority of Stanford women, but sororities deny
this even while their members apply it. Se
lection of women on short and only-social ac
quaintance is an uncertain means of choosing
women who have to live together in true
sororal amity. That it works as well as it does
is one of the miracles of the modern genera
tion.
Pledging is farthest from the minds of most
women on the campus, and that is perhaps
the besf reason for bringing it up, perhaps a
better time to consider what is to be done be
fore the inevitable period again arrives, like
the swallows at San Juan mission, to depart
with nothing more than emotion and petty
bickering and quarreling to mark its passing
through the hair of the unselected ones—on
the winds of freedom.—L. A.
