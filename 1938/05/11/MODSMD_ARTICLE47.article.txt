# BULL SESSION
## FACULTY-STUDENT RELATIONS 
### 
A FTER three years of watching men write Bull Ses
sion and thinking how much better a woman could
do it, here we are. The trouble is, it's like picking a
hat—there's too much selection. Faced with the chance
of a lifetime it's hard to choose among kicking about
the Cellar food, 3121, and student-faculty relations.
Having given up Cellar food after the last attack of
ptoihaine poisoning, and 3121 after sleeping from 9
o'clock one night through my 8 o'clock the next morn
ing, waiting for someone to answer the phone (and
consequently doubting the existence of that mythical
number), I'm stuck with student-faculty relations.
To vary the old theme a little, this is going to be on
faculty-student relations. For, with the advent of the
Eastern influence, student-faculty relations on the
Farm have definitely improved. There have been bull
sessions in the Nitery and week-ends at Yosemite, and
Axe Society's field day, not to mention weed-pulling.
The students, feeling that the atmosphere was a little
frigid, got in there and pitched.
Faculty-student relations, however, still seem to be
struggling along in the old post-Jordan slump. In
fact, they have almost ceased to struggle. If the stu
dents want to beard their mentors in their musty dens,
that's all right with the faculty, but they aren't going
to come out without a little coaxing.

'"PHIS isn't intended for those of the faculty who re
alize that students are something besides a lot of
Monday-morning yawns. There is, for example, a
history professor who brought the at-home habit here
from Harvard, and is frequently embari'assed when
midnight comes around and his visitors seem to have
forgotten how to tell time. He and a few other rare
souls seem to have grasped the good old fact, which
the dons discovered at Oxford or Heidelberg or some
where, that it's easier and pleasanter for all concerned
to form a young mind over a cup of tea than over a
dusty desk.
Granted it's a little harder on the faculty to have
to associate with the students than vice versa. The
great minds behind the little cards, "Office Hours,
MWFII," will generally come down to the level of
Phi Betes and grads, but they don't get much kick out
of conversing with the run-of-the-mill, 90 plus 0 stu
dent. Of course the student might do a little better
than 90 plus 0 if a professor cared to wake him up.
The professors will tell you that they've tried to
know the students better and haven't gotten very far.
But when some of their colleagues have to brush the
same students off their doorsteps, we can suspect that
they haven't tried very hard. Teaching entails a little
more than just instructing. Let's have some faculty
student relations.—Phyllis White.
