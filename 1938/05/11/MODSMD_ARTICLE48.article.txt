U'OR that considerable clique of Stanford women who
have passed their four years here with one eye on
Garver and Hansen and the other on the casting
notices, I sounded Margo about professional prospects
during her recent stopover in the City. Her comment
would have daunted a Duse.
"Don't," she entreated, "even try to crash the stage
unless you cannot live without acting."
Now, the little Miriamne of "Winterset" is not one
of these exotic fakes from the faraway shores of Man
hattan Island. Nor does she languish in mink to let
you know how she has bled for her "awt." Margo is
in dead earnest and frankly a little tired.
"The breaks count for little," she said, "only once
in a while docs one get a good break. I myself simply
began as a dancer until one thing led to another. You
will have to face discouragement on every hand. And
if by hard work you do climb to a place of importance,
you will often have to go on or act in front of the
cameras when you're tired and even very ill. What
most ambitious girls fail to realize is that the theater is
not as the public sees it—all beautiful clothes and a
name in lights."

Margo concedes that if a girl is willing
to dun Fame long enough and hard enough, prev
ious training gives her an edge.
"In the first place, we are all convinced of our
flawless diction. As a matter of fact, very few of us
speak well. You may learn a great deal in this im
portant respect from a good teacher. Then, summer
stock, school plays—any experience on a stane in front
of an audience is a great advantage. I got my first
job through the school where I studied."
"But in any case you will have to wrangle for a
professional opportunity. And once successful, you
will have to pay in hard work and repeated set-backs.
No. do not go on the stage unless you cannot live with
out acting."
It looks very much as if Stanford actresses \\jill have
