# Tunes Good, Vehicle Fair, Eddy Awful
## 
### 
Saccharine romance, dripping arti
ficiality, achieved by the efforts of
swaggering Mac Donald and stuffed-

uniform - Eddy
in "Girl of
the Golden West"
does its best to
cover a fair ve
hicle and some
fine Romberg
|tun e s with an
icing of medioc
rity.
All the best
shots and songs
go to Miss Mac-
Donald who real-

ly reaches the peak in contortion
less, ear-soothing melody, thorough
ly Hollywood in manner. Her ren
ditions of the epic "Ave Maria" and
"Liebestraum" rise to tear-jerking
proportions.
As is usual, Mr. Eddy comes
prancing in on his usual horse at
the head of the usual band of men
—bandits this time—singing his
usual marching song. In the role
of the youthful, revenge-seeking
bandit, Ramirez, who strings up
dozens of men, robs poor old pros
pectors, and finally, through the
love of a true-blue girl saloon
keeper, reforms his evil ways, he's
unconvincing, characterless, and
willy-nilly.
Miss Macdonald's portrayal of y
western gal brought up in a mining
camp, exaggerates beyond normal
possibilities the western drawl and
the blustering awkward manner,
verging on caricature.
Walter Pidgeon turns in a fine,
stock characterization as the steely,
gambler sheriff with the heart of
gold, turning our sympathy in his
direction.
The scene in which Miss Mac-
Donald and Pidgeon gamble for the
life of the wounded Eddy remains
one of the best in the picture. We
suspect that this is due to the fact
that Mr. Eddy is temporarily inert,
at their feet.
The movie represents much ef
fort wasted on the part of Director
Robert Z. Leonard to revive in mod
ern guise David Belascoe's good,
old-fashioned melodrama.—Hiler.
Extreme cold is capable of caus
ing tin to crumble to dust.
