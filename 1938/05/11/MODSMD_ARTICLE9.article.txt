# Cardinals To Pick New Rally Heads
## 
### 
At a meeting of Cardinals tonight,
new chairmen of both Men's and
Women's Rally Committees will be
selected, and the final business of
the Convalescent Home Drive will
be finished.
The Cardinals will hold their
meeting at 7:30 o'clock tonight in
Room 13 of the Old Union. Bud
Milligan will give a general review
of the results of the drive, and Jan
North will report on the results of
the Masque Ball. Dave Ryus will
report on Labor Day.
The conflict between Axe Society
and Cardinals will also be discussed,
Mark Hopkins said yesterday.
