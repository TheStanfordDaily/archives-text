£T WAS more than the ordinary
comic-opera "palace revolution,"
traditionally associated with Latin
American political upheavals, which
broke out yesterday in Rio de Jane
iro, Brazil.
Shortly after "security tribunals"
had released army and civilian lead
ers arrested a month ago in connec
tion with a plot to overthrow the
six-months-old government of Pres
ident Getulio Vargas, an attempted
putsch broke out under the direction
of the recently outlawed Integeral
istas, green shirt-wearing Brazilian
Fascist movement.
Before the revolt was sup
pressed, according to government
claims, insurgent soldiers had
surrounded the presidential pal
ace, provoked a revolt among the
palace guard, and seized radio
stations. Government troops sur
rounded the rebel stronghold in
the marine ministry, and reported
ly restored complete control in the
city after several hours of street
fighting.

In an exclusive interview with
