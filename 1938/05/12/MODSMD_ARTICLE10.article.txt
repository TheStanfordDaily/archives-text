# May Chaparral Out Tomorrow
## New Secret Feature Offered as Surprise 
### 
A surprise feature, the nature of
which will not be disclosed until the
Chappie makes its May appearance
tomorrow, is slated to give campus
readers the longest and loudest
laughs this quarter, if the enthus
iastic statement made by "Old Boy"
Hartmann yesterday holds effect.
Edited this .month by Assistant
Editor Tom Fleming, the issue will
have as a theme, travel, from the
cover drawn by Curt Barnes, to the
very last page of jokes. Feature
story of the month is by Art Levin
son.
The monthly column, "Inside
Dopes," will bare the life history of
"Sis McGonigle," telling her past,
present, and giving an insight into
her future. "Sis" provides a best
seller of her own on "How to Get
Boats and Influence People."
A group of special contributions by
Dick Dawson, art editor in '36, leads
the list of art contributions, while
Jack Dixon, Bob Gillespie, and
Doris Tucker lend able assistance.
The photography section will be one
of the best in recent issues, playing
up the theme of travel.
