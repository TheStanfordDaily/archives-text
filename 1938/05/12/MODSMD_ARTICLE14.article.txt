# 'Upstarts,' Hank's Team Play Tonight
## 'Five Old Men' Play Last Game at Farm; Funds Go for Drive 
### 
Stanford's last chance to see its
j contribution to that select field of
I all-time basketball supermen, An
gelo Henry Luisetti, comes tonight
| at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion.
The occasion is an extra-curricu
j lar game, proceeds of which—at 50
j cents a head—go to the Convalescent
j Home.
Captain Hank will lead "The Five
Old Men" against "The Upstarts."
The former quintet is composed of
i graduating members of the Card
; basketball team, while the opposing
| five will be chosen from those hoop
! sters who will be back for more com
petition next season.
Bunn, Gorter Coach
Coached by John Bunn and Wytze
Gorter, "The Upstarts" will field a
! starting five of Leon Lafaille and
I Darrell Huddleson at forwards, Don
1 Burness at center, and Ken David
j son and Dick Lyon, guards.

"Tb"! Five Old Men" will be Lui
setti, Art Stoefen, Jack Calderwood,
Beebs Lee, and Nellie Heath. Sixth
ancient is Dale Huff, who is to be
remembered as varsity scout and
diplomat plenipotentiary, as well as
substitute freshman mentor two
years ago when Gorter became ill.
Too Much Practice
A rising note of complaint has
been heard from the bearded fel
lows. They claim that Bunn and
Gorter and their "Upstarts" have
been practicing too much, have
hogged the court all and every aft
ernoon.
To prove their point, they took the
floor in a little scrimmage the other
day against some of their opponents,
who were aided no little by Bunn.
But they lost the argument by win
ning the scrimmage, to the surprise
of everyone.
Messrs. Bunn and Gorter refused
to release their quintet's starting
line-up until late last night, believ
ing strategy to be the best move.
Money Goes to Drive
"There's dynamite in them thar
names, whispered Bunn, "We're
going to give those guys the fight of
their lengthy lives. They'll regret
calling my gang 'The Upstarts.'"
Another point of strategy to be
used by the latter team will be, most
likely, rapid substitution. "The Five
Old Men" have only one sub bandy,
and age will not help their condition.
At any rate, the game is a natural
from way back. What's more, it'll
make the kids out at the Home
happy. And that ought to be enough
for anybody's four bits.

substitute freshman mentor two
years ago when Gorter became ill.
Too Much Practice
A rising note of complaint has
been heard from the bearded fel
lows. They claim that Bunn and
Gorter and their "Upstarts" have
been practicing too much, have
hogged the court all and every aft
ernoon.
To prove their point, they took the
floor in a little scrimmage the other
day against some of their opponents,
who were aided no little by Bunn.
But they lost the argument by win
ning the scrimmage, to the surprise
of everyone.
Messrs. Bunn and Gorter refused
to release their quintet's starting
line-up until late last night, believ
ing strategy to be the best move.
Money Goes to Drive
"There's dynamite in them thar
names, whispered Bunn, "We're
going to give those guys the fight of
their lengthy lives. They'll regret
calling my gang 'The Upstarts.'"
Another point of strategy to be
used by the latter team will be, most
likely, rapid substitution. "The Five
Old Men" have only one sub bandy,
and age will not help their condition.
At any rate, the game is a natural
from way back. What's more, it'll
make the kids out at the Home
happy. And that ought to be enough
for anybody's four bits.
Stanford's last chance to see its
j contribution to that select field of
I all-time basketball supermen, An
gelo Henry Luisetti, comes tonight
| at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion.
The occasion is an extra-curricu
j lar game, proceeds of which—at 50
j cents a head—go to the Convalescent
j Home.
Captain Hank will lead "The Five
Old Men" against "The Upstarts."
The former quintet is composed of
i graduating members of the Card
; basketball team, while the opposing
| five will be chosen from those hoop
! sters who will be back for more com
petition next season.
