# Cantata Lacks Action, Plot
## Echo Song, Prayer Number Outstanding 
### 
Lacking in action and plot, "Love
in a Coffee Pot" presented last
night, represented an appreciable
effort on the .part of the combined
Stanford Glee Clubs to produce a
difficult, classical work obviously
intended for concert performance.
The incessant repetitions of the
words of the songs might pass at a
church oratorio, but for a comic
cantata they only served to slow the
show down to a snail's pace.
Trying its best to fill in the voids,
orchestral interims and long coun
trapuntal passages, the cast made a
noble attempt to effect a somewhat
stilted pantomime which somehow
lacked punch.
Audis Davis as the sly, recalci
trant daughter, in a part that could
stand a lot of overdoing without a
loss of snap, overdid her coyness
and coffee drinking to the point of
monotony.
Jim Barnum as the irate papa, put
ting more sparkle into his role than
Miss Davis, nevertheless failed to
reach the heights of hilarity and
quality of voice that marked his in
terpretation of the Judge in "Trial
by Jury."
Tenor George Knowles was more
natural as the village playwright.
Preceding the Cantata, the "Echo
Song" sung by the combined Glee
Clubs under the direction of H.
Miles Heberer was admirably timed
with the back-stage echo to the split
second.
Smooth blending of voices and
melodious quality made "Prayer"
sung by the Women's Glee Club and
directed by Raymond Kendall by
far the best number on the pro
gram.
