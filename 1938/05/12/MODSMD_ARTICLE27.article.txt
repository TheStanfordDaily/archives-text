### MARY JUNE MONTGOMERY 
The Stanford Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was organized November 1,
1904 by 11 members of the faculty who had been elected to the organiza
tion elsewhere. Professors William A. Cooper, Orrin Leslie Elliot, and Dr.
Clyde A. Duniway, the three surviving members of this group, are now
retired and living on the campus.

> After this group of men petitioned j
for a charter, an inspecticn was i
made of the quality of work d. e at
Stanford to see if it was worthy of i
being recognized. In the report of i
this inspection such things as the j
library, the endowment and the !
qualifications of the faculty were !
considered. The national Phi Beta |
Kappa Senate then passed the peli- |
tion on to the General Council of j
the United Chapters which meets |
every three years and in this way I
the charter was granted.
The local chapter is the Beta
chapter of California and its pur
pose, in accordance with the nation
al, is to promote scholarship and j
friendship among students and grad- :
uates of universities. They further
scholarship by recognizing it.
According to the constitution, not j
more than 10 per cent of any class |
may be elected, and now the aver- j
age runs around 75 new members'
elected twice a year. The minimum i
requirements are 1(50 hours and a
"B" average by persons of satisfac
tory character and outstanding
scholarship along cultural and lib
eral lines.
There are at present 157G living
members of the Stanford chapter,
of whom those connected with the
University as faculty or graduate
students are considered active mem
bers.
The present officers of the chap
ter are Prof. Thomas M. Barclay,
president; C. H. Danforth, first vice- |
president; Miss Edith Mirrielees, '
second vice-president;. Dr. J. Pearce I
Mitchell, secretary; and Dr. Karl M. j
Cowdery, treasurer.
