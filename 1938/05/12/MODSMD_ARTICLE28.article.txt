# Peace Course Plans Definite
## Dr. Stuart To Give Subject Next Year 
### 
International Organization for
Peace definitely will be a part of the
Stanford curriculum next year. Dr.
Graham Stuart, professor of political
science, announced yesterday.
The new course, which probably
will be given winter quarter, is de
signed to meet the requests for a
study of the factors influencing war
and peace. Dr. Stuart will organize
and conduct it.
The tentative syllabus which he
will submit to President Ray Lyman
Wilbur includes consideration of the
causes of war, efforts for peace, the
present international situation, and
the possibility of peaceful change.
The course will also cover non
political means of international co
operation, and existing organiza
tions designed to promote peace.
Main object of the course, accord
ing to Dr. Stuart, is to integrate and
synthesize the material now offered
by several different departments.
Although it will be under the poli
tical science department, the study
will include subjects usually re
served for other fields.
No attempt will be made to arouse
emotional appeal, Dr. Stuart said.
