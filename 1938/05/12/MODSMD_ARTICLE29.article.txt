# Chaparral Staff Has 33 Women Members
## 
### CORENA CRASE 
That type is nol made of rubber was discovered by the women on
Chaparral staff yesterday morning when lack of space forced 151 of the
Chappie women out of the paper entirely leaving room for only two.
Truth of the matter is that the campus humor magazine has been rapid
ly expanding and coming to the fore as a major activity for women.

Right now there are 33 women *
members of the staff. This includes
office workers, writers, artists, and
salesgirls, traditionally known for
their beauty.
Women's Staff Expands
More women than ever before are
working on the editorial side of the
magazine. Chief among these are |
Pat Bosqui, creator of the tintypes
which have been used for nearly
two years; Doris Tucker, who does
many of the drawings; and Betty
McGlashan, "Sister McGonigle" on
the by-line end of a story.
On the business side are Beryl j
Randall, women's manager, and
Eunice Emry, office manager.
Women working on the editorial
staff have a chance to rise to the
position of art editor, as well as hon
orary members of Hammer and Cof
fin for their outstanding literary or
art work. The women's manager
ship is a salaried position.
Women's Auxiliary
Such an enlargement of the wom
en's staff has resulted in the forma
tion of a Women's Auxiliary for
Hammer and Coffin Society as the
women on the Pelican staff have at j
Cal.
Women elected to membership in
clude Angela Gates, Pat Bosqui,
Elaine Stone, Doris Tucker, Phyllis
Bitzing, Betty McGlashan, Jean
Thompson, Geraldine Clift, Jean
Tillotson, Eunice Emry, and Beryl
Randall. Honorary members of
Hammer and Coffin automatically
become members.
