# Leadership Group Hears Robinson
## Professor Outlines Democratic Living For Student Leaders 
### JIM STONE 
"This precious, brittle thing we
call Stanford life is in your hands,"
Professor Edgar E. Robinson told 125
student leaders last night at the first
meeting of the Stanford Leadership
Institute.
Presided over-by Cynthia Coonlcy,
the meeting was the first of three
planned for the Institute by the
Committee on Student Leadership.
Short discussion followed the speech
by Professor Robinson as he set
the key-note for the meetings to
follow.
Active Democracy
"Democracy is a way of life, to
be followed constantly, not only be
fore Commencement or Election
Day," he said. "If we are going to
have democracy at Stanford, we must
do something about it."
Three things, he felt, are demand
ed of Stanford student government,
"responsibility, good taste, and fair
ness." Unless these three are found
in leaders and their followers, dem
ocracy will fail, in his opinion.
He emphasized the place of the
followers in democracy, saying that
"If nothing else, an elevated public
should be the one thing to come
from Stanford living democracy." An
intelligent public to follow govern
mental procedure must be assumed
for the success of our democracy, he
felt.
Lists Principles
Professor Robinson pointed out
that a distinction must be made be
tween politics and government. Self
government, he defined, involves set
ting up a system to settle all ques
tions which really count in a grow
ing community.
To do this, he listed three prin
ciples which he considered more
important than practicality in living
democracy. The first is the ability
and desire to face problems with
thoughts of the future as well as
the immediate situation. Members
of Stanford's democracy must ask,
"What kind of a place do I want
Stanford to be?" he said.
Second important principle of
democracy, as he sees it, is the ne
cessity for followers to examine
every proposal and every leader
critically, and intelligently.
Discussion Follows
Third tenet which he advanced
was the need for members of a self
governing community to believe in
the possibility of living according to
science, truth, or God—all objects of
the faith which he believes is the
foundation of democratic prin
ciples. ,
But, on the whole, he felt, "It all
goes back to the individual."
In the discussion which followed,
Dean of Women Mary Yost added
that student leaders and members of
Stanford's democracy should not
only know the "good way," but
know the way of practicing it.
Leaders must wish to extend oppor
tunity to everyone, and to avoid su
perimposing their own opinions on
those who follow them, she said.
The meeting was the first of three
in the Institute. Second meeting,
primarily one of discussion, will be
held next Wednesday. Student
speakers will prime four discussion
groups to consider basic principles
of Stanford democratic system.

be followed constantly, not only be
fore Commencement or Election
Day," he said. "If we are going to
have democracy at Stanford, we must
do something about it."
Three things, he felt, are demand
ed of Stanford student government,
"responsibility, good taste, and fair
ness." Unless these three are found
in leaders and their followers, dem
ocracy will fail, in his opinion.
He emphasized the place of the
followers in democracy, saying that
"If nothing else, an elevated public
should be the one thing to come
from Stanford living democracy." An
intelligent public to follow govern
mental procedure must be assumed
for the success of our democracy, he
felt.
Lists Principles
Professor Robinson pointed out
that a distinction must be made be
tween politics and government. Self
government, he defined, involves set
ting up a system to settle all ques
tions which really count in a grow
ing community.
To do this, he listed three prin
ciples which he considered more
important than practicality in living
democracy. The first is the ability
and desire to face problems with
thoughts of the future as well as
the immediate situation. Members
of Stanford's democracy must ask,
"What kind of a place do I want
Stanford to be?" he said.
Second important principle of
democracy, as he sees it, is the ne
cessity for followers to examine
every proposal and every leader
critically, and intelligently.
Discussion Follows
Third tenet which he advanced
was the need for members of a self
governing community to believe in
the possibility of living according to
science, truth, or God—all objects of
the faith which he believes is the
foundation of democratic prin
ciples. ,
But, on the whole, he felt, "It all
goes back to the individual."
In the discussion which followed,
Dean of Women Mary Yost added
that student leaders and members of
Stanford's democracy should not
only know the "good way," but
know the way of practicing it.
Leaders must wish to extend oppor
tunity to everyone, and to avoid su
perimposing their own opinions on
those who follow them, she said.
The meeting was the first of three
in the Institute. Second meeting,
primarily one of discussion, will be
held next Wednesday. Student
speakers will prime four discussion
groups to consider basic principles
of Stanford democratic system.
"This precious, brittle thing we
call Stanford life is in your hands,"
Professor Edgar E. Robinson told 125
student leaders last night at the first
meeting of the Stanford Leadership
Institute.
Presided over-by Cynthia Coonlcy,
the meeting was the first of three
planned for the Institute by the
Committee on Student Leadership.
Short discussion followed the speech
by Professor Robinson as he set
the key-note for the meetings to
follow.
