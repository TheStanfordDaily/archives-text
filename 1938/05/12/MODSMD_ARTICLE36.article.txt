'jPHE left end situation in football
is pretty well set for next year,
with Jack Clark the top man and
Bill Willard about second, but the
coaches are having a little trouble
with that right end.
At least, that's the way it is to
hear Jim Lawson tell it, and Jim
ought to know, since he's end coach.
It seems that Andy Stojkovich,
the Mad Russian of El Toro. and
Bill McElroy are so even-steven
that even Lawson doesn't know
how to choose. According to
"W'ihner," as Playmate Lieben
dorfer calls Playmate Lawson, he
never saw two ends who per
formed so much alike.
Stoke and Mac ,bl° alike, they
handle every play just the same,
they even get together and work out
the various problems a right end
has trouble with. They are very
nearly the same weight, although
Stoke probably would have a couple
of pounds edge if they got on the
scales. In short, they come nearer
to being twins in football suits than
any two players competing for one
position that Lawson has seen.
Stojkovich, you will remember,
j was just another end last season—
| he got in a game or two, but nobody
heard much about him. If you want
Ito believe the coaches this year,
though, the red-headed Russian is
going to play lots of football this
fall. He has shown remarkable im
provement, enough so that Lawson
thinks he's as good a defensive end
as there is on the squad. With Twin
McElroy also available for the posi
t.'on, it seems to be in good hands.

A MONG other developments on
the team, Chet Patton, a full
back last year, is headed for a jun
ior year at center. He has been
working at it in spring practice, and
shows plenty of promise. He's a
long, gangly kid that doesn't look
like a football player, but somehow
he gets that long stride of his going
| enough to cover all the territory
I necessary on defense.
! Chet's biggest trouble right now
I is learning how to block after he
J has passed the ball into the back
field. Very inexperienced at the
position, he can't be expected to
be a Walt Heinecke the first week,
| but he may turn into something
next fall.
Another prospect with plenty of
1 promise is this John Casey, who quit
I sprinting for the track team a while
back to play spring football. A
; transfer from Pomona J. C., Casey
1 is a nice, quiet boy until he gets
into a game, and then he goes slight
ly nutty, according to Lawson.
When the Pomona squad lost by
j seven points to the Cal frosh last
season, about all the San Francisco
1 newspapermen had to say about
Pomona was that Casey did a pretty
! good job of slowing down the Cubs.
He plays rough, and he plays tough,
| and anybody knows that good foot
; ball players ain't fairies.
| There is also a possibility that
Swede Johannessen, frosh tackle
j last year who has been working at
| tackle this spring, may be shifted to
I guard when autumn comes. The
| tackles will be pretty strong, but
: that guard situation is still dark.
