# The 						Dove's Moulting Season
## 
### 
STUDENTS who watched the proposed peace
course through its infancy are very happy
now that it has found a guardian and is set
ling out to seek its fortune. They have a com
fortable, something - accomplished - something
done feeling. As far as they can see the course
is strong enough to shift for itself, and there
is no longer any need to worry about it.
It is true that the project has gotten past
ihe adolescent stage. The University has
promised to organize it, and if the roughs want
'o forget it they can. But that doesn't mean that
students with ideas about the peace course
will have to bottle them up and wait impati
ently for next year's Time Schedule. The Uni
versity, we know, will welcome suggestions.
The peace course will be organized as an
experiment, much like the personal problems
course last winter. It is designed to meet the
requests of students, and the policy is to shape
it to campus ideas as much as discretion will
permit.
In the personal problems course the final
organization was hammered out in conferences
between student leaders and faculty. The re
sults were tested for a quarter, and the mem
bers of the class were asked to give opinions.
Next year's syllabus will be altered to fit some
of the ideas that came from students' reports.
If the same scenario is followed with the
peace course, the roughs will get a chance to
parade their favorite schemes when the study
onds next winter. But in the meantime there
are lots of opportunities for a well-groomed
opinion to join the peace course procession.
The more opinions the students contribute, the
easier it will be to design a syllabus that will
be popular.
And so if there are any working models of
ideas on the campus their owners can find a
ready market. The peace course is still at an
impressionable age.â€”J. C.
