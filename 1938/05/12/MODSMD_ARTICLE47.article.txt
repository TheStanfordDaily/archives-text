# Obvious Orchids
## 
### 
ORCHIDS today should go to the seniors for
seeing the obvious. In the person of Class
President Bob Mc√üoskey they suggested re
cently that Herbert Hoover should be invited
to speak at an all-University assembly.
Almost anyone should have thought of the
same thing. Mr. Hoover is the University's most
prominent alumnus. He still is intimately con
nected with Stanford through his seat on the
Board of Trustees. As an ex-President of the
country, he has many pertinent and authorita
tive observations to make on present national
policies and politics. And most of the students
present now have never heard him.
Everyone knew these facts, but the seniors
connected them up. To them go the orchids.
