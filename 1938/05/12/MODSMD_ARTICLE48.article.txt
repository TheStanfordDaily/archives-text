# First Draft Jitters
## 
### 
IT'S obvious that anyone is a fool to believe
what he sees in newspapers, but it's the only
way I have of finding out what the boys up
above are fixing up for me to worry about a
few years from now. And when I read that
the army is cooking up a new schedule of
draft laws, bringing them up to date so to
speak, I get the jitters.
It's probably because draft laws are the sort
of thing that you can grasp immediately. You
know what thoy mean all right, while such

things as so-many-killed-and-wounded, and
words like collective security and defensive
maneuvers just send you back to reading the
funny-papers.
Perhaps this particular instance of just-in-case
action isn't really alarming when one under
stands the real significance of it. Probably if
an army officer were to take me aside and ex
plain that such action is purely routine, that it
is always done, that it doesn't mean a thing, I
might go away happy. But I douht it.
In my own narrow way, I can only see that
such preparation isn't just for the fun of it, or
just to give someone something to do with their
time. It has a definite purpose, and all the justi
fication there is still doesn't convince me that
the purpose is just-in-case and not war.
Since there's nothing I can do about it, I just
ignore the answer, which runs, "The whole
world is doing it, and we must, too, to play
safe." By admitting such an ostrich-like atti
tude, I am open to charges of faulty logic, of
romanticism, and, perhaps, of cowardice.
But in spite of that, while my head is in the
sand, I still insist on saying that preparation
never makes war more distant. It only builds
a nice nest for it to lay an egg in, and sooner
or later, that egg is going to hatch. The idea
is brought home to me with unanswerable
definiteness when I read about draft laws.
I'm getting worried when I find out they know
all about my plan to build an Ivory Tower.
They're fixing it up to keep me around. Just
in case, oh, yeah?â€”J. S.
