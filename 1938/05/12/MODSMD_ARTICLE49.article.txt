# BULL SESSION
## BOATHOUSE BLUES 
### 
Emery Bellwether came into the Shack yes
terday afternoon, it was the first time I had seen
him since the Water Carnival, at which time he had
been skittering around the lake in a small canoe,
getting in everyone's hair and obviously enjoying it.
Now, however, he seemed to be in a more serious
mood.
"I see we're being put off again," he said.
"Put off?"
"By the Administration. About the Boathouse. The
o1 d 'Pat-on-the-back-and-go-p ed d 1 e-your-papers'
policy. That's what we're getting."
"But, Emery," I said, "the matter's going to be re
ferred to the Board of Trustees—"
"The Trustees! No doubt. But is there going to
be a strong recommendation for action? Is there going
to be any recommendation for action? Will anything
be done? Has anyone said anything would be done?
Is anybody doing anything beyond making a few state
ments to The Daily? Has even one of our executive
officers expressed regret for the incident? What do
you think?"
"That may be true, Bellwether, but—"
"There shouldn't be any buts. Once upon a time,
you will remember, we wanted a Nitery; and we got
a Nitery. But we were told no one would go to a
Nitery, and we were given a Nitery no one did go to.
That was an object lesson for us.
"At the same time we were told that while the Boat
house couldn't be used for a Nitery, it was perfectly
safe. Now it seems it wasn't perfectly safe. That
should have been an object lesson for the Administra
tion. But is anything being done about it? No."
"I told you, Emery, it's being referred to the Board
of Trust—"
"So I hear, and I quite believe it. But it's being
passed over and hushed up, and unless somebody does
something about it, the Board of Trustees is going to
figure that it might just as well let the whole thing slide,
inasmuch as there evidently isn't any desire, on the
part of either students or Administration, for con
structive action."
"I doubt if it's that bad."
"Almost. Whether it's that bad or not, it's just a
little too typical to be altogether satisfying. Something
ought to be done!"
"This is Stanford, Bellwether," I said, "so calm
down."—Allen Drury.

been skittering around the lake in a small canoe,
getting in everyone's hair and obviously enjoying it.
Now, however, he seemed to be in a more serious
mood.
"I see we're being put off again," he said.
"Put off?"
"By the Administration. About the Boathouse. The
o1 d 'Pat-on-the-back-and-go-p ed d 1 e-your-papers'
policy. That's what we're getting."
"But, Emery," I said, "the matter's going to be re
ferred to the Board of Trustees—"
"The Trustees! No doubt. But is there going to
be a strong recommendation for action? Is there going
to be any recommendation for action? Will anything
be done? Has anyone said anything would be done?
Is anybody doing anything beyond making a few state
ments to The Daily? Has even one of our executive
officers expressed regret for the incident? What do
you think?"
"That may be true, Bellwether, but—"
"There shouldn't be any buts. Once upon a time,
you will remember, we wanted a Nitery; and we got
a Nitery. But we were told no one would go to a
Nitery, and we were given a Nitery no one did go to.
That was an object lesson for us.
"At the same time we were told that while the Boat
house couldn't be used for a Nitery, it was perfectly
safe. Now it seems it wasn't perfectly safe. That
should have been an object lesson for the Administra
tion. But is anything being done about it? No."
"I told you, Emery, it's being referred to the Board
of Trust—"
"So I hear, and I quite believe it. But it's being
passed over and hushed up, and unless somebody does
something about it, the Board of Trustees is going to
figure that it might just as well let the whole thing slide,
inasmuch as there evidently isn't any desire, on the
part of either students or Administration, for con
structive action."
"I doubt if it's that bad."
"Almost. Whether it's that bad or not, it's just a
little too typical to be altogether satisfying. Something
ought to be done!"
"This is Stanford, Bellwether," I said, "so calm
down."—Allen Drury.
Emery Bellwether came into the Shack yes
terday afternoon, it was the first time I had seen
him since the Water Carnival, at which time he had
been skittering around the lake in a small canoe,
getting in everyone's hair and obviously enjoying it.
Now, however, he seemed to be in a more serious
mood.
