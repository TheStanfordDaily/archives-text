UROM New York, via John Hobart, drama editor of
the Chroncile, comes advance theater news for next
season which should cheer the hearts of campus audi
ences. Probably the best word is that Orson Welles,
who is considered the coming lad on Broadway, will
bring his Mercury Theater repertoire out here early
next fall.
It will include his production of "Julius Caesar,"
played in modern dress and without scenery, the rol
licking "Shoemaker's Holiday," and Shaw's "Heart
break House," which is the newest edition to the Mer
cury season. Besides, San Francisco will see the pre
miere of his "Five Kings," a two-night condensation of
Shakespeare chronicle plays.
"On Borrowed Time," Paul Osborn's success, will
also be on the Coast early next fall, if plans go aright,
as well as "White Oaks," of the Jalna scries, with Ethel
Barrymore in the cast. "Shadow and Substance" and
Thornton Wilder's Pulitzer prize play, "Our Town,"
may also be expected sometime next year.
For summer-school people, "Susan and God" with
Gertrude Lawrence will go into the Curran for a mid-
July opening. Probably the whole New York cast will
be brought en masse for the production. And of
course, Helen Hayes, in "Victoria Regina" will be here
very shortly, for a stay of three weeks. Tickets are
selling like hot-cakes right now.
Alfred Lunt is tinkering with the idea of hitting the
City with his production of "The Sea Gull." And
there is still hope that Maurice Evans will finally ar
rive with his "Richard II." So it looks like the S.F.
stages will be fairly humming with activity.

4 \F COURSE, they haven't been doing so badly this
year. Right now, only "You Can't Take It With
You"' is holding forth. It must be growing a beard on
the Geary stage. "Golden Boy," which just left, was
probably the top billing of the year, excluding, of
course. Helen Hayes who is to come.
But probably the best thing in the city right now
is on the screen—"Club des Femmes." It has the de
lovely Danielle Darrieux; although she isn't the star
of the show, Hollywood plugs to the contrary. But
it is one of the musts as far as we're concerned. The
French, as has lx>en said to tin point «>t triteness, have
something. Stone
