## WOMEN AND JOURNALISM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your Women's Issue
Was so much tissue,
Because of statements
Inarticulatements
Anent the gals
Who help us Chaparrals.
Your paper said their number's
two,
And I would like to inform you
Their number's 30 or so,
And they're very purty, you know
And if you don't know, we do,
And nuts to you.
Yes, yes,
I admit I digress.
Now I don't wish to get rough
With vyhoever wrote that stuff;
I don't care to ride her,
But just to gently chide her,
For, in closing this ditty—
Which no doubt will taste gritty:
That's the way it goes,
I suppose—
Wimmen and journalism don't
mix.
—Art Levinson.
