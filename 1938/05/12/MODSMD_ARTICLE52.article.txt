# DON'T MIX
## 
### 
Art Levinson, Sir:
In words that I find
Not too sublime
A ditty
Not witty
Exceedingly inert
You loudly assert
That wimmen and journalism
don't mix
And yet you're so bold
As to viciously hold
That your staff numbers .'5O or so
That also they're pretty, but you
know
We're doing a favor for you
By mentioning only two.
Still if you insist
That they still don't mix
Why don't you fire all those wim
men who try to extract 15 cents
from me once a month on the
Quad and let it go at that?
â€”The Women's Editor.
