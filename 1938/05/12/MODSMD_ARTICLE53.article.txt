The Editor, Sir:
On Tuesday morning at 9, I parked
my tan Ford coupe in the lot beside
the Library. When I returned at
2:30 a rear fender has been bashed
in by some fellow parker who did
not think it either wise or appropri
ate to leave a note of apology.
While my insurance adequately
covers any damage I might inflict
on other people's cars, it does not
cover lesser damages to my own
car.
I have been wondering if the Stan
ford Honor Code (or at least Stan
ford traditions) does not apply to
such situations as this. Or do fair
ness and decency obtain only in the
class-room and on the playing field?
Very truly yours,
—Philip E. Keller.
