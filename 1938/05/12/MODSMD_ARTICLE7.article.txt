Cigarettes will be gi/en away by

slid down a wire to the ground, and,
according to McDaniel, "May the
best men and women do their smok
ing free." From time to time "Flat

Largest Orchestra
"Is Europe?" is the exhilirating
story of a little bankrupt kingdom
which is offered as a battle field for
the European powers in payment of
$30,000,000 to cancel the national
debt. To its rescue come a gi'oup of
American college students on tour
armed with only wit and music
against a situation of dark and daffy
intrigue.
The musical accompaniment and
background will be furnLshed by the
largest orchestra ever to play for a
student production, lead by Art Mc-
Cue, which will play nine songs, in
cluding swing, smooth, and novelty
numbers arranged by Myron Birn
baum.
