### BILL MILLIS 
the battle of a year ago i
over the attempted enlargement
of the Supreme Court, it has fre- |
quently been held that the Roose- j
vclt Administration, although it lost !
the exact reforms which it was seek- j
ing, was able—through its stimula- j
tion of public criticism of the role of j
the judiciary in present-day democ- j
racy—to attain a large measure of j
its ultimate aim: the "liberalization" (
of the attitude of the courts to New j
Deal measures.
This interpretation, which is but I
a disguised version of Mr. Dooley's i
remark about "the courts always'
follow the election results," was ade- j
quale for a period which now seems j
to be drawing to an end.
Indication that the Supreme Court |
will again assert its long-claimed j
independence and superiority over
both the legislative and administra- j
tive branches of the government can i
be seen in its decision three weeks j
ago in the Kansas City stockyards j
case which is producing a revision
of practices of other Federal quasi
judicial bodies, particularly the Na
iional Labor Relations Board.

Further evidence of a changing
attitude of the Supreme Court
was displayed yesterday by Chief
Justice Charles Evans liughes,
who, in his first public address
since the defeat of the court re
organization bill, told the Ameri
can Law Institute in Washington
that quasi-judicial agencies should
exercise their powers cautiously.
Calling for "continued respect
for the judicial tradition of in
dependence and impartiality,"
Mr. Justice liughes said that "it
is in the judicial process that we
find the most developed and sys
tematic effort of a democratic
community to maintain the inter
ests of justice by opposing reason
to passion, accepted principles to
unbridled discretion, and the re
quirements of fair play to the fav
oritism of tyranny and pow.r."
In their actions, quasi-judicial
agencies should follow the "spirit of
the just judge," he warned.

I ahead with their plans
to make China into a "second
India," the Japanese army and navy
are reportedly massing men and
armaments at Formosa and at the
Fukien port of Amoy, now com
pletely paptured, for a great invasion
of South China.
At the same time, their army
headquarters spokesman in Central
China contended that Nipponese col
umns will today, for the first time,
sever the fortified Lung-hai railway

Adolf Hitler's Czechoslovakia!!
Charlie McCarthy, Konrad Henlein,
arrived in London by aii'plane last
night on a "mysteriously arranged
visit" which will have the purpose of
explaining Nazi demands for full
autonomy for Czechoslovakia's 3,-
500.000 Sudeten Germans.
Keeping a straight face. British
officials declared that they were
"profoundly surprised" by llcn
lein's arrival, and denied that he
had been invited, even semi-offi
cially.
Washington feared that "a tre
mendous struggle" between railway
management and labor is near, as
employers, acting under the Railway
Labor Act, attempted to push
through a 15 per cent wage reduction
amounting to $250,000,000, while
leaders of 900,000 in the independ
ent railroad brotherhoods renewed
threats of a nationwide strike. Both
the AFL and CIO have pledged sup
port to the rail unions, since they
fear the start of a new wave of wage
slashes.
Summary: The House passed and
sent to the Senate the Administra
tion's $3,054,425,000 recovery-relief
bill, designed to increase consumer
purchasing power and to provide
5.000,000 jobs.—Despite an unsuc
cessful plea of deposed Emperor
Haile Selassie, a majority of the
League of Nations Council decided
to revoke their 1936 pledge and rec
ognize Italy's conquest of Ethiopia.
A four-hour sit-down strike was
held by 75 San Quentin convicts in
hree prison shops.—More than 600
Integeralistas, implicated in the
abortive Brazilian Fascist revolt, face
trial as the government began a
purge of political opponents.—ln
