# Stanford Files $195,581 Suit
## University Charges Securities Violation 
### 
Seeking to recover $195,581 and (
interest, allegedly owed the Univer- I
sity as a result of misrepresentation
in the conversion of 1300 shares of
stock, Stanford University filed suit
yesterday in Santa Clara County
Superior Court against the National
Supply Company of Pennsylvania,
charging violation of the Federal Se
curities Act of 1933.
An outgrowth of a power, granted
in 1936, to invest and trade in cor
porate stocks, the university trustees
purchased 1300 shares of preferred
stock between July 18, 1936. and
June 4. 1937, from the National Sup
ply Company of Delaware, entitling
it to quarterly dividends of 7 per
cent, cumulative when not paid, the
complaint asserts.
The corporation consolidated with
Spang, Chalfant and Company of
Pennsylvania on October 23. 1937, at
which time, the University contends,
it could have demanded the full pur
chase price of the stock, $115 per
share, plus five years' unpaid accu
mulated dividends.
Judgment for $195,581 with inter
est from October 23 is asked. The
book value of the 1300 shares of
stock is listed in the financial report
at $150,835.76.
