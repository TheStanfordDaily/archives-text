# A 						Mouse In Time Makes Nine
## 
### 
Up on the fifth floor of Encina,
that home of all oddities, there's
a mouse named Johnny who lives
in a bird cage and sleeps in .
cantaloupe on the half shell.
Two very unusual things hap
pened to Johnny two weeks ago
(1) He flew to Omaha, Neb.
.vilh his owner, John Sumner, win
is in the graduate school of busi
ness. Airplane officials said he
was the first mouse ever to fly.
(2) Ho had a litter of labies.
Something else is going to hap
pen to Johnny. He's going t<
have his name changed.
