# Author Takes Leading Role In 'Is Europe?'
## Ed Kerr Plays Prime Minister Iam; Jones Fills Heroine Part 
### PARK KIMBALL 
Each evening at "Is Europe?" re
hearsal time, Ed Kerr, co-author of
the Spring Show, takes leave from i
his position of debate manager to I
become "lam, Prime Minister of ;
Balkania, and steps into a role 1
which calls on him to do a Hugh !
Herbert of Hugh Herbert doing a j
Prime Minister.
The part of "lam" was originally |
written with Hugh Herbert in mind, j
but Hal Kahn, author, declares that j
Kerr can do it still better. Kerr is j
that little man with the dark curly
hair who goes fussing about the
Quad pulling his fingers, poking his
cheek, and emitting little "Woo-woo
woo" noises. In his more serious
moments he debates and manages j
debate council.
As "lam," Kerr is the fuddy- !
duddy Prime Minister of bankrupt
Balkania, who, with the queen
mother, "Nora," rules the country
and also the boy king, Douglas. Too
brow-beaten to do much besides
read "Baby Dumpling" in the funny
papers, the king makes only a faint
effort to prevent scoundrelly lam
from renting the country to the dic
tators of the European Powers as a
battleground in return for $30,000,- !
000 to clear the debt and include a j
10 per cent commission for himself, i
"lam's" plans are badly garbled
when a group of American college j
students on tour stick their fingers
into the political pie. Bette, their
student leader, played by Shirley
Jones, falls in love with the "King
on a String" and uses her American
wit to relieve the situation.
As a typical group of college stu
dents, those on Miss Ponkey's Tour
find many an opportunity to sing,
dance, and wisecrack to nine new
student-written tunes. Even the
six dictators, assembled to sign the
rental contract, grow tuneful and
show that dictators, contrary to sup-'
1 position, can, under the proper con
ditions, be capable funny - bone
ticklers.
