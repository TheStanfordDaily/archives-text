# 'Five Old Men' Whip Upstarts'
## Youngsters Promise Strong Hoop Squad; Final Score, 54-41 
### HARRY PRESS 
Out of a mad melee that at times
almost eould be called a basketball j
game, there appeared last night the
embryonic forms of Stanford's 1939 |
varsity hoopsters.
And these up-and-coming guys
look mighty good to Farm eyes sore
from weeping at the loss of the coun
try's top quintet, led by All-Ameri
can Hank Luisetti.
Ye; h, next year's varsity, called
' The Upstarts," lost to "The Five
Old Men" by a count of 54-41, but
they put up a battle that had the
red-faced ancients mighty worried
for a long time.
"Upstarts" Lead at Half
Half-time score was 23-20, with
the babes on top, and it was not un
til eight minutes of the second per
iod had gone by the boards that
Hank's gang moved away with a
definite lead.
It was a mighty small crowd—7so
— that dished out its four-bits per !
head for the good of the Convales- I
cent Home, to see America's greatest ]
basketballer play his last game on )
the Farm. Admissions totaled
$383.50.
But they gave Hank a booming
salute of applause which made up
for the lack of attendance.
Quite a Mix-Up
That salute as he went out, how
ever, proved to be a false alarm, j
Here's how it happened:
With two minutes to go, Hank j
went out, was replaced by Heath. |
Half-minute later, Lee was kicked !
out with four personal fouls, so j
Hank had to go in again. But that
was only the beginning.
Another half-minute found Lui
setti himself given the whistle for
one too many fouls. And this time,
no one was left to go in. Play was
just about to start when, with four
men on the floor, the ancients got a
I brainstorm. In came Johnny Reis
ner, star Farm athlete of a few years
back, and trainer-for-the-evening
for "The Five Old Men." He was
dressed in mufti, but that made no
difference. What's more, he didn't
miss too many passes.
'Old Men' Sloppy
Other than that little bit of hoi
polloi, the game went as scheduled,
although sloppiness was prevalent
on the part of the old boys.
They started out with a short shot
I by Stoefen, and they stayed ahead
most of the half, but only by one or
two points. In the last four minutes
of the first period, the youngsters
smashed through from a 20-14 deficit
to a 23-20 lead.
Second half see-sawed for a few
minutes, and then Hank & Co. took
it out of low gear and shot ahead,
29-27, never to be caught.
As for next season's varsity, it's
plenty good!
Davidson Tops
By far the outstanding player for
I "The Upstarts" last night was Ken
! Davidson, smooth freshman guard.
: He's a floor man deluxe, and when
he started heckling the ancients' fast
1 breaks, he proved himself capable
j of stopping just about anything they
had to offer. And Ken's one of the
fastest men to pound the Pavilion
| hardwood in a long time.
Don Burness, while ragged on
[shooting last night, played a bang-up
i floor game. As to his shooting eye
I being off, no one should worry, be
j cause everyone was off — except
i Hank, who tanked 29 points.
Don Williams, Darrel Huddleson,
I Leon Lafaille, and especially Dick
j Lyon—they all looked mighty sweet,
' and they'll go a long way to carry
I Stanford to the top in 1939.
