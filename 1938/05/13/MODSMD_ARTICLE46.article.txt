r rHE Head Man, Claude E Thorn
hill, is still trying to get some
students out to football practices.
Not to spring practices does he want
the students to come, because the
building of spirit is not .necessary
now, but he wants to have one day
a week during the regular season
on which the students would flock
out.
Ever since Tiny took over from
Pop Warner he has held wide open
practices, and that includes the time
last year when the gates were sup
posed to be closed but were always
open. As far as he's concerned any
one can come to see his team prac
tice.
However, he doesn't just toler
ate students at practices—he wants
them to come out. To this end he
is trying to start a propaganda
campaign now, in hopes he'll gel
some results by the time fall rolls
around.
Tiny even offers a feature attrac
tion in a scrimmage for Students'
Day, provided it can be set for Tues
day or Wednesday afternoon. The
oys are still pretty tired after games
t Monday practice sessions, and
!ate-week scrimmages are out be
ause somebody might get hurt and
he players would be certain to get
extra tired iri the games.
The presence of the band wouldn't
hurt matters any, in Thornhill's
opinion, although Jim Lav/son is
.ig'in it.
At any rate, Tiny hasn't given up
trying to get students out to prac
ices for five years, now, and he's
making another .stab for the sixth
year. Just as a little reminder five
.nonths in advance, corne to football
workouts next fall.

'4MIE Trojans were regarded as a
cinch to win the Fresno Relays
jst year, with Stanford a sure sec
fid and Cal a sure third. The Cards
..ulled a crashing victory out of the
. leet over Troy, 64-54' 2, and won
.vide acclaim.
'Ibis year Stanford is figured for
third behind Cal. However, the
!iiMeet and U.S.C. meet losses
don't look like a typical Templeton
track team, and it's barely possible
that the Indians are going to move
up this week-end.
Whether Stanford will bring home
.• ny records this year is doubtful.
. ast year the team of Kneubuhl.
' 'eiershauser, Malott and Hiserman
. epped the 880 relay in 1:25 for a
.jw world's record. Besides that
•..ie Indians won the mile, two-mile,
; nd medley relays, and took second
j.i the 440 relay in the track events.
If it's possible to win that meet,
Vempleton's boys will do it. They
\ artly blew up in the Big Meet, and
1 hey went sky-high in the Troy
. leet; they're about due to get off a
■ ood one, even though they don't
ave the depth of Cal and U.S.C.
