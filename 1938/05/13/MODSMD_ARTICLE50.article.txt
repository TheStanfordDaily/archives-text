# Indians Enter 20 in Coast Relays
## Troy Picked To Win Meet Tomorrow Individual Entrants Will Hold Spotlight In Raisin City Classic 
### 
Fresno's West Coast Relays, which
annually produce the fastest times
and bring together the greatest
trackmen on the Coast, are the focal
point of this week-end's national
cinderpath schedule.
Eyes of the experts from all sec
tions of the country will be fas
tened on the Raisin City tomorrow
night, with expectations high for the
usual run of ace performances.
L'.S.C. Favored
U.S.C. is favored for team honors,
with Cal figured to give the Tro
jans a close run, but the individual
competitors rather than the team
strengths will hold the spotlight.
This is especially true in the 100-
yard dash, which will feature no less
than 10 Coast runners who have
equaled o» bettered 9.8. Adrian Tal
ley, Troy's defending champion, will
be favored, but he will get stiff com
petition from Arnold Nutting of Cal;
Ben Reams, Chico State flash who
has done 9.5 this year; Tommy Nel
son, Fresno State's home-town hope;
and Stanford's Stan Hiserman, if the
latter isn't too handicapped by an
injured knee.
Won Four Relays
Last year the Cards won the 880-
yard, mile, two-mile and medley re
lays and took second in the 440-yard
baton-passing event.
In the open events. Dick Carew
finished a strong third in the cen
tury, Pete Zagar and Hugh Gribbin
nabbed one-two in the discus and
Jim Reynolds and A1 Hershey pick
ed up second and fourth, respec
tively, in the shot-put.
However, with few exceptions the
Cards have lost by graduation the
backbone of year's team, includ
ing Tiger Alexander, Bill McCurdy,
and Jack Weiershauser, and the
Cards will have to show remarkable
improvement to repeat tomorrow
evening. Zagar and Gribbin seem to
be Stanford's only chance for a
first place, although the vastly im
proved Tom Montgomery may cop
the shot-put.

Won Four Relays
Last year the Cards won the 880-
yard, mile, two-mile and medley re
lays and took second in the 440-yard
baton-passing event.
In the open events. Dick Carew
finished a strong third in the cen
tury, Pete Zagar and Hugh Gribbin
nabbed one-two in the discus and
Jim Reynolds and A1 Hershey pick
ed up second and fourth, respec
tively, in the shot-put.
However, with few exceptions the
Cards have lost by graduation the
backbone of year's team, includ
ing Tiger Alexander, Bill McCurdy,
and Jack Weiershauser, and the
Cards will have to show remarkable
improvement to repeat tomorrow
evening. Zagar and Gribbin seem to
be Stanford's only chance for a
first place, although the vastly im
proved Tom Montgomery may cop
the shot-put.

AVALON, Santa Catalina Island,

pointed with pride yesterday to a 63-
pound record white sea bass he
pulled from Santa Catalina waters,
when trolling from a rowboat yes
terday with an 80-foot line. The
previous record was 60 pounds.
Fresno's West Coast Relays, which
annually produce the fastest times
and bring together the greatest
trackmen on the Coast, are the focal
point of this week-end's national
cinderpath schedule.
Eyes of the experts from all sec
tions of the country will be fas
tened on the Raisin City tomorrow
night, with expectations high for the
usual run of ace performances.
L'.S.C. Favored
U.S.C. is favored for team honors,
with Cal figured to give the Tro
jans a close run, but the individual
competitors rather than the team
strengths will hold the spotlight.
This is especially true in the 100-
yard dash, which will feature no less
than 10 Coast runners who have
equaled o» bettered 9.8. Adrian Tal
ley, Troy's defending champion, will
be favored, but he will get stiff com
petition from Arnold Nutting of Cal;
Ben Reams, Chico State flash who
has done 9.5 this year; Tommy Nel
son, Fresno State's home-town hope;
and Stanford's Stan Hiserman, if the
latter isn't too handicapped by an
injured knee.
