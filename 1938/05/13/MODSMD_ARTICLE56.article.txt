# Tiny Conducts Scrimmage On Grey Field
## First Two String Match Power Early in Spring Practice 
### 
Spectators who stayed around the
Grey field until 5:30 o'clock last
night got their money's worth and
more when Tiny Thornhill put his
first two teams through a short but
vicious scrimmage.
The two lineups didn't play long
enough to establish any superiority
in either, although the potential
first string maneuvered a touch
down pass from Norm Standlee to
Howard Hickingbotham with a neat
bit of blocking by Dick Sutton.
Standlee Passes
Standlee was doing most of his
team's passing from the tail-back
position with Pete Fay, Bill McEl
roy, and Hickingbotham trying to re
ceive. Standlee and Hod Parker,
playing in Bill P;iulman's post,
ripped off several good gains down
the middle.
Thor Peterson, one of the best of
last season's freshman crop, broke
into the second string backfield at
left half with Gene Coldiron, Fred
die Lrdeboer, and Jimmy Groves.
Ilamp Pool was playing Grove's
right half position on the first string.
Second String
Steve Keusseff and Paul Ugrin
continued their steady play at the
second string guard posts with
Swede Johannessen, another frosh,
and Neal Sinclair at the tackles and
Bill Willard and Harry Wyeth on
the flanks.
Prior to the first-second team
duel, Thornhill had a host of lesser
lights in action. Chet Patton got in
his first licks as a center after spend
ing four years of high school and
two college seasons as a fullback.
While he looked inexperienced, he
nevertheless showed that he had
possibilities at the pivot post.
