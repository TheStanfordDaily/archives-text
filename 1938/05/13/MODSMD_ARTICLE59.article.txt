# Golfers To Go East For Intercollegiates
## 
### 
Appropriation of money by B.A.C. at its meeting Wednesday, night will
make it possible for Stanford to be represented officially for the first time
when the leading collegiate golf teams in the country meet at Louisville,
Kentucky, for the National Intercollegiate championships.
Card teams in the past have been financed by the players themselves

and have not officially represented
the University. This year marks
the first time that a Farm divot dig
ging squad has been sent East by
the B.A.C.
Having cleaned up on all competi
tion on the Pacific Coast, the In
dians, coached by Eddie Twiggs, will
go to Louisville, scene of the 1938
National Intercollegiates, where
they will take a fling at the tough
est collegiate golf competition in
the country.
Wins Easy
In six dual matches so far this
season, the Cards have won with
ease. They downed U.S.C. twice,
U.C.L.A. twice, the University of
Oklahoma once, and wound up their
dual meet season by thrashing one
of the strongest California teams in
years, 24 l i>-2 1 2.
A return Big Match with Califor
nia was scheduled for today and all
necessary preliminaries taken care
of, but the Bear athletic board was
forced to call it off at the last min
ute, as a representative team could
not be rounded up due to final ex
aminations.
Season Closed
Calling off the Big Match brought
Stanford's conference season to a
close, but practice matches with
U.S.F. and San Jose State are being
tentatively lined up as well as one
with Yale University at Louisville
before the Nationals.
Next week's play in the all-Uni
versity tourna.vierit will also help
keep the men in shape prior to the
tournament. Eddie Twiggs has not
named the six-man team, but stated
that it will probably consist of Art
Doering, Jack Wallace, Bill Boyd,
Brown Cannon, Jimmy Rea, and Al
Hyman.
