# Barbecue List To Close Today
## Faculty Invited To Senior Class Picnic 
### 
Shades of the old-time "Rough"
will shine next Wednesday night
when more than 300 seniors turn
out for the free barbecue in Varsity
Park.
Today is the last day for getting
the tickets which are available free
in the A.S.S.U. offices and from
representatives in each living group.
No one who does not possess a
ticket will be served, according to
Bill Hulbert, committee chairman.
Faculty Invited
A special feature of the barbecue
is the blanket invitation issued to
all faculty members in order to pro
vide seniors a last opportunity for
meeting their professor informally.
Taking the form of a gift from the
Senior Class to Senior classmen, the
barbecue will be strictly informal,
with old clothes the absolute rule.
Hay wagons, bonfires, co-educa
tional baseball and handball, and
camp-fire singing will provide the
entertainment, according to Hulbert,
who announced 6 o'clock as the
starting time. Games will begin at 4
o'clock, he said.
Rides Provided
Special bumming stations will be
provided at the Post Office and in
front of the Deke House so that no
one will have difficulty in getting to
the barbecue site.
Working with Hulbert are Audrey
Brumfield. Mary Lewis, Larry
O'Brien. John Savage, John Shenk,
Dave Swanberg, and Roberta Tut
hill.
