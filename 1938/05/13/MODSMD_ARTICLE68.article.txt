THEY had a great idea. They filed in and sat
around the room while Dick Lyon explained
to the Board of Athletic Control just how much
the team wanted a Stanford man to coach bas
ketball here next year.
But they didn't have a chance. While Dick
told the board the players thought there v/as
something unique about Stanford basketball and
that they didn't want an outsider to come in and
change it, the board thought of the times it had
been buttonholed in favor of this candidate or
that. And this was just another whisper in the
ear.
While Dick praised Beebs Lee's personality
and ability board members remembered how
young he was. They remembered the spot any
coach would be on here next year. And they
probably remembered the spot they would be
on if the experiment failed.
But it was a great idea. Imagine three kids
just a year removed from competition as big
league coaches. With all the team spirit, they
had a chance to burn up the league. The nov
elty of it would create enthusiasm, undoubtedly
the student body would be wholeheartedly be
hind the team.
There would be a wholesome, amateur air to
the thing. The three coaches almost would have
been a part of the team. And the players would
have had a part in choosing them.
Yet I suppose the board was right, in spite of
the idealism of. the plan. Coaching is a busi
ness now and a tough one. Imagine a kid not
quite out of college arguing a technicality in
the heat of a game with Sam Barry of U.S.C.
Intercollegiate athletes are a little too big for
students now. A student-coached team might
fold up under the pressure that is generated in
conference competition these days. The board
had to remember that.
It was a great idea; it's a damn shame it
wouldn't work.
