# People Like War
## 
### 
THERE is only one thing which stops me short
when I start thinking about ending war. It's
that most people like war. It is the one thing
which appeals to almost everyone, especially
from the outside looking in, but sometimes from
the inside, too.
Take the mechanically-minded people, for in
stance. The idea of shooting a gun and hitting
an objective 20 miles away is fascinating, no
doubt about it. And there is a lot more kick in
repairing an automobile if it happens to be an
ambulance. When the trumpet sounds, you can
count on the mechanical crew, from grease
monkeys to miniature railway enthusiasts, to
lick their lips.
Then there are all the men who are tired of
their jobs or their wives, all the $25 a week
lads, stuck in a rut, and sick to death of it. War
is a chance to associate themselves with some
thing called a cause, and to become all that they
are not in real life. It's a chance to throw off
the environmental depressors, and lose them
selves in a life like a perpetual drunk.
And, of course, there are all our old friends,
the industrialists. While the rest of the country
is giving up sugar and wheat bread, they are
v/atching the bank account grow. But enough
already has been said about them. The unfa
vorable publicity they have gotten has only
served to make the rest of us envious.
As for the women, bless 'em, war is a field
day. They are always emotional, God knows,
but most of the time they have to take up the
slack on cheap movies and modern love stories.
But when war comes:
Oh, the tears shed over a sweetheart going off
in uniform! (While they would break their en
gagement if he were in civvies.) Oh, the stiff
upper lip as they go without cotton hose so
that bandages may be furnished! (While they
would rather die themselves than wear cotton.)
Oh, the sweet young things in camp uniforms,
helping "their boys"! (While they watch the so
ciety page for pictures of the last time they sold
doughnuts.)
Yet they are not to blame for feeling this way
any more than the others who love war. The
world loves it because war is the greatest emo
tional outlet ever invented, because it is the
greatest cure for insignificance ever found.
Everyone forgets that war, sooner or later,
pays off in greater insignificance. Usually in
death, either living or rotten. J. S.

is a chance to associate themselves with some
thing called a cause, and to become all that they
are not in real life. It's a chance to throw off
the environmental depressors, and lose them
selves in a life like a perpetual drunk.
And, of course, there are all our old friends,
the industrialists. While the rest of the country
is giving up sugar and wheat bread, they are
v/atching the bank account grow. But enough
already has been said about them. The unfa
vorable publicity they have gotten has only
served to make the rest of us envious.
As for the women, bless 'em, war is a field
day. They are always emotional, God knows,
but most of the time they have to take up the
slack on cheap movies and modern love stories.
But when war comes:
Oh, the tears shed over a sweetheart going off
in uniform! (While they would break their en
gagement if he were in civvies.) Oh, the stiff
upper lip as they go without cotton hose so
that bandages may be furnished! (While they
would rather die themselves than wear cotton.)
Oh, the sweet young things in camp uniforms,
helping "their boys"! (While they watch the so
ciety page for pictures of the last time they sold
doughnuts.)
Yet they are not to blame for feeling this way
any more than the others who love war. The
world loves it because war is the greatest emo
tional outlet ever invented, because it is the
greatest cure for insignificance ever found.
Everyone forgets that war, sooner or later,
pays off in greater insignificance. Usually in
death, either living or rotten. J. S.
THERE is only one thing which stops me short
when I start thinking about ending war. It's
that most people like war. It is the one thing
which appeals to almost everyone, especially
from the outside looking in, but sometimes from
the inside, too.
Take the mechanically-minded people, for in
stance. The idea of shooting a gun and hitting
an objective 20 miles away is fascinating, no
doubt about it. And there is a lot more kick in
repairing an automobile if it happens to be an
ambulance. When the trumpet sounds, you can
count on the mechanical crew, from grease
monkeys to miniature railway enthusiasts, to
lick their lips.
Then there are all the men who are tired of
their jobs or their wives, all the $25 a week
lads, stuck in a rut, and sick to death of it. War
is a chance to associate themselves with some
thing called a cause, and to become all that they
are not in real life. It's a chance to throw off
the environmental depressors, and lose them
selves in a life like a perpetual drunk.
