ANNIVERSARY
AN.EARNEST man with a stutter reached the first
anniversary of his official entry into office yester
day, and aside from a couple of court receptions, which
were merely routine and a matter of duty, gave no
sign that he remembered that he had finished his
first year as King-Eniperor of Britain.
Nor did anyone in his government help him to re
member. No parades were held, no celebrations or
ganized, no resounding pronunciamentos issued to re
call the day, a year ago, when he sat in Westminster
Abbey and heard the irrascible old man who had
helped drive his brother off the throne pronounce him
George VI, by the grace of God, of Great Britain,
Ireland, and the British Dominions Beyond the Seas,
King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India. The
anniversary of his coronation passed like any other
day in his life, with a change of uniform, an official
function, a show magnificent in its pretence to power,
and pathetic in its lack of it.
For no one trembles when the King walks by in
Britain nowadays; no one pays attention when the
King protests; no one takes into account his desires,
his feelings, his ideas. Papers are pushed at him; he
signs. Tours are arranged for him; he goes. Speeches
are written for him; he speaks. Things are done in
his name; he approves. He has no choice.
* *
his sense of duty is such that these
things do not bother him as they did the volatile
brother who was just a little too strong to be a great
king, and is proving to be just a little too weak to be
a great man. The endless rigamarole got on Edward's
nerves, and he said so; and no one seized the pretext
for abdication more eagerly than he.
He wanted out; he got out; and he was probably
far luckier than he knew at the time, to have a brother
who would step in, who would take the criticism and
the dislike, who would try as hard as he could in his
unglamorous but dogged way to rebuild the shaken
prestige of the throne.
And he has succeeded, as least as far as public
opinion in his own country is concerned. Abroad and
in the Dominions respect for the monarchy may have
become more of a task than a pleasure, but in England
it is once more firmly established, once more back in
its place at the head of the British Pantheon. The
King's feet are set on the path his father trod before
him, and his reign is already beginning to obscure
memories of the unpleasant interlude which preceded
it.
* * *
But if he is at all intelligent—and he certainly is no
fool—he must sometimes try to rationalize his position,
study the peculiar place his government has assigned
him in the scheme of things, get out of the psychology
of being King for a moment and look at the monarchy
clearly in relation to the country, the Empire, himself
and his family.
He must realize the significance of the problem
which has already defeated his brother, and may some
day defeat him; the problem which will sooner or later
have to be solved: the problem of the exact position
of the Crown, the exact powers, privileges, and re
sponsibilities of the King, the exact limitations which
British democracy, dominated by realistic diplomacy
and a tendency to toy with Fascism, can afford to place
upon one of the most potentially democratic institu
tions in the world.
But he probably doesn't worry about it too much,
because he knows that even if he did solve it, it would
not do him any good; he would not be allowed to do
anything about it, no one would be permitted to know
that he had reached a solution.
For he is the King; and the King is above politics;
and if this is interpreted by his government to mean
that the King is also above doing anything for his
people, then that's just his hard luck. That's the way
they do things in his country; and it's not his fault he
happened to be born a sucker.—Allen Drury.
