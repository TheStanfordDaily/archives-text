But the constant trek of good composers to the film
mecca, and the attendant up-shoot in the budget for
music, demonstrates that music is at last coming into
its own on the screen. Kurt Weill is an immediate
example, since his music was heard here last week

writers, does free-lance work, and is musical director

"The General Died at Dawn," won the Academy Award
for it, and was the first one to have his movie music
played independently in concert form (Hollywood

Wanger production.
Even Arnold Schoenberg, who is teaching at U.C.

something like $100,000 per picture, and wants freedom

KORNGOLD'S latest score may be heard in
"Robin Hood." And while he has been working
for Warner Brothers, he has finished an opera which
is supposed to have real merit. It. may be premiered at
the San Francisco Opera House, or may go to the
"Met" for its initial hearing.
At any rate, Korngold demonstrates that writing
for the movies is not such a hack job as one would
first suppose. Not only is music turned out with films
improving enough to be considered seriously on an
absolute scale, but composers are managing to forget
the bars-per-feet-of-celluloid, and turn out music in
their own medium.
All of which is very fine in itself. But it is im
portant in another way. Perhaps the movies will be
the solution to the problem whereby most composers
either starve writing music, or else must seek other
employment and compose in their off time. The
movies are already supporting a sizable crew of musi
cians, and can absorb a lot more. Now that the stigma
of pure commercialism is wearing off. the better com
posers can take Hollywood gold without talk of prosti
tuting their art Like the rich nobles in the old days,
Hollywood may become ;i patron of musicians. I*>rd

piano players performing all at once, or the Philadel

number.
But the constant trek of good composers to the film
mecca, and the attendant up-shoot in the budget for
music, demonstrates that music is at last coming into
its own on the screen. Kurt Weill is an immediate
example, since his music was heard here last week
end with "Johnny Johnson." Right now, he is work
ing for Paramount, turning out something quite new,
they say. It wiil be a musical counterpart of O'Neill
asides. But he is only one of a dozen good composers.
George Antheil, one of the outstanding American
writers, does free-lance work, and is musical director
for Twentieth-Century. Werner Janssen, who scored
"The General Died at Dawn," won the Academy Award
for it, and was the first one to have his movie music
played independently in concert form (Hollywood
Bowl this summer), is at present writing for a Walter
Wanger production.
Even Arnold Schoenberg, who is teaching at U.C.
L.A., is dickering with Selztiick. But he demands
something like $100,000 per picture, and wants freedom
to write whatever he wants. With the price what it is,
and his music what it is, Hollywood will probably
keep on shying from him.

KORNGOLD'S latest score may be heard in
"Robin Hood." And while he has been working
for Warner Brothers, he has finished an opera which
is supposed to have real merit. It. may be premiered at
the San Francisco Opera House, or may go to the
"Met" for its initial hearing.
At any rate, Korngold demonstrates that writing
for the movies is not such a hack job as one would
first suppose. Not only is music turned out with films
improving enough to be considered seriously on an
absolute scale, but composers are managing to forget
the bars-per-feet-of-celluloid, and turn out music in
their own medium.
All of which is very fine in itself. But it is im
portant in another way. Perhaps the movies will be
the solution to the problem whereby most composers
either starve writing music, or else must seek other
employment and compose in their off time. The
movies are already supporting a sizable crew of musi
cians, and can absorb a lot more. Now that the stigma
of pure commercialism is wearing off. the better com
posers can take Hollywood gold without talk of prosti
tuting their art Like the rich nobles in the old days,
Hollywood may become ;i patron of musicians. I*>rd
