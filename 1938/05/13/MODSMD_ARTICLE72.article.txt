OH. SO?

My Dear Miss Crase:
I'm not so base
As to call our wimmen journalists.
The little dears would be in tears;
They have their pride
And they'd bust all up inside.
I'm really not fibbing,
Though you may think I'm ribbing
You.
But speaking of misstatements,
And you'll see that this is true,
It's no harder to print 33
Than to print the number 2.
9 Now in yesterday's letter I wasn't
drunk,
And yet you think my letter
Had an odor.
So to end the fuss
I'll amend it thus:
Wimmin and journalism don't mix
Except on Chaparral.
—Art Levinson.
P.S. Do you know what people
come to,
Who have lost their sense of
humor?
They develop indigestion
A cancer or a tumor.

SO

Dear Art:
So that's what's wrong
With Chaparral. So long.
—Corona.
