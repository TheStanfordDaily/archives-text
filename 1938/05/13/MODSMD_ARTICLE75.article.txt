cuss the contributions of the Middle
Ages to man's comfort in a talk,
"How Our Medieval Ancestors
Learned to Keep Warm," over Sta
tion KGO at 9:15 o'clock Monday
evening.
Dr. White points out that though
most people believe the Middle
Ages contributed but little to man's
comfort, practically all the devices
now used for keeping warm were
the result of medieval inventions.
He will describe how such con
veniences as warm clothing, snug
architecture, the fireplace, and dis
tilled liquors came during this pe
riod.
' All the main devices for keeping
warm which we enjoy today were
unknown in Roman times," Dr.
White says, "but were developed
during the Middle Ages. Decorative
garments and buildings were re
placed by more practical and warm
er clothing and abodes. Finally, the
Middle Ages learned how to stimu
late the circulation of the blood by
means of distilled liquors.
"In the last four centuries we
have simply perfected the medieval
devices for keeping warm, but have
invented no new ones."
