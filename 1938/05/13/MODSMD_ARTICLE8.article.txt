# Stanford's Political Union Equals Oxford's, Says Buck
## 
### 
Although the Oxford Political Un- J
ion has 125 years of experience be- |
hind it, Stanford's new Union com
pares "very favorably" with it, ac- |
cording to Associate Professor Philip \
E. Buck, who has seen both in j
action.
He found little difference between j
the meetings he attended while i
studying at Oxford, and the first dis- i
cussion held by the S.P.U. Wednes- '
day night. Both use the parlia- |
mentary system, although "the Ox- j
ford procedure, following that of the
British government, is a little dif- j
ferent from ours."
Stanford's Union varies somewhat j
in the fact that speeches are or- j
ganized before the meeting, while at !
Oxford all discussion arises spon- !
taneously from the floor. The chair- j
men of both groups recognize speak
ers from different sides of the ques- j
tion alternately, he said.

Because of tradition and ex
perience behind Oxford Union
members, they show a greater
knowledge of parliamentary proce
dure than do the Stanford Union
members. However, he saw no less
enthusiasm and interest here than
at Oxford. In both places, he said,
"there are extremely stupid speech
es as well as extremely clever ones."
