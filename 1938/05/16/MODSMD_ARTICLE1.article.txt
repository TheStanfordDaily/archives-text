### BILL MILLIS 
IN CHINA, as in Spain, "the total
itarian war" as conducted by na
tions superior in aviation, artillery,
tanks, and .other mechanized equip
ment seems to be proving success
ful in the long run against armies
that possess a will to resistance but
not much else.
The biggest battle since the fall of
Nanking, and perhaps the most im
portant battle since the Sino-Japan
ese "incident" started last July, is
now raging along the fortified Lung
hai railway, where, according to an
announcement of a Shanghai Jap
anese arrtiy spokesman, Nipponese
columns have encircled and smashed
into the suburbs of the key city of
Suchow-fu.
Four armies crossed the Yellow
River and reportedly cut "the
Chinese Hindenberg line" at three
points, while Japanese planes
bombed positions along the entire
distance of the 200-milc front.
Rumors in Shanghai were that
(General Tsung-jen. the Chinese
commander, had fled westward
from Sucliow, leaving at least half
of his force of 400,000 trapped,
to await death or capture.

Significance of a completely suc
cessful Japanese engagement before
Suchow would be that their terri
tories in the Peiping-Tientsin and
Shanghai-Nanking areas would be
joined together, and that a new,
Nipponese-controlled and styled
"National Government for China"
would be established.
In Tokyo, preparations for a
"victory celebration" were rushed
by the government, which appears
confident that Suchow and the
entire length of the Tientsin-Nan
king railway soon will be captured.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Presi
dent Roosevelt issued a second ap
peal for contributions to the lagging
Red Cross campaign for $1,000,000
to aid Chinese civilian refugees. So
far contributions total only $170,000.

J>ECAUSE of an impasse in nego
tiations over proper compensa
tion for expropriated oil properties,
Mexico and then Great Britain over
the week-end severed diplomatic re
lations. Last night "authoritative
British quarters" said that any in
itiative for resumption of relations
must come from Mexico.
Surprisingly candid, the editors
of Britain's "disciplined" popu
lar press admitted that the sup
posed reason for the suspension
of relations—the refusal of Mex
ico to pay a claims annuity of
only $85,000—was not the real one,
but that the move was the most
effective pressure for the grant
ing of "satisfaction" to Britain on
the oil issue.

Whether or not the Supreme
r j>urt is now engaged in turning
/rom a liberal to its customary con
servative position will be determined
in its decision expected today, on the
constitutionality of the Tennessee
Valley authority power program.
The issue to be decided, in a
case brought by 18 Southern pow
er companies, is whether the TVA
lias become a power-generating
agency competing with private
utilities, or must remain a flood
control and water-conservation
agency.
