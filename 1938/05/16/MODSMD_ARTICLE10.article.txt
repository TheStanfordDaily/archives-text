Landis Speaks
Arriving from the East at 8:15

Harvard Law School, was the guest
of honor at a special luncheon given

: was delivered by Edgar E. Robinson,
professor of history, on "Democracy,
Then and Now," in which he traced
the development of democracy in
this country, analyzed the present
attacks and vulnerable positions in
which it now stands, and declared
that its future rests in the accept
ance of the ideal of progress.
Management Challenged
"Management today is challenged
as it probably has never been be
fore," according to Paul E. Holden,
professor of industrial management
in the Business School. "From the
point of view of the problems faced,
the period of the depression did not
present a situation as troubling as
that which faces business executives
at the present time," he said.
Deploring the misunderstanding
among political leaders of the real
problems of agriculture, Joseph S.
Davis, director of the Food Re
search Institute, analyzed such cur
rent factors as the AAA and the
"parity price"; called for the aban
donment of many such methods and
a more fundamental knowledge of
the complexity of our agricultural
set-up.
"For any permanent prosperity the
business community and the public
authorities must be able to co
operate" advised Philip W. Buck,
Assistant Professor of Political Sci
ence.
