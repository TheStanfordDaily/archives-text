"How Our Medieval Ancestors
Learned to Keep Warm," is to be
discussed by Dr. Lynn T. White Jr.,
of the Stanford history department,
over KGO this evening at 9:15
o'clock on the Stanford University
Radio Hour.
Dr. White points out that although
most people believe that the Middle
Ages contributed but little to man's
comfort, practically all the devices
now used for keeping warm were the
result of this period. He will de
scribe how such conveniences as
warm clothing, snug architecture,
the fireplace, and distilled liquors
came during the medieval period.
"All the main devices for keeping
warm which we enjoy today were
unknown in Roman times, and were
developed during the Middle Ages,"
he says. "After the Germanic in
vasions the artistic and decorative
garments and homes of antiquity
were displaced by warmer and more
practical clothing and dwellings.'
"The chimney, fireplace, and hot
air stone made it possible for the
first time to heat small dwellings
efficiently and without smoke, and
finally the Middle Ages learned how
to stimulate the circulation of the
blood by means of distilled liquors.
"In the last four centuries we have
simply perfected the medieval de
vices for keeping warm, but have
invented no new ones.
