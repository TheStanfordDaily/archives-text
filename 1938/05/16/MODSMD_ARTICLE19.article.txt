Addresses Alumni
Dean Landis was brought to the
campus by the Stanford Associates
and the Committee on Public Ex
ercises, and his first addrass was be
fore the concluding banquet of the
sixth annual Stanford Alumni Con
ference yesterday.
Wl">n interviewed upon arrival
here ye.stc . day, expressed ap
proval of the growth and import
ance of the quasi-judicial commis
sion in the administrative depart-
I ment of government.
Specifically commenting upon the
recent decision of the Supreme
Court in the "Second Morgan Case,"
he said that many have tried to read
a reversal of opinion into the court's
decision, but that he did not believe
this was necessarily true.
'No Effect'
Rather, he explained, the com
missions would be forced merely to
cease the use of "short-cuts" in
their investigations and decisions.
As to the recent Richard Whitney
i case, the former chairman of the Se
jcurities and Exchange Commission
| declined to express an opinion.
"There is no point in bringing
j (hat up," he said, "inasmuch as I am
j no longer involved."
I Pro-New Deal sympathies were
j expressed by Dean Landis as he ex
| plained that "critics of the older
i monopoly have seized upon the
growth of administrative law and
have overemphasized its importance
as in the Morgan case."
Dean Landis, who arrived at the
San Fvaneisco Airport from Boston
early yesterday morning, will leave
Palo Alto for Boston early this aft
ernoon, again by plane.
