# Superman Crosby Slops Roble Din
## 
### 
Bing Crosby, even when he is
400* miles away, can do for Roble
what al\ the head sponsors, spon
sors, directors, or even the foot
ball-playing hashers can't do—he
can quiet its clattering dinner
time din.
Not another Encina, but noisy
enough in its own right, Roble is
a peaceful, quiet place every
Thursday night at dinner time
when Crosby is broadcasting.
Until recently it was a quiet
place because many of the wom
en diners weren't there. They
were in their rooms listening to
the radio. But recently the radio
in one of the lobbies has been
turned on so that people in the
main lobby have been able to
hear Crosby's crooning while
they cat.
Head sponsors haven't thought
yet of playing Crosby records at
dinner during the other six nights
of the week, or at lunch time.
