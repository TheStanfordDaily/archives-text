# Alumni Croup Hears Landis On Regulation
## Harvard Dean Sees Rise of Collectivism In American Scene 
### 
Approval of the growth and ac
ceptance of administrative regula
tion as a part of the federal govern
ment was expressed by Dean James
M. Landis of the Harvard Law
School yesterday, when he spoke at
the final banquet of the sixth an
nual Stanford Alumni Conference.
"The rise of the regulatory proc
ess threatens, and rightly threatens,
the older monopoly that attended
the dispensation of justice in the
American scene," he said, as a con
clusion of his discussion of "The
Role of Law in Regulation."
Regulation Conscious
'Today no casual observer of the
American political scene can be un
aware of how conscious we are of
the fact of regulation," he said.
"That fact, of course, outwardly
marks the passing of our national
political and economic philosophy
from the realm of nineteenth cen
tury laissez faire to one still name
less, but which some future historian
might call twentieth century col
lectivism."
Public consciousness of govern
mental regulation is due to the com
paratively recent intervention of the
federal government in fields already
dominated by state governments, he
explained.
Tells of Beginning
Growth and subsequent import
ance of administrative regulation
through quasi-judicial bodies start
ed when "a nation, desperate with
the problems, that a post-war dec
ade had fastened upon it, turned in
a wholesale manner to the admin
istrative approach in its effort to
find some pathway to recovery and
safety," he said.
Approach of the courts to modern
problems has been marked by a
difference in temper, Dean Landis
feels.
As to the position of regulation
today, he argued that "this process
is the chief mechanism of govern
ment in the reconciliation of claims.
'Central Concern'
"Hie enormous increase in inter
dependence of our society makes this
task of resolution the central con
cern of government.
"Regulatory mechanism has be
come essential to the maintenance
and evolution of our modern liber
ties. Its perfectability thus must
become our aim, for it now holds so
greatly the possibility of attain
ment of those priceless ideals of
AmericanÂ«life-ideals that have re
gard, of course, to justice under the
law but also to law as the hand
maiden of justice," he concluded.
