# Earthquake Follows Start of Humor Group
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
At 5:30 o'clock in the morning,
April 17, 190G, San Francisco and
vicinity shook with the tremors of
the great San Francisco earthquake.
Four and a half hours earlier, at a
1 o'clock bull session, that tumult
out morning, Stanford quivered im
perceptibly as Hammer and Coffin,
honorary humor magazine society,
was born. It was the brainchild of
Morris Oppenheim, '05, at present a
prominent San Francisco attorney.
Seven years earlier, the Chapar
ral, founded by Bristow Adams,
now a Cornell professor, had em
barked upon its career. By 1006 it
was one of three campus publica
tions, with D.P.A. (Dippy) or Daily
Palo Alto and a now extinct liter
ary magazine, the 'Sequoia," com
prising the other two.
All three of these were published
by a group called the Stanford Press
Club. Hammer and Coffin was
formed with the idea of giving
1 Chappie publication into Chappie
hands.
At the time of its formation, all
previous members of the Chappie
staff were automatically admitted
into the organization. Since then,
members of the edit and managerial
staff spontaneously have become
members, with the remaining body
elected from those outstanding on
the Chappie staff.
For 13 years alter its development
Hammer and Coffin handled the
publication of the Chappie. In 1919
the next step was made when the
society became national with the
addition of the Washington "Sun
dodger" (now the Washington "Col
umns") to society ranks. The Cal J
"Pelican" and the Arizona "Kitty-
Kat" are now members of the humor
organization.
In the ranks of over 400 Stanford !
graduate members, the society boasts j
many greats and near-greats. Nor- I
man H. Davis, ambassador-at-large ;
for the United States, is a member, !
as is Bruce Bliven, editor of "New
Republic." North Cottely, President ;
Wilbur's secretary when Dr. Wilbur j
was Secretary of the Interior, and at >
present the law partner of Patrick j
Hurley, ex-secretary of war, is an- I
other member, while Herbert Hoo- !
ver, Jr., also wears the insignia of
the group.
Strangely enough, journalism ma
jors rarely are members. Law

graduates, econ majors, history stu
dents, all Â»vie for the honors, with
the embryo lawmen maintaining a
slight lead in numbers.
Chaparral editor automatically
becomes the president of the local
chapter, while the business man
ager becomes the vice-president.
The secretary-treasurer is chosen
from the members-at-large.
