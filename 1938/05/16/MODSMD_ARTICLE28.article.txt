# Many Campus Dances Held Over Week-end
## 
### 
Reacting to a mid-spring quarter
'full moon, Stanford became a coun
try club with only slight academic
overtones over the week-end.
Neglecting even the usual week
end bull session on women (or
men), politics, and philosophy, most
of the campus went dancing, some
of it went away for the week-endâ€”
but not to study.
Friday night there were 11 Farm
dances including Stanford night at
the Mark Hopkins where several
Spring Show songs were played by
Anson Week's orchestra and sung
| by Spring Show cast members.
The dances ranged from costume
through informal to formal occas
ions. Most of them were held on
the campus.
Disguising themselves in costumes
and grease paint or burnt cork, the
Sigma Nus, Kappa Sigs, Phi Sigs,
| Theta Delts. and Theta Chis held

Spanish, Pirate, Jail, Bohemian, and '
Ship parties respectively.
Holding their ninth annual South
Seas formal, the Alpha Sigs mixed
formals with a palmy atmosphere
and assorted pirates, jailbirds, Span
iards, etc., from other dances.
Less bizarre were the informal
dances held by Encina, Lagunita,
the Married Men's Club dance, and
! the off-campus Theta Xi dance.
Going back to the bizarre Satur- j
day night were the Tri-Delts with
| their sports dance. The Dee Gees, j
not content with but one night of
spring quarter full-mooning, went j
to Carmel en masse for the week- i
end, while the Cap and Gown so
ciety went to Santa Cruz, also for j
the week-end.
At one time it was a capital of- |
fense to kill a sacred Egypt. '
