'INHERE are a lot of considerations
that enter into the basketball
coach situation, many of which
haven't been aired very much. Be
hind the effort on the part of mem
bers of the graduating team to get
H. B. Lee appointed new head coach
lies quite a bit of sound logic.
In spite of what the Coast is go
ing to think next basketball season
—about Stanford losing Luisetti and
hence being doomed to ignominy for
another few seasons — Stanford is
going to have, potentially, the
strongest team on the Pacific Slope.
And that goes with the considera
tion that Tom Siebert is not going
to be available—it was found that
he can't play basketball and keep
up with the books, so he's gone for
a year, anyway.
But the prospects of the team
(hat will include Burncss, David
son. Zonne, Dick Lyon, lluddlcson,
and a flock of others are very
bright. Even Oregon, with that
erackcrjack team of last season,
has no better prospects. The bas
is for the desire to have 11. B. Lee
named coach was that to hire an
outside coach, with a different
system which he would have to
teach these kids grounded in the
Bunn system, would tend to break
the enthusiasm that's hound to
come from the underdog position
Stanford will have next winter.
Unless the new coach has a glow
ing personality with which he can
capture the spirit of the new team,
which is going to be very largely
sophomores, he may, through no
fault of his own, cause the Cards to
lose some of the natural enthusiasm
they will have in starting a new era.
To have Beebs as coach would be
to insure a spirited, laughing team,
if nothing else. Lee knows his bas
ketball, as John Bunn himself will
readily agree, but there are many
other considerations — such as the
need for the dignity that comes only
from several years of experience—
that dinged the selection of Lee.
With the field narrowed down to
Dean of Indiana and Iluhhard of
San Jose State, it is to he hoped
that each of these men is capable
of making the transition from
Bunn's system of play to his own
easily and smoothly, should he be
chosen.
Dean's system is the old, estab
lished style of play that has made
mid-Western basketball the bulwark
of the sport in the nation. Strict
man-to-man defense and methodi
cal offense characterize it. Hub
bard's style is closer to the Bunn
style, if that means anything. He
employed a defense last year that
was identical with the Stanford de
fense, and his offense methods cen
tered around the fundamental move
ment used by John Bunn — the
guard-through.
It is reasonably certain that Hub
bard would have less mechanical
difficulty than Dean in changing over
the Indian basketballers to his own
ideas. Which man would have the
most success in leading the mental
processes of the players through the
right channels would be hard to
judge without a personal acquaint
ance with both men.
The 8.A.C., which is a body that
hasn't gained a reputation for mak
ing many mistakes, thought it best
to choose a man with more experi
ence than Lee, and it considered just
about all the angles. The selection
of Lee had its points, though, and it
wasn't just a wild idea concocted by
a bunch of rah-rah boys.

up with the books, so he's gone for
a year, anyway.
But the prospects of the team
(hat will include Burncss, David
son. Zonne, Dick Lyon, lluddlcson,
and a flock of others are very
bright. Even Oregon, with that
erackcrjack team of last season,
has no better prospects. The bas
is for the desire to have 11. B. Lee
named coach was that to hire an
outside coach, with a different
system which he would have to
teach these kids grounded in the
Bunn system, would tend to break
the enthusiasm that's hound to
come from the underdog position
Stanford will have next winter.
Unless the new coach has a glow
ing personality with which he can
capture the spirit of the new team,
which is going to be very largely
sophomores, he may, through no
fault of his own, cause the Cards to
lose some of the natural enthusiasm
they will have in starting a new era.
To have Beebs as coach would be
to insure a spirited, laughing team,
if nothing else. Lee knows his bas
ketball, as John Bunn himself will
readily agree, but there are many
other considerations — such as the
need for the dignity that comes only
from several years of experience—
that dinged the selection of Lee.
With the field narrowed down to
Dean of Indiana and Iluhhard of
San Jose State, it is to he hoped
that each of these men is capable
of making the transition from
Bunn's system of play to his own
easily and smoothly, should he be
chosen.
Dean's system is the old, estab
lished style of play that has made
mid-Western basketball the bulwark
of the sport in the nation. Strict
man-to-man defense and methodi
cal offense characterize it. Hub
bard's style is closer to the Bunn
style, if that means anything. He
employed a defense last year that
was identical with the Stanford de
fense, and his offense methods cen
tered around the fundamental move
ment used by John Bunn — the
guard-through.
It is reasonably certain that Hub
bard would have less mechanical
difficulty than Dean in changing over
the Indian basketballers to his own
ideas. Which man would have the
most success in leading the mental
processes of the players through the
right channels would be hard to
judge without a personal acquaint
ance with both men.
The 8.A.C., which is a body that
hasn't gained a reputation for mak
ing many mistakes, thought it best
to choose a man with more experi
ence than Lee, and it considered just
about all the angles. The selection
of Lee had its points, though, and it
wasn't just a wild idea concocted by
a bunch of rah-rah boys.

ing personality with which he can
capture the spirit of the new team,
which is going to be very largely
sophomores, he may, through no
fault of his own, cause the Cards to
lose some of the natural enthusiasm
they will have in starting a new era.
To have Beebs as coach would be
to insure a spirited, laughing team,
if nothing else. Lee knows his bas
ketball, as John Bunn himself will
readily agree, but there are many
other considerations — such as the
need for the dignity that comes only
from several years of experience—
that dinged the selection of Lee.
With the field narrowed down to
Dean of Indiana and Iluhhard of
San Jose State, it is to he hoped
that each of these men is capable
of making the transition from
Bunn's system of play to his own
easily and smoothly, should he be
chosen.
Dean's system is the old, estab
lished style of play that has made
mid-Western basketball the bulwark
of the sport in the nation. Strict
man-to-man defense and methodi
cal offense characterize it. Hub
bard's style is closer to the Bunn
style, if that means anything. He
employed a defense last year that
was identical with the Stanford de
fense, and his offense methods cen
tered around the fundamental move
ment used by John Bunn — the
guard-through.
It is reasonably certain that Hub
bard would have less mechanical
difficulty than Dean in changing over
the Indian basketballers to his own
ideas. Which man would have the
most success in leading the mental
processes of the players through the
right channels would be hard to
judge without a personal acquaint
ance with both men.
The 8.A.C., which is a body that
hasn't gained a reputation for mak
ing many mistakes, thought it best
to choose a man with more experi
ence than Lee, and it considered just
about all the angles. The selection
of Lee had its points, though, and it
wasn't just a wild idea concocted by
a bunch of rah-rah boys.

facts: Baylor Maynard,
Belmont High, Los Angeles, who
has pole-vaulted 13 feet 9 inches
this year for a new world inter
scholastic record, was on the field
at the Fresno Relays in a U.S.C.
uniform. Nice work, Cromwell. . . .
Clyde Jeffrey, Riverside J. C. sprint
er who tied the national junior col
lege 100 record of :9.G at the Relays,
was coming to the campus this
week-end at the invitation of the
Toros. Somehow he missed his
train and went to L. A. instead, at
the invitation of U.S.C. Not bad,
Cromwell, either .... The National
Italian-American Civic League
named Ennio Arboit of Notre Dame
the outstanding Italian-American
all-around athlete of the year Sat
urday, with Hank Luisetti second.
Arboit must have been pretty good
in his sports, football and baseball,
