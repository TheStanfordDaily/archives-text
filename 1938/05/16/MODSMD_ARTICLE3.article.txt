# Home Drive Falls $1200 Short of Goal
## Thompson Sets Final Figure for Campaign At 24-Day Quota 
### 
Winding up with a total $1200
short of last year's mark, the Con
valescent Home Drive will have
brought in only about $4900 when
bills have been paid and a few
more dollars outstanding have come
in, announced Treasurer Roy
Thompson last night.
Quota „this year was $6144 —
enough money to operate the Home
one month. Actual collections will
operate the institution only about
24 days.
Genius Would Know
"If anyone knew why we didn't
go over the top he'd be a genius,"
Thompson declared yesterday.
Opining the current business re
cession had little to do with the
drive's short-coming this year, he
pointed out that most students have
a fairly constant income from home.
"It just wasn't in the kids this
year to give the way they did last
year, I guess," said Thompson.
"They have been hit by the Red
Cross drive and the Senior Endow
ment Fund drive. And money is be
ginning to get pretty low by spring
quarter anyhow."
Not Best Time
It was his opinion that spring
quarter is not the best time for the
annual drive, because this is the
time of year when students are
boating, going to the city, and being
assessed more than usual by their
fraternities.
"On the other hand," he said, "the
bad weather during winter quarter
would make Labor Day and Straw
berry Brunch practically impos
sible."
Comparison of this year's statis
tics with last, shows living group
contributions to be the item that
dropped more than any other.
Fraternity Contributions
Fraternities showed the greatest
drop, this year's total being less than
one-third of last year's. Only five of
the men's houses showed increases
this year, Alpha Sig giving 13 cents
more than last year and Phi Psi
$1.30 more.
Delta Chi, K.A., and Phi Sig in
creased their contributions some
what more significantly. An example
of a large drop in amount is Kappa
Sig's record—sBs last year, $15 this
year. Zete dropped from $52.64 to
$13.80.
Men's halls and clubs were an
other slash off last year's mark, drop
ping to less than half of the former
figure. Encina fell farthest, con
tributing $60.24 as compared with
$219.41 last year. Sequoia gave
$32.07 last year, none this year, ac
cording to the treasurer's records.
Other Losses
Women's halls dropped to little
over one-third of last year's amount,
Roble showing the greatest de
crease—s4Bl.l4 last year, $47.94 this
year.
Sororities were the only group of
living groups showing no great drop.
This year they gave $404.39, as com
pared with $408.94 last year.
Thompson said he hoped next
year's drive committees could profit
by any mistakes that may have
been made this year.
