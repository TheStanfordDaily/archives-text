# Troy Romps to Relays Triumph
## S. C. Breaks World Relay Mark in 440 Indians Take Third Behind Bears; Malott Runs Fast Relay Lap 
### 
Southern Calif or n i a's Trojan
horde, greatest collection of collegi
ate talent in the world today, swept
the field clean in Saturday's West
Coast Relays at Fresno.
Coach Dean Cromwell's charges
won four out of the five relay events,
although one victory was taken
from them because of illegal passing
of the baton, and also nabbed first
places in five of the eight open
events, to score 71Va points.
California followed with 46 1/3
digits, with Stanford nosing out U.C.
L.A. for third. Stanford scored
29 1/3 to the Bruins' 18. Other points
were as follows: Idaho, 6; Fresno
4 1/3; San Jose State, 3 , : >; Cal Ag
gies, 3; Redlands, 2; San Diego, 2.
Indians Win One
The Dink Templetonmen were
limited to one fluke victory in their
unsuccessful quest to retain the
championship gained from the Tro
jans last year. That victory came in
the 880-yard relay when S. C., the
winner, was disqualified. Running
for the Indians were Ray Malott,
Stan Hiserman, Dick Carew, and
Jerry Sparling.
Captain Malott turned in the
Farm's most sparking performance
when he was timed in 4G.7 for his
anchor lap of the mile relay, in which
Stanford took third.
Stanford's performances in the !
open events were just fair, although ;
Bill Braheny hurled the javelin 192
feet—the best any Indian has done
this season—but not good enough
for a place.
The Trojan sprint relay quartet
chalked up a new world record in
the event when Leland La Fond,
Mickey Anderson, Payton Jordan,
and Adrian Talley whipped through
in 40.5, to clip two-tenths off the for
mer record, which was made by
another Trojan team in 1936.
Meet records fell all along the line
in the other events. Two Stanford
marks were among the wrecked rec
ords. Last year's two-mile relay
team of Alexander, March, Mahurin,
and McCurdy set up one short-lived
standard, California snagging an
easy victory in 7:41.9, which clipped
considerably the Card mark of
7:45.1.
Adrian Talley of U.S.C. turned in
the best performance in the open
events when he sped to a 9.5 victory
in the 100-yard dash. Another Tro
jan. Louis Zamperini was clocked
in under 4:13 for his lap of the med
ley relay.

Indians Win One
The Dink Templetonmen were
limited to one fluke victory in their
unsuccessful quest to retain the
championship gained from the Tro
jans last year. That victory came in
the 880-yard relay when S. C., the
winner, was disqualified. Running
for the Indians were Ray Malott,
Stan Hiserman, Dick Carew, and
Jerry Sparling.
Captain Malott turned in the
Farm's most sparking performance
when he was timed in 4G.7 for his
anchor lap of the mile relay, in which
Stanford took third.
Stanford's performances in the !
open events were just fair, although ;
Bill Braheny hurled the javelin 192
feet—the best any Indian has done
this season—but not good enough
for a place.
The Trojan sprint relay quartet
chalked up a new world record in
the event when Leland La Fond,
Mickey Anderson, Payton Jordan,
and Adrian Talley whipped through
in 40.5, to clip two-tenths off the for
mer record, which was made by
another Trojan team in 1936.
Meet records fell all along the line
in the other events. Two Stanford
marks were among the wrecked rec
ords. Last year's two-mile relay
team of Alexander, March, Mahurin,
and McCurdy set up one short-lived
standard, California snagging an
easy victory in 7:41.9, which clipped
considerably the Card mark of
7:45.1.
Adrian Talley of U.S.C. turned in
the best performance in the open
events when he sped to a 9.5 victory
in the 100-yard dash. Another Tro
jan. Louis Zamperini was clocked
in under 4:13 for his lap of the med

Indians Win One
The Dink Templetonmen were
limited to one fluke victory in their
unsuccessful quest to retain the
championship gained from the Tro
jans last year. That victory came in
the 880-yard relay when S. C., the
winner, was disqualified. Running
for the Indians were Ray Malott,
Stan Hiserman, Dick Carew, and
Jerry Sparling.
Captain Malott turned in the
Farm's most sparking performance
when he was timed in 4G.7 for his
anchor lap of the mile relay, in which
Stanford took third.
Stanford's performances in the !
open events were just fair, although ;
Bill Braheny hurled the javelin 192
feet—the best any Indian has done
this season—but not good enough
for a place.
The Trojan sprint relay quartet
chalked up a new world record in
the event when Leland La Fond,
Mickey Anderson, Payton Jordan,
and Adrian Talley whipped through
in 40.5, to clip two-tenths off the for
mer record, which was made by
another Trojan team in 1936.
Meet records fell all along the line
in the other events. Two Stanford
marks were among the wrecked rec
ords. Last year's two-mile relay
team of Alexander, March, Mahurin,
and McCurdy set up one short-lived
standard, California snagging an
easy victory in 7:41.9, which clipped
considerably the Card mark of
7:45.1.
Adrian Talley of U.S.C. turned in
the best performance in the open
events when he sped to a 9.5 victory
in the 100-yard dash. Another Tro
jan. Louis Zamperini was clocked
in under 4:13 for his lap of the med
