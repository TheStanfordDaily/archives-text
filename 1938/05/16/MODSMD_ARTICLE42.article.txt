# Chappie's All Right
## 
### 
ONE of the staff woke me up at noon Friday
for lunch, and to return a blucbook from
my 10 o'clock class.
"Have you seen Chappie yet?"
"Well, hardly."
"It's very funny; it has a razz edition of The
Daily in it. Here, look."
I agreed. It was funny, in fact, it was price
less.
"Well, what are you going to do about it?"
"Nothing, probably; it would sound like
sour grapes."
"Why don't you say you could put out a
better razz sheet only the Administration ban
ned Daily razz sheets a while back."
"Why?"
"Well, you could say that Chappie ought to
do this every month so it would have some
thing funny in it."
"It has something funny in it every month."
"I don't know what it is. Why don't you
put out a razz of Chappie with a lot of stuff
clipped from other college papers."
"That wouldn't be very funny."
"Well, why don't you just say that this
shows that Chappie usually isn't funny, and
that it ought to find out just exactly what it is
instead of running a conglomeration of re
views, clipped jokes, and simple stories. And
why don't you blast that Little Popoff thing."
"Because Chappie follows the usual humor
magazine content and probably is better than
most. It's humor is formalized but good if
you're in the mood. Besides, Chappie makes
money as it is now."
