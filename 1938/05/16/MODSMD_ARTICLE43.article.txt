# Man of Letters

UNLESS our usually reliable straws in the
wind have missed their cue, Dean James
M. Landis of the Harvard Law School will
draw a good-sized student audience when he
speaks here today.
If he does, the University can conclude that
in its policy of picking speakers it has found
the range and can now open up with the whole
battery.
Landis has two qualifications which will
make him popular both with students and with
professors. He is a scholar. And he is also
"practical" man with a reputation. His schol
astic background is enough to make any pro
fessor beam at the thought of hearing him.
His fame as a "brain-truster" and a bearder
of capitalists in their Wall Street dens is
enough to lure students away from the Cellar.
Intellectually, he is a two-letter man. And
as any student politician will admit, two-letter
men are always popular.â€”J. C.
