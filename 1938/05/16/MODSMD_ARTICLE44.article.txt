# Tracking the Beefs
## 
### 
SIX dash-men spring from their marks with
the bang of the starter's gun. At the tape,
high administration official X of Stanford, and
Y of California strain their eyes to pick the
winner. When the runners flash by, X has
picked a California man, and Y a Stanford
man. The second-place pickers decide the out
come of the race.
Such an incident is not hypothetical. It ac
tually happened several years back at a Big
Meet. And it is typical of the cause of much
after-meet moaning, such as went on in the
city papers after the S.C.-Stanford meet. In
most cses, the beefs between players and
coachs re made into downright charges of
dishonesty by sports writers in search of color.
Usually, when they are run down, the diffi
culties really have arisen because the offi
cials handling the meet were inexperienced
or incompetent.
According to long-time starter, "Red" Kelley,
most college track meets have but one or two
qualified referees working. The rest of the
judging is done by junior managers, faculty
members, or anyone else handy. While there
are few cases v/here too much school spirit
decides a close event, it is more of a trick to
call a race accurately than most people realize.
All the honesty in the world can't mak up for
experience in this case.
Kelley would like to see all officiating han
dled as it is in football, from a central ap
pointment bureau, and from a list of compe
tent men. But it probably would be enough if
competing universities would agree before
hand on an enlarged staff of bona fide offi
cials. With a little doubling up, it would take

only a few more than work a meet now to put
a professional at each event. Such an agree
ment might add a bit to B.A.C. budgets, but
at least anxious spectators would know that an
important event was not being judged by some
high school kid. And it would take most of
the teeth out of after-meet back-bitings.—J. S.
