# Groups by the Bushel
## 
### 
HALF a dozen assorted "fellowship groups"
came out of the dialectic backwoods not
long ago and had their existence announced
in The Daily. We were a little surprised at this
Enoch Arden reappearance. We had thought
that stories about fellowship groups were
simply capitalistic propaganda like the legends
of fairy godmothers and beautiful princesses.
But the dramatic return of the groups reminds
us that there are a number of other societies
which have dropped out of sight. There is
Phi Phi, senior honorary fraternity. And there
are a dozen or so other honorary socie.irs or
discussion groups hibernating somewhere.
Most of these societies do nothing. They
drowse quietly, content with the simple fact
of existence.
We do not suggest that Stanford would be a
better and finer place if all these societies got
to work. But we can remember a long line of
organizations that withered away because they
did nothing.
Perhaps our dormant societies could profit
by the example of the fellowship groups and
come out of their hermitage. In this candle
power-conscious age there is no market for
lights hidden under bushels.â€”J. C.
