# BULL SESSION
## VARGAS THE VALIANT 
### 
JJRAZIL 'S Getulio Vargas is a hero, now. Because
he joined in the fighting aroynd the presidential
palace when it was attacked last week by the fascist
Integralistas, he has moved onto the front pages of the
world and into the upper crust ot international states
men. He has proved his right to enter polite political
society. He is applauded. He has arrived.
When he first came to power in his bloodless coup
of last November, however, things were somewhat
different. He was regarded upstart, a fascist, a
South American caudillo turned European Duce. Lib
eral opinion around the world talked confidently of
another democracy—since Brazil, while no democracy,
was still no rigid dictatorship.
His actions at the time did nothing to remove the
stigma commentators were so quick to place upon his
name. He announced his friendliness to fascist princi
ples; he was hailed by the fascist press. The destruc
tion of Brazilian liberties, never very great, and the
possible extension of the Rome-Berlin axis to South
America seemed practically assured.

B U ,T presently the tide began to turn. President
Vargas began to be respectable. All foreign lan
guage groups were banned in Brazil. The teaching of
foreign ideologies was banned in Brazil. A strong
policy was adopted toward the German schools in the
southern part of the country; and the president gen
erally gave notice that his dictatorship was his dictator
ship and nobody else's. Last week's suppression of
the Integralista revolt came on top of a series of acts
pointing toward complete removal of all foreign in
fluences in his country.
In Washington, this probably comes as a welcome
relief. It may not be altogether wise for the good
neighbor policy to allow the establishment of a strong
government in the largest nation in the Western Hemi
sphere, but it is good assurance to have the govern
ment, since it seems inevitable, established on an inde
pendent basis, with no strings stretching back to Rome,
no tie-ins with Berlin.
The place the Latin Americas will play in the future
will probably be a very important one; and it is com
forting to realize that Getulio Vargas for one, is de
termined that they will not be the battle-ground for a
war between opposing ideologies.—Allen Drury.
