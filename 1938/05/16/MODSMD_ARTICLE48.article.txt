H OT , Club! Yea, pops!
And tomorrow evening around 7 o'clock in the
Nifery a few of the local cats will attempt to get to
gether and organize a Stanford chapter of the United
Hot Clubs of America.
The purpose of these little groups is to organize
the cats into a get-together where they can talk swing
to their hearts' content, play their favorite records,
and bull about the respective merits of Dixieland and
Chicago styles.
In other schools, this club has been instrumental
(no pun intended) in Retting some of the better swing
musicians to play for the school proms, and has given
a dccidcd psychological value of keeping out the vari
ous icky bands whose sobbing tones have been known
to drive the jitterbugs mad. Swing sessions aren't
unknown among the hot club devotees, and the or
ganizers feel that there shouldn't be any line drawn
between the players and the alligators (non-players).
So if you are really interested, drop around tomor
row night and join the cats for a little screamin'.

jVOW for a few words on some of the bands. We
can't help but give a little plug to the "Skinnay
Ennis" outfit. Skinnay, as you know, was with Hal
Kemp as a featured vocalist and a drummer for years.
After having split up with Kemp, he went looking for
a band, and stumbled over Gil Evans, who was in a
rut at the time. Joining forces, Ennis and Evans have
put together a little outfit that is sweet, but still the
boys haven't forgotten to swing out, and they are rem
iniscent of some of the earlier Casa Loma stuff that is
still tops.
At present the boys are airing out of the Victor
j Hugo, with a national hookup three times weekly, and
j we like to think that this band is a result of the trend
toward swing, but soft. Pat McGuirk.
