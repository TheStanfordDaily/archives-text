# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHO ARE YOU? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
And who are you and who is the
B.AjC. that say it "won't work."
And he who runs may now read
that it is not the kids we care about,
but the winning of the game that
counts.
And that is part and parcel of the
"Essence of Pure Bunk" which is
"It is not the money we care about
—it's the principle of the thing."
And you would inhibit every na
tural and normal and laudible im
pulse of the kids to the end that the
God of Conference Standing be ap
peased.
And let me tell you something,
but don't breathe it to a soul because
it might lose a game: Progress comes
through minorities—not majorities.
And who am I who thinks it
would work and that it is a "damn
shame" that you haven't the cour
age to try it and who thinks his
thinking is just as good as the think
ing of the Daily and the 8.A.C.?
—Just an old broken down
Advertiser.
