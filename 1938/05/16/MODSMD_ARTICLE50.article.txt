The Editor, Sir:
Dear Friend in mutual sympathetic
amusement:
The parody of The Stanford Daily
included in the most recent issue of
The Chaparral has been called to
our attention. May we extend to
you an excellent opportunity, that
of consoling your heavy heart with
but one balm. The Stanford Daily
has never, does not, and shows no
intention of ever recognizing in the
future, that all-permeating stench,
Little Pop-Off.
Yours in a distinct feeling of su
periority, and a complete realizing
of the impregnability of our position,
—Carl E. Deisenroth.
Russian supplies reach China over
a new highway 3000 miles long.
