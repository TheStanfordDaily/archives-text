# Smooth Plot Only Blessing Of Picture

Four Men and a Prayer, currently
playing at the Fox-Stanford, will
no doubt go down the drain with
other hokum of the same order. But
the yarn is well-plotted enough to
keep an audience hopping for a
couple of hours.
A British attache is court-mar-

tialed on a frame
up and shut by a
ring of munitions
makers. His four
sons track down
the crook by pick
ing up clues in
India, South Am
erica, and Egypt.
'Meanwhile, Lor
etta Young, an
American heiress,
trails along after
them—all the time
unaware that her
daddy is head of

the beastly munitions firm.
The story itself is nothing Achmed
Abdullah hasn't done better for Lib
erty magazine. The chance it offers
the actors is nil. And for a mystery
to pose in the first place as first
class film material is a jackdaw's
strut. But one event tumbled- so
casually after another—the off-hand
manner of narration so prevents any
melodrama from slopping over, that
the whole thing has the look of ur
banity. Slick and shallow, all right,
it is not silly.—Slater.
The Angels Camp frog-jumping
contest will be held on May .14.
