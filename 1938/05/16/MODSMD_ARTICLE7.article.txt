# Birnbaum Fits Spring Show Music to Mood
## 
### PARK KIMBALL 
"Arrangements by Birnbaum."
This bit of information printed on "Is Europe?" programs will consti
tute most of the fanfare that Myron Birnbaum, law student, will receive
for one of the most painstaking, exacting, and important jobs to be carried
out in staging a musical production.
It is his task, after the music is submitted by the writers, to orchestrate

it; that is, to write the parts for
instrument in the orchestra and co
ordinate the whole.
This entails knowledge of a maze
of intricacies such as the range of
each instrument, the tone properties,
the type of music to which each is
adapted, which instruments will
blend pleasingly with one another,
the personal ability of each player
to make allowance for solo work,
and, most important, to be able to
heai', mentally, how the combined
and finished product will sound.
Knowledge Needed
Law work coming first, he must
devote all of his spare time to the
arrangements, v*hich he may be
seen diligently writing and copying
in the Old Roble Gym, the Cellar, or
almost anyplace that he can rest
his manuscript.
When anyone interrupts him, he
will absently murmur, "B flat, C
sharp, fortissimo, um-dee-dee-dum
de—uh? What?"
Works at Rehearsals
He does his work during the busi
est rehearsals, in the midst of the
most discordant noises without in
convenience, but the moment some
one sings or whistles he must stop.
It throws him off key. Doing his
work in odd places at odd times, he
must necessarily do without a piano
or other instrument to guide him.
When asked how he does this
Birnbaum answers enigmatically,
"Do you have to talk out loud when
you write a letter? In my music,
I just know what I want and write
it down!"
Variety and originality is the key
note of his work. In arranging the
nine tunes for"Is Europe?" he has
integrated the music with the show
for the first time in a Stanford pro
duction. That he has used integra
tion, means that he has written the
music to fit each separate part of
the show. In this way, the same
number in several separate parts of
the show will sound different each
time it is played. This means that
the music must often be transposed
into different keys, which he must
be able to do without any instru
ment guide.
Into the Spring Show musical ar
rangements, Birnbaum has written
special parts for two very capable
instrumentalists appearing with the
accompanying orchestra, Les Le
Tours on the trumpet, and John j
Barboli on the clarinet. He also has 1
arranged that the Spring Show shall
have music to satisfy everyone, i
into his music he has incorporated
swing, sweet and smooth, hot stuff, i
and blues, in styles ranging from
Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsay
to Gilbert and Sullivan.
"It is criminal," he expounded,
"the way good songs from our shows
are played once or twice and for
gotten. Many, with a little plug
ging, would go over nationally. I
hope that someone will show good
sense in at least making recordings j
of the best of the present tunes."

This bit of information printed on "Is Europe?" programs will consti
tute most of the fanfare that Myron Birnbaum, law student, will receive
for one of the most painstaking, exacting, and important jobs to be carried
out in staging a musical production.
It is his task, after the music is submitted by the writers, to orchestrate

it; that is, to write the parts for
instrument in the orchestra and co
ordinate the whole.
This entails knowledge of a maze
of intricacies such as the range of
each instrument, the tone properties,
the type of music to which each is
adapted, which instruments will
blend pleasingly with one another,
the personal ability of each player
to make allowance for solo work,
and, most important, to be able to
heai', mentally, how the combined
and finished product will sound.
Knowledge Needed
Law work coming first, he must
devote all of his spare time to the
arrangements, v*hich he may be
seen diligently writing and copying
in the Old Roble Gym, the Cellar, or
almost anyplace that he can rest
his manuscript.
When anyone interrupts him, he
will absently murmur, "B flat, C
sharp, fortissimo, um-dee-dee-dum
de—uh? What?"
Works at Rehearsals
He does his work during the busi
est rehearsals, in the midst of the
most discordant noises without in
convenience, but the moment some
one sings or whistles he must stop.
It throws him off key. Doing his
work in odd places at odd times, he
must necessarily do without a piano
or other instrument to guide him.
When asked how he does this
Birnbaum answers enigmatically,
"Do you have to talk out loud when
you write a letter? In my music,
I just know what I want and write
it down!"
Variety and originality is the key
note of his work. In arranging the
nine tunes for"Is Europe?" he has
integrated the music with the show
for the first time in a Stanford pro
duction. That he has used integra
tion, means that he has written the
music to fit each separate part of
the show. In this way, the same
number in several separate parts of
the show will sound different each
time it is played. This means that
the music must often be transposed
into different keys, which he must
be able to do without any instru
ment guide.
Into the Spring Show musical ar
rangements, Birnbaum has written
special parts for two very capable
instrumentalists appearing with the
accompanying orchestra, Les Le
Tours on the trumpet, and John j
Barboli on the clarinet. He also has 1
arranged that the Spring Show shall
have music to satisfy everyone, i
into his music he has incorporated
swing, sweet and smooth, hot stuff, i
and blues, in styles ranging from
Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsay
to Gilbert and Sullivan.
"It is criminal," he expounded,
"the way good songs from our shows
are played once or twice and for
gotten. Many, with a little plug
ging, would go over nationally. I
hope that someone will show good
sense in at least making recordings j
of the best of the present tunes."
