### BILL MILLIS 
tradition of politics
imposes strong restraints upon
members of Parliament, which, as
in the case of the resignation of An
thony Eden as Foreign Secretary,
forced a considerable minority of the
Conservative members—who main
tained their nationalistic antipa
thies toward Germany, and could
not accept the supra-national class
prejudices of many British Tories
toward the Third Reich—into tag
ging along unprotestingly while the
Neville Chamberlain cabinet opened
its negotiations for the appeasement
of Adolf Hitler.
By refusing to split with their
party, the Conservative minority,
headed by ex-First Lord of the Ad
miralty Winston Churchill, made
impossible all efforts of the Liberal
and Labor Oppositions to provoke a
Cabinet crisis that could be settled
only in new general elections.

But all has not been going well
for Mr. Chamberlain, particularly
in connection with his rearma
ment program.
Yesterday he announced a dras
tic reorganization of his cabinet,
in an attempt to halt increasing
attacks on the airplane building
program. Critics in both Houses
of Parliament have charged that
Germany is building two fighting
planes for every one produced in
Britain.
Acting under the advice of his
predecessor, Stanley Baldwin,
Chamberlain "accepted," that is, de
manded, the resignation of Viscount
Swinton from the Air Ministry, and
elevated Sir Howard Kingsley
Wood, former Minister of Health, to
the key position.

Most important of the other cab
inet changes was the advancement
of Malcolm Mac Donald, 37-year
old son of the late Labor-then-Con
sorvative Prime Minister, Ramsay
Mac Donald, to the post of Colonial
Secretary, where he will have an im
portant role in meeting Der Fueh
rer's demands for restoration of
Germany's pre-War colonies.
Chief instigation of the cabinet
change was the House of Commons
air defense debate set for Thurs
day, and (he possibility that 100
government members, who ab
stained from voting when Cham
berlain won a 299 to 131 vote of
confidence on air armament last
Thursday, might swing over to
the opposition.

IN WASHINGTON the Supreme
Court agreed to review the entire
Tennessee Valley Authority contro
versy, but did not announce its de
cision on the appeal brought by 18
Southern utility operators.
At the same time, it issued a num
ber of rulings clarifying its atti
tude toward National Labor Rela
tions Board procedure, and held that
employers may not discriminate
against union workers in reinstating
employes after a strike.
On an issue raised by the Mac
kay company, the court held that
failure of the NRLB to file an in
termediate report of the trial ex
aminer and allow for defendant's
exceptions, which was declared
necessary in the Kansas City
stockyards case, did not consti
tute a reversahlc error because
there was no doubt as to the na
ture or details of the complaint.
