# 450 Bids Issued For Barbecue
## Free Event Will Be Held Tomorrow At Varsity Park for '38 
### 
With the weather man promising
"fair and warm" for tomorrow's free
Senior Barbecue at Varsity Park, I
450 men and women of '38 have been
issued tickets for the affair.
Stressing the fact that there should
be no dating, Bill Hulbert, commit
tee chairman, announced last night
that the senior women from many of
the living groups had already made
arrangements to go to the barbecue
together.
"To make it a success," he said,
"everybody will have to wear old
clothes and get into the spirit of the
thing. We are having "bumming
stations" at the Post Office and the
Deke House so that everybody will
be able to get out there easily."
Faculty Invited
Many faculty members have been
invited by the seniors, according to
Hulbert, who said that the barbecue
would be the last chance for infor
mal student-faculty relations.
Games and informal entertainment
will be started at 4 o'clock but din
ner will not be served until 6 o'clock.
Policemen have been provided to
punch the tickets at the gates to the
park and to take them up as the
food is served.
Scroll Ready
Senior Scroll, which was dam
aged by careless signers, has been
repaired and is again 5 n the A.S.S.U.
office ready for the signatures of
graduating seniors. Special places
have been provided for committee
chairmen.
One hundred and ninety-two
seniors have already signed the
Scrool, according to Dave Hooker,
chairman. The scroll will be en
closed with other mementos under
the class plate in front of the Me
morial Church.

mencement exercises on the after
noon of June 19. Estimated cost is
