# Landis Tells Legal Trend At Assembly
## Harvard Law School Dean Recognizes New Shift in Speech Here 
### 
Recognizing "a shift in legal theory
comparable to the shift in demo
cratic theory that began at the turn
of the last century," Dean James M.
Landis, Dean of the Harvard Law
School spoke on 'The New Equity
â€”The Rise and Future of Adminis
trative Law," yesterday in an all-
University assembly.
"As one views our national scene
broadly today, something akin to a
rise of equity seems to be taking
place. Justice in our society is be
ginning to imply some more rational
basis for the distribution of rewards,
some shift from the prevailing con
cept that government's primary con
cern is the protection of the right to
scramble for property," he declared.
Negative Courts
Preface to Dr ;>>-> Landis' address
was the point that the decisions of
the courts are negative rather than
positive, and that the need of "new
methods of government" is due to
the rise of industrialism and democ
racy during the nineteenth century.
From this point, he traced the
growth of administrative regulation
through quasi-judicial bodies and
and illustrated that historical rise
by reference to the development of
the Intertsate Commerce Commis
sion.
War Experience
"The experience of the World War
made more acute than ever the
necessity for wider powers of con
trol, powers to foster as well as to
control," he explained.
Following the "economic break
down of 1929," he declared, a "per
plexed state" relied almost entirely
upon the administrative approach to
solve its problems.
Reasons for the growth of ad
ministrative agencies, he explained,
were "distrust of the ability of the
judicial process to make the neces
sary adjustments in the develop
ment of both law and regulatory
methods as they related to particu
lar industrial problems.
Lists Points
Dean Landis listed three advan
tageous characteristics of adminis
trative regulation as the "practical"'
approach to the particular problem,
fills the gap left by the common law,
and possesses the power of "inde
pendent investigation."
As a conclusion, the former chair
man of the Securities and Exchange
Commission declared that in the
law, "a new system of tribunals is,
in part, the response to the demand
of realizing the content of a new
charter of liberties."
Present position of the administra
tive commissions "has already been
secured," according to Dean Landis,
and "certainly their destiny is
great, for there has been entrusted
much of the eternally unfolding
ideal of American life."
