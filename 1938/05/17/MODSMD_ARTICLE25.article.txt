## 
### HARRY PRESS HARRY SHELDON 
Forseeing the end of the Spanish
war, Dr. Max H. Savelle, associate
professor of history, already has laid
plans for study in that country dur
ing his sabbatical year which be
gins in June.
"If Mussolini and Hitler have made
up their minds about Franco win
ning the war, and I think they have,
there's not much question about the
fact that it will be over by next fall,"
he declared.
Purpose of Dr. Savelle's study
there, and also in France, England,
and possibly Holland, is research on
"The Study of European Diplomacy
Willi Regard to America." Period to
be covered by this study is from the
Peace of Utrecht, 1713, to the Peace
of Paris, 1763.

"There's never been anything done
before on this subject and period,"
he said, "and I don't suppose that
anyone will read it after it's done,
but it will be there in case anybody
wants it."
The study has been made possible
by the Social Science Research
Council of New York, which each
year makes grants of money to about
25 scholars for work on historical
subjects. Many of the funds have
been donated by the Rockefeller
Foundation.
Dr. Savelle will gather notes and
copies from actual diplomatic cor
respondence in the national archives
of the countries which he visits. To
make his notes, he will be required
to read the three foreign languages
—French, Spanish, and Dutch.
May Finish Book •
Actual background material for
(he book which Dr. Savelle plans
has been gathered over the past five
years. He estimates, however, that
if he can assimilate all the necessary
foreign material during the 15
months abroad, he may be able to
finish the book within another year.
Dr. Savelle will leave San Fran
cisco in July and go to France by

way of the Far East. He will be
joined there by his wife in the fall.
Next port of call is to be England,
from where he will go to Spain "if
the war is over." Then, if time per
mits, he will visit Holland, which
will complete his trip before re
turning to Stanford in October, 1939.
