# Crass Crooners Crush Crosby
## 
### 
If it takes Ring Crosby's croon
ing to make Rohle sit up and take
notice during the confusion of
Thursday night suppers, local tal
ent at Encina can do its hit along
the same line much more effect
ively.
Two Encina hashers have given
the matter considerable more
eclat with their handling of the
chomping and clattering in Encina
dining Room 8.
Beginning their duet out in the
"Eneinasylum" kitchens, the pair
found their harmonizing so much
to their own taste that they carried
it into the eating room, leaning
against the wall with their hands
full of trays and braving dining
liall rules to get together in some
tricky arrangements of their own.
Surprised into completely for
getting their attack upon "Encina
vittles," the dining room full of
famished frosh listened for five
minutes, finally bursting into a
flurry of handclapping, stamp
ing and catcalls.
