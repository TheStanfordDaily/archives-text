# 'Is Europe?' To Have Ridiculous Scenery
## 
### 
"The scenery will be ridiculous,"
stated Gene Callnon, technical direc
tor of "Is Europe?" yesterday, in
regard to the props for the spring
musical comedy. "It also will be
fascinating, flippant, and funny."
Letting their imaginations run
freely, Callnon and his crew of stage
experts have created two colorful
"Alice in Wonderland"-type sets
which represent the inside of the
Balkanian Royal Palace throne room,
and the street outside.
New Treatment
"We've taken an ordinary throne
room and given it the works,"
laughed Callnon, referring to his
version of the hallowed spot which
he has done in red, yellow, magenta,
turquoise blue, and blue violet, with
ceilings vaulted by "barber-pole"
columns.
More modest is his conception of
the royal throne, which will be done
simply in grey-blue with dimpled
cupids, masculine men, and feminine
women capering over it. Flying
cupids will adorn the walls, along
with two colossal and artistic fem
inine statues which the stage crew
have fondly named "Sadie" and
"Mazie." According to Callnon, the
sets are styled technically in "satir
ical baroque."
Caricatures Used
Make-up staff, under direction of
Kay Kloster, will make up and keep
in condition 70 people for two per
formances. In moulding caricatures
of famous European big-wigs out of
the plain faces of Stanford folk, wigs,
beards, mustaches, "bald pates," and
plenty of putty or wax will be used,
and the best-known features of the
individual caricatured will be em
phasized. ,
The costumes will consist for the
most part of the original dress of
the person caricatured; only a few
of them will be outrageous. They
will be designed and arranged by
Kit Cartwright, who is also assist
ing in designing the sets.

Technical stall consists of Gene
Callnon, technical director; Chet
Johnson, stage manager; Wilma
MacFadclen, lights; Mary Dickey,
props; Kit Cartwright, costumes;
Olive KrauthofT, stage assistants; and
Kay Kloster, make-up.
Men and women are needed to
work on stage crew. Those inter
ested should see Callnon in the Me
morial Theater workshop.
