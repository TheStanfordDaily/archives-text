# Phi Alpha Delt Promotes Law Friendships
## 
### 
Phil Alpha Delta, one of Stan
ford's three legal fraternities, was
founded in Chicago in 185)7 to pro
mote interclass and interschool rela
tions between the law students,
through extracurricular activities,
and to provide interchange of busi
ness between the members after
graduation.
The fraternity was originally call
ed Lambda Epsilon, but in 1902 it
was changed to Phi Alpha Delta.
The Oliver Wendell Holmes chapter
was established on the Stanford cam
pus in 1911.
Bi-monthly luncheons are held, at
which some member of the faculty
usually speaks, as well as occasional
interfraternity functions such as
baseball games and picnics, with the
chapters of University of California,
University of San Francisco, and
Hastings Law School. General busi
ness meetings are held once a week.
The present officers of the local
chapter include: Perry Moerdyke,
justice; William Rohkam, Jr., vice
justice; Eben W. Whittlesey, clerk;
James C. Toothaker, treasurer; and
Albert Burford, marshall. Among
the faculty members are: Dean Mar
ion Kirk wood and Professors Arthur
Cathcart, Joseph Bingham, William
Owens, and John Hurlbut.
