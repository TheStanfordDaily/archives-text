## Professor Lectures On Warmth Devices 
### 
"We modern people keep warm I
in lots of ways, but these ways are {
almost all relatively recent inven
tions, quite unknown to the Greeks
and Romans."
Warming devices of ours were de
veloped during the so-called Middle *
Ages, according to Dr. Lynn T. White
Jr. of the Stanford history depart- !
ment. In his Stanford Radio Hour
address, "How Our Medieval An
cestors Learned to Keep Warm," he
discussed the origins of our modern
methods of heating.
"Roman costumes were doubtless
artistic, but they neither kept the
cold out nor kept the heat of the
body in," he said. "In the early j
Middle Ages both furs and trousers
became typical parts of European 1
dress.
"The button was the next great
improvement of clothing in the
Middle Ages. Still another import
ant contribution was the art of knit
ting.
"Heating in houses was also de
veloped in the Middle Ages, and the
final medieval improvement in the
technique of keeping the human
anatomy warmed up was the in
vention of distilled liquors."
