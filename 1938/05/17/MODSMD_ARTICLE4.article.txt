# Mothers Club To Add Figures, Check Books
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Thursday night Mothers' Club
members will count up receipts from
their annual pageant, and see if their
ledger has enough figures chalked up
in black ink for them to be able to
go on next year supporting men's
and women's rest homes and their
numerous other charities.
"We made $1300 last year," Mrs.
George O. Wilson, club president
said yesterday. "We want to make
$1500 on our Elizabethan pageant
this year."
Student interest may be the thing
which will increase this year's prof
its, Mothers' Club believes. One of
the paradoxes of the Mothers' Club
pageant has been that while students
directly and indirectly receive all of
the profits made by it, they seldom
attend themselves.
Reasons Given
But this year Mothers' Club feels
that it is giving them some reason
to attend:
(1) The pageant this year should
be more attractive to student taste.
It will be colorfully Elizabethan
with its costumes, music, queens
(there will be two of them), as
sorted acts, including the tumbling
Zook twins, and refreshments on the
house.
(2) It will be held on the campus
this year for the first time, in the
Lawrence Frost Memorial Amphi
theater from 1 to 5 o'clock Thursday
afternoon.
Rate Reduction
(3) While the regular price is $1,
students will be able to buy tickets
at the gate for 50 cents. But because
of the expense of moving seats into
/'the amphitheater, only $1 ticket
holders will get seats. The rest will
have to sit on the ground.
"We have been working on it
since the middle of January," Mrs.
Wilson said. "There will be 165
people in the cast, and everyone," as
Mrs. Wilson put it, "from Palo Alto

children through Stanford students
to mothers and fathers and alumni,
and even professors will be in it."
Miss Dorothy Nichols of Palo Alto
wrote the script, and since January
local Mothers' Club members have
been working on picking a cast,
holding rehearsals, making cos
tumes. All 165 of the cast had to
have costumes), and the mothers
made them for them. They will
be turned over to the Farm costume
department after Thursday.
Peninsula region mothers haven't
done all of the work on the pageant,
however. They are having candy,
cake, lavender, and flower booths
there Thursday, and from all over
donations have been coming in.
Oregon Candy
Last week, for instance, Mrs.
Wilson received a box of candy from
a woman in Oregon to be sold in one
of the candy booths.
Mothers' Club has worked on this
, pageant, but it's had to. Last year
| they spent $4471 on welfare. They'll
| need at least that next year.
Rest Homes took most of it, $2580
in all, caring for 289 women 817
hospital days and 447 men for 1513
days.
Scholarship committee, partially
supporting 19 students, used $959.
The welfare committee, caring for 35
students, spent $778.
Three Sources
This money came in from three
sources: (1) dues of $1 from the
1767 members; (2) additional gifts
â€”totaling more than the dues; (3)
their two benefits, the one in the fall
and their spring pageant.
And Thursday the Mothers' Club,
j and particularly Mrs. C. B. Necl,
j costume head, Mrs. Raymond Whecl-
I er, in charge of the pageant, Mrs.
i Rosemary Hay, director, and Mrs.
I Wilson, will find out whether they
i can aid as many students as they
I did this last year.
