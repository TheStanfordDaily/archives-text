## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Grid Squad To Stage Big Scrimmage Friday 
### 
So much has been written about [
Tiny ThornhilFs great crew of back- !
| field men that little attention has !
been given to the potential forward !
wall, but the probabilities of Stan- |
ford's dream team not developing ;
I into a nightmare hinge on the seven
j men in the line.
The coaching staff spent a session j
| last night in a rugged line scrim- |
mage that had the Grey's field dug !
j up like the aftermath of a polo game
i before the squad finished their
| chores. Big Ed Johannessen and
I Claude Purkitt. two frosh tackles
who may end up playing guard, dis
| played plenty of power in the work
j outs. These two gents averaged 215
1 when the spring season started and
| look like promising replacements.
Question Mark
Biggest question mark on the
jhope d-for championship squad
| seems to be the weak guard posts.
Bob Dakan and Dick Sutton are still
the first string men there and are
definitely superior to the form they
displayed last fall.
Back of Sutton and Dakan are
j Steve Keusseff and Paul Ugrin.
j Keusseff showed promise last fall
j but lacked experience, while Ugrin
J is a newcomer from junior college.
The frosh have sent up Roy Adam
son, Dear. Burford, Chick Orme, and
t John Kerman, any of whom might
■ eventually crash the top lineups but
i are likewise without any service
| stripes.
Tackles Strong
The failure of Frank McMillan,
| Ed Gamier, and Jack Walton, all
■ lettermen, to report, cut a deeper
: hole into the spots vacated by Leo
i Ferko and Bob Matthews. Walton
I was out watching the scrimmage
j last night and may eventually suc
cumb. If he is in as good shape as
he looks, his 225 pounds would fill
quite a gap.
Stan Andersen and Pete Zagar
have missed all the practice work

thus far, but still promise to give the
Big Red Machine the strongest pair
of tackles on the Colist. And Corky
Donahue and By West are almost
good enough to oust either one of
them with Johannessen, Purkitt, and
others close behind. Andersen got
in a piece of practice last night as
he ran through a signal drill with
one of the lesser strings.
What has been termed a "Big
Scrimmage" has been promised lor
Friday afternoon with squad due to
split up for assault and battery on
each other for keeps.
Columbia University has an
nounced plans to construct 10 or
more new buildings and improve
existing facilities, and is seeking an
endowment of $50,000,000 to finance
the project.

Question Mark
Biggest question mark on the
jhope d-for championship squad
| seems to be the weak guard posts.
Bob Dakan and Dick Sutton are still
the first string men there and are
definitely superior to the form they
displayed last fall.
Back of Sutton and Dakan are
j Steve Keusseff and Paul Ugrin.
j Keusseff showed promise last fall
j but lacked experience, while Ugrin
J is a newcomer from junior college.
The frosh have sent up Roy Adam
son, Dear. Burford, Chick Orme, and
t John Kerman, any of whom might
■ eventually crash the top lineups but
i are likewise without any service
| stripes.
Tackles Strong
The failure of Frank McMillan,
| Ed Gamier, and Jack Walton, all
■ lettermen, to report, cut a deeper
: hole into the spots vacated by Leo
i Ferko and Bob Matthews. Walton
I was out watching the scrimmage
j last night and may eventually suc
cumb. If he is in as good shape as
he looks, his 225 pounds would fill
quite a gap.

thus far, but still promise to give the
Big Red Machine the strongest pair
of tackles on the Colist. And Corky
