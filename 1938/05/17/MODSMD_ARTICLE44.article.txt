# Fullerton Leads Poloists to Victory
## 
### 
A six-goal rally in the last two
chukkers carried the Stanford polo
team to an 8-4 victory over the
University of Utah last Saturday on
the highway field.
Captain Jim Fullerton, inserted
late in the game to inspire some fire
in a faltering second-string line-up,
took high-scoring honors with three
goals. Bert Hyde and Bob Wallace
each nabbed two markers and Bob
Gillespie one.
The Farm line-up was as follows:
Gillespie at No. 1; Hyde, 2; Wallace,
3: and Joe Phillips, 4. Fullerton was
the only substitute.
Dodson, White, Williams, and Pix
ton comprised the Utah line-up.
Sportsmen in the United States
and Alaska paid $10,460,237.37 for
0.658.158 hunting licenses in 1936,
an increase of almost a million dol
lars over the previous year.
