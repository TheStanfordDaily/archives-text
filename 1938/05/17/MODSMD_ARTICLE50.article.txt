ALMOST unnoticed this year was the ap
pointment of two lucky men to handle
Dividex. For an event which is probably the
biggest gravy portion that A.S.S.U. can dish
out, the oversight by the campus at large is a
little peculiar.
By working for approximately one month,
two men rake in over $200 apiece, 40 per cent
of the total profit. Fifty per cent of the take
goes to Publications Council, to be split three
ways among the campus publications, and the
other 10 per cent to the father of the bonanza,
the A.S.S.U.
Historically, the Dividex dates back several
years when a couple of smart lads rode the idea
through Ex Committee. Publications Council,
screaming that their advertisers were being
taken away, and Ex Committee, itself a little
dazed by the thoughts of handling out so much
gravy, worked out the present system of per
centages in the hope that some of the profit
motive could be eliminated. But in spite of any
thing they could do, Dividex still remains a gold
mine for two lucky men.
The two are lucky because it's mostly luck
that chooses them. One might suppose that
they would be picked because of financial
need; it would be just another scholarship, paid
for by a little work. But need is only a minor
factor. Usually the two are just good men who
have had some experience with the sort of
work required. Sometimes the appointment has
been used as a consolation prize for would-be
student managers.
The boys are overpaid for their work, little
doubt about that. And Publications Council is
getting more than its share, because now, with
the Dividex an established affair, little squab
bling over advertisers ensues. It looks like the
A.S.S.U. itself, which kindly hands out the
boodle, is dealing itself out of some money
that it might well claim.
As it now stands, the Dividex is nothing more
than a gravy portion. It has little other purpose
from the A.S.S.U. standpoint. If it is to be con
tinued, one of two things should be done:
(1) Put profits back into the A.S.S.U. where
ihey belong, with a reasonable salary to the
editors.
(2) Award Dividex on a more rational basis
than now is in effect.
Either one will make the gravy legitimate.
But it still will be gravy.—J. S.

motive could be eliminated. But in spite of any
thing they could do, Dividex still remains a gold
mine for two lucky men.
The two are lucky because it's mostly luck
that chooses them. One might suppose that
they would be picked because of financial
need; it would be just another scholarship, paid
for by a little work. But need is only a minor
factor. Usually the two are just good men who
have had some experience with the sort of
work required. Sometimes the appointment has
been used as a consolation prize for would-be
student managers.
The boys are overpaid for their work, little
doubt about that. And Publications Council is
getting more than its share, because now, with
the Dividex an established affair, little squab
bling over advertisers ensues. It looks like the
A.S.S.U. itself, which kindly hands out the
boodle, is dealing itself out of some money
that it might well claim.
As it now stands, the Dividex is nothing more
than a gravy portion. It has little other purpose
from the A.S.S.U. standpoint. If it is to be con
tinued, one of two things should be done:
(1) Put profits back into the A.S.S.U. where
ihey belong, with a reasonable salary to the
editors.
(2) Award Dividex on a more rational basis
than now is in effect.
Either one will make the gravy legitimate.
But it still will be gravy.—J. S.
ALMOST unnoticed this year was the ap
pointment of two lucky men to handle
Dividex. For an event which is probably the
biggest gravy portion that A.S.S.U. can dish
out, the oversight by the campus at large is a
little peculiar.
By working for approximately one month,
two men rake in over $200 apiece, 40 per cent
of the total profit. Fifty per cent of the take
goes to Publications Council, to be split three
ways among the campus publications, and the
other 10 per cent to the father of the bonanza,
the A.S.S.U.
Historically, the Dividex dates back several
years when a couple of smart lads rode the idea
through Ex Committee. Publications Council,
screaming that their advertisers were being
taken away, and Ex Committee, itself a little
dazed by the thoughts of handling out so much
gravy, worked out the present system of per
centages in the hope that some of the profit
motive could be eliminated. But in spite of any
thing they could do, Dividex still remains a gold
mine for two lucky men.
