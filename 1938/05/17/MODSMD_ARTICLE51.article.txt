# Call to Quarter
## 
### 
ACCORDING to the calendar, the time sched
ule, and our stub account, spring quarter is
now rehearsing its swan song. The days and
the drinks are getting longer; skirts and the
time left before finals are getting shorter. From
this premise it is not hard to deduce that sum
mer quarter will take over before very long.
We are not going to summer session this
year. Instead we are going to do our best to
look like a promising cog in the industrial ma
chinery, and will spend vacation acquiring the
proletarian viewpoint. But we were here last
summer, and the memory will do a lot to com
fort us while we carry the profit system on our
shoulders.
In summer quarter Stanford changes its dis
position like the financier who spends the day
stalking widows' mites and the evening romp
ing with his children. The old atmosphere is
traded in on a new one. The pace changes, and
instead of a breathless sprint we move along
at a slow stroll.
Life at Stanford during the three regular quar
ters is pleasant enough. There is lots of vital
ity and energy lying about loose. And there
is much running and scurrying that looks well
in this age where "get things done" is the ac
cepted translation of the commandments.
But somehow the calm of summer quarter
seems more fundamental, more enduring, than
the "alarums and excursions" of the rest of the
year. Stanford in the summer has a dignity
and philosophic repose.
Professors come out into the sunlight after
classes instead of bolting into their dark holes
to work through stratified blue books. They
find time to lean against the pillars and hold
Socratic sessions.
The scrambling crowd that now dashes from
classroom to classroom is gone. Instead there
are scattered groups wandering across the
Quad, giving the impression that with a life
expectancy of 50 years or so, we don't have
to fight for an extra 10 minutes.
Bill with all this, Stanford Hops not sit vpqr

tating like a yogi who is playing Narcissus to
the pit of his stomach. Research goes on faster
when professors have less classwork to handle.
And the white rats put forth their best when
they have more attention.
Exchange with other colleges brings in new
men with new specialties, and Stanford finds
itself looking at the world through a different
focus. The old ideologies don't seem so copper
riveted, and the old problems lose some of
their viciousness.
Through everything runs the idea that it
won't hurt to loaf a bit. Classes are small
enough for individual attention. Studies are
paced slowly to give Ideas time to crystallize.
And so when capitalism's heel connects with
our trousers and we bow down to the god of
the time-clock, it will comfort us to know that
at summer session the main object of life is
not to squeeze an extra 10 minutes out of every
hour.â€”J. C.
