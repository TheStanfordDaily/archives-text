# BULL SESSION
## ADMINISTRATIVE LAWYERS 
### 
UEW would quarrel with Dean Landis' thesis, ex
pressed in his talk in Memorial Hall yesterday
morning, that the growth of industrialism and the de
velopment of democracy have made the rise of ad
ministrative law a more or less inevitable feature of
twentieth century America. Few would deny to gov
ernment the right to establish such independent, quasi
judicial legislative bodies as it needs to perform the
functions it cannot undertake itself.
But there is one feature of this development in
legislative jurisprudence with which many might
quarrel; with which many do quarrel. Dean Landis
avoided it; and were it not that it looms very large in
administrative law today, it might be avoided in a
discussion of his speech.
This is the problem of the independent board be
come the handmaiden of politics; the independent,
commission turned willy-nilly into an agent of social
theory; the independent body which legislates and
adjudicates, and shows very little concept of where to
draw the line between the two.
If cases are to be tried before independent boards,
those boards must be judicial in approach as well as
judicial in aspect. If we are to turn over to an inde
pendent agency the right to lay down the law in highly
controversial disputes, we ought to be sure that that
agency lays down the law, and not some social theory
held by its members; not some pre-conceived idea of
what the verdict ought to be, but an honest judgment
of what the verdict is.
We ought to devise standards by which we may
judge prospective appointees; we ought to give them a
certain permanency in office, so that changes of ad
ministration will not mean changes of viewpoint; we
ought to align, whether or not we coordinate, the law
they develop with the law upheld by the courts of the
United States.
The law, as the Chief Justice once remarked in an
unguarded moment, is what the judges say it is; and
though he was referring to the law as decided by the
Supreme Court, his statement holds true wherever
applied.
It is bad enough when applied to the decisions of
a Supreme Court constantly in the public eye, con
stantly under pressure, in its way as responsive to the
public will as the Congress or the President; it is
twice as bad when applied to a hundred and one dif
ferent agencies, going their hundred and one different
ways like haphazard bulls in the judicial china-shop.
The decisions of the Supreme Court may, as Dean
Landis says, be negative; but the decisions of a group
of agencies given privilege without responsibility may,
in their ultimate effect, be equally as destructive in
their effect upon social progress.â€”Allen Drury.
