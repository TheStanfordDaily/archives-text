(Because the U.S.C. actors chose to produce Shake
speare's "As You Like It" in a modern version, the
editor of the Daily Trojan takes time off to rail against
producers who experiment hy streamlining the old
master. For the most part, wc think his criticism ill
taken, both from (he box-office and from the artistic
angle. Also, hy the way, he is away off when he calls
modernized Shako pearc a "really new thing.")
the current theater season started in New
York, Manhattan theater-goers were met with
something really new in dramatic productions. It was
the modern-costume Shakespeare vogue.
One play produced in this manner was successful;
the others failed miserably. Perhaps it was the adapt
ability of the play to modem ways that made "Julius
Caesar" turn out better than the rest, or it may have
been that the adaptation was clone in a more conserva
tive manner than were others.
Criticism may be aimed, then, not at selection of
ihe play for production on the campus, but at the
entire idea of "modernizing" works of such a man as
William Shakespeare.
In its plan for "streamlining" the plays of Shake
speare, the stage has shown itself to be even less dis
criminating than the cinema, for when motion picture
productions of such plays as "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" and "Romeo and Juliet"Â»were made, there was
a faithful effort to reproduce the author's original idea.
* *
who has studied drama even slightly can
recall that several of the Shakespearean plays do
not have original plots, but that others' stories were
smoothed out and strengthened to produce the great
tragedies and romances that have lived through the
centuries. By revision of these plays, modern play
wrights are simply reversing the process that has made
Shakespeare great.
Whereas he took commonplace stories and, by his
superior writing ability, made them great, they have
taken great plays and, by their revision, made them
commonplace.
It is the universal and undated appeal of Shake
spearean drama that has made it the most lasting writ
ing ever done for the theater. Upstarts who would
"modernize" it succeed only in dating it and limiting
its appeal to the twentieth century.
The absurdity of trying to alter Shakespeare and
make him acceptable to the spirit of the jazz age is
demonstrated by the failure of New York audiences
to support the productions. "Julius Caesar" has lasted
probably because it is less bad than others, but oven
its audiences are doubtless drawn as much by curiosity
as bv anything else.
If the theater is not discriminating, discriminating
audiences will assert themselves.
