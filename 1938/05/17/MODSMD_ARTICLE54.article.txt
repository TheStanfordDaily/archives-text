# 'Robin Hood' Makes Good As Thriller
## 
### 
The Adventures of Robin Hood,"
now showing at the Fox in San
Francisco and due soon in Palo Alto:
If you're a lover of these blood
and thunder, swashbuckling "mel
lerdrammers," then you'll probably
love "The Adventures of Robin

Hood." If you
don't go in for
'that "kid" s'tuff,
if you're a staid
old Puritan who
delights in pick
ing pictures
apart, you'll still
be tempted to en
joy it.
I'll readily ad
mit that Robin

has its defects, but you lose sight of I
them in the vigour and action of Er- !
rol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Pat
ric Knowles, Alan Dinehart, Her
bert Mundin, Eugene Palette and
other stars too numerous to mention.
Warner Bros., the home of usually
not-too-good cinemas, turns some
selected legends of the English out
law into a fairly coherent story that
doesn't have one slow moment. In j
case you don't remember your
childhood tales of Robin, we'll re
view the story briefly. Robin Hood
was Robert Locksley, a Saxon lord j
who defended his countrymen ,
against the ravages of the Normans, j
For his pains, his lands were taken
away from him and he was turned
into the equivalent of a twelfth cen
tury "Public Enemy No. 1." Of .
course, we are to remember that all 1
this robbing and plundering was for
the benefit of the poor Saxon peas
ants.
Flynn is, of course, Robin, and
Olivia de Havilland is the Lady
Marian. Patric Knowles portrays
Will Scarlet, Eugene Pallette turns
in a masterful performance of the
Portly Friar Tuck, Alan Dinehart is
just what you would expect of Little
John, Herbert Mundin handles the
role of Munch, the miller's son, com- !
petently.
I know I got a kick out of the pic- i
ture, and I think that every one in 1
the house did too. At least, when !
Robin, all alone fights his way out
of Sir Guy of Guisborne's castle all
by himself, beating up on hundreds .
and hundreds of Norman knights, |
(slight exaggeration), everyone I i
could see was biting his fingernails. !
Sir Guy is represented by Basil
Rathbone, who puts all his evil looks
and actions (and he has plenty of
them) into the role. I caught a 70-
year-old man hissing Rathbone.
"I'll miss my guess if "The Ad
ventures of Robin Hood" does not
stir you to the depths of your col
lective childish souls.â€”Mayer.
