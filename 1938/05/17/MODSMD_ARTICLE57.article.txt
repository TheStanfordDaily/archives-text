; The Editor, Sir:
Points arc awarded every person
participating, in any capacity, in
any dramatic production produced
at Stanford. In Stagers productions
these points are awarded to actors
by the director of the production
and to the technical workers by the
technical director. For any other
productions, such as those of the
; Speech and Drama Department, the
president of Stagers may appoint a
j suitabie person to award points.
The following limits are placed on
| awarding of points:
| (1) For a major production: 1 to
| 10 points; (2) For the Gaieties: for
participation in non-musical skits:
1 to 3 points; for participation in
musical skits: 1 to 5 points per skit;
j for a specialty act: 1 to 5 points; for
I writing a skit or a song: 1 to 5
points; for technical work: 1 to 10
points; (3) For readings: 1 to 5
points; (4) For one-act plays: 1 to 5
points; (5) For writing a major pro

duct ion produced by the society: 25
points.
When any person has acquired 25
points, 15 of which must be in
Stagers productions, he or she auto
matically becomes eligible to be an
active member upon payment of the
initiation fee.
A file of points awarded is kept
on individual cards and is now re
posing in the dramatic manager's
office. Any person who wishes to
do so may examine the file to see
his points, and if there has been a
mistake, or if he feels that he de
served more points than he re
ceived, he is cordially invited to
argue the matter out with whoever
awarded the points on the produc
tion in question.
