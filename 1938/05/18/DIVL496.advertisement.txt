It's true. Think what you can leari;
in the land that gave the world
Goethe, Wagner, Beethoven, Diirer,
Nietszche, Mozart, Kant and Luther.
Great art and superb music . . .
each an education in itself.
Possibly you would enjoy even more
a glorious steamer trip on the
castle-guarded Rhine or the blue
Danube ... a visit to dear old
Heidelberg ... or a healthy, in
teresting hiking or biking tour from
one Youth Hostel to the next.
For a glimpse of continental lifo
and leisure, you will stroll along
Berlin's Unter den Linden. Of
hospitable Munich with her golden
brew, you have heard . . . Not far
a way are the Bavarian Alps and
Austrian Tyrol. And then romantic
Vienna, living in waltz time and
happily reunited with Germany.
Everywhere historic or legendary
names will jog your memory—the
Meistersinger at Nurnberg, Fred
erick the Great at Sanssouci,
Charlemagne at Aachen, Living and
travel are inexpensive, especially
with Travel Marks at 40% savings
and special rail tickets at 60%
reductions.
Consult your Travel Agent and write
far information and booklet "C".
