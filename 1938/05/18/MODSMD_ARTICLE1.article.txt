r J I HE contention that the President
should at all times be above par
tisan politics, and that he should
never intervene in such contests as
state primary elections—which is a
convenient argument now being ad
vanced by Republican and Demo
cratic opponents of Roosevelt—is
but the latest example of the use of
general political principles, or, if
you will, platitudes, as a camou
flage for particular group interests.
"Genial Jim" Farley's last-min
ute approval of Earle-Kennedy
slate in the Pennsylvania election
yesterday forced the President to
issue an emphatic denial that he is
seeking to influence primary elec
tion results or that he is planning
reprisals against anti-New Deal
Democrats.

At a press conference, Mr.
Roosevelt told Secretary Stephen
T. Early to turn on the old phono
graph "record" that has in the
past played his tune: "The White
House does not participate in local
political elections."
Likewise he brushed aside
questions on his week-end cruise
with Sen. Robert M. LaFollette,
co-founder of the "National Pro
gressives of America," and said
they talked of "sealing wax and
cabbages."
The White House has already ap
proved the renomination hopes of
Sen. William Gibbs McAdoo (D.,
Calif.) and has looked coldly upon
the efforts of Oregon Gov. Charles
Martin, who once called Secretary
of Labor Frances Perkins that
"miserable Cabinet officer," to
climb upon the New Deal calliope.

Yesterday Washington discussed
reports that plans have been ap
proved for running thorough New

the Pennsylvania primary election,
which is of far greater importance
than the recent Florida primary
as a test of popular opinion.

increase above existing treaty limits,

all building limitation pacts.
