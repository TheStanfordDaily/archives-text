HOLLYWOOD, May 17 (UP) â€”
Bobby Breen, juvenile screen star,
suffered a slight brain concussion
late today when he was bumped and
fell on the ice while rehearsing for
a picture at a skating rink.
Dust from the explosion of Mount
Katmai, Alaska, in 1912, made its
way to North Africa in two weeks'
time.
