# Class of '38 To Eat. Play At Barbecue
## Free Fun Program Today to Include Hayrides, Baseball 
### 
Promising to "knock the spots out
of the 'Pay to the order' demon that
has haunted their path for the past
four years," the Senior Class today
will stream up to Varsity Park for
a free, informal barbecue.
The program for the affair, as
listed by Bill Hulbert, committee
chairman, starts off with informal
entertainment from 4 to 6 o'clock,
which will include volleyball,
horseshoes, and baseball.
The barbecue will be served from
6 to 7 o'clock, and from 7 to 8
o'clock there will be hayrides and
informal singing in store for those
present.
Old Clothes Rule
"To make this barbecue a suc
cess," Hulbert said, "everybody has
got to wear old clothes and get into
the spirit of the thing. We are go
ing to have a 'bumming station' at
the Post Office and the Deke house,
and everyone with a car is asked to
help so that all can get out there
easily."
Stressing the fact that there
should be no dating, Hulbert said
that many of the senior women in
the houses and living groups have
made ararngements to go to the bar
becue together.
"A check will be made at the gate
at Varsity Park on the tickets, and
we're going to see to it that no one
gets in who doesn't belong there,"
Hulbert announced last night.
Faculty Guests
Declaring that this will be the
last chance for many of the class to
have informal chats with the faculty
who are attending, as one of the
many aspects of the affair, Hulbert
said that the weather man has also
aided to the extent of promising
"fair and warmer" for those at
tending.
Committee members as given by
Hulbert include Audrey Broun
field, Bessie Seward, Jean MacMil
lan, Robert Tuthill, Mary Lewis,
Adele Behr, Elizabeth Woodin, John
Savage, Dave \ Swanberg, Larry
O'Brien, and John Shenk.
