# Stanford Enters 32 In Junior P.A. Meet
## 
### 
Stanford cindermen went through
a stiff workout on Angell Field yes
terday, although the Intramural Re
lays somewhat restricted their ac
tivities.
Captain Ray Malott turned in a
48.8 quarter-mile effort while Craig
Williamson, Charles Shaw, George
Rockwell and Jerry McCall, other
440 men, ran the mile.
Thirty-two Farm tracksters have
been entered in Saturday's junior
Pacific Athletic Association meet,
scheduled to be held in San Jose.
Malott. Tom Montgomery and Pete
Zagar are ineligible to compete in
the junior meet by reason of hav
ing won championships in previous
A.A.U. and N.C.A.A. meets.
Shot-putter Montgomery and dis
cus-thrower Zagar will take it easy
this week, but Malott may enter the
400-meters dash at Compton's an
nual invitation meet.
Will Face Greats
If Malott decides to compete he
will face such greats as Archie
Williams, Cal's great Olympic Games
Star; Wilbur Miller, Compton J. C.
negro who has been timed in 47.1
this year; Harold Cagle of Oklahoma
Baptist, who defeated Miller recent
ly; Erwin Miller, U.S.C.'s fast-im
proving quarter-miler; and Bob
Young and A1 Blackman, Olympic
Club veterans.
However, the Indians are looking
past this week-end's individual
meets to the Pacific Coast Confer
ence tussle, which is to be held at
Berkeley on May 28.
Such men as Malott, Dick Simp
son, Bill Hawkins, Ed Burrows,
Stan Hiserman, Carl Mahurin, Za
gar, Hugh Gribbin, Montgomery, and
Russ Wulff are capable of placing
high in the P.C.C. affair, and this
week-end's meet will serve as a
competitive warm-up.
