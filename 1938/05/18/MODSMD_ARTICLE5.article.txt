# Law School Makes Entrance Changes

### 
Stanford School of Law has had
modifications added to its require
ments for admittance which provide
for a special review for borderline
students, according to announce
ment yesterday by Dean M. R. Kirk
wood in an annual letter to low
graduates.
Students completing undergrad
uate studies with a "C plus" or bet
ter grade average will be admitted
automatically. Other bases of judg
ment such as aptitude tests, the field
in which the best record was made,
and improvement shown will be
considered for applicants of lower
standing.
