# Drive in the Rough
## 
### 
\\TF anyone knew why we didn't go over the
1 top, he'd be a genius," Roy Thompson said
early this week. He was commenting on the
failure of the Convalescent Home Drive, of
which he was treasurer, to reach its goal of
56144.
But it seems to us that mere reading of
Thompson's figures would supply the answer.
How contributions from living groups dropped
far below last year's amounts is the significant
part of their story.
What happened, it would seem, is that the
committee concentrated on the unimportant
events to the detriment of one of the biggest
moneymakers. We were exhorted to buy tags,
we were asked to put spare change in boxes
scattered around the campus, we were nicked
for two-bits for a plate of strawberries. All of
these events didn't add up to a tenth of what
was needed.
The main purpose of brunch, labor day, and
the rest of the entertainment is to get us in the
right psychological state for giving in fairly
large amounts. Instead of building up the right
frame of mind, the committee rubbed us the
wrong way with a bunch of minor irritants that
weren't worth the trouble.
Of course the committee couldn't help the
Recession, and without the King-Queen con
test the Masque Ball wasn't in the big money
class. An original idea is needed there.
Nothing can be done about the drive now,
but the committee at least can recommend
a better type of salesmanship to its successors.
