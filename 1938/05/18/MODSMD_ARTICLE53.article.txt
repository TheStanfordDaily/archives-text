EVERY spring, when the grass is cut and
raked up, the temptation for the boys who
haven't outgrown playing with matches is too

in the column at the right, covers the problem

charged to the A.S.S.U.
The warnings are all obvious, and should be
unnecessary. But every year the same prob
lem arises. Evidently the old adage about the
child who gets burned doesn't apply to Stan
ford.—J. S.
