# Rest Home Makers

### 
IT WOULD be something more than touch
ingly optimistic to say that all Stanford will
stampede over to the Mothers' Club fete to
morrow afternoon. The law of averages tells
us that there will be a certain number of roughs
who believe that a fete is something reserved
for melodrama heroines and the principals of
Greek tragedies.
But knowing the close causal relationship be
tween the Mothers' Club and the rest homes,
wo hope that attendance will match expecta
tions chip foi chip.
The Mothers' Club deserves a bouguet on
several counts. And it would be easy to wan
der off into an 18-em mammy song. It hap
pens, though, that the club doesn't need to
stand on a sentimental pedestal. It asks sup
port on purely pragmatic grounds, and it can
back up its reguest. For prompt and efficient
returning oi bread cast upon the waters the
club has a 'our-star rating.
I unds collected throughout the year auto
matically go back to the students. The major
p&rt goes to supp6rt the men's and women's
rest homes. The remainder is given to student
aid and scholarships.
That means that sooner or later most of the
students get a dividend on their investments
in the Mothers Club. Of course it is possible
for a man to get through Stanford without see
ing the inside of the rest home. But the chances
are that ha will spent guite a bit of time snif
flirig under an infra-red lamp, while the health
service is emphatically reaffirming that "there
'*3 no flu epidemic at Stanford." If not that he
will vage fratricidal internal war with a stom
ach that has revolted despite the fact that "there

is absolutely nothing wrong with our water
supply."
And so without dragging in the question of
the sacredness of motherhood or the beauty
of a mother's loving care, we hope that the
pageant will play to a full house.â€”J. C.
