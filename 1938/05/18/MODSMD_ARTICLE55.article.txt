## THE 						CLICKING DOOR CASE

make more use of the Li be steps—those stra
tegic vantage points for collecting girls and gossip
than my friend Bellwether; so I was not surprised to
see him last night as I came out of the building in the
middle of the 8 o'clock rush hour.
He was smoking a cigarette and thoughtfully sur
veying first me and then the Libe door. Presently he
spoke.
"I see you got out safely," he said.
"What?"
"I see they let you go."
"What is this?"
"I suppose they weren't in the mood."
"Listen, Bellwether. No doubt this is all very
funny, but—"
"Not funny to me," he said darkly. "Not funny at
all. It almost cost me my Jife. No, it wasn't funny
in the least."
"All right," I said, resigned. "Go on."
"It happened the other night, when I suddenly re
membered thai I wanted ot get a book out of the Re
serve Book Room. It was about quarter to 10, and
when I reached the Libe not more than three minutes
had elapsed. And do you know what I found?"
"I'm sure I couldn't imagine." ,
"They had begun to lock the doors. The Libe
doesn't close till 10 o'clock, you know, but they were
already hard at work, busy as little bees, methodically
locking the doors, one after the other."
"So you turned around and went home?"
"Nothing of the sort! For a moment I paused. For
a moment I wavered. Then the Bellwether blood as
serted itself. Without a moment's hesitation I plunged
forward into the Libe, straight for the Reserve Book
Room. I reached the desk. But there was no one
there! I called. I pounded. Behind me I could hear
them locking the doors. Click! Click! Click! I felt
as though I were in the middle of an Edgar Allen Poe
story.
"I began to think of what lay before me. I began
to see myself, racing up and down stairs all night long,
trying to find a way out, trying, trying, finally ex
piring gently somewhere in the stacks. Locked in the
Libe. What a way to die! And behind me the doors
—click! . . click! . . click!
"Suddenly, so suddenly that he might have ma
terialized out of thin air, an attendant appeared—one
of those dank attendants they keep around the Libe.
I gasped out my request. He smiled condescendingly.
I knew he was listening to the doors, too. Finally he
got me the book. I signed and fled. As I made for the
friendly lights of the Union and civilization, the last
door closed with a reverberation which seemed to
shake the whole building. I collapsed at the Union
counter and ordered cup after cup of Union coffee, in
a hopeless attempt to forget—forget. I haven't set
foot in the Libe since."
"Bellwether," I said, "I don't believe this."
He shrugged.
"Believe it or not. You've certainly tried to take a
book out near closing time, haven't you? You've cer
tainly come up against the Library Exclusion Act,
which goes into effect about 15 minutes before it's
legally supposed to every night. You've certainly
wondered what they do with that extra time they get.
Well, I know. They lie in wait."
And try as I would, I couldn't shake his story.
