A s WE indicated yesterday, we are not at all in agree
ment with the Trojan editor whose diatribe
against modernized Shakespeare was printed yester
day in this column. However, he does represent a
point of view rather widely held, one which, though
often correct in specific instances, is usually errone
ous.
Let us take him up point by point. In the first
place, modernized or streamlined Shakespeare is a
very old thing. From the days of first production in
the Elizabethan period, producers have been doctoring
up the old master to fit tastes and production needs.
The nineteenth century was especially notorious for
this. Small stock companies used to do things to
Shakespeare which would be hissed off a stage today,
but which were acceptable at lhat time.
And his criticism that stage productions are less
discriminating in adapting Shakespeare than the mov
ies is very ill-taken, we think. Although "Romeo and
Juliet" was a faithful reproduction of the original, in
that no lines were rewritten, "Midsummer Night's
Dream" was a long way from being Shakespeare.
Rather it was just another glorious pageant which
movie producers bring out for the good of their souls
every so often.
On the other hand, the streamlining of several
Shakespeare plays by the Globe Theaters of the Chi
cago and San Diego World's Fairs proved to be a very
worthwhile move, both from box-office angles, and
from the spectator's view-point. They were the most
entertaining productions of Shakespeare we have seen
in a long time.

pERHAPS lie is right in saying that modern revis
ions place Shakespeare's plays back into the com
monplace—for an Elizabethan audience. But for mod
ern theaters, a little change to fit in with current ideas
on what theater is is rarely amiss. In the same breath
he speaks of Shakespeare being undated, and then
calls the use of modern dress—which should lie ac
ceptable under that premise—'a limitation of appeal to
only twentieth century audiences.
After all, when Shakespeare's plays were produced,
they were produced in modern dress—of that time. It
should be logical to suppose that if they are really as
universal and timeless as the writer claims, they could
stand modern dress today. And they have, from time
to time. Like many conventional Shakespeare pro
ductions, modernized versions have been poor, but in
most cases the fault lies with the production, rather
than with ihe costuming.
What costuming does in the Shakespeare play is
to let the audience know just what to expect, that they
arc to throw off the conventions and philosophy of
the twentieth century, and accept the plays as some
thing which could have happened in the past. Much
that is rather poor theater even in Shakespeare can
slip by under this disguise. The i<est, the great theater
of Shakespeare, is universal, and can stand by itself,
on a bare stage, as it was when first produced, or in
the dress of the times—whether a sack suit, <>i ruff
collar and britches. - Stone.
