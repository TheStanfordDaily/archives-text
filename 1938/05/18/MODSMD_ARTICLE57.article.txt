# CAMPUS OPINION
## HAYSTACK FIRES 
### 
(Last year, when haystack fires
began to blossom in spring, act
ing-comptroller J. Hugh Jackson
released the following statement
in relation to the situation):
May 22, 1937.
One of the principal responsibili
ties of the University is to protect
its own property as well as the
sources of its income. Off and on
over a period of years, we have suf
fered losses because of arson, large
ly the result of thoughtlessness on
the part of the students in the burn
ing of haystacks. This, however, is
not only destructive of University
property, but there is also always a
risk that we may have such a dis
asteiQus grass fire as that which de
stroyed a large portion of the west
erly addition of the city of Berkeley.
Last year, for example, some nine
fires started simultaneously on the
campus, and only this past Friday
night two such fired occurred near
the dormitories.
As acting comptroller, I have the
responsibility of dealing with this
problem. It will be my endeavor to
follow the general plans that have
been used by Mr. Roth in the past,
which means that the following
steps will be taken:
(a) A sufficient number of watch
men will be employed to endeavor
to apprehend anyonfc who wilfully
sets fire anywhere, on the Stanford
campus. Anyone so apprehended
will be turned over to the civil
authorities for punishment in ac
cordance with the statutes relating
to arson, and the cost of the prop
erty destroyed, together with the
cost of the additional watchmen's
services, will be assessed against
such individuals.
(b) Because of the seriousness of
this situation, any student who wil
fully sets fire, destroys fire pro
tection equipment, or turns in false
alarms will be recommended to the
President qf the University for*ex
pulsion.
The experience of this office has
been that Stanford students are glad
to respond and co-operate with the
University in eliminating any dan
gerous or objectionable practise,
when its bad features are brought
to their attention, and it is sincerely
hoped that we will have the fullest
co-operation of the student body in
meeting this serious problem.
â€”J. Hugh Jackson,
Acting Comptroller.
