# 'Frogs Resemble Chickens,' Says Speech Bureau Head
## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Psychologists might say that Bob [
Maiden, Speakers Bureau head, has
a split personality: he is a perfume
compounder and a frog fancier.
Until last Thanksgiving, he was
more than just a frog fancier. He
was a frog raiser. He had a frog
farm down in Southern California,
down in San Fernando Valley, but
he sold it.
He vised to raise bull-frogs, big j
ones like Mark Twain's famous'
jumping frog of Calaveras county, j
to be sold as food. The best of them i
weighed about three pounds, and
were 10 inches across the back.
There's a good market for them, he
says; they sell wholesale for $5 a
dozen. "People think that only the
legs arc eaten," Maiden says, "but
the whole thing is. Sometime if
you see a thing in a restaurant which
looks like a chicken only smaller,
chances ,are it's a frog. They stuff
themâ€”just like chickens."
But he still has his perfumes, i
"Perfumes have always been my
hobby," he said. "I sell some per- |
fume now, but it's still mostly a j
hobby. Some day I'll commercialize !
it, though."
Being interested in organic chem
istry, he studied perfume formulas, j
started synthasizing aromatic com
pounds from foreign oils, compound- j
ing his perfumes. He's going into j
the perfume business when he gets 1
out of Stanford.
He does some of his perfume com- j
pounding here at school, but he does
most of it at his home in Long 1
Beach. A short time ago he re
ceived an order from one of the !
larger Palo Alto beauty parlors for
his perfume. Every Christmas he |
sells a little of it to his friends, most- j
ly at cost.
He is starting a survey later this '

week to find out what perfumes
Farm women like best, how long
they have used them. He will send
out 500 blanks, and is going to try
to get some correlation between
complexion and height, with parti
cular kinds of perfume.
