## 
### PARK KIMBALL 
"The best music that has ever come from a Stanford show," was the
exclamation of Art McCue. "Is Europe?" music director, after running his
orchestra through the nine new numbers early last week in preparation
for final rehearsals of the show.
"The orchestra is stupendous; it's marvelous," reciprocally glowed

Myron Birnbaum, "Is Europe?"
musical brain.
Added to Birnbaum's eulogy were
those of the singing cast of the
Spring Show, who spent yesterday
in the city rehearsing with the or
chestra. Said Owen Clarke, singing
lead of the show:
Band 'Tremendous'
"They are tremendous. I've never
seen anything like them. When they
play their swing you feel just like
climbing up on a chair and yelling
and singing; and the slow, sweet
tunes, like 'Strange as It Seems,'
and 'King on a String,' are really
beautiful."
The 15-piece orchestra, led by
McCue, who has been a Stanford
Band director, dance orchestra lead
er, and symphony leader, is com
posed of a group of San Francisco
musicians who began "jamming"
together for their own amusement
and have kept up the practice.
Included in the band are Frank
Barberia, clarinet artist, Les Le
Tours, trumpet, and a string section
of symphony players.
Not 'Stylized'
The band has not been "stylized,"
for it is reputed to play all music
with equal ease and ability. For"Is
Europe?" it will "strut" the new
numbers through a difficult routine
calling for swing, wacky-wacky,
slow and smooth, Gilbeu and Sulli
van, and subtle accompaniments for
the vocalists.
Tickets are still on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices and at Keeble's in
Palo Alto. Dramatic Manager Clay
McDaniel also announced yesterday
that there were still positions for 10
usherettes.
