A LTHOUGH such a former high
New Deal official as James M.
Landis, once Securities and Ex
change Commissioner and now Dean
of the Harvard Law School, mini
mized the political importance of
the Supreme Court's decision in the
Kansas City stockyards case when
he spoke here last week-end, indi
cations are that a controversy that
may well rival the ill-fated attempt
to reorganize and enlarge the high
est federal court is now developing.
Yesterday Secretary of Agricul
ture Henry A. Wallace, in an ap
parent rejoinder to Chief Justice !
Charles Evans Hughes' declaration !
of a week ago that quasi-judicial ;
agencies such as the National Labor
Relations Board should follow "the
spirit of the fair judge," warned that
a new "battle" to prevent the courts
from restricting the power of the
administrative branch of the gov
ernment has been opened by the
Kansas City decision.
Wallace criticized the court for
"reversing itself" in the stockyards
decision, and attacked a proposal
by a "prominent corporation at
torney whose opinions in the past
have carried great weight in the ,
courts" for transferring rate mak
ing powers from regulatory agen
cies to the courts.
"One year ago a great battle was
fought to decide whether the courts
could take over the function of de
termining policies for the nation,"
he said. "That battle was suspended
when the courts retreated from the
legislative field. This year another
battle seems to be opening."

While Chinese officials in Honan
province announced that "we defi
nitely intend defending Suchow,"
Japanese columns reportedly ad
vanced to the western gates of the
strategic city, where they were held
up by Chinese "big sword" brigades.
The 40-hour long battle now ap
pears to he a race against time for
the Chinese, who are attempting
to locate and cut through at a
weak point in the Nipponese lines
encircling three sides of Suchow.
According to a (official
Japanese news agency) report, Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-Shek had
ordered a Hankow station to broad
cast that Chinese forces should
withdraw from Suchow "without
fighting a decisive battle" and
should "continue guerrilla tactics in
the surrounding country."
