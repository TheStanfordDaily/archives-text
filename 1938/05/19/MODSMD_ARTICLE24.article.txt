### DAVE CUDDY 
The Stanford chapter of Phi Delta
Phi, national legal society for men,
was established in 1897. Over 80
colleges have chapters.
Stanford members consider schol
arship and general congeniality in
choosing their men, although the
only concrete requisite is that each
active be a member of the Stanford
law school.
Four members of the faculty,
Stanley Morrison, George E. Os
borne, Chester G. Vernier, and Jo
seph W. Bingham help keep the at
tendance of the tri-weekly meetings
up to 30.
Dinner Talks Held
The meetings are in the form of'
dinner - discusisons. Usually a
prominent lawyer or banker gives a
short talk on the practical aspects of

the legal profession. In the words of
President Austin H. Peck:
"These meetings broaden our
viewpoints. Law school cannot fa
miliarize us with practical legal
problems, as can these men who are
constantly in touch with the busi
ness world. And the social contacts
themselves are very valuable."
Active in Murals
The fraternity also offers the
grads a chance to exercise by com
peting in intramural athletics. This
year their football and basketball
