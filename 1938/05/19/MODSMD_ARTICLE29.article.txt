# Leadership Group Hears Four Talks
## Speeches on Student Democracy Followed By Short Discussion 
### JIM STONE 
Buckling down to practical prob
lems in student government, Stan
ford Leadership Institute met last
r.ight to consider ways means
of carrying out idealistic aims of
Stanford's democracy.
Four brief speeches by student
leaders opened the second session
of the Institute, followed by 40 min
utes of discussion on questions sug
gested in the initial talks.
First speech was by Harry Horton,
who spoke on committee manage- J
ment. Success of student leaders in
managing committees lies in an
ability to take initiative, to plan
meetings, and to obtain active par
ticipation by all members, he felt.
He warned against discrimination
among individuals in committee dis
cussion, and in designating specific
duties.
Use All of Committee
"Learn to delegate minor work to
others," he said. "Remember that
all of the committee should be used
in planning and carrying out func
tions."
Speaking on long-range planning,
Barbara Murphy discussed the
"spring quarter jam" of activities,
suggested that it could be cured by
a little "fall quarter foresight." Or
ganizations should meet early in fall,
she felt, to plan major activities, de
cide on aims and purpose of the
group.
She cited the proposed Peace
Council as a solution to the problem
which finds committees lying dor
mant throughout the year, only to
make a hurried job on their specific
functions.
Urges Complete Records
Pointing to the A.S.S.U. files as
an example, Barbara Paine, talking
on continuity in committees, said
that all groups should keep de
tailed accounts of meetings, point
ing them to the future. "Too often,"
she said, "new committees cannot
understand what the former body
has done because of inaccuracy or
incompleteness of records." She
also advocated greater contact be
tween new and outgoing organiza
tions to insure greater continuity
from year to year.
As a solution to the problem of
obtaining greater participation in
activities, Ed Barnett, discussing
spreading jobs, advocated the main
tenance and the use of the card file
system. He described the new file
which Ex Committee has set up.
and concluded that it was "up to the
leaders" to make it work.
Following the speeches, the group
of approximately 75 leaders split
into four discussion sessions, chair
manned by Jack Calderwood, Putzie
Hinrichs, Jackie Brown, and John
Dern.
From the groups came a half dozen
suggestions which, members felt,
would do much to further efficiency
in Stanford student government.
Ideas included the establishment of
a personnel manager who would
take charge of the card files and
check up on. committee heads to see
that their jobs were being distribu
ted widely.
To insure more wide-spread in
terest in the card-file, particularly
among freshmen, it was suggested
that information be published in the
Frosh Bible and that during pre
registration program ,sponsors or
special workers carry on interviews
to sign up freshmen for t.he files.

and concluded that it was "up to the
leaders" to make it work.
Following the speeches, the group
of approximately 75 leaders split
into four discussion sessions, chair
manned by Jack Calderwood, Putzie
Hinrichs, Jackie Brown, and John
Dern.
From the groups came a half dozen
suggestions which, members felt,
would do much to further efficiency
in Stanford student government.
Ideas included the establishment of
a personnel manager who would
take charge of the card files and
check up on. committee heads to see
that their jobs were being distribu
ted widely.
To insure more wide-spread in
terest in the card-file, particularly
among freshmen, it was suggested
that information be published in the
Frosh Bible and that during pre
registration program ,sponsors or
special workers carry on interviews
to sign up freshmen for t.he files.
Buckling down to practical prob
lems in student government, Stan
ford Leadership Institute met last
r.ight to consider ways means
of carrying out idealistic aims of
Stanford's democracy.
Four brief speeches by student
leaders opened the second session
of the Institute, followed by 40 min
utes of discussion on questions sug
gested in the initial talks.
First speech was by Harry Horton,
who spoke on committee manage- J
ment. Success of student leaders in
managing committees lies in an
ability to take initiative, to plan
meetings, and to obtain active par
ticipation by all members, he felt.
He warned against discrimination
among individuals in committee dis
cussion, and in designating specific
duties.
Use All of Committee
"Learn to delegate minor work to
others," he said. "Remember that
all of the committee should be used
in planning and carrying out func
tions."
Speaking on long-range planning,
Barbara Murphy discussed the
"spring quarter jam" of activities,
suggested that it could be cured by
a little "fall quarter foresight." Or
ganizations should meet early in fall,
she felt, to plan major activities, de
cide on aims and purpose of the
group.
She cited the proposed Peace
Council as a solution to the problem
which finds committees lying dor
mant throughout the year, only to
make a hurried job on their specific
functions.
Urges Complete Records
Pointing to the A.S.S.U. files as
an example, Barbara Paine, talking
on continuity in committees, said
that all groups should keep de
tailed accounts of meetings, point
ing them to the future. "Too often,"
she said, "new committees cannot
understand what the former body
has done because of inaccuracy or
incompleteness of records." She
also advocated greater contact be
tween new and outgoing organiza
tions to insure greater continuity
from year to year.
As a solution to the problem of
obtaining greater participation in
activities, Ed Barnett, discussing
spreading jobs, advocated the main
tenance and the use of the card file
system. He described the new file
which Ex Committee has set up.
