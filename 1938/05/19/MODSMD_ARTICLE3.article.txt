# 'Is Europe?' Rehearsals Close Today
## Spring Show Gets Final Polishing; Runs Tomorrow, Saturday 
### 
With final dress rehearsal sched
uled for this evening, "Is Europe?",
Stagers Spring Musicorneuy, will re
ceive its final polishing before it is
presented to Stanford audiences to
morrow and Saturday nights.
The past five weeks have been
filled with nightly rehearsals in
which a variety of "different"
routines have been laid out and per
fected. Dance routines are being
used in the Spring Show for the
first time since the last "Follies
Bourgois."
Shirley Jones Sings
Notable among these are the "Bal
kanian Break." led by Shirley Jones,
singing star, and six august "song
and dance" numbers by the Euro
pean diplomats, the latter being of
the Ritz Brothers category.
The musical chorus, for the most
part, is composed of the students of
"Miss Ponkey's Tours," led by Miss
Jones, who sing and dance their way
into exciting and comical diplomatic
situations and out again, while a
fuss-budget prime minister wrings
his hands and gnashes his teeth, and
a milk-fed boy king is restored to
his own.
Final Farm Show
Miss Jones, as Bette, an ail-Ameri
can girl who falls in love with the
king, will sing her final Farm show
in "Is Europe?" after a popular
three-year career. Said to be the
campus' best-known entertainer,
she has been in every Spring Show
and Gaieties since the "Gaieties of
1935."
Jerry Baumgart, publicity direc
tor of Hotel Mark Hopkinks, recently
j said of Miss Jones: "Of all the college
talent that I have ever seen, Shirley
| has by far the greatest professional
| touch." She has sung in the past
with several well-known "name"
bands including that of Jimmy Dor
sey, and sang a summer engage
ment with Freddie Nagel's orchestra.
Clarke Is Male Lead
It will be the last show, also, for
Owen Clarke, male singing lead.
Transferring here from San Diego
a year ago, Clarke captured the lead
in last year's Spring Show, "Down
the Hatch," and since then has
ranked among the top male singers
of the campus.
As Douglas, boy king of Balkania,
Ihe will feature two of the Spring
Show songs, "King on a String" and
"Pleased to Meet You." Spring
Show songs this year will require
45 actual playing minutes.
According to Clay McDaniel, dra-
I matics manager, many students be
| lieve that "Is Europe?" tickets have
! been sold out. However, there are
still good seats for 35, 50, 75 cents,
and a few at $1. Best seats are
available for Saturday night. Mc-
Daniel also stated that more usher
ettes are needed for Friday and
Saturday nights
