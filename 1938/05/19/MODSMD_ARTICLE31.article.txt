# Artist's Model Dies for Love
## Beauty Hopes Lover Will Condone Actions 
### 
CHICAGO, Muy 18 (UP) â€”
Gretchen Bowers, 23, a beautiful
artists' model, telephoned a man
last night and talked about the
rainy weather. Then she put on her
most expensive gown, rouged her
lips, and shot herself to death.
A four-page note to the man was
found on her dressing table. It
said that he had ended their love.
He was identified in the note only
as "Stony." It said in part:
"Stony: You said just before I
left you today, 'whatever you do is
all right with me.' Therefore, I feel
sure you will understand and even
possibly condone the step I am
about to take. Thursday night I felt
not unlike I do now, but the as
surance you gave me then of your
love and your desire of a life for us
together gave me strength and
courage to follow a plan of living
... but with your love for me
gone, as you said, it doesn't seem to
be of much use. . . .
"However, you saw fit to put an
| end to our love and for me it is
truly the end. . . . You see, dar
ling, I do know I was meant to be
yours. I have been and shall al
ways be."
