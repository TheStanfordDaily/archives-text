# Luncheon Club Hears Wilbur On Early Days
## President Says Farm's income Increasing; Sees Bright Future 
### 
"Stanford is built on a firm foun
dation, and 100 years hence I believe j
it will still be one of the great edu
cational institutions of the world,"
said President Ray Lyman Wilbur '
in an informal talk before the j
Luncheon Club yesterday.
Returning to the early days of the j
University, Dr. Wilbur reviewed the |
changes which the years have '
brought to Stanford—in new build
ings, personnel of the faculty, re- i
search and advanced departments, I
degree, number of students, and j
outlook.
In Step With the Times
"Stanford's growth and progress,
from its beginning in the midst of
Senator Stanford's grain-fields to
the present, has followed the gen
eral trend of the times, and done its j
best to satisfy the demands and
pressure which the outside world
has placed upon it," declared Dr.
Wilbur.
Telling of the remarkable growth
in number and in size of the Farm's
advanced departments of medicine,
law. engineering, education, business
administration, and others, Dr. Wil
bur said that this development
would not have been possible with
out increasing financial support
from outside of the University.
Income Increasing
He said that there are still ap
parently enough people who en
dorse the privately endowed uni
versity to provide Stanford with
$1500 a day, and that this figure
was steadily increasing.
Dr. Wilbur described the "cool"
reception that met Stanford's be
ginning in California; and its early
legal and financial difficulties. In
a chance reference he explained the
mystery of the University of Cali
fornia's early matriculation date.
"California opened in August be
cause that was when the wheat was
garnished and thfe farm-boys didn't
have anything else to do but to go
to school. They have never changed
| it," he said.
