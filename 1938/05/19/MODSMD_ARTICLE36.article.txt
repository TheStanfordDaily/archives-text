# Blinding Fog Believed Cause Of Plane Crash
## Passengers' Bodies Found After Search Of L. A. Mountains 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 18 (UP).—A
theory that a new Lockheed airliner
was groping through a blinding fog
for an emergency landing field
when it crashed into a mountain
slope was advanced tonight after
the bodies of its nine occupants were
brought out of the wilderness of
the Sierra Pelona Mountains.
The $80,000 plane, missing since
Monday afternoon when it took off
on a flight to St. Paul, was found
splintered and burned against the
;ide of Stone Mt., 50 miles north
of here. Death apparently had come
instantly to all on board —three men,
four women, and two children.
Only a few miles away is an
emergency landing field, hemmed
n by rugged mountains. Investi
gators said it was likely that Pilot
Sidney Willey, with zero visi
bility, was seeking this haven when
'lis big ship hurtled into the peak at
200 miles an hour and exploded. In
spector Joe Merriott of the De
partment of Air Commerce, after
examining the two demolished mo
tors, said engine trouble had not
been responsible.
Engine Sheared Off
The plane struck with such sud
denness that the pilot had no
chance to cut the ignition. One en
gine was sheared off. It rolled 150
yards down the mountain. The
plintered fuselage was strewn along
a 800-yard blackened path before
coming to rest in a clump of yucca
;nd cacti. All but two bodies were
hurled out by the impact. Those of
ihe pilot and a woman were still
n the wreckage, the woman's body

: escuers had to saw through the
iramework to extricate it.

Wreckage Obscured
A rancher, Walter Petersen, dis
covered the wreckage within a
mile and a half of the Mint Canyon
highway. It had escaped notice yes
terday only because of the fog.
CCC enrollees, fashioning litters of
1 lankets, carried the bodies down to
i le highway, following a trail so
i teep it took them several hours to
j each the waiting ambulances. The
: odies were then taken to morgues
in the valley town of San Fernando,
LOS ANGELES, May 18 (UP).—A
theory that a new Lockheed airliner
was groping through a blinding fog
for an emergency landing field
when it crashed into a mountain
slope was advanced tonight after
the bodies of its nine occupants were
brought out of the wilderness of
the Sierra Pelona Mountains.
The $80,000 plane, missing since
Monday afternoon when it took off
on a flight to St. Paul, was found
splintered and burned against the
;ide of Stone Mt., 50 miles north
of here. Death apparently had come
instantly to all on board —three men,
four women, and two children.
Only a few miles away is an
emergency landing field, hemmed
n by rugged mountains. Investi
gators said it was likely that Pilot
Sidney Willey, with zero visi
bility, was seeking this haven when
'lis big ship hurtled into the peak at
200 miles an hour and exploded. In
spector Joe Merriott of the De
partment of Air Commerce, after
examining the two demolished mo
tors, said engine trouble had not
been responsible.
Engine Sheared Off
The plane struck with such sud
denness that the pilot had no
chance to cut the ignition. One en
gine was sheared off. It rolled 150
yards down the mountain. The
plintered fuselage was strewn along
a 800-yard blackened path before
coming to rest in a clump of yucca
