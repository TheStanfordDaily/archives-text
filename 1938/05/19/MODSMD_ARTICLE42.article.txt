HOLLYWOOD, May 18 (UP). â€”
Dorothy Gish, a beauty of the si
lent screen, decided today that not
even a make-up man could make her
look aged enough for the role of
Eller Fortune in the picture, "Young
in Hearts."
The part of Eller Fortune, for
which the old-time stage favorite,
Maude Adams, had also been con
sidered, was given to Minnie Du
pree, former stage actress. Miss Du
pre'e is 65.
