KANSAS CITY, Kans., May 18
(UP). â€” Francis Chamberlain was
amused when Judge J. Earl Thomas
said he was charged with driving his
car 51 miles an hour. "Your hon
or," said Chamberlain, "I'll bet you
double or nothing my car won't go
that fast." The regular fine for
speeding was $25.
Chamberlain's car was put to a
speed test. It showed 75 miles an
hour potentiality and Chamberlain
paid a $50 fine.
