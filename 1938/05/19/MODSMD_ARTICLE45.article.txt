# Yehudi's Sister Plans Wedding
## Yaltah Menuhin Will Marry William Stix 
### 
LONDON, May 18 (UP). — Ro
mance made a clean sweep in the
musical Menuhin family today
when it was revealed that 16-year
old Yaltah, a vivacious girl in pig
tails who is called "the little devil"
by her father, is engaged to marry
William Stix of St. Louis, Mo.
Stix is an attorney for the Sen
ate's LaFollette Civil Liberties Com
mittee and has offices in W;-,.King
ton.
Disclosure of her engagement —
Papa Moshe Yehudin believes in
early marriages even for geniuses—
came on the heels of announcements
that Yehudi Menuhin, 21-year-old
violinist, will marry the daughter of
a Melbourne, Australia, aspirin mil
lionaire and his sister, Hepzibah, 18,
will marry the Australian million
naire's son.
Hephzibah, who plays the piano
for her brother's violin, and Yaltah
probably will be married in the
United States sometime after Ye
hudi and Nofa Nicholas, 19, are
married in London on May 27.
The father of the Menuhins said
proudly that Yaltah is as promising
a pianist as Hephzibah and "could
play Mozart sonatas with Yehudi as
successfully as Hephzibah if she
wanted to" but she always has had
too many other interests, including
writing poetry in four languages.
