# CAMPUS OPINION
## MAY 1 ASK? ! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I respectfully ask what goo'd
purpose is served by the type of re
view which was accorded the Bach <
Cantata, "Love in a Coffee Cup" on
Page One of the Daily, May 12?
While the critic in this case appar
ently did not care for the cantata or j
its manner of performance — an
opinion which stands alone, so far
as I have been able to determine—
some effort might well have been
expended by the reviewer to under
stand the nature of the composition,!
and the period in which it was com
posed. Perhaps this was done, but'
the review does not show it.
We Are Informed
Instead, we are informed that the
piece was "lacking in action and'
plot"; that it lacked "punch"; that a ]
"noble attempt" by the cast to fill in
the "voids, orchestral interims, and |
long contrapuntal passages" was not I
even mildly successful. We are ad
vised that Jim Barnum was not as
hilarious as he was in "Trial by
Jury."
I hold that this is no way to re
view a campus musical offering per
formed in good faith wholly by ama
tfettrs This particular review is only
an example of many stilted, nega
| tive, uninformed commentaries by
student reviewers of student pro
| ductions, both musical and dramatic.
The critic in this case might have
considered the "Coffee Cantata" as
!an historical musical novelty, and
[ treated its performance in the light
I of J. S. Bach rather than as a re
| flection of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Appreciation Needed
Instead of dwelling on "incessant
repetitions of the words and the
! songs" which "only served to slow
; the show down to a snail's pace"—
j a show of about 20 minutes duration
1 — some appreciation might have
j been offered for the sincere effort
expended by directors and perform
j ers in the many needed rehearsals.
The student orchestra, for example,
1 assembled seven times for practice.
Is it too much to suggest tjiat if
I it is in order for critical reviews of
! student artistic efforts to appear in
| our paper, such criticism be fair and
i intelligent?
Sincerely,
—Elwyn Bugffe.

The Editor, Sir:
May I respectfully ask what goo'd
purpose is served by the type of re
view which was accorded the Bach <
Cantata, "Love in a Coffee Cup" on
Page One of the Daily, May 12?
While the critic in this case appar
ently did not care for the cantata or j
its manner of performance — an
opinion which stands alone, so far
as I have been able to determine—
some effort might well have been
expended by the reviewer to under
stand the nature of the composition,!
and the period in which it was com
posed. Perhaps this was done, but'
the review does not show it.
We Are Informed
Instead, we are informed that the
piece was "lacking in action and'
plot"; that it lacked "punch"; that a ]
"noble attempt" by the cast to fill in
the "voids, orchestral interims, and |
long contrapuntal passages" was not I
even mildly successful. We are ad
vised that Jim Barnum was not as
hilarious as he was in "Trial by
Jury."
I hold that this is no way to re
view a campus musical offering per
formed in good faith wholly by ama
tfettrs This particular review is only
an example of many stilted, nega
| tive, uninformed commentaries by
student reviewers of student pro
| ductions, both musical and dramatic.
The critic in this case might have
considered the "Coffee Cantata" as
!an historical musical novelty, and
[ treated its performance in the light
I of J. S. Bach rather than as a re
| flection of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Appreciation Needed
Instead of dwelling on "incessant
repetitions of the words and the
! songs" which "only served to slow
; the show down to a snail's pace"—
j a show of about 20 minutes duration
1 — some appreciation might have
j been offered for the sincere effort
expended by directors and perform
j ers in the many needed rehearsals.
The student orchestra, for example,
1 assembled seven times for practice.
Is it too much to suggest tjiat if
I it is in order for critical reviews of
! student artistic efforts to appear in
| our paper, such criticism be fair and
i intelligent?
Sincerely,
—Elwyn Bugffe.
