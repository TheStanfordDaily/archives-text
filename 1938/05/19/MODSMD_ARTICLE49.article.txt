# WHAT A JOKE!

; The Editor, Sir:
j World Peace! What a joke!
And with it, the realization of the
! scurvy trick played on me by pro
j fessors too numerous to mention,
j What a chump I was!
For years, a beautiful rationaliza
| tion protected me from the events
j of the last decade. The Italians and
I Germans weren't ready for democ
racy, Ethiopia wasn't civilized, Ja
pan was in dire need of land for a
growing population, Spain had a
long tradition of civil war, and all
through these troubled years I con
| tinued to believe in world peace.
I Surely the League of Nations and
j the World Court were only tempor
! arily weakened. Then a free na-
I tion abruptly died, and Hitler
j marched on, a conquering war lord,
j the idol of the nation.
Paging the League
And the immensity of the lie be
came clearly apparent. How could
you explain the death of the free
nation«jn view of the teachings of
the professors? What good had all
the hollow words done, where were
the League of Nations, the World
Court when the showdown came?
! It all added up to one answer, one
I unyielding, gloomy prospect—war is
inevitable.
All the information I possess has
been the result of teaching, direct
and indirect, and not once did their
philosophy of "Be good to your fel
low man" ever prepare me for the
sight of Chinese with their heads
burnt to a crisp.
Frankly, I don't want my head

burnt to a crisp, I \Vant to be taught i
how to avoid it.
Dr. Graham Stuart, in charge of,
the future peace course, says, "I !
don't see why the elimination of I
war should not be possible, just as
the elimination of slavery was pos- !
sible."
Remember how and by what I
means slavery was abolished?
What we need is a faith, that this !
generation, and myself, facing war, j
can rely upon. We need the truth. |
We don't need sweeping generalities
which claim that democracy is a i
belief that is the best thing for all
peoples at all times, and therefore j
destined to be a world faith, that it |
is a magic formula for solving the |
world ills. We should be taught
that instead of grasping, giving is
best, but jve won't.
The Inevitable Answer
But we won't. Instead we will act
on the basis of Dr. Hu Shis, the j
eminent philosopher, that there are
certain principles worth fighting for!
which cannot be settled by peaceful j
methods, and that anarchist nations j
must be checked by force. And force j
will be the inevitable answer to.
those nations and peoples who are
not open to any kind of argument
or persuasion.
Will the peace course teach us that
in order to secure world peace we
will have to give up, perhaps only
temporarily, some of the privileges
of democracy, and co-operate with
the nations whose idealogies vary
from ours?
War Only Conclusion
You know what I think. There is
not the slightest chance for peace
if we ever have to give up one iota
of democracy and co-operate with
say, a fascist dictator.
As a result, war is the only con
i elusion, and don't neglect the fact
that the gods who play their bloody
fanfare to war have a horribly more
alluring attractiveness, for some in
tangible reason, than even the sirens
of yore.—P.M.
