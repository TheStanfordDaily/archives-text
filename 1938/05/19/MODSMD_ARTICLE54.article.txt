### 
HOLLYWOOD, May 18 (UP). â€”
John Montague, Hollywood's pur- :
ported super-golfer, whose prow
ess and uncanny trick shot ability
have built him into a legend, said
tonight he finally is ready for pub- j
lie appearances and expects soon to j
begin an exhibition tour of the ;
United States.
The statement was the first con- j
crete indication that the man who I
supposedly can clip birds off a j
telephone pole with a mashie shot j
intends to display his wares pub- !
licly.
"I have been working out stead- I
ily for weeks," he explained. "In |
the past five days I have scored two i
rounds of 67 and one of 68 at !
Riviera Country Club. I'm fit I
ready to go as soon as we can iron I
Riviera course in 72.
