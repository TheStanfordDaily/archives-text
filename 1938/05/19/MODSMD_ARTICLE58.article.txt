Ballard Wins
Neil Ballard, frosh captain who
upset Myron Folsom on Tuesday,
again defeated a member of the var

Sherwood Armstrong, 8-6, 7-5.
Ballard was too steady from the
back court and he kept his opponent
on the defensive with frequent ex
cursions to the net. Armstrong had
chances to win both sets, but the
freshman came through with beauti
ful passing shots on each occasion.

over Welby Van Horn, 6-4, 6-4, after
ousting Mel Gallagher in an earlier
round.
