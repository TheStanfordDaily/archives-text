# Varsity. Alumni Water Poloists To Clash Today
## Veteran Team Slated To Start for Cards; Thorntonmen Favored 
### 
A preview of Stanford's 1938 wa
ter polo team will be offered this
afternoon when the potential varsity
meets a squad of alumni and seniors.
Starting time has been set for 4:30
o'clock in Eneina Pools.
Coach Nort Thornton announced
last night that he probably would
j start a veteran team with the ex
i ception of Jack Loupe, who was out ,
of school last season. Loupe has
j had little trouble holding down one
of the forward spots and will team
today with Johnny Lamb, All-Coast
choice as a junior.
Freshmen Star
Bob Allen and Dick Hoover are
, slated to begin at guard with Bill
Hatch and Ted Moreno of the fresh
men ready to play the second half.
Harvey Rothschild will be in at
; centerback with Bob Plate at sprint.
In Roy Vitousek, Thornton has a
| goal guard who is likely to win the
first string post as a sophomore over
veteran Lloyd Wilson. Both will
probably play parts of today's game.
Alumni Stars
For the senior-alumni squad, the
shining lights will be Bill Hanna
and Jack Vibert from the 1937
| squad, Don Peterson, Olympic Club
ace, Bob Haslacher, All-Coast goalie
in '36, and Martin Scatena.
Ben Voss, another All-Coast
choice in his day, may also make an
i appearance, while Hank Aldrich and
1 Sandy Lowengart are expected to
i break into the lineup. Thornton
stated last night that any senior or
graduate on the campus who desired
to play should turn out for the "Old
Men's" lineup.
Varsity Favored
History shows that the varsity us
ually wins over the star-studded
j alumni squads since the seniors and
i grads are in relatively poor condi-
I tion.
The game is closed to women inas
much as the players will be dressed
in the usual "Stanford in the spring"
mode.

ent tees on a Washington, D. C.
