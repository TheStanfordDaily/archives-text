# Brown Cannon Takes Brother In All-U Golf
## Victor Shoots Par Round to Win 6-5; No Matches Today 
### 
Yesterday's only all-University
I golf match turned out to be a happy
i reunion of the Denver Cannon fam
! ily—happy, at least, for Brown Can
; non who was paired with brother
I George in the first round and had
little trouble disposing of him, 6
| and 5.
| His win yesterday advanced Brown
to next week s second round, where
j he will meet the winner of the match
i between Pete Hass and Win Need
ham.
Brown Wins Quickly
Brown didn't lose much time in
| sewing up the game. He took the
j first five holes in rapid order before
brother George had time to catch
his breath. When finally George did
halt his brother's onrush on the
sixth, it was too late.
The damage had already been
done. It was too much to expect
any man to recover a five-hole
deficit. The best George could do
vas hold his brother on fairly even
| terms for the remaining holes, los
j ing only one more in 15.
Par Game
Scorecards explained the reason
l for Brown's easy win. He went
! around in even par figures, while
i George was five strokes over.
No matches have been scheduled
j for today. The six remaining first
rounds will probably be played to
| morrow with the quarter-finals next
; week. The 36-hole semi-finals are
| slated for a week from Saturday
! and the finals a week from Sunday.
