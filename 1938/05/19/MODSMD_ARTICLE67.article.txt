Alpha Del Is 17. S.A.E. 3.

The Alpha Delts became the cham
pions of hardball league A by virtue
of their 17-3 win over S.A.E. yester
dt y. Led by Pitcher Art Stoefen,
who struck 04.1t 12 and hit a home
run, the Alpha Delts slammed the
ball all over the field to gain their
victory.
The recent game between Kaopa
Sigma and Sigma Nu, which the lat
ter won, was protested, and then
awarded to the Kappa Sigs because
their opponents used an ineligible
man. However, there is a possibility
that the game may be played over
by the end of the week.
Kappa Sigma went into the finals
of the softball playoffs when they
defeated last year's champs, the
Business School, by the score of 10
to 3. Kenny Peters turned in his
usual good pitching performance,
and Louie Tsoutsouvas hit four for
four. Woody Bohbskey hit a home
run. They will play the winner of
the other semi-final game between
Encira 4W and the Fijis which is to
be played Monday.
A case in London's Old Bailey
police court was delayed recently
because the barrister was inad
j vertently locked in a cell while in
! terviewing his client.
