### 
PHILADELPHIA, May 18 (UP).
â€” Pennsylvania Democrats repulsed
John L. Lewis' bid for political
power in this state by defeating
Thomas A. Kennedy, candidate of a
short-lived New Deal-CIO primary
coalition, for nomination for the of
fice of governor, rapidly completing
returns of the primary election
showed tonight.
Conservative organization Re
publican candidates swept to vic
tory with one exception. Repub
licans consistently polled more heav
ily than did Democratic candidates.
Available returns from 7,176 of
8,976 precincts gave:
For governor:
Democrats, Thomas A. Kennedy,
461,362; Charles J. Margiotti, 176,-
269; Charles Alvin Jones, 547,023.
Republicans, Arthur H. James,
873,564; Frank P. B. Thompson, 17,-
674; James Jones, 37,176; Gifford
Pinchot, 412,851.
For U. S. senator:
Democrats, Eddie McCloskey, 100,-
429; S. Davis Wilson, 300.418:
George M. Earle, 699,858.
Republicans, James J. Davis, 727,-
205; G. Mason Owlett, 414,172; Ed
ward L. Stokes, 45,940.
Democratic returns not only re
buffed Lewis but tarnished the pres
tige of Chairman James A. Farley
of the Democratic National Com
mittee who at the last moment en
dorsed a compromise ticket includ
ing Kennedy in an efTort to mini
mize the primary battle. Farley
warned that the intra-party feud
ing imperiled party success in No
vember.
The primary campaign, marked
by name-calling, demands of "stop j
thief" and a varied assortment of !
graft and corruption charges among
contesting Democrats, has left the
New Deal machine shaken. But the |
extent of the damage is not yet j
known nor can President Roosevelt's
personal vote-pulling power be dis
counted in attempting to judge the
chances of the major parties against {
each other in their big contest in
November.
