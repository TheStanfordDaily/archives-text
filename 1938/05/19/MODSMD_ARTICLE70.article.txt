# It Depresses Us
## 
### 
ANOTHER one of the beautifully fragile ideals
that we got from the Grimm brothers and
Kathleen Norris was shattered the other night.
It happened at Ex Committee meeting when the
married men among the students applied for a
budget of 575 a guarter.
It was not that we minded seeing the $75 so
hotly pursued. There is no closed season on
A.S.S.U. funds, and organizations traditionally
hunt them, if only for the thrill of the chase.
But it pained us to find that the married men
consider their happiness incomplete without
financial assistance.
Of course, we had already lost faith in the
shining picture of the prince and princess rid
ing off to a castle complete with modern plumb
ing where they devoted their time to living
happily ever after. And we were aware that
financial indices list no love exchange rate. But
we had treasured the idea that marriage could
get along without an A.S.S.U. subsidy.
It indicates, we suppose, the breakdown of
the patriarchal family. It is just a sign of the
times, and we shan't let it spoil our digestion.
Even so, it depresses us.
Our pioneer ancestors hiked out into the
wilderness and settled down in couples. For
a special treat they used to climb a couple of
mountains and ford a couple of rivers to call
on the neighbors. They didn't ask help from
the A.S.S.U.
And how would King Arthur have felt if the
married knights had dropped around and said,
"My lord, we need an appropriation to hold a
social"?
It isn't as though the married men were not
getting the same benefits from community fees
as the students are. The gym, the health serv
ice, and all lectures are open to them.
The whole thing seems to boil down to the
fact that they think they are different because
they are married. That is what pains us. Mar
riage, we thought, was not a thing that de
manded compensation.
The one bright feature of the situation is that
it makes us feel a little less sorry for the seven
dwarfs that Snow White jilted.â€”J. C.
