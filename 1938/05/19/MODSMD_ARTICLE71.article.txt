# Gold Bricks and Glass Houses
## 
### 
NO ONE that I know of has ever tried to sell
a gold-brick to a Stanford man. But judg
ing by what Stanford will swallow in other
lines without even a meditative bite, it might
be worth trying.
The almost bucolic gullibility with which
Stanfordites accept deprecatory statements
about the University was brought up yesterday
at Luncheon Club. Someone asked Dr. Wil
bur about the validity of so-called "official"
rankings (usually issued by rival schools)
which often rate Stanford far down in the list
of universities. Dr. Wilbur made our point
then that for Stanford, hearing is believing
without guestion when aspersions are cast.
Let a rival university issue a pamphlet indi
cating that Stanford caters to high-grade
morons, and the campus gulps once, and then
comes crying to the faculty that something
must be done. Or let a rival coach advance
the theory that Stanford's athletic staff is so
feeble it is a shame to compete with their
teams, and, as actually happened in Dr. Wil
bur's experience, a delegation of Stanford
alumni storms the administration.
Probably the naivete of Stanford comes from
pure self-consciousness. Like most adolescents,
it doesn't know what to do with its hands. But
even a callow youth doesn't consider cutting
them off because someone remarks on their
size.

Or perhaps Stanford is still just young
enough to be frightened by its own shadow.
And when the shadow is thrown by the false
light of prejudiced and untrustworthy sources,
it really runs home to mother.
All mother can do is show that the big
boogy-man of degeneration is nothing but a
large bag of wind which has blown around the
corner. But Stanford soon forgets and comes
back shivering again. Some day, perhaps, it
will learn to greet the trumped-up ghost with
a well juxtaposed thumb to the nose.â€”J. S.
