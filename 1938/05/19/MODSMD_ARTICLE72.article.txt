# Handled with Kerr
## 
### 
APPOINTMENT of next year's debate man
er this week officially took from Ed Kerr the
managerial gavel. And it is one well worn with
use. He can regard its smooth head with sat
isfaction as he reflects on the foundation of
the Radio Debate League, as he reckons up
the large number of active debaters, and as
traces the miles of travel covered in Stanford
forensic treks.
It would be unfair to past debate managers
to claim that Kerr is solely responsible for one
of Stanford's minor prides and joys. The on
ward-and-upward movement in Farm debating
has been in progress for several years now.
But much credit is due to him for keeping
debating on the upswing, for leaving it just a
little farther along the road than he found it.
For his work this year, then, a bouquet—per
haps of Four Roses.—J. S.
