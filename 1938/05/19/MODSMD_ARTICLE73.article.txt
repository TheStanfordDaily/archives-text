| NCONSPICUOUS, unnoticed, and left strictly to
themselves, the Stanford Museum and Stanford Art
Gallery go their neglccted ways from month to month
with little or no recognition from the student-body that
they even exist.
Partly, this is due to ordinary apathy; but chiefly,
it would seem, it is due to a certain improvidence
which has always characterized the relations of the
University with any of its cultural enterprises which are
longer on art than money, and particularly with these
two most profitless projects of all.
In the founding grant Senator and Mrs. Stanford
stated among other things that they wished to provide
" . . a university for both sexes, with . . . museums,
galleries of art . . ." When the University was estab
lished, the Museum and Art Galjery were built, but
built with a singular lack of foresight which first
separated them, and then placed them half a mile
apart.
Discharging much the same cultural functions, they
were housed in different buildings so inconveniently
placed in relation to one another that Director Pedro
de Lemos and his staff are forced to shuttle back and
forth across the campus, splitting duties which right
fully should be co-ordinated in one place under one
roof.
The improvidence extended further. It has, as a
matter of fact, extended down the years to the present,
and will probably continue on for some years to come.
Minimum budgets and official disregard have been the
chief gestures in the direction of maintaining and fur
thering the Stanfords' cultural behest.
It seems almost superfluous—and not very wise—to
suggest further building to a University which is
building rapidly now. But if, on that great day when
somebody dies and wills us 50 million, someone could
remember the plight of the Museum and the Art Gal
lery, it might be a very nice thing.
They might be placed under one roof for instance;
probably'the Museum itself could be enlarged, the Art
Gallery transferred to it. And they might be given a
budget, so that their directors could do things a Uni
versity as advanced as this should do.
Students still might not go, perhaps; but the en
hanced prestige Stanford would receive from a really
up-to-date and progressive art gallery, and a really
complete and interesting museum, would more than
make up for undergraduate apathy.—Allen Drury.

built with a singular lack of foresight which first
separated them, and then placed them half a mile
apart.
Discharging much the same cultural functions, they
were housed in different buildings so inconveniently
placed in relation to one another that Director Pedro
de Lemos and his staff are forced to shuttle back and
forth across the campus, splitting duties which right
fully should be co-ordinated in one place under one
roof.
The improvidence extended further. It has, as a
matter of fact, extended down the years to the present,
and will probably continue on for some years to come.
Minimum budgets and official disregard have been the
chief gestures in the direction of maintaining and fur
thering the Stanfords' cultural behest.
It seems almost superfluous—and not very wise—to
suggest further building to a University which is
building rapidly now. But if, on that great day when
somebody dies and wills us 50 million, someone could
remember the plight of the Museum and the Art Gal
lery, it might be a very nice thing.
They might be placed under one roof for instance;
probably'the Museum itself could be enlarged, the Art
Gallery transferred to it. And they might be given a
budget, so that their directors could do things a Uni
versity as advanced as this should do.
Students still might not go, perhaps; but the en
hanced prestige Stanford would receive from a really
up-to-date and progressive art gallery, and a really
complete and interesting museum, would more than
make up for undergraduate apathy.—Allen Drury.
