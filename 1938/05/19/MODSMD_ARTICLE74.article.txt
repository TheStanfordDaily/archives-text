VANCE notices are very likely deceptive, es
pecially for a student production, but the chances
are that the build-up for the Spring Show will not fall
too far short of the mark. At least, it ought to out
class the Spring Shows of the past, which, while often
amusing enough in their own way, haven't been much
more than a second Big Game Gaieties with a rather
thin thread of continuity. In glancing over the script
for"Is Europe?", the show seems to shape up more
like a real musical comedy than just a jumbled variety
show.
Of course it has the usual touring bunch of college
students, who always proceed to throw havoc into any
status quo which they happen upon, but co-writers
Hal Kahn and Ed Kerr seem to have gotten more out
ol the rut than Spring Shows in the past.

FOR the music, which is just about the founda
tion of all campus shows, it sounds mighty good,
the snatches I have heard. The old team of Cahn-
Roberts have turned out some tunes which, if not as
strikingly good as the general run in this fall's Gaieties,
still sound better than all right. And there has been
nothing but incoherent raves about the orchestra.
Art McCue, one-time leader of the Stanford Band, has
brought together an aggregation, which, if rumors may
he believed, is the biggest thing to hit the campus
since 190 G. And the old war-horse of campus musi
cals, Myron Birnbaum, has been turning out good
arrangements as fast as he could put pencil to paper.
The cast we can put our shirt on from experience.
All the old stand-bys, and some new ones will he
there. Whether the show it elf is good or bad, it will
he good fun to see the kids perform. From Shirley
Jones 011 down, they have really earned their medals;
now, in the last campus show for many of the n, they
can give them a final polish.
It sounds like a -good deal all around. They tell
me that one house on the campus is going wide-open
Friday night with Spring Show dates followed by
their house dance. With the weather what it is. and
the production what it ought to be. Stanford should
really blossom with the- flowers that bloom in the
Spring Show Stone.
