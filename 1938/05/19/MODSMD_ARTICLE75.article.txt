# Helen Hayes Triumphs In Victoria Role
## 
### 
"Victoria Regina," currently play
ing at San Francisco's Curran and '
starring Helen Hayes:

Unlike many
plays which have j
coasted to glory
on Time Square's]
say-so, this touted |
production ha s j
been hailed justi- |
fiably.
Without bandy
ing historical fact
or stooping to
mere flippancy,

playwright Laurence Houseman
gently ribs the good queen. But
more than that, he juggles his ma- ]
terial intelligently to slant Victoria !
in more than one light—to enlist our i
sympathies for her in spite of her j
foibles.
As a matter of fact, his whole j
chronicle hinges on the develop
ment of this one character. And the i
plot events—how Victoria greeted
the news of her accession in a night- '
gown, how Lord Melbourne stubbed
his toe on her obstinacy, how her
beloved husband Albert wheedled
the sceptre from her, and how she is j
finally wheeled out on the parapet i
of Windsor to greet the Diamond I
Jubilee mobs—all parallel her prog- I
ress as a personality.
Ilaycs Bears Brunt
For that reason, Helen Hayes, as
Victoria, bears the brunt of the i
whole drama. To boost Miss Hayes' j
performance at this point is like !
sticking a brick on top of the Tower
of Babel. Just where her superb J
artistry lies in moulding this char- |
acter is so obvious that I hate to
point it out.
Without dazzling the audience by j
showmanship, she marshals out just j
enough theatrical tricks to hold the '
stage for a whole three acts. More- |
over, instead of patching piece-meal
the fragments of her portrayal, she
kneads them into a smooth unity. !
No seam shows in her transition
from a skittery young girl to a !
doughty oid widow vegetating in
flowery reveries.
Comedy Played to Hilt
Without malice, she plays the j
comedy to the hilt. In a combination I
of waddle and scoot, she waltzes
through the palace halls like a prop
er little toy duck on wheels. By
bridling in jealous rage, or ker
plunking into a positive statement,
she points brilliantly Victoria's lack
of subtlety and humor.
Yet, Miss Hayes takes a different j
tack in handling with dignity the 1
Queen's love for her husband. Nor
was Victoria's bristling energy al- I
ways funny. And Miss Hayes re- j
spects the fact that Victoria got a I
good deal done in her life.
Prince Albert No Foil
On the other hand, Prince Albert
was i#)t written into the script as a
foil for his wife. And Werner Bate
man in the role capitalized shrewd
ly on his chances. His Albert was
gentle, lovable, and innocent, but
at the same time a statesman of no
puny proportions.
The whole production, from the
mounting up, is worth the reserva
tions you put in last year.—Slater.
