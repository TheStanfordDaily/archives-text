I^TNETEEN- FOUR TEEN, the dip
lomats predicted at its begin
ning, was to be "a peaceful year," a
respite for a Europe that had passed
from crisis to crisis, in Turkey, the
Balkans, and Morocco, during the
previous decade.
While none dared to say that
there would be no war, the general
opinion of those months — this is
made clear by the memoirs of Sir
Edward Grey, the British Liberal
foreign minister—was that in the
informal London "conference of
ambassadors" a practical technique
had been devised for the successful
mediation of the next international
crisis.
This did not prove the case after
Sarajevo, and war came because
nations on both sides could no long
er tolerate further compromise of
their national interests.
A .somewhat similar process of
blundering into war may be dis
cerned abroad, where tension is
mounting between Italy, and
France, which is tacitly support
ed by Great Britain.
Reports of heavy shipments of
arms over the French frontier to
the Spanish Loyalists, and of the
concentration of 30,000 Italian
Libyan troops along the eastern
border of the French North Af
rican colony of Tunisia furnish
the background for the pressure
which the Ang'|f>-Frcnch entente
is putting upon Benito Mussolini.

In Paris yesterday, Radical Social
ist Premier Edouard Daladier is
sued a pointed warning to II Duce
that France will fight for the "in
violability" of its continental and
colonial frontiers, and emphasized
that tor France "her will to peace
is her first guarantee; her force is
her supreme guarantee."
Whatever the circumstances,
France is capable of assuring alone
the inviolability of her frontiers
and that of her empire, of safe
guarding the independence and
integrity of her territory against
all attempts at violence," be said.
"France will persist in proving her
close union, her calm self-posses
sion. She can do it, because she
is strong."

J>ECAUSE he foresees a "serious"
relief crisis in the near future in
U. S. industrial centers, Works
Progress Administrator Harry L.
Hopkins said that the WPA will
have to increase its rolls to a new
record peak of between 2,800,000 and
3,000,000 persons.
He said the increase would be
necessary because the continued
business depression has brought the
exhaustion of resources of the unem
ployed.
Hopkins blamed the Ohio and
Illinois state legislators for the
critical relief situations in Cleve
land and Chicago, and said that
sufficient funds were available in
both states to meet immediate
needs.

Leaders of Ihe "Big Four" rail
brotherhoods, at an emergency
meeting in Chicago, warned rail
executives that "the only ultimate
result of the 15 per cent wage cut
for 1,000,000 workers "will be a na
tion-wide strike."
Both Herbert Hoover and Alf M.
Landon renewed their attacks upon
New Deal principles, with the ex-
President telling a Chicago Boys'
Club convention that "just as Fas
cists build their boys to support a
Spartan state, we want our boys to
support a Democratic state." In
Lynn, Mass., Mr. Landon told a
Methodist conference that both the
churches and representative gov
ernment are threatened by "theories
of absolutism."
Summary: Japanese held "victory
celebrations" for their army's com
pleted occupation of Suchow-fu,
where they asserted that more than
100,000 Chinese had been "put out of
action," and prepared to push on to
Hankow and "the military heart of
China." —In Spain, Insurgents re
ported wiping out a 16-rhile-deep
Loyalist salient on the Mediter
