# Western Civ Allstars To Play Encina Nine
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
History is in the making!
Pedagogues of the Western Civ
department will take on an all-star
baseball team from Encina this aft
ernoon at 3:30 o'clock on the foot
ball practice field, for the cellar
Softball championship of the West
Coast Farm League.
Captained by Max Savelle, the
professors boast a united front.
Professor Bradley, whose famous
"smoke-up" ball is guaranteed to
make the opposition head for green
er pastures, will pitch, while Cap
tain Savelle is ready to act as the
other half of the battery.
Errorless Field
The bobble-less infield of Fisher,
Barker, Spaulding, and Warner, for
the teachers, has been in competi
tion against the Encina gang for two
and a half quarters, and is in high
spirits for the encounter this after
noon.
Rumor has it that the professors'
"million-dollar" inlield is quoting
odds that tlie frosh will throw the
game away on fumbles. "An error
less performance is not synonymous
to Encina." one told his class, but
unbiased onlookers claim he was re
ferring to the mid-quarter.
McCarthy Refuses Offer
Advance notices had it that the
department was trying to coax Lou
Gehrig and Joe I)iMagi>i<> into the
st - 'ft for the " inv hut ,tr»e McCar

thy, manager of the Yankees, put a
stop to any exodus by explaining,
"My boys are not ready for such
hot competition."
Frosh stalwarts are planning to
come onto the field with red apples
in their hands, hoping that the sight
may throw their opponents into too
good humor to even be able to hit
the ball, which will also be painted
red and polished.
Frosh Fear Finals
Meanwhile frosh prexy Art Gore
is having difficulty rounding up a
team. First-planned squad handed
in its resignation when finals were
brought to its attention by history
professors. His final selection is be
ing kept secret lest "black hand"
letters imperil their bawlout aver
ages.
At a late hour yesterday Professor
Savelle was cornered and reminded
that an umpire was essential. Said
Savelle, "Umpire? Mr. Edgar Eu
gene Robinson is the man we need!"
Mr. Robinson is reported in hiding.

History is in the making!
Pedagogues of the Western Civ
department will take on an all-star
baseball team from Encina this aft
ernoon at 3:30 o'clock on the foot
ball practice field, for the cellar
Softball championship of the West
Coast Farm League.
Captained by Max Savelle, the
professors boast a united front.
Professor Bradley, whose famous
"smoke-up" ball is guaranteed to
make the opposition head for green
er pastures, will pitch, while Cap
tain Savelle is ready to act as the
other half of the battery.
Errorless Field
The bobble-less infield of Fisher,
Barker, Spaulding, and Warner, for
the teachers, has been in competi
tion against the Encina gang for two
and a half quarters, and is in high
spirits for the encounter this after
noon.
Rumor has it that the professors'
"million-dollar" inlield is quoting
odds that tlie frosh will throw the
game away on fumbles. "An error
less performance is not synonymous
to Encina." one told his class, but
unbiased onlookers claim he was re
ferring to the mid-quarter.
McCarthy Refuses Offer
Advance notices had it that the
department was trying to coax Lou
Gehrig and Joe I)iMagi>i<> into the
st - 'ft for the " inv hut ,tr»e McCar

thy, manager of the Yankees, put a
stop to any exodus by explaining,
"My boys are not ready for such
hot competition."
Frosh stalwarts are planning to
come onto the field with red apples
in their hands, hoping that the sight
may throw their opponents into too
good humor to even be able to hit
the ball, which will also be painted
red and polished.
Frosh Fear Finals
Meanwhile frosh prexy Art Gore
is having difficulty rounding up a
team. First-planned squad handed
in its resignation when finals were
brought to its attention by history
professors. His final selection is be
ing kept secret lest "black hand"
letters imperil their bawlout aver
ages.
At a late hour yesterday Professor
Savelle was cornered and reminded
that an umpire was essential. Said
Savelle, "Umpire? Mr. Edgar Eu
gene Robinson is the man we need!"
Mr. Robinson is reported in hiding.
