Roble Club plans to hold a formal
farewell dinner Monday night at
6:15 o'clock in the Lagunita dining
hall. Dean Mary Yost, Miss Louise
Price, Miss Doyle, and this year's
sponsors will be honored guests.
The dinner is the last time that
all of Roble will meet together for
mally and is being held in Lagunita
so that a single group will be poss
ible. In exchange for the use of
their dining hall, Roble is giving the
Lagunitans a picnic supper.
Anne Townsend is in charge of the
entertainment and has arranged to
have Dean Yost, Mrs. Leona Die
kema, and Helen Dohrman, who was
president of Roble Club during the
first part of the year, speak. Also,
there will be a reading by Mar
garet Miedel, an accordion solo by
Julia Johnson, and a song by a
group of Robleites directed by
Lydia Wood.
