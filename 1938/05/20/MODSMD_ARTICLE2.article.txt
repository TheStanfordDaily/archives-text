# Spring Show Makes First Bow Tonight
## Nine Student-Written Songs Featured In "Is Europe?" Script 
### 
Stanford's newest and gayest mu- I
I sicomedy, "Is Europe?" will be pre
| sented by Stagers tonight and to
i morrow night in Memorial Hall at
' 8:15 o'clock, starring Sihrley Jones
i and Owen Clarke and featuring
j nine student-written songs played
| by a top-notch, newly "discovered"
I orchestra.
"Is Europe?", often misconstrued
j because of its title to be a serious
I satire on world affairs, is, in direct
I contrast, a burlesque with the in
ternational situation only a faint
web over which the plot is woven,
and in which no attempt has been
; to achieve anything other than
comedy and entertainment.
Life-like Caricatures
Each famous person portrayed is
i carcatured in speech and action al
| though, in physical appearance
I achievement of life-likeness has
j been emphasized.
Joe Duce, who may resemble an
j Italian, II Duce, speaks with the dia
j lect and accent of an Italian fruit
I vendor. Zsho Sshapan, "Is Eu
; rope's?" Nipponese diplomat, will
! remind many to pay their laundry
j bill. Similarly, each representative
j of the six major powers savors dis
j tinctly of the outstanding traits and
| idiosyncrasies of his own country.
Izzy vs. Joe
The German-Jew relationship is
I given the spotlight as Joe Furor,
I counterpart of "der Fuehrer," stalks
I goose-stepping onto the scene,
j whereupon Izzy A. Ryan, fruit, ra
zor-blade, and gulfelte-fish peddler
I pulls a pistol from his pocket and
| shoots himself.
Joe Furor grunts and makes an
j other mark in his little black book;
! but Izzy rises as Furor stalks off
I and leeringly adds "blank cart
! ridges" to his sales harangue.
Love Scenes Subtle
Subtle and sophisticated are the
; love scenes written into the show
I by the authors who have endeavor
|ed to make college love scenes
"grow up" from the usual run of
collegiate necking. Love interest
will be supplied by Shirley Jones
and Owen Clarke with the inspira
tion of three songs, "Strange As It
Seems," "Pleased to Meet You," and
"King on a String."
The program will last until ap
proximately 10:45 o'clock.
