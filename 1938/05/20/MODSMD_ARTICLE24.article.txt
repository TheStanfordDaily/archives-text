# Water Witch Fails To Distract Tolman
## 
### 
When Professor Cyrus Fisher Tol-
man, who will retire at the end of
this quarter after 26 years of teach-
ing in Stanford's Geology depart-
ment, started his work on ground
water in Santa Clara County he re
ceived the following letter:
"Dear Sir:
I am interested in your ground
water expert series.
I am a water witch. I have the
.supernatural magical power in me
to locate ground water. I can tell
you if the level is high or low.
When I saw your picture in the
San Jose Mercury-Herald and
read the article, I just took it upon
myself to write this to you.
Sincerely,

j But, in spite of this offer, Profes
sor Tolman continued with his sur
| vey, and has gone so far as to write
j the first book in the English lan
guage on the subject of ground wa
j ter.
In fact, he will continue with his
! work even after retirement.
"Ground, water will always be
with us and there'll always be work
to be done on the study of it," he
said.
According to his recent data, the
Santa Clara Valley has sunk 5Vi
feet since 1911. The extraordinary
sinking, he believes is caused "by the
withdrawal by overpumping of
ground water.
Sinking Slowly
There is an indication that the
sinking has slowed down during the
past year—due to the installation of
conservation dams —but, Professor
Tolman believes the sinking is a
permanent condition.
"Professor Tolman is very jovial.
This, and his wide practical ex
perience make him an interesting
lecturer," remarked Joseph Poland,
his associate on the Santa Clara
project.
"He has one eccentricity—which
has a common sense basis —and that
is, of carrying three pipes around
with him. This enables Professor
Tolman, always to have a 'cool'
smoke," continued Mr. Poland.
Chicago Graduate
Professor Tolman came to Stan
ford in 1912 from Arizona, where,
for the two preceding years he had
been a territorial geologist. He
graduated from the University of

I Chicago in 189G, and has taught
geology and mining there and later
lat the University of Arizona.
At Stanford he organized the
j course in summer geology, the first
course in practical geology in Ameri
can colleges.
Professor Tolman has one son
j now attending Stanford, Cyrus Tol
man Jr. He will graduate this June.
The members of the Geology De-
I partment have arranged a compli
i mentary dinner in honor of Profes
j .sor Tolman on next Tuesday at 6:15

j the first book in the English lan
guage on the subject of ground wa
j ter.
In fact, he will continue with his
! work even after retirement.
"Ground, water will always be
with us and there'll always be work
to be done on the study of it," he
said.
According to his recent data, the
Santa Clara Valley has sunk 5Vi
feet since 1911. The extraordinary
sinking, he believes is caused "by the
withdrawal by overpumping of
ground water.
Sinking Slowly
There is an indication that the
sinking has slowed down during the
past year—due to the installation of
conservation dams —but, Professor
Tolman believes the sinking is a
permanent condition.
"Professor Tolman is very jovial.
This, and his wide practical ex
perience make him an interesting
lecturer," remarked Joseph Poland,
his associate on the Santa Clara
project.
"He has one eccentricity—which
has a common sense basis —and that
is, of carrying three pipes around
with him. This enables Professor
Tolman, always to have a 'cool'
smoke," continued Mr. Poland.
Chicago Graduate
Professor Tolman came to Stan
ford in 1912 from Arizona, where,
for the two preceding years he had
been a territorial geologist. He
graduated from the University of

I Chicago in 189G, and has taught
geology and mining there and later
lat the University of Arizona.
At Stanford he organized the
j course in summer geology, the first
course in practical geology in Ameri
can colleges.
Professor Tolman has one son
j now attending Stanford, Cyrus Tol
man Jr. He will graduate this June.
The members of the Geology De-
I partment have arranged a compli
i mentary dinner in honor of Profes
j .sor Tolman on next Tuesday at 6:15
I o'clock in the Union. All friends of
j Professor Tolman are invited to at
{ tend the dinner which will be in
i formal.
When Professor Cyrus Fisher Tol-
man, who will retire at the end of
this quarter after 26 years of teach-
ing in Stanford's Geology depart-
ment, started his work on ground
water in Santa Clara County he re
ceived the following letter:
"Dear Sir:
I am interested in your ground
water expert series.

.supernatural magical power in me

you if the level is high or low.
When I saw your picture in the
San Jose Mercury-Herald and
read the article, I just took it upon
myself to write this to you.
