Lack of Participation
"Political democracy is weaken

of the lack of participation of the
people. They neglect the running

for their own economic ends until
democracy is almost snatched away,
j The Model legislature is one way of

creed you are, you have the right
to think and say what you believe,
no matter what it is. People should
have the courage to express their
views and then stand up and light
for them."
