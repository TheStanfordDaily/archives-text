Purpose of School
The Pacific Coast Worker's
School, which operates for a month
each summer, exists to provide an
opportunity for workers and em
ployers alike to study the social and
economic problems of present-day
society. Last summer nine out of
the total of 75 workers registered
were college students. Other col
leges besides Stanford sending dele
gates included University of Cali
fornia, Pomona College and Occi
dental College.
At Stanford an independent stu
dent-faculty committee each year
solicits scholarships from the vari
ous campus organizations and
chooses student delegates according
to the number of scholarships they
collect. Last year those contributing
scholarships included Pan-Hellenic,
Roble, Sequoia, and Miss Yost.
