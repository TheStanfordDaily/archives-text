mitted only 15 entries from any
of the P.C.C. teams in the coast j
meet at Los Angeles, and as far as j
Stanford is concerned that would be
a swell set-up this year again.
However, the big-wigs decided to
open the field wide this season, and j
any team can enter as many men as |
it wants, with a certain restriction
011 number of entries in any one
event, of course. With that situa
tion holding, Cal and U.S.C. have a
big edge in the Berkeley meet over
the schools that are short on bulk
but long in a couple of suits.
Mind you, this isn't a beef. There
have been years when Stanford,
wilff a wealth of material in all
events, would have welcomed such
a change, and there will be years
again when (hat will bold true.
However, it's a cinch that the
edge U.S.C. and Cal already hold
over the rest of the coast track
teams will be lengthened by the
open-entry regulation.
At the same time, Troy and the
Bears won't have the easy time of it j
they have had in dual meets this j
season, because of the fact that the
agglomeration of stars from' the 10
teams of the conference is bourn' to
break up the first places to a cer
tain extent.
That fact will help the schools with j
only few outstanding performers, |
like Stanford. Where Stanford had j
to worry about all the seconds and
thirds against Southern Cal and Cal,
the boys won't have that trouble this
time, quite so much. Enough first
places can win the meet—remember
the seven-man squad that went back
to win the 1.C.4-A a few years ago?

4 MONG other things, Stanford
will have seven men this year
who were entered in (he conference
meet last season. Captain Malott,
Stan Hiserman, Ed Burrows, Tom
Montgomery, Pete Zagar, Hugh
Gribbin, and Bill Hawkins will un
doubtedly be entered in the meet
this year.
Of that seven, two have no ex
cuses for not being the favorites
in their events—Malott in the 440
and Zagar in the discus. Zagar
hasn't been throwing the way he
should be, but if he'd ever start
winging 'em he'd throw that dis- j
cus out of the park. Potentially
lie's the best in the meet, in spite
of Holland of Oregon and Gaspar
of U.S.C.
There can be no question of Ma
lott's ability in the quarter. It is
not without the realm of imagina
tion to see him winning the 220, too,
but U.S.C. sure has the kids in the
sprints.
If that bird Zamperini would stay
out of the two-mile Ed Burrows
could come home on top, but the
Trojan rebel (he's gonna compete in
the Princeton Invitational if they
won't send him to the 1.C.4-A) prob
ably won't be content with the mile
and the 880. Burrows could still
;ive him a foot-race, figuring he
stayed out of the mile and kept
j'resh, but that's not at all likely.
If Montgomery could put one
out where it belongs he wouldn't
have any trouble beating Strode,
the U.C.L.A. Negro who is ad
mittedly the class of the loop now.
Whether the giant can ever get
back to the form that saw him hit
52 feet (> inches is problematical.
Gribbin might be the boy that will
surprise them all in the discus —
with him pitching Stanford has a
grand opportunity for first and sec
ond, even though any dopester's
conscience will warn him Zagar and
Gribbin are also liable to be third
and fourth.
On top of last year's holdovers,
the Cards include this husky-legged
Russ Wulff, who is about due to win
one of the big meets with something
around 6 feet 7 inches. Outside of
him Stanford can't look for any
more firsts. Thinking of winning
the meet is akin to star-gazing, but
it sure is a lot of fun.—Peterson.

4 MONG other things, Stanford
will have seven men this year
who were entered in (he conference
meet last season. Captain Malott,
Stan Hiserman, Ed Burrows, Tom
Montgomery, Pete Zagar, Hugh
Gribbin, and Bill Hawkins will un
doubtedly be entered in the meet
this year.
Of that seven, two have no ex
cuses for not being the favorites
in their events—Malott in the 440
and Zagar in the discus. Zagar
hasn't been throwing the way he
should be, but if he'd ever start
winging 'em he'd throw that dis- j
cus out of the park. Potentially
lie's the best in the meet, in spite
of Holland of Oregon and Gaspar
of U.S.C.
There can be no question of Ma
lott's ability in the quarter. It is
not without the realm of imagina
tion to see him winning the 220, too,
but U.S.C. sure has the kids in the
sprints.
If that bird Zamperini would stay
out of the two-mile Ed Burrows
could come home on top, but the
Trojan rebel (he's gonna compete in
the Princeton Invitational if they
won't send him to the 1.C.4-A) prob
ably won't be content with the mile
and the 880. Burrows could still
;ive him a foot-race, figuring he
stayed out of the mile and kept
j'resh, but that's not at all likely.
If Montgomery could put one
out where it belongs he wouldn't
have any trouble beating Strode,
the U.C.L.A. Negro who is ad
mittedly the class of the loop now.
Whether the giant can ever get
back to the form that saw him hit
52 feet (> inches is problematical.
Gribbin might be the boy that will
surprise them all in the discus —
with him pitching Stanford has a
grand opportunity for first and sec
ond, even though any dopester's
conscience will warn him Zagar and
Gribbin are also liable to be third
and fourth.
On top of last year's holdovers,
the Cards include this husky-legged
Russ Wulff, who is about due to win
one of the big meets with something
around 6 feet 7 inches. Outside of
him Stanford can't look for any
more firsts. Thinking of winning
the meet is akin to star-gazing, but
it sure is a lot of fun.—Peterson.

of the P.C.C. teams in the coast j
meet at Los Angeles, and as far as j
Stanford is concerned that would be

However, the big-wigs decided to
open the field wide this season, and j
any team can enter as many men as |
it wants, with a certain restriction

event, of course. With that situa

Mind you, this isn't a beef. There

However, it's a cinch that the
edge U.S.C. and Cal already hold

If that bird Zamperini would stay
out of the two-mile Ed Burrows
could come home on top, but the
Trojan rebel (he's gonna compete in
the Princeton Invitational if they
won't send him to the 1.C.4-A) prob
ably won't be content with the mile
and the 880. Burrows could still
;ive him a foot-race, figuring he
stayed out of the mile and kept
j'resh, but that's not at all likely.
If Montgomery could put one
out where it belongs he wouldn't
have any trouble beating Strode,
the U.C.L.A. Negro who is ad
mittedly the class of the loop now.
Whether the giant can ever get
back to the form that saw him hit
52 feet (> inches is problematical.
Gribbin might be the boy that will
surprise them all in the discus —
with him pitching Stanford has a
grand opportunity for first and sec
ond, even though any dopester's
conscience will warn him Zagar and
Gribbin are also liable to be third
and fourth.
On top of last year's holdovers,
the Cards include this husky-legged
Russ Wulff, who is about due to win
one of the big meets with something
around 6 feet 7 inches. Outside of
him Stanford can't look for any
more firsts. Thinking of winning
the meet is akin to star-gazing, but
it sure is a lot of fun.—Peterson.
