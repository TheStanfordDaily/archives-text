## Thornhill Will Match First, Second Strings 
### 
The second Friday preview of
next fall's Big Red Machine will be
offered this afternoon on the Grey's
field, and present indications are j
that Tiny Thornhill will match his
two stellar first and second strings j
against each other again before the ■
sun sets.
Once last week these two out- i
fits got together in a short session |
that had all the aspects of a gen- j
uine mid-season struggle with the 1
blocking and tackling full of the
old "college try." The first 22 men
are so closely matched that it i.s,
getting difficult to pick the best j
team.
Back fields Good
Especially interesting to watch
should be the two best backfields—
or even the first three quartets —
where the competition is exceeding
ly close and well-fought.
If Bill Paulman is completely re- '
covered again, he will be in at the j
first-string fullback post and will j
alternate at the tailback spot with
fullback Norm Standlee. Either
Hamp Pool or Jimmy Groves may I
play right half, and little Pete Fay
will play left half and safety.
The second-string backs will
likely be Gene Coldiron at quar- [
ter, Freddie Ledeboer at full, Thor j
Peterson at left half, and Groves or
Pool at right half.
No Numbers
The men won't be wearing num- j
bers and naturally will be hard to
distinguish, but the different styles j
of play shouldn't be hard to recog
nize. The most consistent yard
j gainer down the middle will prob- 1
I ably be Standlee, the 207-pound
frosh sensation. Incidentally, Stand- 1
lee's all-around play has been es
pecially gratifying to the coaching
and publicity staffs. He is a vicious
blocker, an excellent passer, and an
exceedingly potent tackier.
Fay Punts
If a short, shifty little halfback
pulls in a punt on the dead run
and leaves a trail of r tacklers, that
will probably be Pete Fay. The
229-pound right half who takes a
reverse and steams into the tackle
hole might be Pool, or if he is
smaller, it may be Groves. The 65-
yard punts could belong to either
Fay or Paulman and the dead-eye
passes might come from one of
three or four with Ledeboer and
Paulman probably tossing best.

blocking and tackling full of the
old "college try." The first 22 men
are so closely matched that it i.s,
getting difficult to pick the best j
team.
Back fields Good
Especially interesting to watch
should be the two best backfields—
or even the first three quartets —
where the competition is exceeding
ly close and well-fought.
If Bill Paulman is completely re- '
covered again, he will be in at the j
first-string fullback post and will j
alternate at the tailback spot with
fullback Norm Standlee. Either
Hamp Pool or Jimmy Groves may I
play right half, and little Pete Fay
will play left half and safety.
The second-string backs will
likely be Gene Coldiron at quar- [
ter, Freddie Ledeboer at full, Thor j
Peterson at left half, and Groves or
Pool at right half.
No Numbers
The men won't be wearing num- j
bers and naturally will be hard to
distinguish, but the different styles j
of play shouldn't be hard to recog
nize. The most consistent yard
j gainer down the middle will prob- 1
I ably be Standlee, the 207-pound
frosh sensation. Incidentally, Stand- 1
lee's all-around play has been es
pecially gratifying to the coaching
and publicity staffs. He is a vicious
blocker, an excellent passer, and an
exceedingly potent tackier.
Fay Punts
If a short, shifty little halfback
pulls in a punt on the dead run
and leaves a trail of r tacklers, that
will probably be Pete Fay. The
229-pound right half who takes a
reverse and steams into the tackle
hole might be Pool, or if he is
smaller, it may be Groves. The 65-
yard punts could belong to either
Fay or Paulman and the dead-eye
passes might come from one of
three or four with Ledeboer and
Paulman probably tossing best.
The second Friday preview of
next fall's Big Red Machine will be
offered this afternoon on the Grey's
field, and present indications are j
that Tiny Thornhill will match his
two stellar first and second strings j
against each other again before the ■
sun sets.
Once last week these two out- i
fits got together in a short session |
that had all the aspects of a gen- j
uine mid-season struggle with the 1
blocking and tackling full of the
old "college try." The first 22 men
are so closely matched that it i.s,
getting difficult to pick the best j
