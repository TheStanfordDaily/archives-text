# Cards' Warneke On Ailing List
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 19 (UP).â€”The
St. Louis Cardinals, their pitching
staff already weakened by the sale
of Dizzy Dean, lost another ace to
day when Lon Warneke left for St.
Louis with an ailing leg.
Warneke was struck on the right
shin by a line drive off the bat of
Brooklyn's Babe Phelps on may 8,
in St. Louis. He finished the game
for his third victory of the season.
A week later while working against
Cincinnati, he retired after four
innings, complaining of his leg.
Yesterday Warneke hobbled
around at Ebbets Field. Manager
Frank Frisch ordered his leg ex
amined and the fibula bone was
found severely bruised three inches
above the ankle. He was sent home
for treatment by Dr. Robert Hyland,
club physician.
