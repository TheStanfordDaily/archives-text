See-Saw Match
Hass won yesterday's see-saw af- |
fair only after the lead had changed
hands several times. At the end of !
the 16th hole, the two were all- j
square, and Hass sewed up the :
match by taking the last two holes. I
Hass carded a two over par 73, j
while Needham went around in 76. I
Today Art Doering and Bill Boyd
will hook up in their long-awaited
"battle" in the main event of five
matches that will wind up this j
week's competition in the first round. j
Next week the boys will play sec
ond-round matches with the semi
finals Saturday and the finals Sun- i
day.
Doering Co-favored
Doering led the qualifiers with a j
medal score of 136, four under par !
and six strokes better than his near- j
est rival. He is co-favored with j
defending champion Jack Wallace to J
nab this year's title, but is better
known for medal play than match, j
Boyd was relegated to the spot of j
"black horse" and the "man to
beat." In recent tournaments he j
has had the habit of upsetting the j
favorites. He already holds deci- j
sions over Doering in the same tour- i
nament last year and in the Pa
cific Coast Intercollegiates this
year.
