# Water Soloists Show Promising Fall Team
## 
### 
If yesterday's varsity-alumni game is a good indication of what to
expect, Stanford should have another title-contending water polo team
on its hi*nds next fall.
The potential varsity, using several substitutes, walked over the "Old
Men's" outfit 10-6 (vithout extending themselves. Although the alumni

had a line-up including four former*
All-Coast stars, they lacked the |
stamina and team-work of the regu- 1
lars and faltered in the second half |
after trailing 5-4 at the intermis- '
sion.
Jack Loupe, a bright prospect two i
years ago who stayed out of school j
last season, led the varsity with '
four goals while Bob Plate and |
Johnny Lamb got two apiece. Ralph |
Kingsbury, who hasn't played for ,
several seasons, and Don Peterson, I
the Olympic Club's perpetual i
youngster, made two each for the ;
alumni. Last years' captain, Bill j
Hanna, and Bob Hoover made a ]
bucket each to conclude their scor
ing.
Brightest spot in the varsity line- j
up was at guard, where Coach Nort ,
Thornton was able to alternate four
guards, all of whom look good i
enough to break into the first string j
in the fall. Dick Hoover and Bob i
Allen played a bang-up first half,
but Bill Hatch and Ted Moreno came
back equally well in the last ses
sion.
Again with his goal-guards,
Thornton showed that he has great
prospects. Lloyd Wilson played the
first half while big Roy Vitousek
handled the second. Vitousek is
tall and rangy and covers more
territory in the net than any Stan
ford man since Bob Haslacher, the
All-Coast choice in 1936.
Due to the lack of any substi
tutes, the alumni were forced to
play the same team throughout the
swim.
The line-ups:
Lamb F Rider
Loupe F Kingsbury
Rothschild C Voss
Plate S Peterson
Allen G Hanna
Hoover G Hoover
Wilson G Dowling
Substitutions: For the varsity,
Hatch, Vitousek, Moreno, Weeden.
