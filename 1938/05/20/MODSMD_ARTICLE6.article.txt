# Diogenes Could Finish His Quest
## 
### 
Diogenes, in his search for an
honest man, didn't come to Stan
ford, ti> the bulletin board on the
English coiner. If he had, he
could have ended his search suc
cessfully. This notice was found
posted there:
"My '33 do luxe Ford sedan is
for sale . . . Its oil consumption
is a thing to wonder at; the back
seat can be used only if you
know how to post; the roof leaks;
the brakes moan; I don't think
much of Fords anyway.
"... The only good thing about
this death trap is the fact that it
is camouflaged to look like a
dirt road, which I have found
useful during air-raids.
"My opener is ,$142.39, but I
shrink from arguments. If by
any chance you have a bicycle, a
red top. and a fnirlv good box
kite, 1 might consider a swap."
