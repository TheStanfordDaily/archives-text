# The 						Missing Link
## 
### 
STANFORD, it seems, set up a pseudo-Civil
Service when it decided to trust its de
mocracy to a card-file system for student job
applicants. But, as members of Leadership Insti
tute pointed out Wednesday night, it left off
one essential part to make the system work—
a Civil Service Board, or in their terms, a per
sonnel manager.
Besides routine work — co-ordinating men's
and women's files, and keeping them up to date
- his real job would be to ride herd over com
mittee leaders, to see that appointments were
actually and only being m-ide from the files.
Probably he would submit a list of names from
the files before every committee appointment
was made, and would okay the final choice of
the committee leader.
At the thought of the plan, the campus will
probably smack its lips and say, "Urn, gravy.
And how." The answer to that one lies in the
old war-time axiom—that the boy on the top of
the hill gets sniped at. With jealous office
seekers dogging every step, it simply would
not be safe for the manager to play favorites.
Less idealistically, he would be checked by
Ex Committeee, who pays his salary. At the
first faint hint of an odor, a check-up, with the
threat of suspended pay, would be a strong
persuasion to fairness.
Personnel managers would have a full-time
job and a thankless one. But if Stanford is going
to translate its idealistic system into realistic
efficiency, the final and logical addition to the
card-file system is indispensible. Theoretically,
the office will fix responsibility. Practically, it
will increase participation. Without it, the card
files will gather dust, and The Daily will con
tinue to print the same old names in connection
with committees.
As the card-file system now stands, it is a
good job-spreading machine, all fired up to go.
All it needs is a personnel manager to run it.—
