# Is Europe? Tonight
## 
### 
EVER since Mac Gordon and Frank O'Neill
wrote "Three Sheets to the Wind" two years
ago, Spring Shows have been notorious for fail
ing to accomplish anything that Gaieties could
not do better. Flimsily constructed, they have
been saved because Stanford likes to see its
stars in action, whatever the occasion.
Perhaps the fault has been with the authors
who have monopolized the last two shows, or
it may be just an intrinsic flaw in student capa
bilities to write a good play. "Is Europe? with
a different set of authors, may be the test of the
two theories.
But whether the show tonight will have any
real value is a minor matter. What does count
is that the campus will get a few belly laughs,
hear some good music, see its favorites swing
out, enjoy the evening thoroughly. And that's
all the Show goes on for anyhow.â€”J. S.
