# The 						Finishing Touch

### 
YESTERDAY we chuckled gently at the way
the Married Men's Club was trying to grab
a subsidy brass ring off the A.S.S.U. merry-go
round. It struck us as a little incongruous that
a group dedicated to contentment and harmony
should feel an appropriation necessary to their
happiness.
But we were not exactly fair to the married
men. They have some good arguments behind
them, even though their tactics did remind us
of something out of a musical comedy.
Part of their case could be based on an
ancient objection to our student government
system. There is no real representation, and
when the graduate students want to put the
pressure on Ex Committee they can find no one
Jo go to bat for them.
Theoretically there is representation by
classes, the graduates having two members on
Ex Committee. But that dream comes true only
in the frosh handbook. We can't expect real
representation when the entire student body
votes on committee members.
In practice, the members represent the stu
dent body. Individual groupings are not con
sidered.
We do not at present intend to mix into the
current feud. The married men can fight it out
with Ex Committeo to the last bitter adjective.

But it seems to us that Stanford's treatment of
graduate students sometimes has a strong re
semblance to some of the acts that have made
Hitler so unpopular with certain elements.
The graduate student has many different
interests from the undergraduate. He has less
time, and is more conscious of the small for
tune he is paying for his education.
But the University treats him in exactly the
same way it treats the other students. And so
the graduates remain a suppressed minority.
The married men may not find any artillery
in the fact that they are married. And so far
their strategy has been like something out of a
joke book. But, perhaps, as graduates they
haven't been getting their share of the democ
racy we hear so much about. That is something
that doesn't strike us as funny.â€”J. C.
