# BULL SESSION
## HANDS ACROSS THE SEA 
### 
ANNOUNCED in yesterday's Daily were the names
of seven F;irm students who have been selected to
go to Japan this summer for tin.' annual student con
ference in Tokyo. Chosen for their interest in the Far
East, they will spend more than a month studying
Japan, its students, its psychology, its empire.
There will be certain things conversationally taboo,
of course: The war, for one, will probably have to be
treated with kid gloves and the utmost of politeness;
there will be little chance to discuss international yeace
on any specific basis; the word "Panay" will not be
a good one to use; and even the future of the Philip
pines will probably be a ticklish subject.
But in a broader sense the delegates' mission will
undoubtedly be a success. Layers of prejudice ac
quired during the 10 months of the war will at least
be partially sluffed off by direct contact with the
people; and international student friendship, so im
portant for the future, will be achieved and consoli
dated.
|N THIS latter regard, however, it seems to me that
the University itself could do more than it has done
in the past. Stanford has sent delegations to Japan
each year, the delegations have had a good time and
made some interesting contacts; and then nothing has
been done about it. They have returned to the campus,
and aside from a few scattered speeches before various
organizations, they have given the student body no
account of their travels.
More than anything else, they are representatives of
Stanford University—of us: and it would seem that
they ought to be allowed to give us a report on what
they have found. If friendship between American and
Japanese university students is to be anything but a
pleasant-sounding phrase—if it is to extend to more
than a little handful of delegates from each university
—then it seems obvious that the Farm as a whole
should be permitted to hear about it.
An all-University assembly might do the trick; or
if time cannot be found for that, a Tuesday Night Lec
ture, perhaps. In any case, there ought to be some op
portunity for them to tell us how young Japan feels
about the problems it has to meet, how its views agree
or disagree with ours, how it feels about us, what it is
thinking on topics of interest to youth everywhere.
Only then can we have, any conception of "inter
national student friendship"; only then can there be
any international bridge of minds between the two
groups who will soon be guiding the destinies of their
respective countries.
There is little point to preaching friendship and
understanding if we are never piven a chance to put
them into practice; and it is to be hoped that that fact
will be remembered when the delegates return to
school in the fall.—Allen Drury.

there will be little chance to discuss international yeace
on any specific basis; the word "Panay" will not be
a good one to use; and even the future of the Philip
pines will probably be a ticklish subject.
But in a broader sense the delegates' mission will
undoubtedly be a success. Layers of prejudice ac
quired during the 10 months of the war will at least
be partially sluffed off by direct contact with the
people; and international student friendship, so im
portant for the future, will be achieved and consoli
dated.
|N THIS latter regard, however, it seems to me that
the University itself could do more than it has done
in the past. Stanford has sent delegations to Japan
each year, the delegations have had a good time and
made some interesting contacts; and then nothing has
been done about it. They have returned to the campus,
and aside from a few scattered speeches before various
organizations, they have given the student body no
account of their travels.
More than anything else, they are representatives of
Stanford University—of us: and it would seem that
they ought to be allowed to give us a report on what
they have found. If friendship between American and
Japanese university students is to be anything but a
pleasant-sounding phrase—if it is to extend to more
than a little handful of delegates from each university
—then it seems obvious that the Farm as a whole
should be permitted to hear about it.
An all-University assembly might do the trick; or
if time cannot be found for that, a Tuesday Night Lec
ture, perhaps. In any case, there ought to be some op
portunity for them to tell us how young Japan feels
about the problems it has to meet, how its views agree
or disagree with ours, how it feels about us, what it is
thinking on topics of interest to youth everywhere.
Only then can we have, any conception of "inter
national student friendship"; only then can there be
any international bridge of minds between the two
groups who will soon be guiding the destinies of their
respective countries.
There is little point to preaching friendship and
understanding if we are never piven a chance to put
them into practice; and it is to be hoped that that fact
will be remembered when the delegates return to
school in the fall.—Allen Drury.
ANNOUNCED in yesterday's Daily were the names
of seven F;irm students who have been selected to
go to Japan this summer for tin.' annual student con
ference in Tokyo. Chosen for their interest in the Far
East, they will spend more than a month studying
Japan, its students, its psychology, its empire.
There will be certain things conversationally taboo,
of course: The war, for one, will probably have to be
treated with kid gloves and the utmost of politeness;
there will be little chance to discuss international yeace
on any specific basis; the word "Panay" will not be
