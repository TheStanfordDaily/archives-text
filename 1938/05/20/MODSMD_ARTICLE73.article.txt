announcement in the city papers that ;i nine
year old pianist is leaving for Italy to study with
Arthur Schnabel touches us off on the subject of
chil/1 prodigies. The topic is fairly close to home
since only a few miles from Stanford lives a prodigy
who made good. We refer, of course, to Yehudi Menu
hin. In our time, he is perhaps the only one of the
child geniuses who has not burned out before he
reached maturity.
And up the peninsula the other way. is Ruth Slen
cynski, whose early years have promised great things.
But it is the next few years that will really count. If
she does go on to become one of the world's "greats,"
she will be among the very few women who have ever
done so.
But this business of child prodigies is an interesting
one because there are so many of them in proportion
to the final product of real geniuses. Hardly a year
goes by but what a new one is discovered.
The explanation of their later failure to become
anything but fine musicians probably lies in the facts
of maturation. A few people simply develop earlier
than others. But sooner or later they level off, and
after reaching a peak only slightly above normal, cease
to develop further.
•it * *
A S FAR as final greatness, it is not always necessary
that they show this earlier development. Most of
the present top-notch pianists did, with Josef Hofmann
as a very notable example. But the great Padercwski
did not turn into a concert pianist of note until com
paratively lale in life, when he buckled down to work
from an able player to a real master.
Of course, being a child virtuoso is a great saving
of time. In the early years, technical skill is developed
so that when the actual mental and spiritual growth
begins, the artist does not have to waste years in bring
ing his mechanical ability to the level of his psycho
logical development.
As a child, the budding genius can put in the
enormous amount of practice and drudgery necessary
to build himself for the future. It is much harder to
bring oneself to take on this purely mechanical work
later in life.
But technical development is about all that can be
expected of a young prodigy. To be really great, the
artist must be a genius mentally as well as physically.
And the emotions and the intellect do not develop as
rapidly as the physique. In the early years, most in
terpretative powers are obtained in a parrot-like fash
ion; if present, they are the result of good teaching
rather than inner maturity.
Perhaps the young Italian who is leaving to work
under a master will some day return to join the ranks
of Hofmann, Iturbi. Rosenthal, and others of his time.
Perhaps he will go the way of most prodigies, into
obscure musical competence. Stone.

Perhaps the young Italian who is leaving to work
under a master will some day return to join the ranks
of Hofmann, Iturbi. Rosenthal, and others of his time.
Perhaps he will go the way of most prodigies, into
obscure musical competence. Stone.
announcement in the city papers that ;i nine
year old pianist is leaving for Italy to study with
Arthur Schnabel touches us off on the subject of
chil/1 prodigies. The topic is fairly close to home
since only a few miles from Stanford lives a prodigy
who made good. We refer, of course, to Yehudi Menu
hin. In our time, he is perhaps the only one of the
child geniuses who has not burned out before he
reached maturity.
And up the peninsula the other way. is Ruth Slen
cynski, whose early years have promised great things.
But it is the next few years that will really count. If
she does go on to become one of the world's "greats,"
she will be among the very few women who have ever
done so.
But this business of child prodigies is an interesting
one because there are so many of them in proportion
to the final product of real geniuses. Hardly a year
goes by but what a new one is discovered.
The explanation of their later failure to become
anything but fine musicians probably lies in the facts
of maturation. A few people simply develop earlier
than others. But sooner or later they level off, and
after reaching a peak only slightly above normal, cease
to develop further.

A S FAR as final greatness, it is not always necessary
that they show this earlier development. Most of
the present top-notch pianists did, with Josef Hofmann
as a very notable example. But the great Padercwski
did not turn into a concert pianist of note until com
paratively lale in life, when he buckled down to work
from an able player to a real master.
Of course, being a child virtuoso is a great saving
of time. In the early years, technical skill is developed
so that when the actual mental and spiritual growth
begins, the artist does not have to waste years in bring
ing his mechanical ability to the level of his psycho
logical development.
As a child, the budding genius can put in the
enormous amount of practice and drudgery necessary
to build himself for the future. It is much harder to
bring oneself to take on this purely mechanical work
later in life.
But technical development is about all that can be
expected of a young prodigy. To be really great, the
artist must be a genius mentally as well as physically.
And the emotions and the intellect do not develop as
rapidly as the physique. In the early years, most in
