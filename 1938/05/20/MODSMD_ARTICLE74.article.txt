# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO SENSE OF YUMA 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since this "Married Men's" ques
tion is being carried further by their
resolution of Wednesday night, I
would like to explain, as I see them,
the Ex Committee's actions so fur.
They would be self-explanatory to
anyone who had attended. I am not
saying whether or not I believe the
Married Men's Club should be given
a subsidy.
Our first contact with the group
was early in the quarter when one
of their members appeared, not very
well prepared, to ask for $75 for the
current quarter, basing their need
for such funds on the fact that the
wives had just given a party and
reciprocity being the need, funds
were desired to give the return af
fair, with enough incidentally in
cluded in the grant to get speakers
at yarious times for the group. The
money was granted.
Since this was so easy, last Tues
day evening they asked Ex Com
mittee for $75 per quarter for next
year with the exception of summer
quarter when $100 would be ap
preciated. No, they did not present
written evidence of the benefit de
rived from the one grant; they
couldn't send a representative for
"proper hearing" (they're married
you know and their evenings are not
their own); they talked to several
members of the committee before
hand and these only gleaned the
facts that they had a grand party
and that about 30 (not 180) attended
their lectures. Their request was
denied.
Suddenly discovering that A.S.
S.U. funds were not thrown around
haphazardly, they rose in their ire
and decided to present their case for
a change; thus a resolution, which
would have been a good idea from
the first.
In closing, I might say that the Ex
Committee's "ignorance of the real
purposes of the group" and failure
"to investigate the service rendered
thus far by the Married Men's Club"
is the club's fault. After all we
weren't invited to "the party," and
we do not break into happy married
homes.
