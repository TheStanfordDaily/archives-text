# SPRING SHOW SHINES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have seen every production in
Memorial Hall since the place was
built, and I have worked in all but
two of them. Brother, there have
been some awful atrocities commit
ted there in the name of the drama.
Last night 1 saw the first dress re
hearsal of "Is Europe?" and I came

I away enthused about a student
: show. It doesn't pretend to be great
j drama; it isn't even colossal or stu
: pendous. It is merely a cleverly
' written musical comedy of a much
better calibre than Martin Flavin's
"Blue Jeans." I heartily recom
mend it for anyone seeking a good
j night's entertainment: because the
music and lyrics alone are worth
| the price of admission; because it
| will be the last chance students will
have to see Jane Clary at her fun
niest; because the satirical jibes at
the European situation are as witty
i and humorous as American college
| wit can be; because Barbara Thrash
| er lends a ribald presence and is ex
cruciatingly funny in her "Dopey"
I imitations; because Ed Kerr and
| Marco Thorne are in it; because J.
P. Kahn lias hit his stride.
Sincerely,
â€”Giari.
