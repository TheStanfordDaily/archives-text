# Change In S.P.U. Rules Announced
## Speeches Shortened; CIO Question Will He Topic at Next Meet 
### 
With the idea of injecting more
j spontaneity into the forum meetings,
i Ihe standing committee of the Stan
lord Political Union lately made
i several important changes in the
rules of procedure, Gerald Marcus
! announced last night.
The time of the opening speeches
was shortened from ten minutes to
five and the intermediate speakers
j will have three minutes instead of
| five as before with the privilege of
| speaking either from the floor or
! from the platform.
Questions can be asked by anyone
during any of the intermediate
speeches whenever he feels that a
| point needs clarifying, and time
will be taken out from his speech
| both for the asking and the an
! swering.
"Resolved, That This House Sup
port the CIO" will be the question
for discussion at the next and last
meeting of the quarter, which is to
be held June 2.
Eggleston To Speak
l A prominent man who is con
nected with the present negotiations
between the CIO and the Committee
, of 43 is to be invited to the discus
sion to present one side of the ques
tion. Arthur Eggleston, writer of
the labor column for the San Fran
; cisco Chronicle, will also be invited
to attend the meeting.
Training School
"Encouraged by increased inter
j est in the work and the material
discussed by the Union, the lead
ers are looking forward in the fu
ture to a time when the S.P.U. will
j become a training school for those
who wish to become statesmen as
the present Oxford Union does,"
Marcus said last night.
Election
Before the forum discussion be
gins, a short business meeting will
j be held for the election of officers
for next year. The term of office in
the union is for a quarter and a
j half with two elections during the
j year. .
Form Similar to Oxford
Philip Buck, associate professor
> of political sciences, said that the
Union compared very favorably
with the Oxford Union, which he
has also seen in action. And that,
while the general form is the same
i and both use the parliamentary sys-
I tern, there is more general discus
| sion from the floor in the Oxford
i Union; but that there was no less
| enthusiasm and interest here than
| in England.
