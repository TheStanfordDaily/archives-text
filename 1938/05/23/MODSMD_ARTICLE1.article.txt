### BILL MILLIS 
4 ' r |MIIS TIME, will it be war?" is
the question raised by the pres
ent Europeaa crisis over Czecho
slovakia, just as it was the question
when Hitler moved into Austria
three months ago.
Only the rash can furnish a posi
tive or negative answer to that
question, but it is certain that in the
pre-War years, such crises as Aus
tria and Czechoslovakia would at
once have brought orders for mobil
ization, which mean war, with no
hesitation, back-tracking from prev
ious pledges, or issuance of diplo
matic counter-proposals.
For the moment, only, one tan
say that it is not yet "The Day."
With yesterday's armed-camp
municipal elections—marked by
significant gains for the Nazi
party of Konrad licnlcin in the
Sudeten German areas and for
the Communists and left wing
parties elsewhere—over, it can be
expected that tension will relapse
in Czechoslovakia.
* * *
The fate of Czechoslovakia has
been transferred from the peoples
immediately concerned to the capi
tals of Europe, and, in the final an
alysis, will be determined by the
decisions of other powers—Germany
and England, France and the Soviet
Union.
From London yesterday came
indications of what such decisions
may he, with the British cabinet,
in an extraordinary Sunday ses
sion, discussing a proposal of
Foreign Minister Lord Halifax
but attributed to Germany for dis
patching an "international army"
to police Czechoslovakia.
While the League of Nations di
rected such a force during the Saar
plebescite in 1935, it can be predicted
that the Czechs would object, since
they are not a League dependency,
and since they could regain little
sovereignty in the Sudeten regions
once German troops had entered as
part of an "international police
force."
* * *
IN PRAGUE, the executive com
mittee of the Sudeten German
Party, which won increases as high
as 30 per cent over the 1935 election
in some municipalities, announced
that it will refuse to negotiate a
new municipalities statute with the
government of Premier Milan Hozda
until he has ordered the withdrawal
of all troops "unconstitutionally
mobilized" in western Bohemia
along the German frontier.
The party revealed that licnlcin
had returned from Vienna con
ferences with high Nazi leaders,
and rumors were that he had
talked with Adolf Hitler at Berch
tesgaden.
Although the Wilhelmstrasse is
sued no official statement upon the
Czechoslovakian situation, the gov
ernment - controlled semi - official
news agency, D.N.8., asserted that
"invading" Czech soldiers had at
tempted to dynamite a border bridge
on the road from Munich to Prague.
* * *
The news from Washington was
that a new battle is developing in
Congress over the Administration's
.$3,247,025,000 recovery program, and
that Liberals threatened to delay
adjournment until the first "killing
frost" unless the Senate, which will
open consideration of the bill today,
rejects last-minute revisions in the
measure which assertedly would
jeopai'dize New Deal power and re
lief policies.
The controversy centers around
revisions by the Senate Appropri
ations Committee which would re
duce the public works fund by
$100,000,000 and forbid PWA aid
to public utility projects compet
ing with private power firms, and
to an amendment sponsored by
Sen. James F. Byrnes, conserva
tive South Carolina Democrat,
which would wipe out WPA wage
differentials between Northern
and Southern states (which would
embarrass an y Administration
drive for wages-hours legislation),
and would cut 875.000,000 from
appropriations for rural electrifi
cation loans.
* * *
According to reports telephoned
from San Luis Potosi to New York,
Mexican government troops have
occupied the Las Palomas ranch of
Gen. Saturnino Cedillo and sur
rounding "bandit'-held teriitory,
and have claimed to have virtually
smashed the "pocket rebellion."

4 ' r |MIIS TIME, will it be war?" is
the question raised by the pres
ent Europeaa crisis over Czecho
slovakia, just as it was the question
when Hitler moved into Austria
three months ago.
Only the rash can furnish a posi
tive or negative answer to that
question, but it is certain that in the
pre-War years, such crises as Aus
tria and Czechoslovakia would at
once have brought orders for mobil
ization, which mean war, with no
hesitation, back-tracking from prev
ious pledges, or issuance of diplo
matic counter-proposals.
For the moment, only, one tan
say that it is not yet "The Day."
With yesterday's armed-camp
municipal elections—marked by
significant gains for the Nazi
party of Konrad licnlcin in the
Sudeten German areas and for
the Communists and left wing
parties elsewhere—over, it can be
expected that tension will relapse
in Czechoslovakia.
* * *
The fate of Czechoslovakia has
been transferred from the peoples
immediately concerned to the capi
tals of Europe, and, in the final an
alysis, will be determined by the
decisions of other powers—Germany
and England, France and the Soviet
Union.
From London yesterday came
indications of what such decisions
may he, with the British cabinet,
in an extraordinary Sunday ses
sion, discussing a proposal of
Foreign Minister Lord Halifax
but attributed to Germany for dis
patching an "international army"
to police Czechoslovakia.
While the League of Nations di
rected such a force during the Saar
plebescite in 1935, it can be predicted
that the Czechs would object, since
they are not a League dependency,
and since they could regain little
sovereignty in the Sudeten regions
once German troops had entered as
part of an "international police
force."
* * *
IN PRAGUE, the executive com
mittee of the Sudeten German
Party, which won increases as high
as 30 per cent over the 1935 election
in some municipalities, announced
that it will refuse to negotiate a
new municipalities statute with the
government of Premier Milan Hozda
until he has ordered the withdrawal
of all troops "unconstitutionally
mobilized" in western Bohemia
along the German frontier.
The party revealed that licnlcin
had returned from Vienna con
ferences with high Nazi leaders,
and rumors were that he had
talked with Adolf Hitler at Berch
tesgaden.

slovakia, just as it was the question
when Hitler moved into Austria
three months ago.
Only the rash can furnish a posi
tive or negative answer to that
question, but it is certain that in the
pre-War years, such crises as Aus
tria and Czechoslovakia would at
once have brought orders for mobil
ization, which mean war, with no
hesitation, back-tracking from prev
ious pledges, or issuance of diplo
matic counter-proposals.
For the moment, only, one tan
say that it is not yet "The Day."
With yesterday's armed-camp
municipal elections—marked by
significant gains for the Nazi
party of Konrad licnlcin in the
Sudeten German areas and for
the Communists and left wing
parties elsewhere—over, it can be
expected that tension will relapse
in Czechoslovakia.
* * *
The fate of Czechoslovakia has
been transferred from the peoples
immediately concerned to the capi
tals of Europe, and, in the final an
alysis, will be determined by the
decisions of other powers—Germany
and England, France and the Soviet
Union.
From London yesterday came
indications of what such decisions
may he, with the British cabinet,
in an extraordinary Sunday ses
sion, discussing a proposal of
Foreign Minister Lord Halifax
but attributed to Germany for dis
patching an "international army"
to police Czechoslovakia.
While the League of Nations di
rected such a force during the Saar
plebescite in 1935, it can be predicted
that the Czechs would object, since
they are not a League dependency,
and since they could regain little
sovereignty in the Sudeten regions
once German troops had entered as
part of an "international police
force."

IN PRAGUE, the executive com
mittee of the Sudeten German
Party, which won increases as high
as 30 per cent over the 1935 election
in some municipalities, announced
that it will refuse to negotiate a
new municipalities statute with the
government of Premier Milan Hozda
until he has ordered the withdrawal
of all troops "unconstitutionally
mobilized" in western Bohemia
along the German frontier.
The party revealed that licnlcin
had returned from Vienna con
ferences with high Nazi leaders,
and rumors were that he had
talked with Adolf Hitler at Berch
tesgaden.
Although the Wilhelmstrasse is
sued no official statement upon the
Czechoslovakian situation, the gov
ernment - controlled semi - official
news agency, D.N.8., asserted that
"invading" Czech soldiers had at
tempted to dynamite a border bridge
on the road from Munich to Prague.

The news from Washington was
that a new battle is developing in
Congress over the Administration's
.$3,247,025,000 recovery program, and
that Liberals threatened to delay
adjournment until the first "killing
frost" unless the Senate, which will
open consideration of the bill today,
rejects last-minute revisions in the
measure which assertedly would
jeopai'dize New Deal power and re

The controversy centers around
revisions by the Senate Appropri
ations Committee which would re
duce the public works fund by
$100,000,000 and forbid PWA aid
to public utility projects compet
ing with private power firms, and
to an amendment sponsored by
Sen. James F. Byrnes, conserva

which would wipe out WPA wage
differentials between Northern
and Southern states (which would
embarrass an y Administration
