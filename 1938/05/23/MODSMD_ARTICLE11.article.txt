# Stagers Set New High With Show
## Student Production, 'Is Europe?', Scores In Both Music, Drama 
### JIM STONE 
Stagers swung out high and wide
over the week-end with "Is Eu- j
rope?", gagged and jammed their
way to a new high in student pro
ductions. Furnished with a script
by co-authors Hal Kahn and Ed
Kerr which rolled along without
the usual hop-skip-and-jump of
college musicals, the large cast
romped its way through two acts of
slap-stick and satire without an ap
parent hitch, relaxed its pace only
when blocked by callow love-scenes.
Neatly dodging the old technic
in Spring Shows of salting the script
with any gags at hand, Kahn and
Kerr achieved satire which was too
good-humored to be taken seriously,
made the most out of their screwy
situations. F>r a change, curtain
scenes were actually curtain scenes,
with the fim.le a slam-bang affair
that left the audience yelling for
more. The plot wasn't much, but
credit is due, Spring Shows having
been what they were, for there be
ing one at all. They got out of the
rut.
Dance Scene Notable
As a second departure from the
ordinary, especially notable was the
dance number in the second scene.
Notorious for what has probably
been the worst chorus work on a
college stage, Stanford may finally
point to a dance routine which
clicked.
Between the laughs, we were ta
ken with a bit of nostalgia as we
saw Shirley Jones make her last
entrance and exit on a Stanford
stage, battle for the last time with a
belligerent public address system.
She was the guiding force of the
show, pulling it over the rough
spots, leading it to a rapid, smooth
performance. As for her singing,
enough has already been said in
past years to establish her as top
ranking Stanford vocalist, and she
was at her very best in "Is Europe?".
Music Excellent
One cannot go on without speak
ing of Art McCue's bullet swing
outfit, nor arranger Myron Birn
baum. After they opened with an
overture which practically blasted
the audience out of its seats, we
fully expected to have Big-Appling
in the aisles before the show was
over, under the influence of their
foot-tickling rhythm.
Of course they had some top
notch music to work with. The boys
ai'ound the campus will be whistling
"Pleased to Meet You," "Balkanian
Break," and the "Alma Matex*" with
its swing background for a good
while yet. It's a crying shame that
the tunes won't go any farther.
Mirth-Provokers
Laugh head-liners of the evening
i were the crew of dictators. Ray
Klostcr's make-up job on them was
a little short of terrific, and accents
were intelligible if not exactly auth
entic. For Lome Samuel's back
breaking walk, an especial x'ound of
applause.
Jane Cleax-y had the vapid, Alice
Brade-note to the last vague in
tonation. did better in her pai't than
Ed Kerr, who, after seeing Hugh
Hei-bert just once too often, almost
gave the audience ants in their pants
