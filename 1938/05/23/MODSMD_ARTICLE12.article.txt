# Commissary Even Sells 'Gooflou'

### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
(Editor's note: This is the first
; of two articles on the Stanford
| Wholesale Commissary.)

"Send me box gooflou!" screamed
j the cook for the third time over the
j telephone.
Nobody but a warehouseman from
| the Stanford Co-op would have
j known that when a Chinese cook
| orders "goose flour" he really wants
the makings for Swansdown cake.
And understanding Pidgin English
is but one of the skills of an em
ploye of the Stanford Wholesale
Commissary.
The Co-op, under the careful su
pervision of Director Elliot H. Hyers,
is operating in its eleventh year to
bring top quality food to Stanford
living groups at prices actually
lower, in many cases, than whole
j sale rates. The Stanford Commis
sary is an organization owned and
operated by fraternities, sororities,
and eating clubs through which
these groups co-operate in buy<ng
their food wholesale and share the
profits that would otherwise go to
retailers.
In the corner of the Branner base
ment, where the supplies aie stored
and handled, Mr. Ayers. former as
sistant purchasing agent for the Uni
versity, sits and measures the air
' space in eggs or the amount of acetic
' acid in a can of sauerkraut.
By careful inspection of available

foods and by speculative buying, Mr.
Ayers has probably done more than
any other one man to cut down
board bills on the Stanford campus.
A recent comparison o r prices of
meats of equal quality and cuts at
the Co-op and at retail meat mar
kets showed that the 32 members of
the Commissary save $10,000 a year
on meat alone.
Members include 23 fraternities,
5 sororities, and 2 eating clubs. They
are represented on the board of di
rectors by their managers. Deane
Johnson, recently elected president,
succeeds Cy Oberg as head of the
Commissary.
Besides meats and canned goods,
the Co-op keeps the campus sup
plied with many other articles at low
cost. On the storage shelves can be
seen Igiht bulbs, brooms, soap, candy,
coca-cola, ginger ale, garbage cans,
and furniture polish.
Demand for dog food has de
creased considerably since the dis
missal of canine inhabitants of the
campus, according to Mr. Ayers,
but the physiology department still
requires enough to keep its guinea
pigs and other animals alive.
Ayer meets problems daily of the
buyer, seller, speculator, and psy
chologist. He is able to make great
savings by making his purchases
when prices are low. When drought
appeared in the Mid-West last year,
he boMfht great quantifies of canned

corn, and sold them to living groups
at $1.80 a case while retail grocers
were paying $2.70 a case to whole
salers.
Cooks do not always get what they
order—Ayer sometimes knows bet
ter. Some cooks consistently over
estimate their needs, and Ayers con
sistently sends them less than they
order with never a complaint.
When somebody orders soap that
Ayers has proved through scientific
research will not lather in campus
water, buyers are pleased to find he
sends them some that will. Or when
a cook orders a dozen large cans of
strawberry jam, Ayers realizes the
students will get tired of the same
thing too often, so he sends them a
half dozen and waits to see if the
cook orders more —he seldom does.
So Ayers is free to go on saving
money for the students. "I am
working for you and no others. It
is my business to give you good food
at low prices. We will sell you the
best quality food that can be bought,
and we can beat price and service
anywhere else by a large margin."
Though living groups have bought
nt prices far below those they would
have had to pay otherwise, the Co
op must maintain a surplus to keep
on the safe side, according to Mr.
Ayers, and this surplus is returned
at the end of the year. Living
groups this year will be returned
about SIOO each

And understanding Pidgin English
is but one of the skills of an em

Commissary.
The Co-op, under the careful su
pervision of Director Elliot H. Hyers,
is operating in its eleventh year to
bring top quality food to Stanford
living groups at prices actually
lower, in many cases, than whole
j sale rates. The Stanford Commis
sary is an organization owned and
operated by fraternities, sororities,
and eating clubs through which
these groups co-operate in buy<ng
their food wholesale and share the
profits that would otherwise go to
retailers.
In the corner of the Branner base
ment, where the supplies aie stored
and handled, Mr. Ayers. former as
sistant purchasing agent for the Uni
versity, sits and measures the air
' space in eggs or the amount of acetic
' acid in a can of sauerkraut.
By careful inspection of available

foods and by speculative buying, Mr.
Ayers has probably done more than
any other one man to cut down
board bills on the Stanford campus.
A recent comparison o r prices of
meats of equal quality and cuts at
the Co-op and at retail meat mar
kets showed that the 32 members of
the Commissary save $10,000 a year
on meat alone.
Members include 23 fraternities,
5 sororities, and 2 eating clubs. They
are represented on the board of di
rectors by their managers. Deane
Johnson, recently elected president,
succeeds Cy Oberg as head of the
Commissary.
Besides meats and canned goods,
the Co-op keeps the campus sup
plied with many other articles at low
cost. On the storage shelves can be
seen Igiht bulbs, brooms, soap, candy,
coca-cola, ginger ale, garbage cans,
and furniture polish.
Demand for dog food has de
creased considerably since the dis
missal of canine inhabitants of the
campus, according to Mr. Ayers,
but the physiology department still
requires enough to keep its guinea
pigs and other animals alive.
Ayer meets problems daily of the
buyer, seller, speculator, and psy
chologist. He is able to make great
savings by making his purchases
when prices are low. When drought
appeared in the Mid-West last year,
he boMfht great quantifies of canned

corn, and sold them to living groups
at $1.80 a case while retail grocers
were paying $2.70 a case to whole
salers.
Cooks do not always get what they
order—Ayer sometimes knows bet
ter. Some cooks consistently over
estimate their needs, and Ayers con
sistently sends them less than they
order with never a complaint.
When somebody orders soap that
Ayers has proved through scientific
research will not lather in campus
water, buyers are pleased to find he
sends them some that will. Or when
a cook orders a dozen large cans of
