# Frosh Take Historians In 13-12 Win
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
Youth vex-sus age; agility against,
shall we say, fragility?
Sluggers from the Western Civ.
Department had a bit of red inking i
to do in their ledgers Friday night, 1
after being outscored by one run in j
their Softball game, against an En- j
cina gang, that had all the aspects !
of a feud from the "old mountings." j
Trailing 13 to 10 in the last half j
of the ninth inning, the tutors gasped j
out a rally that fell only one tally
short of tying the score. The loss
was their first, the profs having
previously humbled teams from Cas
tilleja, the oCnvalescent Home, and
a Peninsula all-star kindergarten
squad.
Rohleitcs Cheer
A bleacher load of Robleites came ;
to cheer both teams, choi'tled upon j
seeing their profs in jeans and swim
ming trunks. Pi'ofs choi'tled upon
seeing the lassies, almost beat the
laddies as a consequence.
The pedagogues started out with
a whirl, as for two and a half innings j
Encina batters, standing with eyes j
on the ball and minds on finals, |
failed to touch the fire-ball offer
ings of chucker "Spike" Knoles.
Fx-osh pi'exy Gore was the first to
find a pitch within reach, and he j
banged the old red apple out past |
where "Hooks" Buchanan was sit- |
ting on the grass for a bonafide j
homer.
Only other frosh to have his bawl- ;
out average lowered eight points |
was Bill Schroeder, who biffed an
other Encina four-bagger. Jim ,
Farquharson came close, but he was j
tackled on third by "The Dimag" :
Adams and tagged out.
Savclle Slams
Max "Mickey Cochrane" Savelle. j
captain of the mentors, swung at the |
first ball pitched him in the seventh, j
and on the second time around he
connected to lam the ball against
the fence. Frosh hurler Ray Stahl
allowed one more four-base hit
when he accidentally hit "Spike" |
Knoles' bat in the eighth.
Sparked by "Lefty" Fisher, the
teachers' infield played dynamite
ball throughout, with "Slats" Spald
ing's short stop position especially j
| "no man's land." Only Encina!
comment was when one batsman
muttered, "Watching the infield I
makes me ready to believe we're
studying Western 'Sieve'.''
Encina Referees
With Edgar Eugene Robinson in
cognito somewhere, Encina led off j
by furnishing the referees. First i
one was moved to first base by popu- !
lar request after he called his prof
out on two pitched balls. Second
managed to finish the game by ju
dicious employment of "Aristotlian
Logic."
At the end of the game Encina
grouped to couple a big six for the
profs with "No more finals!" The
losers hobbled off to waiting cars
with visions of arnica and hot baths
before them. Captain Savelle re
portedly said. "We'll see you again
in June, boys," as he led his squad
off the field.

grouped to couple a big six for the
profs with "No more finals!" The
losers hobbled off to waiting cars
with visions of arnica and hot baths
before them. Captain Savelle re

off the field.

Department had a bit of red inking i
to do in their ledgers Friday night, 1
after being outscored by one run in j
their Softball game, against an En- j
cina gang, that had all the aspects !
of a feud from the "old mountings." j
Trailing 13 to 10 in the last half j
of the ninth inning, the tutors gasped j
out a rally that fell only one tally
short of tying the score. The loss
was their first, the profs having
previously humbled teams from Cas
tilleja, the oCnvalescent Home, and
a Peninsula all-star kindergarten
squad.
Rohleitcs Cheer
A bleacher load of Robleites came ;
to cheer both teams, choi'tled upon j
seeing their profs in jeans and swim
ming trunks. Pi'ofs choi'tled upon
seeing the lassies, almost beat the
laddies as a consequence.
The pedagogues started out with
a whirl, as for two and a half innings j
Encina batters, standing with eyes j
on the ball and minds on finals, |
failed to touch the fire-ball offer
ings of chucker "Spike" Knoles.
Fx-osh pi'exy Gore was the first to
find a pitch within reach, and he j
banged the old red apple out past |
where "Hooks" Buchanan was sit- |
ting on the grass for a bonafide j
homer.
Only other frosh to have his bawl- ;
out average lowered eight points |
was Bill Schroeder, who biffed an
other Encina four-bagger. Jim ,
Farquharson came close, but he was j
tackled on third by "The Dimag" :
Adams and tagged out.
Savclle Slams
Max "Mickey Cochrane" Savelle. j
captain of the mentors, swung at the |
first ball pitched him in the seventh, j
and on the second time around he
connected to lam the ball against
the fence. Frosh hurler Ray Stahl
allowed one more four-base hit
when he accidentally hit "Spike" |
Knoles' bat in the eighth.
Sparked by "Lefty" Fisher, the
teachers' infield played dynamite
ball throughout, with "Slats" Spald
ing's short stop position especially j
| "no man's land." Only Encina!
comment was when one batsman
muttered, "Watching the infield I
makes me ready to believe we're
studying Western 'Sieve'.''
Encina Referees
With Edgar Eugene Robinson in
cognito somewhere, Encina led off j
by furnishing the referees. First i
one was moved to first base by popu- !
lar request after he called his prof
out on two pitched balls. Second
managed to finish the game by ju
dicious employment of "Aristotlian
Logic."
