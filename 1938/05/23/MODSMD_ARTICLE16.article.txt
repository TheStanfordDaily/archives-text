# British Discuss 'World Army'
## Czech Nation Closed Completely by Troops 
### 
LONDON, May 22 (UP). — The
British cabinet met in emergency
i session late today and discussed a
1 proposal, attributed to Germany's
j initiative, for dispatch of an "inler
j national army" to Czechoslovakia,
! whose borders are flanked by the
| troops of four nations on warlike
I footing.
The suggestion that Czechoslo
vakia be policed by soldiers of sev
eral countries was considered after
Viscount Halifax, following day
long communication with Europe's
worried chancellories, conveyed to
the cabinet ministers a grave Ger
! man warning of the explosive pos
j sibilities in Czechoslovakia.
Troops on Move
London heard that while Czecho
slovakia and Germany moved thou
sands of troops up to the Bohemian
frontier for "extraordinary maneu
; vers" Poland's troops were close to
the Slovakia border and Hungary
j was taking "certain military meas
| ures" on the south.
Czechoslovakia was virtually a
; sealed nation tonight with few fron
| tier points open.
The British cabinet decided that
I the situation is "still critical and
| confused" but shows some improve-
I ment.
Britain, it was decided, must re
j frain from taking sides in the Czech-
I Nazi dispute if its role of peace
| maker is to succeed and new ap
; proaches will be made to Berlin and
Prague.
Moderation Urged
The Czechs will be urged to make
every effort to avoid incidents
while Germany will be asked to in
duce a more moderate tone toward
Czechoslovakia in the Nazi press and
to be more patient.
Lord Halifax, foreign secretary,
i informed the cabinet in its hour-
J long session of an assurance from
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler that Germany
j will create no "incident" over minor
j troubles in Czechoslovakia — sup
posedly meaning clashes between
| Czechs and members of the German
! minority.
The assurance was coupled with a
| warning that any large-scale blood
! shed in the Sudeten German areas of
j the country will be "a different
' matter."
