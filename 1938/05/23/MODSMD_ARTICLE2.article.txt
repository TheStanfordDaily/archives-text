Elections Uneventful

It seems that at a secret meeting

Chappie editor. Hartmann knew
nothing about it.
Then at the regular meeting, ev
ery conceivable candidate, except
Hartmann, was nominated, while

Finally, as a last resort, someone
mentioned him as a likely prospect
for the editorship. "This is decid

"Hartmann can't be nominated now;
he was elected last Monday." Hart
mann almost dropped in his seat, but
when told about the hoax, regained
his good humor and took the whole
group out for refreshments.

Elections Uneventful
"This year's elections went
through smoothly," added Thorne.
"Last year was a lulu." He went on
to describe last election in detail.
It seems that at a secret meeting
held a week before last year's bal
lots were officially cast, Bob Hart
mann was unanimously chosen as
Chappie editor. Hartmann knew
nothing about it.
Then at the regular meeting, ev
ery conceivable candidate, except
Hartmann, was nominated, while
last year's "old boy" grew sadder
and sadder.
Finally, as a last resort, someone
mentioned him as a likely prospect
for the editorship. "This is decid
edly irregular," said the secretary.
"Hartmann can't be nominated now;
he was elected last Monday." Hart
mann almost dropped in his seat, but
when told about the hoax, regained
his good humor and took the whole
group out for refreshments.
