# Farm Summer Session Comes of Age
## Plans Follow 21-Year Old Tradition 
### 
Stanford's summer session comes
of age this year. When registration
opens on June 24, the summer quar
ter system will reach its twenty
first birthday.
No radical changes will mark this
attainment of majority, according
to Dr. John Armstrong Sellards, di
rector. The spirit of the summer
session may be old enough to buy a
drink, but it will celebrate the an
niversary quietly, following the pro
gram outlined in previous years.
Begun in lf)18
Summer quarter was begun in
1918. Its purpose, according to Dr.
Sellards, is to provide educational
facilities for men who are unable to
attend school on the traditional
three-quarter basis. The academic
work given, and the standards re
quired are exactly the same as in
any other quarter.
But despite the fact that main
tenance of the same quality of in
struction is one of the guiding prin
ciples of summer quarter adminis
tration, some difference in emphasis
is necessary. The reduced teaching
staff, and the more channeled inter
ests of most of the students attend
ing make it necessary to cut down
in some departments and expand in
others.
Grad Work Stressed
Main stress in the session is laid
on graduate work. Courses are de
signed primarily for students who
nave had at least one year at college,
and the more advanced studies are
emphasized.
According to Dr. Sellards, particu
lar attention will be paid this year
o the arts. Courses in fine arts of
all sorts are planned. Music and
he theater will be the center of em
phasis.
Drama Field Day
The Division of Speech and Drama
traditionally has a field day during
summer quarter. Much of the Uni
versity life centers around its pro
ductions, and a large proportion of
the students are majoring in drama.
This attention to dramatic activities
will be continued in the coming sum
mer. A series of play readings and
productions are planned, including
"Camille in Roaring Camp," and
"Uncle Tom's Cabin." Plans are be
ing made for a presentation of "Mid
summer Night's Dream," to con
clude the summer festival.
