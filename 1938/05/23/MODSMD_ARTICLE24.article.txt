# Grad Work Emphasized
## 
### 
Attendance at the summer session
consists of a much larger proportion
of graduates than attendance during
other quarters. Work is designed to
attract students who have left school
and have entered business or a pro
fession.
It is more convenient for such men
to do their work on advanced de
grees during the summer, and the
session is organized to help them.
This accounts for the emphasis on
education and drama, and for the
increased amount of graduate work
offered.
But equal attention is paid to the
undergraduate's necessities. Stan
ford is one of the few schools in the
country which offers a full four
quarter system of instruction.
Many of the men attending in the
summer are regular members of the
student body, who have found it
convenient to skip a quarter during
the regular year. The attention paid
to undergraduates, according to Dr.
Sellards, makes it possible for stu
dents to drop out of school and work
for a time, without losing their class
standing.
It also gives freshmen a chance to
get a head start on their class. Ac
cording to the registration arrange
ments, 50 lower division men in ad
dition to the regular quota will be
admitted in the fall on the basis of
summer school work. This means
that if a freshman applies too late,
he can enter summer school, and
try for admission through the side
door.
