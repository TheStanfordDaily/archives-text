# R.O.T.C. Review Is Finale for Year
## 
### 
Next Thursday's R.O.T.C. class
will show how much it has absorbed
in the way of a military education
when it goes into action before Ma
jor Malcolm R. Cox, inspecting of
ficer of the Ninth Corps Area, in
its last practice of the year. "
At the end of each year, compara
tive ratings of the various R.O.T.C.
units in this area are made by offi
cers of the War Department, and this
year Major Cox will base his esti
mate of the Stanford division on the
showing made by this group.
The Thursday class will not at
tempt to put on an exhibition, but
will merely run through its usual
drill, consisting of an hour-long
field artillery practice, during which
time four mounted gun sections will
execute a variety of movements, and
actual fire will be simulated, as in
the Field Day Review.
Gunners' medals will be presented
by Major Cox to the students in
this section who received a rating of
85 or better out of a possible 100 in
the gunners' examination held at
the beginning of this quarter.
