Summer quarter is the season for
J conventions and conferences. The
| University encourages various or-
I ganizations to use Stanford as a
! meeting place for discussions and
! studies.
The two outstanding conventions
j during the coming session will be
i Conference on Social Education,
! July 6 to 10. and the Business Con
ference, July 18 to 22. Similar con
ventions were held last year.
According to Dr. Sellards, it is
I impossible to make any estimate
! either of attendance at conferences
I jor of enrollment for the whole
session. It is expected, however,
that registration for the quarter will
top last year's mark of 900.
Summer quarter attendance has
varied widely in the past. Begin
ning just after the war it suffered
j from the confusion and uncertainty
jof the times. Only 136 students en
| rolled. After that, registration
I climbed steadily to a peak of 1405
[ in 1929. The depression years pulled
j it down again to a low of 600 in 1932.
Since then it has mounted slowly.
