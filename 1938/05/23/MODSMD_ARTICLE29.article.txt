# Law Society Social Group, Adds to Libe
## 
### MARSHALL WEIGEL 
Delta Theta Phi is an honorary
legal fraternity, founded about 18
years ago. The members meet once
a week for lunch and help those go
ing through law school with what
ever problems they may have.
There are about 20 active members
in the society at present, and all new
members are selected by the same
method as employed by the frater
nity houses.
Aside from social functions, the
main duty of the society has been to
enlarge the law library, especially
with books on the subject of ad
miralty law.
The officers at present are:
Dean, Donald P. Cady; vice-dean,
Ralph Raddue; master of ritual, Le
roy Wright; clerk of rolls, Reid Whit
ing; clerk of the exchequer, Mifflin
Ward; bailiff, Frank Richardson;
tribune, Robert Blewett.
These officers will be replaced by
a new group this spring when the
annual election is held.
