r JpHE removal of Louis Zamperini
from the Southern California
track team makes what is known as
a beatiful story in sports writing.
For several days to come there will
be lots to talk about for the sports
boys on the papers—the story has
everything, and the most will be
made of it.
However, the loss of Zamperini
won't get much airing around Stan
ford and California, and if there is J
any place that the incident is im
portant it's the two bay region uni
versities.
All the Bears and Indians can do
is sit back and shut up, and hope
secretly that this isn't all a hoax
and that Zamperini really is with- |
out a team for the conference meet,
Saturday.
Whether it is good sportsman
ship or not, it is a certainty that
Stanford and Cal trackmen and
coaches aren't going to shed any
tears over the absence of the Tro
jan flyer. They'll look at it this
way—Dean Cromwell of U.S.C.
wouldn't take down his hair if
Slunf/ml lost Malott or if Cal lost
Miller, so there is no reason why
the bay teams should get altruistic
about the team that has trounced
them both already.
Dink Templeton can't say any
thing, but with Zamperini out Stan
ford's chances are 100 per cent bet
ter. Ed Burrows showed he can
run away from anything at Cali
fornia in both distance races on the
same afternoon, and if he can get
by without much trouble from the
distance men up north there is a def
inite chance for Stanford to win both
mile and two-mile in the P.C.C.
meet.
Should such a thing come to
pass, the selection of Stanford as
the conference winner would be
come a little less goofy. Also
strengthening the Card's chances
is the report, if true, that Nutting
again has a bad leg and Charlie
Miller's knee hurts him when he
runs.
However, it may be recalled that
Cal suckered Stanford beautifully
on that Nutting deal at Big Meet—
Arnold was supposed to have such
a bad leg he couldn't run more than
75 yards, and the pickers who fav
ored Stanford went hook, line, and
sinker for the play. Nutting was in
the finest shape he had ever
achieved when he stepped to the
Start of the 100 in the Big Meet.
The persons that don't have to be
hit by a brick wall to learn things
aren't going to feel so sure about
Cal's injuries this time.

GET back to Zamperini for a
moment —whether there is justi
fication for his refusal to run in the
Compton meet because he didn't
get the expense money he wanted
or not, there is a distinctly disagree
able odor arising from the whole
mess.
As one writer put it yesterday,
Zamperini was only following the
,xample set by other athletes in
demanding what he thought was his
due. The trouble was that the fel
low Zamperini made his demands
upon had a different idea of what
Zamp's due was, and he went to the
extent of bringing the affair into the
open.
However, there is another way
to look at it, too. Zamperini has
a long way to go before he ever
becomes the champion in his
sport that Hank Luisetti was in
basketball, and Luisetti never
mucked up his amateur reputation
with extra-legal phenagling. Zam
perini might have had the right
to demand as much expense money
as other amateurs have, but he
thereby took himself out of the
class of such as Luisetti. who
played the game all the way, all
the time.

The Junior P.AA. meet at San
Jose Saturday, which Stanford won
with 68 points, brought some cheer
to the Indian forces in the form of
improved performances that might
develop into some points by con
ference meet time.
Tom Montgomery seems to have
licked that slump, and while the 50
feet 4 inches he did at San Jose
won't win the conference shot, it's
good at least for second. If he gets
off that good put he's been seeking
all season in the Berkeley affair
Saturday he might even win.
Rusty March finally got off a
good one to win the 880 in 1:56.6,
and just at the right time. Carl
Mahurin pulled a muscle last
week and figures he's all through
as a runner. Rusty is needed to
take his place.
Incidentally, the announcement
that Mahurin is going to Cal next
year is the cold dope, according to
Carl. He's going to get a couple of
courses he can't get at Stanford, but
he won't be on the track team.

GET back to Zamperini for a
moment —whether there is justi
fication for his refusal to run in the
Compton meet because he didn't
get the expense money he wanted
or not, there is a distinctly disagree
able odor arising from the whole
mess.
As one writer put it yesterday,
Zamperini was only following the
,xample set by other athletes in
demanding what he thought was his
due. The trouble was that the fel
low Zamperini made his demands
upon had a different idea of what
Zamp's due was, and he went to the
extent of bringing the affair into the
open.
However, there is another way
to look at it, too. Zamperini has
a long way to go before he ever
becomes the champion in his
sport that Hank Luisetti was in
basketball, and Luisetti never
mucked up his amateur reputation
with extra-legal phenagling. Zam
perini might have had the right
to demand as much expense money
as other amateurs have, but he
thereby took himself out of the
class of such as Luisetti. who
played the game all the way, all
the time.

The Junior P.AA. meet at San
Jose Saturday, which Stanford won
with 68 points, brought some cheer
to the Indian forces in the form of
improved performances that might
develop into some points by con
ference meet time.
Tom Montgomery seems to have
licked that slump, and while the 50
feet 4 inches he did at San Jose
won't win the conference shot, it's
good at least for second. If he gets
off that good put he's been seeking
all season in the Berkeley affair
Saturday he might even win.
Rusty March finally got off a
good one to win the 880 in 1:56.6,
and just at the right time. Carl
Mahurin pulled a muscle last
week and figures he's all through
as a runner. Rusty is needed to
take his place.
Incidentally, the announcement
that Mahurin is going to Cal next
year is the cold dope, according to
Carl. He's going to get a couple of
courses he can't get at Stanford, but
he won't be on the track team.
—Peterson.
Is
r JpHE removal of Louis Zamperini
from the Southern California
track team makes what is known as
a beatiful story in sports writing.
For several days to come there will
be lots to talk about for the sports
boys on the papers—the story has
everything, and the most will be
made of it.
However, the loss of Zamperini
won't get much airing around Stan
ford and California, and if there is J
any place that the incident is im
portant it's the two bay region uni
versities.
All the Bears and Indians can do
is sit back and shut up, and hope
secretly that this isn't all a hoax
and that Zamperini really is with- |
out a team for the conference meet,
Saturday.
Whether it is good sportsman
ship or not, it is a certainty that
Stanford and Cal trackmen and
coaches aren't going to shed any
tears over the absence of the Tro
jan flyer. They'll look at it this
way—Dean Cromwell of U.S.C.
wouldn't take down his hair if
Slunf/ml lost Malott or if Cal lost
Miller, so there is no reason why
the bay teams should get altruistic
about the team that has trounced
them both already.
Dink Templeton can't say any
thing, but with Zamperini out Stan
ford's chances are 100 per cent bet
ter. Ed Burrows showed he can
run away from anything at Cali
fornia in both distance races on the
same afternoon, and if he can get
by without much trouble from the
distance men up north there is a def
inite chance for Stanford to win both
mile and two-mile in the P.C.C.
meet.
Should such a thing come to
pass, the selection of Stanford as
the conference winner would be
come a little less goofy. Also
strengthening the Card's chances
is the report, if true, that Nutting
again has a bad leg and Charlie
Miller's knee hurts him when he
runs.
However, it may be recalled that
Cal suckered Stanford beautifully
on that Nutting deal at Big Meet—
Arnold was supposed to have such
a bad leg he couldn't run more than
75 yards, and the pickers who fav
ored Stanford went hook, line, and
sinker for the play. Nutting was in
the finest shape he had ever
achieved when he stepped to the
Start of the 100 in the Big Meet.

Carl. He's going to get a couple of
courses he can't get at Stanford, but
he won't be on the track team.

Is
r JpHE removal of Louis Zamperini
from the Southern California
track team makes what is known as
a beatiful story in sports writing.
For several days to come there will
be lots to talk about for the sports
boys on the papers—the story has
everything, and the most will be
made of it.
However, the loss of Zamperini
won't get much airing around Stan
ford and California, and if there is J
any place that the incident is im
portant it's the two bay region uni
versities.
All the Bears and Indians can do
is sit back and shut up, and hope
secretly that this isn't all a hoax
and that Zamperini really is with- |
out a team for the conference meet,
Saturday.
Whether it is good sportsman
ship or not, it is a certainty that
Stanford and Cal trackmen and
coaches aren't going to shed any
tears over the absence of the Tro
jan flyer. They'll look at it this
way—Dean Cromwell of U.S.C.
wouldn't take down his hair if
Slunf/ml lost Malott or if Cal lost
Miller, so there is no reason why
the bay teams should get altruistic
about the team that has trounced
them both already.
Dink Templeton can't say any
thing, but with Zamperini out Stan
ford's chances are 100 per cent bet
ter. Ed Burrows showed he can
run away from anything at Cali
fornia in both distance races on the
same afternoon, and if he can get
by without much trouble from the
distance men up north there is a def
inite chance for Stanford to win both
mile and two-mile in the P.C.C.
meet.
Should such a thing come to
pass, the selection of Stanford as
the conference winner would be
come a little less goofy. Also
strengthening the Card's chances
is the report, if true, that Nutting
again has a bad leg and Charlie
Miller's knee hurts him when he
runs.
However, it may be recalled that
Cal suckered Stanford beautifully
on that Nutting deal at Big Meet—
Arnold was supposed to have such
a bad leg he couldn't run more than
75 yards, and the pickers who fav
ored Stanford went hook, line, and
sinker for the play. Nutting was in
the finest shape he had ever
achieved when he stepped to the
Start of the 100 in the Big Meet.
The persons that don't have to be
hit by a brick wall to learn things
aren't going to feel so sure about
Cal's injuries this time.

GET back to Zamperini for a
moment —whether there is justi
fication for his refusal to run in the
Compton meet because he didn't
get the expense money he wanted
or not, there is a distinctly disagree
able odor arising from the whole
mess.
As one writer put it yesterday,
Zamperini was only following the
,xample set by other athletes in
demanding what he thought was his
due. The trouble was that the fel
low Zamperini made his demands
upon had a different idea of what
Zamp's due was, and he went to the
extent of bringing the affair into the
open.
However, there is another way
to look at it, too. Zamperini has
a long way to go before he ever
becomes the champion in his
sport that Hank Luisetti was in
basketball, and Luisetti never
mucked up his amateur reputation
with extra-legal phenagling. Zam
perini might have had the right
to demand as much expense money
as other amateurs have, but he
thereby took himself out of the
class of such as Luisetti. who
played the game all the way, all
the time.

The Junior P.AA. meet at San
Jose Saturday, which Stanford won
with 68 points, brought some cheer
to the Indian forces in the form of
improved performances that might
develop into some points by con
ference meet time.
Tom Montgomery seems to have
licked that slump, and while the 50
feet 4 inches he did at San Jose
won't win the conference shot, it's
good at least for second. If he gets
off that good put he's been seeking
all season in the Berkeley affair
Saturday he might even win.
Rusty March finally got off a
good one to win the 880 in 1:56.6,
and just at the right time. Carl
Mahurin pulled a muscle last
week and figures he's all through
as a runner. Rusty is needed to
take his place.
Incidentally, the announcement
that Mahurin is going to Cal next
year is the cold dope, according to
Carl. He's going to get a couple of
courses he can't get at Stanford, but
he won't be on the track team.
