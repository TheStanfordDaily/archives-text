# Stanford Cindermen Sweep P. A. Meet
## Huston Wins Low Hurdles In Fast Heat Jack Walton Leads Scoring; March Sets New 880 Record 
### 
Dink Templeton pulled his boys
, decisively to the top of the heap
Saturday, and the Farm squad won
| the Pacific Association track meet
going away. The rfiargin of victory
j was a mere 47 points.
! Dark horse among the Stanford
I place winners was an unknown
| junior transfer. You've probably
I never heard much about Paul Hus
| ton before, but he'll be right up
j there next season.
Low hurdler Huston, who never
| placed in a meet before while run
ning for Dink, showed his heels to
I a fast group in the trials of the 220-
| lows in the time of 24.2. Then to
I show it was not just a flash in the
I pan, he came back in the finals to
! win at 24 flat, seven yards ahead of
| [fourth-place Bill Hawkins, Stan
' ford's best known hurdler.
Walton High Scorer
Big Jack Walton attended to the
I weights for the Cards in fine fashion,
| emerging finally as high-point man
of the day. He won the discus
throw, heaving the platter out to the
149-foot mark. Not content with
one blue ribbon, he came back again
to win the 56-pound weight heave
with a grunt of 29 feet, inches,
i His remaining two points were gar-
I nered by a third in the hammer
I throw.
Montgomery, Lipman, and Ander
! sen placed one, two, three in the
| shot put, to show that Dink can
j still pick 'em in the weights. Monty's
j mark of 50 feet, 4 inches, was not
i only god enough to win by almost
a foot, but he also cracked the ex
isting junior P.A. mark.
A Likely Tale
The track men tell a queer one
about Tom's performance. With only
one heave left, Montgomery was
I fully two feet behind the leaders.
As he was hefting the weight before
I his toss, an official, who happened
to be a Farm man, came up to
whisper something into the Big
'Un's ear. Whatever he said must
I have been dynamite, for the result
ant toss won the event.
Another record-breaking perform
ance for the Cards was chalked up
by Rusty March in the 880-yard run.
! In the best battle of the afternoon,
Rusty nosed out Ed Stevenson of
Fresno State and teammate Barney
Ferguson in the impressive time of
1 minute, 56.6 seconds.
The best Stan Hiserman could
manage was a third in the 100 and a
second in the furlong. But Stan was
running against a high school lad
, who came out from obscurity Satur
; day to prove himself the equal of
, any dashman on the Coast.
Iligh School Star
This high school junior, Harold
Davis by name, set a record in the
220-yard dash by beating Stan to
the tape in the time of 21 seconds
flat. The same stripling won the
century, and Hiserman lost the sec
ond place ribbon to Cal's Elton
Brombacher by an eyelash.
Sumner Gill pulled five more
points Dink's way. "when he cleared
the bar in the pole vault at the
height of 13 feet. Teammates Vic
Bore and frosh ace Walt MacKenzie
went pointless.
Clean Sweep
Incidentally the red shirted lads
administered a clean sweep when
Ted Huckiebridge and Stan Ander
i sen followed Jack Walton in the
i discus throw in the order named
• Andersen went hog wild on third
: places, it seems, for the big Swede
j added a digit in the 56-pound weighl
! event to his thirds in the discus and
the shot.
Card Ben Smith hop-stepped and
) yoomped 41 feet, 8 inches in his
■ .event only to watch Bendeich of
> S. J. State, and Purcell of Visalia
; J.C. beat his mark, the latter alsc
j administering a pasting to the rec
ord Ray Brown of the Cards set up
, last year.
Bill Braheny and George Shaw
i managed to sling the javelin fai
! enough to gain a second and s
fourth respectively. Braheny's heave
of 189 feet. 2 inches was a yard short
of a win, but watch his smoke next
year.
t Fourth in Mile
t Johnny Emmanuel was forced tr
i drop back to a fourth place in thi
f mile event after a scorching pact
t that took away the Farm star's fin
ishing kick. Winning time was
I 4:31.2.

Walton High Scorer
Big Jack Walton attended to the
I weights for the Cards in fine fashion,
| emerging finally as high-point man
of the day. He won the discus
throw, heaving the platter out to the
149-foot mark. Not content with
one blue ribbon, he came back again
to win the 56-pound weight heave
with a grunt of 29 feet, inches,
i His remaining two points were gar-
I nered by a third in the hammer
I throw.
Montgomery, Lipman, and Ander
! sen placed one, two, three in the
| shot put, to show that Dink can
j still pick 'em in the weights. Monty's
j mark of 50 feet, 4 inches, was not
i only god enough to win by almost
a foot, but he also cracked the ex
isting junior P.A. mark.
A Likely Tale
The track men tell a queer one
about Tom's performance. With only
one heave left, Montgomery was
I fully two feet behind the leaders.
As he was hefting the weight before
I his toss, an official, who happened
to be a Farm man, came up to
whisper something into the Big
'Un's ear. Whatever he said must
I have been dynamite, for the result
ant toss won the event.
Another record-breaking perform
ance for the Cards was chalked up
by Rusty March in the 880-yard run.
! In the best battle of the afternoon,
Rusty nosed out Ed Stevenson of
Fresno State and teammate Barney
Ferguson in the impressive time of
1 minute, 56.6 seconds.
The best Stan Hiserman could
manage was a third in the 100 and a
second in the furlong. But Stan was
running against a high school lad
, who came out from obscurity Satur
; day to prove himself the equal of
, any dashman on the Coast.
Iligh School Star
This high school junior, Harold
Davis by name, set a record in the
220-yard dash by beating Stan to
the tape in the time of 21 seconds

century, and Hiserman lost the sec
ond place ribbon to Cal's Elton
Brombacher by an eyelash.
Sumner Gill pulled five more

Clean Sweep
Incidentally the red shirted lads

Bill Braheny and George Shaw
i managed to sling the javelin fai

fourth respectively. Braheny's heave
of 189 feet. 2 inches was a yard short

t Fourth in Mile
t Johnny Emmanuel was forced tr
i drop back to a fourth place in thi
f mile event after a scorching pact

Dink Templeton pulled his boys
, decisively to the top of the heap
Saturday, and the Farm squad won
| the Pacific Association track meet
going away. The rfiargin of victory
j was a mere 47 points.
! Dark horse among the Stanford
I place winners was an unknown
| junior transfer. You've probably
I never heard much about Paul Hus
| ton before, but he'll be right up
j there next season.
Low hurdler Huston, who never
| placed in a meet before while run
ning for Dink, showed his heels to
I a fast group in the trials of the 220-
| lows in the time of 24.2. Then to
I show it was not just a flash in the
I pan, he came back in the finals to
! win at 24 flat, seven yards ahead of
| [fourth-place Bill Hawkins, Stan
' ford's best known hurdler.
Walton High Scorer
Big Jack Walton attended to the
I weights for the Cards in fine fashion,
| emerging finally as high-point man
of the day. He won the discus
throw, heaving the platter out to the
149-foot mark. Not content with
one blue ribbon, he came back again
to win the 56-pound weight heave
with a grunt of 29 feet, inches,
i His remaining two points were gar-
I nered by a third in the hammer
I throw.
Montgomery, Lipman, and Ander
! sen placed one, two, three in the
| shot put, to show that Dink can
j still pick 'em in the weights. Monty's
j mark of 50 feet, 4 inches, was not
i only god enough to win by almost
a foot, but he also cracked the ex
isting junior P.A. mark.
A Likely Tale
The track men tell a queer one
about Tom's performance. With only
one heave left, Montgomery was
I fully two feet behind the leaders.
As he was hefting the weight before
I his toss, an official, who happened
to be a Farm man, came up to
whisper something into the Big
'Un's ear. Whatever he said must
I have been dynamite, for the result
ant toss won the event.
Another record-breaking perform
ance for the Cards was chalked up
by Rusty March in the 880-yard run.
! In the best battle of the afternoon,
Rusty nosed out Ed Stevenson of
Fresno State and teammate Barney
Ferguson in the impressive time of
1 minute, 56.6 seconds.
The best Stan Hiserman could
manage was a third in the 100 and a
second in the furlong. But Stan was
running against a high school lad
, who came out from obscurity Satur
; day to prove himself the equal of
, any dashman on the Coast.
Iligh School Star
This high school junior, Harold
Davis by name, set a record in the
220-yard dash by beating Stan to
the tape in the time of 21 seconds
flat. The same stripling won the
century, and Hiserman lost the sec
ond place ribbon to Cal's Elton
Brombacher by an eyelash.
Sumner Gill pulled five more
points Dink's way. "when he cleared
the bar in the pole vault at the
height of 13 feet. Teammates Vic
Bore and frosh ace Walt MacKenzie
went pointless.
