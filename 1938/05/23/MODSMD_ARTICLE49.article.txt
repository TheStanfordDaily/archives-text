YESTERDAY morning's top story in the Chron
icle about the most recent development in
Europe started us off on a little game.
Like this: For 1938, substitute 1914. For
Czechoslovakia, read Serbia.
In the place of two Sudeten Germans, put
an Archduke, or (multiple choice) two minor
Japanese military attaches. For Hitler, place
Kaiser Wilhelm. Constants in the problem are
France and England.
That is all the farther we have gotten. But
while substitutions are being made, inciden
tally, perhaps Graham Stuart had better re
place winter by fall quarter when he signs
up his peace course next year. It may help to
save us making a substitution in a couple of
years—White Star liner for Lusitania.—J. S.
