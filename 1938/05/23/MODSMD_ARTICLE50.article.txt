OUR attempts to get a payoff out of the capi
talistic slot machine haven't been going
well recently. We have gotten lots of letters,
but they are all alike—"We regret that we have
no opening available . . It seems that un
til the proletariat takes over there will be no
room in business for a promising young stu
dent with three legs on an A.B. and one hand
on his aching head.
But the spirit of our pioneer ancestors has
not thrown in the towel. We have given up the
idea of getting a job, and instead we have
worked out a program that will carry the New
Deal to its illogical conclusion. When adopted
our plan will settle the job problem with all
'he finality of a note from the Dean.
The idea is really quite simple, and a close
study of it will cause no headaches, even in
Roble. It all stems from, one of the funda
mental philosophies of government. We are
pledged to maintain and improve the natural
.beauty of our country. As geologists will tell
us, one of the most powerful forces in creating
rscenery is glaciation. Thsretore, it is obvious
that our federal government should build a
glacier.
The principle is easily seen. And the tech
nical organization is not difficult. The project
could be put under the Department of Interior
Park Service. It would be called the Federal
Emergency Ice Age, FEIA to its friends.
And the economic repercussions of the
FEIA would be as powerful as the repercus
sions of a thoughtless quote from Dorothy
Parker at a faculty tea.
Naturally, the glacier would be built on
marginal land. This would in effect re-estab
lish the AAA, and the Supreme Court could do
nothing about it but bite its nails and swear.
Moreover, the stimulus to heavy industry,
ammonia manufacturers, construction, and the
like would pack all the force of scotch on Cuba
libres. All industries connected with ice manu
facture would boom. And since the glacier
would be in an isolated place, railroads would
have to be built; hotels would be needed. Ham
burger stands and sanitary rest rooms for tour
ists would be indispensable.
But all of these effects would be merely sec
ondary. The real beauty of the scheme lies in
its influence on labor. If all the ice men were
taken out into the wilderness and put to work
hauling ice to build a glacier, they would see
no more of cooks and maids. Therefore they
would no longer marry cooks and maids.
With the ice men and cooks no longer tin
kering with the vital statistics, labor would be
reduced to the optimum number in one genera
tion. Unemployment would vanish like a check
from home. There would be jobs lor every
body.
With this program we can abolish depression
in a year.
We are presenting our plan to Washington
next month. We urge you to wire your con
gressman, hold rallies in the streets, and pa
tronize your local merchants. Our motto
"You can't give the Ice Age a cold shoulder."
