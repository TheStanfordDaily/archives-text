THERE has been a syndicated picture repro
duced in several papers recently which
catches one's attention abruptly. It shows a
bonfire, surrounded by school boys. The cap
tion below tells you that books, put under of
ficial ban by the Nazis, are rapidly being con
sumed on the pyre.
You think back on some of them which are
turning to ashes. Thomas Mann's "Magic
Mountain" is probably there. Heinrich Heine's
poetry is there too —he was a Jew. You know
that not only the obvious anti-Nazi writing is
being destroyed, but also some of the great
art of the world, futilely attacked by a mad
government.
But you are struck more by the sight of lads,
in short breeches, smiling, laughing. It is ob
vious that they have no idea what they are
doing, or why. Probably they have slipped a
few school-books into the flames, surrepti
tiously. It's a great lark.
It makes no difference. What they are de
stroying there is reproduced thousands of
times over elsewhere in the world. It only
brings us up sharply to the realization that, in
spite of electric lights and modern sanitation,
people are still living in the days of the Spanish
Inquisition.—J. S.
