### REVOLT NEXT DOOR 
I AZARO CARDENAS has been in power in Mexico
for some time now, bringing to that backward
land a government communist in name and liberal
socialist in practice. An enlightened man trying to
achieve progress in a nation whose culture solidified
with the defeat of the Spanish conqueror in 1223, he
has hoed a hard row with outstanding success during
an unusually peaceful term in office.
Now, however —at least outwardly—his luck seems
to be turning. The curse of the Latin Americas is
threatening him. A general wants to revolt; and La
zaro Cardenas finds tossed in his lap, at a time when
expropriation of foreign oil leases is keeping him con
stantly occupied, the proflem of suppressing General
Saturnino Cedillo of the State of San Luis Potosi, who
has seized this crucial period in Mexico foreign rela
tions to make his bid for power.
What the general would have to offer his fellow
countrymen if he were successful—and he probably
will not be, since the revolt seems to be localized in
his state, and the federal arms seem more than strong
enough to defeat it—remains problematical. Mexican
troubles are among the most strictly native in all
Latin America, with the result that he is probably not
backed by anything but his own desire for the presi
dency; and would give the country a correspondingly
selfish rule if he were to capture the office.
The Catholic Church might be behind him, since
it has suffered heavy losses under the Cardenas re
gime; but the Mexican Catholic Church has not for
many years maintained the close ties with Rome
make possible such openly inspired revolution as that
in Spain. The land owners might be behind him, sinct.
most of their estates have been split up; but they are
not unified into a sufficiently strong group to permit
them to do anything more than ride along with what
ever strong man happens to be in power.
They do not make revolutions; they accept them.
So also do the foreign interests, of which the British
are kept from action by the European situation, and
the American by the good neighbor policy of the
Roosevelt administration.
Nor are the people behind the revolt. Mexicans
as a whole like their president and his government.
The oil expropriation quarrel has united them in op
position to a common foe; and neither the spirit nor
the psychological occasion for a successful revolt
would seem to exist among them.
Saturnino Cedillo will probably be beaten, and
beaten without too much blood-shed. And Lazaro
Cardenas, a man with a mission and the good will of
liberals everywhere, will be able to continue un
hampered his slow but steady reconstruction of our
neighbor to the south.—Allen Drury.

are kept from action by the European situation, and
the American by the good neighbor policy of the
Roosevelt administration.
Nor are the people behind the revolt. Mexicans
as a whole like their president and his government.
The oil expropriation quarrel has united them in op
position to a common foe; and neither the spirit nor
the psychological occasion for a successful revolt
would seem to exist among them.
Saturnino Cedillo will probably be beaten, and
beaten without too much blood-shed. And Lazaro
Cardenas, a man with a mission and the good will of
liberals everywhere, will be able to continue un
hampered his slow but steady reconstruction of our
neighbor to the south.—Allen Drury.
I AZARO CARDENAS has been in power in Mexico
for some time now, bringing to that backward
land a government communist in name and liberal
socialist in practice. An enlightened man trying to
achieve progress in a nation whose culture solidified
with the defeat of the Spanish conqueror in 1223, he
has hoed a hard row with outstanding success during
an unusually peaceful term in office.
Now, however —at least outwardly—his luck seems
to be turning. The curse of the Latin Americas is
threatening him. A general wants to revolt; and La
zaro Cardenas finds tossed in his lap, at a time when
expropriation of foreign oil leases is keeping him con
stantly occupied, the proflem of suppressing General
Saturnino Cedillo of the State of San Luis Potosi, who
has seized this crucial period in Mexico foreign rela
tions to make his bid for power.
What the general would have to offer his fellow
countrymen if he were successful—and he probably
will not be, since the revolt seems to be localized in
his state, and the federal arms seem more than strong
enough to defeat it—remains problematical. Mexican
troubles are among the most strictly native in all
Latin America, with the result that he is probably not
backed by anything but his own desire for the presi
dency; and would give the country a correspondingly
selfish rule if he were to capture the office.
The Catholic Church might be behind him, since
it has suffered heavy losses under the Cardenas re
gime; but the Mexican Catholic Church has not for
many years maintained the close ties with Rome
make possible such openly inspired revolution as that
in Spain. The land owners might be behind him, sinct.
most of their estates have been split up; but they are
not unified into a sufficiently strong group to permit
them to do anything more than ride along with what
ever strong man happens to be in power.
They do not make revolutions; they accept them.
