r outstanding success of "Is Europe" makes us
more aware than ever of the dearth of student
written plays on the campus. Outside of the skits in
the Gaieties, and the Spring Show, there are practically
none, or at least, there are few chances for them to be
produced. Of course, this week thei'e are to be pro
ductions of a set of student-written one-acts, but the
event is almost unique on the campus.
For the most part, the campus is not much the loser.
But on the other hand, we remember that, according
to the story, Maxwell Anderson received a C in a
play-writing course here. It is very doubtfid if any
real radiant lights are being hidden under campus
bushels, but you never can tell.
Part of the responsibility for uncovering student
talent lies with the Division, since such things are a
legitimate part of its curricular duties. But the sched
ule is full now, and, with a small expense budget.,
the division can hardly afford to fiddle around with
amateur works to any great extent.
It should fall in the realm of Stagers, or rather of
Dramatic Council, to include a few more original plays
in their schedule. They might be produced on about
the same scale as the readings, not as competitors to
the already established Gaieties and Spring Show, but
as minor additions to the program of productions.
Nothing might turn up, but it would at least en
courage a bit more amateur writing, and that would
be a good thing in itself. Most other schools do have
a little more in this line, with some remarkable results.
Of course the "47" workshop plays of Yale are a tra
dition. But, for instance, at North Carolina, student
writers specialize in folk material, and do exceedingly
well at it. Besides having real merit on an artistic
scale, the plays have been campus box-office successes,
and have even found their way, on occasion, to Broad
way.
Such encouragement might have its effect on Spring
Show, and very possibly could fit in nicely with Dra
matic Council's one-time great idea of a Winter Show.
With writing going on all year round, instead of a
mad rush before Spring Show deadline, plays as con
sistently good as "Is Europe." or even IÂ»elter. would
not be too much to i-xpoct Stone,
