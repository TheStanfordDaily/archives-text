# Persian Exhibitor Shows Art Treasures in Gallery

### JEANNE WILSON 
"I think that American.-, should know something more of things Per
sian than rugs, cats, and lamb."
In this way does M. Yonan-Malck express the purpose of his efforts
to bring the art of ancient Persia to the attention of Americans, particularly
those living on the West Coast, hv means of exhibits such as he is now

displaying in the glass cases in
entrance hall of the Stanford Art
Gallery.
The exhibit includes miniatures, j
ceramics, examples of the work of
Persian calligraphers and a few
textiles. Close attention to detail
is the keynote of most of the work,
which was done usually by servants
in the palaces of Persian nobles, ac
cording to Mr. Malek.
"The art of Persia is a strictly
utilitarian one," he continues, "It
shows the spirit of the sincere aes
thetic, all for humans' sake instead
of for art's sake. Art for effect
alone would not have lasted as this ,
work has."
Malek Plans Trip
It is Mr. Malek's hope that some
western university will become in
terested enough to establish a Near
Eastern department. His only criti
cism of Stanford is that it contains
no books on Persian culture in its li
brary.
Although he was born in Persia
and educated there, in Russia, and
in the United States, Mr. Malek con
siders himself a world citizen, and
hopes to return to the Near East for
continued study. He is inviting five
graduate students, residents of the
Bay region, who are interested in
Persian art to make the trip with
him.
The basis of the art philosophy of
Persia, according to Mr. Malek, is
the garden. Persia is largely a des
ert and to the Persians a garden is
paradise on earth. In their minia
ture and ceramic work, intricate
floral designs are often used as a
background for the subject.
Calligraphy Practiced
The art of calligraphy or pen
manship as practiced by Persian art
ists is known as the "gentleman's
profession." One of the examples
which Mr. Malek has on display is
a book written by a Christian bishop
in the court of the time of the Ara
bian Nights and copied 85 years ago
by the man who was then private
secretary to the Czar of Russia. One
of the selections in the book can be
read either from right to left or
from left to right with the same
meaning and the same poetic ex
pression.
The example of ceramics which
are included in the exhibition are
good examples of what Mr. Malek
terms the utilitarianism of Persian
art. Having no rock quarries or
sources of timber, the Persians were
forced to use clay for their chief
building material. In accordance
with the artistic spirit of the times,
the work was often decorated with
mineral paints, and today serves as
a good example of Near Eastern art.
Because Persian art was used on
every-day utensils and soon became
worn out, because religious teach
ings forbade decoration of the mos
ques and temples, and because dev
astating wars continually swept
Persia, little of the authentic art of
the Near East remains. According j
to Mr. Malek, this exhibition is the j
only balanced one west of New I
York.
