Weird, minor strains of Oriental
music will accompany "Song of
China," a motion picture to be shown
tomorrow evening in Memorial Hall J
at 7:30 o'clock. This motion picture J
will be under the auspices of the j
Tuesday Evening Series, to which I
the public is invited.
This picture is of special interest \
because it is the first made in the
Orient to be considered worthy of
popular American consumption. The j
Shanghai Mail said of it:
"Produced, directed, acted, pho- I
tographed and musically scored en- 1
tirely by Chinese, in China, this is 1
the greatest motion picture ever !
made in the Orient, and the equal j
of any of the importations from !
across the sea."
Told with simplicity and restraint j
characteristic of the ancient nation, !
it reflects the conflicts between the ■
old and the new China's social cus
toms and standards. It portrays the !
break-down of the traditional Chi- ;
nese heritage by Western civiliza- !
tion. Though perhaps lacking in
high dramatic quality, it is an un- j
usual study of the deep social prin- !
ciple of filial obedience imbedded in >
the life of three Chinese genera- j
tions.
