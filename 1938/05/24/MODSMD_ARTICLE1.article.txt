### BILL MILLIS 
I ET NO ONE conclude that since
the Czechoslovakian crisis is
now simmering into internal nego
tiations involving Premier Milan
Hodza and Sudeten German leader
Konrad Henlein, and international
diplomacy particularly involving
Germany and Great Britain, that a
peaceful settlement necessarily will
be reached, or that Europe has done
more than pass another milestone
on the road to a new 1914.
Czechoslovakia can be fitted
into the pattern of the Third
Reich's "March to the East" only
in terms of what preceded the
forced Anschluss with Austria
three months ago. On Feb. 13,
Adolf Hitler negotiated the Bcrch-
agreement with cx-
Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg
which — through the recognition
of the legality of the Nazi party
and the naming of two Nazis to
the cabinet —was interpreted as a
peaceful settling of the Austrian
impasse.
Instead of peace, Berchtesgaden,
as the world knows, was followed
by ever-mounting civil violence
within Austria, ended by the move
ment of German troops to Vienna.

What Austria has to do with
Czechoslovakia is that it illustrates
that once Nazis have won their im
mediate gains by negotiations, they
will merely set up new goals to ac
complish.
Breaking his silence on the
Czech affair, Der Fuehrer,
"through one of his closest associ
ates" now in London, has assured
England that he has "not the
slightest intention" of marching
German troops into Czechoslo
vakia.
It was revealed that Capt. Fritz
Wicdmann, Hitler's personal ad
jutant, was in London over the
week-end on a secret mission. He
was understood to have said that
Germany hopes that the Prague
Government will "respect the re
sults" of the municipal elections
and "act accordingly."

In London, Prime Minister Ne
ville Chamberlain told a cheering
House of Commons that "the British
Government made representations to
Berlin of the utmost importance of
reaching a settlement if European
peace was to be preserved" which
resulted in the conference of Henlein
and Premier Hodza.
In Prague, it was announced
that the militant Nazi leader and
the head of Europe's last democ
racy east of the Rhine in their dis
cussions were able to "clarify and
calm" their views.

Chief Justice Hughes
may make oblique criticisms of
Mr. Justice Black in public ad
dresses, the Supreme Court seems
It) be swinging back to its pro-New
Deal decisions.
Yesterday the high court issued
three verdicts favoring the National
Labor Relations Board by refusing
to review circuit court decisions up
holding NLRB orders against the
Remington-Rand, Inc., the Black
Diamond Steamship Corp., and the
Washington Carlisle Lumber Co.
In two other decisions, affirm
ing the right to impose Federal
income taxes upon Port of New
York Authority employes, the
court, said Under-Secretary of the
Treasury Roswcll Magill, was
giving "the strongest kind of sup
port" to the Administration's cam
paign for taxing state and federal
salaries.
