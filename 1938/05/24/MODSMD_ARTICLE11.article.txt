# Seniors Plan Ball Ticket Sale
## Band Choice Cut To Three Prospects

Tickets for the Senior Ball, to be
held in the Toyon lobby June 17
from 10 to 4 o'clock, will go on sale
tomorrow morning in the A.S.S.U.
office for $8.50, according to Ed Bar
nett, chairman.
It was decided at a meeting of the
Senior Executive Committee held
last night in the Nitery that the
number of tickets will be limited to
350, and only seniors will be en
titled to purchase them.
While no final choice regarding
the band to play for the Ball has
been made, eligible bands have been
narrowed down to three possible
choices, and it is expected that the
Senior Ball Committee will an
nounce the choice later in the week.
Allen Oddie, co-chairman of pro
grams and announcements, explained
that the committee had secured an
additional 500 announcements, as
the original allotment of 8000 had
been sold. There are also 100 pro
grams unsold, which can be pur
chased at the A.S.S.U. office.
