# Old Boy Presents Sledges to Pledges
## 
### 
If. any time this next week,
you happen to see a group of
students running around the
Quad carrying sledge hammers,
have no fears for yourself. It is
just the Old Boy's subtle way of
letting the campus know that he
is initiating new members to the
Hammer and Coffin Society.
The new members are: Jack
Dixon, '40; John Elliot, '38; Alan
Kittell, '40; Sherman Mellinkoff,
'41; Collie Small, '39; Kenneth
Smith. '41; Mike Sparrow, '40;
Stan Swafford, '40. They were
elected last Friday night at the
annual meeting of the society.
