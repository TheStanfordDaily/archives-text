# KICKERS TO COMPETE
## 
### 
The lost art of drop-kicking will
come back into its own Thursday
afternoon when gridders and others
will seek possession of the George
Brooke Trophy which was present
ed to Stanford last quarter. Dr.
Thomas Storey has decreed the cup
to be an intramural award going to
the group which the winning kicker
represents.
