Newport has its season, New Orleans has
its Mardi Gras, and Stanford has its spring
quarter. Obviously, the greatest of these is -
spring quarter.
On this page is pictured Stanfordites en
joying what might have been a typical
spring day.
In the morning, time between classes is
short, and Library-lawn-lying is popular re
laxation. V/hy not? It's free and the sun is
nice. Also free (though house managers
gripe about storage charges) is afternoon
canoeing on Lagunita, as v/as the senior bar
becue, covered in the four photos below.
In the evening you dance, in this case at
the Alpha Sig formal and no one seems to
care if a couple of buccaneers drop over
from the Kappa Sigs' pirate dance.

Kennedy, Phyllis Dickman and Frances
Crawford. In the boathouse doorway, lack
