# Chinese Film To Be Shown Here Tonight
## Questionnaire To Be Given to Audience To Find Interests 
### 
"Song of China," a motion picture
illustrating the break-down of tra
ditional Chinese heritage by western
civilization, will be shown in Me
morial Hall at 7:30 o'clock this eve
ning as the Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series program.
Dux'ing the evening a question
naire will be presented, for the third
week, in order that members of the
audience may comment on prob
lems of interest to the Committee
on Public Exercises in connection
with the lecture series.
Questionnaire Results
One hundred seventy-one ques
tionnaires already have been turned
in. Of this number, 106 persons
said they attend the lectures fre
quently, 45 occasionally, and 10
seldom.
On type of program most pre
ferred, 109 first votes were cast for
public affairs, 93 for arts, 59 for sci
ence, and 26 for literature topics.
Although there has been consider
able comment about the public ad
dress system, 132 persons said they
have had no difficulty in hearing
since the system was installed. Ten
declared they have had difficulty,
and five indicated there is difficulty
in certain sections. Effectiveness of
the lighting was also queried by the
committee with 121 persons saying
the lighting is pleasing, 23 that it is
too bright, and 9 that it is too dark.
Opinion Divided
Opinion was almost equally di
vided on the matter of late arrivals,
with 72 saying late-comers dis
turbed them, 80 saying they were
not disturbed.
Perhaps most interesting to the
committee was the result of a ques
tion as to the classification of those
attending the lectures. Of the 171
persons responding, 39 were stu
dents, 27 were faculty members, 9
were members of the University
staff, 56 were residents of Palo Alto,
and 40 were residents of this vicin
ity.
Average Attendance
Average attendance at the lec
tures, according to the committee,
has been 540.
Tonight's picture is a story of a
well-to-do Chinese family. Effect
iveness of the story lies in its
strength as a human document. The
theme is reverence for one's parents,
the importance of filial obedience,
and the punishment which follows
reckless defiance of parental coun
sel.
There are English subtitles in
place of spoken words.
Reviewers say that, though lack
ing in high dramatic appeal, it is
gravely paced to an authentic Chi
nese score, and deserves a place of
its own in a series of cultural pro
grams.
In reviewing "Song of China," the
"Hollywood Spectator" said, "Every
foot of 'Song of China' is wholly of
Chinese make; story, direction, pho
tography, music, and cast are Chi
nese. But before the first reel has
been run, you will cease wondering
at the fact of its being an entirely
Oriental creation, and become aware
you are looking at one of the finest
motion pictures it has ever been
| your good fortune to see."
