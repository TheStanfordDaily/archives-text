all-University golf champion
ships aren't going to wind up in
the finals duel they did last year—
Jack Wallace and Bob Breyer tang
gled then, with Wallace winning 3
and 2, but the two elouters are
paired in the quarter-finals this
year. One will disappear from
competition.
Breyer, star of the freshman
team last year, reached the finals
with a series of brilliant matches
which were at first considered
lucky victories but later were con
ceded to be the real thing. He
slithered through to a 1-up win
over Spec Stewart, defending
champ heavily favored to trim
Breyer, in the semi-finals.
Wallace put Bill Oneal, runner-up
in 1936, out of the running last year
with a 4 and 3 trouncing in the semi
finals. Previously, Oneal had elim
inated Jeeb Halaby, "Najeeb the
Tentmaker" of the Beta Theta Pi
tong, and Wallace had come through
2 and 1 over Pete Hass in the third
round. Hass has reached the quar
ter-finals this year.
Art Doering, installed with Wal
lace a. a tourney favorite this year,
fell before Bill Boyd in the sec
ond round last year, 1 down, but
got his revenge this spring when
he coasted to a 3 and 2 victory
over Boyd Saturday. Doering is
paired with Don Kennedy in the
quarter-final bracket this year—
Kennedy tumbled (> and 5 before
Oneal last year in the second
round.
It seems as though most of these
golfers are at sixes and sevens;
there is little to choose between any
of them. One missed putt can make
you a chump, if you happen to miss
it against a dark horse.

FACTS: Last year in the
Fresno Relays Ray Malott was
caught in :47.6 for his lap of the mile
relay . . .this year the watches said
anything from :46.3 to :46.7 . . .
which amounts to a full second im
provement in the Fullerton Flyer's
time over the year . . . Stanford had
just a fair year there this season,
with third place, but it was different
last year ... in defeating the Trojan
horde by 10 points the 21 Cards
competing brought home 17 of the
gold watches given for first places
. . . The newspapermen laughed last
year when Dink Templeton told
them Stanford was liable to sweep
the relay events . .. but a little
smooth passing in the 440 relay
would have won for the Indians a
victory and a sweep ... At last re
ports Bob Alexander, ace miler of
last year who ran the anchor lap in
the Fresno medley and also the first
lap of the two-mile baton event, was
still going to art school in San Fran
cisco . .. he takes in all the art ex
hibits, concerts, operas, and other
culture he can possibly attend, ac
cording to one informant.

The first prototypes of newspapers
were called "corantos" and origin
ated in Holland in 1620.

over Spec Stewart, defending
champ heavily favored to trim
Breyer, in the semi-finals.
Wallace put Bill Oneal, runner-up
in 1936, out of the running last year
with a 4 and 3 trouncing in the semi
finals. Previously, Oneal had elim
inated Jeeb Halaby, "Najeeb the
Tentmaker" of the Beta Theta Pi
tong, and Wallace had come through
2 and 1 over Pete Hass in the third
round. Hass has reached the quar
ter-finals this year.
Art Doering, installed with Wal
lace a. a tourney favorite this year,
fell before Bill Boyd in the sec
ond round last year, 1 down, but
got his revenge this spring when
he coasted to a 3 and 2 victory
over Boyd Saturday. Doering is
paired with Don Kennedy in the
quarter-final bracket this year—
Kennedy tumbled (> and 5 before
Oneal last year in the second
round.
It seems as though most of these
golfers are at sixes and sevens;
there is little to choose between any
of them. One missed putt can make
you a chump, if you happen to miss
it against a dark horse.

FACTS: Last year in the
Fresno Relays Ray Malott was
caught in :47.6 for his lap of the mile
relay . . .this year the watches said
anything from :46.3 to :46.7 . . .
which amounts to a full second im
provement in the Fullerton Flyer's
time over the year . . . Stanford had
just a fair year there this season,
with third place, but it was different
last year ... in defeating the Trojan
horde by 10 points the 21 Cards
competing brought home 17 of the
gold watches given for first places
. . . The newspapermen laughed last
year when Dink Templeton told
them Stanford was liable to sweep
the relay events . .. but a little
smooth passing in the 440 relay
would have won for the Indians a
victory and a sweep ... At last re
ports Bob Alexander, ace miler of
last year who ran the anchor lap in
the Fresno medley and also the first
lap of the two-mile baton event, was
still going to art school in San Fran
cisco . .. he takes in all the art ex
hibits, concerts, operas, and other
culture he can possibly attend, ac
cording to one informant.

the finals duel they did last year—
Jack Wallace and Bob Breyer tang
gled then, with Wallace winning 3
and 2, but the two elouters are
paired in the quarter-finals this
year. One will disappear from
competition.
Breyer, star of the freshman
team last year, reached the finals
with a series of brilliant matches
which were at first considered
lucky victories but later were con
ceded to be the real thing. He
slithered through to a 1-up win
over Spec Stewart, defending

Breyer, in the semi-finals.
