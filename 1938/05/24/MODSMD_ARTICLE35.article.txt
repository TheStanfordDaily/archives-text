# Lynch Cains Final Round In Tennis
## Underwood To Play Low to Determine Finalist's Opponent 
### 
After five long sets of some of
the toughest tennis seen on the
campus this year, Jack Lynch
fought his way through the finals of
the all-University championship
yesterday by overcoming Dave
Brock, 6-4, 4-6, 0-6, 6-2, 6-2, on the
varsity courts.
Lynch's final-round opponent will
be determined this afternoon at 2
o'clock with the playing of the
semi-final in the other half of the
draw between Captain Bob Under
wood and Bob Low.
Winner Honored
Winner of the final round match
to be played tomorrow afternoon will
have his name inscribed on a new
permanent trophy put into compe
tition by Varsity Coach Sherm
Lockwood.
Brock was only able to push
Lynch to five gruelling sets by dis
playing some of the fine stroking
with which he scored a victory over
Frank Kovacs, youthful Davis Cup
prospect, earlier in the season.
Endurance Wins
Winning the third set at love,
Brock gave about all he had, and
after the 10-minute intermission,
Lynch kept the upper hand. Brock
was able to hold service only twice
in each of the last sets, with Lynch's
superior endurance the deciding
factor.
Lynch, former national junior
champion, hit his peak as Brock
tired, and he hit with precision
from corner to corner with his se
vere forehand to enhance his op
ponent's downfall.
With Underwood playing good
enough tennis to go four rounds in
the Southern California singles
tourney last week, he will be the
favorite in his match with Low. The
varsity ace has his entire reper
toire of shots under control, and he
has been rushing the net with
deadly effect.
