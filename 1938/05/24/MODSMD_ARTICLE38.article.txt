## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Farm Divoteers Enter Quarter-Finals Today 
### JERRY HAWLEY 
Eight Farm golfers will tee off today and tomorrow in the quarter
finals of Stanford's all-University golf championship. These rounds must
be played by tomorrow night. Semi-finals will be played off Saturday
and the 36-hole finals next week.
The tournament co-favorites, Jack Wallace, defending champion, and

Art Doering, will have the toughest
matches of the week when they
meet Bob Breyer and Don Kennedy,
respectively.
The Wallace-Breyer match will
be a repetition of last year's finals.
Breyer, only a freshman last year,
proved the surprise of the tourna
ment by working his way to the
finals through a strong list of vet
erans and putting up a scrappy fight
against Wallace.
Wallace Wins
Wallace showed a return to the
form that carried him to the title
last year by touring 13 holes in three
below par as he whipped Jack
Showalter, 7 and 5, in his first
round match last week.
Don Kennedy turned in the only
upset of this year's tournament when
he hit a "hot" putting streak and
turned the tables on little Jimmy
Rea, 6 and 5, in the first round. If
his putter is sizzling again this week,
he is expected to give Art Doering
a run for his money.
Doering Favored
Doering looms as the logical fav
orite, however. He captured quali
fying medal honors with a 69-67â€”
136, four under par for two rounds
'and six strokes better than his
nearest rival. In the first round, he
had little trouble disposing of Bill
Boyd, one of the scrappiest match
players in the tournament. 3 and 2.
Warren Berl, Farm freshman, is
well started on the road to repeat
ing Bob Breyer's feat of last year.
Berl is the only yearling who quali
fied for the tournament and shot a
birdie and an eagle on the last two
holes to win his first-round match
from Ren Sutton. He faces Max
Stoddard this week.
In the only other quarter-final,
Brown Cannon is expected to have
little trouble from Pete Hass.
