# Classes To Vie In Water Polo
## Interclass Contest Held As Hound Robin 
### 
Spring water polo practice goes
into its last stages today with the
first game of the annual interclass
series.
In a game moved up from Thurs
day to accommodate the players,
the juniors and sophs meet this aft
ernoon at 4:15 o'clock in Encina
Pools. Each team competes against
the other three in a round robin
ending on June 2.
With every class having one or
two outstanding men from the var
sity squad in its ranks, the position
of favorite has been hard to select.
Last year's freshman team is intact
and will undoubtedly show better
team play than the other three.
However, the upper classes have
all of the varsity men from last sea
son. The senior contingent, if not
Ihe best squad, will at least present
the biggest bulk with Bill Hanna,
captain of the varsity in '37, hefty
Jack Loupe and Jack Vibert, and
Dave Rider, this season's swimming
captain.
The junior squad, captained by
Johnny Lamb, boasts Harvey Roth
schild, Bill Hatch. Jim Wilson, and
a host of others while the sopho
mores under Bob Plate will offer
â€¢Dick Hoover, Bill Bleeker, Jack
Read, Lloyd Wilson, and a few
more.
A few experts have picked the
seniors to win with the frosh, jun
iors, and sophomores following in
this order.
The schedule: May 24, Soph-
Junior; May 25, Fi osh-Senior; May
30 Frosh-Junior; May 31, Soph-
Frosh; June 1, Junior-Senior; June
2, Soph-Senior.
