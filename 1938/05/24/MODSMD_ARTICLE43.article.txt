j three-score spring gridders yester-
I day entered the semi-final week of

Big Norm Standlee caught the
eyes of the experts with his master
ful exhibition in the pre-party
scrimmage presented to a big crowd
Friday ' afternoon. Standlee inter
cepted one pass 50 yards out and
burned up the yards on his way to a
touchdown. His terrific drives at
the middle and outside the tackles
haven't been equalled since Bobby
Grayson used to run loose. Gratify
i ing also was the work of Hamp
| Pool, who is gradually catching on
to his chores at right half. Pool
learned how to block and made sev
eral nice gains on reverses.
