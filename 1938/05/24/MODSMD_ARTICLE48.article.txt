# How To Write Edits
## 
### 
TWO men went to the traditional pre-election
show last night; today one of them will be
chosen editor of The Daily. Though this also
is an occasion for a number of 18-em slugs of
sentiment by the old editor who sees his term
nearly finished, the event won't make much
difference to the campus now.
But it will make a little more to the campus
next fall, and will make a good deal to the
winner when, as always happens at some point,
his friends tell him what a lousy volume he's
putting out. Your best friends do tell when
you stink here.
To tide him over these nasty spots I have
evolved a two-point program, guaranteed to
make his severest critics thank his editorial pol
icy is alive, brilliant, or fiery.
1. Insult some person or group.
2. Criticize some emotionally loaded custom
or practice.
Insulting a group is easy, though some care
must be used in selecting the group. It must
be a sensitive group and its members must be
able to write. That is an essential part of the
plan.
The frosh are always good material; they can
be told that they lack spirit, or that they are
five pounds per man underweight. Cardinals
used to be good game, but they are getting a
iittle cagey now. Administration officials make
the best hunting, but the practice is a little
dangerous.
In using the second method, even more care
must be exercised in choosing the object. "Big
Game Bonfire" might be tried next fall. The
editor could point out its essential uselessness
and its role as an incentive to vandalism. "Stan
ford Spirit" is always good for a whirl, but
r;hould be put on preserve before it becomes
too scarce.
From this point on the two methods are
identical. The result is a flood, or at least a
dribble, of Campus Opinion letters.
The editor proceeds to reply to these, still
insultingly if the slump is a bad one, or some
what off the subject if he desires. With a little
ingenuity he can have the dispute centered on
one of his pet projects by the third edit of the
series. Or he can wind up directly behind the
Administration's skirts.
And because people read the Campus Opin
ion column more than the edits, and because
during the campaign the letters will direct at
tention to the editorial column, the edits will
become better read. The editor's friends will
congratulate him, and the campus will know
the policy is live, brililant, or fiery.
This, of course, is a trade secret, which
probably should be told today's winner in
private.

able to write. That is an essential part of the
plan.
The frosh are always good material; they can
be told that they lack spirit, or that they are
five pounds per man underweight. Cardinals
used to be good game, but they are getting a
iittle cagey now. Administration officials make
the best hunting, but the practice is a little
dangerous.
In using the second method, even more care
must be exercised in choosing the object. "Big
Game Bonfire" might be tried next fall. The
editor could point out its essential uselessness
and its role as an incentive to vandalism. "Stan
ford Spirit" is always good for a whirl, but
r;hould be put on preserve before it becomes
too scarce.
From this point on the two methods are
identical. The result is a flood, or at least a
dribble, of Campus Opinion letters.
The editor proceeds to reply to these, still
insultingly if the slump is a bad one, or some
what off the subject if he desires. With a little
ingenuity he can have the dispute centered on
one of his pet projects by the third edit of the
series. Or he can wind up directly behind the
Administration's skirts.
And because people read the Campus Opin
ion column more than the edits, and because
during the campaign the letters will direct at
tention to the editorial column, the edits will
become better read. The editor's friends will
congratulate him, and the campus will know
the policy is live, brililant, or fiery.
This, of course, is a trade secret, which
probably should be told today's winner in
private.
TWO men went to the traditional pre-election
show last night; today one of them will be
chosen editor of The Daily. Though this also
is an occasion for a number of 18-em slugs of
sentiment by the old editor who sees his term
nearly finished, the event won't make much
difference to the campus now.
But it will make a little more to the campus
next fall, and will make a good deal to the
winner when, as always happens at some point,
his friends tell him what a lousy volume he's
putting out. Your best friends do tell when
you stink here.
To tide him over these nasty spots I have
evolved a two-point program, guaranteed to
make his severest critics thank his editorial pol
icy is alive, brilliant, or fiery.
1. Insult some person or group.
2. Criticize some emotionally loaded custom
or practice.
Insulting a group is easy, though some care
must be used in selecting the group. It must
be a sensitive group and its members must be
able to write. That is an essential part of the
plan.
