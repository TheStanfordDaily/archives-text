# Zamperini Off the Track
## 
### 
LOUIS ZAMPERINI, best miler on the coast
and perhaps best collegiate miler in the
country, will not compete in the conference
meet next Saturday.
The U.S.C. star's mistake, it seems fairly well
established, was to take too seriously the fu
rore created in certain circles by a 4:13 mile.
Ho thought it meant something, and, we are
told, asked for more expense money than the
particular promoter was willing to pay.
His second mistake was to carry out his threat
and fail to appear at the meet. Only "independ
ent" track men can do that, he found. He was
withdrawn from conference competition.
Certainly Zamperini was misled, but just as
certainly, it seems even at a 400-mile distance,
lie had reason to be mistaken. Only a sopho
more, he has already found that his running
lias a certain financial value, if he was willing
to make plausible representations of need.
That is true not only in Southern California but
also over the whole country.
And by reading the sports pages, he found
that he was an important figure. His running in
the Compton meet, he probably read, would
make that event a success. If he thought he
should share in that success, he might not
have been so far wrong.

The Compton meet was a symbol of another
part of Zamperini's trouble. We hear of the
commercialization of football, but not of track.
Yet these meets are as surely chamber of
commerce publicity stunts as are the regular
winter professional golf tournaments. Like these
tournaments, new ones spring up every year.
The local sport sections boom them as part
of their service to the city, and the metropoli
tan sections boom them because they make
possible more thrilling man-to-man races to
describe.
A victory in such a meet had nothing to do
with the honor or glory of Zamperini's college.
And he was tired, friends have said. But the
whole system combined to tell him he was im
portant to the meet.
Who can blame him if he sought a measure
of that importance?
