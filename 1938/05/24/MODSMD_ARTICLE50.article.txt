# BULL SESSION
## PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE 
### 
'PHE greatest visionary American ever produced was
a professor from New Jersey. The greatest Czecho
slovakia can lay claim to was the son of one of Franz
Joseph's coachmen. Together they created Europe's
most incongruous state.
Woodrow Wilson gave the world a League of Na
tions and the principle of self-determination. Thomas
Garrigue Masaryk gave it the first expression of that
principle when he founded the Czech nation. Today
the principle of the one and the state of the other are
both threatened with destruction.
When he first evolved self-determination, Presi
dent Wilson intended it to serve as a lever by which
the oppressive burden of European tyranny could be
lifted from the backs of the unfortunate minorities
suffering beneath it. In all good faith he intended it
as an answer to the minority problem which had so
long harrassed Europe.
What he did not realize—and what few men then
could see— was that eventually his weapon of democ
racy-against-tyranny would become the most effective
weapon of tyranny-against-democracy. He could not
foresee the rise of a Hitler, the justification of one
conquest and the start of another.
President Masaryk, equally idealistic, had a more
concrete reason for accepting the principle. When the
powers tossed into his country enough suppressed
minorities to keep Europe supplied with wars for 50
years, it was obvious that self-determination was the
only way to handle them. Democracy was in the air;
it was also the only form of government under which
>o many conflicting interests could be harmonized.
Convinced by idealism and necessity that it was the
only answer to his country's problem, he accepted it
and championed it as long as he lived.
And as long as he lived, democracy was compara
tively safe. Czechoslovakia prospered and grew strong.
She became the cornerstone of the Little Entente,
chief ally of France in Central Europe. She managed
to make her liberalism work, so that few internal con
flicts reached the racial conflict stage. She was def
initely a success, becoming with the twilight of the
League the only really concrete achievement of Amer
ica's war-time President.
Then Masaryk died, and with him died the charmed
life of the Czech republic; and side by side with the
rise of self-determination as an excuse for conquest
came the gradual collapse of self-determination's great
est experiment, as a unified nation.
Today, with the Little Entente split by a Fascist
Rumania and an Italian-dominated Yugoslavia, with
the Sudeten Germans growing stronger and stronger,
with Polish and Hungarian troops moving behind their
respective borders, it is beginning to look as though
Czechoslovakia may not have many more months of
life.
It is almost beginning to seem that self-determina
tion, Woodrow Wilson's most idealistic contribution
to international thought, may, like a siren whose kiss
means death, destroy the only state in Europe which
accepted it almost as idealistically as it was offered.

the oppressive burden of European tyranny could be
lifted from the backs of the unfortunate minorities
suffering beneath it. In all good faith he intended it
as an answer to the minority problem which had so
long harrassed Europe.
What he did not realize—and what few men then
could see— was that eventually his weapon of democ
racy-against-tyranny would become the most effective
weapon of tyranny-against-democracy. He could not
foresee the rise of a Hitler, the justification of one
conquest and the start of another.
President Masaryk, equally idealistic, had a more
concrete reason for accepting the principle. When the
powers tossed into his country enough suppressed
minorities to keep Europe supplied with wars for 50
years, it was obvious that self-determination was the
only way to handle them. Democracy was in the air;
it was also the only form of government under which
>o many conflicting interests could be harmonized.
Convinced by idealism and necessity that it was the
only answer to his country's problem, he accepted it
and championed it as long as he lived.
And as long as he lived, democracy was compara
tively safe. Czechoslovakia prospered and grew strong.
She became the cornerstone of the Little Entente,
chief ally of France in Central Europe. She managed
to make her liberalism work, so that few internal con
flicts reached the racial conflict stage. She was def
initely a success, becoming with the twilight of the
League the only really concrete achievement of Amer
ica's war-time President.
Then Masaryk died, and with him died the charmed
life of the Czech republic; and side by side with the
rise of self-determination as an excuse for conquest
came the gradual collapse of self-determination's great
est experiment, as a unified nation.
Today, with the Little Entente split by a Fascist
Rumania and an Italian-dominated Yugoslavia, with
the Sudeten Germans growing stronger and stronger,
with Polish and Hungarian troops moving behind their
respective borders, it is beginning to look as though
Czechoslovakia may not have many more months of
life.
It is almost beginning to seem that self-determina
tion, Woodrow Wilson's most idealistic contribution
to international thought, may, like a siren whose kiss
means death, destroy the only state in Europe which
accepted it almost as idealistically as it was offered.
