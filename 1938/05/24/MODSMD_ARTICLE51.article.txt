# GOIN' MY WAY

IT'S not often that we feel that we have a legitimate
gripe about the music racket, and when things like
"Ti Pi Tin" come floating our way through the radio
it's possible to shrug them off. And once in a while
we get a Dick Powell or some other type of foul vocal
ist, and again it's possible to take a somewhat calm
view of the matter. But there are some limits!
And it is with a poisoned soul that I view the advent
of this latest atrocity sponsored by Pudy Vallee called
"The Butcher Boy." Just about the time that swing is
getting a decent start and the public is beginning to
view dance music as something that does have worth
while merits, something like this "Butcher Boy" thing
comes spouting to lhe fore, and leaves a bad taste in
everyone's mouths except the corn merchants such as
the above mentioned Vallee and the rest of the hill
billys. It is so bad that it is almost good, and the only
thing funny about it all is that it aptly has the word
'butcher" in the title. It really is!
Next, I suppose, we will have to suffer a lot of so
called "swing arrangements" of this Italian folk song.
We can hardly wait. And a second thought makes it
apparent why the Italians have such a low national
living scale. Imagine having to listen to such tunes
all day. No wonder they go away to war.

VSu'ITH that out if the way, we can turn to the newest
development in the swing world, that of Gene
Krupa and his band. The band is very new, but it
has already recorded four sides, and on two of them,
that, sleep-robbing vocalist Helen Ward does the
honors.
As it was expected, the band is full of weaknesses
and the ensemble work is pretty ragged. The brass
section is weak, and from the sides we heard they
don't seem to have anyone capable of doing atid send
ing. However, in the reed section, Krupa has one of
the ace tenor men in the business, Vido Musso. It
was Musso, if you don't remember, who did the fine
work in the 12-inch Goodman disk of "Sing Sing Sing"
and his work hasn't suffered.
I You'll find in Krupa's version of "Grandfather's
Clock" ;i lot of showmanship with kep changes, heavy
drum background, and a hell of a lot of overblowing.
However, we arc hopeful of the band. They don't
seem to be headed for the commercial grove, and with
Helen Ward singing (whatta babe!) and Krupa drum
ming, the band is going to attract a lot of attention,
j even if its motto seems to be, "We don't play good,
j but we sure play loud." P;il MeGuirk,

the ace tenor men in the business, Vido Musso. It
was Musso, if you don't remember, who did the fine
work in the 12-inch Goodman disk of "Sing Sing Sing"
and his work hasn't suffered.
I You'll find in Krupa's version of "Grandfather's
Clock" ;i lot of showmanship with kep changes, heavy
drum background, and a hell of a lot of overblowing.
However, we arc hopeful of the band. They don't
seem to be headed for the commercial grove, and with
Helen Ward singing (whatta babe!) and Krupa drum
ming, the band is going to attract a lot of attention,
j even if its motto seems to be, "We don't play good,
j but we sure play loud." P;il MeGuirk,
IT'S not often that we feel that we have a legitimate
gripe about the music racket, and when things like
"Ti Pi Tin" come floating our way through the radio
it's possible to shrug them off. And once in a while
we get a Dick Powell or some other type of foul vocal
ist, and again it's possible to take a somewhat calm
view of the matter. But there are some limits!
And it is with a poisoned soul that I view the advent
of this latest atrocity sponsored by Pudy Vallee called
"The Butcher Boy." Just about the time that swing is
getting a decent start and the public is beginning to
view dance music as something that does have worth
while merits, something like this "Butcher Boy" thing
comes spouting to lhe fore, and leaves a bad taste in
everyone's mouths except the corn merchants such as
the above mentioned Vallee and the rest of the hill
billys. It is so bad that it is almost good, and the only
thing funny about it all is that it aptly has the word
'butcher" in the title. It really is!
Next, I suppose, we will have to suffer a lot of so
called "swing arrangements" of this Italian folk song.
We can hardly wait. And a second thought makes it
apparent why the Italians have such a low national
living scale. Imagine having to listen to such tunes
all day. No wonder they go away to war.

VSu'ITH that out if the way, we can turn to the newest
development in the swing world, that of Gene
Krupa and his band. The band is very new, but it
has already recorded four sides, and on two of them,
that, sleep-robbing vocalist Helen Ward does the
honors.
As it was expected, the band is full of weaknesses
and the ensemble work is pretty ragged. The brass
section is weak, and from the sides we heard they
don't seem to have anyone capable of doing atid send
ing. However, in the reed section, Krupa has one of
the ace tenor men in the business, Vido Musso. It

work in the 12-inch Goodman disk of "Sing Sing Sing"
