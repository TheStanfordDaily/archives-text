# CAMPUS OPINION
## STAGERS' CLARKE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stagers was very pleased that Jim
Stone liked our show, "Is Europe?",
but it is too bad that Owen Clarke's
name was omitted from the review.
We are sure that it must have been
a mistake because Owen worked
too hard on the show and did too
good a job to be ignored completely.
Because of this omission Stagers
feel justified in encroaching upon
Jim's prerogative as reviewer in
stating that we feel that Owen did
a highly commendable piece of
work. He never sang better, and his
acting was much improved.
Sincerely,
—Paul Crary,
President of Stagers.
