# THANKS

### 
The Editor, Sir:
May we use this means of saying
thank you to the many members of
this community who co-operated so
successfully in putting over the
Mothers' Club Fete in the Amphi
theater on Thursday. It would be
a real satisfaction to see each one
personally, were it possible to con
tact so many individuals.
Acknowledgments
The cheerful willingness with
which everyone accepted his part,
whether large or small, made the
whole effort a pleasant task.
It is hard to single out groups,
but we feel that public acknowledg
ment should be made to Mrs. Barr
of the Physical Education Depart
ment, who trained the country and
Morris dancers; to Mr. Harry Ma
loncy, who secured several of the
athletic performers; to the Stanford
Band, who not only played so ef
fectively, but formed a colorful ad
dition to the village crowd; and to

the Associated Students, whose gifts
of the public address system and its
operator made possible the enjoy
ment of every note and spoken
word. It would be impossible to
enumerate the many valuable serv
ices of the Division of Speech and
Drama. The posters designed by
the Division of Graphic Arts, and
the effective publicity of the Stan
ford Daily helped to attract the large
number who attended.
Fete Receipts Due Soon
It will still be some days before
we can check accounts and announce
the receipts o/ the Fete, but regard
less of that we feel sure that all who
took part will look back with satis
faction at having pioneered in this
use of the beautiful glade which Mr.
and Mrs. Frost have added to our
campus, and at having helped our
organization to help you as a stu
dent body in a greater variety of
ways.
Sincerely,
—Caro} G. Wilson,
President, Stanford Mothers' Club.
