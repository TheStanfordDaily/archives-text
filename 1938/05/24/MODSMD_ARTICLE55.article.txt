# House To Fake Up Wage-Hours Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23 (UP) —
The House voted overwhelmingly
today to discharge the Rules Com
mittee and take up the explosive
wage-hours bill. The vote—first
but not conclusive test of wage-hour
strength—was 322 to 73.
The vote followed brief debate on
the motion of Chairman Mary Nor
ton (Dem. N. J.), of the House La
bor Committee. The motion forced
the measure from its pigeonhole in
the unfriendly rules body to the
House floor where its backers
opened a whirlwind drive for its
passage.
