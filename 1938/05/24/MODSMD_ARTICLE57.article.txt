### 
TOKYO, May 23 (UP) â€” Strong
earthquake shocks rocked parts of
Japan's main island, Honshu, today.
They were felt as far away as Ma
nila in the Philippines and the Brit
ish Crown Colony of Hong Kong in
South China.
The first shock, registered here at
4:19 p.m., centered around the vol
canic mountain, Asama, near the
summer resort of Karuizawa, which
has been in frequent eruption during
the past two months.
Windows were smashed in many
cities on the railway between Tokyo
and Karuizawa, power lines were
down, and railway traffic disrupted
by landslides.
