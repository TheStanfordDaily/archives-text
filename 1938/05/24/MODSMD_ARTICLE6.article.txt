# Peyton Speaks On Radio Hour
## Modern Military Weapons Discussed 
### 
Picturing two armies of enemy
countries about to enter conflict,
Lieut-Col. Bernard R. Peyton, pro
fessor of military science and tactics
at Stanford, in a talk over KGO last
night, explained the manner in
which military weapons are used on
the modern battlefield. The pro
gram, which was titled, "Military
Weapons Used on the Battlefield To
day," was given on the regular Stan
ford University Radio Hour.
"The task of moving against re
sistance for soldiers armed with
nothing except small arms seems
rather difficult," says Peyton. He
continued by illustrating how this is
done, telling the purposes of differ
ent branches of the army.
"Tanks have made wonderful
progress since the English first
started their use during the World
War, and cavalry is still the most
valuable branch of the service for
detecting and locating enemy
forces.
"The Air Corps aids in battle with
four general types of airplanes: ob
servation, attack, bombardment, and
pursuit. However, the Anti-aircraft
Artillery, which has just been per
fected in recent years, will be quite
a menace to aircraft."
In concluding, Peyton said, "The
infantry has the main role of battle
and the air corps, artillery, tanks,
and cavalry are all blended in to
make one unit either of attack or
defense."
