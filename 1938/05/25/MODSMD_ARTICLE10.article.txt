Mr. Culver's far-flung activities
began during his undergraduate
years here. During his freshman
year he went with Dr. David Starr
Jordan on a Mazatlan expedition to
the west coast of Mexico—he was
later to major in and graduate in
zoology.
He was a varsity track man and
an associate editor of "The Sequoia,"
first campus student publication,
from which sprang the Daily Palo
Alto and Chaparral.
Taught in l.os Angeles
In 1902 he received a bachelor of
laws degree at Georgr Washineton

University and the next year joined
the editorial staff of the "Baltimore
American."
In 1907 he went to Los Angeles
High School as a science teacher, in
1908 to Santa Monica High School
as principal, and in 1909, back to
Los Angeles as head of the science
department, there to stay until his
return to the Farm campus. He also
was track coach at Los Angeles.
During the years here, he has been
feared by some, has awed others,
has been just the dean of men to
others. But those feelings always
have changed when the students
holding them met him, and talked to
him.
Now, at 65, he becomes emeritus
denn, and switches his activities, but
not his interests, to other fields.
In issues of the next four days,
The Daily will trace his connections
with Stanford, his views of the
Farm's future, and tell of his hob

Through those 18 years, while
class after class moved onto the

Whether they came for consulta

some troubled mission of their own,
he has made the visit the beginning
of a friendship that lasted through a
university career and into an after
