# Hank Houser Appointed Drama Head
## Stagers To Change Productions; Farm Songs To Be Plugged 
### 
Appointment of Henry Houser to
the position of dramatics manager
was announced yesterday by Clay
McDaniel, present manager.
Appointment was won after out
qualifying a group of four, includ
ing Mel Mack, Adolph Lurie, and
Bill Mitchell, who have undergone
a year's competitive training for the
position. The course included man
agerial, executive, and general
drama production work.
To Handle Gaieties
Houser will head next year's dra
matic council and will handle all
arrangements for the Gaieties,
Spring Show, and Winter Show, and
also a large number of Stager read
ings.
Plans for the 1938-39 year in
clude a continued development of
student-written one-act plays which
may be entered in Pasadena play
house contests. It is also expected
that this policy will promote a
greater quantity and higher qual
ity of plays for future spring and
winter shows. The usual type of
winter show is scheduled for al
teration.
To Plug Tunes
Plans are also being made to
broadcast parts of Stanford produc
tions. Special attention is to be de
voted to plugging the best Spring
Show and Gaieties tunes over both
local and national hook-ups and
also to arrange for recordings of
these tunes with possible publica
tion in mind.
Continuance of a "big band" poli
cy is a third feature of Houser's
program, following the recent "Is
Europe?" success.
"Stanford people know their
bands too well to be fooled by poor
music," remarked Houser, referring
to the notorious lack of Farm pa
tronage x>f poor Campus bands.
