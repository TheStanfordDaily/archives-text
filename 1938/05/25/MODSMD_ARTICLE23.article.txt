## 
### KAY JOHNSEN 
''Your managing editor insists on
a story?" inquired Professor Ham
Blichfeldt of the reporter who was
attempting for the second time tc
interview him on his retirement at
the end of this quarter after over 4(J
years' connection with Stanford's
math department.
"If it's my birth date you want to
know, you already know it —65 ypars
ago.
"No," he continued, "It's all right
for men like Bassett or Cat heart to
have write-ups when they retire—
but not for me.
Blu-hfehlt Reticent
"They have been before the pub
lic eye and people are eager to know
what they have to say, but I am only
known to a few students who take
math. They are the only ones inter
ested in what I have to say—and
they already know what I have to
say.
"A man who has been mayor of
Palo Alto and worked on committees
is qualified to express his opinions
along general lines; but I am only
qualified to express my opinions on
mathematics. And who, besides my
associates, would be interested in
these?
A Student With Wilbur
"Yes, 1 was an undergraduate at
Stanford the same time Wilbur was.
1 knew who he was, but I didn't be
come acquainted with him until
!ater. Hoover v.'as here then, too,
out I didn't know hirn either.
"I am sorry," he apologized, "that
J cannot give you a story. But, my
life has been the life of a strictly
•ientific man, and such lives are all
the same.
"Of course, I have my ideas about
the CIO "and such things, but foi
me to express them would only make
r.ie appear ridiculous—people woulc
l.e amused.
Not a Baseball Expert
"If I were an expert in baseball oi
.'• mething that people are interestec
i/ , I would be glad to give you £
story." „ ,*•.
The math secretary, who wa:
v. orking hard at a typewriter wit!
her hat on, interrupted him with:
"If you don't give her a story, sh(
tuld me before you came in that sh(
s.ould get it out of back Quads."
"Things in those Quads are lies—
I'iolish lies!" exclaimed Professoi
1 lichfeldt.
Not a Bridge Expert
"About my being an expert bridg<
[ layer—l was so raging mad whei
I read that! I play bridge abou
• nee a month.

• "When did I become interested in ;
' math? When do all men of science
become interested in their work— i
I when they are little children, or
else they never .would be men of j
science.
"Do I plan to continue with my
i work after retirement? Of course,
I all of us keep right on with our
work."
Bilchfeldt Apologizes
As the reporter left, Professor
Blichfeldt apologized for being un
; able to discuss any question—be
sides mathematics (which readers
are not interested in) —adequately j
! enough to give her a story.
As a conciliatory act, he recom- |
: mended her to "American Men of \
i Science," where she would be able |
to find the formal data of his life—- j
all that is of any interest in the life !
of the purely scientific man—and i
that, of interest only to others like- |
wise interested in science.
