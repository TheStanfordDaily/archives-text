the past few years the words
Stanford and golf have been syn
onymous here on the Pacific Coast.
Ever since Eddie Twiggs, tije little
man with the fancy clothes and un
ending collection of pipes, took over
the divot-digging sport in 1932. Stan
ford hqs been undisputed ruler of
Coast intercollegiate golf competi
tion—but its supremacy was estab
lished long before that.
In those seven years, Twiggs
coached teams have won seven
straight Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
championships. Four times they
captured the individual titles and
four times they annexed the team
and individual crowns in the same
year.
Twice, in 1932 and 1933, they
romped off with the qualifying
medal, the individual and the team
championships in the Pacific Coast
Minor Sports Carnival, an annual
meet between Coast minor sport
teams which was discontinued in
1933.
Against California, Stanford has
taken seven out of eight dual
meets. In 1934, the Cards walked
olf with the morning singles
matches, and Twiggs, wanting to
give some sophomores a little ex- .
perience, started an entirely new
team in the afternoon doubles
rounds, and lost by one point. He
hasn't forgiven him.elf yet.
All in all, Stanford has dropped
one dual meet in seven years—that
unforgettable meet in 1934. This
year the Farm frosh lost their first
dual meet in four years. Two years
ago they played a 13-13 tie with
Cal.
This year has been no exception.
The boys got off to a shaky start in
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates at
Pebble Beach as only one man, Bill
Boyd, got as far as the semi-finals,
when, in fact, they were heavily
favored to produce both finalists.
They kept their record clean in
(lie team championship, however,
by walking off with that, and have
since maintained their long-exist
ing supremacy on the links by
cleaning up in dual meets,
r PHE Cards took two dual matches
from U.C.L.A., two from U.S.C.,
one from Oklahoma and then wound
up their season by handing Califor
nia the worst lacing in Big Match
history, 24'> to 2Twiggs claims
he could have shut-out the Bears,
but he chose, instead, to give some
prospective sophomores a little ex
perience—will he never learn?
The experience for the sophomores
was worth more than rubbing it into
those Bears too heavily, anyhow.
What happened to the second Big
Match? Well, Cal, for unknown
reasons, just didn't show up at the
first tee.
Having cleaned up on every
thing on the Coast this year,
Twiggs will take a six-man team
to Louisville after finals for a
fling at the toughest competition
in the country in the National
Intercollegiates.
His team of Art Doering, Bill Boyd,
Jack Wallace, Brown Cannon, A1
Hyman, and Jimmy Rea isn't stud
ded with the individual stars of
seasons past, but Twiggs readily ad
mits it's the best-balanced and best
all-around team he has coached.
Lacking are the names of Lawson
Little, "Spec" Stewart, Stewart
Hawley, Bob Thompson, Don Ed
wards. Charlie Seaver and others,
but this year's crop is the best as a
team, according to Twiggs, and
should come back with the National
Intercollegiate team title and the
individual champion.

Having cleaned up on every
thing on the Coast this year,
Twiggs will take a six-man team

in the country in the National
Intercollegiates.
His team of Art Doering, Bill Boyd,
Jack Wallace, Brown Cannon, A1
Hyman, and Jimmy Rea isn't stud
ded with the individual stars of
seasons past, but Twiggs readily ad
mits it's the best-balanced and best
all-around team he has coached.

Little, "Spec" Stewart, Stewart
Hawley, Bob Thompson, Don Ed

Intercollegiate team title and the
individual champion.

the past few years the words
Stanford and golf have been syn
onymous here on the Pacific Coast.
Ever since Eddie Twiggs, tije little
man with the fancy clothes and un
ending collection of pipes, took over
the divot-digging sport in 1932. Stan
ford hqs been undisputed ruler of
Coast intercollegiate golf competi
tion—but its supremacy was estab
lished long before that.
In those seven years, Twiggs
coached teams have won seven
straight Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
championships. Four times they
captured the individual titles and
four times they annexed the team
and individual crowns in the same
year.
Twice, in 1932 and 1933, they
romped off with the qualifying
medal, the individual and the team
championships in the Pacific Coast
Minor Sports Carnival, an annual
meet between Coast minor sport
teams which was discontinued in
1933.
Against California, Stanford has
taken seven out of eight dual
meets. In 1934, the Cards walked
olf with the morning singles
matches, and Twiggs, wanting to
give some sophomores a little ex- .
perience, started an entirely new
team in the afternoon doubles
rounds, and lost by one point. He
hasn't forgiven him.elf yet.
All in all, Stanford has dropped
one dual meet in seven years—that
unforgettable meet in 1934. This
year the Farm frosh lost their first
dual meet in four years. Two years
ago they played a 13-13 tie with
Cal.
This year has been no exception.
The boys got off to a shaky start in
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates at
Pebble Beach as only one man, Bill
Boyd, got as far as the semi-finals,
when, in fact, they were heavily
favored to produce both finalists.
They kept their record clean in
(lie team championship, however,
by walking off with that, and have
since maintained their long-exist
ing supremacy on the links by
cleaning up in dual meets,
