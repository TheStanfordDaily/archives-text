# 'Biscuit-'Admiral Race Called Off

### 
NEW YORK, May 24 (UP).—The
horse-race of the century — the
$100,000 match between War Ad
miral and Seabiscuit scheduled for
D( coration Day—was cancelled to
day due to Seabiscuit's failure to
round into form.
Howard explained that Seabiscuit,
leading money winner and handi
cap champion of 1937, had been
having leg trouble, retarding his
training progress. He was bitterly
disappointed at being forced to
withdraw his horse, but said he felt
it his duty to the public.
