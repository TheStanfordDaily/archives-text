# Juniors, Sophs Tie in Initial Water Polo Tilt
## First of Interclass Series Ends With Overtime Periods 
### 
In a highly spirited game that
made the waters of Encina Pool fair
iy sizzle, sophomore and junior wa
ter polo teams called it quits with a
4-4 tie after four overtime periods
yesterday afternoon in the first of
the 1938 interclass series.
Although it is customary to con
tinue overtimes until the game is
won, 14 worn corpses barely float
ing after unusually long playing
time agreed that the final period
should be postponed indefinitely. It
will not be played until it is decided
whether it will be a determining
factor in the final results of the in
terclass series.
Plate Heads Sophs
Bob Plate captained the sopho
mores from the centerback position,
with Dick Hoover and Bob Savage
at guards. Bill Bleeker, Jack Black
burn, and Jack Reade held down
forward spots for the Class of '40,
and Frank Dowling played goal
guard.
Captain John Lamb led the jun
iors as forward with Jack Wilson
and John Brahtz in the other for
ward spots. Guards for the juniors
were Harvey Rothschild, Bill Hatch,
and John Shailenberger. Don
Towne and Dick Lyons alternated
at goalie.
Half Ends in Tie
When the second half ended with
a 2-2 tie, the pool was practically
bare. Three juniors and two sopho
mores had been ordered from the
pool for willful fouls. Goals by both
teams made it 3-3 at the end of the
first overtime period.
The score became 4-4 in the third
overtime, with no goals in the sec
ond and fourth.
