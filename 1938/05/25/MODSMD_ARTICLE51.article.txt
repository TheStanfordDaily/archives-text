# Get Co-ordinated

### 
DEVELOPING slowly but surely up the ranks
of Leadership Institute, Daily comment and
unofficial bull-sessions, the idea which may be
the making of the new card-file system —crea-
tion of a co-ordinator of activities —hit Ex Com
mittee last night. Presented by Lyle Cook, the
plan would put a man at the top of the activi
ties heap to keep a watchful eye on the files, on
committee appointments, and on personnel of
activity groups.
The boys whose mothers were frightened by
a gravy-boat should be satisfied with the plan.
The co-ordinator would be an adviser rather
than a dictator. He will make suggestions to
committee leaders for appointments, review
final choices, and advise Ex Committee as a
last resort if the democratic machine is slowing
down.
That such a position is needed can hardly
be questioned. The campus activity set-up has
become a sprawling thing, with only top com
mittees, such as Cardinals, important enough
lo be reviewed by the campus as a whole.
Minor committees soon become standing crews,
with the usual team of pretty freshmen women
presenting their faces behind every committee
booth.
With democracy harrying conscientious lead
ers at every step, the card-file system has
.seemed the best answer to the problem of lim
ited opportunity. But any insurance that the
system will be used has been lacking. Now,
lhe co-ordinator will be the Simon Legree to
ntand over sluggish committee heads, keep
them in line with the democratic policy.
And as a double check on the co-ordinator
will be Ex Committee itself. It need never take
his advice. But the fact that there will be ad
vice, that the administrative body will be in
close contact with the vast hive of committee
men under its jurisdiction will be enough in it
self to give the plan real merit.
The co-ordinator may not be the beacon
light pointing to a perfect democratic system.
But at least he will make the card-file system
work. And with the files being used, Stanford
can begin to settle back and quit worrying
about keeping all its interested wards occu
pied. The files can spread jobs; and the co
ordinator can be the knife to spread them thin
and wide.—J. S.
