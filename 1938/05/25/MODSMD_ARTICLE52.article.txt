# Bridging the Gap
## 
### 
T BAT for the third time, with two hits to its
-la. credit, Student Leadership Institute meets
tonight to hit specific problems in student gov
ernment. After biting hard on the idealistic
aims of Stanford's democracy, and chewing
over some of the elementary processes of any
administrative system, new and old group lead
ers will join to ask what and why about them
selves.
Apparently the meeting does little that the
individual organizations could not do for them
selves. It should be taken for granted that the
personnel of a given committee, incumbent and
future, should meet at least once before the old
pass on and the new take over. Something of
the idea applies to Ex Committee, where mem
bers-to-be are expected to attend meetings be
fore they themselves occupy chairs at the long
table.
But this only half answers the problem of
achieving complete continuity between suc
ceeding groups. If new members can actu
ally make head-or-tail out of an average Ex
Committee meeting, can find out exactly what
they are expected to know and to do, they are
indeed wise.
Leadership Institute tonight will go Ex Com
mittee s plan one better. Old and new com
mittee men will meet for the specific purpose
of giving some continuity to the group. Some
will discuss duties special to their committees;
some will consider ways and means to handle
specific cases which are encountered in a year's
work. But above all, they will have the chance
to stop, look, find out where they are going.
Old members can pass on valuable experience.
New members can jog the committee tenta

tively to find out if the groove it is in is really
a rut.
It may not seem like much. But a tost (tip
into the student body pond takes oil the Â»<y
shock of the initial fall plunge into activity.
