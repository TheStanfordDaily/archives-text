# Pawn Jumps Kings
## 
### 
THE sports editor tells me that a defense of
Louis Zamperini, as was presented in this
column yesterday, is all very fine. But, he
says, the stink couldn't have happened if Zam
perini were an athlete who had the interests of
amateur sport at heart.
All I could say in reply to that would be
reiteration of my position. Athletes no longer
control amateur sports; they are controlled by
newspapers through their command of public
opinion, by administrators who often run them
for their own gain.
The athlete himself often is only a pawn in
the game. Sometimes he rebels and asks for
part of the profits himself. Sometimes he is
smart and gets away with his demand; other
teams asked for a Rose Bowl cut before Pitts
burgh did, and got away with it.
Sometimes he misjudges, as Zamperini did,
and doesn't get away with it. Unless avoiding
discovery is necessary for ethical justification,
either is equally guilty.
But, guilty or not, there always will be at
tempts, some of them successful, so long as
there is money to be made out of amateur
sports.
