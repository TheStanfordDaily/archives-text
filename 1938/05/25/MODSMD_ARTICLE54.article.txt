# BULL SESSION
## AMENDMENT 
### 
r wheels of the gods and Ex Committee grind
exceedingly slow, but they have finally produced
a legislative brain-child which should do much to fur
ther the forms of Stanford democracy, whatever it
does for the spirit.
It is embodied in the proposed amendment to the
Constitution of the Associated Students, and it has to
do with the right of the student body to suggest,
vote upon, confirm or reject amendments to the by
laws and charters of the Constitution.
Changes may be initiated by Ex Committee itself,
with a three-quarters vote, after which they will be
placed in effect automatically, a petition carrying 150
names has been presented to the Committee asking
that they be submitted to the student body.
Or they may be initiated by direct petition from the
student body, in which case they will either be ap
proved by a similar three-quarters vote of Ex Com
mittee within 15 days, or be submitted to the student
body at large for vote.
What actual effect this wijl have upon the function
ing of student government on the Farm remains a
question; but its significance as an indication that Ex
Committee is alive to what constitutes legal democracy
is fairly obvious.
If the student body approves the amendment when
it goes to the polls May 31, the Farm will have set up
for it all the machinery it needs to make its collective
will known to Ex Committee. It will be able to guide
a little more directly, if it wishes to, the deliberations
of a body which occasionally—but only occasionally—
needs a certain amount of overseeing by those it
governs.
It may be that the initiative will not be vised with
any great frequency; it may not be used at all. But it
will be there, in case someone does want to use it. The
finishing touch will have to be put to the legal struc
ture of the A.S.S.U. Constitution. And Farm student
government, perhaps the most independent in the
country, will have proved by its own action that it is
worthy of the confidence the Administration places
in it.—Allen Drury.
