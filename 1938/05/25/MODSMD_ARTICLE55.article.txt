# GOIN' MY WAY

VOU know how it has been lately, a lot of people
screaming about swinging the classics and such,
so we thought we ought to inform most of the general
public about a trend that seems to be gathering mo
mentum.
For the nonce, we speak of the bands that are
swinging military band music. Yes, that's what we
mean. Not long ago on one of the Saturday Swing
Sessions, that originated from the West Coast, Frankie
Trombar swung out on a ditty wit which we kept step
through most of high school called "Stars and Stripes
Forever." You've probably heard of its author, John
Phillip Sousa.
And then the other night we heard Buddy Rogers,
who is stomping from the Palomar, with an interpre
tation of another military number in swing tempo, "The
American Patrol."
This Buddy Rogers outfit interests us for several
reasons. Not long ago he was closely connected with
the vapid style of "My Buddy," which he still uses as
a theme song, and generally, with icky stuff. Now,
however, he has come to the fore with a swing band
that has plenty. His saxes are actually in tune, and
they even play together, something no S. F. band has
been able to accomplish since Red Norvo left the
Frantic.
Unfortunately, we won't be able to hear his inter
pretation recorded, because it is much too long, even
for a 12-inch record, but we believe that anyone inter
ested will find a lot to listen to in the Rogers broad
casts.

jVOW. since we feel in a prophetic mood, we would
like to say that we think that the Duke's new tune,
not only will top the hit parade, but will also be a
swing classic.
"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart," is the name of
the tune, and we believe that it has the most sock
since "Christopher Columbus" hit the air listeners.
As far as we know, there have been only two re
cordings of the tune, Benny Goodman's on Victor
25840, and Duke Ellington's on Brunswick 8108. The
best part about this tune is that it lends itself to a num
ber of versions. The Duke's record is really black,
and Goodman's is more on the white side, as has been
generally indicated by his recent actions.
Frankly, this is the best thing that has come to our
attention for many moons, and we hope that the Duke
continues to write similar tunes that fall in the same
groove. Pat McGuirk.
