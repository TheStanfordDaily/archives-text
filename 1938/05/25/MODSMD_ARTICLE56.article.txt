# Chinese Film Praised For Good Acting
## 
### 
"SONG OF CHINA," a Chinese
film released through the United
Photoplay Service, presented last
night in the Memorial Theater as
a feature of the Tuesday Lecture
Series.

Though lacking in plot and con
tinuity, "Song of China,' Chinese
film presented here last night, was,
because of its moving background
of Chinese life and because of the
sincerity of its Chinese actors a de
cided success.
All-Chinese Cast
The tale of a Chinese father's love
for four generations of his family
was sympathetically portrayed by

the all - Chinese
cast, which show
ed a remarkable
depth and under
standing.
The theme was
the pathetic story
of a father who
saw his peace and
happiness threat
ened when West
ern civilization

broke down the traditions and cus
toms of his beloved China.
Perhaps the most interesting fea
ture of this picture was the Chi
nese music, which formed the back
ground of the film. Much of the
emotional effect produced by the
film was due to the smooth blend
ing of action with the music.
The music in this film was the
best example of skillful direction
that has come our way in a long
time. We recommend that special
attention be paid in the future to
foreign films, and obscure musical
directors, such as the Chinese Wei
Ching-Lo, who wrote and directed
the music for this picture.
Amusing Subtitles
English translations of the Chi
nese subtitles amused an unusually
large and attentive audience and
added to the decidedly appealing
quality of "Song of China."
Picturesque scenes of Chinese
life were an important element in
the picture, and made a fascination
background for the development of
the story.
Something should be said here of
the excellent photography of this
production. Best shot was of a
room full of Chinese orphans, wash
ing cars and necks in preparation
for a visit from important officials.
