Letter to Kerr
Text of the letter to Ed Kerr fol
lows:
"This letter will soon be hurrying
homeward from the land of heather,
carrying my warm congratulations
to you and the members of the de
bate squad, and your faculty advis
ers, upon the completion of an out
standing year in the history of
Stanford.
Congratulations
"As debate manager, your work
matches the extensive programs of
Managers Gros and Lindblom, and
.the response of the debate squad
has been in terms of unquestioned
victory. No one will begrudge my

special mention of Gerald Marcus,
who came to Stanford as an eager
freshman, and who leaves the Uni
versity as a medalist, destined to ac
complish even greater things in the
next half-century; for that is the
Stanford Debating Tradition.
''Bannister and Trautman left the
squad to win the famous Ames Cup
at Harvard; Littler, McClintock,
and others have become leaders in
professional and political life; there
is room for all Stanford debaters
who are willing to work and who
realize that speaking ability is inci
dental to the full man."
