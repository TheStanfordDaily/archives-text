# Toyon Dance Bids Almost Sold Out
## 
### 
Although tickets to the Toyon
dance scheduled for this Friday
night, are definitely limited in num
bert, a few may be left, and they
will be sold at the door Friday, ac
cording to Vincent Lemmon, chair
man. Since the dance is going to
be semi-formal, women will wear
spring formals, and the men will
wear summer sports clothes.
The few remaining tickets will be
sold, until Friday night, at the A.S.
S.U. office, or may be bought from
committee members Dan Cameron,
Jim Barnum, Bill Rosenfeld, Bob
Curtis, and Mike Gudman, as well
as from Lemmon.
Noel Thomas' 11-piece orchestra
will provide the music for the dance.
