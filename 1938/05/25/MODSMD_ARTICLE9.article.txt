# Activity File Coordinator Suggested
## Excom Hears Plan To Appoint Advisor To Committee Heads 
### 
Suggestion that an activities co
ordinator be appointed to conduct
the recently organized card file was
presented to Ex Committee last
night by Lyle Cook.
Cook's plan would placc the co
ordinator in an advisory position to
Ex Committee and chairmen of
committees.
He suggested that the advisor, who
would be placed on salary "because
of the great amount of work con
nected with the job," should keep up
the card file, and, when a committee
chairman makes appointments he
should go over the list to determine
if they were satisfactory.
Dean Suggests
In the event that the co-ordin
ator felt improper appointments
were made, Cook said, he could ad
vise both the chairman and Ex
Committee.
Cook, mentioning that he had con
ferred with Dean Mary Yost on the
plan, said she had made the follow
ing suggestion:
That not only should committee
chairmen file reports on the work
of their committeemen, but that the
committee members should file re
ports on the work of the chairmen.
Married Men
Married Men's Club came to bat
again on its drive to obtain financial
support from Ex Committee, and for
a second time, the committee voted
against making an appropriation.
A representative of the club said
the group is valuable as a means of
building loyalty to Stanford among
older graduates, who have no other
means of social contact on the cam
pus than through the club. The
delegate pointed out some of the
older graduates feel they cannot
participate in student dances, par
ties, and other functions, and would
prefer some quieter social activity.
Fees May Be Used
Concensus on Ex Committee was
that the appropriation of the $100
requested was not troublesome,
since the money is available, but
that it would set a precedent en
abling any or all other small groups
to demand A.S.S.U. support.
Business Manager Chuck Fontius
suggested some of the community
fees collected during summer quar
ter could be used during that period
to coordinate social activities of both
graduates and undergraduates, but
that would be the only "legitimate"
way to appropriate funds.
Resignation of Dave Ryus as
chairman of Pre-Registration Com
mittee was announced to Excom,
although no action was taken.
Pat Bosqui was appointed head of
Lecture Series for next year, with
Walt Stoessel as aide.
Gerry Marcus appeared to urge
1 again appointment of a permanent
peace council to coordinate peace
activities on the campus. He said
the present system of having a
Peace Day chairman arbitrarily ap
pointed by Excom causes lack of
continuity, makes it difficult to ar
range a program, or to get members
of the committee to agree on need
of Peace Day.
His idea would be to have mem
bers appointed from various activi
ties interested in peace, they to
choose their own chairman.
Editor Okayed
Appointment of Dick Stepp as
Daily business manager, Henry
Houser as dramatics manager, and
election of Jim Stone as Daily editor
were okayed.
Excom also approved granting oJ
awards for frosh golf to George
Bradley, Arthur Gore, L. B. Hnr
bour Jr., Don Haslett, William Hen
ley, Henry Hinds, Hal M. Stone
and Sheridan Welch.
