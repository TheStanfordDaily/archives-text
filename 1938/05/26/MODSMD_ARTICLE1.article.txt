### BILL MILLIS 
r rHE CAULDRON of the Tennes- I
see Valley Authority controversy, i
which has been simmering since a
joint congressional investigation was
voted several weeks ago, began to
boil and bubble yesterday when Dr.
Arthur E. Morgan, ousted TVA di
rector, declared that the Roosevelt
Administration's vast electrical pow
er, flood prevention, and land rec
lamation project has been made sub
servient to political interests through
"collusion, conspiracy, and misman
agement."
Speaking at the first hearing of
(lie Senate-House committee, Dr.
Morgan accused present TVA di
rectors David Lilienthal and liar
court A. Morgan with a consistent
policy of "politics" and "misrep
resentation," but absolved them of
all charges of graft.
The New Deal's vital "yardstick"
theory of determining private
power rate:-' was termed basically
unsound and designed to conceal a
"haphazard and wasteful" distri
bution system, he also charged.

The TVA board majority were ac
cused of failing to give 'honest ad
ministration of a great public trust,"
and were particularly criticized for
assertedly attempting to "make
thiugs easy" for Sen. George L.
Berry (D., Tenn.) when he unsuc
cessfully filed $5,000,000 marble
claims against the authority.
Involved in the bickering, first
of all, is a large amount of per
sonal recriminations among Dr.
Morgan and the other directors.
But behind that are basic differ
ences over the immediate practices
and future aims of the TVA, and
whether it should not only com
pete with hut should ultimately
absorb privately operated utilities
in the Middle South.

jpRANCE, which has been keeping
mum and following Britain's lead
in the involved diplomatic maneuv
ers over Czechoslovakia, yesterday
"advised" her isolated Czech allies
to accede to Adolf Hitler's first de
mand and withdraw all military re
inforcements in the Sudeten areas
along the German frontier.
The Paris proposals, authorized
by London, were that Premier Milan
Hodza should "go to the limit" in
negotiating with the Nazi-dominated
Sudeten Germans.
Meantime, Prague reports were
that because of official German
protests over "hostile" frontier in
cidents, all Czech military planes
have been ordered to patrol no
closer than three miles "to any
foreign border."
The order evinces Czechoslo
vaks' desire to avoid any "inad
verdent incidents," the govern
ment said.
