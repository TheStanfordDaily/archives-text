# Fashion Expert To Administrator: Job of Culver
## 
### HARRY SHELDON 
From fashion expert to stern but
friendly, administrator are about the
outside limits to any man's job, but
such has been the position of retir
ing Dean of Men, George B. Culver
in his 17 years at Stanford watching
the changes in student activity and
government.
At one time, noting a significant
ti'end, he made his report to the
President sound like the latest page
from Esquire, by observing, "Hats
seem to be a more or less unnec- j
essary covering for acadcmic life."
This was in regard to the dispo- t
sition of clothing to needy students j
during 1930-31, the long, lean years j
following the disappearance of the ;
tired young man with a cocktail |
shaker, and his replacement by a j
more earnest, sober intellectual.
Wandering Hat
The next year, and still reading
like the latest style-prediction, he '
says, "We were also able to dispose 1
of one hat, which equals the record i
of last year. The hat is now, I be
lieve, somewhere in the Orient!"
Since then, no further records of
the one, lone hat have appeared in
the annual report, and possibly all
administrative htjpe for its present
existence has been shattered by the i
late news of conflict in the Far ;
East.
At a more serious extreme, Dean ;
Culver has watched and promoted
and fostered new student activities
I and projects and has been the abol
ishmcnt of many of the more dc
| structive "hang-over" traditions
Jfrom pre-War and pre-depression

days.
Of the most important influences,
which Dean Culver has been instru
mental in promoting, probably one
of the greatest was realized on
May 23, 1921. when the Academic
Council passed a ruling officially rec
ognizing the Honor System. I
The nine rules, which provide for
"responsibility for honesty in the
conduct of examination to be as
sumed by the students of the uni
versity." were inaugurated during
his first year after 1700 out of 3,439
registered students signed individual

cards asking for its recognition.
Dean Culver's part in the admin
istration of the system has been one
ol supervision, at times commending
student control, at other times voic
ing friendly warnings as to laxity.
By 192fÂ», the Honor System had
become a definite, but not routine,
part of Stanford Spirit. In 1934-
35 there were only 13 cases, involv
ing 19 men. before Men's Council.
Only part of these were for viola
tion of the code.
Judging from the language of
Dean Culver'- reports over pc-

I riod of years, possibly the most
J complex problem faced by his office
I has been that of fraternity finances.
Large debts no longer bother the
campus houses as in former years,
I partially because of accounting and
! supervisory aid from the Dean of
| Men's office, and more probably be
| cause of Mr. Culver's promotion of
| a Co-operative Purchasing Com-
I missary, which was established in
I 1926.
I To promote the traditional aid of
Farm friendliness, Dean Culver has
always favored the death of "Rough"
; tradition.
First of the many hazing days to
igo was the Sophomore-Freshman
Baseball fight in 1921, followed by
"Rough Day" in 1924.
The "Encina Raid" in 1931 and
"Rat Racing," traditional fall quar
ter fight between new and old resi
dents of Sequoia, in 1933 died their
natural deaths.
'Back-to-Farm'
In the latter year. Dean Culver
inaugurated, with the help of stu
dent co-operation, a "Back-to-the-
Farin" movement for student affairs.
Also in 1933 fraternity "hell week"
| assumed its more dignified and in
j tellectual title of "pre-initiation pe
| riod," and some of the men's fra
i ternities entirely abolished such
j activity.
During the last year Dean Culver
has seen the success of his office's
1 administrative work carried out in
' the activity of "pre-reg" week. And
he has definitely cultivated an ex
tension of student participation in
debating aetivitv
