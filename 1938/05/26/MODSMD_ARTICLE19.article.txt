# Leaders Plan Men's Advisory
## Axe Society May Fill Conference Need 
### 
Suggestions for a men's confer
ence, equivalent to Women's Con
ference, were discussed at Leader
ship Institute last night by the joint
meeting of Ex Committee and
Cardinals.
"We decided that Axe Society
should and could fill this need, said
Encina Sponsor Phil Klauber, "es
pecially since Dean John Bunn is a
member of the Society and could
directly contact the organization, and
since Axe Society is representative
of many campus men's groups."
How to Interest Frosh
The question of how to get fresh
men interested in activities and
have new Ex Committee members
better prepared to vote with under
standing on problems facing va
rious campus organizations were
also brought up.
Eliminating the usual large meet
ing, Leadership Institute last night
was composed of small round tables
representative of various campus
groups as Women's and Men s
| Councils, sorority presidents, Toyon
j and Branner presidents, W.A.A..
I Y.W.C.A., and sponsors-Roble and
Encina, Lagunita and Union.
Leaders Split
"Most of those leaders who at
< tended split up where they pleased,
said Klauber, "that is, except the
sponsors who stayed in a prettj
compact group. - '
The sorority presidents, meeting
under the leadership of Gretcher
Ahlswede, especially stressed the
\ problem of scholarship, exchanging
j various plans that have been carriec
| out towards a betterment of this sit
uation.
