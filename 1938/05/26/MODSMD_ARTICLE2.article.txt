# Cellar Plate To Continue In Summer
## Union Board Votes To Sustain Dividend Dinner Despite Loss 
### 
Dividend dinner, the Cellar's low
price meal inaugurated last winter,
will be continued during summer
quarter, the Union Board of Gov
ernors decided yesterday.
Though the 50-cent dinner and
35-cent luncheon meals are being
served at a loss, Christine Ricker,
Union Directress reported, the Board
agreed that the policy of serving
one low price large portion dish for
regular Cellar eaters should be con
tinued.
Daily Instigates
The Dividend meals were put on
the menu in January of this year in
response to a discussion in The
Daily of Union profits and prices.
At that time, Miss Ricker pre
dicted a loss would be sustained.
However, the Board decided that a
meal should be given to those not
able to eat with living groups, at
living group prices.
Loss Estimated
The loss, it was estimated, possibly
would put the Cellar about $2000 in
the red for the present year. Loss,
it was said, was about six cents per
plate served. Last year, the Cellar
showed a profit of over $32,000.
Other Union units, including the
dining room, cigar store, Encina
store, ice cream plant, Old Union
dormitory, and income from fees,
brought total profits up approxi
mately $34,000.
Union To Close
The Union will be closed, the
Board also decided, from Septem
ber 6 to 18, during the period be
tween the end of summer quarter
and the beginning of the regular
school year.
Money was appropriated by the
Board to replace cash registers and
adding machines now in use. They
will cost approximately $1700, the
I Board was told.
