# Johansen Talks On Stagecraft
## Methods Discussed At Luncheon Club 
### 
Past technics, present methods and
tendencies, and probable future de
velopments in stagecraft and set de
sign were discussed informally be
fore the Luncheon Club yesterday
noon by Waldemar Johansen of the
Stanford Division of Speech and
Drama.
Johansen, the set designer of all
this year's division productions,
feels that Stanford's Memorial The
ater is not only the largest school
playhouse in the country, but per
haps the best able to take advantage
of modem backstage developments.
"The stage designing of most Am
erican theaters today is still made
up of the traditional back-drops; but
this is only because in most of these
theaters it would be physically im
possible to employ the modern tech
nic.
"fn the newer theaters, of which
ours is a fine example, these have
been abandoned and the "wagon
stage" in which the whole set is
rolled on and off of the stage for
each scene is being employed."
Although he felt that the "revolv
ing" stage was very effective in
particular plays, Stanford's set-de
signer felt that the new "motorized"
//agon-sets were in the majority of
cases the best.
