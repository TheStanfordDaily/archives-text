# Senior Ball Ducat Sale Opens Today
## Bids Limited to 350 Committee Promises "Big Name Band" 
### 
For seniors only!
This may sound like a too-good
to-be-true publicity slogan to in
credulous men and women of '38,
but it is nevertheless the absolute
dictum of Ed Barnett, Senior Ball
chairman.
Bids to the Ball, which go on sale
this morning at the A.S.S.U. office,
have been limited to 350, at $8.50
apiece. Purpose of this restriction
is to avoid overcrowding at the dance
which will be held in the Toyon Hall
lobby on June 17 from 10 to 4
o'clock.
"Big Name" Band
Orchestra for the dance, which
will be strictly formal, will be an
nounced by the beginning of next
week according to Barnett, who says
that there will definitely be a "big
name" band providing the music.
Breakfast will be served in the
Branner Hall dining room from 1
to 3:30 o'clock so that all appetites
may be well appeased. The menu
will be decided upon and announced
before The Daily stops publication
next Tuesday, according to Barnett.
Special programs have been or
dered in the shape of portrait fold
ers. A camera will be set up at the
dance so that all couples may have
their pictux - es taken free.
Photographs Available
These photographs will be avail
able Saturday from 4 to 6 o'clock
and Sunday morning at the Camera
Shop in Palo Alto. In addition to
these folders, Barnett has arranged
for the distribution of other favors.
Decorations will be extravagantly
simple. The motif—a carefully
worked out floral theme.
Working on the committee with
Barnett are Franklyn Clerk, Edward
Keasbey Jr., Florence McCormack,
Barbara Paine. Dick Riddell, Bob
Underwood, and Boyd White.

again in the A.S.S.U. office where
all graduating seniors are asked by
President Bob Mcßoskey to sign it.

served on the scroll for members of
the Senior Executive Committee,
class officers, and other committee
heads. The scroll is in charge of
Dave Hooker.
