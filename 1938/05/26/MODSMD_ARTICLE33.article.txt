### I HATE By Ben Billings 
I hate to see things end
I've always been that way
I hate to see the river bend
I dread the close of day.
I hate to see the stars fade out
To greet the rising sun
I hate the alarm clock's shout
Which says my dreams are done.
I've never liked a theme song
Or the last drop of my glass
I hate to hear a friend's "so-long"
Why, in bridge, I hate to pass.
So I know I'll hate to graduate
No matter where I'll ever be
I'll regret the date it was my fate
To get that damned A.B.
I hate to see things end
I've always been that way
I hate to see the river bend
I dread the close of day.
I hate to see the stars fade out
To greet the rising sun
I hate the alarm clock's shout
Which says my dreams are done.
I've never liked a theme song
Or the last drop of my glass
I hate to hear a friend's "so-long"
Why, in bridge, I hate to pass.
So I know I'll hate to graduate
No matter where I'll ever be
I'll regret the date it was my fate
To get that damned A.B.
I hate to see things end
I've always been that way
I hate to see the river bend
I dread the close of day.
I hate to see the stars fade out
To greet the rising sun
