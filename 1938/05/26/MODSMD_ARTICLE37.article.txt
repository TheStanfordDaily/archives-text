that it makes a lot of differ
ence, but The Daily is going to
have a sports editor next fall, even
though it didn't announce such yes
terday along with the other promo
tions.
John Shallenberger, the old Phi
Delt grinder of axes exceedingly
line, was selected by the editorial
board. Shallenberger had a hard
time convincing the brothers yes
terday, he said, because it wasn't in
The Daily. That ought to show
that The Daily means something to
somebody.
« * *
r PIIE appointment of Shallenberger
reminds that after today there
will be just three more issues of
The Daily for Volume 93. It will be
able to follow the track team
through the Coast Conference meet,
something that couldn't be done last
year, but from then on the team's
activities will be published in the
bay region papers for Stanford's
readers. Included in the meets
scheduled for the remainder of the
year are the P.C.C.-Big Ten dual
affair in Illinois, the N.C.A.A. in
Minneapolis, and possible unattached
competition in the A.A.U. national
outdoors championships. In this
latter it is probable that Ray Malott
who won the 400 meters last c.
mer, will defend his title.
Whether there will be any other
entries is highly problematical. Last
year Jack Weiershauser also en
tered.
Among other things The Daily
won't be able to cover this vol
ume will be the tour of the golf
team to the nationals at Louis
ville, Kentucky. Coach Eddie
Twiggs claims to have the strong
est team in the history of Stanford
golf, even though it doesn't con
tain an individual star the likes
of Lawson Little. With this team
he counts on winning the national
team title, which would be a sig
nificant victory. Golf is one of
the most popular games in the
nation—virtually all the fans are
players, which isn't true of base
ball or football or other spectator
sports.
And then there will be the finale
of spring football practice, which
will have a lot of meaning to a lot
of fans. Stanford will have the po
tential champion of the Coast in
next year's squad, despUe what is
said about U.S.C. If Tiny Thorn
hill solves the problem that con
fronts him in the middle of the line,
the "backfield that's better than the
Vowing Sophs were" ought to be
able to mow 'em down. The final
game of spring practice will show to
a certain extent just how formidable
the tackles and guards are going to
be. That extent" refers to
the fact that Zagar and Andersen,
first string tackles, will be out for
track, as will Bill Braheny, a threat
for first string guard. Chick Orme,
who has just had an operation on
his knee, won't appear, but he's a
possibility in the coaching staff's
minds for first string guard.

other things, that favor
able schedule for next fall looks
like this, proceeding by week with
out any vacancies from October 1:
Santa Clara here, Washington State
here, Oregon here, U.S.C. here,
U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles, Washing
ton here, Oregon State at Corvallis,
Cal at Berkeley, and Dartmouth
here.
Three games away from home,
one of them at Berkeley, gives
the Cards the best schedule on
tbe Coast, looking at it from the
conference title angle. The three
contests away from home don't
figure to be the toughest on the
schedule, either. Washington,
Oregon, and U.S.C., on paper the
toughest on the conference sked,
must come to the Indians.
That Dartmouth game has already
been boomed as "the 1939 Rose
Bowl game." When Thornhill was
in New York last winter, at the Co
lumbia game, the newshawks joshed
him about the fact that Stanford
might have the strongest team on
the Coast and Dartmouth would be
in all likelihood the new champion
of the East.
What would be something to see
would be a Stanford-Dartmouth 0-0
tie November 26, and then a playoff
in the Rose Bowl. A natural, no
less.—Peterson.
