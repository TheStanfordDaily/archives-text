Lockwood Predicts
Commenting on the final match,
Coach Sherm Lockwood said, "With
both Underwood and Lynch hi top
Â»form, the match should produce
some really first class tennis, and
we hope that a good part of the
student body will turn out."
Underwood is a senior and Lynch
a last term grad student, and the
possibility of another meeting of
the two on the Farm courts is re
mote.
Lynch's Record
While a member of the Indian ag
gregation last year, Lynch turned in
some fine victories, including a
three-set win over Julius Heldman
of U.C.L.A. In addition, last sum
mer he twice upset Fumaturo Na
kano, No. 2 man on the Japanese
Davis Cup team, in Pacific Coast
tourneys.
After establishing himself as one
of the nation's outstanding young
players by gaining the nineteenth
spot in the national men's ranking
two summers ago. Underwood went
on to win several of the top doubles
events on the Coast, with Bob Pom
mel* his partner.
Finalists Improved
Neither of the finalists had been
playing his best at the start of the
current tourney, but comparative
scores have shown that both Under
wood and Lynch have improved con
siderably since last fall.
The Card captain has dropped but
one set in advancing to the finals,
that to Bob Low in the semis. Un
derwood, however, was never in
danger of dropping the engagement,
for after the match had been squared
at a set apiece, he went on to take
the third and fourth at 6-3, 6-2.
