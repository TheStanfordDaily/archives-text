# P.C.C. Meet Looms As Wide Open Battle
## 
### 
With the Southern California
Trojans crippled by the loss of their
great sophomore distance man,
Louis Zamperini, the Pacific Coast
Conference track meet, scheduled
for Saturday at 2:05 o'clock at Ed
wards Field in Berkeley, looms now
as a wide open battle.
Zamperini was a cinch for at least
nine points for the Trojans, and
those nine points were the approxi
mate margin by which most experts
picked the Trojans to win the meet,
which is now thrown into a tri-way
tussle between Troy, California, and
Washington State.
Orr Leads Cougars
Last Saturday, Washington State
annexed the northern division crown
by outscoring Washington, 48V->-40.
Other scorers were: Oregon, 36;
Idaho, 21; Oregon State, 11; and
Montana, BVi>.
Leading the Cougars was Lee Orr,
powerfully built sprinter, who rep
resented Canada in the 1936 Olym
pic Games. Orr turned in three
sensational victories in the northern
division meet when he won the 100
in 9.5, the 220 in 20.9 and the low
hurdles in 23.7. In all three races,
he nosed out Mack Robinson, Ore
gon's burly Negro ace, who, like Orr,
son picked up a fourth second place
son picked up a fourth second place,
in the broad jump.
In last year's P.C.C. meet, Orr won
the 220 in 21.2 and placed second in

the century..
Other Northwest aces are George j
Varoff, Oregon's 14-foot pole vault
er; Art Morgan. Washington hurd- <
ler, who especially scintillates in I
the highs, in which he has done 14.4; i
Don' Johnson, Idaho's star weight
man, who could possibly win the
javelin, discus, and shot; Bill Van
dermay, who tied for first in the :
high jump last year; and Wayne I
Gitchell, Montana two-miler, who \
snagged first place last week in 9:38. I
Entries Unlimited
This is the first year that entries
will be unlimited. Previously each
school was allowed only 15 competi- j
tors. The ruling lifting the limit is '
expected to work in favor of such j
teams as U.S.C. and California, with |
their large squads.
Stanford's hopes of placing better j
than third seem bare, with Edson j
Burrows not in the same shape as
he was at the start of the season J
and Carl Mahurin in poor shape be
cause of a bad knee. Mahurin
turned in a 51 second quarter early
this week in a test to see how his
I !e«* would stand up.
I A Card ira»_kster who has loomed
into contention recently is Paul
Huston, scrappy low hurdler. In
the junior P.A. meet at San Jose
State last Saturday, Huston won the
lows in 24 flat, despite the fact that
he hit the last hurdie and almost
lost his balance.

Leading the Cougars was Lee Orr,
powerfully built sprinter, who rep
resented Canada in the 1936 Olym
pic Games. Orr turned in three
sensational victories in the northern
division meet when he won the 100
in 9.5, the 220 in 20.9 and the low
hurdles in 23.7. In all three races,
he nosed out Mack Robinson, Ore
gon's burly Negro ace, who, like Orr,
son picked up a fourth second place
son picked up a fourth second place,
in the broad jump.
In last year's P.C.C. meet, Orr won
the 220 in 21.2 and placed second in

the century..
Other Northwest aces are George j
Varoff, Oregon's 14-foot pole vault
er; Art Morgan. Washington hurd- <
ler, who especially scintillates in I
the highs, in which he has done 14.4; i
Don' Johnson, Idaho's star weight

javelin, discus, and shot; Bill Van

high jump last year; and Wayne I

Entries Unlimited
This is the first year that entries
will be unlimited. Previously each
school was allowed only 15 competi- j
tors. The ruling lifting the limit is '
expected to work in favor of such j
teams as U.S.C. and California, with |
their large squads.
Stanford's hopes of placing better j
than third seem bare, with Edson j
Burrows not in the same shape as
he was at the start of the season J
and Carl Mahurin in poor shape be
cause of a bad knee. Mahurin
turned in a 51 second quarter early
this week in a test to see how his
I !e«* would stand up.
I A Card ira»_kster who has loomed
into contention recently is Paul
Huston, scrappy low hurdler. In
the junior P.A. meet at San Jose
State last Saturday, Huston won the
lows in 24 flat, despite the fact that
he hit the last hurdie and almost
lost his balance.
With the Southern California
Trojans crippled by the loss of their
great sophomore distance man,
Louis Zamperini, the Pacific Coast
Conference track meet, scheduled
for Saturday at 2:05 o'clock at Ed
wards Field in Berkeley, looms now
as a wide open battle.
Zamperini was a cinch for at least
nine points for the Trojans, and
those nine points were the approxi
mate margin by which most experts
picked the Trojans to win the meet,
which is now thrown into a tri-way
tussle between Troy, California, and
Washington State.
