# Breyer Upsets Wallace in Golf Quarter-Finals
## Cannon Wins Verdict Over Mass, 4 and 2, To Make Semi-Finals 
### 
Bob Breyer repeated his pet stunt
of upsetting the favorites yesterday
when he eeked out a 2-up decision
over Jack Wallace in the lower
bracket quarter-finals of Stanford's
all-University golf championship af
ter a see-saw battle all the way.
In the other lower bracket match,
Brown Cannon took an easy 4 and
2 verdict from Pete Haas, thereby
moving into one of the semi-final
matches, Saturday, with Breyer.
Art Doering and Mac Stoddard will
meet in the second semi-final.
Last year, Breyer, a freshman
then, was the surprise of the tourna
ment when he worked his way
through a strong list of veterans and
met Wallace in the finals which he
lost, o and 2, in a hard-fought
match.
By downing Wallace yesterday,
Breyer continued his habit of turn
ing the tables on the favorites which
he started last year. The match
started out with Wallace winning the
first two holes and seemingly headed
for an easy victory. Breyer squared
it, however, by taking the fifth and
sixth and went two-up himself with
wins on the ninth and twelfth. It
was then Wallace's turn to tie up
the match as he annexed the thir
teenth and fourteenth.
The boys played evenly on the
next two holes before Breyer ran
out the match by taking the last
two. Cards showed both with 75's,
three over par.
