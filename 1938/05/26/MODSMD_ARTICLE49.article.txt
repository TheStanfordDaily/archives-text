IN THIS materialistic age when the behavior
of even the most self-effacing atom has been
pigeon-holed into an equation, it is always
pleasant to run across something that l\as the
earmarks of a genuine miracle. And so we
have been unusually pleased this year to watch
the Tuesday Lecture Series return as from the
dead.
We watched the Series nearly gasp out its
life last spring. With the budget reduced the
quality of the programs had fallen into somno
lent dullness. The series was known about
the campus as something that combined all the
gripping drama of an econ text with the emo
tional appeal of a doctor's thesis. No one at
tended except a few dutiful professors and a
handful of Paly burghers.
At the end of last year we thought the Tues
day Lectures had gone to join the dodos and
dinosaurs.
But with fall quarter it revived. The budget
was increased and the quality of the programs
rose until they could compete with the local
temples to the gods of Hollywood. Good man
agement combined with a healthier bank ac
count made the series interesting.
Attendance mounted with the upswing in
quality. An audience of over 500 has been the
average during the past year. Before that, if
30 people turned out it was an occasion for
dancing in the streets.
And so the Tuesday Lecture has returned to
Ihe University family. Today its life expectancy
is a good risk for any insurance company. This
v/c present as Exhibit A in the case for mir
acles. —J. C.
