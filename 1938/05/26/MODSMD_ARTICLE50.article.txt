# Too Many Eggs Spoil
## 
### 
tT DOESN'T take a genius to figure out that
1 only so many eggs can be crammed into a
basket before they start to break. But Stanford
just showed signs of waking up to the truth of
that simple observation when complaints rose
in relation to the Convalescent Home Drive that
enough was enough.
Probably never since war-time days has the
campus been dunned so consistently for this
and that worthy cause. It would be difficult to
imagine a year more filled with campus activi
ties. If the functions have not been too great in
number, they have been emphasized past the
breaking point. Campus dances have been
nwung high with big, expensive name bands;
Iraditional drives have been built into mam
moth patchworks of money-getting events.
The point of saturation has been reached.
Campus interest and campus pocketbooks can
stand no more.
Committee leaders are largely responsible for
piling on back-breaking straws. Rather than
eliminating old ideas when new ones appear to
spark their campaigns, they have simply added
on the usual program.
Nor have new groups been wise in choosing
times for their events. Tradition has established
the part of the year when certain drives, class
functions, and campus enterprises shall take
place. In the past, the times were chosen to
avoid conflict. But with the insertion of other
events, the old balance has bfeen destroyed.
Spring guarter, particularly, has been jam
med, while winter and fall guarters are rela
tively slack. It is little wonder that campus
functions have been greeted with unwonted
lack of enthusiasm. The limit has been reached.
Unless the campus is to crystallize *at the
stage it is now in—too many activities, too little
support of them—a drastic reorganization of the
year's program must take place. A choice must
be made between conflicting activities; some
must be dropped, some played down, some
simply shifted to a different time of year.
Right now, Stanford is in the stage of a small
boy at a circus. It is darting about feverishly
trying to keep up with all the attractions. By the
time that it reaches the main event, its money
and enthusiasm are gone.—J. S.
