THE appointment of Sophomore Henry Houser
to dramatics manager left the campus some
what surprised Tuesday. No one guestions the
selection on yrounds of personality. But there

is speculation on whether or not one year's
experience in the office and on the campus is
enough to handle the job.
Tryoutees for the position work for three
quarters at routine jobs—stooges. Then, ab
ruptly, one of them jumps to the top position
ol directing one of Stanford's biggest activities.
There is no intermediate step to bridge the gap.
The bob-tailed system has worked compara
tively well in the past, but under the impetus
of a new theater and prods from active Stagers,
the work of dramatics council is rapidly ex
panding. The job is becoming more than one
man can handle, and under the present system,
only one man is in a position to do the job.
Tryoutees are too inexperienced to handle all
but the most minor details of the office. There
is no one to take some of the load off the man
ager, to allow him to attend to matters of policy
and long-range direction. He is swamped by
details, many of which could be delegated to
an assistant.
The direction of readings, for instance, could
fall to a second man. He would be elevated
from the trivial duties of the tryout period, be
given responsibility which, with a year's expe
rience, he could handle. The training he would
receive in handling such jobs would be bound
to make him a better dramatics manager than
the present system. No longer would he jump
from mere tryoutee to big shot.
Just now, the dramatics manager may fit his
administrative shoes comfortably. But it won't
be long until the shoes are big enough for two
men.—J. S.
