### SUMMER MUSIC 
r |' , HE summer music program was announced in The
Daily yesterday, and a very interesting program it
is.
It includes the internationally famed Roth Quartet,
the Chronicle's top-flight critic, Alfred Frankenstein,
Dr. Carleton Sprague Smith, chief of the music division
of the New York Public Library, and Marion Flagg of
Columbia University.
It is being sponsored by the Friends uf Music, an
alumni-faculty organization, and it plans to offer, for
"a limited number of students," a comparatively worth
while summer program of instruction—comparatively,
that is, in relation to the ordinary musical instruction
offered by the University during the rest of the year.
Part of the duty of a University lies in presenting
good opportunities for cultural education. This Stan
ford does not do, particularly in the field of music. It
has a glee club nobody listens to, and an organist to
play in the Chapel, but as far as an adequate program
of instruction in music is concemcd, it might as well
be M.I.T. It falls far short of the mark set by Senator
and Mrs. Stanford when they established the Univer
sity.
Now, for "a limited number of students," the Friends
of Music are providing a better-than-average summer
musical instruction. An independent body is taking
over a function the University either cannot, or will
not exercise, and in doing so is doing more for music
at Stanford than has been done in many a long day.
No one would minimize the work being done by
Warren D. Allen and his staff; but. neither would any
one—least of all, perhaps, Mr. Allen—say it was worthy
of a university such as Stanford. It is therefore an en
couraging sign that an outside organization is willing
to give of its time and money to make musical in
struction something more than a feeble gesture in the
direction of the founding grant.
It is encouraging because it should point the way
towards a goal which Stanford ought to reach—the
goal of full cultural responsibility. It is encouraging
because it should be an indication to Ihe Administra
tion that there is a very real need for something it
sometimes shows a tendency to disregard.
