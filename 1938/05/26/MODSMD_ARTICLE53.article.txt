r | I IIE policy statement of Henry Houser, new dra
matics manager, yesterday, included one interesting
item —his planned continuance of a "big band" policy
for student, shows. I lis statement was rather am
biguous, and we may be interpreting it wrongly when
we take it to mean that, if possible, really first class
bands will be imported to play for Spring Show and
Gaieties. Or else he is simply supporting the policy in
(he past few years of having bigger and better bands
to play at campus dances, in which case, he is going a
little out of his field.
But on this matter of bringing off-campus bands to
play for student productions, a little can be said. As
lie implies, campus bands have been lacking iti the
finesse, shall we say, which would make them popular.
Since Freddy Nagel, none has been really good. And
needless to say, the band is a very important item in
any musical show.
A case in hand is this year's Spring Show, which
was driven along under the impetus of a top-notch
band. Except for their leader, Art McCue, the whole
organization was professional, and good professional
at that, from San Francisco. Without a doubt, much
of the success of the show can be laid to the band. It
is to be strongly doubted that music by any campus
group which has been playing here this year could
have had quite the same effect.

the importation of an off-campus band, in
w this case, was worthwhile from the point of a
good show, it is difficult to say that the policy should
not bo followed. But the potential evils are apparent..
In this case, I understand, the expense was not too
great. But if the boys running campus productions
become too struck with the drawing power of a "big
band," the financial problems can become real.
And, when you come light down to it, campus pro
ductions, such as Spring Show, should by rights use
only campus talent. By going to extremes, the policy
of importing performers might, under a too-enthusi
astic manager, run to bringing entertainers of one sort
or another to the for individual turns. Such a
thing could hardly happen, of course, but it would only
lx» in line with the policy which Houser suggested.
We are not condemning the move in the case of
Spring Show last week. But we are just wondering
how far the policy can be carried without contradicting
the purpose of campus productions to use campus
performers. Stone.
