# Wilbur Urges Fraternities To Stay Home
## 'You'll Be in and Out Of Hotels All Your Lives', Says President 
### 
Why don't fraternities become so
cial centers?
President Ray Lyman Wilbur ask
ed this question of the 150 frater
nity executives and friencLs who last
night attended the annual Interfra
ternity banquet.
"Entertaining in your own home
is always good," he told his listen
ers, saying that he passed the ques
tion on to them as the one he found
most difficult to answer himself.
Use Your Own House
"You are planning your houses
so that you give over nearly your
entire first floor to social rooms.
Why don't you make use of them
instead of San Francisco hotel
dance floors?" was the gist of Dr.
Wilbur's message.
"You'll be in and out of hotels all
your lives," he said, "some day
you'll be as sick of them as I am.
Why not center your social activity
oi) the campus?"
Dr. Wilbur said he favored frater
nities because, as part of student
self-government, they gave students
an early chance to accept responsi
bility.
Fraternities More Democratic
"Fraternities are much more
democratic than they used to be,"
he said, "they have improved very
definitely."
Main purposes of the banquet were
a farewell to Dean of Men George B.
Culver, who retires this year from
the Interfraternity Board of Control,
anel introduction of new officers of
the council.
After being presented with a
pipe and a table and chair set,
Dean Culver told the diners that
sentimentality among the old is li
able to be "drooly."
"Not Unmindful"
"But I'm not unmindful of my
experiences with Stanford men," he
said.
Former Comptroller Almon E.
Roth told the fraternity men their
problem was "to keep fraternities
democratic and inexpensive."
Bud McDuffie and Ed Bosbyshell,
new president and secretary, de
clared their job was to continue
present policies of the council.
