11 long months, Japan's war !
in China, begun as "a bandit ex- !
termination campaign" after an "in- !
cident" involving Chinese railway !
guards and Nipponese troops at
maneuvers a short distance outside I
of Peiping, has dragged on and on. I
Each month Japan has widened |
the front of her activities, through- >
out the northern provinces and down
to the Yellow River, from Shanghai
up the Yangtze River to Nanking
and beyond. In adidtion, there have
been frequent diversions: air raids
over Canton, naval bombardments !
and landings at Amoy and South j
China ports, and international dip- j
lomatic crises over the bombing of
British and American ships.
All the while that Japan has ex
tended her lines into the vastness
that is China, she has become more
open to successful guerrilla attacks
upon her means of communication.
All (he while, the war has placed
increasingly greater strains upon
her internal social and political
structure.

Now that in the past few weeks
Japan has captured the vital rail
road city of Suchow-fu and broken
one end of the Lunghai line de
fending Hankow, and has exerted
diplomatic pre. sure forcing Adolf
Ilitler to call home German mili
tary advisors who were the tactical
mainstays of Gen. Chiang-kai
shek's "new Chinese army," pre
mier Prince Fumimaro Konoye
has reorganized his cabinet, giving
key posts to high army and navy
officers, in preparation for the
"final" drive of the war.
Key change in the cabinet is the
appointment of conservative Gen.
Kazunari Ugaki as Foreign Minister,
replacing Koki Hirota, which sug
gests curtailment of the strong gov
ernment bureaucracy and new im
perialist ventures.
