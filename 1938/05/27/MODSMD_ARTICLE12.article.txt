# '3' Before '2' Gives Profits to Cellar
## 
### 
The linotype operator, Wednes
day night, hit the "3" key before
the "2" key and got both keys.
And the Cellar, according to The
Daily, came out with a $32,000
profit.
Actual amount reported as net
profit by the Cellar last year was
$2,603.84. Of course, the linotype
operator has a very good case
against the Daily proofreader who
did not question the exorbitant
sum.
I DENY EVERYTHING.—OP.
