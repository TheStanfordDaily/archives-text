# Farm Press Calls Year Successful
## Manager Reports Considerable Rise In Sale of Books 
### 
Stanford University Press has en- |
joyed a sucessful year with book !
sales showing an increase of one- I
third over last year in spite of the |
recession in other lines of business. !
This announcement was made yes- j
terday by Stanley M. Croonquist,
sales manager of the Press.
The reason for this progress, Mr. 1
Croonquist said, was accounted for
by a better list of books being pub
lished than those of previous years.
Sales this year will probably be the
Sjecond largest in the history of the
Press, being exceeded only in the
year 1930-31.
Twenty Books
Twenty books have been published
this year, which is quite a jump over
last year's mark of 15 titles. These
books are for sale in all parts of
the United States, and also in the
British Empire where they are han
dled by the Oxford University
Press. ,
Approximately 400 different books
have been published since the
Press was organized in 1885. The
first book to bear the Stanford Uni
versity Press imprint was "A Syl
labus of Lectures on Economic Ge
ology," written by John C. Bran
ner, second president of Stanford,
and John F. Newsom.
Mr. Croonquist announced that
several books are scheduled for
publication during the summer
months. Of special interest to those
who live along the coast is Rieketts
and Calvin's "Between Pacific
Tides," a general book on the ani
mal life found along the water's
edge and in the tide pools.
'Big Trees' Edition
For people who go into the Sier
ras a new edition of Fry and
White's "Big Trees" will be fin
ished in June, to be followed by "A
Bibliography of German Literature
in Translation" by Dr. B. Q. Morgan,
head of the German department.
In the field of history and eco
nomics, two books are slated for
publication. The first is a Hoover
War Library publication entitled
"Allied Propaganda and the Col
lapse of the German Empire in 1918,"
by George C. Brunta. The other is
"Argentine Meat and the British
Market" by Simon G. Hanson of
the University of Louisville.
The psychologist and educator
| will find "Children with Delayed or
| Defective Speech," by Stinchfield
j and Young, a worthwhile addition
to the literature in their field.
