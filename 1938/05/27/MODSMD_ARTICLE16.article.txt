# Dean Culver Recalls Aid to Students During Career
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
Dean George Culver was in his
garden when we went out to see him
yesterday. He was wrestling with
the plank siding on one of the beds,
and somehow we got the impression
that he had been using language he
didn't learn from the Founding
Grant.
He took us into the little patio, and
we talked for an hour or so. He
told us stories of Stanford as it used
to be, and as he hoped it would be.
He spun us yarns of faculty mem
bers and of students, some funny,
some tragic. In that hour he gave
us enough material to write a dozen
short stories. And then he asked us
not to print it.
Private Stories
We wrangled it out with him, and
of course we lost. The best stories
were all tied down to personalities.
It would hurt people to drag them
out into the light. And so we left
without our story.
But even though Dean Culver has
done his work in discreet privacy
like a family lawyer or doctor, its
effects took. His great satisfaction,
he says, is that the things he has
worked for have been incorporated
into the Stanford system. •
Student Government
During his term of service student
government has grown and become
established. The honor system has
been tried, modified, and adopted.
The fraternities have pulled them
selves out of financial and social
whirlpools.
Dean Culver had a hand in all of
these. But most of his work and
most of his achievements have been
with students individually. He has
always worked by personal contact.
And in the quiet privacy of his of
fice he has tried to help Stanford by
helping the men who make Stanford.
He has calmed storming faculty

members who were determined to
"clean up" Encina because of some
run-in with exuberant frosh. He
has talked to students who thought
the easiest way to bp la nee a budget
was by signing someone else's name
to a cheek, to students who tried to
solve the grade question with the as
sistance of a bottle.
Those are the stories he won't lei
us print. And those are the only
stories that can give any sort of a
picture of the work he has done.
Experiences Told
There was a man, for instance,
who missed the brass ring on the
grade merry-go-round, and flunked!
i out twice. Not long after that, Dean
i Culver received a letter from a bank
in Southern California asking for
his opinion of the man. Dean Cul
! ver checked records and averages,
found that the man was talented in
j statistics and recommended him on
that basis, stating the rest of the
j case. The man was given a job. Six
I months later he was promoted.
At another time one of the fresh
j men got into an unusual brand of
, trouble. He was a Dutch boy, in
America for the first time. Lone
! some and homesick he thought he
! could get some comfort out of boat
ing. And so he got hold of a row
! boat and went out on the bay. Com
ing back he tied the boat to the
| dock; the incoming tide battered it
J against the piles smashing it. The
owner demanded $50 in damages.
In Dutch
The Hollander, 6000 miles from
i home, was appalled. Frightened
j and confused, he went to Dean Cul
ver. And the Dean wangled a Uni
versity loan for him out of a special
■ student help fund, set aside for
| emergency use.
But office hours are not the only
times that students see the Dean.
He always has taken part in student
faculty activities, and he has made a
habit of strolling around the campus
watching the wheels go round.
Former House
Some years ago, students used to
see h'im even more often. He was
! then living on the Row side of the
t campus in the last house on the
street. Across from his home was a
large field. Evidently morals and
| habits were different in those days,
| for every night the field would be
{crowded with cars, from which
couples observed the stars and other
I wonders of nature.
In the winter half the cars would
1 get stuck in the mud. And the driv
| ers would come to Dean Culver's
i house, the nearest one, to phone for
help. It used to upset them a bit to
meet the Dean, but it never bothered
him. Without bothering to ask if
they were alone, he would auto
matically tell them to bring the girls
in out of the cold.

Former House
Some years ago, students used to
see h'im even more often. He was

t campus in the last house on the
street. Across from his home was a
large field. Evidently morals and

{crowded with cars, from which
couples observed the stars and other
I wonders of nature.
In the winter half the cars would

i house, the nearest one, to phone for
help. It used to upset them a bit to
meet the Dean, but it never bothered
him. Without bothering to ask if
they were alone, he would auto
matically tell them to bring the girls
in out of the cold.
Dean George Culver was in his
garden when we went out to see him
yesterday. He was wrestling with
the plank siding on one of the beds,
and somehow we got the impression
that he had been using language he
didn't learn from the Founding
Grant.
He took us into the little patio, and
we talked for an hour or so. He
told us stories of Stanford as it used
to be, and as he hoped it would be.
He spun us yarns of faculty mem
bers and of students, some funny,
some tragic. In that hour he gave
us enough material to write a dozen
short stories. And then he asked us
not to print it.
Private Stories
We wrangled it out with him, and
of course we lost. The best stories
were all tied down to personalities.
It would hurt people to drag them
out into the light. And so we left
without our story.
But even though Dean Culver has
done his work in discreet privacy
like a family lawyer or doctor, its
effects took. His great satisfaction,
he says, is that the things he has
worked for have been incorporated
into the Stanford system. •
Student Government
During his term of service student
government has grown and become
established. The honor system has
been tried, modified, and adopted.
The fraternities have pulled them
selves out of financial and social
whirlpools.
Dean Culver had a hand in all of
these. But most of his work and
most of his achievements have been
with students individually. He has
always worked by personal contact.
And in the quiet privacy of his of

helping the men who make Stanford.

members who were determined to
"clean up" Encina because of some
run-in with exuberant frosh. He
has talked to students who thought
the easiest way to bp la nee a budget
was by signing someone else's name
to a cheek, to students who tried to
solve the grade question with the as
sistance of a bottle.
Those are the stories he won't lei
us print. And those are the only
stories that can give any sort of a
picture of the work he has done.
Experiences Told
There was a man, for instance,
who missed the brass ring on the
grade merry-go-round, and flunked!
i out twice. Not long after that, Dean
i Culver received a letter from a bank
in Southern California asking for
his opinion of the man. Dean Cul
! ver checked records and averages,
found that the man was talented in
j statistics and recommended him on
that basis, stating the rest of the
j case. The man was given a job. Six
I months later he was promoted.
At another time one of the fresh
j men got into an unusual brand of
, trouble. He was a Dutch boy, in
America for the first time. Lone
! some and homesick he thought he
! could get some comfort out of boat
ing. And so he got hold of a row
! boat and went out on the bay. Com
ing back he tied the boat to the
| dock; the incoming tide battered it
J against the piles smashing it. The
owner demanded $50 in damages.
In Dutch
The Hollander, 6000 miles from
i home, was appalled. Frightened
j and confused, he went to Dean Cul
ver. And the Dean wangled a Uni
versity loan for him out of a special
■ student help fund, set aside for
| emergency use.
But office hours are not the only
times that students see the Dean.
He always has taken part in student
faculty activities, and he has made a
habit of strolling around the campus
watching the wheels go round.
Former House
Some years ago, students used to
see h'im even more often. He was
! then living on the Row side of the
t campus in the last house on the
street. Across from his home was a
large field. Evidently morals and
| habits were different in those days,
| for every night the field would be
{crowded with cars, from which
couples observed the stars and other
I wonders of nature.
In the winter half the cars would
1 get stuck in the mud. And the driv
| ers would come to Dean Culver's
i house, the nearest one, to phone for
help. It used to upset them a bit to
meet the Dean, but it never bothered
him. Without bothering to ask if
they were alone, he would auto
matically tell them to bring the girls
in out of the cold.
Dean George Culver was in his
garden when we went out to see him
yesterday. He was wrestling with
the plank siding on one of the beds,
and somehow we got the impression
that he had been using language he
didn't learn from the Founding
Grant.
He took us into the little patio, and
we talked for an hour or so. He
told us stories of Stanford as it used
to be, and as he hoped it would be.
He spun us yarns of faculty mem
bers and of students, some funny,
some tragic. In that hour he gave
us enough material to write a dozen
short stories. And then he asked us
not to print it.
Private Stories
We wrangled it out with him, and
of course we lost. The best stories
were all tied down to personalities.
It would hurt people to drag them
out into the light. And so we left
without our story.
But even though Dean Culver has
done his work in discreet privacy
like a family lawyer or doctor, its
effects took. His great satisfaction,
he says, is that the things he has
worked for have been incorporated
into the Stanford system. •
Student Government
During his term of service student
government has grown and become
established. The honor system has
been tried, modified, and adopted.
The fraternities have pulled them
selves out of financial and social
whirlpools.
Dean Culver had a hand in all of
these. But most of his work and
most of his achievements have been
with students individually. He has
always worked by personal contact.
And in the quiet privacy of his of
fice he has tried to help Stanford by
helping the men who make Stanford.
