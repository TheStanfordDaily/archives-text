# Dean Culver Recalls Aid to Students During Career
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
Dean George Culver was in his
garden when we went out to see him
yesterday. He was wrestling with
the plank siding on one of the beds,
and somehow we got the impression
that he had been using language he
didn't learn from the Founding
Grant.
He took us into the little patio, and
we talked for an hour or so. He
told us stories of Stanford as it used
to be, and as he hoped it would be.
He spun us yarns of faculty mem
bers and of students, some funny,
some tragic. In that hour he gave
us enough material to write a dozen
short stories. And then he asked us
not to print it.
Private Stories
We wrangled it out with him, and
of course we lost. The best stories
were all tied down to personalities.
It would hurt people to drag them
out into the light. And so we left
without our story.
But even though Dean Culver has
done his work in discreet privacy
like a family lawyer or doctor, its
effects took. His great satisfaction,
he says, is that the things he has
worked for have been incorporated
into the Stanford system. •
Student Government
During his term of service student
government has grown and become
established. The honor system has
been tried, modified, and adopted.
The fraternities have pulled them
selves out of financial and social
whirlpools.
Dean Culver had a hand in all of
these. But most of his work and
most of his achievements have been
with students individually. He has
always worked by personal contact.
And in the quiet privacy of his of
fice he has tried to help Stanford by
helping the men who make Stanford.
He has calmed storming faculty
