# Final Chappie On Wednesday
## Sentimental Seniors Swan-Song Sadly 
### 
The curtain falls on Chaparral for
1937-38, Wednesday, June 8, with
the extra-lai-ge, extra-special extra
super senior issue.
One of the biggest of the year, no
expense has been spared on next
month's magazine, according to
"old boy" Robert T. Hartmann, who
ruefully admitted that special color
processes and extra features will
probably leave the Chappie expense
account in the red for the month.
The number of copies printed is
to be limited in number, Hartmann
went on to say, due to the expense
bugaboo.
Features Seniors
Featuring seniors and senior ac
tivity as a whole, the June issue will
! have many farewell contributions
jby staff seniors. In addition there
will be numerous contributions by
I members of the class of '38, who
i have never written for Chappie be
| fore this aloha issue.
"It's funny," mused Hartmann 19-
illectively, over his cigarette, "All of
(these senior contributions are either
j sadly reminiscent or dagger-edged
(against something or other. Put
{them together in the June issue and
I you have a delightful mixture of
' nostalgia and vitriol that is really
: good."
Good Art Planned
The art sections this issue are go
ing to be the best of the year, if
iChf.ppie edit predictions hold true
A full page of water colors in full
I color will feature this angle, while
| a photographic review of the year's
! activities will furnish the best sec
! tion of pictures for many an issue.
"A surprise to Farm theater goer?
will be revealed in the June Chap
! pie," chuckled Hartmann. The "olc
| boy" refused to disclose the exacl
j nature of it, but promises that the
! combined efforts of the Chappie re
viewers and the edit staff have gone
linto the surprise and that it will be
; a "hot finale."
