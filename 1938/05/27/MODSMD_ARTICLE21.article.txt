# Cards Gun For P.C.C. Upset
## Absence of Zamperini Brightens Hopes of Farm Win in Berkeley 
### JERRY MAYER 
Coach Robert Lyman Templeton will have a wicked gleam in his eye
today when he leads 25 Stanford tracksters to Berkeley for the annual
Pacific Coast Conference meet, which will lie concluded tomorrow on Ed
wards Field, starting at 2:05 o'clock.
Today, commencing at \\ o'clock, preliminaries will he held in the 100.

JJO, 440 and high and low hurdles
in the track events, and discus, shot
put. javelin, and broad jump in the
field competition.
Price Announced
Announcement comes from Don
Liebendorfer's office that students
showing student body cards will be
admitted tomorrow for 60 cents.
Coach Dink's wicked gleam is oc
casioned by the fact that he is out
gunning for a championship that
not one expert out of a thousand
will concede Stanford has a chance
of gaining.
With Louis Zamperini, Troy's po
tential two-event winner, on the
sidelines and Cal weakened by in
juries .o Charles Miller, Arnold
Nuttin;, and Elton Wieman, Dink
thinks that it isn't beyond compre
hension that the Indians might
sneak into the winning spot. Of
course, every Card will have to come
through and maybe Dink might
have to pull a few surprises out of
the grab bag, but that gleam in
Dink's eye looks menacing to the
safety of the favored U.S.C. and Cal
squads.
Great Field
Drawings for today's trial heats
wiil not be announced until this af
ternoon, but it is certain that even
the preliminaries will present hot
competition in the sprints, with a
great field entered. Lee Orr, Wash
ington State's Olympic Games ace,
and Mack Robinson, burly negro lad
from Oregon, figure to sprint stride
for stride with Troy's Adrian Talley
j in the century, and these two north
erners ought to walk away from the
! field in the furlong.
Other speedsters who might pull
| upsets are the supposedly injured
Nutting, Cal's Captain George An
derson, Peyton Jordan of S.C., and
Jim Buck of Oregon, who has been
i on Robinson's tail all season.
Upset Possible
Orr and Robinson are also ex
pected to pace the field in the low
| hurdles, but an upset could easily
| take place here with Earl Vickery
! of Troy, George Anderson of Cal,
j Tom Berkeley, Ucla sepia barrier
topper; and Stanford's Stan Hiser
j man all capable of winning, should
I the pressure of the sprints tire out
; the favorites.
Paul Huston, who has meteoric
ally raised himself to prominence,
is a Farm dark horse in this event.
However, Ed Burrows will be the
crux of Stanford's hopes for vic
tory. After several brilliant early
season performances, the lanky red
head hit a terrific slump, from
which he is now finally emerging.
If he has come back far enough to
hand Stan Sadaj, Cal soldier man,
another double defeat, and also trim
a few other distance .stars, too, in
the bargain, the Cards stand a defi
. nite chance of springing their cov
eted upset.
Another Duel
I The pole vault should produce
another brilliant duel tomorrow,
when Oregon's George VarofT tan
gles with Southern California's new
I heavenly twin combination of Lor
! ing Day and Kenny Dills. If VarofT
' can either split or defeat the Trojan
duo, Stanford will probably award
I the blond Wedfoot a Blick S.
Anyway, here's a definite lip:
; I Don't sell Stanford short for the
. ! P.C.C. crown.
