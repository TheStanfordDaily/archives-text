## 
### MARY E. FARRELL 
Last night Mrs. Herbert Hoover
and Mrs. Albert Sims dined at Roble
Hall in order to meet some of the
freshmen women in their surround
ings and to see their dormitory.
Mrs. Sims is the former Ruth
Hanna McCormack, daughter of
Mark Hanna, and is now the owner
of the Sandia School for Girls in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. She was
interested in meeting the freshmen
women and talking with them. She
wanted their opinion on what things
and subjects should be included in a
high school education to help them
prepare for college.
Mrs. Sims started the Sandia
School by accident a few years ago.
Albuquerque has a large Mexican
population. For that reason the pub
lic schools were full of Mexican
children, whose lack of knowledge
of English caused the progress of
the American children to be re
tarded.

j Mrs. Sims secured a tutor for her
i daughter so that she could progress
without having to wait for the slow
er Mexican I'hildren. The next year
several of her friends asked if her
daughter's tutor could teach their
| children too. Thus the school was
started. Â»
The school answers the demand for
a preparatory school and gives cred
its acceptable by any college in the
country. The tutor who started the
school with one pupil is now its
principal.
Mrs. Sims also visited some of
the departments of the University
yesterday, and was especially inter
ested in the new rapid reading
course of the psychology department,
Ruth Reynolds and Angela Gates
served as hostesses during the din
ner.
