# Klahoya Club Plans Barbecue, Hayride

women will hold its spring party
this afternoon when members will
swim, go on a hayride and hold a
barbecue.
Swimming will begin at 4 o'clock

ride at 5:30, when Klahoyans will
tour the campus and finally ride
into Paly for refreshments at the
home of member Betty May Bloyce.
Members are requested to dress in
formally, and bring some kind of
musical instrument, if only a comb
and tissue paper, as a fireside song
t'est will conclude the festivities.
