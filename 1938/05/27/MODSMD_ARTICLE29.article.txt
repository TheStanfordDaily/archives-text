# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
Hie Editor, Sir:
As annual as the appointment of
the dramatic manager is the sug
gestion that an assistant be appoint
ed to help him to execute his office.
This suggestion usually comes dur
ing the final period of tryouteeship
when the tryoutees realize that af
ter working for a year, only one of
them will have the opportunity to
become manager.
So comes Jim Stone's prediction
in yesterday's edit that the mana
ger's administrative shoes will soon
become big enough for two men, and
this is probable if Stagers activities
actually expand in the next year ac
cording to present plans.
Several Objections
But now there are several objec
tions to inaugurating a three-year
system of promotion, appointing an
assistant dramatic manager from the
tryoutees who will in his third year
become dramatic manager.
1. The job is at present not suf
ficiently attractive to induce men of
good caliber to work two years to
become manager. The better men
will enter a more immediately pro
ductive activity.
2. After a tryoutee spends two
years in this office, I doubt very
much if the practical experience he
would gain is proportionate to the
time spent since there is a limited
amount of experience to be gained.
In the situation of The Daily, every
year a man spends on the staff he is
learning proportionately more about
a newspaper, and should he not be
come editor, he has already gained
an immense amount of beneficial
experience.
Handles Three Shows
3. Now the manager handles three
shows—Gaieties, Winter Show, and
Spring Show. Next year play lead
ings will be added to his duties but
this will not likely increase the
manager's work to any great ex
tent since it will be difficult to
schedule any more readings than
were given this year, providing the
Division again has an extensive dra
matic program.
4. Several years ago the dramatic
manager handled from 10 to 15
shows a year with no assistant man
agers. Tryoutees handled details.
He was a supervisor and policy man,
often working on three plays at
once. (Then, he earned $450 a year,
instead of $250). It was never found
to be practical to have an assistant
manager then.
Division Difficult
5. Under the present set-up it is
extremely difficult to permanently
divide responsibility among tryout
ees—and likewise to assign any one
job in the office to an assistant. A

POSTPONE IT

man who might handle tickets effi
ciently might be poor at publicity.
A manager must be capable of both. !
6. It is my opinion that more than
any other student job, the dramatic
manager is given the opportunity
to work and gain benefit of experi- ,
ence in all divisions of his office, if
he delegates various divisions to an j
assistant, he is losing training he 1
himself should have.
Anti-Efficiency
7. The system might prevent effi
ciency if it should happen that a tfy- I
outee would make a more capable .
dramatic manager than the assistant I
manager under whom he is working. '
This might occur when an assistant |
manager would lose interest in his [
job due to outside interests.
Suggestions:
1. No change in the present sys- :
tem should be made until it is dem- 1
onstrated that the manager needs an
assistant. If Houser manages a i
monthly radio program, play read- J
ings, and a movie next year, it will j
be demonstrated then whether or I
not he needs an assistant.
2. If he feels that an assistant is
; necessary to manage readings, the |
movie, and the radio program, the
matter should then be taken to Ex
Committee and thoroughly dis
cussed.
