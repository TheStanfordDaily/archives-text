# Wholesale Commissary Provides Good Living for Farm Students
## Pidgin English, Sino-Japanese War Complicate Job of Co-Operators 
### 
When cooks or house managers!
tell Elliot H. Ayers, director of the j
Stanford Wholesale Commissary,!
that he has sent them meat of poor
quality, he cheeks up and usually j
finds they just don't know.
The case of the baby beef is Mr.
Ayers' favorite proof of this. It was
.several years ago when the Co-op
ordered its usual amount of baby
beef, and the wholesaler sent one
that had been a prize-winner in the
San Francisco Stock Show.
Blue ribbons that were sent with
the beef attracted the eyes of a
house manager, who asked Mr.
Ayers to send part of it to his house.
"Poor Quality"
"Poor quality," said the cook, who
returned the meat. Ayers accepted
Ihe returned purchase and laughed
to himself.
All hough the Co-op saves living
groups about $10,000 a year on meat
alone, only Ihe finest grade is sent
out. The Co-op, according to Presi
dent Deane Johnson, buys for its
members as good quality meat as
can be obtained anywhere.
Serves 2:5 Halls
jbe Commissary, serving 23 cam
pus dining halls, cannot help but
save. It follows the simple process
of buying in large quantities at
wholesale rather than causing each
group to buy individually at retail.
With long experience in specula
lion, Director Ayers knows when
prices have reached a low, so he
buys in large quantities and dis
tributes Ihe food while prices arc
high.
Last year, when the drought ap
peared in the Mid-West, Mr. Ayers
immediately bought large quantities
of canned corn and distributed il to
members throughout the year for
about half the prevailing wholesale
price.
Greater Savings
The Co-op is able to make greater
savings than grocers. Jack Mustain,
the butcher, is paid no more than
other skilled workers in his trade,
but the great volume of business at
Ihe Co-op makes it possible for Jack
to spend all his time cutting meat,
while wrapping and labeling, ordi
narily done by Ihe butcher at high

| wages, are left to an apprentice.
Labeling and taking orders for I
! the Co -op really takes great skill, j
because the Co-op deals extensively j
1 with Chinese cooks.
Pidgin English must be under
stood perfectly before a warehouse- j
' man knows to send an order from
| "Chippsy" to Chi Psi or from "Phlie- I
1 shappapie" to Phi Psi. According to I
| Mr. Ayers, the brands of food with
j one-syllable names are greatest fav
orites among the Oriental cooks.
War Problems
The Japanese war has brought a I
j new problem to the Co-op. It has ;
i been found that the only way to i
j make Chinese cooks accept scallops j
I is to remove the Japanese labels.
Advertising is unnecessary at the i
I Stanford Commissary. As Mr. Ay- I
I ers explains this saving, "The Co-op j
I is nothing but a store owned and j
I operated by its own customers, so |
! why advertise?"
Seventy-three cents a day is the :
average cost of food to Co-op mem- j
( hers. Some pay as high as $1.01, i
1 while the low is 54 cents. And this |
year each of the 30 Co-op buyers
I will be refunded about $100.

Serves 2:5 Halls
jbe Commissary, serving 23 cam
pus dining halls, cannot help but
save. It follows the simple process
of buying in large quantities at
wholesale rather than causing each
group to buy individually at retail.
With long experience in specula
lion, Director Ayers knows when
prices have reached a low, so he
buys in large quantities and dis
tributes Ihe food while prices arc
high.
Last year, when the drought ap
peared in the Mid-West, Mr. Ayers
immediately bought large quantities
of canned corn and distributed il to
members throughout the year for
about half the prevailing wholesale
price.
Greater Savings
The Co-op is able to make greater
savings than grocers. Jack Mustain,
the butcher, is paid no more than
other skilled workers in his trade,
but the great volume of business at
Ihe Co-op makes it possible for Jack
to spend all his time cutting meat,
while wrapping and labeling, ordi
narily done by Ihe butcher at high

| wages, are left to an apprentice.
Labeling and taking orders for I
! the Co -op really takes great skill, j
because the Co-op deals extensively j
1 with Chinese cooks.
Pidgin English must be under
stood perfectly before a warehouse- j
' man knows to send an order from
| "Chippsy" to Chi Psi or from "Phlie- I
1 shappapie" to Phi Psi. According to I
| Mr. Ayers, the brands of food with
j one-syllable names are greatest fav
orites among the Oriental cooks.
War Problems
The Japanese war has brought a I
j new problem to the Co-op. It has ;
i been found that the only way to i
j make Chinese cooks accept scallops j
I is to remove the Japanese labels.
Advertising is unnecessary at the i
I Stanford Commissary. As Mr. Ay- I
I ers explains this saving, "The Co-op j
I is nothing but a store owned and j
I operated by its own customers, so |
! why advertise?"
Seventy-three cents a day is the :
average cost of food to Co-op mem- j
( hers. Some pay as high as $1.01, i
1 while the low is 54 cents. And this |
year each of the 30 Co-op buyers
I will be refunded about $100.
When cooks or house managers!
tell Elliot H. Ayers, director of the j
Stanford Wholesale Commissary,!
that he has sent them meat of poor
quality, he cheeks up and usually j
finds they just don't know.
The case of the baby beef is Mr.
Ayers' favorite proof of this. It was
.several years ago when the Co-op
ordered its usual amount of baby
beef, and the wholesaler sent one
that had been a prize-winner in the
San Francisco Stock Show.
Blue ribbons that were sent with
the beef attracted the eyes of a
house manager, who asked Mr.
Ayers to send part of it to his house.
"Poor Quality"
"Poor quality," said the cook, who
returned the meat. Ayers accepted
Ihe returned purchase and laughed
to himself.
All hough the Co-op saves living
groups about $10,000 a year on meat
alone, only Ihe finest grade is sent
out. The Co-op, according to Presi
dent Deane Johnson, buys for its
members as good quality meat as
can be obtained anywhere.
