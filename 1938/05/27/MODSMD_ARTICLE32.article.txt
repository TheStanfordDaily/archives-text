# Zeta Psis Fiddle While Roof Burns
## 
### 
The Zeta Psi's had a fire in their
roof yesterday.
Evidently it flustered the Zetes
because they had trouble figuring
out where their roof was.
When one of them called the
fire house and said "Send a truck
to the Zeta house," the fireman
who answered wasn't sure whether
the truck was to go to the Zeta,
Theta, or Beta house, so he asked
for the address.
"I don't know. "I'll ask," came
the reply.
A pause—and "It's at 5:18 La
suen."
Luckily someone at the firehouse
figured out that the fire was at
the Zete house, the Zete house
was at 583 Lagunita Drive. Most
of the fire department got to the
fire — and quickly extinguished it.
while one truck drove up and
down Lasuen.
