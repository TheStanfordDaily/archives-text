# Zeta Psis Fiddle While Roof Burns
## 
### 
The /eta I'si's had a fire in their
roof yesterday.
Evidently it flustered the Zetcs
because they had trouble figuring
out where their roof was.
When one of them called the
fire house and said "Send a truck
to the /eta house," the fireman
who answered wasn't sure whether
t /><• truck was to go to the Zeta,
I beta, or Beta house, so he asked
for the address.
"I don't know. "I'll ask," came
(he reply.
A pause—and "It's at 5:18 La
sticn."
Luckily someone at the firehou.se
figured out that the fire was at
I lie Zete house, the /etc house
was at 58:5 Lagunita Drive. Most
of the fire department got to the
lire—and quickly extinguished it.
while one truck drove up and
down Lasucn.
