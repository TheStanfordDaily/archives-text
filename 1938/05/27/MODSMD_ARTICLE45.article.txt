After seeing the fine display of
tennis in the University champion
ships. there was more than one spec
tator who wondered at the poor rec
ord of the Stanford team during the
past season. Not only did the Card
team end up in the conference cel
lar, but it also lost the major part
of its practice matches.
Captain Underwood, hampered by
a knee injury sustained in the first
U.C.L.A. encounter, failed to tarn in
a good victory all year, and Bob
Braly, the only other letterman,
didn't come anywhere near hitting
his top form. The rest of the team,
all of them sophomores, dropped the
best part of their singles matches,
most of these losses coming through
inexperience.
There is no doubt that Stanford
tennis was not up to par, but on the
other hand the opposition encoun
tered was the toughest in many
years. Southern California, the con
ference winner, offered a lineup that
would scare the Davis Cup teams of
a good many small nations. Two
national champions led off the list—
Hunt in the juniors and Wetherell in
the public parks division—and Leav
ens, playing in third place, had been
national boy champ several years
ago. And behind these three was
Bartelt, who was good enough to
beat Stanford's top man in the in
tercollegiate tourney at Ojai.
There are few persons on the
campus who know about it, but
last year Stanford had the national
intercollegiate doubles champions,
Ben Dey and Bill Seward, in its
ranks. In IStanford's duo of
Joe Coughlin and Sam Lee took
the same tournament, and the year
before Coughlin won with Keith
(Jledhill.
In addition to these winners Stan
ford has had in the past 15 years two
other national intercollegiate doubles
teams and two singles champions,
the last being Gledhill in 1931. Gled
hi 11 later went on to win the na
tional tourney with Ellsworth Vines.
This is an imposing list, especially
for a sport like tennis where most
of the top men players in the coun
try have come through the college
ranks.
Of this year's team only Under
wood and Seaver could qualify to
lake part in the final intercollegi
ate tourney. With Underwood im
proving further the way he has
during the past few weeks, he
should l)e a threat in the singles.
He lias had experience before in
the East and will have the edge on
many of the other competitors.
Seaver was the steadiest of the
sophs this season and an Eastern
trip may be just the thing to make
him a real power on the team next
year. Dave Brock, Lloyd Gates, and
Myron Folsom, the remaining sopho
mores making up the first six,
gained a lot from a year of competi
and each one of them turned in in
dividual performances that show
that they will improve during the
next year.
With Stanford facing the stiffest
competition in the country in the
Coast conference, hopes for a win
ning team next year cannot be high,
but Stanford should be back on the
tennis map before long with these
four sophs the backbone of a well
balanced team of no individual stars.
