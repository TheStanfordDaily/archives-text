## 
### 
Already boasting the 1!K58 all-University baseball championship, Kappa
Sigma will be* gunning for a clean sweep of Intramural horschidc this
afternoon when it meets Kncina 4\V in the softball finals. 'Ilie game is
scheduled for 4:15 o'clock on Intramural Field.
The Kappa Sin will be heavily favored over their younger, less ex-

perienced adversaries. Encina 4W<
is the first frosh team of recent
years to work its way into the finals j
of any University competition.
Kappa Sig Captain
Leading the Kappa Sigs is Cap- j
tain Kenny Peters, fire-ball pitcher
arid leading hitter of the team. Last
year Peters led the Palo Alto Muni
cipal Softball League in pitching,
and he has averaged 13 strike-outs
a game in 1938 mural competition.
Louis "Chooch" Tsoutsouvas, who
backstops for Peters' fast-ball is an
other slugger, besides being a tower
of defensive strength behind the
plate. Completing the Kappa Sig
"murderers' row" is Bud Bohoskey,
wiry second baseman, a home run
hitter.
Kncina Pitcher
Against this front of pitching
strength and power, the frosh will
present a well-balanced outfit which
has been in the habit of coming
through in the pinch. Ray Stahl,
Encina pitcher, hasn't Peters' speed,
but he has control and a good curve,
and is backed by a splendid fielding
team.
Ed Wearin, frosh catcher, has
been the outstanding light on the
team all season, and stops every
thing he can get his hands on, in
cluding pop ilys, foul tips, and bad
throws. Ted Chester at short stop
is another defensive bulwark.
Frosh Sluggers
Leading the Encina batting attack
will be, besides Wearin and Stahl,
Jerry Mayer, captain and center
fielder, and Rollie Garretson, hard
hitting third sacker.
In winning the championship of
League 4. the Kappa Sigs defeated
Ei Toro, 12-10; Alpha Kappa Lamb
da, 22-1; and Beta Theta Pi and
Encina IE by forfeits. In play-off
games against other league winners,
they trounced Sigma Chi, 4-2, and
Business School, 10-3.
The Encina 4W squad annexed the
gonfalon of League 3 by trimming
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 14-1; Theta
Chi. 12-11; Breakers, 11-G; and Al
pha Tau Omega, 6-5. In playoff
games, the frosh tipped over Delta
Kappa Epsilon, 11-0, and Phi Gam
ma Delta, 10-4.

and he has averaged 13 strike-outs
a game in 1938 mural competition.
Louis "Chooch" Tsoutsouvas, who
backstops for Peters' fast-ball is an
other slugger, besides being a tower
of defensive strength behind the
plate. Completing the Kappa Sig
"murderers' row" is Bud Bohoskey,
wiry second baseman, a home run
hitter.
Kncina Pitcher
Against this front of pitching
strength and power, the frosh will
present a well-balanced outfit which
has been in the habit of coming
through in the pinch. Ray Stahl,
Encina pitcher, hasn't Peters' speed,
but he has control and a good curve,
and is backed by a splendid fielding
team.
Ed Wearin, frosh catcher, has
been the outstanding light on the
team all season, and stops every
thing he can get his hands on, in
cluding pop ilys, foul tips, and bad
throws. Ted Chester at short stop
is another defensive bulwark.
Frosh Sluggers
Leading the Encina batting attack
will be, besides Wearin and Stahl,
Jerry Mayer, captain and center
fielder, and Rollie Garretson, hard
hitting third sacker.
In winning the championship of
League 4. the Kappa Sigs defeated

gonfalon of League 3 by trimming

pha Tau Omega, 6-5. In playoff
