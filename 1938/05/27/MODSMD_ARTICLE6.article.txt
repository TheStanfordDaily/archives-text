# Modern Home To Be Opened To Students
## Functional House Will Be Exhibited 
### 
Stanford's most famed piece of
modern architecture, a home de
signed by Frank Lloyd Wright, will
open to the student body next Tues- j
day afternoon from 3 to 5 o'clock.
Responding to a request of the J
Student-Faculty Relations Commit- l
tee, Dr. and Mrs. Paul R. Hanna will
hoid open-house for students inter
ested in seeing their home on Coro
nado Avenue.
According to Chairman Putzie
Hinrichs, this will be the only op- j
portunity that will be given to see i
this remarkable building, which is |
constructed entirely of glass, brick, >
and redwood. Assisting in arrange- j
ments for the event are Dick Dud- j
man and Larry Livingston.
Frank Lloyd Wright is perhaps the
best-known contemporary architect: j
his creations are principally of an j
ultra-modern, experimental type. I
The design of Hanna home is !
basically functional. The exterior;
lines fit in with the surrounding !
landscape.
The kitchen is located in the cen
ter of the house, and glass panels on
one side of the building slide open j
during warm weather. Textiles and j
furnishings were designed by |
Wright, who is a close friend of Dr. !
and Mrs. Hanna.
The house has been the subject of ,
numerous articles in architectural i
journals.
