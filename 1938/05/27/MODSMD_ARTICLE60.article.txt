# Cutter Searches For Lost Yacht
## 
### 
SANTA CRUZ, May 26 (UP). -
The Coast Guard Cutter Shoshone
set out today on a search for a
missing Â£25,000 yacht on which may
be lound aboard three Santa Cruz
high school boys. The boys had been
talking of going on a long cruise and
they disappeared at the same time
the yacht Tira was reported miss
ing. The task assigned to the Sho
shone, which was dispatched from
San Francisco, was a difficult one.
The Tira, a 60-foot diesel-motored
sloop, the property of Lew Foote,
chain candy store owner, might have
been taken on a westward voyage
toward Honolulu, 2100 miles away.
Or it might have sailed south along
the coast toward Los Angeles and
San Diego.
The Coast Guard asked all ves
sels in the area to keep a lookout
for the vessel and to report imme
diately if it is sighted.
