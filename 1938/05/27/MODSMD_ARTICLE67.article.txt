DEAN GEORGE CULVER'S garden is behind
his house where the soil is best, not out in
front where it would attract attention. And so
the garden flourishes, even though it is ignored
by tourists trying to get from the Chapel to
Hoover's home.
Much of Dean Culver's work at Stanford has
been done in the administrative back yard
where it helped most, not in the assembly hall
where it would awe the freshmen.
Most of his v/ork has been with individuals,
and he believes that in dealing with men's per
sonal troubles privacy is essential. He keeps no
files of the cases that come to him. He never
permits publication of a story without the con
sent of everyone involved. For years he has
campaigned against the merciless way the bawl
out exposes grade averages to the curious gaze
of the multitude.
And so what Dean Culver does stays out of
the headlines by his request. But working on
his principle of quiet contact with individuals
he has helped to shape Stanford men and Stan
ford policies.
He has guided the fraternities in their strug
gle to get out of the financial wilderness, and he
has introduced an element of peace into their
fratricidal rushing warfare. He helped gain for
freshmen recognition as human beings instead
of as a form of animal life that had to look up
to the tapeworm. He nursed the honor system
through childhood diseases and helped it start
on its career.
Quietly he has worked behind the Stanford
scenes, dealing with personalities and believing
that by influencing individuals he could help
both the individuals and the school.
He feels that the soil behind the impressive
front of the Ad Building is worth cultivating. —
