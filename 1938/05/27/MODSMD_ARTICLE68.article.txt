LEST we be accused of crying wolf only for
the sake of crying when we spoke of the
need to reorganize the year's activities calendar,
we checked up on the number of campus events
in the past three quarters. What we found not
only seems to support our claim, but makes us
wonder why we have been able to go on as
long as we did.
We learned that the wearied complaint that
spring quarter is too jammed was no lie. By
our count, 27 different events fought for our
time and money, more than twice as many as
during fall quarter, and only three less than
double those in winter. With nine weeks of
school this quarter, it means that three functions
a week were big enough to call forth publicity
in The Daily, and.to bring out all-campus par
ticipation.
And they all cost money. Dri/es alone
drained nearly $10,000 from the campus. Only
one of them came during fall quarter, four win
ter, and ten spring. Legally speaking, the Con
valescent Home Drive might count as only one.
But each event in its program has reached the
stage of a real drive in itself. Singly some of
them outbid any other campus fund solicita
tion in the number of participants and the
amount of money taken in. Collectively, the
combination is little short of terrific.
As for dances, big-name bands for half of the
ten important ones on the campus ran up the
entertainment budget alarmingly. Fall quarter
got by with only three, one of them a name
band affair, and winter quarter seconded the
motion. But sprinq quarter blossomed out with
four big dances, all but one of which was costly.
To the events we have mentioned must be
added plays, concert series, Tuesday lectures,
class functions, numerous house and hall affairs,
and special senior assessments. The cost ranged
from ten cents for Tag Day to the 58.50 of Senior
Ball, with a nice plateau around $2.50 for cam
pus dances.
Now we are urged to stay on the campus for
our entertainment, and are told to support our
campus enterprises, and we are glad to comply
up to a certain point. But when that point is
Teached, and it has been, our nervous systems
and our purses simply can't take it. I. S.

our count, 27 different events fought for our
time and money, more than twice as many as
during fall quarter, and only three less than
double those in winter. With nine weeks of
school this quarter, it means that three functions
a week were big enough to call forth publicity
in The Daily, and.to bring out all-campus par
ticipation.
And they all cost money. Dri/es alone
drained nearly $10,000 from the campus. Only
one of them came during fall quarter, four win
ter, and ten spring. Legally speaking, the Con
valescent Home Drive might count as only one.
But each event in its program has reached the
stage of a real drive in itself. Singly some of
them outbid any other campus fund solicita
tion in the number of participants and the
amount of money taken in. Collectively, the
combination is little short of terrific.
As for dances, big-name bands for half of the
ten important ones on the campus ran up the
entertainment budget alarmingly. Fall quarter
got by with only three, one of them a name
band affair, and winter quarter seconded the
motion. But sprinq quarter blossomed out with
four big dances, all but one of which was costly.
To the events we have mentioned must be
added plays, concert series, Tuesday lectures,
class functions, numerous house and hall affairs,
and special senior assessments. The cost ranged
from ten cents for Tag Day to the 58.50 of Senior
Ball, with a nice plateau around $2.50 for cam
pus dances.
Now we are urged to stay on the campus for
our entertainment, and are told to support our
campus enterprises, and we are glad to comply
up to a certain point. But when that point is
Teached, and it has been, our nervous systems
and our purses simply can't take it. I. S.
