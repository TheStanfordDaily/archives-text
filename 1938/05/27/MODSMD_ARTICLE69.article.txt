Dramatics manager clay McDaniel
lists seven reasons in Campus Opinion why
any change in the system that appointed a soph
omore to succeed him would be useless. To
complement his points, we would like to add a
few ol our own. For instance:
1. McDaniel calls his position unattractive.
But on the other hand, he holds the reins of
one of the biggest campus activities, has a short
er training period than any other important stu
dent position, and draws a pretty fair salary.
2. He says the job would be even less attrac
tive if the man had to work more than one year
to get it. In his eyes, it is small enough to make
a second year of training unprofitable and un
necessary. Good men would pass on to other
more productive activities, he says. Probably,
we suppose, to things like Rally Committee,
where the man works two years in the hope of
being one of three elected to Cardinals. He
learns the job in a few months, and after that
can only bear up because he obtains a little
prestige and a lot of fun. Yet neither organiza
tion has too much trouble making up its mem
bership.
3. To make up for his objections he suggests
an excellent plan to lock the door after the horse
is stolen. He says the job is small-time enough
for a sophomore to handle, and if it isn't, some
thing can be done about it—later.
He would leave a sophomore on the spot of
expanding campus dramatics rather than do
something about the system that put him there.
So far, managers have been tough enough to
handle the job and take on more and more work
without real assistance. If next year's man
ager, or any other sophomore, can't keep up
the pace, it's just too bad—for campus dra
matics.—J. S.
