administrations have produced so many poten
tial Presidents as that of Franklin Roosevelt. Dur
ing an era in which rugged individualism among high
officials has been allowed to run rampant, more than
one of the happy throng has given indication that his
eye is on 1940; and Will Rogers' remark that the for
gotten man—lo of him—had been found and put in the
Cabinet, has riot held true for the secondary offices
in the government any more than it has for the Cabinet
itself.
Not the least who may conceivably enter the race
for the Democratic nomination is Joseph Patrick Ken
nedy, erstwhile chairman of the SEC, erstwhile chair
man of the Maritime Commission, and at present Am
bassador to the Court of St. James, a post to which he
was dispatched not two months ago by a grateful and
possibly nervous President.
For Joe Kennedy is a good man, and in the past
year he has received a good deal of recognition as
such. Whatever his enemies think of him, none im
pugns his integrity. He has the advantage of beint* not
only progressive, but scrupulously honest. The press
calls him a "trouble-shooter," and he has proved him
self to be one of the very best in the Roosevelt Ad
ministration.
His two chairmanships were conspiculously suc
cessful, despite mildly strong-arm methods which an
noyed certain business and labor leaders who were
quick to call the kettle black when it began interfering
with the pot. He seems to have a knack for making
politically advantageous enemies, and the fact that he
does a very good job in the process makes those who
criticize him look rather foolish and less than effective.
He has all the qualifications of a good candidate,
and all the qualities of a good President, efficiency,
personality, liberalism, foresight. He has a family
which beats the Roosevelts two to one, as far as num
bers are concerned, and has already given evidence
that it could beat them in energetic activity if it really
tried.
The only thing which might interfere with his
chances, exclusive of a political cabal, is his religion,
Roman Catholic; and even there, Limes have changed,
so that his record in public service, might easily defeat
even the carefully nurtured myth '> f White-House-in
thc-Vatican which ruined A1 Smith.
He is far too politically obvious to be overlooked
in an election year, which probably had something to
do with Mr. Roosevelt's sudden decision If) send hiin
packing off across the ocean, 6000 miles away. And it
may also have something to do with his decision to
return to the United States in June for a two-weeks'
visit.
Ostensibly, this is to see his eldest son graduate
from Harvard. But congressional elections are coming;
and Joe Kennedy, nobody's fool, may very possibly
bo building his fences and gathering his adherents,
quietly preparing for the day in 1940 when a wild
eyed Democratic Convention chooses its standard
bearer.—Allen Drury.

For Joe Kennedy is a good man, and in the past
year he has received a good deal of recognition as
such. Whatever his enemies think of him, none im

calls him a "trouble-shooter," and he has proved him
self to be one of the very best in the Roosevelt Ad
ministration.
His two chairmanships were conspiculously suc
cessful, despite mildly strong-arm methods which an
noyed certain business and labor leaders who were
quick to call the kettle black when it began interfering
with the pot. He seems to have a knack for making
politically advantageous enemies, and the fact that he
does a very good job in the process makes those who
criticize him look rather foolish and less than effective.
He has all the qualifications of a good candidate,
and all the qualities of a good President, efficiency,
personality, liberalism, foresight. He has a family
which beats the Roosevelts two to one, as far as num
bers are concerned, and has already given evidence
that it could beat them in energetic activity if it really
tried.
The only thing which might interfere with his
chances, exclusive of a political cabal, is his religion,
Roman Catholic; and even there, Limes have changed,
so that his record in public service, might easily defeat

return to the United States in June for a two-weeks'
visit.
Ostensibly, this is to see his eldest son graduate
from Harvard. But congressional elections are coming;
and Joe Kennedy, nobody's fool, may very possibly
