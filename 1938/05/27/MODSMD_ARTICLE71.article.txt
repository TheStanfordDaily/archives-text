IT'S beginning to look as if the summer school stu
dents are really going to hear some good dance
music this summer. While it's probable that Tommy
Dorsey won't play the Senior Ball because of a little
$1650 item, it is certain that he will play a one-nighter
| at Sweet's around June 25 or 2t>. He opens at the
Palomar in Los Angeles on June 2!), so most of us
will be able to hear the broadcasts even if we are un
able to catch him in person. The Casa Loma crew are
I also playing the Palomar this summer, and will like
wise do a one-nighter at Sweet's. Now. if only Lunce
ford would come back!
Carl Ravazza leaves the Drake's Persian Room at
the end of the month, to be replaced by the King's
Jesters. If our memory serves, they are a small swing
group, numbering six men, most of whom double on
two or more instruments. They used to be heard from
i Chicago on the CBS and had a plenty smooth vocalist
whose name, we believe, was Marjorie Whitney. Any
! way, they are on the Ellis Kimball style, only with
more finesse.
Another good break we are going to Ret over the
air is the Casa Loma- replacing Jan Garber on the
Burns-Allen program. And the funny thing about the
j deal is that it seems that it was CJarber's speaking
I voice, not his music that was at fault. l'at McGuijk.
