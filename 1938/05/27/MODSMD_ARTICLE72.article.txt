# Bea, Bing Save 'Rhythm'
## 
### 
"I)r. Rhythm," currently playing,
at the Fox-Stanlord, wobbles a bit
in point of technique, creaks audibly
on the matter of theme. But when j
Bea Lillie and Bing Crosby pool
their gifts for the light touch, no- 1
body squawks.
In the first place, the slap-stick in
"Dr. Rhythm" fails to sour after the
first few rounds. When Miss Liilie, !

with incomparable |
British pleghm, j
lifts her velvet j
flounces and sails
off the stage on a
pair of roller j
skates, when she
gurgles a blues
tune and pauses
in the middle of
it to buff her fin
ger-nails, the ef-j

feet should get a rise out of a mem
ber of the W.C.T.U.
Bing Crosby, besides dripping
honeyed lyrics, gels in the same
crazy groove, monkeys around with j
almost as much aplomb as Miss
Lillie. Moreover, the tunes lie j
croons, including "My Heart Is Tak- j
ing Lessons," "On the Sentimental i
Side," and "This Is My Night to j
Dream," are top-notchers.
The story, when you can find it, j
has something t.o do with a doctor, j
who, taking over for a cop who has j
been bitten in the seat of the pants j
in a bout with a seal, plays body- ]
guard to a young heiress fallen into I
the clutches of a petty crook. With j
anything less than such crack talent j
and a few corking situations to bol- j
ster it, the plot might have collapsed :
in a heap.
As it is,"Dr. Rhythm" turns out j
to be the brightest lly-speck to dot \
the cinematic horizon in quite some j
time.

"Accidents Will Happen," the sec- j
ond feature, tells about a nice young i
insurance agent who wrests single- :

handed with a bunch of grafters in
the accident faking racket. Fairly
interesting at the start, the picture
steadily dwindles, gets bogged down
in a mess of very, very sinister
forces.—Slater.
