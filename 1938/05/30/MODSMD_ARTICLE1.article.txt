international politics is
often economics carried on by
othe™ means is indicated by the de
velopment of Washington's use of its
silver purchase policy as a pressure
to cause Mexico to modify, if not to
halt, its policy of expropriation of
American and other foreign-owned
oil properties.
Immediately after President La
zaro Cardenas had decreed the na
tionalization of properties valued as
high as $400,000,000, the United
States, on March 31, suspended its
.silver agreement with Mexico and
weakened that country's financial
structure by causing a series of re
ductions in the world per ounce
price of silver.
While it has recognized the com
plete legality of Mexico's actions,
Ihe Roosevelt Administration has
endeavored to secure full compensa
tion for seized American properties.
* * *
In the intervening period, grow
ing economic dislocation within
Mexico has resulted in the appar
ently abortive, but as yet not set
tled, ' pocket rebellion" of Gen.
Saturnino Cedillo in the state of
San Luis Potosi.
Consequently, the United States,
with a "Good Neighbor policy"
toward Central and South Amer
ica that can allow for no revolu
tionary upsets, is preparing to
rescind its earlier action and ex
tend new economic backing to the
Cardenas government.

Late last week the stage was set
when Mexican Ambassador Fran
cisco Najera submitted to Under
secretary of State Sumner Welles a
secret plan for settling the dispute.
The State Department, which has
held that it is only an intermediary
in the problem, it is understood, has
now presented details of the unre
vealed plan to the American pro
ducers.
Yesterday the first act opened,
with "monetary experts" of the
Treasury Department forecasting an
early resumption of the suspended
silver purchase agreement with
Mexico.
Whether or not purchases will
be resumed before the oil issue is
settled was not announced by "a
responsible Treasury official" who
said that assumptions that the sil
ver pact will be reinstated were
"sound speculation."

DOLF HITLER could issue an
ultimatum over the incident
that occurred yesterday during
Czechoslovakia's second of a series
of municipal elections. Hitherto
peaceful, yesterday's balolting
brought a clash in the town of Ei
benberg between Sudeten Germans
and Communists in which four fol
lowers of Konrad Henlein were
seriously wounded.
The disorder was quickly ended by
police reserves and mobilized troops,
but the government fears repercus
sions since Henlein has already de
manded "protection of German
lives."
In almost every German district
the Suddens continued to in
crease their vote, but the full ef
fect of Hcnlcin's autonomy de
mands will not be known until
after the elections are over on
June 12.
